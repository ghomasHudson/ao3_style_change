life he’d created for himself that he’d got it right. It only dawns on him now that for the second time in his life, his world has been turned upside down on its head and shaken. This time, by the man he’s half fallen in love with.
Draco wanted to prove to Potter that he was okay, even if he was living full time on the outskirts of London as a muggle author. Even though
“And now you're completely ruined because you know what it feels like for someone to walk in your life and make you want more,” Draco says, and it's probably the most honest thing he’s ever said. The truth of it sounds off clearly and without a shadow of a doubt, Draco knows he’s
Potter shuffles and his eyes shift to the package he's holding on to his hip. Draco notices the man has again forgotten to bundle himself up properly. He wonders if Potter is using warming charms.
close. So close that Draco has to think to breathe and remind himself not to do something dramatic like grab Potter by the collar and-
“He is,” Draco replies, smiling a little with the corner of his mouth when Waylon coils himself between Potter’s legs and rubs his silky black cheek into Potter’s khaki pants. Draco lets the lopsided smirk linger momentarily just as he would have the characters in his novels do, knowing the air of confidence it portrays. The air of confidence Potter’s so easily robbed him of.
Something twists funnily in Draco’s chest at Potter’s words and he’s smiling before he actually realizes. The whole thing is oddly domestic.
He knows his eyes are about as wide as dinner plates when he sputters, “You’re leaving?”
Potter visibly relaxes, but there is still something hidden in his face. Draco takes a step back. The tension in the air seeps out slowly along the edges.
The worry in Potter’s eyes suddenly seems to make all of the sense in the world and if Draco hadn’t been so busy ordering lamps and scheming up ways to get his postman in his house he’d realized the obvious. In fact, if he’d been thinking clearly, he’d notice that it wasn’t entirely logical for Potter to be a fucking postman in the first place when his life had seemed so perfectly and utterly in order the last time Draco had seen him years ago. Draco isn’t the only one hiding from the wizarding world.
“And you don’t have to,” Draco assures him. “Sometimes saying nothing at all says more than a million misplaced and half-meant words.”
and finally get some answers.
“Waylon,” Draco provides, using this moment to look at Potter again, hard this time. Messy hair is there, browned skin, thick eyebrows, a slightly confused yet carefree expression worrying his face, thin lips, broad shoulders, green orbs. Yes, everything is there. Except - Draco bends down slightly and tries not to be too obvious as he peers up from Potter through his eyelashes.
“No,” he admits. “It’s just your suave when I delivered your first package didn’t scream new age romantic to me. But after being wined and dined tonight, I’d consider myself pleasantly surprised.”
ing Potter.
“Going through my mail are we?” Draco raises an eyebrow. Potter doesn’t need to know about that Draco’s already cleared away space in his spare bedroom to make room for his new lamp. Right next to the second one that’s still in its box. Right next to Draco’s brain because he’s clearly misplaced it the way Potter laughs at his snipe. “On the contrary, I can hardly believe you find three packages excessive?”
This is the part where Draco smooths everything over with his mask of calm and collectivism and replies with something witty. “Oh.”
Draco would’ve likely fallen over if Potter hadn’t been speaking to a purring Waylon who winds around his ankles.
It’s a long time before Draco feels his heart slow. Harry sits up to look at Draco, eyes warm and a small smile at the corner of his mouth, before pressing their foreheads together. “You’re so beautiful.”
“Until next time?” Draco asks when Potter steps over the threshold.
They walk to the door slowly. Potter's still in his uniform, of course, reminding Draco that they both have a job to get back to. Draco's job does not include being a sleuth, unfortunately. The khaki material is as thin as ever but covers Potter's browned skin all the same. He seems unbothered by the gust of cold air that wafts in when Draco opens the oak door. Waylon meows in protest at the fleeting visitor.
Three knocks, one two three, the third a little harder than the rest.
Its Draco’s turn to blush now, and he does behind the wine glass he lifts to his lips. “That’s me told, then.” Potter’s laugh rings out loudly now and bounces obnoxiously off of Draco’s walls. He finds himself smiling at the man’s shaking shoulders and aims to make Potter laugh again sometime soon. Once Potter’s regained a shred of his dignity Draco asks his own question. “Have you always been a postman?”
“So is it a series then or three different plots completely?”
“Do you do that often?”
“May I come in?” Harry asks.
Part of him is disappointed with his lack of effort lately. Never had he abandoned his work so willingly. Funnily enough, he can’t remember ever being so relaxed and happy in his life either. Of course, writing gives him the outlet he so desperately needs. But maybe even that isn’t a bandage large enough to cover a wound Draco didn’t even realize he had.
At some point, Draco had found himself unable to hold Potter’s gaze. When he looks up the man’s eyes are so bright yet conflicted. His expression is unreadable. “I don’t know what to say.”
A knock on the door pulls Draco from his work. He’s written almost half the day already and his fingers are cramping but he’s
doing better. Potter had been the Auror to pick Draco up after another wizard, the one who’d busted his lip and cracked his ribs, reported a badly beaten wizard in an alleyway in the heart of muggle London. Somewhere he’d presumed to be safe. He’d been working as a tailor in a muggle suit shop at the time, unable to find work in the wizarding world. He’d closed up shop quite later than he normally would due to a couple of leisurely, cigar-smoking businessmen.
. To busy himself, he makes a cup of tea in the kitchen, dutifully avoiding looking at anything he doesn’t absolutely have to. It’s just, every time he so much as glances at his countertop he can see Potter chopping vegetables with a grin on his face and making side eyes at Draco. Everytime he walks past the dining table he can see Potter drinking expensive wine and looking at him like he’s the only one worth looking at. Everytime he bends down to pop open a cabinet he can see Potter crouched down petting Waylon, running his strong, calloused hands through the shiny fur.
Something about the fierce bitterness in Potter’s eyes resonates so deeply with Draco he struck speechless for a moment. It isn’t because what Potter is saying is particularly profound, just that Draco didn’t realize how wrong he was and had been about the Golden Boy his whole life. It took him years to learn how to not assume and to instead ask questions. He can’t help but wonder what else is yet to be debunked.
Even though the prospect of having Harry back in his home and the possibility of falling back into their routine sparks a deep thrill in him, it is masked by the small sense of self-preservation Draco has left. “I don’t know if I can,” he says quietly. It isn’t as if he’s about to cry, though he feels like he could, but he simply can’t subject himself to another letdown, well-meant as it may be.
“Distracted?” Potter repeats. Draco doesn’t miss the worry in his voice.
“No, I’m on a tight schedule-”
“Is that your cat?” Potter asks, ever obviously, craning his neck to take a closer look at Waylon. Draco shifts on his feet so that Waylon can squeeze along the doorframe and out onto the porch. He steps out carefully and sniffs the cold air before deciding it isn’t overly offensive and paws over to Potter. His paws leave perfect little melted prints with each step he makes towards Potter.
They take their dinner in the dining room where Draco’s sat at the head and Potter claims the seat adjacent. Plates are filled and wine glasses are emptied as Waylon takes turns winding through and around their legs.
“I’ve been your postman for over two years now.”
Instead of spelling away the liquid, Draco gently lifts his parchment and pushes his quill aside. He takes a bit of crumpled napkin he’d used as a plate for his biscuits and dabs at the spreading tea, catching any droplets before they can smear any more of his ink. He’s done this enough to not let it bother him anymore. Anyway, these are merely Draco’s drafts. He’s due to meet with his editor later in the coming months to go over any revisions before his book is submitted for publishing. From there, someone else will be given the task of transcribing every single word, anecdote, and metaphor to a high class, leatherbound book in which they’ll be sold in muggle bookstores around the world.
If the blond squints a bit it looks like Potter’s smirking. “Yeah, not since school.”
“You don’t have t-”
“I think I saw something about green eyes?” he waggles his eyebrows.
Draco begins to stir but before he can properly sit up, Potter looks down at him with his thick eyebrows pulled together. “Hi.”
of doing what I was supposed to do according to everyone else.”
Potter turns and steps down the front porch while Draco watches, his chest suddenly clenched tight. It doesn’t seem right having to wait and
“Do what?” Draco swallows and tries to jolt his heart back into beating because,
Something clenches funnily in Draco’s chest as he looks at Harry. His eyes are glittering and his hands twitch nervously as they thumb the seam of his jumper.
And Draco is flummoxed because that’s what Potter said to him when they first started seeing each other because Potter is edging towards the door because he looks like Draco’s just suggested putting him on display atop Gringotts—
He looks over at the
Draco’s up before he even hears the knock this time, so when it comes it takes him no time to swing the door open and reveal a red nosed Potter on his step.
The world feels like it's tipped on its side ever so slightly, just enough for Draco to notice the shift, before it rights itself. And when it does it's like he's seeing Potter for the very first time. Blazing green eyes that look like pools, light dusting of freckles over his cheeks and nose, a faint scar just at his cupid's bow, hair that curls wildly around his face, framing it like a black halo. Draco doesn't know what passes between them then but it's something Draco will never forget.
Draco had been pacing. If he’s being honest, he wouldn't be surprised if he'd worn a rut in his floor.
Two weeks pass before Draco orders his next lamp. But it isn’t until that afternoon that his doorbell rings.
“So, I’m coming in then?” A smile curves charmingly at the corner of Potter’s lips as he asks like he knows already he’s throwing Draco for a loop.
“Can I help you?” Draco says cooly, surprised at the composure still present in his voice.
“You just don’t have the proper clothes-”
The relief that flows through him is instant, like a wave from the ocean that crashes over him. He feels weightless as the tension eases out of his body and his shoulders lower themselves. He polishes off the water and sets his glass down before leaning into the back of the sofa and closing his eyes.
“I want to feel you,” he murmurs, letting his eyes roam down the length of Harry’s body as he says so. Harry pulls off with an obscene pop before climbing back over Draco to kiss his lips.
“Okay,” Draco repeats because his mouth and brain can’t form a reply more complex than that. The gesture is small, of course it is, but Draco can’t stop his heart from swelling and his lips from curving into a small grin. He can’t help himself from falling deeper still. He forgets why it is he even doubted for one moment the sheer rightness he feels when he’s with Potter. He feels his whole equilibrium shift and center on Potter like he’s the only fucking thing holding him to the earth. “Can I ask you something?”
Draco is jealous, furious.
The Weasel tells him it’s not worth it. Draco sneers, ice in his heart.
Kingsley looked livid, but everything he had said was true. Harry hadn’t realized that the letter could have been a ruse, and suddenly he felt extremely incompetant. Kingsley must have seen this on his face because he tiredly rubbed his eyes and softened his voice when he said, “Harry, you are one of my best Aurors when it comes to jumping into action. But you can’t just run in without considering all the possibilities. No amount of training is going to teach you that.”
There was reverence in Harry’s tone as he said his name, desperation and long-suppressed desire mixing into the wanton way his voice curled around the syllables. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine when Harry playfully licked his lips, the movement slow and deliberate, unhurried as he tried to entice Draco into giving him what he wanted.
Weaving his hands into midnight tresses he tilted Harry’s head to the side and pressed his lips back against his lovers. He felt almost feverish with his desire for the man, his hips thrusting steadily, jerking forward and burying himself once more as he traced the outline of Harry’s lips with his tongue.
“D-draco.”
“P-please,” Harry moaned heatedly, voice breaking as he tried to get the plea out.
Harry was panting again, chest heaving and his body feebly trying to buck up into Draco’s, his cock itching for the friction the contact promised. And Draco knew it wouldn’t take long this time around.
“No,” he whined, pulling him closer. “Don’t go.”
Shifting back, Draco slipped out of the glorious heat until nothing but the tip of his cock rested inside.  Harry let out a shuddering whine at the feeling, bereft of Draco’s cock, his hole twitching feebly, his fingers frantically digging into the fabric around his wrists. Draco only waited a moment - could only wait a moment - before he had to plunge back inside, a soft growl falling over his lips as he bent down to mouth against sweat-covered flesh, unable to take his hands off the man beneath him.
“Please, what, Harry?”
“Mhhh, aaah…”
He gave his lover a moment to catch his bearings, knowing that the added sensations were a lot to take in. It wasn’t just the lube he had so carefully and strategically placed on Harry’s body – no, the plug had been spelled to release it all day long, whenever Harry had needed it.
„Come for me, love.“
“Would you have liked that? A shag in the ministry’s loos? Or perhaps… your office even?”
“Dra-a-co,” Harry sobbed, his muscles clenching around the toy. His skin was flushed, his cock throbbing where it was pressed against Draco’s trousers, and Draco could hear the exact moment when the plug shrunk yet again, Harry’s desolate whine echoing in the room around them.
“And you lo-“ Harry started, only to stop abruptly as his eyes met Draco’s.
“Patience, love.”
“You like the feeling of your arse so nice and full? To have your hole fucked wide open and gaping, don’t you Harry?”
Humming, Draco tangled their legs together and let his arm fall around Harry’s waist, intent on keeping the other close. He nuzzled into Harry as the words kept coming, all but melting into the warm embrace.
Tilting his head to the side he sucked on Harry’s tongue, revelling in the filthy sound that accompanied his sharp thrust against Harry’s prostate. Tremors wrecked through Harry’s body, and Draco could feel Harry’s cock twitching where it was pressed against his abdomen. It felt slick and scorching hot, doubtlessly leaking more and more precome onto his belly.
And now, after hours of wearing it, the lube must have seeped into his walls, coating them in a nice, thick layer and making him all wet and slippery inside. Gods, Draco couldn’t wait to plunge into the scorching heat.
He was openly sobbing now, chest heaving as his body desperately tried to push him over the edge. Just a tiny bit more, Draco knew, and Harry would have come all over himself.
A low gasp fell over Harry’s lips when Draco decided to tighten the ropes. He didn’t think he’d ever get enough of the other calling him by his first name, but Harry was best to remember who exactly was in charge right now.
He pressed a single finger against the tapered end of the plug, jostling its position intentionally.
Firm hands were on him immediately, pressing his hips down and preventing him from writhing around. “Ah, ah, ah,” Draco chided softly, keeping Harry’s body still until the message seemed to sink in.
He hadn’t even realized that.
He let his forehead rest against Harry’s, closed his eyes and relished in the affectionate warmth spreading through him. He let his lips slide against Harry’s once more, tenderly, and allowed himself to drown in the soft caresses, the movements slow yet deliberate as Harry reciprocated, unhurried in the exploration of his mouth. He playfully nipped at Harry’s bottom lip, letting his tongue delve into Harry’s mouth once he finally opened up; a lewd, muffled whine all the incentive he needed. Licking his way inside, he swirled his tongue around Harry’s, the strokes torturously teasing, yet deliciously thrilling.
“I did,” Harry panted, green eyes blazing. “Want all of you.”
“You are,” Harry said, and Draco could feel the grin against his chest. “Spoiled beyond belief.”
“That’s right, Harry. It’s me who’s doing this to you. Not some nameless ‘sir’ or ‘master’. Not Malfoy.
Pressing one last, lingering kiss to Harry’s lips, he flicked his wand to stop the plug and bent down to gently retrieve it from Harry’s abused hole. Harry whined as he extracted the plug, his arse stretched wide and greedily clutching on to the toy, until Draco finally got it out with a loud squelch.
More wax dripped onto Harry’s skin, hot and scorching as it spilled over his perked up nipples this time, causing his body to writhe helplessly on the sheets. And what a display it was. Draco shivered at the sight, his cock giving an eager twitch inside his pants. Patience. All in due time.
“You know better than that,
“Patience is a virtue, love. Good things come to those who wait,” he paused briefly, watched as Harry shuddered helplessly, complete and utterly at Draco’s mercy, before finally whispering, “
It had been a nifty little invention, he had to say so himself.
“Can you feel how hard I am for you, Harry? How hard you make me?”
“Oh, god, Draco,” Harry panted, shuddering as nimble fingers danced along his aching cock. “Yes, yes, I liked it. Loved it.”
“G-green,” Harry gasped, trying so hard to get the word out.
“One more round, love.”
The reaction was instantaneous.
Their lips met once more, a soft mewl stifled by their tongues gliding languidly against each other. This kiss wasn’t feverish or rushed. No, it was tender, filled with raw emotion, with trust and adoration, and Draco couldn’t have stopped himself even if he had wanted to.
“Ah, ‘m so-“ Harry’s breath hitched mid-apology. A needy groan tumbled off his lips, his back arching oh so prettily as hot wax splattered all over his chest. He was writhing on the bed now, muscles tensing and quivering as the heat scorched mercilessly through his body.
With a quick movement of his wrist, he released the cockring and watched as Harry all but threw his head back into the pillows, eyes shut tight as he convulsed in Draco’s arms, spurting hot seed all over their heaving chests, ribbon of ribbon of white being fucked straight out of him.
Harry whined. The sound helpless and desolate, so desperate for any form of friction he could find.
Slowly easing up on the pressure, he let one hand trail down to where the plug was nestled, teasing along the edges of Harry’s puckering ring. The muscles clenched and tensed around the plug, eagerly sucking it deeper inside.
“You should see yourself right now, love. Can’t wait to be inside of you.”
. He licked his lips at the mental image the thought conjured, tracing the phantom touch Harry’s tongue had left behind before focusing his attention back on the situation at hand.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry mewled eagerly, trembling against his restraints as the cold seeped into his skin, his dick jerking up wantonly.
Shaking his head, he righted himself and stepped back. “Not yet. I’m not quite done with you,” he promised darkly.
Harry whimpered; the sound soft yet laced with unbridled desire.
Closing his eyes he let out a soft sigh, content to bask in the blissful intimacy between them. And right then and there, after everything they’d gone through over the years, he couldn’t help but wonder yet again:
A hopeless groan tumbled over Harry’s lips when Draco finally found his mark, his body arching up as Draco started teasing his perked up nipple, rolling it softly between his fingers; alternating between gentle motions and pinching the sensitive bud.
“I can feel you twitching around me, so eager to milk me dry, aren’t you?”
A low groan of gratification escaped him when he felt the slick heat grip him tightly, the muscles clenching around him almost as if trying to milk him dry. Merlin, Harry felt bloody amazing.
A thin sheen of sweat covered Harry’s skin, his body taut with pleasure, his cock twitching feebly between Draco’s fingers almost as if it was throbbing along with the warmth scorching through his body. Precome was leaking freely now, and Draco could tell that Harry was getting closer and closer with each stifling minute he kept up his teasing.
A low hum of approval slipped past his lips at the possessive thought.
With a few last stuttered thrusts he buried himself deep inside of Harry and came, a loud groan muffled into Harry’s collarbone as he spilled himself. Every muscle in his body clenched in euphoric pleasure, the warm walls of Harry’s arse milking his twitching cock dry.
Little gasps and tiny mewls were all the indication Draco got at how pleasurable and tantalizingly teasing his actions were, so he kept it up, alternating between a loose fist around Harry’s cockhead and letting his fingers dance and glide over the glistening ridge.
Harry’s hands twitched in frustration against the bindings holding him captive, a needy little whimper escaping him, and Draco couldn’t help but revel in the sound.
They had always managed to get under each other’s skin, Potter especially so when he was acting all righteous and Gryffindor-ish (Draco still couldn’t truly fathom how he’d ended up in the den of one), only now they had a more enjoyable outlet for their frustrations.
He’d broken the kiss in favour of leaning his forehead against Harry’s, their panted breaths mingling as his hands stroked over Harry’s sides in silent reassurance.
The friction was no longer enough to satisfy the deep-seated hunger within him. He wanted to devour Harry. To fuck him until he couldn’t stand on his own two feet anymore, incapable of leaving their bed, limp and blissed out.
“One more, Harry. I know you have one more in you for me.”
“And how eager you must have been, for me to come along, drag you out and finally impale you on my cock.”
“Please! I will, I will,” Harry promised desperately, his voice pitching higher as Draco’s fingers trailed once more over his bobbing cock before slowly wandering further up, tracking their way along the hardened wax marring Harry’s skin.
A never-ending stream of appreciative moans accompanied his words as he mouthed along Harry’s jaw, littering the skin in teasing nips and bites. A trail of glistening marks was left in his wake, his teeth grazing and bruising, all but claiming Harry as his own.
“I’m sure you felt it,” he continued, voice smooth as honey as he took in the raw desperation edged onto Harry’s face. “How the plug denied you. How it stopped and shrank, not giving you that last little push you so desperately needed.”
“Did you like the thought of keeping yourself loose and ready for me?”
He gently wiped away the tears staining Harry’s cheeks, fingers tender and reverent as he pressed reassuring kisses all over his face.
Harry hummed and pressed his face back into the crook of Draco’s neck.
Stepping forward, Harry jerked slightly as Draco wrapped his dry hand around Harry's length, gingerly sliding the cockring into place, securing it tightly around his balls and ever careful not to spread the lube all over Harry’s shaft.
Grey eyes raked shamelessly over the naked form of Harry Potter, writhing wantonly on the aforementioned bed, his hunger no doubt all but poorly concealed. He let his gaze trail slowly over the lithe body wrapped so prettily in the emerald, silk bindings. Bindings that Draco had conjured - at Harry’s behest, even. And the mere reminder of that; how
A deep moan tumbled over Harry’s lips, a bead of precome dribbling down his shaft as the wax slowly cooled down on his overheated skin.
“What’s your colour, love?”
Draco groaned. He felt the velvety walls constrict and spasm around him, leaving small tremors to jolt through his throbbing erection. He frantically increased his pace, chasing his own release with wanton abandon as he pounded into the limp body beneath him. Harry’s walls rippled around his cock, his muscles constricting around the thick length as he rode out his orgasm, and the sight of him of him like that – blissed and fucked out – was enough to cause Draco to tumble over the edge.
Harry’s broken sob was a thing of beauty.
“You feel so perfect around me, sucking me in so greedily.”
Truth be told, he’d never expected this to happen, not given their past… misgivings. It had most certainly not been an easy road to get where they were today. Miscommunication and misunderstandings had accompanied them on every step of their journey, and yet they had prevailed. They were both too stubborn not to, well, at least he was when Harry Potter was concerned.
“Ple-ase, Draco,” Harry mewled, desperation tingeing his voice at the delicious friction, his own hips trying feebly to roll upwards, frantic to feel Draco’s cock against his own. “Give it to mmh, me.”
“F-fuck,” Harry panted, eyes wide-open, hair mussed beyond belief.
He swallowed hard. “Was that okay? It wasn’t too much for you, right? I didn’t-, I-“
Some might call it possessiveness, but Draco didn’t care. Now that he finally had Harry, he wasn’t inclined to let go of him any time soon.
“Manners, Potter. Or have you forgotten them?” he drawled, managing to sound almost bored despite the aching desire coursing his veins. He usually didn’t mind when Harry used his last name, but within the boundaries of a scene he absolutely couldn’t stand it.
His throat went dry at the sight, but instead of focusing on the lube slowly dribbling out of Harry’s arse and how good it would look like replaced with his come, his gaze flicked upwards again to the mess he’d reduced Harry to.
If it had been any other night he would have loved to suck and lave at the furrowed ring of muscle, but the teasing had gone on for long enough. He’d feast on Harry’s arse another time.
“P-please,” Harry begged once more.
“I-“ His gut churned as he tried to find the words. Deep down he knew what this was about, he just hadn’t realized that it was bothering him so much. He’d gone further today than he ever had with Harry. Had edged him for longer, pushed him to his limits, and a part of him feared that it had been too much.
Desire was coursing heavily through his veins as he let his hand slide along Harry’s side, the heated contact making the other shiver. He felt Harry’s eager lips against his, desperately coaxing him further into the heated exchange, and each stroke of soft flesh; each swipe of that lithe tongue against his only fuelled the fire burning brightly inside of him.
pressed inside.
It was in moments like these, where Draco wondered how he’d ever gotten so lucky.
He was panting now, shifting his angle ever so slightly, filling and refilling Harry’s tight arse over and over again, making him moan and keen.
A sly smile curled on his lips when Harry’s erection jerked helplessly against his stomach, eagerly begging for release. The head was glistening with precome, the liquid dancing in the orange hues of the candles floating above them.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you Harry? To have me mark the deepest part inside of you.” His tongue flicked out to add another mark to Harry’s ever-growing collection, his hips steady as he pushed his way back inside the welcoming heat.
“Where anyone could have walked in and seen us? Where they could have seen you bent over your desk, and me, buried balls-deep inside of you?”
“You’ve been so good for me, Harry. So perfect. Beautiful. Taking it so well for me.”
Draco hummed in contemplation.
Harry let out a filthy moan in response, his eyes closing briefly as the words washed over him.
Draco flicked his wrist and murmured a spell, watching with avid satisfaction as Harry’s entire body suddenly jolted upwards, tensing and shivering as a lascivious moan was torn from his throat.
His breath ghosted over the sensitive spot on Harry’s neck, his voice low and sultry as he asked, “Don’t you want something thicker? Something bigger to fill you up, down here?”
„Nhh, y-yours, Draco. Yours.“
He was close. So close.
“Thirsty,” Harry groaned, arching into his touch like a cat begging for more.
,” Harry managed, eyes fluttering.
“You want to be filled right up to the brim, don’t you, love? Your tight little hole stretched so wide, it can barely take any more.”
He watched as Harry’s hands desperately grasped onto the silk bindings - as if it was his life-line, the last thing grounding him from the pleasure threatening to overwhelm him completely.
“Just a little more love, I know you can give me one more.”
Harry was outright sobbing now, writhing frantically on the sheets, his cock twitching and bobbing as his release was denied. Pleasure seemed to threaten to overwhelm him but instead of having mercy, Draco started rubbing against Harry’s frenulum again.
Tugging on the rounded flesh, his fingers trailed upwards again, never applying pressure, always light and teasing in their touch. He settled his index finger beneath Harry’s glans, right over his frenulum and gently started rubbing, the motions firm and controlled.
“Mhhh, ah, fuck, Malfoy!”
And while Draco would deny it until his last, dying breath, he secretly relished in the intimacy and trust that went hand in hand with these scenes. It wasn’t just Harry that made himself vulnerable. Draco did too.
Harry’s voice broke, his body powerless against the continuous assault wrecking through him. Draco watched as Harry gasped, shivering when a new wave of stimulation hit, before suddenly letting out a high-pitched keen and tossing his head back onto the pillows, eyes completely glazed over as his orgasm was denied once more.
“Please,” Harry sobbed brokenly. Tears were gathering in his eyes again, his body straining against Draco’s.
“Draco, please. Come on,” Harry demanded, muscles straining as he tensed in his bindings. The sudden movement must have jostled the plug buried between those firm cheeks, for at once; a surprised gasp tumbled over Harry’s lips.
had been the one to suggest this… how it had been Harry who had asked for it, to be splayed out and spread wide, at Draco’s beck and call,
He flicked his wand again, reversed the effects of the lube and watched as goose bumps spread all over Harry’s body.
A shuddering whine slipped past Harry’s lips when Draco pulled out again, his pace agonizingly slow, torturous really, but he wanted this to last. He rolled his hips forward once more, revelling in the desperate keen echoing through the room.
“P-please.” Harry’s voice shook as he tried to form words.
“N-no, si-!”
Harry’s breath hitched. He let out a soft, little whine, and while Draco usually loved the sound, right now he needed words.
Draco chuckled, the sound entirely fond. He let his fingers trail back into Harry’s hair, his nails scraping lightly over Harry’s scalp.
Harry’s legs twitched and spread just the tiniest bit further apart, opening himself up and exposing his needy little hole.
His body slowly relaxed as Harry kept talking. “You took such good care of me, Draco. You were so good to me.” Gentle fingers started carding through his hair, tousling his bangs and nudging his head into Harry’s neck.
Holding Harry’s gaze, he took out the lube and let his fingers dance over the golden cockring he'd previously kept hidden, liberally coating it in the slippery substance. He watched how Harry’s eyes followed his movements, a desperate groan escaping the other man when he finally recognized his fate.
Harry all but cried out when Draco nailed his prostate head-on, unadulterated pleasure wrecking through both of them as Harry clenched and twitched in his hold.
But firm hands held his hips back down yet again.
But even without the cockring, Harry wouldn’t be getting his release anytime soon.
He could see how glazed over Harry’s eyes were, so he cupped Harry’s cheek, fingers trailing lightly and soothingly over the soft skin as he patiently waited for Harry’s eyes to meet his.
He wiggled his ass lightly, whining when he felt Draco’s length inside of him, splitting him open. Draco was pressed flush against Harry’s arse, and the slight movement of Harry’s hips was enough for another groan to escape him, the friction too delectable.
Harry’s abdominal muscles twitched and tensed, and Draco revelled in the needy little mewls spilling over Harry’s lips. He could feel Harry’s balls tightening up beneath the tips of his fingers, and just like that he retracted his hand again.
Harry hummed breathily, almost as if he was trying to suppress laughter.
Draco’s praise was drowned out by Harry’s frantic moan. The plug had started back up again as soon as Harry had given the go-ahead, leaving Draco with a first-row seat to Harry tensing and twisting beneath him, his hips wiggling frantically with the movement of the plug inside of him.
“Hush, love. I’ve got you.”
Draco hummed. “You’re doing so well for me, love.”
Draco clicked his tongue in fond exasperation. “Harry,” he echoed, one pale eyebrow raised pointedly. He almost couldn’t believe the shagged-out-look was doing it for him these days.
“It adjusts, love,” Draco said, arousal heavy in his tone. “It adjusts itself to your deepest desires.”
Harry quickly set the glass on the nightstand and then pulled him back down into his arms.
He leaned down so his face was hovering above his lovers, cupped Harry’s cheek with one hand and used his other hand to line himself up with the wet heat of Harry’s lubed up arse. The tip of his cock twitched as it brushed against the warm rim of muscle, eager to plunge inside.
A filthy gasp vibrated against his lips as Draco bucked his hips, rolling them slowly back and forth and letting Harry feel the straining need tenting his trousers. Harry keened at the long overdue stimulation, throwing his head back and baring his marked up throat so prettily for Draco’s greedy mouth.
Harry tasted divine.
“Do you like it, love? I had it custom-made, just for you.”
“y-y, uuh-“ Harry whined. “More, please, n-need you. Draco.”
“Colour?”
Gradually coming down from his high, Draco pressed a small kiss to Harry’s throat, shifted his hips back and slowly slipped out of the tight heat. He almost couldn’t take his eyes off the sight of his come slowly dribbling out of Harry’s abused hole, but reminding himself of the Egyptian cotton sheets that lay precariously beneath them, he quickly grabbed his wand and flicked a strong cleaning spell over both of them.
He had half a mind to blindfold the git for that. Just to be petty. But a larger part of him wanted Harry to see him, wanted Harry to know who was doing this to him, wanted him to watch as Draco
“Y-yea- ah!”
The lube was effectively spelled to change temperatures according to the user’s wishes, and right now he’d gifted Harry heat. Not quite blazing yet, but hot enough to leave his skin pink and tingling, sensitive to any ensuing touch.
“You like this, don’t you, Harry? My hand on your cock, giving you pleasure?”
“You’re so bloody tight,” he panted.
“You do, don’t you Harry? What a wanton, little thing you are.”
Grumbling, Harry took the glass. “You’re so bossy.”
His own arousal was simmering low in his gut, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from rocking into Harry faster now, his thrusts stronger, deeper as he took his pleasure from the pliant body beneath him. Unabashed hunger was scorching through him as he pushed into Harry with renewed vigour. He felt the press of Harry’s round globes against his balls, and how stuffed full the other was. Filled up with Draco’s cock. He shivered at the thought, his length twitching inside the hot channel constricting so deliciously around him.
He slotted himself right in between Harry’s splayed legs, hands on those gorgeous hips, and finally took pity on the whimpering man beneath him. He slowly pressed his pelvis down; hissing as his own erection made contact with Harry’s leaking cock.
Sees Potter with the Chang girl.
And I am sorry, Harry. For everything. I’m sorry that I was such a prat in school. I’m sorry that I joined the people who killed your family. I’m sorry that I never told you any of this till now. I’m sorry that I never…
Mother helps. Harry escapes.
His parents will die.
I used to look down on people who ended their own lives. I thought they were selfish cowards. I couldn’t understand how they could do that to their families. I couldn’t understand why they didn’t just seek help.
Harry was surprised to see that the letter was not secured to the owl’s foot, and as he took it, a chill went down his spine. The somewhat familiar-looking owl gave him an urgent hoot before taking back off into the night.
Tears started falling down Harry’s cheeks as he remembered all of his happy memories from Hogwarts. He felt homesick, and it angered him to know that he missed out on so much because of Voldemort and the war. Harry started to sob as he remembered the final battle and all the people who had died. He thought of Remus and Tonks and felt a pang of guilt realizing he had not gone to visit Teddy in over a month. He had a responsibility to him, and even though he knew Andromeda was taking good care of him, he was hit with a wave of self-loathing knowing that he was failing as a godfather. At some point, Harry drifted off into a half-sleep as he beat himself up over his mistakes and regrets.
Harry trudged up to his bedroom and kicked off his shoes. He undressed but left his clothes in a heap on the floor, pulling on a t-shirt and pajama bottoms before crawling into an oversized bed. He stared up at the ceiling and thought about how much he wished he were going back to Hogwarts this year. He knew he could still take up McGonagall’s offer to complete his seventh year now that the war had ended. There was really no reason for him to go back, though. He had already started working at what was supposed to be his dream job.
Draco just leaves.
Tara softly cleared her throat, bringing Draco’s attention back to her. “Another great goal is opening up communication. Have you considered writing to anyone about what you are going through?”
He awoke with a start when he heard a tapping at his window. In his tired mind he thought
sorry this chapter took so long! i had written it out but i needed help editing it. hope you like it! c:
“I’m sorry...Hermoine.”
Harry is there. He says he didn’t mean it. Draco doesn’t care. He’s relieved.
“Nicholas Banks,” Kingsley answered calmly. Harry tried to remember if he had met him before but couldn’t put a face with the name. Kingsley looked back at him and said, “Upon his arrival you shall report to me immediately, Potter.”
“Kingsley will be here soon,” Harry said. “You’re going to have to answer some questions.”
, not Ron or Hermione.
Still, it made sense that Tara would want to hear his side of the story. If she didn’t ask him what had happened, she might not get the whole picture. Shacklebolt was sure to have his own biased opinion on the situation, and even if he didn’t, Draco knew that Potter did.
Well, it doesn’t matter. I am sorry.
Fenrir has his arms around him. Terror.
“Well, that took you long enough.”
The world is ending.
Harry writes a letter to Mother.
I should make it clear that this is only an attempt. Draco does not die at the end of this chapter.
But I missed my chance. And then instead of trying again, I chose to make you regret it. I wanted you to pay attention to me, to look at me. I wanted to get a rise out of you, to make you lose control. I didn’t really know why for a long time. I assumed it was because you had power, reputation. I thought I wanted you beneath me.
It was Friday night, so Harry was expected at the Burrow for dinner. He thought of skipping, not wanting to deal with the grief that he felt for Fred whenever he saw any of the red-headed Weasleys. But knew that he would regret it if he didn’t go. Friday nights were the only time of the week when he was regularly able to socialize, and he missed his friends.
He stopped in front of it. He was breathing hard, probably too hard, and fast. He felt something cold and wet on his forehead and when he reached out to the doorknob, he saw his hand shake before meeting with metal. Harry didn’t know what would be behind this door. His brain was telling him that he did know what he was going to find and that he shouldn’t open this door and that he should get out of there now because this couldn’t be happening and it shouldn’t be happening and it wouldn’t be happening if Harry would just go back home right now. But Harry had this tiny hope that he was wrong.
Draco will die.
Draco passes by Umbridge’s office.
, he thought. His timing couldn’t have been worse. But before he had a chance to turn around and step back into the fireplace, Ron rounded the corner, ears and cheeks red from anger. He stopped dead in his tracks at the sight of a horrified Harry, and his face began to drain of color.
In a second, Draco is bleeding on the floor.
“Harry.”
If he doesn’t?
He claimed to be in her debt.
Draco looked down at his hands in his lap. He clenched and unclenched them, watching the muscles beneath his skin move. Draco couldn’t remember the last time something ‘felt right’ to him. Everything always felt wrong.
Hermione nodded, then pulled her knees up to her chest and hugged them, resting her forehead on her arms. Harry draped his arm over her shoulder and sat quietly with her.
Surprise. Something flutters in Draco’s chest.
Harry cautiously took a step forward into the room and tried again, “Malfoy?”
“No,” Malfoy looked regretful at this statement, and Harry wondered why.
That night towards the end of the war, Harry had lost yet another friend. He remembered Dobby saving them, sacrificing his life for Harry and Ron and
He still felt a sense of shock at the thought of Malfoy attempting suicide. He couldn’t imagine anyone like Malfoy feeling compelled to end their life. He had always seemed so confident and proud of himself when they were at Hogwarts. Too proud, really. He was full of himself.
They pass on the stairs.
Harry faces consequences for his not-so-great Auror work.
She smiles. “What if he says yes?”
he thought anxiously. He slowly pulled out the letter and began to scan it.
I’m dropping all formalities. I’m too tired. If you are reading this, then I’m sure you already know what I’ve done. I’m sure you knew it would end like this for me. I’ve known for quite some time.
Malfoy didn’t look up or move, so Harry handed Malfoy’s wand to Kingsley and said, “I received a letter from Malfoy that he was going to-” Harry was surprised to find his voice catch in his throat. He looked at Malfoy again, then back at Kingsley, then decided against finishing his sentence. He pulled the letter out of his pocket and handed it to Kingsley, who skimmed over it quickly.
“Let me help you.” He doesn’t want to, but he lets her.
The war is over.
“It’s just for your safety,” Harry said stiffly.
“Harry, mate, you gotta see this new candy George created for the shop!” Ron said excitedly from the table, holding a box of small pink balls which Harry guessed were some sort of prank candies.
At nine-thirty, Harry reluctantly bade everyone goodnight and promised to see them next week before flooing to 12 Grimmauld Place. Stepping out into the dark, mostly empty house, Harry sighed heavily. He had had a good time with the Weasleys. He always did. He couldn’t deny that it was emotionally exhausting, however, and he was relatively glad to be back to a quiet space. It didn’t take long for him to wish he were anywhere else, however. This house seemed to suck him into a dark place every time he entered it, and despite his attempts at decorating, it felt cold and lifeless.
“Thanks, ‘Mione,” Harry chuckled sarcastically, earning him a light shove. They were quiet for another moment.
Draco and Tara talk about goals and relationships. Draco is very low energy and sad. They don’t talk about the journaling from the last chapter.
Harry touches Draco’s cheek.
I am not a mental health professional. The interactions between Draco and Tara are solely based on personal experience working with therapists.
Before leaving the room, Harry looked back at Malfoy, who was still watching the fire gloomily. Harry felt a twinge of guilt that he couldn’t quite explain before turning to the door and slowly making his way out of the manor. He tried to keep his mind blank as he walked through the haunted rooms. He was tired, and already the anxiety about his meeting with Kingsley was building inside of him. He had no room for memories and unwanted thoughts of the past.
“I know,” he nudged her knee with his, letting her know that she wasn’t alone.
Tara studied Draco’s face, probably taking in the annoyance in his eyes, and calmly replied, “Mr. Shacklebolt told me your name and that you were in need of a Home Healer. I was told that you were suicidal.”
Harry felt like he’d been hit in the gut with a hammer.
while not only on the job but also in a room with a former Death Eater. You are lucky to still be alive. How do you know that letter was not just a trap to lure you in? For all your experience with dangerous situations, your actions tonight make it clear that you are either too oblivious or just too indifferent to account for your own safety.”
He wishes it wasn’t.
Harry will die.
Teddy gives Draco a drawing.
Draco gave Tara a slight nod, and she seemed to take this as agreement. Her smile brightened a bit as she said, “Excellent. We can go outside every morning after breakfast. Perhaps we can take walks in the afternoons before dinner as well.”
Harry is escaping.
It’s a drawing of Teddy, Draco, and Harry.
They didn’t say anything at first. Harry just held Hermione as she cried, and when she calmed, they both moved to the couch to sit in silence. They watched the flames of the fire burning low in the fireplace, and Harry tried not to remember the night before. He willed himself to think of something else, like all the times Sirius had spoken to him through the floo network at Hogwarts. But then Harry felt a pang of sadness. What he wouldn’t give to have Sirius back....
Draco didn’t bother to act interested. They hadn’t even made it to dinner yet, and he was exhausted of this charade. He had no intention to set goals or ‘find purpose’ in life. Draco Malfoy had squandered his life away. What was there left to salvage?
Mentions of suicidality and implied eating disorder.
Tara’s answer was professional, but her body remained relaxed as she replied, “I’ve been working in the mental health field for about ten years. I was a healer at Saint Mungos for seven of those before I decided to work independently with patients.”
Harry and Weasley are fighting.
“Yes,” Malfoy said quietly but not without a note of irritation as he rolled his eyes.
Part of him wanted to roll his eyes, but Draco also remembered how relaxed he had felt out in the garden that morning. He felt a pang of something similar to homesickness at the memory of sitting by the lake at Hogwarts. The feeling of sunshine on his face, the wind whipping through his hair. It struck him how cooped up he had been in the last few months.
Draco wakes from a nightmare.
He is
“Do you have a hist-” Kingsley began but Malfoy interrupted.
Malfoy wasn’t looking at him, instead staring into the dying flames. He looked mournful in the faint light. Harry wondered what it was like for him, being in this position. Even though he had also experienced thoughts of suicide, it had never gotten to the point of having the control over his decisions taken from him. He tried to tell himself that this was what was best for Malfoy, but a small part of him felt bad for him. He squashed that part of him down and told it to shut up. After all, this was
I’ve answered how, now for the why. Well, do I even have to tell you? You know what I am, what I was. Even before I joined the Death Eaters, I was vermin. Constantly trying to get you and your friends in trouble at school. Doing my best to put you all beneath me. Talking down to those I believed were worth less than dirt. I even tried to get Hagrid fired and that hippogriff killed. I was rotten.
They pass in the corridor.
It’s a lost cause.
As soon as the first few morning rays hit his window, Harry had made up his mind. He wasn’t going to waste these next couple of weeks. He had work to do, progress to make. He set down his tea, rose from the couch, and ascended the stairs to get dressed for the day. He pulled on a sweater and a pair of dark jeans and ran a hand through his long, curled hair. Running down the stairs for the second time in twelve hours, Harry’s mind was no longer panicked. He felt determined and sure.
“Do you possess any muggle weapons or any wands that we are not aware of?” Kingsley asked.
Potter turns, sees him.
Now that my parents are in Azkaban, they are under constant surveillance. When they hear the news, they will not be able to follow me into the abyss. I don’t have to worry about them anymore. True, it hurts knowing the pain I will be putting them through, but somehow I feel that they will understand. After all, it's not as though this is the first time. But it will be the last.
Malfoy scoffed and laid his head back down on his arms. Harry removed his hand and took a step back but didn’t take his eyes off of Malfoy’s back. Even though Malfoy no longer had his wand, Harry couldn’t leave him alone until more help arrived. It was protocol. They waited like that until Kingsley made his way up to them.
(See the end of the chapter for
He jumped into action, sending a patronus carrying a message to Kingsley, “THIS IS URGENT I NEED AN AUROR AT MALFOY MANOR IMMEDIATELY! MALFOY IS IN DANGER! HURRY!” It wasn’t until he had sent the patronus off that it occurred to him that he forgot to tell Kingsley what to expect when he got there, but Harry couldn’t think about that right now. He couldn’t think about Malfoy lying lifeless on the floor, he couldn’t think about blood flowing from his chest, he couldn’t think about
Malfoy made eye contact with Harry before flushing and looking down as he whispered, “Yes.” A chill went down Harry’s back.
Harry looks him in the face. Harry.
Harry is having emotions and thoughts that are a bit overwhelming.
***Content Warning***
Harry winced at the use of his last name, suspecting a less than friendly chat awaiting him. He nodded his head once and watched as Kingsley’s head disappeared from the fireplace. Harry’s heart sank as he realized that he was likely going to go home without a job. This wasn’t the first mistake he had made since becoming an Auror, but it was definitely one of the worst.
The verdict is not guilty.
Of course, Harry had been required to finish a rigorous four-week training course before actually going on the job. There was a lot more to Auror work than just showing up at the scene of a crime and throwing around some spells. During the training they went over different types of calls they would need to answer and how to approach different situations. A lot of the cases they were given were closer to the mundane, dealing with witches and wizards who had filed minor complaints or charges.
Harry stared at the ceiling of his bedroom for about an hour before giving up entirely on sleeping that night. He couldn’t stop going over Malfoy’s words in his mind.
Draco grunted in an uninterested way as he stared at the window. It didn’t take a lot of effort to conceal his true emotions. He had gotten very good at it during the war, always having to block his mind and emotions from the other Death Eaters and the Dark Lord. Currently, he was giving off an aura of indifference, but inside, he was filled with anger.
“It means that you are going to sit with Mr. Malfoy while I go send some owls and find a healer who is available.” He stood up and walked out the door. After a few moments Harry heard a faint pop from outside the window which indicated that Kingsley had disapparated.
sorry this chapter is so short. i will try to post again tomorrow. thanks for all the kudos!
“Mate-” Ron began, but he was cut off by the sound of Hermione yelling from the other room.
Draco watches Potter in class.
“I can’t be sure.”
Malfoy stood slowly and turned to face them. Harry noticed then that Malfoy looked significantly thinner than the last time he had seen him, and his clothes hung loosely off his body. This came as a surprise as Malfoy had always seemed to fit everything he wore perfectly. Harry frowned in confusion and mild embarrassment at the thought.
“I’m not sure I can -” she started to say, but trailed off, rubbing her eyes anxiously.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair, and built up enough courage to say, “This job means everything to me, Kingsley. I understand that you have to do what you have to do, but-” He took a shaky breath. “I’ll do anything to stay on. I’ll do paperwork for months. I just can’t lose this job.”
Teddy’s toys lay all around the living room. But Teddy is with Mother right now.
“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s 10 AM.” Laughter.
“Is it him?”
His cheeks are wet, his face sad.
Around seven thirty, everyone went into the living room for games and firewhiskies and butterbeers. Fleur delicately ran her hand over her round belly as Mrs. Weasley asked her about the names she and Bill had considered for the baby. Hermione asked Harry about his work and told him all about her new book she was writing. When George came through the floo, everyone greeted him with cheers and bade him come join them with a plate of leftovers. Ginny almost convinced him to let her rename his latest joke candy.
Draco sees Potter in the library.
Tara said softly, “I love it. It’s not easy, but it feels right."
Then he remembered Draco Malfoy.
He apparated outside the ministry building and made his way inside. He walked in a daze, thinking of what he would do if he was fired. Only three months in, and Harry had already managed to lose his dream job. What in the world was he going to do with his time? He couldn’t be left on his own with no purpose. He just couldn’t.
A tear fell on his cheek, and he ignored it. He closed his eyes and let out a hum.
He thought about that for a moment. He didn’t know how he felt about his version of events being referred to as his ‘truth’. Draco wasn’t planning on lying to Tara about anything that had happened to him, but somehow it felt weird to associate something so negative with a word that carried such positive connotations.
They are in the Room of Requirement.
Harry considers his next steps after getting suspended from the Ministry.
Kingsley shot Harry a look that said he was overstepping and Harry quieted temporarily. Kingsley continued, “OR we will need to have a qualified healer come here to Malfoy Manor to watch you. Seeing as how you’re on house arrest, the latter option will have to do. However, it will be difficult to find a healer who is willing to care for someone with your past, Mr. Malfoy.” At this, Malfoy flinched and a look of guilt crossed his face.
Draco immobilizes him. Realizes this is the only way to keep him safe.
Potter looks close to tears.
regard to your own safety, and then
Shit, I mean, what do I have to lose. This is a suicide note. It’s not really like I’m going to see you again in this life.
Harry’s heart was hammering inside his chest. He felt frozen, staring at Malfoy Manor. His memories of this place were dark, and he had wished he would never need to return. Yet here he was.
The scarring is duller now. But he can still read the writing.
Also! I probably wont be able to post again until tuesday this time, but I should be able to pick back up with new chapters every other day after that :)
Harry pulls Draco closer.
“Fuck you, Malfoy” Potter’s eyes are dark.
The evening went on with lots of laughs and catching up. There were a few moments of quiet that would occasionally settle around the room between conversation in which Harry knew everyone was thinking about Fred. He noticed Mrs. Weasley look towards the magical clock sadly a few times throughout the evening. The clock hand with Fred’s picture had fallen off after his death, but Harry supposed it would be a long time before Mrs. Weasley stopped checking to see his whereabouts from habit. Harry felt an ache in his heart whenever this happened and would look down at his plate to hide the teariness of his eyes.
Harry and Ginny had not gotten back together after the Battle of Hogwarts. They tried at first, but something had shifted between them. Every kiss felt a little off, a little forced. Harry loved her, but somehow his feelings no longer seemed to go beyond friendship. Ginny confessed that she had been feeling similarly for some time, and they agreed to call off their relationship. It was a huge relief at the time, and now Harry felt a lot more comfortable around her and the rest of the family. Nothing to hide.
Draco sighed to himself. He didn’t feel like explaining the situation with his parents or his friends. He also didn’t want to bother them with this. It was one thing to be suicidal, but it was something else entirely for everyone to
sorry this chapter is a bit short. hope you like it!
Harry stared blankly at the mountain of paperwork in front of him. He had been working as an auror for several months now, and despite getting on well with his coworkers and excelling in the hands-on parts of the job, he never quite got the hang of the monotony of the reports that came after.
Draco was perched in one of the armchairs next to the fireplace in the sitting room. Tara sat on the sofa - the same sofa that he remembered as his mother’s favorite - and watched his face. She had just asked him if he had any goals and what they were. Now, it seemed, she expected him to answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco is terrified. “What if he says no?”
Harry shows up to Christmas with Teddy.
He wasn’t going to let his traumas control his life anymore. He threw a pinch of floo powder into the flames, stepped in, and announced “Ron and Hermione’s”.
At that, Malfoy’s eyes flew open. “I didn’t do anything illegal,” he said defiantly.
I’m in love with you Potter.
Finally he saw Malfoy move as he took a deep breath and let out a huff of annoyance. “I guess that means you’re not leaving,” he said quietly and irritably. Harry relaxed, finally letting himself believe that he was alive. He reached out and put a hand on his shoulder.
He looked over at Malfoy and realized with a jolt how easily he could have taken advantage of Harry’s unconsciousness. He still had Malfoy’s wand in his pocket; he could feel the weight of it against his leg. He frowned at him, wondering what had stopped Malfoy from taking back his wand. With Harry asleep, there was nothing keeping Malfoy safe from himself, and he knew that. So why did he stay?
When you read this, I will be gone. The world will be a better place.
Draco is panicking.
Harry says yes.
Draco cries at the sink. Myrtle tries to console him.
She invited him to Christmas dinner.
The words “already know what I’ve done”, “follow me into the abyss”, and “suicide” jumped out at him. Harry’s eyes widened and he hurriedly looked for the name at the bottom of the letter. “Draco Lucius Malfoy”.
Harry turned it over to see that it was not sealed, and warning signals went off in his head.
Also, Draco doesn’t want to die. He just wants the pain to end. That doesn’t mean he needs to die, and he’ll come to realize that soon.
Draco took a slow breath. “I feel…” He looked up at the clouds and felt the sun warming his face. He wanted to feel happy. He wanted to feel like he could do anything with his life. But instead all he felt was a heaviness that threatened to crush his lungs and an anger seeping deep into his stomach, rotting him slowly from inside.
Draco mulled this over for a moment or two, before saying, “Is it fulfilling?” As soon as the words left his lips, he realized how hopeless they sounded. Draco had never considered therapy as a career, but somehow the thought of doing anything for ten years and being happy with it seemed surreal to him. It was apparently one of those things Draco knew he could never have. His future was not bright.
As Harry walked over, he asked “George still at work?”
Draco considers what will happen if he finishes the vanishing cabinet.
She is uneasy, but she smiles.
. He remembered wanting to kill Bellatrix, wanting to kill the Malfoys, wanting to die rather than listen to Hermione’s pain. He remembered Luna steadying him, he remembered steadying Ron. He remembered escaping.
Draco crumples it up. Tosses it aside.
Angry, he kicks him. Better that he thinks the worst of him.
However, Draco supposed that Tara - a trained professional - was a bit better at reading him than most people, because then she said, “You don’t have to tell me everything, Draco, but putting up walls will only make your healing process take longer.”
Draco waits for the others to leave.
“Potter, you can’t expect me to overlook the violations of protocol you blatantly ignored in the past few hours. First, you showed up to a suspected crime scene while off-duty, barged in with no back-up or
And is bottling them. Of course.
Now, I know. There’s no point seeking help, at least not for me. It’s too hard to fight. Selfish is a gross misunderstanding. Selfless, more like. No one wants me here. My parents love me, but even they hate the man I’ve become. My friends only humor me with their company. Truth is, they probably will be relieved when they hear.
Harry runs into Draco outside the ministry afterward.
I apologize for the lateness of this chapter. This weekend has been crazy busy for me. I work two jobs and haven't had enough time to write and edit until pretty much yesterday. It also doesn't help that I had several different versions of what would happen at this point in the story in my head. I'm going to get a head start on the next few chapter so I can auto upload them on the days that they are scheduled for. Thanks again for your patience and I hope you all enjoy this story as much as I do.
Potter,
Draco and Harry can't resist arguing.
“Malfoy,” Contempt.
“I love you, Potter.”
They get very drunk.
Mother helps Draco pick out a ring.
***Content Warning***
Harry ran up to the door, blowing it off its hinges with a spell. He should have checked for wards first, but Harry didn’t care. He ran head-on into the giant mansion and started screaming, “Malfoy! MALFOY!”
Blaise laughs and nudges Draco. But Draco isn’t laughing.
Tara sat with him in silence for a short while, letting him absorb his emotions. When the shadows in the room told him the sun was setting, Tara calmly rose from her seat and told him it was time for supper.
Looking around, Harry saw Bill and Mr. Weasley talking in the doorway while Hermione and Percy argued amicably over a book in the next room. Charlie was still out of the country, but Harry knew they would see him towards the end of the month. It was harder for him to meet weekly, but he managed to come back to the Burrow for a day or two at the end of every month.
She continued to stare at the embers, tear-streaked cheeks glinting in the morning light coming through the window. She shook her head solemnly, then spoke again, “It’s not good.”
“Can I buy you a drink?” Draco is surprised.
After several hours of tossing and turning, Harry gave up on sleep and headed to the kitchen for a cup of tea. Kreacher had started the fireplace sometime during the night, so Harry sat in the warm living room as he waited for his tea to boil. Harry was still trying to convince Kreacher to accept clothes, but he refused to be ‘dismissed’, saying it was the highest dishonor one could be given as a house elf. So Harry set him up in one of the empty bedrooms and tried to make him feel more like a housemate than a servant. It was a work in progress.
Draco kisses back.
before remembering that she, too, was gone. With a sad huff, he sat up and looked out the window to see a large brown eagle owl sitting on the ledge outside. He got up, a bit bewildered, and opened the window to let him in. The owl did not come in, however, and simply held out the crumpled letter which he held tightly in one of his large talons.
Draco finds Potter in the owlery.

So Harry gathered his things and used the ministry lobby fireplaces to floo to the Burrow. Stepping out into the kitchen, Harry’s ears were immediately greeted by Mrs. Weasley’s pleased greeting.
I’m sure you are wondering why this letter is addressed to you. To be completely honest with you, I myself have no clue. Somehow yours is the only face I can imagine reading this note. So, here goes.
Harry testifies at Draco’s hearing.
Ron handed Harry one of the candies and started telling him how they worked. Meanwhile, Ginny made eye contact with Harry from across the kitchen and gave him a small grin. She was holding a stack of mismatched plates as Fleur was setting them out one by one on the large table. Harry grinned and gave her a small wave.
Harry kisses Draco’s lips.
“Just get OUT, Ron!” Her voice broke into a sob, and Harry’s heart clenched. Ron shut his eyes tightly and stood still for a moment. He turned back to the kitchen just a second before stomping away toward the front door. Harry watched him as he made to slam the door, then met Harry’s eyes and thought better of it. The quiet click of the door handle as he shut it was audible through the flat.
Draco’s nostrils flared and in his mind he was cursing Tara. It was none of her business what was going on inside his head. Outwardly, he shrugged and continued to quietly focus his eyesight on anything but his therapist. He hoped she would get bored and leave him the hell alone.
“I’m sorry about him. He has a hard time letting go.” She is sincere.
- oh, Hermione. He remembered listening to her screams, unable to help her, unable to take away her pain. He remembered the writing on her arm.

Harry stopped a few feet short and cleared his throat. “Malfoy,” he said again in a more demanding tone.

Draco met Tara’s eyes, which were filled with kindness and determination, and felt his throat tighten around his words. Sadly, he looked away, fixing his eyes on his hands again as they laid on his lap. He heard his hoarse voice as if it was coming from somewhere else as he answered, “I feel fine.”
Not everyone seems to agree.
They sit in class, several desks apart.
Draco is sitting outside in the snow with a bloody nose.
Harry kisses them both on the head.
Harry smiles. Leaves.
Potter leaves, nearly knocks him over.
This chapter contains suicidal ideation.
Their fingers brush.
I know it's a slow burn, but I plan on having Harry and Draco interact with each other again soon. Thanks to everyone who is still reading for your patience. <3
This chapter contains suicidal ideation.
Harry supposed it might get more exciting as he moved up the ladder towards Head Auror, but at the moment he was feeling relatively disappointed and a tinge frustrated as he irritably began the first report on the stack of paperwork. He worked until he felt a distinct pang of hunger as his stomach growled. He checked the clock on the wall to his right and saw that it was half past four o’clock. Harry eyed his pile. He was satisfied with having completed half of the stack, so he decided to take an early day.
“Can I sit down?” He said it so angrily and defensively, but Harry noted that his knees were shaking.
Now look how much good all that did me. You’re all war heros, even Hagrid. And me? I was on the side of those people who killed your parents and your friends. My classmates. I lost one of my best friends in the process. Of course it was his own fucking fault, but that’s not really the point is it?
Goodbye.
Harry saves him.
Beside him, Tara stretched her legs out in front of her and leaned back slightly. Draco looked at her and was surprised to see a small smile on her young face. She met his eyes but didn’t say anything, just hummed softly before looking away again. It struck Draco that even though Tara was his therapist, she was just as human as him. He found he suddenly felt a little less lonely.
Draco is invited to Weasley and Granger’s wedding.
I hope this chapter is okay. Due to my work schedule this weekend I may have some difficulty getting the next chapter out on Sunday, but I will do my very best. Thanks again to everyone for leaving comments and kudos! It means a lot to see that other people are enjoying this fic :)
For a while, I thought you knew and your actions toward me were your way of saying you were not interested. That fucking hurt. And maybe you did know. I prefer to think you were too oblivious to see how much I..
I’m not one for apologies, but I know that this is one of those things that you don’t just do without expressing your sorrow for the people who will grieve you. So please, Harry, tell my parents I am truly sorry. I am sorry that I failed them, and that I failed myself. Tell my friends I am sorry that I was not a better friend to them. Tell your friends I am sorry for everything I have ever done to them. I know they will not care; I don’t expect forgiveness. I only wish to express…
Harry sneaks into his compartment.
Draco struggles to get away.
“See you.” Harry hesitates. “Draco.”
When he made it to the Auror Department, he nodded his head in greeting to the few night-shift aurors who sat sleepily at their desks doing paperwork. There were seldom any calls at this hour, so most nights the Aurors’ hardest job was staying awake as they filed away reports. He walked up to Kingsley’s office and hesitated before knocking lightly on the closed door.
He was thanking her for the time in the forest.
Harry’s house is oddly cozy.
He wishes he was dead already.
“Watch it, Potter.” Spit flies off his lip.
The very first thing Harry heard when he stepped into Ron and Hermione’s flat was the sound of breaking glass and raised voices, and he immediately froze.
“Fuck off!” Potter runs away. But Draco heard the crack in his voice.
“Malfoy.” But the tone sounds more tired than angry.
“Come in,” he heard Kingsley say from inside, and Harry opened the door slowly. When Kingsley looked up at him from his desk, he motioned for Harry to sit in the chair opposite. Harry did so and met his furious eyes with a look of apology. He dared not speak until Kingsley said his piece.
“Scared, Malfoy?” Grins.

Ron and Hermione are not okay.
This chapter is regrettably very short but I currently can’t think of anything to add to it to beef it up. I have several days off work this week so here’s hoping I’ll have another chapter up soon.
But then Harry remembered the haunted look in Malfoy’s eyes every time Harry saw him during the war. He remembered the way he cowered during the battle at Hogwarts and the way he cried in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom in sixth year. Harry’s heart ached as his memories showed him all the times Malfoy had broken in front of him. Regret filled his chest. Harry covered his face with his pillow, as if his thoughts could be drowned out if he couldn’t see.
When the raven-haired man receives his tea from Draco he slurps it lewdly before letting out a contented groan. "I haven't had a cuppa this good in years."
Draco studies Potter and takes in the way he sniffs the fragrant beverage before taking a slow drink. He finds that dainty china contrasts wonderfully with Potter’s masculine, worn hands. He looks at his own hands, large but slim. Nimble and precise.
While Draco tries to remember how to breathe, in and out, he thinks, Potter meets his eyes briefly before gesturing with about as much disinterest in Draco as Waylon after he’s finished dinner to the package he’s holding. “Morning, you’ve got a package.”
The tea isn’t as appealing on Draco’s caught tongue. He’d been bold but he didn’t expect Potter to be so outright about it in return. “And you’re quite interested,” Draco reminds.
Draco stumbles a bit more and tries to pull his arm free when Potter doesn’t let go. If the git would just let him go he could fix himself a glass of water and grab a potion from the cabinet. “If you’d let go,” he takes a deep breath. “I’ll just make-“
He sits forward a little and angles his body toward the other man. “Why’d you quit?”
Draco racks his brain for a moment. The problem is the number of unsafe topics they could discuss while delving back into their offensive past far outweigh the safe topics. Potter is unsafe and everything about him that is related to Draco's life is absolutely unsafe.
Draco can't hold in the small snort that escapes his lips - maybe it's the wine because that sounds so much like something Potter would say and it's the first thing he's said that actually sounds like the Potter that Draco knew so well. The familiarity it brings is almost comforting.
“Would you believe me if I said my answer was the exact same?” The corner of Potter’s mouth ticks up a bit so Draco continues. “Didn’t think so,” his grimace is bittersweet. “I don’t think there was much left for me there. Not that I deserved to be granted forgiveness.” He pauses. “Believe me when I say that I know the things I did were atrocious and cowardly. I am so incredibly sorry and ashamed of who I was. But even my deepest apologies couldn’t atone or wager a better life for me. So, here I am. Hoping to make something of the rest of what’s left.”
Draco feels light as air.
Draco shakes his head. His friends had long since stopped coming to visit once they’d realized just how serious Draco was when he’d said he was quite finished with wizarding London. He suspects they thought it was just a phase. His parents, well, his mother, certainly had. If he’s being honest, and he is, he’s surprised really at how much he doesn’t miss the wizarding world. But what’s more pressing is Potter’s absence from it.
He placed his order earlier in the week in hopes of proving to Potter, though he’s got nothing to prove to anybody, that he isn’t actually completely pathetic as he’d appeared on their last run-in. The bottom line is, the last time Draco had really
“Thank you.” Draco sips his wine and places his hand on the table so their fingers brush. Potter stares at his hand for a long moment, his eyes going a bit wide before they meet Draco’s again. “Four times you’ve been to my house now. I had to express my appreciation for all your hard work in some way.” He removes his hand to pick up his fork again. The contact was minimal and fleeting, but there nevertheless.
doesn’t send a message...” His chuckle is warm as it vibrates through Potter and into Draco.
Every minute, day, week, and month that’s passed since Potter delivered his first package has come down to this finite moment where all Draco can see is the man in front of him willing and waiting, lips parted and breath ghosting over his chin as Potter leans forward still. He watches Potter’s eyes flutter closed. His heart is working overtime in his chest,
He looks up, sees Harry in the mirror. Fear.
The next thing he saw was the front of Malfoy Manor, looming above him like a dark fortress.

Draco and Harry go together.
Even writing this is taking me days at a time. I have so little energy left.
“Have you made any attempts to self harm or end your life?” Kingsley’s deep voice continued without emotion.
Kingsley began asking him questions and casting charms on him to check for injuries and curses and all that sort of thing. Harry didn’t pay much attention until Kingsley said, “Are you experiencing suicidal thoughts?”
Harry holds him tight.
“I’m getting the feeling that you have closed yourself off from our conversation,” Tara said softly from the other side of the table.
(("I'll keep all my emotions right here, and then one day, I'll die."))
Malfoy sat up and turned in his chair to face Harry. A pained look in his eyes, he studied Harry for a long time, before slowly putting his wand into Harry’s outstretched hand. Once Harry pocketed it, he saw Malfoy’s eyes close tight and his shoulder relaxed as he let out a deep breath.
Harry licks a stripe up leaving a wet patch before hooking his thumbs in the waistband and tugging them down. “I’m going to suck you now.”
The laugh that fills the room in response is one Draco has missed dearly, warm and deep.
“Especially in the Ministry. Too many people unwilling to move on, unwilling to forgive.” Potter sighs. “Justice doesn’t play favorites. At least not for me.”
Harry seems to get the idea rather quickly, using his elbows to brace himself on either side of Draco’s head. He lines his prick up with Draco’s, gently nudging them together. They both groan at the first contact. Draco feels fireworks set off in his body as the other man begins to rock into him, the hard lines of his body connecting deliciously with his own.
Soon enough they detangle themselves and all it takes is one grimace at the sticky mess on his stomach before it’s suddenly whisked away by the cool tingle of a cleaning charm.
Draco smiles softly as he watches Harry cross the threshold, jog down his three front steps, and bounce into the truck. Walking to his desk, a winding Waylon between his legs, he picks his quill up because he’s got a few more things to say.
The gears turn in Draco's head. “But how on earth did that equivocate you becoming my postman?”
Draco’s heart plummets because he can
"Books," Draco says cooly. The kettle finally does squeal then and Draco is saved from elaboration to prepare their hot drinks. He makes Potter's tea the way he'd seen Potter make it at Hogwarts many years ago. A splash of milk and just enough sugar to rot one's teeth out. Whoever thought all his years of watching, envying, the man from afar would pay off?
“To be fair,” Potter smirks, voice low yet playful still. “I wasn’t expecting this.”
the threshold of how happy you actually could be.”
“You thought I…” Potter begins and if Draco has to hear Potter repeat the mortifying explanation again he thinks he might hurl.
The slight frown is wiped from Potter's face when Waylon bounces onto his lap and he has to raise his teacup in the air to keep it from spilling over. "Watch that, or you'll end up wearing English breakfast," he coos to the cat.
Draco pens the last of his third novel with a trembling hand and frown on his face.
“Hello,” Draco croaks, his voice hoarse.
of the other man. It’s just, well they hadn’t gotten to know each other very much had they? And Potter was always whisked back to work before Draco could even offer him biscuits for his tea like a proper host. Taking Potter out would surely secure Draco a more sturdy timeframe with the delivery truck not right outside his door waiting for Potter to make his escape.
Waylon chirrups in what he can only assume is agreement.
“You don’t need to apologize to me about that,” Potter says sternly, his thighs tensing under Draco’s head.
When Draco wakes up, he immediately becomes aware of two things. The first is that he’s in a different position than he was when he fell asleep. He’s currently on his back, vaulted ceiling above him, and incredibly warm. The second is that Harry Potter is also above him, square jaw facing forward, stubble littering his chin, and deliberately not making eye contact with Draco.
“There’s always more to know,” he pauses. “I haven’t really left it behind, anyway,” Potter says, his eyes somewhere to the right of Draco’s head. “At least not where it’s important. I guess I wanted more, but not of what they had to offer. Part of me felt like staying where I was and following the path everyone thought I would was the exact opposite of creating more for myself.” He chuckles humorlessly. “I was so
Waylon resumes his usual spot atop Draco’s desk. Yellow eyes flick curiously after his quillstrokes.
Potter settles back into the cushions now. He stares contemplatively at Draco for a long moment and something gives. Draco isn’t sure what until Potter speaks again.“No actually, I used to be an Auror. Mostly low profile undercover work.” Something passes over Potter’s face and Draco watches his whole body tense into a grimace. “I quit after two years.”
for what feels like the millionth time now when a soft voice pierces his concentration. When he jumps he snaps his quill right in two. “Fuck.”
Potter is taken aback. Draco sees right away confusion etch itself into Potter's features, his eyes growing comically wide. If this wasn't so absurd Draco might laugh and then hex his own mouth shut for lack of control over it. Potter stands back up straight now to gaze at Draco levelly. Draco supposes it isn't every day that homeowners on Potter's mail route ask him in.
Draco extends his own hand. He grips Potter’s hand gently in his own, warm and strong. “Likewise.”
Draco mimics his movements, resting against the table and invading Potters personal space as he leans in close. “Hopefully I can keep proving that to you,” a soft smile tugs at his lips.
He’s pouring milk in his cup when he hears it.
“And now I’m feeling much braver,” the corner of his mouth raises in the beautiful way it’s always done.
He tells himself that pursuing anything further with the risk of ending their friendship is just something he’s not willing to do. Even when his thoughts slip to freckles, messy hair, and a pert arse as he pulls himself off. Even when he imagines a warm body beside him before drifting into a restless sleep. Even when the home Draco has made for himself starts to feel large and lonely.
Horror is clear in Draco’s voice when he asks, “You were stalking me? Again?”
With about as much elegance as a fish out of water, Draco snaps his mouth shut with a click before nodding with too much enthusiasm and not enough composure. They stand there looking at each other long enough for Draco to see that no, he isn't crazy and yes, Harry Potter is standing on his doorstep waiting for him to take his newly ordered desk lamp. Shoving his arms forward with as much indifference as he can possibly muster, Draco accepts the package.
Harry’s dark skin looks contrastingly pale as he regards Draco. “Okay,” he says softly. “Why don’t you have a seat?” Draco sits on the opposite side of the sofa, where he and Harry began all of this. “First, I wanted to apologize.”
“Would you like to come in?” Draco blurts, desperate to ask the questions swirling in his head he’s been raised to politely ignore. “Tea’s on.”
“I need to leave,” Potter says, backing up against Draco’s door like the blond has put him there. “You have to let me go. I’ll-”
He’s approaching the end of a paragraph when he tells himself
“Whatever for?”
The corner of Potter’s mouth lifts more and Draco’s palms become slick. This close, Draco can see faint laugh lines begin to crinkle in. He thinks they’re beautiful. He takes a step forward without even thinking about it and they’re
Potter had been one of the lowest times in Draco’s life and he wants to show Potter that he’s doing better.
“And how could you?” Harry asks. “I never told you the truth about why I left.”
“I’m sorry if I made you upset.”
“Of course, forgive-”
The man turns and Draco has to think quickly before the man notices Draco’s jaw on his fucking doorstep because standing right in front of him holding a small package with the words
"No," Potter allows. "However, three within two months, when you've never ordered anything prior, seems - suspicious."
It doesn’t take long for Draco’s body to be yanked directly to the edge of his orgasm, and all it takes is for Harry to whisper Draco’s name into his neck as his pace becomes sloppy to send him over the edge. He comes in white spurts over his stomach. A deep moan vibrates through him and he clutches onto Harry as his orgasm wrecks him. The wetness of his cum further slickens the space between them and soon enough Harry’s sloppy ruts become even more so before his thighs are trembling and he’s shooting his release, groaning into Draco’s neck.
Draco’s cheeks flame momentarily before he pulls himself together and gestures to Potter’s clothes before he turns his nose up slightly. “Well, it’s hardly the middle of summer and you’ve got no coat,” he points out. When Potter narrows his eyebrows at him Draco tries again, lowering his chin so that he doesn’t look like
“I’m serious,” Potter insists. “There’s nothing so important that you put it before your own health and happiness, trust me. I know.” Draco regards the depth of Potter’s green irises as they stare unwavering into Draco’s.
“Why are you still here?” Vulnerability is thick in his voice, almost childlike, even as the small smile remains unwavered by the butterflies in his stomach. It’s so unlike him but he needs to know. He needs to know where Potter stands, how he feels about what Draco’s just said. “The truth.”
Potter turns and quirks his thick eyebrows at Draco. “Bye,” he waves awkwardly before gripping the rail on the side of his truck and trapezing in. He’s down the street before Draco can recover.
He takes in his surroundings. He’s currently lying halfway across his sofa and halfway across Potter, his shoulders, neck, and head resting on the other man’s lap, Waylon sprawled across the length of his own legs. The blond starts again, “Sorry. I’ll just-”
He nods slowly, thinking of how best to word the swirling thoughts in his head. “Have you ever had this idea of how your life was supposed to go,” he begins, lacing his fingers together on his chest. “You had this plan of how everything will be. What you’d do. Who would be in it.”
“Draco,” Potter whispers again, breathier this time with a touch of heat. Draco knows, he
Potter’s eyes widen. “Forgive me but you look terrible.”
asked Potter into his private space besides the incessant need to know just what the hell is going on with Potter and why on earth he’s even delivering packages on Draco’s street. And it is only polite to interrogate a fellow bloke when his bollocks aren’t turning into ice chandeliers in his pants.
He then moved to vanish the silk bindings, one by one, and gently lowered each of Harry’s twitching limbs back onto the bed, massaging the strained muscles with firm fingers. He continued to whisper soft praise while he worked, inspecting Harry’s wrists a bit closer to ensure he hadn’t hurt himself.
“Never the matter,” Draco attempts to smooth himself. He draws his tone so that it is one of complete indifference and conceals the utter embarrassment that he’s feeling because
When he reaches the door, he pulls it open slowly using his lower half to keep Waylon at bay as he sticks his upper half out. There, standing on his doorstep is Harry, dressed in a hooded jumper and jeans. He’s got his hands shoved way too far into his pockets; his feet shuffle nervously, left right, left right.
Its sometime late in the evening when Harry leaves. Draco kisses him back when Harry leans on his toes to reach him, loving the way the other man leans into him and knowing he will miss everything about it until he sees Harry again.
“What?” Draco blurts because that is absolutely the last thing he was expecting.
Embarrassment marks Potter with a pretty rose blush across his cheeks and Draco’s heart stutters in his chest. “You don’t have to apologize to me. I get it.” And Draco does. He gets it so much so that Draco believes this is the closest he and Potter will ever come to being one and the same on any matter. This is one thing he’d never argue with the green-eyed wizard about because he too values his freedom from the wizarding world like it’s his prized possession. He loves his life, his quaint little home, his drowsy neighborhood, his career, his cat. “I understand the need for a certain level of privacy,” he reassures Potter and drops his hold on the man’s neck. “I’m not too keen to reopen the door to that world either.”
. "I'm sure I'll be in need of something else delivered. Perhaps then." And with that, Draco scoops Waylon up as he meows loudly in irritation, digging his nails painfully into Draco's shoulder where he's been slung and turns on his heels so fast his head spins. He slams the door behind him and leans against it breathing heavily. He looks a mess really. He's got tea sloshed over his right hand - dripping - where he spun too quickly, a package clutched to his hip, an and angry cat mewling unhappily atop his shoulder. His breaths come out in annoyed huffs at his own brashness.
That’s when it clicks.
Potter’s eyes roam around Draco’s living room as he answers the question and somehow Draco isn’t quite convinced that this isn’t an investigation. “Few years, two or three? You?”
underestimated just how sexy Potter would sound when he said his name through heavy breaths. How it would sound when Potter finally said his name. He knows Potter must be able to feel his arousal pressing against his thighs, but they way Potter returns his feverish kisses washes away any embarrassment he might feel otherwise.
“Forget to eat,” Potter explains. “Forget to
Draco is thankful that his manuscripts hide in his office because he's just realized that he hasn't decided just how much he wants to share with Potter. See, in his head, he'd never thought he'd get quite this far. But now that the kettle is just about to squeal Draco feels as though he's about to as well just out of his own sheer idiocy. Really, did he expect to pry information from Potter without sharing a bit of his own?
done. One romantic, heart-shattering installment left to submit before his novel series is complete. Waylon leaps from the desk as soon as he hears the offensive ring of the doorbell followed right after the knock, sloshing cool, forgotten tea all over his parchment. Draco rolls his eyes as tea blends the words
“So tell me.”
“And then you realize that you were completely wrong, not only once but twice,” Draco continues all the while looking up at Potter. “You think you had it all figured out and tell yourself that all that you have is good enough and that you’re happy but then,” he sucks in a breath, his momentum ramping up with every word because he simply
“Maybe not an utter barbarian like yourself,” Draco sniffs. He’s offended, deeply so because Potter’s just criticized his livelihood, but he’s also a little intrigued because the way Potter’s eyes roam his face, eyes, lips, and back in quick succession is just doing it for him.
Draco asks the question he already knows the answer to. “In the Ministry?”
Potter takes another step forward, almost challengingly so, the tip of his chin up defiantly at Draco and thick eyebrows narrowed. “Well, you certainly don’t talk to
Every minute that Draco spends with Potter feels like another nail in the coffin because Draco is absolutely
“Wait,” Draco blurts into the quiet night. A soft breeze ruffles Potter’s hair when he turns. He raises an eyebrow. “Have dinner with me.”
“So, what do you do for a living?” Potter raises a hand when Draco goes to say he’s already answered that question. “And just saying ‘write books’ doesn’t count.”
“Until next delivery,” Potter laughs with a nod.
“How do you do that?” Harry asks, his voice next to Draco’s ear.
The hand that is resting beside Draco’s head after just flicking him moments ago slowly moves. He can hear to the soft tug of denim as Potter slides it closer to Draco’s head. Potter’s still looking down at him when Draco feels the gentle slide of fingers through his hair and along his scalp. His heartbeat doubles its pace in his chest but even that can’t stop his eyes from fluttering shut as Potter moves his fingers through Draco’s strands. “Is this okay?”
happen he couldn’t deny the way their current encounter has settled them gently back into the throes of their long written incompatibility. They just can’t get on. They just can’t.
, teasing smile when Draco answers the door.
The tension in the air grows too thick and Draco can almost see Potter trying to string together a proper response. “You’re very vague,” he settles with a sigh.
Draco is startled by the protesting heave of an engine starting up just outside his house. Daring to peek out the curtains of his foyer he sees Potter’s delivery truck winding once again down his street before coming to the halting realization that: Potter was there the whole time.
