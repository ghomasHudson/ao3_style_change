Draco throbbed. With every pulse of his rapidly beating heart, his hot and aching cock grew longer and thicker between his thighs. His pheromones rose, wafting in the air. He felt heavy in the air, hot and pungent like the black smoke of a fueled fire.
Once Hari left with Draco, Narcissa entered the room. “Minerva always said they were the worst kind of Muggles imaginable.” Andromeda told her sister. Narcissa stood with one hand over her mouth and tears glistening in her eyes. Even with being the Chosen One, Narcissa never knew the extent of the abuse that Hari had gone through in his life.
"I never had to before now. It isn't exactly legal to reveal our kind to Muggles." Cho said wringing her hands.
Hari mimicking the baby’s position, gently encouraged Teddy to go on. Slightly confused and in awe of the sigh, he watched from his position just inside the door.
With a red hair whip, the song was over and the crowd was still cheering. The song was really catchy and he knew if he didn't catch himself, he'd find himself humming the lyrics to himself later.
“No! Hari, please!” Draco nearly cried as he hunched his back in order to rest his forehead against Hari’s back.
Andromeda reached around Harry's shoulders, noticing him stiffen in her grasp, pull him closer and place a kiss at the top of his temple. Hugging him briefly, chin on his head, and hummed soothingly, trying to calm his nerves like she would her own child or grandson or distressed omega. "You can do that once we have packed up here and settle in Grimmmmm-hch. huh?" Clearing her throat she tried again, "Grimmmollowowow, what?"
Draco sputtered as Hari laughed. It was short lived as a ripping noise sounded. There was a breath of silence and a shout of pain from Hari.
A tall imposing black figure emerged to stand guard at the entrance with a sign over head that simply read, Sheryl’s Place. The street was clean, the windows shined, and the food smelled delicious. Draco was taller than he was before he came into his dragon inheritance, but the person guarding the door was a head taller than he, and had about a hundred pounds on him. His human self might have been intimidated by the bulk and even the cleaver in hand, but his alpha just snorted
with each advance you make towards him, or he you. He is not aware of the fact, and you have not told him.” Narcissa said with eyebrow raised as if implying that Hari’s ignorance of wizarding ways was somehow his fault.
“No…” Andromeda remarked with another titter. “They’re just being boys. But they really ought to come inside now that the sun has set. Summer ailment is not so fun.”
"Winston, thank goodness. This boy hear was trying to harass us. He has a camera and was taking pictures." Draco honest to God simpered.
Then something scary happened. Harry's Nimbus started bucking out of control. Someone had bewitched his broom. It shouldn't have been possible, it had anti-jinx charms on it. It was in the brochures and the latest edition of Quidditch Through the Ages. But someone clearly had done it. A Slytherin? No it couldn't possibly have been a student. I searched the stands. My father perhaps. It had to be an adult witch or wizard. I looked for my father, but no he wasn't even staring at Harry, he had a steely eyed stare on me. I looked away as fast as possible. Back to the Quidditch pitch, to see Harry get bucked off his broom.
"Hey, Hari!" Draco said as he cuddled into Hari's chest on the floor. "You know I love you right? cuz, I don't think you do." He looked up at Hari with drunken giddiness. "You don't see yourself as I do, Hari. Your brave and loyal, instinctive and resourceful, sassy and witty, compassionate and selfless, and bloody gorgeous. Those are all the things I love about you."
“…That’s what you meant when you said not good enough…Draco,” Hari let out a bark of laughter. “I’m not that great a catch, alright.” Draco looked at Hari and snorted.
Draco Malfoy wore all black as he stood by his mother's side. His dressrobes were custom tailored to fit his tall, slim and lithe frame to perfectly accent his broad shoulders and tapered waist. His back was iron straight and his shoulders stiff. His pale complexion stood out in stark contrast from his all black attire, from his white blonde hair, moon-glow skin, and stormy gray eyes.
Without stopping to analyses the situation the two jumped up in haste, fearing the worse for the boys that were expected home any moment. The two sisters rushed through the Floo, library, and study to peer outside the terrace patio. They gasped at the sight before them.
Andromeda evidently felt her sister’s sentiment exactly and replied, “But surely…in a magical household such as this. With the wards in place…underage magic would be near impossible to trace with so many adults present. I taught Nymphadora lots of beginning spells before Hogwarts. I, at least taught her magical theory. It’s an advantage magical families have over Muggle-borns. It’s only enforced when in the Muggle world, to protect the Statute of Secrecy.” Andromeda said shocked.
Hari continued oblivious to the silent cry in Draco’s heart. “When I look at you, I see that same struggle within you to survive. We just went about pursuing it differently. I wanted to live, you wanted to not die.” Draco didn’t see the difference at first, but then suddenly he did. Hari said so himself, he
"You called me your family?" Draco asked a little in wonder, then frowned. "Wait this isn't like some brother thing, because I love you Potter and it isn't brotherly in the slightest. Besides, we're Blacks and we blur the lines on incest relationships..." Hari covered Draco's quite sleepy babbling rant with his palm.
Hari nodded at her question, not realizing he was already agreeing to their party plans as it was. But then a thought struck him.
Draco Malfoy once admired everything about his father. He envied the power and influence his father had in the all circles of wizarding society, in the Ministry of Magic, the Wizengamot, pure-blood circles, and in the Dark Market. His father always taught him, he was better than everyone else; he was a wizard and better than muggles, he was a pure-blood, which accounted for his prestigious breeding, and he was rich, which sure as hell was better than being poor. He was taught that anyone who wasn’t like him was less and he couldn’t associate with any of them, pre-Hogwarts days. This was why his father wanted him to enroll in Durmstrang Institute of Magical Learning, only rich Pure-bloods were permitted to attend, he would have continued to learn the Dark Arts unimpeded, and he would not be forced to associate with anyone his father didn’t approve of.
He didn’t want to befriend Muggles or Circe, forgive them all, marry one, just observe and form his own ideas without the influence of his parents and friends. Also something not Slytherin of him to think. But, together with his five friends, they came up with the scheme to see for themselves.
The second time was when Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and I were captured by Snatchers and sent to Malfoy Manor to get questioned and turned over to Voldemort. Draco Malfoy was forced to remain in his family home instead of returning to school for his Seventh term at Hogwarts. There he was asked to reveal my identity so that Bellatrix Lestrange could summon Voldemort to the Manor. He chose not to do so, but Bellatrix did not believe him and summoned her master anyway. We fought to escape the Manor and I was able to disarm Malfoy and his mother, taking their wands and leaving the three Malfoy's defenseless against Voldemort's wrath. I watched through our connection as the three of them were tortured for not being able to keep me prisoner, the Cruciatus Curse was used on the three of them.
The reasons for my absence is life keeps getting in the way. I work during the days, come home to take care of my family, and if I am not too tired once everyone is in bed, I write.
Keeping the relatively gentle silence, Hari kissed Draco’s lips softly. He responded against his lips. “It was unexpectedly tiring.”
If he had accepted his fate and boarded the train to move on, he would have never had the chance to be with Teddy. He would have never had the opportunity to testify for the Malfoys and give them a second chance.
How could one moment, one decision, one action define a person's whole life, or end it? How different were their lives from my own? I spent over a year trying to get inside the mind of a madman, trying understand him in order to kill him. I couldn't help but think that our lives were so similar and yet our actions, thoughts, and our choices were so different. How did we end up choosing the sides we did? What circumstances brought us to that moment in time, where we faced off as enemies instead of standing as allies. My mother sacrificed her life in saving mine. I remain alive today, to write this letter, because of another mother who chose to go against her own believes in order to save her son, and in doing so, saved my life as well. I owe her a life debt, but she also deserves a second chance. Not everyone deserves them, and some receive too many only to squander them.
"That's Terry. She's barely 20," Emmet returned with drinks and appetizers. "And is currently doing hormones therapy to keep her testosterone levels low. She hasn't been coming lately. I think they make her sick while her body is adjusting."
“Let’s not fight you two. Bill, this is his home. He has every right to be here.” Hari had to defuse this situation fast. He loved his surrogate family with the Weasley’s, but they all despised the Malfoy’s. They wouldn’t understand hearing it from Bill first. His girlfriend Ginny had a very similar temper to her brother and his best mate, Ron and both of them hated Draco Malfoy. They would be furious to find out that Hari is living with him. This is why he hadn’t told them yet. If Bill stormed off before Hari could tell his side of the story, and went straight to his family, he might lose the entire family forever.
Before the Winter holidays, Malfoy purchased a dark artifact, and used the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell to compel her to deliver a cursed necklace to Dumbledore. In doing so, Katie Bell accidently grazed the dark artifact with her bare hand, and went into a coma. She almost died and was not able resume classes for the rest of the term. Before Valentines Day, he then poisoned spiced mead that was meant as a gift for Dumbledore, but he put his trust in the delivery of the poisoned mead in the hands of Professor Horace Slughorn, whom either by design or absent mindedness forgot to deliver the gift. Instead, he allowed a very good friend of mine, Ronald Weasley to sample the mead and was subsequently poisoned. If we were not in the Professor's office at the time, and I had not remembered that Professor Snape had once told the class that a Bezoar would cure most poisons, he would likely be dead.
Harry Potter, tomorrow we part for a month. I hope in this time that you are treated kindly and fair.
"I forgive you." Harry didn't need to be forgiven, he did nothing that needed to be forgiven. Her daughter, son-in-law, and everyone else who died in the war, died not because of him or for him. Their lives and deaths were out of his control. But he needed to hear this. To know that he was not being blamed for the deaths of her own loved ones. The Savior needed to be saved, not from the monster of everyone's nightmares for the last few decades, but from his own personal demons. "I forgive you." She said again and hoped that by breaking down this one barrier, he would soon forgive himself.
“Not a problem, Potter.” Draco spat out, not wanting to reveal how close he came to losing control in there. “Honestly, how could you freeze up like that? Destroyer of the Greatest Dark Lord of all time, the wizarding world’s savior…ha!”
The snake peered at Harry intensely, before opening its mouth, in what Harry thought was going to be a hiss.
Sheryl cleared her throat. "Actually recently we have changed our relationship. We moved in together in January. We rang the New Year together."
“Asssclepiusss, what isss Massstersss name?” the snake inquired with a hiss and inquiring flick of its forked tongue and Harry realized he was speaking parseltongue.
As they walked closer to the desired location to meet, Hari became more jittery. Draco had a hunch that Hari might accidently on purpose fire a curse at his friend upon arrival.
“It sounds to me like you wanted him to notice you as much as you noticed him.” Narcissa told her son. Draco grumbled something under his breath. “What was that?”
The flames from the fireplace disappeared, but the green flame on the candle remained. Hari’s jaw dropped, but the others were unsurprised.
Draco had long since left Hari to potter around in the gardens alone, electing to take a hot soak in the tub and rinse his hair before the mud dried. Hari only gave a little shrug.  Hari couldn’t really fault Draco his vanity. Draco was used to a certain standard of living, having grown up pampered with the finer things of life. He knew Grimmauld Place was not as grand as the family Manor, and surprisingly Draco didn’t complain, much. Oh, he was still a snob. That Hari knew. But Hari also knew that Draco was trying to curve his ways. So, Hari curved his tongue in turn, and didn’t make the scathing retort he wanted to about his daily grooming ritual.
"Oh that's interesting, did you know the Potter's had the antlers of a stag at the top of their family crest?" Andromeda questioned Harry.
A hand on his shoulder brought him out of his living nightmare, instead of looking up into inhuman red eyes and pallor skin, he looked down into brilliant green eyes in a face of tanned skin.
Snarling Draco managed to bring one of Potter's legs up over his shoulder and head, to position him on all fours, Potter aiding this desired position by trying to get away, inching forward on bound wrists and shaking knees. Draco landed the rest of his weight onto Potter’s back, grappling with him, trying to gain purchase on wet skin, before finally grabbing onto his narrow hips, and slamming balls deep into him. Holding Potter up barely by his hips, Draco began to ruthlessly thrust into Potter’s tight hole, angling for Potter’s sweet spot, his prostate with every thrust.
The peace was suddenly broken by a loud crash from the next room, then the unmistakable sound of her six year old son's sobbing.
Blushing pink to his ears, Draco forces his dragon to recede beneath the surface. "Not entirely, no. It's a battle between my dragons instincts versus my human intellect and because I am still juvenile, or recently presented as an alpha, they are hard to resist."
Draco halted and took Hari's shoulders in hand, looking steadily into his boyfriend's eyes. "Blaise is my friend, Hari. He is not going to hurt me."
"He hit me in public, not hard mind, not in public...never in public." He whispered taking another swing of firewhiskey.
He tried to convince himself that was because of the shock of having Hari bloody Potter walking in on him bathing.
Chaos and mayhem ensured. While the rest of the occupants ran away in fear, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon ran towards the glass that their son had fallen into. When Dudley stood up, undoubtedly shaken, he discovered that the glass had appeared again. He began to scream, his muffled shouts enunciated with vibration against the glass and the sound of his fists pounding against reinforced glass.
Walking over to the piano, Harry sat down in the center of the duet bench, positioning his hand in resting position over the middle C note. He slowly worked his fingers over the scales, working his way up each octave, limbering his fingers in a well-practiced warm up. It wasn’t like he wanted to tell Hermione and Ron that he actually knew a bit about the piano, it never came up before that autumn, and when Hermione did a piss poor job of teaching Ron, he was preoccupied searching Sirius’s and Regulus’s rooms, and finding out who R.A.B. actually was.
Edit 1/10. I was hoping to have chapter 16 up by today, well technically it's after midnight, so it's the eleventh. I'm not satisficed with a certain encounter in chapter 16 and I am working out the kinks right now. I'm over 8k words and it looks likely to be 9k minimum.
When Harry awoke sometime later, the sun was setting, and a breeze was ruffling the dust and Doxy-free curtains. Harry slowly stood up, looking around him. He could hear the sounds of birdsong over the sounds of normal day-to -day activities of Muggles returning home from work or going about their business.
Draco shivered as he approached Hari. He glanced up at the sky. Clouds were coming in. Not surprising really for London weather, but he was enjoying the fair weather. Now it looked like rain.
On the fourth floor landing was Draco's room, whose room use to belong to Sirius. Hari of course vanished all the nude muggle posters of biker chicks, and charmed the room a different color. He didn't think that Draco would appreciate the Gryffindor colors of gold and scarlet. Although, he did think it would be funny to see Draco's reaction if he had left it exactly how Sirius did. In fact, Hari contemplated taking that room as his own, but it just made him depressed, besides he didn't mind taking the slightly smaller room that use to be Regulus's room. They would of course have to manage sharing the same bathroom, together.
His ears pricked up at that. The Dudley's never elected to take him anywhere, let alone to the zoo on Dudley's birthday.
Additional security measures were put in place at the beginning of the Second Wizarding War when it became Headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, by Albus Dumbledore.
A familiar screech drew Draco's eyes to the rafters of sort, where a brook stick (not a racing broom) held open a window. A great white Snowy owl with amber eyes and black specks on its wings stared down at the two wizards. It hooted twice before tucking its head under a bandaged wing to sleep.
Brain backtracking, he tried instead. “So shopping…we could go…” Hari once again drew a blank. He had no idea where to go shopping that would suit Draco’s tastes. Shit.  Hari sighed, rubbing his brow. He really was mucking this all up. He hadn’t any experience with high end shops, or shopping at all, really.
Warnings: Graphic Description of Child Abuse and Neglect. Skip to the second break if you do not want to read. I will give you a short summary in the end note.
The sudden loudness of the exclamation caused Draco to flinch and drop his hand. He took a step back with a jerky nod of his head.
He fingered the cloak feeling the silky texture. It also didn't have a trace of magic, ruins sewn into the fabric, nor celtic knots in the lining. It was also said that a person couldn't survive the Killing Curse, here was the one exception. Is that how he survived, he hunted down the Hallows and became “the Master of Death.” Draco didn’t realize he had spoken out loud until Hari spoke up pleadingly.
The current bane of Hari's existence was a haphazard pile on his bed made up of the meager contents of his wardrobe. He gave the pile his best withering glare, trying to mimic the disdainful sneer that Draco would likely make if he ever saw such lousy excuses for clothes. Which…he would probably have to, since Harry wanted to look nice for Draco on their date, and these were all his clothes.  Why then, could he find nothing to wear?
"Not in front of my mother, or aunt." Is all Draco said gruffly, secretly thrilled that Hari wanted to address him by his first name at all, let alone giving him a nickname. "Don't you dare call me anything demeaning like, Draky-pooh, or any such nonsense, or I'll push you down the stairs."
“Hari, will you ride with me?” Draco asked as he held up the Nimbus 2001 in invitation. Hari only hesitated for a moment, he looked with longing on the black handled broomstick. He loved flying and missed his own firebolt terribly.
Sheryl only laughed at that. “Forgive me for my French not being my native language. I grew up in Louisiana and most of my education was thought on the knee of my mother, who spoke only creole French. I have sought to improve my speech ever since coming here."
Draco roared outrageously with laughter. Hari snickered after a moment of stunned surprise, and Teddy squealed in delight, his Hair turning a bright gumball pink.
"I had a lot to be afraid of, Potter. He lived in my home for three years. I've seen so many unthinkable things. He...he, made me do unthinkable things, alright. Things that I am rightly, ashamed of." Draco shivered and unconsciously was gripping the scars of the Dark Mark on his forearm. "So let's drop the subject for now...please?" The last part costing him greatly. It wasn't often he found himself begging for things.
I thought maybe, you’d be willing to take her on. I know you probably haven’t gotten over the death of Hedwig, but she needs a good home and I couldn’t entrust her in more of a loving friend. Consider her an early birthday present and I won’t take no for an answer. She’s a two year old eastern grass owl. See the color on the face, males don’t have this. Her name is Eliana.
When they cleared the alley, Hari let the motorbike rev, enjoying Draco tightening his grip around his middle and sped on their way. The ride was short, probably could have walked the distance in quarter an hour or less, but nevertheless fast and exhilarating all the time. Draco was thoroughly lost, but Hari seemed to know where he was going.
The end of July couldn’t come soon enough. It was still June. Closing his eyes against the temptation, he refused to release Hari from what was demanded of him. Finally Draco was brought back to the ever real present by the low hissing of Parseltongue, and Hari’s stiffened posture.
pink-red blooms. The tall willowy blonde in powder blue dress robes looked around in awe at the magical garden that appeared out of nowhere from a back alley in London. She said something over her shoulder, presumably to her son, Draco who still stood out of sight, but the wind caught the words and blew them out of Harry's ear shot. She gathered a bunch of fabric to step over a circular ledge onto the gravel pathway when she saw Harry sitting in the grass.
"No!" Hari shouted. "er...I mean. No, this isn't our first date. We went shopping together and Draco introduced me to gelato." Hari amended.
A clattering in the back of wheels rolling over tile caught their attention. Arlys was back with the costumes it seemed.
“I’ve got to get you to do something about your hair. Maybe I’ll let you use some of my potions.” He yawned, “anyway, let's take a nap.” He glanced down at Hari once more to see his eyes closed and softly breathing. Glancing at Teddy he saw the baby in the same state, his hair a light blue color. The eyebrows faint as they were just tinted blue as well.
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
"You may do that yes, it is a simple thing to do, to draw up a contract, which is why Mrs. Weasley is here to go over those documents." Fleur stepped forward and handed Harry a piece of parchment, quill and ink.
Hari looked at Draco in consideration, then out at the garden, one hand wrapped around his elbow in a hug, the other letting go of the handlebar to dangle at his side.
Hari too embarrassed over his admission didn’t look up, seeing the looks being exchanged around him.  “Yes. One moment he was a four-legged magical beast surrounded by stars and the next he was his usual pointy self.”
Narcissa hummed in contemplation. “Hari Potter is one of the most eligible bachelors of your generation; he is young, wealthy, powerful, influential, good looking,” she said with a chuckle, “and famous. He is the Boy-Who-Lived, after all. For most, these are all one needs to be considered a good match.”
Severus Snape looked up over a hooked nose with black expressionless eyes. "Minerva." He said in his smooth voice.
Fear not, I am not abandoning this works. If my readers go back and reread this story, you'll find I've made small changes here and there, added some links to my imgur.
When his job was to protect and serve and then forced to treat the homeless like criminals, when most just fell on hard times to the housing crisis, losing their jobs and families. Most were actually retired vets, who couldn't deal with civilian life after the trauma they witnessed in the wars they served. Our government, not doing a good enough job with mental health services for the honoured veterans.
Hari said on a happy sniffle, "Alright, Padfoot, alright!" And forgetting Draco's existence entirely for the moment, nearly danced up the stairs to his room to have a quiet conversation with his godfather, whom he hasn't seen or heard since his death three years past.
I am worried about Harry, again. He has some kind of migraine. He won't go to Madam Pomfrey. End of the year exams are in progress. Maybe he is not use to all the stress. I hope he takes a potion to make him feel better soon.
Draco really didn't want to be too close in case he couldn't control his alpha, but his alpha was absolutely delighted to be as close as possible to Hari without triggering Ice-blood. Frustrated beyond belief and just wanting to lock himself away in his room, he demanded a little harsher than intended. "Why do I have to sleep on the same floor as you, Potter?"
Draco snorted out a startled laugh. There may have been a snot bubble, but Draco would never admit that.
The house-elves, ever loyal to the House of Black, followed Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco’s orders, they belonging to the Black bloodlines, but deferred to Hari as head of the household.  As the Scion of two Noble and Ancient Houses, the house-elves wanted to call Hari, Master Potter-Black, but in a compromised, only called him Master Hari. The ladies in residence saw nothing amiss at having their titles being hyphened with their maiden name. They were tickled pink the first time the house elves used them. Draco couldn’t care less about continuing the Malfoy line; however, the Malfoy vaults were his and renouncing his father’s name entirely meant the Ministry would take hold of his still frozen vaults permanently. Draco followed Hari’s example in simply going by Master Draco. Even Teddy, as Hari’s heir presumptive was not spared being called Young Master, or Young Master Lupin-Black.
The boy, Draco Malfoy, ignored the stares and whispers, standing as tall as his 177cm frame would allow with shoulders squared, and nose stuck pompously up in the air. His mother, Narcissa Malfoy née Black, placed a hand on his shoulder as they waited graciously for their turn in the queue. Draco looked around the room with pretend boredom.
Harry Potter believes that He-who-must-not-be-named is still alive and wants to use the Philosopher's stone to regain his body. What? That had to be why Father didn't want me to stay at Hogwarts over the Holiday, and why we strengthened our wards at the Manor for Yuletide.
"Can I tell, Pans?" Draco frowned, Pansy Parkinson. His long time friend and fellow Slytherin whom tried to sell hari out to the Dark Lord earlier that year. He knew she didn't mean it and was scared for her life. The offer of her life in exchange for Hari's was too tempting. Did he want to tell her, yet? He knew that Hari didn't have any ill will towards her and vice versa. That was not the issue. The issue being, Pansy was a notorious gossip and posted pictures and tips to the Newspapers, like Witch Weekly gossips rag and The Daily Prophet.
Not able to control his feelings from bubbling up to the surface, he kissed Draco. It was nothing like the others that came before. It was a violent attack of lips, and tongue, and teeth. Draco shuddered under Hari’s onslaught.
Narcissa clicked her tongue, "tsk, So you decide to maul yourself instead, Mon petit. Very wise. And then burn yourself. What were you thinking?"
“Then you can borrow something of mine and we’ll go shopping. We’ll need to do a complete overhaul of your wardrobe. Get a move on.” Draco said as he left the room.
Dudley tumbled into the once glass enclosure. Piers had tried to pull him back, but was dragged down along with his obese friend. Harry sat on the floor of the snake exhibition his mouth open in astonishment.
Kreacher appeared in front of them with a startling crack of a whip. "Master Harry, Master Harry. It's the new Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. He's angry for not being allowed in sir, demands to speaks with you." Kreacher spoke up in a high pitched voice.
Tongue in cheek Andromeda glanced at her sister and nephew. “Uh-huh.”Draco refused to make eye contact.
So readers, how about it. Throw out a few ideas you would like to see happen, and I'll fit them in. Sound good?
“Master Harry be destroying Mistresses things, filthy half-breed master be ruinses the house” Kreacher croaked out. Twirling on his heels, head cocked, teeth bared, and wand raised in his right hand, Harry saw Kreacher standing on the first landing of the grand stairwell directly across from the front door. On the wall meeting the stairs, shrunken house-elf heads were mounted on the wall on plaques.
Hari slowed to a stop, serving around an older black gentleman in his green station wagon, to squeeze onto the sidewalk, reserved parking for motorbikes and scooters, and a block away from the Leaky Cauldron. Hari put a hand on Draco’s shoulder briefly to stop him from walking onward. “Look Mal…Draco, I gain enough unwanted attention as is with the whole war thing,” Hari flipped off his fame as if saving the world was no big deal, “and I’d rather not go in their without my cloak, but I know they are very hostile towards you.” Hari seemed to be struggling with himself.  He held out some type of silken cloak. Draco raised one eyebrow at the odd offerings. “Take my cloak and if we get separated meet me at Ollivander’s”
“You have no idea the dreams I’ve had.” Hari replies, scratching at his scar absently. “I once dreamed I rode on a flying motorbike, but that turned out to be a memory. Although I did get to fly in Sirius’s motorbike again last year.” He grimaced as he remembered the horrid flight in sidecar to Hagrid and Death Eaters pursued them while flinging Killing Curses at them.
Draco, nearly overwhelmed with affectionate appreciation for the raven haired, emerald eyed boy scrubbing pans, and chatting with a tiny black haired woman with purple streaks through her hair, and whispered, “He's Perfect” His dragon hummed in agreement.
Do you think the animal portrayed on each of the Founders house crest represents a Patronus or an animagus?
“Narcissa Malfoy, the Wizengamot has come to a consensus, all criminal charges are dropped, you were a victim to your husband and for that we are sorry, you are free to go home.” Narcissa was crying with gratitude as the shackles were removed from her wrists. She was smiling and crying as she rubbed blood circulation back into her hands. Draco was relieved, his mother was free.
Sitting on the edge of one corner, Draco plopped back diagonal across the bed. Arms spread wide he stretched out with a goofy un-Malfoy like grin on his face. Grabbing a pillow he rolled, burying his face into the soft cotton. Grabbing another, he stuffed it between his knees. Face flushed, breath panting, and eyes dark with desire and hooded, he moaned out Hari’s name.
If it wasn't the Weasley's, then who is abusing Harry Potter? Harry should be the most cherished person in the whole wizarding world, but someone at "home" is abusing him.
"The front entrance is still boobytrapped from the war, I am having a Curse Breaker come in later this week to get rid of it. This place is still under
“Ungrateful carrier pigeon.” Draco grumbled, breaking the seal and unfolding the letter. Something small and gold fell into his hand.
impression of the room was still there. Three windows framed to nothing hung mid air, facing the east. The room's fireplace blazed hot in its usual corner, and yet all the furniture was still there.
"Geez Potter, no need to bow to me. I forgive you." That got Hari to snap his head up, eyes flashing emerald green to meet laughing gray ones, and realized that Draco was joking.
The policeman took a hesitant step back, one hand raised, and the other hovered over his gun. "No, Mr. Dursley. I know your upset. But you must see how grave it is to let a dangerous and invasive creature like a Brazilian Boa Constrictor out into the city. Animal control has still not been able to obtain the confused beast, and they will still need to be compensated for their service and time." The policeman tried to reason.
Draco looked curiously at Hari. “Who’s the owl from? Are they expecting a reply?” The other two owls had left immediately after delivering the letters. This one stayed.
"Harry, calm down. Dudley, this is the cousin you told me about?" Cho tried to negate the hostility.
“I am sorry, Hari. If I could, I would have taken you in and taught you wizard customs, spells, and magical theory.”
Hari and Draco handed over their identification cards. Hari's fake, but the bouncer really didn't need to know this, saying he just turned 18 a few days prior as the magic will always claim until he actually does turn 18.
Each of the black cabs pulled up and dropped off their passengers in front of a two story building with a grand sign of a rampant horse. The sign flashed blue for its body, and went dark when the mane and tail flashed a violent shade of neon red. An arched canvas cover shielded the entrance and bouncer from the drizzle of rain that wouldn't quit. The bouncer checked I.D's at the door and allowed customers and party goers through with a lazy wave and an unhooking of velvet ropes.
Draco couldn’t help the involuntary “Gross,” that popped out of his mouth. The idea of his mother and father together while at Hogwarts in that way made him shudder with disgust.
Hari stood awkwardly behind him, with one hand raised to rub the back of his neck. Draco called over his shoulder. “You may look too, you big ninny.” Hari scurried over.
“And the blood adoption of Teddy?” Hari asked nervously. “To be perfectly honest. I would love to be magically bound to Teddy as his godfather, but blood ritual seems like a little, er...Dark.”
"Read your mind?...Yes Mr. Potter I have. I was born with no sight, but that gave me an even greater Sight. I see into your mind, I assess your honor. I know what you have done, why you did it, and why you are here now."

Hari wanted him. Draco knew it as sure as the sun would rise and chase away the night. He felt it this morning when Hari was crawling between his legs to get closer, in the eagerness of his returned kisses that afternoon, and only moments earlier, the tightness Hari wrapped his arms around his neck.
“Do you have regretsss? Do you want me to bring him back? It’sss not too late.” It couldn’t be; Voldemort was not one to show compassion. Where was the voice coming from, if not his head? Looking wildly around, Harry looked for the person responsible for the voice.
Hari’s breath caught at the sight of the Muggle envelope with achingly familiar, small tight handwriting addressed to him. Hari knew instantly who the letter was from.
He struggled to get Draco to his feet and out of the study. If Hari thought it was hard to get the still drunk and half conscious Draco through the Floo, maneuvering him up four flights of stairs was more difficult. It never crossed his mind to use magic.
Hari had a lot of emotional baggage, but he didn’t know to bring anything. “I haven’t anything…” He began, before Draco presented the rubbish bag. Hari then noticed what it was. He laughed heartily with his head thrown back.  Unexpecting, it was the bag he forgot in the corner of the room, he thought to burn anyway. The bag of clothes that were not even fit for rags. Clothes he kept that used to be Dudley’s hand-me-downs.
Having a lay-in or a lazy morning wank was out of the question when he had to be up before the Dursleys if he ever wanted to finish the list of assigned chores. Hari counted himself lucky he did all the laundry over the summer so he didn’t have to be caught in compromised situations. They never questioned him running a load of laundry after all.
When she made it to her destination, she was puffing in air. She knocked impatiently on the door. Then did it again when there was no answer. With another huff of breath she shoved the door open.
Stepping up to the fireplace, Harry contemplated using Draco Malfoy's Hawthorn with Unicorn hair wand or simply use the powder on the top of the mantle. Harry decided that floo powder might be interesting. "What do I say to the floo network?" Harry inquired.
“You could go serve the Malfoy’s. You wanted to do that before the end of the war, right? The war is over, no need to worry about you revealing secret information to them now” Harry was nearly bipolar in his excited drunkenness, poor Kreacher could barely keep up with his sudden mood swings. One moment he is moody and depressed, then clingy and whiny, and the next he is a happy drunk.
“Nooo, AWE!” There! With a satisfied smirk, Draco continued to press into that spot, over and over again.
Narcissa hugging her son around the middle, resting her head on his shoulder. “It is a horrible feeling to hate oneself. It took me years to learn to love and appreciate my dragon. He’s one of the reasons why I named you Draco, in honor of him. I knew you had to carry Lucius’s name, but I wanted you to have a part of me in there too. When going over astrological names, I knew that by keeping the Black tradition alive I was also honoring my dragon, which was so much a part of me.  He makes me feel so strong. I know at your age it can seem your dragon is fighting against you, but… but I hope you learn to love yours as I love mine.” And so saying, her eyes changed to reflect her dragon; pupil-less swirling pools of iridescent colors.
"By the time the poor tired overworked guppies arrive, I could have done any number of things to you in retaliation, obliviate you, and Disparate from this place easily." Draco says leaning into Justin with his wand tip at his pulse point. "In fact, I think I'll do that now."
which smells like snow. As is, Hari smells like the outdoors, as he potters around in the garden often enough that these smells cling to him and he would bring these scents into the house. Draco had no doubt in his mind that Hari has creatures blood, how could he not being the scion of the Noble House of Potter, but it was unclear what he would present as. He just as easily present as beta, scion be damned. Only in Draco's wildest fantasies could Hari present as the rarest male omega, which would be a dream come true for any gay alpha like himself.
Hari just said sighed and said, “Enough Kreacher, you understand your punishment. What did you and Koako want?”
"I'm sorry ma'am...uh...Chieftess, don't I just have the one vault?" Harry timidly spoke up, not wanting to invoke the goblin's chieftess wrath.
Harry knew this to be true, having experienced this before at the Dursleys; the feeling far worse than an empty stomach. The plate was pushed back before Harry and he gingerly took another one, more than half expecting him to snatch the plate away. He let out a relieved breath when that didn't happen. He ate this croissant much slower and savored the warm slide of delicious food into his stomach.
“Los Vegas?” Hari asked not really understanding the discussion, he often daydreamed in Church forced to go to keep up appearances. It was the one time Hari was actually allowed to wear an outfit that fit him. But Hari had heard the city in America referred to as Sin City by the older boys at his school. That question earned him a cuff on the back of his head.
The third time I saw Malfoy was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had tracked us down in the room of requirements along with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Voldemort wanted to capture me alive, so that he could kill me himself, once and for all. Malfoy was dragged their by his two friends whom had lost their respect in him for his shortcomings. They were urging him to kill me, and he was begging them not to kill me. Crabbe cast Fiendfyre but was not able to control it, and it burned him alive. Fiendfyre was consuming everything in its path and in its wake leaving only ashes. Hermione, Ron, and I were able to find brooms and fly out. I flew back to save Malfoy, while Ron flew back to rescue Goyle.
The entrance of the bank is a small white marble steps that lead up to bronze doors, flanked by gold and red clad goblins. Inside the bank are two rows of goblins that flank the length of the lobby with hundreds of goblins standing guard, while others goblin clerks work the counters upfront. Upon the bronze doors is a rhyme that dissuaded thieves:
The Prosecutor went on with the trial. “Now for testimony by the accused, Mr. Malfoy?” Draco startled, “The elder.”
Realizing he was treading on thin ice, Draco backtracked. "For the men, who weren't able to woo her, Hari." When Hari only grumbled, but the fire was mostly burned out in his eyes, Draco continued. "Anyway, this book documents not the births of my ancestors, but when they presented and what their secondary gender is. See, mostly beta, beta, beta, oh here, my third cousin, Callidora, or maybe my fourth cousin, is a female alpha just like my mother. It even says what their manifestation is. Look, my mother white antipodean opaleye dragon, just as I am. Dear cousin, Callidora is a Bugbear. Not from the Black line, Hari." Draco flipped a page. "Oh, look it says my third great-grandfather was also an alpha and manifested as another opaleye dragon. See, So I can trace what lines my inheritance is from." Draco said with pride.
"What about Hari's, then?" Draco tried craning his neck to see Hari but he was blocked by a curtain.
Draco’s smirk fell away as he looked at the metal monster that Hari was standing up by some type of metal twig.
“Uggg, god no, it burns, why?” Harry managed to get out. Warmth immediately flooded his chest and he felt a little dizzy, as he peered up through watering eyes at the twinkling eyed house-elf. "Why does anyone drink this stuff, Kreacher?”
“And while they are gathered, we can have a Curse Breaker, well, break the Fidelius charm. Bill is a member of the Order, correct Hari? I assume, seeing as he’s already been here once before.”
Did he imagine the sound? The sound came again. Draco rolled again, eyes swirling with colors absorbing the black pupils of his eyes, and a growl erupted from his throat.
Harry pushed around aunt Petunia, who overbalanced and tumbled sideways to the floor still stuck in that position. Taking her purse off the side table near the fridge, he ruffled through her wallet. He heard a muffled shout behind him. He turned to face his aunt, to hear muffled sounds coming from her snarling unmoving lips. Shuddering, he continued with his mission-pilfering money from his aunts purse.
"I don't know if I can return your feelings, Draco." Draco closed his eyes to his heartbreak. “Not yet, so I decided we could try..."
She walked in from the back of the restaurant with florescent lights giving her deep skin tone and magnificent costume a golden glow. An understatement, surely, as her costume was made entirely of gold material.
"I'm never going back, never. You can't make me!" Harry yelled passionately fueled by fear and desperation.
"They can have all their gold back, I don't want any gold that was obtained through any shady businesses, that includes Voldemort stealing from his followers, willingly or otherwise."
She shuffled some parchment around, with dainty metal rimmed glasses perched on her rather long, warty, and wrinkly nose, not looking up at the shellshocked Potter boy. "Awe! Here we are. Your trustee was...Sirius Black, your named godfather...why didn't he...oh, I see." She lifted what appeared to be an extended note attached to the original, and set aside her glasses and resumed the hands on her belly pose once more. "Sirius Black was put in that Wizard prison, Azkaban. Fortunately for you, Gringotts does not operate by wizard rule but goblin." Pausing in thought, milky eyes staring off into space, unseeing, yet seeing all.
As Andromeda left, she glanced up, but Draco and Hari were already absorbed in Teddy. Hari was trying to get Draco to change the nappy. Draco was having none of it. “And have him wee on me, again Hari? I think not.” Draco exclaimed loudly.
The portrait of Sirius slapped his knee as he gave a snorting crackle of a laugh, "I'd say Pronglet, if you are considering dating my second cousin."
a home,’ Harry mussed as he waited for traffic to clear so he could reach the as of yet, nonexistent wrought iron gate surrounding the tiny steps leading to the front door of the townhouse.
Narcissa had not gone out into society since the wand excursion fiasco after being cleared of all charges by the wizengamot. They had rocks thrown at them for Salizar’s sake.
scars on the back of his right hand done with a blood quill in detention with umbridge. "I bet I have Dittany around here... somewhere?" Hari trailed off, actually turning his head this way and that as if he would be able to see it in the study. He pulled out his beautiful willow wand and said, "
Any moment, he would wake before the pain. Like dreaming of falling from a great height, the dreamer always woke before impact.
which covered him in oozing boils. He had to go to the Hospital wing. Severus, the Head of House, gave me five House points.
not taking away the too brief blissful memory. Thanks to his dragon inheritance Draco stood a full head and shoulders above Harry where as before it was mere inches.  Luckly, Potter was smiling down at Teddy in his arms and didn't see the slightly panicked expression he had on his face.
“This is a ball, Teddy. Buh-aw-LL, ball. See it’s green and um, bumpy.” Hari looked sheepishly up at Draco. “It took me a minute to get used to talking to someone who doesn’t talk back, but um, he really likes movement. So I got lots of smaller-ish toys to play with him. Oh, watch this.” Hari said as he gently rolled the ball in Draco’s direction.
Narcissa cleared her throat, “Dot, I need you to clear out as many multi-compartment trunks as possible, and only pack mine and Draco’s clothes and any items of necessity, hygiene, and beauty products. Kocoa, I need for you find any valuables my late husband bought me, any jewelry I bought or brought with me into our marriage, any loose gold or other currency lying around, and empty the safe in all offices.” Narcissa stopped pondering what items to take and which items to take. But her son took those thoughts out of her head.
The house-elf quickly handed the portrait of Sirius Black III over to Draco upside down. The Sirius in the portrait was saying, "silly house-elf" and cursing as he fought not to fall into an ungraceful heap back at the bottom of the portrait when Draco turned it back, right-side-up. He then turned it to Hari, who grasped it excitedly, with hands trembling as the Sirius in the portrait said happily, "Prongslet! Pup, how are you?"
"Haha, sweet right?! Every week the club hosts a different theme; last week was Cowboys and Aliens, and the week before that, famous celebrities." Alice gushed.  "This week is Queen's nights. I am sure Sheryl will be wearing something fabulous and she'll know just what costume to dress you two in."
"Ginny? Oh, Ginny. We broke up after Dumbledore's funeral. I didn't want anyone going after her because of me. I haven't really spoken with her about getting back together. There just hadn't been enough time, with the funerals and what not..." Hari trailed off. "I don't know if I feel the same way anymore." Hari said sullenly.
Victor Hugo once said "History has its truth, and so has legend. Legendary truth is of another nature than historical truth. Legendary truth is invention whose result is reality. Furthermore, history and legend have the same goal; to depict eternal man beneath momentary man."
For two years she searched the streets, hoping to see a familiar mop of unruly hair, or a flash of bright emerald green eyes behind rounded glasses. After all this time, her wayward cub returned. She waited patiently for him to lift his head and meet her eyes. He had a lot to answer for, worrying her like that. But when he lifted his head, all that anger fled to be replaced with affectionate relief.
By the time they were shoe shopping Hari was exhausted and begged for a break. His feet really did hurt and he was ready to drop. They were lucky to have shrunk down multiple shopping bags into one large one. They certainly couldn’t have ridden home on a motorbike, otherwise.
"It wasn't a shame for her to marry Mr. Weasley. He's a great man, and a great father." Hari almost growled.
'Honor my heritage' it said in her journals, 'with a twist'. It went on into further details, about how she changed the spelling, but the pronunciation is similar. Hari, spelled with one 'R' and and 'I', Hah-ree. A true Gryffindor name, sanskrit meaning Lion." Reading out loud his mothers notes, he continued. "Could also mean king; natural born leader, commander, and independent. Passionate and compassionate, charismatic with magnetic personality, and a romantic. The one who removes troubles, blockage, pain, slavery and sin. A savior." He finished closing the journal, but not before Andromeda saw that Lily had circled the word savior several times over.
Draco was stunned, he never thought to be having a drunk conversation with Hari Potter like this. Brain scrambling and heart racing he tried to play it off. "Why Potter," Draco said taking the last sip of his drink to his lip, before pouring himself another tumbler. "if you wanted to see me naked, all you had to do was ask." Draco really couldn't bring himself to show Hari the scars on the lower half of his body.
He crunched eagerly into a crisp and tasted of oily corn crisps, salt, and fake cheese. They were addicting. After the first crisps, he ate another, and then a third.
“Well, I am not surprised, Corbeau. It is one of the more difficult magical rituals out there.” Narcissa says.
Please take my testimony into account and give Narcissa Malfoy née Black and Draco Lucius Malfoy the freedom they deserve. Their crimes, if any committed during the war was not so severe as to earn them even a year in Azkaban.
"I was trying not to maul Potter!" He gritted out as Narcissa lowered to her knees and raised his bloody third degree burned hand to eye level.
"Really? And what might that be, Malfoy?" Hari said in challenge. How ever will they get along if they keep sniping at each other like this.
All he ever wanted growing up was to be just like his father, so he did everything his father asked of him, said whatever he needed to say, acted in whatever mannerism he was supposed to. Draco rotated his stiff shoulders, flexed twice, feeling the faux pain of the scars from the caning he received more than once for being a disappointment to his father. Draco learned the hard way that the life he grew up with was wrong. It only took a war and living with a deranged murdering monster for three years to knock some sense into him. Sure he could still be proud of his pedigree, but that didn’t mean half-bloods and mud…muggle-borns were less. Take Harry Potter and Hermione Granger; Granger is perhaps the smartest witch in his year, if ignorant of wizarding ways, and Harry Potter… well he’s lacking in the brains department, but makes up for it with looks, and magical power. Draco was not afraid to admit that he was vain. Weasley was still dirt poor and an uncivilized weasel.
Draco stood with his back to the door of the sixth floor boy’s bathroom, hands clenching the edge of the sink in a white knuckled grip, and white-blond hair bowed over the sink when Harry crept into the bathroom unnoticed. Moaning Myrtle the ghost that usually haunted the girl’s bathroom on the second floor, had been trying to get him to confide in her for months now.
My whole life revolved around this war. The Cursed scar on my forehead a physical reminder of the burden placed on my shoulders at fifteen months old. The burden of being your Savior, being hidden away from the wizarding world, being hunted and targeted by Voldemort and his followers, and the burden of knowing that because of this scar I was the only one capable of defeating Voldemort once and for all.
After the letter was read, Draco was stunned speechless. He had no words. He sat shackled by his wrists to the chair in the middle of the coliseum like chamber, with his mother also shackled by her wrists, and father completely chained from head to foot. The Wizengamot was abuzz with chatter after the letter was read. Never had he been so embarrassed in such a public setting for all the Wizarding World to bear witness. Never had he been so humbled. Why is it that only Harry Potter could bring out these feelings in him? Would one testimony against thousands be enough to save his mother and possibly himself?
The last time Hari was here, Sheryl had teasingly said, “Finally stepping outside of that closet you’ve been living in, yeah?” Sheryl accompanied this statement with a big saucy wink. Normally Hari took the ribbing good-naturedly; however, Hari was having a stressful day and any subject remotely relating to Hari living in a closet was a prickly subject. Hari was under immense stress with war on the horizon, feeling guilt over his godfather’s death, and the mounting abuse at home. Added to that statement said in jest, Hari snapped.
Hari gurroffed at Draco’s struggle attempts at getting in, holding Teddy secure as the hammock swayed ominously. Once in, Draco pulled Hari closer to rest his head on his shoulder. Then he gathered Teddy and snuggled him in the other arm. The ropes held them snug together in quite a picture.
Draco swallowed him down to his root, before ascending back up to the exposed head, where Hari erect penis weeped pre-cum openly. Draco sucked the translucent milky liquid into his mouth, humming in pleasure.
"Hari don't be such a prude." Draco called somewhere over his shoulder in the general direction of Hari's mortified posture. "Did you know Mama Bear, I kissed him the first time I saw him this summer, with tongue mind you, and he thought it was just some French greeting."
Sheryl panned her gaze over Draco’s carefully groomed hair, well-manicured nails, and stylized clothes, and her gaydar pinged instantly. Shaking her head she tutted. “You certainly know how to attract them sugar. Let’s go inside. I can have the Harry Potter Special prepared for you in no time, the special, or your blonde man here can pay. He looks like he’s rolling in cash.”
Choosing to push what happened out of his mind for the moment Hari went through the parlors Floo and on into his study. He needed to get a hold of himself. How did they normally interact with each other again? Oh, right! They sniped at each other, provoked each other, fought physically and dueled with magic. Normal? Hari didn't want to return to that.
Hari had his arms secure around Draco’s neck and Draco in turn pressed Hari tight between he and the door; his hands vice-like on his waist.They traded kiss for kiss, and breath for breath until their lungs screamed for air.
“Most shops now a day make off-the-rack clothes that are mass marketed worldwide. Measurements are written on the tag.” Hari forced out. “But I don’t know my size. I’ll have to try a few sizes on… Maybe I’ll call her back after all.” Hari said uncertainly, beginning to turn his head to the sales associate.
Draco was insticulay on alert.  “Maman?” Draco asked worriedly, only for his words to fall on deaf ears as his mother starred with empty eyes at the contents of the letter. Glancing for a split second at the broken seal, he noticed the crest of the sender. His chest tightened and his breath quickened. For just a moment. he panicked, thinking it might be an arrest warrant for him and his mother, once more; that the prosecutor had come up with some more evidence to overrule the acquittal.
"So, Hari...how do you like your new wand?" Draco said trying for friendly conversation to break the heavy silence.
I have awesome Quidditch skills and surely Madam Hooch will recognize my talents in front the whole Slytherin and Gryffindor First Year class. It didn’t go as planned. Harry was able to summon his broom just a fraction of a second before I did. I was watching him closely and nearly dropped my own as it zoomed up into my hands expertly. Weasel’s hit him in his pudgy nose, Granger couldn’t get hers to listen, and Longbottom’s just sat on the grass, unanimated.  Ha!
"Sorry to bother you ma'am, but I'm here to give the final eviction notice to the residence of this property, they haven't been answering any of the previous letters, there is no telephone number on file, and the mortgage is over six months late." The stranger yelled rather too loudly over the baby's wailing, and the nosy neighbors across the street and next door heard every word the stranger said.
For that, Hari chuckled, "I don't know, sleepyhead. Let me have my arm back and we'll both know." Hari said amused. Yawning hugely he complied. Shifting down further on his chest and allowed Hari's arms to escape its pin.
Draco was only half listening as they made their way to their seats. Sheryl shooed a couple out of a little alcove table that allowed nearly 360 degree view of the restaurant. Rather than sitting across from Hari with his back to the room, he opted to sit next to him instead. It was a tight fit and Hari gave Draco a strange look before turning back to Sheryl to continue the argument.
The taunts the jeers. Harry has heard it all. The pain of those words hurt almost worse than the casual abuse inflicted on him from a young age. The open palmed slaps, the cuffs to the back of the head, the pinches, the neglect and near starvation all let Harry Potter know that he was an unwanted burden for his aunt and uncle from the moment he was orphaned and abandoned on their steps at 15 months old. Alone and unloved.
Petunia couldn't have known that by the time Christmas rolled around, Lily and James Potter were in hiding.
"Can I come in?" Hari asked searching Draco's face for a reaction. He got none. He stepped up to the door jam, which forced Draco to take a step back into his room and let him in.
Hari figitted and Draco stepped closer, trying to comfort him. He wasn’t too keen on the idea either. Unaware or just ignoring the two teens discomfort, Narcissa continued to talk.
Lost in Draco’s heat, he lifted his hips off the bed. His cock disappeared deeper into Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat with no resistance.
A sound on the stairs had Draco swirling around. Hari was leaning against the banister, Asclepius twisting up to great him. His arms were crosses over his chest, messy hair gloriously tousled and eyes sparkled like green gems behind his glasses. He was wearing a raggedy red T-shirt, and ripped blue jeans, and white scuffed trainers.
“Potter it's bloody 30 degrees (an exaggeration) out here, and you want me to wear a sweltering cloak, aye, I’d surely catch my death under that thing.” Hari furrowed his brow, before it smoothed out when he laughed.
That doesn't mean I haven't stopped working on SCES, I am!  I have the next three chapters already blocked out. It'll just take time to get there.
He thought. Then he tackled the white and black heavy and smooth leather skirt. He couldn't get it over his thighs before he saw the zipper that ran up one side.
'Fuck no. Sooner than that. We are planning a house warming party. The date hasn't set but it'll be soon. The house is nearly presentable. We need to add extendable rooms for guests. My grandmother once had them up, apparently. You'll both get an invite then. Look for my owl."
"I..uh...not yet, Blaise. I'll tell her in person, where I can swear her to secrecy." Draco decided.
Hari was taking Draco out to lunch at Sheryl’s Place, a popular barbeque restaurant which just so happened to be located within one of London’s notorious gaybourhoods. The area got its reputation from the large LGBTQ+ community and popular gay bar and nightclub that guarded the entrance against homophobic, xenophobic, and racist people like Hari’s own uncle Vernon. Sheryl Mason, the owner and head chef was a rather tall and intimidating black man in full drag, with a gleaming meat cleaver used to deter any negativity towards herself, her staff, customers, or her restaurant. Sheryl didn’t discriminate against anyone, race, gender, or sexual orientation.
"You, you've been seeing a shrink! I need a shrink for all the abuse and bullying you've put me through!"

Hesitating, Harry looked apprehensive between Kreacher and the amber liquid he swirled stalling for time. Before with a shrug he did as Kreacher instructed, bracing himself for the burn. Harry was pleasantly surprised by the undertones; smoky, spicy, and sweat, but still burned like fire. Coughing once into his wrist and clearing his throat, he said, “another.”
A little sheepishly, Draco removed his feet which were entwined with Hari's legs and ceased the rubbing he was doing. At the same time, he removed the tip of his tail which had slowly made its way up Hari's leg to wrap around his muscular thigh.
Meanwhile in Surrey, an animal loving half-giant approaches the rows of nearly identical houses of Number 4 Privet Drive.
"Wasn't sure if my owl would find you, or if you were receiving letters, and if you would even show up if you did." Blaise said.
Hari kicked the toe of his trainers against the dust on the floor and sighed. He rubbed at his eyes which were scratchy from lack of tears he so desperately wanted to shed. He just wanted his life to go back to before fourth year. Everything that was a constant in his life since he discovered he was a wizard has been ruined with the war. Hedwig; his first ever birthday present and companion, murdered while still trapped inside a cage before plugging to the earth. His Firebolt; flying was the one thing that he enjoyed above all others too was destroyed the same day. And now his wand; he had his Holly and Phoenix feather core wand since the day he discovered he was a wizard. Everything was changing.
Harry didn’t know what time it was, the hallway had no natural light to go off of, and the pocket watch that Molly Weasley gave Harry on his seventeenth birthday broke during the Battle at Hogwarts. He was sweaty from the over exertion of using a great deal of wandless, wordless magic, and filthy from being on the floor and dispersing the dusty spectre of Albus Dumbledore at the entrance. Rebirth, transformation, and healing are what Asclepius told him his magic would do for Kreacher. An emerald and copper snakeskin now surrounded Kreacher like a shroud, once the skin flaked away Kreacher would be alive, more youthful than ever before. All Harry could do was sit at the bottom of the grand staircase and wait for him to wake up. For the first time in a long time Harry cried with relief and gratitude; Kreacher would live.  And he hoped beyond hope that Kreacher would forgive him.
Draco’s brain stalled for a moment on that one word before turning back on in overdrive. His eyes tracked around the room once more, taking it all in with a new perspective. He looked at the clothes on the bed and floor before his eyes landed on Hari’s disheveled appearance. His heart melted and the smirk on his face softened into a goofy grin. His body wanted to melt with his heart, but he forced his body to sit up instead.
Hari looked down at his wand remembering Mad-eyes warning about a blown up buttocks, before shrugging and smiling sheepishly.
One thing Draco knew for sure, ‘learning to control his new found power and instincts would be a bitch to manage.’
After the second interruption, Draco rinsed off in the bath and went to the vanity mirror to apply some type of lotion to his skin. Hari’s vision had been blurry  without his glasses, but he remembered flashes of pale skin as Draco ran fingers over raised arms, chest, and neck.
As if calling on the taboo name of the Dark Lord himself, Andromeda heard a knock at her door. Closing her eyes on a prayer, Andromeda threw open the door with wand raised ready to obliviate any memories from her neighbors mind. The entrance was bare.
He always was with his silky blonde hair, gorgeous grey eyes, and cheekbones that could cut diamonds. The intense look Hari received was not an unfamiliar look aimed at him, just not in a while.
Andromeda held tightly to her sisters arms as they walked ever closer to the towering marble mausoleum, Teddy sat in a sling starring in fascination at the grey clouds above, broken up the occasional blue sky and green leafage from treetops.
"Who are you talking about, Severus, the father or son? Because son shouldn't pay for the sins of the father. You don't know the boy, nor do I." Minerva moved closer to Severus. "and the son is missing. Harry is missing and you owe it to Lily, to James..."
Draco tried to reign in his possessive nature, but as a juvenile alpha it was a constant battle. Draco set his jaw and tried to take calming breath. He had to remind his alpha;
“Er...sorry to disturb you, I... ah didn’t wake you, did I?” Hari said, putting his hands in the pockets of his jumper and pulling down to cover the front of his crotch just in case. He was suddenly glad he took that cold shower.
He remembered how much she loved her husband, Remus Lupin. Even when he tried every excuse for her to give up on him; he was a werewolf and he was too old for her, but she never did give up on their relationship. And their newborn son…
"Well, say something." Hari demanded of Dudley, "She's like me. Are you alright with your girlfriend being what she is, a witch?" Hari practically snarled. "Or would you have her locked away, hidden in a broom cupboard, maybe?"
Draco suddenly stood up as well. He made his way over to Dudley. Cho was clinging to his arm like an exotic ornament. He stretched out his hand to shake. When Dudley grabbed it in a firm grip, Draco rammed his other fist into Dudley's nose with a satisfying crunch. Hari heard it from where he was sitting, as well as the gasps from everyone who witnessed the punch, and the gasping laughter from Blaise.
, realistically living in a closet like he had for the first ten years of his life. A few days after that, Dumbledore came to collect him from Number 4 Privet Drive. The following year Hari, Ron, and Hermione went to hunt Horcruxes. The result, Hari hadn’t set foot inside Sheryl’s Place in almost two years. He hoped that Sheryl was still amiable to him.
"Kreacher must serve Master Harry Potter, as last Master willed it. Besides all in prison, no family to serve and Manor to take care of once they’ve all be gone to Azkaban." Kreacher probably didn’t know he said that last bit out loud, the way he was mumbling it to himself, but old habits die hard, even with him being reborn a “new house elf” Kreacher was still the same in many ways.
"I am taking this," He said gallantly, while holding up a pile of banknotes. "You owe me, not the other way around. Think it as a fee for services rendered." He said, sarcastically. They worked him like a slave. Well this is a slave revolt.
, he realized it wasn’t even past eleven yet. The night wasn’t over, so why did Hari’s time with Draco have to end abruptly either. He had fun today and so what if it was with Draco bloody Malfoy. With a smirk in the mirror and a quick rub down of his hair, he admitted to himself that he was actually beginning to like the starky prat. If he wanted this…whatever this was… to continue he had to make an effort to try as well.  An idea was forming in his brain and he hastily toweled off.
Draco could sense and feel Hari’s rising tension, the scent of wariness heavy in the predawn air. Instinctively Draco released calming pheromones, knowing it was useless on a presentedless person. That didn’t stop his dragon’s instincts to not do so anyway.
"Mistress Andra will be returning home with us, Master Harry Potter, sir? Young master, too?" Kreacher squeakily inquired.
Uncle Vernon whipped his whole body around, not able to turn just his neck. His watery bitty eyes narrowed and teeth barred. "What are you planning, boi-ey!" He snarled lowly.
"Um...no." Hari said with a quick eye flick in Narcissa's direction. Narcissa just quirked her eyebrow, identically to Draco's.
“Your guess is as good as mine, but I’d imagine Muggle-borns. They always create complications in our society by incorporating Muggle rules with ours.” Draco said, suddenly fuming. “Did you know that most pure-bloods are not even Christian, but since Dumbledore has been Headmaster at Hogwarts, we celebrate Christmas instead of Yule times? So much magic has been lost, because the younger generations are losing the knowledge of ancient magic’s.” Draco huffed.
the leg-locking jinx, on. Well, actually I've been practicing it on Crabbe and Goyle with Blaise. (We are now on first name basis). It was hilarious to watch him bunny hop the Grand Staircase. It took him ages. I wish I had a camera to catch all on moving film.
Feeling lighthearted, Hari slipped out of the room with a dopey smile on his face. He had a lot to ponder on and so left them to finish their conversation.
"Now to outfit the queen." Sheryl said gleefully. "Arlys, get the manakins. Sheryl leaned down to squish her face next to Draco's in the mirror and Alice did the same on his other side.
Mrs. Malfoy witnessed her family's unrelenting cruelty first hand, before she even left Hogwarts. Her eldest sister, Andromeda Black went against the beliefs of her family, fell in love and married a muggle-born, Edward (Ted) Tonks. They had been married for over twenty-five years and had a remarkable daughter together, Nymphadora Tonks, who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as an Auror and a Metamorphmagus. Ted Tonks went on the run during Voldemort's regime, refused to register under the Muggle-born Registration Commission in the Second Wizarding War and was captured and killed by Snatchers in March of 1998. Nymphadora Tonks was killed at the Battle of Hogwarts along with her husband, Remus Lupin, leaving their infant son, Edward (Teddy) Remus Lupin an orphan. Mrs. Malfoy never met her brother-in-law, niece, or grand-nephew, because Andromeda was disowned and Narcissa hadn't talked to her elder sister in twenty-five years. Similarly, my godfather and Mrs. Malfoy's cousin, Sirius Black, was sorted into Gryffindor; defying the Slytherin tradition, his relationship with his family deteriorated, and he had his named burned from the family tree after running away from home when he was sixteen to live with my father, James Potter. Both Sirius and Andromeda were born into the House of Black and deemed blood-traitors, disowned by the rest of the family, and had their names burned from the family tree. Mrs. Malfoy witnessed first hand the consequences of going against her family, and she would not be so foolhardy to make the same mistakes.
That Norwegian Ridgeback is going to grow to the size of the hut in a month. I got to do something about this. I can't write Mon Mère, Father reads all her mail. What can I do?
“Oh, mother and I will be performing a blood ritual at the summer solstice to strengthen the wards on the house. Aunt Andromeda was going to ask you to join us, but I am asking you now.” Draco turned to Hari.
"I'm ringing this table out. You can stay of course, but tonight the bar is closed on this table. I can't lose my liquor license and if anything happens to a minor while under my care, I could lose my Visa, not to mention, my daughter."
The DJ entered the stage. "Alright, we are onto our next set of entertainment for the night. Let me introduce you to our Queens..."
I was following Harry and his friends out of the History of Magic exams, when I overheard their conversation. "Harry relax. Hermione's right, the stone is safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once."
As a child Sirius ran away to stay with Harry's father, James, because he couldn't stand living there. His mother Walburga Black blasted his face off the family tree, but his father Orion Black didn't disinherit him so that after his parents and brothers death.
watched his mother smiled serenely at him. “I know that you love him…I’ve always known. I wanted to tell you to be cautious, my son.”
Or at least that is what Draco thought as he watched his long time school rival and secret crush holding a two month old baby up to his face and saying, surprise. '
I left out a key component to why the ministry felt it was important to go to such an extreme measure on all the wizarding population. And I didn’t tell you before, because it is...well,
Narcissa was floored, they couldn’t be broke. “What about my inheritance, my dowry, the vault I was given when I turned eighteen, and when I married. Or the gold willed to me from my parents after their deaths?”
'Twelve years in prison, sentenced to death, then stuck at 12 Grimmauld Place until his death, never a free man. 'What a cosmic joke' Harry thought.
Suddenly Harry sees red and could not think of the tentative truce between house-elf and master, that had so briefly developed while looking for Horcruxes and on the run. All Harry could think about was all the wrongs Kreacher has caused Sirius:
Harry has never seen Kreacher so excited, and certainly didn't appreciate his enthusiasm at the moment. He currently felt like he could murder the squeaky and chirping house-elf all over again. He didn't think he had any taste buds left to enjoy even the orange and cranberry scones currently being served. His throat and tongue felt like sand.
He couldn't grab anything that would be missed. So that meant any of the crisps or biscuits. A shame really. Searching in a dusty corner, Harry found stale saltines, dried apricots, and a granola bar. None of these items would be missed. He didn't bother with trying for a bottled drink, he would be doing lawn work soon enough and was able to drink from the hose at anytime. Harry's lived many of summer's with only a full belly of water for substance.
“What no, I wouldn’t. Not even in school would I have done that.” Draco said a little tersely. “Don’t joke about things like that.”
They were forced to take the tube, because inexplicably his uncle’s car paint boiled off and was replaced with tie-dyed colors. Hari insists that he didn’t have anything to do with it; that when he was washing the car it just happened like magic. Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him and got even madder for using the ‘m’ word. Hari still could feel the stinging burn of his belt smacking against bare skin and the empty hollow sensation in his stomach of going without supper. Hari was only seven years old.
“It probably just cut through the alley. Come I promised you ice cream. We’ve lost our place in the queue.”
“No, I’ve just been lost in thought. Hari how…how do you feel about me…ah..ah…I mean, are we friends?”
I have also started a new series in the HP fandom. Shameless self promotion:  Peculiar Harry Potter (He calls it magic). It's rated Mature for now :) it is a Drarry. It is not ABO or a creature fic. Prompt: What if Harry Potter discovered he was a wizard on his own, ran away from the Dursleys, was sorted into Slytherin, became friends with Draco Malfoy, and that friendship developed into something more?
"So, when you were a child you wanted to read books about me. You wrote about me in your, excuse me, your
"And Salazar Slytherin's Locket, and the Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw" The Chieftess added helpfully.
"Anyway, rival houses," Draco continued. "We didn’t get on at all. Not in classes, sports. Hell, we even duel--got into fist fights a few times. Left a few black and blue, and bloody. I’m surprised I wasn’t expelled a few times over."
Harry never considered what would happen if he got married and had children with a wife of his own. He just wanted to make sure that he took his responsibilities as a godfather seriously, and provide for his godson. Could he just hand over the Black estate to Teddy, and leave the Potter vault to his own children? What if he died before having any children? He always wanted a family, had even considered a future with Ginny before he split up with her, in what he believed was protecting her. Now he didn't even know if he even wanted to get back together with her. He could honestly say, he hadn't thought of her that often while hunting Horcruxes. 'Does that mean I never loved her to begin with, only the idea of what we could have together, a family?'
I am stupid, stupid, STUPID!!!  The boy I was talking to in Madam Malkin’s was Harry Potter.  Severus always warned me that it is never a good idea to meet your idols, and that they would only disappoint you in the end. He was right!!! Harry Potter is nothing like how he is portrayed in the books and news articles from the Prophet and Witch Weekly. First off he is littler than I am. And Mon Mère says I have a fragile frame, but compared to me, Harry looks like a strong breeze could blow him over. His clothes are shabby and his black hair is a mess. Maybe he was raised by Giants and that is why he looks like that. The bruises, surely they are from being with the Giants. He didn’t get them the same way I got mine, right?  His bruises are easy to see, mine can be easily hidden.
“Oh, well he can’t really see colours yet.” Placing a hand on her cheek in a move that surprisingly reminded Hari of Molly Weasley. “Your two hair colours are just simiplier for him, I’d imagine. The first colour he’ll see is red, so expect variations of that colour next.” Andromeda says as she takes the stairs up to the ground floor.
"It was an atrocity that the Black's ancestral home was is such disrepair. I'm glad my family coming to live with you, convinced you to fix that old dump." Draco says.
In this dream, Moaning Myrtle was floating over his head, giggling, and thrilling in a high pitched sing-song voice, “Don’t worry Draco, death will come soon. If you die and come back as a ghost, you can share my cubicle with me.”
When the bouncer arrived Draco and Hari made sure to stay behind Justin and out of his line of sight in the mirror. He was still a bit dazed and most likely wouldn't recognize his own mother at the moment, but precaution.
His eyes quickly flickered between it and Hari, relieved that it was closed. Only his blood could open the journal. Hari couldn't have been able to read it, without Draco opening it with his blood first. But it begs the question, how did Hari have possession of his journal in the first place?
Hari sat back on the floor with his head resting on the cushion besides Draco's knees. He let out a whooshing breath in relief of not spilling the rare potion all over the place. "It'll scar, but it shouldn't be too noticeable" He mumbled.
That was it, his last words as a free man. He thought he heard a few sniffles in the benches above him, but couldn’t be sure over his own ragged breath. The Wizengamot was buzzing with hushed chatter, or was that just the buzzing in his ears? Draco wanted to take his sentence with dignity, but he found that he was terrified of the verdict. His breath was constricted in his chest. His breath was coming in short quick breaths.
Unaware of Draco behind him, Hari startled when his voice sounded right behind him. “This place certainly has seen better days,” Draco says, his voice echoing down the hall. Hari whirled around effortlessly shushing Draco by crossing his finger against his lips. They stared into each other's eyes for a heartbeat, then two. Hari’s face slowly blooms with color.
You are all so amazing and supportive. Thank you, Kamilia_Rosa for leaving my one thousandth one hundredth kudos. (1.1k kudos).
He wanted everything to be perfect for Teddy's surviving family. He, Kreacher, and even Andromeda put a lot of work into fixing up the place. Andromeda knew quite a few charms and spells to refurbish the rooms, but didn't have the magical stamina that it took. Anything she couldn't do herself, or teach Hari how to do, they left to Kreacher. The townhouse had slowly turned into a home, room by room.
"And whom might you be?" Draco asked the stranger who presumed to know him. The man wore Muggle clothes, tailored slacks and vest with his white sleeves rolled up quarter sleeve to reveal and expensive looking time piece and muscular forearms. Considering he himself was wearing woman's clothing, the fact the man wore Muggle clothes in the Muggle World, meant nothing. There was no telling if this was a wizard, a reporter, or simply a man justifiably thinking he was a Muggle hating Death Eater.
I did the sensible thing and ran. I thought Harry was right behind me. I guess not. I wanted to kick myself. Why didn't I push him ahead of me when we ran.
Hari’s food quickly disappeared from his plate as he ate his breakfast as fast as possible. He ate all his meals with quick, small bites making it easier to digest and less likely to choke.  Living with the Dursley’s taught Hari this valuable lesson: Eat fast, because meals are far between and can be taken away at any moment. Old habits were hard to break. If Hari ate too slow his cousin Dudley would finish his much larger meal, then swipe Hari’s food right off his plate, and there was nothing he could do about it. The Dursley’s would often send him away from the table before he finished his meager meal. Withholding food had always been one of the Dursley’s worse punishments.
"I guess not." He said. Their was an ache in Draco's heart at that searching look. A look that he'd probably never truly know. And Hari was likely to take the knowledge to his death; again.
“I don’t know. I never had any, myself. What kind did my godfather like?” Harry asked with his hands in his pockets, and shoulders slightly hunched.
The house was decorated with multicolored lights and red poinsettias. The house smelled like cinnamon and spiced wine. Gentle crooning Christmas music was playing throughout the house. Everything was perfect.
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
Who was it? It would be easier to find the witch or wizard who did it. So, many people were looking and pointing, and talking. Anyone of them could have been doing it. If Harry kept his Nimbus in the brook shed, then it could have been done there. Someone must have tried to do the same thing the first day of Flying lessons. Longbottom was standing right next to Harry when he suddenly flew off. But he didn't even kick off the ground. So, then it was the same thing back then, but they aimed for the wrong broom. Clearly whoever did do it. didn't know their left from right, and we were standing on left side of the brooms. Idiot.
He quickly reached for his shampoo bottle to get his shower over and done with. Grabbing his 3-in-1 bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash he quickly finished washing in double time.
Hari was not expecting that reaction. Suddenly, Hari's look of earnest, changed to confusion, then hurt, then anger. He was just ready to stagger up on drunken legs when Draco draped his full weight over Hari knocking him to the floor. His glasses tipped off his head not that his eyesight wasn't already blurry. Hari turned around, using one forearm to try and knock Draco off him, while the other supporting his weight on the floor. "Hey, Draco..." He gritted out.
This was borderline ridiculous. He couldn't remember being quite so nervous with Ginny—or even Cho for that matter! But Draco was just so...so...so chic… How could he ever compare?
Draco sunk lower in the tub, his nose barely grazing the surface of the water, and blowing bubbles. He was mortified. He scrubbed his skin of sweat, dirt, crusted cum, and dead skin, then emptied the tub of dirty water. Refilling the 56 gallon tub, with a different type of bubbles and oils, he shampooed and conditioned his hair. He was just about to reach for the corded drain for the second time with his foot, before he stood up and used the extended nozal to rinse off completely, when the door of the bathroom opened for the second time a mere seconds after a quick nuckled knock. Hari strode back in unapologetic this time. Draco sunk once more back down to his nose in the water.
But there was still one more loose end to be tied up, and that was one member, Severus Snape, murderer of Albus Dumbledore and double crosser of the Light.
“It’s just Harry,” Harry instructed. “My godfather, Sirius Black was the last male decedent of the Black line. When he died without an heir, he willed it to me instead of letting it fall into the hands of his cousins, who are associated with Dark magic. But hang on, Asclepius? “You said you could bring Kreacher back, how?” Harry asked in a croaking hopeful voice.
He was just about to call his house-elf, when he heard a knock at his door. He didn’t smell his mother or his aunt, the house-elf would just Aparate in, so that left only Hari. Having forgotten everything from the night before, he rushed to the door to answer Hari at the door.
Hari’s mouth popped open in asoundment, not at Draco’s proclamation, but at the sudden realization...he pointed his finger accusatory. “You were jealous I got the fly Buckbeak and not you.” He said with no uncertainty.
There was just too many parallels with Draco and Narcissa wand cores being brothers and Hari's and Lily's wand being brothers.
One of these betrayals was that of Lucius Malfoy, as they would no longer honor the sacred rhetoric, "honor thy husband and thy father" and turn over information in regards to Lucius Malfoy’s activities during the Second Wizarding War. Misguided loyalty to husband and father got them into this bloody mess and even though they too will stand trial for war crimes, they will make sure Lucius Malfoy would never breathe fresh air as a free man again. It was a promise they made to themselves while they were being held hostage in their own home by a deranged murderer.
"On the contrary Mr. Potter, as chieftess of the United Kingdom, representing all goblinkind, I would like to off you thanks." The chieftess of goblinkind had a very expressive face, despite being blind. "You see, although you indeed broke into my bank, stole Helga Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange vault, and destroyed it along with the Dark Magic placed within."
“Dear old grant-tante Walburga. Is she as awful as mother always said she was?” Draco asked. It took Hari a moment to wrap his head around the french word for great-aunt, but once he registered the question, he nodded his head with vigor.
“Hell Sheryl! From the sound of the boy’s stomach he would be honored to sample your fine B.B.Q, which you have never tasted the likes before.” Hari blushed. He actually got accustomed to eating burnt food that it had become an acquired taste of his. He loved the smoky taste of barbeque brought out, and from the smell of it, the restaurant catered directly to his tastes; at least when it came to food.
Narcissa laughed, “why yes indeed. And I imagine you kneeled in front of the fireplace the whole time to better see and hear the person you are speaking with.” Narcissa had an amused glint in her eyes. “Quite an undignified position that puts one in. This way, no kneeling is required and you could sit comfortably anywhere to have the Floo conversation. And if you still wish to see the face of the person you are speaking with; all you need to do is the procedure in reverse, transplanting the flame back into another fireplace. The only downside is the inability to step through the flames in the new fireplace.”
“Wouldn’t I?” Was all Draco said as he pulled out his aspen wand from the retractable sheath on his wrist.
Andromeda positioned them around the altar, like a diamond with the altar in the center. As instructed Hari nervously held his willow wand tip facing the ground. His palms were sweaty. At Andromeda’s instruction, they each made a circle of their own, chanting “
There was a clambering commotion on stage, cursing and metal scraping over the stage, microphone amplifying the sound. This Queen came compared. Queen Daenerys' had an endogamous youthful face, that Draco couldn't tell came from an excellent makeup job or their actual youth. They had white blond hair tied up similarly to his but where his cut off around nape length, theirs went down to middle of the persons back. The long toga white dress with grey accents completed the look. This Queen Daenerys looked ferocious perched on a throne of spikes.
Hari didn’t say anything else, but he didn’t relax either. After the zenith moon ritual and blood-adoption, Hari was considered a Black by rights, the Master of the house, and now...family.
"I was born while my parents were in hiding. She must have known about the prophecy. She knew my due date was near the end of July or the beginning of August. The prophecy said, 'born as the seventh month dies. According to my birth certificate I was born two minutes to midnight on 31st of July."
Hari had a betrayed look on his face as he hopped down and bolted for the the half-door beside the counter and glass display of sweet goods ready to be sold. He ran towards the archway leading to the back room.
That’s the problem with death and murder, the unfairness of it all. Life is unfair and then you die-is that the saying? What about all the people that are forced to live through their loved ones deaths. How do they move on, can they move on, is it fair to move on with their lives? What about those you’ve harmed or killed in the war? How is murder justified?
The first door they came across was the bathroom and next to the bathroom was a door with a sign, marked simply Draco.
Wanting his completion, wanting to claim Potter as his and no other, and knowing the bite would send Potter over the edge into oblivion with him, Draco yanked him up by his hair, causing him to give a painful yelp, and keeping him upright by placing a hand over Potter's abdomen muscles, feeling his own cock outlined beneath smooth skin and tight muscles. Potter was still speared on Draco’s cock, knot finally locking them together, when he whispered in his ear for the first time, “Harry, your mine now.” He roughly yanked Potter into a bruising kiss, all tongue and clashing teeth, before pushing him back onto all fours, still buried inside, and bit into the tender flesh at the nape of his neck, and finally claiming Harry Potter as his. Draco threw back his head, mouth gaping, blood gleaming against his teeth and roared out his orgasm. Potter was also orgasming, brought to the end and finally tumbling over it, as Draco’s hot seed spurted into him in short, hot, intervals.
“If she is a foul mouthed, biggotted old witch who always called us all blood-traitors, mudblood lovers, and filth, then yes.” Hari responded.
"Hagrid did great..." But he didn't sound convincing. He remembered the Blast-Ended Skrewts that were unsanctioned, bred by Hagrid, and not in the curriculum.
"Yes, yes. The plan was carefully orchestrated to be done after your rut. not during. It was extremely rude of us to just show up without warning. Why I am surprised Hari even had the foresight to clean out our rooms yet."
At first Draco was awkward as he speared his hand into the open end of the puppets body. He found himself apologizing to the ridiculous thing. He glanced uneasily across at Hari who looked on expectedly. “Okay Potter, what am I supposed to do now?”
“Well he agreed to go shopping for our date, so I’ll have the opportunity to, won’t I?” Draco sounded smug.
"Soon enough, love." Draco said wiggling his eyebrow. Hari snorted. Pushing up from the table, he waved Alice toward as he and Draco followed her to the station.
She spoke in a clear voice: “When breath becomes air, I beseech you. Grant us clarity, happiness, and love we share. Each breath thine is mine, with each inhale I breath in you a fresh memory and with each breath I exhale the bad. For the dawn of tomorrow.”
Once done relieving his bladder, Hari washes his hands at one of the sinks. Shaking his hands dry, he adjusts his glasses and frowns at his wildly unkempt hair. Turning around to leave, he pauses on something in his reflection. A wet spot on his left shoulder. He leaned into the mirror, before simply turning his head down and pulling his dress shirt out to see better.
"A dragon?" His voice lilted at the end, turning the statement into a question. He was more focussed on Hari kneeling before him, hands now gently cupping Draco's white bandaged hand.
"I wa...want t...t...ed" Hari stuttered out at Draco's sudden closeness. Draco's gray eyes, reflecting silver pools surrounding dark pupils. Hypnotizing.
Draco was irked. “Fine don’t believe my words, I’ll show you.” And with a huff, he actually let go of the broom and fell backwards. Hari’s quick reflexes had him steadying the broom as the second body weight suddenly disappeared.
“Dreams, Potter. You wouldn’t happen to be dreaming of me, were you?” Hari nearly jumped out of his chair  when he heard the mocking voice behind him.
"I just want you to slow down. If you eat to fast when your stomach is not use to the amount of foot, you'll up-chuck breakfast and we'll be back to square one." Nik advised.
p.s. Sydney’s Owl Emporium does not allow rental of postal owls internationally. It’d only be animal cruelty allowing one bird to fly across the the hemispheres twice. This owl can take the journey, but it has got to be exhausting for the poor creature.
Draco nodded, squeezing Hari tight to his side as the other couples were doing with no qualm as he wouldn't be recognized here.
“It's clear, cousin, you never belonged in Slytherin House. Don’t try to play the blackmail game with me,   you’ll only embarrass yourself more than you I, ever could.”
“My laces.” He exclaimed, as he ducked out of his mother’s light touch on his shoulder. Then he took advantage of the crowd of patrons and travelers wanting the barkeep's attention for rooms or food or ale. He didn’t expect the push of the crowd, but he managed to get to the door opposite the wixen entrance.
Draco stood wide-eyed and disbelieving as he watched Potter slip in the spray of water, blood blossoming at his temple where it struck the floor, and his wand slipping out of limp fingers. ‘Potter, one of the greatest wizards of our time, brought down by a puddle of water. Un-fucking-believable! Draco now watched him momentarily hypnotized by the scene that played out before his eyes; Potter lying wet on the slick tile floor, legs slightly spread alluringly, and watched the gentle rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
But his uncle didn't believe him. Neither did his aunt. They seemed to think he had dangerous ideas.
Narcissa cleared the sudden lump in her throat. “Would you like to know a Black family secret?” Narcissa said whispering conspicuously, though they were the only two people in the room.
“Gentiment, madame, do not insult my mother again. I have known Hari since he was eleven years old. I know better than most that his attention is not gained by force. I won’t force him if that is what you mean."
With a frustrated huff he said, "Never mind." He decided to use his newly acquired healing skills instead. Pulling up the blood-soaked sleeve, Hari revealed the self-inflicted cut. Draco flinched but didn't complain.
The day wasn't even over yet, and Harry was already exhausted. Harry swears the goblin running his cart went on an extra long roller coaster ride, that at age eleven he thought was exhilarating but seven years later, thought it was some kind of sick revenge for what happened a few months past. They stopped first at vault 689, his trust vault with Bill's instruction took multiple bags of gold galleons to be exchanged for muggle pounds. Before he left he hunted the vault for what the Chieftess had told him to find; his birth certificate. He found it packed away in a small trunk with dragonhide bound journals, his fathers, and muggle composition notebooks, his mother's. He took the whole trunk with him and didn't open it again before Andromeda and Teddy were settled in their new rooms.
The vast majority of the time it just got him in trouble, like today. But sometimes it was helpful, like the vase his cousin had broken while infamously "Harry hunting", he found in the attic while spring cleaning two summers ago, whole once more. Or the numerous times his broken bones mended and his bruises disappeared after a particular nasty beating.
"Ssh...ssh, its alright Teddy Bear, its alright!" Miracles of miracles, Teddy quieted down, curious of the stranger holding him. Only a month old, Teddy was colorblind still, and had no control of the color his eyes or hair changed. spit bubbles emerging, Teddy's hair was now a deep fuschia color, and eyes a sickly pink-eye color.
Harry hung his head in disappointment. It just figured the giant talking snake couldn't tell him anything. Kaa seemed to pounder for a moment.
Draco and Hari were covered in mud. Hari stood a ways away from the fallen Draco. If it wasn’t for the near besotted look on her sons face, she would have said there was some type of alteration between the two and her dragon had lost.
Hari didn’t say a word, he couldn’t. He somehow found the strength to keep moving, limbs feeling heavy like wading through waist high water. With one step in front of the other, focusing on his white scruffy trainers, and the intense fiery touch of Draco Malfoy for comfort at his back. When they made it passed the customers/admirers/mob, he let out a silent breath in relief. “Thank you, Draco.” He breathed out quietly, almost inaudible beneath the rushing sound of his blood in his ears like waves crashing against a rocky coast.
Draco smiled as they proceeded to roll the ball back and forth to each other, with Teddy secure in Hari’s lap. All the while, Hari talked about how this was helping Teddy with his visual tracking and hand eye coordination.
Can you believe the possibility of me having a sibling, twenty years younger. They plan to do surrogacy. They hope for a girl and even have a name picked out. Three guesses Harry, as to what that name might be? However, they won’t be disappointed in a son. Monica, my mum, teases her husband about wishing for an intellectual child, nonetheless, seeing as the both of them couldn’t pitch a ball between the two of them.
Narcissa Malfoy felt apprehensive as she approached the drive leading up to the Manor along the large yew hedges. The walk reminded her of the first time she visited the Manor after she married Lucius, a respectable marriage in her parent’s eyes. She was fresh out of Hogwarts, so young and starry eyed over her husband; a young, rich, and pure-blood socialite like herself, never minding it was an arranged marriage. She certainly could have had worse; there was no love lost between her oldest sister, Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus Lestrange. As the youngest, Narcissa was lucky she wasn’t forced to marry an older man her father’s age, after the fiasco her second oldest sister Andromeda made over marrying a poor, mudblood, nobody. Yes Narcissa could have done much worse. The young Narcissa had no idea how wrong she truly was.
He stood up and gnawed on his thumbnail as he paced in tight circles, the limited space on the floor preventing him from going far.
It was Draco’s turn to flush. “You called me Bae; I think I get an endearment to call you.” Draco said defensively. “Besides, Bae? Where for the love of Salazar did you come up with that endearment?
With that thought in mind, Hari smiled to himself and turned his head to kiss one hollow of Draco’s high cheekbones, before offering his lips to Draco’s sensual kisses.
The blurry image shows a towering shadowy shape in the center of Diagon Alley with a tiny twig of a boy, if you can even call that tiny blob a boy, walking triple time to the giant’s one step. Obviously the pictures were taken from affair and then enhanced. No clear image was able to be obtained. If I squint and turn my head upside-down I think I can make out an owl in a cage. I wish I hadn’t taken so long in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, talking to that spec wearing messy black haired boy, I would have seen Harry Potter in person.
"Where are we being invited to, Hari?" Draco said as he sat down, picking up a red packaged candy. breaking into it and then breaking the chocolate wafer in half, he offered the rest to Hari as he crunched in. It was delicious. Draco considered the piece he just ate, eyeing the piece in Hari's hand. He quickly took back the other half from Hari and ate that as well.
Narcissa looked up at her son and saw the silent tears, the watery laugh that escaped his trembling lips involuntarily. That was when she seemingly pulled herself together. She pulled herself into the strong, proud witch her inner dragon demanded she become. She produced a handkerchief out of thin air and as the loving mother she would always be, no matter how old or far away they moved; lovingly wiped her son’s eyes. “Now, now dragon, stop crying. I didn’t raise a Hufflepuff.”
“Is that all his letter says, then?” Hari inquired. Draco tilted the parchment so they both could read the surprisingly brief letter together:
The first shop Hari decided to enter, Draco nearly baulked at the sheer amount of sleeveless thin cotton shirts and blue denim trousers with ripped knees. It wasn’t to his taste at all. Draco wouldn’t be caught dead wearing such grunge Muggle clothing.  “Look Draco I need more casual clothes for everyday use. Everything I own is old, hand me down, and washed out. Let’s go in and look around. We’ll try somethings on and you can make the final decision, alright?” Hari pleaded giving Draco a crooked smile and batting his gorgeous green eyes up at him. Draco sighed and opened the door for Hari.
Slytherin won the House cup and Harry Potter was finally able to join us. Could this day have gotten any better?
“She’s only trying to make a sale, Draco.” Hari shrugged. “It’s retail. They get paid an hourly rate, but the real money is in commissions. They get bonuses for how many customers they assist.”
Two completely irked, and flabbergasted Aurors ran up to them from the drive.“The Manor is on fire, how did this happen? What did you do?” The first arsehole of an Auror from earlier questioned accusingly. Narcissa scoffed.
One gasped out, “no” while the other turned on Draco, “Look what you’ve done. Hari Potter doesn’t want our services, because you’ve stunk up the place. Just how many respectable customers are we going to lose, because they believe you are associated to our shop?”
Hari couldn't find words, instead he sputtered, squawked, and finally hissed out Draco’s name. Stifling a giggle, Hari rested his brow against Draco’s shoulder,  effortlessly smudging it too. Draco allowed a contented hum to rumble from his throat at Hari’s eager touches.
“Don’t mention it,” Hari said gruffly. “Can I, maybe have that, I don’t have any pictures of Teddy and me, yet.”
“Um… what do you want to do first?” Draco only looked at Hari as if he grew two heads.  “Right, maybe window shop a bit?” At Draco’s raised eyebrow, he mumbled something under his breath and then chose a direction at random.  “Come on!” Hari said offering his hand. Draco slid his hand into his, before he had a chance to question if ‘come on’ counted as asking permission. Evidently it did, because Draco’s hand was met with a warm grasp instead of icy fingers. Smiling he allowed Hari to tug him along.
“I wish I could have talked with him one more time, before...I treated him so badly sixth year and all he wanted to do was help. But I arrogantly refused and he did it for me anyway. He didn't have to, to accept the Unbreakable Vow for me. I didn't deserve any of it." Draco said.
“But the connection went both ways” Hari said pausing in his caged lion pacing, raising his index finger to the ceiling. “Voldemort was much better at using Legilimency than I. What’s more, I sucked at Occlumency.” Hari said rubbing his lightning bolt scar on his forehead. “He got inside my head, implant false visions so that I would believe Sirius was captured, so that I would voluntarily leave the protection of the school. The weapon was no weapon at all, but a prophecy that only Voldemort or I could touch. Voldemort believed that the prophecy would tell him a way to kill me seeing as I already survived the killing curse once.” Draco’s hand itched desperately. He wanted to retrieve his journal and write down this information as quickly as possible.
“Yes,” Draco smirked lost in thoughts of the enigma that is Harry Potter. Draco has always wanted to know him, to understand him, and be close to him. But his father stood in the way. So, instead he taunted and teased him. Harry was slow to temper, but oh, when he is angry, his magic flares deliciously. Draco loved angering him, and he did it perfectly, his friends made perfect targets.

Sheryl laughed emphatically as she waved them in to get seated. She missed her cub, and she was glad he wasn’t so alone anymore.
“I don’t know Malfoy.” Hari said through clenched teeth, reverting back to calling Draco by his last name in reflex. Signing, “It’s complicated.” He really didn’t know why it was happening. But unfamiliar situations caused negative reactions in him. He knew in his rational brain that he was no longer in danger, but sudden noises, or an unexpected touch, and even large crowds now unsettled him. He never really liked crowds before, and now he was being suffocated with all the attention, unwanted or not, it was stressful. It was now a reoccurring situation, where he would panic and he’d withdraw inside himself, frozen, or worse his magic would rush to the surface lashing out violently. Somehow Draco’s touch calmed him and he was grateful for the git, nonetheless.
After they ate, Draco accioed his Nimbus 2001 from the quidditch shed and traded turns flying around the yard, doing aerial tricks to impress Hari.
“Good, very good. Now, wrap like healing bandagesss.” This reminded Harry of how he had wrapped a blanket similarly around Dobby’s lifeless body at Shell Cottage before burying him, and choked up a little. Harry watched with halted breath as his emerald colored magic was met with copper magic and wrapping around Kreacher. “Copper isss like the tassste of blood, and isss the color of magic for all thingsss living.  Your Kreacher livesss now.”
Of course. How could he be so utterly idiotic to forget the portrait of Hari’s Godfather and his second cousin, Sirius Black.
This reminded him horribly of the time he had a similar incident whilst at Hogwarts. He had panicked and snuck into the shared toilet to rinse out the mess in the sink. He remembered thinking he’d be caught and hackled mercilessly by his dormmates. But he managed it without getting caught.
Really, they couldn’t complain as they could be in an Azkaban prison cell awaiting trial for being war criminals, but instead they were provided with three (questionable and near inedible) meals a day, a small double (lumpy and uncomfortable) cot to share, and clean (chafing) clothes. It was the bare necessities but anything was better than one uncertain meal a day, no cot, no shower, and Dementors as their guards. It gave Narcissa a warm feeling inside knowing that her husband was in Azkaban while his wife and son where here.
He finally seceded.  He was surprised that there were no feelings of bitterness at losing to Hari. No, he settled back, his alpha content to just watch Hari enjoy his food.
“Hello!!!” A friendly voice called out to them. “What can I be doing for ya lads? Who are you shopping for?” A man that approached them had big white teeth and brown eyes.
Hari scrambled up, and Draco reached up to stop him afraid he had taken his teasing too far. Hari only swatted his hand away and proceeded to strip his nightshirt from his body. He only wobbling slightly, inhibited by alcohol. He didn't fall and Draco's breath froze in his chest.
Connor turned his daughter around in his arms. “You don’t go racing into the street without us; you got that Mary-chop?”
Harry Potter took Kreacher and cradled him in his arms as he ascended the grand staircase in the entrance hall, Asclepius (Ask-lep-ee-us) twisting and winding his way up the banister in his wake. Once on the
Properly mortified at the realization that Draco gave him a hickey and he hadn’t noticed, he clamped a hand to his neck where he could still feel Draco’s lips.
Hari searched Draco’s eyes. “You do that.” Shaking off the shift in mood, he instead asked, “So, is it a boyfriend’s shirt type of thing?” He tried again as he searched through more clothes.
“I had to borrow an old Potions book sixth year, and it turned out to be Professor Snape’s. Hogwarts curriculum is very messed up, if most of the textbooks are the same after twenty years.” Hari said. “How did you recognize that spell? Did he teach it to all the Slytherin’s?”
“Right, if you can’t be seen with me as I am, maybe dating isn’t such a good idea.” Hari’s spat out. His heart felt trampled on. Maybe being physically attracted to the blonde didn’t mean he actually liked him. He went to move away, but was suddenly slammed up against the wardrobe doors. He heard a growling noise close to his ears that he figured came from the stained glass door. He looked up, expecting to see Draco angry in turn, but found him in a panic instead.
Draco, however; never gave up on his attempt to join once more with the Wizarding World. Draco first stop was Ollivander’s to purchase a new wand for the two of them.  When he arrived, Mr. Ollivander was tolerable to his presence in his shop even after the cellar renovated cell incident during the war. He was in the process of having what must have been the hundredth wand reject him when Mr. Ollivander’s nieces came crashing through the door, miraculously or rather magically, the spiraling tower of wand boxes remained stacked.  It was them that refused him service and ran him out of the wand shop to the waiting crowd outside Ollivander’s. Due to the same arsehole Aurors useless presence assigned as security detail to him, stood aside as the mob threw bloody rocks at him. Rocks! Savages all of them. Draco came back to the Manor with a horizontal cut on his left cheekbone, and scrapes and bruises upon his body. Draco and Narcissa continue to remain wandless.
Narcissa straightened on a pleased laugh. Hari chuckled along. “All aunt Dorea did was use transfiguration to make the candles and sell those, without giving away the secret.''And so clapping her hand on Hari’s shoulder, led him back into the outer room.
"I know and that is why all is forgiven." Sheryl said running fingers over his scalp. "You don't know much about the LGBQT+ community, do you?" Sheryl asked.
Hari was impressed and as such felt equally challenged to do the same. Zipping around the yard, zig-zagging around trees and shooting straight up into the air and diving in a spiral. When he zipped around Draco’s stunned form and braked hard causing him to whip around in a half circle before breaking mid-flight.
She paused as if to interject with her finger raised in the air, and then shrugged it aside, choosing instead to go back to her own warm bed instead. They were already on their landing, anyway.
Cursing the air blue, face red and sweat beading at his temple, he waited with barely controlled screams of pain for his house-elf to appear with the salve to once again numb his hand from the pain. What was taking that blasted house-elf so long to return.
Harry's vision suddenly blurred and he didn't realize he was crying until a teardrop splashed onto his hand. He looked down in bewilderment at his shaking hand, not believing his emotions.
Hari sat dumbfounded. Draco looked up from his cleaning to see Hari’s gaze. Supporting his weight on one hand by Hari’s head, he dipped his other fingers low and Hari felt Draco’s fingers trail over his  cum splattered chest and raised them to Hari’s lips.
Doxies were fairy-like creatures with black coarse hair all over their bodies, double set of limbs, and an extra row of sharp teeth, with a venomous bite. As for the Bogart, well; no one knew the true form of a Bogart, as it is a shapeshifting creature that takes the form of that which is most feared by the person who encounters it. It’s not like Harry could just call someone to terminate pests like Muggle’s would. Then he heard Hermione’s persistent voice in his head, screaming at him,
When Draco remained silent, Hari got the engine going again, proclaiming. “Come on, I’ll have to shrink the bike. There is no good parking.”
The next day, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, and Hari, took the tube. It was on this day that Hari went anywhere extensive outside suburbia, of Little Whinging, Surrey. In little Whinging, everyone was essentially the same, same tidy houses, same neat little square lawns. Only behind closed doors would an outsider know something was amiss. Inside the walls of Number 4 Private Drive, you wouldn’t know that there weren’t only three people living there but four. There was no sign of Hari Potter in that household; no smiling pictures of him on the walls, no signs of a fourth set of shoes by the door, no room that belonged just to him. Hari hadn’t any new possessions, everything he owned were just old hand-me-down clothes and broken toys from Dudley, and a broom cupboard with cot to sleep on, or be locked away in when company was over.
“I don’t remember Sirius ever mentioning a study. Where is it.” Harry inquired as he swiveled his head around to take in all the detail.
If you looked passed the exterior, the heart of the area, the people, were open and welcoming to everyone. Which is why, Hari felt comfortable surrounded by the strange and weirdly beautiful people who frequented the area; although, Hari had to protest verbosely to a teasing Sheryl that he wasn’t gay each and every time he stepped through the door.
Harry looked around frantic, not knowing what to do. So far, all he has ever been able to do is unlock doors, vanish glass, and heal wounds (Two of those were involuntary) . No, no, no, no, no!
incantation to wake Draco up, when he began to stir. Draco mumbled something incoherently and pressed his body closer to Hari's. Hari's relief was short lived, as he realized that Draco was rubbing is hardening member against Hari's thigh provocatively. Hari felt the hard press of it against his thigh.
Resigned, having no where else to go, he bowed his head under the flap. Lifting his head, his eyes widened and his mouth dropped.
Hari, uncomfortable with the formality had tried to convince the house-elf to relax some of their house-elf codes to servitude, to no avail. Trying to argue with house-elf logic was pointless; Kreacher still wanted to have his head shrunk and mounted on the wall with the rest of his family. With yet another compromise Hari shrunk those heads down small and then hide them behind vases of flowers. Kreacher accepted this. So in the entrance hall vases of flowers where seen, freshly changed each morning from the garden.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, the Wizengamot has come to a consensus,” Draco couldn’t believe such a quick verdict was made after only a reading of a letter. Well almost, Bloody Saint Potter always got his way. Still he waited with halted breath, “all criminal charges have been dropped, you were a minor forced to take the Dark Mark under duress, you are free to go home.” The shackles around Draco’s wrists clanked to the floor, Draco stood up in a daze absently rubbing his wrists.
“What’s your favorite colour, Draco?” Hari suddenly blurted out when they found a small food stand and sipped from plastic straws in an outdoor picnic table.
Harry James Potter is not her son. She would give him a place to stay until the blood magic that protected him wore off or the Dark Lord who murdered her sister was killed or locked up for good. She and her husband would be compensated for fostering the boy. She would feed, clothe, and provide a roof over his head as was requested of her, but she didn't have to like the situation, nor did she have to love her nephew.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
With a happy nod, Harry skipped behind Trout as he made his way to the farmers market. He wanted onions, celery, mushrooms, and garlic. If he could get his hands on it, oregano, parsley, and thyme. It was going to be a feast. Harry never ate so fine as he did with Trout.
Draco took the book back from Hari and flipped a few pages to the back. Almost like old families added births of children to an old bible, a list of names and letters were written in neat columns.  Draco pointed out a name at the top of the list. "Ursula Flint, the only known omega in the Black line through marriage, had five children, only omega to have her beat in amount of children born is Molly Prewett with seven children, all gingered and speckled." Draco laughed.
As prescribed in his Last Will and Testament, Lucius A. Malfoy’s remains will be prepared for embalming and transportation to the Lord and Lady Malfoy Mausoleum located on the Malfoy Estate, Wiltshire, England no more than five days after death, bringing the date to 24th June, 1998.
Hesitantly and as quietly as possible he inched open the door, keeping a sharp ear out for the sound of his relatives awakening. He heard his uncles snores interrupted by a particularly loud snort, and then silence. Harry held his breath until he heard the snores resume. If he listened closer he could also hear the nasally snores of his aunt that sounded like the whiney of a horse. His cousin would be the hardest to hear. He didn't have a distinguishing breathing pattern while sleeping, yet. Instead of snoring or heavy breathing, he listened for the sound of squeaking floorboards overhead. Dudley would often get up in the middle of the night for midnight snacks, or to use the toilet. He listened closely for any signs of wakefulness. When he heard neither the sound of squeaky floorboards or the sound of the toilet flushing, he elected to wait ten more seconds. Just in case.
Vernon, snarled once, before going upstairs to tuck Dudley in bed. Petunia stepped into the living room, seeing her vase, the twin to her sister's, whole once more. As if by magic. The wonder on her face was replaced by fear. Turning to the cupboard, she was relieved to find it closed and locked. Vernon checked for himself on the way back downstairs that the boy was still locked securely in the cupboard. Grunting once, he made his way to the kitchen.
Draco snickered at Hari’s clumsiness, doctoring his own tea with a splash of cream and tablespoon of honey, he blew pointedly before taking his own sip.
“Wh...ah...what?” Draco said, caught off guard by Hari’s remark. He wasn’t aware that Hari knew he was into magical art, at all. His father never even knew.
“Oh, wouldn’t Hermione be happy then? I’d officially be a member of S.P.E.W…hic…I…I think I’m going to spew, actually.” With a horrified squeak, and quick reflexes, Kreacher was able to get Harry's head over a bucket, before he made a horrid mess of the antique desk.
The man only sighed long suffering, and pushed over a tray of sweetener. He then refilled Harry's cup and topped off his much larger one.
Potter lay collapsed on the ground beneath Draco, trapped beneath his deadweight, inadvertently locked together for the unforeseeable future, until Draco’s knot released enough cum to shrink. With each short spurt of cum, Potter shuddered as his prostrate was over stimulated.
Draco didn't expect to comforting a weeping Hari. Not knowing what to do he looked around in haste, before scooping Hari in a more comfortable position against his chest and just let him cry. His heart was racing a mile a minute, as he just held Hari for the longest time, waiting for the tears o subside.
Draco’s head jerked in his hands, he coughed and sputtered as hot strings of cum ribboned out of Hari and covered Draco’s face in hot spunk. Like accepting a gift, Draco opened his mouth and aloud the last ribbons to hit his tongue, and he swallowed.
"Hari? Where are we going?" He mumbled barely clearing his toes over each step. They tripped and stumbled into the hall on the next landing.
"No, Never mind that." Narcissa waved the answer away before the words could even form out of Hari's mouth.
The walls of the long hallway were lit with poorly dusted gas lamps, to show peeling wallpaper, and carpets worn thin.
No words were spoken once the crypt was sealed on the Lord's and Lady's Mausoleum. The hand holding Hari's gave a sharp tug as Draco suddenly pulled Hari around and along the wide sweep of grass to the nearest apparition point.
The Leaky Cauldron as it was called, was dark and shabby looking. Its air is clogged with smoke from cigars and tobacco pipes. It irritated Draco’s eyes and he did his best, and failed in his attempts, to make it look like he wasn’t glaring about the room.
Harry would have never thought he took advantage of having a cupboard to sleep in each night. At least it kept him out of the cold wind and damp mornings. Finding shelter at night was getting harder to find. He didn't have enough money to pay for room and board somewhere, and he frugal with the money he pilfered from his Aunt Petunia's purse. Harry found himself sleeping on park benches and in the shadow of stoops.
Criminal trials in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement are held in the basement level of the Ministry of Magic beneath London. The accused are held secure in chained chairs in the center of a giant colosseum like hexagon chamber where fifty members of the Wizengamot sit above on benches, wearing plum colored robes with giant silver “W” embroidered on their chests. Along with the Judge, Prosecutor, Jurors, and Scribe; the Chief Warlock, the Head of the Wizengamot, and the Minister of Magic reside. Most trials are brief and concise, where the accused may present witnesses to be questioned by the Prosecutor.
"But..." Draco began on a hiss as he stretched his long limbs up to the sky. "I'm not the only one who misses his godfather. You miss yours too, right Hari? I am sorry Sirus was killed. My aunt Belatrix was boasted about killing him. Did you know, he was innocent all along?” Draco asked hesitantly.
He gave the garment an experimental sniff before recoiling with a grimace on his face. Throwing down the offensive piece of clothing, Hari looked around at the mess of his room. The contents of his school trunk were sprawled around the room, mostly junk, including old and forgotten school supplies such as books, crumpled parchment, broken quill tips, shattered inkwells, and empty chocolate frog boxes. Considering Hari’s trunk wasn't multi-compartmental and he’d never used any shrinking charms, it was difficult to believe how much junk—he meant stuff—had actually fit in it.
You wouldn't even know that there was a fourth occupant of number 4 Privet drive outside school records and dusty social workers files, of course. Not most neighbours, nor work colleagues.  In the house that he didn't call home, he lived like a dirty secret hidden in the broom cupboard beneath the stairs.
Draco heard a gasp from beside him and turned to face is mother. She was looking down at the slip of paper the Minister had given her. Looking down at his own slip of paper, he read and wondered what the words meant.
At her intense stare, Hari turned bright red and wouldn’t meet her eyes. Draco was the first to recover. He coughed once and stood, his movement forcing Hari to take a step back. Draco became acutely aware of his half-dressed state as another shiver passed through him, though it lacked less intensity of the others.  Spotting the forgotten charcoal shirt at his feet, Draco bent down to retrieve the garment. Unbeknown to Draco, Hari stood transfixed at the sight of the muscles rippling down his back. When he stood back up, Hari quickly looked away, embarrassed by the possibility of being caught.
Harry approached the homeless man's tent warrily. He still heard the cussing from within the thin barrier walls of the shelter. If there was a place to knock, he'd knock, as it where, he chose to call out.
Intrigued at the idea of another surprise, she patted Harry's cheek absentmindedly murmured, "Call me Narcissa" and walked the rest of the the way through the grass, not bothering with the pathway. Smiling Harry was looking over his shoulder at Narcissa and didn't see Draco emerge around the shed he hid behind when shockingly, his mother ran to embrace Hary on the lawn.
Harry Potter can’t be ordinary can he? He defeated the Dark Lord when he was an infant, was it all a fluke?  Maybe not, Mister Harry I-can-take-on-a-troll-and-live –to-tell-the-tell-Potter, did it again.
The blonde boy glanced up from his companion to look around, revealing cool grey eyes on an emotionless face. He was just her type; tall, aloof, and sophisticated.
The seed burst into flames but instead of turning to ash, a tiny green seedling emerged from the crack. Narcissa levitated the seedling into the cauldron.
“Start in Dray’s room. He hasn’t been out in there in days.” Hari said, not turning from the stovetop. Draco flushed scarlet once more. Hari was going to turn him into a Gryffindor with the amount of red that stains his cheeks, or oh Salazar forbids,
He heard another yell, not his and not the man trying to kill him. The grip on his ankle let go, and Harry scrambled with all his wirely arm strength up onto the platform. Breaking heavily he backed up a few more feet while on his back.
"Don't you dare give me that crap, Albus. Three letters! Three!" Minerva strode up to his desk and struck out her fingers in emphasis.
Hari listened with only have an ear as he let Sirius run through his spiral, but he detached from his emotions. When Sirius was done talking, he tilted his head to the side and asked in a pseudo calm voice. "So which is it then?"
"Minnie, I couldn't allow that. You're a teacher, not a mother."  The words came as a soft blow on Minerva's head.
“I’m not getting out of Azkaban, Mother, you are? I’m doing all this cooperating to get you a lighter sentence."
Hari had the wildest idea that Dudley, his cousin and Cho Chang, a witch, were somehow dating. An introduction was best in order. But Hari and Cho stumbled over each other in their introductions.
True to Narcissa’s word, the house-elves vetted each owl; rather, Kreacher did this, as he insisted vehemently was his job. Instead of clambering for the recipient's attention, each of the three owls waited patiently in the pot and pan rack above the kitchen table.
“Yes, but this time it affects us more than just compiling evidence against Father and the others.” He paused,” Mother come sit down next to me”. So, Narcissa complied, still managing to look elegant and graceful even without thousand galleon worth of fine dressrobes and French dresses. Draco took a deep and shaky breath, and Narcissa knew something was the matter if her son was this physically shaken up that his perfect Malfoy mask slipped.
“Do you, Hari James Potter, so swear to uphold the honour and responsibility bestowed in you by heading two of the Most Ancient and Noble Houses, the House of Black and the House of Potter?”
Harry knew that vase was special to his aunt, and that Dudley would blame it on him. Wiping away sudden tears, he tried to hold back sniffles. In his young heart, he wished that the vase could somehow magically repair itself.
“Oh, blood ritual. Like blood sacrifice? I don’t know…” Hari asked hesitantly. He clenched his scarred arm subconsciously remembering that his blood was used to bring back Voldemort’s full body form.
“I…I really couldn’t… ma’am. Take handouts, that is. I…ah…could work for it…” The person he now took to be named Sheryl, threw up her hands, rolled her eyes, and shook her head, all at once, her gold bangles on her wrists clanging together. Whoever hurt this boy, at least didn’t stomp out his manners and work ethic. She thought.
I was worried sick. Surely he was killed, drained of blood, changed into a vampire or vampire slave. I was nearly hysterical. I can't believe I blubbered that bad. The only thoughts in my head were, "I wanted to be his friend."
Then again, how much suffering could he take before he lashed out anyway and left? He could just chop it up to them having too much bad blood between them to live healthily together. Draco wasn’t worried about his mother being forced to leave in that case. Hari said that they were there because Teddy needed family, that wouldn’t change with him gone.
Their first date ended on the stoop of 12 Grimmauld Place wrapped in each other's arms. What was supposed to be a simple kiss at the door turned into a heavy makeout session.They paid no attention to the Muggles walking just beyond the wrought iron gate, hidden as they were, behind fidelius charm and anti-Muggle wards.
Hari thought of the kitchen as his private safe haven, even Kreacher knew not to interrupt him when he was on a cooking spree.
Right as he said that, he felt a shift in the wards once more, not to different from when Kingsley tried to Floo in. The main difference being, they were invited in and the wards will automatically accept them. The reason he had Kingsley tell them the secret entrance was because Mad-Eye Moody's booby-trap was still at guard at the front door, and it was a pain. Bill Weasley said he'll come by in a few days and sort it out, he tried a number of things that same day he, Andromeda, and Teddy visited the bank. And wasn't that a trip all on its own. He now had access to his wizards gold at Gringotts and access to Muggle money he put in an account with Our Ally Banking, and he now had a London Driver's License, Passport, and fancy high end credit card with the names Hari J. Potter on them.
"No, Alleycat. I'm clean. No drugs. Just food--vegetables. And cider or vinegar for that pickling." Trout said nodding to the still unopened mason jar in Harry's hands. "What you say Alleycat?"
landing was the master bedroom that Andromeda claimed as her's and Teddy's. There of course, was a generously sized en suite bathroom. This room use to be Walburga's room and even the Hippogriff Buckbeak's at one time. Andromeda knew about the old occupants but never complained to Hari about it. Once Teddy was older he would have the smaller second bedroom on this floor as his nursery and bedroom. It was once the room Ron and he once shared.
To Draco’s surprise, Hari didn’t immediately explode. “Huh, that makes sense. “ Hari instead paused with consideration. “The twins were a handful, always pranking people. Who knows what they could have done if allowed magic. They did more goofing off than helping when they did turn of age. I don’t really know about Charlie or Bill, seeing as they moved out by the time I met the family.” Hari said, not unreasonably.
“Of course he plays. He is a very happy baby.” Hari insisted. “Although what we call playing is a bit different for him at this age. What you sketched was called belly time. Teddy has to learn to strengthen developing muscles in his neck to hold his head up. As of right now, he doesn’t like it very much, but soon he will be rolling around on the floor, crawling, or he might skip the crawling and go straight into walking. But that isn’t for a while yet. So you want to play with us?”
"I just don't want you to get hurt. I don't think he is good for you. I want you to be sure, before you jump into any commitment..Speaking of commitments, what about Ginny?"
Hari’s mouth was parted in a slight oh. “I didn’t know you knew how to cook.” He said, astounded. Narcissa wrinkled her nose and Hari knew where Draco got that habit from.
Leading the way back to the ground floor, Hari carest the banister and it came alive with a hissing greeting from Asclepius. Draco jumped back with a very unmanly yelp. Hari laughed as he hissed a greeting back at the carved snake that had become his mentor in healing the last couple weeks.
“Strength of the earth, I beseech you.” She called. There was a gentle tremble in the ground, the soil turned over and the roots of the plants in the garden shiften then settled. Hari notes that Andromeda is actually barefoot, her soft green robe reveals one pale calf.
With a mighty roar of laughter from Hari the water games were on. They chased each other in the back garden, sun finally falling behind the wall to cast them in twilight shadow. They were positively soaked to the bone, muddy from a few slips on wet grass, and sides ached from laughter. Draco lifted Hari to dangle horizontally in his arms, one arm hoisting him beneath the knee the other underneath the armpit, and spun in dizzying circles. Water continued to spray around them from wands somehow still clutched in mud splotched fists. On the third rotation, Draco’s heel slipped and they came down hard in a mud puddle that splashed them both past their chins.
“Pretty much...the Chieftess told me to write this statement, “The Goblins will not stand for theft and withholding of clientele’s gold entrusted in us, as such, Goblins Global Guild must remind you of the treaty of 1726, ‘No Witch or Wizard of the ilk represented in the elected offices of Magicks shall henceforth have any legal or authoritative powers over the contents in clientels vaults higher than the Chieftess herself, in penalty of this act shall have access to personnel vaults sealed, liquidated, and wealth distributed elsewhere at the pleasure of her greatness.’”
"Good, I rather fancy always playing black. You see that's my mother's maiden name, and despite popular belief; the player who takes the initiative doesn't always have the inherent advantage."
“I mean, the statute of secrecy says we have to dress up as Muggles when in King’s Cross, but never in such plebeian clothes as I’ve seen you lot wear. I simply can’t be seen on a date with you wearing such… rags.” Draco continued searching through his clothes. It took him a moment to realize that Hari was no longer searching with him, and looking up, found himself meeting Hari’s furious green eyes.
Harry was trying to absorb as much information as possible, but knew that he would have to get a Pensive to re-watch all these memories again.  The Chieftess goblin was shuffling yet another stack of papers around in front of her, when a motion out of his peripheral vision caught his eye. It was another goblin with two humans following in toe. Wide eyed, Harry realized it was Bill Weasley and his wife, Fleur. The Chieftess ignored there presents though, and Harry was forced to so as well. Taking out some parchment, she handed over some documents, " here is a quick rundown of some of your estates, investment, net worth; you'll see we already deducted the payment of damages when you broke into the vault, the escape, and Death Gratuity of the families of goblins killed during the breakout." With a rye smile the chieftess continued. "You have made some goblins very happy, indeed Mr. Potter. You, are responsible for the payment not your two friends, as they currently do not hold an account with us, and we goblins know they could never afford it anyway."
“Yes but your forgetting something, Draco. I don’t care! Which means laughing at your attempts to fix yours all the more funny.”
All he wanted to do was lock himself away from the rest of the world so he could spend the remainder of his pre-rut in peace. Or as his alpha kept suggesting not so gently in the back of his mind, drag Hari into his room and ravish him.
What's one more to add to the numerous ones Hari's attended. Fred's, Collin's, Lupin's, Tonks', and so many others of those who fought and died in the war. Hari thought he would always carry around the guilt for the rest of his life.
Trying to wake up a portrait when they were asleep was a hard thing to do. That's all they did most of the day anyway. Sirius was a particular heavy sleeper. Tapping on his frame didn't help. In the end, Hari tipped the portrait upside down, nearly flipping Sirius out of the portrait to wake him up.
I was so worried he was so tiny next to the other players. The Captain of the Slytherin team was a sixth year, Marcus Flint. A real piece of work, with bad teeth. The Slytherin team had a habit of choosing their players for their brute strength rather than their brains. A shame because the Slytherin house is known for its cunningness. If I were on the team, if I was captain, I'd turn the whole ethnics of the team around.
Harry and Andromeda stopped nearly tripping over each other, or else crash into the goblin who stopped in front of a large circular stone door. Raising his finger he carefully traced an unrecognizable rune into the stone and watched like the entrance to Diagon Alley from the back of the Leaky Cauldron, brick began to shift and flip in on themselves slowly forming a wide arching doorway. "Enter."
Flipping through pages and pages of article clippings and pictures of Hari as a boy, he watched him age through the eyes of the film. First Year, Second Year, Third Year, Fourth Year. He paused, his breath was shallow and ragid. He thumbed back a couple of pages, this was the image that started his lustful thoughts. It wasn't even that great a picture, just one of the numerous shots he paid Colin Creevey to take. Later on he would pay Rita Skeeter, and oh boy was that a mistake for the lies she told, but her quality of pictures were much better. The picture he looked at now was a blurry picture of Hari after completing the second task, he was topless, skranny, and shivering from the cold, reaching for a towel that this film would never capture him grasping. What was it about this picture that turned him on, at fourteen, confused at his reaction for a boy he believed he hated. Looking back, was this obsessive journal he looked through now, the thoughts about a boy he loathed, or secretly loved?
Draco gave a long exhale, before nosing up his neck. The sensation of each breath on his skin both seductive and ticklish.
Alleycat sat down with a plomp on a couch-esk cushion pile, dust dispersed into cloud around him. He flicked his bangs off his hot forehead momentarily, before they settled down, hiding from view the briefly revealed scar on his left side forehead over his brow.
The large fireplace stood proud with an elaborate snake decorated mantle place, bookend by two tall glass cabinets. The cabinets once held jars of dark potions, dark artifacts, and Salazar Slytherin’s locket that Voldemort turned into a Horcrux. Harry’s eyes were drawn to an item he’s overlooked in the past.
Humming and skipping about, Kreacher busidly prepares a quick breakfast, consisting of a warm cuppa and hot buttered scones.
"In addition to healing the ley lines, the Cup, although made by goblins,was defiled by Dark Magic, then belonged to Voldemort because of..." The chieftess looked over at Andromeda, hesitating on saying this last part, but Harry immediately understood and in that split second, decided to trust Andromeda.
The parlour was an exquisite room, if a bit dusty. Harry could actually see what the room might look like once it was cleared out, furniture restored, and antiques polished. Harry imagined it would clean up nicely once the Doxies were cleared out of the curtains and Bogart in the desk disposed of.
"What?" Draco said, "I don't know you. I would have been seven, eleven years ago. If I was incompetent, I would have thought you mistook me for my father; however, you said my given name and not my sur name."
"I will show you my dragon as often as you want, he's preening at the thought, now actually. But uh...I'd rip my clothes if I shift fully...wings you know, and my trousers." He suddenly perked up, leering actually. "I could get naked." Draco said excited as he went to raise his body away from Hari's.
Draco then paused in his orders. Looked around the foyer and watched all the portraits smirking, sneering, or shouting vulgarity at them. With a smirk of his own, Draco says to Dot, “I will also need you to empty the vaults and trunks of all portraits of Malfoy by blood. Get all other portraits into the vaults. Bring me all portraits with the surname or maiden name Black, do that first.” Dot disapperated away with a crack, only to return with a few select portraits.
