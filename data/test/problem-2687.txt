Potter looked up just as Draco was about to sit near the window, and with a waving arm the twerp beckoned for him to come over.
While the need for frequent touches has certainly subsided, it seems to have been replaced in Potter with an ongoing need to stare and smile. Draco's used to the staring—it started at their Sorting in First Year and has never abated—but the smiling, that's new.
"Ooh, that's a cool kettle," Harry said. "How do you keep the copper so—"
“I’ll take it.” Draco handed some Galleons to the woman and slipped the ring into his pocket.

this pregnancy. Or very excited by the prospect of… of a baby.”
No, that's not true. One thing will. One thing, but Draco won't give in to it. Not now that they're so close to finding out who cast the curse. Not when he knows how touchy Potter is about them doing anything...
“Not one bit. And anyway, even if it was, you’ve more than earned a bit of selfishness.”
“And Draco Malfoy," Kreacher interrupted, "is that Mistress 'Cissa's boy?"
It was a gruesome tale to say the least. The roommates were both only twenty years old. But something had felt off about it. It niggled at Draco.
And Draco blushed from his toes to the tips of his ears and felt like maybe, no matter the contest outcome, he'd already won.
Moving behind Harry, Malfoy placed his hands on Harry’s waist and all Harry could do was moan at the feeling and let his head and neck go slack. Music pulsed through his body—he could almost see the waves of it swirl around them like magic. Maybe it
Draco was pleased to awaken the next morning feeling rested and refreshed. Which made him wonder if in fact Potter'd had the right of it, that it would have been hasty to trouble St Mungo's about their little predicament.
Draco rolls his eyes.
“Impressive? Captivating? Hot? That’ll be the Shacklebolt genes. Everyone fancies Minister Shacklebolt.”
Harry laughed as he heaved them both off the bed, taking the opportunity to wriggle his fingers into Draco's ribs for a sly revenge tickle. The squawk from his husband and cuff around the ear reminded him that, cheesy as it was, there really

“Oh, was that what that was? How silly of me. I hadn’t realised it was a peace negotiation when I was on my arse, seeing swirling stars and little tweeting birds.”
Harry nods and cries.
Draco sprang away from Gabriel and stood up. "Potter, You’re— I— It's not…"
"I bloody have! And anyway it's—"
Harry chanced a look at Draco, who was staring on in disbelief.
Jeffrey wrings his hands and then shakes his head. "Thanks. I think I should stay though and attempt to undo some of the damage done by our so-called
Jeffrey's trembling hand presses the wand into Draco's palm, and then he retreats to a far corner.
"I think the memories I call up are all… tainted? As in, happy at the time, but looking back they make me sad, too. In context."
Draco hesitated. "Well. We, ah…"

Potter laughed. “It’s possibly a bit more of a Gryffindor-style truce than you’re used to, I’ll give you that.”
“Imbecile!” I loosen his restraints. “You’ve just ruined it, and we’ll need to start all over again!”

It was only Draco fucking Malfoy.
Magister Placid glares at Jeffrey. But Jeffrey nods his head, bottom lip trembling. It's all the answer Potter needs before he's taking a step towards the Magister, wand raised.

Draco caught up to Potter as he was getting into the lift with a few others to go down to reception. He slid into the lift sideways just as the doors were closing, thankful they didn’t close on his bump.
Draco's Silencing spell cuts him short.
The feeling was unlike anything Harry had ever felt. It was warmth and love and safety and pleasure. It was just two people, two bodies, but it felt like life itself. He wanted to feel more and more of Draco wrapped around him. He wrapped his hands around Draco’s waist, and inhaled into his shoulder. Had Draco always smelled this fantastic? If he’d only known.
“What's wrong, Jamie?” Harry asked him. “Have your Crunchy Nut Cornflakes wronged you?”
With the sound of boots clicking on floorboards preceding him, Harry walked into the sitting room, and Draco's breath caught.
"Oh my god," Harry said, overcome.
(Luna), well, Harry reasoned the only way to get them to stop with their hippy dippy bullshit was to humour them. What was one night of loud music and crowds and noise and drunken dancing? He could handle it. Couldn’t be harder than battling Voldemort for seven straight years, could it? Or more difficult than the pain and exertion of rebuilding Hogwarts, brick by brick and spell by spell? And maybe, just maybe, it would be good for him—let no one say he wasn't open to this shit.
“Merlin, what
Draco did, and he closed his eyes and let his head flop back on the sofa. His ankles and toes were throbbing and the baby seemed to be doing yoga sun salutations in his tummy. The wee thing had been non-stop today, moving and rolling about. It was as if it sensed that his emotions had been up and down and wanted to join in.
"Joanna," Potter soothes, shooting Draco another look, concerned this time. "Joanna, you can tell us what happened." He sits down next to her on the floor.
"You know what, Potter," Draco paused, "
. Draco had expected constant interjections and scoffs of disbelief, disdain and dismissal. But Potter was listening, really listening to him. How bizarre it felt to have Harry Potter held captive on his every word. Bizarre, and a little bit addictive.
"Do what?" Draco enquired, his eyes fixed on Hestia and Mrs Potts.
"You did it," Malfoy says.
“Er, thanks. Yeah, maybe I will.”
"Potter, please, it's not what you think," Draco pleaded, but Potter had already turned and was walking away. "Potter, wait!"
"Well, it was small little shocks when we... when we t-touched, but as the days went by they became more intense and painful, I think it increased every time we went into our bedroom, until we were just too afraid to touch any more, because it had got so sore, and also b-because it made us cry out, and then... and then..."
Service came to a close, and they all pitched in clearing up the restaurant. Titpie set all the plates, cutlery, pots, and pans to cleaning with some well-placed charms. Tiptoe took care of Scourgifying, Spritzifying and Scrubbifying all the work surfaces. Pineneedle and the other waiters looked after the remaining customers—and made sure they paid their Galleons—and Wattlepot (Norma), his front desk assistant, ensured they all got the correct robes, and of course the correct pointy hats for those Wixes who still wore them.
He stood up. "Wait!” They turned to look at him. “Granger. She's… she’s with me."
photographing him—so many wizards have Muggle phones these days.”
He couldn't let Potter find out just who ‘Marco A. Floyd' was. If he did, Potter would most certainly write a shitty review of the restaurant, irrespective of how delicious his meal had been.
After about forty minutes of reading and jotting down more questions for the next day, Potter dozed off, slumping against Draco's chest. Draco didn't move him, and after a minute or two, when he was sure Potter was properly asleep, he pressed his lips gently against Potter's forehead. The relief felt like sipping a chilled Chardonnay, like a cool shower after a sweaty duelling session.
It was a pernicious strain of the Black Cat Flu that did for her. Crippling to most, but deadly to the elderly.
. And I think if one were allowed to—" Draco makes a choking sound. "It could be—" The blotches are getting worse.
“Yeah. And I suppose not wanting to find the father is a symptom of that.”
“So, your homework is to practice carefully enveloping something, a doll, a plant, even a pet in your Patronus. Non-corporeal, remember—it won’t do to shoot a panther or an eagle at the poor thing—so that you’ll be able to do it without a second thought once the baby comes!”
Another voice: "There is no escape. You
There's a gasp from someone—Draco suspects Jeffrey—as a small carved-out cubbyhole is revealed, clearly hollowed out by hand. Inside lies a sheaf of papers which Draco retrieves.
He realises with a wry chuckle that he’s put his lucky pants on. The classy black ones that Ginny bought him, back when they were a thing. Not a Snitch or a dragon or a Quidditch logo in sight. The ones he wears when he thinks he might pull. So, subconsciously, he
As Draco begins to ask what exactly is behind the painting, not wishing to go blindly poking around in that room again if he can help it, Joanna's eyes fill with tears and her sobs start anew.
"I'm serious!" Potter said, laughing. "Just regular touching when we need it,
He was busy instructing two of his commis chefs, Tiptoe and Titpie (Dirk and Belinda), utter dossers the pair of them, on how to slice the dirigible plums for the fruit crumbles without them floating away, when Pineneedle slipped back into the kitchen, interrupting him.
"Oh my God, Malfoy," Potter groaned. "That feels..." He breathed in and out deeply, seemingly composing himself. "Okay, okay. If it doesn't go away by tomorrow we'll go to St Mungo's."
"Halloween, silly daddy!" cried Teddy through his yellow velvet beak, and he jumped up and down, wings flapping.

sex. But he knew enough to know that his senses were likely to be so heightened right now that his entire body was one big erogenous zone, receptive to the slightest stimulation.
When their drinks arrived, Draco was already part-way through a summary of his travels through parts of Europe—France, Germany, Italy, Spain—where he'd found the Muggle British holidaymakers to be most irksome: always asking him if he missed 'home' and telling him how there was 'no place like it' and how good it always felt to get back to Blighty after their holiday. He supposed that, being Muggle, the after-effects of the war, or indeed its occurrence at all, were largely lost on them.

“Speaking of, ah, biological parents. I was thinking about your situation. I may be speaking out of turn here, but couldn't you just get a Healer to perform a paternity charm on the men you’ve been with? Then you'd know.”

are anything to go by. But swearing off it for the rest of your life seems a little extreme. You do know how long wizards live for, don't you?" Potter’s eyes widened, realisation dawning. Draco smirked. “I do hope your hands are up to the job of keeping you satisfied for the next hundred years.”
“But I got you good that time with the Bat-Bogey Hex.”
"The book you requested, Master," the elf says, holding out the leather-bound tome.
"Yes." Draco clears his throat. "Well, the book said that the curse could be dissolved if those afflicted were strong of heart, which can be taken to mean..." Merlin, why was it so hard to say this? "...to mean, those who love one another... very much."
“Not judging here, but you do know a Healer could tell you the date of conception and you could simply use a Pensieve to check who you were with that night? So, it would be easy enough to find that out,
Robards calls back to them as he's walking away "Oh and Potter? You might want to do something about that glob of what I hope is not semen in your hair."
Draco from the club. His hair looks normal—normal colour, normal shininess, a bit like it was at school. And his face is clear of decoration, save for a pinkness on each cheek and a bit of acne on his chin. And Harry likes it, likes normal Draco. It's a relief.
“Yeah,” he said in the direction of their ear. “Only... everything’s just started glowing. People’s faces and bodies... all patterned.”
It was a joke, but it died on his lips as he was saying it. Draco didn't even dignify it with a response, just shifted uncomfortably on his bed to try and scratch his back a bit—he was sharing a room with Potter this time, twin beds—and gave him a withering look.
And truly, Draco didn't mind in the slightest. His family was perfect, a perfect vibrant tapestry of life, all he could have ever wished for, and he was very glad to have Halloween all sewn up for another year. It might just have been the pregnancy, but he was completely shattered.
"You blokes alright?" Miriam Entwhistle, Finian's partner, shouted across the open-plan office. She'd obviously been watching them.
wasn't privy to their identity—was doing the rounds of all the dining establishments in wizarding London.
Draco goes in first, and as soon as Potter's in and has shut the door behind him, Draco's on him, pressing his face into Potter's neck. He smells like expensive aftershave and bacon grease, and it's gorgeous. Potter yelps and tries to push Draco off. And then Potter wilts into it, and it's fine.
Draco held his hand out to take the toy, but Teddy clutched Mr Gnome tighter to his chest. Draco slowly drew his hand back and waited for a few moments. Sure enough, Teddy’s frown began to fade and he relaxed his grip. “You can fix him?”
had he not heard about this? The man was in the news every other week. Usually having been snapped at a posh function, or stumbling out of a club with some beau or other. But, thinking about it now, he’d not seen much coverage of Potter in the last few months. Because there’d be no hiding that swollen abdomen. Was Potter trying to keep it quiet?
you here. I'm not getting back with you. Please. Just go!"
"A love drug?"
"So," Harry ventured. "Now that I've just come into a whole lot more free time, is there any possibility of an extension to the 'Malfoy Tour of Bali'?
With practice, Draco became better. A lot better. He was a quick learner and thrived on his mother's praise, and by the age of nine, was proficient enough to sew himself a whole dragon costume for his friend Vincent's costume party. A girl called Pansy followed him around admiring his outfit all afternoon and asking him questions, and before she went home, begged him to make her a hag outfit for Halloween, in exchange for some fizzing whizzbees and jelly snakes. He did it to get the sweets, of course, but also because she was cheeky and made him laugh, and they became fast friends.
. Jamie straddling his legs, Al squashing his stomach uncomfortably with his bony bum, and Scorp kneeling on his right arm, still prodding at the soft flesh of his elbow. And, Merlin, there was Lily on the ground with the duvet wrapped around her legs, shaking a tambourine and cackling merrily.
Malfoy clears his throat. "Thank you."
It didn’t take him long to cross paths with Potter again although that was mostly because he’d been curtain-twitching ever since quarter to six when Potter usually arrived home from work. If anyone asked, he wasn’t being creepy. He was just extremely dedicated to his neighbourhood.
"I do!" he blurted. He paused and looked around, eyes wild. Then back at Harry, pursing his lips before admitting, "No. Not a clue."
Malfoy took Harry's hands in his and lifted them both up. Touching Malfoy's skin felt so good. Harry stared at their hands in awe. He felt like everything, every good thought he had ever had about Malfoy, was trying to get out of him at that moment. Malfoy wiggled his fingers and smiled, watching Harry's wonder at the feeling. He seemed to be enjoying introducing him to this new experience, feeling it vicariously through him.
A few months later, and to Draco’s great joy, Harry fell pregnant, and though Harry really was in great spirits most of the time, Teddy and Draco made a pinky promise with each other not to pester Harry that Halloween. And so they just gave him a squishy hug and a kiss as he left the house to go and talk to a gravestone about the baby growing inside of him.
Draco looks bashful and Harry is charmed. And he gets it, gets what Draco means.
“Radiant?” Potter’s eyes crinkled with the beginnings of laughter.
“What if I hired someone to do it for you? As a favour.”
. Draco sighed. The constant eurodance music wore on him a bit. It had been fun when he'd first come here, partying with other tourists and flirting with the go-go dancers in the clubs in Seminyak. But three years later it really didn't hold the same appeal. The tourists still seemed to love it, and he supposed it was more for their benefit than his.
“Well," Draco spluttered, hurrying along the pavement. Two could play at that game. "Your buxus certainly looks like it has wild pubes growing from it. I think it’s got some kind of creeper entangled in it.”
“Actually, I’m single too.”
Turning over, putting his back defiantly to Potter, Draco counts his deep breaths, trying to ease the race of his heart and lull himself to sleep.
"Master Harry, too?" Kreacher's eyes widened further, and then he snapped his fingers. “Begging Mrs Potts' pardon," he cried, jumping onto a chair and lifting her carefully into his arms, "Kreacher is knowing what to do!"
, said in a much shriller and more Malfoyish voice than the sultry, soothing one he'd been using up until now. And reality struck. Draco Malfoy had just spent the last twenty-five minutes massaging his back, scalp and legs, and now Harry was lying in front of him waving a rather obvious flag pole about.
I can't keep doing this. But for him, I will.
"This might feel a little cold," the masseur warned, his silky smooth voice coming from in front of Harry now, "but it won't be for long."
, thank you, Ron," Harry said. "And Hermione. You've made your point."
Potter releases Draco's hand and stands up. Draco fingers begin to itch—that creeping, clawing sensation that he's become very familiar with. His turn now, he supposes, but he won't leave it two bloody days. He's not a stubborn fool... unlike Potter.
"Hmm."
Pansy lived in Foxglove Close too, in the big house with the ivy up the side, and she and Draco had remained close friends since leaving Hogwarts. Even though she didn’t really care about the Tidy Streets contest, she knew how much it meant to Draco and the rest of her neighbours, and so she agreed—as he plied her with lemon drizzle cake—to have a word with Potter herself, under the pretence of belatedly welcoming him to the street (she was a busy woman you understand; the residents of Upper Itchington thought nothing of calling on her hairdressing services morning, noon or night. No matter the hour or the cost, they had to look their best).
"Can't... believe we... just did that," Potter manages, through gasps of laughter.
"Just starting!" Harry swatted at Malfoy's head, and Malfoy ducked and grabbed Harry's t-shirt and pulled him in for another kiss. A child at a nearby table went 'Woooo kissy-kissy'.
And before she could say 'Earl Grey', they vanished with a soft pop.
“Possibly,” Draco chuckled, “or maybe they think their father has gone quite far enough for today.”
“You did some shitty things,” Ginny said mildly, crouching down to a squat and putting her hand on Draco’s leg. “Remember the stuff you used to say about my family. About my home. That upset me. And Ron, too.”
Draco sniggers, and his eyes dart automatically to Potter's slightly swollen lips.
Harry studied him under the dim, coloured lighting for a moment, licking his lips at the sight of the tiny beads of sweat that had gathered above Malfoy’s mouth, before nodding, “Yeah, thirsty, let’s get water.” He took a deep breath, letting out a happy sigh. “And chill out, yeah, let’s do it.”
Draco couldn’t help his gaze falling to Harry’s body, his legs splayed out displaying the swell of his bump, his hand resting lightly at the base of his abdomen. A strange emotion overcame him at the thought of the tiny baby within.
“Er. Well actually, I’m not sure Potter still wants…”
"In case I was leading a group of Balinese Neo-Death Eaters? Hell-bent on doing Muggles in with incredibly good massages?"
“Oh shut up, you.” Potter grabbed Draco’s hand and they set off at a brisk pace.
"We'd best be off—" he starts.
Harry wasn’t sure what to expect, but he knew things like this probably took a while to take effect. He stood in the corner of the bar, watching people, feeling the erotic bassline, letting it pulse through him, allowing his body to sway a little, along with the beat. He sipped his beer, eyeing the crowd, when all of a sudden everything changed.
, remind me who you've dragged us across a muddy field in the Highlands to see?"
by it.
He ran his hand along the slender length of holly that was Potter's wand in his pocket. It was quite an impressive wand, and Draco knew all too well how powerful it was too, having been on the receiving end of it's magic on several occasions. Rumour had it that Potter had even
“No! It's interesting.” And Harry realises he’s fascinated by this intelligent, capable Draco. “Please. Carry on.”

know," I snap. "Cast," I insist, swallowing the potion.
"I could tolerate it," Draco drawled, managing to keep his voice steady.
. Potter then picked up the drinks menu and looked at it for all of three seconds before shoving it across the table to Draco.
“I’m not confident of that, but I will try.”
"I actually think that I struggle to…" Draco trailed off, not sure how to phrase it, and still not sure if he wanted to bare all to Potter.
Draco thought and thought. Eventually he settled on his eleventh birthday. Presents, cake, friends, and his Hogwarts letter flying in by owl. It was the perfect day. He focused on the feeling of opening the parchment and seeing the Hogwarts crest.

“He’s such a darling!” she gushed, a grin still prominent on her face. “He offered me tea and vegan jaffa cakes, and we chatted and gossiped. It was delightful. And I've booked him in for a haircut and a beard trim next Saturday. I told him I'd tame that messy mop of his, and he hooted with laughter. And you know," she winked, "he's single like you. I think you two have a lot in common. I could see some Martin Miggs comics on one of his shelves, and Potter told me he’s a fan.”
“I’ll tell the bloke of course, but maybe when I’m settled with the new baby… take it from there.”
"Yeah dad," James added, finally shuffling off Harry's legs.
"Kirana," came the sharp reply, "from the front desk."
Draco yawns widely and Potter chuckles.
"Terrorised me, you did," Harry pouted.
Harry notices Draco’s neck has gone all blotchy.
Draco leapt up and lifted the sash on the window and poked his head out to look down on the garden. Unfortunately the blasted horse chestnut tree was blocking his view. He could just about make out the edge of a table with a cheerful floral runner. "What in Salazar's scrawny—"
Again he waited. Eleven long minutes passed and then a shimmering otter appeared. It opened its little mouth and Granger’s voice came out of it, priggish as always, but laced with worry.

Draco shook his head. He couldn’t ask that of his friend. The contest was in three days' time... Desperate times called for desperate measures.

Draco kissed the corner of Harry's mouth, and licked Harry's upper lip. "We both do."
"Those girls sinned!" Placid protests. "They sinned with their wandering hands. They took a vow! It is my right to discipline them as I see fit. As the leader of—"
?" and when Harry nodded and shrugged again and grinned “yep”, Malfoy laughed like a bloody angel and said, "Harry Potter. I shall look after you until you find your friends. Come. Let’s dance,” and he trailed his fingers down the shell of Harry’s ear, before raising his arms, closing his eyes and continuing to dance. A tingling wave of pleasure travelled from Harry’s ear where he’d been touched and straight into his brain. He stared at Malfoy for a few moments—the barely-there sleeveless t-shirt he was wearing had ridden up, and his bared hipbones were moving, pale and hypnotic.
“What?” Draco scowled.
Robards is shouting. "You mean to tell me you've been hit by some unidentifiable curse on the job, and have some kind of weird touching bond, and
And secondly, Potter was a half-blood. As far as Draco knew the gene for predisposition to male pregnancy ran in purebloods only. Draco shook his head and sighed, not even the least bit surprised that Potter was
And they’re still haunting him as he steps out of Malfoy's fireplace into a smart sitting room with royal blue walls and white woodwork. Soft grey furniture with mustard yellow cushions and furry cream throws. It’s all so… tasteful.

Draco peeked through the curtains in his living room for the seventh time, waiting for Pansy to emerge.
know what he was. “Anyway, I’m disturbing your fun. Might see you around.” Malfoy stepped back, taking his warm breath with him, and he began moving to the music, bouncing on the spot as the tempo increased.
Draco threw himself into work the following week. It was his last week before his paternity leave started so there was much to do. To his dismay, Suada had seen fit to hire her nephew Homer to cover his absence, and though the lad claimed to have achieved an 'O' in his Charms NEWTs, he seemed incapable of picking up anything new without it being hammered into his brain with a Bombarda. Draco had done all the hard work creating Scents and Sensibility's new line of mood-altering fragrances. All Homer had to do was follow a few recipes. Draco had spent several nights writing up the ingredients and methods and still this idiot was chopping instead of crushing and stirring the mixtures far too fast. So Draco worked hard to make as much stock as possible before he left. Suada was good to him, and she had fiercely defended him on numerous occasions from business partners and clients who took umbrage with working with a former Death Eater. He’d never forget the time she laced that bigoted tosspot Gertrand Fellipe’s cologne with stinksap. They heard he had autumn flies and bluebottles following him around the Ministry for weeks, and was banned from sitting on the Wizengamot until he got the smell and the incessant buzzing sorted out.
Later that day, when they'd arrived back at the Ministry, Draco noticed Potter scratching his neck and shoulders while speaking to Auror Finian Sheedy. Potter looked so uncomfortable in his uniform—which was normally like a second skin on him—and he kept moving and adjusting the collar.
Harry wasn't certain when he dozed off, or if he even had dozed off. His mind swam lazily in and out of the hybrid-English conversations around him. Locals and tourists alike were chattering, 90's Eurotrash hits (and misses) were pumping from a boombox on a nearby food cart, a lady in the distance was calling
from them. Harry felt alright about it though. He didn’t have any urge to be like them.
Draco was surprised that Potter didn't have much commentary up to this point. He had barely spoken at all, other than to order another round of cocktails, a bowl of
. Just if you don't mind, don't put too much pressure on… well, any part of my body."
Draco gasped at the slur, but was left stewing as he waited for his Roquefort to be wrapped. He’d be damned if he let that pompous bigoted arsehole win.
He rarely needed the pouch, of course; there wasn’t much to attend to in that respect—the odd ripped hem or sock needing darning, that sort of thing—but it gave him comfort to have the pouch there, close at hand. And it reminded him of Mother, especially the spool of fine shimmering brilliant white thread that she used to scallop-edge her handkerchiefs, and which he'd never have much reason to use at Hogwarts (the black and green threads were the workhorses there), but it was a comfort nevertheless.
“It looked to me like you’d
His jaw still felt tight; the kiss a soft juxtaposition.
"Did you kill Goodsister Trista?"
"I do know that, but it's neither here nor there. The fact is I'm doing this alone. Without you. Get that through your vacant skull, and get out. I can't bear to look at your botoxed and overly-contoured face for another second."
A warm, glowing gentleness filled his heart, surrounded his heart, and began spreading, and it wasn't long before his entire body felt as though it was full of moving, gelatinous heat.
Robards turns to go, and Potter whispers, "
“Right about what?”

Harry’s hair was whipping about a bit so Draco pulled his hood up, and then put his arm around his shoulders. “We can stay as long as you like, Harry.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at Potter, and he received a quelling look in return.
“We? You and me, like?”
"Still can't believe you're saying what we did last week was for work."
Draco offered a hand to Harry and pulled him up into a shaky embrace. "I'm really sorry, Harry," he began. "Come on, let's go back upstairs. It's safe to say neither Mrs Potts nor Hestia are down here."
"Please, whatever it was, I was asleep, so I didn't mean it." He knows his face is flushed because it feels like it's three hundred degrees in the room.
"Draco," he said. "Who's that? What

"We've hardly begun. But… I'm really… well, I like him. So much. I never dreamed he'd like me back. I'll never do anything to hurt him."
Teddy and James were delighted with their costumes, too. James was a jolly Mr Smee and Teddy a cheeky pirate. They were both over the moon with the small toy swords that Draco had asked Grandpa Arthur to make for them, and were having enormous fun choreographing an elaborate fight scene in the hallway.
Pansy dug her heel into his side. "Prat."
After two months in St Mungo’s, Aunt Andromeda passed away—peacefully in her sleep according to the Healers, and without any pain thanks to the potions, they assured a distraught Draco and Harry. Draco was a bag of nerves suggesting to Harry that they adopt Teddy, but really he should have known Harry with his big heart would agree without a second thought.
"I'm going to kiss you now," Malfoy said.
Potter seemed to be unaware of everything that was going through Draco’s head and kept smiling obliviously. “The restaurant is really brilliant, Malfoy. I’m impressed. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that my friend, Cho, you’ll remember her from Hogwarts, right, and”—he chuckled—”who’s just chosen this moment to go to the ladies, is a professional Quidditch player and is on a strict low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet, which needs to incorporate some type of protein too, so she was really hoping you could accommodate that. Will it be a problem?”
doing out here, and where you've been for the past ages. So, come on, your turn."
Of course. Potter can't wait to unshackle himself from all their inconvenient touching.
Harry felt a strong grip on his shoulder and spun around violently to shake it off. Vertigo overtook him momentarily as he fired off a defensive spell and staggered sideways, falling against an ancient bookcase, which began wobbling precariously.

Service had just started at Floyd’s on Diagon, and the staff were abuzz and atwitter.
He had barely gotten the last word out when a frenzied Potter burst into the kitchen, looking paler than the Grey Lady.
"There sure is, Lils," Harry agreed. He turned to the boys. "And I want you to know that the bad guy who did that is gone. And never coming back."
It might be nice to have someone though, to hold his hand if things got scary, and to share his joy when the baby was finally born.
“Is that even allowed? I thought there were school rules about such things.”
Draco needs more skin, and he snakes his hands under Potter's stiff embroidered tunic and starts to pull his undershirt free. He lowers his lips to Potter's neck and whispers, "I'll tell you a secret, Potter. I need to touch you more too."
“So, you wanted to talk to me,” Potter began, hands shoved deep in the pockets of his grey jogging bottoms, looking up at the winding metal of the artwork. It was a tangle of balletic sports figures twisting and lunging around a helix which was meant to represent ribbons of weaver’s silk. Draco thought it looked a bit bleak.
Harry cleared his throat. "I said: 'Thanks for that'," and a slight grin tugged at the corners of his mouth.
That shut the lids on both appliances quick-smart. "But how can we?" Mrs Potts wailed. "They've been bickering and sniping at each other for days." And she proceeded to sob loudly, rivulets of water running out of her gilded spout.
Now was as good a time for it as any other. He didn't bother turning over and simply replied, "Yes."
Apparently, the best way to do that was time off work. A
"I don't regret it," Draco says after a few minutes' silence.
Al frowned, wagging a finger in Harry's face. "It was an emergency. We couldn't find the remote for the telly. Father said you had it last."
“I'm going to need you to go out there and ask his partner for her dietary requirements yourself," he ordered, and when Pineneedle began to protest, a confused look on the poor lad’s face, Draco sighed and added, “The critic is someone I went to school with. Let’s just say that I wasn’t really the nicest person to him. If he finds out I’m the chef we risk him writing a bad review just to get back at me.” It was a simplistic version of events, but he didn’t have the time or energy to explain further.
been quite a while.
Despite his sharp words, Harry didn't miss Draco's shy sidewards glance, and the flush high on his cheeks, just as he felt an answering blush bloom on his own face.
They've never been on a date.
"Oh.” Draco relaxed his scowl. Apparently they were going to attempt a civil conversation. “In eight weeks. Thirty-first of July."
And there they were. Waiting for Draco by the entrance. Pansy in a black spaghetti-strap top and purple flares, lips plump and pouting and the colour of strawberry jam. Blaise in a green paisley shirt and some sort of harem pants, which put Harry in mind of MC Hammer, and sporting several jam-red lipstick marks on his neck. When they saw Draco and Harry, their smiles turned good-naturedly predatorial, if that was even a thing.
“This is my very first one,” Draco whispered. Teddy looked worried.
usually do this. It feels nice though, relaxing, and Draco’s body feels heavy and sluggish. Potter has always been the touchy-feely sort. Draco's seen him do similar to Granger or Lovegood when they've stayed up til the wee hours chit-chatting at house parties. So perhaps this will become something they do. Soothing each other to sleep with gentle caresses.
"Harry, call me Harry."
"What's so bloody funny?" Draco says, straight-faced, but he's a hair's breadth away from laughing himself at the sight of a giggling Potter, all pink-cheeked and bright-eyed from sex.
“Married? Kids?”
“Harry!”  A smack to his thigh jolted Harry back to reality. He blinked and found himself sitting in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express. Right. He absent-mindedly rubbed his leg where Hermione had smacked him.
“I was offered a position by George Weasley at his shop in case my NEWTS are undesirable.” He had panicked, knowing that relying on his scores would not satisfy the terms of his probation. Ron had written to George all on his own and surprised Draco with a backup job.
Draco watched Harry’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed hard. His arm was still thrown over his eyes. Draco waited.
Harry kissed him. They had other things to talk about, other less visible scars to discuss. But there was time.
No. Ginny often changed to Charlie in his fantasies. He had accepted that he was attracted to Charlie a few years ago. Just Charlie. Not blokes. Charlie was just exceptionally handsome. But then, he thought about how he kept noticing fit blokes. Not sexually, he had thought. Just noticing them. Like Neville. He remembered seeing Neville having it out that time in sixth year.  His cock got hard again. He slid to the ground. “No. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”
“She knows there was a war.”
“Right.” Still gaping, Harry handed over two Galleons and a sickle. “Keep the change.”
“You’re not wearing that are you?” And with that, Draco was back to being an arse.
The next night, he met up with Hermione and Ron for drinks, as usual. They frequented a small pub in Muggle London to avoid the press. Hermione waved at him from their usual table in the corner. A pint of ale was already waiting for him.
He made his way to the back of the store to find help. A blond man in a plaid shirt was behind the counter with his back to Harry. He had strong shoulders and a perfect round arse, and Harry let himself admire the man’s backside for a moment before asking for assistance.
Steve showed up just then, allowing Draco to finally cross to the threshold to the rest of the world. He sighed at the small taste of freedom. He loved Hogwarts, and the grounds were big, but he hadn’t stepped outside them since September first.
“Hey, Malfoy. How’s it going?”
For the major event that happens in Draco's life in this chapter, I have a disclaimer. If Draco's reaction seems abnormal, I can assure you it is not. After I wrote it, the same thing happened to me. And I reacted just like Draco.
Someone called to Harry from the end of a long tunnel. At least, he thought that was what was happening. He didn’t see a tunnel. He didn’t really see anything. Maybe he imagined the voice.
“Will you be offended if I tell you to keep the change? I just hate having a pile of the damn knuts around.”
“And the sky is blue, and the grass is green. Yes.” He paused. “Shit. Did I really upset you earlier?”
“Artemis,” Harry said. “Are you available to talk by any chance?”
“Thanks, Potter.”
The first vote was on a new tax on high-risk potions ingredients. The summary of the law was read out, then the Chief Warlock opened the floor for ten minutes for final comments from members of the council. If no one wanted to speak, it would go straight to a vote. Several members spoke in opposition to the tax, but it passed by a narrow margin. Next up was a bill to cut the budget of the Hit Wizards. It did not pass. Harry zoned out on the next law: something about expanding healing magic rights to mediwitches or something. He did not hear whether it passed.
slick on Potter’s hands, so they were able to glide smoothly over his sensitive skin, as Potter’s thumb rubbed gently over the head of his cock. Potter began slowly stroking one hand after another down his shaft, in a never-ending sliding motion that was both calming and tormenting.
“Suit yourself, Malfoy. But we’re gonna be seeing each other here every week until we give birth. No point being unfriendly. Besides, it’s not good for the babies,” he added piously. “Just ask Ford.”
pairing coming—a kiss that had set all the plates and cups rattling in the kitchen, Harry had reaffirmed the fact that he loved Draco countless times. Every time, those three little words chipped away at Draco’s fear of not being enough for Harry and replaced it with a need to be with him in every way possible.
, it makes your jaws want to clench.” Harry nodded and his eyes rolled back into his head a little at how blissful Malfoy’s breath felt against the side of his face.
And then frowns and reads it again.
"I think you'll find I'm giving her the exact amount of respect she deserves," Harry grumbled, "which is none. I'm half inclined to turn her over to the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. She's clearly cursed."
Until, two years on, a man he thought was a ghost, a man he thought would be the coldest of all, turned up, at a Hufflepuff party of all places (an annual thing they did to remember Cedric).

, and his personal favourite,
The brash tone of his self-deprecating remark caught Draco off guard, and a shocked laugh escaped his mouth, which he covered immediately. He supposed Potter had a point.
Potter might have a point. Draco was feeling frazzled. But how hard would it be for Potter to just straighten up his garden?
“Jesus,” grumbled a voice from behind Draco’s right shoulder, “the energy of the bloody life force.”
Draco slides his hands over Potter's arse up the planes of his back, murmuring "
So he said, “Yes.”
Draco snorted. “That
“Just take this replenishing potion. One dose now, one tonight before bed, and one in the morning, and you’ll be right as rain.” She handed him the bottle, and said sternly, “You’re free to go. And we’d really prefer not to see you again in here until that little one’s ready to come out.” Harry thanked her and she left.
"A Muggle hotel?"
Harry had just nodded and said, "Sounds brilliant."

on your first date," said Scorpius.
Draco walked over to Harry and planted a kiss on his forehead. Draco's silk dressing gown gaped as he bent down revealing Harry's favourite sight: his husband in tight boxer briefs. Even after all their time together, there was just something about the way clothes clung to his form that never failed to stir feelings of heat and intensity in him. Harry inhaled sharply, smelling citrus and coffee, and his mouth watered. And as a matter of fact, his own pants were getting pretty tight, and he needed a minute.

“Pregnancy brings a lot of emotional change,” Fordus announced. Draco had been paired up with Potter yet again. “You are becoming a parent for the first time and your hormone levels are changing. It’s a lot to process. I want you to talk to each other about your hopes and fears. What you want for your baby, what’s important to you as you become a new family. Talk about the things you are looking forward to with the new baby and the things that you’re worried about.”
Potter looked down at his hand but said nothing. He was still standing close enough that Draco could feel the heat of him and hear his steady exhale.
, Draco and Ginny, and Harry and Luna too, about all the accumulated grievances of their stormy past at Hogwarts and during the war. They talked freely about them. About Tom’s diary, and the Manor dungeons, and Sectumsempra. And, somehow, recounting all these unpleasant memories, this laundry list of hurts, had no charge; they were just facts, like discussing yesterday's weather.
“There was a little fizzle. It’s a start. Maybe keep your eyes open next time?”
Of course Potter is stark naked when he answers his bedroom Floo that night. Draco can see his worried face but is infinitely more distracted by his thick thighs, excruciatingly taut as he crouches, and the soft wilt of his cock against the left one.
Merlin if the man wasn't rubbing off on him, questionable pun be damned.
Add to that the fact that it had somehow slipped Draco's mind that Harry had himself been locked in a cramped cupboard half his life, and it had him feeling like a right heel. The man had looked utterly traumatised.
Pineneedle was in the kitchen. “Mungo’s are expecting you. There’ll be an Emergency Healer waiting when you go through.”

They go back to the B&B in Thorney Hill, with the intention of visiting the coven the next day. After eating dinner on a park bench (sausage and onion stew, smoky and hot with paprika, from 'Kushti Mush', a Romani-run food van) they head back to their room and settle on the bed—a bloody double room this time with only one bed, it was all they could get, but at least it's a king-size—and begin leafing through the case file.

As soon as Gabe slammed the door behind him, Draco slumped to the floor of the hallway, and crouched there for a long time, hugging his belly. It was so warm against the undersides of his arms. Warm with life.

“Princess Kitty Sunshine? What in Hades is that?”
Once Teddy was bathed and in his pyjamas and all tucked up in bed under a cosy crocheted blanket, Draco noticed his stuffed toy was looking very worse for wear.
Draco echoed Potter's sigh. But he reminded himself he really wanted to get the most out of these classes. Merlin knew he needed all the help he could get.
For another, Potter's an excellent cook. Often, when Potter gets home before Draco, he makes dinner; lasagnes and shepherd's pies and Lancashire hotpots, nothing at all like the food the elves served at the Manor and everything like Hogwarts' hearty fare, and Draco thinks he knows why that is.
"Go on then."
okay. Draco knew that Harry hated Halloween. Of course he did. Harry had never joined in any of the events the Slytherins or the Gryffindors had organised for Halloween, opting to stay away and morosely drink a six pack of Carling by himself in Grimmauld, listening to gloomy Radiohead CDs. It's just, Draco thought it might be different now that they were living together, now they were a
Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was blushing under his gaze, or if he just looked pinker because of the lighting. Whatever it was, he was inhumanly pretty. Malfoy bit his lip before grabbing Harry's hand, and Harry died a little at how charming that was, his heart drumming in his chest. He held on tight to Malfoy’s sweaty hand as he pulled them through the crowd, finding the way their palms slid, wet against each other, pleasingly intimate.
"Yeah. But wouldn't it be better if we figured out what it was first?" Potter had begun pacing back and forth, as he always did when he was having one of his 'brilliant' ideas. "I say we go back and do some more investigation at the coven tomorrow. I'm pretty sure we could break the curse, we just need to do some poking around, go back over the case notes. And then our record stays unblemished."
When Draco got over the small surprise of Potter being civil, and the equally small surprise of Potter having rather nice cheekbones now that Draco got a proper look at him—what a

know that,” he scowled, and Ginny pulled back with a laugh. She finished her water, and then grabbed Harry’s hand, slipping something small into it and pressing his fingers around it.
Draco stood up and placed a hand on Potter's shoulder, a halfhearted gesture of comfort, and before he even realised what he was doing, he'd slid his hand upwards to Potter's bare neck, barely even registering the small shock to his palm.
" Mrs Potts wailed, choking back a sob before disappearing, leaving a few wisps of steam in her wake.
And even if it was only for tonight, Malfoy could be Draco, and perhaps future Harry would go back to fighting and resenting Malfoy, if he really wanted to. Though Harry was racking his brains to figure out why he ever would.
Still snickering, he wiped his eyes with his free hand to see...

That year saw Harry as the most pitiful Prince Eric in history. If he wasn't making grumpy comments about his outfit, he was staring mournfully out the window of Percy and Penelope's cottage, and Draco just knew he was thinking about his mum and dad. Even Draco's fabulous Ursula costume and Teddy's cheeky Sebastian couldn’t cheer him up. Though in fairness, James toddling about in his Ariel costume did make Harry crack a smile; the red wig just wouldn't stay on and the shell bra bounced around as he ran.

A faint smile graced Harry's lips and Draco found himself returning it before he could even think about it, "I love you too," he said, leaning down to capture Harry's lips again. He knew he meant it too. The way Harry made him feel was more than just a silly crush and he knew that. His feeling scared him though, he knew if his dad found out he'd probably be off-the-wall mad. He couldn't help it though as he let his hands travel through Harry's messy hair and he knew he'd never been happier than he was here with Harry.
"Here we are!" Harry shouted.
Pomfrey sent him a curious look before gesturing for him to continue.
Draco's nose crinkled in disgust as Hermione started counting down.
"Watering it?" Blaise asked. Neville looked at him incredulously.
“You should set a different sound for that thing,” Draco groaned and Harry chuckled, snaking his arm around Draco’s stomach and pulling him towards himself.
"I think you should."
"I don't have anything I need to shop for today. I just didn't want to sit in the common room with you for two hours as you complain."
"Just get on with it Pansy," Draco said, dropping his head down to stare at his book, his face burning.
Ginny felt it was funny how tiny it was for such a big thing. She could hear the birds chirping outside the window in the crisp November air and she could see Pigwidgeon sitting on the window sill, waiting for the note, she let out a sigh.
"I'll go first this game," Seamus announced and drew a question from the bag, "Never have I ever ridden a Hippogriff."
"You two go ahead and go without me," Harry said, knowing they'd probably want to go together on a date as it was the first Hogsmeade weekend of the year.
"The rumors are false and you're an idiot for just blindly trusting what others have been saying," Harry said through gritted teeth. "He's not a Death Eater, you can't define people by their past mistakes! And he didn't attack me!" Harry practically shouted the last sentence and it gained the attention of the entire room. "If I hear one more person say he attacked me, they'll be finding themselves unable to talk for the rest of the school year!" Harry shouted, quickly gathering his and Draco's things before Madam Pince could come over and kick them out herself.
Draco watched as the ink faded away in amazement, "This is amazing."
"Hey!" Draco yelled setting down his book to glare at Harry. Harry smirked over at him until he noticed how Draco's hair was sticking up and then he burst out laughing. Draco launched the pillow back, hitting harry straight in the head sending him falling off the bed.
He was just curious about him, that's all, and trying to understand why he kept thinking about the night in the astronomy tower after the Quidditch match. He was also trying to understand why he couldn't think about the Yule Ball next month without thinking about Draco as well. They always seemed to exist in the same space next to each other in his mind.
"Here, take this." Draco opened an eye and saw Harry was holding out a glass of water and holding something else in his other hand.
Pansy held the bottle up when everyone was seated, "Alright, who's going first."
"I don't care who you like, long as they don't hurt you," Ron sent Luna a look then, "Don't go hurting my little sister."
Dear Mother and Father,
Hermione heard the moment the shouting started, along with everyone else in the eighth-year common room. She knew from experience that when they started yelling, it never ended well.
"I was wondering if I could help," Blaise suddenly blurted out and then quickly colored at his blatantly obvious desire to help and quickly tried to amend it, "I mean, if you'd like, I could help with setting up materials or something. I kind of suck with plants, but I could still be of some use."
"We should get back to the potion before it boils over."
Pansy came when they were cleaning up breakfast. “Are you both decent?” Pansy called from the living room.
"Realy?" Harry said excitedly, "We should pull a prank together."
He had made one observation though: sometimes people glowed brighter. He'd noticed three people who glowed more than others in specific, though: Hermione, Ron and Draco. Granted, those were who he'd been around the most, and he'd also been studying them for most the day as well. The thing that puzzled him the most though was that while Hermione and Ron seemed to have a pattern of when they glowed brighter (when they were around each other), Draco didn't seem to have a pattern at all. Instead he always seemed to be glowing brighter than everyone else in the room.
"We're not mad at each other," Harry said, looking down at his plate, "just awkward."
"Who do you think is most likely to murder someone for money."
"Yeah."
"Well I'm up now, give me a moment and I'll be ready," Harry replied, getting out of bed and heading to his trunk to get out his uniform.
"Nah, I don't need anything in particular."
"Come on," he said, walking out of the room, dragging a stuttering Harry behind him.
When he came out he was dressed in what looked like pajama bottoms and a dark green muggle sweatshirt.
After struggling through homework and then eating dinner as fast as they both could - though they wouldn't ever admit it - they were both seated at the top of the astronomy tower happily leaning against each other.
"Yeah, like Ron and Hermione glow brighter a lot. I haven't really watched many people though," Harry looked over at Draco, taking him in, "You're always glowing pretty bright though."
Harry pulled back to smile at him before diving forward to capture his lips. It felt so much better than the first, this time he could enjoy it, all thoughts fleeing his head as he let his hand find its way to the back of Draco’s head. His fingers tangled into the short blond hair and when Draco pressed forward and tilted his head slightly to the right, the kiss was immediately deepened.
Rumors were flying by the second day and they just seemed to be getting worse as the days passed. Though, none of the rumors really seemed to be getting that close to the truth, some didn't fail to make Harry's cheeks heat up and Pansy to snicker quietly to Draco. Draco assumed she might have started the spread of a few of them.
November 7, 1998
“So did you have a plan for what you wanted to do? Or are we just doing what comes to mind?”
Harry's head was still whirring with ideas as to what Hermione thought the colors meant. They had agreed to talk about it at lunch because Hermione had decided they needed to pay attention to class and they couldn't do that if they were talking about the colors.
"For what? It's not your fault. It's my own for the things I did."
"You have been watering it, right?"
"No, you're not fine," Blaise said and Draco felt the bed next to him sink as Blaise sat down next to him in the dark. "Tell me what happened."
"Works perfect for us," Draco said, already pulling him down the hallway to find an empty compartment. When he located one he quickly pulled Harry inside and shut the curtains.
"You okay?"
Draco stopped moving then and turned to look up at him. No one had really been as kind to him as Harry was being now and it made his heart ache, if possible he liked him even more in that moment. "I don't want to be a bother," Draco finally said.
"Draco, we're going to be late to class, we fell asleep!" Harry said, rushing the words out.
"Oh. Oh," Blaise turned wide, worried eyes onto Pansy as he remembered the drunken admission of the night before. "What are you going to do now? If you get caught-"
"I wanted to talk," Harry said, looking over at Draco. Draco suddenly felt nervous as he went to sit next to Harry on the bed.
"You'll just have to take my word for it," Harry said as they stepped out into the cold outside air. "Do you have any shops you wanted to go to?"
“Sorry.”
"Yes!" Harry said, already celebrating.
"True," Hermione smiled.
"I'm cute? You are."
Draco just decided to hope that Potter didn't hear anything as he hadn't mentioned it. "I'll see you later, Pansy, don't think this is over," Draco said as he turned to leave with Potter leaving Pansy smirking after them.
Molly left then to go wake up the rest of the house and Ron sleepily made his way down the hall to the restroom to look for Harry. When he got there though, it was empty. Maybe he's with Hermione or in a different bathroom, he wondered to himself and made his way upstairs to check. The other bathrooms were all empty though and when he made it to Ginny's room neither her nor Hermione knew where he was.
The two hours passed extremely slowly and Harry spent most of his sneaking glances over his book at Draco.
"Dang, she was pretty! Why on earth did you turn her down? I mean- oof," Ron was cut off as Hermione elbowed him in the side and shot him a glare. "Not as pretty as you are though babe," Ron tried for a smile.
"It was my fathers, Dumbledore gave it to me in first year for Christmas."
"Didn't we cover this plant in sixth year?" Draco complained, trying to cast a severing charm and having his wand knocked out of his hand.
"I don't know. My dad's hair was like that too I think."
"We're wizards aren't we?"
Wednesday meant potions, which was a class Harry had with Draco.
"Really?!" Harry said and the way his eyes lit up, it made Draco want to melt.
"No way, I've been looking forward to it for a while now, I haven't even been able to get my hands on it yet."
“I still can’t believe you got a dog,” Draco said, peering down at the dachshund that had run up to greet him when he entered Pansy’s house. They’d just finished their lunch and Pansy had insisted he come to her house to get ready for dinner.
"I'd like that," Draco said with a smile, leaning in to give Harry a soft kiss.
Secondly, does this mean Draco is gay? And he likes me? The thought was so puzzling to him, he hadn't seen any signs of it.
"Really? Awww," Ron said leaning a bit into her and kissing her cheek, "wish I made a move sooner." Hermione smiled and entwined her fingers with his.
"Oh yes, you definitely look like you're being punished right now," Blaise said.
"Dean, Seamus!" Harry shouted getting their attention as he jogged to catch up.
"Really?"
"You can't. As soon two people, from the same house, put their trunk down in a room, one of them goes flying at them. You won't even be able to put your stuff down," Hermione replied, turning to look at Malfoy.
Hermione laughed, standing up and grabbing onto Ron's hand to pull him up next. "Come on, it isn't that bad." They headed up the stairs to go to Ron's room and swap shirts and everyone laughed at Ron's face as they disappeared around the corner.
"She's really never eaten them since?"
A smirk spread across her face and she suddenly flopped against Draco who was sitting on her left. "Oh Pansy, Potter looked at me again today! He's such a git!" Pansy said in a high pitch, imitating Draco.
He dully wondered what Harry would be doing while they were gone, but decided wondering about it would just make him miss him more.
"No one would what?" Harry said cutting him off.
Love,
"And I realized what pink was because of Dean and Seamus," Hermione said, trying to continue the conversation.
“Are you going to sit here and tell me I'm wrong?” Ron said, misinterpreting the silence, “It was a valid guess at the very least! With how much care he puts into his looks coupled with the fact that he has literally never looked twice at a girl - besides Pansy, but we all know she’s a lesbian - there’s absolutely no way he’s straight!”
-----------------------
Draco smiled down at their locked hands.
"Wow, you offend me," Draco muttered and that was the last thing Harry remembered before he fell asleep feeling more content and safe than he had in awhile.
"He shouldn't go around just asking random girls. That could seriously hurt one of them," Hermione berated.
Hermione noticed him walking over and stood up, rushing over to him, " you need to stop fighting with him! Look at your face, you-!"
"So you're still going to tell me you don't like him?" Pansy asked as soon as the last person left the common room to go to bed.
"Hey guys!" Hermione said as she sat down across from them, Ron following her lead. "What're you guys talking about?"
--------------------------------------
"It's alright," Harry said, stepping over the pile and making his way over to Draco, "I'm glad I get to make my first with you."
He was pretty good looking for a guy Harry supposed.

"Hey guys," Ginny said, walking into the compartment, sitting down beside Harry, "you took off so fast I lost you in the crowd!"
Harry leaned into Draco's lips again and soon he was pressing Draco down into the mattress and pressing wet kisses down his neck and to his collarbone.
"You had a nightmare," Draco stuttered, face going pink, "So I woke you up and-"
"I do know you, and you wouldn't and we both know it," Harry said and Draco finally looked up at Harry and met his eyes. They stared at each other for a moment and then they both turned away quickly.
"Ah, yeah sorry I went to Madam Pomfrey to tell her about the color meanings. I wanted to hurry to not be late to this class, but I suppose it didn't matter much anyway," Harry said, looking towards where Hagrid was trying and failing to get students to pay attention.
"I don't know, but I suppose it's best to just focus on the present right now, and figure the rest out as it comes. Right now let's just enjoy our vacation," Harry said, and then turned to Draco giving a devious smirk, "and on that note..."
"It's not my fault!" Draco said, throwing his hands up and flopping down on his bed next to Pansy.
"I think I might like guys. I mean I don't think I really liked Ginny like you know and that got me thinking and I'm not sure if I ever really liked girls. So I was thinking about that over the summer and I started realizing that I paid much more attention to guys than I ever did to girls and-"
All Harry could do was stare open mouthed, a slow blush creeping across his cheeks, when he noticed Draco looking at him he averted his eyes though. No doubt feeling guilty, Draco thought.
"That's not a plan, that's just an idea."
"I'll be alright," Harry said, turning to continue walking. Draco watched him walk for a moment before hurrying to catch up.
On the other hand, he and Ginny were back to being friends. Harry was sort of surprised to find out Ginny and Luna were dating at first, but now that he knew, he thought it quite obvious. He, Luna, and Ginny has taken to hanging out more often too, Luna had told him she was panromantic and asexual (he had to ask what that meant) while Ginny came out as bisexual to him. Harry found he rather liked hanging out with them together, but sometimes he felt a bit like an awkward third wheel.
Practice was over as soon as Harry finished handing out schedules and people started heading back to the dorms. There were a couple stragglers who took their time to see if they could find out what the awkwardness was caused by, but they all soon left as well when Hermione came into the room and Ron and Harry followed her out.
Harry cleared his throat and Draco looked up at him. He was about to say something when a waitress arrived at their table.
"Oh hah hah. Very funny. I don't complain."
"Apparently so, but I know she really does want to do something today. It really sucks that you're stuck with Malfoy."
“You bought me clothes to wear to dinner?” Draco questioned as Pansy led him to her room.
"One day Slytherin will beat Gryffindor, you just wait," Draco grumbled.
Draco reddened even more, "Hey, you agreed to it, that's not my fault."
Before he could help it, he felt himself give Draco a goofy smile. One that Draco happily returned when their eyes met.
"I like the chocolate cauldrons the best," Blaise replied and stooped over to grab some.
Ron let out a sound of shock and Hermione nudged him in the ribs.
It had seemed that would be all anyone would be talking about for the next few days, until McGonagall announced that she had good news: the staff had agreed that it'd be a good idea to hold another Yule ball for those in fourth year or older. It had been decided that it'd be a good activity everyone could have fun at, especially after the last year.
His eyes suddenly flitted over to Draco across the hall and the thought of taking him crossed his mind for a second before he quickly shut it down. He wasn't going to entertain that thought even for a second.
"They wouldn't care. I'm a traitor for being friends with you, even if the war is over. It wouldn't matter if I got hit with the potion to them," Draco said grimly. Harry watched the way his eyes seemed to get a bit clouded as he avoided Harry's eyes. Harry couldn't help notice the red haze that surrounded him though and wondered if the potion had gotten in his eyes or something.
"Wouldn’t say no," Potter grinned. "Nice place you've got here."
"Sneaky. Rather risqué, in fact," Draco joked. And Potter gave him another quelling look.
Draco explained what the matron had told him about Harry’s little accident, and Granger nodded along, her frown growing deeper.
here. Not really fair to be so critical of my appearance. I’m growing a baby here!”
Samwise loves yoghurt, dad," said a muffled Lily from under the duvet she was valiantly trying to carry back to the bed. "It was your own fault for not coming down when we shouted."
better."
They’re both quiet, but it feels like the silence has meaning. There's a heaviness to it, a tension that’s both underlying and overlying, permeating every layer of the space between them.
As Draco gasps for cool air, Potter's thrusts become uneven. Draco sees the pulse jumping in his neck and cranes his neck upwards to seal his mouth over the fluttering vein. Potter gives a sharp cry and comes, his hips stuttering down madly into Draco's, his cock pouring out sticky spurts of come between them. Potter moans long and loud and cries out again at the tail end of it, clutching desperately at Draco, fingernails digging into flesh.
Joanna looks terrible when the Auror on duty slides back the warded cell door. Draco takes in her red-rimmed eyes, the tear streaks cutting clean pathways through grimy skin, her hair a greasy dark-blonde tangle. She's sitting on the floor, knees to her chin.
"Gentlemen. Apologies, but you're upsetting Goodbrother Jeffrey. He was friends with Goodsister Trista." He frowns disapprovingly. "I thought the case was closed."
Mrs Potts emitted a surprised plume of steam. "I must say I
“He still wants to speak to the chef, doesn’t he?” Draco frowned, dreading the answer.
"Oh, did she just?" Harry looked toward Mrs Potts, who had scooted behind the fruit bowl. "Now who's being childish?" After a beat, Harry snickered, childishly. "But, in fairness, leaves
"At the Imperial Hotel on Russell Square." Draco constructed another rollie, fingers a blur.
Fortunately Fordus called the activity to a halt, but unfortunately couples were then asked to relay any important revelations to the group. Draco soon remembered why he hated activities like this, as Potter told everyone about how wonderful it was that Draco loved his bump.
Stowing his shoes in a side pocket of his bag, Draco fished out his wallet and then made his way to the small pop-up bar on the beach and ordered a Bali Mary. A twist on a Bloody Mary—containing jicama fruit, cucumber and brown sugar as well as the usual tabasco, worcestershire, vodka, celery and tomato juice—it woke him the fuck up and pulled him out of his tailspin. It was also one of his five-a-day, he thought smugly, despite it tasting a bit like boozy pasta sauce. He sipped it while the bar speakers churned out more nineties tommyrot, '
"Mmmm."
, will you?" Draco inclines his head downwards.
“There.” He knotted the thread and cut it. “Good as new.” He set Mr Gnome up on his feet and walked him over towards Teddy.
,” Draco managed before hurrying back into the kitchen.
“I don’t dance.
Pansy groaned, but Harry laughed with delight.
Draco drained the remainder of his drink in a bid to steady his nerves, spurring Potter on to do the same.
Just as the masseur said, soon his hands were pleasantly warm as they swept across the breadth of Harry's back and shoulders in long, slow patterns, the pressure steadily growing firmer and firmer. Harry grimaced internally; the man was no doubt realising exactly
"Sure, love," she nodded, and Draco picked up the unusual ring that had been half-obscured by the miscellaneous junk littering the table.
Because the man standing over him, looking horror-stricken at Harry's face before dropping his gaze mortifyingly slowly to Harry's tented swimming trunks, was none other than Draco Malfoy.
“It stands for 'Dad I’d Like to Fuck’,” said Potter, grinning.
Ugh. Draco should have known he'd be interrogated about all of this. Especially as it was Potter. The indefatigable busybody.
Well.
It cost Slytherin fifty house points when they were found out, and Potter barely seemed frightened at all. Rather, he and the Weasel had laughed and seemed in rather good spirits about it. Vincent and Gregory grumbled for the rest of the day, but Draco still thought it was well worth the effort, and the image of Potter’s charging silver stag was in his mind for a long time afterward.
Draco felt a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. "Did a stint behind the bar at Bali Joe's in Seminyak before I got into the massage gig. Merlin, that was a wild time."
Harry had known for a while that something had to give. Long days in the field and longer evenings completing paperwork had left him both frazzled and fractious, and it wasn't surprising that Head Auror Robards had sent him to the Department of Occupational Health (D'OH for short). They had referred him to Mind Healer Michael Rotchburns and after their sixth consultation,
