Draco woke up and looked around in a panic. Something was wrong, but he couldn’t pinpoint what it was. His bedroom looked the same as it always did. Closing his eyes, he sent out his sense. A moment later his eyes sprang open, and he jumped out of bed. Harry!! Harry was in distress.
Even if he pushed the whole major issue aside there still left James. Now while Harry had personally no memories of the bloke, everywhere he went people sung his praise and told Harry what a hero he had been. Something that had lit a small ball of warmth inside of him, especially when they said how much Harry looked like James. Which brought around another point, how come Harry looked so much like James if he wasn’t Harry’s dad?
“Ain’t heard of any chaos and destruction being rained down.” There was scatted laughter, then another voice asked.
But Harry couldn’t force his limbs to move all he managed was a slight rocking motion. He hurled more insults and demands at himself but nothing he said made any difference.
Severus slid unobtrusively into the Three Broomsticks and, after catching Rosmerta's eyes, headed off to the private room up the stairs. He was not surprised to see the three other Head of house already inside.
Head whirling, Severus sank back onto the bed. He watched with lust-filled eyes as Tom sensually strip for him. Once they were both naked Tom crawled onto the bed and turned Severus until he was lying on his stomach. To prepare for tonight, Severus had already preformed the necessary spells. He was therefore caught unaware when he felt tricking oil pour onto him.
He was stripped of all his titles. He was registered as a child predator, his name would go down in history as one of the most evil Leaders. When he was caught, he would be receiving a Dementors Kiss. Hogwarts would go through a strenuous overhaul to see what atrocities he had performed on other children. And there would be an in-depth inquiry to the whole of his time, both teacher and headmaster.
As he slid next to Sirius, he felt something hard poke him in the stomach. Harry froze, not breathing, the sensation of Dudley flashing through him. When nothing else happened, he blew out the air in his lungs and concentrated on the breathing exercised Severus had taught him. Slowly his heart settled, and he thought about it logically. He wanted to do something to make Sirius feel better. Everyone had been assuring him that this act when done between people who love one another was not a disgusting bad thing. That people did it to bring pleasurable feelings to someone they loved. Harry bit his lip and continued to think about this. It would differ from the other times because Harry was choosing to do it. And Sirius wasn’t forcing him. Even if Sirius was forcing/ asking him that was fine because Harry loved Sirius and that made all the difference.
Blaise shot a look of extreme annoyance at the blond poofter. For fuck sakes, he would have never intruded into Malfoy’s personal space had he known that. He placed his hand over his heart and bowed to Harry.
“Call it my own little gamble,” Voldemort said. He then lent down and picked up a leaf from the ground. He tapped it with his wand and it shone blue for a moment before returning to looking like an ordinary leaf.
Harry watched the pair of them for a couple of strokes, then nodded happily and walked back to Draco. He took the oil back then blinked suddenly huge pleading eyes at his mate as he reached out and touched Draco’s wing. Harry made a hopeful noise. And Draco laughed.
“Yes, he has also never taken better care of himself nor stood up for himself more than now. My unbiased option is that being a father has improved Severus life for the better.”
Drawing back from the embrace Lucius turned to the reports, they instantly screamed questions at him trying to get the best soundbite for their newspaper. Lucius held up his left hand his right was still being held by Narcissa. The crowd quieted to let him speak.
Sirius huffed quietly. Draco turned to the Grimm and spoke. “Cousin, we are going to be in the blue sunroom if you would like to watch.”
Harry stood up and tried his hardest to ignore the torn feeling inside like he was soiled like something precious had been taken from him. He crept upstairs and slid under his bed so he remained out of sight not bothered by the trapped heat anymore. He felt extremely fragile right now. And he couldn’t understand why it hadn’t lasted that long and he didn’t have any permanent marks from the encounter. And yet he was shaking just as bad as he did after a long session with Vernon’s anger. Unable to understand his feelings or his reactions Harry buried his head in his arms and wept silently. He didn’t move from his spot until he heard Petunia getting the pots and pans out for dinner. Then he pulled himself out from under his bed and went to the kitchen to start cooking.
Whilst waiting for his son, Severus would end up gathering potion ingredients. He was surprised to find such a wide variety growing here. Severus had only been here for ten minutes when the tent flap opened and Harry stumbled out. Severus turned to him, concerned with this sudden change in routine.
“Oh,” Harry said quietly, but Tom being the sharp-eyed Slytherin he was caught the hint of a pleased smile hovering around his lips. Harry then straighten up and looked at Tom defiantly
“It has been so long since Severus had put nothing in his hair that I doubt he remembers what it looks like natural. Besides, I believe that even his sharp eyes were fooled for a while into believing you were a mini James.”
“Harry!” Hermione yelled when she caught sight of him, she rose and went to give him one of her normal hugs but Harry flinched away ducking into Sirius’ side who drew him closer and out of the girl’s reach. Hermione stopped looking hurt for a moment before plastering on a brave smile.
“Thank you, my Lord.” Severus breathed, his emotions threatening to overwhelm him. All the panic and worry for Harry combined with his budding feeling for Tom that he had valiantly been trying to suppress and they burst through his occlumency shield, flooding his system. Which made him do something completely out of the ordinary. He shot forward and mashed their lips together in an unexpected kiss. Tom had frozen, not moving and Severus drew back mortified.
Harry bit his tongue so he wouldn’t complain, but he could do nothing to stop the whining that was coming from his throat. Dumbledore had a bruising grip around his upper arm and was marching him towards the fireplace. Harry tried his hardest to be strong and brave and not cause more hassle than he was. But he couldn’t stop himself from turning his head back and making eye contact with Sirius. His whine rising in pitch. The last thing he saw was Sirius breaking out of the Order’s restraining hands and leaping towards him before green fire swallowed everything from sight.
“Merlin Harry, look at your toes!” Draco exclaimed loudly. Harry stopped mid snarl and looked down at his bare toes, wet from the morning frost in bewilderment.
Harry grabbed hold of Severus’ hand and half guiding half pushing got Severus onto the cushion at Tom’s feet. Splotches of colour rose in Severus cheeks as he sat stiffly. When weighing up fulfilling Harry's request verse his dignity, Harry always came out on top. Still, Severus couldn’t look anyone in the eye, sure that he would see them mocking him. He had thought that Lucius position had looked quite nice but would never assume that he would be considered to be in the same position with Tom. Tom wasn’t an Eros, he didn’t have any interest in wasting time in such a manner.
Since it was constantly causing Harry headaches trying to sort this out, he decided to just split the Dark Lord into two. The evil lunatic who terrorised the Wizarding world and killed his parents (Except Severus was still very much alive. No, think about that later) and who Harry had battled against in first and second year was Voldemort. The man who rescued, healed and now talked to Harry daily was Tom. A completely different guy from the first. One that Harry could ask any question to and he would get an answer for it. And the answers were not what Harry wanted to hear, but the truth.
Severus ducked his head, still not used to having Tom care about his wellbeing. He turned and left, hoping that he had read the cues right. He was going to chalk the hand holding to a master looking after his servant. Severus had never had a caring master before so he wasn’t sure exactly how they would act, but surely hand-holding was part of the requirements. The image of Tom holding hands with Lucius popped into his head. Instantly bitterness and sour jealously flooded him. Severus shook his head, dismissing the image and told himself to pull it together.
Sure enough, Harry jerked awake multiple times during the night. But the gag did its job, keeping the terror-stricken scream stuck in his throat. Which meant to rest of the house could sleep peacefully in their beds, even if Harry did not. Harry hoped that now he had the multiple nightmares that he could get a couple hours of restful sleep in. He settled himself down and ran his hands over the torc Draco had given him. Drawing comfort from the golden metal. It was solid proof that someone wanted and desired him. And not any old person, oh no, Harry was pretty dam sure all his good luck was used up to make Draco become his mate. But Harry wouldn’t change it. He would be content to continue to have bad luck for the rest of his life, so long as Draco continued to be his mate. The collar work incredibly quickly and Harry relaxed drifting off.
Harry was pushed into a chair and he huddled down shivers raking down his body and head begin to loll. It was feeling so heavy he was struggling to hold it up. His eyes were also drooping and time seemed to pass in odd increments, some speeding by and other crawling like everything was stuck in slow motion. He felt a brief sting across one cheek and something pulling his hair until his face was tilted up Moody’s fake eye swirling above him. But his body wasn’t able to handle any more and his eyes rolled back as he drowned in darkness and he knew no more.
Draco looked away, embarrassed. “I hope so,” he said. Severus reached out and squeezed his godson’s shoulder.
Tom nodded his head dismissing him. He knew the man had a lot of prickly pride and would need to go off in private to put himself together. None the less Tom privately gambled that Severus would be back before the weeks end seeking the answers. Sure, enough not even two days past before Severus was once more knocking on his office door.
Maybe he should just take it day by day and see how it goes. After all, he could still back out. Snape no Severus if he was doing this then he would call him by his first name. Severus had not made him promise anything. In fact, Severus had not made him do anything about it at all, he had just given the information the Harry then left the ball in his court. It was now up to Harry if they went any further with this.
Harry also didn’t understand why Hermione couldn’t stay if Molly was. It was this that threw him enough that he was no longer sure what was acceptable and what was not. But he no longer thought he had the right to say that he didn’t want to take his clothes off in front of all these people. Hands shaking, he slowly removed his clothes, watching as each item of clothing that had been tailor made just for him and for the first time fitted him properly was burnt to ashes before his eyes. Until he stood before the entire room without a stitch of clothing remaining.
Lucius became disarmed and forced into magic damping cuffs. Moody taking great delight to make sure they were on as tight as possible. The one bright point was getting to watch as Harry sunk his teeth into the restraining hand Dumbledore had on his shoulder. Dumbledore ripped his bleeding hand away and spelled Harry in unconsciousness, and Lucius knew they were done for.
He eventually fell into an exhausted sleep. But no respite was given to him in his dreams. Instead, he was hunted, tortured, he killed Cedric and other innocents until their blood ran like a river and swept him off his feet. Only to dump him before Dumbledore who shook his head sadly turning away from him.
Harry slowly walked across Lucius office to the seat by the window. He found himself tired all the time which Snape had explained was a sign his body was healing which was a good thing. It took a lot of energy to do so which put Harry in the position of falling asleep constantly and being far too tired to do anything more strenuous then small walks.
Harry paused, he had both Sirius talk and Severus’ multiple lectures running through his head but even with them he couldn’t see how he could get out of this. The threat of Vernon was an all the real one that could be applied at any time.
A glint of gold caught Harry eyes and before he could think about it Harry found himself blurting out
He didn’t share. He bared his teeth at the thought of someone else trying to have a part of his Harry and tighten his grip in the wavy hair. Harry arched up into the hold wordless begging for more. Draco relaxed his grip and let out a pleased hum as he went back to his stroking. Harry was looking up at him trustingly and that helped settle Draco. He had been told by every single one of the people that he dated that he was too clingy and possessive. No one had wanted that much of Draco's attention until Harry. His sweet Harry who looked so shyly pleased every time that Draco acknowledge him it made Draco resolute to shower Harry with all the attention he craved. His Harry was perfect. It was like Merlin made him just for Draco. They fit together so well.
Severus inclined his head. “The court was kind enough to decide that since I had been Dumbledore’s unwilling pawn for sixteen years that I had suffered enough.”
As soon as Severus entered the room, Dumbledore turned to him and said gravely, “I’m afraid I have some shocking news. Harry Potter has gone missing.”
“Shite yeah Pup, you’ve got it.” Sirius looked pleased then he contemplated “Huh, the fucking Firewhiskey analogy works great.”
“I’ll go and see what information I can find,” Snape said and turning stalked off robes swirling at his feet.
Still, he needed to get more supplies and food to lure Harry in with. He also needed to keep Tom, Narcissa and Draco updated with the good news. He reappeared in the courtyard of the safe house Tom organised for them to stay in while the ministry attempted to raid Malfoy manor using Lucius incarceration as an excuse. The furthest they would get would be the Manor grounds. Narcissa locked the house down tight once the Order had dragged away Lucius and Harry. They planned to keep out of view after all the ministry couldn’t grab either of them and force them to comply and open up the manor if they were not available.
In the past, Draco had thought that if he turned out to have the Eros gene and transformed that he would be spending all his time having sex with his mate. Yet here they were starting the fourth day and they hadn’t even kissed. Or done anything at all remotely sexual. What was weird was Draco while he loved Harry completely didn’t feel the need to do anything along those lines.
Harry nodded at once. He knew Mr Malfoy would have said and done all in his power to draw all the attention on himself to protect his Eros mate and son. And as another Mate Harry would follow his lead. He knew Lucius would want Harry to throw him to the wolves if it meant that it would protect Narcissa and Draco.
Both Harry and Draco looked across to see Snape get out of his bed jerkily tie his dressing-gown close before leaving the room. Harry looked up at Draco unsure if they were in trouble or not.
“I think that Severus has had enough choices taken from him. And that he has earned the right to make up his own mind whether he wants to spend any time with you or not. You would be doing him a great disservice if you decided to make the choice for him, even if you believed you were doing what was best,” Tom said. “Have hope I know Severus is of the same mind as myself, that is that we firmly believe that the child should not have to pay for the sins of their parents. Since knowing he is a father, Severus has second-guessed himself, had sleepless nights worrying, been befuddled and turned around.”
Lucius nodded again as he took potion in the spot Harry had suggested. He struggled to keep the shock off his face. There was a lot more going on in those daily visits than the board games the Dark Lord played with Harry.
He heard a faint noise and glancing up Severus froze, not daring to even breathe. The gaunt black shape of a monstrous dog climbed the ridge on the other side of the plateau where Severus knelt. Ice-cold fear slid through his veins as he glimpsed the Grimm’s eyes. Madness was too tame to describe what he saw in them. Insanity didn’t even come close to hitting the mark. Severus could not adequately explain the raving lunacy derangement that it contained. While Sirius survived Harry’s Obscurus he had paid a hefty price of his humanity and sanity to do so.
At first, Tom couldn’t hear what was being said as the conversation started quietly, but everyone could see the other person frequently shaking their head as Dumbledore spoke. Dumbledore got more and more frustrated with every head shake and gestured wildly. Eventually, his voice rose enough that Tom could hear it from a couple of tables over.
Draco entered the room and as soon as he saw Harry his wings sprang out from his back and spread wide in joy. He had gotten a tailor to make wing slits in all of his garments, as it was now far too cold to walk around bare-chested. Harry thought he heard a soft “Peacock” as Draco came towards him, but when he shot a look at Blaise, he was sitting in his seat, mouth closed innocently. Harry gave him a flinty gaze to let him know that Harry had caught that, but otherwise, he let it go. Draco hadn’t heard it, so it wasn’t important. Then there was also the fact that Harry quiet liked Blaise. He was fast becoming a good friend, and all teasing aside had been one of their biggest supporters. Not that many people knew about them, but of those who did. Blaise was right behind their family in terms of positivity.
Draco shivered theatrically it was cold but not that bad, however, Harry’s entire body was trembling.
But by halfway through his bowl Harry brain which had gotten louder and louder with every spoon was now screaming at him. Dropping the spoon Harry shuddered and turned away from the sight of the food. It didn’t matter how much he wanted to please Draco he couldn’t force himself to pick up the spoon again.
“Tom,” he could do nothing about the fact he caressed the name as it spilled past his lips, but Tom didn’t seem to mind.
Neither boy even blinked at the sight, both of them having being informed of the relationship a week ago now. Draco sat down on the armchair and Harry climbed onto his lap, laying his head down on Draco’s shoulder and hummed quietly to himself, looking out the window.
He gave Draco a friendly one-armed hug, then did the same with Harry before heading off to the Floo room. Harry liked the hugs he got from Blaise but was still hesitant about what was acceptable friendly behaviour. He had a feeling that was one reason Blaise had suddenly started greeting and departing with hugs. So, he could both see and feel what was normal.
“Your stay there might not be the most comfortable, but it is vital. I have already had this discussion with you before. If it wasn’t so important to the War efforts, then things might have been different. Be that as it may, this is how it has to be.” Dumbledore said firmly.
He stretched out on his bed and closed his eyes, not in the mood to do anything more than doze for a while. His eyes snapped open when he heard his door being unlocked. His trepidation didn’t disappear when his cousin entered, followed by his best friend.
Silver eyes narrowing in determination Draco strode back to his room. He had a plan to create to get him into the wing search it for whatever was calling him and get back out without anyone else being the wiser. He didn’t want to piss off his parents or push the Dark Lord, even if he was behaving like a reasonable person and not the tyrannical maniac his parents had told him stories about. Draco sat down at his desk and pulling a parchment towards him began to plan pulling all his Slytherin cunning to the test.
Severus knock once on the door then entered. Tom looked up from the paperwork scatted all over his desk. The potions Severus had been creating had done their job and now the Dark Lord looked like his human self with his dark hair and brown eyes once more in place. The only snake traits he kept were a hint of scales on his skin. Internally he still had the snake’s ability to see in inferred and their incredible sense of smell.
“Yes, Harry. It’s normal for a bunch of boys to bond by roughhousing. We did it in Slytherin all the time.” He said, his hand moving from the back on his neck to run through his hair
The whole hall gasped as one turned to look at Harry. White-faced Harry slumped down doing his best to disappear.
“Harry, what happened yesterday?” Ron asked in a whisper leaning in close. Even Hermione looked interested. Harry looked around and while no one was paying them much attention there still were students passing them as they walked to the great hall.
“If I have created it successfully it should bring back more of your homo sapient features whilst leaving the Serpentes ones alone.”
“Um, right. Ok?” Harry replied confused and Tom swept away before the Gryffindor could gather his wits and refuse.
Narcissa had retreated to her chambers to rest after such strenuous spellcasting and it was only now that Severus realised, they were in Malfoy manor. Lord Voldemort had promised to look into the circumnutate that had ended up the Severus being a father without knowing it. And Severus was here watching his son take one breath after another.
“I also want my lover to promise me he will tell me the instant I do something that he does not like.” Tom stared without compromise into Severus’ eyes.
Looking back at his papers, a smile crept across Tom’s face as he spotted the last piece he had been looking for. Getting a new piece of parchment. Tom put all the pieces into place.
Harry thankfully stopped advancing once he reached Draco’s side, although he bared his teeth at Blaise, who was smart enough to not take it as a smile. Draco the little fucking shit didn’t seem at all concerned that the boy-who-lived had penetrated the Malfoy manor. Instead, he casually put a possessive hand on the back of Harry’s neck, smirking smugly. Oh man, they were so going to have words the first chance Blaise got to get them alone.
“Yes! Yes,” Severus said fervently, not caring what Tom was asking so long as he continued to touch him. Tom gave him a wicked grin then bent and opening his mouth swallowed him down to the root in one continues motion. Severus’ entire body jerked, and he came instantly. Vision whitening out from the power of his orgasm.
“Ok, Shite, I so not equip to do this talk but fuck it, I’m the only one available. Listen up, Prongslett, I’m going to try to explain things to you. So first off, when Snape said people who love each other do that, he wasn’t talking about family members, he meant lovers.”
“No one wants you?” Severus asked trying to clarify. This was what Harry was objecting to? Not any of the frankly overly possessive claims?
“I see,” Dumbledore frowned, then said. “We will have to examine Harry to make sure he attached no other cures to him. I am the first to admit that I may have missed something. I will never claim to be all-knowing.” The crowd looked at him with awe and honour as he humbled himself before them. The only ones who weren’t were Sirius and Harry. “I will ask that for your help, for there is the chance that your eyes might see something mine did not.”
“I want you to leave most of the fighting to me, Harry,” Lucius said as the two of them headed to the entryway. He expected Harry to object and was therefore pleased when Harry nodded.
Severus got to spend his weekends ‘looking for the boy-who-lived’ which translated into him spending the time with his son in the splendour of Malfoy manor. Dumbledore spread out his teaching duties between the rest of the staff. Out of pity for their overworked load. Severus had been allocating most of his detentions during the week. Something that had not gone unnoticed by his colleges if the slightly more friendly interactions were any sign.
Tom smiled pleased and stood up, walking over to Severus. He tilted his chin, then softly kissed him.
Harry managed to nod his head and with an angry huff Vernon turned and lumbered back to his bedroom closing and locking Harry door on the way. Harry’s whole face felt swollen and it hurt to move his jaw. Dully Harry sat still waiting for the sun to rise, the pain would keep him awake which meant that Vernon would not de disturbed for the rest of the night.
Severus knew he had bombarded Harry just as he awoke while he was still trying to get settle and felt bad about it, but he didn’t want to waste any time on useless pleasantries as he knew himself well enough to know if he could find a reason to tarry he would do so and one thing would lead to another, the next thing Harry would do something that annoyed him and in his pride, he would refuse to apologise to someone who owed him an apology and so on and so forth until months or even years would pass with Severus never admitting his wrongdoing. Not wanting to head down that path he was resolute that the pair of them would take this new beginning and start off on the right note.
Harry opened his mouth to say, cast a spell, but paused. Dumbledore was one of the smartest people alive, and there was a room filled with fully trained people. If there was some other way someone would have said it.
Woodenly Harry got to his feet and walked over to the door. He opened it and obediently followed the Headmaster back to the kitchen.
Harry never wanted to put his godfather in that position, so he made sure he went outdoors for Sirius as often as he could. Ever since he had become an Obscurial, he had sensed Sirius emotions, and he knew it was the same in reverse. Poor Sirius had to deal with the whole gauntly of messy human feeling whereas Harry only had to deal with the much more simplistic animal range. It was this that made Harry unconcerned about Sirius while everyone was pulling long faces around him. He could feel that Sirius was happy exploring in both his Grimm or smoke form, enjoying his unbound freedom for the first time in his life. As far as Sirius was concerned it didn’t get better than this. No obligations or expectations to tie him down, and no prisons of stone or house to keep him from roaming. Topped off with the unconditional love from his godson. The soul of Sirius couldn’t ask for more than that.
Harry looked up curiously, and Sirius continued. “Yep, these fucking bad boys are to show the world that I’ve been there fucking done that and shat all over the stupid fucking tee shirt. But as cool as they are, that’s not what I want to show you.” He turned around and Harry stared at his back. It didn’t have as many tattoos so there was not as much to distract Harry from noticing that like him Sirius spine poked out as a knobby line going down the centre of his back. He could also count Sirius ribs. There was a very good chance that Harry was actually in a better condition than his godfather was.
“It tickles a little but Draco does a good job, See?” He pulled off both of his slippers and Severus saw more rainbow nails these glittered. And yet Harry still hadn’t repeated a colour.
“May I?” he asked. Positioning himself at Severus opening. Severus’ body was so relaxed that it was too much effort to nod.
Harry felt someone grab his ankle and he kicked out feeling his foot connect with something solid was enough to tear him away from the last of his sleep and he sat up in bed looking around wildly.
“Harry, I was hoping to take a moment of your time. Do you remember when I said I had to talk with you about something important but that we couldn’t do it yet?”
Surprisingly, the newspapers had not made a big deal about Harry’s disappearance. There had been a small article five pages in that briefly mentioned that Harry was off getting medical attention from the horrible incident from last year subtly implying Harry’s mental state was shaky but after that nothing. Severus knew this was one of Fudge’s attempts to steal power away from Dumbledore, but for once no one was unhappy with it. Dumbledore didn’t want to get the public to get into a panic over the loss of the boy hero and abandon all hope. So long as Harry existed, even if he wasn’t visible, they could use him and a symbol to rally the banners. The Dark Lord also had no issues with this as the fewer people were looking for Harry, the better protected he was. It gave him more time to heal and recover.
Utterly humiliated Harry slid out of the bed. The air blew against the soaked area making the skin around his penis break into goosebumps. He took the offered clothes and shuffled off to the showers feeling the sticky wet sensation clinging to him. Bile burnt his throat and the acid of self-disgust swirled in his stomach.
There was an answering squeak and something invisible disappeared. Draco looked back at his book. He knew from trial and error that unless Harry dragged him with him, then he didn’t want to be hovered over. Draco was willing to listen to his mate and thankfully they had compromised on this issue. If Harry wasn’t in Draco’s sight then he would have a house-elf with him. To help him if he needed it and make sure he didn’t hurt himself. Neither had really like the end results, Harry didn’t want someone with him when he wanted to be alone, and Draco didn’t want Harry to be out of his view. But they had both thought this was a fair to each other.
“Both my despicable behaviour towards your person while you were a student under my care and my hubris leading me to see your father in your stead. Such failure led me to miss the signs of your abuse which left you to suffer for longer.”
“No, that’s not true, I don’t know what that man was doing. I was going through the budget when the Aurors escorted me out. And there is enough to hire a least two teachers per subject and get a couple more elective classes running again.”
While Narcissa got to work weaving Voldemort prepared a quick ritual to see how close they could tie Severus with Harry. They already had the fact they were both human, male, and British. But those were terribly weak ties, even the fact Severus was his teacher wasn’t that much of an improvement. What they were hoping for was the fact their family trees met up somewhere in the past. If Severus turned out to be Harry cousin so many times removed that would be perfect. All of Britain wizarding families were so interbred that the chances were quite high. The closer they were related the stronger Severus would be able to sing the healing the better it would be for Harry.
In a convenient move, the fact Dumbledore and the Order had both arrested Lucius and then stall his trial meant that Lucius could now claim he had seen the terrible state Harry had been in during Summer and doing his civic duty and what any decent soul would do had rescued him. Taking him to his home and giving the Hero of the light the best care available while doing all in his power to make sure Harry’s reputation was not smeared by keeping his presence there unknown to all but a few. He then unfairly was sent to prison by evil Dumbledore and his lot. Lucius piously suffering for doing the right thing. And he would do it without complaint to sacrifice himself for his family and the Boy-who-lived.
Harry swayed, looking around searchingly. When he caught sight of Severus, he began a drunken stumbling run towards him. Severus at once shot forward to meet him. Harry halted an arm’s length away at looking at Severus desperately. Severus could see a change in Harry’s eyes. They looked clearer than they had.
Harry stood on the platform 9 ¾ flexing his newly painted fingers in anticipation. The Hogwarts Express was gleaming in the sunlight. He had improved so much from the constant care and loving attention that his father and Mate had given him that Narcissa had declared him healthy enough to go back to school for his sixth year.
Severus concluded that he should move away from the person topics for the moment until he had, had a chance to research and practice them. He would stick to the facts whilst remaining honest. Nothing would work quicker to break down any trust he gained then to lie to the boy. He could attribute this as true from his childhood.
There was nothing better than a story of star-crossed lovers, schoolboy rivals that slowly overcome their enemy for each other forced to see each other in a new light during Harry’s recovery. It had everything it needed. The hurt/comfort aspect, mated for life, overcoming the odds and a tyrant to be together. All helped along by the fact both Draco and Harry were quite good looking.
He had been through so much over his lifetime, but he couldn’t be happier with how it had turned out. He had a mentor and guide in Tom, loving family in Lucius and Narcissa. A constant, faithful companion in Sirius. And most of all, he was blessed with a perfect Father in Severus and his brilliant mate Draco.
“Don’t worry about it, we’ll chalk this one up as a learning mistake. Merlin knows I fucking made a gallon of them when I first started to live with your dad. Your Granddad had to pull me aside and have a talk. Cause just like you Pup, I came from a fucked-up family and I didn’t know what was normal. I’m going to return the favour, although I’m afraid I ain’t half as good as your Granddad was. I’m sorry you’re stuck with my bollocks up head to guide you but there is fucking nothing we can do to change things. Despite how much I fucking wish there was.”
“I’m concerned that Draco may push for a physical relationship. Harry is not ready for such a thing at the moment. And depending on what he went through at the hands of the muggles he might never be ready for one.”
“What?” Severus said legitimately shocked. Harry had been with the Malfoy’s for almost two months. Surely to Merlin they had noticed the boy’s disappearance before now!
“No, go after Lucius. While extremely uncomfortable the Order does not mean him any harm. Merlin have mercy, they don’t do too much damage before we can get him back home.” Severus choked out.
Mr Malfoy had looked up when he entered the room but was giving Harry some space. Draco had been pulled away from his side by Narcissa to meet with some teacher that was going to help him with his Eros side and Snape was off talking with Voldemort.
“Is the situation with Harry worse than the exposer to dementors that Lucius is suffering through? I only have enough resources to rescue them one at a time. If you tell me yes, I’ll believe you and I will leave Lucius where he is for the moment and pull Harry out. Otherwise, I’m so sorry, but I’m going after Lucius and Harry will be the very next thing I promise. But he will have to wait.” Tom said calmly, ready to change his orders at the very first sign of Severus say so. Severus bowed his head and answered.
Which brought him to his next brooding subject. How in the name of merlin was Harry his son? He knew the test was correct, if not for the fact Voldemort one of the most powerful and talented wizards performed them than because the healing song worked so well. But he could not recall ever having sex with Lily. Not while they were friends and certainly not in the time allocated for Harry to be born nine months later. By that stage, he had not spoken to Lily in about four years. He would have sworn that they had never even kissed before. For while he grew to love Lily, she never saw him as more than her best friend.
They sat down and they served the first course, Harry was internally proud when he saw his plate of food was the same as the others except for portion size. He had worked quite hard to get off the porridge foodstuff and back to normal food.
He watched as Harry closed his mouth looking a little sheepish. Severus sighed then looked back at his notes, he had not expected Harry to talk at this stage and so with all the questions he had lost his spot. Severus felt the first hints of annoyance and nerves entering his bloodstream as the question was not asked in the correct order. They were all over the place and huge chunks of information had been missed or skipped. He knew that even though he was itching to sort out the information and put it into its correct place, it would be best if he just summarised it otherwise they would end up being here for ages the information instead of being concise and detail would become hopelessly confusing.
“Yes, Aunt Petunia,” Harry said by rote and stiffly got to his feet before grabbing his tatted shoes.
“My family doesn’t like magic, which means they don’t like me much, so they don’t always feed me as much as I would like. That doesn’t mean I'm abused!”
“You will, or else Dad is going to hear about all the perverted gay things you having being getting up to.”
He quickly got dressed and exited the bathroom. He sat down in the sunroom waiting for Draco and Blaise. They had finished up with their tutors for the day. The last had been a duelling tutor, someone Tom had suggested. It had pleased Harry to see that even with his twig legs he did well with this subject. He pushed himself harder here than anywhere else. Draco’s protection lay in his hands and he wanted to make sure he was the best he could be to look after his mate.
“Tell me, Harry Potter, is there a particular reason Dumbledore decided to abuse the Hero of the light?”
“The two of them are wondering the remote moors of Scotland. I believe they will accept my presence again since I gave them gifts, but I worry that introducing a second person may be too much for them. The last thing I want to do is frighten Harry off, or Merlin forbid turn him back into an Obscurus,” Severus explained to Draco directly.
Sirius smirked. “They may call me a fucking crazy nutter, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have mad skills. The wankers dismiss me cause I’m not kissing arse like it’s going out of style. But this loony mother fucker can still pull a prank over Dumbledore's eyes.”
“I am aware.” Severus paused for a minute then continued. “If it's not too much trouble I would request that you be the one to look, my Lord.”
“I murder them and many other parents and committed multiple crimes and atrocities. I will not excuse my action or try and wiggle out of accepting responsibility. I was running a war and I can assure you that both sides committed terrible sins”
They revived Harry just outside of Grimmauld place. He was then frog marched into the house before he had gotten his senses back. As soon as he entered through the door, there was a frantic yell
“My loyalty to the Light is no more,” Severus told him exhaustedly. “They are nothing but hypocrites and liars. They allow children to be sent back to their abusers and they worship the Potters, who are nothing more than a bully and a rapist.”
Padfoot lingered for another moment then reluctantly moved giving Harrys cheek one last lick before slowly jumping off the bed and heading out the doors.
He bit his lip as the abasement of the act whelming up once more and he shuffled around the corner and into sight. Both of his best friends had shut up and were not talking once he reached them. Harry noticed from the corner of his eye that his bed had been stripped and all the linen was gone.
Harry beamed, puffing up his chest, so proud to be acknowledged as Severus’ son. The sight was funny, but no one laughed. This was far too precious to be ruined with laughter. Even friendly laughter.
He was in Knockturn Alley’s oldest pub. It had no name but was the most popular place to meet with contacts or offer your services. Like everyone else there, Tom was hooded and had cast a concealment charm so that no one could see under his hood. He had just finished his meeting with one of his spies when the door pushed open and of all people, Dumbledore staggered in.
They were forced to stop once the last of the web disintegrated but they had done enough. Harry was no longer sitting on death’s door. He was still severely malnourished but was no longer a living skeleton. they had also pulled nearly all of his organ back from the brink of complete failure. And his condition was stable once more. The earliest they could place him in another Healing web would be a week. Not due to the lack of supplies but because the body needed that long to reset before being exposed to that particular magic again. The longer they could stretch out the healing webs the better it would be for Harry in the long run. Even if it meant that his initial healing was dragged out longer.
“I promise,” Severus vowed. A smile broke across Tom’s face, and he leaned back, looking entirely pleased with himself. He picked up the comb and once more brushed Severus’ hair. Tom had every intention of doing exactly what he had said.
“You will, or I'll tell Dad I saw you taking it up the ass. That I saw you with some pervert old men.”
“One of the failures of society is its belief that a woman cannot rape a man. This is in fact incorrect. Women can and do rape men far more often than what we expect.”
Draco cupped Harry face lifting it. “You don’t understand anything, I want you. I’ve wanted you all along, right from the moment we met before I even knew your name. I want every little part of you, why haven’t you let me?”
“I will do my best not to disturb him but it is vitally important that I talk to him.” he looked down at Harry who had tightened his grip of Padfoot almost strangling him.
“You came out here to be close to Sirius you had a bad dream, and it was triggering your Obsurial side. I’m out here to help my mate and remind him who he is.”
She stroked his hair, smiling down at him. Harry could feel Draco completely relax and he leant against his mother’s leg. It was the first time they had voluntarily touched in months. Harry knew it was Draco’s hindbrain finally placing Narcissa back into parent category and not a potential rival. Logically Draco knew better, but his Eros instincts didn’t listen to logic. As both Eros fussed over him Harry glanced across the room where Tom and his dad were sitting out of the range of fire. Tom slightly raised his mug in a salute and mouthed the words ‘well played’.
Harry had once explained this theory to Blaise, who had been whining about how long Draco was taking to get ready. Harry wasn’t sure he had explained it properly because Blaise had gotten a funny look on his face and said blankly. “Right, of course,” He had turned away but Harry had still heard the sour mutter, “Fucking made for one another.” Still, he had never bothered complaining about the time Draco took again, so Harry counted it as a win.
“Oh, trust me, Severus, I want to.” Tom put his fingers under Severus’ chin and lifted his head. Then he lent in and slowly brushed their lips together. It was nothing like the awaked squish Severus had performed. Tom moved slowly, cradling Severus head in his hands. His whole demeanour radiated power, dominance and smugness. Severus had no idea what to do, but Tom did. He easily took the lead and slowly, like he was in no hurry to get anywhere, took possession of every millimetre of Severus’ lips. By the time they drew apart, Severus was gasping for breath and Tom’s eyes had darkened considerably.
He stayed like that for hours getting just enough air that he didn’t black out but not much more. This was a living torment as Harry constantly fought to breathe. Trying to stay balanced on the knives edge was slowly driving him mad. But the knowledge that if he stopped, he would suffocate pushed him on.
And that, that was a real struggle. Harry was used to eating once every day or so. To suddenly find himself being offered food so many times in a single day was extremely off-putting. It wasn’t the amount of food. Narcissa had been the one to say how much Harry got and she was spot on. By the time he finished the little bowl, his stomach felt comfortable full. And that in its self was something Harry hadn’t know he could feel. Either his stomach was empty or Harry had gored himself and it was very uncomfortable it almost felt like it was going to tear apart. On those occasions, Harry would end up vomiting all the food back up. He always felt guilty for wasting good food. Yet relieved that it was no longer inside of him. As he had gotten older, he had stopped goring himself at the opening feast. Instead, he would squirrel away bits of food and slowly increase the amount he ate over the school year.
“Don’t worry, he will be back to his normal amount of snark once he has had a cup of tea,” Draco reassured him.
Draco would have had to be blind to miss the way Harry was constantly gazing at him. And blind he was not. Draco had always loved been admired so it filled him with great pleasure that Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away. He made sure to find the best lighting in each room and spend ampule of time in the light so that Harry had plenty of opportunity to look to his heart content. Draco also made sure that he took Harry to different spots in the manor so that he could see Draco in a multitude of different light settings. He had felt enough from Harry to know he wasn’t aroused by the sight but he was fascinated which was surprising all Draco needed.
“It's one of them, the one we retrieved when I left with Dumbledore.” I pause, thinking for a moment, “I think I need to finish this, what Dumbledore was doing. I have to go find them, somehow, and kill him.”
Draco finished in a rush, “I was so excited to meet you and I just really wanted to be your friend, and instead I made a fool out of myself.” He closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself, then added, “I’d like to start over, Potter. Please.”
I suppose I am expecting something, or at least hoping, so finding a piece of ink stained parchment, a letter and an envelope sends a thrill through my body. They're pressed into the wood they have been lost there for ages, forgotten. I pick up the envelope first, delicately. It's addressed to Sirius, mailed from Godric Hallow. My heart stutters. It must be from them, isn't it? I smooth the letter out and begin to read an account, from my mother, of her new life as a mom. The letter is warm and hopeful, full of sentiments long foreign to this world.
“The necklace, however,” Dumbledore continues, “I can’t imagine how you managed to pull that one off.”
Then I find myself sprawled on the yellowed bedding of Grimmauld Place with no concept of time, dripping with sweat. My forehead pulses, a more physical pain this time, though my soul is crying out.
“Are you trying saying he really did it? Mate, come on.” Weasley pulls at Potter’s shoulder, to which the maniac jabs back at him with his elbow, and Weasley backs off looking all the more alarmed.
But, the traitorous truth was, as Ron pointed out, that we couldn't let the Ministry find him. We'd made the mistake of going to them too long ago to go back. The Minister couldn't be trusted. Fudge would take this as proof, hard-hitting evidence that
Several moments passed and Draco’s tension mounted. Potter appeared to be thinking hard. Draco didn’t know what he’d do if his apology was thrown back in his face. He just wanted a chance, a real chance to become Potter’s friend, and this would be the deciding moment.
Draco lay still for a moment, missing the feel of Potter’s body against his own. He sighed softly, then grinned when he thought about everything he wanted to do to the man later.
He continued, “I’ve been thinking about it and…that’s kind of narrow-minded. And I’m sorry. If Weasley is your friend, then he must have good qualities worthy of friendship. I shouldn’t have acted how I did. I…”
The girl moans distressingly and peeks out of the stall, “Oh it was terribly dark! Deaths, many deaths he said. He wouldn't stop on these ‘plans’, and the death. The gruesome, bloody
My voice gutteral and abrasive, “I should think so.” Then I Crucio him as well. Out of the corner of my eye, Narcissa’s cracking mask brings me only a glimmer of pleasure.
A warm hand squeezes my thigh, “Harry, you know he's still harmless, no matter how much he barks. We can't let him be a priority. We need to stay safe.”
I take my first real look at the envelope. It's stamped with the Ministry seal. I tear it open hastily, pulling out the letter. “It's from Minister Scrimgeour. He's made an appointment at two o’clock here, with Hermione, Ron, and I.”
Ashamed, of course, that I'd gotten myself caught up in this war in the first place. Angry that Potter, Weasley, and Granger have got me by a leash while simultaneously being the only people keeping me alive. Scared that my mother and father are being killed, or worse, tortured because of what I failed to do and did at the same time. Melancholy because of what I did do, on my own accord or not, and because of who's hurting because of it. Anxious because all this lays on my mind and shoulders. And paranoid that life as I know it, no matter how dreary and dry, could be taken away from me at a moment's notice by either side or none at all; that they could find me and destroy us all, that hope could be lost forever.
I ache for them like never before, imagining that sliver of domestic bliss. How badly I want someone now, someone to take this weight from me. At one point I thought that person was Dumbledore, but he’s only seemed to add to it.
“No! You don't get to tell me what to do. Not this time,” My brain feels awfully fuzzy, but I shake my head and lean a leg backward for support, raising my wand higher, “I know how to defeat Voldemort and I'm going to do it. You either let us stay, or we’ll leave now.”
Outside, we all hear a crash and jump. “Let's leave them,” I say quietly, “they won’t know who they are, and the muggles will suppose they’re burglars or something. Come on.” I grab Malfoy by the arm.
We sit in silence until a waitress, a tall girl with buzzed hair and a pinched nose, lazily asks what we’d like to drink. Her nostrils flare just begging the question.
Hermione runs her finger along the cork in the bottle of solvent before popping it open and dissolving the monsoon powder in. She almost told Harry that she'd forgotten it, just to make Malfoy
“I'm sorry, Professor. This was never supposed to happen.” My throat feel dry from pulling out those empty words. I reach out and place a hand over Dumbledore’s heart, willing it to beat again. The tears on my cheek are burning hot, a stark contrast from the icy wind that blows through my hair.
“Sure, it’s a little odd,” agrees Hermione finally, “but whatever it is, it’s a good thing. You and Malfoy don’t need to be enemies anymore. You’re both of age. The war is over. If this is Malfoy finally growing up and becoming civil, then there is no point fixating on it. Just accept it and move on.”
Malfoy misinterprets this. “I see you about to make another metaphor out of that and I warn you, I will walk away.”
Harry had always thought that his growing relationship with Draco was something special. Something different. But seeing Draco with his other friends, perhaps it wasn’t anything particular at all. Just a convenient friendship with a colleague, to bide the time during the workday until he could go out with his real friends.
“I don’t care if you don’t want to hear it. Malfoy confessed to a crime. We have to return and arrest him.”
Harry Potter breathes in without fear for the first time in years. Inexplicably, he’s alive and Voldemort’s dead. Nobody can say the boy who lived hasn’t earnt his name now. He stands up on his good leg, though even that is an overstatement. No bone or organ of Harry’s
Perhaps Harry’s intentions hadn’t been clear enough. Perhaps he should have been more straight forward with Draco. But really, wasn’t it obvious? Did he really have to say it?
“I think we’ve overstayed our welcome, Harry.” Draco whispered over the table jokingly. “They’re giving us a sign.”
“I wouldn’t be so quick to judge,” Draco retorted, thinking on his feet. “I can just imagine you on speakerphone so you can use both your hands to touch yourself, you greedy bastard.”
Harry steps up to the fireplace so he can see Malfoy’s face. It is composed, showing only the movement of the flames in his eyes.
“You weren’t too bad yourself, Malfoy,” Harry said over his shoulder, bright sunshine lighting up the winning grin he did ever so well. Reporters loved it. Fans loved it. And Draco was absolutely besotted with it.
Malfoy, still seated on the floor of the cupboard, stares up at Harry disbelievingly. “You’re the boy who
“Why, Potter,” Malfoy said, a cheeky smile appearing on his face, “I thought you’d never ask. I’d love to.”
Malfoy sighs, not like he needs to, not like he can’t help himself, but likes he wants Harry to feel his irritation. “I’m
Pansy’s face freezes in place, not knowing how to take this information. “That’s…good?” She hedges. "Are you – “
it. You have to love without reason or hope or encouragement. When you love, you don’t expect anything in return, you love because you must, because you don’t know any other way.”
Harry was definitely blushing now. He needed to regain some of his dignity. “What makes you think you’d ever have a chance at getting me in
“He also said you’d say it wasn’t true,” Harry says quickly. His heart is pounding against his ribs, desperate to break free. He’s nervous and dazed and ready to faint, but he’s hanging on. Hanging on for Malfoy.
It’s particularly infuriating because Harry can’t even call him out on it. He knows if he does Malfoy’s just going to deny it and push Harry away again. But it doesn’t make sense! He doesn’t feel the same way Harry does. That’s obvious. But he feels
No. It’s too good an opportunity to miss. As soon as Harry turns a corner out of Malfoy’s line of sight, he pulls back on his invisibility cloak and casts a silencing charm on himself. He suspects his breathing gave him away last time. Then he is hurrying back to Malfoy’s room as quickly as his legs will carry him, trusting the silencing charm to cover his footsteps.
Potter’s eyes return to Draco, pleading for advice. The only thing stopping Draco from laughing out loud at Potter’s face are the table manners his mother installed in him from an early age. He motions with his hands, and a slight twitch of his lips to take a small sip,
Potter’s lips fell from Draco’s neck when his humping became more insistent - he was no longer pulling back but pushing down against Draco constantly, rubbing his cock up Draco’s length with the most delightful friction.
“Right,” Potter said, voice a little breathless, as if he’d just spent most of his energy on giving someone multiple hickeys (!!!), “Malfoy, I dare - “
“Yes, Draco,” Potter answered immediately, his voice louder now, less cold, “because that’s what love is! A potion or a spell can’t tell you what to feel, you have to actually
Malfoy stares back at Zabini for a moment, his mouth opening and closing, like he is on the verge of revealing something. He looks back down to Harry and his jaw tightens. “Let him go, now.”
Harry took a relieved breath. It wasn’t as bad as he thought. He hadn’t really revealed anything. Of course he wouldn’t want to kiss Malfoy. That would be ridiculous.
It’s not that he and Malfoy are on good terms. Far from it. But they don’t know Malfoy like Harry does. They haven’t been his rival for over ten years. They haven’t earnt the right to speak about him in that way.
Malfoy appears beside Alex and gently holds onto her shoulder. “It’s alright,” he says in a soft careful voice Harry’s never heard from him before. “You don’t have to do anything. We’re going to fix it, okay?”
“Oh no, Potter. You’ve hurt my feelings,“ Draco said sarcastically despite the truth in his words. Potter had quite a power over Draco’s feelings.
Malfoy’s fake smile vanishes to be replaced by exaggerated pity. “Are you really this slow, Potter? I don’t have the patience for this. Let’s try again.” He raises his wand and targets Harry once more. “Avada Kedavra.”
Hermione all but ran off the stage and Draco watched as Pansy immediately made a beeline for her. He turned to Potter to point this out, but Potter had disappeared. Draco’s heart dropped into his stomach. Perhaps Potter hadn’t been as into him as he thought.
want it. We should just wait it out,” Harry suggests through gritted teeth. He doesn’t want to, of course. He wants to fuck Malfoy continuously for the next 24 hours, maybe more. But his resolve is strong. No desire could ever be enough to take advantage of Malfoy like that.
“It goes both ways, Potter,” Draco pointed out, very much annoyed. “You hate me, so what does it matter how I feel?”
Draco considers this. He wouldn’t have pegged Potter as the fancy restaurant type. Especially not the fancy restaurant that serves a £450 bottle of wine. He wouldn’t have pegged Potter as the going out for dinner type at all. Except maybe to the pub. Urgh. Pansy wants to meet him at a pub tomorrow. Revolting.
I can get a sample of your potion now. Then, Professor Slughorn and I can start work on the antidote immediately.”
.” Draco interrupts, his words tightly articulated, nothing like the smooth, calm voice Harry has grown accustomed to recently.
Malfoy smirks. “Too easy again, Potter.” He stacks his breakfast plate casually, as if he hasn’t just claimed to be dating Harry. “Have some self-control.”
And then those lips actually started sucking. And Draco lost control of all his motor functions. At least that was the only explanation for the excruciatingly
“Yes, I know,” Malfoy says calmly, or at least with a pretense of calmness. “It’s under control. Harry isn’t part of this.”
Harry watches warily as the knife waves under his chin. At this point it seems more likely that Malfoy will accidentally stab him rather than intentionally.
“I’ll admit I’m a little bit tipsy,” Harry said with an apologetic smile - just as delightful as the previous one. “I needed the courage to ask you out. But if we’re going to start dating instead of, you know, just having sex in empty operating rooms, I think I should be able to call you Draco all the time.”
So he did. Or at least he tried. The snitch seemed to know he was coming and zoomed to the side at the last millisecond. Draco tried again, the snitch few away. Frustrated, he reached out with both hands, but only continue to grasp air.
Draco snorted. “That’s your big revelation? It’s hardly news. I don’t hate you either, Potter. Because I’m not a child. Obviously.”
Harry had learnt early on that the longer Draco slept, the safer he felt. When they first starting dating, Draco hardly slept at all when Harry stayed the night, and he refused to even try Harry’s bed. But after time, the trust grew, and now Draco always slept longer with Harry. Not that they slept apart much anymore. Only occasionally when Harry worked overnight on a case.
Harry wanted to point out that perhaps talking about it would be easier if Draco wasn’t straddling him but he wasn’t so sure Draco would take it the right way. He tried adjusting his position with an inconspicuous shuffle but that only made the situation worse. He concentrated on keeping his face composed instead. “Alright. What do you want to talk about?”
“Truth!” Draco yelled out quickly, turning to Potter. ‘I choose truth.” Whatever dare Potter was planning - however tame - Draco couldn’t do it. Not right now.
“No, Potter, don’t even try to make this better. Unless you’re going to willingly let me obliviate you, there’s nothing you can–“
Before Mrs Dunberg can answer, there is a loud bang from further in the house. Mrs Dunberg doesn’t react.
Harry considers visiting the hospital ward but quickly shoots the idea down. This is Draco Malfoy. He is Harry Potter. They hate each other. Why would he visit? But Merlin, he has to know what’s wrong. Madam Pomfrey said she could cure Malfoy so it can’t be anything permanent, but how bad is it? Is he in pain? Harry can’t stop his mind from jumping to terrible conclusions. Malfoy might be in agony right now because of Harry’s thoughtless potion experiment.
“I shouldn’t have let that happen. Again, I’m sorry. I’m a prat.” He drops his hand and grips his broom with both. His words become mocking. “Don’t know what you expected, really. I’m Draco Malfoy, remember?”
Harry means to go slow now. He wants to hold up Malfoy’s chin, and run a hand through his hair. He wants to lean in slowly and feel Malfoy’s breath on his lips before he goes in for a gentle kiss. He wants to make Malfoy see how much he really does care for him, exactly as he is.
Harry gulps. This shouldn’t be arousing. “If you’re not an alpha, then why are you being so aggressive?”
Pansy smiled gleefully - she always liked knowing things Draco didn’t. “Some people think that everyone has
On his way back up to the seventh floor, a small vindictive part of Draco hoped Potter had been caught by a teacher and punished. But a bigger, more controlling part of him was holding onto the hope that Potter would be exactly where Draco left him - he couldn’t very well prove his point without Potter.
Harry reset the machine and gave it a quick wipe down - he still wasn’t sure how Draco had managed to get coffee everywhere but in the cup. It might have been impressive if it wasn’t so disastrous.
Hermione’s voice was unexpected. She must have left Potter with Ronald. Draco rolled over to face her.
” Harry corrected. He hadn’t said the name in so long it felt strange on his tongue. But he liked it. Fuck, he really liked it.
There’s something off about Malfoy when Harry meets him by his dorm in the morning. Yet, he’s dressed the same as the first day with slicked back hair, grey slacks, a button up shirt and Harry’s tie. Harry runs his eyes back and forth over the uniform, trying to pick out what’s not quite right.
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Harry wanted to take them back. He heard Ron’s sharp intake of breath beside him. For once, Parkinson was silent. It was a terrible thing to ask of Malfoy, even more horrible to dare him.
Harry hesitated and then accepted the bottle. He took a swig and dropped down next to Malfoy. On Malfoy’s bed. He passed the bottle back.
Harry hands it over reluctantly. The cloak isn’t designed for two adults so they’re huddled very closely together. Harry suspects it wouldn’t take much further provocation for Malfoy to send a hex his way.
Harry bristles at Malfoy’s bluntness, raising his chin in response. “And I’m supposed to just listen to you even though you won’t explain anything?”
“Good luck, mate,” Ron said all too soon, pushing Draco through a door and then closing it behind him.
“I haven’t been invited,” Draco interrupted quickly. He was a little sour about it actually. “Senior healers only.”
to enjoy it? It didn’t matter that it was Potter. Even though Potter’s presence alone was enough to make Draco shiver. Even though Potter was very talented at it - how did he even know how to
Anxiety takes hold of Harry as he walks forward and he has to stop himself from clutching his stomach. Madam Pomfrey’s presence can’t mean anything good.
“Who?” Draco asked, mimicking Potter’s position (with a healthy, unassuming thirty or so centimetre gap between them).
“Even without…?” Harry questions. It seems an odd thing to say and Harry wonders what Malfoy almost let slip.
“Come on,” Harry says, standing up – a little too fast, his legs wobble precariously but he keeps his balance. He’s used to the feeling. “I’ll take you to St Mungo’s.”
“I won’t. And I haven’t been.” Pansy’s expression turns apologetic. ‘I’ve been staying at the Manor actually.”
Harry’s question is answered when the tall windows of the sitting room shatter inwards with a bright red light. He just has time to pull his wand from his robes before bodies begin barrelling through the now open windows, all with the same grey masks covering their faces. He counts five before he has to dodge a stunning spell (or at least what he hopes is only a stunning spell). Another spell comes his way and he pulls up a hasty Protego. He sends an Expelliarmus straight back at his attacker, relieved when the wand comes soaring into his hand immediately.
It wasn’t displeasing. Quite the opposite. See, Potter taking a step forward and gliding a single hand over Draco’s cock - not holding it, not stroking it, just the barest teasing graze - before playing with the hairs at Draco’s navels, was very pleasing, to put it lightly. And the reactive shiver that trailed up to the back of his neck making him jump, made that quite obvious.
Draco was supposed to be watching. Not the other way around. This changed things. But when Harry looked back up, glasses firmly planted on his face, along with an expression of undiluted want, Draco decided perhaps it wasn’t too bad this way either. He rubbed himself through his pants awkwardly under Harry’s gaze.
Harry supposed he should feel sorry for the man, losing his parents, losing his money all in one go. But when the man stood there, with a snotty, disinterested expression, dressed in the most inappropriate clothes, that a month of Harry’s shifts still wouldn’t cover, it was hard to feel anything but resentment.
Draco relaxed as his orgasm subsided but he didn’t take his eyes off Potter. Potter was something else. He really was. He was hot and
And if Potter doesn’t turn up, Draco is going to need to find another dinner partner, and he doesn’t fancy seeing his mother (obviously) or enduring another guilt-ridden dinner with a stranger.
“From you?” Harry pretended to think. “Oh nothing. I’m just standing here.” He had been going for a walk of the grounds, but standing put here, irritating Malfoy, was a much better option.
He checks the time. 4.52am. Not the time an innocent man usually hosts guests. Harry dresses fast and Apparates to Malfoy Manor in a matter of minutes.
Malfoy laughs, but it’s not his usual cruel curling inflection. When Harry looks over he’s even smiling in a way that might be genuine.
Harry still doesn’t quite understand. But he can hardly see how his “alpha” status, whatever it is, has any influence on Malfoy’s. “Can’t you be an alpha too?” He asks.
Harry had become a teacher as soon as Hogwarts had reopened – he’d already had some practice teaching from his time leading Dumbledore’s Army, and of course his status as the Wizarding World’s saviour made it quite easy to win the respect of his students.
Malfoy jumps up immediately, avoiding the mix of multi-coloured fluids seeping over the floor between pieces of broken glass.  “Here I thought your hands were the only risk. I greatly underestimated your capacity for disaster.”
Up goes Malfoy’s perfect eyebrow, though his eyes remain lowered. “I think I already made that clear.”
“I was thinking,” Potter said, obviously deciding to shake off Draco’s jab, “I could disguise myself as a Slytherin to safely get past the Durmstrang students.”
Potter was on a first name basis with the Minister for Magic? Draco still hadn’t reached that level and they had sucked each other’s cocks for fuck’s sake. Draco reluctantly handed the drink over to Potter, realising it no longer held any chivalrous value.
Malfoy flicks his wand and Travers’ papers go flying. As much as Harry enjoys the flash of irritation on Travers’ face, he doesn’t laugh. They need to get him onside.
Malfoy’s eyes widen at the threat. He goes to say something and then closes his mouth. He begins to unbutton his shirt, starting at the high collar around his neck.
Harry tries to ignore the last part, as much as it sets him aflame. He can’t think about Malfoy’s body right now. He can’t lose control. “I don’t want it to be forced.”
But the thought of Ginny’s terrified face as Arthur wrenched us apart, strong beautiful Ginny. It's enough to make someone kill.
I didn't want him to be the one to come with me, in fact I'd begged him not to. What would I do now if he was dead?
He looks so that no one would even think that the spell had done him in, that he'd fallen from this building without an ounce of fear or life left in him, that the blood spilling from his cracked skull is no longer warm. Dumbledore’s limbs are twisted inhumanely under the side of his body, but his head is turned up to the stars, eyes open.
I shake my head stiffly and bark, “I don't know! He was hit with a curse or something, just help, please!”
“Shut up!” Hermione exclaims, a bright spell spilling from her wand and onto Walburga’s portrait. Ron leaps back from the painting as the lethal spell hits and I see Malfoy jump as well.
to say Snape, but yeah,” somehow it comes out harsher than I’d meant it. But I'm tired, a truly worn kind of tired that I haven't felt since that night, and that I'm afraid I'm getting used to.
?” As Potter speaks I can see the spittle spraying from his mouth and dribbling down his bottom lip with disgust.
I grimace, anger taking forefront in my mind, and slap the wand into his hand. “Fine, I'll just tell them I lost it. Seems like a Weasley thing to do.”
Whirling winds and Walburga's gross shouts fill my ears as none of us are able to speak or yell, all except for Ron whose voice roars out, “We didn't kill him!” The words cut through the ghost like butter, and it disintegrates into the dust pile it came from. A distinctive aura of fear wavers in the air around us.
Draco suppressed a growl and chose not to reply. Instead, he stood up, walked to Potter’s position, then neatly knelt in front of him.
“Think my name’s funny, do you?” He looked Ron up and down, and sneered, “No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a
The hand I had cupped around my ear slips and my elbow hits the doorknob. I step back as the door flies open. The trio stands before me, Granger gripping the knob and Weasley just behind her. Potter hunches behind them like a shadow, turned away as he wipes his face.
in the red-orange flames, reflecting a burning red so much more fitting for the event than the original blackening purple. They were like skeletal demons risen to life from a cemetery or the pits of hell; what I should have been. What I should be.
“Malfoy might actually be right, Kreacher could still have it, which means we're even closer to find the Hor-” Granger clasps two hands over her mouth.
Remus jumps off of the beast, ankle deep in the murky water, brandishing his wand. He steps forward looking all too cautious, “Hagrid, is… is he dead?”
Draco looked down at his shoes, embarrassed. He realized he was fighting tears at the thought of another rejection from this beautiful boy.
The door falls open and the three step inside, me behind them. They all look with fresh eyes, but I remember being in this room a long time ago. I wandered in as a child and got a hell of a scolding from Auntie Walburga. I tell them this, but they only look more astounded.
Images flash through my mind of the Weasley wedding, the burning tent set ablaze by all those death eaters. Their masks simply
Dumbledore coughs into his hand and shakes his head, “Harry, m’boy, that potion took a lot out of me.”
“I was out of line,” Draco continued. His normally pale cheeks were a bright pink, “I didn’t think– No, that’s not right. My family, no, my Father–” he shook his head, unsure how to continue.
I know she's right. It's not even a deep down gut type of feeling, it's common sense that I could scrape from the brim of my mind. Simply, I just don't want her to be.
Someone cleared their throat loudly and the two young men broke apart, panting. They resettled themselves, Theo settling down next to Longbottom. Draco noted that Theo casually lowered a hand to Longbottom’s thigh and left it there. Longbottom didn’t object, instead he placed his own hand over the back of Theo’s and twined his fingers through his.
I lift my hand and pretend to be interested only in my cuticles “I'll only find out eventually,” I say with a wink. I then gasp for breath as Weasley’s elbow jabs its way into the side of my throat.
Charlie grins proudly, stabbing Neville in the shoulder with his thumb, “Wouldn't gotten back at all if it wasn't for this one. Saved my life.”
Harry bit his lip, and stared in wonder at the silver-haired boy still holding his hand. It was oddly comfortable and he didn’t really want to pull away. He wondered if he’d made the right decision to accept Mal-
“What the bloody hell were you doing!” Potter shouts, teeth bared. Weasley pushes past him to Granger, near the edge of the cluttered sidewalk.
“Mad-Eye I think,” I say. “He probably wanted to ward off Death Eaters and… well, he'd want to ward off–”
I open the door to find Hermione laid out on the couch whispering to Ron below her, both of them barely awake. Malfoy sits by the tapestry still, I can hear his stomach growling from here.
Potter blinked and glared at Draco, seeming to forget Theo altogether in that moment. “Yes, Malfoy, I accept the challenge. Unless you’re afraid and hoping I’ll say no
Ron and Hermione release my arm and take several steps back; I hear their breaths echoing into the night. Malfoy jerks his arm from my hand without a word, looking around himself with an unimpressed expression on his face. Shivers run down our spines from the brittle cold.
As the two shuffle out of the alley, I make to follow them, but Weasley grabs me by the wrist, making me stop before leaving. “You didn't do it, did you? Summon those death eaters?” he asks.
A fresh surge of pain blooms under the skin the hand once held and I hiss at the sensation, “And what was that!”
The bushy-haired witch visibly suppresses a scoff, her nostrils flared and eyes rolling up to the ceiling.
“Mum, I don't think you can tell him what to do on this one. Maybe he knows what he's doing,” Ginny speaks softly.
at least am a bit more level-headed than Harry of late. You're a coward. Nothing more, nothing less. You wouldn't have called them because you wouldn't have anything to gain from it.”
He grabbed Potter by the arm and dragged him into a nearby empty classroom, glad that the day’s classes were done.
As I shoot curse after curse part of the ceiling breaks and a pile of wood chips fall at my feet. My screams reverberate off the walls and into the night.
Dumbledore lands his broom inside of the Astronomy Tower and I follow in suit. The Dark Mark is hanging directly over the Astronomy Tower but the room is empty. They must be here somewhere. They
It was new to him, having to explain his thoughts and feelings. Usually he could pull on his Malfoy mask and pretend to know everything while looking down his nose at the poor soul who clearly had just misunderstood his intent. But that wouldn’t work with Potter, not with this. He had to fix things, he had to make it right. When Potter had rejected his horribly fumbled offer of friendship, he had been surprised at how deeply it hurt him.
“Harry-” Hermione’s eye widen at the sight of me. She takes me unto her arms and I sob into her shoulder, a soothing hand rubbing circles into my back.
Malfoy falls to the ground with a cry as Snape releases him from the curse. His eyes look haunted and empty all the same.
He walks forward on a slight limp, and extends his right arm. I gulp down a sliver of guilt at seeing the purple rings on his wrists and biceps, not even forgotten when I remember what’s practically engraved into his father's left arm. It's not about what he's done, it's about what
Please leave any suggestions or constructive criticisms in the comment section and I'll make sure to get back to you ;)
Dumbledore’s beginning to look incredibly pale and weak again. He holds himself up with a hand on the wall near the balcony’s edge, back where I can’t see.
Molly sniffs and turns her head away as Ron tries to console her. Ron steps back, obviously hurt, but addresses me in particular, “Bring him up to my room. Hermione has the solvent in her bag; he's already taken double doses of polyjuice potion. There- there's dittany in there too, for George.”
Potter seemed to come back to his senses from the initial blankening of his mind at the start of the kiss. He pushed back at Draco’s tongue, fighting for control of the kiss. Potter’s hands rose, one to Draco’s hair, the other gripping the back of Draco’s neck.
Potter stilled beneath Draco at the interruption. He squeezed his eyes tight in embarrassment, remembering all of a sudden that they were not alone in the room. Draco noted Potter’s reaction and smirked. He leaned down and gave Potter a quick kiss to the lips.
I slow my march to a creep up the stairs at the sound of Malfoy’s voice and- it must be- Hermione’s. The boy’s drawl reverberates off the walls, quiet and wispy, but demanding.
“Look, Malfoy, what I'm about to say changes nothing, but you still need to hear it. You need to understand that you can't go back to what you were. There's a price on your head that can only be paid with you alive, and I've seen you to be quite susceptible to the Imperius. Just… remember that before you try to run off, because you
I need to stop thinking of my past, I tell myself. I don't belong there anymore, not even mother can shield me from the Dark Lord’s wrath like she did with Great Auntie. I don't think I can ever go back.
Potter sucked in his breath and bit his lip. Oh how Draco wished to bite it for him! Potter looked nervous for a moment, then grinned and nodded.
Against the opposite wall is a fireplace and a brown sofa. There are two closed doors in the parlor that I recognize as leading to a bathroom and the old room that Ginny and Hermione shared so long ago. Or was it only a couple of years?
She climbs the last step to the hallway of the Burrow on which lies Ron’s room, a path she knows well. Hermione pushes the door open without hesitation, biting down a scowl and the blond boy who sits by the edge of Ron’s bed, unshackled. She plasters on a sickly sweet fake smile and her most sympathetic tone.
“Dare,” Draco said after a moment. He hoped he didn’t come to regret this decision, though he doubted his hope would come true. Theo knew him too well.
He hoped things would turn out well for his friend. They were both a bit drunk, but they clearly showed equal interest in continuing their intimacy at the moment.
Draco took a deep breath. “I’ve only heard about the Weasleys from my family, and they…Well, they have a certain opinion about how wizards and witches are supposed to conduct themselves. Especially pure-blood families, but the Weasleys don’t act like most pure-blood families do. So my family always taught me to look down on them and others like them,” Draco explained. He felt like his words were jumbling themselves up on his tongue, twisting this way and that as he tried to express his thoughts.
As I open my eyes Hermione tugs me up and forward. I can see Molly out of the corner of my eye, tears spilling onto her cheeks. They're all looking at me. I ask them what I've just done.
As I turn away, robes soaking up more blood behind me, I bellow, enunciating every word, “Find me Harry Potter, I want him dead!”
Weasley has his arm on Granger’s shoulder in a disgusting gesture. “Mate, I'm not so sure he even summoned those death eaters. Just look at him!”
“The locket. Merlin how could I have forgotten. We've seen it!” She jumps to her feet, sending Potter backwards onto me.
Harry stumbled backward, throwing his arms out wildly to catch his balance when Malfoy let him go. He’d been caught off-guard, having not expected someone to try and jump him here at Hogwarts - not with Dudders back in the muggle world. Harry readied himself for a fight, wand forgotten.
Hermione gapes at me open-mouthed as the locket falls to the floor with a crack. The old, underused pipes leak from the ceiling, drip, drip, dripping onto the tiled floor.
His eyelids have fallen only halfway closed in a paralyzed state and his skin dead and grey. I find my one hand buried in the cold leather that sticks to his back like a second skin, the other clenched around his loose grip of the motorcycle’s handlebar, my wand caught somewhere in between.
“That isn’t true and we both know it. You aren’t going to kill me and you certainly aren’t loyal to that man.”
“Charlie-” I start but, really, what can I say? He bounds off in the other direction towards Molly, conceding to curiosity and grief.
“I don't want you dead.” Hermione insists, leaving her arm outstretched and offering, but Malfoy scoffs indifferently.
“Here, Malfoy. This will help with the pain.” she reaches out the hand with the bottle in it, sitting down in front of him, but the blond doesn't just take it yet.
The white-blonde boy Harry remembered meeting briefly in Diagon Alley stepped forward after Professor McGonagall’s departure.
Draco watched and waited, biding his time. It was a few days until he finally found a time when Potter wasn’t accompanied by the Weasley boy, and took his chance.
Harry glanced down at the proffered hand, then up at his face defiantly and declared, “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.”
!” I grab Malfoy’s collar and pull him to eye level. He doesn’t move. He doesn’t even speak. He just stares with his unblinkingly blank eyes. They threaten to swallow me up.
His eyes look panicked, pupils dilated, but they gloss over in seconds. I bend over, trying to keep my pace, but I can feel myself losing it, “What did you tell her that you won't tell me?” I say, my top lip curling in a disparaging sneer. I'm met with stark silence. Blood pulses erratically through my veins.
“You wouldn't bloody dare,” I hiss, straightening my back in a small act of defiance against the icy fear that shot down my spine at his words. I find myself regarding him in a new light. I've always known he wasn't the perfect Golden boy that everyone believed him to be, but I had never thought him one to even
My mouth opens, but I shut it closed before a single world is uttered, stepping backwards. As I lift my fallen gaze to match the heat burning in Hermione’s eyes she stalks ever closer.
“Malfoy?” Weasley nearly yawns, eyes bewildered. The two of them are in a state of disarray, I suppose I can't look much better.
“It was. Obviously more clever than any of your Order has been in your protection. Or you as matter of fact. If anyone was privy to this information, as you prolude, they’ve done nothing.”
“You don't have it in you, Malfoy,” I say knowingly with a sigh. “You may think you do, but you don't.”
Potter’s face takes on an expression of disgust, but he does not object. I turn my own separate way to change, hoping the Gryffindors do as well.
Ginny smiles placidly and repeats the words I've heard all too well before, “I really do hope you know what you're doing, Harry,” and walks away.
I've never been good with Obliviate, but I can use it from time to time when necessary. I cast one now, saying clearly, “You came in to work, as usual, and worked your shift. You never saw us, or the customers after us. No customers showed up late, so you decided to close up early. Then you went home.”
I nod and start with the one at my foot. As I go towards the other, Ron shakes his head and points his wand to cast. I suspect it's a particularly strong one.
Grabbing Malfoy by his yellowed collar, I bark, “What did you tell her?” But, Malfoy’s eyes are focused on the wall, as empty and dull as they seemed before.
feels natural, good. This, on the other hand- being here where I don't belong, where everyone is pitted against me, with my friends lives on the line while Voldemort is planning and plotting if what Malfoy said was true- well, I don't even know if what Malfoy said is true. That Voldemort is looking for something? That he has some secret weapon that we don't know about? I suppose we do too, of sorts, but  I dragged him along here and for all I know he could be leading us astray. I thought he deflected, that moment in the Astronomy Tower, but now I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure of anything.
“Well, Potter? Do you accept the challenge?” Draco smirked at him, arms crossed, daring him to back down with every line of his body.
‘Must be a Gryffindor trait, Thomas and Finnigan were fighting over the bed. Longbottom seems really quiet.’
‘Welcome!’ her thick Scottish accent not marred by anything. ‘Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts. Now let the feast begin.’
‘Morning.’ Harry called yawning, his voice still sluggish from the interrupted sleep, thanks very much to his friends.
The  boy  was so lost in thoughts that he neither heard the knocks on the door nor the creaking sound when opened nor the click-clack of hurried heels approaching.
‘Same here. Last night, they were fighting for a fucking bed near the window. And today, you know what they were fighting for? They fought for who is using the bathroom first!’
He jolted upright clutching the blanket to cover his torso. The witch rolled her eyes, she marched into the room and grabbed her boyfriend’s arm.
So Harry arrived at a conclusion, though he was uncertain if it was right. ‘Okay’, he said with a smile at which their face brightened and wasn’t that enough for him.
His mind was a mess by the time he left. He found out Potter was single these days, he found out Potter was bisexual, bisexual disaster to be specific. Which means Draco has a chance, maybe he could try. But the other half of him was like, what if Potter rejects him again? So he shouldn’t try on that. It’s just a crush he could get over with, not like he loved Potter with all his heart and soul. He needs answers. He needs Pansy.
Harry didn’t realise he was gaping like a fish until Ron clapped him in his shoulder, Hermione gave a smile which he returned. ‘Well come on, mate’, Ron said. Harry nodded.
If he was normal he wouldn’t hear Greyback’s howls, Aunt Bella’s cackles, Nagini’s hiss, the cruciated’s wails. There should be no nightmares of him crucioing and being crucioed, of the pleases, of all Dark spells. He still can’t be having nightmares of his Mother dying, his Father dying,— not that he liked him much, but still— him dying.
The rest of the trial passed as a blurry obscure course. He vaguely remembered speaking something about his wand and mark under veritaserum.
It was true, he knew it all along, but it hurt— not that he was not used to it, after seven years he was adapted to it. But since Potter spoke for him and the letter, he hoped, maybe they could become friends, but that was just his mind. Potter spoke only out of pity, which he resented.
‘Oh, right mate. Why to ruin your happiness.’ What Weasley did was something Draco didn’t expect to come. Weasley was making ungodly sinful moans.
He insisted on going to King’s Cross with Pansy and Blaise and asked her to stay home, which she reluctantly agreed.
He fought back a strong urge to hit himself because what was he thinking when he decided to return. When he kissed his Mother goodbye she had advised him to keep his head down, but chin up.
Draco was sitting by the window in his study with a potions book on lap, but wasn’t able to put eyes to read. Absent-mindedly he flipped and flipped the envelope in hand. Genuinely he wanted to go, but dreadfully he didn’t want to. Maybe he should just agree with his Mother. Or he could stay low, complete studies in Hogwarts and do whatever rubbish he wish.
He wanted to forget everything, like everything; and everytime he wished for it, it came flashing in front of his eyes; the night at Astronomy tower, nights spent in the Room of Requirement, the Vanishing Cabinet, the snakes roaring from fiendfyre, Crabbe’s de—.
We're sitting, simply drinking and thinking to sooth our anxious nerves for what feels like forever, when two men walk into the café; both have tall trench coats, both dark-haired and very pale. They could even be brothers. Neither of them seem to so much as take notice of us, huddled up in our booth, until they sit at a table not too far away.
Meeting Draco’s eyes, Potter licked his lips ever so slowly. His brilliant eyes dared Draco to continue, begged him to answer a new-found need. Draco consented silently with a wicked grin. Rather than kiss his lips, Draco lowered his face to Potter’s throat. Choosing a spot just under Potter’s left ear, Draco pressed an open-mouthed kiss to the sensitive skin.
Hermione leads us into a dingy little café. She's the first to sit down at a booth, Malfoy’s the last, and he has his nose perched so far in the air that I can hardly believe he can see where he's sitting.
“He isn't going to recognize you. My glampours don't falter, they should last you through the night.” she pushes me out of the way and climbs up the stairs, a thin book in her hand. Weasley follows, sneaking past in a less obtrusive way. Potter stops upon approaching me, examining the glamours closely.
“It'd be too risky to cast a spell either way!” Granger says firmly, pushing his wand aside. Potter’s eyes gleam, red light reflecting from the busy traffic.
I've never seen Malfoy look so pale; his skin is like crepe paper. He's so delicate, like a cracked piece of China, or a thin, chipped cup as he pretends he didn't just break down to pieces.
I frantically push my way through the ever-growing crowd. It seems like the whole school has gathered under the Astronomy tower. The eyes of solemn upperclassmen and confused first years dart past gaps in the crowd, all looking for the same thing; what they saw from through the grand, stone arch on the opposite end of the field or from the height of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tower. The pale, mangled body of their beloved headmaster.
It takes time to notice her ragged state, from her disheveled hair, which hangs loosely from her ruined updo and falls over her face, to the bags under her eyes accentuated by smeared mascara; she's exhausted, but determined.
There were a couple soft giggles in response, and many widened eyes, before as a group they turned back towards the intertwined young men.
Draco hadn’t intended to join his fellow eighth years for this month’s party at first, but had decided at the last minute to attend. He had been surprised to realize that he enjoyed these get-togethers, and he had noted a new level of closeness between the various Houses’ eighth years since they had started this tradition.
And, whenever I think that maybe, just maybe, if I did one thing differently in my life I would end up somewhere differently, I just can't seem to find an opportunity to change. What, should I have tried harder to become friends with Potter? I’d’ve ended up on the right side, but he sealed that fate, he denied me.
“Yes.” Potter walks forward, slowly, pointing his wand towards me. “You know I couldn't see the sky from inside that tent, Ferret, but I'm betting it's bright green right about now.”
Hermione lets out a startled shriek before she gets the chance to answer, and I spin around, wand out. Malfoy plasters himself against the wall, forehead gleaming with sweat, as a white mist enters the parlor like a gust of wind, landing in the center of the room in the form of a weasel. The animal's mouth falls open and the words slip through like silk, “
I hope you liked this next chapter, it's my first ever that's been beta-ed by @InkSilver here on AO3! *squeals with excitement* Please leave me a comment letting me know what you thought! I totally allow constructive criticism so please give some!! (Or suggestions, anything is cool as long as it's not mean)
As we fly towards the castle, the green beams nearly blinding in the dark night, I think of everyone back at the Hogwarts. Is this a result of us leaving the castle? Do the deatheaters know that we’ve found a horcrux? Are they torturing my friends at this very moment?
I don't want to feel any kind of pity for him, but I was there that night on the Astronomy tower. If anyone would know that Malfoy wasn't truly, honestly – well, let's just say I know the true story.
“Why won't she just tell us exactly what he said!” Hermione paces up and down the row of toilets, her tone outraged.
“Help? You wouldn't help me if the world was ending.” I grab the waitress by the shirt collar and lean her up against the counter.
With my blood boiling and palms itching to be around the foul bastard’s throat, I could hardly allow myself to watch him for the rest of the walk. I’d have strangled him. But, unfortunately, I know he’s not responsible. He knows it, too. Maybe he’d’ve even said that he wasn't and I wouldn't have believed him.
“Harry? Zip me up, will you? I can never reach the tiny sodding zippers on these stupid things. Makes me wonder why people wear them. Believe me when I say I'd never wear a dress voluntarily.”
“Anything we’ll need for what?” I grumble, expecting nothing out of it. The three of them share worried looks. Gryffindors.
I want to say something reassuring to Ron at that moment, but the angry woman comes out of the kitchen just then, momentarily interrupting the conversation with a tray of drinks, which she slams on our table before walking away.
He watched in amusement as his friend, Theodore Knott, set his drink aside and crawled across the circle a little unsteadily until he reached Neville Longbottom. Theo looked nervous, then seemed to steel himself. He lifted a hand and gently cupped Longbottom’s brightly blushing cheek, then kissed him on the lips. The kiss grew heated and Longbottom reached his hands to Theo’s hair, tangling his fingers and pulling Theo closer. Draco knew that Theo had developed a crush on Longbottom ages ago after they had nerded out over Herbology while in a study group together.
When my feet hit the ground I feel a strong urge to puke; I’ve always disliked the feeling of apparition, especially over long distances. Closing my eyes to fight the compulsion I can still see the Inferi creeping towards me and smell the salty sea air, but when I open them it’s just us, me and Dumbledore, under the starry sky.
My hands are numb by the time I finish the first page. We had a cat! And I had a broom! Dad, he would have loved to see me fly.
Malfoy snatches the wand with seeker speed and precision, nodding curtly and continuing up the stairs.
Draco cleared his throat self-consciously. “Right then,” Draco said, in his best impression of his normal voice. “Pansy, truth or dare?”
His childhood bed sits in the center of the room, headboard pressed to the west wall. I take a seat on its sloping side, just as I used to, and close my eyes. I breathe in deeply as if in doing so I can absorb all that I have left of him. As tears begin to prickle my eyes I stand abruptly, leaning onto the wall with one arm.
“What? Just because I'm no longer meant to know where this place is doesn't mean I never visited as a child. We are family after all.” The words feel odd coming out of my mouth and I rush to correct them.
,” she raise a hand to the sky, “Had appeared next to the moon. Then, everything went quiet. Everyone hid or disappeared.”
I really hope you guys enjoyed this chapter, and thanks again to my wonderful beta @InkSiver! If you did like this chapter please let me know with a kudos and comment, please tell me what you think! I'm always open to constructive criticism (just try to be kind).
“It doesn't matter what we deserve,” she says, eyes downcast. “For all we know we’re the only ones still
“What are you going on about?” Weasley voice grates against my eardrums as I turn to face the door looming at the end of the wall. I walk with my arm and fingers outstretched until they graze the nameplate.
Before Draco could react, Potter pushed up against Draco, rolling them over so that Potter lay on Draco’s stunned body. He kissed Draco quickly and deeply, ending it with a nip of his bottom lip. Then he pushed off Draco and took his seat in the circle once more as though nothing unusual had happened.
“So you do.” Dumbledore raises his palms as if to demonstrate his willfullness. The wind blows starkly between them and the wood creaks under the combined weight.
The girl shoves her wand into a small purple sack and whips her head around. “You don't get to ask questions,
“Fuck.” Is the last thing I say before a curse lands at our table, exploding the cups of hot coffee as well as the table itself. Hermione screams shrilly as the liquid scalds her face and Ron pulls her out of the way; Malfoy moves on his own accord.
I finally heave myself up and lean against the doorframe. My internal conscious argues for telling Ron and Hermione, but I can't bring myself to even imagine relaying the tale after such a night. Hermione doesn't need anyone or anything else to agonize over, and I definitely don't want to be the one to add to her worries.
“Grimmauld Place,” he states, voice trembling. I can’t tell if it's out of anger or fear. “You mean to tell me that all this time Black used a Fidelius charm to hide Grimmauld place and use it for… I–”
“A vanishing cabinet, in the Room Of Requirement. It has a sister, in Borgin and Burkes. I’ve been… mending it.”
“But you can, Draco. The order will protect you, and your family if need necessary. Please, just let us help.”
“Oh of course I knew, Draco. Though, I must admit, most of your attempts to kill me did seem very foolhardy.” Dumbledore states this as a fact, plain as day.
Granger clears her throat and reads: “To the Dark Lord - I know I will be dead long before you read this, but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. - R.A.B.”
Theo shrugged, aware of several pairs of eyes switching from the enticing display of intimacy before them all to him with interest, “I…might have had an inkling. Perhaps.” Theo shrugged and smiled mischievously at the group.
Draco drew back from the kiss. He looked down into Potter’s triumphant eyes and noted how the green had darkened with lust. Potter’s dark cheeks were rosy, his lips were slightly swollen, his skin glistened with sweat. He was breathtakingly beautiful, and in that moment, Draco wanted this to never end, wished he could freeze time to live in this moment for all time.
“Harry what are you talking about? You can't defeat Voldemort. Getting rid of Umbridge was one thing, taking on the darkest wizard of our age is something completely different.”
The boy is still clothed in the oversized jacket and pants given to him at Privet drive, his sleeves pushed up the the elbows and the circular glasses long abandoned. He wears a tired but biting expression perceptible in his sharp countenance. His thin, dry lips pull into a grimace.
As my luck would have it, Potter turns and stares suspiciously at me and grabs my arm, only to see that I have nothing hidden in my sleeves. He looks confused more than anything.
Malfoy steps up with shaky legs, and I follow him, more confidently, I hope. The moment our feet step safely onto the thin carpet, the door slams shut of its own accord, and I feel myself propelled into Malfoy’s back. The entrance room looks just the same as it always did; the flickering, mellow light of the gas lamps reveal the thick dust and cobwebs that have been known to paint the walls. Even the nasty umbrella stand is in the same place.
Before Draco could shift to move towards him, Potter jeered, “It’s your dare, Malfoy. Are you coming over here or not?”
Malfoy’s grey eyes then grow wider under the moonlight. Hermione and Ron step onto the stoop, raising their wands to the door. “Welcome to Grimmauld place, your ancestral home.”
Twisting the purple sack across her bust, Granger points her wand at my head. My heart beats for a moment before I realize she's only removing the glamours from both Potter and me. My skin feels completely free of any kind of magic or charm. Realizing what this means, I hastily tug the sleeves of my robe down, concentrating for a brief moment, hoping that none of them notices.
“Don't grovel, Lucius,” I hiss. “It’s unbecoming of you.” I crouch down and grab the bloodied man by his throat. “Besides, it won't make any difference. You and your offspring have already failed me, so you should find yourself lucky your lodgings are so… useful.”
The Astronomy Tower door opens a last time and, in a billow of dark green robes, Snape climbs the stairs.
“Only, there are more. And he hadn't discovered how to destroy them yet.” I pull the locket I took off of Dumbledore’s body from my pocket, thumbing the charm.
He leaned forward and gripped the front of Potter’s robes, pulling him into a kiss. Potter was evidently surprised at Draco’s daring. His lips parted slightly and Draco deepened the kiss. He slid his tongue along Potter’s, savoring the taste, the feel. He raised a hand to cup the side of Potter’s head, sliding his fingers among the messy curls and tugging firmly on a handful.
My hand flies to my- no not mine- a Weasley’s red hair this time. “Oh, yes. Distant cousin. Go by the name of Timothy.” I descend the stairs as slowly and calmly as I can with my heart beating out of my chest. Instinctively I reach out an arm to shake, ramrod straight, and grasp the Minister’s hand.
, this whole thing, it's bigger than than him. It's bigger that Malfoy. Bigger than Snape, bigger than Lestrange. Bigger than them; pawns the lot of them.
“I told you he wouldn’t do it!” One of the miscellaneous deatheaters shouts, “The Dark Lord shouldn’t have entrusted him or any of the Malfoys! They’re all cowards!”
to the place where… where Sirius.…” I wipe stupid burning tears from my eyes and turn my head; already I feel the absence of his presence, of his guidance. Luckily Hermione knows what I'm talking about; her eyes fall onto Malfoy as he surveys the dirty cafe with raised nose and eyebrow.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Potter demanded, doing his best imitation of Dudley’s stubborn self-confidence. “Spit it out, or I’m leaving.”
Anyway, please leave a comment letting me know (I loveeee constructive criticism) and kudos if you liked this! Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
, as if the word itself was as dirty as the people. He sneers and rubs his hands up and down his arms, which are prickled with goose skin. “
“If you don’t mind, we’d like to get back to the game, you two. It’s your turn, Draco,” Theo said in an arch, but amused voice.
in my life have I ever wished to feel what Voldemort feels so acutely; I desire to scrape away the soft tissue from my bones to rid myself of the physical memory. This feeling is something I’d kill to rid myself of: such a thirst for death.
When I awake it is to a blurry, barely lit room and the feeling of warmth and security as I snuggle further into the bed. Then, the fog clears. I'm not at the Burrow. I jump out of the bed as if its burned me, my heart thumping erratically in my chest. I've woken up into something more terrifying than my nightmares: my reality.
It's terrifying to feel such true rage course through my veins, rage so strong I truly do want him dead. But, even more terrifying is the person who drops to my feet next.
My anger quickly gives way to desperation. I hastily take another step back, looking over my shoulder calling out to Hermione, but when I turn around, Remus is standing over me, his eyes wide and his jaw on the ground.
“I was looking through Sirius' things and I was thinking about Dumbledore and- the locket,” Potter’s voice is shaky. “It's a fake, look!”
“Wait,” I shout. I dig into my pocket and pull out the hawthorn wand, tossing it over. “Hermione’ll need it to make the- uh-  charms work correctly. For your glamours. Just, don't get any funny ideas.”
I pull the Invisibility cloak over by body and mount the broom. Looking to my side, I half-expect Dumbledore to be falling over again, but he’s steady, eyes determined.
Ron picks thoughtlessly at the peeling wallpaper. “It's bloody worse than I remember,” Ron says, disagreeing with my unspoken thoughts, and steps closer to the old troll foot. “I wish Tonks were here.” He lightly kicks the troll foot with the tip of his shoe as if in tribute.
Draco sucked at the spot for a long moment, then bit down without warning, sucking at the skin between his teeth. Potter bit his lip, closing his eyes, unable to mask an uneven moan in response or to stop his hips from pressing upwards insistently against Draco. Draco groaned, every exhalation, every sound struck him with an almost physical blow, blazing through him, making his cock twitch in excitement.
I push all previous thoughts from my mind and walk forward on the staircase. The eyes of the shrunken elf heads follow my movement and I think of Dobby. “The first floor should be fine. There's a bedroom and the parlor for us to use.”
“Please,” Potter whimpered, his voice breathy. “Please, Malfo-y.” He pulled limply at Draco’s chin, tugging him back to his mouth.
“It’s Harry,” Potter said with a grin. He held out his hand, “Harry Potter. I’m new to this world, and I could use all the friends I can get.”
I shouldn’t have told Ron and Hermione and Ginny about this, I shouldn’t have given them any information. This should be my burden to carry and mine alone. I don’t want them to get hurt. Any of them.
They lost themselves in the kiss, their hips moving rhythmically against each other, breath hot, lips soft, and tongues insistent.
I throw several stunners, and though the sight of Hermione’s terrified face turns my arm to jelly, I manage to land an Expelliarmus and catch the wizard’s wand with my left hand. But the other wizard whom I presumed to be stunned grabs that arm, and attempts to wrestle it away as the wandless wizard continues to charge.
