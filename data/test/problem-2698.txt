. Such blatant want that Draco feels drunk on it. It’s just like the last time, but better, because Draco isn’t mentally calculating an expiration date this time around.
“Draco,” Harry says, his voice coming out rough and confused. “I’m not enough for you.”
“I am
“You feel like home,” Draco says quietly, and Harry drops his head onto Draco’s shoulder, breathless.
, Harry, please–”
“Ughhh, I can’t.” Draco flops down further on his side of the couch, stretching out his legs until his toes press into Harry’s thigh. Pepper, curled up on Harry’s lap, chirps indignantly. “I have to go to lunch with this Ministry official to get an interview.”
“Don’t,” Harry says immediately, panic flashing behind his eyes. “No, don’t.”
“Alright,” I reply, unsure how to explain that this works perfectly because I need to sleep further away from the door or else I feel too exposed. Growing up with the threat of assassination can do that to you. Not that I was constantly under threat, just… the dangers of being royalty. Or at least a
friends. It’s just that they’re also not quite close enough to truly deserve the label, either. They straddle the awkward line of acquaintanceship, since Draco has been working with Hermione Granger for years now and certainly considers her a friend. Harry, it seems, is a package deal, and Draco has exchanged vaguely uncomfortable small talk with the man at gatherings and pub nights more times than he can count. He’s just always

minutes ago he was willingly pushed up against the back wall by thick, calloused hands and bright green eyes he hadn’t seen in years. It’s probably a bad idea, but Draco hasn’t had anyone
“Huh,” Harry says. “Do you feel anything?” Draco shakes his head, but even as he does something decidedly
. This would be one time and for good reason.”
“I thought you would be upset.” Draco’s voice is so small, the way it gets when he’s terrified. “I thought– I thought– I just want to be so good to you, Harry, and I–” He breaks off with a small sob and Harry rocks them gently side to side, rubbing his hand in circles over Draco’s back.
“I wanted to,” Harry says, and it’s so earnest that Draco sinks down to his soft new rug and promptly bursts into tears. Harry is there in a heartbeat, arms tight around Draco as he sobs. He murmurs unintelligible words into Draco’s hair, rocking them both slowly until Draco’s calm enough to speak, his voice rough.
“Firstly!” Pansy replies, her smile wide and sharp. “Don’t shame people’s kinks. And we won’t actually know. We’ll just know who
“Uh-huh.”
“I’ve been asking for months. He keeps showing up with such strangely healed injuries, but–” She waves her hand, checking her bright blue Muggle wristwatch. “Sorry, god, I have to run. I’m worried about him, Draco. I’ll try talking to him again, but it sounds like it’s getting worse if he’s asking for help.”
“But you’re upset.”
“ Harry cries out as he goes boneless, his thighs shuddering around Draco’s ears, nearly tight enough to be uncomfortable. Draco works him through it until Harry pushes off with a groan, collapsing down next to Draco.
“There. That should be better.”
“You keep asking me that like I’m going to suddenly come up with an answer,” Draco replies with no bite. His eyes are bright today; he’s been looking better recently, able to walk further from Harry without getting shaky. Harry is trying not to think about what this means, because if the bond is weakening then his feelings should be too. Maybe it has to do with the magical imbalance– maybe the bond is releasing Draco faster, while Harry remains tied to him. “I don’t know. Magic is weird.”
He recalls Harry’s disappointment, the way his tentative smile fell, the small nod of understanding, like Harry had expected this but was hoping for something different.
“Now why were you talking about gravity?” Draco asks.
“No, no, get off me,” Draco says, strained and panicked, managing to flip himself over underneath Harry even as he leans forward and struggles to hold him down. “I don’t want this,” Draco pants, his bright eyes finding Harry’s, his pupils dilated.
“We’re not bigger than ourselves.” Harry presses his amused grin to Draco’s hair. “We’re just two people in love.”
“Your choice.”
Harry shushes him softly and tightens his grip on Draco’s hips. “Hey, no, I’ve got you now.”
“I– Harry, that’s– I know it’s late, but would you like to watch something?” Draco asks. He squeezes Harry’s fingers, looking very shy all of a sudden. “I don’t want to go home quite yet.”
Draco murmurs something unintelligible in response, and soon Harry has them both clean and in pajamas, tucked under the covers. Draco isn’t shivering anymore, but he still burrows into Harry’s arms as though he belongs there. And he does, Harry thinks as he tumbles into the velvet of sleep. Draco does belong here, in Harry’s arms. Safe.
if you’re trying to keep yourself safe, because you’re doing a fucking terrible job of it, and every single day I’m afraid you’re going to come through my door and bleed to death or freeze to death or fucking–
“What?”
“Well there was a good chance it would get to you. Seeing as you live here.”
, Draco, right there, love when you fuck me I love your mouth jesus I love you oh oh Draco suck me off I need your mouth
I place my tongue flat on the head of his cock, and lick.
“Cheaper rent,” Harry replies, wiggling his way across the sofa nearly into Draco’s lap. “Companionship. My good eggs. The way I make hot chocolate. The fact that I know how to do laundry. The way I rub your feet when you’re tired–”
“You can,” Harry says, almost sweetly, and Draco distantly registers the heat building in his thighs, much faster than usual. He presses a panicked kiss to the corner of Harry’s mouth, suddenly desperate for this to last longer, to be allowed to remain in the safety of Harry’s arms. Harry nuzzles his cheek, misinterpreting Draco’s whimper. “I’m here, come on. Let me take care of you. I– ah, fuck,” Harry gasps, and then he squeezes his eyes shut hard and Draco realizes he’s tipped over the edge of orgasm, seemingly by surprise, and the nearly painful bliss in the slack
“Well.” Draco’s throat is painfully dry. “I mean. If– if I have time, I suppose.” He’s fooling no one– Harry’s eyes had pierced straight through him earlier, right into his lonely heart. But Harry’s being casual, so Draco can be casual.
“Sorry,” Draco says softly, her leg knocking against Harry’s shin. Her nightgown is rucked up a bit, her skin bare and cool. Harry is suddenly aware of the thick hair on her own legs, the way she carries her weight on her hips and her chest, so unlike the lean, smooth lines of Draco. Draco, who looks like the moon. “Sorry, I know we’re not– I know we don’t go to each other’s rooms, I just didn’t know what else to do. I’m sorry.”
“Because it doesn’t matter where I go,” Harry interrupts with a small laugh. “It matters that I’m with you. And you want to see the trees in Washington.”

“My hands?” Draco whispers.
“Hello,” Harry says softly, and Draco doesn’t turn immediately, giving himself a moment of respite. He already knows what Harry will look like, anyways– standing in the doorway, his cheeks slightly flushed but his expression determined.
Something flashes across Harry’s features, too quick to catch. “Yeah.”
“But you’ve never wanted more, so I just…” Draco shrugs. “I want to be wanted. It’s probably not healthy, but it’s true.”

,” Draco parrots, but he lets Harry heal each of his bruises, one by one, watching Harry with bright eyes the entire time, his expression cautious but undercut by something that looks a little bit like hope.
The last thing Harry remembers is Draco’s hushed laughter, warm fingers rubbing gentle circles against her skin, and the unbearably tender feeling of happiness.
“I like you,” Draco blurts out, and Harry takes a shocked step backwards.
“Please,” Harry repeats, moving his other hand to Draco’s thigh, digging his tensed fingers in as Draco moves again. “Please, Draco, please baby, I want– I want– god, please.”
“Yes, because you deserve it.”

“Yes. You see, I’m too busy keeping their boy wonder warm.”

Harry’s eyes are calculating and bright. “You like praise?”

Five streets from the Apparition point to the small law office where you run mail and offer water to waiting clients and everyone calls you Dan. Today is no different. Smile. Nod. Take the post from the courier. Make sure no one sees your wand.
When Harry raises his head, he sees tear tracks down Draco’s cheeks, still glittering. Draco is slumped against Harry and the dresser, his breath coming in little pants through his nose. There are angry red marks dug into his cheek when Harry pulls his hand away, perfectly finger-shaped imprints of what Harry has done. Blood wells to the surface of his shoulder, a small red pearl.
“I know, I know.” Harry’s breath is hot across the side of Draco’s cheek. “Let me know when–”
“Answer the comm,” I tell Hedwig, my voice rough. One of my hands flies across the console, checking our fuel levels and steering us towards the Swan’s coordinates; the other hand grabs blindly for my thigh holster. If this bloke tries to hurt me, I’m throwing him right out into space, units be damned.
Also, the further he gets from panic, the mouthier he gets.
“Wh– what? When?”

“I take you out for coffee.”
Harry presses another kiss to Draco’s head, but they’re already pliant with sleep, so Harry mumbles soothing nonsense into Draco’s hair, hoping that they can feel his love even in their dreams.
“This is your home too,” Harry continues, clenching his hands for a moment before relaxing. “This is your
“Harry,” Draco says sharply, hysteria starting to creep up his throat. “Answer me.”
“A while,” Draco says roughly. “Don’t ask me– just–”
“Let me– let me kiss you,” Harry says quietly, his eyes darting across Draco’s face. “Fuck, I thought you wouldn’t ever feel the same, I– Draco please–”
Draco blinks, and flushes deeper. He loves to feel
“She just said ‘you’re right, I’ll get Atkins on it.’ Then she waved me out of her office! Just like that!”
On Draco’s next day off, he casts the tracking charm and something impulsive clenches in his chest.
“Yeah,” Draco whispers, and the rest of his words are lost to the night air.
“You guess not,” Draco repeats faintly.
“Use your words. It’s okay to ask for things, pet.”
“I can always redo it,” Draco says, smiling faintly. Harry’s chest floods with warmth; Draco’s smiles are few and far between.
he had said.
“Huh?”
Over the course of Harry’s outburst, Draco’s gone from annoyed to incredulous; he stares across the desk with wide eyes. “You care about me?”
“God,” Draco gasps, losing himself momentarily as he shudders in pleasure. “God, no, I’m not– I don’t
“What– what–
The Draco that isn’t you smiles, a gash of teeth. How did they get your face so accurate? Deep under-eye circles and the small mole beside your left eye. Even you had forgotten this detail. Avoiding mirrors while out of glamour is muscle memory now.
“Mhmm. If being used by you is what got your hands on me.” Draco shrugs, then starts to rub his hands in small circles on Harry’s back. “I know it’s rather… unhealthy.”
“I know that
“I was good?” he asks, his voice small, and Harry nods before pressing soft kisses all over Draco’s cheeks.

Draco inhales deeply, trying to swallow down the sob that threatens to crawl up his throat, willing his body to ease down from the disappointment of
“Boyfriends, then?” Draco asks, trying not to sound giddy and utterly failing. Harry grins, a bright flash of happiness.
“So…” Harry whispers, and then Draco is
“Dance with me,” Harry says again, even though they’re already dancing in their pajamas with their hands clasped together tightly. Draco blows a wisp of hair off his face before pressing a kiss to Harry’s temple.

“Always. Always, with you,” Draco replies, and spins Harry again until he’s dizzy with happiness, cradled in the home they’ve made together.
“Sorry,” I croak when the tears subside, unwilling to look over at Harry. I feel him shrug.
“I am not a kid!” I yell, throwing my hands up and nearly clocking Harry in the nose. “I’m pretty sure we’re the same age!”
“You should clean yourself up,” Harry says scratchily as Draco runs confident hands down Harry’s arms. “Or you’re just gonna stay sticky.”
Draco takes Harry’s offered hand, and the warmth on his arm falls away. “Yes.”
“Every day?” Hermione asks, her voice strained.

, the very prim way Draco asks Harry to fuck him. Harry doesn’t reply, staring straight ahead until Draco sighs. “You’re fucked up too, you know,” he says. His voice is flat, a surprising lack of venom behind the words, and for the first time Harry wonders if Draco is also exhausted by this. “I know why you never let me stay the night. Try convincing me to give you more of myself when you’re ready to let me in, too.”
I’m doing this, then. If he wants it. If he wants
“Reach for me,” Harry says softly. Draco does, immediately, holding himself up on one elbow to grab Harry’s hair in his other hand and kiss him hard, messy. Harry stretches his body out on top of Draco’s, kissing him down into the mattress and grabbing Draco’s wrists in his hands. “Do you want handcuffs?” he asks, kissing down the side of Draco’s throat.
“Go to sleep. You’ll forget about it.” Draco waves a vague hand. Harry slides out of him, stepping back in horror, and Draco immediately crumples to the ground, his hands splayed out on the rug. “Merlin. Okay. Fuck.”
“Hey,” Harry says one of these nights, turning on the couch to face Draco. “Are you going to Gay Brunch on Saturday? Pansy basically told me on threat of death to pull you away from work for it since you missed last month.”
say it now.”
“It’s not me,” I retort, shoving past him back into the living quarters. “Take it up with the ISRC.” Draco glares at me until I crack a grin. “Intergalactic Spaceship Regulation Committee.”
Harry looks at Draco, assessing. He’s learned the tells of Draco’s fatigue, the way his hands shake and his eyes droop, but he looks lively in the morning sun. Harry shrugs and tosses him the car keys, going around to the passenger side. “Just let me know if you get too tired. I think we’re going to really get into the mountains soon.”
“You want me. You want me to be yours.” Draco rolls his hips again, laughing breathlessly as Harry slides his hips forward slightly. “Oh god, you want me, you–
“Pull up that blanket,” Draco says with a lazy snap of his fingers. Harry snorts but complies, tucking the covers around them and turning off the bedside lamp before rearranging Draco in his arms until they’re both comfortable.
it, treasures the wet sound of his finger sliding deep into Draco and back out again, all of Draco’s desire wrapped around him. As Draco hitches his hips up, seeking more, Harry pushes a second finger in. He fucks Draco slowly, almost absentminded, as Draco keens into the sheets.
“Fuck off,” Harry mumbles, already feeling prickly as he rolls over to face the wall. There’s a huff and a clatter behind him, so he drags the covers up over his ears to muffle the sounds of Draco taking his frustration out on the furniture.
“I didn’t run away.”
“You would.”
, then immediately scratches it out.
“In bed,” Harry retorts bitterly.
“Also your thighs haunt me,” Draco says, and Harry snorts in surprise.
“Yeah,” Draco says. His voice cracks slightly, and Harry settles back in his seat, warmth flooding through him as things start to fall into place.
“I just…” Harry trails off, curling into himself, so Draco pulls Harry close to his chest and murmurs nonsense into dark curls until he feels Harry’s breathing slow.
“I didn’t say that.”
The burns have turned a shiny pink, as though they’re a week old– the salve doesn’t heal completely, just speeds up the process. Draco traces a thumb down one swirling line for a moment before suddenly remembering his anger.
“I didn’t stop,” Harry murmurs, and Draco doesn’t understand, his entire mind consumed by desperate heat.
“I’m going to have to get a new tattoo,” Draco says, and Harry stares at him dumbfounded until Draco presents his upturned left arm, the skin smooth and clear. Dropping into a chair next to the bed Harry traces his hands over Draco’s skin, laughing incredulously.
“Would you like to end up in Washington?” Harry asks. He had originally planned to end the trip in California but willingly abandoned his plans in Atlanta; wherever Draco wants to go, they go.
Next he unclips his sock garters, running his hand all the way down his leg– he knows the garters drive Harry mad in a way that's inexplicably delightful. When his socks are off and folded neatly, he stands in front of Harry, hands clasped behind his back, naked except for his wedding band. His cock bobs at eye-level to Harry, weeping at the tip and so hard it’s nearly painful. Harry looks up at him, and even though Draco is looming above him where he sits on the sofa, there is a power radiating off Harry that screams
“Fancy–
“What do you have nightmares about?” Harry blurts, because she’s a professional at shoving her foot in her mouth. Malfoy’s face shutters, her lips pressing thin. “No, no, pretend I didn’t say that.”

“We’re attempting the curse-breaking tomorrow. Full moon, like Hermione said. Doesn’t give you much time, Potter.”
, and Harry knows this.
Harry blinks, glancing over at Draco. For a moment his expression goes soft, then he turns back to the Ravenclaw. “If I see you again I’ll hex you.”
, I’ll keep fighting you–”
“My actual body, cock. The strap-on, dick.” Harry tightens the strap around his thighs, and Draco wants to touch him so badly he could scream– Harry’s thighs are strong, his muscles rippling as he climbs back onto the bed and settles between Draco’s legs. He gazes intently at Draco as his palm becomes slick without a word and he begins to slowly stroke his dick.
“Intersecting lines, then,” Draco murmurs, tucking himself against Harry’s side, and Harry laughs.
“You’re so beautiful,” Harry murmurs, bending down to kiss the inside of Draco’s thigh. “Draco. Let me tell you how beautiful you are.”
Harry is everything and everything is Harry, and Draco’s orgasm is right there, if he could just– touch–
fall from his own lips as he tips over the edge of orgasm. He tightens his grip on the head of Draco’s cock as he shudders, curling up into himself as Draco rides him nearly to overstimulation. When Draco comes, it’s just as beautiful as always– their pink lips drop open and they keep their eyes on Harry, even as their gaze goes far away and glassy. Their thighs shake as they tumble forward onto Harry’s chest and Harry wraps his arms around them, immediately fumbling for the buckle of the cuffs, dropping them off the side of the bed before rubbing his thumbs over the delicate bumps of Draco’s wrists. The soft material of Draco’s nightie sticks to Harry’s chest where their bodies are pressed together, and Harry gently guides Draco’s hands up to his shoulders. Draco grumbles softly, pressing their face into Harry’s neck.
I don’t know what I expected but that actually makes… a lot of sense. As disturbing as it is. I tighten my fingers around Harry’s shirt. “Can you turn the grav back on, then? If you want–”
“Any preferences?”
After some shimmying and grumbling from Draco, his pyjama bottoms and pants are on the floor and he’s sitting close to the edge of the couch. Harry looks up through his lashes, taking in the flush of Draco’s cheeks, his ruffled hair, the flash of pale collarbone where the red jumper slides down. Harry leans his cheek against Draco’s thigh and inhales the sweet vanilla scent of his body wash and something deeper, muskier. Draco’s cock, soft and pink, lays in front of Harry’s lips, but Harry looks up one more time.
Harry hums softly, unsure, so Draco drops it for now and rubs his hand in circles over Harry’s back until he falls asleep, snoring softly against Draco’s collarbone.
“It doesn’t feel like anything I’ve ever felt before,” he whispers, fear written across his features. “I don’t know if I can–”
The rest of his words are lost against Harry’s lips.
“Hey, watch the water,” he exclaims, holding the cup away from his body, but he’s laughing. “Here you go, baby.”
“What do you think?” Draco snaps, his voice muffled where his face is pressed into the sheets. “It’s–
“Ow– ow, that hurts,” Draco cries out as Harry yanks his head back with the fingers curled in his hair. “Stop, I don’t want this, I’ll
“Let me kiss you,” Harry says, a question in his voice, and Draco nods frantically, stopping only when Harry’s lips meet his. Draco tastes like sleep and cinnamon, and he whimpers softly as Harry kisses him deeper, pushing him back against the counter before wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. Draco fists Harry’s shirt, insistently pulling him closer, kissing Harry back soft and slow. When they break apart Draco is panting and Harry is dizzy with happiness, unable to stop his smile.

“Okay, I’m pulling up alongside you now. Grab anything that you don’t want to be blasted to hell when those engines fully give. I’m turning off the video comm but I’ll keep audio on. Do you know how to initiate docking procedures?”
“Draco,” Harry says, fondly exasperated. “You’ve got legs like a steel trap.”
“I– don’t ask me that.”
“You don’t get to kiss me.”
“Do I want to know why you have a shrunken headboard with you?” she asks as soon as he tumbles out of her Floo, and Harry grins sheepishly.
“Don’t be mean to me, I’m dying.”

Draco shifts on the sofa, pulling his knees up to his chest but leaving his hand in Harry’s. His gaze meets Harry’s, strangely unreadable– Draco usually wears his heart on his sleeve, at least when it’s just them.
“Green,” Draco says after a beat, and Harry gets the other cuff around Draco’s wrist before he can even blink. He shoves Draco onto the bed, flipping him roughly onto his stomach and straddling his hips, keeping Draco down with his own body weight. Even as Draco fights, somehow landing a bruising kick to Harry’s thigh, Harry manages to get the chain threaded between the wrist cuffs, pulling it taut until Draco’s hands are bound together at the small of his back. “Harry,” Draco says into the pillow, and Harry goes soft for him for a moment.
“Sit,” he says, turning his face up to mine, and I drop to the bed immediately. At his gentle insistence I move backwards and rotate until my head is on his pillow, the sheets at my back. He straddles my hips and I try to remember how to breathe, because
Harry is increasingly sure that this night will end with him punching Joshua.
He starts with furniture. The rest of the flat had been furnished mostly through trips into Muggle London, searching through antique stores and charity shops, so Harry keeps the same method this time. He spends hours winding through shops after leaving the animal shelter each day. He finds a beautiful matching headboard and dresser set, and an antique roll-top desk; Draco seems to really like his deep blue bookcase, so Harry doesn’t try to replace that piece. It’s a tricky thing to figure out where to store the furniture until he can completely redo Draco’s room all at once, since he doesn’t want Draco to have a chance to refuse, so eventually he caves and goes to Hermione.
“I know. I know it’s– I know we still don’t know each other as well as we could, and maybe I’m wanting too much too fast, even though you kissed me back, and I don’t mind waiting for– for anything, but you

long and dangerous.”
“Harry has an… unquantifiable amount of magic. Wild, deep magic. It gave him a lot of trouble right after the war, after killing– well, anyway, he went to a lot of magic specialists to deal with it and they hypothesized he’s using about ten percent of his magic when casting verbally with a wand.” Inhaling sharply, Draco turns to Harry as Hermione continues talking. “However, that continuous control helps him keep all that magic in check and avoid potentially dangerous accidental magic. But when he uses the extent of his power, it’s…” Hermione trails off and Harry casts his eyes down — shame burning in his cheeks — recalling the sound of every single one of Grimmauld Place’s windows shattering after an article about him and Ginny in the Prophet painted their amicable split as entirely her fault.
“Are you sure you like–”
“Are you feeling alright? Do you need me to keep touching you for a while?”

“Okay.” Harry’s voice is sudden steel and Draco freezes. “So you’re gonna be a brat.”
“What?” Draco asks, because Harry is looking at him expectantly and Draco has forgotten the question.
, eliciting a skeptical look and a small smirk. Without Ron here, Hermione’s carrying the brunt of Harry’s never-ending need to talk about Draco, yet she’s been surprisingly good-natured about it. Especially after Draco apologized to her, though Hermione refuses to tell Harry exactly what Draco said.
, he had said in a voice like prayer.
It takes a moment for Draco’s blissed out mind to understand what Harry’s asking, and he nuzzles into Harry’s neck as his cheeks heat up. “Ride my face,” he says into the warmth of Harry’s skin. “I want– you. I want you.”
“I–I can’t do that,” Harry stammers, heat rising to his cheeks at the tangle of anxiety and uncertainty and

“Okay.” Draco hiccups, and Harry brushes away another tear. “Don’t look at me.”

“No!” Harry’s palms hit the table, jostling the takeout containers and a jar of biros. Huffing, Draco crosses his arms and leans back in his chair. “You don’t– you don’t want to hang out with people in case they start caring about you? Well too bad, I already do. I’m here whether you like it or not.
“Hey,” Harry says, throwing his calf over Draco’s knee. Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s collarbone, and he feels very small, surrounded like this. “I can be more upfront, if you’d like. I want to take you for coffee in the morning, and hear about your interests, and your life. I want to hold your hand in the park and glare at anyone who looks at you wrong and kiss you on the top of the head while we’re waiting in line at the shops. But I’m too intense, too fast sometimes, so…” Harry sounds so tentative– Draco blinks back tears and tries to breathe.
“Yes?” Draco says, barely above a whisper, and Harry realizes he’s been staring at Draco’s pink lips. He flicks his gaze up to Draco’s eyes, finding panic there.
“You’re fucking fantastic, I knew you’d get it,” Draco says, his words muffled into Harry’s neck. Harry wraps his arms around Draco, holding him back tightly, and Draco blames what he says next on the warmth of Harry’s breath against his shoulder. “Untruth. No one loves you.”
He moves down to Draco’s balls, painfully slowly, and licks the entire flat of his tongue along them. Draco is panting and the bed creaks as he pulls at his restraints, every sensation heightened by the fact that he can’t see. Harry shifts on the bed again and his mouth is gone, replaced by light fingertips. He traces a path all the way down to tap a fingernail at the base of the plug with a metallic

“Yes.”
Two minutes in the morning to apply glamours. A long, patrician nose turned pert, grey eyes transformed to flat browngreen, marble skin dusted with freckles. Brassy hair, cropped close to your head, not a glamour– Muggle dye.
“Harry, you’re so– your fucking
Draco pushes at Harry’s shoulder in mock offense, snickering. “As
“You’re lucky you can get hard again so quickly.” Harry snorts. “Imagine if I could come like three times but you couldn’t. You’d feel so left out.”
“I’ll pick you up.”
The moon is shining full through the crack Draco had accidentally left in the curtains, and Draco stares into the silver light, trying to formulate a response that isn’t false, but doesn’t give away his whole truth. Because the truth is no, he’s not alright, he hasn’t been alright since he woke up in St. Mungo’s with Harry’s palm pressed to his. If Draco’s harshly honest with himself, the way he rarely is, he hasn’t been alright since the moment over a year ago when Harry threw his hands up in tired exasperation and said
His eyes glint with amusement. “You said it, not me.”
That seems to snap Draco out of his daze. “Why didn’t you say so? We can–”
“What is it?” Draco turns his face down into the pillow, pressing closer to Harry’s hand. Balancing the notebook on his thigh, Harry hastily scrawls something along the bottom of the page before turning it towards Draco. His mouth presses into a tight line, as though bracing for something.
to heal you. Please. I’m– I shouldn’t have. I shouldn’t have done this. I’m– I’m–”
“Baby,” Harry says tenderly, reaching a hand down between their bodies to wrap around Draco’s cock, and the sudden pressure is just enough. Draco shouts as his orgasm hits him, heat flooding all the way down to his toes as he shakes through it. Harry keeps thrusting, increasingly frantic until he shudders too, dropping the full weight of his body onto Draco, apparently uncaring of the come that's now growing tacky between their stomachs. After a few moments Draco shifts, wincing at the length of Harry’s dick still inside him.
I look around the living quarters, and put away a scattered game of chess that we’d gotten halfway through last night before Draco decided he was going to start adding ridiculous rules on a whim and I broke every one of them until he was laughing so hard he accidentally knocked over all the pieces. I turn to him, satisfied that nothing else is loose, since I keep everything in my storage rooms strapped down for safety. His eyes have fallen closed but the lines of his body are taut, it’s usual state when he’s awake.
“I’ve enjoyed this.”
like that, perhaps, but yes.”
“Hm. About what?”

“Fuck.
lost in their shared breath.
“Mhmm.” Harry’s lips brush Draco’s earlobe, then his neck, and he shivers. “That’s why you try to launch yourself out of bed every time my hand brushes your side.”
we’re into bondage.”
“Do you have standard docking equipment?”
“You don’t have to get up at the same time I do, you know,” Draco calls, already heading into the hallway to go to his room. “I’d be fine just grabbing coffee on the way to work.”
“And also… not-friends visit each other?”
“Right,” Draco says faintly. “Let me grab a notebook and we can make that list, I suppose.”
Harry’s hands are so gentle on his hips.
“Yes.” Draco swallows. “Yes, Harry.”
“Yeah?”
“Come on, Draco,” Harry says lightly, but his face is flushed and he looks… shy. “Bedroom, then?”
“There’s a one million unit reward on your head,” I say, and his body goes entirely still. “If you’re returned to Scorpius alive and unharmed.”
“So help me, I do,” Harry replies, still chuckling. Where his body meets mine I can feel slickness, so I wiggle underneath him until I feel his cock slide across my skin and he gasps.
“Good morning,” Harry says, his voice honey-warm in the morning light, and Draco can’t breathe. Harry’s curls are mussed, his green eyes bright. How Harry wakes up so quickly each morning is a mystery to Draco, when he’s still rubbing sleep from his eyes halfway through breakfast.
pissed off. Just, later, yes? I’m pretty sure I bruised a rib.”
“Thank you,” he says politely, wiping his chin with the back of his hand, and I can't help it– I roll over until I’m half on top of his chest, kissing him like my life depends on it. From the back of his throat comes a surprised noise, but he melts into me, winding his fingers in my hair. When we break apart he’s grinning, even as I bite his chin playfully.
“That sounds good. Will we make it to Albuquerque by tonight?” Harry turns his eyes back to the road, keeping his hands steady on the steering wheel as the horizon shimmers with afternoon heat.
“Firstly, I wanted to,” Harry says, seemingly unruffled by Draco’s tone. “Secondly, I thought that's what we agreed on when we decided to be flatmates. I deal with all the flat stuff since you’re busy at work.”
. You may have his throat but your voice will never be his, smooth and river rocks and old magic.
“I do. How long have you felt–”
“Oh my god,” Draco says, his tone somehow managing to be exasperated and incredulous at the same time. “I underestimated how oblivious you are.”
Harry shoots up in the bed from a deep sleep, disoriented. She blinks, then rubs her eyes, checking the time on her wand. Three am. She wasn’t having a nightmare, so what–
“Which ones?” comes the answering shout. Draco looks under his bed again, huffing in exasperation.
“Surely you can do better than that,” Draco says breathlessly, lifting his hips to match Harry’s rhythm. He opens his eyes just in time to see Harry’s amused smile before Harry, moving too fast to comprehend, pins Draco’s wrist above his head with both hands. Harry rocks into him deeper, settling his weight onto Draco’s wrists, and Draco whimpers.
you're the sexpert, and I
“Draco,” Pansy says, stirring her drink absentmindedly, “we’re in public.”
“Anything,” Draco gasps, because Harry’s slick fingers are pressing against his rim now, almost pushing in but not quite. “Anything, anything, just fucking
Slowly, I let my gaze fall to his cock, nestled in dark curls. “I want to suck you off.” Harry’s eyes go dark and he jerks a bit, moving towards me. “I want you to sit on my face.”
. Are you alright?”
“A competition.”
“I like that,” Draco whispers, and it sounds like a secret when they’re curled up under the sheets together.

“That ship is dead in the water. It’s bait. I’m not going near it.”
“Harry,” I gasp, reaching down to still his hand, because if he keeps praising me and fucking me on his fingers I am going to come
“I’m fucked up, a bit.”
Clearly.
“Hm, what’s north?” Harry asks, glancing away from the road to Draco’s profile. The large paper map spread out across Draco’s thighs crinkles as he shifts.
“Two months is no time at all,” Harry says desperately, trying to insinuate himself through the crack in Draco’s doorway, crowding up against Draco. “I'm not wasting days with you.”
“Oh,” Harry says, his mouth twisting at the corners. “We can– if you’re uncomfortable we don’t have to keep doing this, I can sleep– alone–”
“You… you stayed for breakfast,” Harry says softly, and his hurt is so much worse than his anger. “You asked me about my day. I listened when you talked, because I was interested in what you had to say. I…” Harry makes a wet sound, the dim light glinting off his glasses for a second. “Okay. You know what? Fine. I should’ve known that you– that I wouldn’t be enough.”
“Oh,” I breathe, unable to speak for how unbearably hot that is, to have someone turned on by my pleasure at their hands. Harry’s fingers remain still inside me, filling me up, and I think about his hands flying across the ship’s console, capable and strong. “Fuck, Harry, I want– I want your dick
The mountains take Harry’s breath away, jaggedly reaching for the sky. Draco keeps glancing across the car, but shakes his head with a small smile when Harry asks him if he wants to switch to the passenger seat.

Draco’s boyfriend is beautiful, and clearly knows it; he’s turned his dimples and sparkling brown eyes on Harry no less than five times a minute since they sat down in the living room, Harry on the armchair and Draco next to Joshua on the blue tartan sofa. Harry has met Joshua before only in passing since Draco’s just been seeing him for a few weeks, and Harry’s already getting a bad feeling in his gut. There’s a movie playing, something with a lot of explosions that Joshua had wheedled Draco into putting on, even though Draco flinches every time there’s a loud sound. Joshua, sitting next to him, hasn’t noticed, choosing instead to give Harry a rundown of every article he’s ever written for The Prophet. Harry flicks his eyes over to Draco and watches him curl his fingers into the sleeves of his nicest knit jumper, and wonders why he’s been so quiet. Usually, Harry wouldn’t be able to get Draco to stop talking even if he tried.
“Friends visit each other.”
Draco is. He pauses, the potion still clutched in his hand, trying to understand the feeling that’s twisting inside his chest.
flat– through the shiny yellow paint of the convertible next to him. The sound squeals through the darkness and Brennan winces audibly.
“Okay,” Draco breathes, and Harry leans back, quickly looking away, because she almost just kissed Draco.
you, I don’t want you to touch me, you fucking–”
“I know you said you care but you always act so frustrated about healing me,” Harry says, not looking at Draco. His voice is heartbreakingly small.
“Love, come to bed. Your neck’s going to be sore if you stay here.”
Draco steps back, his throat burning. “I suppose… yes. We did agree on six months.”
and broken off whimpers.
“I thought this feeling was from the bond.” Draco taps two fingers over his heart. “But even as the bond gets weaker, it just gets stronger.”
Draco. The way he knows how to be good for Draco.
“I–” Harry’s gaze darts away, then back to Draco’s face. “I… I don’t know.”

“You’re sure? You’re sure that you want
“Harry. I do want you.” Draco’s voice is rough, dragged over his tongue unwillingly, but he didn’t know Harry wanted him. This.
“You hurt me really badly,” Harry says. “But not because the answer is no. Because you didn’t give us a chance to work it out. You– you’ve never done anything like this, and I thought you wouldn’t come back. I thought you weren’t going to come back and give us the chance to fix it.” Draco sobs again, his body jerking, and Harry holds him closer. “But we can figure it out. If you still want. We can be together for my entire lifetime without getting married and I’d be happy, because it’s you. I don’t need a ring to know how much you love me.”
DRACO
No matter what, they're going to take care of each other.
“Please,” Harry gasps, desperate; then Draco is pale and naked and gorgeous, breathing hard under Harry’s kisses. The Dark Mark lays stark against Draco’s pale arm but when she pulls away Harry pins her wrist to the bed, not letting her hide. Draco tugs Harry’s pyjamas off; Harry forgets to be self-conscious under Draco’s hungry gaze. They’re gentle, just as Draco promised they could be, exploratory fingers and lips against skin. When Harry reaches between Draco’s legs it’s a revelation, and their gasps tangle up into one sound.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, looking down at Harry through their pale lashes. The lacy strap of their sheer, ice blue nightie is slipping down their shoulder, but they can’t do anything about it, not with their wrists bound behind their back in the soft cuffs Harry bought for their third anniversary, so Harry reaches up and slides the strap back into place. He thumbs over the soft lace, then Draco’s skin– there’s a trail of deep red lovebites down Draco’s neck. Harry places a possessive hand around the base of Draco’s throat, their pulse fluttering under his fingers. They look like an angel like this, flushed pink and smiling as though they have a secret.
“You know what I mean, you berk,” Draco replies, his tiny laugh sounding watery.
“I’m going to start with your legs,” Draco says softly. Harry relaxes into the mattress and lets his eyes fall shut. Draco always talks through aftercare, bringing Harry back down to earth. Grounding him, like he does throughout all aspects of their shared lives. Draco’s hands are deft on Harry’s upper thigh, undoing the soft green rope that binds Harry’s calf to the length of his thigh. In each knot is the ghost of Draco’s fingertips, of his teeth scraped along the inside of Harry’s knee.
“Draco?” Harry raises his head a bit, a crease of worry appearing between his eyebrows. “What’s wrong?”
Draco likes him, too.
Harry’s face is slack, as though he’s been slapped, and Draco realizes what he said.
Harry’s hands are
“That isn’t a why,” Draco replies quietly.
“You want me to get you off, angel?” Harry’s voice is low and warm, like they’re both in on a joke. It makes Draco feel strangely safe for a moment, until Harry crooks his finger and all Draco knows is white-hot pleasure. “You wanna come?”
In the mornings they eat breakfast together, Draco usually shoving food into his mouth as he looks over the morning’s Prophet, especially the articles he contributed to, always self-critical. Harry takes to slapping the paper away from him with a laugh and asking him silly questions instead; Harry’s an unrelenting morning person, it turns out.
“So you’re in the Department of Magical Creatures?”
“I’d like that.”
But sometimes, being married to Harry Potter goes a bit more like this: being stuck at an hours-long gala, schmoozing with rich purebloods in order to secure funds for the Potter-Malfoy charity foundation, delicately stuffing one’s face with hors d'oeuvres in order to avoid probing, gossip-fueled questions.
, and Draco is so startled he comes all over his own fist.
“That’s not the truth.”
“Potter, what the fuck?” Draco snaps, more out of panic than anything, because Harry’s hair smells singed where it’s pressed against Draco’s cheek. “Potter.”
“Shhh.” Very slowly, Harry begins to thrust his fingers again. “Shh, pet, let me make sure you’re ready.”
“I’m assuming since you didn’t know what grav means, you haven’t ever done this,” I say, and his eyes fly open. “Hedwig, turn off the grav,” I state right as Draco’s eyes go wide in realization.
“Draco,” Harry says. He doesn’t go far, just enough to look Draco in the eyes; his arms are still looped loosely around Draco’s waist and his gaze is intense, yet questioning.
“Fuck me, you coward,” Draco snarls, his voice rough. He doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes, even as Harry shoves his finger in up to the knuckle, his legs nearly turning to jelly at the impossible heat there. Soon he’s fucking two fingers into Draco, who’s clinging to the dresser with one foot barely on the floor and the other leg wrapped around Harry’s hip, digging in hard. After a particularly sharp thrust Draco scrabbles at Harry’s boxers, mumbling a steady stream of expletives when Harry’s cock bobs free and slides against his own length.
“Uh.” Harry licks his lips, and Draco helps him into a sitting position against the arm of the couch before pressing the glass of water to Harry’s lips. Harry drinks it down in four big gulps, coughing a bit afterwards. “Oh, that’s better. Arms are cold? I guess that’s the potion. And it doesn’t really hurt anymore, I think.”
“I think I’ve got an idea,” Harry starts, and Hermione reaches into the bag of croissants before dropping into the armchair across from the couch. “But it’s going to involve
“Do you even know who I–” he starts, then grimaces, turning his face away. “Fine.”
“Darling.” Draco brushes a curl away from Harry’s eye and Harry turns, keeping his eyes closed as he nuzzles into Draco’s fingers. “Yes, I know you’re very sweet when you’re sleepy. But I want to hold you, preferably in our very large and very comfortable bed.”
Harry stands up abruptly, his eyes glued to the thin line of Draco’s mouth, the downturn of his gaze. “I’m gonna change the movie.”
“Stop,” Draco says, fiercely enough that Harry freezes. “
, how much people love his work, and by the time people are meandering to the door Draco is half-convinced Harry is going to jump him right here in the middle of the gallery.
is proving to Draco exactly how much those smiles dig right under his heart.
“Hi,” Harry says almost timidly. Draco tries to catch his breath as Harry shifts, sliding out of Draco, pressing a palm to Draco’s cheek when he winces. “You’re alright. Let me put the strap in the loo, alright? I’ll be right back to clean us up.”
“Uh. Three years? The Auror program is five years, but I quit at three, and then there was a little bit– but I guess I wasn’t really– yeah. Three years.”
. It is just us, do you understand? It’s you and me, and we’ll figure it out.”
Harry’s grip on Draco’s bare upper arm falters, just a bit. Draco could live the rest of his life with Harry touching him– with his palms, with his calloused fingers, heavy with the pair of thick gold rings Draco gifted him recently. They lessen the effects of Dark curses– a finicky bit of old magic woven into them, delicate but strong. A gift that made sense to give a coworker in their line of work, Draco had reasoned with himself.
“Hi?” Harry croaks, and Draco sags in relief. At least he’s somewhat lucid.
Draco laughs softly, a puff of air against my face. His breath smells like sex. Like cock. “You’ll have to try harder than that to scare me away. I want to see the whole universe.”
His hands are burning against my bare forearms. He let me borrow one of his soft, short sleeved shirts to sleep in.
“May I drive?”
Draco doesn’t even try to hide his overly dramatic gasp as he and Pansy point to each other. She snickers then looks around the room, her eyes going wide and falsely innocent. “It seems most people think it’s me. Or,” she says, drawing out the word as she leans back into Ginny’s lap. “Ginevra here.”
“God, you’re ruthless,” Draco murmurs, half to himself and half to whatever cosmic force is enacting its retribution on him now. But of course Harry is
“Did you kiss me for the first time with no gravity so I couldn’t make fun of you for being short?”
“Six months of
“Because you do this to it.” With a flap of her hands, Malfoy moves closer to the middle of the sofa. “Fine. Come here.”
Harry keeps his eyes on Draco as he kneels to the ground, letting the leyline shimmer across the grass before dissolving into nothing. He moves towards Draco, shaky on his feet but holding his gaze steady.
“This is Potter on the Hedwig answering your distress beacon,” they say, in a clipped tone that makes me think that’s a standard message. For the thirtieth time today, I wish I could go back in time and kick myself, and maybe throw a starship manual at past-me’s proud head.
. Harry’s thumb digs into Draco’s hip nearly to the point of pain, and Draco fucking loves it, and
Somehow, Harry manages to press a thermos of coffee and Draco’s briefcase into his hands every morning, even though Draco himself rarely remembers where he leaves things scattered across the flat. Evenings are comfortable, especially once they start watching trivia shows after dinner. Draco would be great at them if he knew anything about Muggles, and Harry yells his completely incorrect answers in a very confident manner. Sometimes, on these evenings, Draco can take a deep breath and forget politics, the Ministry, and whatever bullshit article he’s working on at his job. He can just exist, laughing harder when Harry’s hand pushes him off the couch after he makes a terrible joke.
Draco did it.
“You’re just going to leave?” Harry asks, as though Draco didn’t hear him the first time.
Harry hums, murmuring a spell and slicking his hand over himself. “Are you sure–”

“Call me sweetheart again.” In the dim light, Draco's eyes are fiercely bright.
Harry grins above him, simultaneously bright and wolfish.
“More than I let you see,” Draco amends quietly, and Harry goes silent, still trembling in Draco’s embrace. “Let’s sleep, then.”
“I can leave, if you want.”
Draco removes his trousers as slowly as he dares, keeping his eyes on Harry the whole time. Harry’s expression is sharp and tender all at once, and he tracks Draco’s hands as Draco slides off his shoes, then neatly folds his trousers and his pants and sets them on the side table. He doesn’t dare touch himself, even accidentally; right now he is entirely Harry’s, and he doesn't have permission.
“No penetration,” Harry replies, staring down at me as though he’s considering whether I’m real or not. “But touching anywhere is fine.” His legs are already above my arms, so I reach up and press my palms flat against his thighs, urging him closer to my mouth. He’s everywhere, my whole vision blurring with his proximity and his heat and the musky smell of sex, and then his cock is right above my mouth, slick smearing across my chin. The moment I realize he’s holding himself up with his thigh muscles alone, my cock makes a valiant effort to get hard again, heat pooling in my stomach, but this is about Harry, now. This is about me being good for Harry.
“Harry, I’m sorry.”
“Harry’s great at pulling!” Ron belatedly supplies, earning him a glare from Draco and a thumbs up from Harry.
“Love you,” Draco murmurs, and Harry kisses him again, firmer.
“I don’t care.”
“Yes. Absolutely.”
for Harry. But that doesn’t mean he enjoys these events, not really, hence the suggestion of the plug. Harry’s eyes had gone wide, then squinty they way they do when he latches onto an idea, and when he helped Draco into his dress robes earlier this evening he had slipped the silver plug and a bottle of lube into Draco’s hand and murmured

“Shh,” Draco soothes when Harry tries to sit up. “I haven’t undone the rope yet. Just lie back, there you are.”
“I also get my beauty sleep,” Draco says cheerfully, but he turns his face aside, his chapped bottom lip trembling. Harry moves across the room to sit beside Draco’s sleep-warm form.
“That’s what you’re supposed to do after a breakup. When someone leaves without warning,” Harry says. He hasn’t come any closer, but his low voice carries; Draco’s body gravitates toward it instinctively, even after all this time.
For a brief, lovely moment, Draco’s racing thoughts grind to a halt. He blinks at Harry’s earnest face and lets himself smile, wrapping his hands around the thermos. “Thanks. Thank you, Harry.”
“You weren’t even paying attention to him,” Harry scoffs, and Draco presses himself fully against Harry’s side for a moment. Harry forces himself to take a deep breath in.
He crooks his fingers again and I melt into the bed, tightening my hold on his curls. “I just want you to enjoy yourself too–”
, Draco thinks, putting a palm flat on the desktop to steady himself.

. No. I want…” Harry trails off as his fingers find Draco’s jawline, creeping up to gently trace the bow of Draco’s lips. “I want you all to myself.”
Draco is frozen in place, panic spreading icy through his veins. “I didn’t mean–”
“Well we may have some time to cook together,” Harry says hopefully, pouring himself a mug of tea. “Do you have a travel mug?”
Harry sighs, and sits down on the other end of the sofa, leaving space between them; she isn’t sure what Malfoy is okay with, in this strange new lack of contention.
Hedwig slams out of half-warp the minute I try to take a sip of coffee.

“Are you sure…” Draco starts, trailing off when Harry pulls back to look him in the eye.
Harry is golden, and he is beautiful.
“Takeout?” Harry asks, and Draco nods.
“That’s bollocks.”
“No.” Draco somehow manages to sound sharp and tender at the same time. “No, no, you’re… may I touch you?”
“Darling,” Draco murmurs as Harry tucks himself under Draco’s arm. “Do you want to tell me about it?”
“We were never together.”
, I want you to fuck me so deep there’s no chance you won’t put a baby in me, I want to keep your come in me until the next time you fuck me so I’m all wet, just for your cock, oh god please please–”
“Come here,” Harry murmurs, hooking a finger in the air. Draco steps forward without thinking, then stops. Harry tilts his head before smiling faintly. “I wasn’t asking.”
“You’re gonna come, huh?”
“Harry?” Draco asks after a while, his voice tentative. Everything about Draco is tentative, these days. “Will you actually drive a bit longer?”
MISSING: HEIR TO SCORPIUS
Harry shrugs, shuffling his feet around on the carpet. “It’s cool? It’s like magic, but without magic.”
“You like that?” he asks with a snap of his hips, and I jolt, still gripping my cock. He thrusts into me again and again, sweat smearing where our skin meets. “Hold your legs like this,” he commands, so I do, tucking my hands behind my knees and holding myself open for him. He plants his hands flat on the bed next to my shoulders and thrusts into me hard enough that I move up the bed a few inches.
“Draco,” Harry says quietly. When Draco turns around, Harry is standing in the doorway to the kitchen, his fingers worrying at the edge of Draco’s red jumper. His eyes are bright behind his glasses, and Draco realizes a moment too late that Harry is about to cry.
“You need to talk to him,” Draco says, his demanding words softened by familiarity. Hermione presses a hand to her forehead, then exhales.
Draco grabs the back of Harry’s neck and kisses him hard enough to push Harry down into the sofa cushions. When Draco pulls away, he’s bright pink and blinking hard.
“On my finger,” Draco says, turning big eyes to Harry. “It

“Three, two, one, point!” Ginny shouts, then freezes, squinting around the room. “My esteemed acquaintances,” she says, dipping her voice low and making it overly posh. “It appears we have a TIE!”
There’s a yelp and a crash, and Harry launches himself off the couch, scrambling into the kitchen to find a red-flushed, pajama-clad Draco.
“See, it’s easier like this,” he murmurs, tracing his fingers down the knobs of Draco’s spine. “It’s easier when you just give in. When you let me take what’s mine.”

“I don’t think you know what dancing really is,” he murmurs, voice soft and his eyes wide. “You can’t do the proper steps if your feet aren’t on the floor.”
“Yeah,” I say incredulously, letting myself marvel at this man beside me, warm and real and wonderful. “We’ve got the whole universe.”
“I mean, I know it’s me,” Harry continues, taking a slow sip of coffee. “But I feel like you don’t quite believe that.”
“Fuck off.” Draco yanks his free wrist out of Harry’s grip and scrambles away, managing only a short distance before the chain pulls taut. His chest is heaving, and the short locks of his hair are mussed, making him look rather wild, half-crouched on his knees. Harry doesn’t move– Draco

“Fuck me, Harry.”
“Good morning, Hermione. Sorry about…” He waves in the general direction of his face. “This. I usually apply glamours before seeing anyone, they wear off overnight.”
“Let me get more lube,” Harry says quietly against Draco’s neck. “And a pillow for you.” Draco just nods, too overwhelmed to speak. Harry settles smug between his thighs, Draco’s legs hooked over his arms.
“There’s no emotional compulsion in this bond,” Harry says softly, finally sliding out of Draco and wincing slightly. He cleans them up with a quick spell, then settles down against Draco’s side. “What I feel is definitely emotional.”
of having nowhere to put all of this love.
“Yeah.” Draco presses their foreheads together and Harry swallows, trying to smooth his voice out. “Yeah, that wasn’t your best move.”
“Look at you,” Harry pants as he thrusts hard, the rough materials of his jeans rasping against Draco’s sensitive skin. “You’re gagging for it.”

Harry just nods. The prat.
Harry presses one last kiss to Draco’s jaw before sitting up and shifting his body until his thighs bracket Draco’s head. Draco looks up and meets Harry’s eyes, seeking the adoration and heat that he instantly finds. Harry’s tawny skin is flushed, his body blazing hot where it’s pressed to Draco’s. For a moment they’re suspended like that, the lines of Harry’s body anticipatory; then Draco brings his hands up to press flat to Harry’s thighs and Harry moves fluidly, gripping onto the headboard and moving up Draco’s body. Draco easily wraps his mouth around Harry’s cock, groaning at the feeling as Harry gasps above him.

,” Draco insists, whacking my arm for good measure. “I’ll remind you you’re talking to a prince,” he continues haughtily, trying to fight a smile, and I roll my eyes as I take my mug from his hands. That’s his favorite comeback– I think it’s because he’s easing into the idea of not being a prince anymore. He hasn’t told me much beyond his breakdown that first night, other than insisting over and over again that he won’t go back, only looking vaguely reassured when I tell him I won’t let anyone make him go back. Luckily I haven’t caught wind of anything on him in the news, so hopefully no one caught a trace of my ship right next to his in the Jkin system. Hedwig has good shields, but I rely much more on her sensors to pick up danger and her speed to get me the hell away from it. If we haven’t had any trouble so far, odds are good that we won’t for a while, at least until we have to dock on a planet for fuel. That’s a problem for future-me, though.
“Yes,” Draco replies immediately, her voice low.
Draco is always so warm.
“How did you know it was my first time?”
“Harry,” Draco murmurs softly, and Harry rolls over immediately, draping an arm over Draco’s waist, rucking up his shirt to reach bare skin. Draco sighs, content.
Speechless, Draco just lies there, underneath Harry, soaking in his words. The air between them is hot, almost uncomfortably so, but Draco sinks into it like a winter cloak.
Draco wills his hands not to shake as he reaches for the top button of his shirt. He’s still awestruck by Harry’s attention, particularly when they’re like this– Harry sprawled and confident, in charge, and Draco blissfully taken care of, waiting to be told what to do. Those green eyes are nearly burning through Draco’s skin as he reaches the second button and pushes open his collar slightly. Draco tilts his head, not daring to raise his gaze until he’s allowed. He slips the button out of the hole, then freezes at Harry’s low voice.
Maybe Harry holds a well in his heart, too.
what’s he missing?
Hours later, after a speed-run of research and delicate spellwork and panic, Harry blinks his bright eyes, strangely naked without his glasses. When he finally focuses on Draco’s face, he breaks out into a grin that shoots warmth right through Draco’s chest.
Harry moves into the kitchen while mulling this over this, gently taking the spatula out of Draco’s hand and moving the bacon to a cool burner. He clicks the hob off before looking at Draco, who stands frozen. “The bacon’s done,” Harry says. Draco blinks, exhaling shallowly. “Draco.”
“I– I–” Harry stutters, then hiccups a sob and turns away. Draco is across the kitchen in a second, gathering Harry into his arms, tucking Harry’s soft curls under his chin.
Draco blinks, and blinks, trying to understand. “I don’t–”
Harry doesn’t answer, and that’s when Draco realizes he’s passed out. His mind shifts into Healer mode, and he presses two fingers up to Harry’s neck as best he can, noting the rapid fluttering of the pulse there. Harry’s dead weight is nearly impossible to maneuver so Draco levitates him into the sitting room and onto the couch. As he starts to run diagnostic spells over Harry’s limp form, he formulates his lecture for when Harry wakes up.
It’s too much. Draco has to turn away now, internally admonishing himself for acting on impulse. It’s good, what they have. It’s good. He shouldn’t ask for more.
“I– it was maddening.” Draco jerks his head to the side, certain that Harry’s fiercely intense expression is directed at him even though he can’t see it. “It was fantastic. I– Harry, please, I need–”
“Get out of my flat,” Harry says, low in his throat. Both Joshua and Draco freeze. Joshua simply gapes at Harry, and Draco– Draco is fighting an incredulous smile, and that alone tells Harry he did the right thing. Draco stands up, tangling his hands in the hem of his jumper and flicking his gaze between the two other men. He moves closer to Harry, knocking against his shoulder as Joshua stands too.
. You made me, you
Draco trembles, but doesn’t pull away. “Stay the night? If you want, you don’t have to.”
Draco takes a step back, his heel catching on the fireplace as he realizes he’s hard. He’s hard, and chastised, and remorseful, and fucking
“I work with dragons,” Harry had murmured, flashing a crooked smile, and fuck. Fuck.
“I’m not going to kiss you,” Harry says, and Draco jerks back, cracking his head against the dresser. Harry leans away, meeting Draco’s frantic gaze. As he watches, Draco’s face shutters, becoming cold and stiff.
Flick your wand, dark skin shifting to pale, rippling rippling. The glamours took longer to learn than you thought but it doesn’t matter when you have nothing better to do when you’ve been fired from the Auror training program with encouragement to go to a Mind Healer for
“You motherfucker–” Draco yanks Harry back underneath him and Ginny rolls her eyes, addressing the rest of the room.
There’s a crack of Appraition and Draco is tossed bodily onto their bed, gasping as he lands and realizes his husband just wandlessly Apparated them while
“You’re shaking,” Harry says abruptly. He pulls Draco into his lap, and suddenly everything shifts back into rightness in Draco’s chest. Draco sinks down against Harry, fighting down the sudden and terrible urge to cry. “Baby,” Harry murmurs, his voice tinged with concern. “Baby, what’s wrong?”
,” Draco shouts, trying to fight against the cuffs on his wrists and ankles holding him spread-eagle on his stomach across their bed. Harry thrusts into him again, hard, grabbing a fistful of Draco’s hair and tugging until Draco cranes his head back. “Harry, Harry, god fuck–”
For a moment Draco is frozen, then he sits up and warily regards Harry. “You’re here to sleep?”
“Uh.” Harry blinks. “Wow.”
Whatever Draco might have said to that is lost to the depths of his mind as Harry settles on top of him and slides in, maddeningly slow. Draco shudders, trying to keep himself loose and open, but he flinches in surprise when Harry’s hand cups his jaw.
, and then took Draco to his favorite coffee shop once they were off work.
“Fucking gorgeous,” Harry pants against Draco’s cheek, and Draco can’t do anything but babble nonsensical strings of words,
. I try to press my lips together, to stop the flow of words, but then he hits my prostate and I’m yelling up into his mouth as he presses his lips to mine. Two more thrusts and I’m done for, my vision going blurry as I come in warm ropes between our bodies, Harry’s teeth digging into my bottom lip.
“Would you like to stop completely?”

from Harry, even if it hurt, but at the fact that Harry swallowed that bait unquestioningly.
“My first name’s Harry,” Potter says, snapping me out of my spiral. We didn’t really get a chance to exchange pleasantries when I came aboard his ship (Hedwig?) due to the rather imminent threat of my own ship blowing up. I was convinced that couldn’t happen, the fuel ratio wasn’t right, but he’d levelled me with this
“Parallel lines.”
“I was serious about the ways strangers usually spend their time on my ship. I thought I could turn you in, but you’re just a person. As soon as I knew you as a person I couldn’t do it. My moral compass doesn’t always point true north,” I say, slinging my most charming smile at him, and he relaxes slightly. “But I’m also not that callous. If it was a kidnapping, it’d be a different story. But if you left of your own volition–”
, scrambling Draco’s thoughts.
“Everything’s good,” I affirm, then turn towards him, hoping my smile comes across as normal. “You ever been on a ship with no grav?”
“To do what?”
“Fuck you,” Harry snaps, because he’s not going to admit to wanting this. He pulls Draco’s pyjamas all the way down, where they pool on the floor. He shoves his hand down between Draco’s thighs, and Draco lets his legs fall open as he goes limp, held up almost solely by Harry’s hand under his chin. He looks… debauched. Desperate. His pyjama top is falling open, showing off a pale collarbone, and Harry gives into the urge to bite down on it right as his middle finger finds the furl of Draco’s hole. Draco keens, thrashing like he wants out from underneath Harry, and Harry wavers; he’s angry, and he wants to sink his teeth into every part of Draco, but not if Draco doesn’t actually want this.
Draco kisses
“Everyone point,” Pansy yells, her wine glass wobbling in her loose fingers, “to the person who would definitely be down with bondage.”
“Be good for me,” Draco whispers as he falls back onto the bed, pulling Harry on top of him. Harry’s hands are everywhere, scrabbling against Draco’s skin.
“This isn’t your fault.” Draco gestures vaguely at his face. His gaze is bright, darting across Harry’s expression. “That was someone– someone else's decision. I could’ve been more direct with you, I suppose. I was just scared.”
Harry yanks on the chain, forcing Draco’s arms backwards, and Draco yelps. “Finish that sentence.”
“Yeah.” Draco tilts his face back up towards Harry and closes his eyes. In the stark light of the bathroom he looks so pale, the bruise purple-blue against his eye and cheek, but in the suspended moment Harry realizes how
“Thank you,” Harry says quietly. He’s staring down at the ground, subdued. “Thank you for– caring. I’m sorry that I– I’m sorry, Draco. Really. I care about you too, you know.”
“You help me pick outfits for my dates,” Draco exclaims, dropping his head down into the crook of Harry’s neck. “You seem so happy whenever someone asks me out!”
“Baby,” Harry murmurs into my neck as I blink, coming back to myself, dragging air into my lungs. “Are you doing alright?”
“Do you think this is fate?”
“Harry,” Draco says with a soft laugh. “Oh, Harry. You already are.”
“While our favorite oblivious idiots literally wrestle each other on the ground, I think it’s Luna’s turn.”
, Harry Potter. Come on.”
Draco snorts softly. “You haven’t asked me out.”
Their friends think they’re crazy, and maybe they are a bit, but they
“You are.”

“I won’t. You’re stuck with me.”
Poured out underneath my thighs, Draco looks like starlight made human. His pink lips are parted, and his breathing is shallow as he looks up at me. Stars, I’m going to make this good for him.
Silence falls. Harry chances a glance across the car, the afterimage of Draco flashing on the back of his eyelids even once he looks away again; pale hair, dark undereye bags, crimson knit jumper.

but the way Harry does it–
Draco nods.
“Dinner date,” Draco reads outloud before sitting up quickly, staring at Harry. “That’s not sex.”
“No.” Harry tries to back out of the circle of Draco's arms, but Draco holds fast. “What? No. I have to– they need me to do this.”
“Get a move on before we’re scoped by pirates. Also, you’re giving me your entire life story and a reason to trust you while we cruise.”
“Harry, what–”
Harry is blinded by absolute
“They do,” I say, trying not to sound stiff. “All of them.” If I had any friends, I would flay myself alive before letting them call me
“Will you just… talk to me?” Draco asks, her voice small.
Harry’s breath is burning hot on Draco’s neck. “Yeah?”
“Leyline technicians–” Draco swallows, trying to keep his rage tamped down. “Leyline technicians are supposed to be highly trained and work in teams of four, Harry. They never touch a leyline, because the lines– they start to rip up your magical core after years if they’re handled with bare skin. Has the damage been getting worse, and that’s why you came to me?” Harry nods. “Jesus fucking christ,” Draco spits out, and Harry looks up at Draco with a startled laugh.
“Okay, we can talk about that later. Right now let’s get you to bed.”
sex, or they have the most general knowledge?”
, I can’t believe you’re even real–
Draco’s orgasm hits him out of nowhere, heat rushing up his thighs and leaving him gasping as Harry continues to move his hand through the come now smeared over Draco’s cock and Harry’s fingers. He shudders in the aftershocks and shifts away from Harry’s hand with a whimper. Immediately Harry is leaning over him, gently combing through Draco’s hair with his clean hand and pressing kisses to Draco’s cheek. “You’re so good for me,” he murmurs, his voice sweet against Draco’s skin. “Do you like being good for me, baby? Do you think I should give you what you asked for?”
.” Harry drops his voice low, sing-song. “Do you wanna be my baby?” Draco shoves him half-heartedly, trying to hide the hot blush he can feel creep up his cheeks, but Harry presses forward with a grin. “Do you wanna be my darling, my sweetheart, my angel–”
, Draco had requested earlier, so now his eyes go wide and he licks his lips before seeming to remember he’s supposed to be putting up a fight. He thrashes, managing to send Harry careening to the side of the bed before he can get one of the cuffs around Draco’s wrist, holding tight to the length of chain attached.
He also might be my first actual friend, which is a sweet concept, until I remember that I also want to climb him like a fucking tree. Eight days in space with the fittest man in the universe has made me
“I can do both.” The bruise on Draco’s face is fading with the potion, and Harry rubs a gentle thumb under it until Draco moves to stand up. “Come along,” he says, offering a hand down to Harry, a soft and genuine smile on his face. “I think I would like you to hold me.”
“Next time, serious conversations are happening before my cock is inside you,” Harry pants when they break apart, because now that his worry is gone he might simply go up in flames from how aroused he is. “Fuck, Draco.”
“Of hearing you say no out loud.”
He sits tentatively back down into his chair, and I sit in mine. He looks at me for a long moment, really
“The cuffs are hurting and it’s not– not in a good way– I promise I won’t fight I just–”
“If I don’t have your cock in my mouth in the next thirty seconds–” I start, and Harry starts laughing, his eyes crinkling shut.
“Shh, just listen. She had a lot of daughters, her moonbeams, but there was one that was the brightest of all. This moonbeam was beautiful, and shone down to earth with such determination, that the moon decided to give this daughter a single wish.” Harry strokes her hands through Draco’s hair again, then traces the shell of her ear. “Do you want to know what she wished for?”
“Fuck me?” Draco’s voice comes out rough and low. Desperate.
Harry’s stomach lurches as he stares at Draco, seeing the guilt steeped into every line of his body, in the shadow of his expression.
“Then yes.”
, his cheekbones.
“Shut up,” Harry grumbles, but he can’t help smiling. All of his friends are fully aware that Harry spends most of his time volunteering at the closest animal shelter, but they still love ribbing him about his choices. “Someone brought in a whole litter of kittens today with no mom. They’re so small and every single one was completely black. So I did a lot of prep for their kennel, making it cozy for them. You should’ve seen Margot, the director, she’s so soft over kittens…” The conversation unspools easily, with Draco interrupting every so often, and before either of them realize it their plates are empty.
” Draco breathes, a knee jerk reaction as his world shifts around him.
Harry sits down heavily across from Draco, appetite suddenly gone. “But you must feel bad.  Physically.”
“Okay.” Harry swallows, then wraps his arms around Draco’s neck gently, fearful of hurting him again. “I’m sorry. It’s too late to say it, but I am.” He tightens his hold just a bit; Draco’s breathing is loud in his ear. “I’ll leave you alone the rest of the year as well as I can, I just want– I need– this. Right now.”
“What are you doing?”
“I know.”
. Draco stands frozen on the threshold, so Harry grabs her wrist and tugs gently. “Draco, come in. You’re alright.”
I drape a hand across his waist, loosening one of the harness straps. Once Harry catches on he helps me, divesting himself of the strap-on. He slides off the bed to set it back into the white box it came from, and then he stands next to the bed, watching me. Seeing him like this, all at once, sends blood rushing back down to my soft cock, so I take my time looking him over– the dark hair on his legs, his thick thighs, his clever hands and his teasing smirk.
He already knew that Draco’s job at the Prophet is demanding– to hear Draco talk about it, he’s basically a glorified intern who does enough work for two other staff. Whenever they’ve hung out before, Draco seemed bright and a little bit wired, but Harry thought that was just his personality. Barely two days into living with him, though, Harry can already see exactly how much Draco’s work affects every part of his life.
“Yep,” I reply. I want to get out of here as soon as possible, but I also don’t know this man at all. Crown prince or no, he could kill me and take my ship the second my back is turned. Though he did manage to fuck up piloting a Silver Swan, so that’s doubtful. He couldn’t handle a fraction of Hedwig. “You have to come to the cockpit with me though.”
Harry laughs, surprised and delighted. “Just wanted to say I love you.”
The day Draco moves in with Harry, it’s pouring rain.
, too. She wants to know Draco, to see her and be seen in return, to kiss the hollow of Draco’s flushed throat.
And I like them mouthy.
The sirens are screaming all around me, and my heart is going to beat itself out of my chest in the next thirty seconds if I don’t get off this ship.
let me come–”
“The grey Oxfords,” he says as he strides into the kitchen, stopping in his tracks at the full plate of breakfast laid out on the table. Harry is in front of the hob, setting the kettle to boil– his flat is muggle, and Draco has noticed he does almost everything in the kitchen the muggle way.
Draco breaks away first this time, pressing his forehead to Harry’s as they move clumsily across the tiles, stepping on each other's bare feet, which sends Harry into a fit of giggles. Soon Draco is laughing too, wildly, as though he can’t help it. Harry’s joy is too big for his body, and Draco’s words resonate somewhere deep inside his chest.
“Harry–”
Draco murmurs softly the whole time, too low for Harry to fully comprehend, snatches of words such as
Draco comes so hard that the darkness of his closed eyelids explodes in starbursts of red, blue, purple.

Then, they had walked back out the front doorway and something above them exploded in a starburst of purple and black, and now they’re here. In St. Mungo’s. In the same bed.
sleep with someone different for each act but…”
“God, Draco.”
“Idiot,” Draco says, and now he is laughing, a soft sound that Harry immediately wants to cup in his palms and keep. “I’m quite fucked up and will do anything for your attention, including being a bastard.”

“I shouldn’t have hurt you.” Draco shrugs, and Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s pajamas. “No,
“You want to stick your fucking golden cock in me,” Draco snarls, grabbing Harry’s wrist hard enough to bruise and shoving his hand down between their bodies. “Savior of the wizarding world, and you’d touch
“Good.”
. It feels so good. Harry shifts in Draco’s arms, getting comfortable, his skin warm and a bit sweaty where it presses against Draco’s. The blanket rustles as Harry presses his lips into the crook of Draco’s neck, softly, again and again.
Harry reaches out for the blanket, tucking it over his legs and moving closer to Draco in the process. “I don’t care about you just because you can heal me. You know that, right?”
“What–” Harry blinks, his thoughts sluggish as he tries to breathe deeply. “Draco, of course. Of course it’s yes, did you think I’d say no?”
“You wore a skirt that one time, I think you had borrowed Granger’s when something happened to your trousers? I don’t know, but it
“It was just you.” Harry realizes he’s trembling, but when he tries to take his hand back, Draco holds on tighter.

Draco rakes his fingers through his long hair, a sudden desperation in his eyes. “I can’t go back. Please don’t make me go back.”
, fuck me.”
They also wake up tangled in each other's limbs every morning, always in Draco’s bed.
“Let me try that coffee,” Draco says testily, reaching for my mug like he does every morning, then gagging dramatically. Like he does every morning. “I keep thinking that’s going to get better.”
After a moment Draco follows, looking skeptical. Harry digs out a pair of fuzzy socks from underneath the couch, slipping them on and moving to the middle of the rug.
“It’s what makes us be able to walk like we’re on–”
“I– can I–” Draco’s eyes are wild, and a strangely vulnerable expression flashes across his face. It makes something twist in Harry’s chest and he growls, thrusting his hips forward until the tip of his cock pushes against Draco’s fingertips. “Ah, fuck,” Draco gasps, wrapping his hand fully around Harry’s cock. “Fuck, you’re big. Fuck. Okay.”
“Looking at you tied down for me is all the foreplay I need,” Harry says smugly, rolling his hips, and Draco squeezes his eyes shut behind the blindfold because Harry is
Harry sets the plate down.
Draco lets herself be led into the room, footsteps soft against the floor. For a moment Harry wavers next to the bed, unsure of what to do; this is unknown territory. A terra incognita of mussed bedsheets.
“Yes,” Harry says, his eyes blazing. “Yes, I’m very sure.”
it, or are you going to show me?”
“If you don’t fuck me right now,” Draco growls, “I will kill you.”
,” Harry snaps, then keeps his hand pressed there, as he fucks Draco so hard he nearly doesn’t feel the pleasure of it until Draco comes untouched with a muffled shout, tightening around Harry, and Harry’s orgasm hits out of nowhere. He bites so hard on Draco’s exposed shoulder that he tastes blood, and Draco
“That’s what the book is for. It explains… safety, and pressure points, and safewords. How to…” Draco waves his hands vaguely, leaving Harry’s palms empty. “Be risk-aware. That’s the term. I know you won’t hurt me.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. Never fully comfortable with silence– another fact that Draco has learned, spending all this time with Harry. “Feelings aren’t always evenly matched. I know that. So I understand.”
“I think we should decide who is the sexpert once and for all,” Harry says across the couch, and Draco blinks blearily at him.

“Well I just– I had a whole argument ready, to convince you that it would be better, which is why I opened with that line because I thought it would ease the tension and you’d be more willing to say yes if I made a joke about the inconvenience of traveling to each other’s homes, but I realize now it didn’t sound like a joke, it just sounded like a
Harry blinks. All of his intense energy has fallen away, and he simply looks soft and well shagged. Despite himself, Draco takes the chance to look at all of Harry at once– his powerful arms, his solid chest, the thick trail of hair leading down to the vee of his legs.
“You’re unbelievable.”
The spell indicates that only Harry’s arms are affected, and Draco doesn’t give himself time to be relieved as he slides Harry’s thick leather jacket off as gently as he can. He bites back a gasp as he catches sight of Harry’s arms, his skin dark against the bright white of his t-shirt.
“One nod to come on your face, two nods for your back. Shake your head if you need something else.” Draco nods just once, and Harry presses a soft kiss down to Draco’s forehead. Despite their dynamic when they play, he’s never cruel; he doesn’t want to be. He’s allowed to be gentle with his things.
him. Before, Draco touched him like an apology; now it’s a statement, fingers digging into Harry’s skin. Draco cries out Harry’s name when he comes.
“Oh, my darlingest,” Draco says, fluttering his eyelashes like a Hollywood film star. “Please, do let me go. I’m
“I wouldn’t say it
Draco inhales shallowly, keeping his eyes on Harry. “I assumed I was mistaken.”
. “And I don’t even have you.”
“C’mon,” Harry says quietly, guiding Draco onto his back on the bed. At this point Draco lets his eyes fall shut, unable to keep looking at the radiance of Harry’s features: his beautiful mouth, his furrowed brow.
“Mhm,” Harry murmurs, dipping his mouth lower, and he does prove it– again, and again, and again.
He hums in happiness and quicker than I expect my orgasm is buzzing up through my thighs, bursting into pleasure as he works me through it with warm, wet lips. Someone is moaning, and I have a suspicion that it’s me. Eventually I pull off of him, shuddering with overstimulation and crumpling boneless by his side.
“Okay,” he says briskly when he’s done. Harry is sitting up and staring at him, looking half amused and half startled. “Don’t say anything until we get to my flat and I figure out what’s wrong or I may punch you.” Harry opens his mouth, and Draco points at him violently. “Do
“I didn’t know there was a proper name for my job.”
Draco takes a step back at that, pinned down by Harry’s intense gaze. “I– I,” he says helplessly. “How did you know I...”
LAST SEEN DEPARTING PLANET IN SILVER SWAN 4509
“Potter,” Malfoy says, and it’s a finality. Harry wants to say
about Harry during sex, and Draco’s cock throbs painfully, his orgasm crowding up underneath his skin. Harry keeps moving, rubbing himself as he fucks Draco hard, and both of them are gasping; the only sounds are their harsh breathing and the wet slap of skin against skin. When Harry meets Draco’s gaze again his eyes are bright and glazed, his mouth dropped open.
Harry laughs, that warm rumbly thing that sends Draco’s nerves tingling all the way down to his toes, and that’s how he sinks into sleep– with the sound of Harry’s happiness, breaking up the darkness.
“Harry,” he repeats, exasperated now. Harry is sprawled across the sofa on his stomach, his neck crooked strange and his green Healer robes still fastened up to his throat, crumpled from a long night shift. Across his forehead loose curls spill from a neon pink scrunchie, one he definitely stole from Draco’s bathroom drawer, and he’s faintly snoring into the sofa cushion. As Draco wakes up fully he takes a second to drink in the sight, overwhelmed with love, before moving forward to kneel beside Harry’s shoulder.
“Alright, baby?” Harry asks. He threads his hands through Draco’s hair, sliding out the hair tie so that their scalp won’t get sore from the ponytail. Draco wiggles, rolling off to Harry’s side and stretching their legs out with a soft sound.
“What–” Harry huffs a laugh, trying to pull away from Draco. “Obviously untruth, you’ve done that one a thousand times.” He’s right– Draco pulls that card whenever Harry’s feeling shitty, but right now– right now–
Draco punches him.
“Then, yes.”
“That’s the worst kind of dancing. You have to dance with your whole body,” I tell him, and push my foot against the edge of the couch, tumbling us both into open air. Draco gasps, his eyes scrunching closed, and I hold onto him tightly, hoping he feels safe under my hands.
“I’m not going to kiss you until I’ve earned it,” Harry amends, and Draco softens immediately, his lips parting as he exhales. “And I
Draco gives up, flopping onto his back with a  dramatic sigh. “Just fuck me, you menace.”
. If I’m hurting you. We can wait a little bit.”
“Give me a colour,” Harry says firmly. Demanding it is a compromise– the single time Draco had complained about how asking for permission ruins the feeling of saying
“You wanna be fucked, baby? I never would’ve guessed.”
like it’s as easy as breathing, like he’s never doubted it and never will. Draco never doubts his own love for Harry, but that’s why he keeps it close to his chest. It’s an honour, to hold Harry’s heart.

“It’s just weird,” Harry says very softly, and he
,” Draco repeats, firmer this time, and Harry’s eyes glint as he leans closer to Draco on the sofa. “I’m not ticklish.”
“How do you know what friendship bracelets are?” Harry asks after a while. Draco is doing something complicated with her hair, but it feels nice so Harry doesn’t complain. “I thought those were just a Muggle thing.”
“No, darling,” Harry says simply, and murmurs something that immediately makes it feel like there’s a band tight around the base of Draco’s cock. He yelps, trying to get away from the sensation, but he’s pinned by the cuffs and Harry fucking himself on Draco’s cock. In a disorienting moment Harry pushes the dildo deep into Draco and holds it there, stopping the thrust of his hips as well. “You’re going to tell me exactly what it was like to sit at a fancy gala with a plug up your arse. And
“What
“You didn’t– hurt me.” Draco presses his face into the crook of Harry’s neck. “I can turn over, if you don’t want to see.”
“They have Rose, and I didn’t want to wake her up. And I didn’t know where else to go.”
Well.
that stopped any further questioning.
“Are you cold?” Draco asks, leaning back in sudden worry. “You should’ve kept the blanket on, I completely forgot– fuck–”
“You’re supposed to be in Auror training. This isn’t–”
“It’s not. Everyone has things that make them tick.”
“That’s the truth?”
“I mean, you’re just twenty-two, Draco. I think you still deserve time to relax.”
DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY
“Me?” Harry laughs a little wildly. “
“I respect you,” he murmurs, eyes boring into yours. Breathe. Breathe. Something is cracking open in your heart.
“I– I should sleep,” Harry says in a rush, nearly tripping over her feet as she gets off the couch. There’s a small furrow in between Draco’s pale eyebrows, but Harry doesn’t dwell on it. “I’ll– I’ll see you in Potions, tomorrow.”
“Baby,” I croak, then clear my throat. “Draco. That was so fucking good.”
“I’ve never been better, Potter,” Draco retorts, but he slides his fingers in between Harry’s and holds on tight.

“You kept shifting in your seat?” Harry says, thrusting his hips forward the tiniest bit. The movement is wet and hot and
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, nodding enthusiastically. “Whoever has the most points at the end is deemed the official sexpert, then. That makes perfect sense, and ‘cause we’re friends it won’t be weird, right?”
“You’re not just talking about sleeping with him anymore, are you?”
It’s gonna be okay.
“Tease,” Harry growls before kissing Draco hard enough that Draco sees stars behind the darkness of his closed eyes. Harry presses closer and Draco let’s his hands flutter across Harry’s body, seeking  purchase that he finally finds when he wraps his fingers around the harness strap pressing into Harry’s hips. Harry grinds down, sending warmth flooding through Draco’s stomach as their cocks rub against each other.
, I hate you. Come on, then.”
ah– not gonna come, I can’t– not untouched–”
“You also looked so lonely,” Harry says softly, and Draco freezes. He thought– he thought he was doing alright, faking it, through the haze of alcohol and the glitter of club lights. Something twists in his chest and he tries to jerk away, but there’s nowhere to go, nowhere to escape to. Harry is everything, right now.
care about you. I could– I could fall for you if you gave me the chance.” Harry’s voice is rough. “I think I already am. Didn’t you feel it, in my magic? Hermione said she did.”
“Only if you want to.”
“Come on, then,” Harry says immediately, opening the door wider. With so few eighth year students, they each get their own small room, and Harry’s desperately grateful for it right now, because every nerve in her body is screaming at her to
“Breathe, love,” Harry murmurs, then presses himself on his toes to kiss Draco and every one of Draco’s racing thoughts shifts to
“Draco,” they say. “I need your help.”
,” Draco whimpers, turning his face to the side. Harry’s grip on his wrists tightens slightly and Draco bucks his hips up, gasping as Harry brushes over his prostate. “There, there, right there.” Harry keeps thrusting at that angle until Draco barely knows how to breathe; he struggles against Harry’s grip, panting
“I don’t know! I don’t know where I’m going!” I exclaim, any semblance of calm shattered, because I. Don’t. Know. My plans ended with making it off Scorpius and into space in one piece. Obviously, I regret that now, but I was desperate. I
“Why the fuck not?” Draco growls, and Harry meets his eyes in surprise.
“No!”
“What the hell?”
“No,” Draco says, immediately breaking the kiss as he shoves Harry away, panic stamped across his features. “No, no. No. You don't get to– no. I’m not giving
“Uh-huh,” he pants, gazing up at me with bright eyes. I’m barely touching him, my fingers teasing under the band of his boxers, but he writhes between my thighs. I grind down against him, gasping at the hardness of his cock through the fabric of his pants. My pants, actually.
“Oh, darling. We don’t have much longer. And…” Draco trails off as an idea hits. “And I know you can be
“Know what else we do with our bodies?” Draco asks. Harry moves closer in anticipation, and Draco’s lips quirk up. “This!” he yells, shuffling his feet again as he launches himself toward Harry, and Harry goes down with a yelp as he gets shocked by Draco’s mouth on his own. They hit the floor in a tangle of limbs, Draco giggling madly. “It works with kissing,” Draco exclaims in delight.
good for me,” Harry says, letting disappointment seep into his tone. “I have no choice but to tie you up now.”
to you.”
“Harry,” Draco sighs when he opens the door. “I don’t want to know how you got my address.”
Harry sighs, soft and sad. He doesn’t say anything for a while, long enough that Draco is about to open his mouth when Harry speaks again. “It’s been very lonely.”
“Yes.” Harry doesn’t know what else to say; his feelings are too vast to be shoved into words.
“Trust me, baby. I’m gonna make you feel so good.” Harry’s fingertips trail down Draco’s stomach as his voice moves further away. There’s a small shift in the mattress and every nerve in Draco’s body strains to ascertain where Harry is. The only contact he has is Harry’s fingers, now curled up in the wispy hair at the base of Draco’s cock.
“You want me, too?” Harry finally asks, his voice smaller than he intends, and Draco nods frantically.
“Can I heal you now?” Harry asks, and Draco’s smile turns wry.
pants?
“Only if you don’t,” I reply, the words coming out thick with exhaustion. Harry laughs quietly and turns to face me– I can feel the bed shift.
Draco nods, still dazed, but when Harry disappears around the doorway panic spikes through Draco’s chest. He casts a half-hearted wandless cleaning spell, grimacing at the residue of his own come on his stomach. Despite the fact that his legs are frightfully wobbly he slides off the bed, grabbing his top. As he searches for his trousers, Harry comes back into the room with a flannel in his hand. When he sees Draco, he freezes.
Dares are irresistible– Draco lunges. When their hands meet, that’s a flash of sparks that crackle electric through Harry’s arm. Draco yelps, but he’s grinning, eyes dancing as he looks at Harry.
“I didn’t forget,” he whispers, and you realize he’s begging. For your forgiveness, even though
, so wet. He tastes
“Do you want to know what she meant by that?” Harry’s fingers slide away from Draco’s, and his meaning clicks. They shouldn’t– they definitely shouldn’t– but neither of them can resist pushing boundaries when it comes to their curiosity. Another reason they make a good team.
“Well now that I know you have the
Harry presses an exploratory kiss to Harry’s bicep. “And then?”
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice is frantic, her hand wrapped around his shoulder. He can feel the pressure from each of her fingertips. “I just got Draco to St. Mungo’s. I’m going to bring you there now.”
Draco bounces on Harry’s cock, their shoulders pulled back proud and taut due to the cuffs. They flip their head again, then again, scowling as locks of hair continue to fall around their shoulders.
Rage.
“Green,” Draco says immediately. Harry grabs onto his hair again, hard enough that Draco gasps, and thrusts in again. Soon Draco is whimpering on every rock of Harry’s hips, tossing his head side to side.
It’s 5:16 pm on a Tuesday. You’re staring at yourself across the small living room of your musty flat.
“Easy, baby,” Harry murmurs, sitting up in order to place his free hand flat on my stomach, holding me down. “Easy. You want another finger?”
Harry stares at him, shocked and unblinking.
Harry knocks with trepidation.
“Nah, I’ll get up,” Harry replies. There’s a dramatic
“Don’t wanna,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s jaw, his breath warm. “God, I want you, I love you. Baby.” Draco shivers as Harry’s lips ghost further down and nuzzle underneath the collar of Draco’s jumper. “Baby, baby, let me–”
“Occupational hazards. Could we watch something?”
“I would say we don’t have to,” Harry says with a sigh. “Except that we do. I’m sorry.”
“ Draco complies, swirling his tongue over the tip of Harry’s cock before taking him all the way down again, hollowing out his cheeks. Harry writhes above him. “Draco, I love you I love you I love you oh

“Have I told you that you look like a ghost in your nightgown?” Harry asks sleepily, making a small discontent sound when Draco cranes her head around.
“That’s not the truth,” Harry repeats, firmer. “Am I right?”
“Harry–”
Draco tilts his head in pleasure. When they first started exploring this, Harry had struggled a bit,  too harsh and too exacting, until Draco told him
“Draco,” Harry murmurs, then louder: “Hedwig, lights to zero.”
“Please,” Harry whispers, and Draco nods, rising halfway up Harry’s cock before they drop back down.
“It wasn’t planned,” he murmurs, his voice suddenly low and warm, and he sneaks a hand under my shirt, tracing light patterns across the skin of my waist. “You’re kinda irresistible.”
requested by thecornerofbelu!
” Draco shouts as the bed shifts violently. Before he even has a second to brace himself Harry sinks down onto his cock, warm and wet. The slick tip of Harry’s cock brushes against Draco’s skin, and Draco has the wild urge to taste him, to lick every bit of Harry’s arousal down his throat. “Christ, Harry, how are you so wet– fuck– fucking
Harry grunts as Draco gets his free hand around Harry’s ribs, grabbing onto Harry’s shirt and attempting to shove him away. In retaliation Harry grips his wrist tight enough to bruise, twisting Draco’s arm until he yelps and stops squirming. While Draco is taller, and could match Harry in terms of strength, he always gives into Harry so beautifully when they play.
“I thought you meant, like, dusting,” Draco replies around a mouthful of eggs. It’s rude, but he needs to leave soon. He places a hand in front of his mouth. “Not cooking all the meals.”

“If I recall that night correctly, I mean. Which, seeing as I finally thought I had a chance at something
“No,” Draco says.
“I just wanted to give you time and to be– be gentle with you,” Harry says.
“Hey,” Draco repeats wryly, “fancy meeting you here.”
come back to, because you can’t have a discussion like an adult?” As he talks Harry strides closer and Draco scrambles back, the color draining from his face. There are dark smudges under his eyes, and all the fight drains out of Harry immediately.
He can’t answer, with his mouth around my cock doing things that make me see stars, but when I look down our eyes meet. His are glinting silver, heavy with want, and I don’t know how long I can last like this, when my cock is already aching from the friction of the strap-on and watching Draco fall apart underneath me.
I don’t know how long I keep my eyes closed, but all I know is Harry. Harry, Harry, Harry. Warm hands on my arms and laughter and weightlessness.
“There you are. You know how to beg for it.” Harry lifts up onto an elbow and reaches for the bottle of lube, pouring a frankly obscene amount over his fingers before sliding his hand around the length of his dick. His knuckles brush across Draco’s cock and Draco whines, bucking his hips up. “Shh,” Harry soothes, wrapping his slick hand around Draco’s cock but not moving it. “Tell me how you want it.”
Harry catches on quickly to what makes Draco tick, smirking as he makes Draco come untouched with one finger and the word
“What?” Harry asks when Draco doesn’t finish.
“Keep talking.”
“Mmm.” Harry kisses down Draco’s neck, sucking lightly until Draco squirms. “Big talk.”
about you. What you need is to take care of yourself and let your friends into your life and let me–” Draco pauses, trying to find the words for his terrifyingly big feelings. “I want to be here. For you. And you need to
“Perhaps,” Draco finally concedes. “You’re sure you want…?”
Harry pouts. “Is that how you treat your favorite roommate?”
I laugh, placing my hands flat on his chest as I bend over him. “You cheeky arsehole. My
“I can see you,” Harry says, too happy for someone who has been magically blinded for hours. Draco slumps down at the end of the couch, dropping his head into his hands, the adrenaline finally wearing off. “Are you okay?” Harry asks, and the couch shifts as he moves closer.
Harry is warm beside him, their shoulders a respectable distance apart but their hands pressed together across the expanse of sheets. Draco hates sleeping on his back, he’s too aware of the sharpness of his body and the aches of each day low in his spine, but he can’t turn away from Harry without letting go, and he can’t turn toward Harry without possibly seeing his profile and doing something very unprofessional in a fit of reduced inhibition brought about by Harry’s gentle breath, by how rumpled he looked in plaid pajama bottoms as they slid under the covers earlier.
He’s probably
HARRY
“You had a nightmare, I think, and rolled away from me. You’re alright now, though. I’ve got you.”
Stretching out again, Harry checks the time with his wand and sighs in contentment; it’s Sunday, and  they have an unspoken agreement that on Sundays they have a lie-in and then drink coffee together while watching Muggle kids cartoons that make Draco adorably confused. As Harry stretches his foot pokes a warm lump on the end of his bed and he hears an agitated little chirp, snorting as he lifts his head to look at the vague Pepper-colored blob on the end of his bed. She stretches and rolls over as Harry flops back onto the pillow. He has time to roll over and go back to sleep too, and he nearly does before he catches the smell of bacon wafting from down the hall. He sits up, rubbing his eyes from a moment and absentmindedly patting Pepper’s head before shoving on his glasses and padding down the hall. He finds Draco in the kitchen, concentrating very hard on flipping bacon in a sizzling pan.
Draco nods. “Yes, it was– better than okay. Very much so.”
“Harry?” Draco whispers when Harry stays silent.
“My stars,” he yells, pushing his long hair back from his face, eyes wide, and I’m fucked. “Hello.”
“I know.” Draco’s voice is very small.
“You mean I spent seven years in an unrequited rivalry? What a waste of energy.” There’s a strange lilt to Malfoy’s voice, and Harry realizes she’s
“This is a strange game,” Dean says with a grin, and Seamus giggles against his shoulder.
“Oh my god,” Harry breathes, burying his fingers into Draco’s soft hair. “Oh my

“It feels good,” Draco finishes when Harry trails off. “You deserve to feel good, Harry.”
like him– ah, fuck, Pepper, I like him so much.”
. I unfold my body gingerly, wincing as Harry’s dick slides out. He presses a kiss to my shoulder before slipping off the bed and I watch him go, still dazed. The harness straps cup his arse beautifully and I stare until he’s out of sight. After a few moments he comes back in, holding a cup of water and a flannel that he uses to wipe my stomach, then his own. His dick flops between his legs and I snort, wrapping my hand around it to pull him towards me.
Draco steps forward a bit, his hands still outstretched. “Don’t say that to him–”
“Y-yeah.” Harry can’t stop staring down at Draco, and he blinks hard. “I just–”
Harry is frozen in disbelief, uncomprehending of Draco’s lips on hers, and it’s only when Draco starts to pull away that Harry realizes what’s happening and shoves her hands into Draco’s hair, chasing her mouth until they’re kissing again. Every line of Draco’s body is sharp but her lips are so impossibly soft, moving tentatively against Harry’s, and Harry never wants this to end. She wants to kiss Draco every second for the rest of her life, because Draco is making the tiniest noises, and her hair is incredibly soft, and she tastes like strawberries. Eventually Draco pulls away but doesn’t go far, panting against Harry’s slack mouth.
“Oh.” Rejection shouldn’t hurt this much, but Harry’s heartbeat is in his fingers. “No, I get it, I just thought since we talked at work you’d maybe… It's okay. Really.” Harry laughs a bit, waving his hand easily, looking anywhere but Draco.
“I don’t know.” Draco sniffs, trying not to sound pitiful. “You left. You– you always hold me afterwards.”
Draco recalls the moment perfectly– three and a half weeks ago, blindsided by Harry’s question, knowing he isn’t good enough for the offer, knowing he’ll give his affection away if he doesn’t have work or other people as a shield. He recalls panicking, throwing up every wall he has. His own mouth wrapped around the words
“Harry.” Hermione’s eyes are wide, her croissant halted halfway to her mouth. “You know you’re not supposed to use it–”
“Yep.”
“Was that good for you?” Draco asks, and I roll over just enough to see his flushed lips and shining, slick chin. His voice is sweet and open, and I realize he’s genuinely asking.
, they sit together now. They’re friends, kind of sort of, except Harry wants to
“I shouldn’t have done that–”
Draco turns her head sharply to the side, then lowers herself to burrow against Harry’s neck again. “Not like you. I’m all– pointy.”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco replies, turning the ignition over. As he glances over his shoulder to back out of the lot, he holds a hand out absentmindedly, and Harry takes it.
. I lower myself the smallest amount and he wraps his lips around the head of my cock, causing me to bend nearly in half at the waist and slam my palms into the wall to keep myself upright. “Fuck.”
. Harry snorts, and is rewarded with the barest hint of a smile from Malfoy.
“You’re not a bother,” he says, elbowing Harry towards the wall. He slides under the covers, immediately overwhelmed by the scent of
“I don’t think Draco’s enjoying it very much,” Harry says plainly, but Joshua just grins, jostling Draco with the arm slung over his shoulder.
worth it.”
Harry’s voice is soft behind him. “You can change anything you want, I just–”
“It’s just–” Draco starts, trying to parse through his thoughts.
“Yes. I’m– I’m? Yes. You’re sure…?”
“Please what?” Harry asks, his gaze never leaving Draco’s even as he takes his hand off of Draco’s cock and slides it further down. As his fingers trace a path down Draco’s perineum, Draco digs his own into Harry’s biceps.
. Oh.
“Hedwig, what quadrant are we in?”
Draco tsks, flipping their hair over their shoulder as it falls into their face. “You know just one won’t do it.”
“What are you doing?”
“This whole time I told myself it was the bond but it was just
“Who the fuck did this to you?” he asks, low in his throat. Draco flinches back into the couch cushion, finally turning to Harry with wide eyes, and Harry forces himself to take a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you. Draco, I just…” Harry reaches out to touch the skin of Draco’s cheek, right under the bruise. Draco makes a soft whining sound but doesn’t pull away. “Please.”
. He doesn't get to keep being called
“I’m warm now,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s neck, his voice easy and slow. He’s tucked along Draco’s side, both of them clean thanks to a wave of Harry’s hand. “You always keep me warm.”
But this book is more than just
to you?” Draco asks softly, reaching for his strongest burn potion. The injuries are shallow, but a deep angry red, and track in strange swirling patterns all the way up past Harry’s elbows on both arms. Upon closer inspection Draco realizes the burn patterns are mirror images of each other; he’s never seen anything like it. He isn’t in Curse Damage, but he works the Emergency ward and feels like he’s seen rather a lot at this point.
“You know what I mean,” Draco repeats, not understanding, and Harry moves away until he can look directly in Draco’s red rimmed eyes while still holding onto him.
“Harry,” Draco says, strained, and then he bursts into laughter. “You’re ridiculous. That was so dramatic.”
“I think you’re underestimating me,” Harry replies with a grin, kissing down the planes of Draco’s stomach until Draco is squirming underneath him.
“I know,” Draco says quietly, his voice tender. “Harry. I know.”
“We’ll have to figure out work–”
“I know how to handle myself
. You’re incorrigible.”
“Willowy.” I echo flatly. Is that a compliment?
“Yes?”
“We bonded through nightmares and insomnia.” Harry presses her forehead hard against Draco’s. “We’ll be alright. Turn around, I’d want to hold you.”
“Together.”
Draco was a goner.
Right.
Draco blinks up at Harry, dazed, and Harry smooths a hand over his sweaty hairline. Harry’s breath comes in harsh pants as he presses his lips to Draco’s shoulder, bringing Draco down from his trembling.
“Mhm.” Harry stays still as Draco’s hand slips underneath the hem of her shirt. Her fingers trace a path along Harry’s stomach, digging into the fat at her hip.
“It’s not the bond?”
Draco nods slowly, his eyes widening. “Yes. Yes, that would make sense. But how would we get objective feedback? Neither of us are in relationships, so we
“I’m not going to heal you the next time you come to me,” Draco says, but they both know it's a lie, and Draco adds Harry to his Floo network after he leaves that night.
calling me angel.”
“Alright,” Draco breathes, but Harry’s lips are still a surprise– a revelation. The kiss is soft and rather tentative, different from Draco’s panic-induced intensity before, but it’s better, somehow. It’s better with Harry’s palms resting in the back of Draco’s neck, with the blanket around them and warmth in the press of their chests.
Draco deliberately takes a hand from behind his back, holding up one finger.
“Well,” Harry says, more subdued. Draco tries to meet his eyes in the mirror, but Harry looks away. “Ready for bed, then?”
Harry snorts, wriggling around until he’s peering blurrily at Draco. His face is flushed, from sex or happiness– Draco can’t tell. Perhaps both.
“It’ll be over soon anyways,” Harry says when they break apart. His breath dances warm across Draco’s cheek. “We’ll be graduated and no one can bother us.”
“I’m not
“Harry Potter,” I say, dipping my voice low as I nuzzle his throat. “I think I
“I will–”
“Just– just go ahead and– please.”
“We have to decide who the sexpert is.”
“Didn’t wanna wake you.”
Ginny taps her bottom lip. “Let’s go with the most general knowledge. I honestly do not even wanna think about what having sex with some of you is like.”
. His pale eye nearly glows in the dim light, the other blazing green; the rapt attention of both at once is almost too much to handle. “May I?” he asks, tugging at the hem of my shirt, and I’m nodding before he even finishes asking. “Gonna make you feel so good,” he murmurs, tracing his fingers across the plane of my stomach, and I shiver, because if there’s anything I’ve learned about Harry it’s that he keeps his word.
“I love you too, baby. So much.”
“You like this,” Harry says sweetly into Draco’s ear. The chain clinks as he wraps the end around his palm and buries his hand into Draco’s hair, pulling his head up off the sheets.
“You were so good, baby.” Another kiss, to Draco’s cheek this time. His head lolls a bit against Harry’s shoulder. “You
, and I don’t want him to think I am. I’m just much better at navigating politics and abstract mathematics than keeping myself alive in space. Harry picks up a booted foot and rests it on the edge of the console in front of him, his trousers pulling tight around his solid thighs. He keeps his eyes on me as he answers.
“You’re funny,” Harry interrupts. “You’re so smart, I saw it that first week. You do your best to be kind to other people, even me, even when I drove you absolutely mad. You have such lovely hands,” Harry continues, brushing away Draco’s tears with his thumb. “I feel like I could watch you do anything and be absolutely content. I want to know what kind of movies you like. I want… I just want it all.”
“Harry,” he repeats. There’s a shuffling sound behind the door, but no response. “Come on. I– I don’t understand why you’re upset, but I would like to. I won’t come in there unless you ask me to, okay? I’ll just… be here.” Draco sinks to the floor, leaning back against the bathroom door. His body aches in a way that’s usually nice after sex, when Harry is there to hold him and press ticklish kisses down his arms, but in the chill air of the hallway it just makes him feel very alone.
“Okay.” Draco lets himself be pulled against Harry’s chest, held tight in the warmth. Harry is still naked, his soft cock pressed to Draco’s pants-clad hip, and it feels more intimate than sex. “What now?”
“The bond,” he says when they break apart. “I think it’s–” Before he can finish the thought Draco’s eyes go wide and he bolts out the passenger door, whooping under the wide blue sky as he stumbles through the grass alongside the road. He gets further and further from Harry, but there’s no pull on Harry’s wrist, no itching under his skin– only warmth in his chest. Draco’s uncharacteristically expressive joy is so bright, Harry can’t do anything but stand by the car and watch until Draco wheels around with his arms open wide. No longer a compulsion, but an invitation.
“Good boy.” Harry reaches out to hold Draco’s hips, then his waist. “Turn around for me.” Draco does, keeping still as the belt in Harry’s hands jangles and warm leather is wrapped around Draco’s wrists. Harry softly murmurs to him the whole time, telling him this is just to keep his wrists together and not to pull, because it will chafe, and he knows that Draco can be good for him. He turns Draco back around with a gentle push to his hips. “Kneel. There you go, pet. Good. You look so pretty like this.”
“Hm. You take me out for coffee?”
“You’re not allowed to die,” Draco repeats, quieter. He slides his hands up into his hair, pulling the hair tie out of his messy ponytail and letting his blonde waves fall around his shoulders. It’s uncomfortably quiet, so he gathers his hair back up into a neater ponytail just for something to do with his hands.
“Okay, baby,” Harry says, immediately sitting fully on Draco’s cock and stilling. “Tell me what you need.”
“But hey,” Harry says, too casual, his eyes finally bright but in all the wrong ways. “If you’re saying we're not friends, then who am I to argue? You didn’t stick around last time to hear me out, so I doubt you will now.”
It’s the first thing Harry thinks when he wakes up now, stretching out on the bed before rolling onto his side, unable to stop his grin.
“I think that will be no competition at all,” he says primly, then yelps as Harry flips him back onto the bed.
“Because my answer is
“I have to go.”

“I have an idea.”
Obviously he’s attractive– I knew that the moment I saw him, with his long legs and slim waist and brightly intelligent eyes. One night stands are familiar territory, when I have the whole galaxy to explore, but I told myself he’s off limits since he’s relying on me right now, and that wouldn’t be fair. Physical attraction, I can handle. I can push it down and interact with Draco normally, even though sometimes he glances at me with a searching, unreadable expression.
“I didn’t see. I didn’t see– I couldn’t look at you.”
,” Harry laughs, kissing Draco’s forehead. “Yes, Draco. Yes. It’ll be worth it, though. Yeah?”
“Please,” I manage to say, my voice cracking down the middle, but I’m too gone to care. I need Harry inside me, on top of me, around me. He’s staring me down like I’m the only thing in the universe, his mouth twisted in concentration as he slips a second finger inside, and I try to keep my eyes open to hold his gaze. Hungry. He looks hungry.
Harry laughs so hard he bends over the console. “No they don’t.”

“You’re doing so good, pet, look at you.” Harry’s breath catches and he leans down to kiss my chest, slowly dragging his teeth over my nipple. I can barely even think between the praise and the feeling of his mouth hot on my skin. He teases my hole with three fingertips, and when  he raises his eyebrows I nod and reach out to cup his face in my hands.
“You want lube, baby? You want to rub up against me?”

anymore. But Harry is his friend, and his roommate of less than two days. He needs to try harder not to be so gruff.
“No,” Harry replies, staring into Draco’s eyes as he grabs Draco’s wrist, guiding his hand down to the edge of his red jumper. “No, I’m not cold.”
“I’m so sorry,” Harry says for what must be the tenth time. “I– I didn’t mean to make it get so tense so quickly, but he wasn’t taking your comfort seriously and then said he could
“Oh,” she gasps, catching sight of Draco still sleeping under a blanket of golden sun, and Harry’s feet stop moving. Draco looks — terrible. There are deep purple circles under his eyes and his cheeks are gaunt, nearly skeletal. At Hermione’s outburst Draco startles awake, sitting up and blinking at them blearily before sighing.
“Yeah, I just– I have a surprise for you.” Harry’s eyes dart towards the hallway and back to Draco’s face. “I hope it’s– I hope it’s good? I hope you’ll like it.”
“Okay,” Harry says, and wandlessly Vanishes the cuffs back to the drawer. Draco goes boneless, so Harry helps him move his arms to a comfortable position on the bed.  “Anything else you need?”
“Come
“I had another nightmare,” Harry whispers, and Draco slings his arm across Harry’s warm waist and sinks back into sleep.
“A story?” Draco asks, pressing closer to Harry. She’s all silk and bare leg, and Harry can feel the slight swell of Draco’s breasts against her torso, but she resolutely ignores it, knowing that Draco is surely getting much more of that on her end and just politely not saying anything about it.
“You’ve done very well.” Harry looks at Draco for a moment, then leans down to press a kiss to his forehead. “Can you give me a colour first?”
“Yes, I do.” Theoretically, which I’m learning means nothing when I’m actually in space.
“We should get more water. And probably shower.”
“I’m not going to die,” Harry says, and Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s again. They stumble to the couch between kisses, Harry’s thighs finding their way to either side of Draco’s waist as Draco kisses down Harry’s neck to his exposed collarbone. Harry gasps, then squirms. “I’m here, I’m not going anywhere.”
The carpet is soft on Draco’s knees. At his back, the belt isn’t too tight– both of them know it’s not suited for more than a simple reminder. Harry had never told Draco to stop looking, so he watches as Harry yanks off his jumper, then stands right above Draco to slide his jeans and pants off. They crumple to a heap on the floor and Harry kicks them away before sitting back down. Later, when Draco is clean and warm and held, he’ll complain about it, but now he turns his gaze to the confident spread of Harry’s legs. The firelight crackles warm across the curved scars on Harry’s chest, the soft hair on his stomach, and lower– lower.
It’s discrete, a charm he crafted during the war with too much time on his hands and too much paranoia. He checks his wand on his work breaks for a week, writing down the coordinates in his small journal then placing dots on a map when he gets home. There’s no pattern to Harry’s movements, but they’re much more widespread than Draco expected– Harry moves all across England over the span of the week, in seemingly random locations, often nowhere near a town. At first, Draco feels guilty for tracking Harry like this– it’s an invasion of privacy that Draco is all too aware of. Yet he has no choice, really, since Harry still won’t tell him anything and he doesn’t want Harry to die in his flat one day.
“Harry,” Draco says, stern to hide his horror. “
“Shut up, shut up.” Draco wriggles, rather lightheaded from the solid strength of Harry’s forearm wedged between his back and the mattress. “Shut up.”
“Oh,” Draco whispers. A small part of him wants to turn to the side, to see how Harry is taking this news, but his self-preservation wins out and he stares straight ahead, tracing his gaze down a fine crack in the plaster of the opposite wall. “That seems rather…”
“I don’t expect you to like me
The motel receptionist looks at Draco wearily, then over at Harry. She shrugs, typing something into her computer. “Double beds?”
on the telly and a mug of tea in my hand, and you always hug me back even when I knock my elbows into your ribs, and–” Draco’s torrent of babbling is cut off as Harry presses his mouth to Draco’s, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist to pull him against Harry’s body. It’s all crashing down on Harry, the way he takes care of Draco, the way he
Oh, I don’t stand a chance.
“Bonded like your magical cores are tied together.” The Mediwitch– Lila, her name badge says– doesn’t even look up at them, as though this is a commonplace problem, and Draco lets the tiniest flame of hope flicker in his chest. “We’ve never seen anything like this particular bond, so all we can do is mitigate the effects until our Bond Specialists can determine a way to undo it,” she continues, and Draco blanches.
Draco nods frantically, taking a shaky breath in. He knows how much it turns Harry on when he’s reduced to incoherency, and he loves this, being able to sink into Harry’s confidence. He starts speaking again, his voice trembling faintly. “I was talking to someone, I don’t remember his name, he was certainly rich. And we were sitting– sitting– ah.” There’s an audible smack the same moment Harry pulls out the plug entirely, and Draco writhes as much as he’s able, trying to figure out the source of the sound and pushing down the bereft sensation of emptiness. “We were sitting at our assigned table, and I kept shifting in my seat, because I was trying to get comfortable. And–
“I know, Potter.”
, it’s all mine. To fuck and fill and use.”
“So…” Emily starts, and Harry stands up.
“Just your chest, now. Stretch out your arms for me, love.”
“Well…” he licks his lips, and I reach down, pressing my thumb to his bottom lip, marveling at its softness. He smiles, a crooked thing. “I like being– taken care of. Not having to lead. To be …” he flushes, pink spreading from his cheeks to his neck. “I’d rather like to be fucked.” His voice is prim around the word and heat thrums sharp in my groin.
“Can we get food?” he asks as they step through the Floo into his living room, their hands clasped tightly between them. According to Lila, they’re lucky there’s no emotional compulsion to the bond, or a physical compulsion for anything more than touching each other. Draco shudders briefly at the thought of Harry above him, unwilling but brave, trying his best not to show his reluctance at moving any further beyond tolerant friendship with Draco–
“You basically did.”
Ice cold.
, fuck, you take my cock so well–”
“Let me have this
“Yeah, okay,” Harry says, but he’s flushed deep red and trying not to smile. He plants a wet kiss on Draco’s forehead and laughs as Draco makes a face before tilting his head in invitation.
Harry slowly shreds his paper napkin as Emily stares at him.
“Draco–”
“Hours.” Draco gasps as Harry thrusts in again, picking up a rhythm. “Oh, fuck–
“You’re–” Draco’s words stick in his throat, and he closes his eyes against the sight of Harry’s earnest face. “God, Harry. Merlin. God. I hate you.”
“Want anything to drink?” Draco asks, startling Harry out of his thoughts. Harry turns to see Draco frowning down into the open fridge, one hand on his hip.
, Harry wants to say, but that isn’t even true. They’re
“I don’t need the universe telling me you’re it for me.
“Well?” Draco asks softly, not looking at Harry. His cheeks are flushed a deep pink and Harry isn’t much better off, heat coursing through him. Shifting on the bed, Draco wraps a hand around Harry’s hip. “Are you going to move?”
And so on.
Draco rolls his hips, and Harry sees stars.
The plan was
Which is how he ended up here, this minute, on Harry’s surprisingly soft sheets, with a Sobering Potion down his throat and Harry’s slick finger working its way methodically into his arse.
serious.”
“Don’t be late,” Harry replies with a grin of his own, and Draco rushes out of the door. The tea stays warm all the way through his first meeting, but Draco doesn’t have the time to wonder how Harry knew exactly how much milk to put in.
“Oh, you’re wanted, alright,” I say, moving away so I can waggle my eyebrows at him until he hits my shoulder, unable to stop his smile. “In all seriousness, we may run into trouble. But nothing Hedwig and I can’t handle, especially once you get that brilliant brain of yours up to speed on starship handling.” He preens at that before tucking himself back into my neck. When he speaks, his voice is muffled, buzzing into my skin.
“Oh,” Harry breathes, a heartbroken exhale. “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m here now, alright? I’m sorry I panicked, I just didn’t want to– it feels
“I’m– I’m overwhelmed, I don’t know, please– I…”
The dim Eighth Year common room comes into view as Draco rubs away the grittiness of his eyes. Harry’s right in front of him, blinking owlishly behind his glasses.
“Fuck–” Harry’s hand strokes Draco’s cock languidly, too loose to be any relief, and Draco turns his eyes to Harry, feeling frantic. “Harry, please.”
On accident, I sniff pitifully, and Harry turns to look up at me.

“Yes,” Draco says, his voice rasping. “Yes, Harry, let me– yes, anything–”
The night spills inky around the wavering headlights of Harry’s car. In the passenger seat, Draco sighs in his sleep, his head lolling against the seat as the road curves. Harry glances at him, bundled up in an old jumper of Harry’s and plaid pajama pants, his feet pale and knobbly where they’re tucked up on the seat. Harry leaves a hand on the steering wheel and reaches out with his other, lightly cupping Draco’s cheek.
“We have the whole universe before us, anyways.”
As Potter looks ahead once more I take the time to study him. The moment  I’d stepped on his ship earlier I’d nearly fallen on my face; any attraction I’ve felt to men before now is laughable in the face of Potter. He’s short, much shorter than me, but clearly sturdy; his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and his forearms flex as his fingers fly across the console. The white shirt he’s wearing is half unbuttoned, showing off flashes of a dark chest scattered with black hair and two curving pinkish scars, and he’s wearing leather suspenders.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry says, finally blinking his eyes open, his long lashes sticking together in the corners. As he sits up Draco walks back into the bedroom, grabbing the oversized red jumper that Harry loves. Harry ambles in through the doorway, stumbling a bit and heading straight for the bed.
.” Now Harry is the one whose words trip over each other. “It was just your hand in mine even when it didn’t have to be.” The sun is beating hot through the windshield, painting Draco radiant as he stares unmoving at Harry. “I planned to end my trip in California.”
it, but I can’t stop. There’s too much shoved down in my mind that’s spilling out now: my parent’s conditional love, my betrothal (surely broken now), the weight of wearing an emotional mask day in and day out. Harry is a warmth next to me, his hand soothing on my back, and embarrassment prickles under my skin.
and a thump before Pepper comes pattering down the hall, disappearing into Harry’s room. Draco can hear Harry still shuffling around in the living room, probably tidying after the whirlwind that is Draco coming in from work. “It’s good for me to be up and moving anyways.”
“But you’re beautiful,” Harry replies, his brow furrowing in the middle. It’s not as though he hasn’t said it before, but it’s usually when he’s buried deep inside Draco, and the words feel different, now. More breakable. Draco doesn’t reply, just keeps hiccuping little sobs, and eventually Harry presses a kiss to the cheek not covered by his hand. “Hey.”
“Inconvenient?” Lila supplies, and Draco nods. Behind him, Harry shifts, then exhales.
“You’re so gorgeous,” Harry murmurs, his voice dripping with arousal. “So fucking good for me. You want my dick? You wanna be fucked, baby?” I open my eyes and he’s there above me, holding himself up on one forearm and slicking his free hand over his dick. “Do you think you’re ready?”
“I want you,” Draco whispers, so quietly Harry almost doesn’t hear him. Harry sighs and presses his body back down over Draco’s, running a free hand down his upper arm, ignoring the confession that crowds up into his throat. Draco can’t mean it like Harry wants him to.
