"Does no one want to volunteer?" Professor Opacre asked, raising an eyebrow. At the continued avoidant behavior, she raised her hand and from the podium the class roll lifted up and floated towards her. "I suppose that means I'll have to start randomly choosing students then..."
Draco took that final step closer and Harry inhaled sharply as he felt the other teenager place a careful hand on his hip, his warm fingers on the edge of his shirt, almost touching his skin.  His heart beat rapidly and he tilted his head back slightly to look into Draco’s steady gaze.  He couldn’t help but lick his lips lightly, watching as Draco’s eyes flickered down momentarily before focusing on his eyes.
“I am confidant you are doing everything you can to make sure Mr. Potter is well-protected,” Dumbledore continued as if he did not hear Fudge’s gaffe.  “And you well know everyone involved has consented to the Binding Spell to prevent any leak to the press.”
“So much trouble for such a dismal looking boy,” the vampire said curiously, eyeing him with obvious disdain.  “You hardly seem worth the effort to keep alive.”  He snorted and started walking towards him.  “Why - ”
“Bastard,” Ron growled out, looking hatefully at the blonde’s back.  “I swear to God, he gets more and more annoying every year.”
“Because he wants to see how I’ve been doing my work and he would like to learn more about wizards,” the vampire said evenly.  Her eyes narrowed slightly.  “While we’re on the matter of my brother, I feel compelled to tell you how you two should behave while he’s here.  I’ll be having a few words with him as well, as soon as he arrives,” she added, seeing Malfoy open his mouth angrily.  The blond closed it, his mouth tightening.
“Moony, what the hell,” Sirius said hoarsely as they stood in the hallway, watching Snape go down one corridor and Marylin waiting for them at the end of another.  “What the hell is going on?”
“Potions suck,” Harry responded immediately and her lips twitched into a brief smile as she made another note.
" - on your sixth life with only three more to go!" The other twin finished, grinning as he took a drink.
He was quiet for a moment and then glanced over at her.  “Sort of,” he said slowly.  “There’s still…a few other things.”
"By now, I'm sure you're all aware of the rumors that vampires have allied with Voldemort," she said suddenly and Harry stiffened as the class shook from the blunt statement and broke out in worried and nervous whispers and flinches. Professor Opacre continued, voice unusually serious, her eyes looking upon them unflinchingly. "Well...it's true."
Nobody clapped as soon as Dumbledore finished speaking but the tension that had emitted from the students was less.  The soothing words of their Headmaster had obviously calmed their fears for their moments and now the students eased more into their chairs and looked at their Headmaster in relief and gratitude.  Dumbledore smiled at them and even Harry, for a moment, felt the heaviness that seemed to follow him everywhere, ease slightly.
“He also said Dazain, Severus,” Dumbledore said sternly, looking warningly at the man glaring coldly at the DADA teacher. “And I know of the bad blood history between the Opacres and Dazains so I’m not concerned with any duplicity.” Snape’s lip curled but he refrained from saying any more. The two Opacres stayed silent as well but a flicker of surprise went through their eyes at the extent of Dumbledore’s knowledge of them and the Dazains.
Hermione shrugged and Harry stared at her as she actually seemed to blush more. “Professor Opacre apparently set up some sort of arrangement with Madam Rosmerta, as a sort of break before the exams.”  And here she frowned, looking more like her usual self than an awkward version.  “Though, really, they should start studying now if they really want to - ”
Just as Harry rethought his decision to stay, Professor Opacre’s cheery voice came towards him.  “What’s up, Harry?”
“If it helps, he also thought of kidnapping you,” Sirius offered.  Remus threw him an exasperated look.
“Good, yer all ‘ere,” Hagrid said, beaming around at their class.  “Got a special treat for yer all today.  Thought might do a project with it fer the firs’ quarter.  Come on, somethin’ real good.”  He turned and began walking towards the Forbidden Forest, the apprehensive class following reluctantly.
Ron snickered as he followed Harry out of the Gryffindor Tower and to the pitch.  On the inside, he was thinking.  ‘
“Well, that’s good, I guess,” Ron said, slightly relieved but still looking concernedly at his friend.  Harry was silent, his back turned to the Weasley boy and Ron sighed.  “You haven’t answered my question of why you’re so tired.”
As Ron eyed the school’s nurse warily, Hermione asked in a half-anxious, half-disbelieving tone of voice, “But why?”
Lest stood at the window and watched the cloaked figure walk up to the gates of Hogwarts, watched as Smethwyck scurried out to meet and guide her up the path into the castle.  His fingers clenched against the windowsill as he wanted to snarl, to scream, to demand answers.
“You made me get up. The least you can do is make sure I don’t sneak off to go sleep somewhere else,” Harry grinned, his green eyes seemingly dancing slightly with laughter but he saw right through that.  Ron looked with a slightly bitter gaze behind the forced cheerfulness, at the tired and dull emotions behind the façade.
The youngest Weasley male walked over to Harry’s trunk, opened it, and immediately began to rummage for the parchment he knew the other boy always kept at the bottom.
“Help yourself,” he offered, reaching for the bag and rummaging for a sweet. Ron looked blankly at him and Hermione blushed slightly. He lifted up a lollipop and raised a questioning eyebrow. “Do you mind?”
"Does that mean he outranks you?" Dean asked curiously, barely remembering to raise his hand halfway through his question. When Professor Opacre turned confused eyes towards him, he elaborated. "I mean, is a rose quartz stronger than a tiger eye?"
“Lest!” Dumbledore said sharply and Remus breathed in deeply, forcing himself to lower his wand, concentrating on the rumble of power in the Headmaster’s voice and the smell of it in the air.  “I would advise you to think on these actions.  Think of how they will affect Harry if nothing else.”
“Harry!” he heard an old voice boom and he gritted his teeth and ignored it because that was not his name, not anymore.
In the back of his mind, untouched by the fever, he found comfort beyond that of the cooling charm as he rested with the other, two nestled perfectly together, wordless. A soft, gentle touch from a sleeping source, exhausted like him. Sharing sleep. Pain. Comfort.
Myn stood, fearful, her eyes wide as she tried to think of what to do, what she could do, what was safe and best to protect this dear boy, how to not let them know exactly how much he meant -
As Harry slid further down into his seat, his eyes almost parallel with the desk, Professor Opacre's eyes danced in his direction. "Yes, Harry," she replied, voice full of laughter. "My brother's Gemmus happens to be the rose quartz."
Qye muttered as Harry unfolded the note delivered to the dormitory after he finished with Professor Opacre.  By the time they were done and he had made it back to his dorm, most of his friends had already left for Hogsmeade, with Ron leaving a note saying they would see him there as Fred and George had plans for Zonko’s before the dance.
Harry stared at the hysterical Ron and Seamus before turning his eyes to his other friends.  Neville was blushing furiously, his eyes cast down and avoiding Harry’s gaze.  Dean’s face also showed embarrassment as he tried to shove off his best friend.  Hermione continued to hide her face behind her book but Harry had the sneaking suspicion that she was still blushing.
Things continued like this until all of the students arrived and finished settling in. And even then, Lest didn't say a single word. His gaze just focused on them and Harry nervously twirled his quill.
"That there's no way to win against a vampire?" Nott muttered as he rubbed his elbow from where it had hit the ground when he had faced Lest. "Yes, I'd say that lesson's pretty well-learned."
“Huh,” Qye blinked and considered something.  He chewed on his lip as he thought about it while Harry howled in his head.  Since he woke up, he had been reaching for Harry, for the familiarity of his mind to anchor him and didn’t think to stop while everything occurred.  “I wonder…”
“So am I,” Remus said, dropping his hands and sitting down next to him.  He looked at the floor, his hands clasped between his knees while Sirius took slow, shuddering breaths next to him.  They sat quietly as the minutes ticked past on the clock, well into the night.
The reply had come several days later, while Ron contemplated Apparating with Fred and George to Hogwarts even if he had no clue if his best friend was still there and no matter that they couldn't directly Apparate there.  The letter gave little more information, written as if careful of being intercepted.  Malfoy wrote briefly that he had made it to the grounds during the attack and that he was at Hogwarts, watching over their common ground with the last minute allies.
Harry muttered as he sighed and scrubbed his hair.  He took in a deep breath and left the privacy screen to see Professor Opacre rummaging through a box on her desk.  He eyed the way to the door, wondering if he should make another escape attempt, when she turned around, a pencil in her hand.
Harry said nothing, still staring blankly at the crowd as his mind tried to focus and connect the contradictory and startling information.  Next to him he felt Ron shuffle and drop a hand on his shoulder, vaguely heard him ask if he was all right.
“Maybe,” Harry smiled, moving so Ron could leave the room first.  Before the redhead could exit though, he grasped his arm.  Ron turned to look curiously at him, the smile gone from Harry’s face, replaced with a sincere look.
Hermione looked at him, chocolate eyes filled with concern. “Do you want to talk about it?” Ron looked at him, expectation and a flicker of hope in his own eyes.
Moving his head slowly around, he blinked as he recognized the room as part of the Infirmary. This meant he was still at Hogwarts. His brow furrowed in confusion and he was distracted momentarily by the feeling of facial movement. Shaking his head, he scolded himself.
Instead, the door had flung open to reveal Professor Opacre in a bright yellow dress, eyes feverishly bright with a pale green scarf in one hand and a bottle in another.  He had stood for one second, mouth agape as he blinked at the multitude of opened trunks behind her, the scattering of fabrics across the floor, desk and furniture.
Qye looked down.  “Doing what I want.”  He shrugged uncomfortably and turned back to the bookshelf, folding his arms on his chest, gritting his teeth at showing this to the Mind-Healer and the notes she might make.
“Astrid,” Lest said and she watched Nilsson turn to her Pater, impassive.  “This is unreasonable, I can’t believe you would - ”
He inwardly cheered as the suspicion vanished from Granger’s eyes…then sighed when he saw the worry flood in.
He hadn’t said anything when Dumbledore had conjured stretchers and transferred them, too pale and too thin.  He merely stumbled after him as the old wizard sharply sent a message ahead to the Infirmary, conjuring a cloaking spell around them as they hurried off.  Marylin had barely recalled telling Leon and Saira to handle the prisoners before she joined them, barely noticed Draco pulling free of Snape and catching up.
“Stop gawking and get to work!” snarled Snape, his black eyes glittering angrily as he stared, scowling, at all the students.  His eyes narrowed further when the class was slow to resume, some Slytherins and Gryffindors alike still eyeing the door uneasily.  He flew down at them and a few scathing words – and some lost points – later, the Potions class started up again.
Draco wore black slacks that framed his long legs with a gray button down that hung slightly beyond his waist.  Harry’s eyes lingered on the silver tie next to the single button left undone at Draco’s collarbone and noted its soft silk shimmer.  Overall, the effect made Harry’s palms sweat and mouth dry.
“Headmaster,” the Dark Lord he heard so much about said mockingly as the Death Eaters spread out, their masked faces at contrast with the open, disdainful ones of the Dazain vampires.  Lest felt a slow roll of anger as he eyed the wizard who had brought so much misery to Harry, his features twisted and barely reminiscent of anything human.  “How long it has been.”
?’ Jordan Taine thought wearily as he stared out of a nearby window and into the fierce thunderstorm outside.  The rain was coming down swiftly and the lightning made the dim room fill with light for a moment before being plunged back into near darkness, the only source of light being a small fire in the stone fireplace.
“Don’t touch him!” Lest hissed, body tall and stiff with teeth bared, and Qye remembered a Christmas so long ago with that same pose that he laughed at and he screamed again, lunging for the treacherous vampire once more.
Ron winced as its teeth tore through his clothes, scratching his skin and sending it into a further frenzy as it touched his blood.  He gasped and kicked and blocked with one arm, fingers scrabbling for his knocked aside wand.  He heard Sinistra shouting spells and saw more beasts come down the corridor.
Draco thought this as he faintly trailed his fingertips across the soft back of the sleeping boy’s hand. It wasn’t clammy to touch, feeling rather warm and soft. He comforted himself with tracing shapes and words across it. All the while, even breathing passed across the back of his own hand, warm and sweet and gentle.
“As I was saying, continued sessions with me, daily for the foreseeable future,” Wainscott said calmly.  “To be faded as goals are met, which we will discuss and review as needed.  These sessions with me will take place alongside your daily check-ins with Healer Smethwyck and Ms. Nilsson, who will no longer simply consult but also be a mandatory part of your medical reviews.  This was agreed upon by all of us, Qye,” she said, holding a hand up to stop his protest.  “We cannot ignore the status you have as a Carus and if you wish to be able to independently function in society, you need to learn to accept and work with it.”
“One week until the exams are over,” Lord Voldemort continued, apparently unconcerned with the tension between the groups.  “One week until the older students are drained, the professors distracted by the exams for the other years.  None of them are wondering and no one will be on guard, as you suggested.”
“Damn it, Harry,” he heard the Slytherin mutter and fought the urge to agree as he eyed the remaining two beasts, growling and standing in the way between them and the group.
Unstable, the book had said.  Side effects.  And what was it Qye – he – had said earlier? Vampires and wizards had never mixed, who knew what the results would be.
Both he and Harry jumped when she suddenly whipped her wand out at Malfoy, voice going higher as she said shrilly, “Malfoy, what did you
The awkward silence fell across the room again and Sirius cursed himself as he watched the pairs of green eyes cool and look away from him.
"That is something you'll have to control," Professor Opacre said dryly. She shook her head. "Look, vampires have telepathy, right?" She waited for them to nod before continued. "Vampires can read minds." She glanced at Seamus. "Yes, Mr. Finnegan, I've known you've been talking to the Hufflepuffs since the beginning of the year," she smirked.
“Well,” she said, smiling slightly, “it seems that at least some of you do have a sense of humor.”  She grinned and straightened up from leaning up against the desk.  “How about we try this roll call once more?  This time without the squirrel imitations, yes?” she joked, walking back over to her podium.  More students laughed this time and her smile began to become more real.
“He had to have planned it like this, Remus,” Sirius said and Remus heard the note of desperation in the man’s hoarse voice.  “For it to be tomorrow when that Mind-Healer is finally coming and - ”
Draco had shifted his gaze and stared with hard eyes but the redhead never looked back at them, instead digging through his bag for his textbook.
Jordan’s cousin nodded.  “Very well, I’ll send the reply tonight.  If the Dazains do join Voldemort, we’ll be there to meet them with our own surprise.”  He stood up and Leon suddenly spoke up.
His hand stilled on top of the drawer next to his bed as he heard the voice in his head.  Sighing quietly, he grabbed his glasses and shoved them on.  ‘
“Leave, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, steel beneath his careful words.  “There is no win here.”  Behind him, Lest could hear the rumbling of the castle’s protections.  He sent a probe to his sister and she swiftly answered, hiding as much as she could in case Dazain caught on.
Harry said quietly, turning over on his side and curling up, winding his arms around his knees and staring at the wall.
“You think I haven’t tried?” Snape snapped. “There’s nothing I can do, Dumbledore has full confidence in both of them and won’t think otherwise until they show their true natures. There’s not much I can do, they’ve been keeping themselves pretty clean.” He scowled, looking displeased at the fact.
As they reached the door, Draco suddenly called out his name.  Harry turned around warily, Ron glaring furiously at the cool blond, Hermione still looking thoughtful.
“Three more are heading from the east corridor!” she shouted, her wand never ceasing in casting her charms, in deflecting attacks as she tried her best to support them.
As the thought crossed his mind, there came a clatter at the door and Harry shifted his green eyes to see Professor Opacre bustle in with papers and what appeared to be a clear make up bag containing various vials in an assortment of colors.
“Go,” Snape said and Remus’ stomach dropped because his voice sounded almost pitying, even as he still sneered at Sirius and Remus.  Sirius must have heard it too because Remus saw his friend go slightly paler, a disturbed and even more worried look entering his eyes.
And the volume suddenly went up, just a little bit, because he heard the surprised cries from the other students, Hermione's worried voice and Ron's low curses penetrating them and he even thought he heard Professor Opacre cry out to, voice concerned one moment, scolding the next.
“Almost done, Harry,” Hermione said absently as she raised her hand towards one of the several attendants dashing behind the bar, filling orders as quickly as possible.  One of them seemed to have seen her because Harry suddenly found himself once again being dragged by Hermione, this time to the other side of the room and still not any closer back to the table.
He was also beloved by all the servants and seemed to always say something to make Draco look stupid or mean. He wasn’t a snitch, but still Draco seemed to always get in trouble for Potter’s failures. It wasn’t his fault that Potter was too small to go riding, but tried anyhow. He was supposed to be scared of Lord Nott’s new war horse stallion.
Henry looked at the king and bowed. “I’m sorry, your Royal Highness, I will sign the contract as I am honorbound to do so, but I beg of you to release me to my godfather until the day of matrimony. I fear I need to recover and prepare for this.”
They walked the rest of the way to the entrance hall in a comfortable silence, next to each other, not touching but close enough to have been holding hands. Harry smiled a bit as he realized that once the prince shut up and stopped being a perfect monster, he was almost nice to be around.
"Fine," huffed Hermione, "Fetch Ginny or your mom and we can both go." It wasn't too much longer before they took wing and found Harry in human skin crying in a dead end of the maze.
“Draco? Why are you here? How are you here?” Henry looked around nervously. The two cranes he had followed landed on either side of him and the swans stepped back as Henry walked forward. The man was dressed in exotic fineries and was more lovely than ever. Draco just couldn’t understand how he never saw the beauty in the younger man before that last fateful meeting.
“Please be nice to the poor boy. He will not know anyone, while you will not only know the Greengrass family, but also your companions shall be with you. From what I understand he will not have an entourage and has spent most of his childhood in a country manor as his parents are gone.” Draco stopped whining, “He will need your kindness and help as he will no doubt be lost.”
It was one of the first things little Winky had done to him, she had soaked him in a magic potion filled bath, and he had emerged with baby soft skin. He had cried over it before, as what she had taken from him sank in. She had thought it a kindness, but Henry knew it was really just another bit of his strength chipped away.
“Oh yes, the year Draco broke his arm trying to outdo him in a horseback race, I had gone to the stable to try to get Henry to come and ease Draco’s ill humor and I came upon him sitting in a stall with his monster, he was braiding ribbons into that mane and screeching out peasant songs. The child was not only out of tune, but just plain unsuited to making his voice sound pretty. It was just such a surprise.” She giggled, “I think it was assuming that because he was fair of face and graceful, he would be a songbird, but he was more like a swan.”
"Yeah, but you make it worse for him when you act like your…" she was interrupted as a smaller back door was flung open and a thin short figure dashed out and into the rose maze. She could almost scent the salt of tears and anger, "Take over the nest."
“I see,” Narcissa leaned into Lucius, who wrapped an arm around her and pulled her closer, “He was a charming young boy, but quiet. He had the most wretched singing voice though.”
After two weeks of pampering, he was sent back to the cold manor. To make up for lost time he was often given to the chamber maid and made to collect and clean bedpans in addition to the scullery work. It made his mornings start even earlier.
“Mother, I don’t want to go to the Garden House for summer. I want to spend summer like we always do at the Silver Sea Palace with great Uncle Gellert.” Draco pouted at Narsissa.
Finally, the dark ship arrived and Lord Black and Potter rode off the ship and as per tradition, gave gifts to the host. Draco could not look away from Potter. The winter had fixed the problems that plagued his betrothed. The weedy child was now lithe, still short, but seemed to just fit his elfin features, his hair was no longer a rats nest, but ebony curls that just made his ivory skin and verdant eyes glow. The soft sage doublet hugged his figure, and his leggings made the tight muscles of his long lean legs so evident.
“Yes, and I’m not opposed. He’s sired a few in the past, his coloring tends to breed true as does his intelligence. His size has been a bit more flexible.” Harry said contemplatively, “Given the right mares and you could found a very interesting line for your stables. But I’ve taken payment in the past for that service, I’m not sure I’m comfortable enriching my gaoler.”
“Ah, I see someone found a thin spot in the Underhill.” Harry jumped as he was startled by Voldemort’s voice and a heavy white hand settling on his shoulder. He had been taken to the stables and introduced to the senior groom and ferrier. But Harry had always been the one to curry Dullahan unless he was deadly ill and it hadn’t taken long for him to fall into a meditative state while brushing out his lush coat, mane, and tail.
"I'm not sure if it's the magic of the realm or if all birds are like them. One blessing of being a swanmay is understanding and talking with such loving creatures." Henry lifted himself onto the rail and swung his legs over so they dangled above the water. Voldemort manifested his dark dragonfly wings and alighted next to Henry. He took Henry's empty glass and with a mote of crimson flame the glass vanished as it was just ice.
"I don't know anymore." Harry said with a deep sadness. "I've never felt more at home than I have ever been, but I worry about my godfather and I have a duty to my kingdom."
He looked back at his arithmantic calculations for adjusting the curse. As it was a failed love confession was just inconvenient,  but with the adjustment he could trap Henry as a swanmay or as a resident of only Underhill. Or, and this was his favorite, he would have to marry Tom before the next night or die a slow wasting death. With that, after three days, the shock of transformation would kill him.
Voldemort watched his scrying mirror with a slight smirk. That foolish mortal that intruded upon his lands was scurrying like a rodent trying to prepare some grand ball and gift for his little swanmay. It was almost sad, if it weren’t ominously close to the criteria for breaking the curse.
Finally, on Midsummer Day, an exhibition force found the secret path that ended on a hill overlooking over a valley filled with a placid lake and an ancient castle of grey granite.
"My earliest memory is of being taunted and called slave, plaything, and pet. My Queen bathed me in the blood of the last Prince whom I slew. And then she fixed his wings to my back and finished pulling the contamination of humanity from my bones." Voldemort was surprised as Henry leaned against him.
Draco went back to the maps of Stinchcombe Wood and plotted out the rough route he’d need to take to find the way to Underhill. He knew that he would need a small company to attend but beyond that he had no idea of the defenses that were involved in infiltrating such a taboo location. He knew of stories where the return was due to completing convoluted tasks and meeting odd requirements like not looking back.
“But you heard him; he’s serious about his terms for your release. You can go what you want; you’re an adult, after all. But the Grimmauld Place situation is untenable.”
The waiter's nodded, his attitude appropriate for a young man serving at a dinner party with a high-powered attendance list, but Harry thought he looked amused.
Draco straightened, and even he looked alarmed. "Wait; I read the info about this event, and I didn't see anything about that!"
Potter grinned again, and it went straight, somewhat inconveniently, to Draco’s groin. “The recipe for these cupcakes is a new one--,” he gestured towards the small, rotating cakes, “-- and you said you like mocha flavoring, yeah?”
"Three thousand," the man at the podium sang out in delight. "Apparently Mr Malfoy doesn't want to share."
Harry took a deep breath. “I’m going to take a nap, and then I’m going to wrap some Christmas presents for some very cute little kids and one obnoxious teenager. I’m going to check on little miss Thestral, who is feeling very full of herself at the moment, by the way,” she gave him a swift smile, “and I’ll go over everything with Hagrid. I’d like to have dinner with you and the kids, then my Portkey activates and I’ll be back on Ginger before midnight.”
At the foot of the towering lit fir tree was an altar, on which were lighted several candles and one tall, fat gold one, as yet unlit. There were several other things there as well; evergreen, holly, a bowl that appeared to hold a glittering substance, but Harry was too busy watching Draco to see where he was supposed to stand to take it all in. The drum and pipe music faded, echoing against the Manor’s high walls. There was a glowing circle drawn on the snow, and each of the four of them took up places opposite another; he and Draco facing each other across the circle, Narcissa and Andromeda doing the same. Teddy stood at Draco’s side, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen him so still. The rest of the guests closed in around them, standing in respectful silence.
“But that’s the point, you see,” Draco argued reasonably. “Your bird arrived with the design that Mr. Potter created, just as my customer’s bird arrived with this one.” He held it out to her again. “And I can assure you that Barnett Rohrbach, the prize fighter, has no desire for a tattoo of a pink pygmy puff on his chest. Lily might not have verified the design, but the mistake was with your bird, not with her.”
Draco's eyes narrowed. "There's no chair next to you on the dais, Potter. You came alone. You didn't plan to have a date. Everyone in that room out there knows that."
“Hello, earth to Draco,” Pansy said sharply, and Draco realized his mind had been thousands of miles away, and she’d still been talking to him.
“Aren’t you?” Draco countered. “You aren’t telling yourself that you should know what’s wrong, just because they put faith in you? That you’re afraid you’ll let them down?”
There, on the mantle, just to the left of several pictures from his youth and nestled amongst the cedar bows that decorated it, was a Nutcracker. It had not been there before, Draco was certain of it, and it eyed him with a frighteningly human expression of disdain on its painted face.
The hair on the back of Draco’s neck twitched, and he had a sudden, strong feeling that whatever she was going to ask, he really wasn’t going to like it. “Hermione…”
She looked surprised to be included, but crossed her arms over her skinny little chest, gripping her elbows. “Thank you, Master Draco,” she whispered, and he gave her a slight nod in response.
“He didn’t say,” she answered. “But…” Her eyes suddenly widened. “Oh, my,” she said appreciatively. “I think you should turn around.”
Harry took him at his word and let himself go, driving into him in a punishing pace. The bed began to squeak and the headboard bounce off of the wall, and still Draco urged him to go harder, faster. Just when it became too much, when his balls began to tighten and Harry felt pressure building at the base of his spine, Draco cried out and stiffened, shuddering in his arms. Harry felt the warm wetness of Draco’s release between them just as his own orgasm spilled from him and he cried out, his back locking, his body shaking as he came harder than he could ever remember. It seemed to last a long time, and they strained together until almost as one, they fell limp, their breathing loud and ragged, their bodies trembling with exertion.
Mrs Hanratty blinked. “That’s scarcely the point,” she blustered. “Jeffrey’s a child and his Muggle-born mother is a fool.” She missed the dangerous gleam that entered Potter’s eyes, but Draco didn’t. Heedlessly, she went on. “I did not order that cake. I ordered a white sponge cake with Bavarian cream filling and pink buttercream icing, in the shape of a pygmy puff.”
Draco withdrew slowly, his back and shoulders going rigid. "I have no idea what you're talking about," he managed stiffly.
“She’s visiting my grandmother,” Dennis answered. “I stayed behind because I have to work…” He frowned. “I don’t want to talk about my mother.”
She nodded imperturbably. “With the adults, yes. With the little ones I need to wait to see how much they grow. The yarn doesn’t take particularly well to stretching charms.”
“And so, this is the tree?” Draco said, reaching out and running beautiful long fingers over the bend of the little tree.
“You wretched liar,” Draco drawled. Moments later, the crisp white shirt floated out of the bathroom door, landing at Harry’s feet. “Besides, age is a state of mind. How old are you feeling?”
“Happy New Year.... Harry,” he murmured just as a great cheer went up and horns went off around them, but Potter read the words on his lips, and a slow smile slid across his mouth. He leaned in then, unmindful of the crowd around them, apparently uncaring whether anyone watched them or not, and kissed Draco with a slow, sweet passion that made the room and the noise and the crowd simply disappear. Draco sank his hands into the thickness of Harry's hair, for he was Harry now and probably always would be, at least in his heart, and kissed him back, hoping that he could tell him without words what this meant to him; to be held and kissed for all the world to see. To be validated as someone worthy of the love of a great man, by the man himself.
Harry accepted the comment for what it was; an olive branch. He glanced over at the coffee stand to see Hermione watching them anxiously. He gave her a quick, reassuring wink. “Fortunately,” he turned back to Malfoy, “she takes after her mother. The boys are more like me.”
Draco had put the small silver wrapped package on the table and forgot about it. He didn’t believe he’d get what he wanted for Christmas, not with Hogwarts being offered to Harry. He’d seen the lost man in the cupboard in Little Whinging, going back to a place where he’d known nothing but abuse because he was so desperate for a home. And Hermione’s words echoed in his ears.
“Of course I know.” Draco huffed. “I can hear, and they might’ve asked me to step out of the room during his debriefing, but they couldn’t stop me from eavesdropping.”
The Floo went dark, and Harry sat back, starring into the darkened fireplace for several minutes, his mind racing. Finally, he pushed to his feet and went up the stairs.
She reached for one of the cardboard boxes behind the counter and began to fold in the sides, her mind working. So, her Mum thought that her Dad had had a thing for Mr Malfoy, back in school. It was kind of romantic, actually. Love struck teenage boys, forced apart by the expectations of others and the fact that they were on different sides during the war. It was really sort of sad; tragic, even. Like a gay Romeo and Juliet…
“Whatever are you looking for?” Hermione asked in a sharp tone as he went through the stack of letters again, carefully one at a time. He looked up at her.
Draco angled his hips, and Harry felt his answering burgeoning hardness against his thigh. Draco’s hands spread and slid up Harry’s chest, onto his shoulders, and then further yet until his fingers spread and sank deeply into Harry’s hair. He moaned into Harry’s open mouth, and Harry took the opportunity to slip his tongue between Draco’s teeth. Draco stroked through Harry’s curls, his fingertips moving on Harry’s scalp and his nails moving gently from his crown to his nape. It felt amazing, and all Harry could think was that he wanted him underneath him, wanted to be inside of him so much that it was almost overwhelming. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s slender waist, pulling him from the doorframe, walking him backwards. Draco made a kind of adorable little squeak that sounded like a chipmunk as he was propelled in reverse, then he yelped as Harry pushed him down on his back on the couch.
Harry smirked. “That would be a right shame, Mate,” he said, shooting his friend a sly grin. “I’m under the impression that your wife would like more children.”
The hearth suddenly flared brilliant green, and Harry startled. It had been years since he’d seen a Floo activate. Moments later, George Weasley’s face appeared.
Hermione turned to Kingsley. “And you may be Minister for Magic, but this situation is fucked up and you know it.”
Long, sinewy arms encircled him from behind, a slender, muscled chest pressed against his back and a faintly pointed chin came to rest on his shoulder.
Draco took a deep breath and caught Harry's wrist, pulling his hand back and stepping away. "You didn't do anything. We have to go, or we're going to be late."
them up to the house, Draco held up his other hand. “Here, take this,” he said, and unsure what he planned, Harry hesitated a moment before shifting his grip to the gloved hand. Once he released his arm, Draco slid it around Harry’s waist and stepped into his body.
“He’s not here. He opened an orphanage in Freddie’s name after the war. During December he spends a lot of time there.”
They walked several blocks, Malfoy apparently perfectly happy to maintain his silence and Harry unable to think of a single thing to say that wouldn’t sound stupid. Hermione’s comment that he was obsessed, more like. Particularly sixth year… seemed to hang between them. He wasn’t sure what to say after that; it had revealed far too much for his peace of mind, and he really just hoped Malfoy would completely forget about it. He was staring down at the asphalt, now glimmering with dampness from the fog, when brilliant lights reflected in the water caused him to look up. He stopped, staring up at what appeared to be an enormous angel made entirely of Christmas lights.
"And Hermione," Harry said, but he could agree with the sentiment. He certainly never planned to be important at the Ministry. There'd been a time when he'd vowed
George laughed and patted him on the back. “See? It’s like riding a bike. It’ll all come back to you.”
“My thought exactly,” Harry agreed. “I wonder if I ought to mention this to Minerva. If the kids are going to start turning up with tattoo’s, were likely to have some seriously hacked off parents.”
“Potter,” he said smoothly. Harry had to admire his recovery time. He no longer looked even remotely embarrassed.
Of course, he’d have to make a few adjustments, he mused as he reached into his sleeve for his wand, but he began to smile as he thought this just might be the beginning of a brilliant plan…
“It’s all right. Give the man a break, Hermione. If I weren’t his boss and made him leave, he’d have been late, too.”
,” he murmured, and immediately the burning throb began to fade. Harry let his head fall to the side onto Draco’s shoulder as for the first time in weeks, nothing hurt.
Harry noticed that she looked a bit careworn and uneasy, and he nodded. "Of course." He glanced back at Ginny. "I'll talk to you soon, yeah?"
“Thought I might come over here and give you fair warning, mate,” Weasley said as he took a drink from a bottle he held in his hand. “Hurricane Hermione is about to blow your way, and she isn't happy.” Potter grimaced.
“Here, here,” Arthur called out, and it was repeated more than once as their guests drank to their health. Harry never really planned to have a home of his own, or a husband, or children, so to him, all of this was the ultimate blessing. He felt full to bursting with gratitude.
“This may sting a little,” Draco murmured, dabbing at the blood and looking up into her eyes. “But I can heal it, if you’ll trust me.”
“Hence?” Malfoy repeated, face alight with humor. He lowered his wand and the gates creaked open. “Harry Potter just said ‘hence’.”
"Oh, for fuck's sakes," Draco muttered. "How fucking ridiculous." He affected a higher, snarly voice,
Harry started to say something else, but he was forced to silence when Draco held him tighter and they disappeared from the Burrow’s yard. Draco knew the jolt of Apparition would silence his arguments as nothing else could.
“I’ve no idea what you mean,” the ginger haired man said blithely. “Other than the poor operator did seem a bit… confounded.”
Initially, when they were first dating, Harry had stayed at Grimmauld and Draco in Hertfordshire. That had been okay for about two weeks. When it became obvious that Draco really needed to be close to the clinic and Harry could sleep about anywhere as long as they could connect the Floo network, Hertfordshire and the flat upstairs became home. Harry hadn’t decided what he was going to do with the house yet; at first he thought he should probably keep it in case anything went wrong but that concern only lasted about six months. Now he considered giving it to Teddy, with Andromeda in the guardianship role until he was twenty five. It was a good house now, the dark magic scrubbed away. It had a few idiosyncrasies but a lot of old houses did, and with Andromeda being a Black he felt like she could handle those. Honestly he felt she was more entitled to the place than he was to begin with. He also thought Sirius would be pleased with the idea of Remus’s son living there; now that he was older, he couldn’t help but wonder if there hadn’t been something between them, when they were young. It saddened him that there wasn’t anyone left alive to ask.
"No, Hermione," he said, waving the energetic man away. He didn't miss the small frown of disappointment that moved across his face. "I need to stretch my legs anyway. I'll just go to the bar."
Draco fingered Harry for several long minutes, until both their cocks were wet at the tip and Harry’s was leaving a shallow pool of pre-come in the indent of his navel. He was moaning and arching in arousal, his hands twisted in the duvet. He seemed to scarcely notice when Draco lifted one of Harry’s legs behind his knee, resting the bend over his shoulder. He withdrew his fingers, taking more lube onto his hand to smooth over his erection, then placed the head at Harry’s opening and eased in, one smooth slow glide.
Draco didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so he didn’t say precisely how right she was. Pen was a sweet little thing, something Pansy had never been. But then, Pen was part of the first generation in decades raised without the shadow of a madman hanging over them; Theo and Pans could afford to let her keep her sweetness.
Draco had cornered their hapless waiter near an archway between the dining area and the bar, and very politely, he thought, asked that he point out the table that the card and the drink had come from. He’d been something less than cooperative, and had looked at Draco as if he were faintly terrifying. Draco finally huffed and walked away from him, judging that identifying the culprit probably wouldn’t be too difficult.
“Thank you, dear.” Molly pulled out a chair and sat, crossing her hands in her lap. “And if you find them objectionable, boys, you don’t have to eat them.”
She shushed him. “The way he looks at you? I think you’re mistaken.” She patted him on the back then straightened away. “Go on with you, now.”
Harry chuckled weakly, and Hermione frowned at Ron over her shoulder. “That was perhaps unnecessarily colorful.”
Malfoy snorted softly, but never let it be said anyone got in the way when Hermione was on a mission.
“You,” Harry answered. He turned away from Draco’s quizzical frown, noticing a tray on the table in front of the couch. Sometimes Kreacher was worth keeping around. He gestured with an expansive wave of his arm; much more expansive than it would have been if he was completely sober. “Would you care for some cocoa?”
“Come on, Buddy,” he said, swinging Adrian up onto his hip to the child’s delight. “Let’s get out of here before someone else wants to share their latest potty-training successes with me.”
Harry was cleaning his hands in a bucket of ice water, using a pic to get under his nails. He was so tired.
“You’re insane,” Draco countered, rolling his eyes. Harry could see he wanted to cross his arms and wouldn’t let him, gripping one wrist and holding it by his side.
Harry walked into the steamy bathroom, his smile spreading as he saw the lithe, pale figure through the mottled glass shower door. He was standing under the warm spray, his head back as the water sluiced down his long, lean, form. He looked over his shoulder at Harry, and if there had ever been a come-hither look, this was it.
Draco nodded quickly. “Hurry,” he urged, stepping back. “Please Harry, hurry.” He looked around, wrapping his arms around himself, trying to replicate Harry’s warmth. He felt so exposed, standing there at the end of the walkway. They needed to be where no one could see them.
“I’m not surprised.” Harry took a sip of his hot coffee and felt the warmth spread through him clear to his toes.
"Ah, admit it, Dad. The only reason you wanted this walk is because you miss my sparkling wit and charming personality."
“How about I make a dish for you, love,” Draco leaned close and offered, so overcome with delight at how wonderful Harry looked that he forgot his usual reserve about PDA’s. He pressed a quick kiss to Harry’s lips. “What would you like?”
“Finish Auntie Augusta’s cake?” she asked. For some reason, Mrs Longbottom had taken a shine to Lily when she’d been tiny, and Lily adored the old battle axe in return.
“Oh, you need to go to Pennymustard’s?” Pansy had said brightly.  “Do be a dear and pick up my order as well, will you?  It’s what Assistants
It was all he was able to get out before the ring glowed bright blue, then the familiar feeling of being hooked behind his navel and dragged away sent a shock through him. He heard Draco shout, and Hermione gasp, then he was flying through space in a dizzying rush. When it stopped as abruptly as it had begun, he fell heavily to his knees, his stomach rolling as he fought to catch his breath.
“Possibly,” Potter smiled, taking another sip of his wine and setting the glass aside.  He scooted closer to Draco, reaching out to touch his flat stomach.  The muscles contracted under his fingertips as the bath water rippled around Draco's shoulders.  “But Ron actually does want me to be happy,” he said, fingers stroking over soft, wet skin.  “And he sees that I'm happy right now.”
"She wouldn't tell me, and if she won't tell me, trust me, she won't tell you." He could see a plan to ingratiate himself to his Aunt beginning to percolate in Al's feverish brain. "Al, you know what magic can do, particularly the old spells." Harry and his brilliant middle child had many conversations about horcruxes once he reached that chapter in his History of Magic text book.
The next day, it was long after they’d opened gifts, had brunch, and spent lazy hours lounging around the drawing room in monogrammed pyjamas and robes. Everyone had retired to dress, and they had gathered back in the sitting room, the scent of the turkey and all of the assorted accompaniments for dinner wafting through the air, when Draco looked over at Harry and caught his eye. Harry smiled slightly and nodded, and Draco stood, reached into the pocket of his trousers and looking at his mother, slipped the platinum ring onto the third finger of his left hand. Narcissa stiffened, her mouth falling open, her eyes wide.
Harry snorted. “She doesn’t love me enough to be excited it you catch a cold right before Christmas. Okay, that one looks pretty good, love. Take my hand.”
He nodded again, shifting his feet a bit uncomfortably.  Finally, he squared his shoulders and lifted his chin.  “Is he… seeing anyone, right now?”
It was only the second time, outside of the bedroom, that Harry had ever used the word with him, the first on the phone just half an hour before. Something about it must have got through to him, because he let the amused expression fade.
At one time, Draco would have been the first in line to take the piss out of ‘The Chosen One’ with that information, simply because the whole ‘coming out’ thing was just too good to miss.
Artie hesitated and Harry narrowed his eyes. Apparently realizing that hacking off his uncle, especially when said uncle was Harry Potter, was probably a very bad idea, Artie thrust out his arm. From his wrist to the bend of his elbow was a beautifully rendered griffin. Harry bent to study it more carefully, admiring it in spite of himself. As he stared, the griffin turned his regal head and pinned Harry with a baleful stare. A magical tattoo, then. Harry sighed.
He’d been awake, lying in the warmth with his eyes closed, since the first gray light of dawn had touched the curtains at the windows. His leg ached and he was well past time for his pain potion, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. On the one hand, the potions made him tired and he didn’t want to do anything but sleep. On the other hand, he wasn’t sure why he bothered to stay awake. He was enjoying Teddy’s company, and he truly did want to be a better Godfather than he had been. But the budding magic in the boy was palpable, and just being round him, watching his hair turn color from black to blond and back again, just being able to see how good a wizard he’d become, made Harry’s chest ache. He wore his wand in its holster almost every day, but he knew what magic felt like surging through his system, and he hadn’t felt a flicker of it since the bike he was on crashed into the pavement. The Healer told him what might be the result of what the Muggle surgeons had done, putting all of the metal in his body. Gods, how he’d hoped he was wrong. The longer he went feeling nothing, however –
She stared at him for so long that he began to feel uncomfortable.  “Draco, you know that I adore you,” she said finally.  “Have done since we were in nappies.  But you are too idle.  Where once being part of the ruling class was attractive, now it just seems lazy.”
When he rounded the corner that lead to WWW, he stopped dead in his tracks, staring. The place had been something special when they visited before sixth year. But now?
“Pushy,” Harry said wryly, but he shifted so that he was straddling Draco’s hips, then lowered his body down slowly.
Harry kissed him. "I don't care. Like this, then?" he wrapped his hand around them just above Draco's fist.
Nineteen-year-old Lily smiled at him, and as far as Harry was concerned she was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. There was a lot of her mother in her; Ginny’s coltish figure and long legs, and her swath of straight auburn hair. But there was some of the first Lily Potter in her as well, particularly the bright green eyes Harry inherited, as well. She was wearing snug jeans and fashionable brown suede ankle boots, and a bulky tan jacket with a fake fur collar. No real fur for his animal rights enthusiast daughter; she was her Aunt Hermione’s niece from her toes to the top of her head. She wore a bright, rainbow hued knit hat and matching scarf that wrapped around her neck and hung nearly to her knees. With her pink cheeks and her freckled nose, everything about her made warmth fill Harry’s chest.
There was a man sprawled in a comfortable looking chair by his bed, sound asleep. His face was in shadow, his head back, but Harry could see he had neat, short pale hair. Harry always went for blonds, and this one was right up his alley; long legs were encased in snug jeans, he was wearing a dark blue jumper that hugged a nicely muscled upper body, and he had beautiful, long-fingered hands that hung relaxed over the arms of the chair. Still a bit fuzzy, Harry tried to recall the name of the man he’d picked up a couple of days earlier in the Muggle bar not far from his hotel. Dale, was it? Dean? Wait, Derek? He couldn’t remember. Something with a ‘d’. Well, that was embarrassing. Whoever he was, he’d been a brilliant shag but not much of a conversationalist, and Harry couldn’t think for the life of him why the bloke was sitting by his bed.
“Charming, you are,” Ron muttered. She gave him a hard look when he stood and went to the refrigerator, returning with another bottle of beer. He popped the top and set it in front of her, then reclaimed his chair.
Well, no second thoughts, but with hands that shook.  And that was because of the appearance of Parkinson’s assistant.
They stared at one another for several long seconds, finally turning back to the path, the silence awkward. Suddenly more than anything, Harry wanted to offer to take Draco to the Room of Requirement, just to see if the vision would return.
“Not in the long run, obviously,” Draco gave him a sideways look. “But for a few months, there. Okay,” he rubbed his hands together, clearly changing the subject. “Let’s charm some trees into place, shall we?”
"Well, the thought had occurred." She stared at him hard, as if trying to riddle out a thorny puzzle. "Why does the question make you angry?"
Harry took a deep breath as if preparing for battle, then entered the next room.  Bernard gestured Draco forward to follow him, then brought up the rear, closing the door quietly behind them.
Harry sent Malfoy a dark look. “I know how to research,” he complained. “You don’t get through any kind of medical school without being able to.”
Harry looked around, too, and saw the avid eyes. “Fuck,” he muttered, then took a deep breath. “Fine.”
Once the door closed behind him, the silence he left behind was heavy. Harry looked over at him, and there was a tentativeness, and nervousness in his wide eyes.
“Granger-Weasley, and yes.” Harry leaned closer to him. “Draco, he’s a smart lad, and some interaction with other children would be good for him. It might be good for you, too.”
“Good thing you’re gay,” Hermione said merrily. “I doubt Ron wants you imaging me in a tiny little thong.”
“Or Potter Stinks badge, or Bludger to the head line-drawing, or ‘Potter’,” he impersonated Draco’s sly, drawn out tone, and Draco sighed.
"As do we, not to mention you, undoubtedly, need no introduction," Draco said. He looked to Harry, who smiled at the woman and quickly offered his hand to her, then her husband.
"Ah." It was one of the stories they'd shared during those two weeks. They'd laughed together uproariously over the fact Crabbe and Goyle ate the drugged sweets in the first place, and Harry swore him to secrecy over Hermione spending two weeks in hospital, coughing up fur balls. "You should know I gave them permission to finish their project."
Draco didn’t even think to protest when the slacks fell open and Potter pushed them down past his hips. Yes, he was still wearing the jumper and scarf, but those weren’t in areas that were screaming for release. His cock, on the other hand, was quite desperate. He really wouldn’t have minded if Potter had simply taken him out and rubbed him off, but when Potter left his pants where they were, and slid to his knees, he involuntarily groaned in anticipation.
Adrian looked down at Harry’s feet as if noticing they were bare for the first time. “You’s hair on you’s toes.”
“No, it’s okay,” he said, not sure if he was trying to reassure her, or himself. “We had a good couple of days. We no longer want to kill one another. Expecting anything else after two days really isn’t fair.”
“I was teasing, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly. “You perhaps didn’t recognise it because I was such an obnoxious snot in my youth?”
“Merlin’s pants, Potter,” he said, sounding irritated but only until Harry lowered his weight down onto his prone body. “Oh, gods,” he moaned, spreading his long, slender thighs, pushing up with his feet flat on the sofa cushions. Harry reached between them, finding Draco’s hardness with the palm of his hand and stroking him firmly.
“Amazing,” Potter finished, hand moving around Draco’s nape, fingers spearing into his hair behind his ear. He was stroking his scalp, and Draco closed his eyes, leaning into the touch.
“Our ancestors believed the people must help the Light to be reborn, by honoring this time of darkness. They were to watch and wait, holding hope in their hearts. The return of the light was not taken for granted. And the magical people never forgot how their very lives depended on its return, for all energy comes of the light, and all magic of the energy. While the wizards waited, they prayed and feasted. They decorated their homes so that the new light would find welcome and beauty in the new year. They exchanged gifts with one another in honor of the life-giving gift of the increasing light.”
The senior investigators were good, but they had nothing on Hermione Weasley. And Harry knew a direct threat when he read one.
“Oh, Gods, Draco. Do you think this might actually be over?” Harry looked so hopeful Draco thought he could wait until later to remind him that Bernard had cautioned it might take more than one treatment.
“Of course you’re allowed to be concerned. You wouldn’t be you if you weren’t. And my mental health is fine. I’m just tired of the hospital.”
Harry frowned. “Everyone disapproved, Hermione, save for you and the Weasleys. Everyone in fucking Britain thought they were entitled to an opinion.”
A slow, feline smile curled across Pansy’s lips.  “I’ve found this perfectly charming country house for a potential client: a potential client who’s of vast interest to you.”
She looked intrigued, and when he began to question her, she was a veritable font of information. He found the location in Ottery, bought the building where he now sat and hired as many experienced staff as he could, including Padma to teach the three-year olds and Molly as his lunch lady. When he gave his notice to Kingsley, he hadn’t regretted it for a moment. Now, he had the best staff, at least as far as he was concerned, in all of Britain.
Andromeda frowned slightly. “You don’t understand, Harry,” she said carefully. “As Teddy’s godfather, you need to be involved in this as well. Your role makes it necessary for you to attend at least three of the celebrations.”
Scorpius bit the head off of biscuit number four. “Dad, have you ever considered challenging your sentence?”
He looked at Draco, who shrugged. “You know I don’t care. Breaking and entering are part of my regular Death Eater routine.” He gave Mrs. Figg a pointed look and she startled both of them by laughing aloud.
“Well, you see,” Draco went on, holding onto his friendly tone with an effort, “I own the business across the street, and a few days ago, an owl delivered this--,” he held out the drawing, “--to my place of business. I’m quite certain in error.” She looked down at the piece of parchment, her lips pursed. A myriad of fine lines formed around her tight mouth. “Would this be the original design you commissioned for your grandson’s birthday cake?”
Harry made a face. “Remember him? ‘Took me two years not to have nightmares about the old bastard after I retired.”
Harry glanced to the side, and the fleeting glimpse he caught of Malfoy’s pleased smile was enough to make his breath catch.
"So it does." She looked around the huge room, at the aides working the floor, watching a few more carefully than others. Government at work. "When is he due in?"
“You know, you’re freaking me out a bit here, Potter. But now I’ll never sleep tonight for curiosity if I don’t go with you. I won’t lie,” he studied Harry’s face, “I don’t like the idea particularly.”
“There was a time when I used curses without knowing what they did,” Harry countered, somber. “Fortunately, we’re no longer sixteen.”
He heard the wrought iron gates clang shut behind him, and still they held onto one another in a desperately tight embrace. He’d missed her, but he didn’t realize how much until that moment, when he felt the softness of her hair on his face and smelled the scent of flowers raising from her curls. She still used the same shampoo, and the thought warmed him. She finally lifted her head and stepped back, rubbing at her pink cheeks with her gloved hands.
“It won’t hurt, I promise.” He made a ‘cross my heart’ motion, and she grudgingly held out her arm. He gently pushed up the sleeve of her coat and pressed the vial to her wrist where veins and arteries intersected. He tapped it with his wand and murmured
She paused, her hand tightening on his arm when he offered it to her. His eyes lifted to hers, and he saw that one of her graceful brows was arched. “You’re nervous,” she whispered. “Would you care to tell me why?”
“I can’t hope to divine why you do anything,” Malfoy snapped. Harry got the feeling it was more of a knee jerk reaction than actual anger, but apparently he still had knee jerk reactions of his own when it came to this man; Malfoy was irritating the shit out of him.
Teddy, ever gregarious, grabbed Neville’s hand, and Neville seemed delighted to lead him up to the school. Draco came even with Harry and caught his arm.
He led the way toward a door in the rear of the car, and they walked through a galley kitchen and passed a sleeping area with berths on each side. Then they were in the back of the car, and Draco hit a button next to a stainless steel door. It whoosed open and Draco stepped out onto a narrow deck that hung from the rear of the car over the train tracks. He turned and looked back at Harry, who was lingering inside the open door.
“We seem to be the first to arrive, but I know Rosie is planning to come, along with some others. I think it’s a wonderful idea. These kids visit their businesses every Hogsmeade weekend. It might be nice for them to see them as people.”
“Of course, of course,” Gerry said. “Would he fancy some tea, or is he unable to handle it on his own?”
“No, it’s all right,” Draco said. If Pansy floo’d and Pen was sick, Draco would be beside himself with concern. He sat up beside him, grimacing and adjusting himself in his trousers. He was still uncomfortably hard, but that was fading fast. Damnit. “Find out.”
," Draco said with a meaningful look. "Shall we start this little bit of theatre now? Because that woman is one of the biggest gossips on the board of St Mungo's, and she's well enough connected everywhere that she can give it all a bit of a kick start."
“Sleep. Like ‘dis.” He laid his head back to the side, closed his eyes and made a loud snoring noise. Harry bit down on a laugh.
Kreacher looked even more affronted. “Kreacher would not let anyone in his Mistress’ home. Kreacher is a good house elf. Kreacher would guard it with…”
Harry stared into her warm brown eyes, feeling the weight of Draco’s gaze on the side of his face. “It’s okay with you?”
Draco appeared to be fighting down an amused, if slightly nervous, smile. Harry’s heart lifted to peek around his ribcage, wondering if it was safe to come out, or if it should duck behind his spine and hide indefinitely.
“Good, you’re here,” she said briskly, busting into the room, studying a sheaf of papers in her hand.  “I’ve only a few minutes.  Come with me into the office.”
Harry straightened. “I’m okay to go on.” He pushed away from the window, then glanced back. And went still, staring. After a moment, laughing. Ron turned and within moments, joined him.
“I think,” Draco pulled a book from the shelf, handing it to Harry, “that there are conversations we need to have, Potter, if you’re amenable.”
Draco propped his head on his hand. "Fortunately, the team pays for that." He kissed Harry's fingers when they skimmed over his mouth.
Bernard gave him a look that told Draco he knew he was deflecting, but he let it go with a slight smile.
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
He laid his hand on the door, just long enough to enter the house, then paused inside and pressed his palm to the inside of the door, resetting the wards. It was cool and dim in the house, and he could smell beeswax and floor polish. A glimpse into his uncharacteristically spotless sitting room told him that Whimsy had spent a busy day making his home so immaculate it was unrecognizable. Throw pillows were neatly placed on the leather sofa, perfect indentations in the tops of each one; Molly’s knitted afghans were neatly draped over chairs. The wooden floors and the heavy, intricately carved staircase to the next floor shone.
“There is that.” She took one of the loaded carts and one of the volunteers, and wheeled it off down the long hallway.
Kingsley shifted self-consciously. “A brilliant twenty-one-year-old, as we’ve previously established.”
“Oh, speaking of the train,” she said, looking at Harry. “Teddy is coming to dinner. I thought you’d like to spend another evening with him before he went home, perhaps without his ‘mates’.” She smiled.
Hermione gasped and Ron stared, dumbstruck. Draco threw his napkin onto the tabletop and stood; long legs planted. Harry stared up at him.
Harry linked their fingers and looked at their hands; his fingers shorter, darker and thicker, workman’s hands, and Draco’s; long, elegant, graceful, as aristocratic as he was. “Tell me the rest,” Harry prodded gently.
“Oh, Christ.” He heard Harry from somewhere far away, and then he was shaking and Draco felt warm wetness splash against his lower belly and he had no idea if it was his or Harry’s. He only knew that Harry’s hand was still milking them, and he was shaking and gasping, and instinctively, Draco encircled his hard body with his arms as Harry shuddered through his own orgasm.
“I want you to ask yourself; what possible reason could Ernie have to do this? You’re friends, aren’t you?”
Blaise took a sip of his brandy, clearly stalling. Finally, he set the snifter aside and linked his fingers. "You also know how much dear Pans likes to drink at those events."
“Stop.” Harry went to her and pulled her into a one armed hug. “Stop. I’m guessing that the reason you’re all here is that you managed to throw up a tracking spell, which in the time you had, couldn’t have been done by someone stupid. So stop.” He kissed her temple. “It’s fine.”
"What did you do?" Harry asked, alarm slipping into his chest. He loved her, but she had a tendency to surprise him with things occasionally, usually something he didn't want to do. Things she knew he'd say no to.
“I have,” Harry acknowledged, presenting the wine first.  Draco looked at the basket, and then the label, his brows arching.
Harry managed, just, not to curl his lips. He leaned forward, his eyes on Dennis’s, and allowed him to rub his hand up and down his erection, his eyes all but rolling in need and arousal, the wand in his other hand beginning to waver. He leaned into Harry’s touch, and when Harry’s hand drifted lower and found his balls, Dennis moaned in delight. He was so enraptured, he never saw what was coming.
“So, tattooing,” Malfoy said, returning to Harry’s question.  “The truth?” Harry nodded, genuinely curious. “I was looking for someone to remove the Dark Mark. I think I’d have tried to carve it out myself if I hadn’t found McDowell, I hated it so much.”
“Wait, you mean I’ve not wandered onto the Manor grounds somehow?” He looked around at the other people on the rink. “Although I should have known; all of these Muggles would never be tolerated on the grounds of the family estate. And gee,” Harry pretended to look around, “Not a peacock anywhere.”
He wondered about that now, running his hand absently over his slightly rough jaw. Ginny had made several cracks about his fixation with blonds over the years; he wondered if she’d long known something he was only beginning to figure out. Malfoy, he thought with a grunt. Huh.
Harry unbuttoned his coat, slipping it from his shoulders and laying it on top of Draco’s. It was both gratifying and arousing the heated way Draco’s eyes moved over his dark slacks and long-sleeved, fitted shirt. He took the seat opposite him at the small table, and a waitress approached almost immediately.
Harry heard Hermione’s soft gasp behind him, and felt Narcissa come to stand just to his left, but he couldn’t take his eyes off of the gleaming circle, swinging slightly from the silver chain.
“Good. Let’s move Monty upstairs and find Miss Olivia some pajama’s, shall we? We may as well make her as comfortable as possible.” He pinned Potter with a look. “You do know how to change a child into jammies, do you not?”
"I can manage a decent bolognaise, you know," he complained, but he couldn't really disagree. And who knew? Maybe there'd be trifle for dessert. After a Hogwarts dinner, his request that Al join him on a walk around the lake wouldn't even seem weird. "But I see your point. So – thank you for the invitation."
“Al and Jamie would have loved it, too,” Lily added enthusiastically. “I saw it this morning, and I thought it was wonderful.”
Malfoy’s eyes frosted over. “Then perhaps you should put it someplace where everyone and their brother can’t see it.”
She and Kingsley stared at one another, and he finally huffed and looked away, opening the middle drawer in his massive desk. He reached in and withdrew an envelope. Harry could see a hunter green wax seal, could even make out the distinctive ‘M’ from across the desk. He recognized it instantly; he’d only seen it twice before, but he’d never forget it.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “What mitigating factors? I’d really love it if the two of you would stop talking in circles.”
She nodded, dipping her head so her wavy hair masked her face, but Harry had seen the sheen of tears in her eyes, and they made him feel helpless, and complicit. After all, it wasn't someone else fucking Draco Malfoy in those photos. But the little voice that sounded so like Draco was no longer quiet; it bellowed.
George nodded sagely. “Well, I’m glad the older girls are out of the house. The last thing I need is them following you around and sighing. They do entirely enough of that over the older boys as it is.” He shook his head. “It’s damned irritating. I wasn’t designed to deal a mild epidemic, let alone teenaged hormones.”
“No, it’s all right, Whimsy. You have as much invested in this as we do. Please,” Draco gave her an encouraging look, “stay.”
“No, I’m all right. I apologize if I’ve seemed inattentive, Smithers.” He lifted his head and met her eyes. “I’ve a lot on my mind, but I’ll try to concentrate better after break.”
"Cheeky bastard," he muttered as he dropped the phone into his briefcase, but when he stood and closed it with a snap, he was smiling.
Just as he’d thought. There were two figures near the rear of the room, the taller, more masculine shaped one leaning against a heavy wooden desk, the shorter, curvier one leaning in against him. The boy had removed his shirt and Harry frowned when he recognized the pale shoulders and the thick head of russet curls.
“There was only the one son, and he died in infancy.” Draco smirked. “She thought the name too common to add. I think she was embarrassed they were related on her side instead of the Blacks. ‘Wouldn’t surprise me if a wayward Prentice married a Muggle born.”
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
will affix it to that beast’s leg. The only way I’d go near that animal was if I was stuffing and roasting it for Christmas dinner.”
“I’ve a plan,” George said, pulling out his seat as Harry gently lowered Rosie into a battered wooden high chair. “Everyone can quit their jobs at the Ministry and come to work at Wheezes. We can start a ginger mafia, with me as godfather. Well, mostly ginger.” He grinned at Harry. “You and your albino as exceptions.”
, had gone back without question. He’d been twenty-four, lost and without a direction other than his father’s assertion that he had to marry and beget an heir. Merry became his friend and mentor, taught him everything she knew and then left him the business when she’d died six years before. Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy fortune, such as it was, and pureblood back generations, had taken up a trade and hadn’t looked back since.
"That's what I'm afraid of," Harry muttered, but he lifted his hips and tore open his flies before making short work of Draco's. When he took out Draco's long, curved, beautiful cock, he stroked the length of it reverently. "The most beautiful fucking cock I've ever seen in my life."
Harry rubbed his fingers over his jaw, grimacing when he felt the stiff stubble. It didn’t matter how often he shaved, and he’d shaved both that morning and right before he and Hermione left for London. (He wasn’t going to examine why he’d felt the need to shave twice that day). He sighed. “Do we assume the snake faced bastard is still fucking with our lives, all these years later?”
"Oh, fuck off," Harry muttered back, and he heard Ron laugh as he released his grip on Harry's robes and patted him on the shoulder.
at her. Lily Potter had none of the rough edges that being raised the youngest with six brothers had left on Ginevra. And she had green eyes, eyes that were exactly the same shade as her father’s that held nothing but an easy, open friendliness. That was perhaps the biggest difference; he couldn’t remember a time when Ginny Weasley had looked at him in any way other than that she wanted to hex him.
"Pervert," Draco teased, swaying slightly on his feet and reaching out for something to brace on. Harry grabbed his forearms, steering him the short distance until the small of his back rested against one of the two red leather armchairs. He took Draco's prick in his hand and stroked him slowly, pressing his nose into the thick thatch of pale hair at his groin. He inhaled and made a low sound in his throat, and Draco pulled sharply on a skein of his hair. "What the fuck are you sniffing?"
at the hospital, he felt completely, utterly at peace. It had been a long time since he’d felt that way.
Haltingly at first, he told her. He told her about all of the memories Bernard extracted from Harry’s head, beginning when he was fifteen months old. Apparently “Dudders”, who Draco wanted to turn into a warthog, didn’t like Brussels sprouts but his mother made them anyway, for every fucking special occasion. For at least a week after any celebratory meal, like Christmas or birthdays, they were all that was left over. Therefore, they were all Harry was allowed to eat. When he was four or five, eating nothing but the little green vegetable gave him stomach cramps and diarrhea. Draco didn’t think he’d ever hated anyone in his life as much as he hated Petunia Dursley. Dudley was a bully and the fat uncle was a boor, but Petunia was evil, forcing a child to eat nothing but greens and then locking him in a cupboard away from the loo overnight. Draco wanted to kill her, slowly and painfully.
“Did I?” He winked at Harry. “That’s what old age will do to you; you can’t recognize your own children.”
When he opened his eyes, the room was dimly lit by a pair of hurricane lamps on a sideboard and the fire in the fireplace. He could see through the window, and the thick snow was tinted blue with lavender streaks from the setting sun.  It looked cold, but he was pleasantly warm beneath the soft throw Molly made for him. He didn’t remember pulling it up and tucking it around his shoulders, but he must have.  He stretched cautiously, trying to gage the pain in his leg. The low throbbing that had been there since the regrowing session was still there, and added to it now was tightness, as if he’d lain in one position for too long. He could tell it was time for a pain potion and his stomach reminded him loudly that he hadn’t had anything but a poached egg since seven o’clock that morning. He rolled to his back, wincing when the muscle in his thigh pulled. He definitely needed that potion.
Potter smiled at him then, and pulled him closer, resting their foreheads together. “She'll come around,” he sighed, closing his eyes.
“It’s this way.” He gestured, then turned and walked toward the corner of the blocky, two story house. “We get sun nearly all day on this side. They don’t look like much yet, but by July we’ll have the best tomato and courgette plants in Ottery. Just don’t tell Molly Weasley I said that.”
why I came here tonight, you vicious bitch. Because my mother's had a letter from my horror of a niece, telling her all about it. The scuttlebutt is your son's been caught in the curse, courtesy of
Draco gave a shattered cry, writhing under Harry's hands. The muscles around Harry's cock were so tight it was almost painful, and Harry groaned. He continued to move, feeling his own release growing in his balls. The heat and the constriction held for several thrusts, then Draco shuddered and collapsed over the back of the chair. The muscles around Harry relaxed, and freed from the constraint he straightened and fucked Draco without rhythm or grace until his arousal burst, and he came so hard he quaked through it, conscious thought of anything but the spilling, wrenching, soul emptying orgasm suspended. Eyes clenched shut, fingers digging into Draco's hips so hard there could only be marks, Harry moved through a series of aftershocks, grunting softly, then collapsed heavily on Draco's back.
Draco looked incredulous. "Tea?" he managed calmly. "Why is it that everyone in this sodden country thinks their problems can be solved with bloody tea? You called me here, you wanker, and you look like twenty kilo's of shite warmed over."
"But for my signature, and I can sign it for you." And then Harry's mouth was rushing on, as if independent of his head. He just wanted everything that might come between them out. "They caught MacIntosh today. He's in Edinburgh."
“It’s all right. Just don’t be too specific,” he gestured towards Teddy with his head, and Hermione nodded.
Draco smile ripened. “So it would seem.” He gave Harry another shallow nod, then walked out through the door.
Harry inhaled harshly, then felt as if he actually might need the chair in front of her desk. He locked his knees instead, his hand going out to brace on a bookcase. Shock made his ears ring.
Caruthers, who Harry thought was probably responsible for what he and his boyfriend were wearing, had on a fitted suit in a very…unusual design. The background looked to be burgundy with berries, green bells running in neat lines from his shoulders to the burgundy trainers on his feet. Even his tie was same fabric, lined up perfectly with his jacket. Holmsby stood next to him, gamely holding his hand, wearing a similarly tailored suit, only his was bright red with green trees and snowmen tumbling over the surface of the fabric. His trainers were black, and the two of them over all took the prize for standing out in a crowd.
“Healer,” O’Henry replied. “This is Healer Clover. We became well acquainted when I was in Magical Law Enforcement. Best man there is in accidental spell damage. How goes, it Ben?”
He could see the subdued expression on his friend's face, and when Hermione came through behind him, her own expression grim, alarm roared through his chest.
“I can’t imagine you haven’t already figured this out,” Harry said, his voice dropping in timbre until it even felt lower in his throat. “I haven’t been able to keep a secret from you in a year and a half.” Draco stared at him, his head cocked to one side in confusion, and Harry smile. “No? Well, Snape did a better job of occlumency lessons that he ever knew.” He stared into Draco’s wide eyes, took a deep breath. “If someone had told me when we were back at school that someday you would be the most important person in my life, I’d have told them they were mental.” He slipped Draco’s gloves into an inside pocket in his cape, then reached into his own pocket where he’d put the small box. “A year and a half ago, when you repaired my back, and we were still sniping at each other, I’d have still thought they were mental. And then this – astonishing thing happened. It’s amazing how things can change, isn’t it? The truth is, I can’t imagine living even a minute of the rest my life without you. I fell in love with you, and I still love you so much it takes my breath. That being said,” he dropped slowly to one knee, and Draco’s expression went from confused to wide eyed comprehension, “Draco Malfoy, will you do me the honor of becoming my husband?” He opened the box and held it out, and the platinum band caught and reflected the light of a thousand candles.
"That will be fine, then. Auror's don't much mind where we eat, as long as we get to eat." He nodded to Justin and went to speak to the detail.
“Well, sure. But what I got is just scribblin’ in a bunch of dusty log books. I doubt it’ll tell you anything other than what I just did.”
"So why is it that the first time we're alone in a room, we're all over each other?" Harry asked, watching Draco's expression carefully.
Harry reached forward and grabbed his hand. “I know that,” he said firmly. “I chased you, remember?”
“It’s a kind of ice cream, Rosie,” he said, and she turned to look at him. “Frozen stiff, have you ever heard that?” She nodded eagerly. “That’s why they’re called stiffies.”
The kettle began to sing on the hob, and Harry took down a plain white tea pot and filled an infuser with loose black tea leaves. Pouring the boiling water into the pot, he set the infuser inside the top and covered it with the lid, setting the timer on his microwave for three minutes. He went to the fridge and took out milk; if he was going to drink tea, he was going to drink it the way he liked it, with so much sugar and milk Ron said he ‘liked a little tea with his milk’. Harry actually preferred coffee, probably because his Aunt Petunia had forced him to make her tea from the time he’d been old enough to stand on a stool and pour. When Ron teased him, Harry casually flipped him two fingers, not the least disturbed by his friend taking the piss. He did think it was ridiculous when the bloody
Harry should have anticipated that; she was Narcissa Malfoy’s sister, after all, and he had no trouble imagining Narcissa doing the same to wind Draco up, not after the way she’d teased him the other day. He looked at the jumper again, and the knitted depiction of copulating reindeer.
“Two more bloody seconds,” he huffed, staring at the hawthorn wand still buzzing on the nightstand. “Two more bloody, fucking seconds…”
“I see that.” Harry smiled at him. He very much wanted to tousle his hair, but didn’t think mussing him would be appreciated.
“And you look good with your prick out and hard.” Draco leaned forward, slowly opening his mouth over the heavy muscle just above Harry’s hip bone, sucking hard.
“You never met Tonks?” he asked, easing the coat off of Draco's shoulders and laying it over a nearby chair.  The wooden box in the pocket clunked softly, and Potter shot him an curious look.
“The fuck it doesn’t,” he snapped. “I bet it matters to Ron. This isn’t your fault, and it isn’t your responsibility to fix it.”
Harry turned back to Draco, leaning forward, dropping his voice to a low murmur. “Draco,” he said. “Did you hear what Hermione said?” Draco blinked, then nodded shallowly. “The only way we’ll know anything for sure is if you let her look at the ring.”
He held up both hands as he remembered why the saying sounded familiar. “No, no. I remember. And hearing that come out of your mouth might take ten years off my life.”
“Hermione Granger-Weasley,” he announced, and waited until a homey kitchen appeared. “Granger,” he called when she didn’t immediately appear. “Where in hell are you?”
"Merlin, that mouth," he panted when he pulled back. "At some point I'm going to want to put that to use."
“Yay!!” Teddy threw his arms around Draco’s neck again, squeezing tight, and Draco wrapped his arms around him, hugging him back. “This is going to be the best Christmas, ever!!”
you are,” Draco teased. Harry grinned, then pushed him gently in the middle of his chest, pushing him down onto his back. He ran his hands from Draco’s shoulders, down over his chest, his thumbs pausing to stroke pale pink nipples that instantly rose up under his touch. Draco closed his eyes, his back arching.
Harry rang the bell and heard it echo through the big house. A cold breeze lifted his fringe and tousled his hair, and he stuck his hands into the pockets of the black hoodie and hunched his shoulders, shivering. A moment later, he heard quick footsteps approaching from the other side of the door, and it was opened to reveal a middle-aged woman wearing a smart suit, her dark hair pulled to her nape in a soft chignon.
She poked him in the ribs and grinned when he flinched. Stepping back, she pulled her hat from her hair and smoothed down static lifted strands. “I’m meeting Gramma here. She’s going to show me how to make bread.”
It wasn’t as if the memories were gone, Harry told Draco once the treatment was well under way. It was just that they were muted, and no longer had the power to hurt him. Those were the only words that had kept Draco from searching out Petunia Dursley and hexing her into a steaming pile of hippogriff dung. He never told Harry that was his intention, but he’d had very active fantasies about it. But Bernard had been successful, and all Draco cared about was that his happy, healthy green-eyed lover was back where he belonged. And Draco wasn’t in Azkaban; he had to count that as a plus.
He didn’t know what he’d been expecting of the wing where Draco lived with Teddy, but it certainly wasn’t the pleasant mix of modern and antique that confronted him as he walked slowly down the hall.  There were portraits on the wall that looked as if they were from an earlier time, but none of them even remotely looked like a Malfoy. They smiled in a friendly manner, or curtsied or bowed, but they didn’t really invite conversation. The walls weren’t marble or stone but light, honey toned wood and the floors were covered with plush, beige carpet up to the six inch edge of gray slate that lined the baseboards. There were antique sideboards scattered along the walls, enormous poinsettias in white ceramic pots, and pine fronds with red velvet bows hung from the wall sconces, filling the air with their fresh, redolent scent. It was beautiful, and Harry felt a deep sense of pleasure as he moved along. This was as unlike the mausoleum Draco’s parents had lived in as it was possible to get. It was also like a glimpse into who Draco was now; understated, elegant.
Harry laughed. “Have you ever even tried to bake biscuits?” The disgruntled twist of Malfoy’s lips was the only answer Harry was going to get. “Well, you can relax. Molly Weasley made them. There’s prune danish and buns with whipped butter in the pantry too, if you’re interested.”
Draco turned as Amelia entered the room. Immediately he knew something was wrong; the alarm in her eyes was unmistakable. “What is it?”
Trying to recall what had brought him to where he was, he had a vague recollection of being on the bike, taking off from the ramp. He remembered the exhilaration, how he’d wanted to go higher and higher. As if in answer to his thoughts, the bike accommodated him and soared and the crowd screamed, unable to believe the height as he began to flip in the air. He felt so free, the magic flowing through his veins, making his heart feel too big for his chest. Then to his horror, he realized he was too high, and that it was magic making him soar. The moment he realized it, the moment fear of discovery roared through him, his upward trajectory altered and gravity took over. He remembered the bike feeling like a rock between his thighs, pulling him down, the ground rushing up. He remembered trying to protect his face and head, forgetting there was a helmet there to do the job. After that, he remembered nothing.
When he’d begun to protest, Draco had touched his arm. “It’s all right,” he murmured. “You know I’m an utter attention whore.” His smile widened. “Cut him some slack. You’re good for business.”
“Oh, my,” he heard Hermione breathe, but he didn’t glance her way. He was staring at Draco, trying to recall when he’d ever seen anything to compare to him in his life. He couldn’t think of a single thing.
"Well," he said finally, slouching in his chair but carefully not making eye contact with anyone. "Should you care to go into porn, Minister, you should be able to earn that kickback without any problem. I'd really never considered what to do after quidditch, but it's nice to know I have a viable option."
Ron plopped on the other end of the sofa, a liberally iced and sprinkled cookie in his hand.  Ginny shook her head, her lip curling.
“So, spit it out,” she’d said after Draco had missed the punch line to her oh so very amusing story about her mother and her hideous new sitting room curtains.
“What, the man says.” Draco’s mouth pulled down at the corners. “The man’s post-coital shudders haven’t even stopped, and he’s performing wandless magic.”
Draco leaned forward, crossing his long legs. He was wearing loose black lounging trousers and a white jumper, and his hair touched the high collar and fanned across his forehead. The fit of the knitted top accentuated how angular his frame was at the moment, but his color was good and his eyes were bright.
Harry shook his head even as his lips pulled slightly to the side. The man was a prickly arsehole, but he was also resilient as hell.
There was an awkward silence, and Harry looked over to find Ron scratching his chin, looking uncomfortable. “Well, that would be Gin’s daughter, Harry. Alice.”
“Do you talk all the time?” Harry asked against Draco’s skin, humor thick in his voice. “God, you taste good.”
He didn’t have an answer. And now, as he strode through the snow in the shadow of Big Ben, he still didn’t have one.
Draco blinked.  “Well.”  He wasn't sure exactly what to say to that.  “I thought it was only my friends who felt the need for wholly inappropriate and invasive lines of questioning.”
Ginny stared down at him when they were done, picking up a cloth from the bedside table and taking it to the sink to dampen it.  She came back, tenderly wiping it over his face, then down his neck. “He looks terrible,” she whispered. “And he’s never this still.”
“I’m the best man,” he announced, and delighted laughter flowed through the room. Ginny and Luna pushed forward, babbling their delight, but McGonagall raised her hand, palm out and silence fell again. “Decorum, ladies and gentleman, if you please.” She straightened and looked at Harry and Draco. “Dearly beloved,” she said again, “we are gathered here to celebrate the marriage of Harry James Potter and Draco Abraxas Malfoy…”
with him, and he’d keep me appraised of what was going on in his world. And through all of it, our Mum…” He shook his head. “She just never could seem to get over the fact her son had been gifted with what she herself had so desperately wanted. She never seemed to take into consideration the same thing had happened to me.”
It had been years since Harry had been to London at Christmas time. He’d come with the Weasley’s when he was still school age, but they took the floo. (Fortunately he got better at that with age and never ended up in Knockturn Alley again.)
Qye blinked as he realized how dark it had become. The sun had settled behind the mountains encompassing Hogwarts, a dark violet the only remnants of its light, the combined blue and black of the night sky settling in.
Harry shifted uneasily, thinking about everything Draco had just told him.  He glanced around, wondering if the vampire had been nearby and heard any of it.
Harry could tell this from the moment he stepped around the corner to go to the Potions classroom with the other Gryffindors only to find Malfoy and his gang of Slytherin friends lounging near the entrance to the classroom.
“Wouldn’t what?” Harry asked, still completely confused and a little more than frustrated.  He glanced at Malfoy, who raised a pale eyebrow in question at him.  The Gryffindor shrugged slightly.
It had been two weeks since she had updated her brother on events going on here and she thought that she might as well send another report.  ‘
The nurse had eyed them and when she had reached for Harry to guide him back to Smethwyck, Qye unceremoniously wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and helped him up, giving the woman the flattest look he could.
"I'll do it," a voice suddenly spoke from next to him and Harry turned loving, grateful, worshiping eyes to Hermione, who straightened up, brown eyes determined. She caught his gaze and gave him a small smile. The smile was replaced with an exasperated look when the others around them whispered their thanks. Zabini, still hiding Parvati and Parkinson, rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath how he should have known she'd be the one to take charge.
’  Then he stopped thinking, nervously remembering that his cousin had a stronger Jewel and could read his thoughts.
Ron took Hermione’s hand from Harry as she muttered quickly under her breath about which spell to use and how long he’d been jinxed and whether they’d be docked points for hexing Malfoy outside of school.  Harry uncertainly lowered his hand to the table, warily keeping an eye between her and Malfoy.
:: he said slowly as he watched Snape write up the instructions for the internal bleeding healing potion.  He felt Qye raise his attention from his memories where he had been flipping through.  ::
“We saw him from the Gryffindor Tower,” Ron interrupted suddenly. Marylin blinked and looked at him, blinking again when she saw the wary look he was giving her brother, who narrowed his own eyes at the younger boy. “We saw him walking there and were running because we didn’t want to miss him.” Hermione stared at him.
He couldn’t see anything, the Great Hall had disappeared and there was nothing to see.   He wasn’t afraid though.  In the back of his mind, he felt like he should be but he wasn’t.  There was nothing, no feeling, no sight…just pure darkness.  There was nothing but the dark…and then he saw the blue eyes.
“It’s protocol,” Wainscott shrugged.  “There always has to be a consistent trail of documentation otherwise there might be challenges to treatments and decisions later that could cost more time and create difficulties.”
Voldemort laughed, high pitched and cold.  “Death is hardly enough for the boy, don’t you think?  Clearly it does not agree with him after so many attempts.”  He turned to Harry and Marylin caught a glimpse of fear and anger in Harry’s eyes as the vampire pushed him closer.
“Don’t spoil them, Dazain,” a familiar high-pitched voice hissed as Harry continued to stare at the mangled mess and stained skin of the beasts’ faces and ragged claws. The cold voice suddenly began to break up. “…them ready…controlled…like your prisoners…”
Qye looked over, his jaw clenching as he saw Lest looking away from him, his dark blue eyes meeting Harry’s own while the others looked uncertainly between them.  He saw Sirius frowning, glancing at Harry, looking at Qye again and Qye looked down quickly, gripping onto Harry’s shoulder.
“The sessions are only part of the support they require,” she said, meeting his gaze evenly.  “They need to be able to encounter and access support in their own environment outside of the therapeutic process if they ever truly wish to be independent.”
“I’m not talking about the fight!” Draco snapped, gray eyes flashing at him.  “You took my wand when I tried to help – ”
When he turned back to Draco, Harry blinked as he noticed that the smirk had faded and the other boy was gazing at him with a hard to read look in his eyes.  He met that look quizzically but didn’t manage to say anything before the other boy spoke again.
His brow furrowed. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a fever. Maybe when he was a kid but otherwise…
“Harry!” barked Hermione suddenly from next to him and he jumped, turning in his seat to look wide-eyed at the stern-looking witch.  “That plate isn’t enough to get you through the day,” she said, glaring at him.  “You’re thin enough as it is and if that’s how you plan on eating for the rest of year, it’s going to harm your O.W.L. scores extremely!  Everyone knows you need to have a well-balanced breakfast to keep your mind active enough to concentrate on your studies and a couple of bites of scrambled eggs aren’t going to be enough!”
The carriage stopped and the door barely opened before Sirius shot out, bounding for the castle while leaving his friend with the vampire.
Harry reluctantly turned his gaze from the door and cleared his throat.  He turned to face her fully and said, “I was wondering if you could help me with something.”
“Truly astounding you’ve been able to stay undercover this long, Black,” Snape drawled, his black eyes glinting.  “I can hardly see the difference between your mongrel self and the canine form you assume.”
Draco looked at him with his winter eyes again.  “That Lest Opacre is directly responsible for the deaths of 37 vampires, killing 11 of them personally.  He’s also responsible for the death of three wizards, one of them being a cousin of mine and another a child.”  He smiled frigidly at their stunned faces.  “Do the vampires still hold your trust?”
Harry rolled his eyes, pushing back from the wall and reaching into the pocket of the pants.  They were tight and he had barely been able to fit the scrap of parchment, let alone his wand.
Marylin was brought back from her own thoughts by Lest’s quiet voice. Looking up, she saw him looking straight ahead, his cool face revealing nothing. Marylin nodded, lowering her eyes once more.
Harry shifted under his stare, still unused to the upfront manner from the Slytherin.  “What happened to you this summer?” Harry murmured, hardly expecting an answer.
Once it had gone down, the vampires had wasted no time in targeting him as the source and Ron could still remember the Slytherin’s screams from what must have been a painful telepathic assault before Malfoy had knocked him unconscious to spare him.  Terry and Hannah had dragged him back next to Ernie and Justin, their spells faltering as their already tired bodies began to give out.
He read the journal, his guilt fading every night he spent reading it.  With such a thin book, he hadn't thought there would be so much writing.  But, Merlin, was he wrong.  The book was obviously magical as well because there was no way there could be so many entries in such a small book.  Throughout the late nights of November he had pored over the journal entries, only daring to bring out the slender book late at night.  Each night that he could, he had read at least one passage, learning more and more about this boy who had hidden things in his cupboard.  Harry idly wondered why he had hidden things there.
They caught up to Hermione and Harry grinned as he heard Ron and Hermione began to bicker, catching “No House pride” and “More to life than fighting.” Stretching his arms slightly, he glanced to the side and watched Dean try to comfort a still gloomy Seamus while Neville looked caught between being sympathetic and panicking himself.
They both looked up when Hermione suddenly shoved aside her Transfiguration text and pulled out a guide, swiftly flipping through it.
He was on his fifth count of 10, his hands pushing hard against the stone, when Harry spoke again.  “What do you figure is going to happen tomorrow?”
’ he thought, his green eyes looking at her.  Sighing, he turned away and jogged up to catch up to his best friends.  ‘
They walked to the Gryffindor table and Harry smiled as he noticed some of his Housemates waving cheerfully in welcome.
he screamed and willed himself to grab the handle.  He felt Qye’s shock for a brief moment, the control over his body faltering as his hand latched on before Qye snapped back and his body froze again.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and Harry couldn’t resist sliding his hands from his shoulders up his neck, thumbing across one still warm cheek before sliding through the soft strands of his loose hair.
Even though it was barely two months into the school year, the professors in their classes piled homework upon homework every class and the fifth years were barely managing.  Harry knew he was hardly scraping by and he was slightly surprised he could keep up with Quidditch practice at the same time.  Katie Bell had been elected as the new Gryffindor Captain and, although she wasn’t as obsessed or demanding as Wood, she kept a tight and strenuous schedule.  The exhaustion from schoolwork and Quidditch along with restless sleep…no wonder Ron and Hermione made him promise to go to bed early.
“Oi! Harry!” Ron called out over the heads of the first years.  “Do you want to get locked out of the Tower?  Come on!”  The redhead scowled at his brothers who had began make cracks about how much he was sounding like Percy.
he thought mentally, smirking inwardly. On the outside, he frowned slightly at the blonde woman. “You realize,” he said nonchalantly, “I’m still here.”
“Yes, well,” Snape continued, his lips curling into an unpleasant smile.  “Until that happy day comes, I have to continue to deal with you all.  And I have decided – and at Dumbledore’s request as well – that in order to try and make some of you not make me look an incompetent teacher in the O.W.L. exams, I will decide where you all sit.”  He picked up his parchment.  “In other words, seating chart.”
A tinge of resignation was in his face but when she questioningly touched his arm, the emotions bled away to an indifferent face and he said nothing more.
“Ron?” Hermione called his name and he turned from glowering at the dance floor – there were the Hufflepuffs, little smitten looks on their faces as they looked at Malfoy and Harry – to glowering at Malfoy as Hermione and Harry continued to look quite confused.
The tendrils snapped and Harry was hurled back into the light world where everything was blurry and thousands of faces swarm above him and people shouted and cried in frightened and worried voices.
Something grabbed his shoulder and he instinctively moved his wand, mouth forming a fire spell before he recognized the pale face and hair.
He felt Qye’s anger, his rage, and did not fight as he felt the strangeness in his body, a distance.
:: Qye said a slightly sharp voice.  Harry felt the other’s eyes narrow slightly – he shivered slightly at the feeling – and the boy continued.  ::
“Only when your lives start to impact mine,” Zabini said blandly.  He wrinkled his nose slightly.  “Never thought you and Weasleys would ever be so cozy.”
As if summoned by his idle thoughts, he heard the only door to the room open and looked up from checking the  physical monitoring data to see Minister Fudge sweep in, clutching his bowler hat while Headmaster Dumbledore followed behind.
he thought mournfully as he cut up his dandelion stems.  He continued to add in the items, remembering to stir at the correct times.  The class passed in relative silence, the only sounds being the clinking of vials, the soft thuds of knives on desks, the crackle of the fire underneath the cauldron, and the quiet bubbling of the potions.
Draco nodded, gaze darkening.  “Yes.  They’re the other side of this.  My father made advances towards them not long after that ceremony and that’s when we found out about the war that started.  My mother put her foot down as soon as she realized what was going on.  She made my father have me more involved with the Venators instead of a world that was split in half.”
“What the hell is the matter with you, Potter?” Draco snapped, his eyes narrowing dangerously.  “Have you finally lost it?  You’ve been acting strange the entire year and it’s really beginning to piss me off.”
Qye’s eyes widened before he could stop himself.  Harry turned away from him and back to the Mind-Healer with a hard look in his eyes.
Marylin swallowed, her heart suddenly racing at the interested look on the normally disinterested vampire.
“Oh come on,” Hermione snapped.  “Do you really think Dumbledore would hire someone who isn’t trustworthy?”
’ he thought numbly.  He heard Remus walking away, most likely to take a quick shower before him and get rid of all traces of their drinking the night before like a responsible adult.  ‘
"No wand, no fighting techniques sufficient enough to parry me off..." Lest drawled, fingers curling around the wand. He took a step forward and he wasn't even unsteady at all, walking on the watered floor. He stopped, a few feet from where Ron lay on the floor and looked down at the redhead with an unreadable expression.
Harry’s face flamed up even more as all of the Slytherins began to laugh.  Malfoy was laughing as well but for some reason, his laugh didn’t seem to carry the mocking of the others.  It didn’t matter either way.  Trembling from mortification and humility, he dropped his eyes down and turned away from them.
She snorted and nodded to the back of the room.  “No, he decided to go terrify some of your classmates.  Lest – my brother – calls it
The vampire woman sighed and shook her head regretfully.  “One of the areas he lacks a lot in,” she said in a heavy voice.  The blonde looked at him a bit more, a slight frown coming onto her face.  “Are you - ”
.::  As he lifted his head, trying to spot flaming red or bushy brown hair among the sea of heads, he added, ::
"So," she said, straightening up and folding her hands in front of her, she smiled cheerfully at them, "That is why today you will duel against my brother."
As he stepped though the green flames back into his own fireplace, Remus looked up, his face paling.
“Doesn’t matter,” Vernon growled, lurching up from the couch and stalking down the hallway towards the doorway.  “They’re rudding mad and I’ll be giving them a piece of mind for coming to call at such a bloody hour.”
The voice in his head cut off and he heard a cry of pain, opened his eyes in time to see Ernie MacMillian slam his fist into a vampire’s face as Neville nervously muttered a spell, vines similar to Professor Sprout’s erupting from his wand to envelop the dazed vampire.
“Welcome!” Dumbledore beamed at everyone.  The hall immediately became silent.  “I apologize for the wait but some matters had to be taken care of and now that they are, let us proceed with the Sorting.”
After Dumbledore had left, Qye had dutifully attended to the breakfast he was provided, a bowl of oatmeal with various types of berries and a glass of orange juice along with a muffin with peach marmalade.
“Oi, Harry, mate,” Ron said suddenly, leaning across the table to look at him.  “Is that all you’re going to eat?”
Professor Opacre cheered and Harry was pulled from his murderous thoughts to look at her holding up another outfit with a gleam in her eye.  She whirled around and he instinctively flinched.
"Your mum already mothers me and is likely to do so until I'm dead," he muttered. "How much worse could it get?"
Fun fact past Shades went through: I lost count of how many times I looked up Madam Pomfrey's name to make sure I spelled it correctly.
“Don’t take my word for it, you can look it up,” Draco said nonchalantly.   He smiled humorlessly again.  “All the accounts are going to tell you the same thing though.”
There was heat everywhere. Flames licked at his skin, embers burned beneath his skin and he could feel each drop of sweat roll down feverishly with no offer of respite.
Lest whispered as he stared darkly out the window, seemingly more to himself than to her, "I'd rather have him hate me than love him."
He felt her hands still momentarily in his hair, before resuming their gentle glide through the messy strands.
“It would be nice to know what this is,” Ron muttered, grimacing as Hermione shot him a quick, quelling look.  He sighed and nudged Harry’s shoulder wearily.  “You know me, always ready for another adventure.”
'," Harry said automatically because it was just like last year, wasn't it, being pelted with objects by Ron and Hermione in training for the Maze. He didn't even think about it, green eyes glancing only momentarily as the trinkets hit his invisible shield and rebounded, because it was instinct and there were a million other things that were instinct too.
The vampire crashed against his shield and Harry didn’t hesitate, throwing out every offensive spell he knew before the vampire recovered, watching the man dodge around and glancing around for somewhere safe, somewhere secure.
“As well as it could be with me being the only vampire,” her brother drawled sarcastically.  She grinned again.
She thought back to Harry.  She had been relieved to see that he was all right now.  And that surprised her.  She had thought she had only taken a great liking to Harry because he kind of reminded her of Qye, because he might be Qye.  It had made her feel terrible because she didn’t want to like him just because of that.
But Harry hadn’t heard her.  He just stared at the Slytherin table, slightly stunned that his rival was missing.  ‘
Draco glanced over at him, raising an eyebrow.  “It’s the Shrieking Shack,” he said dryly.  A very wry look came upon his face.  “Possibly the same place I miraculously saw your head floating about a couple of years ago.”
He hadn’t heard any screaming or seen any stray curses so he was hoping that Draco and Ron had managed to keep to just insults.  That or one of them had been incredibly stealthy in knocking the other unconscious or immobile.
“You’ve done it once before,” Remus snarled and there was his friend’s ferocity, his anger bristling right alongside Sirius and it didn’t matter that Marylin and Dumbledore were trying to calm them, it didn’t matter that they didn’t have his wands.
Qye said quietly in the lull of battle. Over the blood rushing in his ears Harry could faintly hear a buzz from the class and a murmur from Professor Opacre but his mind was too occupied, too filled with his worries about Qye and a vampire who
"That - that arrogant, arse kissing git!" Ron seethed, scowling at the back of the Slytherin's back.  "Making up comments like that!"  Harry noted that not all the red in his best friend's face was from anger though.
She smiled suddenly, face blooming with a smile of light. Against the somber atmosphere she had created before, it was strange and startling and seemed only more fully emphasized with warmth and kindness.
“Mr. Potter,” she began, looking slightly hesitant, “You’ve been unconscious for almost a week.  Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger have already left for the holidays.  They came and visited you while they were still here but they had to leave.”  Her kind blue eyes looked down in sympathetic sadness at him and he drew his eyes away from her, unwilling to see any form of pity.
It made up for the fact that upon sunset he was cursed into an ugly human shape. Luna the crane said it was the other way around, but honestly, she also insisted that there were pink birds with backwards knees that lived in toxic waters and birds that were taller than men but that couldn't fly. Hermione tried to not talk with the crane, but Ginny was friendly with the obnoxious creature and so was Harry.
The stupid boy not only insisted upon joining Draco and his friends, he rode the sable Andalusian bareback and had him doing jumps and races. From that day on the evil horse kept breaking out of the stables and followed Potter like a dog. At the end of the summer Lord Black ended up paying double Dullahan’s worth so he could stay with Potter.
Henry Potter was a small and sickly child. After his parents died in an ambush by highwaymen after his second birthday he was given to his father’s trusted steward, Remus Lupin, and his custody assigned to the new Lord Sirius Black, his godfather. Lady Lily had also requested that her one trusted companion Master Snape be trusted with her child, but his grief was so great he left and was hired by the Malfoy house to tutor their son.
"Well, obviously, dinner was not suitable for my honored guest." He said with a cruel grin, with a wave of his hand Henry was paralyzed by magic. Dobby arrived back with his brother Brownie, a grumpy looking Kreacher.
He was told that as the storm turned into a cyclone. Then a dark shadow pulled the Lord from the ship in his night clothes and vanished. Then out of the waves the ship was crushed by a sea serpent. The only survivor perished after ensuring that the King’s Guard knew.
It was enough to make Draco completely regret the way he spent every summer trying to hide from Lord Potter or find ways to get him in trouble. He bullied the child like a monster when the boy only needed a friend. No wonder Lord Potter had questioned his enthusiasm during their last meeting.
It wasn’t fair that this stupid quiet mouse of a boy be better at things that Draco had been learning from his father and King Gellert.
"You shouldn't have taken me and cursed me." Henry answered with a mild and cool tone. "So, you do not get to tell me to behave." With that he took a bite of the citrus and basil salad. Kreacher was a very good cook and the light vinaigrette was bright and refreshing.
Draco dragged himself down the hill as he knew he wouldn’t make it back to Potterer’s Refuge in his current condition. The woods were warm compared to what Severus had warned, and the lake was not iced. As he came to the lake he was set upon by two large aggressive white swans and as the sun set a black swan flew over and as it touched the water, the last of the sun’s rays vanished, in a miniature vortex of shadow and feathers, he saw a young man emerge.
"My kind do not dream often, but I've been told dreams in a place with such a high concentration of mystical energy can be fate-touched or bewitched to seek your fears." Voldemort said. His tone was kind but serious, "Be wary."
He watched as the arrogant boy dictated orders, critiqued every shipment and craftsman’s work, and generally made a nuisance of himself. It was all in service of some grand themed party. A masquerade, how romantic. He was planning on making his grand declaration at the stroke of midnight, like it was a children’s tale.
Draco was amazed by the story but also appalled at his elders. No wonder Henry was such a strange child. The boy wasn’t raised by family, the ones who were supposed to have charge of him had dumped him on the help and ran. Did Henry ever have a proper hug from a mom after a nightmare? Was he always in the company of adults unless during the summers spent with Draco?
Once upon a time there were two kingdoms that had finally after generations of icy relations and on and off wars which came together in an agreement for peace to be sealed with the marriage of their two most prominent families. At the time of signing the treaty, King Albus knew that the older Lord Peverell, Charlus Potter, was not happy to marry his teenaged son off but was willing. King Gellert had requested this as a favor to Lord Brutus Malfoy as his son had fallen for an unsuitable bride.
He then morphed into Voldemort and the dagger was plucked out and transformed into a scarlet spider lily.
“Is there anything else? Anything at all?” Henry’s voice had a tremble to it now and Gellert knew he would need to beg Albus for forgiveness, but he couldn’t doom this child to a sham of a relationship.
The governess was instant that a proper child learn the value of labor and as such he was often in the kitchens and scullery from an hour before sunrise to noon. If he completed his allotment of chores he would be granted porridge and water and sent to lessons where he was taught with the gentleness of a drill sergeant by his tutor until well past nightfall. During this all, the young boy who was supposed to be his companion ran amuck and his misfortunes were blamed upon the young lord.
Lily had kept a diary and spoke of running from an enchanted castle. She had been sacrificed to give her elder sister a secure future and prosperous marriage and the fairy had tried to trap her, but she met clever Severus, a slave to the fairy. Together they ran and ran until they reached a border wood that exited Underhill.
"I have told you before, but you make this place mundane in comparison to you, especially when I catch your bright laughter and smiles." Voldemort spun him in a lazy twirl and he lifted Henry's chin with his long index finger. The fae let his thumb just graze his cheek as he made Henry meet his eyes.
"Ah, it sounds like Barty will be joining us soon." Roldolphus said with a bitter amusement. Bella rolled her eyes but did not disagree. She could hear the poor junior courtier yelling over the bleating honks of the swarm of swans that lived in the lake surrounding her master's ancestral stronghold. The swans had once been mostly ok but upon the arrival of a smaller black swan they had started tormenting any who they saw and had no fear of weapons or magic. The Winter Prince had long ago decided they were his and could not be touched and so they were allowed to be wretched monsters.
Voldemort laughed. "Beloved, you shine with your own lights. The dressings and trappings of your station only highlight the glittering perfect emerald in your heart. There isn't a fae here that isn't jealous of us both. You are a prize and I am the pinnacle of my kind." His chin took on a slight haughty tilt.
"My Lord, I demand something be done with those monsters." She screeched. Voldemort regarded her and looked out at the lake where the flock was peaceful and gliding on the mirror surface.
“Corporals Yaxley and Carrows, go inform the Prince of this development. Sergeant Rowle, please go fetch the groom and ferrier.” Rosier commanded, “Go now.”
"When she realized she was with child she called upon the same fae and wanted a chance at true love with her husband. She took a wager. If he fell in true love with either her she would have a fairy godmother for her child. If she failed, the child was forfeit." Voldemort sneered with that last word.
Sirius had been on that fateful trip and knew where Lily had been found. Snape recalled his past master and joined in the search for Henry with Draco in tow.
"Then are you saying that if I rid the burden from you, you will be mine?" Voldemort's voice grew cold. Henry pulled away and walked down the path and stopped on a bridge made of enchanted ice.
Hermione snuggled on her nest and two eggs, her mate, Ron was keeping watch, mostly against his own troublemaker family, but there was a fox around and snakes too. She craned her long white neck to watch as he fluffed himself up.
“It wasn’t something I liked to think about, but young Henry wasn’t exactly who I would have chosen for our boy. Henry was entirely subversive and while I don’t like to speak ill of the dead, it wasn’t a secret that every house he spent summers in had a minor rebellion among the staff after he left. He seemed to cause them to demand higher wages and rules of conduct. It was getting to the point that I had to call in favors for the last few summers.”
The wedding was to happen a year and a day after Armistice but that winter plague swept through both kingdoms. The Potter family was down to just one older childless couple, the brother who abdicated his position to go pursue his dreams of research and his very wise wife. The Lord Malfoy succumbed as well, leaving Abraxas as a new lord. It was agreed that the wedding could be postponed, but not forgotten. The treaty was amended so that the next time a Potter & Malfoy were within 5 years of age of each other, they would be betrothed upon birth of the younger.
“That makes sense.” Lucius said, “Well, James had a knighthood, the traditional way, and he was a page for a knight of my father’s. I came upon him more than once trying to serenade our maids and the boy had the musicality of an elk.”
"My dear, how are you." His captor greeted him always like he was his beloved, and not his prisoner.
Finally, after Henry counted twenty four lashes, the poor brownie was dropped into his own mess of blood and fluids.
From Spring to Autumn the Malfoy heir was out on the seas in the smallest quick sailboats. From Autumn to Spring he spent as much time as he could hunting throughout the mountains and darkest forests in both his and Albus's lands. He explored and verified everything and had in the past four years filled many gaps in their charts and maps and made great discoveries in the craigy coasts and in the dank swamps. None of this brought joy to the boy like it once might have. He used none of it to boast like he would have as a child.
“I’m sorry, darling dear, but you are bound by treaty to spend at least a month with the Greengrasses and young Lord Potter.” She sat in her solar with her boy in her lap who was now tearing up at the idea of having to spend so much time away from home. She knew it was for the best, Draco did like the Greengrass children and it would be the first time he’d meet his husband to be.
Voldemort was startled as the door to his study was flung open and a mud covered Bellatrix stormed in.
Molly let the slight current take her, she was content. Her flock had grown and she was proud of her little flappers who had grown into such good parents. Her brood now had doubled because they brought their mates to roost with her and as such she had a whole mess of cygnets paddling about and making noise.
“And why exactly are you hesitating?” Draco said when Harry told him. Harry gave him an exasperated look.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Draco said, his smile widening. “I think it depends entirely on what’s revealed as the dress comes off. And you, Mr. Potter, have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.” His light eyes sparkled as Harry turned the robe right side out and laid it on top of the tunic, leaving him in just his red boxer shorts. He felt Draco’s eyes move over his bare chest and shoulders, almost as if his hands had touched him. His nipples tightened, and he felt a pleasant heat begin low in his stomach. “And I,” Draco went on when Harry straightened, “am not even remotely tired.”
“I can see it now,” she teased. “Hogwarts Headmaster scandalizes holiday shoppers with potty mouth, story on page five.”
The whispers filled the sitting room, saying something over and over. Draco looked for the source, his head swiveling, but he couldn’t tell where they were coming from. And then one of the small booklets in his hands twitched, as if trying to pull away, and he looked down.
"You, folding everything up so careful. Who are you, and what happened to the Harry Potter who used to roll everything up and jam in his pockets?"
Harry glanced over his shoulder and saw Justin was giving Draco and his admirer an irritated look. Harry felt a surge of his own annoyance. "Who is that?"
Harry had gone to work at the Orphanage full time immediately following his first Christmas home. He helped with the children, but mostly he used the publicity surrounding his return to help solicit funds to make sure their charges got everything they needed, and that the orphanage could expand to take in more staff and more children.
"Or maybe because of it," Harry agreed quietly. "I wish you'd just spell out what you're insinuating, Hermione. And if you're headed where I think you are – " He could hear the warning in his own voice, and he took a deep breath. "It's just that the whole thing is so – "
“Gods, you’re a nag,” Draco muttered around his thumbnail. He’d been teasing with the idea of gnawing on it for nearly an hour. Had his manicure not cost so much, he might have.
Draco’s heart slammed into his throat as the slender, sinewy man with a thick shock of black hair and broad shoulders standing behind her turned, his eyes going past her to Draco where he stood in the doorway. Draco read his lips as he said ‘Malfoy’ without sound.
Harry reached up and twisted his hair into a messy bun, something he did when he was deflecting. Or so Hermione told him. “I dare say you saw enough.”
“Hello, luv.” Molly wrapped one arm around Lily’s shoulders. Her other had a basket nestled into the curve of her elbow, and she held it out toward Harry. “Harry, will you take this, please?”
It was all the prompting Draco needed. He slipped one hand beneath Harry's arse and braced the other on the headboard of the bed. Harry had closed his eyes, but Draco didn't want that. "Look at me," he said roughly. "Look at me, Harry."
“I... can't,” he said, bemused.  “I just... it wasn't like with the other's, Pans.  It's not something I want to pick apart, or dissect.  It was...” His voice trailed away, and he shrugged helplessly.
The space was a surprise. Draco had never been in a mind healer’s office before, but he certainly hadn’t imagined it would look like this. There was a large window along one wall, charmed to show the view of downtown London. It looked to be a lovely, clear day, the sky blue and a few fluffy white clouds drifting gently above Big Ben and Tower Bridge. The room was bright, walls a soft green, floors of pale oak with homey throw rugs scattered about. Two comfortable looking armchairs sat at an angle to a sofa upholstered in a soothing pattern of green leaves. One entire wall was taken up with bookcases stuffed to the brim with books and papers and knickknacks, and there wasn’t a desk in sight. It looked like a comfy sitting room in a flat populated by a bookish uni professor; all it was missing was a fat cat perched on the deep window ledge.
“Maybe he’s grown up more than some of the rest of us.” Her lips curved in a slight smile. “I’ve no doubt if it was Ron, he’d have managed to make a Slytherin snake do something unspeakable. Malfoy’s certainly turned out… well, hasn’t he?”
He looked down into Olivia’s sleep slackened face, brushing a damp curl back from her sweaty brow. She was a beautiful little girl; she should be the apple of someone’s eye, their pampered, spoiled little princess. Not a nearly silent toddler being raised in an orphanage, no matter how kind the staff. Clearly, there was or had been a father somewhere; the only word she seemed to know was Daddy. Harry sighed and ran his fingers through her long curls. No child should have to grow up unloved, without their parents; he knew that only too well. He shifted her a bit closer, and glanced across the room. His gaze held on the man stretched out in another of the wooden rockers.
“So, should we get dressed, do you think?” Potter teased, glancing down meaningfully. They were both naked for all intents and purposes, but for the bunched up clothing that had somehow managed to twine around their knees.
He found once he was working with the large beasts in magical Vet school, he shared the same sort of communication with magical creatures. Empathic. He wasn’t an empath the way some people were, as such, but he felt the unique bond he shared with certain magical creatures. And, apparently, a castle in the highlands of Scotland.
“Given your experiences,” she said, her eyes gentle, “I don't blame you.  But Harry... that's wonderful.”
dare fall,” Potter said against a rough kiss, and Draco didn’t understand until Potter slid gracefully to his knees.
“He’s fine,” Harry answered, thinking of the ornery old woman and her equally ornery cat. When he’d decided to open a private veterinary practice in Hogsmeade, he knew there would be patients like ‘Muffin’ Erlington. He just wished the old bastard would stop eating his owner's stockings. They were a right bitch to get back out, and Muffin was a menace.
Blaise's lips twisted. "Oh, that was over and done with in fifth year, Draco. I wouldn't touch you now if you paid me." He turned away, threw Floo powder onto the flames, and then he was gone.
"I had a friend," he began finally. "He was – incredibly loyal, and selfless, and occasionally," his lips pulled up in a nostalgic smile, "an enormous pain in my arse." Laughter rippled through the room. "I've been really lucky in my life to have friends who would stand by me through about anything, even when they thought I was barking."
It was with a festive atmosphere that Ron, Hermione, Rosie, Harry and Bludger all started out on what was a short walk to the
“Sure.” He paused before a gate in the middle of a white picket fence and leaned over to push it open, and Harry looked up the narrow walkway to the charming two story house that sat back from the street.
“Please tell me it hit you in the face,” Malfoy said, glancing over his shoulder. His eyes were sparkling. Harry wiped the wet snow from his face, giving him a glare that his heart wasn’t in. The moment Malfoy turned back to the gates, drawing his wand, Harry knelt and formed a quick, hard snow ball and threw it into the back of Malfoy’s head. It landed in his hair with a wet splat.
She laughed raggedly, then took a deep breath and straightened, reaching out once again. The knob felt cold in her hand and she thought that was a very odd thing for her to notice at such a time. She turned it and pushed, and the door opened silently.
She’d swallowed heavily, blinking. “I’ve been offered a promotion,” she said finally, her voice tentative. “It’s a major step up, Harry. Head Reporter for International Quidditch.”
“Oh, I know. I think I’ve heard all of your lines.” Draco slid his hand up, over Harry’s right pectoral. Draco loved Harry’s chest; it was one of the reasons he still flew when the quidditch teams were practicing. Gripping the broom with his hands and thighs did wonders for his muscle tone. “Not that they don’t still work, mind you.”
"What?" Hannah Abbott-Longbottom said incredulously. "Justin, we've spent hours and hours going over this crap. It's not confrontational; it's direct. And I'm so bloody tired of soft pedalling so that we might get old people to vote for something that won't impact their lives because, pardon my honesty, they'll be dead."
Draco yanked playfully on a curl, then went back to methodically carding his fingers through the damp strands. Harry didn’t say anything else for several minutes, but he knew there was one thing, at least, that it was pressing they speak about.
“So, why were you asking about school, Hermione?” Harry shot Ron an amused look. “Afraid I had nefarious designs on your husband?”
It was true; Kingsley was going to step down, and Harry knew damned well that he was next in line for Chief Auror. He stared into the cinnamon brown eyes. “I’d not decided that I was going to take it, Gin. I’m not sure I want it.” That was true as well; being an Auror had lost some of its sheen, particularly after Ron had resigned and gone to work with George, taking Fred’s place as vice president of WWW.
“Harry,” she amended breathlessly when she caught up to him. She turned to Hermione. “Mrs. Weasely, thank you so much…”She stopped, obviously overcome with emotion, something Harry had rarely seen before. She blinked and swallowed. “Thank you,” she repeated. “Now promise me that you will find out who did this,” her gaze turned to Harry, and it had gone flinty, “and that you will deal with them, personally.”
Malfoy blinked, then backed into an ancient oak, reaching back to touch it, his fingers moving restlessly over the bark. Hagrid followed, positioning his body to defend Malfoy if necessary. Once they were in a more easily defended position, Harry closed his eyes and waited.
Potter caught his thrusting hips and slid closer, but Draco stopped him.  “The lube...” he gasped, head thrashing.
“Merlin, you’re such a tight arse.” Scorpius ran his fingers roughly through his hair even as Draco glared at him.
Harry's eyes danced merrily but he turned back to the podium and applauded enthusiastically when Hermione's name was announced.
Potter's body stilled, absently lifted hand hovering by his face for a moment before dropping back to his side. "What?"
Very deliberately, but with a motion that seemed almost casual, Draco pushed up the sleeve of his cashmere jumper on his left arm, revealing just the curling tail of the snake of his Dark Mark. He then, quite slowly, set the card in the middle of their table with his left hand.
“Hey.” He threw one of her small pillows at her. She caught it easily, reminding him of the marshmallow, then gave him a cheeky grin.
After gifts, Teddy and Rosie were allowed to bring in a small charred branch that was festooned with pine, holly and red ribbons, and they solemnly lay it on a huge log in the hearth that had yet to be lighted.
Draco was waiting, and Harry blinked, trying to regain his train of thought. “Oh, uhm…” He gestured his head toward the little boy on the floor and Draco glanced at Teddy, nodding.
The one on the top was of Draco himself, wearing a voluminous pale green robe, his hands cupping his distended belly. It was the one and only photograph in existence that proved he'd carried Scorpius, taken two weeks before his son was delivered. His face was thin and haggard and he had dark circles beneath his eyes. He'd been so miserable. He'd had a very difficult time carrying the baby, but somehow he'd managed a smile for his mother. There had been so many times he'd thought to throw it onto the flames, but once again he just shifted it to the bottom of the small stack.
It truly hadn’t been a midlife crisis when Harry and Ginny ended their marriage, and least he hadn’t thought so at the time. He hadn’t cheated, which was what the
“Ehh, Master Harry.” He grumbled. He was clearly disappointed, but then he’d never much liked Harry.
clung to the highest peak of Ginger Island. Simple stuccoed houses painted in bright pastel colors dotted the hillsides in clusters, and a few jagged little streets, veering this way and that, made up a wizarding neighborhood not unlike Hogsmeade. Of course, there was no snow on the roofs, but there was a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes right in the middle next to a Zonko's and across the street from Quality Quidditch. Sometimes it was a weird juxtaposition; days in the summer when the heat shimmered off the cobblestones. Even in December the sun shone and the beaches gleamed, and as Harry walked, the sleeves of his simple island button down fluttering in the breeze, his flip flops dangling from one hand.
“That’s just one of your gifts, Molly.” He took a large bite of the biscuit, humming appreciatively. “And it is a gift. These are delicious.”
There was a lit exit sign over a hallway that led out of the ballroom, and Harry headed for it. If this venue was like any of the other ten thousand hotel ballrooms he'd been in during the interminable last ten years, that hallway would lead to the loo's, and then the lobby. He thought if he could just splash some cold water on his face, he'd be okay. Then he'd go back, his pride intact, order a double firewhisky and ignore the obnoxious Irish prat for the rest of the evening. He could do that; he was sure he could.
“I’m going to go downstairs and use the Floo, and get Whimsy up to speed. After that, I’m heading back to the school, if you should happen to need me.” Hermione stood up, concern in her dark eyes, but didn’t try to stop him when he headed for the lift. He was halfway across the hall when he stopped and turned back. “Please tell Draco – “ he paused, shoving his hands into his coat pockets, “ – tell him I’m glad Scorpius is home.”
The first time he’d seen the Malfoy crest, he’d been 18 years old. The Death Eater trials were winding up, and the day after he testified for Mrs Malfoy and Draco, he’d Apparated to the Manor’s gates, startled to find them hanging, shattered and blown from their hinges. The walk up the crushed shell drive, broken through intermittently by weeds and bordered with the overgrown lawns, seemed to take forever. He was tired, still fighting lingering, painful reminders from the last hours of the Battle of Hogwarts; apparently dying and then coming back was a painful process. He was nervous; he tried to ignore it, but seeing Malfoy always made a flight of moths take wing in his stomach. By the time he climbed the broken, stained marble steps of the Manor to the massive front doors, his legs were screaming and he was questioning his act of altruism. He used the brass knocker, predictably in the shape of a snake, to bang against the doors and announce his presence. The sound echoed through the house, and when one of the doors finally slowly opened, it revealed Draco Malfoy’s pale, angular face.
“I wonder why she’s latched on to me,” he murmured, partly to prevent Draco bustling out the door and partly because he was actually curious.
Draco leaned over and tested the water.  It was a bit warmer than he usually liked it, but not scalding.  He glanced over his shoulder when he felt fingertips tracing the curve of his left cheek.  Potter was staring at his arse, his eyes heated as his hand softly stroked the full, firm flesh.
“I never thought I’d say this, Mate,” Ron mused, wandering through the main floor with his hands in his pockets, “but this thing is in worse shape than the Burrow.”
He nodded, feeling a smile begin across his face again as he pocketed his keys.  “Good,” he said, taking a step towards the door.  “That’s… good.  Well, thanks again.”  He nodded one more time, then turned and left the sitting room with a spring in his step.
"What are you doing here?" he asked. He sounded truly mystified, a slight tremble in his voice giving him away. He cleared his throat in irritation and straightened, crossing his arms over his chest.
"There you go again with the name calling." Harry caressed the firm white globes of Draco's truly beautiful arse, then eased his thumbs between them and pulled them apart. The dusky pink flesh of his tight little anus winked at him. He blew a breath over it, and Draco shuddered.
She expertly trimmed the tip, then set the quill on the ornate desktop beside him. "I still think you should just switch over to fountain pens."
"Head Auror Harry Potter is standing at the front gates, wishing to see Master Draco. What should Knobly be doing?"
Harry pretended indifference. “Just getting more comfortable,” he allowed his back to curl slightly, eased his knees apart. He’d watched enough people under the influence of
Bill nodded, rubbing the scars on his face. Harry doubted he even knew he was doing it. “Are you… better?”
“Daddy,” she breathed, turning in his lap and resting her cheek against his chest. She closed her eyes and popped her thumb in her mouth.
Moments later Hermione bustled back in holding a small plate, on which was a thick slice of the beautiful Bûche De Noël she’d served for dessert. It hadn’t looked remotely appetizing two hours before, but now the sight and scent of it made his mouth water. He managed to push up into a sitting position and held out his hand, ignoring that it was trembling. Hermione handed it to him, and the first, huge bite he took literally melted on his tongue and he moaned in pleasure.
"That's because Master Blaise has been screwing his way through the south of France," Draco said drily. Blaise shot him an arched brow.
It would have been hilarious if Harry hadn't felt so lousy. Ron was the colour of a tomato, and Hermione was holding him back by digging her nails into the back of his hand.
Draco looked up at him again, but wasn’t immune to the glamour of that white smile, and those sparkling light eyes.
Harry agreed; he didn’t like them, either, which was why he still wore the round framed glasses he’d always worn. But Draco looked almost professorial, and Harry thought of the fantasies students would have about any teacher that looked like he did. Harry knew he would have had some, even before he’d acknowledged the truth of his sexuality to himself.
Draco stayed very still as Harry touched the child’s head fondly, then looked back up at him. “Very cool,” he said softly, and Draco’s heart began to pound. Was it even remotely possible that Harry didn’t hate him? Gods, if the situation had been reversed, he’d have been reaching for his wand, hexing him into oblivion. But then, of the two of them, Harry had always been kinder, more patient… Draco’s throat thickened.
The words created a surge of unpleasant electricity that streaked down his spine. Harry’s mouth went dry, and he stared at the envelope in Kingsley’s large hand, the green monogram seeming to glow against the ecru background.
Draco nodded. “One and the same. Apparently her brother is one of the brainless twits who began this latest Death Eater nonsense, and he bragged to her about how he’d captured her old boyfriend. That night, while they were all celebrating his capture, Forsythia snuck into their hideout and Apparated him out.”
Harry’s expression was sheepish. “Would you think I was ridiculous if I opted for ice cream, instead?”
Draco handed her back the parchment. “I do.” He caught her arm before she could walk away. “I do appreciate your thoughtfulness, however.”
Harry and Hermione both turned to Ron, who had slipped in beside them, taking in the surprised expressions on their faces. He held up his large hands, showing every appearance of trying very hard not to laugh at them.
"There is that," Harry agreed, saluting her clear disapproval with his heavy tumbler. She forced a bright smile, which put him instantly on alert. "What?" he asked suspiciously.
“Come here, Harry,” Draco breathed, lifting both hands to curl around Potter’s waist, pulling him toward him, “lie on me. I want to feel you, too.”
“You know,” she said, nibbling on a piece of perfectly browned toast. Harry took another off a plate in the middle of the table and took a bite. It was perfect. “I had a thought last night after you went to bed. I think you should go to the Ministry and access their Veterinary Medical records.”
It was early enough in the day the alley wasn’t as busy as it might have been, but it was after December first so he counted himself lucky it wasn’t a mob. Vendors hawked their wares at rolling carts set up along either side of the cobbled streets, and Christmas decorations were strung along the eaves, wreaths on the doors. The scent of roasted chestnuts and cider was thick on the air, and Harry smiled as he walked. There really wasn’t any place else like Diagon at Christmas, except perhaps Hogsmeade. The holiday seasons he’d celebrated since he came into the wizarding world had managed to almost completely eclipse those he’d been forced to endure with the Dursley’s. He glanced at the wares on display as he passed, thinking he’d stop and get one of the sparkly necklaces for Lils and a velvet scarf for Molly, then detour into Quality Quidditch for Al; Ginny complained he spoiled the kids, and he supposed he did. Being the pampered only daughter of a family that adored her, she’d never understand what Harry had gone through when he’d been little. If he was trying to make up for his own miserable holidays by indulging James, Albus and Lily, so be it.
Teddy’s brow furrowed, and he spent several seconds in serious thought. “That I can’t have it. I want it.”
The man moved, his head lifting and his hands coming up to rub over his face, then his fingers spearing up through his long fringe. He dropped his hands into his lap and straightened, his silvery gray eyes lifting to Harry’s face. That was the moment Harry recognized the slightly pointed features he’d fantasized about since fourth year, and he stared in a combination of surprise and shock.
And she was right; he did. He was wearing a green jumper that molded to his muscular upper body and brought out his vivid eyes, and the snug jeans Draco had finally forced him to buy showed his sturdy thighs to great advantage. He’d regained all the weight he’d lost, and he looked fit and happy.
Harry smiled and pressed another soft kiss to the back of Draco’s thigh. “Well, since you asked so nicely…”
He leaned forward, his elbows on the blotter and his fingers pressing into his temples. Now that he knew about Potter’s background, he almost wished he didn’t. Gods, how did a child, an infant, even survive the sort of neglect and abuse he had? Draco knew that his own childhood had been skewed by his father’s beliefs, but he’d never doubted for a moment that he was loved. His mother had told him every day. He’d been coddled, spoiled, fed and clothed. The war years had been a nightmare, but when he was a baby and a toddler? He wanted for nothing. While Potter…
Potter was watching him, his eyes still awash in tears of weakness and pain, and some other emotion Draco couldn’t name.
“I don’t want you to go home,” she said, her voice shaking. “Even if you do have pink sheeps. I want you to stay here forever. If you go back, I’ll never see you again.”
“Don’t forget the fan mail,” Ernie said brightly, dumping several envelopes on the corner of Harry’s desk. He eyed the messy stack balefully.
He stored his bike in the back hallway in front of the door that led to the alley. He’d offered to come in that way several times, and Frombley always said, “you’re a pharmacology expert with first class honours, Draco. You don’t enter your place of employment past the dumpster.” There was something about the sentiment, said so matter-of-factly, that made Draco’s throat feel tight. His Muggle employer recognized and was kind about his accomplishments while no one in the Wizarding world would even acknowledge them. Draco knew his father would have minimized his training and said something snide about his ‘non magical’ degree.
She spoke skilfully and with obvious feeling for several minutes. She was good at it, Draco thought, certain her career in politics was probably on the rise. He no longer paid attention to what was happening at the Ministry; his father had been into government intrigue. Draco hated it. But he'd bet the last galleon in his vault that Granger knew every in and out, and someone so obviously passionate about magical creatures' well-being could only be good for their world.
"Oh, honestly," Draco complained, but he didn't mean it. Grabbing Harry around the waist, he flipped them over until Harry was on his back, looking up at him with wide eyes and Draco knelt between his knees. "What do you like?" he asked as he flipped open the cap on the small lube bottle and dribbled some onto his fingers.
"Well, for the record, it isn't true. They've been babysitting a batch of Polyjuice potion in the second floor girl's loo."
Draco didn’t bother to correct this mistake. They’d been trying for months to get ‘Weasley’ right, without success and Draco decided it wasn’t worth the headache.
"I would hope so," Ron quipped. "Even I know this face doesn't belong on a girl." There was polite laughter all around.
Olivia crept closer as the next hour or so went by. She avidly watched each new picture the blocks formed, and watched the boy’s crow and giggle. She even smiled around the ever present fingers between her lips. Still, when she finally settled herself in Harry’s lap as if sitting on him was the most natural thing in the world, to say he was startled was an understatement. He stiffened, but after a few moments where she just sat leaning back against him, Harry lifted his wand and went back to rearranging blocks.
After the defeat of Voldemort, Harry had mended the Holly wand before returning the Elder wand to what he would always think was its rightful owner—he’d certainly wanted no part of it. And the Holly wand had seemed comfortable in his hand, actually happy to be back if one wanted to imbue wands with sentient emotions. It had worked fine for him, and he’d returned the Hawthorne wand to Draco, who had seemed quietly happy to have it back. And then they had begun to see one another. After the first night Draco had spent in his bed, Harry, his vision blurred without his glasses, had reached for his wand in the darkness to cast
“We need to restock the Fizzing Whizbangs, and the Daydream potions were looking low, too. Oh, and check the puzzle aisle, too. I’ve seen a lot of those going out the door today. Oh, and we need to contact Honeydukes; their display is looking a bit done in.”
He pushed the chair back and rested his chin on his arms. There was one framed photo on the desk, a five by seven in a heavy silver frame, and he reached forward, taking it in his hand. He rubbed his thumb along the edge as the two people in the picture smiled at one another. The woman, a lovely creature in her later years, caressed the white blond hair of a happy toddler who sat on her lap. He looked up and smiled at her, and she leaned down to rub her nose against his. They both laughed, then looked out at Draco and waved. The image repeated over and over, and Draco felt a lump fill his throat. They'd been his world and he'd have done anything for them. In point of fact, he had.
“And you,” he said to Harry, not releasing his hand when Harry went to stand, “come back here and kiss me, and make it good. I may have to wait
The pens had half doors, and Harry leaned on it for several minutes, watching the majestic female dragon sleeping peacefully, her little hatchling curled into her iridescent blue body. They were so spectacular, he thought. The Bluenecks weren’t as big as the Horntails or the Welsh greens, but Harry thought they were more beautiful. Their scales were thick but pliable, a deep blue close to the dragon’s body, lightening to a shimmering cobalt along the edges. Their heads were sleek, snouts narrow, black eyes large and thickly lashed. They had curled goat like horns, and their wings folded into their backs, nearly invisible when they slept. Harry watched him carefully, relieved to see that little Lee was breathing easily in his sleep. Harry had planned to examine him a little more closely, but he knew how cranky a newly wakened mama dragon could be, and he really didn’t want to face Astrid’s wrath by waking her up. So he stood in the doorway, feeling the heat coming from the room, enjoying watching the two creatures sleep.
“I never claimed to be anything other than completely self-serving,” Draco called back. He paused, his eyes moving over Harry’s face. “Seven, then?”
"About specifics, or just my seeming inability to settle to one person?" he asked casually, but she knew him too well, and knew what he was asking.
Ron hummed, slipping his hands into the pockets of his overcoat as they walked. His red hair was restored and the Santa padding was gone, and Harry could see that the years had been good to him. Ron looked happy and healthy, a man firmly in charge of his life and secure in it. Harry envied him that.
Draco stared at her, stunned. “He was in America, and he left his wand here?” He could scarcely fathom such a thing. He didn’t think he’d been more than an arm’s length from his own wand since he’d been eleven and Olivander had handed it to him. Well, unless one took into account the months Potter had it. “Why in the world would he do such a thing?”
; he knew how their bodies would begin to relax, in the men how their balls would start to feel heavy. Dennis watched him avidly, licking his lips, and Harry had to fight to keep the distaste from his face. “You were saying that I got distracted?”
“You’re right, Malfoy,” he said, letting his ire go with a sigh. “I should have put it away. That would be easier than trying to convince George Weasley not to send things like that through the post to begin with.”
“They were grieving their own loss.” She didn’t scold, but he felt like she should. He’d forgot all about the lost twin.
She shook her head, her hair swinging. “I don’t think you do,” she said, her eyes intense. “And I’m not sure you looked in the right places, after he was gone.”
“I doubt very many people would notice, actually,” he said softly. “Again, I’m sorry I bumped into you.” He started to step around the other man when a hand fell on his arm, stopping him. A hand with a curling tattoo across the back. He looked at it, then back up into Malfoy’s face. His expression was earnest.
“Perfectly willing.” Harry walked into his small, efficiency kitchen. He took most of his meals in the Great Hall, but it was nice to have the hot plate if he wanted to warm up a snack. A large stainless kettle sat on the counter, and he took another mug from a cupboard and poured her out a cup of the fragrant chocolate.
“Listen, you little shit,” Harry growled, “I will give you socks. I can spell them right onto your feet.”
“Oh, Head Auror Potter,” she gasped, thin hands crossed over the base of her throat. Harry forced a mild smile.
Harry smiled. "You're very kind." He clasped his hands behind his back, rocking on his heels. "This is an impressive home."
He’d been at it about an hour when another child shyly approached, her fingers in her mouth and her blue eyes wide. She had dark curls that cascaded around her face and shoulders, and her cheeks and lips were very pink. Harry wasn’t immediately aware of her, but when he caught a glimpse of her pink jumper in his peripheral vision, he paused and turned.
“You know what the sight of you in those clothes and boots does to me,” he whispered. Harry smiled into his hair.
, which was appropriate for the family geneaology. Draco’s mother had rolled his eyes behind Lucius’s back, and Draco had bit back a giggle, which was something of an accomplishment for a six year old. Beyond the gates branches of trees stripped bare for winter hung down over the narrow lane that led to the house far in the distance, and Draco stared, his eyes aching with unshed tears.
Harry did all of the things Bernard suggested. The chair Draco sat in was identical, and it seemed to embrace him from all sides, holding each of his body’s tense zones in levels of comfort. Yet the core of steal Draco had always sensed in his lover was vibrating, pulled tight. He could feel the reflection of that through his fingers. This went well beyond mere nerves.
“Oh,” Draco sighed when the fullness of Harry’s weight had settled on him. He spread his legs and lifted his knees, and Harry’s hips fell naturally between them. “Oh, God. You have no idea how good you feel, and how I’ve missed this.”
Harry had put the hunter green and burgundy bedding Draco favored on their large, queen sized sleigh bed, lit a fire in the rock fireplace that had been a major selling point of the house, and was now reclining against their mountain of pillows with his legs crossed at the ankle, wearing black boxer shorts and a smile. There were candles lit on either side of the bed, and the golden glow picked up the silver strands that were still a very minor contingent in the wealth of his black hair and made his tawny skin glow. He was rubbing a spot near his groin on the outside of his pants, right between his hipbone and what appeared to be a healthy erection.
Draco dropped into a courtly bow, which made Harry’s smile widen. He could only imagine how ridiculous he looked, bowing naked, a towel in his hand.
“Go to the Healer, Harry. Don’t give Draco a hard time, please. He’s told me how long this has been going on.”
He removed his ankle length dove grey overcoat and hat and threw them onto the damask covered chaise that sat facing the fireplace in his private rooms at the Manor. Removing the holly wand from the harness secreted inside the sleeve of the heavy black jumper, he pointed it towards the logs already laid on the hearth and whispered ‘
"That's because he wasn't out of his pram yet twenty years ago," Draco retorted. Pansy colored prettily, but she didn't bother to respond; the kid behind the bar couldn't be more than twenty, twenty-one. He was very attractive, but entirely too young for Draco's taste. Plus, he was a blond, which had never done it for him. He took a sip of the fine liquor, blowing a perfect ring of smoke before putting his hand onto Pansy's on the table, squeezing it briefly. "I don't want to snipe with you tonight, all right?"
“Magical surgery is much safer than the Muggle version, Granger. It’s very sanitary, infection is almost unheard of…”
