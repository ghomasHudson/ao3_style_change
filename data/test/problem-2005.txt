“I’m sure that was to be expected. Oh, Snape was there when I met with Dumbledore so you don’t have to worry about telling him that you’ve moved in.” Harry paused a moment before speaking again. “Well I don't want to cut into your time settling in tonight, but I do have another matter to address."
"That may be so, but who will they put in his place? There are many corrupt men in on the board, there are too many of them who are connect to the Dark Lord. I shudder to think who they would find as a replacement." The color drained further out of his face and the four in front of him were completely thrown off by his reaction. They weren't scared for the fate of the school, but with the way that Severus was carrying on, they also began to worry about the direction that the school and the war would take if death eaters were able to take over Hogwarts.
"What's going on here?" Professor McGonnagal demanded and the younger Slytherins tried to run.
"They trust you, love. And for good reason too." Draco said gently, feeling Harry tense at his words.
“Let me finish,” Severus growled, more than tired with the games his masters wanted him to play. “He expected Draco to fail and he expects me to take his place.”
"We're just going to work on the simple shield charm, disarming charm, and a hex. Don't feel the need to hold back, I'm perfectly capable of handling myself and I want to see you at your fullest potential."
"He's calling you?" Draco asked worried and Snape nodded. "But I thought he hadn't called you since the school year started."
"Checkmate!" Ginny exclaimed happily as the long game came to an end. "Well I think Neville and I will head to bed. Good night, boys." Ginny smiled, bending down to hug Harry close and kiss him on the cheek. She even moved to hug Draco and they shared a short, slightly awkward hug.
Getting up quickly, Draco rushed to the third floor, stopping at the door listening for any sound of movement. When there was no other sounds made Draco opened the door quietly, surprised that it wasn't even locked. Harry's room was nothing like he had thought it would be. He had expected Gryffindor colors, it had after all been Sirius' room once, but instead was surprised by the deep green walls and the natural wood furnishings. It was very homey and welcoming, just like Harry. Right I'm supposed to be making sure Harry is okay.
“And you're inviting us to join?" Draco asked surprised. He and Harry had little time to talk in the past few weeks and while Harry had promised that he would help Draco integrate into the Light, he had not expected to be allowed into their secret army.
“So what could the last one be?”

“Ah… ah… a locket!” The man choked out.
"Goodnight, my love." Harry whispered back, not sure if the blond had heard him. The light snores coming from him pulled Harry into a peaceful sleep.
"Lucius was taken from the board, but not to worry, we do have other informants."
“No thank you, Sir, I would prefer discussing the papers I procured from Professor Williams,” Harry replied evenly.
“Okay then Blaise, Hermione, and Pansy can you three finalize the list of the potions ingredients we will need to stock the store room? I am going to ask the twins to help us since they can still move freely outside. Seamus, Dean and Ron, you’re on lunch duty. Ginny and Luna, I think it’s high time we decorate this place for the holidays, don’t you?”
"I am merely stating things as I see them." It was the closest that Harry would get and he let it rest.
"Nonsense." Again with that word, Draco wasn't sure if he liked it or if it irritated them. "Go on and have lunch, Mipsy will cook up whatever it is you want, I'm going to work on the room for you."
"That's all you have to say? This is a serious matter!" Harry cried more than a little put out. It was only Snape's hand on the small of his back that kept him from leaping at the man. While he might have gotten his emotions under control for the most part, Ginny was his sister and this man who was supposed to be protecting all of his students didn't seem to care that she could be in real danger.
"Unless you actually plan on punishing me, I think we should discuss the matter at hand." Harry got straight to the point. He took the seat across from Snape's desk, noting the tea that was waiting for him. The small gesture made the boy smile.
"Bloody hell." Draco let out a gasp as he looked around the room. He had seen the mess it had been in the day before, when he couldn't sleep he wandered a bit before heading for the kitchen, and he hardly recognized the room he stood in.
"Is he a death eater?" Draco asked, shocked. He knew that many of the seventh years and a few of the sixth years talked about joining up, but from what he'd always seen, Voldemort didn't brand anyone until they were out of Hogwarts. That hadn't stopped him from trying to use and brand Draco, however. He shuttered at the memory.
"And why is that? Is it because I actually care about his well being because while you were running around with your pure-blood ideals all of his life I was the one who actually raised him? Are you just mad that I care more about Narcissa and Draco than you ever could?"
The brunette simply rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, no doubt about Harry’s recklessness, though the boy could hardly blame her.
If my parents don’t forget about me and sleep in tomorrow then I should be at Platform 9 ¾ by 10:45 am on the dot. We Malfoys strive to be fashionably late you know.
The sound of Madam Malkin’s pins coupled with the overall silence in the shop was making Harry sleepy. When the bell rang, Harry jumped at the sound. Madam Malkin stabbed his shoulder with a sharp pin. “Ouch!” he yells. He looks up to see Draco standing in front of him. “Oh, hey Draco. So you’ve decided to stay?” Draco nods. “There’s nothing better to do.”
The other twin nodded. “And Ginny needs to have bad examples so she knows what not to do.” The mother sighed, exasperated. Harry started to drift to the side, now behind the bespectacled haughty boy and a boy who looked about the same age as Harry.
Harry gasped. “The food is really magical here? Woah.” then Harry stops, seeing Draco’s smirk. “You are so gullible, this food isn’t any more different than what muggles make,” Draco says. With a sigh, Harry nibbles dejectedly at a piece of chip. Draco eats silently, trying not to look at the now silent boy across him. Was he waiting for an apology? From him? Well, he wasn’t going to oblige. Not for anything. He looks up at Harry again, who was staring down at his plate. Draco composes himself and sighs. “Look, I’m sorry about that. I’m just not used to someone knowing so little about our world.” Harry glances up with a small smile. “Thanks, Draco.”
I know your probably asleep by now, sorry for the late response. My parents were hosting a party, and of course, I had to be there. Not sure why, there were no other kids my age, just old friends of my dad.
Your muggle relatives don’t know what they’re missing, Dudley won’t have just a pigtail to deal with by the time you come back from school.
The sluggish line moved only every few minutes as each family in front of the Malfoys discreetly walked through the brick wall one at a time. Draco was about to complain loudly about the wait when he heard a loud popping noise beside him. The Malfoy’s house-elf peeked around Draco’s robe to look up at his masters. Mr. Malfoy frowned so that his drunken face looked rather sickly and said angrily, “What are you doing here elf? Apparating in full view of muggles are you now?” The house-elf seemed to shrink to half his size under the glare. “S- sorry Master Malfoy, Dobby didn’t think of the c-consequences.” the house-elf said in his annoyingly squeaky voice. Dracos's father winced and turned away, apparently not sober enough to argue with the little elf.
Harry raises his eyebrows, What are those words. I’ve more or less been living on a rock for the past week” he laughs. “And under stairs the rest of my life!” Draco stares at this crazy-haired, bespectacled, boy in complete shock.
Mrs. Weasley starts ordering her children into order. Harry stands nearby, quietly observing the controlled mayhem. It was clear that the Weasleys loved each other very much, and Harry couldn’t help but feel a pang of lonesomeness watching them. He quickly shakes it off though. I’m not going to be alone anymore, I have Draco and I’ll make more friends at school, he thinks to himself sternly.
The boy with glasses, Percy, Harry guessed, sniffed to make the others pay attention. “That is not just a white owl Fred, its species is of the snowy owls which usually live in the-” George interrupted him. “Blah, blah, blah. Thank you Percy for explaining.” Percy's face turned to the color of his hair. “I was just letting you know,” he says angrily and turns away towards the wall.
-/Two weeks later: One day until September 1st\-
It was no easy matter for Draco to get on the Hogwarts Express. Most students were already on the train and waving through the windows at their relatives who stood blocking any entrances. After shoving his trunk onto a small portly wizard dressed in red, Draco pushed his way through parents and grandparents until he finally entered a train car near the end of the lineup. This car was bustling with students of all ages talking and laughing with each other. Draco squeezed between two young witches excitedly talking about all the classes they wanted to take, and his mind wandered to other things besides school. Like if Harry had made it on the train or if his stupid muggle relatives had even bothered to drop him off, and how he needed to remember to keep very personal things hidden away from annoying house-elves.
In your last letter, you mentioned something about ghosts at Hogwarts. What are they like? Can you really go through them? Get back to me when you can, bye!
Ron jumps at the touch. “Wazzat?” he yelps. Harry smiles “Sorry Ronald, that is your name right?” he asks kindly. The boy yawns before saying “It’s Ron, my mum is the only one who calls me Ronald.” Ron squinted at Harry puzzledly. “And your Harry…” he pauses, waiting for Harry to tell him his last name. When he doesn’t reply, Ron goes on “You’ve never been to Platform 9 3/4? I’ve had to go every year since I was little.” Harry shook his head. “That’s actually why I woke you up. Where is the platform?”
Exploring zaps a lot of energy from a boy. As they gorge themselves on Fish 'n Chips, Harry and Draco talk about the wizarding world. Hagrid appears to take Harry back to the Dursley's. The boys agree to owl each other over the rest of the summer.
“Well, that’s alright, we’ll just show him.” Harry looks at the youngest boy. He had been deadly quiet this whole time until now. Mrs. Weasley nods. “Of course, thank you, Ronald.” She ruffles her son's hair. “You can go with Harry then!” Ron pushes her hands off his head. “Yes mum,” he mutters.
Harry stifled a laugh. “Hello sir, can I have a cart for my trunk and directions to a platform?” he asks. After another yawn, the man nods and rubs his eyes blearily. “Yes, I suppose so. The carts are by the entrance-” Harry blushes slightly, embarrassed of not seeing the carts earlier. “-And what platform would you be going to?” The man continued.
-From H., the second-best artist after you
Draco tapped his foot impatiently and leaned out from the line to see how close he and his parents were to platform 9 3/4. Most of the magical folk around Draco were disheveled and looked half asleep. His parents were not an exception with their unbrushed hair, slept-in clothes, and dazed expressions. Meanwhile, Draco already wore his school robes and had taken the time to freshen up, this was due to how early the boy had risen that morning. While Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy had spent last evening entertaining important and rich guests, their son was preparing for the next day.
Fred and George nodded solemnly. “Of course mum,” George says and Fred cracks another wide smile. “Thank you for the idea! Bye!” Before Mrs. Weasley could get around to smacking them, the twins ran away towards the front of the train. “Those boys will be the death of me,” she grumbles under her breath.
“Now then Harry, what house are you aiming for?” Harry sat down slowly and looked at Draco, confused. “What house? Er, like a farmhouse?” There’s an awkward silence as Draco absorbs this information. “Like the school houses of course! Have you been living under a rock? Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff.” Draco says.
In the silence, Madame Malkin says “Mr. Malfoy, turn around if you please. And stop moving! This will take all day.” Draco nods and turns to the wall. Harry leans back. “Sorry about that, sometimes I don’t think before speaking,” he says. “So there are four houses, right?” Draco nods. “Er, yeah. You get sorted into them at the beginning of the year..”
Next were Fred and Mrs. Weasley with Ginny in tow. The little girl giggled as she went through. Ron sighed and turned back to Harry, who was still gaping open-mouthed. “Harry, it’s our turn,” Ron says. The black-haired boy doesn't stop staring at the wall. A punch to his shoulder solves that. “Ouch!” Harry says, rubbing his sore appendage. “What did you do that for?” Ron laughs loudly.
Harry watches as his travel companions get in line to have Mrs. Weasley drop a plastic ball onto their freckled hands. They all tried to smile at their mother but Harry could see how each of the children quickly shoved the ball deep in their pockets behind their mother’s back. Mrs. Weasley hugged her kids tightly together and then said, “Better be off then. Make sure to be nice to professors-” she shot a look at the twins, who smiled mischievously. “And no funny business boys, I do not want to get a letter from the school that you’ve blown up a bathroom or something.”
All jokes aside, the drawing is good. It holds the highest honor of being framed on the wall in my bedroom, next to the self-portrait that you sent last week. So now you want to know about the ghosts? When I asked my father, he said that there are house ghosts and even a ghost professor. Although he didn’t go into much detail, my father let slip that there’s a ghost girl in a dungeon girls’ bathroom. Her name is Moaning Gertal? Cercle? Myrtle? Something like that.
The two boys came upon an empty compartment only a few minutes later. “This looks good.” Harry’s companion says and opens the door.  “Finally, quiet at last.” Ron slumps onto the left cushioned bench. Harry takes the right bench, carefully setting his owl beside him. Hedwig hoots gratefully, now that she wasn’t in constant motion anymore she was finally able to sleep. It seemed that Ron was also trying to take a nap, as the freckled boy was now leaning against the wall and snoring softly.
Harry smiles, grateful that even though his only acquaintance was grumpy, he actually knew someone who could help him. “Sit, my fitting may take less than yours though.” Draco takes a seat and stares at Harry pointedly. “What do you want to know?” he says. Harry thinks for a moment. “What’s Quidditch? I heard some wizards talking about it on the way here. Is it food?” Draco almost laughs at the absurdity, “No, it’s a sport Harry. A really popular one at that.” It takes a while for Draco to explain everything he needed to know about Quidditch, but Harry eventually got it.
“Now Ron, don’t embarrass me in front of Penny- I mean the other students at Hogwarts. I have a reputation to protect.” The glasses boy says. Harry smiled. Hogwarts, that was the school he was going to! Harry, plus the family, passed Platform 7, then 8. Where was the platform they needed? Platform 9 was just ahead, but the redheads didn’t stop until they had passed it.
In the event I am very late, try to save us a train car on the Express, will you? They get filled up quickly. See you there.
Percy takes the moment to leave as well, saying a quick “Goodbye mum.” then walking to the nearest train car entrance. Then there were four. Harry sees Mrs. Weasley sniff back tears before turning to them. “You have fun boys,” she says and then hugs Harry, who though very surprised, hugged back. She pulls away quickly. “Now go on! The train leaves soon!” Harry and Ron nod and start to the back of the train.
The boy frowns, making his face look like a ferret, Harry stifles a laugh. “Hagrid? Do you mean that old fool who takes care of Hogwarts? That’s hilarious! I’ve heard that he gets so drunk-” Harry jumps up. “Don’t say another word! Hagrid is a great person.” Neither boy say a word for a few moments, all that can be heard in the store is Madame Malkin’s pins.
Later, Draco would reprimand himself for behaving so impulsively, and what a sight he was, bursting into that small compartment with nothing but a breathless greeting. He was saved from more embarrassment by Harry's face lighting up with a very bright smile. "D! Wow, you're here!" Draco didn't say anything for a moment partly because he was still catching his breath, but mostly because he was surprised that the great Draco Malfoy didn't know what to say. Harry didn't seem to notice Draco's odd silence, the excited boy just smiled and looked across to a still shell shocked Ron Weasley. "Ron, this is-'' Harry paused and then said in his impersonation of Draco, a very haughty and overdramatized tone, "-The Draco Malfoy of the Malfoy family." This absurd introduction broke Draco out of his stupor, he straightened and crossed his arms, "I can engage in pleasantries myself, thank you, Harry." Draco looked Ron up and down. "Especially, when it's with someone that's hardly a pureblood himself."
The Dursleys only stopped the car for the amount of time it took Harry to jump out and Uncle Vernon to throw his nephew’s trunk to the ground. “Good luck finding Platform 9 ¾. We’re not coming back tonight when you realize this is all a hoax.” Uncle Vernon said, then slammed the car door closed after getting in. Harry got his trunk and turned, not letting his uncle have the satisfaction of seeing Harry’s worried face. Only when he couldn’t hear the rattle of the Dursley’s car as it pulled out of the lot, Harry let out a sigh. This was going just as the boy had expected, horrible.
"Off to the next big adventure." And with Luna's parting words, Harry took his friends by groups of two out into the uncertain night.
"Sorry." The response was even quieter, but the all three heard him, each choosing to let it slide, there was no reason to start a fight right in the middle of the pitch. Before things could get more awkward, Katie joined them to collect Harry to start the tryouts.
"I know you're saw all of that." Harry said after a moment and he was able to collect himself. "Sorry if my magic upset you, I normally have a better hold on it than that."
"We might as well go in and talk to Dumbledore about all of this." Harry extended his hand and when Draco took it, he pulled the boy up with ease as if he hardly weighed a thing. "Are you sure you want to publicly switch sides? Your life will
Severus could hardly understand how serene the man could sound in the face of all the scrutiny he was up against. Had he not already questioned the man’s sanity he would find himself doing so then. “I just returned from another summons.”
"Well what will you have me do then?" Snape bit back, but this time was able to hold his anger in check enough to not enrage Phineas even further.
Harry looked into the eyes of someone he had seen only as an enemy for so long, searching for any ill intent. When he saw none he let out the breath that he'd been holding. Warily nodding more to himself than to Draco, Harry seemed to come to some sort of conclusion before speaking.
"Well it would help if you stopped yelling." The smart remark made Severus more cross, but he held his tongue He knew better than to continue his rant, as Albus often reminded, he was no longer a child, he hadn't been for a very long time. "This might be a good thing, I would suggest starting to weed through your students and figure out who is going to Voldemort, I don't think Nott is the one, and if he is, he wouldn't have gone alone. If his actions in the past prove anything, he enjoys leading, but only if he has enough followers and an audience. I doubt he would face Voldemort alone."
Draco, Harry, and Pansy moved from the larger library to the small study which connected to the room. Harry took a seat behind his desk while the others sat across from him. At first they were silent, the weight of the past month pressing heavily down on them.
-From Draco Malfoy, who is only answering all these questions because he’s bored.
Dobby looked up at Draco and tugged at his black school robe. When the boy looked down with his usual disgusted frown, Dobby reached something from inside his pillow sheet. “Young Master Malfoy forgot something in his room” the elf tried his best to whisper “Dobby thought you would need it before leaving for school.” Now it was Draco’s turn to be annoyed, What could I have forgotten? He thought I could’ve sworn I packed everything. The family in front of the Malfoys moved up a few places and when the line stalled, Draco kneeled to the little elf's height, still making sure Dobby was hidden from view. Draco looked the elf right in his large eyes “What did I leave? Come on you stupid house-elf, give it to me.” Dobby unclenched his fist and let a folded paper fall into Draco’s open hand.
Harry Potter stumbles in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasion, arms filled with school supplies. Madam Malkin, who hated when people clogged up her perfectly spacious store, paused in the middle of pinning another boys’ robes to turn around. “Hogwarts?” she asks. Harry nods slowly. “Then, please move away from the door and sit. Once I’m finished with Mr. Malfoy you can be next.” Madam Malkin turns back abruptly, leaving Harry to sit in one of the comfortable chairs in front of the boy getting fitted.
Harry followed the red-haired family from a distance, observing their conversations. It seemed the cart racers were twins, troublemakers at that. The mother was berating them fiercely while holding tightly onto her daughter’s hand. “You boys are a bad example to Ginny, running like that! The Muggles were staring-” One of the twins laughed. “Who cares about what the Muggles think Mum? They will stare at anything if it’s weird enough.”
"Normally I would try to make you feel better, but not this time. You really ought to talk to him." Luna added solemnly and if it was possible her tone made Harry feel even worse. Neither girl gave him any form of comfort as they bade him goodbye. Steadying his breath, Harry said a short prayer to the powers that be and made his way to Draco, who was still sitting with his back to him.
"Yeah why do you trust him?" Ron spoke up for the first time since his earlier outburst.
“I’m sorry about the gold, I didn’t know!”
“You had to be stopped. You were going down a dark path and you would not listen to reason,” Dumbledore reasoned, though each word sounded like a struggle. Harry felt suddenly as if he was watching a very private moment even though this was no more than a dark, magical creature. Gellert was locked away in a prison of his own design and he was no more here than Draco had been.
"I'm going to hold you to that you know."
“What do we do next?” Draco asked.
"Honestly, sit down, we're never going to get anything done with you lot acting like this." Ginny rolled her eyes, taking the seat right next to Pansy. "Look, I'm not saying we're suddenly best friends, but if Harry, Draco, and Blaise trust you then that is good enough for me, don't let those idiots bother you." Ginny threw an annoyed look at her brother, Dean and Seamus.
"Six?"
"You're always alone, Mate." Ron complained, not sure what Harry's problem was but he was fed up with his attitude. “What, you don't trust us anymore?"
"Butter beer, thanks." Pansy took the proffered drink, sipping it slowly to allow the burn trail down her throat and negate the small prickle of nerves that where building in her stomach. She trusted Blaise and Draco to keep her safe, and for some reason she trusted Harry as well, despite barely knowing him, but the others made her feel more nervous than she would have liked to admit.
"Then go talk to him, don't let us stop you." Harry stepped aside to let the boy pass, making sure to keep Draco behind him. The three watched as the door shut behind the sketchy boy. "Keep an eye on him." Harry said quietly.
"As droll as this small talk is, why are you here? Checking up on us per the Headmaster's orders?" Blaise spoke bluntly, something Harry appreciated. It was refreshing to have a conversation with someone who wouldn’t simply dance around him as if openly addressing the topic at hand would set him off.
" Harry roared, this time he abandoned his control and got right into Ron's face. "Or have you forgotten that? It's been
It took longer than Harry thought it ought to for the students to empty the room. Some of the students were clearly trying to hang back to see what would happen between the two. Harry noticed that most were members of the DA. He had a sinking feeling that Ron and Hermione were not the only two that he had completely shut out without meaning to.
"You getting tired yet, Granger?" The use of surnames just seemed to slide back into place as the snake moved slowly around the proud lioness.
Taking a seat on the bench behind Draco, Harry pulled him into a tight hug. "I'm never going to let anything happen to you." Harry whispered, leaning into place a gentle kiss on his lips.
“We can put protective spells around the room so he cannot tell where he is, it won’t be perfect, but it could work.” Luna suggested.
“We know you stole a peculiar object from Order Headquarters.” George started, sitting across from him.
"So how much magic do you have?" Ginny asked excited while Blaise did his best to wrap his mind around the information that Harry was giving him.
"It was terrifying." Ron cut in. "But we were with Harry and he trained us well. I don't think that any of us would still be here if it weren't for Harry." At this Harry began to blush and he smiled thankfully to his best mate. Despite all the fighting, Ron was still there to support him when it mattered most.
"Can you do that? You're a teacher. You're not supposed to break rules." Ron said slowly and many of the others agreed.
"Yes, thank you." Harry whispered back, giving Draco's hand a quick squeeze under the table. "I've got to go, stick to the plan." Draco nodded subtly, his head still turned toward Ginny and only someone who was looking very closely would even be able to tell that anything had passed between the two boys.
"Right now the thing I'm most worried about is making a complete arse of myself." Harry rolled his eyes, he knew he would have to actually contribute to the conversation or Ginny would just talk at him for hours until he finally gave in.
"No, I just needed to talk to Professor Snape." Nott challenged back, but the way his eyes kept shifting to the blond behind the two made Harry's skin crawl.

“So we have the third horcrux in the safe room which likely takes care of the ‘something belonging to Slytherin’ item.” Hermione was recapping while scanning the master list in front of her. It was an ingenious bit of magic, they had managed to link their various loose notes to one master document so anyone could access the entire core’s notes in a single format.
“What man?” Draco barked and Kreacher’s sneer only darkened.
"Do you know where Draco and Blaise have been staying all this time? The exact location?"
“He was more than helpful.” If Dumbledore knew the lengths that Harry had gone through to get to much needed information he didn’t comment and the boy was more than happy to leave it that way. “Here is everything that he gave me. There is a lot of interesting theories mostly pertaining to how many horcruxes a person can make before the strain on their soul actually fractures them beyond repair.”
"I highly doubt-" The man began to drawl, but Draco spoke up this time.
It was Friday morning and despite the evening he’d had previous, Draco was feeling great. Harry and Ginny had stayed the night, both sleeping in the common room and he had woken up to find a steaming cup of coffee waiting for him in their small kitchenette with a note from Harry letting him know that he had gone out early to talk to Professor McGonnagal. The Gryffindor Quidditch Team roster would go up that afternoon and that night was the second DA meeting. Everything was looking up, and in the light of morning, Draco's fears seemed to fade away. He was sitting in his normal seat at the Gryffindor table with Blaise across from him and Ginny besides him.
As he had predicted the wall behind him closed as soon as he moved further into the room, cutting him off from the hall which lead back toward Dumbledore. It could have been his youth and overconfidence, but he felt no fear, being locked in the cavern alone. He knew snakes, could handle them, and was more than certain that this test would be easy. Voldemort would have built it not expecting the person who would come to face these creatures to be able to speak to them. Harry had an advantage that he would be wise to use it.
"I think we will be able to do that, you certainly have the money, let me go gather a few properties and the memories of their location so you can review them all. If you decide to purchase the land then the memory will be destroyed and you can wipe my memory of its location, but not of the document being drawn. You can make it so I can't remember it was you who bought it, but if I can't remember that it was purchased we could run into some problems."
Gingerly, Draco pushed the door the rest of the way open. If he had been expecting something of a dramatic entrance he was sorely disappointed. The room hardly looked like anything had changed since he’d run from it, frantic to find their friends. Even Harry seemed to be lying in generally the same position that he had left him in. Slowly, as if not to startle the man, Draco sat on the edge of the bed, drawing continuous circular patterns on his lover’s side, coaxing him to speak without speaking himself.
“Thank you, I would really appreciate that.” Draco said, leaning into the boy who easily pulled him into a one-armed hug.
With the help of his magnified specks, Harry was able to see a pattern in the jutting rocks of the far wall. There seemed to be a rough spiral that ended in a larger rock. The spiral itself looked like a track or path of sorts and where it ended to meet the large rock it seemed as if the track continued underneath it. Whatever was mean to be on the track would be able to slide into the protruding grey mass. If Harry had to guess one of the snakes would need to slide up the track and into the hidden compartment, though he wasn’t sure what would need to be done next. It seemed likely that whichever snake entered the compartment would not return. Most magic, especially one this complex, would require payment or power to trigger it and the blood, body, and life of a small snake might just be enough to power such a dark locking enchantment. Harry had no doubt that the male snake, Jaculus, knew that a life would need to be given to enter the next room. Vipera seemed young and easy to influence and Harry doubted the poor thing knew that they were merely keys and nothing more.
"Merlin, Harry.” Draco groaned, crawling up the boy to kiss him again. He became distracted by Harry’s lips and when he pulled away he was caught off guard by the sly smile on his face.
“I’m sorry.” The small whisper nearly broke Draco’s heart and he sunk into the bed fully, pulling the dark-haired boy until Draco was underneath him, his arms fully encircling him.
"But I'm not a chaser." Draco said confused.
The rest of the day went by quickly and by dinner all of the team members and the bench players knew about their spots on the team. The Gryffindor table was alive with conversation and good cheer. Most of the people who tried out at least made bench, though there where a few disgruntled students who didn't make the team at all. Calls of, "Next year mate!" and "You should practice with us and maybe you can move up to bench!" could be heard over the roar. They were truly a family and Harry was grateful that his house and his team were so close.
"It's odd to hear a lecture on love coming from you, Severus." Lucius sneered and the words hit Severus harder than any curse could have.
"I see you haven't learned your lesson." Voldemort said mockingly. Instantly a path to the man cleared. "
"Difficult." Severus responded with ease. He made sure to add as much loathing and frustration to his words as he could muster. "He does not trust me in the slightest, though he has become at least grudgingly civil with me. I am afraid that I am no closer to achieving any real progress with him, however. These things take time."
Anyway, how are you? What have you been doing so far this summer? I’ve been spending my time running from Dudley, my horrible cousin.
-/A few days after the meeting at Diagon Alley: 30 days until September 1st\-
The weather hasn’t helped much, I’ve been meaning to practice flying on my broom. The rest of my days are filled with boredom. My summer is not that interesting so far. Now let me ask you a question for a change. Who are you living with? They sound like some bloody horrible people.
Hi...
Madam Malkin sets down her pins. “Alright, Mr. Malfoy, you’re done. Thank you for coming today.” she drones. Draco nods and starts to take off the robe carefully. Harry straitens in his chair. “You’re done? That was fast.” he stretches.
To Harry,
Hello! I’m Ky, the author of |Just Like Magic|. Anyhow, I’m thinking of having a sort of Q&A soon. You can ask me questions about the characters, story, or even some things about me! Maybe to celebrate 10 chapters? Let me know what you think about that and we’ll see what happens ;) Thank you again, and see you all in the next chapter! ~Ky )

-From H., the only boy who can’t wait for school to start.
You need to stop sending those hilarious drawings! When I got your letter last night, I laughed so hard Dudley almost punched me in the face for looking, and I quote, “Like a happy person”. Luckily, I had enough time to shove the drawing in my pocket and run. Besides that one small problem, my day hasn’t completely been the worst.
To Harry,
Harry smiled shyly as six pairs of eyes came to rest on him. “H-Hi.” he stammered his brain momentarily in a state of shock. Luckily Hedwig hooted again, expressing how much she wanted to be let out of the cage. The red-haired twins looked at Hedwig curiously. The one on the right nods toward Harry.“Nice owl, never seen a white one.”
George and Fred stopped their carts along a wall between Platform 9 and 10. “Can I go first?” they asked at the same time. The twins looked at one another and grinned. “Jinx! Jinx again!” The frazzled mother shook her head at their antics. “George, you go with Percy. Fred with me and Ginny. And Ronald…” The youngest boy looked up at his mother fearfully. “Ronald will have to go with-” she interrupted herself when she spotted Harry staring at them. “Oh hello there!”
Draco decides to stay with Harry while he's getting fitted for his robes. Then the boys go explore.
Still frustrated, the pale-faced boy stomped until he was right in front of the wall. He turned to his parents and was surprised to not find them behind him but standing adjacent to the wall. “Aren't you coming with me to the platform?” Draco asked, trying to keep the nervousness out of his voice. His father shook his head so his blond ponytail swung back and forth. “Son, we have early appointments and your mother would like to get more sleep.” he patted Dracos shoulder in what he believed was a fatherly gesture. “Good luck this year, Crabb and Goyle’s sons are expecting you to meet them on the train.” Draco could hardly conceal the disgust on his face, what his father meant was that those boys would watch him and report back to Mr. Malfoy if his son did anything wrong. Still scowling, Draco let his mother kiss his cheek and then watched as Dobby apparated away with a pop, and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy walked away into the crowd and disappeared from view. Draco clenched his fist angrily and discovered the paper still there. He shoves it deep into a pocket before walking through the wall.
( A/N: Wow, that was a looooooooong chapter. It took almost a whole week to write with school and all.
Most students were already on the train. Boys and girls leaned out of windows, waving wildly and calling to relations. All this made the platform very loud indeed. The twins, Ron, and Harry pushed through the crowd, arriving at the other half of the group just as little Ginny was complaining.
“Wait!” Harry stops and looks back at Draco, who was gaping at himself for saying anything. “Er, you left something Harry,” he says quickly. He bends to pick up a small bag that had been dropped by Harry. With a smile, Harry takes it. “Thanks, Draco! Imagine if I had left it here.” Draco nods absentmindedly. “Er Harry? Do you want to owl over the rest of the summer?” Harry smiles, “Of course, that would be great Draco!” With that, Harry waves at the pale-faced boy before walking away to catch up with Hagrid. Draco lets out the breath he’d been holding. That was easier than he had thought was possible. He walks in the opposite direction to find his mother, who was probably losing whatever marbles she still had.
"Who where your parents?"
" Sal asked, startling Harry. He had hardly noticed that he had made it back so soon.
.” Harry spoke clearly and yet nothing happened. “
"I would like to hear your plan further. It's decided. The rest of you are dismissed. One last thing though," Voldemort's face contorted into a look of maniacal delight. "Along with Potter and his friends, young Draco will now join the ranks of your top targets. Remember I only want Potter alive, he's mine to finish. But if you capture any of the others they are useless unless they have information. Kill them." A very feminine gasp rang clear in the open room and red eyes glared down at Narcissa Malfoy.
"Draco, I'm really sorry." Harry started as he walked slowly towards the boy. While he didn't turn to face Harry, he did move ever so slightly closer to him which Harry took as a good sign. "I know you’re mad at me and I know why. I should have told you everything, about my plan, how Luna was involved. I should have asked your opinion and had you help me. I know you don't want to hear this though. I can't change what happened, but maybe I can explain to you why."
Harry let the information sink it. It made sense, he supposed. If he was insane enough to rip his soul apart to keep from dying he would use sentimental objects as well, though it did seem rather dangerous. “So what are the others?”
Draco went straight to Ginny's side, doing his best to calm her. She was more startled than anything, but the Slytherin wanted to make sure that she was okay. Harry watched Draco take care of Ginny first before he made is way to the locker. A few quick spells let him know that the blood was not human and that there were no spells placed on or around the locker. He let out a sigh of relief at that. He had been worried that there might have been a spell placed on the door so that when it happened an unknown curse could have been placed on Ginny. Seamus and Dean left the locker room to get a teacher and the younger members left as well as to not over crowd Ginny, Draco, Harry, and Katie.
to be in Harry's clothes. He wanted more than anything to be surrounded by the brunet.
"I might not have known him, but I know that you loved him and he loved you. You were the son of his best mates, and like a son to him. If Sev died he would forgive me for working so hard that I'm not thinking of him all the time. He would have wanted that." Draco got slightly choked up at the mention of Severus. He had never known Sirius, but he assumed that he and Harry had a similarly close relationship that he had with his own Godfather and he couldn't imagine life without the dour potions master.
Harry hissed in parseltongue. At hearing the ancient language, Draco threw his head back and came screaming Harry's name like a mantra. When the thick, hot cum landed on Harry the boy felt his second orgasm of the night build and with two more strokes, he went over the edge, gracelessly falling on the blond when he was done. It took a while for them to catch their breath, but when they did, Harry moved off his lover and cast a cleaning spell. "I didn't know you got so turned on by parseltongue,

On the other side of the castle in the dungeons, two Slytherin students could be found conversing in one of abandoned classrooms. The boy was dressed in his pajamas, it was obvious that he had not planned on a meeting and he was more than annoyed with being dragged out on such a cold night. The girl was still dressed in her school robes, she was pacing the room, taking the time to glare at her cohort every time she passed him.
"Thank you for allowing us your space, I will see to it that they make it to their dorms okay." Snape said while Harry made his way back to Ginny's bedside. The girl was still asleep, but her bruises where healed and the dirt had been washed off her face and out of her hair.
charm if he didn’t need to. The Greengrass girl and Nott were taken care of for the moment, but Harry knew that when Dumbledore was gone Snape would be forced to let the two run around again.
." The added whisper brought giggles to Hermione, but Harry and Draco had the decency to pretend that they hadn't heard him. "I think it is time to sort out this mess, I expect you to fill me in on our agreement from yesterday as soon as possible."

“Hang on, my boy,” were the last words that Harry heard before an explosion rocketed through the small space making all sounds and sights disappear. The last thing the boy who lived felt was the impact of his body against the back wall before his entire world went black.
"Are you sure that's Snape?" Colin whispered at one point to Draco as he passed.
"As you wish, Bella." Voldemort hissed, a terrifying grin forming on his face.
“I will tell him to expect you after dinner. That will be all, Potter.” The smirk was evident this time and Harry felt his irritation slowly ebb away. Severus must know the feelings that had been brewing in him all week and unlike his friends was forcing him to see it head on. He loved that everyone had known to give him space, but it was also nice to be given a push especially when he needed it.
"Alright." Blaise agreed slowly looking between the two again, not sure what to make of them. They were acting so odd and moving in with Draco would provide him with the best opportunity to figure out just what was happening between the two. Beyond that, however, was the fact that Draco was his friend and he really did care about him. He wouldn't have left the boy alone even if Harry hadn’t been so insistent. "We'll move in tonight."
"Honestly Harry, you worry me sometimes." Luna laughed watching as he began to weave the complicated charm with his wand, but without speaking a single word. I amazed her to see such powerful magic being done with such ease, but she never doubted him and she rather enjoyed being surrounded by his power.
"Have you really been making them run laps all this time?" Draco asked amused that his absence bothered Harry that much. They hadn't defined their relationship the night before, but it was safe to say that whatever it was, it was exclusive and their feelings were mutual.
"I would never dream of it." Harry grinned cheekily, his eyes falling on Draco again and his look softened. "I'm really sorry I couldn't have been there sooner."
"Not as of yet, but I wouldn't mind it." Ginny grinned and Blaise nearly spit out his drink. Harry was used to her crude sense of humor, however, so he simply chuckled at her obvious tactics.
After a murmur of agreement, the four making the journey stepped away from the group and out the front door. Even with their magical signatures keyed on the house and the power of Harry’s own magic, they did not think it wise to try and apparate from inside the house itself. The would risk leaving themselves and the others open for discovery and attack so they walked in silence to the gate to the far west of the property, where a magical doorway had been built to lead them out of the heavy wards to an area where they could safely apparate to and from. Harry held out his arms and Draco, Blaise, and Pansy moved in close all making sure to hold on tight as he apparated them to their destination.
“I’m really happy for the two of you. Blaise is a good guy and you both seem to really be good for each other.”
“I will be spending the evening in the company of our esteemed former headmaster.”
Hermione was determined to fix up the rest of the second floor that day seeing as they only had two more guest rooms, the master bedroom, and the master bath to fix up. They had already agreed that for the most part they would just modernize the existing furniture, fix anything that was broken, and have the house elves pick up new linens for each room after Hermione chose what color to transfigure the walls to. It seemed simple enough and Harry secretly wished that it would take them little to no time. As much as he loved Hermione and Ron he just didn't want to deal with their bickering today. On top of that Ron was clearly in a bad mood and Draco's presence wasn't exactly helping.
"No." Draco sagged into Harry's arms, the tears that he had held back since leaving Severus' office coming back full force. "I'm so scared."
Knowing that Voldemort would stop at nothing to make sure his horcruxes were safe, Harry cautiously circled the pedestal checking for all traces of curses and jinxes. Satisfied that there was nothing of interest, Harry walked right up to the locket, waving his wand around the locket, surprised when there was no resistance. Carefully, Harry levitated the locked and waved his hand in the air to unlatch the locket. The folded parchment fell from the open locket onto the floor.
, and while the Headmaster might not be concerned, I am. I won't have you and your foolish friends running around this school creating havoc."
“Mm. Well this Christmas hols we will be in our new home, that will have to do, but until then I’m sure we could find something to keep us occupied.”
"Gin can have the couch and I can transfigure the armchair into a cot." Harry offered and Draco scoffed. He turned in Harry's lap to face him with an incredulous look on his face.

"Now Harry." Draco whined and Harry smirked down at him.
"You can never be too careful." McGonnagal said with pursed lips. Carefully, she pulled out an object from her pocket. The gold shined in the dim candle light and it took Harry a moment to recognize the time turner. "This is not the same as the one that I loaned Miss Granger in your third year. That one was my personal time turner. This one is yours. It was one of the many magical artifacts that your parents owned which they had placed in the care of the Order before their death. I motioned to have it returned to your vaults, but Dumbledore said he was still using it. When the Ministry came for him, I was able to take it back from his office. It's more powerful than mine, your father used it often in his time as an Order member as well as in school, though I could never prove it." The small smirk on the witch's face made a small, appreciative smile come to Harry's. He might not know much about his father, and what he did was not exactly the nicest coming from Severus' memories, but Harry could easily imagine Sirius running a muck with the time turner and the fond memories seemed to bring forth more happy feelings then sad as of late.
"Do you care for the boy?" Albus asked bluntly and the question startled the man before him.
"You can feel my magic now, can't you?" Harry laughed quietly, seeing the confused look on Draco's face. "Good, I want to test if I can control who notices it. We can kill two birds with one stone by visiting the Headmaster."
"I will, tomorrow." Harry replied vaguely, casting a
?" Snape asked, to change the topic. Albus let the conversation go and refocused on the dark object before him.
"You found a place to have our new headquarters?" Draco asked surprised. He was a bit hurt that Harry hadn't told him about it, but he understood why he would pick Luna, especially after what had just happened.
“I’m so glad you’re safe,” Draco pulled back far enough to look up at him, the joy in his eyes dampening just a twinge. “Where’s mum?”
Draco Malfoy was stunned when Harry moved from his relaxed state, jumping up with his wand drawn and sliding easily into a battle stance, eyeing him warily. It seemed that he realized whom he was holding is wand to and faltered for a moment before thinking better of it and regaining his composure. Draco was sure that he had been quiet, but the boy had clearly still heard him. Because of who his father was, Draco knew all about what had happened to Harry and his friends at the end of the last school year and he was sure that he was staring the consequences of that night in the face. Harry looked more prepared to fight than ever and Draco was not about to test him.
He watched, his gaze skipping around the empty field to the distance where the fence was that signified the edge of their property and the area that their extensive protection charms covered. Pansy went first with Blaise not far behind. Draco was last to go and it wasn’t until Harry saw him safely on the other side of fence that he broke out into a run, his wand gripped tightly in his hand to brace for an attack that he prayed would never come. It wasn’t until he jumped the fence before he allowed himself to breathe. The field was quiet, except for his own heavy breathing.
The first thing Harry knew he had to do was get his racing heart under control. He did his best to breathe in and out and focus on his surroundings. He thought of Draco’s laugh, Hermione’s smile, the way Ron looked after a particularly delicious meal. He thought of Luna’s gentle nature and Ginny’s burning intensity when her friends were in need. When he was certain that the ringing in his ears was gone he forced himself to focus on his surrounds. His sight and hearing were gone for the time being and he had to rely on his other sense and instincts. The cave smelt damp, he could tell through the stale air that it had been a long time since someone had visited this spot. He felt around with his wand and found a cave wall. The rocks were jagged and he was careful not to cut himself as he felt for the opening toward the corridor he had gotten a quick glance of before he had been plunged into nothingness.
"Since he put the ring on, how long does he have?" Dean asked. No one wanted to think that the old man might have just signed his own death warrant, but the issue had to be addressed.
Pansy slipped out from behind the suit of armor with ease. The hall was darker than most, there where very few lit candles in the area because it was seldom used, but the two boys could still make out the small smirk on her face. She moved closer to them and Draco reflexively let go of Harry's hand to pull the girl into a tight hug.
While the two continued to talk, Harry allowed his eyes to wander the cavern. There had to be a way through to the other side. If he could figure it out, it might prove to the snakes that he was trustworthy. With any luck he would be able to make it through and back before Dumbledore succumbed to the potion.
This time when they apparated there was nothing around them but trees. The only sounds were that of nature and Harry took a moment to breathe. He felt the hands on him loosen when he let out his breath. Draco stayed close, but Pansy and Blaise stepped back so they weren’t quite on top of each other anymore.
The figure before them turned from a battered and beaten Draco to a fully healed blond. His previously torn Slytherin robes were now clean and repaired, though now they were Hufflepuff robes.
"I wouldn't worry about that, if the way he was looking at you is anything to go by, there is no way you could botch this up." Ginny's grin was nearly a leer and it made Harry feel hot around the collar.
"He offered to get you for me." Harry responded lamely. While Hermione seemed to accept his response, her lips were pursed to show her disapproval. "I didn't want to talk to you two to fight, I know that I haven't been a good friend as of late and I know that you have a lot of questions, so I wanted to answer them before the meeting tonight." Harry offered himself up to his friends and while Hermione seemed to look approvingly at him, Ron just seemed to shake even more in rage.
"Nothing really." He tried to be evasive, but Snape grabbed him by the shoulders and got into his face.
“Well then, I think we’re all set here. Harry is calling a meeting in the library, would you like me to escort you?”
"Do you really think I'm going to let you sleep alone?" Harry smirked and leaned up to capture the boy in a gentle kiss.
"Later, but don't worry, it was very civilized." Harry assured, pressing a gentle kiss on his cheek.
"Show off." Draco muttered from beside Harry. Blaise, who sat on the blond's other side, nodded his head to agree.
"Merlin Harry, do you know how sexy you are?" The blond moaned, batting Harry's hand away when he tried to help. "No I told you, tonight is all about you, just watch."
“I think Hermione will be able to help with that, she had mentioned something exciting she’d been working on, she didn’t go into much detail, but she said it would be good for traveling, especially on sudden notice. Something about being able to carry a lot on us at any given time.”
Hermione slowly walked the isles of the Restricted Section in the back of the library. Most classes were in session and only the sixth year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs were on break so there were little to no students around to bother her. Pansy was walking in the opposite direction on the other side of the bookcase, while Harry stood seemingly lost in the middle.
With those parting words the core disbanded and they began to gather their most precious items in an organized silence. Hermione took each item, handling them with care as she filled her expandable bag, saving her own packing for last until they were all standing in the common room again.
"No, of course not." The man did his best to make amends, but he knew it was too late.
“Dumbledore gave me very important information, information that might just win us this war.” Harry paused a moment more before continuing. He told this friends about everything that he had learned about Voldemort’s horcruxes and what they might be.
"Well the reason is obvious, isn't it?" When Harry simply shook his head in confusion, Pansy continued a slight tone of aggravation creeping in. "Obviously he was upset that you took Lovegood with you to buy the land and not him. You didn't even tell him what your plans were before you left and if you're supposed to be so close, even soul mates as he's told me, then wouldn't you think that you would care more for his opinion and at least tell him what you're going to do."
"And just what might that be?" A voice from the door startled nearly everyone, but Harry who had felt more than seen another person enter the room. The level of raw magic hanging in the balance was nearly tangible and he was surprised that no one else had known that Snape had joined them.
Malfoy smirked at him and said only, "Sex."
"I'm back, Potter! Mum loaned me her Beatles' albums."
Emboldened by Potter's fearless attack, Draco leapt forward and bit the dog's hock. She yelped again, staggering around now on three feet while kicking out with the other as she attempted to shake Draco off. The dog stumbled and fell, compelling Draco to jump out of the way. Once she was down, he reentered the fray, biting her tail this time. He was only dimly aware of the door banging open once more.
Draco's brows drew together. "I don't understand."
Lucius cackled like a madman. "You have no power over me," he sneered. "And neither does that mewling brat," he added, pointing at Potter.
"Admit it, Harry," said Draco. "Healer Granger is the best at St Mungo's."
Draco turned to see Harry reclining on the bed.  "Harry!" he cried, flinging himself into his beloved's arms.
Snaperdinck let his sword clatter to the floor, and he stumbled back to sit on a wooden chair.
"There's only one way to find out for certain," Draco murmured, bending his head to string little kisses along Harry's jawline.
Once inside the darkened marsh, Draco asked Harry where he'd been for the past five years.  "I thought you were captured by the Dread Pirate Riddle."
She nodded once and left.
Hagrid made a grab for him, but the masked man ducked beneath the giant's legs and leaped onto his back and wrapped his arms around Hagrid's throat.  Hagrid was unable to reach his assailant.  He tried to knock him off by slamming his back against one of the boulders, but the masked man doggedly held on.  Eventually, lack of oxygen proved Hagrid's downfall.  He collapsed into a heap on the ground.
It was evening before Harry helped him out of the Floo at their London townhouse. He supervised while Draco changed into pyjamas, then tucked him into bed. Harry left to take a quick shower and change his clothes. He returned to the bedroom with a glass of water and some pain potion.
"I think she'd be delighted to," Harry replied. "Not only would she be getting an exceptional flight instructor and Quidditch coach, but you could step in and teach Potions if needed."
"Draco, son, please reconsider..."
"Simple," said the man.  "I put poison in both goblets.  I swallowed a bezoar, and it rendered me immune to the poison."  He pulled Draco to his feet and began leading him away.
Draco was exceptionally amorous that evening. After several minutes of enjoyable kissing, he nudged Harry's shoulder. "I want to top," he murmured.
Potter's lips curved in a grin. "Yes."
Before he felt the wrench of Apparation, Harry could have sworn he heard Malfoy say, "I picked up
"If you refuse to perform your spousal duties, I'll have no choice but to wank," said Draco. "And, considering I'm right-handed, that may put my recovery back several days-"
Harry gave Hermione a gentle nudge towards the exit. "I'll catch up to you later, yeah?"
Rodolphus made his way to the Shrieking Shack, where Harry was still strapped to the plank.  Suction cups were attached to Harry, and Rodolphus smirked while the ginger checked the various restraints.
Malfoy muttered something that sounded suspiciously like
"A simple spell will fix that," said Harry.
Harry wished he had a witty comeback, but the thinking part of his brain was growing sluggish. He heard Malfoy cast the appropriate charm, and it was followed by another, cruder charm. Harry flinched again at the cool, slick sensation that invaded his body, preparing him for penetration. He gulped as the enormity of what was about to transpire sank in.
Draco seethed.
Draco yawned and indulged in a full body stretch. "Who knew married sex was so tremendous?"
"Never mind," said Harry. "Just trust me; it's an apt comparison." He yawned, sat up, then shivered and ducked beneath the blankets once more. "Maybe we can convince the house-elves to save us some food."
Harry's tempo picked up, and Draco's right hand drifted between their straining bodies. He took himself in hand and tugged awkwardly at his cock. Harry straightened his arms to give Draco more room to maneuver.
Zabini only glared at him.  "When he reaches the top, kill him," he ordered.  Zabini grabbed the rope that bound Draco's hands and began tugging him away.
Meanwhile, back at the castle, Snaperdinck was making plans with Yaxley, his chief enforcer, to beef up security.  The Half-Blood Prince wanted the forest cleared of thieves and malcontents, and he authorized Yaxley to hire a squadron of men to see the deed done.
"Hm, if the best Healer in the world says so, it must be true," said Harry.
"You never said anything about killing the prince, Zabini."
"No, I think some ginger tea will settle my stomach," Draco replied. He rolled out of bed and padded into the en suite.
Harry laughed and came to perch on the edge of the tub. "You may wish to wait until after you've had your tea," he said. "Best to drink it while it's hot."
"Shush," scolded Draco. "Stop playing hard to get. We're married now, and you have your husbandly duties to perform."
"Immobilus!"
Some months later, Draco learned that Harry's ship was attacked by the Dread Lord Riddle.  The nefarious pirate was not known for leaving survivors, and Harry was presumed dead.  Draco locked himself in his room for days.  When he emerged, wan and gaunt, he vowed he would never love again.
"Yeah," Draco confirmed. The initial discomfort had passed, and he squirmed a little, wanting Harry to get on with it.
The guards panicked and ran, deserting their posts in favor of fleeing for their lives from the Dread Pirate Riddle.  Only Yaxley remained, and he was clearly frightened.
"It's about time you came," Malfoy said in clipped tones. He pivoted and stalked away, leaving the door to his suite wide open.
"Well, you were dead."
Harry recognized that gleam in Draco's eyes, and he wasn't about to argue. They went up to bed.
She narrowed her eyes on her hapless victims. "Now then, who's hungry? I'm a mite peckish myself, and you two look like a tasty pair of morsels." Her body blurred and transformed into a large, shaggy dog. She was an Animagus!
Snaperdinck, the Half-Blood Prince, announced that he would finally wed.  Snaperdinck introduced his intended to the populace as Prince Draco, and commanded that all bow before him.
"It's Snaperdinck!" hissed Draco.  He wanted to run, but it was too late.  The Half-Blood Prince and his men rode rapidly forward, surrounding Draco and Harry.
"Tosser," Draco snorted, grinning in spite of himself. Considering how well Harry treated him, he could submit to sex when he wasn't really feeling up to it. Draco stripped his breeches off and eased himself down on the pallet. When Harry joined him, Draco handed him the jar of oil.
"Winter-blooming witch hazel is far too delicate," said Draco. "Using warming charms near it may have compromised the potency of the blossoms."
Draco smacked Harry's arse and rolled out of bed. "Get moving," he ordered. "We're going to have sex in that tub, and it's my turn to top."
"I thought you said you were too old to keep up with me," teased Harry.
Over time, Draco came to realize that when Harry said, 'As you wish,' what he really meant was, 'I love you.'  It was around the same time that Draco realized he loved Harry just as much.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck as if embarrassed. "There's a ghost haunting my home, and I am hoping you can help me get rid of it." He appeared as if the confession pained him.
"Oh, but I want to feel your hands on me."
He greeted the owl with solemn formality. "Hello, Emmett. What brings you here today? Have you tired of Potter so soon?"
Draco opened for him willingly, stretching to reach the bottle of lubricant on the side table. He pressed it into Harry's hand and nonchalantly folded his own hands behind his head.
Harry was about to reply when he saw a group of horsemen gather at the crest of the hill.
Draco was intrigued. What did Saint Potter want? He hoped it was sex. Potter was looking fit these days, and he'd always been an itch Draco wanted to scratch.
The man in black sat opposite him and pulled a vial from his pocket.  He opened it and sniffed at it before handing it to Zabini.  "What do you smell?"
"Harry, if I wanted to listen to nagging, I'd ring Mum."
Malfoy's shoulders lifted in a nonchalant shrug. "Then you leave with your precious morals, and I leave with the name of your suspect."
"I think that was supposed to be my line," Draco deadpanned. He slitted his eyes open in time to see Harry goggle at him before Harry burst into laughter. Draco couldn't help but join in. He reached out and scrubbed a hand over Harry's head in rough affection.
Hedwig hooted from the cage he was holding, stirring Harry out of his thoughts. He dragged his trunk to the Information desk. The man behind the glass seemed to be asleep, leaning against the wall, spittle drooling from his open mouth. “Excuse me, sir? Sir!” The man’s eyes blink open. He yawns hugely. “Wh- what? Pardon?”
“Can I please go, mum? Please, please, pleeeeeease?” she begs. George laughs and scoops the little Weasley into his arms. She squeals in delight. “Ginny, you aren't the only one who wants you to come,” George says, making Ginny look into his eyes. Fred joins them. “But we need to be able to warn everyone at Hogwarts that the great Ginny Weasley is coming.” Harry was surprised by their serious tone. Next to him, Ron whispers “Wait for it Harry, don’t be fooled.”
Oh no, Uncle Vernon, is at the door, yelling at me to go to bed. Got to go, write back soon!
Draco stifled a laugh. “Talking while eating doesn’t make the food taste better you know,” he says. “And it's disgusting.” Harry ignores him, shoving more chips in his mouth. Draco, on the other hand, was eating his fish and chips in what most people would call a more dignified way to eat. After finally swallowing his bite, Harry smiled. “I was just saying how great this food is, it’s almost…..-” he paused, not sure if his thought was stupid. “Magical?” Draco finishes for him. “Well, it is. What do you expect?”
“Alright, Mr.- what’s your name again? You are done, just sign a few things so I may send your robes to you.” Madam Malkin says. Harry takes the quill that had been poking him and writes his name on the papers before setting them face down on a nearby desk. “Thank you, Madam!” Harry says. Then he turns to Draco. “Shall we go then? I’m starving!” Harry grabs his supplies, piling them up in one hand to open the door. Draco follows, debating with himself if he should help or not.
Harry and the Weasleys arrive at the platform.
-From Draco Malfoy, the bloodiest most brilliant artist, totally not nervous about school.
How do you expect me to answer all of those questions? It seems that’s all you do, ask too many questions. Where do they come from? Yes, you remembered my address. I’m surprised you did. Hedwig seems to be an, ah, good owl. She’s nipping my fingers to hurry up at this very moment. Maybe you should get her trained. The amount of books is a bit concerning to even me. Will we ever have free time? I’ve started skimming them because of the lack of anything to do here. Besides that, I haven’t found much of anything to do this summer.
The drawing is amazing, as you can expect from the great Draco Malfoy. Have you shown your parents yet? I have a feeling they will think they are as bloody brilliant as I think they are. Did you enjoy my horrible drawing of Hedwig? She would not stay still enough for me to get a good angle. Of course, that’s just my excuse if anyone asks why it’s so badly drawn.
Hello! Are you Draco Malfoy or did I remember your address wrong? I hope my owl found you, she seemed a bit anxious when I had tied the letter to her leg… Do you like my owl? Her name is Hedwig, a name she picked for herself by pecking at my school books. Speaking of books, why did we have to get so many? I don’t even want to imagine the amount of homework we’ll be doing in a few months.
Anyways thank you again for being patient and hopefully not giving up on me. I've made a new schedule to get chapters done faster. I can't make any promises but I want chapter 8 to be done in like 3-4 weeks.
Harry thinks about that. “So you stay with the houses for the entire time you’re at school? Sounds brilliant to me.” Draco composes himself and turns his head back to say “Yes, my family has always been in Slytherin. So that’s what house I’m going to be in.” he says confidently. Madam Malkin clears her throat. “Mr. Malfoy, if you do not stand still for at least a moment then your robes will be too small this year,” she says. Draco stills, “Yes Madam Malkin. Sorry.” Harry smiles at Draco’s back. For someone who had such an imperious attitude, Draco definitely was scared of Madam Malkin. A comfortable silence settles in the shop. Harry, absorbing the info about Hogwarts, and Draco, feeling embarrassed by the fact he had gotten scolded in front of a complete stranger.
-/Two weeks later: 16 days until September 1st\-
Soon, they were ready. For what they were ready for, Harry didn’t know, but he hoped they would get to the platform soon. Every time he glanced at the clock on the wall near them it seemed to be getting nearer and nearer to 11:00. He pushed his cart beside Ron, who seemed to be sleeping standing up. “Excuse me, Ronald?” Harry says and taps the boy's shoulder lightly.
Draco pulls Harry away. “Time to go, we’re fogging up the glass. Let’s get food,” he says to Harry. “Fine. But can we come back?” The two boys push through the crowd, only staying together because of their still held hands.
“Oh really?” The pale boy drawls, breaking the tense silence. “And who are you? Defender of the stupid I reckon.” Harry clenches his hands. “I’m Harry, for your information.” Ferret Face smiled. “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Nice to meet you.” Draco waited for a reaction, but Harry just stared blankly at him. Ignorant fool! He thinks.
Counting down the hours until I finally leave. Goodnight!
There was no escaping it, Harry had to tell him. “Er, Platform 9 ¾ ?” he says slowly. The sleepy man laughs. “That doesn’t exist, what is your platform?” I should’ve asked Draco where the platform is in my last letter, Harry thought to himself. Then I wouldn’t be in this mess.
Apologies that my “bloody brilliant” drawing put you in near peril. `In my opinion, your cousin can go fu-. I’m just going to leave the rest to your imagination. My parents could care less about what I do, and much less about my drawings. If my parents ever saw them, which they never will, a conversation about “focusing on work” and “wasting time” would probably follow. Not that I would say the same for your Hedwig drawing. The precision! The emotion! The abstract shape of her rectangle head, on top of an inverted octagon!
Draco goes to stand in front of him. “I guess you’re next then. I’ll be going then…” Harry stands. “Wait, can you stay? You don’t have to, but you seem to know loads of things so maybe-” he stops rambling abruptly at Draco’s look. “Me, help you?” Draco says. “Why should I?” Harry smiles. “Because I don’t know a thing about anything magic and you probably know loads.” He says, trying to butter Draco up. “Aaand, you seem like a good person.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “Hmmm…. I’ll think about it,” he says and walks toward the door. Harry goes to Madam Malkin. “I’m ready for my fitting Madam.”
