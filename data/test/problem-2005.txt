Draco turned around and made his way to the bathroom. He needed a bath, urgently, and now that his wound was looking better he could risk it. He opened the water tap and started undressing carefully. The stitches were still there, but it was less tender and had deflated a bit. The ointment Potter had used had been worth the arousal, apparently.
“There you are, my little monster” they both laughed. They almost looked like good friends, and as concerning as that might have been, Harry had to admit that he liked it. When he took his place in front of Hermione, she sent him a knowing look, but he chose to ignore it. She was one to be judging when five minutes ago she was being all nice to a guy she allegedly hated.
“I know what you mean” he offered and the blond almost smiled “I already wrote to Hermione. I’m seeing her tomorrow, but I need to confirm if you are fine with me telling her everything”
” he voiced, and after a second, or maybe two, the door clicked and opened like it had never been closed.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked and Draco nodded, regretting it seconds later, when Harry took his fingers out and he felt empty. Luckily, it didn’t last long and the emptiness was substituted by a delicious burning as his entrance tried to accommodate to Harry’s size. He was thicker than Draco had calculated and it was driving him crazy. He could barely focus his gaze on anything else than Harry’s eyes, green covered by the blown pupils. He was looking at him, intensely, his lip trapped between his teeth in an attempt to control himself from thrusting the whole way inside the blond.
“When I’m stuck with work I have two options: I drink until the answer comes magically or I plot about inventing a magical device to do everything for me” Harry had looked amused at that “I always end up drunk” he had finished and Potter had laughed, but something must had come to his mind, for the next second he had been up and running towards the door, followed by a very confused blond.
“I know you did, dear, but I should have anyway. Come along, I’ll show you the guest room in case you need some privacy while you are here” Narcissa moved towards the stairs and he smiled softly.
Draco’s breathing speeded up. He was afraid, terrorized of snakes. He needed to get out of that place.
“Come on, what are you waiting for?” Draco was standing still, looking without blinking at the scene in front of him. That was just too much. Harry-Bloody-Potter, a damn hot piece of trouble, riding a bike and he was just supposed to keep living after that. Not fair.
“I told you how I felt when Voldemort’s soul started to manifest itself. The symptoms I had are very similar to yours now and there is the event from two nights ago”
I changed Anastasia's situation a little bit. She was considered to have survived for a long time anyway, I just played with the dates.
“Hey” he whispered back “I’m sorry I woke you” Harry smiled again. His eyes were only half open from sleep and he looked completely adorable. That man was just unfair.
“You are the posh git, with me everything is casual” he teased back and Draco looked at him incredulously.
“Hey there, buddy” the kid left a sonorous kiss on his cheek and started talking about some amazing trick he had managed to do with the broom Harry had gifted him for Christmas last year.
she had told him, and yeah, she was right, he had better luck on that department, women were just not his thing. Saving the world had been way easier than kissing a girl.
“You’re right. I’m sorry” the boy looked at him for a moment before nodding “We are in Moscow; we came here to find a way to help you” Alexei seemed surprised for a moment, but the next one he was running towards the window and pulling the curtains open.
“We can’t allow that” he kissed Draco deeply and roughly. He only restrained himself from biting too hard for obvious reasons “We have to wait until Monday, though. The school won’t have us any sooner”
When they broke apart, Draco was still smiling and had a funny glitter on his eyes, that was quickly substituted by surprise and something like fear.
“Why am I here?” he repeated the prior question, while wrapping himself with a blanket, and Harry cursed in his mind, that was one he could not answer.
Teddy’s letter was mostly Andromeda’s letter with a drawing and a note from his godson asking him to be back soon and telling him that he missed him terribly. They were doing fine, and Harry hated himself for having to ask her for a favor, but he knew she would understand, even if it didn’t please her. She was Narcissa’s sister after all.
He opened his eyes to found a snidget-like bird in front of him, flapping its wings and moving around his head gracefully. Draco found himself amazed at how much his mind went back to Potter for protection over and over again. He trusted the savior far too much, more than he had ever imagined he would trust someone. He was not a trusting person. He had faced enough betrayal and deceive in his life to go around putting his secrets or, in this case, his life in anyone’s hands. He had made his way on his own, he had the same few friends he had always had, he hadn’t been in a relationship for years, just because he was not brave enough to trust, he was to scared, to self-preservative. And there he was, ten years after the last time he had seen Harry, since a war were they had different sides and opposite roles and he was naturally using his presence to calm down, his memories to dare; he was being vulnerable, defenseless, because he knew Potter would be there.
“Harry! You are back!” they stayed hugged to each other until Harry stood up and the boy moved to pick the puppy up again.
“Where is he?!” he asked again. He knew the answer but he needed to know. Death raised a bony finger and pointed the arc.
“Fuck, Draco. If you do that I’ll lose it” he warned and it drew a pleased smile in Draco’s face, so, obviously, he did it again and Harry buried his face in his neck while his orgasm took over his body, sending Draco over the edge too.
“Okay, I have an idea, and you are not going to like it, so I’m already informing you that I don’t give a fuck, I’m doing it anyway”
They talked about Luna’s research, the twins, her father, Rolf, about Harry’s work, Neville, Teddy, and anything that came to their minds. The girl was telling him something about the Quibbler’s new photographer when his wand started releasing red sparkles. That was the alert for an emergency so he quickly checked his card where Draco’s name was glowing.
As the bright red light touched him, the runes started to move around his neck, they felt hot and before Draco could register what was happening, a sharp pain stabbed him in the middle of the chest. He hissed, and grabbed the sheets to control himself, but he couldn’t help the cry that came from his deep throat. His eyes were shut, the warm from the letters extended down his chest and as soon as it had started, the pain stopped, leaving him panting and sweating.
“I don’t use to give a diagnosis without having all the evidence, but I know you and you won’t let this go, will you?” he shook his head and Potter sighed “It looks like a blood issue, probably related with coagulation cells, but those are not common in wizards, specially not your age. I need to make some tests and find out the whole story, but my guess is you’ve got yourself a complicated muggle disease” Draco knew he wasn’t being entirely honest, but that was the same every mediwizard had told him with twice the information Potter had, so he had to be good.
“Coming” he walked, slowly, holding his side and containing the pain. Harry had given him a potion for the stiffness but it had worn out a couple hours ago and he had had no intention of standing up to get another dose or to do anything, for that matter.
“Is there something in this world that hasn’t happened to you? You have like, the worst luck ever, you know?” Harry obviously didn’t want to laugh, but he did anyway.
“As I was saying, I remember being forced to memorize the whole family tree of the British royal family”
“I don’t know how to tell you this, it’s hard to believe, even for me, and that’s saying something” Draco’s irritation was obvious, so the other kept going “I think you were possessed” silence fell upon the room. The blond stared at his healer, who was chewing his bottom lip nervously. Draco’s memories weren’t clear, but he could see himself talking to Harry, feeling confused and scared, but that was it. Now, even when it should have sounded ridiculous, he believed it.
“I was worried, you, ungrateful monster. You are just nice to Hermione” he sounded hurt, but Draco knew it was joking and chuckled.
“Fine, I agree with this” he said so softly he doubted for a second that they had heard him, but it seemed like they did because his mother whispered a relieved
“It’s fine, honey, I know you get absorbed by your work, but you can’t expect a mother to renounce to her time with her beloved son” she was already finishing a cup of tea, but poured herself a fresh one, as did Draco.
Draco decided he would investigate the thing with the fire and ice in this place later. For now, he would enjoy it.
“What are you talking about?” he explained and Draco’s expression turned into a horrified one “I’m not doing that!”
Harry was answering, his lips were moving, but he couldn’t hear him. Suddenly, everything was foggy. He closed his eyes again, and he didn’t remember opening them back.
“I have a shift at the hospital, but I had to bring you these. Take one before each meal until I get the new medicine done” he left the vials in the bedside table with a note specifying the amount and time in case the blonde forgot it.
“I bet” was Harry’s comment, but he had to look away from the blond to hide his blushed cheeks, and he was not hot, not that way at least.
“You can ask the elves for anything you might need. I know this is Draco’s house, but if I had taught him anything there should be no problem with you making yourself comfortable”
Had that really happened? Was the room in Grimmauld real? Was he dreaming? No, he was looking for Harry and he was right there.
“Is there any possibility that this illness is causing me to feel…like I’m not myself?” the dark-haired man stared at him, but not as Draco had expected. There was no mockery in his expression, he just seemed to be thinking about it, and it irritated Draco to no end.
They finished that movie and went through their options for the next one. It was Draco’s turn to pick. He didn’t know any of the titles but one of them called his attention.
He opened his eyes, but it took a moment for them to adjust to the light that came from the window. When he managed to focus, he gasped.
“You are finally back” the voice whispered. Draco saw a shadow but he didn’t dare to move. He was confused, he was sure he had never been there, and yet his companion was implying it was not the first time they met “Or should I say, you are finally here?” yeah, that made more sense. He wanted to answer but he couldn’t find his voice. He had the vaguest feeling that talking to that person was not going to bring anything good.
“That’s an understatement” Malfoy joked “But it was not your fault” he seemed conflicted about what he was going to say, but he swallowed hard and spoke “I tend to have panic attacks. I have since I was in school” he was not looking at Harry, but he could guess what the blond meant.
“And Alexei? Why keep him in a void instead of sending him away with his family like you intended? He though you cared about him” poor boy.
“Then there is no one better to detain him” another voice spoke. One Harry was a little bit more used to “You will agree with me that we must found out how is this possible” said Alexander, stepping inside the room “You must forgive my tardiness. I am too old for that bloody passage”
Harry felt dizzy. Why was his heart beating so fast? It was just his reflection over and over again. But, why? Why would someone put so many mirrors in a broom cabinet? Why was his wand there? Had Draco been there too?
He knew Alexei had been the cause, but he could not blame the boy. They could control him to a certain point; and being in front of his family memorial was too much of a trigger. He had broken the connection, something probably risky, but he didn’t know if it was permanent, if it had even worked or if Draco had passed out from the shock. He could not ask for help without having to explain the situation and that was not an option.
Harry was as excited as he was tired. He had had a couple of bad nights and he seemed to be getting too old for that. He had no idea what time was it, since he had left his watch and wand on the room and he couldn’t cast a damn
Somehow, after some time none of them was eating anymore, looking at each other intensely instead. Draco’s gaze moved to Harry’s lips and he licked them unconsciously. Harry was not sure if he had imagined it, or Draco was actually getting closer, but he panicked.
Some of the tags were missing, some were unreadable, some orbs were broken or had been covered with some kind of paint and after an hour, Harry had only covered a third of the room. He was starting to believe that Rasputin had been nothing more than an uncontrolled fool that had gotten too high and it had all gone to his head, when his sight got attracted to a small ball covered in dust, labeled in 1908, and which characters matched the ones written by Alexander with both Rasputin’s and Alexei’s name.
“That’s just a little bit less weird, but acceptable” she knew they hadn’t talk since the end of the trials, and that even when Harry felt no animosity for the Slytherin anymore, their relationship had never been the best one.
“Yes, but I didn’t get it, it was in Russian” he scratched his head embarrassed, and Draco stop the thought of him looking adorable. Not the time “I tried to touch you, I thought at first you were just confused for the medications, but it pushed me back and kept talking. The only thing I got to understand before you passed out again was a name. I think whoever possessed you was trying to let me know who he was, and if I have to guess, he didn’t do it on purpose”
“Mom!” he called. He went to check the garden out of habit but she was not there. He turned to go back inside but he stopped, a boy, around ten years old, with blue hair and blue eyes, who he had seen only in pictures, was standing in front of him with a puppy in his arms.
“Hey there” he greeted the young tabby cat that was wrapping his tail around Harry’s leg and purring while he caressed his orange fur. Draco was quiet beside him and Harry looked up to him “Are you okay?”
“Draco?” the blond had fell limp. He had stopped talking “Draco, are you ok?” Harry shook him slightly but he didn’t wake up. After a couple spells, he decided the wizard was just exhausted from the blood lost and after giving him a Dreamless Sleep potion he sat back in a chair to watch him rest.
“Merlin. Don’t ever say that again, not even kidding, man. I have a heart to look after” he laughed, and wave them goodbye before picking up his stuff and Teddy’s and making his way to carry the boy.
On the way there, Ellias had shown them a couple touristic places like the Red Square and the Kremlin and some establishments where they could eat if they wanted to go out in the city at some point. Draco doubted they would do that since it was late and he was tired and the answer for their request should be ready in the morning, but he paid attention anyway.
“Excuse me? I must have misheard you, I thought you said Malfoy just now” Harry chuckled at his friend tone.
“No” the answer came quickly and it made Draco blush, but Harry made no comments about it “You haven’t told me the rest of your theory”
“I’m good, it’s almost ready. Have some wine” the girl moved automatically around the kitchen and opened the small door to the bodega, getting a bottle and serving the two of them. “So, what have you been up to?”
“I haven’t been here in ages” Narcissa exclaimed as she entered the receiving hall of the house “It has changed a lot, but I can still feel the old magic” she was running her hand over the couch’s surface feeling the soft velvet stroking her palm.
“Welcome, Master and Master’s friend” an old house elf, with impossibly clear blue eyes was taking Harry’s case and levitating it towards the upper floor.
The proud dragon could fall a thousand times and even if he could open his wings by his own, Harry would always be there to help him fly again.
“Food is ready” she enjoyed those words, she really did, and that’s why Harry had let her bring the food to the table. They all gathered and took their sits. Ronald took a chicken leg and broke the ice. Everyone joined him and, for a few minutes, with no other sound than clicking glasses and compliments for the chef, they looked like a normal family.
They walked all the way to the other side of the library, passing bookshelf after bookshelf until they reached a squared platform with a green carpet as floor. Alexander indicated for him to step by his side on the platform and pointed his wand to it. Before knowing, Harry was floating all the way up to the second level of the library like in an elevator.
“The Black family house?” Draco asked. He had heard about Sirius Black being Potter’s godfather back when they were in third year, but it had been just a rumor back then.
He felt the flow of his own power through his body, something he had learnt to do while studying wand-making so he could imbue the materials with his magic to transform, for example, a simple piece of wood into a functional wand. He did not found any disorders in the course of his magic, but that was nothing definitive. The only thing that startled him was the now usual feeling of sharing his body, the difference being that, this time, he knew that it was the case.
Twenty minutes later they were in the balcony, breakfast spread on the table. They talked about his father, her mother telling him how he kept blushing when she was there and how he had continued to court her with flowers and compliments. The doctors had nothing new to say, but she seemed content with her husband current state. It could be worse.
“It’s a different culture, prince. Although, a heads up would have been nice” Harry would probably kick Ellias’ ass.
“Is not about you cutting your hair, babe” he answered. He had come with the idea after Draco had left the room that morning, still tasting him on his tongue, the thought of skipping too many stages had come to him and stayed there the entire day. He wanted his relationship with Draco to be special, in a nice way. Sure, they had not started in a particularly romantic situation, but he wanted to make Draco fall in the best way he could. He had not been lying when he said he was not a good boyfriend, he had never been, he was not one for details, but he was set on making things work, and he would “I want to take you on a date” he said to the blond who stopped moving his hands and shifted his position on his lower back so he could look straight at Harry.
just in case. Then undressed him and started applying ointment in every hematoma that covered his body. He had not hurt himself beyond that, but it was not normal to develop those bruising spontaneously. Yet, again, Draco’s illness had very little of normal.
Second day had been destined to picking Draco’s stuff and telling Narcissa about their plans. That had been something worth seeing. She had constantly been taking things in and out of Draco’s suitcase and kissing him in a very Molly-like way.
Draco’s heart was going to stop working any minute at that rate. He glanced at the ring, remembering every meaning of the blue-sapphire he had ever heard: honesty, trust, loyalty; it was considered the gem of the soul. He looked into Harry’s eyes and saw every single one of those things promised there. That man was offering the world to him and he still was asking if Draco would accept.
“Come on, Harry. You know there is more, a lot more. Don’t be so hard with yourself” he wanted to say something else, but couldn’t get the words out. Harry gave him a half smile that didn’t reach his eyes, but Draco had no idea how to fix that.
Harry only registered the last event. He dropped next to Draco, holding him and looking for his pulse while a blue fire circle appeared around them, making the room fully visible for the first time.
“I want to take you out on a date, a proper one. I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like we have gone too fast” Draco raised an eyebrow “Not in a bad way, but I want to court you like you deserve, like I would have if we had met again on different circumstances, I want to do this right, Draco” he stopped, feeling embarrassed. He was not a cheesy person; he would almost never speak about his feelings or try to show them so enthusiastically, and he had just blurted all that out without even blinking “You can say no, of course, but, would you please go on a date with me, Draco Malfoy?” the other wizard stared at him with a blank expression for a moment, a way too long moment if you asked Harry.
Draco wanted very badly to ask why they broke up, but they were on a no-personal-questions basis, and really, what was the point in knowing? A single Potter was still unavailable because he was straight.
that I needed to know that, mind you. Come on. Why are you and Harry still fighting? You owe me that much. Hermione and I haven’t –” he smirked at this point, “well,
Harry chuckles. ‘Sorry. I forgot.’ And he tells Malfoy what a telly is, and the few times he was allowed to watch it in his childhood, and the other times he lingered in stores with tellies to catch a glimpse of a show he liked. Malfoy listens carefully, his head still cocked, the silky blonde hair that he wears long and loose now spilling over a shoulder. Looking at him, Harry has to remember to tell himself to breathe.
Draco was gasping, his breathing wet and desperate. He pulled his hands away, tears cold on his cheeks. He stared unseeingly at Myrtle, the sight of her pigtailed head half in and out of the toilet stall tragically comic.
That wipes the levity out of the situation, and Hermione deftly turns the conversation towards DA sessions, asking Harry what he plans on teaching next. Draco scowls to himself, wondering why people are so caught up in sex. It seems like all too much trouble for a few seconds of relief. It’s unfathomable.
They were kissing again, lips sliding against each other, tongues meeting, hot and wet. The omega had his arms locked around Eltanin's waist, his hands cupping Eltanin's arse, pressing his groin hard against Eltanin's. His hips jerked, the bulge in the front of the tight trousers of Gryffindor fashion meeting Eltanin's growing hard-on.
‘I’m surprised it took so long,’ he said with a shrug. ‘I have been expecting it since my parents disowned me—and society had always taken their cue from the Malfoys,’ he interposed with an ironic smirk. ‘They couldn’t toss me out of here, because the Manor always likes me better than it liked them.’
He lets go of his legs, stretching them out, as he turns to face Harry properly. Grey eyes scour Harry’s face. Draco slips his arms around Harry’s waist, his face questioning. When Harry rolls his eyes and drags him in closer, the blond smirks and locks his hands behind Harry. They are close enough for Harry to feel Draco’s cool breath on his cheek, for Harry to see the way Draco’s eyes are silver in the starlight.
As he spoke, his voice faltered. It seemed that wherever Dumbledore and Potter had gone, it had weakened the great wizard – vastly so. Potter stepped closer to Dumbledore, but his master shook his head, waving him away.
Draco’s skin itches, even when they leave the shop behind and the Bubble-Head Charm is removed. He clutches his wand, cool and lifeless in his hand, seeing the worry on his parents’ faces. He knows that no stick can ever make him the wizard he needs to be.
Now, Harry stares at him, mouth agape. His astonishment is great enough to be comical. Draco would have laughed in any other circumstances. But not now, when they have come to the moment when Draco must lay things bare. He must have had hoped that this day would come eventually, because the only emotion coursing through him is one of relief. Every breath he takes seems to dissipate in a vacuum in his chest, and when he raises a hand to push his hair back, he sees that he is trembling.
As they argued over who should claim the glory of handing a seventeen-year-old boy over to a psychopathic maniac, Draco stared at Potter, who stared back, unable to look away.
He could scream at the smirking Slytherin courtiers, tittering at him behind fans and handkerchiefs.
He looks after her wearily, and turns back to Neville. ‘Does this mean I’m fighting with Ron, Draco and Hermione now?’
He spat a wad of blood and saliva at Potter’s feet, causing Potter to surge forward barely restrained by his friends, and spun around, elbowing his way out of the circle of watching Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. He walked down the corridor, alone, shaking with suppressed rage and revulsion, followed by hundreds of eyes waiting for him to trip and fall.
But he can still help. He saw Voldemort attacking Mr Weasley—as a snake; is Voldemort an Animagus?—and Ron’s dad would have died if he had not told Minnie in time. Knowing what Voldemort is doing is saving lives, but Dumbledore becomes only graver when he hears how Harry knew, and he makes Harry take Occlumency lessons with
‘I am embarrassed to admit that I was impolitic in my last meeting with Malfoy. I would like to make it right by him. Perhaps you might be so kind to advise me on how I might achieve it.’
He was telling Draco about Granger’s revenge on Weasley for hooking up with Brown. Who knew Gryffindors could have love lives as unnecessarily complicated as Slytherins? Draco had always supposed everybody was like Potter, who blundered into things without knowing if it was obtuseness or bravery.
Harry’s duties as Malfoy’s guide mostly involve bringing the prince around the office, explaining investigation techniques, attending this or that briefing. The worst of it is pretending to be Malfoy’s boyfriend to scare off the unhealthy number of obsessed stalkers; worst, because Harry gets to hold Malfoy’s hand, but can go no further.
He closes his eyes, but there are wingbeats in the air, and when he opens his eyes, another Veela—an alpha—is standing over him, arms folded across his chest, eyes narrowed in scrutiny. ‘So, you’re the disturbance in the forest,’ he says in heavily accented English.
Draco nodded. “Nearly every day for the first year, then a few every month for the next two. I receive one or two every three months now, like a present I had forgotten I had bought for myself.”
Draco’s composure snapped. He was bloody tired and he was cold and Potter was standing in front of him, looking fit as hell, his green eyes piercing and knowing. This was punishment for outing him, wasn’t it? Privately, Draco knew he deserved it.
Harry doesn’t mind the dying so much; it is knowing what his death will do that lodges, jagged, in his throat. Will his death mean Draco’s? The thought is nearly enough to make him consider fleeing with Draco—somewhere far away where this war doesn’t reach—but he knows that it will also be impossible to live knowing he has condemned Britain to Voldemort.
‘Yes,’ Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. ‘I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true. We were sixth year –’
Potter’s eyes were dark and serious, unflinching from Draco’s face. Draco took Potter’s chin in his hand, tilting his head back slightly.
‘Here you go,’ Ron said cheerfully, setting the drinks down on the table. He caught sight of their hands and raised his eyebrows. ‘What did I miss?’
He barrelled around the corner, apologising breathlessly as he bumped into people. The little man was scurrying along, head ducked down behind the upturned collars of his black coat. Harry slowed once he had visual contact of the man. He stopped in an empty shop’s entrance and when the crowd eddied to briefly reveal a clear path, placed an Undetectable Tracking Charm on Luc. Satisfied, Harry stepped off the door stoop and continued following the man.
seen Lydia’s inebriated state and the unconscious officer left behind in the room. He was not so indiscrete to talk of his suspicions of a scandal in persuading Bingley to leave, but his arguments against the Bennets’ undesirable connections and defects as marriage prospects were sound and passionate enough to persuade Bingley to attempt to cool his ardour for Miss Jane Bennet.
!’ he roared at the hesitating Death Eaters, stabbing his wand in their direction and destroying a wall. They didn’t hesitate after that, not even Yaxley; Snape had killed Albus Dumbledore. He yanked Draco after him.
He sees the tall, winged figure from the end of the lane, and the dizziness thickens in his mind, a sense of unreality wrapping around him. He is unsurprised: every step forward is inevitable, a future memory he has already known. It isn’t fifteen metres to his front gate, but the five years he was gone.
The heat snapped in Eltanin's belly, and he gave a strangled shout, shoving in close, and he was knotting the omega, his cock pulsing deep in the other boy's wet tightness. His mind whited out with the bright heat of bliss.
Harry surveys the perturbed atmosphere at what remains of the breakfast table: Kitty  nervously picking at her food; Lydia stoutly finishing her toast; and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet’s shared bewilderment. He shakes his head, and begins to compose a reply to Mary and their uncle Gardiner. With his careful husbanding of the household expenses, he is assured that a stay in London would not be without sufficiently diverting entertainment.
Another man—a Gryffindor beta—seizes Eltanin by the shoulders, helping Blaise pull him back. Together, they drag him back into the corridor, even as he growls and struggles every step of the way, desperate to get back to his omega. "Mate," he croaks, voice strangled. "
‘Is that so?’ Malfoy is smiling a little now, his expression tinged with both amusement and impatience. ‘I did not know you were such an astute studier of conversation-making, Mr. Bennet. When do you judge there to be sufficient conversation?’
Draco shudders; so, it was Voldemort who nearly killed him. ‘But how? How did he get into a book? Are there other things he could put himself into?’
They find an empty compartment for Draco towards the end of the train. They had passed a few relatively empty compartments occupied by students from the families that have shunned the Malfoys after Draco’s kidnapping. Mrs Parkinson didn’t deign to look at them when they walked past, something that caused Mother to smile wryly.
He chuckles. ‘I am doing my best to keep the wood lice at bay, my dear.’ He returns his bright, sharp gaze to Harry. ‘And now … young Harry Potter will receive his first wand, eh? Yes, yes, this will be interesting …’
‘What fine hunting we will have!’ he cried. ‘Mr. Bennet, I do hope you will join my party and I in our hunting when we are more settled here. I am most happy to find such welcoming neighbours in Hertfordshire. Why, I have not lacked for dinner invitations since I came!’
Draco could already feel the green-eyed creature made of shadows and hatred looming behind him, its claws dripping with his blood. He closed his eyes. Only, he knew he wouldn’t run. He would turn and look at him, because he wanted the last thing he saw before he died to be Harry Potter.
The inside was actually pleasant, taken into consideration the street outside. The place had clearly been a restaurant once, most of the tables and chairs neatly stacked up against the windows. The left side of the room contained two beds – one tidily made, and the other a rat’s nest of blankets and pillows. Next to the beds were cupboards being used as dressers and nightstands. There was a table with a stack of books and rolls of parchment.
Harry goes still. From this angle, the light from the fire turns his glasses reflective, his eyes opaque. His feelings stealing across their bond are cold enough to burn at the touch, and Draco shudders. Harry’s voice is expressionless, when he speaks. ‘And it’ll be so terrible for people to think we are together?’
“You didn’t tell anybody, did you?” Draco blurted, grabbing at anything to distract him from his treacherous thoughts. “That I’m a Veela now?”
He looked up. Lord Voldemort was examining him like he was a piece of furniture he did not particularly care for. Like something to be discarded before it became an eyesore.
Draco’s poor performance in class was attracting the teachers’ attention as well. McGonagall would give Draco her infamous, pinched-lip look of disapproval and Snape was asking to meet Draco, something Draco had been putting off with excuses of Quidditch practice.
‘Mr Harry Potter,’ he pronounces. ‘Ahh … I remember when your parents first came in here for their wands. Eleven inches, mahogany, deer heartstring core for your father—a loyal, steadfast wand. And your mother’s was ten and a quarter inches, willow, unicorn hair—a powerful wand, very good for delicate charm and potion work, which I heard were her special skills. I wonder … what wand will choose you?’
wish to speak of the war? It is in the past. It is over. The dead are buried. Why does the living insist upon clinging to them? Memorials and anniversaries and rituals – I have no need for them! Let the dead stay buried! If
Coward that he was, Draco turned back around and ran towards the gates. Potter screamed something, his words ripped apart by the wind and the sound of the castle collapsing behind them. Snape was shouting.
Potter purses his lips, narrowing his eyes. ‘Okay …’ he says reluctantly. ‘Well, you are odd yourself. The way you speak. But anyway, okay, I believe what you said then.’
But there is nothing to be done, because the matter of hunting down Voldemort and his followers is in the hands of the adults—even if Harry is the
"Eltanin, you can take his majesty on a tour of our gardens, show him how you have been providing for us here," Mother suggests with all the force of a command.
‘Well, you never know,’ Draco said with forced nonchalance. ‘I might have – er – moved onto bigger and better things.’
Didn’t Moony say that nearly all of the Blacks are Death Eaters? This woman is a Death Eater? She doesn’t quite fit Harry’s idea of an evil henchmen—she’s too … clean and neatly dressed. Sirius grimaces, and looks down. At the sight of Harry, he exhales, some of the raw anger in his eyes fading away.
The Black house is tall and narrow, the space carved out between two Muggle buildings; it’s ironic how one of the most prejudiced pureblood families has chosen to lodge themselves deep amongst the Muggles. Black and Lupin have made an effort to scrub away stains of Dark Magic, but Draco still sees in lurking in dusty cabinets chucked into half-habitable rooms.
She shakes her head, and shuts the door with a wave of her wand. ‘Calm down, you prat. You will only upset him further by going after him now.’
It is slow going down the street to their next stop, Ollivander’s, to get Harry’s wand, because Minnie is constantly getting stopped by former students and acquaintances.
Harry does not recall having any proper conversation with Mr. Creevey, when a difference in age of two years proved unbreachable in school, despite their being in the same House. Creevey has an unassuming appearance, with his small stature and mousy brown hair. It takes only a minute of conversation with the man to see the passion and energy that lights up his dark eyes and animates his face. Over cups of aromatic tea and rich chocolate cake, he tells Harry that he is working at the Ministry now, in the Department of Mysteries.
A moment in second year when Harry made a quip—something silly about Voldemort and snakes—and Draco laughed, and looked at him blazingly clear, as if he saw Harry in that moment, in those words, and simply appreciated what he saw. Harry saw himself too, and for the first time in his life, felt certain in his skin.
Bellatrix scowled, lowering her hand. ‘We shouldn’t have let you marry Lucius. Look at the coward he beget!’
His godfathers hold him close. ‘Stupid child,’ Moony says hoarsely. ‘Why didn’t you tell us?’ That he was a Horcrux. That he must die for the war to end. ‘We would have—
‘Got to remove your pants, you berk,’ Draco grunts, undoing Harry’s fly, his hand sliding along the shape of Harry’s cock.
Harry stops in mid-air, looking down. She is the size of his thumb, but he doesn’t need to see her face to know that she is absolutely furious. He swallows, and turns his broom around. It is Minnie’s old broom really: an ancient Cleansweep Four that takes ten minutes to get ten metres off the ground and at a speed no faster than a running boy. He thinks of going as slowly as he can, but the longer Minnie has to stew, the worse his punishment will be.
fault for dragging him along: she thought it was time for him to meet someone his age. It’s unfortunate Pansy Parkinson turns out to be such a dull companion.
‘I’m not afraid,’ Draco replies, kissing the top of Harry’s knuckles. ‘You are born to be a hero, Potter. That is what you are, and heroes always win.’
Draco cannot move, not even his mouth. His blood is cold in his veins, and his lungs are straining with screams that cannot be heard. The man’s hand tightens on Draco, and as he feels the sickening squeeze of Apparition, he hears Pansy scream. When the darkness releases him, he is in a new place. Draco smells the closeness of the dim room and the reek of rotting food.
The white-haired shopkeeper descends the ladder rather rapidly, his grey robes flapping around his pink trousers-clad legs. He jumps the last three steps, landing with a neat hop in front of Harry. His gaze sweeps Harry from head to toe – he feels Ollivander’s eyes on his scar as clearly as he might if the old man has pushed his fringe back to take a good look at it.
Shock and delight made him daring. His erection bouncing off his stomach, Draco reached up and pumped some liquid soap into his hand. He spread his legs wide open and reached down past his balls. His eyes focused in Potter’s direction, keeping one hand moving on his cock, he began rubbing the puckered skin of his arsehole.
He had spent months and months on the ruddy thing and the end was still not in sight. Sleeping or waking, the Cabinet haunted him like a Boggart that could not be vanquished.
Draco had expected Potter to be hopeless in the kitchen like most young adults their age. Besides, he had a house elf. But from the way Potter moved around the room, flicking his wand at a teakettle, it was clear the kitchen was Potter’s domain.
in vogue at the moment, Draco thinks he would rather not be friends with their sort. He tells his parents as much.
‘Good,’ she said, her voice filled with disgust. ‘Dumbledore will hear about this, Malfoy. You will be expelled for this.’
Like the Malfoys, Theo’s inheritance had been seized for war reparations. Unlike the Malfoys, who were independently wealthy and owned properties all over Europe, Theo, whose elderly father died in Azkaban, had little to nothing left.
. He wishes he can close his eyes, but he cannot, because the man has Petrified him, and he has to watch as the man pushes his robes aside, exposing his dirty, ripped pants. Draco is screaming. He is screaming; why does his parents not hear him? Where are they? Don’t they know where he is?
Carefully, he turns Harry over, the fragile body rolling without resistance. The green eyes are still staring sightlessly into the night. Draco holds himself still, concentrating on holding himself together; taking his unanswerable rage and forging it into a sword; beating his terrible grief into submission and forming a shield. He cannot fall—not now. There is still Harry’s mission to fulfil.
Draco manages to walk away without looking back, the touch of Potter’s eyes burning into his back. He slips between crowded tables, dissolving into the soothing chatter. He heads for the loo, locking himself in the last stall and sinking onto the toilet bowl.
Draco knows too, that Black and Lupin the werewolf are godfathers to Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. He opens his eyes, his palms pooling with rivulets of sweat and blood. The dark-haired boy is staring open-mouthed at him in the mirror. His eyes are the startling green of leaves in the springtime. He looks frightened.
‘No, I suppose most people don’t,’ he replies wearily. ‘Sirius told me, before we started school, because I need to be careful in the showers. I thought you would know because you’re alpha and raised in a pureblood family—your parents—’
Late afternoon sunlight comes through the Entrance Hall, shining through the jewels of the four giant hourglasses. The light that falls on the glimmering marble wall behind is multihued, painting the names of the fallen in every shade of the House colours. Harry spots Fred, Tonks, little Colin Creevey, and swallows past the lump of regret and guilt.
Draco kept his fists clenched at his sides. ‘Where do you think this is going to eventually lead, Potter?’
Narcissa and Lucius exchange quick glances; she looks at Alena, who gives them an encouraging smile. Narcissa walks forward, closely shadowed by Lucius. The mother moves the folds of the cloth aside to reveal a sleeping baby boy. Narcissa nearly weeps at the sight of such a perfect baby: his cherubic face, rosebud mouth, and tiny little nose.
He turns to walk away. He must get away, and think of how he could reverse what he has done. Harry grabs his shoulder, demanding: ‘Where are you going –
All at once the darkness lifts, because the pressure has been dragged off his back, and there are hands on his shoulders, pulling him out of the water, thumping his back. He coughs, his lungs on fire and throat filled with thorns. Harry is leaning over him, face dirt-streaked, his breathing heavy and laborious.
, the lights blooming to life when Draco entered. He felt a breeze when Potter rushed in behind him. He gripped his wand in his pocket – Potter was close enough now that his hex would be accurate – and an idea so brilliant he was momentarily blinded by the genius of it sprang into his mind.
They go back to school, despite the spreading fear. The Ministry insists upon it; You-Know-Who is not a threat against their might, ergo the wizarding community would keep calm and carry on. Dumbledore acquiesces, because Hogwarts, with its ancient layers of protection dating back to the Founders, is one of the safest places in the wizarding world.
The Draco of the past six months isn’t the Draco he loved before the Battle of Hogwarts—but no one is whom they were before—especially Harry. He didn’t realise until it was gone: there is a hollow within him, where Voldemort’s evil used to nest. He shouldn’t be feeling so empty, like he has lost a part of himself when it was not his to begin with. The only thing that seems real and unchanging is his bond with Draco.
For there is to be a large party expected. Shortly after Harry and the other gentlemen of the neighbourhood visited Mr. Bingley, the young man was called back to London. Mrs. Bennet’s disconcertion was easily soothed by news that Mr. Bingley would bring with him a large party to Netherfield when he returns, as well as a following report of six ladies and ten gentlemen making up the party. These enthusiastic numbers were soon whittled down to three ladies and four gentlemen. This last communiqué proves accurate when Bingley enters the assembly room with his party at last.
During his week at St Mungo’s, he had noticed quite a number witches and one or two wizards give him a meaningful once-over as he passed. Some of them had approached him with glazed eyes, too blinded by his Veela appeal to realise that he was Draco Malfoy.
His looks and his bond with Harry are the only interesting things about him. He sits up in bed, unable to sleep, as the thoughts prod at him relentlessly. He looks over at Harry, thinking of how he might ask for advice without sounding too much of a pathetic loser. Harry’s bed curtains are drawn, but he hears a whimper.
‘I tried, Master!’ he cried, terrified that he might have disobeyed Sirius. ‘Master Regulus told me to destroy it, and I tried and tried, but nothing worked! Oh, I know I have been disobedient, stupid, stupid house elf. You wanted to throw so many of Master Regulus’s things away, but I had to keep this—it is my duty to destroy it!’ So, they gave Kreacher the basilisk fang, and the elf destroyed the locket, his tiny chest heaving with emotion that he had finally managed to obey his beloved master’s last order.
That great, dark thing locked up in Potter reared up; Potter’s face was fixed in a hideous expression of mingled pain and rage. He raised his wand higher and Draco saw the intent to hurt clear in his eyes. For a moment, Draco was genuinely afraid – afraid of
The air inside the shop is still and tight. Chairs scrape against the floor as Minnie and Moony rise to their feet, white-faced and tensed. Harry takes a step back, dropping the holly wand with a loud clatter. ‘Voldemort’s wand?’
‘Ellad was an Ancient Greek wizard,’ Hermione says, astonished once more about everyone’s ignorance. ‘If this is one of the pieces made by
Potter tumbled off the luggage rack, his Invisibility Cloak slipping off him as he fell. He landed with a resounding crash on the floor at Draco’s feet, his face fixed into an expression of excitement. His eyes spoken eloquently of his dismay.
“An Auror will be guarding you every day,” he said. “It’ll probably be either Harry or me. We don’t have any other open cases at the moment. It’s a good thing you’re not so much of a git these days.”
Draco sniggered, opening his eyes. He stopped short when he saw that Potter was dead serious. ‘Don’t be stupid. You can’t go a day without snogging me,’ he pointed out.
Draco will be fine; so, this is the reason for his being Veela, for carving out an unlikely place in hostile environs that do not like creatures that are different. The stuff about soulmates, he pushes aside. Those are adult concerns.
Bingley, the pretty face to which she referred after the Meryton ball. He sips his wine, watching his sister smiling brighter than he has seen in years. Bingley is perhaps the cosmopolitan sort of man, who might take the revelation of his wife being a witch well.
Potter is watching him with some anxiety. ‘You don’t have to stay. You can go – I’m fine drinking alone.’
‘That’s the idea!’ his best friend crowed. ‘A kid is sure to touch it, right? Will send the entire thing come crashing down, balls all over the place, it’ll be a madhouse!’
Harry stares at his friend, thunderstruck. He has stupidly only been thinking about himself. The prophecy says that he will be the one to kill Voldemort; it makes sense that everything related to Voldemort that comes his way must be made into a weapon—
Red-faced, Potter stumbles to join Granger and Longbottom, glancing apologetically at Draco as he goes. Apologetic? Does he hope for them to be in the same House too? Ah, and like everybody else, Potter expects a Malfoy to be a Slytherin. Draco knows that is what his parents expect as well, all the more because they
‘Dance, I suppose. That is always a safe choice – along with conversation. There is nothing like conversation for parties to discover likeness of mind and compatibility in character. In fact, I would call conversation the very essence of romance. One always requires understanding and compassion for one’s partner, I think, and conversation is the very method to achieve that.’
‘I don’t have to play the game if I don’t want to.’ Draco realised the irony of his words the moment they left his mouth and he had to give a snort of laughter.
Draco’s mother was the one who suggested the visit. ‘We’ve heard so much about you from Draco,’ she told him, despite Draco’s hissed
Draco got out of bed and went into the toilet. He didn’t notice he had stepped on glass until he was in the bath, the soles of his feet stinging in the water. He sat in the tub, watching the water swirl, pink with blood.
The house-elf Kreacher told the story of how the Dark Lord brought him to a cave, where he placed a locket under a terrible curse. He told the same story to Regulus Black, whose morals could not bear the abhorrent idea of a Horcrux and hence, sought to destroy it. He perished in the cave, sending Kreacher away with the real locket. The elf had hidden it in his cubbyhole for the past twenty years.
He twisted around, his body low over the broom. Draco was pressed over him, his arms trembling with the effort of holding him. He closed his eyes, refusing to see the flaming hell baying for his screams and ashes. It could not touch him now: he was with Potter, and he was saved.
The woman laughs, high-pitched and grating. ‘Merlin, is that what we’re paying our Aurors to do? Pretend to be silly little princes’ big alpha protectors! Are you sure they are pretending? Look at the way Potter’s holding him, he must be fucking the ponce.’
‘From Ron and George’s faces, yeah, I reckon so,’ he replies. ‘But do you think Ron would have figured out how he feels about her?’
Tonight would be the first time in months he would be forced to socialise with a large group of his peers. Dumbledore’s Army, he could handle. Most of them were, after all, good friends of his. He had no idea, however, how a Slytherin might react to his presence, especially after the
Minnie wasn’t just very angry; she was incandescent with rage, and she would not allow Harry, Sirius or Moony to speak his name in the house for the next week. Harry had heard Sirius whisper to Moony that he thought it was fine for Dumbledore to hide the fact that he thought You-Know-Who was alive, since he didn’t know for sure, but of course, he mustn’t say so in front of Minnie.
Zabini made cruel remarks about who wore the pants in the relationship until Millie socked him in the jaw last year and snogged Nott fiercely in the middle of the common room. Zabini had always been wary of Millie since.
For a moment, Harry is sure that the blond must know that he is omega, that he is weak and a burden; why else does he seem to loathe Harry? But no, he has been taking the suppression potion, and he has never met this boy before. No one besides his guardians and Snape knows he is omega. Merlin, this is the first time he has seen strangers from the wizarding world.
“Hold on tighter,” he said, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him closer. “Wouldn’t want to lose you on the way there.”
The night at the Burrow was ten months ago. He might be familiar now with touching Harry, holding him like a moonlight pearl that belongs only to him—a unicorn that bows only to him. But it has always been chaste, his touch careful, worshipful; he would scare off the unicorn with vulgar desire. He has never thought of any of his ex-boyfriends with such desperate desire: yearning to possess, wretched in its degree, sharp enough to hurt. It would be destructive, he knew, to give in to it.
“Yeah, all I saw was black robes too,” Potter was frowning. “He had a hood up. From the size of your attacker, I
The Death Eaters were in the castle. Draco was appalled to see Greyback step out of the Cabinet. The werewolf grinned at him and said, ‘Lots of succulent little pieces for me tonight, eh, Malfoy?’
Potter was staring down at Draco’s hands on the worktop, looking distinctly awkward. “What about you and Parkinson? Do you still see each other?”
‘It’s coming along well. We’ve managed to get almost everybody to agree to come. Professor McGonagall wants to make it clear that everyone is welcome back to Hogwarts next year, especially after that article in the
. I never have, Malfoy. I’ve—Merlin, we’ve come this, I didn’t think I could say it: I’ve wanted you for years. I told you, I enjoyed the night we spent together last year—I thought you did too, but you disappeared, you wanker. You didn’t write me back! I’ve sent you so many owls.’
‘Draco,’ Harry says, shaking his head in disbelief. ‘You prat.’ And he reaches out to grab Draco’s arms, closing the distance between them in a single step, and presses his lips against his.
A while later, they lay breathing hard on the now hard floor, the pillows inadvertently shoved away. Their sweaty bodies were pressed close together, legs tangled up, arms thrown around each other. Potter’s head was on Draco’s chest and Draco was gently running his hand through Potter’s hair.
‘Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,’ Zabini said dismissively; Zabini didn’t care for what he called the Gryffindor obnoxious self-righteousness, but he did not share Draco’s antipathy.
Potter was breathing faster, his chest rising and falling rapidly, almost brushing Draco’s. Draco kept his eyes fixed on Potter’s face, tracing at random Potter’s features: strong jawline, broad cheekbones, soft lips shining wet in anticipation. His breath hitched in his throat, his desire coiling deep in his belly, warm and certain.
McGonagall pauses, studying Draco keenly. She looks up at the Headmaster, as does Draco. The old man is sitting in the middle, the wizard who visited Malfoy Manor a year ago and agreed that they should take Draco in for school. He gazes at Draco, his expression cryptic. Draco meets his gaze, pleading desperately with his eyes, even if he doesn’t understand why. After a beat, the Headmaster gives McGonagall an imperceptible nod. With a shrug, McGonagall calls the next name, and Draco steps aside.
‘Leave it,’ Ron says harshly, already turning away. ‘If Harry is dead, Draco is useless without him. He won’t help us. We must go back and warn the rest—McGonagall is waiting for a report. Voldemort might already be there!’
‘When this is over, I’m going to do something about our relations with them,’ Hermione said grimly. ‘It’s ghastly how the Ministry goes about it.’
Draco shrugged, his left arm aching. ‘Mother thinks it’s important for me to finish my education and I agree, but well … in the end, it might even matter how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s we get. There are … other things we must do.’
He does not look away from Draco’s sardonic smirk, or his piercing eyes. What is there to hide? Whether Draco is really here to fix his wand or not, he is at the very least here to hold Harry accountable. He sighs, shoving his too-long fringe back from his face.
Draco braces himself on one elbow, head hovering above Harry’s, watching entranced, as Harry moans, head thrust back into the pillow, the long column of his neck utterly exposed. Draco pushes a finger into Harry, groaning at how
In the sleepy silence, Draco heard them – careful footsteps behind them. He stiffened, looking at Zabini out of the corner of his eye. Frowning, deep in thought, his friend didn’t seem to notice anything. Draco gritted his teeth, fisting his hands in his pockets.
‘Harry knows his food, Headmistress,’ Luna piped up. ‘That’s why I asked him. He will work very well with the house elves, I think. His Kreacher can help lead them.’
‘That’s not what I’m trying to do,’ Harry blurts, leaning forward. ‘I don’t – I don’t want to break it off with you.’
The end comes faster than they expect. Minnie’s voice comes booming through the Floo, reaching every corner of the manor: ‘He has come to Hogwarts.’
‘Shall we have dinner?’ Minnie asks gently, pulling away a little. ‘I’m making your favourite pudding.’
“We needed an ingredient that strongly defined who you are, but your body was too contaminated at that point, and it would be too late to reach your parents in France. Mr Potter remembered that you had Veela blood, so we used Veela hair successfully to create your new body. The result is that you are now more Veela than wizard.”
But the strongest argument for going back—also one used by many parents who are sending their children to school in these times—is that Dumbledore is at Hogwarts. ‘Safest place in the kingdom,’ Sirius says stoutly. ‘Voldemort daren’t attack while Dumbledore is there.’ Hence, the school year marches on.
Harry sits down hard on the cold stone floor, the sound of crumpling paper causing him to look down. His homework is balled up in his fist, ripped and singed in places. He stares at it blankly. Something hard and jagged is lodged in his chest, and he can’t breathe. Every gasp he sucks in tastes of ash and salt. In the silence, he can hear the rapid drumming of his heart and Moony’s murmurs echoing through the house.
.’ She grinned at Harry before swooping off to snatch a dance with a rather famous, sleekly handsome Quidditch player.
Draco had made a comment about the bags under Harry’s eyes—he has been having trouble sleeping—and Harry lost his temper, which he sorely regrets now, because he knows it is hardly Draco’s fault.
‘Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste,’ he said, pulling the attention away from her. ‘Maybe he’s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favourite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t heard I’m on the train, or –’
The crazy bitch meant to humiliate Malfoy, to reduce him to his base instincts and make him prisoner to his innate urges. Harry is glad he caught the spell in time, even if he now has to suffer through a false heat, waking up at four A.M. in the morning for another cold shower. The Healers are puzzled that Harry, an alpha, should be so affected; alpha physiology is so different from omegas.
Harry wishes he could have seen Dumbledore’s face, but it is Dumbledore’s memory, and he only saw through the professor’s eyes. How does a man look when he realises he has been training a soldier to be cannon fodder, Harry wonders. The futility of everything! Is that why Dumbledore realised he must involve others in the search for the Horcruxes? So that when Harry dies, someone else can destroy the rest?
In response, Draco took the head into his mouth again and began bobbing his head up and down, taking in as much as cock as he could. Potter was cursing again, a hand tangled in Draco’s hair. Draco was watching his face so he knew when Potter was about to come. Potter’s face fell apart, his mouth opening, and there was an expression of exquisite pleasure on his face as his hips thrust, his cock hit the back of Draco’s throat, and he was choking on Potter’s come. He did his best to swallow, but ended up spitting most of it as Potter’s spent cock slipped out of his mouth.
‘Oh! Yes, I have heard from numerous sources that the Bennet ladies are the most accomplished in Hertfordshire,’ Bingley says. ‘It is indeed very rare to find a person with both beauty and aptitude to recommend them.’
‘—I love you. I—I think I’ve not said it yet,’ he blurts, a blush heating his cheeks; despite the circumstances, it is still a humiliating act to bear his naked emotions.
Draco felt a flash of irritation; he could feel stares boring into his back. He yanked himself free from Filch’s grasp and snapped, ‘All right, I wasn’t invited. I was trying to gatecrash, happy?’
Very soon, the entire common room from first years to seventh years are crowded around their corner, peering at the magical map, excited about its potential. Draco sees from the glint in Hermione’s eyes that she has an idea. When Harry muses aloud, ‘But what can we do with this?’, she grabs his arm and declares: ‘We’ll use it to defend the castle.’
But he is frozen in place, held fast by his own desperate fear, because greater than Harry’s empathy is his streak of heroism. Voldemort didn’t issue the threat thinking the people here—everyone who has chosen to come fight—would give Harry up; he did it knowing that it would plunge Harry into deepest guilt.
one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis.’ Granger gasped and Slughorn turned to her expectantly. ‘I take it that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?’
‘And if we should speak of manners, why, Darcy has been most polite in all our interactions with him after the ball. Perhaps he has come to regret his earlier insolence, and wishes to make amends,’ says Harry.
‘Oh, sorry, did I embarrass you?’ Black asks cheerfully, unrepentant. ‘Hullo, Draco, welcome to the ancestral home of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. We’ve lost our country seat to the Muggles eons ago, of course, so this dirty townhouse is all the Blacks have left. Your mother visited once or twice as a child—did she mention that? Oh, is that from her? Thanks, it looks very nice.’
Sirius’s clothes – his usual Muggle attire of T-shirt and jeans – are ripped in places, the tears revealing raw, bloodied skin. His long hair is matted and dark with blood, redness dripping down his swollen face. His right leg is bent at an unnatural angle, and there is a whole scoop of flesh in his right arm that is gone, revealing grey-red gristle and shining, white bone. Sirius’s dark eyes – usually lively with laughter and gaiety – land on Harry; Harry sees that his right eye has been hurt, redness spreading all over the white of his eyeball.
Ron and Hermione try to hold him back, but Neville reaches through Draco’s arms, and grabs Harry. Draco roars, and with a swipe of his arm, sends his friend flying through the air; he has enough presence of mind to hold back his strength. Neville lands in a pile of dead vampires, and scrambles backwards with a shriek. The others hurry to his side.
‘Just trying to make up to well-connected people,’ Zabini said, still eyeing Crabbe with disdain. ‘Not that he managed to find many.’
He winced. Potter had managed to land a few hard blows. He probed his left side warily, wondering if going down to Pomfrey was worth the effort. Perhaps tomorrow: all he wanted right now was to curl up in bed.
Eventually, the Hat slides over his head, blocking out the intrusive stares of the other students. He heard the swell of chatter, until the Hat speaks and drowns everything else out.
He works in a second finger, thrusting them in and out, twisting a little as he goes. The air is filled with the lewd sucking sounds of Harry taking his fingers.
Crabbe and Goyle were confused by Pansy and Zabini’s coldness towards Draco, even if Crabbe revelled in it. Draco ignored it, ignored them, and continued working on the Cabinet as he pushed the pieces of his other plan into place.
Draco didn’t want to answer any questions, not when he had the Boy Who Lived right where he wanted him, so he pulled him in for another kiss and Potter didn’t resist.
Confused, but gratified, Harry agrees to take the egg to the Prefects’ bathroom to listen to its unearthly caterwauling in the bath. Cedric claps him on the back with a good-natured grin, says he would see him at the Yule Ball on Sunday, and strides back down the corridor. Harry is trying to decide whether going this way would make it seem like he’s avoiding Draco, when his wand flares in warning. He turns to see Draco walking up to him, the Beauxbatons students nowhere in sight.
Harry found Bingley to be indeed a handsome young man, with the most agreeable, pleasing manners. He was natural and unaffected in his delight with the countryside, and expressed excitement about the activities he anticipated partaking here.
The fireplace blazes, the flames vividly green, and Dumbledore steps through, followed by a stout witch carrying a large doctor’s bag. After a brief scan of the empty kitchen, Dumbledore nods at the stairs, saying tersely to the witch: ‘They’re upstairs.’ She disappears without a word, sparing Harry a curious glance.
Perhaps that is what was so sickening to Harry about Malfoy fleeing the castle during the seige. The Slytherin had refused to listen to Harry’s exhortation to stay, and dismissed Harry’s argument that it would be far safer in Hogwarts than for him to throw his lot with the Knights on the basis that he is a Malfoy.
It was late at night or early in the morning and they were in Draco’s favourite room, the small storeroom near the kitchens. The walls were made of warm yellow stone and the dim lighting created a sense of intimacy. It was filled with old flat pillows and cushions the house-elves were going to re-stuff, which Draco had arranged on the floor to make quite a comfortable bed.
Draco knew his interest was obvious because Weasley grinned triumphantly. Draco coughed, and returned to his book. He was currently trying to study the uses of aspen wood. Ollivander had hinted that he might take Draco on his next wood-harvesting trip, which Draco would have been more excited about if he wasn’t so
The door swings open. ‘Who did you say will behave?’ Sirius Black asks, fixing Harry with a mock stern expression.
‘Don’t you try to make yourself out to be the victim,’ he snarled, spittle flying from his lips, his glasses sliding down his nose. ‘You
The terrible voice echoes across the grounds, chilling in the emotionless way it pronounces its threats: ‘Give me Harry Potter, and I will spare your life when we conquer. Hogwarts is ours. It is only a matter of time. You will fall. There is no need to make foolish sacrifices—so many of you are already dead. Give me Harry Potter. You have one hour.’
you. I’ve missed you every day for the last six months, and I think about you everyday. Don’t you fucking dare say I don’t like you enough!’
Draco hardly is. When he isn’t with Harry, he is with any of the others, and if his closer friends aren’t around, he is with any other Gryffindor. There is always someone in the common room good for a game of Exploding Snap or a laugh over the
is the master of our household, and I am her humble servant. I suspect you suffer a little of that, Bennet? Well, she has little use for me in the off-season – so I take myself here to impose on the generosity of that delightful Bingley, and to partake in the intrigues and romances Hertfordshire offers.’
prejudiced. It was true, it was all true that Slytherins were liars and cowards and the worst sort of people, it was
The night air gusted around them, stealing under Draco’s robes. He shivered and lifted his hand a little higher. He would have to finish this soon.
Remus’s head turns, and Harry doesn’t need to be there to know the wordless conversation his godfathers are having. Sirius replaces Remus at the fire, face twisted with anxiety—and fear.
‘It’s over,’ Zabini said, burying his face in his hands. ‘They exposed Draco, claimed that he faked his own death to wriggle his way back to you – they had a few photos of you lot in the pub. Fuck, those
‘Thank you,’ Luc said, happily picking up a biscuit off the plate Goyle was handing around. He caught Harry’s eye and smirked.
Ron and Neville are nodding, the latter holding up his toad, which Draco had found in someone’s hat. The Headmaster is now making a few remarks, but people are still chattering about Draco Malfoy’s stunning Sorting.
When he sees that Harry still doesn’t get it, he frowns, puzzled. ‘It’s because people are inherently attracted to alphas … do you mean you don’t feel it, Potter?’
Noise: the low hum of voices and horses whickering, the shuffle of heavy boots and clinking of weapons. Eltanin rounds the corner to behold the central courtyard alive with firelight—and occupied by Gryffindors, barking orders.
pointless, but necessary; after all, doesn’t he like the person he is today better than the boy he was five years ago?
‘No, just me today,’ Harry said, surreptitiously rubbing his shoulder, as they trooped up the steps and into the brightly lit castle. ‘Luna’s got me agreeing to be on the planning committee for the Christmas Ball.’
“Berk,” Weasley rolled his eyes. “Have you managed to find out what the second ingredient in your rudimentary body potion is yet? The bit that supposed to anchor your soul to this world?”
But of course, Potter was having none of that. If anything, Mother’s words further stoked his ire. He stepped forward, a sneer on his face.
‘He always spoke very highly of you, sir,’ Draco said; a bald-faced lie, because Abraxas Malfoy was deep in the throes of dottiness by the time Draco was born.
‘I thought he had died in a duel with an Auror,’ Sirius said in a wounded manner, as if hurt to find out his much-despised sibling died to injure the evil he claimed to serve.
The furious hammering on the door caused them to jolt apart. ‘What in the name of Helga Hufflepuff have the two of you done?’ Filch was screaming through the door. ‘Open this door immediately! Potter! Malfoy! You two no-good troublemakers! You wait, you just
He walks through the crowded rooms, ostensibly to watch for Lydia, who has flitted into the crowd with Kitty in tow and a determination to find handsome officers to dance with. Harry could have spent his night observing the card tables or exploring the fine rooms, with a glass of port in hand, but his friends are quick to draw him into the dances.
“But love is a choice,” Draco protested futilely. “People choose to walk away from relationships all the time!”
He knew fixing the Cabinet was going to be difficult, but he had completely underestimated the task. Borgin needed him to find out not only the physical specifications of the Cabinet, but also the individual spells that made up the Cabinet. You would think finding out the measurements was the easy part; not quite so when the Cabinet existed in seven dimensions.
Madam Pomfrey was expectedly horrified because there was so much blood and spoke of sending Draco to St Mungo’s immediately. Thank Merlin, Snape managed to convince her Draco’s wounds were healed, but he needed dittany and blood replenishment potions. The nurse bustled away to gather the potions.
Malfoy appears innocent of any dastardly behaviour, standing as he is with the dark-haired man, Darcy. Parkinson and Zabini, and the Bingley relations are engaged in dancing. Lizzy passes the pair of Malfoy and Darcy as she crosses the room, and abruptly turns her head to look at them. Harry watches with interest as Darcy turns away coldly, murmuring to Malfoy, who acknowledges Lizzy with a slight nod. Lizzy must have overheard Darcy, because she is all laughter when she reaches Harry and their friends.
Later, when the others are asleep, Draco whispers that when the war ends, he will put Harry’s name into the family register and give him the ring. Harry makes a noncommittal noise, ignoring the warmth lingering on his skin at Draco’s touch.
But he didn’t come back after two days, a week, two weeks, months. Lucius was laid to rest in the Malfoy crypt without his son. Time went inexorably on, as Harry watched the moon march across the sky on sleepless nights.
‘What I’m trying to say is that I like the person that you are – now and then, so whether you are Draco or Malfoy, I didn’t think it makes a difference, because it doesn’t to me. Because I’d still like you anyway. Anyway, I just didn’t want to call you Draco because … it feels sort of presumptuous, you know? I don’t know if you think we are even close enough friends for that.’
She flings out her wand faster than Harry expects, and Harry twists, shoving Malfoy to the ground. The curse hits him in his chest like a Bludger, with a blinding flash that whites out everything else. He is thrown backwards. He hears his breath escape him in a huff of pain, and his heartbeat thudding heavily. A single thought crystallises, sharp with his relief:
Not sure what that will do for your shoes. They’re pretty much ruined. You are not exactly dressed for a walk in the forest.’
‘You are only saying this now because my side won and yours lost,’ Harry said coldly. ‘How very Slytherin of you, hurrying to prove that you’re all right, that you’re one of
Draco opens his mouth, but there is nothing to be said. What can he say in the face of such a bald confession? He shakes his head, shrugging off Harry’s hand. ‘I’m a Veela, Harry. Let me show you what that means.’
He had never thought much of Dumbledore. His father had disdained of Dumbledore because he was a Muggle-lover, but Draco thought there was something pharisaical about the Headmaster. He was too old, wrapped up in the confidence of his so-called wisdom, sure that his way was the only way. Everybody else was chess pieces.
He doesn’t mean to sound so plaintive, almost accusing. Harry has told him before that it’s enough that they are friends, that he doesn’t
,’ Pansy mutters, screwing her face up in distaste. ‘He’s just a temporary gardener. I don’t like him. Let’s walk faster.’
Harry looked up to see Gregory Goyle standing in the doorway opposite, holding a rather dirty teapot in one hand and a chocolate muffin in the other. When Goyle realised who he was, he turned ashen under his scraggly beard and dropped the teapot and muffin, whirling around. The pot smashed, sending china shards and steaming tea flying in all directions.
He shakes his head, hands clasped over his nose and mouth, rapidly blinking away the tears. His parents are crouched over him, holding their wands up uselessly; what charm can they use when they do not know what befell him? He shakes his head more vigorously, sitting up. They lean back, exchanging anxious looks.
‘Well, I am going to prove all of you wrong, do you see? Father has been training me for kingship since I was
The door flew open immediately, as if the person had been waiting just on the other side of the door. Harry Potter beamed at him, looking too bloody fit, emerald eyes shining on a strong, handsome face.
A soldier is standing beside his horse, in the midst of unloading a saddle bag. He is still, staring straight at Eltanin, green eyes bright in the darkness. There is a lightning-bolt scar white against the man's dark skin, splitting his forehead, creasing his cheek, lifting his upper lip into a permanent sneer.
The wizards Apparate to a safe distance from the Netherfield estate, and walk the rest of the way. It is often tricky when it comes to visiting estates that are not within a reasonable walking distance. Wizards rarely own carriages, for it hardly makes economic sense to maintain a carriage when one could simply Apparate or fly. Hence, the excuse that the carriage is required elsewhere and will return to pick them up after the party is frequently employed.
A few times Harry wakes up, breathless with impotent rage; because in his dreams, it is the green of the Killing Curse that strikes Draco, and Harry is too far away or too slow to stop it—like Cedric Diggory’s death. He cannot fall asleep after that, so he gets up to potter around his burgeoning Potions laboratory, or to re-read the letters Draco sent.
Potter was a sloppy kisser. Draco had kissed boys who used their tongue with finesse, who knew how to tease and entice. Potter dove in with no regards for delaying pleasure. He used too much spit and held Draco too tightly. But he was Harry Potter, and on the stint that Draco was kissing the boy he had dreaming of since he was eleven, he had never been more aroused.
He wrapped his arms, his wings around Harry, blocking out everything, so that all Harry could see was Draco; all he could smell was feathers and steel; all he could feel was the keen, familiar awareness of Draco beating in his chest. The emptiness within him, scraped raw and hollow when Draco left, had eased, and he remembered how to breathe again.
Harry opens his eyes, green eyes gleaming in the dark, and opens his legs, welcomes Draco between them. He grins wildly, also a creature reduced to simple, pure desire, and wraps his hand around the base of Draco’s cock. ‘Faster,’ he breathes, canting his hips upwards, pulling Draco towards him—and Draco is sinking into tight, wet heat, the scent of warm caramel everywhere around him.
Vulgar as Lizzy’s words are, they are true in their assessment of the relative freedom witches enjoy over Muggle women in society. It amuses Lizzy exceedingly to observe the awkwardness with which Muggles regard sexual desire of any sort: from the manner in which ladies blush at the very mention of wedding beds, to the awkward adjustments gentleman must make to their breeches after a particularly close dance. She commented wryly once that it is little wonder so many wedding nights are considered disappointments, when the Muggles put the very act up on a pedestal that cannot be reached.
Draco blinked. Harry had somehow appeared in the doorway, and Theo was rearing up, pointing a wand at Harry and snarling the beginning of a spell.
‘Why did you do it, Draco? Nothing will ever come out of it. His side will win or our side will win. Either way, there won’t ever be a world where the two of you can be together. And he will hate you now, knowing what you did to him. He won’t be able to trust you again. You have to forget him.’
, her face puckered in utter disgust. Minnie had explained that there are three genders in the world: alpha, beta and omega. While the majority of living creatures is beta, ten per cent of people are alpha, and an even smaller proportion – five per cent – is omega.
The elderly wizard is in his office at Hogwarts. He is at first surprised, then alarmed by Harry’s incoherent, panicked shouting for him to
‘So, we must destroy these objects?’ Hermione asked. ‘How many are there? How many times can he split his soul?’
He looks up from where he is kneeling in the mud. Potter has not moved from the side of the cauldron. His anger has faded into confusion.
Pansy and Goyle were now laughing at the utterly flabbergasted look on Draco’s face. Zabini rolled his eyes.
Stubborn as Lizzy may be, she is not without good sense. She now looks upon Wickham with a more critical lens, and apparently finds him lacking. In their following encounters with officers of the militia, she proves to be cold and polite. She brooks no further discussion of Mr. Darcy with Wickham. Thus dissuaded, Wickham turns his attention to easier conquests with no qualms.
smell Draco? Potter’s eyes dart to Draco, their eyes meeting. The other boy’s scent floods Draco’s nostrils, and he cannot breathe, seized by the realisation that Harry Potter is omega.
Zabini is hiding something; that is the only thing Draco can deduce after two weeks. The placid face feels like a façade. There is nothing wrong with wanting to pretend to be somebody else, but if he
, memorising the plants in the textbook Minnie and he are working through, but worth it when Minnie and his godfathers are so pleased with him—even if Sirius teases him for being the most bookish eight-year-old in Britain.
His hand goes automatically to his hilt, but he is naked beneath his robes and his blonde hair flows unbound around his face: like a child roused from bed by his mother.
‘He was offering to help me kill Dumbledore,’ Draco said. ‘You know, he has been spying for the Dark Lord since the beginning.’
Draco withdraws into the shadows, his trembling hand reaching behind. His fingertips touch blood, hot and slick, and, clutching the edge of a feather between his first finger and thumb, he pulls the feather out from beneath his skin. He gasps, collapsing against the wall.
He glanced at Lucius from the corner of his eye. His father wasn’t even looking at him. Lucius was looking at his master, his fear naked beneath the weeping cuts and pus-filled lumps. His side profile was hard and sharp as ever, the same view Draco had grown up with.
“Why do you keep doing that?” Potter threw his hands up. “The moment I think we can have a decent conversation, you revert back to nastiness and I want to throttle you.”
Kitty and Lydia enjoy themselves immensely, there being no shortage of young people, wizard and Muggle, to dance with. Lydia is daring enough to accept a dance from Zabini, who, under the watchful eye of her older siblings, conducts himself with almost painful correctness. The youngest Bennet declares him dull. Lizzy, surrounded by friends to laugh with, is perfectly willing to ignore Darcy’s discourtesy, and Harry dances with his sisters and friends, resolving not to look at Malfoy for the rest of the ball.
The smile Harry gave him nudged him deep in his chest, dislodging something cold and dark with jagged edges and replacing it with feather-light kindness and summer warmth.
‘Mr Harry Potter,’ he pronounces. ‘Ahh … I remember when your parents first came in here for their wands. Eleven inches, mahogany, deer heartstring core for your father – a loyal, steadfast wand. And your mother’s was ten and a quarter inches, willow, unicorn hair – a powerful wand, very good for delicate charm and potion work, which I heard were her special skills. I wonder … what wand will choose you?’
is the true form of our enemy’s warrior. Do your people know, Harry? How you are good for nothing but to spread your legs for our dear Draco, like an animal?’
‘Mother told me you returned my wand in the week after the Battle of Hogwarts ended,’ Draco says, his voice even. ‘I must have already been in the holding cells at the Ministry. She kept it in a safe all these years, but … it doesn’t work for me anymore. I can’t even get it to send out sparks.’
‘No, not like that,’ the other boy says impatiently. ‘Like I’ve said, Veelas have stronger senses, and I can smell things you humans cannot pick up. And you … you have a very strong smell. I didn’t understand what it was back then, so I … lost my composure for a bit.’
, a bloody friend? Has he ever taken their bond seriously—or has it always been a connection he could throw off with a shrug?
He has barely presence of mind to wrench himself away, falling against the other wall, bringing his hands to his face. He groans in dismay. He cannot do this. Not again. It is far worse now than last year. Last year he didn’t know Malfoy has a mate. Last year he didn’t keep a tin of Malfoy’s favourite tea at home, because the prince came over that often. Last year he hasn’t heard Malfoy screaming his name in despair,
Harry stood in the quiet street, his mind working furiously. He could hear his heart thundering in his ears, and feel his blood rush, hot and quick. The tea and biscuit he had consumed roiled queasily in his stomach and he clapped a hand over his mouth to stop it from coming up.
Potter shot him a quizzical look and shook his head. ‘You’re not being fair. I’m playing by your ruddy rules, Malfoy. It’s not like you’re giving it away for nothing. You get to ask me anything too. Don’t you have things you want to ask?’
Theo spoke without heat, but there was intensity behind his words that told Draco his friend meant every word. Draco had not known Theo had felt so strongly about the pall of being Slytherin.
‘Not him, he’s a prat!’ Pansy exclaimed; Draco vaguely remembered her saying Astoria Greengrass dated Belby before.
Everyone looks at her in horror; only Dumbledore nods. He has come to the same conclusion. It’s wretched to think that Voldemort could tear his soul into seven pieces, but at least, they now have a list of probable Horcruxes. One has already been destroyed, and they know how: Tom Riddle’s journal, by the basilisk fang. They have since gathered a cache of basilisk fangs from the Chamber for future use.
He has tried; Merlin knows that he has tried again and again. Going to France for his Potions Master and living away from everything he knew for two years. Meeting new, interesting, good-looking people and growing his social circle beyond Draco, Ron, Hermione and Neville. Hitting the Muggle gay clubs with Dean and Seamus and finding fit blokes to dance with. Nothing worked. Nothing would, because it is always Draco he goes home to at the end of the night. But Harry cannot reveal anything of what he wants to Draco, because Draco must never find out that he is omega.
There was something intimately familiar about the way Luc had spoken. It was more than his accent, which was posher and more clipped than before. It was his mannerism, the way he gesticulated and screwed up his face with emotion. A feeling akin to reminiscent itched beneath Harry’s skin. What was this feeling?
‘It will be difficult, Harry,’ his godfather said, wiping the tears from Harry’s cheeks with his thumbs, his voice quiet and soothing. ‘But I know that you are strong enough to get through this, and the day will come when Voldemort is gone, and you will be free to live the way you are meant to.’
‘Snape? Why Snape? He doesn’t care! He wants to see Sirius dead—he must be the one who told Voldemort! Don’t you see?’ Harry’s voice has taken on a genuine tone of despair that wrenches at Draco’s heart.
him. He wanted to eat with Harry and to make fun of his poor manners, even if he knew now it was a result of his wretched childhood. He wanted to read the papers with Harry, and to discuss the more interesting articles. He wanted to reach over, casually touch Harry’s shoulder to ask him if he wanted some tea simply to have an excuse to touch him.
do anything! You are as superficial as Robert, Liam or Adam—didn’t you say you went out with them because you fancied their looks? Don’t claim to be better than your exes.’
He would have to ask Luna about him. As a pureblood, she doubtlessly had a widespread network of extended family. It should be enough that she claimed him as a cousin, and yet … there was
Pansy and Zabini were dangerous, you see, because they were stubborn and smart and creative. They were unlike Crabbe, who detested Draco after Mr Crabbe was jailed as a result of Lucius Malfoy’s failure, and Goyle, who cared but lacked the initiative to take action.
Darkness is closing around him, with only a thin thread of consciousness: Harry is still in pain. Draco scrabbles weakly against the stone beneath him, claws catching on grooves. He cannot die like this.
‘Thought you might, being an alpha,’ she continues and shakes her head in dismay. ‘Oh, sweet Helga, I do hate it when I have to break it to the parents. I
’, was the last thing he heard before he obeyed Snape’s command and spun into the inexorable darkness of Disapparition.
It was an assault that began as the whiff of an aroma like decadent chocolate cake baking in the oven, orange blossom trees, and storm winds rippling across the downs. It made Draco think of home. His chest was tight, and he could hear his pulse thrumming in his ears. He looked up in the mirror to see the people his parents were talking to, and there he was.
Harry sits at the dinner table with Minnie, Sirius, Moony and Dumbledore, laughing at the silly stories Sirius tells about his job as a bartender in a Muggle pub. A pile of presents sits next to him, waiting to be opened. The kitchen is warm and smells of the cake Minnie baked for his birthday. There is a light, warm and soft, deep in Harry’s chest; this—
Draco shrugged, not liking where this was going. ‘Buggering, hopefully.’ He reached out for Potter, but the other boy caught his hand – his left hand – and held it.
At the end of the meeting, Luc was even quicker than Harry to flee the room. Harry stared after him, watching the petite figure draped in an oversized beige cardigan disappear into the Entrance Hall. He turned to Luna, frowning. ‘He’s not your cousin, is he?’
As Potter led him up to the second floor, the silence between them crackled with antagonism. It was like a purple-black thunderhead looming in the distance. Draco wanted so badly to reach out for Potter’s hand and beg for forgiveness, that his desire was a physical ache in his chest.
Sirius shrugs. ‘I reckon I would still have gone for Moony even if we aren’t soulmates, or if I’m alpha. We all know about the soulmate thing from a very young age, especially alphas and omegas—well, except you, Harry, since you were raised by Muggles—but I didn’t think I had it. Dear Moony here didn’t
Draco wasn’t aware he had transformed until he was already leaping at Theo, bird claws slashing downwards. There were black scaly wings all around them. Theo’s eyes were wide with terror, his face white and thin. Draco thrust his head forwards, and his bird’s beak pierced Theo’s chest.
The sound of his name broke the dam in Draco and he found himself awash with shame and frustration and hot, naked anger.
Draco nods, swallowing his mouthful of food. ‘They’ve also told me the Veela ones. There are higher rates of soulmates amongst Veelas, considering—what we are.’ He doesn’t say that his parents have told him Veela alphas almost always have soulmates.
Draco nodded. When he had first known he would be going to school with Harry Potter and that he was the interesting-looking skinny boy from Madam Malkin’s, he had found out everything he could about the boy. Nothing much was known about his early childhood beyond him being raised by Muggles, something Draco had once regarded as indicative of the boy’s poor decision in rejecting Draco’s friendship.
Like how he has done during the worst of it in the dungeons when his bones hurt too much for him to sleep, he begins cataloguing the pains of his body.
She began to make introductions around the table. Harry smiled and nodded and did his best to remember names. Most of them were from sixth and fifth years in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. There was a couple from Gryffindor Harry had vaguely seen around the common room; they grinned at him excitedly. There were a number of older students too, alumni who had come back to help. The older man on Luna’s right turned out to be one such volunteer: Luc, who was in seventh year when Harry was in fifth.
Draco turned back and caught sight of Potter pelting towards them. Merlin, Potter was a wretched sight: his face white as bone, his lips stretched into an unholy grimace. He looked as if someone had smashed a hole in his chest. Draco felt something wrench within him. Potter didn’t know that Dumbledore was dead.
The furniture was as Draco had expected: worn, cushy, and mismatching. The room to the left, which Potter called the living room, wasn’t messy, but had a lived-in look with newspapers, tissue boxes, and crisp packets strewn about. The drapes were drawn back, revealing an ordinary overcast day, which meant Potter had spelled the room to look cheerily sunlit.
He is struggling more with the suppressant potion he must take every month: a black, viscous liquid that tastes of oil and milk. He has to choke it down, eyes watering, under the eyes of Professor Severus Snape, the greasy-haired man who teaches Potions at Hogwarts. Harry didn’t think he could dislike someone as much as the Dursleys, but Snape comes close. The man has the nerve to speak to Minnie with such derision about the desperate state of Gryffindor House, which she used to be Head of before she left Hogwarts to take care of Harry.
you,” Draco snarled, launching himself at his erstwhile friend, curling his hands around that thin, spindly neck.
going out; and there is no way he is with Harry Potter, since they are merely best mates and nothing more.
‘It’s fine,’ he told them. ‘This means I’ve become better at pretending, doesn’t it?’ That only made his godfathers look more worried and Moony more ashamed, so he swallowed his glee, and hugged his relief to himself. This means that he could do it, he could play the part of a normal beta at school.
she tells herself fiercely. The bundle squirms, the brown cloth shifts, and a baby’s plump fist appears from amongst the folds. Narcissa’s heart jumps, and just like that, the Veelas’ spell snaps, and she feels that she can breathe again without choking on lust. Lucius exhales, a gloatingly triumphant grin spreading across his face.
that he enjoyed his time with Malfoy. He will admit that even during their schoolyard rivalry, there is something else in their powerful hatred of each other – from Malfoy’s aggressive desire to provoke Harry’s anger and hence, ensnare his attention, to Harry’s turbulent impulse to overwhelm, to compel, to bend Malfoy to his bidding.
The conversation was neatly turned away from Draco and he relaxed. It was true that being a Prefect was more trouble than it was worth. It was also true that being in Weasley and Granger’s presence made him sick. Thinking about being with the other Prefects, listening to them discuss ways to keep Hogwarts and its students safe, made the Mark on his forearm burn unbearably.
“And … and he mentioned that quite a number of pureblood families have non-wizard ancestors, which strengthened the magic in the blood actually. He said it was kind of a joke how ‘families like the Malfoys would trumpet blood purity when they had Veela blood in their veins.’”
“All right then!” Weasley’s eyes twinkled with good cheer and the certainty of a man having sex tonight. “I’ll floo ‘Mione then!”
Narcissa, exhausted by the journey, sinks to her knees on the edge of the grove. Lucius drops to the ground next to her. His pale face is pinched with similar fatigue and anxiety. They cannot Apparate or fly; the Fae would not allow them so easy a journey for the bequeath they are seeking here.
‘No, I’m not! You’re in trouble now! The Headmaster said no night-time prowling without permission, he said,’ Filch was aglow with triumph; any pity Draco might have felt earlier had vanished.
Harry gave a strangled laugh. “Draco, I had always been attracted to you, even when you were a right little git in school.”
‘All right,’ Snape said and as he passed, he patted Draco on the shoulder. He looked rather discomfited and disappeared swiftly out the door.
Potter nodded, pillowing his head on his folded arm. It took Draco’s breath away, the trust Potter was showing him. Harry Potter trusted
‘Oh, right, wizards would get around on brooms or Apparate. They wouldn’t need to domesticate animals for travel …’
, Harry thinks. Nothing changes the fact that he is friends with Draco Malfoy. But he still has to ask: ‘Was that why you seemed to hate me at the start? Because I’m omega. At Madam Malkin’s, you looked like you wanted to knock me off my broom.’
Malfoy lights up, as he tells him about the heavenly apple cake the Manor house-elves baked for special teas whenever his parents had guests over. He wasn’t allowed to join them, so he would beg the house-elves to save him a small slice, and he would eat it in the small kitchen garden with his hands, licking the powdered sugar from his fingers. Harry smirks, remembering the brat from their first year at Hogwarts.
‘They died protecting you, Harry,’ Dumbledore said sombrely, his eyes keen on Harry’s face. ‘Voldemort wanted to kill you.’
Harry walks up to the Malfoys, and sticks his hand into Draco Malfoy’s startled face. ‘Hullo, we met at Madam Malkin’s. We’re going to be in the same year, so I thought I might introduce myself properly.
‘You know …’ Neville is shuffling the cards idly, looking down at the messy table. ‘You need to remember that whatever you do to yourself, you are doing it to Draco too. Yeah, what you do affects the rest of us, because we’re your friends and we care about you. But it’s different with Draco, isn’t it?’
‘Oh, shut up, Harry,’ Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘It doesn’t matter. The point is that you’ll be having dinner with him on Friday, and you can finally stop stalking him through that silly map.’
He ignored the knowing looks his friends shot him. Zabini was frowning and Parkinson had to drag him away. For some reason, he was very protective over Luc.
Theo thrashed, kicking Draco soundly in the stomach. It was too close to the epicentre of Draco’s torture. He screamed once more when he was thrown backwards. He landed on the floor, dragging the armchair down with him.
The Great Hall is buzzing with chatter; nearly the entire Slytherin table is goggling at him. Potter looks at him quizzically, but Draco simply shakes his head. The group of first-years slowly whittles down, and finally, it is Potter’s turn. The Hat takes longer than anybody else – longer than Granger or Longbottom – long enough for McGonagall to frown a little. Until, finally, the Hat announces, ‘
Malfoy scrambles to his side, face starkly pale, as the woman screeches in dismay. Harry clings to the pain and to consciousness; he still needs to get Malfoy out. The woman is striding towards them. He grabs Malfoy’s hand, and nearly drops it, a scream ripping his throat raw; touching Malfoy feels like he is holding his palm to a boiling-hot kettle. Malfoy jolts, mouth open, but Harry tightens his grip, squeezing his eyes shut, shoving aside the roar that rises in his mind at Malfoy’s touch.
opened up in his chest, and it was all he could do to stop himself from yanking Potter in close. Instead, he allowed himself to be helped up into the bed, his arms shaking from the effort of controlling himself.
Luc had laughed at the expression on Harry’s face when they headed out to the newsstand and his mug was blinking at them from every cover page. Harry pretended to be irritated, only because it made Luc laugh more and Harry was perfectly willing to do a little playacting to make the other man laugh.
The Crown Prince is gasping, his fingernails digging into Harry’s back. The pain prickles through the haze that has overtaken Harry’s mind, and he rears up, swearing profusely. The other man is sprawled across his bed, eyes glazed with desire. He reaches up for Harry, mewling, but Harry grabs Malfoy’s wrists, pushing it above the other man’s head with one hand. He bites down hard on his other hand, breath rasping as the pain dissipates a bit more of the fog.
Harry Potter’s group draws closer to Draco’s compartment. Draco catches the distaste that flashes across Sirius Black’s face at the sight of the Malfoys. Still, his mother’s cousin raises a hand in greeting. Mother waves in response, her face bland. She was so surprised the man did not snub her at Madam Malkin’s, and – Draco suspects – a little pleased.
‘No, no, I think—I think it’s a Veela thing,’ Draco interrupts. ‘It’s not—bad. It’s only … It can be overwhelming, but I’m used to it by now.’ He isn’t meeting Harry’s eyes, and Harry looks at Draco’s hands rigid by his sides, the first sign Draco Malfoy is hiding something.
He knows he does not look like their typical alpha. With his long blonde hair and pale grey eyes, and tall lean figure, he takes after his mother more than his alpha progenitor.
Draco sat there in the cold water, shivering, until dawn broke and it was time to return to Hogwarts.
‘Salazar, I had no idea you’re the sort who needs to ask,’ he says. ‘Did you ask Granger and Weasley too?’
Draco does not look up. He is patting the leaves off his robes, and rubbing at dirt spots with his wand hand. Harry watches him in silence for a few seconds, his mind whirling with disbelief and disconcertment. Draco is
‘I’ve had two before you arrived,’ Potter mutters, his hurt disappearing behind frustration and disappointment. ‘But I’m not
tiny, disease-ridden, rotting piece of shit. I’m afraid that’s one too many rent-boys you’ve been visiting.’
‘Well, I wouldn’t call it a barter. You have come out of it having given something up, but I didn’t. I managed to get your name exonerated, gave the papers a story on my terms, and hopefully, forced them into a more responsible route of journalism.’
‘Really?’ Draco breathed, shoving his trousers and pants down. His cock sprang free, undeniably hard.
‘Why did you stop visiting then?’ Draco demands. ‘That last night – you were going to kiss me, I know you were. But you didn’t, and you didn’t come back. Why did you run?’
They don’t speak for a while. The time will come for the stories, but Draco can only think of Harry and his physical,
‘I was crying because it hurts when I think about Draco Malfoy. It’s true what they said in the papers. He was my lover,’ Harry said simply. ‘I can’t help him anymore because he’s dead, but I can do what I can to help his friends. You’re right – I
In her rejection, Lizzy accused Darcy of being the last man in the world she could be prevailed upon to marry; his pride, conceit and disregard for everyone else around him have not encouraged her opinion of him. She also mentioned Wickham – a name that seemed to have an electrifying effect on Darcy, who recoiled and demanded what connection she has with the man. Lizzy does not stop there. She pinned upon him the greatest crime of all: strategising to destroy her beloved sister’s happiness by taking Bingley away. The two parted in a rage.
Draco knows when Harry whirls out of a Portkey onto the British Isles: the constant ache deep in his bones flares to life, a dagger flaying him open. Mother tells him hesitantly that Harry is home, that the prick wrote to her a week ago. Ron and Hermione watch him apprehensively, and try too hard to distract him with work. So, he waits a day—two days—but the bloody
‘The Map,’ Potter said, holding his hand out. His eyes were filled with black loathing, his upper lip curling as if Draco was something rancid.
Harry doesn’t reply, and continues rubbing at his neck. He knows what Zabini means: the abrupt pain that spears him through his chest, his skin crawling with the certainty that this is wrong, so very wrong, and he must go and leave this dangerous man. His heart is palpitating in his chest, his eyes watering. The sensation subsides after a while, and he glares at Zabini.
No, because Draco won’t allow it. It’s too dangerous. He forces a smile, his fingernails digging into his palms. ‘No time like the present then.’
He opened his eyes again. The Cabinet stood before him, still balanced on stacks of old books, a dust-streaked door hanging off on rusty hinges. Yet … yet there was something different about it: a faint, bluish-white glow shimmering within the dark wood. Draco reached out. He stopped a centimetre away from the surface, his hand trembling, his entire arm shaking. He was too cold. He was too hot.
His father is talking about a man he has gone to see today, an old schoolmate from Hogwarts. ‘I should have known Snape wouldn’t do anything for us,’ Father grumbles. ‘Greasy prick. He has always been so quick to wriggle his way in to those with power. Good of him to cast us aside now that we have none.’
Harry’s eyes were gentle and warm and hazy. This was an intimacy like Draco had never felt before: leaning in close enough to smell the rich wine on Harry’s breath as he talked to Draco openly, with no barriers. Happiness was a warm, butter-golden glow in his chest, heavy and lazy in his limbs.
“We’re all suffering for being sorted into the wrong house,” Theo continued. “It wasn’t even our fault, was it? It was the way we were raised, and of course, that stupid Hat would not see anything beyond that.”
, that made Harry feel as if he were the stars and the dream of stars and distant planets. Like Harry was magic itself.
“Healer Mitra said Veela hair was used,” Draco said. “He didn’t say anything about another main ingredient.”
Draco pulls away abruptly, causing Harry to frown. He slips his hand into Harry’s, tugging. ‘Come on.’
Bingley obligingly takes up the conversation. He, who is often innocent of any attempt to converse for the sake of concealment, fails to see the transparent efforts of others. Darcy looks at Malfoy with a quizzical brow, but does not mention it. To Harry’s relief, Mrs. Bennet decides that the appropriate response is to ignore Malfoy pointedly, and Lydia, who sees the ottoman, puts on her flightiest, silliest airs to distract the Muggles. Harry has not felt so warm towards his little sister than this moment.
Harry looked up in alarm at her words, more struck by her tone – which usually meant he was in trouble – than what she was saying.
, Harry Potter arrives at Platform 9 ¾. Draco feels a tug just beneath his breastbone, and his head snaps up.
Slowly, he feels the veil lift, but the moment has passed, and leaves no trace for him to glean what Harry is hiding. He is tempted to demand Harry tell him right now, as he usually does with everyone, but there is something crystal-like about Harry after Dumbledore’s death: something bound to shatter if pushed. And Harry breaking now—when Voldemort is looming on the horizon—is horrifying to contemplate.
‘Yes, I know that now, of course,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘But like I said, it’s weird that you talk like an adult. Are you
The Veela Alena moves with effortless grace and strength, turning around occasionally to check that the Malfoys are still following her. They are, as they have been doing for the past three hours. They trail after her like foolish children lured in to the witch’s oven with the promise of candy. It takes another two hours before they come to the meeting point: a circle of enormous heaventrees arranged so perfectly no human hands – or wands – could have achieved it.
Remus is silent, as they withdraw and close the door. After a beat, Draco steals out of the room, padding on soundless feet to the master bedroom. He presses his ear against the wood.
He is thrown onto his side on a hard, wooden floor. Frozen, he can only watch as the big man crouches down before him. The man is sweating, a great dirty leer stretched across his face.
Sirius’s clothes—his usual Muggle attire of T-shirt and jeans—are ripped in places, the tears revealing raw, bloodied skin. His long hair is matted and dark with blood, redness dripping down his swollen face. His right leg is bent at an unnatural angle, and there is a whole scoop of flesh in his right arm that is gone, revealing grey-red gristle and shining, white bone. Sirius’s dark eyes—usually lively with laughter and gaiety—land on Harry; Harry sees that his right eye has been hurt, redness spreading all over the white of his eyeball.
,’ he snarls. He would have left with Harry in his arms in a whirl of feathers, if Harry isn’t patting his arm soothingly, saying, ‘It’s all right, Draco, they are only saying it. They wouldn’t separate us. I wouldn’t leave you, never again, remember? It’s okay, we’re okay.’
There are also Aurors and Ministry workers in the Order: Mad-Eye Moody—the real one, not the Death Eater imposter—a stern-faced man named Kingsley Shacklebolt; Tonks, an Metamorphmagus who can change her appearance at will; Percy Weasley. They speak of internal strife in the Ministry: a few high-ranking officials are trying to get rid of the current Minister, Cornelius Fudge. But he is still Minister and is exhorting caution, claiming that Voldemort is still too much reduced to be a threat. For now, the Ministry is doing nothing, so the Order must act.
Disgust bubbles up in his chest, forcing him to stop. He leans over, a hand braced on the alley wall, gagging. He gave in to temptation; like always, he’s too weak to resist, to do the
Draco dealt with them the way he knew best: he acknowledged them and smirked, preening as if their talk emboldened him. He was glad, however, that he had sent Mother off early. She didn’t need to deal with this bollocks.
Harry laughs despite himself, and shakes his head. ‘No, but I’ll keep that in mind. It’s a different question.’
Draco shook his head; he would be so grateful he was alive to be even sent into prison. ‘Potter – what was he doing there?’ he repeated.
“Come on, where are all those nice words you had for Ron and Hermione?” Potter demanded. “Don’t you have anything else to say to me?”
aware of Potter, but he is. The thread between them thrums, strong and true, leading Potter to him as surely as Draco feels Potter’s confusion and desperation. Draco is now privy to Potter’s emotions, tuned into every moment Potter should be afraid or tired or weary or sad. Colette said that this would make it easier for the Veela to protect the mate.
‘Yeah?’ Luc was leaning across the counter top, arm stretched out, head braced on a hand. He turned sideways, facing Harry fully. ‘How did I help you, Harry Potter?’ His lashes were lowered, a slight flush to his cheeks, lips wet. There was something in the way he said Harry’s name. An emphasis, a barely there hitch in Luc’s throat.
‘Curious,’ the old man says. ‘Very curious. The phoenix that gave this wand its core gave just one other feather. The wand I made with that feather—thirteen-and-a-half inches, yew—is the one that gave you that scar.’
‘I forgive you,’ Harry said. ‘I forgive you for giving me Amortentia. I forgive you for walking away. I forgive you for being such a stupid boy. I forgive you, Draco. Come back to me.’
?’ No. No, no, no, Sirius hasn’t died—has he? How long has it been since his death? He thought Draco would kill Voldemort for killing him; he had relied on that. How did Sirius die?
Harry doesn’t want to see such anxiety in his godfathers’ eyes, so after that first month, he does his best to take the potion without flinching; to force himself to be patient because while he is weak the first few days, he does recover his strength. There are days he cannot sleep, kept awake by nightmares of his magic disappearing and having to go back to the Muggle world, but he hides those days from Minnie, Sirius and Moony. They won’t know how he has cried.
‘How can he? I’m telling Mother about this,’ Pansy scowls darkly, her fingers digging into Draco’s flesh. ‘We aren’t doing anything wrong. We are walking in
Already, Draco’s touch is chasing away the chill in his chest, and the awful, grey numbing sensation in his limbs is dissipating. The tangle of fear and anxiety in the pits of his stomach loosens. Draco is using his Veela healing powers—something he discovered quite by accident at the end of first year: when Professor Quirrell, driven mad by Voldemort’s possession, cast
‘Yes, I hear that you do not speak,’ the new visitor says, crouching down by Draco’s head. He smells of fetid pond water and sour sweat—an unhealthy scent. Draco is curious enough to lift his head. The Veela is dark-haired and dark-eyed, olive-skinned, a thin, bony face with lips twisted into a sardonic smirk: ‘You can smell it?’
‘Maybe,’ Draco says. ‘I rather thought you were losing your famous Gryffindor nerve, you see. I had to do something about the way you kept staring at me all the time. Ginny was egging me on too.’
‘I disagreed with them. So, my boy, don’t you dare disagree with me!’ Father said, smiling to show that he is only joking, and they both knew that Draco often got what
the choice to be a Death Eater – made the choice to be Voldemort’s!’ He laughed when Draco flinched at the name. ‘And you don’t even dare speak his name? How can you be afraid to
Expectedly, Dumbledore was reluctant to include Draco, Hermione and the others. And as usual, Minnie overrode him. ‘Draco must know, because he will be with Harry every step of the way,’ she stated. ‘And why not the rest of the children, when they have faced every danger by Harry’s side as well? You know very well they will be the ones to help him when we cannot.’
He smells of damp earth and dead plants, and his hand leaves moist black streaks on Draco’s face. His eyes wide and unblinking are scouring Draco from head to toe, desire piercing into Draco like needles under his fingernails. Draco’s skin is crawling with the fire ants of revulsion, his insides squirming with Flobberworms. He wants to throw up, his mouth watering with saliva, his throat convulsing.
Harry smoothens out the paper; it’s a little crinkled from how hard he pressed in to keep his handwriting neat. He can’t wait to show Sirius what he has done. It was
He has Apparated without a wand once as a child, to escape Dudley and his friends. He can do it again; he only needs to concentrate, and once these fuckers are distracted somehow, once there is an opening … He grits his teeth, blinking the sweat away from behind his glasses, eyes fixed on their attackers.
But that is before he disappeared for three months without explanation—Harry is so angry—he would be, too, if he were him—and Harry wouldn’t forgive him.
. That’s what we do for each other, isn’t it? It’s like last year, when we helped you against Quirrell.’
‘One is bound to be a little strange after so many years in deep scholarship of wands,’ Minnie says. ‘Well, now that you have your wand, shall we look at robes before tea?’
So Draco told him about growing up in the Manor, where it seemed to be cold all the time. His parents had made sure he never wanted for anything, and because he was an only child, they had arranged frequent play dates with Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy.
Zabini, walking behind him, snorted. ‘Not bloody likely. Besides the fact that your parents wouldn’t consider me
Without another look at Draco, he strode away, tearing the door open and disappearing down the corridor. Draco stood alone, gripping the edge of the desk behind him, the sound of his heart thunderous in his ears.
‘Why yes, I would have asked her out if she weren’t already dating Dean Thomas,’ Zabini said coolly.
They neared the Astronomy Tower. Draco pelted around the corner and felt his heart jump into his throat. A mixture of professors and students were coming down from the other way. Somebody spotted Draco and the Death Eaters and shouted. A spell cracked the wall next to his face.
What with his life falling apart around him, Draco was rather grateful that Potter had taken to assiduously avoiding him. Potter would no doubt be put off following him around and Draco could focus on his work without worrying about Potter finding out his secret.
He hears them salute— "Your majesty!" —and the footsteps stomping after him. He smells the ire, like bitter herbs, on the omega's scent, but they do not speak, as they march through the ruined corridors, holes in the crumbling walls revealing the blurry purple moors surrounding the estate.
It’s a good thing he has taken the trouble to learn how to transform at will. With a few powerful down-strokes of his white wings, the top of his head is level with the windowsill. He grunts, catching onto the very edge of the sill with his claws. He brings himself close to the cold, rough stones, digging his claws in.
The article had reduced Malfoy to a conniving seducer, Harry a humiliated trembling virgin. He had flatly refused to address the story whenever a reporter waylaid him at some official event. He would neither confirm nor deny it, because it was none of their fucking business what had gone on between Malfoy and him.
. How many times in his childhood has he stumbled upon a Veela-exclusive problem his parents cannot understand and cannot begin to alleviate? They do not have his teeth, his senses, his skin, his magic. Draco stands in front of his parents in a dirty wand shop, and hears the crack of the earth splitting between them—an unbridgeable crevice.
‘Mr Remus Lupin—your wand is ten-and-a-quarter inches, cypress, unicorn hair. It is, of course, a close mate to Mr Black’s. Yes, soulmates would have complementary magical signatures, and we see that in the wands that chose you. Yes, yes, your case has given me profound first-hand insight into wandlore regarding soulmates,’ Ollivander says, very pleased, and turns to Minnie. ‘And Miss Minerva McGonagall—nine-and-a-half inches, fir, dragon heartstring. The survivor’s wand, of course, of course …’
He understands why Harry had to leave five years ago, even though he would rather he didn’t, if only to hold on to comfortable, self-righteous rage. It
Zabini chuckles, his laughter low and attractive. ‘Perhaps not at this juncture,’ he agrees. ‘Well, Bennet, your first step is phenomenally simple. Walk over there, and ask him for a dance.’
Draco peered at Mother from the corner of his eye as Madam Malkin fussed with the hem of the dark green robes he was trying on. Mother had insisted that Draco made a new set of robes to replace the ones he had grown out of over the summer; when he would have the occasion to wear them, Mother knew best.
Magic shot through his arm, singing in his blood, in his bones. There was heat and friction; it was like touching the sizzling edges of a wall of lightning. Magic, strong and pure and alive, ricocheted through his body, through his mind.
Harry is ashen, his anger giving way to skin-crawling shame and guilt. In this moment, Draco reads his mate’s emotions more clearly than ever. Harry closes his eyes, as if unable to bear looking at him any longer, lips pressed tightly together. Self-righteous anger is a heady force, and it goads him into action: he leans forward and kisses Harry’s pale, unhappy face.
Potter was shaking his head, his face wet. His fingers were ice-cold against Draco’s. ‘No – Malfoy, I didn’t mean to –’
As time goes on, Ollivander gets more and more excited, dancing around his shop and rummaging deep into his shelves to yank out boxes coated in a thick layer of dust. Abruptly, he gives a wordless yell and disappears down the dark hallway behind the counter. Harry looks over his shoulder at Minnie and Moony, baffled and worried. He flexes his sore fingers, surrounded by little mountains of discarded boxes.
