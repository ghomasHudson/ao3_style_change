As if reading his mind, Albus reached into his pocket and pulled out a wrinkled, folded newspaper clipping. Draco took it. In large, sprawling letters across the top  were the words: GINEVRA POTTER MURDERED BY DEATH EATER.
, that he was actually impressed.
," he breathed as the tingling heat pulsed around his cock beneath Harry’s mouth. Harry moaned approvingly against him, and the vibration drove him over the edge. Draco cried out, an almost fragile, desperate sound, and pushed his hips off the tile with a final thrust into Harry’s mouth, still clutching Harry’s head as he came, entire body convulsing with euphoria.
Draco didn’t really know what to do. An apology didn’t really seem fitting. He could pat Albus comfortingly on the shoulder, but didn’t want it to seem pitying or condescending. Instead, he continued to sit beside Albus in silence, watching the three silhouettes above the Quidditch pitch. Finally, as he moved to stand up, he said, “If you ever want more of a Potions challenge than what you’re getting in class, come see me. I’d be happy to tutor you personally.”
“It doesn’t concern you!” James turned and spat the words at him. Draco was far taller than James was, and Draco watched with amusement as James’ eyes slowly lifted toward his. However, there was not a hint of remorse or guilt in his gaze--not even the slightest indication that James was intimidated by Draco.
Potter crossed his arms over his chest and looked down at his feet. “Ginny gave them to me,” he murmured quietly.

to himself like a goddamned lunatic. Draco walked past his quarters and veered down the next hallway. He didn’t stop until he was standing directly in front of Potter’s door. Seeing as his hands were full, he kicked against the wood a couple of times with his shoe.
Still, even without a Fountain of Youth, he'd felt younger in the last few months than he had in a very long time.

“Nothing like now, I suppose.”
“The Dark Lord cannot be killed! Was he killed the first time? Was he?” Draco asked angrily.

And back to sarcasm. “Yes, Mr. Potter, so I can kill him myself.”
On three, Draco spun around. “Expelliarmus!”
ruthlessly bullied Longbottom in school. "Longbottom," Draco breathed, "wait."
James eyed him suspiciously. “What are you doing up here anyway?”
Draco rolled his head to the side, so that his chin was still resting on Harry’s neck but his lips were free to speak. “About the potion. This,” he said, pressing his hands tight and flat against Harry’s chest. Golden heat surged warmly between them like a wave. “I don’t know what it is, but it’s not a potion.”
Draco spent his time teaching, trying not to let Potter or his children drive him to madness, and doing his best to avoid direct contact with Potter. He still kept an eye on him from the battlements, but that was more for school
“Does he know you’re up here?” James asked.
pressed tightly together. As they both reached out--
Draco could only nod. He was in too much pain. He felt his trembling intensify. Resisting the potion hurt. Merlin, it hurt. He felt like he was being ripped open. He felt like Potter had cast Sectumsempra on him all over again, like Voldemort had cast a Crucio. He dug his toes into the floor and gasped. He fell back onto his bed with a pained cry, gripping the blankets into tight fists.
“Draco, I--”
“Yeah, well, why don’t
“What did you

.” He traced the fingertips of his right hand up Potter’s neck, thrilled to see gooseflesh trailing his touch, and wove them forcefully into that mess of dark hair, pulling Potter’s head back a little before pushing him close again. He heard Potter’s breath quiver, and felt Potter’s right hand--the hand that Weasley couldn’t see--grip Draco’s waist. Potter’s reaction delighted him, and Draco closed his eyes, relishing the feeling of Potter’s willing hand against him. “And when we get back to the castle,” Draco licked his lips, “you are going to sneak to my room. Because,” Draco moved his head so Weasley couldn’t see what he was doing, and ran his tongue along the length of Potter’s ear. He sucked Potter’s earlobe into his mouth, rolling it gently between his lips. Merlin
“Hey,” she whispered, sliding her fingers alluringly along Potter’s shoulders in a way that made Draco want to slap her away. “How about you come back to my place tonight? I promise I’ll make it worth your while.” She slid a piece of paper onto the bar and turned, swaying her hips as she walked back toward the corner of the room. Draco glanced down and saw that she had slid him Apparition coordinates.
, said nothing about helping with Draco’s potions experiments that night like he had promised, and hurriedly shuffled off without a word as soon as the meeting was over. He supposed he would just need to find someone else for help with his potions work, if there was anyone else left who was willing to volunteer.
“Yes, yes, you win,” Weasley sighed, rolling his eyes. Draco looked up to see Potter returning from the loo, looking a little flustered.
He'd found Harry.

“No, Professor, that’s the thing. My dad hasn’t been able to cast a Patronus since my mom died. It’s one of the reasons he left the Aurors. You
Harry dolefully nodded twice, tightening his hand over Draco’s as they looked up at the bursts of light sparkling across the sky.

Cornelius.
“Sit.” Potter commanded, finally sounding more sure of himself.
Potter glanced at Draco and then down into his pint glass. “No," he said softly. "He tried, but I immobilized him and brought him down to my office. It was a few days before I quit the Aurors.”
Because he very frequently found himself focusing on the memory of Harry Potter in his bed. The feeling of Potter’s hot breath against his neck. Against his

. They never involved Death Eaters trying to regain power; they were never direct and personal threats to the lives of people Draco cared about.
“Potion Five?” Potter asked, frowning down at Draco's research journal. “But you said to give you the next one. The next one is Potion Four.”
Luna feels sorry for him as he tries to convince Draco the Pacifist that losing one's eye is not a big deal, and was, in fact, an unexpected gift.
like Harry.  "That should help with the bugs," Harry says.  "And don't worry about him; he's just come out of Jenny's.  He's already had his date."
"You are in St. Mungo's," Draco thought, and Harry looked at him. His eyes were still closed and his hand still held Harry's firmly.
"Exactly."
"Okay."  Footsteps led slowly away.  Brown oak bark.  Brown fruit bat fur.  "But can't you tell?  It's a day for dreams to come true."
"Don't touch it.  Knowing your luck, you'll inadvertently curse it just by breathing on it.  Move away, you catastrophe."  Harry had some driving impetus to get his fingers into everything.
Well… maybe he was only announcing it to those who knew where to look.
"I called you and you didn't answer," she said with a shrug.  "Well?" she asked as Draco examined the parchment he'd been writing on.  He unrolled a portion of it and began reciting from a long list.
"Did you hear Greyback?" Harry asked, changing the subject.  "No magic."
The lump on the bed continued to breathe that soft, snuffling snore.
Too bad Dregor was too valuable to just let go.  The man knew his antiques and his ledgers were immaculate.  Plus, he put up with stupid people far better than Draco ever could.
"Hush, little baby, don't say a word. Mama's gonna…"
something.
"You think the Queen of the Fae would enjoy a song that is sung to the Queen of Muggle England?" Draco asked.  As he talked, Harry watched his lips.  "Harry?"  Draco squinted at him.
Perhaps he never would have grown into the man he was now if it hadn't been for the Dark Lord, but Draco didn't like to dwell on that.  He liked to offer that prestigious acclaim to Severus.
know whatever spell Granger might have used to hide something of such importance.  And anyway, it doesn’t have to be a book, it could be anything.  Something transfigured even."
"Good.  Let's get down to business, shall we Malfoy.  I know you were Snape’s second; that you were working for the Order.  I know you received coded messages from our side.  Algebraic equations?  I need to know how to decipher them.  It's important–" He paused, looking earnestly at Draco as he handed him a tightly rolled parchment, "it might save Hermione."
"Soft, yeah?" Potter said eagerly.  "It took me a long time to mimic the cashmere texture from sheep wool, but after some serious experimentation with Transfiguration and Charm spells, I came up with this.  Nice."  He didn't end it as a question, though Draco felt the man was seeking some sort of acknowledgment, praise even, and wasn't that a kick in the pants—Harry Potter seeking praise from a wartime enemy.
"As you wish, Lily," Draco said, planting a kiss on his forehead.  Lily flinched.  Draco wondered at the reaction and tucked it away for further study; small things told long tales if you were willing to listen.
"You know—it just isn’t the same without all of the old professors.  Hooch isn’t even there; did you know that?  She retired last year.  Off to Acapulco or some other tropical getaway.  Imagine, Hooch in a bikini!"  Ron shivered and grimaced, giving Harry the impression that Ron would rather eat slugs again than focus on that imagery.  "McGonagall is looking to retire and is searching for a replacement, too.  But Pince, she’s still there and still as crotchety as ever.  It was a relief actually.  When she threatened to throw me out, I knew it really was Hogwarts and not an empty ghost."  He drank down the rest of his butterbeer.
Draco muttered something completely incoherent.  Harry leaned forward and perked his ears.  "I couldn't hear you."
"Yeah, not a problem. We're shagging anyway," Draco added for the benefit of the swooning girl in the back. He clearly heard, "Damn, why are all the hot ones gay," and smirked up at Harry, who kept smiling.
working.  I can't just leave the store unattended.  Perhaps I can come by after I close the shop or tomorrow before 7 a.m.?"
"Good morning, Wolfwood," Draco said cheerily as he peeled himself off of Harry. Harry grabbed his waist and pulled him back down for a kiss.
"But we have to get the orb, or at least stop whoever is using it. People have died! We can't let whoever is doing this get away with it," Ron practically cried in fevered excitement.
"You don't know
He felt a damp hand grasp his right and another rest gently on his left shoulder.
!"  The man fell dead.
Those dark eyes grew wide, and Harry congratulated himself at shocking his old potions professor.
"Granger, where is CatBoy?"  The woman jumped from her place at the table and stuffed her hands in her pockets.  Her behavior had turned nervous and ferrety.  Draco didn't trust her.  She obviously had something to hide.  Maybe the personality of her left hand was taking over, forcing her to do unspeakable things that only the side of
"And nothing.  He kissed me.  End of tantalizing tale.  Go read some smut or something, Pansy."
Potter sat, holding her denim purse across her knees, and the other Potter squatted next to the chair and Draco realized he needed to give them some other designation.
Harry glowed with excitement, his earlier aloof attitude vanished.  His worry just… gone.
Harry had taken to the nocturnal way of life, and while it felt like he'd also adopted an inordinate amount of napping time, he doubted that he'd missed anything too important.  One of the reasons to go about at night was that there were less people trying to touch him.  Everyone, even the teachers, tried to pet him.  He'd become the friendly neighborhood kitty and while a little petting by some of his friends didn't bother him, when Mr. Filch chased after him, calling "Here Kitty Kitty" with his hand outstretched, it was a bit too much.
Then the air filled with the sparkle of lights and music.  As one unit, the fairies turned to them all and bowed.  Severus dipped his head and Harry kind of chuckled, running his hand through his hair, stirring up the calm style it had briefly held.
A few moments passed, the air empty of breath or talk.  "I figure it's easier to just say it than spend another week dancing around, not that I don't mind the dancing," Potter said, and Draco could tell he was smiling by the warm tone of his voice.
Then someone stirred and he looked down to see Harry nuzzling into his side, his eyes relaxed closed.  His hair stuck up in the back and the remnants of his scar peeked through the part in his bangs.
There was tarnish on his brass and a gold tooth that caught the light.
What would he think?
"I don't want any trouble."
to meet with you for drinks."
Ron groaned in despair.
But then, time had run out.
Terry squints at Draco.  He feels like a specimen floating about in a jar of alaxial fluid, ready for the cauldron.  He's sure that Terry will be the first to arrive with fork and knife in hand on feasting day.
Think about that latest speech he delivered to the media and how he now feels like an utter fool.
Harry looked up, his eyes red-rimmed and pooled with tears.  He seemed shocked to see what lay around him.  Lifting up his hands he examined them.
"You are ready, we must return."
"Do you think he's sincere?"
His stomach growled.  Damn, what he wouldn't give for some fish and chips.  Or just chips.  Or perhaps even shoe leather.
A woman came around the corner of a bakery and ran up to them, calling out angrily and the little boy looked sharply at his own shoes, avoiding the woman's stern gaze.  She babbled to Draco about something, grabbed the boy's hand and tugged him down the street.
"So, Peeves is Snape's eyes?" CatBoy asked Hermione with a chuckle, and fell to silence at Peeve's mournful whine.  Hours had passed and they'd all worked hard on a nasty concoction that Severus wouldn't deign to explain, but it was finally finished.
"Will this be good enough, will it keep out all the bad things?"
"Thanks, Remus.  I'll take it from here."  Remus insisted that he should stay and help, but Harry convinced him that since he'd spent the last week researching, learning and redesigning this spell, that it would be best if he reviewed Snape's notes himself.  Finally, Remus left after offering to make dinner.  In a way, Harry felt bad.  This research gave him something to do.  Remus could only wait for the executioner's ax to drop.
“Certainly.  English Breakfast if you have it.”  Potter stepped back and Draco entered.  No pile of jumpers overburdened the chair, though the scent of lanolin was light in the house now that the fish smell no longer penetrated the air.  “Smells like sheep in here, Potter.”  He glanced up at the ship and the roiling sea.
"Now!  I'm ready now," Potter urged, and Draco couldn't argue because this dance was coming to an end and he couldn’t wait for the finale.  Slowly, and with care, he slid into Potter's waiting body.  And Merlin, wasn't that worth a million stakeouts in the cold and the ever-present scent of sheep?  In no time, both men were crying out; Draco fisted Potter's prick as he thrust into his tight body.  So hot and perfect and he swore his brain malfunctioned as he spilled himself deep inside, filling Potter as he continued to pump his lover's aching cock with his hand.
.  Her ship does not take kindly to trespassers, nor does she.
"Well, three tasks in one day," Draco said.  "I guess we can last another day.  Though our food is running low."  He stared down at the creature in his fist.  "Is there some food around here?  A French restaurant?  A curry shop?"
Failed, Harry had failed.
Luna stares down at her Captain.  "You."  Then she whisks away like a leaf on the breeze.
Potter tilted his head in thought.  Draco found his situation ironic: drinking with Potter on this of all days.  It'd been a year since Potter had disappeared.  Though Draco fought against it, he’d contracted the same fever of dismay infecting wizarding England.  Their hero had fallen, lost to the unknown.
"Of course not.  Heroes do not have such weakness as allergies."  He returned to reading, Lucius propped up on his lap and the locket dangling from his neck.
Draco gasped and trembled.  Bobbing between his legs, Harry could see his full cock hanging heavy.  Something in Harry stirred, and he pressed his hand against his own dick, unmoving, but not lifeless.  His balls ached.
"Severus…" Harry began again, tentative, afraid.  Afraid of what, he wasn't sure.  Afraid Severus would yell at him, accuse him of losing Draco.  Afraid that he would blow up, throw the mug and paint the room in cold black tea.  Afraid that Severus would sit there, quiet, and ignore Harry, making him keenly aware of just how alone he was in this displaced sliver of existence.
"Well…"  Draco never liked to talk about the more… odd aspects to his physical state.  Sure, Harry knew that he drank blood and had heightened physical powers, long life and a few other things, but they never really talked much about the other things he could do.  "Why do you want to know now?"
While certainly better than that small, mildewed cell, his new accommodations on the ship, encompassing a little bed and charmed chamber pot, are still a prison.  Sprawled upon a wool blanket, rough spun and sheep-scented, Draco toys with his new accessory, a small iron Anchor Charm tied around his neck with a piece of hemp rope.  It's scratchy and has an earthy aroma, and Draco can't help but feel collared with this noose around his neck.  Like a dog.

“The Malfoys are back in London?”
He took a late lunch and reluctantly made his way to the Faculty Room. Cliques of colleagues were standing outside, sipping pumpkin juice or tea and sharing stories of their first week. No one gave him a second glance and, if they did, they certainly didn’t invite him to join their conversations. So this is how it was going to be. Here, everyone knew his past. There was no escaping it, and they were going to treat him like rubbish because of it. He wove between one social group and another, and finally into the nearly empty Faculty Room. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were talking quietly to themselves in a far corner. Draco had his choice of seats. He chose a chair near the door in case he needed to escape. Eventually, Potter, Weasley, and Granger took their seats across the table from him as other colleagues filtered into the room. Soon every chair in the room was filled. Every chair, that is, except for the chairs to the left and right of Draco Malfoy.
really. Whenever Draco got too frustrated, he took great pleasure in removing points from Gryffindor on account of James’ predictably snobbish behavior in his classroom. Whenever he found that he needed a break, he walked the grounds, usually along the lake, around the Quidditch pitch, and back to the castle.
“Harry, I think you may be overrea-”
After a few silent minutes in the dark, Potter started laughing.
“Oh thank goodness,” Lily sighed. “We’re saved.”
and willing to be a part of his life. As allies went, Harry Potter wasn’t so bad. Hadn’t he wanted Potter as an ally all those years ago, when he was just an eleven year old boy hoping the Boy Who Lived would take his hand on a train? Draco took a deep, steadying breath. “Let’s try this again, shall we?” Draco slowly lifted his hand across the gap between them. Raindrops fell into his open palm as Potter stared at it dumbfoundedly. “It’s called a handshake, Potter.”
Draco gulped air and glued his eyes to Potter’s face. Beads of water kept dripping from his hair onto his cheeks and damn it all if Draco didn’t find himself wanting to lick them away. Merlin, he had to

gone to Cairo briefly that summer, desperate to find something that he may have missed. He'd taken hundreds of photos of the walls. He'd gone over his notes endlessly and had thought himself in the same dead-end circles. He was coming to the inevitable conclusion that his attempt to find the Fountain of Youth was nearing a dead end.
They sat in comfortable silence and Draco stared toward the open door of the shower cubicle as heat danced across his knuckles beneath Harry’s mouth. “This room,” he murmured finally, “was once the bane of my existence.”
. It was like he had suddenly gone back in time. True, Potter’s eyes looked wearier. Wiser, perhaps, but sadder too. And he had adorable little crinkles forming at the corners of his eyes as his mouth lifted into a barely noticeable smile. And Draco’s heart had skipped a beat. Despite the mess, and the dirt, and the sweat, and the tatters, Potter still looked...
Lily popped out from behind Harry’s robes. “Hello Professor Malfoy,” she said, grinning. “Did you have a good holiday?”
“I can’t hear you!”
“Of course. You do...remember him?” Granger asked cautiously. Remember him? How the hell could anyone forget Harry bloody Potter? But more importantly--Potter
"You're here!" she gasped excitedly, taking the cane. "Does this mean you're staying?"
“Dad punched him.”
Draco sighed and left, the tinkling bell mocking him on his way out. If every clothier was booked, then the decision was made for him. Draco would not be reentering society. Not that night, at least. ...Not that he had considered it. Because the reason for stepping into the shop in the first place had simply been to obtain some new dress robes before leaving for Cairo.
Well, that did it.

When he had finished, James instantly gasped and scrambled to his feet, his eyes wide. "Holy shit," James breathed, blinking at Draco. "You're in love with him."
, which meant that Potter was completely oblivious that two people were watching him from the battlements.
friends. It was the last thing he'd expected when he'd come to Hogwarts. ...And, he suspected, one of the first things he would miss.
Draco had managed to compartmentalize Potter completely over the last few months. The Potter box, with all of his Potter emotions, was tucked safely away in a corner of his brain, never to be opened again.
Draco walked toward the front of the room, smiling to himself. There was something strangely delightful in doling out punishment to Potters. His delight was soon squandered, however, when he turned around to discover that James had already fled the room, leaving his potions partner to clean the mess. “Stop,” Draco told the boy. “Do you know exactly where James sleeps in the Gryffindor House?”
have been. He had never once been allowed to call his father “dad,” as Harry’s children did. It was always, “yes sir,” or “no sir.” They had never once talked of love. He had been overjoyed if his father had so much as smiled at him. And yet, despite all of that, he loved his father. He knew that, in his own way, his father had loved him. There had still been rare moments when he had witnessed his parents break down and

Potter turned to smile, and even in the dark Draco could see the relief on his face. Draco moved to return his wand to Potter, because Potter and his wand were supposedly
“Er.” He looked down at Draco's old hawthorn wand and fidgeted with it, rolling it in his hands. Finally he sighed. “I guess yours felt... lucky? At first? I mean if you think about it, it had an even more important role in all of this than the Elder Wand did. If you hadn’t disarmed Dumbledore with it, and if I wouldn’t have taken it from you at the Manor, the Elder Wand wouldn’t be mine at all, and then where would we be? Voldemort would still be alive and we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. Probably because we’d be dead.” Potter rolled the wand flat out against his palms and then clutched it back in his fists with a familiarity that almost made Draco jealous of it. “It seemed wrong to keep it tucked away on a shelf somewhere until I could give it back to you.”

how he felt about it. It was fine. They were mostly compliments.
Draco did, making a determined effort to step onto Potter’s back as roughly as possible. He was rewarded when he heard Potter grunting beneath his shoes. He reached up, but still wasn’t anywhere close to reaching the edge. He dug his fingers into the dirt and tried to climb up, but the dirt eroded beneath his hands and crumbled down onto the back of Potter’s head. He aimed a little more dirt onto Potter’s head for good measure. “No use, Potter,” he said, jumping down.

The only possible conclusion was that she must have worked with his father after the war, during that brief time when his father had tried to redeem his mistakes and push beneficial legislation through the Ministry before both of his parents had given up attempts at rejoining society completely and moved to France. Certainly before the war, no one would describe working with his father as

She nodded, frowning.

“Potter, I’m sorry for…” What did he intend to say, exactly? For wanting to ravish you? For wanting to snog you senseless? That would be just perfect, wouldn’t it? “If you…”
James scoffed and walked away. They avoided each other for the better part of fifteen minutes, pacing on their respective portions of the battlements. Eventually, Draco settled in one place, casting a warming charm and leaning against the cold stone. Potter always claimed he was on patrol on nights like these, but he also walked with such thoughtful, determined purpose that Draco often wondered if there was more to it. He walked like a man with the world on his mind.
“There weren’t, actually. Your reputation precedes you, Professor Malfoy. The work you’ve been doing is exquisite. I am particularly eager to discuss your work in Siberia, whenever you feel more settled.”
“What do you think could be causing it?” Granger studied the floor where the door had disappeared. “I mean do all doors lead here? There has to be some kind of pattern.”
Draco sat at the head table in a daze. How strange it all was, seeing the world from the opposite side of this table. He looked out at all of the excited young faces, suddenly nostalgic for his own childhood. For that
Pansy curls over, hollowing out her belly as the blade whiffs harmlessly through the air.  Then she backflips away; Harry stops his attack, his eyes impressively wide as he nods in Pansy's direction.  "Pretty fancy move," he says.
"Great, we have a Rebels' Reunion party in full swing.  Just wait, any second now the Magical Law Enforcement will come knocking on your door with hats and party crackers."  Draco scowled.
Harry looks up at the young man, an amused quirk to his lips.  "Billy."
Had it only been a week?  Two?  The memory of the fires and being torn from Hermione and Ron had begun to turn surreal, like something he'd seen in a movie years before or maybe even a story he'd read in the back of a literary magazine.  Something he didn't quite remember, but certain he'd seen it somewhere.
"Sure thing Potter and you're buying," Pilcher said and everyone keenly agreed.
It was the only thing he could think of, and he blushed just thinking about it, but he knew water was imperative at this point. He’d searched for any kind of container or canteen and had come up empty.  So fidgeting with uncharacteristic shyness, Draco leaned over Harry, ready to press his lips to those of the man who held is heart, and paused to examine his face.
"Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh God,
It'd taken five deep breaths to fully pacify his nerves, but finally Harry felt ready and he pointed
"I was older than you were, you berk," Draco answered as he tapped Harry five times on the crown of his head with his wand.  Harry's eyes scrunched each time, reminding Draco of a cat getting patted.  "It wasn’t until I found out what my father was doing that I first realized the bad people needed to be taken away, that you couldn’t wait for them to go on their own.  I decided I would have to deal with them if the world I hoped to see would ever come about."  Draco was a self-proclaimed vigilante.
"This could be our last cake, what with running out of stuff.  I doubt if Severus would appreciate us using all the sugar for cakes," Draco said sadly.  Harry wondered exactly what they would do once the food ran out.
"Ah. No." Harry spoke definitively. Remus watched Harry's eyes follow the retreating woman.
The colors danced in the morning, light reflecting off the dew and the deep reds and oranges of autumn in the Carpathian Mountains painted everything richly, like the world blazed on fire.
Luna leads Pansy away with a look, and Draco finds himself standing with Harry, the wind howling through the silence separating them.  Harry moves to the railing as the house-elf, Monkey, scampers over the rigging preparing the ship for the high winds.  Her whistle fills the air with shrill commands that Draco can't interpret.  Harry's parrot and that lemur are nowhere to be seen, hiding from the weather.  The sea roils, and Draco's stomach does a dance.  He'd taken a potion not long ago for sea sickness, but still, the flips continue.
"Well, we'll just have to make it twenty-four hours to never forget."
"But," Harry began, so joyous and youthful, "I'll be a hit on the dance floor!" The years of anger and frustration could not stand up to the happiness he had with Draco.
Three steps closed the distance and Harry was there, wrapping his arms around Draco, who stiffened in shock.
"Potter, do calm down and explain yourself," Severus said.  He would not jump for joy.  He would not whoop his relief.  He would not show his excitement in any way.  But when Remus gripped at his arm, he couldn't help but glance over to his lover and offer a hopeful sparkle of his eye.  That would have to do.
Remus was suitably impressed.
Hermione grinned.  Harry scowled.  Draco shifted uncomfortably.
They lay together for warmth.  The door to the outside,
"What?  Really?!  Oh my God!  Of course, we would!"  Hermione squealed as she jumped to her feet; then she ran up to Harry and enveloped him in a girly hug.  Harry jumped about with her, a tad awkwardly, as they chanted, "Baby, baby, baby," together.  The slap of Ron's huge hand on Draco's shoulder practically knocked him over, drawing his attention away from the dancing duo.
Wolfwood donned a thick glove and reached out to Sirius. Sirius held out his hand, then pinching his fingers together, he turned his hand towards himself and then pushed it into his chest. Draco squashed a sharp gag reflex as Sirius' chest's surface tension gave and his hand sunk in through clothing, skin and flesh. He heard a soft gasp over his shoulder. With a flash of light, Sirius pulled out his hand, his ethereal fingers gripped tight around the staff.
"Draco," Harry said in wonder.  It was a complete transformation, and Draco was at a loss.  He didn't know whether to sigh in relief, cheer his success, or step forward and take Harry into his arms.
"Remus, how're you with Arithmancy?"  He placed the book, and a few others he picked up, down on the counter, and Remus counted up his purchases.
The air was crisp in the winter's evening, and Harry and Hermione were bundled up as they marched through the wet streets.  He wore a Weasley wool scarf and hat as well as his outer cloak, trying for a good impression of a toddler overly dressed by an over protective mother.
"Well yes," said the old man as he scratched at his beard.  "He went left up the street.  Said something about Tescos and a television."
The next thing that caught his eyes as he stepped from beyond the mushroom ring's border was Harry, prone, and being slowly suffocated by a snake.
"Thomas, the polar bear."  Draco gave him one of those 'are you insane' looks.  "Merlin's balls, Potter.  Are you not only allergic to yourself but also as blind as Professor Snape?"
"Why?" Thomas asked.  "I'm fine with the arrangement.  The Potters are as well.  I don't really want kids of my own, and here I sort of have them ready made."  He laughed.  "And I love Ginny and I wouldn't want to put them through the whole crap surrounding a divorce.  God, that's the last thing Harry needs.  'Potter's Failed Marriage.'  I can see the headlines now."
"Thanks," Draco said, and ran out of the shop.
"Harry," Draco murmured against his neck and there was something to the sound of it.  Needy, longing, sensual and Harry stiffened.
Draco hugged him, snotty shirt and all.
"Kiss me," Luna says, and Pansy does.  See, it is as simple as that.
"Oh yea?"  He pulled out a small bag from his desk, dumped some powder from the bag into the mug and poured milk over it.  With a flick of his wand he started mixing and warming the contents.  "Mexican hot chocolate.  Good stuff.  Got a batch of it when I was down in the Yucatan.  Wanna try some?"  He started digging around his desk for another cup, pulling out drawers and rifling through papers.
"So," a middle aged woman said, "you must be rather powerful to have taken on so much."
Above all else, Lily seemed familiar to him.  Something in the voice, or maybe the way he carried himself.  It was like trying to remember a word and it was not only on the tip of your tongue, but the back of your brain, and if you thought about it directly, it would dissolve into the ether.  You had to distract it, make it think you were looking for something else, then bring your mind back to it and catch it before it fluttered away.  He was certain he would recognize Lily if they ever met in person, positive that connection would flare up like dragon flame if he ever met Lily's true self face to face.
Aberystwyth greets them with the cheery façade of Victorian buildings rising up five stories from the promenade.  They rotate in color from blue to yellow, to pastel orange and green.  All reminiscent of calm Easter shades that Luna finds comforting, unlike the idea of a rabbit that runs around to each person's yard planting colored eggs he recently laid.  Who ever heard of a male rabbit laying colored eggs?  Brown eggs, maybe.
"No," he finally said.  "We have to go back for him."
"What's Knei Weed do?" Malfoy asked.
believe then?  What do you think is next?"
"Potter, be careful not to poke that," he said, as Harry's finger hovered inches away from a fat, spotted mushroom.
"Harry Potter, so nice to see you here today."  Harry turned towards the reporter gripping her green Quick-Quotes Quill.  She smiled brightly at him, but he did not return the favour.
Long tunnel of nothing. Stairs up. Right.
Ron looked at Harry with a haunted expression. "Harry, let me go." His words so soft Harry had to interpret lip motions once more. Draco and Remus stood nearby, wands at the ready, carefully guarding the open door. Plincher watched on, his attention split between Harry and Ron.
"Harry?" came the shocked reply.
"Oh yes, like a cat with a mouse," Draco said, aiming his wand at the one who had just spoken.  The little fairy was lifting up his gossamer skirt and shaking his hips—and other bits of anatomy—at Draco, which made the pale man go pink.
"Have you found Harry yet?" Weasley asked.  The idiot tried desperately to hold onto Draco's eyes and eventually looked away.  Draco snorted, amused at his discomfort.  So, Weasley had lost CatBoy, too.
Mere seconds slipped by and he was down on all fours, the world around him exposed in a relief of sights, smells and sounds, the lack of which made him feel blind and stupid as a human.  He took a prolonged sniff of the air, inhaling the acrid scents from the car's engine and the spell-fire that had suffused the area only moments before.  His hearing honed into the cacophony of life around him, fanning out in a half circle away from the car.  Car horns, a cat yowling, a rat skittering through the sewer grate.  A groan nearby.
God.  Did he have to sound so excited?   Draco finally tore his eyes off the safety of the black cotton and glared at Potter.
Malfoy’s stomach turned, and no amount of Harry Potter brain compartmentalizing could help him now. The giant that had been sitting on the Potter box had run away, the nails and sticking charms had come undone, and his Harry Potter emotions were now oozing all over the inside of his brain cavity.
“So you’re
So only a silk sheet was separating them.
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” Draco said, with equal teasing in his voice, “because I want to kill you myself.”
Through the dark Draco could see Harry extending both hands toward him. Draco hesitated. A small part of him wanted to refuse. He knew that he should refuse. Logic told him to refuse. But another part of him, an admittedly larger part, was eager. Illogical, and ecstatic, and made of butterflies, and eager. This part desperately wanted to share a bed with Potter. To sleep beneath the same blanket as Potter. To wake up contentedly beside him like he

Before them was a large, elegant room with a small kitchen, a large mirror, a desk, a sofa, and a coffee table. Nearly everything in the room was gilded and glittering. It was clean and lovely, but that’s not what had captured Draco’s attention. What had captured Draco’s attention was the fact that the room had only one bed. One very large, beautiful bed.
"There's no way to know for sure," Longbottom said. "We're still not even sure how they got in."

Draco only had a class of third years that morning, and then he had intended to work on lesson planning for the rest of the day. A faculty meeting? In the Faculty Room? That meant a large round table, where everyone had to look at each other and participate in some sort of stupid icebreaker exercise. He would actually be required to

“How?”

He wriggled out of his robes, took a small sip of vermouth and leaned back onto his pillows, trying to relax. He was still wearing a black silk shirt with silver braces and pale grey trousers, so he rolled his shoulders, taking a moment to appreciate that glorious silk-on-silk feeling. He tried to forget about the night before. He tried to ignore the fact that he could still smell Potter in his bed. Taste Potter’s skin, his scar in his mouth. Taste that tingling golden heat. He shook the thoughts from his head and closed his eyes. It was the weekend. He was determined
Even after Cornelius retreated and left the ballroom, Harry didn’t let go.
Harry pressed two fingers between Draco's lips and Draco moaned, sucking them deeper into his mouth, running his tongue along the callused pads of Harry's fingertips. Harry trailed his wet fingers back down past Draco’s cock, over his bollocks, not stopping until they were pressed tightly against Draco’s puckered opening. He slid one finger gently into that tight heat and began to move in small, teasing circles. "Harry," Draco groaned again.
. Oh Merlin, what had he gotten himself into? He knew he had to move. He knew he had to get off of this train and move forward to meet the house elf at the base of Hogwarts, just like the note attached to the owl had said. Most professors arrived at least a week before the students arrived, but Draco’s research had gone on just long enough to obligate him to return with the students. And now he was unexpectedly petrified.
Potter finally scooted back until he was sitting at the edge of the bed, allowing one foot to dangle toward the floor. They were both still wearing their shoes. “What’s wrong? Is it too fast? It’s too fast, isn’t it?" Draco almost laughed. He'd wanted some version of this for twenty years. It was

“Ah right, yes of course. Well, it’s good to meet a fellow Slyth. And um, I suppose if you’re speaking to Potter, you could put in a word. But don’t say I put you up to it!”
Potter was laughing too. “Is that so?”

beside him and yearns to reach his hand out to Potter.
When Draco arrived at antenatal class the following week, Potter was already in the room and chatting animatedly to Neil and Langston. Langston cut quite a swashbuckling figure in a billowy white shirt and knee high leather boots, and Draco didn’t miss Potter surreptitiously glancing at the bit of chest hair on display as he talked. Draco remembered that both Potter and Langston worked at the Ministry; Langston was on the Invisibility Task Force, and Potter trained Aurors. And thinking of work, Draco realised he

he tried to cry, in reflexive response, but all he could manage was a rough rasping noise.
Madam Kite adjusted a few spells and said, “Right, I need to go do my rounds. There’s a buzzer there you can use to summon me if his condition changes.”
"Noooo," she wails. "I- We were- She was

Potter’s friend. If only he’d known at age eleven that a small bit of humility and caring (especially when it came to Potter’s friends) and a few apologies over a hot meal were all it took.
"What?" said Draco. "Harry?" And he'd never heard his name in those breathy cut-glass tones before.
"Yes to both," Harry replied flatly, realising too late that he probably sounded a little more brusque than strictly necessary. "Sorry, jetlag," he added after a breath.
I’d still be stuck.
"You said so!" He frowns. "Didn't you?"
"No, you complete git. We can't let people see. So only when no one's looking."
I pull the rope tight. I fucking hate Potter. And I intend to hurt him.
Draco couldn’t help the broken whimper that left his throat. Because that was all he’d wanted, that day eight months ago when he’d broken the news to his boyfriend. He’d just wanted Gabe to be there for him. But he’d lost the plot at Draco, and buggered off, the coward, and Draco had been alone all this time, unloved.
"Excellent, thank you, Janky. Give my regards to Mother, will you, and tell her I'll be around for tea next Saturday."
"I suppose I may have been a little more uppity than strictly necessary," Hestia ventured.
In the summer Draco started sewing the costumes. But at the beginning of July he fell ill, and when he hadn't improved after a few days Harry essentially strong-armed him to St Mungo’s, where he was informed by Healer Patil that he was four weeks pregnant. It was wonderful news of course, at least that’s what Draco realised once he'd had a dose of stomach-calming potion, and naturally Harry was overjoyed.
“Maybe we’ll both be DILFs, eh?”
Then they're pressed together again, warm chest to warm chest, their hands questing, wandering, caressing. And when their hands knock into each other, without hesitation their fingers interlace, and a white-hot burst of want fuels Draco to pull Potter backwards onto the bed, and they fall, Potter on top of him, his mouth pressed into Draco's hair. "Wanted you for so long, Malfoy. Don't fucking stop."
daughter on the other hand would be pretty like me.”
As they kissed, Potter’s fingers trailed down over Draco’s throat to the open neck of his wrap shirt, dipping his thumb to caress the hollow of his throat. Then he bent and placed a lingering, wet kiss there, and Draco sank his fingers into Potter’s messy hair and moaned.
A forceful knocking stopped his wild thoughts suddenly. "Who's there?" he shouted, trying his best to keep the shake from his voice. He could hear multiple voices outside.
Draco couldn’t let that happen. He had worked way too hard to have it all ruined with one bad review.
Potter-Malfoy. That was just bloody rude."
Before drifting off, Harry lazily mumbled, “You’re beautiful, Draco. Can't wait until we can fuck properly.”
wasn't the word he would have used.
"C'mon, let's go to the party," Teddy begged. "Victoire said they've hired a photographer, and it'd be cool to get a photo of us all in our Peter Pan outfits."
“Well, I just wondered who the father is?” Draco gestured unnecessarily at Potter’s belly.
"Yes, yes, I'm awful." Draco wiggled his fingers dismissively in the air. "Bye-bye now."
When Potter returned to their shared desk, Draco stood up and fixed Potter's collar where he'd jostled it askew. His fingers connected with the hot skin of Potter's neck, still pink with scratch marks, and Draco felt a sharp bite of pain. It was that strange, electrical zap again—a singularly unique feeling, Draco thought, and one that he'd only experienced once prior to this week (that time when he'd had to deliver a sparking hairdryer to the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office; some idiot had tried to charm it to cut hair at the same time as drying it). In any case, Potter had just looked at him gratefully and then, without a single word, sat down at his desk to fill out the paperwork for the case.
Cannons and Harpies pennants above the fireplace, a strange shard of broken mirror on the mantelpiece and a mid-play chess game on the coffee table alongside what looked like a stack of library books. A corkboard in the kitchen was littered with pinned takeaway flyers and concert tickets and photos of Weasleys, and he even recognised a few of young Teddy too. More photos and knick-knacks adorned the fridge. The place was cluttered, which was unsurprising to Draco. But something was odd.

fashion it was exactly the wrong hot bloke. He put the folder aside and unpacked his things, then changed into some clean clothes.
"Where the devil have you been?" asked Draco. "We've been frantic!"
Draco nodded, although he was doubtful that a bottle of Brunello was going to make up for years of cruelty. He wasn’t silly enough to think that his tormenting wouldn’t have hurt Potter—if he closed his eyes he could still hear the sickening crunch of nasal cartilage, and he winced when he recalled all he’d said about Potter’s deceased parents. He was already trying to think of ways he could avoid showing his face to Potter, because Draco might be fooling most of the world with his bit of facial hair, but he knew Potter would recognise him straightaway.
Draco cleared his throat. “Oh. Well, alright then. And you also look well. Quite radiant, actually.”
If that wasn't bad enough, after lunch Draco was talking with Finnigan and Goldstein, brainstorming tactics for an upcoming raid. Potter was putting the finishing touches on their notes to see Joanna released from custody. He looked over at Potter for a moment, only to be met with dark green eyes, a longing stare and a rather hungry smirk. His stomach swooped suddenly when Potter winked at him. But they were being watched. Finnigan, the prat, snorted and shook his head. Goldstein, the ultimate tosser, wolf-whistled and waggled his eyebrows.
And then Draco felt Potter swivel his arm very slowly within Draco's grip, and Draco looked down at where he was touching Potter. Potter's palm was facing up now, and he uncurled his fingers until his palm was flat, open. A question? A challenge? An offer? Draco wasn't sure. His pulse thudded in his ears, almost drowning out the throb of the music. He looked up from their hands, at Potter, and his breath caught at the fervent expression on his face.
but my number one enemy. You'll have to get to the back of the queue for that, behind me for a start, then my job and my boss, then Hermione for booking me on the itinerary from hell—"
sort of guy. It's just…" He shrugged. "I dunno. Okay, I'll stay on track. Sex? I'm off it for life. Never doing that again. Never, never, never. Had my fair share and look where it got me." And to Draco's astonishment, Potter pulled his t-shirt right up, exposing an expanse of shiny bronze skin, with a thick line of dark hair along his linea nigra, all the way from his protruding belly button down, and down, and disappearing under the waistband of his black leggings. Draco’s mouth instantly became wet with saliva; this was exactly what he meant about men in stretchy sporting attire. "Dangerous business," Potter added, and gave the hair on his belly a good scratch for a moment before covering up again.
“So, you’re here alone?” Potter mused. “Is there, um, anyone…”
"Just water?" he asked. "You're a cheap date."
"Baby coming," she said knowledgeably.
If he was honest, moments after the fact, Draco
“I do apologise. I’ll make sure not to tell anyone else.”

.” He wasn’t sure why but he felt shy saying ‘Harry’ even though he’d just come all over him. ”But I’m completely shattered. Limp as a noodle. Feel free to continue…”—he gestured down at Harry’s tented joggers—“...against me.”
The fogginess lifts from Draco's brain and he turns his head to see Potter’s wide eyes looking at him. Draco's stomach drops suddenly and sickeningly.
As Fordus described the various pain potions and charm options for labour, Draco thought some more about what Potter had said. If no one else had been able to help him with his Patronus charm up to this point, what difference could Potter possibly make? But at the same time, he
By the time the plane had skittered across the tarmac at Denpasar Airport, Harry was anything but relaxed. He'd ended up in an aisle seat on every flight. On the first leg of the journey he was put sitting next to a woman who insisted on telling him all about the romance novel she was writing, including detailed character arcs and complex side plots. She spent countless minutes lamenting the fact that she was stuck on how to end the story satisfactorily, however was unimpressed with Harry's neat suggestion of '

it felt like to Harry—and when the hard heavy trance beat finally kicked in he was completely gone, caught up in the collective rapture of the crowd, arms raised and jumping and utterly exultant.
——— [o] ———
“Well in that case, we better bloody win.” Potter grinned at him and Draco flushed with pleasure. "Just don't serve me up any of that hamper meat, ta very much."
Draco immediately threw his arms around Harry and hugged him. Tight but not

“I saw him holding your hand too the other day. I think you two are so lovely together. And it’s so adorable how you call each other by your surnames.”
"Open the sodding door, Potter," Malfoy cut across her.
“You’re a Slytherin? When were you at Hogwarts?”
And all night, Harry didn't hate himself.
“Uhhh,” Draco groaned. “Wow, that hurt.”

Right now, it's easy to admit what he wants.
"I don't
this?"
So he said, "Very well, Harry," and smiled, genuinely. "We'll see you when we see you. We'll probably be round at the Burrow by the time you get back." And he added, as he always did, "Feel free to follow us over." Though he knew Harry wouldn't.
James, Albus and Scorpius launched for the door, arms flailing as they elbowed each other out of the way, shouting after the Kneazles. Lily quickly untangled herself from the duvet and leapt up after them, enthusiastically shaking her tambourine as she went and shimmying to the beat.
"Of course," Malfoy said. “Of course you can. It is my name, after all.” He was rolling his eyes at Harry but blushing hard.
His knees buckled and he collapsed heavily sideways against the wall. Gabriel dropped the flowers and crouched down to take Draco in his arms.
Draco winced. Potter was right. “Yes, well. Point of clarification, I would probably have called you Scarhead, but yes, that does sound like me.” He paused, then added, “Sorry.” Potter just laughed, the soft-headed pillock, and Draco smiled back and realised he was getting a little bit fond of him.
The matron heaved a harried sigh, pursed her lips and said, “Alright then,” and Granger didn’t need to be told twice. She was over to Harry’s other side in a shot.
Posted: 2 August 2021
"Yeah," Draco smiled.
While relieving himself—and it was nerves as much as a constricted bladder—Draco tried to come up with a happy memory he could use. But he'd tried so many, he simply couldn't think of a new one. He shook himself off, tucked himself away and re-tied the drawstring on his tracksuit bottoms—he’d finally given in to slouchy joggers in the last few weeks, transfiguration spells on his normal jeans and trousers just weren't cutting it anymore. They'd inevitably be too uncomfortable, and he'd be forced to adjust the spell to loosen them, and then they'd slip down his hips as he walked. That and, well, he couldn’t see past his bump to button up trousers any longer; it was bad enough having to feel around for his dick when he needed a pee and then get the aim right.

And when he looked down at his hands after Potter had walked away, there it was, his hawthorn wand, a bit warm and a bit sticky, but his once more.
They wandered through bustling markets and quiet temples, hired scooters and rode up into the hills to see the waving rice terraces of Jatiluwih, lazed in the blazing sun eating pineapple on secluded beaches (luckily Malfoy had a salve for Harry's sunburnt nose) and cooled off in the sea at sunset. And they even danced until their feet ached in a ridiculously loud club, the lyrics of the ubiquitous dance tracks falling easily from their lips as they gyrated their hips and threw their arms in the air.

Potter grimaced and looked away.
"No, I wasn't." Gabe stood up and put an arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him close, then addressed Potter. "In fact, you can be the first to know. Draco and I are getting back together. We’re having a baby." He put his other hand on Draco’s stomach. “As you can see.”
"Oh, is that so?"
Harry could faintly make out Draco's voice shouting at him as he slid to the floor dragging several heavy tomes down with him. And, he thought dimly, if Draco had reverted to calling him 'Potter', he must be feeling scared too.
Of all the insolent—" Hestia spluttered, steam shooting from her spout.
Draco's heart raced. "Green eyes, yes. Ugly cap... strong possibility." Draco remembered Potter's atrocious dress sense from weekends at Hogwarts. You'd have thought someone raised by Muggles would know how to dress like one! And then Draco's heart clenched with guilt, remembering the rumours of the awful treatment he'd suffered as a small child.
Potter laughed and his belly jiggled against Draco’s. “Nah, I was

their dicks, never mind stick them in each other?"

were the ones going on this blasted holiday!
Draco tried several more times but it was no good. He loved that memory. He decided to be open with Potter.
Apparently, not only could your corporeal Patronus guard your baby from dangers while you were not in the room (Draco had already known that), but some bright wizarding parent had recently discovered that you could also use your Patronus in its non-corporeal form to calm and soothe a distressed or colicky baby, and it had apparently caught on like Fiendfyre in parent and baby circles. The misty Patronus form would surround the baby and imbue it with all the positive energy of the happy memory that created it. Potter had raised a dubious eyebrow at that, but Draco thought it sounded wonderful.
He wrote a reply inviting Potter over the following morning, and then focussed on cleaning the flat from top to bottom; even if it already looked tidier than Potter’s place as it was, Draco felt compelled to make sure everything was spick and span. No doubt the same instinct that saw him spending days and days turning the spare room into the perfect nursery, buying distressed-white furniture and using spells his mother had taught him to ensure everything was decorated just so. Nesting, Mother had called it, laughing, like Draco was a mama starling, but instead of using moss and feathers and leaves to line the nest, he was using knitted toys, and pastel cushions, and soft cotton blankets. Well, sod them all, it made him happy to do so.
Class on Friday morning was an uncomfortable affair. He and Potter were paired up again for an exercise, and Potter was acting cool and detached. Not unfriendly in any way, just polite and aloof, and that was almost worse than if Potter had been grumpy. Draco made an attempt to whisper to him that he was sorry and could explain, and Potter firmly whispered back, "Let's not, Malfoy." Potter went through the motions of bathing and drying the babydoll with Draco, and even engaged with him slightly gruffly on the topic of what potion to use on their delicate skin, but refused to hold any sort of eye contact.
Her mouth twitched at the side. "True. Harry was rather preoccupied with other things that year.”
Draco was feeling better already. This was a

Potter raised an eyebrow. "Never could pass up a chance to outdo me, could you? Your story of woe definitely wins hands down."
out," Draco said, cradling his belly. "And if you do, we'll manage. That's your decision." Draco could quite easily afford somewhere else, but he did love it here. It would be a shame to have to move.
"It most certainly is, Hestia," said Mrs Potts, her spout bobbing up and down in agreement. "Now, it won't have escaped your notice that
Draco was looking for Harry when he spotted it.
“He’s here! Chef Marco! The critic, he’s here. Table six.”
I never liked you.
Potter falls asleep on his side after a few minutes, and Draco stays staring resolutely at his notes for a while, trying to figure out why he feels apprehensive about resolving the mystery. Not to mention breaking the curse.
it would just be easier to let Draco make the tea in future. What he had with Draco was new and fragile, and he didn't want to risk it shattering over a ceramic teapot and a copper kettle.
A humongous grin burst across Harry’s face that he made no effort to hide, and he smoothed his palm across the swell of his stomach and said, "I'm having a baby," like it was the best thing in the world.
Streetlights began to wink out and a flaxen sun peeped between the gaps in the buildings, threatening to take over the whole city and flood it in buttery gold. Draco produced a pouch of tobacco, then rolled and lit a cigarette and passed it to Harry. He and Harry smoked the whole thing from the safety of their soft fabric cocoon. Each drag from the cigarette felt like inhaling fresh air. Harry's breaths were soft and smooth, and his body offered them no resistance. It was like he was actually breathing
Thankfully, Pineneedle seemed to realise that Draco was spiralling and hurried to the kitchen hearth to fire-call St Mungo's.
Harry chuckled as Draco passed the cigarette to him. He sort of loved the idea of witchy chambermaid Pansy, like a vampy Mary Poppins using her magic to tidy bedrooms. He took a drag.
"See that you do," Draco grinned.
“It looks amazing. So pretty.” Harry blushed, but couldn't stop himself from saying the thought that slipped into his head, soft as a whisper. “You could be a Veela.”
However. It
possibility. Why shouldn't they be in love? He tries to think about it logically. They spent years circling around each other through their schooling, Quidditch, Auror training and now as Auror Partners. So what if not all of it was friendly? Competition is a key ingredient for motivation, and they've certainly always been motivated to best each other, to seek each other out time and time again (even when life
Potter closed his eyes and groaned in pleasure, and Draco pulled him in sharply, and then they were neck to neck, chest to chest, their skin under their clothes yearning for more. The only parts that were exposed were their hands and their faces, and the burning there was worse than anything else. Draco slid his hand under Potter's collar, Potter's hands hiked up Draco's shirt to press at his hips, and that was it, that was it. Good Salazar, sweet relief, soothing and real.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut to concentrate. “
he now?"
"Oi, what the fuck, stop shaking me!" the ungrateful, if rather sexily-rumpled oaf groused.
She rolled her eyes. “What do you take me for? Salazar would turn in his tomb if I did something as gauche as that!”
Harry's breath was knocked clean out of him as he hit the ground, hard.
When they get to the Nevi-Wesh coven, one of the young wizards lets them in.
Draco waited until the judges had looked over their houses—Goldstein was being his usual pernickety self, poking at the lobelias in Draco’s hanging baskets and sniffing the rosemary and sage in the window boxes, while his Quick Quotes Quill made copious notes—and then he hurried to Potter’s side of the street.
. Then he sprawls out, starfish-like, and chuckles. Cold moonlight stripes his chest. Cold fingers reach into mine. And a little more of me fades. Magical dilution, Granger calls it.
"It appears to be— Well, clearly it's some sort of— The thing is—"
Draco runs his fingers over the book's embossed cover and blows the fine layer of dust away before opening it to the contents page. He scans until he finds what he's looking for:
“Absolutely not! My nerves couldn’t take it. I’ll be conjuring a Patronus every day to wrap around you and keep you out of harm’s way.”
But it was offset by the fact that Potter was scratching his neck so hard that Draco feared for the integrity of his epidermis. He could hear the
—cutting over the rhythmic pan-pipes and chants of '
“Yes, well-observed," Draco snapped. "I’m going to be a single parent. What of it?” Draco was trying to keep his voice calm but he felt something achey forming in his chest. “You’re alone too. I suppose your partner couldn’t make it today?”
Draco furrowed his brow and tried to focus on the discussion about healthy eating and exercise—and Fordus's impressive demo of yoga squats and lunges—instead of succumbing to his age-old hyperfixation on Potter. But it was rather difficult to concentrate with the tuts and sighs coming from behind his right shoulder. Merlin, what was Potter even doing here if he didn’t want to listen?
He'd been propping up the bar for a good half-hour, watching Ginny and Luna dance, checking out all the quite frankly

Harry spluttered. "That's daft. You're a kettle, and anyway, I'm the godson of Sirius Black."

"I'll tell you who's
Harry looked up at Draco, whose concerned expression had cleared, lips quirked up in amusement. He kissed one corner of Draco's mouth, and then the other. "Yep. A dastardly tickling overlord."
"Uh-huh."
They mumbled apologies, and Draco gave Potter a final look up and down before beginning the slow incremental turn back to face front, legs wide as he shuffled on his bum.
Draco goggled at Potter for a moment, and then began to laugh. And laugh. Kind of hysterically.
Draco put the finishing touches to the plates and picked them up, addressing Pineneedle, “I’ll take care of these, don’t worry. Maybe I can work out what game this Epicure wants to play, and what better way to do that than to serve him myself?”
Draco had to stop himself from letting out a breath of relief. He could absolutely do low-fat and high-carb and was already thinking of a few options. “Of course not," he said politely, a smile still on his face. "I'll have the waiter bring out an amended menu for Miss Chang to choose from. I'm certain there'll be something she'll like. I recommend the scallop and jewelweed risotto; we can prepare it with minimal parmesan and butter to lower the fat content. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
Harry had stayed up late after Draco went to bed, wanting to see the end of a 'Foil, Arms and Hog' sketch comedy special. He'd been to see the comedy trio live when he visited Dublin for Seamus's thirtieth birthday—
"Then the noise would alert the Magister."
Salazar, Draco thought, this was going to be excruciating.
"Not half." It was all making sense. Why his friends had got into it.

, some things just didn't bear thinking about.
Once they’d gained entry via the old Palladium Playhouse theatre, Harry discovered that Stasis was a rundown series of linked rooms leading to a cavernous dancefloor and stage with a patio in the back. The rooms seemed to have different themes, some with scissoring lasers and techno beats, some with black carpeting, mirrors and chillout music, another with giant balloons and circus-like decorations. Luna, who’d chattered about it non-stop on the Victoria line from Finsbury Park—why they couldn't have Apparated, Harry didn't know, but Luna insisted; something about the tube being 'part of the experience'—said the place was well-known for its friendly vibe, non-profit ethos, quirky performers, pyrotechnic shows, confetti drops, and best of all, free bananas at the end of the night,
"I know, I'm sorry. I freaked out. And not just at that part. I'm a
and moving at a different speed. Harry wasn't sure if it was the potion, he didn’t
And so Potter spent the next ten minutes elaborating on his strict agenda for each day as arranged by Granger, who was clearly determined to have Potter visit every possible place of interest on the island and have less than five minutes relaxation time a day. All throughout Draco laughed with Potter,
"The who?"
Draco braced himself by taking a gulp of air and then walked out of the kitchen, trying his best to look composed and professional instead of like someone about to walk to their death. He saw Potter waiting patiently at his table—alone, Chang seemed to have disappeared—and forced his legs to take him in the right direction.
After breakfast, Harry popped upstairs for a quick shower, and when he returned to the kitchen he found Draco cooing over his kettle, buffing her with a soft cloth, Hestia puffing steam gently out of her spout appreciatively, her copper gleaming. As he came closer, he realised Draco was whispering soothing words to the stuck-up kettle.
Potter lets out an audible sigh. It's been two whole days, after all.
“Have I told you both that I love you, like, so much?” Harry said. He felt like he could tell anyone anything, and all he had to share was joy.
When he and Harry arrived in the kitchen, it was to find Hestia and Mrs Potts at opposite ends of the worktop, handles facing each other, spouts raised haughtily, engaged in what could only be described as
Granger relayed the address to the cabbie through the window and then passed some Muggle money to Draco, wagging a finger at him. “Look after that idiot, will you. And yourself. I want to know the very

Draco supposed it had all started that first afternoon when Harry moved in. He'd been looking forward to it for days, ever since Harry agreed to his barmy suggestion, and had spent hours tidying up, cleaning and polishing, fluffing cushions, and making up the bed with the good linen. His house-keeping charms had never seen such a rigorous workout. Harry had only been over a handful of times, and he'd not done much looking around the place, in fact Draco's wasn't even sure they'd switched the lights on (Harry's Lumos was a powerful thing).
Rocking back on his haunches, Harry swivelled to see Draco sitting on the foot of his bed, smiling at him. He looked so fit in coral-pink shorts and a tight white t-shirt, and Harry could hardly believe that they were now on kissing terms.

something. To
“Unlikely,” Draco said, glancing at Fordus's expectant face. The man was strolling around the room, clearly planning to eavesdrop on all the conversations. He remembered his vow to himself, the one he repeated in his head every morning while doing his shaving charms—to do everything he could to ensure this baby had the best start in life. He couldn’t quite imagine how talking to Potter about sexual desire was going to help, though. Maybe he could speak to Fordus about it. Maybe he’d allow—

“Just admiring it, that’s all!”
"You can tell him," Potter says, the cowardly prick.
"Not exactly how it happened, Teddy,” Draco said, “but yes, your dad defeated the Dark wizard. And he was just as brave as your grandparents were. You should be very proud of all of them."
By the time he reached his flat on Brick Lane, he was feeling more positive. He did love his little flat. Well, it wasn’t really that little, and it wasn't really
But when an antiseptic-smelling Malfoy rode Harry’s cock wearing nothing but marigolds and a short pinny, the squeak of rubber glove over stiff nipple obscene in the sterile quiet, Harry gripped their freshly-laundered sheets and thanked Merlin, Morgana and Salazar himself that his boyfriend was a flagrant and unapologetic dust phobe.
It was mere hours after Draco and Harry had finally taken the step and moved in together, and they were still in the process of unshrinking trunks and unpacking boxes, when they got the Patronus that Aunt Andromeda had taken ill with an unusual virus. They rushed to St Mungo's of course, and after speaking to the Healers, they were quick to offer to babysit little Teddy while she was in hospital.
"Potter!
Because it’s not
For a split second nothing happened and Draco felt like he was going to be sick. But then a bright blue light surged out of his wand, brighter than any Lumos, and began to take shape.  It was a slim elegant dog, a greyhound he thought, actually maybe a bit smaller, more like a whippet. Either way, it was gorgeous.

“Nice hedges,” Draco called across the street. “Planning on trimming them any time this century?”
"Have you? Well, I hope you'll show a little more decorum than you did for Grand-mère Narcissa's birthday photograph!" Draco could still picture the constant loop of James pulling his t-shirt over his head and wiggling his belly at the camera.
Potter groaned and twitched his head upright, sputtering on shower water.
Today wasn’t turning out to be so terrible after all.
Harry’s thrusts became more erratic until he plunged forward and positively growled as he came, shuddering and panting above Draco as his thighs trembled. Harry's distracted hand momentarily stilled and Draco thrust into it until Harry began stroking again. Draco's hands dug into the sheets and his vision blurred as he came, fucking Harry's fist until his chest was streaked with white.
Draco sighed. "I’m starting to wonder if this entire research project has been an illusion. Maybe I was so desperate to find this thing that I was seeing clues where there were none. Maybe it really
“You found it then? The Fountain of Youth?” Harry ran his slippery fingers along Draco's arms.

? You perv."
It didn't stop Draco from thinking that Harry's silent treatment was a little ridiculous.
Draco had often eaten quite well in his travels, but nothing quite rivaled a Hogwarts meal. When the food appeared at his table, the first thing he reached for was a slice of shepherd’s pie. His fork sliced through the crust like air and it practically melted in his mouth. He swallowed it down with a full goblet of pumpkin juice.
Harry traced his fingers over Draco’s back in wide, lazy circles. Draco was drifting to sleep when he felt, as much as heard, Harry’s voice vibrating beneath him. “Why the bloody hell did we waste so many years fighting when we could have been doing
“Try me. You’ll be dead before your spell can fall.” With the hand in front of his chest, Draco signaled: One. Two.

never expected Harry to be so aware of his emotions at that age—so conflicted about Draco, even then, that he could be a mess of anger one moment and wanking to the thought of him the next.
“Malfoy? What’s happening?”
this, Malfoy?”
“Not another word, Potter. We’ll do it together.” Draco was right beside him now, whispering against Harry's ear and trying to resist the cold emptiness of the dementors that had already begun to seize him. “You know what I think about? When I cast mine?”
Harry almost laughed. “He’s just releasing the balls for us. He’s busy strategizing for another game.”
“For fuck’s sake, Potter, don’t. It’s--” Draco inhaled as Harry pressed his mouth against the scar at Draco’s shoulder, running his tongue along the long line of it, across Draco’s chest. Draco moaned and let his head fall back against the wall. Potter scooted down and began the second scar with his tongue, then pressed tickling kisses across his stomach to his ribs. Harry pulled Draco's shirt out of his trousers and threw it against the wall with a wet smack. He dug his fingers into the waistline of Draco’s trousers and pulled them down just enough to lick the scar from Draco’s naval to the top of his pelvis. Draco dug his knuckles into the tile floor, worried he might faint from how good it felt.
Draco shook his head. "I don't know. Maybe something else is at work. Some kind of bond."
Even though he wasn’t hungry, Draco found that he couldn’t refuse.
However, if he could enter Hogwarts on the premise of being a

"Want something, Draco?" Harry's sexy swaggering smile could fuck right off, as far as Draco was concerned. It was doing nothing but arouse Draco further, and Harry really didn't need any additional ways to torment him.
Granger sighed. “But you’re sure you’ll--?”
But he had a portkey in the morning.
“Do you think it’s possible then?” Potter breathed, as if afraid to even pose the question. “A new start? Maybe not as friends, but at least as...not enemies?”
Screw the fucking plan.

“Or incredibly prudish,” Harry laughed.
, all of a sudden. To feel so warm. To feel so protected, so cocooned by another person. By Potter, in particular. The thought terrified him. He pushed Potter off and scrambled out from underneath of him as if he were made of poison. “Trapped in a muddy pit with Harry Potter,” he said sourly, crawling back on his hands and knees and pushing himself back to his feet. “Just what I’ve always wanted.”
“I’m not talking about your bloody potion! I’m talking about

Draco cleared his throat. “Granger? You said--”
“What’s going on here?” Draco asked, standing tall and broadening his shoulders just a little as if he were a bear trying to intimidate an enemy. Or Professor Snape himself. Draco folded his arms over his chest, his wand clearly visible in his hand.
Draco’s eyes darted to a wrapped bar of soap on the sink, and he pointed to it. Potter squinted. Harry wasn’t wearing his glasses, and probably just saw blurs of white. As Potter leaned out of the shower toward the sink, the curtain shifted further away from his hip, revealing a sharp edge of dark curls. Draco charged into the bathroom in an instant, snatched the soap off of the sink, and handed it to Potter so that he wouldn’t move another millimetre away from that shower curtain. Draco made sure to
" he said, his voice strong and embedded with magic.  He thumped the tail end of the car with his wand and it shot to the roads—well, at least the lines on the maps.
"Someone gathered 'em. Someone who made promises." Duncan cleared his throat. "Promises that were sweet but turned sour when broke."
"Song," the fairy interjected.  "She likes songs."  He eyed the three men, his gaze flashing from one to the next.
Harry reached out to the dip of Draco's back and pressed all five fingers into the pool of oil.  The prone man twitched.
He walked up the three steps to the front door, which was painted a deep blue, and leaned over to peek into the plate glass window.  The curtains were closed.  He glanced over his shoulder and saw Dog Man watching him, thumbs hooked into his hip pockets.  Nosy neighbors.  Nosy damned country.  Draco waved, then lifted his hand and knocked.
The assembled coven and guests aligned themselves along the edge of the large protection circle. Positioned in the centre were the three artefact pieces locked within the blood basalt cage, a black monolith, its presence looming over them. Huge pillar candles provided scant illumination, washing the room in a sickly green light.
"Potter," he said.
pot and everything else he would need for the ritual.  He scribbled a quick note out for Hermione and left with the rewritten ritual tightly gripped in one hand.
Snape groaned low, an animalistic tone of need, and Harry pulled his eyes away from Draco's stretched lips and that line of cock appearing and disappearing, to look up at his ex-Professor.  His head was thrown back and his back was bent deep.  He was gripping Draco's hair as he began to tilt his hips sharply, fucking Draco's mouth.
"Yes, Mrs. Malfoy," Harry said as he walked forward and awkwardly took her hands in his and kissed her on the cheek.  His belly caused him to lean forward too far and he almost overbalanced.  "Everything is fine… we were just… Well, I was just hoping to talk to you about a few things.  About being a parent, raising a child…"
Harry watched him, letting Snape file through his gamut of magic.  "While you do make a pretty picture all trussed up, I bet you have a nasty neck kink," Harry said to Draco.
Draco tried to watch Potter battle the dark prince, whose eyes glowed in the faint light, but Draco could not meet the fevered pace.  His opponent blipped, skipping space between one step to the next.  Draco targeted him, but missed in those the in-between places.  He felt useless.  Potter fought; Draco flinched at each clash and
Crap! Harry closed his eyes and tried to build up those barriers within him, remembering those long ago lessons with Snape that had never made any sense. He brought up the image of a younger version of himself and Draco as he knew him now, having a quiet, civilized conversation within him building a mental wall together. He focused on the heavy feeling and added his power to it, though it strangled him to do so.

should be the one to flirt with Potter at the pub. In public. Where people could see. Still, he was suddenly nervous and excited all at once.
“It looks pretty,” she said, admiring its transparent lavender colour.
Potters? Bloody hell, Potter and Female Weasley had been busy, hadn’t they? The real question was: had they shagged immediately after the war, or before?
Draco carried Harry through the changing room and into a shower cubicle. He knelt as he set Potter down onto the white tile and blasted the shower water, allowing the hot stream to soak them both. He reached down to unbutton Potter’s robes, fingers still numb and clumsy, and pulled Potter to a seated position. Draco sat behind Harry and leaned Harry back against his knees. He peeled Potter's robe, which still hadn’t regained any heat even in the hot shower water, down his arms and flapped it, wet and heavy, onto the tile floor. He unbuttoned Potter’s shirt without bothering to untuck it. He scooted back until he was sitting against the rear shower wall and pulled Potter between his legs, allowing Potter’s back to fall against his chest. He wove a hand beneath Potter’s unbuttoned shirt and rubbed his chest, spreading his fingers through a thin layer of dark hair, trying to warm Potter from the core. He willed that tingling golden heat to come back. “Please, Potter,” he whispered. “Please.” Draco pressed his lips to Potter’s cheek and closed his eyes. There it was, that impossible warmth, coursing through his hand and tingling though his lips even though no potion could possibly be causing it. Draco pulled Harry’s shirt partly down Harry's arms and then ripped his own shirt open wide beneath his braces so that he could press part of his bare chest to Potter’s back. He wrapped his hands around Potter’s chest again and pressed his lips against Harry's neck, moving until his mouth found Potter’s pulse. He closed his eyes again and willed that golden heat to pulse between their bare skin, willed it into Potter’s veins, willed it to flush the darkness and the sorrow and the cold emptiness of the dementor's attempted kiss away. This was
“Easy?!” Potter clenched his fist and flailed. As if unable to decide if he wanted to punch Draco in the face or shove him in the chest or shoulder, Potter’s fist landed in between, just beneath Draco’s left collarbone.
Potter was gaping at him. “He tortured you. Fuck. Of course he did. Malfoy, if I could go back and kill him twice, I—”
it, Potter. Like you feel a Patronus. Like you feel a broom.” Before Draco could consider the consequences, he tapped his bare, uncovered wrist to Harry's for just the briefest surge of golden light. "Like you feel
After a Friday class in late September, Draco decided it was time to start searching for the Potions Storage Library. He went back to the dungeon trapdoor and opened it without any interference from a particular Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. When he reached the bottom of the narrow stone steps, he cast a Lumos spell, but the darkness around him was so intense that it hardly did any good. “Lox!” Draco cast into the room, and five small balls of white light, each blazing like an afternoon sun, flew from the tip of his wand toward the ceiling, illuminating the entire room. This spell would have been very convenient when he had last explored the dungeons as a boy, he thought. Now, this spell was one of his staples. He didn’t know how he could have explored any tombs without it.
“I believe we’re going to get started,” Granger began. She began listing general announcements: an update on House Points and a generous donation given to the school from a former student.
Draco and Harry were completely alone. The silence was palpable as Draco fully surveyed the room with dread.
he could cast an expelliarmus. Then he saw James' eyes flicker in recognition, and knew his message had been delivered.
“You were here, weren’t you? Watching him.”
Draco ate a quick meal and went back to his rooms, where Healer Victoria had kindly agreed to meet him and assist with his experiments. She thought his rooms were a good choice because they were comfortable and in a safe part of the castle near other employees.
Draco rolled onto his back to catch his breath, stretching one leg flat while the other bent at the knee.
“No.”
When Draco wasn’t on the battlements, he continued exploring the dungeons with the assistance of spells and maps.
“Oh good! I can’t wait until we are discovered and murdered like fish in a barrel.”
Potter stared at him thoughtfully, shaking his head. “No, Ron and I have both dealt with love potion before, I don’t think that--”
“I was actually thinking,” James lowered his voice. “Can a Death Eater even
does it work?" Draco flipped through photograph after photograph, re-examining each one. "Why? Even if this is an accurate interpretation, I still need to figure out the significance of it, determine what that means for us, confirm if there’s a way to harness that power to heal anyone else, and...”
Draco focused. He focused very,
He pushed Potter’s pants and trousers to the tops of his thighs, watching over Harry’s shoulder to see his cock spring free. And Harry was just as goddamned gorgeous there as he was everywhere else. Draco slid his fingers down through the mass of dark curls, down to cup Harry’s testicles, running his thumb over the sensitive flesh and listening to Harry moan. He trailed his fingers lightly around the head of Harry’s cock before bringing it firmly into his hand. He began to stroke again, slow and a little uneven, until Harry was breathless and whimpering. He increased his pace a little, using his free hand to scrape up Harry’s neck, into his hair and back down to wrap around Harry's chest.
“Of course I hate you! The war’s over for you, while I’m still stuck in--”
Harry had already shown him so much more, had opened up an entire

“Sorry I’m late,” Potter said quietly as he pulled out a Muggle notepad and quill. “Lily broke her arm during Quidditch practice.”
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispered, pulling at Draco’s lower lip with his teeth and then smoothing the sting with his tongue. “I’ve

“Anyway. So many people would come up to Harry when we went out to the pub that we decided to turn it into something of a game. After that, it became an amusing little ritual. Every time someone hits on Harry at the pub, everyone does a shot. Amusing for us, lightens an awkward situation for Harry, a win-win for everyone. Now cheers.”
said that second half aloud.
.” Potter’s voice sounded strained, like he was struggling to find the balance between casual friendship and genuine concern.
Potter. Harry. Ever since Draco had tapped into his emotions to produce a Patronus, his mind had darted between the two names. Each name triggered such a feeling of fondness, even though Harry was undeniably being a complete arsehole. Well. His reasoning was almost understandable, but
“So what happens now?” Harry asked.
“For about fifteen glorious years, in fact. Let’s go back to that, shall we?”
“Mmm,” The corner of Potter’s mouth curved into a smile. “A bit.” Potter’s voice was filled with--well,
“What the fuck!” Draco felt a possessive fury boiling in him; it was so unexpected that, had he been standing, he might have fallen over. He didn’t know he was even capable of feeling such a thing. For Potter, no less.
Draco walked, aimless and invisible, through the Hogwarts halls for most of the afternoon.
They were silent for a long time, just listening to each other breathe.
After his final class had finished, Draco packed his clothes and research supplies. He didn't own very much; it made traveling easier. Well, he
. Potter, the bloody idiot, was stepping out of the closet right behind him, looking furious. The student blinked in surprise, and then practically ran down the hall, clutching her books to her chest. Soon the entire school would be gossiping about Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, hiding in closets with Harry Potter, saviour of the Wizarding World.

Once back in the safety of his rooms, Draco took a closer look at his surroundings.

Draco folded his hand over Harry’s on the hawthorn wand
When Harry slid his mouth back to the tip, added suction, and moved back down again, Draco fell completely back against the tile, the thin pool of water splashing beneath his weight as his strength left him. Harry moved up again and swirled his tongue around the tip of his cock, gently kissing and sucking. Then Harry pushed forward and nearly swallowed Draco’s cock whole.
“So far I have surmised that doors--at random--will lead to this room. And the doors currently closed in this room never lead to where they’re supposed to. The other doors leading here, though, I really don’t understand. It doesn’t make much sense. I asked A...a student last night what they were thinking about when they opened the door that led here, and they said they were going to try to get a student to stop snoring. No active spells. Nothing.”
. So much for a relaxing holiday.
how guests and suitors of the head of house should be treated, as if she was some un-seasoned young kettle straight off the coppersmith's workbench who had seen neither scratch nor tarnish.
And Potter didn't know it, but that simple request for Draco to help him, that mere hand-hold, that implication of trust and the obvious desire to have Draco accompany Potter each remaining day of his holiday, it
And that's that. The curse is gone.
"I'm not sure, Potter," he flung back. "At least mine doesn't end with me displaying my prime assets in all their glory to my number one enemy."
Over time ‘Potter’ became ‘Harry’. And it wasn't some dramatic meaningful moment of
“Just needs to be a single moment of pure joy. Surely you must have at least one of those. You were a pampered brat.”
But even as he said the incantation he knew—it wasn't going to work. And he was right. Not even a hiss this time. He felt tears well in his eyes. Merlin curse these baby hormones, he never usually cried over anything. And then, as always, came the guilt for thinking ill about his pregnancy.
"I'll need to take a few days off work," Draco rushed to say, sensing Potter was beginning to spiral. He might be off his broom agreeing to this… but Potter's little speech had touched a soft, vulnerable part of him. "Siti will have my nuts of course, but fuck her, I haven't taken time off in ages. And really, it's an emergency, anyone can see that. It's my civic duty as a fellow Brit."
"One would think it was your glasses you mislaid, then, and not your wand."

She furrowed her brow. “I thought you two were getting on famously. He told me last week he’d put your name down as his emergency contact on his birth plan.”
“Anyway, the neighbour was able to cast Bluebell Flames at the plant's roots and it shrank back. Good thing Mr Potter got knocked out really, as it meant he didn't struggle and tighten the vines around him. Plus the poison has strong hallucinogenic properties so he’s better off tucked up here in bed than wandering around the neighbourhood thinking he’s Emeric the Evil.”
“Merlin, you’re so soft,” Harry found himself saying as his hand brushed against Draco’s for the umpteenth time.

He’d have much rather Apparated, but of course that wasn’t a possibility; that sort of magical travel—Apparating, Flooing, broom-flying and Portkeying—had sadly been off the cards for the past ten weeks. So instead he was forced to dodge out of the way of Muggles on their way to Pret for almond croissants or Greggs for bacon rolls. He’d glamoured his large belly of course. (Merlin, could you imagine the threat to the Statute if a Muggle spotted a thirty-two week pregnant man?) But the bump was very much there, despite its invisibleness, and Draco could very much feel it, even if it did look like a trim, flat stomach right at that particular moment.

"I meant the curse. It should be gone now, so we don't need to hold hands and hug and all that." He's looking at Draco strangely.
Draco couldn’t help but grumble when Potter stopped rubbing, but it was swiftly cut off as Potter’s nimble fingers returned and they felt slicker—he’d conjured some scented oil; Draco’s expert nose could detect sweet almond and ylang ylang—and when Potter found a particularly tender spot in right in the arch of his foot, Draco groaned as knots of tension left his body.
“Fist fight a Dementor, eh? Pansy, that was pathetic, even for you.”
“Right," Draco sighed. "I can’t argue with that logic, I suppose.” He greeted the three men and took his seat.
“Why did he have Devil’s Snare in his garden at all?” she said. “It’s not a common garden plant. It's so dangerous. I don’t get it.”
"I wasn't thinking anything. Though now you say it, if I was him, I suppose I'd like to know. But… it's your body. Your choice. You chose to have this baby, but you could have just as easily chosen not to go through with the pregnancy, and he'd have been none the wiser."
"Alright, Potter," Draco said, after a sip of his drink. "Let's pretend for a moment that I am indeed as nosy as you."
Much as he would like to.

. He caught himself subconsciously squirming his hips into the mattress in an effort to get more comfortable, but he managed to cease the motion.
someone he wanted to see. To talk to.
“My cat, Potter, well... Mother’s cat now, which is for the best all round. It’s a long story and I don’t like talking about it. What I’m trying to say is—”
They began walking. Draco wasn’t sure whether to make a bit of small talk or just dive right in. Before he could decide, Potter took a deep breath, and Draco could feel the tiredness in his sigh. “I’m sorry,” he said.
And yet, the absolute best thing in the world.

, it didn’t make it any easier seeing Father being dragged out of the room by two burly Aurors, or hearing Mother sobbing into the lace-trimmed and monogrammed handkerchief Draco had made for her last birthday, plangent and shocking. He’d never ever seen his mother cry before.
"Including cursing their room so that they'd experience increasing degrees of pain each time they touched?"
Draco got on with preparing on table four’s order of grilled Plimpy, stuffing it with fennel, moly leaves and coriander and rubbing the skin with a toasted fire-seed and lemon zest mixture, when Pineneedle came back in the kitchen, looking as if he had bad news.
The problem was, it didn't simmer down.
"—he grins and jabs at his own chest, and Harry cackles—"that it could be used therapeutically by Mind Healers. Particularly for post-traumatic stress disorders! Which, as you'll no doubt agree, quite a few people could find useful."
The world around him became realer and he clutched at Draco’s hand, unsure how to navigate this new state of play. Draco bobbed through the crowd, pulling Harry behind him, through a corridor and into the foyer.
Harry wants to stay and be supportive and console the team, but he can't, not with this dizzying pain in his heart. The twist in his chest worsens on his broom ride home; he has no more cards to play, rules are rules. It still hurts like hell.
"Right, well." Draco pours tea into two china cups, and it's the perfect dark gold colour. "
"What the fuck?"
“It does look like you’ll need to practise that one a little more, Draco,” Fordus said in a kindly encouraging tone, which Draco hated too. Though it caused Potter to remove his hand, so that was something. “Don’t forget to think of your happiest memory!” Draco tried to smile and nod, though it can’t have looked natural with his jaw clenched so tight.
"You think it should be legalised?" Harry says.
Potter's pressing short pants into Draco's mouth, and then he's whispering, "Draco, oh my god, oh fucking hell, oh
He laid Potter flat and quietly slipped across to his own bed for some much needed sleep.
"Good point, 'Mione." Ron was nodding. "Harry hasn't had his leg over in what now, thirteen months?"
and that's far too strange for this hour of the evening.
Harry looked out at the dancefloor again and actually thought about dancing. Wondered if perhaps it would be alright to move his body with the beat for a bit. He pushed into the crowd, merging with the many-headed horde, his limbs feeling loose, like he’d just been for a long run or had vigorous sex, though there hadn’t been many instances of either for a long time. The press of bodies against him didn’t panic him like he imagined it would. There was none of the claustrophobia he normally felt. He was calm, so calm, and found he enjoyed every bit of contact whether accidental or intentional. He was one unremarkable person in a sea of glitter, sweat, and skin.
"Yes," Draco replied. "Do you know what else feels extremely pleasant?" He straddled the bench they were sitting on. "You face away from me. I'll give you a massage."
Shouted,
“That's so great that it worked out for them. They seem like such a lovely couple. I do hope we stay in touch with them after this.”
He was in the kitchen preparing one of his famous deconstructed Bicorn Wellingtons when one of the waiters, Pineneedle (first name Ernest; Draco had never kicked the habit of using surnames, and secretly it made him feel like Snape to address his underlings in this way), came running into the kitchen out of breath.
of the holiday dance music that seemed to be a constant presence here, and the roar of the waves which seemed to bring a swell of laughter and noise with each rush up the sand. The warm breeze blew in over his face and body, and within seconds he felt hot and sweaty again.
unlike him.
Potter stopped and looked back at Draco, and a flicker of hope eddied through him. "There are some flowers on the floor out here," Potter said, voice flat. "See you at class, I suppose," and then he was gone.
Pansy crouched to put her shoes on. "Better go. Got work at seven," she said.
? Why, I— Of all the—" Mrs Potts pointed her spout at Hestia. "The brewing stage is paramount, and the way it's done has a key bearing on the flavour profile—"
They're not boyfriends.
The next morning, Draco woke to a fire-call from Pansy warning him that the judges had arrived at their street.
Draco gasped again, shocked, and whispered back, “You… you don’t know who impregnated you? Weren’t you
“Yes. We told you about that before, Jamie. Does that make you sad?”
"Potter! Malfoy! As you're insistent on disturbing the meeting with your fidgeting and grunting, you can excuse yourselves and wait for me in my office, where I
, sulking over his lacklustre cuppa, Draco decided that something had to be done (and it was patently clear that Harry wasn't planning to be the bigger person), so as he vanished the tea leaves from the pan and cups—Merlin, they got everywhere; teabags were so much more sensible—he broke their impasse by suggesting they search the cottage for their missing possessions.
Fordus had charmed a baby-doll to cry and fuss, and the group watched while Neil cast a perfect wispy Patronus over the doll which curled around its tiny torso and the doll quietened within seconds. Bloody show-off, Draco thought.

was bigger than his fear of drugs, and it wasn't like he would overdose and die from one shot of it, especially if Neville had a hand in making it. Neville had a gift for that sort of thing. Maybe Harry should just listen to Ginny and loopy fucking Luna; he’d already followed them to the club—in for a Knut, in for a Galleon, he supposed.
Which Potter undoubtedly did.
"You leave us no choice." A pause. "Father... do your worst."
Harry struggled against the restraints, causing his captors to laugh, hysterical and high pitched.

, Pansy called them, whatever that meant), they didn't ever question it.
And before he knew it, Potter was crowding him back against the counter, and Draco let him, and he found that his fingers were grasping at the belt loops of Potter’s jeggings to pull him closer, although it wasn’t easy to get as close as he’d like what with two Bludger-sized bellies in the way. But they found an angle that worked and then the air between them just seemed to disappear, and once their mouths came together it was effortless.
"The Indonesian police, Potter."
"Let me see."
Two days passed, and Draco was trying valiantly to put that disaster of a day behind him and to not worry. He hadn’t heard any news of Chang’s fate, and there hadn’t been so much as a whisper about Floyd’s in
“Does that mean you’ll go out with me now that you don’t need to worry about corrupting me in my line of work?” Potter asked, interrupting Draco’s train of thought.

That may not have been obvious from the frown on his face as he hurried along Cheapside, trying to avoid stepping in puddles in his good Vans (the ones Gabe had customised for him with the black and white checkerboard and green apple print) or indeed bumping into passers-by, which was easier said than done when he was sporting a baby bump the size of a watermelon.
Draco nodded, thinking it a slightly odd comment for a food expert, and muttered "Indeed." He walked as steadily as he could back to the kitchen, feeling rather proud of how he'd handled the interaction. He was glad too that Chang didn't have some unusual allergy to something that was present in every dish. At least he would avoid getting points deducted for
"Father said it was your
As they wrangled the children into their jackets and shoes, Harry caught Draco’s eye with a wave of his hand. Draco looked up from where he was tying Lily’s shoelaces.
Harry's cheeks burned with shame recalling Malfoy's horrified expression when he'd realised it was Harry. Harry, lying half-naked with a raging hard-on. A hard-on that was solely due to Malfoy's wicked hands on his body. Not wicked, Harry chided himself, but wickedly good. There was something different about the way Malfoy looked now: standing tall and purposeful, despite how unnerved he must have been to see Harry lying in front of him. His skin had a light tan, and his slightly windblown hair shone in the sunlight. He looked good.
He walked out of the kitchen and towards table six, the one Pineneedle had said Epicure was sitting at. But Draco stopped short a quarter of the way there when he spotted a familiar someone with messy black hair.
"It's fucking torture," Potter spits. "I should know. Your
for him, for as long as he could remember. Even as a boy, she'd patiently guided him through the process of making tea for his mother, being ever so careful not to let him burn himself.
"Your lips," Harry murmured into Draco’s warm breaths, "taste like fruit."
Draco stopped walking. “Potter.”
"No, go on. I like it."
be all that keen on a Wizarding decree forcing me to massage every single pregnant person’s feet, if I’m honest,” Potter laughed. He pressed his thumbs into the balls of Draco’s feet eliciting a hum of pleasure. “I am lucky my feet don’t get overly swollen. It’s the one symptom I seem to have avoided. I got all the rest though. Langston was saying today that heartburn during pregnancy means the baby will be born with hair. If that’s the case I think I’ll be giving birth to a puffskein. And Merlin, I had
and I have made some tea," Draco corrected himself.
After a moment of silence, Draco raised his wand and tapped the door several times, muttering as he did so. A series of knocking sounds came from within the cellar, and the door creaked open at last.
“I’ll reimburse you,” Draco blurted when he saw Potter the following day.

"Well, chaps," Draco crowed. "What do you think?"
There are notes too, some no more than scraps of paper. Notes sent to each other.
"I know, I know. Can't blame a bloke for trying though."
They’d got separated from each other at Portobello Road Market. Draco had meandered off while Harry haggled over some pewter teapot he didn't need, and when Draco wandered back he was gone. But Draco wasn’t concerned—his Sight told him he'd find Harry in approximately ten minutes near a stall selling bric-a-brac, though Draco was a bit fuzzy about what the stall would look like. Hence he didn’t hurry as worked his way through the crowd, peering over the tops of people's heads looking for the stall and ultimately his boyfriend.
