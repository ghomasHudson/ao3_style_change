The ‘silver’ signet ring was another favourite and led to the most discussion. The band was covered in small stars, the crest itself showed a howling wolf against a round shield, beneath were two cross plumes of flowers. I had looked brand new when it was gifted, and clearly was still well looked after, “I see my Aunt explained where it should be worn, but I assume she didn’t explain the significance?”
“That’s just it, though,” said Draco. “Most of the night I’ve been thinking how nice it would be if I didn’t have to hide, if Pansy just knew I liked men and was fine with it, like I know she will be. She’s already told me she wouldn’t mind if her own son was gay. I know she would be supportive of me, if not surprised. And yes, there are other old schoolmates of mine here who I’ve known a painfully long time, so they would find out too. But if they didn’t approve, I wouldn’t care, honestly. Pansy would give them a talking to and put them in line anyway.”
a shield, but it wouldn’t be the same as a shield charm. Accidental and wandless magic is harder to control. That’s why we use wands in the first place.”
“I’m sure you do,” said Harry. “But then a substitute comes along and behaves in such a way that threatens that. I know you can’t have complete control over the way another person behaves, but I’d like to think that you’ve set a standard of behavior for your substitutes.”
A small sound in the doorway had Draco turning his head. Harry stood there, watching him, his expression one of concern.
“Yeah, well, I know what I like,” said Harry. It was true that his CD collection wasn’t large, but it was well curated.
“Lovely,” said Draco, feeling even more sorry he had asked. He had no interest in hearing about other people’s happy marriages or plans to start families. Potter had probably married the Weasley girl and had a couple of brats of his own, come to think of it. Draco had always assumed that was what would happen, not that he’d paid much attention to whether it did.
“To me that seems suited for when you have a bride and a groom. There’s not going to be a bride in this wedding.”
“It’s not against the rules,” Harry told him. “The law says that two men or two women can get married, so it’s perfectly within the rules.”
That led, inevitably, to some recounting of adventures, which Harry and Ron always liked to do and which their audience usually found entertaining. Hermione occasionally added details but otherwise let them regale Hannah and the Slytherins with tales of their daring rescue of Ginny from the Chamber of Secrets, the night of revelations in the Shrieking Shack third year, and all those times in the Forbidden Forest with centaurs, acromantula, a baby giant, and many others.
Teddy didn’t need telling twice, it seemed. He quickly removed his little jacket and handed it off to Harry unceremoniously before following Ron further into the house. Harry chuckled.
. She wouldn’t tell us what happened, except that you two had broken up, and you weren’t there. You were just gone. You left us to deal with it, and she won’t talk.”
. After all, if our future is together, and we really do move in together, and get married, and have children, they’re going to have a field day every time we take a new step in our relationship. There will always be questions, and they will always write stories. Maybe it’s time I accept that, and actually try to shape the story.”
“Kids get a bit of it at Hogwarts, of course, since students come from many different backgrounds,” said Harry. “But I think it gets limited sometimes because of how we sort students into houses. They can be very insular, sometimes, and the rivalries between houses can become pretty toxic. I’ve learned that since living in the 8
“Yes, I am. I was looking forward to getting some real time with him. We barely see each other as it is, since he works every weekday, plus some weekends, and I work… well whenever I’m told to, as you well know.”
“Oh, don’t play coy with me, Draco. I already know you have your very own Gryffindor you’re spending time with at least once a week.”
He really hated it. But he also knew that time and patience was the only thing that made it better. His divorce had taught him that.
“Oh, Gods, I hope not. I mean, I want her to move on and all, but I was perfectly happy when we were both pretending like the other didn’t exist. That worked quite nicely for me.”
Her bra would be next, but she paused. He was coming closer, she could sense it. He was maybe only a couple of feet away.
“So, this is new for him, me having a boyfriend. But he loves meeting new people and he’s very comfortable with adults. And he wants me to be happy.”
“Oh, Draco!” The need in Potter’s voice was its own aphrodisiac, and so Draco did it again, grinding himself against Potter with abandon and eliciting an actual whimper from the Gryffindor.
Pleasure surged in his cock as he pictured Foster on his knees, expertly swallowing Potter’s large erection. He pumped harder as he remembered the way Potter’s sculpted arse had flexed with each thrust, pushing that cock deep inside. He felt his orgasm build as he remembered Potter’s words.
“Do you mean to tell me that you and Longbottom have been together for four years now and you’ve never had a proper fight?” Pansy asked, aghast.
Draco looked at him sideways, a small, sly twitch to his lips. “I’m sure I can think of a few ways. I do believe another… distraction is in order, don’t you?”
“I’m sure you did,” said Harry, giving him another kiss. “And did you get what you needed out of it?”
Lindsey was quiet again, but she no longer looked angry or hurt, and that was something, at least. “I never thought about it that way.”
The rest of the memory proceeded as it had before. Vesper did her best to try and pay attention to things she hadn’t been before, but didn’t catch anything new. Before she knew it Eamon was getting knocked unconscious again and they were being kicked out of the memory once more.
Vesper nodded. “Well…” She sighed heavily. “There’s something I’ve been keeping from Blaise because it’s better if he doesn’t know. I genuinely think it wouldn’t do any good for him to know. I want to spare him pain. So I’m choosing not to tell him. But…” She glanced away, across the room. “It’s messing with my head a little, right now. I just don’t think I’m ready to…  I don’t know. I don’t know how to be with him and not tell him. So I’m choosing to not be with him, at least until I can figure that part out. I need to be able to be done with… the secret, let it be really dead and buried, before I can be with him again. I know how it sounds,” she added, when Hermione didn’t reply right away. “I know what you think I should do. But trust me when I say it’s more complicated than that.”
The problem was, Draco seemed to vanish completely after breakfast. Harry had it in mind to follow the Slytherin out of the Great Hall and try to catch him once he was alone. But he had been distracted by Ron, who had reminded him that he needed to speak with McGonagall about giving up the captaincy, a task that Harry had all but forgotten about in the wake of his unexpected tryst with Draco after the party. Knowing he should get it over with, he approached the staff table and had what he had hoped would be a quick chat with the headmistress about the change. Naturally, though, she had questions aplenty, and by the time the conversation was over and the issue settled, many of the students had already cleared out for breakfast, including Draco.
She stared at the necklace silently for a good ten seconds. It was a Black family heirloom, one of the many that Harry had inherited: a large emerald and amethyst pendant on a woven white gold chain. The appraiser he had hired to take a look at the piece had valued it at over 50,000 galleons. Still, Harry had no qualms about giving it to Narcissa. It felt more like it belonged to her than to him in the first place.
“Maybe someday, things will be different,” she said, “and we can think about getting back together.”
But another part of him (the part that sounded the most like himself) suspected that he wouldn’t be able to follow through. There was a chance that, when the time came, he wouldn’t be able to perform, and that would only pile more humiliation on top of what he’d already experienced. It wasn’t just sex he was worried about either. He was worried that he wouldn’t be able to connect, that he wouldn’t be able to meet her where she was, emotionally or physically. He wasn’t sure he had it in him to even try.
“Maybe,” said Harry. “Maybe she believes she can convince him to accept you. She is essentially asking for time to do just that.”
“Hey,” he said, turning to the culprit in annoyance. It didn’t take long to figure out that it was Angelina, just by the look on her face. “We’re having a conversation here.”
No one seemed to mind, greeting him with hugs and handshakes. Harry leaned down to give Septima Vector a kiss on the cheek, and she asked him with a wink what lucky young man he had been so caught up with as to make himself late.
“Yeah,” Teddy said, sounding a little subdued. “Nana got me these new crayons and when I color with them in my coloring book it makes the pictures come alive.”
No, it was hardly bursting with excessive adoration or rhapsodies of the depth of his love, but this was Blaise. She would hardly expect it to be.
“I will never break your heart, Draco,” Harry said, with such sober honesty that it calmed Draco almost immediately. “I couldn’t bear it. I couldn’t bear being without you.”
“No,” Harry said. “Although I will admit I don’t usually like the idea of anyone else getting to be that close to you.”
Draco didn’t say anything or move for a moment. Finally, though, he turned over onto his back, blinked a few times, and looked at Harry, registering the serious expression on the Gryffindor’s face. He stilled. “What is it?”
After a minute, or perhaps an eternity, Clint began to move. It was the smallest of thrusts, like a rock forward, and Kyle met him there, already panting. Clint continued in this vein, his thrusts minute but still so deep, making the pleasure build inside Kyle bit by bit.
“Miss McNeal, would you be so kind as to stay behind a moment?” Draco asked of the small, sandy-haired witch who’d sat in the front row for every single one of his classes so far.
“I’d never thought I’d feel this level of sympathy for Malfoy,” Hermione said finally. “But I find I do really feel for him.”
“You know we’re not out for you, Edmund. We want the inner circle. We want the manufacturers. You know who they are. You give them to me, right now, and I’ll see to it you barely spend any time in Azkaban.”
“Yeah, actually,” Harry answered, rubbing the back of his neck. He needed a distraction, something physical he could do to take his mind off things. “If you think you can use me.”
so she could see better, but knew it would be pointless. Such magic didn’t work inside a pensieve memory. She would only be able to see as well as Eamon Parrish himself did, which meant the room would remain dark, at least for now.
“Would you like the two links to be identical, or would you like them to be different?” Mr. Greenslade asked him.
“But I didn’t know where you were. I had no way to…” Draco visibly shivered, and Harry reached out automatically to run a hand up Draco’s shoulder and down his back, trying to warm him and comfort him at the same time. “You can’t do that to me, Harry. I don’t do well with leaving things unresolved like that, not knowing when they will be worked out.”
“I enjoyed it more back when we were at Hogwarts, the chaos of the Weasleys. Now I like smaller celebrations. Ron, Hermione, and I usually slip out after the early supper, grab a drink together. Though, this time, Hermione was just sipping pumpkin juice, given that she’s expecting in May.”
“How would you have felt if something had happened to Draco during the war? You didn’t love him yet. Would you have felt something, do you think, if he had died?”
Draco considered that. “I don’t know about that. I tend to think you’re better off doing things in your own time, they way
. More than I ever thought I could love someone.” She looked at him again, and his eyes were wet. She could feel that hers were the same. Because this was the really hard part. “A man I’m not sure I really deserve.”
“It’s not his fault. There was no indication that Astoria would betray me like this. It was no one’s fault but hers.”
It's the final chapter! I sort of can't believe it. It's been a very emotional ride, actually, sharing this with all of you. I know many of you have had strong feelings about how this story unfolded, both positive and negative. I can only hope that in the end, you like the way it turned out.
Ron pressed close to her once more, a hand tangling in her hair as he ravished her mouth. Hermione was just starting to melt into it when he pulled away with a groan.
she whispered, and the lamps in the room flickered to life. She put her wand back on the table, then knelt before him, unabashed in her nakedness and staring at him with an expression of concern. “I’m trying to understand what you’re saying, Harry.”
Harry didn’t care about him, per se, but he just had to make sure that Draco wasn’t summoning demons in Hogwarts basement, or something. He really didn’t care, at all.
After Harry had encountered three Ravenclaws intimidating Draco, he had sworn to protect the Slytherin, who was permitted of using his wand outside of class not even for self-defense. Days after the incident Harry followed him around and after a while Draco just muffled “Bloody Potter” and accepted that he couldn’t go anywhere without Harry or him already being there, their sleeping situation did not help Draco at all.
He was eleven years old when he first met Harry Potter, the boy who lived. In Draco’s eyes he was glowing, almost as bright as Death did herself.
Draco thought they had something in common, even though he had never told anyone, he wanted Harry to be the first one to know.
Draco knows he had been selfish and a brat and that he could just have asked for forgiveness and a new chance, they were kids after all. But instead, he was rude to everyone that didn’t necessary benefit him and so the years went by while Draco secretly slipped glances at Harry, when the other wasn’t looking.
“Good,” Vesper said, meaning it. She liked McInerney already. She’d always been drawn to fervent, committed people, probably because she considered herself among their number. “I’ll take another lesson whenever you’re ready.”
Harry was relaxed and ready for him, and Draco was able to sheath himself fully with ease. He paused there, though, as usual, partially for Harry to adjust but also for himself. It felt
He had arrived by now. She could hear the quiet shuffling of his feet on the carpet. But he was lingering just outside, hesitant, maybe, or something else. Maybe just watching.
Draco found himself raising a shaking hand, his heart pounding in his chest. Iwu locked eyes with him. “Malfoy,” she said.
Those slim fingers were undoing more buttons, but Draco let it happen, ghosting his lips over the other man’s. A tongue flicked out and licked at Draco’s bottom lip, making Draco shiver in surprise, or perhaps pleasure. A greedy hand was running over his stomach, and he reveled in that touch, even though the hands were bigger and a little rougher than he was used to.
“You never know, though. It could move again, if you give it some time.” It was as though she felt a need to reassure him, which struck Draco as odd. Of course, he supposed he did sound rather sad, didn’t he?
He was rewarded for the compliment by a deepening of Malfoy’s blush. The blond smiled and looked away. “Well, what are you going to do now?”
Draco chuckled too, then kissed him again. “I’d say we should shag our troubles away instead, but we don’t have the time.”
Hermione breathed a sigh of relief, before she was overtaken by a frisson of what she thought might be self-loathing. She knew who she was really trying to protect by asking: herself. She swallowed it down, though, knowing she had no choice.
The prospect of seeing Teddy and Andromeda cheered Harry considerably, and he found it easier to be his usual self that night as he and Draco found themselves in the lab again, treating the dried Agama skin in preparation for their second brewing attempt in Potions the next day. Their first experiment had been an unmitigated failure; the transfigured rat they had tested it on had had a violent seizure within minutes of them administering the potion, and then died quite suddenly. It had been disappointing, but Draco had seemed undeterred. He was much more optimistic about the Agama skin.
“Yeah, well…” Harry had no good answer for that. “I know we did. But I’ve just… been wondering… Haven’t you… Don’t you ever wonder…?”
“Of course,” said Naomi, ever the pragmatist. “I told you the day I offered you the job that your name recognition was an asset I intended to exploit. Don’t go getting squeamish on me now.”
“Might be a bit of a losing battle,” Draco said, though this didn’t much bother him. He would simply change before his patrol. “Haven’t you ever tried scourgifying semen from fabric? It never works.”
“Why don’t you tell us the situation,” Draco said, with what he thought was quite a lot of patience, “and we’ll decide how big of a deal it is.”
“Good morning, Ms. Granger,” Bulstrode said, her tone professional and respectful, as though the two women had no history at all. “Thank you for coming in. Won’t you have a seat?”
years, as well as Ron, Hermione, and Professor Sprout, who had apparently come along behind them to chaperone.
His voice was neutral, free of pain, so how was it that he could still make her feel guilty, just by looking at her like that?
Harry licked and kissed his neck, then pulled out slowly. Pushing back in caused both men to moan, and Harry did it again, still achingly slow.
Mila nodded, lying down and lifting her shirt to expose her stomach. Draco glanced briefly at Lorenz, wondering if Mila would be more comfortable without her there. But, as the girl had said nothing, and seemed to mostly be ignoring the woman, Draco left it alone and instead pulled out his wand to cast the necessary charms.
He was thin, even thinner than Draco, and not at all like the very muscular bloke that Draco had been with most recently. But that was all right. There was a kind of masculine elegance to the sinewy lines of his prominent ribs that Draco found both unexpected and arousing. He bent his head in appreciation and flicked his tongue out to sample one of Kyle’s pebbled nipples. The brunet writhed invitingly, making Draco smile against his skin as he took the nub into his mouth and sucked.
That wasn’t the line he was focusing on now. Instead he was looking at the golden one that connected Harry to Teddy, the one that made it clear that they were as good as father and son.
“Right, well… they attacked us during the retreat. I don’t know how they found us; we were in the middle of nowhere, protective wards all around…”
“I was told they would be ready by 1,” Draco said. “I dropped them off first thing this morning and was told that if I came back at 1, they would be ready for me.”
But if there was one thing in this world that made Harry less afraid, it was being with Draco, near him, buried in him.
“I don’t see why I have to pursue anyone,” Draco argued. “Shouldn’t I be learning how to be happy alone?” He knew he'd had this same argument with Severus only a few nights previously, but he was feeling stubborn.
“You, on your bed, completely bare and spread for me. Your cock on my tongue. You coming, crying my name.”
Had she screwed up here? Her heart was still hammering so hard she could hear it in her ears, a combination of adrenaline and residual anger making her twitchy. She had done what she had to do, hadn’t she? She
“So you’re going to blame me if this all falls through?” he asked the blond with the raise of an eyebrow.
“Why didn’t Shacklebolt run for reelection?” Kyle asked. “I’ve heard him mentioned multiple times, and only good things about him, too.”
When the kitchen was clean it was only a few minutes until eleven, and Harry was wondering what was taking so long.
“Love,” Ron interrupted her. “You don’t have to sell me on it. I won’t go out into the field again, I promise. Not until I know it’s safe for me. Or for my arm, at least.”
Once all the trainees had gathered in the dueling room, Ron picked out which pairs would duel first. He usually only had two or three pairs duel at a time, so that the others had the benefit of watching and observing technique.
“I don’t know what to think, Harry,” Ron told him as they made their way to another Quidditch practice Sunday afternoon. “Hermione’s being so analytical about it all. She comes to me yesterday with a list of reasons that we should be together. An actual bloody
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “Because even though you don’t like Ron, you can somehow tell that I…” She trailed off, bringing her thumb to her mouth and biting the nail, suddenly deep in thought.
“Like ice cream,” said the brunet, sitting up. “I always like eating ice cream after sex. I don’t know why. I just get a craving.”
Draco gave him a sheepish grin and took another sip of wine. Apparently the alcohol was making him a bit honest. “It’s only that I don’t know anyone except Harry, so I had no idea what to expect.”
They went quickly, as agreed, though the passage was narrow and Scorpius wanted to be very careful to not bump into the walls on either side, lest he take some of the persistent mold with him out of the passage. It was a real pain to try to get off of a cloak or shirt, even with magic.
Harry had decided to go with the master duelist. He thought it was most in line with his talents, but also that he could learn a great deal. A close second had been the Diaphone Thickett Foundation, which focused on Muggleborn rights and helping those of Muggle parentage integrate effectively into wizarding society. It was a worthy cause, and he liked the sound of the kind of work they did, but he was still uneasy about getting too politically involved, and had decided against taking an internship there.
“Perfect,” said Draco. He led Narcissa outside, his hand resting on the small of her back, leaving Harry alone with Andromeda.
Harry nodded as he took that in, bringing his firewhiskey to his lips again. He was surprised by how much Luna’s experience was similar to his own in many respects. He had gone back and forth about becoming an Auror, then gone back and forth about wanting to teach, and it had all been a lot of vacillation and ambivalence until the job offer from Naomi had come out of the blue when he wasn’t even looking for it. “It’s amazing how the answer is right in front of you, sometimes,” he said, “and you don’t even realize it.”
Potter laughed and leaned towards him, answering in a low voice. “They don’t have any idea what that is, you know. They think it’s just a normal tattoo.”
With a heavy sigh she let the bird in, and the owl hooted softly at her in greeting and recognition.
“All you just said, about how I need to be a hero to be happy. I don’t think any of that is true. But you want it to be true. You
“Politics have changed,” said Hermione. “And I definitely think the population boom has had something to do with it.” She nodded at Hannah.
Draco stared at him, wondering if Potter was mocking him. It seemed like he wasn’t, but he obviously wasn’t keen on helping Draco either. “Fine,” he said, and turned towards the door.
Clint nodded back, beginning to scissor his fingers and increase the burn. His mouth didn’t go back around Kyle’s erection again, but rather started teasing it with his lips and tongue. Kyle had the urge to whine at first, wanting those wonderful sensations again. But he soon realized what Clint was doing. He was keeping him from coming too soon, instead stoking the fire so he would want to take more and more of Clint inside him. The burn was already dissipating, giving way to familiar fullness and the sharp pleasure of the occasional brush to his prostate, and he knew he was ready for a third finger.
“I agree,” said Declan, and Vesper found her gaze flicking to him sharply. Her heart pounded painfully in her chest as she saw him regard her for a moment with an impassive expression. “I have a lot of the same questions, and basically no answers. I thought maybe that was because I’m new to this, but…” He gave an apologetic smile to the room at large. “It seems to me all of us are out of our depth here. Auror Kemp is right; we need some expert help.”
“She was the inspiration, in a sense,” Draco said. “At least in that I felt I had denied you a Tuscan holiday this summer, and I wanted to make it up to you. I know it’s not exactly the same, but…”
The theory was further confirmed when Ron turned to give Harry a hug in greeting, his shirt riding up enough to reveal a patch of mottled flesh just above his hip.
She was so ready for him that as he pushed himself inside it was nothing but pure pleasure. They both moaned in mutual gratification as he bottomed out inside her, his pelvis right against hers. She felt unbelievably full, but it was exactly what she had been craving, and she threw her head back, arching against him. He took this as permission to move, sliding out of her and then back in, slowly at first. But as she moaned and dug her heels into his arse he picked up the pace, panting harshly against her neck.
He heard Draco chuckle at that, his voice going back to dark and commanding one he had been using most of the night. “Such a good boy,” he said. “Look at how well you take it. I can’t wait to be inside you.”
“Ah, now we arrive at our favorite part of the evening,” said Harry. “If you’ll excuse me.” He stood and made his way around the table to where Draco sat. He placed his hands on his boyfriend’s shoulders and bent down to whisper something in his ear, making the blond’s face split into a wide grin. He stood, taking Harry’s hand as they made their way to the dance floor. Hermione looked on with warmth surging through her, wondering when the two of them, who had been so clearly and unwaveringly in love since the start of their relationship, were finally going to get around to tying the knot.
He just didn’t want to have any illusions. He didn’t want to get lost in fantasies, lying in bed at night, of Draco miraculously realizing that beautiful, famous sex gods weren’t actually his type after all and that the only person he ever truly cared about in this cold, cruel world was Kyle Bergeron (Kyle’s fantasies had, he could admit, an annoying tendency to slip into the realm of melodramatic if he let them). He didn’t want to hang onto feelings for a man who was in love with someone else, no matter how great that man happened to be.
“Shin. Moto. Purr.” The voice was soft, her lips barely moving, as though what she was saying was more to herself than to her daughter. Hermione nodded anyway, as if she understood, and clasped her hand around her mother’s.
“Yes, but someday you will be able to do them. And sometimes it’s nice to wait for things. Sometimes good things are even better because we waited for them.”
"Obviously you and your fiancé ought to do what you feel is right," Goddard went on. "However, I can tell you from experience, having watched the loved ones of my patients wrestle with similar questions..." He sighed. "It tends to be best, I've found, for loved ones to continue to live their lives, to visit and provide support when they can but not put their lives on indefinite hold. It's a long road, sometimes, Ms. Granger, and sometimes waiting means waiting a long time. I have no doubt that your parents would not want you to build your life or your future entirely around their recovery." She met his eyes, then, and saw the earnest concern there. "It's just something for you to think about," he added.
“She was waiting for me in the common room when I got back from practice,” he said, still pacing. “I could just tell, the look on her face… but I didn’t know it had anything to do with Zabini, not until she pulled me upstairs and told me…” He stopped, turned, and looked at Harry. “Apparently Zabini’s had his eye on Hermione for a while.” He snorted. “I mean, can you fucking believe it? A Slytherin?”
As he listened Draco was struck suddenly by how similar Harry and Teddy were, at least when it came to the way they related to other people. Their natural inclination was to put others first and to think of their feelings as secondary. For a long time now Draco had been wondering if Harry was the way he was because of his Muggle relatives, because they had raised him to believe he wasn’t as important, that he didn’t deserve to have the same things others did. Maybe he’d had those ideas beaten into him so much that they became a part of who he was. That had always been Draco’s theory, anyway, though it was one he never intended to share with Harry.
That was met with silence. Vesper peeked under her eyelashes and saw that Declan was staring at the floor. She couldn’t read his face.
“It was. Although it still seemed… newer then, I suppose, fresh. You could tell which parts had been rebuilt. Now the castle seems like it’s old self.”
After a couple of glasses of wine, he decided it didn’t matter. Conversation flowed easily, and it was the lighthearted kind. In such circumstances, it was not a trial to participate, and the three others were always happy to provide Draco with ample context when it delved into something related to the Golden Trio’s history. Hermione especially was good with keeping them on topic, making sure Draco was never left out for long. They deftly skirted anything that would bring up painful memories, which Draco was grateful for.
Dad-Harry readily accepted the offer, setting Scorpius up next to Marissa at the island with a cutting board and a knife. Scorpius nudged his sister with an elbow, and she nudged him right back (as this was the normal way they greeted each other, most of the time). Then Scorpius set to slicing the carrots that Marissa had just peeled, while Dad-Draco and Lily hung around at the kitchen table so they could all have a chat.
“Not that I’m rushing you, of course,” Audrey said, glancing up at her with an amused smile. “It’s just that time seems to have flown by, between my first meeting Percy and now. It doesn’t seem all that long ago.”
His hand still gripping and stroking, he climbed onto his bed. He stayed on his knees, holding onto the headboard for balance, and began to find a rhythm.
“I suppose I just wanted to say goodbye before I go,” Draco said. “It… seemed wrong to just go without saying goodbye.”
“A while ago, but not recently. I’ve been a bit bombarded. Everyone wanting to catch up now I’m attending public events again.”
“Yes. Because the world isn’t some giant chess board. People don’t all follow the same rules, or think in the same way, or even think at
Draco reached out for her hand, and she took it. “It’s not selfish,” he said. “You love him, and you’ve taken such good care of him. You just want the best for him, and for a long time the best place for him was with you. It’s hard to imagine anything else. I understand that. But the most important thing for you right now is to have the time and the means of getting better, of letting the treatment really work. The best thing you can do for Teddy is give yourself that really good year, so that you can really be with him, not overwork yourself by taking care of him all the time.” He squeezed her hand. “Harry and I will take him. We’re ready.” He realized it was unfair, speaking for Harry when Harry actually had no idea any of this was going on, but he was sure what he was saying was right.
“I’m the same way,” Clint said. “And I figured you’d warm up to all of us eventually. I wasn’t too worried about that. I was just curious about you. And then we had that meeting, where you were officially introduced and Rosemary gave that presentation about lab procedures, which she said we all needed to be reminded of, and since you were new, we may as well do it all at once.”
“Rub it in, why don’t you?” Vesper grumbled good-naturedly. Then she gave him a soft smile. “In all seriousness, I’m really happy for you. Seeing you two together… it gives me hope, I guess. I’ve dated some real jerk-offs in my time. The guy I dated in school turned out to be one of the worst, in fact. But there are good ones out there.”
Ron, clearly tired of the barrier in between them, removed her shirt with a deft yank, leaving her completely naked. His mouth immediately found one of her nipples, and she threw her head back, crying out in approval as he licked, sucked, and gently nibbled on one breast and then the other, just how she liked it.
Ron scowled. “It’s more difficult than it sounds, you know. I mean, isn’t that why you’re going to visit Malfoy after Christmas? You can’t go two whole weeks either.”
They stared at each other for a moment, neither moving nor speaking. Harry could feel his heartbeat in his ears, adrenaline coursing through him that nearly masked the twisting pain in his gut.
Thankfully they did grow bored of the game after a little while, and focus turned back to drinking and loud conversation. Vesper let herself relax, joining in only when she felt like it, but otherwise just listening. Most of the trainees had known each other for years, of course, having all been together at Hogwarts around the same time, and they had all sorts of inside jokes funny anecdotes about each other.
years still live with their houses. I suppose the headmistress doesn’t want them stumbling in drunk and setting a bad example for the younger students.”
He surely would know that she was livid, that she held him responsible. But she didn’t yet know how much he cared about that. She’d always found the man difficult to read. When it became clear that Ron would be an invaluable Auror in the Corps, Robards was very effusive about him, and there was a lot of talk about making sure to keep him happy, help him advance in his career, and all the normal things a boss says about one of their favorite employees. By all appearances Robards was very fond of Ron. But with his injury the first time Hermione started to see the way that fondness would only stretch so far – namely, only as far as Ron was useful to him. And that bothered Hermione immensely. Robards’ Aurors were not merely pieces on a chess board. They were human beings, too.
afford them,” said Ron. “I checked the finances before I bought them, don’t worry. With my bonus from last year, plus the compensation for my injury, it was actually quite doable.”
Draco was just finishing his toast when the owl post arrived the following morning. He knew immediately something was wrong just from the look on Nixie’s face alone when she came to deliver the small stack to him.
Something, though, was poking around the edges, trying to penetrate, and he couldn’t figure out what it was.
“As much as he was able to understand of it, anyway,” said Harry. He approached Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. “Will you tell me the rest?”
“I have, Healer Malfoy,” the woman said in her slightly croaky voice. “Though I’m struggling to understand how this could have happened.”
The first couple of hours didn’t prove to be very productive, despite his intentions, and Angelina’s distracting chatter, while usually welcome, only served to grate on him. He was starting to develop a headache. Pinching the bridge of his nose did only a little to help, but it was something.
Apparently the experience had been a positive one, because Harry continued to go back to Molly for lessons every now and then, learning more difficult recipes like the genoise they were making now.
“Yeah, but you’re forgetting that I also blew up my Aunt Marge once when she made me really angry. And I used to shatter and break things with my magic if I got upset. That wasn’t out of necessity. That was just… I don’t know… energy coming out of me, I guess.”
“Pansy, always the voyeur,” said Zabini. He turned to her. “Why don’t you actually tell them what you’ve found?”
“It always tickles a bit,” he explained. “But that’s how you know you did it right. Now you can conjure the lube, and push one finger inside me.”
Their eyes locked and Harry immediately smiled at him with that all-too-familiar warmth in his eyes. Draco had no choice but to smile back. He saw Harry bite his lip, his gaze raking Draco’s body briefly, and the blond knew exactly what the other man was thinking about. He twisted his smile into a knowing smirk. Harry met his eyes again, somehow managing to look both sheepish and lustful at the same time.
They sat in silence, watching the lake, noticing that more and more students were gathering around it as they finished their exams and chose to enjoy the beautiful day. Harry was surprised that Blaise chose to remain with him, rather than move on to other things, but he didn’t mind. The Slytherin had a calming presence that made him easy to adjust to. He lay down on the blanket again, eventually, and closed his eyes, content to let the afternoon drift away.
“Maybe,” Draco said. He thought back to that moment and decided that yes, it had been brave of him. “She had Octavian with her. Her son. Blaise’s son.”
Potter pulled away to look at him, and Draco got the first glimpse of just how much this was affecting Potter too, how blown wide his pupils were, how red his lips. It spurred Draco on, crowding out any doubt that remained.
Draco laughed. “I could tell that much at least. I assume that was what all the teasing was about regarding the cake? That seemed of particular interest to you.”
that? It was like lightning had struck him, right in the center of his body, and then zipped through the rest of him. But it was
She gave him one final, embarrassed smile, then turned to go. Draco sat back down in his chair, aware that he was grinning.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” Slughorn said affectionately. “An excellent example to us all. Well, go on, the rest of you. Partner up.”
“He disagrees,” Mac said mildly. “As he must, I suppose, if he’s going to continue to deny any wrongdoing on the part of the Aurors at the end of the war. To acknowledge we’re a specific target means acknowledging the Adders’ motives, which would point the finger back at us. And he can’t do any of that so openly.”
“You didn’t,” Harry said, surprising him. “I haven’t handled… well…” He didn’t seem to know where he was going with that, because he didn’t finish the thought. “It will be all right,” he said instead. “We’ll figure it out.”
He turned to go, making his way to the nearest staircase and beginning his descent. He had to move a bit faster now, with time running out, not that he was particularly worried about getting in trouble if he was a few minutes late.
He laid out the blanket on the grass and he and Draco sat, discussing Teddy and what a wonderful kid he was.
“Besides, I know they’re more than just cufflinks. I know what they mean. I know now how long you… wanted this. Us. They tell me that you really thought about this and that you’ve been ready for a long time.”
Draco extracted his hand from Harry, conjuring more lube. Harry rolled over onto his stomach, presenting his beautiful arse to Draco like an offering. Draco pumped his cock gently, not wanting to stimulate it too much. The sight of Harry ready and waiting for him was already a bit much to bear.
“Thank you, Miss McNeal,” Draco said, warmth filling him. “Coming from you, that means quite a lot.”
“Astoria and I got divorced,” he began, finally, his face still hidden, “because she was sleeping with my best friend behind my back for the entirety of our marriage.”
Draco opened one eye to look at him. “Yes, all right,” he admitted finally. “That was bloody fantastic. I suppose at this point that I have no good reason to doubt you anymore.”
The headmistress nodded, clearly satisfied with the answer, and reached down to open a drawer in her desk. With some difficulty she pulled out a large stack of parchment, placing it on the desk between the two of them with a thunk that rattled the teacups.
He finished dressing and told the man that yes, he could see himself out. Jim/John didn’t bother asking Draco for his mobile number or offering up his own, the way some others did, and Draco appreciated that. The man was savvy, at least. Not unintelligent. He was even funny and well-spoken. Any man would consider himself lucky to wind up in his bed. Draco knew that.
“All right,” said Harry, feeling that still wasn’t much information to report back to his boyfriend. “So what did you… how did you feel about him?”
“So you’ll just go along feeling like he asks too much of you but never say anything? Harry, I thought you wanted a
They all did: Harry, Draco, Pansy, Theo, Hermione, Ron… they all wanted to know. But neither Blaise nor Vesper ever said what it was that had broken them up. Just one day, they were over. They never even indicated who had ended it. It was just… finished.
Madam Le Roux finished pinning the bust of Hermione’s gown and the brunette was allowed to move her head and neck again as the tailor set to draping the skirt. Hermione glanced to her left, where Vesper stood on another platform, enduring her own fitting for her silver “groomsmaid” gown.
, when he spoke about you, about your relationship. It was such a gift, I couldn’t very well resent that it was someone we’d happened to have a difficult history with. It was a long time ago, Ron and I both decided, and if you were willing to move forward, and if you could make Harry happy, then, well… we would embrace it.”
Teddy thought it was all very funny, and Harry seemed amused as well, though he was watching Draco in that knowing way he sometimes did, possibly suspecting that listening to stories about himself was not his favorite activity.
The Gryffindor wasn’t in his quarters. Or, at the very least, he wasn’t answering the door. Draco had a momentary panic before he decided he ought to check the Defense classroom, just in case.
They went back to their shield practice, and Scorpius and Draco returned their attention to their work once more, at least until the lamps starting flickering on and off for a good ten seconds, an indication that Lily was still seething in her room and not having a very good time with the maths. Her accidental magic could still rear its head when she was especially angry.
“I don’t think I like this one as much as the first one,” Draco remarked, snuggling in closer to Harry’s side on the sofa.
It wasn’t nearly as blatant as that first day, at dinner, when Harry barely acknowledged Draco’s presence. But it was obvious to Draco. He saw it every day. He watched for it, to see if Harry would finally manage to make eye contact. He didn’t.
On the other hand, he was rather enjoying the crackling tension in the room, the thick anticipation in the air, and so he took his time, coming around the desk with slow, steady steps and stopping in front of the chair where Potter still sat, unmoving. Draco leaned forward, placing a hand on each of the armrests, his face only inches from Potter’s. His eyes raked Potter’s face, taking in every delectable detail, deciding how he wanted to approach this.
At the moment, though, Lindsey was being chatted up by some good-looking cousin of Theo’s, and Kyle got the impression, based on the big doe eyes she was giving the wizard, that she wouldn’t want to be interrupted. And Pansy and Theo had been in the main parlor all night, talking to Harry Potter, Draco ever by his side.
Harry tracked him down while Draco was on his way to lunch. One moment Draco was walking along, considering the project he’d just assigned to his 5th years in preparation for their OWLs at the end of the term, when he felt a gentle hand on his back and another on his arm, guiding him out of the corridor and into an empty classroom.
Lights flashed overhead, and the bass boomed, and some Muggle girl sang about wanting the DJ to turn the music up, but all of that was background to the way Rick moved against him, felt against him. He even
Draco groaned in response and pulled Harry’s face back for a kiss. Things were already heating up, and Harry decided it was time to get out of the bath.
in the world? It was the sort of thing I only dreamed of as a child. Something I had hoped was true. To find out it was real… Well, honestly, I thought he was joking at first. But he brought me to visit Harry. I met Kreacher, and saw all those moving photographs hanging in the hallway, and after dinner Harry even cast a spell and had the cutlery do a little song and dance for me right there on the table.” She laughed delightedly. “It was amazing. I knew it couldn’t possibly be a hoax.”
He was as grateful to Draco as he was exasperated by him, though, when it came to the Potions exams. He found, thanks to his boyfriend’s ongoing guidance throughout the school year, that he knew much more than he had expected on the written exam, and the Veritaserum he had to brew for the practical had come out looking just about perfect. He walked away feeling he’d easily accomplished an Exceeds Expectations, which was the best he could have hoped for. He gave Draco some extra special attention that night, to convey his gratitude.
“Here you are, Teddy,” Harry said as they entered the bedroom, which was right down the hall from Harry and Draco’s master suite. “Now, I know you’ve slept here loads of times before, but if there’s anything you want to change, just say the word, and we’ll transfigure it for you, all right? We can even change the color of the walls, if you want.”
“You have a very interesting approach, Potter,” Kemp told him as they walked off the floor. “It’s clear you’ve learned most of what you know for practical reasons. Your magic is powerful and your spells are effective, but you lack finesse.”
He pulled away, placing a hand on the side of Harry’s face because he simply couldn’t help himself. His thumb brushed the soft skin at the curve of Harry’s cheek, and for a moment…
Teddy made sort of a “Bah!” sound, and then his hair turned platinum blond. Harry couldn’t see Teddy’s face at the moment, but he imagined his eyes had turned gray to match Draco’s.
“Have a seat,” McInerney told her when she turned back to him. “This desk is yours, technically speaking, although we’re so close together we usually end up sharing. Especially since we’ll work all the same cases. They talk to you about the department?”
“And I do let him watch telly on occasion, but not every day. It’s better to encourage him to read, or use his imagination. He’s very good at that.”
They were silent for a few moments, until Harry started chuckling. “I can’t believe we’ve spent this entire time talking about me,” he said. “I can’t remember the last time I spent this long talking about myself.”
“She told me that what I was going through was normal, and that the first thirty years or so were the hardest. But after that, it wasn’t so bad.” She laughed at the memory, and Harry laughed with her. “I resented that answer at the time, to be honest. But she was trying to make a point, and an important one. Parenting is difficult – that, we already knew – but it also never ends. It doesn’t matter if your children have children of their own. They still need guidance; they still have troubles. You aren’t always equipped to help them, but you always do the best you can. Because you would do anything for them, and that, usually, is enough. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
He considered, occasionally, going out to a bar and picking up a stranger for anonymous sex. Just to make his mind off things. But he let those fleeting ideas go without any real interest in them. He knew, instinctively, that a casual tryst would have the opposite effect. It would make him think more of Draco, not less. He wagered the experience would just make him sad, and he hardly needed more of that.
“Life can be fulfilling without a partner,” Severus said, “if one is not interested in seeking a partner. If one does not feel an urge to share their life with another, then the choice is perfectly reasonable. But
It didn’t matter that it had been four years since the end of the war. Apparently he would never escape the mistakes of his youth.
Immediately following the breakup it had been so easy to focus on all of the problems he and Evan had had. The final six months, those they had spent living together, had remained fresh in his mind because those had been the worst, the hardest, proof positive that he and Evan were never going to work.
Draco did. He couldn’t help himself. He needed to taste Potter again, and he’d already waited long enough, as far as he was concerned.
“Harry,” Draco cut him off, pausing mid-stretch. “Please, for the love of all that is magical in this world, stop feeling guilty for taking a few hours to spend time with your friends. It will be fine. Pipsy will make us dinner, and we’ll play and have fun, and I’ll give him his bath and do the whole routine. And he will be happy, and I will be happy, and you will be happy. End of story.”
Harry blinked. “I’m… fine,” he said. “Really. I’m getting good marks. I’m getting on with everyone. Like I said, the Quidditch team is going strong…”
But after that night, when he’d told her that he missed her, things didn’t unfold as usual. Blaise didn’t sneak out at four in the morning when he thought Vesper was still asleep. They had woken up together, much to her surprise, and she’d had to kick him out in order to get to work on time. And then, only a few days later, he had returned, and not on any pretense, either. He hadn’t shown up because she’d just been on a date or there was something he “had to ask her.” He’d just shown up, and, to her own amazement, Vesper had simply let him in.
He sent the message off and turned the parchment back into a dragon, then turned back to his letter to Pansy.
And so they had left, returning home by floo, Teddy quiet and visibly shaken. Harry had taken him in his arms and told him it would be all right, that it wasn’t as bad as it looked, that it was normal, that Andromeda would feel better in a few weeks. He told Teddy anything he could think of that might help. He had expected Teddy to ask questions; Teddy always asked questions when he didn’t understand something. But he’d said nothing, only nuzzled into Harry’s chest and stayed there until Harry insisted they try to eat something.
“That’s not necessary, Kreacher, thank you,” he said, his tone nearly back to the normal, kind one he always used with the elf. “We’ll serve ourselves.”
“You’re right. And that initial crash was loud, louder than I would have expected. Either they’re bumbling and incompetent, or they were that loud on purpose, to wake the couple up.”
The Slytherin raised one pale eyebrow and looked at Harry with caution in his eyes. “You would deign to partner with a Slytherin, Potter?” His voice was the usual caustic drawl, specially designed to antagonize.
“Good morning, Mila,” Draco said, giving her a small smile. “I’m Healer Malfoy. I don’t know if you remember me. I performed your check-up last year.”
“When I left Hogwarts for Hermione’s baby shower, you remember?” Draco nodded, and Harry went on. “Well, I also popped into my favorite jewelers in Diagon to have these made. I was going to give them to you on your actual birthday, but…”
be different. We won’t parent exactly like Andromeda because we’re not her. It would be foolish to even try to be. I think we should just… you know, be ourselves, and see how it goes. And if there’s something that isn’t working, we’ll adjust. Teddy’s a good kid. He’ll help us. He’ll understand.”
Samara preened and pushed her body into the touch, starting with her head and arching so that Scorpius’ hand ran all the way across her sleek back and down her tail.
He looked back over at the crowd only to find that they were all standing from their seats, still clapping. Whether it was for him, or for the memorial, or for the fallen, he didn’t much care. He was just glad they were moved at all.
“Maybe someone made it look like your master’s handwriting on purpose,” Harry suggested, “so you’d open it.”
It took her over a week to confront Draco about it, which surprised him. He was expecting her to question him after that first strange conversation over dinner. Yet she waited, perhaps to observe them some more, to be sure that her suspicions were correct. And then, when she
“One track mind,” Draco accused flipping his tuxedo jacket around and putting an arm through. “Save it for tonight, once we can be properly alone to enjoy it.”
“You take such good care of me,” she murmured into his neck, hoping he could still hear her. “So much so that I sometimes worry that I let you do too much, that I don’t work on taking care of myself. And that I don’t take good enough care of you in return.”
Slamming the book closed and tucking it under his arm, Harry bounded out of his room and down the stairs, coming out into the common room. The 8
They were probably talking about him now that he was gone, Draco realized as he made his way to his classroom. They were bloody gossips, after all, all three of them. He couldn’t help but wonder what Harry would have to say about Draco, about the two of them together, when Draco wasn’t in the room.
“We just didn’t get on in school,” Draco said. “I don’t really know anything about who he is now. I pass no judgments.”
Harry released a heavy sigh. He hadn’t given much thought to what he was going to do about his apprenticeship. It hadn’t occurred to him that he could simply show up for the session that was already on the schedule, like nothing had happened. But of course, it wouldn’t quite work like that. He and Kemp would have to have a talk. The very thought of it weighed in Harry’s gut like lead. But then, the thought of tossing the connection away without so much as a goodbye didn’t feel right either.
On the way Hermione ran into more people she knew, including Penelope Clearwater, who greeted her happily. Back at Hogwarts Hermione had only known her peripherally as Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, but now they were on the same legal team at the DTF and had become fast friends. Penelope was much like Hermione: hardworking, meticulous, and passionate about her job, and it meant that she was always someone Hermione could turn to at work when she was feeling frustrated.
She glanced up at him then, hoping she could read what he was thinking, what he was feeling about what she had already admitted. His mouth was a bit tight, but there was no anger in his eyes. “About what my parents were doing for the holidays. They’re not skiing.”
Kyle stared at him wide-eyed a moment. Then he leaned forward on the table, his eyebrow tilting skeptically. “You’re going to sit here and insist I’m on par with Harry Potter?”
Hermione fought a smile as her hand continued to work, gently kneading the joint of his shoulder. “I expect you to be patient.”
Harry thought about that, and wondered if the metaphor could apply to him and Draco. He didn’t quite think so. But it worked nicely for Hermione and Ron. “Ok, then,” he said. “So you’re Ron’s anchor he’s your buoy. And Blaise… well, Blaise might be better served finding a buoy of his own.”
Harry dipped further inside. Draco’s internal muscles twitched and clenched a bit at the continued intrusion, but still, it didn’t hurt. Draco let himself relax further.
“She’s about top of the class,” he said. “Or at least a close second. Good on classroom, killer on dueling, of course. And Ross… Declan Ross, the bloke she came with today, he’s quite decent as well. I have no doubt they’ll both be making Senior Auror if they stick with it.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at his godfather in suspicion. It wasn’t like him to meddle in these sorts of situations. “What’s it to you, in the end, Uncle?” he asked. “What difference does it make if I sleep around a bit?”
This was, possibly, the most maddening thing about him. As long as he kept silent he was almost impossible to read, unless you knew him very well and were watching very closely. But when he opened his mouth he had a tendency to be starkly, heartbreakingly honest. It brought Vesper to her knees, sometimes. That used to be a good thing, but it wasn’t so much anymore.
And to tell Ginny… well… he had already cheated death twice. He wasn’t about to risk having to do it a third time.
He took out some parchment and a quill, considering what he wanted to say to her. He had only gotten as far as
And now he had the rest of the day to focus on Teddy, and he was looking forward to it. It was wonderful when they were all together the three of them, but Draco was aware of how much Harry and Teddy had had a chance to bond since he’d moved in, and how much Draco was falling behind by comparison. He wanted Teddy to feel completely safe and comfortable with either of them, like they both were really his parents. Draco couldn’t help but feel this day was an important step towards that.
That didn’t work either, though. Harry’s lips didn’t even twitch. His eyes dropped to his hands, which were resting in his lap, and they remained there as he remained silent.
“I know it’s… awkward,” she said with a soft, embarrassed smile that Draco immediately recognized. “I saw you through the apothecary window and I almost ran for it.” The smile turned sheepish. “But I’ve been thinking about you lately. I even thought about writing, though I wasn’t sure if you would read it. But there are some things I wanted you to know. Things I think it’s important for you to know. I know it’s a lot to ask but could we… just talk, for a little while?”
“If it’s going to make you keep smiling like that,” Draco replied, “then I’ll be sure to make it happen.”
“Hello,” Harry said, and saw three faces look up at him with almost identical neutral expressions. “I’m looking for Draco. I’ve got good news about our project. Have you seen him?”
It wasn’t a bad place to grow up, really, Draco decided. There was plenty to explore, and as Scorpius loved to explore, it was all to the better. Harry often speculated that by the time he was of age, Scorpius would know more of the secrets of Hogwarts than the Marauders and the Golden Trio combined. Draco had a tendency to agree.
Harry looked back to Blaise and nodded. He understood. It wasn't that a strong relationship didn't require effort, and sometimes compromise, but it also wasn't something that could be forced. He'd never realized just how much he had been forcing it with Ginny, when they were together, how much effort he had expended to make himself fit into that relationship and be what she needed him to be, until it was over. That was a kind of compromising he realized he didn't want to do. With Draco, it was easy, not because it wasn't work but because the work required felt natural. It felt like a part of him. He could be himself in it.
“Doing things ‘as you see fit’ is what got us into this mess. I’m beginning to doubt whether you have Ron’s best interests at heart.”
They took their respective places – Harry in the chair behind his desk and Fawley in the chair in front of it – in silence, a silence Harry was rather glad for. The less he had to hear the man speak, the better.
“The weapon or weapons in question may end up being a mix of magical and Muggle technology, but I don’t think that means we can rule out the Adders altogether,” Mac went on. “They could be trying to make a point about the dangers of blending the magic and Muggle worlds. Some of their newest members might not be pureblood, just anti-Muggle. Even wizards who used to be more connected to the Muggle world can change ideologies. And let’s not forget what Ms. Nadharia said about how an explosion of raw energy from a core is probably not going to hurt magical people, only Muggles. This technology
“I mean, you should count your blessings, really,” Scorpius went on. “At least yours only appear in academic journals on occasion. If my dads do something even remotely interesting, it’s on the front page of the
Well, maybe it was a little more than fascination. There was no doubt that Draco Malfoy was beautiful. His body was all smooth, lily-white skin over lean muscle, wet, blond locks clinging to an elegant neck, his sharp features contorted in pleasure. Harry was hard, watching someone that beautiful give themselves pleasure so openly, so shamelessly.
Draco let himself relax. He’d never minded Harry grabbing and kissing him when he wanted, and he wasn’t about to start now. He returned the kiss and then the smile as the brunet pulled away after a moment.
“The nail in my coffin was a few days later, when you off-handedly mentioned an ex-boyfriend back in Toronto. That gave me confirmation that you liked men. And then I knew I was doomed.” He sighed, and Kyle almost thought he caught some self-deprecation in the sound.
“Could we have Pipsy?” Harry’s voice was almost shy, his smile demure. It was an unusual manner for him, but Draco found there was something about it that made his cock twitch. He looked young and sweet like that, with his head tilted and his eyes hooded and heavily lashed.
“You’ll have to tell me how the dinner went later,” Harry said. “I could tell there’s a story there.”
What had he been thinking? Here was an opportunity to show off a sense of style that Potter could only hope for, and he had passed it up. For the sake of what? His mood soured further at the thought of his own shortsightedness.
Harry blinked at him. “You can’t be serious.” Draco looked at him sharply. “You can’t,” Harry went on. “Come on, Draco, you know better.”
There was a loud round of laughter at that, though Hermione did give Draco a look of apology afterwards.
Draco stared at him some more, looking for any trace of doubt. But Harry’s eyes were clear and determined, his skin flushed a dusty rose in arousal, and his hard and weeping cock digging imploringly into Draco’s bare hip. And so Draco made his choice.
difference, and I don’t think that should be overlooked. The way a pureblood is raised is different from the way a half-blood is raised, and Muggleborns come from a completely different world altogether. I believe we have made mistakes in the past, integrating those of Muggle parentage into our world without acknowledging the difference. They should come in more prepared. They should understand the history of the witches and wizards that have come before them, not just in the classroom, but in the…” He paused, looking for the right word. “...ethos of the school, in the culture itself. We have spent so much time obsessing over blood status that we lose sight of our history. The magic is what matters.”
A lot of people hadn’t bought that explanation when he first gave it, though it was the truth. Part of the problem was that many people seemed to think of gay men as overtly sexual, as though they weren’t allowed to have any priorities or concerns other than getting laid. It was very annoying.
“You know, to a proper bedroom, as the child grows up,” she went on, taking another sip of her drink.
Sinistra smiled. “That’s a first. Usually we’re counting down the minutes until we can get off shift.”
After an hour of meticulous stirring, wand timer resetting, and excessive note-taking, the pair finally reached last stage of brewing, where the potion stewed undisturbed for a little over twenty minutes before the final ingredient was added and it was immediately removed from the heat. It meant Harry could stretch at last, and heard his back crack with stiffness of being hunched over the potion for so long.
Draco didn’t believe him, of course. The man had been spending considerably more time in his portrait at Malfoy Manor since Draco had arrived home for the summer and Draco couldn’t help but think that the memory of his godfather was trying to watch over him, though he would never admit as much.
Hermione smiled too and scooted closer so he could reach her easily. She was practically straddling him now, her thighs wrapped around his.
Finally Harry looked up, his smile soft. Draco was about to ask him what he felt like doing next when the brunet said, “Want to help me bake a cake?”
Only a moment later the door opened slowly, creaking as it went, and Teddy’s little head appeared, his face wearing an unsure expression. It immediately broke into a wide grin when he saw that Draco was home and both he and Harry were awake.
“I know that. But it doesn’t change the fact that it will be the anniversary of the day I almost got you killed.”
Harry asked the front desk for directions to the ICU, and they had to take a lift two floors up before making their way through a maze of hallways to an area marked “Intensive Care.”
The crowd was absolutely silent, hundreds of faces staring up at him, and Harry felt, suddenly, much more clear-headed. Because this was important, because he needed to say it, and because they were ready to hear it. He plowed on.
“Hm,” said Draco. He’d always suspected Weasley and Granger were a strange lot. But it wouldn’t do any good to go spouting about it now. “There are going to be a lot of those, aren’t there?” he said.
Neville smiled, seemingly in spite of himself. “You know, Harry, for someone who hates the spotlight so much, you make an awful lot of controversial choices that seem to keep you there.”
had been among the people asking those very questions. “I know they mean well, but it’s different than when someone I’m close to asks. With them I can be honest. But around here…” She gestured around the room. “They’re asking to be polite; they don’t want the grisly details. I have to give them the glossed over version, and it means having the same conversation over and over again. It’s very tiring.”
to do,” Harry went on. He met Draco’s eyes. “I’m not saying I did it alone, and I’m not saying that a lot of it wasn’t because of the plan Dumbledore put in motion from the time I was a child, but I did do it, in the end. And it wasn’t because everything went according to plan, because a lot of it didn’t. It was because I didn’t follow his rules. That’s how I beat him.”
Draco tried to pinch Harry in the ribs, but his hand was captured and a very loud, unpleasant raspberry was blown against his stomach.
“I suppose you’d better answer it, then.” Draco could tell Harry was curious, but now was not the time to explain. He
, he said to the voice. That wasn’t true. He knew that already. He knew it. Plenty of men did, and it didn’t stop them from being men. Harry did it, and he was a man, through and through. A sexy, strong, confident, self-possessed man. So why couldn’t Draco be
Draco welcomed the bustle of the start of term with open arms. Before the students arrived the castle was far too quiet for his liking. He’d tried to fill the time the best he could with lesson planning and familiarizing himself with his new classroom and store pantry, but even then there were way too many empty hours that left themselves open for brooding, and that didn’t suit Draco at all.
“Oh,” said Harry, brow furrowing. “Are we expecting more workers today?” They usually took the floo, but some came in through the front, if they were carrying equipment with them.
to do this, to make himself uncomfortable for an hour or two, it might be worth it. It might be just the thing he needed.
“Have you given any thought to what you want to do after you graduate, and if teaching will be a part of that?”
Ron sat up. “I know exactly what you mean,” he said. “I feel that way most of the time, especially when we’re in a planning meeting with our mothers.”
There was a light buzzing in Draco’s ears, suddenly, and he had to blink and shake his head slightly to clear it. “What?”
Draco was about to add that yes, in fact, they were currently sleeping together, to clear up some confusion, but Paul was already talking again.
Draco liked the thought of that quite a bit as well, and began moving with new confidence, probing deeper into the passage, still using the scissoring motion to continue stretching him.
Draco turned to watch Teddy by the jungle gym. He’d already introduced himself to a few of the kids and was playing with them. When he looked back at Harry he found the brunet already sitting down on the blanket. Harry patted the spot next to him, and Draco sat as well.
“I always play his music when I cook Italian,” Harry explained as Draco listened to the big, jazzy sounds of the band and Martin’s sultry voice. “It puts me in the right mood.” He opened the Chianti and poured them each half a glass to taste.
“And in the morning I made you breakfast, and then we showered together,” Kyle went on, watching as Clint’s smile widened. “And we realized we were so crazy about each other that we wanted to spend the whole weekend together.”
“No product, Pansy,” Draco said, throwing his hands up protectively and squirming away like a child avoiding his mother. “Harry doesn’t like my hair when it’s too stiff.”
“Hermione…” He ground out, and then he stilled, all except for his hand, which was still working along his cock as jet after jet of cum splattered onto Hermione’s body, dashing across her stomach and breasts. One stream went straight along her nipple and she moaned as her orgasm reached its crescendo, her insides pulsing, her whole body trembling with the force of it.
The bindings around Harry’s hands released from the headboard, though they remained wrapped around his wrists. He felt Draco pull on him suddenly, and then flip him onto his back. With a wave of his wand he had the ropes entwine, binding Harry’s wrists together above his head.
Draco blushed. “He said a lot of things. We were having almost a bit of an argument, actually. It’s sort of a blur.”
“Not at all,” he said, gesturing that she should come in. She did, seating herself across from him and crossing her long legs.
“Maybe I knew deep down,” Draco said. “Or at least part of me wanted to believe it. But that part of me wasn’t strong enough to do anything about it. Not yet anyway.”
“I’m really sorry about missing last night,” Harry said. “I really wanted to see you. I’d been thinking about it all weekend.”
Draco smiled sympathetically at him. Harry hated talking to reporters, but apparently it was necessary this time, to combat the allegations that Edmund Rowle and his lawyers were bringing against the DTF’s youth program. Draco was hardly surprised that Harry was the one to be chosen as the voice and face of the PR campaign, but he still felt annoyed on Harry’s behalf.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Draco laughed easily, something Harry had only seen in the Great Hall when Draco was with Pansy or Blaise. Pride swelled in Harry’s chest at the accomplishment.
Mail came a few minutes later, interrupting breakfast with hundreds of letters and copies of the Daily Prophet. A letter was dropped in front of Harry, and the writing on the outside was unmistakably Ron’s.
“Or,” Hermione said as she tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. “We could do this,” She pulled out her wand and muttered “Accio Harry’s gift book,” They both waited in silence for several moments.
“Sure. Haven’t had muggle alcohol in years though,” Jason smiled and extended his hand. Harry took it and they apparated to a dark alley. A small stream of light glowed across Jason’s eyes, and it was very difficult for Harry to bring his gaze away from them. As the pair walked, music poured out from a bar, and Harry could feel his stomach knotting with anticipation.
“Is that so?” Draco drawled. “When’s the match between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff?” Harry pursed his lips theatrically and McGonagall raised an eyebrow, not bothering to hide her amusement.
Harry’s head started burning horribly, but his hands wouldn’t follow the command to drop the book and get it away from him. He dimly heard Draco’s panicked yelling next to him and Draco finally reaching out and yanking the book away. Draco tossed the book on the desk and Harry stared at it in a numb shock.
“Unless you are very good at nonverbal spells, you’re more than welcome to watch me teach my class,” Draco’s face brightened slightly.
“I actually don’t. However, since I listed off what I smelled in mine, you know exactly how attracted I am to-” Harry stopped his words as soon as he realized he was still talking.
“I heard that, Draco,” McGonagall said from Draco’s right. Both boys erupted in laughter again and McGonagall ultimately failed in concealing a smile.
“You must be really daft if you thought that,” Draco said, closing his eyes and settling closer to Harry.
“Well, boggarts live in dark, closed spaces and they take the forms of a person’s worst fear. However, they can be banished with a very simple spell,”
“She's definitely up to something,” Draco said, just before they reached Draco’s portrait. The three lads in the picture all waved at the two, and the door swung open. Harry only hummed in reply
“Noooo,” Teddy cried dramatically, reaching up and pulling at Draco’s hair. Draco made a face at Teddy, earning an exciting laugh from him. Teddy jumped out of Draco’s lap and headed for Harry, crashing into his chest and wrapping his little arms around the back of Harry’s neck.
“How do you think I’d know what it feels like to be under it that long?” He nodded at the last person with their hand up.
“Once upon a time, there was a green dragon named Chubs. Chubs was bullied in dragon school because he was green and because he was smaller than the rest of the dragons in dragon school.” Theatrical gasps went up through the crowd of elves. “One day, Chubs was at home cooking for his mum when a big, scary red dragon burst into his house and kidnapped his mum!” Nincy curled up on Draco’s foot, head resting on his shoe, and he smiled fondly at her. Harry watched in fascination. “Chubs decided to go after the big red dragon, but no one else in dragon school wanted to go help him save his mum. So, Chubs had to go to the big mountain where the red dragon lived in order to save his mum alone. Once Chubs got there, he realized that they had his mum hidden in a heavily guarded forest and he would never be able to fight all the guards. So, once it got dark, Chubs snuck into the forest, but one of the guards saw him!”
Harry took the plate to the library, he knew without a doubt that Hermione would be there. He found her and Draco nearly hidden behind a mountain of books. Hermione appeared to be working while Draco was hunched over the table, asleep.
“How the hell did you get a job there?” Ginny blurted, taking earning surprised glances from her two friends.
“Fuck no,” The words were out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop them. “I’m making my way,” Draco paused briefly. “Saving people,”
“Meh. Just blackboards and stuff,” Harry raised an eyebrow. “Hey, perfection takes time,” Draco said, shifting his weight.
“You shouldn’t have,” Narcissa said, but she opened a package that Harry handed her and bit into one delicately. They fell into an easy conversation after that, both relaxed and laughing constantly. Neither of them noticed footsteps until there was a soft knock on the doorframe. Narcissa glanced over the top of Harry’s head and stood to welcome the visitor. Harry finally turned, eyes resting on Draco’s pale face.
“Harry went on a date with a stalker,” Draco said and Harry rolled his eyes. Hermione glanced at Harry, questioning if Draco was exaggerating. Harry only shrugged.
“Is that Nincy?” A small giggle followed his question and an elf that was smaller than the rest stepped forward and sat nearest to Draco’s foot. Draco took a dramatically deep breath, glancing at Nincy out of the corner of his eye.
“Might be a bit too late for that,” He pointed over Harry’s shoulder, and Harry whipped around to see the man in question storming towards them.
“For me, I just did the opposite of what the voice wanted. For example, if it wanted me to start tap-dancing, I’d tell myself to lay on the floor. The voice gets frustrated, and suddenly, it isn’t so alluring to listen to it anymore,”
“I didn’t really,” Adam grinned, finally appearing more relaxed. “I’m sure they had their beliefs about it, but in all honesty, that newspaper was the first confirmation that anyone got,”
“Well, hello,” the clerk handed Harry his change, giving Draco an indiscreet once-over. Draco wrapped his arm over Harry’s shoulder, giving the clerk an innocent smile. His eyes widened and she handed the bag to Harry silently.
Hagrid ended up retiring earlier than he was scheduled to, due to an injury from a creature Hagrid wouldn’t name, although Harry was fairly certain it was something illegal. Charlie officially joined Hogwarts staff after Christmas, and Harry really couldn’t be happier for him.
He stepped to the side so they could see his blackboard, which was filling itself up with notes. He dove into the lecture, trying to be as detailed as possible without scarring these children for life. He always got awkward trying to teach about the killing curse, he felt like it brought him unwarranted attention.
“Well, I’m going to start by saying that no matter how prideful we are in our own houses, we must be the unfaltering example of inter-house unity…” Harry had already lost interest, he knew lectures like this one tended to be very long and repetitive. After a few moments, a small piece of folded parchment flitted in front of him and landed next to his hand. He opened it and read the contents.
“Can you show us?” Now Presley had voiced the question, and it was soon backed up by her friends. Harry summoned his wand from his desk, already focusing on his memory.
“Attracted to who, Harry?” Draco took a half step towards Harry. The bastard already knew. Draco leaned forward on the desk, hands on either side of Harry.
“Would you rather her see you?” Harry retorted. “Besides, she won’t bother me as much if I’m in an area like a candy shop,” Draco sighed in defeat and handed Harry a few packages of different chocolates.
“Merlin’s ‘Magica Captionem’ seizures came in a set of three, and he reported his power growing each time, but he delved deeper into madness with each passing day. He claims the cause of the seizures was a cursed book given to him by his eventual husband’s mother,”
Draco didn’t realize that teaching classes would be so tiring, but he felt dead on his feet by the time his last class of the day was dismissed. He walked to his portrait, ready for a hot shower and sleep. He only had two classes scheduled for tomorrow, and they were both O.W.L. level classes.
“So, what brings you to our neck of the woods?” Harry shrugged. He definitely wasn’t staring at the gorgeous face in front of him. His eyes were strikingly blue.
“I’m not calling you in here to discuss what’s on the front page of the Daily Prophet,’ McGonagall said, sitting gracefully in her oversized armchair. “I want you two to become heads of houses,” Harry could have sworn he heard a sigh of relief from Draco.
“Oh please, call me Minerva,” Harry laughed and nodded, but he didn’t see himself breaking a habit of seven years any time soon. “Once Mr. Malfoy arrives, we can begin the formalities part of the meeting,” she had a twinkle in her eye as she spoke.
“I’m sure if we looked, we could find something about Merlin in the library. Ron, you don’t have to come if you don’t want to. I know you have things to do at work,”
“Where’s the place then? Don’t tell me it’s in muggle London,” Draco sighed when Harry only kept walking towards the Hogsmeade apparation point.  “I haven't been to muggle London in ages, Potter,” Draco caught up to Harry in two long strides.
“We’ve been going over stuff on cursed objects. We have to destroy the book that Narcissa gave you,” Harry glanced at the mentioned book, which was resting next to her elbow.
The book flew and landed on his desk in front of him, opened to the inside of the front cover. There was a handwritten note, but it wasn’t in handwriting he recognized.
“Fuck off,” Draco smiled softly. Harry entertained himself by playing with Draco’s hair until he had apparently fallen back asleep. Fifteen minutes came and went, but Harry decided to let Draco sleep. Besides, he was comfortable. They laid there nearly an hour until Draco finally woke up on his own. He rolled onto his back stretching and yawning while Harry watched.
“Let’s not make this a big deal,” Harry said, folding the letter and tucking it into his coat pocket. Ron sighed again, and Hermione seemed relieved that Ron stayed quiet on the matter.
“Sod off, Skeeter,” Harry growled, apparating away, not even caring if muggles saw him. He landed on the edge of the Hogwarts property line and marched into the castle. He flopped on his bed, not caring that his glasses were pressing into his nose and he couldn’t really breathe.
“Granger, I don’t think-” He abruptly stopped his sentence as the library door swung open and a thick book flew right into Hermione’s lap. She looked at him with a smug smile on her face.
“How’d your day go?” Harry asked before shaking the water out of his hair. Draco definitely didn’t use the opportunity to further appreciate Harry’s toned upper body, that would be crazy.
A pile of letters was sitting on his bedside table and his owl, Zeus, was resting in his cage. Rubbing his eye tiredly, Draco grabbed the letter off the top of the pile and opened it.
Harry stood in front of his class, twenty faces looking at him excitedly. Third years, at least, had gone to school with Harry for a bit so he knew some of their names.
Harry walked to breakfast in high spirits, even though Draco was still asleep when Harry left. He was greeted at the staff table with smiles and waves, and he poured himself a steaming mug of coffee, even though he didn’t usually drink it.
“Like if I would have shaken your hand all those years ago,” Harry grinned cheekily when Draco rolled his eyes.
“Minerva has high hopes for you two,” Flitwick said as if he was sharing a dark secret that nobody else knew of. “I do too, quite honestly,” He scooped a small bite of pudding onto his spoon and ate it daintily.
It was several days later when Draco decided he’d had enough of lying around doing nothing. He’d owled Trina earlier, asking her to meet him for a drink. He was surprised when she replied saying she was with Weaslette and Potter, but they’d be willing to let Draco join their group.
“Is he teaching Potions?” Harry blurted, surprised. Draco hadn’t mentioned teaching at Hogwarts to Harry. McGonagall nodded.
“Dramatic, are we?” Harry raised his middle finger to the general direction of the bathroom and heard a laugh in reply.
“This is Jason,” Harry said, not bothering to hide his annoyance. “He’s the one I went on the date with,”
“Well, either way, it’s causing issues for you so we have to destroy it now,” Daco said after Hermione had finished laughing.
“Is everything okay?” Draco asked, carefully stepping into the room. Both occupants whipped around to face him. Draco noticed the stranger reach for his wand while Harry’s attention was on Draco.
“Well, never would've guessed you’re the one with a sweet tooth,” Harry joined Draco looking at the expansive chocolate display.
“Okay, let’s start off with this- who here has heard of a boggart?” Several hands shot into the air, but a notable amount stayed down.
“We just have to figure it out quickly, the students get here in five days and lessons start the day after that,” Draco grabbed the books about Merlin and set off to return them from where they had come from. Hermione wandered off to the restricted section.
“Yeah? It was notorious,” Draco said. “Honestly,  I’m surprised she didn’t get caught,” Harry rolled over onto his back.
Harry stepped outside, smiling when the sun hit his skin. It was perfect weather outside, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to go back to the castle just yet. Instead, he apparated to a muggle park near the entrance of King’s Cross and sat on a bench. It was a relief to sit in plain sight without anyone recognizing him. Until he heard the click of a camera. Harry’s attention snapped to a bush nearby, scanning it accusingly. It looked like there was a disillusionment charm in place. Harry scowled, whispering the countercharm, and revealed Rita Skeeter standing a few feet away from him.
Jason latched his mouth on Harry’s collarbone and began sucking and biting at the skin there as if his life depended on it. Harry screwed his eyes shut and tried to focus on summoning his wand, praying to whatever higher powers that it would work. Ice cold hands worked under Harry’s shirt and he nearly cried from happiness when he felt the cool wood of his wand rest in his palm.
“Alright, alright,” Harry couldn’t resist saying no, and he was curious himself. Harry unlocked the cabinet again, and it seemed to be several minutes before the boggart appeared. Ron stepped out of the cabinet, and confused whispers broke out across the room, but they fell silent when he began to speak.
“Having a Slytherin hero instead of a Gryffindor hero for once would not have made things worse for us, you bimbo,” Draco replied, halfheartedly rolling his eyes.
“I’m not really allowed to tell you. It’d cause a whole bunch of issues,” Harry said apologetically and Presely frowned, brows furrowing.
“Might wanna check that out,” Harry gave him an odd look but walked to the cramped bathroom anyways. Harry swore when he saw the reason for Draco’s odd behavior.
“If you go out through the employee’s exit, I’ll pay for the candy and meet you outside,” Harry whispered, watching Skeeter as she slowly moved through the aisle.
“Well hello,” Harry said. Teddy giggled softly, letting Harry carry him. Harry carefully stood and walked to his desk, Teddy’s head resting on his chest.
“We know,” A voice chimed in from the back of the group, and several others quickly agreed. “And we’d accept that it might take more time or more practice or whatever,”
“You don’t have any room to talk,” Draco huffed and rolled his eyes at Harry, but Harry had the feeling Draco was happy that he seemed to be fine overall. Harry summoned the rest of the papers from around the room and set them in a semi-neat pile on the desk. He then plopped in the chair and looked at Draco again.
“No kisses on the first date, Potter,” Draco said with a smirk, walking towards his own room. Harry scowled at his back but didn’t reply. He jogged to the bathroom to check his hair even though he knew it was not going to be tamed. He ran his hands through it a couple of times, then headed towards Hogsmeade.
Their first stop was three broomsticks, after carefully scouting the inside to make sure Jason wasn’t working. They got a booth in the corner and went through several mugs of butterbeer, chatting and flirting animatedly.
“Not even Dumbledore could do both at the same time. Your magic has got to be way stronger than you realize if you can do wandless and silent without a second thought,” Harry fidgeted.
“Thanks,” Harry said as Jason sat next to him on the actual couch cushion. They finished the beers, popping open several more as hours passed and Harry was surprised at how easy conversation was flowing. He had had more drinks than he cared to admit, and so had Jason. Harry realized he had moved onto the couch and was sitting next to Jason’s other side. Before Harry could put two and two together, Jason shifted ever so slightly to face Harry. Harry could smell the beer on his breath.
“I was already planning on going to every house match,” Harry said dramatically, throwing an even more dramatic wink at McGonagall.
“Ron was saying how I betrayed him and all the Weasley’s and stuff like that.” Harry tried to sound indifferent, and he was proud that his voice didn’t waver or crack.
“Tell you what,” The wither grabbed a napkin and transfigured another napkin into a pencil and began writing furiously. “I get off at seven. I’ll hang around for a bit after and if you wanna come to grab a real drink with me, you know where to find me,” He pushed the napkin toward Harry, which had the name Jason scrawled across the top, and a muggle phone number under that.
“Did you do that wandlessly and silently?” Harry looked at Draco in confusion, suddenly embarrassed.
“Can you tell us the story about the green dragon?” A timid voice in the back of the house-elf crowd asked. Draco looked for the source, trying to hide a blush.
“Jason, what the bloody hell?” Harry snapped, trying to wrestle away to reach for his wand. Jason’s reply wasn’t completely decipherable, the only words Harry could properly understand were ‘fuck’ and ‘pretty little sub’ and those words sent chills right to Harry’s bones.
“Is it safe to assume you two can work professionally without getting into childish debates?” Something told Harry the only acceptable answer was ‘yes’.
“There are many bad people out there, Mister Harry. House-elves are kidnapped all the time and made to work in conditions much worse than this one,” The kitchen door swung open and another elf walked in, ears twitching. Draco walked in behind the elf, and several other elves swarmed around his feet, chattering excitedly. He greeted them all by name, faltering only when he saw Harry there too.
“Sod off,” Draco replied as they walked in, the bell tinkling daintily overhead. Draco immediately headed for the chocolate section while Harry wandered around the store, picking up various candies and cakes.
“I officially hate teaching about the Unforgivables,” Draco’s eyes snapped up, and he tossed the stack of papers and his quill onto his desk.
His scar no longer looked like a drawing o a lightning bolt. Instead, it now stretched across his forehead and eyes like an actual bolt of lightning. It branched over his eyes and the bridge of his nose.
“How’d your date go, Potter?” Draco asked from the other side. Harry didn’t answer, instead, turning off the sink and burying his face in a towel. “Your arm is bleeding. Are you okay?” Draco stepped into the bathroom and gently pulled the towel away from Harry’s face.
“He was in here when I got up here from the library and he said he wanted another chance and all that crap,” Draco scowled.
“That’d be because I was her favorite student,” Draco said with a half-smile, earning a snort of laughter from both Harry and Ginny.
“Not my fault,” Harry said innocently. Before anyone could reply, Madam Pomfrey’s voice sliced through the hospital wing.
He slowly sat up, crawling so he could see Harry. Harry was on his floor, blood dripping from his temple. His glasses were shattered and his shirt was in scraps, but he appeared fine. Jason was nowhere to be found.
Harry’s week was filled with rebounded spells, several students tearing holes in their robes, and one particular student who could not say a complete sentence without cursing. For some reason, Harry found himself drawn to Draco’s classroom after the final class on Friday evening. Draco appeared to be scrubbing the floor, and Harry cleared his throat to let him know he had company.
“My advice is that you lay down and get some rest,” This time Harry didn’t protest, and Hermione, Ron, and Draco silently walked out of the hospital wing. As soon as the door closed behind them, Draco and Hermione began conversing in hushed whispers.
“My next class starts soon. I’ll see you at lunch,” Harry kissed Draco, then headed back to his own classroom so he could prepare himself for a repeat of the Unforgivables lecture.
“I suppose that starts rather soon doesn’t it?” Draco nodded, finally tearing his eyes away from Harry’s.
“When I give Harry a book, it usually stays in his trunk until he eventually forgets it, but I have a feeling that that’s not the case here,” Draco nodded blankly.
“So, in conclusion, don’t cast any of those spells, please. Any questions?” Harry swore internally when several hands went up, this was not a normal occurrence in this class.
“I can’t believe you actually convinced me to come here. This place is tacky,” Draco commented and Harry smacked his arm.
“Get the hell away from me,” Draco spat, drawing his wand and pointing it at his father’s throat. If he could just get another two steps closer to the door, he’d be able to get help.
“I wasn’t paying attention,” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips. Neither of them noticed a figure passing by quickly, now armed with the critical photograph she needed in order to publish a scandalous article in the Daily Prophet.
As soon as Harry got to his dorm, he shrugged off his jacket and headed to the bathroom to run water on his face.
“Hagrid said he left his notes for the next few lessons in his hut,” Draco said from Harry’s left, and Charlie perked up even more.
“Professor!” Harry smiled, beckoning for the small crowd of students to enter. It was a small group of standout students that often came for extra work that wasn’t in the curriculum.
“Look,” Hermione opened the book and turned it so Harry could read it. “Merlin left a warning for the next owner,”
Harry smiled and kissed his stomach. “Yes. We definitely have that.” He reached across Draco a moment, to a drawer in one of his nightstands. He extracted something, then held it up for Draco to see. It was a small tub. “My favorite lubricant. It warms easily, and should help you relax.”
“Tighten up that flourish on your Stunner,” he said. “No need to wave your wand around. Remember, draw power from your core.”
And with that being said, I'll just leave you with the epilogue, plus lots of hugs and kisses and love from me. XOXO,
,” Harry said. “I want to eat her up.” He grabbed one of her tiny bare feet and pretended to munch on it, making the baby giggle some more.
with Potter. At least, he was pretty sure he had. It didn’t seem much like flirting at the time. It had felt natural, and he honestly hadn’t been thinking much about what he was saying. Looking back on it, though, he definitely thought it could be misconstrued that way. He’d blushed, and grinned, and looked away demurely, and let the tone of his voice get all deep and suggestive.
“That’s all right,” Harry said, sitting up. He was suddenly aware that he was naked. Not that Ginny hadn’t seen it all before, but he hugged the sheets around his lower half anyway. “What… um… how long have you been here?”
“And then I touch them some more, or kiss them, or both, and their reactions tell me what to do next. They tell me to keep the same pace, or they tell me to move faster, play rougher. Or they tell me to take it slow, to let us work our way up. They tell me how hard or gentle to be, how passionate, how aggressive. They tell me whether I should take them fast and hard or slow and sensual. Some people want to be the aggressors, others want to be dominated. Some want a bit of both. Some simply want to be tossed on a bed and taken, and others… want to be seduced.”
“You is most welcome, Master Draco, sir,” the elf squeaked. “And for you, Master Harry,” she said, turning to him, “is the pancakes to your liking, sir?”
Lindsey could see the change in him as surely as he could feel it in himself, and she told him so, the very day she was leaving for Toronto.
Draco laughed. It was true that since their relationship went public, the students seemed to love to discuss them and what their relationship was like. He supposed that two relatively young, good-looking professors could generate that kind of buzz, particularly amongst the older students. It didn’t help that many of them attended the wedding, meaning they heard Harry and Draco’s marriage vows and got to witness just how deeply in love they were. The two professors had yet to cease being a hot topic when it came to gossip.
“And just so you know, I’m going to figure out some way to get you to redo your wardrobe anyway. Don’t think this lets you off the hook for life.”
They did the grocery run first, Kyle following Draco around the Tesco while he tried to remember how many tomatoes he and Harry had used for the sauce they’d made all those months ago over the Christmas hols. He realized he hadn’t been paying all that much attention at the time, too engrossed in Harry and the music and the delicious wine.
“Curiosity, mostly. When I was thinking about being with men… or really… you specifically, I really didn’t know what role I would want. I thought I could go either way.”
Draco hesitated. He’d agreed to one drink, and he’d fulfilled that agreement. But… he was having a surprisingly good time. He had expected Potter to turn out sanctimonious and straight-laced, the good little Gryffindor that did what people expected of him, that had a wife and a family or was on his way to having one. That Potter would have been hard to be around, succeeding in all the ways Draco had failed. But
“It always looks like this,” Harry insisted for about the thousandth time. He ran a hand over it in a half-hearted attempt to flatten it. It was shorter again. He’d finally given into his own wishes and cut it, since it was really starting to get out of hand and Harry didn’t like it long in the warmer weather. Draco had pouted, but only in jest, really.
“It’s an owl,” Harry said. He gave Draco a quick peck before making to stand up. “I’ll go let it in.”
Kemp had Harry stand in the center of the training floor so he could get a good look at him. “I want to begin at the beginning,” he said. This turned out to be a good thing, because apparently Harry knew nothing about proper dueling technique. His stance was all wrong, as was the way he held his wand. Kemp physically adjusted the position of his feet, his center of gravity, and his wand grip, talking him through what he was doing.
“It wasn’t perfect,” Harry said. “It was far from perfect. Ginny and I are not you and Hermione. We’ve never understood each other the way you two do. We’ll never be as strong together as you two are. That’s just the way it is.”
Harry had grown accustomed to the Weasley method of dining over the years, which involved a lot of food all served at once, sometimes followed by a pudding course. The Malfoys, however, clearly preferred to dine in the French style, with multiple courses and wine that paired with each dish. Harry found it all a bit overwhelming, though quite delicious, and simply tried his best to use the correct fork and knife for each course, watching Draco surreptitiously out of the corner of his eye to make sure he was doing it right.
Kyle turned red. “Ugh, can we not talk about that? Lindsey always makes it sound like a much bigger deal than it actually is.”
She looked over her shoulder at him, giving him a dark look that hopefully conveyed her deep need for him.
“Well, I didn’t really think it was any of my business. It became clear early on that you two were serious. I thought…” He paused, his eyes suddenly cautious.
“What are you staring at?” Hugo leaned past Scorpius to get a good look, and when he spotted Aria, he smirked. “You know her, right?”
Harry’s eyes widened. They were getting into much deeper territory than he expected. Wield his power as a force of good? The idea almost frightened him. “I don’t want to… I don’t know, wind up like… like Lockhart, or someone. Addicted to the fame and the attention, obsessed with myself and how others see me. And I don’t want to wind up like Voldemort, or Grindelwald, thinking that because I have power that it makes me better than other people, giving me the justification for taking whatever I want for myself and destroying anyone who gets in my way.”
“Go out and get pissed with a bunch of Gryffindors?” he asked, looking from one curious face to the next. “Yeah, all right. Why not?”
Hermione smiled demurely. “I’m not sure it’s really my calling. I quite like the DTF. There’s a lot of freedom to do the kind of work I want.”
“He doesn’t really. We’re similar in that way. In some ways he’s actually been more of a disappointment to our parents than I have. They couldn’t relate to the fact that I liked dance and dueling more than schoolwork, but they understood that it was just a part of my nature. For Silas… well, he was one of those rarities that got selected for two houses when he was sorted.”
year of Hogwarts, since Hannah and Pansy were such good friends, but it wasn’t until Healing school that they’d really become friends in their own right. They bonded over the immense and challenging workload, and helped each other in various ways during those two years. Hannah, a Charms master, had provided excellent guidance for Draco in the trickier healing and blood replenishing charms, which were notoriously hard to get right, while Draco had aided Hannah with Potions, which had never been her best subject. By the time they started on their first year of residency together, Draco considered her one of his closest friends. She could always be relied on in a pinch and was capable of remarkable kindness, even when under stress.
Draco looked over his shoulder at them to see that many were following Draco and Pansy with their eyes, and some were giggling and whispering to each other behind their hands.
“So, is this your way of saying I ought to figure out what I want for myself, or your way of saying I need to speak openly and honestly to Cole about everything I’m feeling?”
“Auror Corps standard issue. Technically not available to civilians,” Potter said with a wry smirk. “But I took a few of them with me when I left the Corps. I thought they might come in handy.”
“I’m going to write to Kingsley about this. He has to do something, if he isn’t already. This can’t pass. I won’t let it.”
“Declan…” She couldn’t stand the flatness of his voice or the blankness of his face, but she knew there was nothing she could do.
Angelina made a skeptical noise somewhere between a scoff and a laugh, and Kyle ignored her. He was telling the truth.
Kemp walked Harry out, discussing Harry’s schedule for next week, which had to be pared down since NEWTs began in only a little over a week and Harry needed plenty of studying time. After Vesper had put his session on the books, Kemp bid him goodbye and returned to his office. Harry was about to do the same to Vesper when he caught a very funny, almost guilty look in her face.
Harry was feeling windswept and carefree as he pulled up on his broom and came to a smooth stop. He looked around for Draco, but it was only a few seconds later that the blond appeared beside him, his cheeks pink from the chilly air and his mouth forming a wide grin.
Harry nodded in understanding. Inaccuracy was often a problem when it came to teenage boys "teaching" each other about sex. He was glad Draco hadn’t had the same issue for the most part.
Vesper turned back to her DVD collection, still seeking out what she was looking for, but also so she didn’t have to answer. When Declan said things like that it made her feel funny, like a throbbing weight was settling in her stomach. She couldn’t tell if she liked the feeling or not.
Harry shrugged. “It’s not my natural inclination, but when something really matters to me… I suppose I’m incapable of just sitting by and keeping silent. Don’t know if that’s a good thing or not, but it’s the way I’m built.”
Draco's drink was placed in front of him and he took a sip, enjoying the way Rick watched him. “It’s a tradition in my family, naming children after the night sky.”
“On the kinder end of things, yes,” Harry said with a laugh, coming into the room and closing the door behind him. “What is it that you did to earn such ire, may I ask?”
“He just loves to be out in the world and discover things,” Harry added with a contented sigh. “Maybe he’ll end up in Ravenclaw.”
He raised his eyebrows. “It’s your first day. Of course that’s true.” He waved his hand in a conciliatory gesture. “The question wasn’t meant to be a test, merely a way for me to know where I should begin. I read your file, you know. You were a duelist, which means you were likely strong in Defense when you were a student, and probably did well on your NEWT level. And Defense involves both mastering spells and understanding imbued magic. I thought maybe you’d already had some education in artifacts imbued with dark magic, and I wouldn’t want to spend an hour lecturing you on something you already know.”
“I did this,” he said, his voice sounding shocked to his own ears. “I did this to you. I can’t believe-”
“Good,” Harry said. He leaned in for a kiss, and he knew the moment their lips collided that this was going to heat up, that they were going to need more from each other, after everything they'd just said. “Let me show you,” Harry whispered as his hand went exploring for Draco’s erection. “Let me show you what you mean to me.”
His eyes narrowed. “Because it’s none of your goddamn business whom I go home with?” he ventured in a dry drawl.
“Surely you don't think she’s…” Vesper didn’t really want to finish that sentence, and maybe she shouldn’t, she realized. But then Ron finished it for her.
“Good.” Hermione smiled mildly at him. “I promised I wouldn’t keep you long. That was all I needed to say. So, unless there was something you needed from me?”
“Which is exactly why they’re going to ban those things within a week. I guarantee it,” Noor chimed in.
To his surprise, she laughed. “Hardly,” she said. “I wasn’t planning on hiring any new people for this project, actually. I was just going to recruit from within. But having talked to you… well, what can I say? I can see what all of the fuss is about.”
This was not the first time in the past few weeks that Harry was reminded of Draco’s limited experience with relationships and what it felt like to be in one. He never knew, in those moments, if it would be best to explain to Draco that attachment wasn’t weakness, that the craving he was feeling was natural at the beginning of a relationship, and would temper itself over time. But the last thing he wanted to do was come across as condescending.
“Maybe you don’t want to hear this…” David said finally. “But I really think this is the best thing that could have happened to you. I think it’s better this way, at least to some extent.”
Luckily, Safar was as competent as he was gracious, asking probing, insightful questions, not just about the Heirloom Act but also Harry’s personal journey during his final year at Hogwarts as well as his relationship with Draco. The two wizards had been expecting this. They knew that by holding the interview with the two of them, such questions were bound to arise.
Draco pointed a finger at Harry. “There is an ounce or two of Slytherin in you after all, Potter. I knew there had to be.”
They spoke only of the project. Not once did conversation drift to the realm of the personal, and they were far from chatty. They passed most of the evening in silence, pulling books, rifling through their pages, and taking notes. But it was civil, and really fairly comfortable, and Harry decided to be grateful for that, at least.
“Ah, yes, the parlor in the west wing, of course,” Kyle said, doing a halfway decent impression of Draco’s voice and making the blond chuckle. Despite the mild mocking, Kyle seemed genuinely interested in the manor and asked him questions about the portraits and artifacts that they passed. Draco was happy to answer his questions, and their conversation extended all the way to their destination. Kyle looked around that space too, noticing every detail, this time silently.
The blond was speeding up his rhythm, one hand still gently kneading Harry’s bollocks and the other exploring the rest of Harry: caressing his arse, stroking his stomach, pinching a nipple. It all built the heat inside Harry bit by bit until he could hardly stand it.
Draco growled at him, but Harry didn’t care. He was too busy searching deliberately for Draco’s prostate. After a few well-placed strokes he found it, feeling Draco spasm underneath him. Now that he knew the angle, he found it again easily and brushed over it slowly and carefully.
Draco’s half-eaten sandwich went temporarily forgotten as he looked at said photographs with a sober expression. His eyes scanned the wounds, assessing the details.
“I don’t know what to do,” he said. “I’m not sure Draco really understands how serious I am about him. I think he thinks it was just a lust-fueled encounter, and it happened because I just became single and I wanted to see what it’s like to be with a bloke. And since he’s been attracted to me for a while, he went with it. But he never took it seriously.” He took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. “I made a mistake, doing that with him. I should have gone slower. Maybe just a kiss, or just telling him what I wanted. At that point, I didn’t really know exactly what I wanted, in the long run. I just knew I wanted him, in the moment. But I shouldn’t have acted on it. It was a mistake.”
Harry crawled out from under the dummy, pulling out his wand again. He was about to perform a quick cleaning charm on himself when he was interrupted.
So she swallowed down the regret, the disappointment, and turned the conversation back to more pleasant things as they finished their lunch. The lunch hour was mostly gone anyway, and she had a lot to think about. She kissed him goodbye, told him she loved him, and left him smiling after her.
They had their own kind of silent communication, his dads did, and always had since he could remember. The arch of a brow, the slight shrugging of a shoulder, or even just a lingering, steady gaze, and they seemed to understand each other perfectly. Scorpius wondered what that would be like, to have an intimacy so profound with another person that you often didn’t need words, that you already knew exactly what that person was going to say before they’d said anything. And for them to know you that well too… It was hard to imagine.
Kyle grinned back at him, and he realized his face was going to be hurting by the end of the night if that kept up. “With me. You’ve been doing all that work with Healing charms lately, and it’s said that Pukwudgie favors Healers.”
, when all is said and done. Sometimes I think I almost have it, when I least expect it. You know, when I’m in the shower or something. And then I rush to get my thoughts on paper and it never sounds quite as good as it did in my head. It’s the reason I decided to start this little task force, really. Well, the troubling legislation that’s come up recently is a part of it, too. But mostly I realized that it might not just be the Muggleborns that are stuck trying to navigate our society as it is now. Because we are pluralist, and power shifts from one group to another on occasion, and the culture evolves, people from many different backgrounds and blood statuses might find themselves at a loss. They might find themselves being discriminated against for whatever reason. I didn’t want anyone to feel like our services were closed to them simply because of their blood status.”
“Making sure that Ron is taken care of. I’m sure you must realize that I hold you personally responsible for what’s happened. Therefore I expect you to make it right.”
It was more than that, something that couldn’t really be defined or known, something that didn’t need to be. It didn’t have to follow a recipe, a set path. It could just be what they made it, with all the tartness and sweetness and richness and bite and kick they wanted to give it.
Kyle nodded along, staring into his coffee mug. After it was clear Draco was finished, he answered. “Thank you for saying that. It… helps me understand. And I believe you now. And I guess… what I’ve been thinking about is how much time we spent talking about me, and how much I liked that.” He gave Draco a small smile that was both wry and sheepish. “So I guess I was being pretty self-absorbed too, because I wasn’t really paying attention to the fact that you were holding yourself back. I was enjoying being able to vent and be validated for everything that’s happened to me recently. I haven’t had a boyfriend I felt like I could be that honest with in… a long time. But it wasn’t really equal, was it? And I didn’t even know it. Maybe I was treating you more like my mind healer than my boyfriend.”
Teddy vanished down the hall, leaving the bedroom door fully ajar. They could hear the sounds of his feet on the stairs.
“Hm,” Harry said, eyeing Malfoy for a moment. “You want to preserve wizarding culture, yet here you sit, wearing Muggle pajamas.”
A door opened, and two figures emerged. One was a light-haired wizard, probably Harry’s age, looking rumpled but energized. The other was dark-haired, tall, slender, and imposing. He reminded Harry a bit of Snape, though his hair was cropped short and he sported a well-trimmed beard on his square jaw. One lithe hand rested idly on the younger wizard’s shoulder.
Harry straightened up, enough that his eyes were level with Draco’s. “Because of what you said, about needing to move on, and then later about needing space. It seemed like you needed time, and I believed you deserved that. You deserved a chance to explore what else was out there. I think that’s an important thing for a person to do. I had hoped that maybe, if you had that chance, you would come back to me, eventually.”
Hermione nodded, knowing he was right. “Well…” she began, trying to generate another solution on the spot.
Vesper looked down at the table again. “You’re right,” she said. She ran a hand across her forehead and through her hair, knowing the truth. Part of her wanted to hear it, all the things Blaise wanted to say. Which really wasn’t fair. Not to Blaise, or Declan, or herself.
talking about sex.” She felt her heart start to thump painfully. “That’s what this is about? You’re pissed at me because we haven’t had sex yet?”
Harry and Malfoy were in the library, at their usual table, working on the Potions project when a girl, a sixth year Slytherin, approached them and sat down in the chair directly opposite Harry.
“Still,” Vesper said, watching the body language of the two men in black closely. “You think they would have tried
He silently cursed Astoria - and the damage she had obviously done to his ability to be attracted to anyone - as Bianchi continued to expound on the ways she was approaching heading Slytherin house in a different fashion than her predecessors.
“Also true,” Draco replied. Harry watched as the Slytherin closed his eyes again, almost looking relieved.
It clicked for Harry. “If we order the oil as well. Then we can add it back into the skin at the same time we rehydrate it, and it will be as good as new.”
“Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.” The voice was closer now, only a few inches from her ear, and it made her shiver unpleasantly. Her hand tightened around her quill, but still she didn’t turn around. Instead she bent forward over her desk, focusing on the words in front of her.
“I was a confused boy who had just found out he was a wizard and didn’t know what he was getting into, and you were a confused boy who simply wanted to be my friend, and went about it the wrong way.”
“Well, why not? Like I said, he’s quite a catch. And he’s going to be teaching here next year. That leaves plenty of time for us to get to know each other.” She eyed him a moment. “Do you have something against him? You’ve been rather quiet since he arrived.”
Kyle squeezed his hip, his hand having somehow found its way underneath Clint’s coat. He hesitantly pulled away, starting to remove his own coat and hoping Clint would take it as permission to do the same.
“Still,” Harry said, as he made to unpin the badge from his chest, “you would have done a better job.”
Draco smiled devilishly. “I think you’ll find that Pansy and I might be in agreement on this. So, no long discussion needed.”
“We do,” Harry said, realizing he was on the edge of doing the very thing they both feared: ruining things for good. “I just… pretending doesn’t work for me, either. I’m no good at it.”
“Don’t you have a job you’re supposed to be doing?” she asked him, arching a brow. “Saving lives and all that?”
“Why didn’t your uncle tell me any of this? He let me believe from the day we met that he just left for the States to save his own skin. He flat out told me that. He let me believe he was a selfish coward.”
Hermione felt warmth pooling in her chest at the sight of them, effectively driving out any strange or melancholy feelings that were left over from her conversation with Vesper. Harry and Teddy seemed more like father and son than ever, and it was so gratifying to see. It gave her hope.
Harry tried not to gape. What Kemp had said sounded almost like an apology, which Harry had not been expecting. He’d also gotten right to the heart of the issue, without Harry having to explain it, but then… Kemp always had a knack for that. “I would say that’s accurate, sir,” he said. Kemp merely nodded, and so Harry continued. “I admire the way you teach, the kind of progress your students can make in such a short time. Observing has been very helpful. But asking me to teach and then trying to… teach me, while I’m teaching… well… it was a bit of a…”
“Good,” Harry said. He knew the others were watching, but that didn’t stop him from running a hand over Draco’s forehead, pushing his hair out of the way. “We’ll figure out who did this, and we’ll make an example of them. I promise.”
“He looks very handsome and presentable,” Blaise reassured Draco, though Draco didn’t much need reassuring in that regard. “The other men are in black, which I think is a bit boring if I’m honest.”
They were silent for a bit, Pansy seeming to consider what he had just told her and Draco wondering at what point Pansy was going to lose all patience with him and end the floo connection.
They’d been flying most of the afternoon on the Malfoy Manor Quidditch pitch, which was the best and most secluded spot to fly that either of them could think of. They’d started with a few games of Seeker’s Quidditch (in which Harry beat Draco two-to-one) and then practiced some tricks. Harry hadn’t realized how rusty he was.
Harry awoke wrapped in the heat of a warm body. It was a feeling he was really starting to get used to, after the past week of spending every night with Draco. While the Slytherin was hardly the clingy type in his waking life, he always seemed to be drawn unrelentingly to Harry when he slept. When he and Draco shared a bed Harry usually found himself not merely attached to his boyfriend, but completely tangled up in him, come morning.
And, of course, general thoughts are always welcome. Or just news on how you're doing. You all have been in my thoughts lately.
Then, last year, the Foundation found itself with a budget surplus and a desire to create a new department, and the Creature Rights Division was born. Harry, of course, wasted no time in encouraging Hermione to apply, and didn’t hold back in his recommendation of her to the man who would be leading the department. It all had worked out beautifully, and it meant he got to see her on a regular basis. Though they worked in different parts of the building, they made time for each other, most notably with these weekly lunch dates.
She looked at him almost sadly. “I won’t tell them. And I’ll make sure the gossip mill doesn’t spread it, to the best of my abilities. But you’re opening a box you can’t close back up again, Draco. I hope you know what you’re doing.”
, though, something that his inferior human nose could not yet detect. He decided to trust her, keeping the swishing tip of her gray tail in sight so as not to lose his way. He also tried to take in as much of their surroundings as possible as it went by, hoping, between the two of them, that they would be able to find their way back to the path on the return trip. He wouldn’t be the first student to get lost in the forest, but, with his age and experience, having to be “rescued” by a professor would be rather embarrassing. Emilia would never let him live that down.
“Yeah, um, Muggle apartment. No fireplace,” Kyle clarified, though he didn’t know why he felt a need to explain. Clint was just sort of staring at him, and he wanted to fill the silence.
At the moment, a too-thin, sleep-deprived man with a gaunt face and red-rimmed eyes. He saw remorse, guilt, frustration, and exhaustion. And none of these things were very encouraging. But he made himself keep staring, and he asked himself, what would Draco choose to see if he were here? What would Draco point out to him that Kyle had never noticed before?
“You aren’t going to eat?” Draco asked him, noticing that Harry hadn’t even picked up his spoon yet.
“It’s been lovely, actually. Very relaxing. Ron gets on very well with my parents, thankfully, and they are really happy to have us.”
“I thought things were going really well,” Kyle said, his voice small. “What is it exactly that’s not right for you?”
“As if I would risk Khatar’s wrath for being late. Not on your life.” Harry summoned his bag and he and Draco headed out of the portrait hole.
The barmaid put Harry’s drink in front of him. He thanked her and paid, then leaned into Draco again.
“It is true,” Francesca said soberly. “Because your subject is unique by its very nature. Anyone who is passionate about Defense isn’t going to find that interest fed by another subject.”
, she told herself now as she checked her mascara for smudges. She had indulged enough, and it was time to stop. Declan would be arriving soon, and it would just be out of line for her to be thinking about her ex while on a date with someone else.
Vesper snorted. Everyone always thought she had natural charm, something she had never fully understood. “What if I don’t want them on my side?”
The foyer was dimly lit and empty save for a hostess stationed behind a black podium. She glanced up briefly as they approached.
Harry laughed. “You better believe it. My hand and I have become very intimately acquainted recently.”
As Brandon Keller, the ever-eloquent and straightforward American transfer from Ilvermorny, would say, “Dude… fuck that guy.”
“Yes,” he said. He looked at Draco’s face again and handed him the shirt. “You have flecks of blue in your eyes.”
“You said that you need to do some serious thinking, and I get that,” Ron finally continued with a sigh. “But if you’re going to do that, I need for you to do it out loud. I need to know what’s going through your head. Even when it’s hard to say or if you’re not sure about things, I want to know. I want to know what you’re thinking.”
She pulled back to look at him. “You’re right,” she said after a moment of studying his face. “Things are really going to be different now, for me.”
. That’s the point I’m trying to make, I suppose. I know how hard it is. But I also know it’s possible. Because I did it.”
“How’d you know?” he said with a wry smile. They were both quite used to Kingsley’s recruitment tactics. “I’ve just got away, and I thought I’d come by and check on Teddy, see how he’s getting on.”
Still, Lindsey’s leaving left him a little despondent for a few days, and he was already noticing how easy for him to slip into the habit of complaining about it, deciding it meant everything would be hard, that he was destined to be sad. The difference was, this time he wasn’t interested in indulging in that. Rather, he started thinking about what he could do to make work more enjoyable for himself. He had been stuck in a rut for a while, and he knew it.
Harry did, feeling the soft antique wood against his palms. Draco whispered something from behind him, and ropes appeared, wrapping around his wrists and attaching magically to the headboard. They were not the usual ones Harry saw with the
“I don’t know. I keep going back and forth about it. It feels a bit privileged to take a maternity leave when I didn’t carry the child myself. Seems a bit like cheating.”
Vesper nodded. She had thought much the same. But, it turned out, there weren’t all that many dark wizards anymore, save for some holdouts left over from the Death Eater days. And those in particular were handled by the most elite squads in the department, ones that required experience and didn't take Junior Aurors among their ranks.
He was relatively useless for the PR team meeting, but luckily he’d had the forethought to surround himself with the most competent members of the department, and they were able to work out the details of their action plan with minimal input from him. They had decided, however, that the best thing to do was to have Harry give an interview with someone from the
“Not allowed ter breed dragons o’ course,” he was saying. “That’s the on’y thing that’s a real shame abou’ the job.”
Her voice was almost normal. She almost seemed completely unfazed. To the untrained observer, she would be. But Harry knew better. For all her talk of wanting to be transparent and honest in most situations, Vesper had a particular aversion to appearing vulnerable in any way. Harry and Draco both had a tendency to cover their more uncomfortable feelings at times, but they had nothing on her. Vesper was the queen of the brave face, using jokes and a smile as misdirection so you wouldn’t be able to see what was underneath.
They sat smiling at each other for a few seconds, and it gave Harry a moment to realize just how much he
Draco wasn’t holding back, practically fucking himself on Harry’s cock, and Harry could feel the pleasure building, threatening to spill over. He knew needed to feel Draco’s orgasm around him, and soon.
“A bit dim, perhaps?” Ron asked drily. Their eyes met for a moment, amusement flitting between them as memories resurfaced, merely fond now with the distance of time.
“I’ve just got to spray them down, adjust the temperature, and leave them to themselves. They’ll do the rest.”
Harry closed the book harshly, hands trembling slightly. Maybe that’s why Draco had been so surprised about the plate levitating. Harry took a deep breath to calm himself down and reopened the book. The logical side of him was telling him to find a way to destroy the book before something bad happened to him. But the other side of him wanted to know just how powerful this book could make him, plus it could have useful information inside. Besides, it’s rude to throw away a gift. Harry opened the book to the first page and began reading.
“Oh no is right! Chubs had to fly as fast as he could in order to stay ahead of the guards. Since they were so big they were very slow and Chubs found his mum and freed her before they could catch up to him. Once he freed his mum, she breathed her fire breath on the forest and all the big, mean, red dragons died. The End.” The house-elves applauded loudly, and Draco chuckled. Before Harry could make a sarcastic comment, a loud bell chimed in the kitchen, and all the house-elves scattered to make themselves busy. Draco faced Harry, popping a biscuit in his mouth.
“Professor Potter!” A student named Alexis called as she strode purposefully into the DADA classroom, attracting the attention of her classmates and the teacher in question.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” McGonagall said, and cheers broke out at her words. “After the first-years get sorted, I have a few announcements, then the Feast will begin. Mister Jaxton Ashby is the first to be sorted,” She called several names, and Harry tried to keep up with memorizing them, but he failed rather quickly. Draco shifted in his chair when the last girl got sorted into Ravenclaw.
“Well…” Harry smelled it again, fighting off a blush. “It smells like wood, chocolate, and mint,” He glanced at Draco, then screwed the lid on the vial, extending it to Draco.
“I haven’t given you your gift,” Harry saw Draco glance between the two of them quizzically. Narcissa grabbed a book that Harry had failed to notice from the bookshelf and presented it to him.
When Harry finally looked up from the book hours later, shadows had shifted across the room and his eyes burned horribly. He dog-eared the page and tossed the book on the corner of the desk, then ran his fingers through his hair.
“Dammit, I owe her ten galleons,” Draco fished the coins out of his pocket and handed them to the Headmistress.
“Good day, Potter,” She snapped, glancing around her to make sure no one had heard their exchange. She walked out of the store quickly and Harry paid for the candies and exited out the back in search of Draco.
“One more word out of you and I’ll march down to the Ministry right now and report you for stalking and harassing,” Harry’s voice rose in volume slightly. “And as an unregistered animagus, which will cause you to lose your journaling license,”
“Everyone knows that,” Jason said. “But what about the personal you that nobody knows?” Harry took a large swig of beer.
“You are such a Slytherin-” Draco started, then cut himself off, face growing an even deeper shade of red.
“I didn’t have a great first impression?” Draco only raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t like you,” Harry said, laughing. Draco chewed his lip, appearing to be in deep thought.
“What happened to you? You look like you lost a fight with a phoenix,” Harry asked and Hermione sighed tiredly.
“Unfortunately for you guys, I have to lecture about something very boring and I almost fell asleep making the lesson plan, so humor me and at least pretend to be excited about the Unforgivables,” Harry grinned wryly as his class immediately perked up.
“He broke the last layer of the curse,” Harry said, and Ginny’s jaw dropped. “And he insists the… ahem,
“Thank you,” he said quietly and Narcissa stepped back slightly, keeping her hands on Harry’s shoulders. He flushed as she studied him with a faint smile on her face.
Draco knew instantly he’d never get used to this, feeling Harry’s lips on his own sent his mind whirling crazily. Nothing Draco had ever known felt this natural, this right. When they finally pulled away for breath, both of them grinning childishly, Draco met Harry’s wide green eyes again.
“December first. Suspect I’ll have a Christmas shift now,” Draco’s drink was dropped off and he sipped it.
“The eighth years that went back are very close now, Ron,” Hermione said gently, grabbing one of his hands to relax him.  “There weren’t very many of us, and we all agreed that the past is past and there’s nothing we could do except apologize and move on,” Harry nodded his agreement and Ron sighed. He rubbed his eyes tiredly.
“I’ve heard of it, and it’s commonly associated with cursed objects,” Hermione replied. Ron stayed quiet.
“Two hours,” Draco said. Narcissa’s brow furrowed, then she shrugged, which surprised Harry because it was such a casual movement.
“Welcome back,” Hermione said. Draco rolled his eyes playfully and opened the first book, both of them preparing for a long night.
“How was your weekend?” She asked knowingly. Harry sighed and had to fight back a sarcastic eye roll.
Harry’s attention was snapped back to reality by Ron and Hermione standing and appearing as if they were getting ready to leave. “I know you mentioned you had some errands to run, so we’ll leave you be,” Hermione said, grasping Ron’s hand as Harry nodded silently and they walked out the door together. Harry unfolded the letter and reread the contents. She has yet to mention Draco, and Harry was curious if they were on good terms after the war. Harry had never seen Draco on the occasions he’d been to the manor.
“Can we not just burn it?” Draco asked after he had finished reading the warning. Hermione shrugged.
“I’ll get out of your way,” Harry stood, feeling slightly awkward. Draco watched impassively, but Narcissa made a noise of protest, earning both of the boys’ attention back to her.
“Skeeter’s here,” Draco whispered as soon as he saw Harry. Harry’s jaw clenched and he looked around the store, trying to locate the reporter. Her back was turned to them, but she was in the next aisle over.
Harry glanced around her shoulder, glad to see that Draco had vanished. Skeeter had paled and her notebook and quill had made their way back into her purse.
“Not particularly,” Harry said, kneeling next to Draco and the giant puddle of liquid on the floor. He transfigured an abandoned quill into a rag and began helping Draco clean the mess.
It took Draco almost a full minute for his eyes to get adjusted to the bright sunlight streaming in through his bedroom window. His head was rushing but he ignored it, tossing the blanket off of him.
Jason saw Draco finally succeed in standing, and sent Harry’s desk flying at him. Draco yelped when the desk hit his leg. His leg instantly buckled under him, and he knew it was broken.
“You’re getting drunk, we should-” Harry was cut off by Jason harshly crashing their lips together. Harry froze for a second, shocked. He grabbed Jason’s shoulders and pushed him back, sending him tumbling off the couch. Harry stood quickly, stepping over Jason’s form on the floor. He swore when Jason grabbed his leg and yanked it, dragging Harry onto the floor too.
He’d been in high spirits since the book got destroyed, and his good mood had spread across the school.
“Too damn long,” Draco answered before slowly bringing their lips together in a shy kiss. Harry felt his world explode, and he tangled his hand in Draco’s hair, knowing that he’d gripe about it later.
She stayed and chatted with him for a while, and Harry was feeling much better when he left. His hands weren’t shaking anymore and he could think clearly. His mind wandered since it had nothing better to do. He wondered what McGonagall had wanted with Draco.
“At least you don’t have eleven-year-olds making goo-goo eyes at you,” Harry complained, changing the subjects. Draco’s amused smirk only got a huff from Harry.
“I just happened to see you walking into a clothing store, and then I just so happened to find myself desiring to spend time in a muggle park. How coincidental!”
“That’s one of the lectures I remember rather vividly,” Draco murmured. “That man scared me shitless already, and that stunt he pulled with that spider didn’t help,” Harry chuckled dryly.
After deciding he wanted a treacle fudge, Harry returned to the chocolate section only to find Draco staring at a random spot on the shelf, looking like he was trying to keep his temper.
He got up and headed for his dorm. Trying to think about Harry right now was just making him tired. Plus, what Hermione had said about the book was making his brain hurt. Once Draco reached his portrait, he could hear arguing on the other side of it. He hurried in, but his dorm was empty. He curiously walked towards Harry’s side, where he saw two figures yelling. Harry was one of them, and he didn’t recognize the other guy.
“Well I know, just weird for me to think about,” Harry silently agreed with him. “Would’ve put us in a good light though,”
“I wasn’t the one to actually heal, I was the one that caused the injury.” The atmosphere in the room changed from mildly bored to suddenly intrigued.
“How many house points did you take from that Alex Raas kid for swearing?” Draco asked, laughing at Harry’s dramatic reaction.
‘I am very pleased to say that she indeed does miss me, she invited me for tea the weekend before classes start. Will you be there too?’ Harry refolded the paper and flicked it at Draco, who caught it in one hand, meeting Harry’s eyes briefly before opening it. Harry’s attention was snapped back to the lecture when he heard McGonagall mention ‘defense against the dark arts’.
“I’m coming back here later when I actually have muggle money,” Draco said, putting a box back on the shelf. Harry picked it back up.
“I don’t want to run into Jason. He works at three Broomsticks,” Draco dropped Harry’s arm quickly, looking over the top of Harry’s arm in mild alarm
Draco watched Harry read through a book, but it seemed like he wasn’t actually attempting to read it. After a few minutes, Draco decided he wasn’t going to continue to torture himself any longer by watching him.
“Professor, what’s Amortentia smell like to you?” Harry looked at the girl in surprise, noticing her clutching a small vial of liquid close to her chest.
“I didn’t mention this to the other staff members, but since we had to move your two classrooms, we don’t have enough staff dormitory bathrooms. You two will have separate sleeping quarters but will have to share a bathroom,” In Harry’s opinion, she appeared to be half remorseful, half mischievous. He glanced at Draco, who had an ‘I told you so’ expression on his face.
“We’re teenagers too,” Harry whispered back. Draco pulled his hand off Harry’s knee, and Harry instantly missed it. McGonagall finally walked in, a crowd of tiny eleven-year-olds following her. Excited conversations broke out, but they all fell silent when the Sorting Hat appeared.
“Almost noon,” Harry replied, brushing the hair out of Draco’s eyes. “And I actually thought you’d be an early bird,”
“I don’t mind teaching you at all, but it’s a very long lesson and it’s basically impossible to accomplish it all in one day,” Harry said. “You’ll need to be at a mental center with yourself and the more frustrated you get, the more difficult it becomes,”
“Harry,” McGonagall stood and strode toward him, gripping him in a hug as soon as she reached him. “I’m very pleased to inform you all that Mr. Potter has agreed to teach defense against the dark arts,” The other teachers applauded enthusiastically, and McGonagall sent him a proud glance.
“No, I didn’t. It was dark and I was slightly more focused on not getting killed,” Harry said, knowing Slughorn would chuckle and say something along the lines of “that’s ‘m boy,”
Thinking about healing spells made Harry’s mind go back to Draco, and it was difficult for him to get through the lecture without saying something he didn’t mean to, He kept thinking about the stark absence of the healer when Harry was getting discharged. He still felt a pang of guilt about how he’d behaved, and seeing Draco’s completely shattered expression twisted Harry’s heart.
Harry held Teddy on his hip while the toddler focused on changing his hair color to jet black. Andromeda had a ‘family emergency’, as she explained to Harry in a hurry. Not even Molly had been able to watch the poor kid, so Harry and Draco had to trade-off with Teddy-duty between classes.
“Uh, well, I can do simple spells like that-” He didn’t finish the sentence, face burning. Draco was still staring at him with that incredulous expression on his face. “What?” Harry snapped.
“I’m fine, just shaken up,”  Draco glanced at Harry’s neck and raised an eyebrow. Harry sighed. “He did that while I was trying to summon my wand,” Draco blinked but didn’t say anything else on the matter until he was satisfied with his cleaning job of Harry’s arm.
Finally, the two were walking the all too familiar path to Hogsmeade. The sun shone brightly overhead, drawing many students out of the castle and in various spots across the black lake and courtyard.
“It’s not like Draco knows Harry talks to his mum that much,” Ron’s face flushed at the fact that Hermione had used the ferret’s first name.
“Mind if I chat for a while? I’ve been bored all day,” Harry glanced around the restaurant, which was more empty than Harry initially realized.
“Maybe,” Harry said innocently, closing his eye again. He heard Draco snort a laugh, and they remained in silence for a while before Harry fell asleep on Draco’s leg.
“Woah, Hermione, slow down a second. What’s going on?” Draco asked sleepily. Hermione glared at him.
“I wanna go somewhere. Let’s go to Hogsmeade!” Harry stood and started looking for presentable clothes.
“Who’s owl is that?” Ron asked as soon as it had flown off. Harry, still immersed in the letter, only replied with an offhand “Narcissa’s.” As soon as he realized what he said, he slapped his hand over his mouth and looked up to see Hermione and Ron staring at him.
“That wasn’t necessary,” Harry said once they left the shop. Draco grabbed the bag from Harry and started to dig around in it for his chocolate.
“If we both do end up being heads of houses, Quidditch matches sure will be interesting,” Harry’s head snapped up at the mention of Quidditch.
“I need to stop touching things,” Harry mumbled. Draco was staring at Harry, ignoring the stinging in his hand.
“Called for me?” Another healer bustled into the room, and Draco took the now completed paperwork from the intern. “Looks like that same mystery spell as last time,” Antony announced.
He sat at his desk, tiredly running his hands through his hair. The attacker was playing with Harry, he knew that much. They could have killed Harry four times over at the least, which made Harry cringe.
“Alright, fine. When I was in sixth year I found an old copy of advanced potion-making. There were tons of notes on how to make perfect potions, and the previous owner had even created several of their own spells. I got perfect potions grades with it, and I was completely fascinated with that book, and I found a spell the owner had created that was
“The bloody hell just happened?” Harry met his eyes, trying to gauge if Draco was upset. His eyes were wide, and that was the only thing Harry could focus on.
“I’m sure you know that my annual Hallow’s eve party is coming up in a few weeks,” Slughorn finally said after a stretch of silence.
Well, this is the final chapter! Don't worry, I've almost finished an epilogue for you guys because I couldn't leave out Teddy.
“You don’t know that for sure though, plus it would be in your best interests to get some sunlight, you vampire,” Harry finally found the shirt he was looking for and put it on.
“If he comes near your desk, make sure he doesn’t fall, please,” Harry said. “I’ve pretty much given up on this lecture,” A small group of students immediately made their way to the floor, forming a big half-circle around Teddy, who was delighted by the new attention.
“Are you going to file a report?” Harry shook his head silently. “Okay, but if this guy ever tried to lay a finger on you again, I’ll hex his balls off,”
“The hell just happened?” Draco asked. Harry took in a shaky breath and sat next to Draco. He pulled out his wand and healed Draco’s leg before he said anything.
In the end, most of his class got the concept fairly easily, and he dismissed them, relishing in the silence of an empty classroom. His head was pounding, and the ache in his lungs still hadn’t left, but he ignored it and reached for the small bottle of firewhiskey he’d stashed under his desk.
“Harry,” Teddy whined, dragging out the end of Harry’s name for an impressive amount of time. When he determined he had received Harry’s undivided attention, he pointed at the floor. Harry sighed and put Teddy on the floor, helping him balance while he got used to supporting his own weight.
“What was that, Malfoy?” She set the book on the table and flipped it open, brows furrowed in confusion when she saw a handwritten note in the front cover. “Merlin left a warning in this book,” She whispered.
“No that’s not right,” Harry mumbled to himself. He swore softly when he bumped into a desk as her name popped into his head.  “Stormi,” Harry’s footsteps echoed down the hall, but he found himself in the kitchen quickly. Stormi appeared again, teeming with joy as she brought him a plate piled high with treacle tarts.
Of course, Harry was in the shower when Draco arrived. Draco knocked on the door to let Harry know he was there, a system they had established earlier. The water shut off right as Draco finished brushing his teeth, and Harry stepped out wearing pajama pants and a towel slung over his shoulder. That was definitely new and unexpected, but very much appreciated.
