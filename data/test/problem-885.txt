The students turned around at the noise. Then with wide eyes, ran over to him.
It’s definitely a surprise when he hears the floo roar loudly from downstairs. It shouldn’t be possible to hear it, but the house was always a little too quiet when Malfoy was at work.
“No! No, thank you. You’re a great healer, and you don’t treat me differently like the ones I had before.”
“You still have time,” Harry quickly responded. “The NEWTs are this year, sure, but the year has only just started.”
“Oh, you usually keep it unlocked. The wards are strong, and this part of London has a low theft rate.” Ron smiles at Harry. “Besides, there is the usual
“How did that work out, with all the sand from the beach?”
Just before they left, Ron turned around. “Oh, Harry. Kingsley wants to talk to you at some point. Send him a message whenever you’re free. Don’t leave him too long though, you know how he is.”
There was so much movement. The trees danced with the wind. It was like a farm, but it wasn’t cows or horses that resided on the fields. It was thestrals and hippogriffs, blast ended skrewts and flobberworms. There were animals of all different kinds.
Harry was a mess. This Harry right now was a pure mess.
“Thank you, Minerva.”
A thought came into his head, and he asked the question before he realised it. “How do you two handle a relationship with your high role jobs?”
He couldn’t handle it.
“Stop it!” He shouted.
“Guess I have to. I mean, I’ve recovered pretty well,” Harry answered, just as carefully.
Harry wasn’t feeling cold at all but nodded anyway. Neville held tightly onto Nott and Goyle’s hands, and dragged them into the bar as Harry followed behind.
“-don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m drowning. I’m worried sick. I’m trying to hide it so he doesn’t worry. There’s already enough on his plate, but I’m so worn out. I don’t know what to do. What if he doesn’t like me anymore? What if he remembers but realises he doesn’t love me anymore?”
“Harry?” Malfoy’s voice was thick with sleep. “You okay?”
A chance! Harry grabbed it before it could get away. Somewhere deep inside, he knew Parkinson was scared and worried, waiting for some sort of sign that Harry would turn them away like he did in Hogwarts.
They appeared in a place Harry didn’t recognise. It wasn’t Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, nor was it any of the wizarding places he knew.
“No problem.”
Malfoy stared at Harry, scanning him. For the first time since, Harry felt a hint of the Draco Malfoy he remembered from school. Cool and calculating, observing and ready to strike. Then Malfoy’s face dropped as he sighed.
Lavender came around once to check on him, but left as soon as she realised he was in ‘the zone,’ as she called it.
She froze, and began to pack her notes. Her head was kept down, again avoiding Harry’s eyes. “I realised too late that I wanted a career in potions.”
Goyle and Neville didn’t pay any mind, but Harry just looked in confusion.
He closed his eyes and took a moment to think of Hedwig, and if she was okay where pets go after they die. He thought of an owlery, or an open forest filled with all the mice and owl treats they’d want. He imagined Hedwig making friends and flying so far into the sky she could almost touch it.
“Is it true?” Ron asked, voice dripping with fear and a hint of hope.
But Ron’s face was pleading, almost begging, for Harry to agree.
“Hello, Harry. My, you’ve changed, haven’t you?” Her voice was as wispy as he remembered.
That was a shot in the dark. No one mentioned it was on a beach, and there were no photos or anything of that event. All he heard was how the Weasley’s and Draco got terribly sunburnt. It was a guess, and Harry knew that he was testing his luck.
“That you’d be happy for me?” Harry shrugged as he watched the papers move from one side to another. “That you’d understand that I need to have a job? That I enjoy being in the aurors? I don’t know.”
This is an environment that both of them knew very well. Harry wanted to go back into work, wanted to be back on the field, regardless of what that small voice in his head was saying.
They continued on like that, talking about Draco Malfoy slowly turning into talking about things they missed at the celebration in the Burrow.
*****
“No, you didn’t.” Malfoy pushed on. “Merlin, Pansy told me something was going on with you.”
“You’re going to be released in 3 days, Harry.” Hermione started.
“Okay.”
Malfoy looked at Harry, really looked. Like some sort of him was surprised Harry had caught on so quick to that part of him, but Harry could definitely see why he does what he does.
He slowly stepped back from the window, allowing himself to indulge in the sight and breathe in the fresh air before turning around to face the task at hand. The wind must’ve been a lot stronger than he thought because it looked like a tornado had came through. The papers on his desk now scattered across the floor, several folders and books on the shelves had opened up. He rubbed his face and groaned.
“Professor Longbottom, sir.” The class chimed.
“Y’know Harry, I was so worried about it at first. How could I have such intense feelings for both of them? How could it work? But it did, and it is, and I love it.”
Tina laughed and it echoed down the empty hall. “That’s what you said before. Even without your memories, you’re still you.”
“How did you-”
That day he spent at his desk, making sure all the details were ingrained in his head. He only got up for the occasional hit of coffee.
A flutter of wings and a soft hoot brought him back to the real world. Isolt perched on the window sill, a letter tied to her foot. Harry walked over, and pet her gently. In time he knew he’d get used to having an owl again, and that somewhere deeply hidden in his mind was a reason he bought another.
Speaking of, he sneaks a glance to Ron in his auror robes. It was filled with tatters and patches, like it was repaired too often to hold with magic anymore. Which was weird because they only bought the new auror robes a year ago.
“Harry?”
“Don’t tell me I’m wrong,” Kingsley added. “Don’t make it harder.”
Harry just nodded. Malfoy set down the big bowl of pasta in the middle of the table. It looked amazing, and his wonder for how Malfoy cooked just increased.
“Harry, it’s Draco Malfoy.” She whispered.
In frustration and a pang of jealousy, he turned fast. Which, of course, resulted in him crashing into another person. The room’s floor was covered in newspapers. Once he got his bearings, he helped the person pick them up.
And with that and a hot cup of tea, he started walking out. He didn’t miss the chorus of ‘bye’ and ‘come back soon’ from all of the workers. He waved at them before going through the door.
Harry wiped away the tears on his cheek and nodded. He felt better, the pep talk really helped. He was so glad to vent it all out too, all his worries and fears this far into the recovery. His physical body was fine now, it was just his mind left.
Maybe he would’ve greeted them like the good friends they used to be.
“Harry, is it a good time to ask why Isolt is still on your head?”
Malfoy was not in the house, by what he could hear. There was no humming or cooking or noises from anywhere but the scrape of his spoon against the plate. Not that he cared though.
When Harry was on his 3rd butterbeer, he felt himself finally loosen up. His auror observations were still strong, so he kept his mind on high alert. He would grab the memories of old Harry whether he liked it or not, he needed to feel the friendship he had with these two people.
Harry's heart ached even more. Hagrid had been there for so much, just like Minerva. They’d been such strong and stable pieces in his lives. Even now, with his memory gone, he knew they both supported his decisions, from dating Malfoy to moving out.
“Am I?” Malfoy put down the spoon, the food long forgotten. “I’ve had weeks of knowing your memory is gone. Since the first day, I knew you’d forgotten,” His voice cracked. “Us.... Every day we’ve spent together as friends and more just gone because one single raid had gone wrong. I spent days crying. Hermione and Ron had to come over and make sure I ate every day, did you know?”
He turned and saw some of the third years from the Care of Magical Creatures class along with other house students looking up at him with curious eyes.
Too riled up to pack the pictures back in their boxes, he near-sprinted upstairs to the table. He needed to get his memories back, no matter what. For Teddy, for Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Malfoy… But most of all for himself. There was too much tightness, too much tension in every movement, every word he’s said since he woke up.
“Yep. If he is up to your standards for auror training, then I believe he’ll be okay.” Tina took a sip from her cup. “However, Harry, you should be careful. Don’t make another mistake like that. You’ve been in St Mungo’s too many times, even if you don’t remember it.”
“Don’t you think, Harry?” Hermione asked, cutting through Harry’s thoughts.
“Thank you,” He told her gratefully. “Do you know why Kingsley brought me here, by the way?”
The waitress, Lara, laughed wistfully. “Yeah, it really blew up. Despite it being busier, I’m enjoying it a lot more.”
Not to mention Neville’s words of warning, borderline on a threat, but knowing he meant well. It was difficult and it didn’t make Harry feel any better. He knew he’d probably keep going with it.
Malfoy finally caught his breath, still laughing here and there in small bursts, but finished all the same.
He turned his head and looked at Malfoy who was eyeing all of the guests. For a heartbreaking second, Harry thought Malfoy was on bad terms with everyone. Then he realised that he was reminding them of something. Harry looked back around at how nonchalant everyone was acting.
Harry looked down at his shirt, and saw the deep dried stains of the inkwell he exploded earlier. He cursed internally, but left it. He’d spell it clean later. Harry didn’t notice the shared glance between Pansy and Blaise.
He worked quickly and efficiently, and never failed to wish them a good day, even if they were rude or disrespectful. Even with the new influx of customers, Malfoy seemed to work just as he did the first time Harry visited.
For the first time in a long time, Harry woke up before Malfoy did. In fact, he woke up before the sun even started peeking out of its covers. Everything was silent. The house didn’t make a single sound, no creaks from the wind or scutters of rats.
“He loves his work.” Neville’s voice had admiration laced into every letter, each syllable was dripping with amazement.
Harry didn’t know how to feel about that. Usually, he’d just leave the place himself. But Malfoy looked at him like this promise was the most important thing in the world to him. Harry nodded.
Time must have passed as he stood there with Isolt. Both were simply enjoying each other’s presence so much that Harry did not hear the floo roar at all. So when Malfoy walked in, coat in hand and leaning on the doorway. Neither Harry, nor Isolt noticed.
“We can start with what you two are doing now?”
He whipped his head back, determined to solve this damn case so he could be back there with them. Then it crumbled down into rubble as he remembered just how frustrating the case was.
Neville watched as Harry called out his house and threw the powder to the ground. Dark green flames swirled over Harry’s vision until it became one he was more familiar with.
“Draco.” Draco replied absently, still thinking about Harry’s outrageously girly squeak.
“No, I don’t think I will. You see, we’re all alone here, and I can finally teach you a lesson.” Ron practically purred at him, his sneer turning into a malicious smirk. Harry did the one thing he could think to do, he opened his mouth and screamed as loud as humanely possible. Ron released one of the hands on Harry’s robes to clamp it over Harry’s mouth, stifling the scream somewhat, although the scream still could be heard to those nearby. Ron shoved Harry to the ground and pinned him down, pulling his wand from his pocket and aiming at Harry.
Harry nodded, and hoped that she understood his silent ‘thank you’ before snatching a dinner roll and running up the stairs as fast as he could. He could hear them all settling down at the table to eat and he breathed a sigh of relief as he tore his roll in half. He pushed one half of it into Hedwig’s cage, and despite the fact that it wasn’t her usual food, she devoured it within a few seconds of it being given to her. Harry, on the other hand, tore his piece into smaller bites and ate slowly, savouring the small bit of food he had been given. The roll was warm and soft, and Harry felt as if he could eat at least twenty of them. The roll didn’t really alleviate any of the hunger Harry had been feeling, but he still felt better after eating it nonetheless. He laid down on his bed after he finished eating, staring up at the ceiling.
“It’s good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley. I’ll go put my stuff upstairs now.” He said politely, gathering his luggage once again.
“I would have figured that there’d be a magical way for homosexual couples to have kids, since you know, there’s magic here?”
“Even if I was… upset with you for saving me last night, I…” Harry paused, looking down, “Thank you.” He mumbled.
“Well, it basically creates a space in a male’s body, so they can conceive like a woman would. It’s still a lot harder for them to conceive and there’s a lot more risks involved. But it can be done and have the entire thing go smoothly, it’s just rare for there to be no complications.”
About two hours into Harry’s nap, the compartment door slid open, the bright light from outside waking Harry. Harry blinked a few times, his eyes focusing on the person in the doorway. The figure stepped in, and Harry’s eyes adjusted, and he could clearly make out who was standing before him. Draco Malfoy had stepped into the compartment, wearing his pristine robes with a shiny Prefect’s badge positioned proudly on one side. He held his wand in one hand, and his trunk in the other. He rolled his eyes at Harry. “Care to move your bird cage off the other seat? I’ve got no where else to sit.” Draco said, boredom in his voice. He had grown weary of Pansy and Blaise’s bickering, but all of the other compartments had been full, or containing annoying first years.
“Let go of me. I have to do this.” Harry’s voice cracked as he spoke and he sniffed, trying to not completely melt down in front of Draco.
“I didn’t know! You’re not exactly very vocal about your opinions.” She pouted.
“It’s good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley. May I let Hedwig out? She’s desperate to go hunting.” Harry replied, lifting his hand that held Hedwig’s cage.
“I’ve been alright. My summer has been like usual. I couldn’t let Hedwig out so I wasn’t able to send many letters.” Harry shrugged.
Petunia was standing in the kitchen, busying herself with taking care of her plants sitting on the window sill. She turned as Harry entered the kitchen, even his quiet footsteps were not quiet enough to escape her attention. Harry wasn’t scared of her as he was with Vernon, but he knew better than to make a mistake in front of her, because she’d have no choice but to tell Vernon. While Vernon hated Harry from the day they had discovered him on the front steps,  Petunia felt a small, practically miniscule bond towards the boy, as that was her sister’s son, and even though she’d been extremely jealous of Lily and her abilities, she still held admiration and respect for her younger sister. Petunia knew she couldn’t shield Harry from Vernon, but she could do her best to at least show him a little care, albeit not enough to cause a huge impact in Harry’s life. Vernon would have caught on, and Petunia shuddered to think about how that would go over. Bringing herself back to the present, Petunia gestured to the small slip of paper on the counter. “There are the chores I need completed. Vernon would like a beef stew for dinner, so you should have that prepared around six.” She said, not unkindly. Harry exchanged a glance with her, a mutual understanding for what would happen if dinner wasn’t prepared on time. “Yes, Aunt Petunia, I’ll start on these right away.” He replied politely, and she gave him an uneasy smile before shooing him out of the kitchen.
“You? Gay? I thought you and Parkinson were a thing!” Harry exclaimed, causing Draco to laugh.
Flashback begins
“You’re on You-Know-Who’s side! You’re helping him!” Ron continued shouting, his actions that of a raving lunatic. Harry did not reply, he only shrunk back on his bed, the feeling of hurt creeping through him.
“Hurry up and take him. We haven’t got time to chat with your lot,” Vernon hissed bitterly.
After finishing his lunch, and helping Molly clean up the remaining dishes despite her insistence that she could do it on her own, Harry made his way up to Ron’s room. Molly had told him that only Ron and Ginny were currently home, although the twins would be arriving in the evening to stay for the week, so they could see Harry. The walk to Ron’s room seemed to take forever, and Harry was dreading whatever Ron would say to him. The last thing Ron had said before summer break had not been pleasant in the slightest, and the lack of communication for the whole summer was definitely not a good sign. He knocked hesitantly on Ron’s door, and upon the hollered “come in!”, he pushed the door open and stepped inside.
Draco grabbed his coat and an umbrella from next to the door and rushed out of his flat, not even bothering to open the umbrella. In his left hand was a bouquet of roses, which he had purchased the night before, knowing today he’d not have the strength to do anything other than visit Harry.
“A lot of shouting…”
“Potter, what the hell were you doing?” Draco asked quietly, not letting go of Harry for fear he would run back to the edge and throw himself off. Harry remained silent, still struggling to free himself from Draco’s arms.
“I don’t even know what I’m doing!” Harry exclaimed, laughing.
“I want to break up with him, but I don’t know how. He’s a nice guy and I don’t want to like, crush him or anything.”
“Go on. You’ve probably heard some pretty horrible things about my life, share something of yours.” Harry prodded.
“Yeah well, you’re my friend and I can’t exactly ask Luna for help with this so you’re just going to have to help me. I’d ask Hermione but whenever she comes over she’s too busy sucking face with Ron to have any time for anything else, and it’s not something I want to say in a letter.” Ginny wrinkled her nose in disgust.
“I’m going to go change. Lunch is on the table, by the way.” Harry said, straightening up and leaving the room. Fred and George made eye contact.
“What is ‘you know’?” Harry quirked an eyebrow at her.
I'm sure you're aware of how it's formatted by now.
“Y’know, since we’re going to have to share a room and all, I think we should call a truce.” Harry said.
“Can’t you just let me vent to you? C’mon, don’t make me have to repeat this all to Hermione because you couldn’t get it together to help me.” She sat up, crossing her legs. Harry sighed and nodded, motioning for her to continue.
“I-I didn’t mean to, it was like magic!” Harry managed to exclaim between groans of pain. This was very clearly the wrong thing to say, as Vernon grew more enraged by the mention of magic. Vernon yanked open Harry’s cupboard and flung him inside, slamming him against the back of the cupboard, leaving him crumpled, bleeding on the floor. “THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC!” Vernon screamed, slamming the cupboard closed.
“Generally speaking. Most cases of homophobia are found from when pure-blood parents only have one heir to carry on the family line, since obviously homosexual couples can’t reproduce the way straight couples can. Then sometimes you get half-bloods or mud-bloods who start spreading their homophobia to more accepting wizards and witches, but that doesn’t happen often” Draco explained.
“I thought I told you to keep that bloody bird quiet! We take you in, out of the goodness in our hearts, and you repay us with your absolute
“Two more questions. How long have you been here, and did Pomfrey tell you anything?” Harry asked, his voice gaining some of his usual confidence.
Draco shook as he spoke, both with cold and his sobs.
“Well? Nothing to say? That’s what I thought.” Ron laid back down on his bed, opening up his Quidditch magazine and resuming it where he had left off. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and left the room, closing the door behind him. He took a shaky breath, subconsciously noticing that the conversation downstairs had come to halt. Twin pops came from either side of him and he found himself squished between Fred and George, both wearing identical expressions of confusion. They looped their arms through Harry’s and began walking down the stairs.
After tossing his dirty clothes into his bag, he made his way down to the kitchen. Ron and the twins were already at the table. Ron shot him a glare as he sat down, but he paid him no attention, instead grabbing a cheese toastie for himself and digging in. A few minutes later, Ginny arrived, and the five of them ate in silence for a while, although it wasn’t uncomfortable or awkward. Harry wondered briefly if this was what it was like to be a sibling in a family. Sure, the twins called him their little brother, and Ginny treated him like an older brother, but he knew he didn’t truly belong in their family. The rest of the day passed uneventfully, with everyone going off to do their own thing for the afternoon.
The rain was only drizzling for now, but the muggle weatherman had predicted it to be raining horribly by late morning, and as much as Draco didn’t want to be out in the rain, he couldn’t bear the thought of staying inside today.
“You bet!” Harry called after her. He cleared his plate from the table and set it in the sink. Molly refused to let Harry do any of the dishes, she’d nearly had a cow when Harry dutifully began washing each and every dish after dinner the first night he was there. After feeling like he’d cleaned up the table enough, he raced up the stairs and threw on a pair of his better fitting trousers and a shirt that miraculously had only a tiny hole near the collar. Fred and George were still passed out in their beds, completely undisturbed by Harry tearing through the place like a mad man.
Drarry
“I was… I was…” Harry was at a loss for words.
A/N: SO! The first chapter is always a bit rough to write, but I think it’s alright. It moves a bit quickly since nothing can really start until the Weasleys come to get Harry. There will be a lot heavier stuff covered so please, if the bit that I’ve written in this chapter upsets you, please stop reading. I want all my readers happy! Much love to you all, and don’t forget to vote and comment!

Draco couldn’t stop the trembling in his hands as he walked through the cemetery to the back, where Harry’s grave was, under a tall willow tree. Draco had requested that spot, paying extra to get his way, since he knew that Harry would have loved to be surrounded by nature.
To Hagrid, I leave my owl, Hedwig. I know he’ll take good care of her.
“Why is he holding a grudge?”
A/N: Before I get into this chapter I’d like to announce the ships that will be featured (eventually) in this fic! If you’re uninterested then you can just get right into reading the chapter!
“Alright, get those supply lists out, let’s see where we need to start.” Molly said, not unkindly, but with a firm tone in her voice. They stood just inside the entrance to Diagon Alley, looking rather scatter-brained despite going through the same drill every year.
“See! You aren’t denying it! It’s true!” Ron screamed at him, throwing his Quidditch magazine into Harry’s face. At that moment there were two pops, and the twins appeared in Ron’s room.
“You deserve this for what you did at the zoo today.” Vernon took a pocket knife out and began carving a word into Harry’s skin, which Harry would later find out was the word ‘worthless’.
Whispered Words – A Drarry Fic
The memories faded from view as Harry screamed awake, tears streaming down his face. He sat up, pulling his knees to his chest and rocking back and forth, a steady stream of tears coursing down his face. He checked his watch. 6:30 am. He didn’t have enough time to go back to sleep, even if he wanted to. He stood and grabbed a clean set of robes from his trunk before going to the bathroom and turning on the shower. Merlin, he felt so dirty. The memory of that day when he was nine stuck in his mind as he showered, making him shudder with disgust. He got out of the shower and dressed quickly, making sure to avoid his reflection in the mirror before getting dressed. He hated the sight of himself without clothing, it always triggered more memories of incidents with his uncle. He pushed his memories aside and began thinking about his classes for the day. He had double Potions with the Slytherins in the morning, then in the afternoon he had Charms and Transfiguration.
“Do you want to go back to our room then?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded gratefully. He was positive he wouldn’t be able to manage classes today, and in the back of his head he groaned at all of the work he’d have to catch up on. Draco and Harry made their way back to their room, leaving a grumbling Ron behind. Ron had grumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “queers” as the two walked away, but Draco had chosen to ignore it. Harry seemed like he would pass out at any moment, and Draco felt the strange need to care for him.
Harry laid on his lumpy mattress in his room on Number Four, Privet Drive. It was a hot and humid August day, and Dudley was out with his gang, Petunia and Vernon were out having a nice lunch date, giving Harry no reason to get up and do something.  He stared at the ceiling, a cold feeling deep in the pit of his stomach. He’d been feeling that way a lot lately, but he usually could ignore it as he did chores and yard work. Today, however, he was alone with the strange cold feeling and he didn’t know what to do with it. He was beginning his 6th year at Hogwarts soon, a time where he should have his career picked out and a clear idea of where he wanted to go in life, yet he had never felt more unsure of himself. He stood and stretched, shaking his messy black hair out of his face and beginning to pack for school. He still had an entire month to wait before school started, but somehow the Weasley’s managed to get permission to pick him up for a week before for school shopping. Harry could not wait for the opportunity to get out of Privet Drive, he hadn’t been able to leave all summer.
It is a well-known fact that Harry Potter is a Parselmouth, but what can we interpret from that? The gift of Parselmouth is often associated with the house of Slytherin, which can be linked to people like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. While Potter is in the house of Gryffindor, we have a source that has informed us that he was almost placed in Slytherin. “In second year, when we first found out he could talk to snakes, he told us that the hat almost put him in Slytherin. At first, we thought nothing of it, but now we can clearly see he should have been there all along,” Our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, said with a shudder. It’s clear Potter has fooled many of his peers.
“We heard our little Ronnikins being a prat, don’t worry though, you’ll always be our favourite little brother.” Fred said, breaking the silence between them.
Reminder that this was formatted for Wattpad. Also AO3 is confusing me.
Whispered Words – A Drarry Fic
“Oh.” Harry replied, unsure what to say. Thankfully, Pomfrey continued the conversation.
“It’s fine, I was done anyway.” He said, his expression softening. He left the bathroom without another word. Ginny gave him a curious look as he left.
Romione
“Hello Mr. Weasley… it’s a… pleasure to see you again.” Petunia weakly attempted a formal greeting.
“Heeey, little brother, where have you been?” Fred called as soon as Harry stepped into the room. Both Fred and George were bent over a desk, one of their inventions dismantled and spread across the surface.
For the first couple of months after Harry’s death, Draco had convinced himself that he was dreaming, and that it had all been a terrible nightmare. He’d spend hours trying various ways to ‘wake up’, wanting to finally escape this endless nightmare.
Draco wished for the day he could visit Harry without crying. He knew Harry wouldn’t want him to be so torn up, but he felt as if his heart had been torn out and put in a blender.
“Ron said he’s been writing, could you have sent something back with Pigwidgeon?”
“Alright, if you insist. Now let’s get you some food, I’m sure you’re hungry after being in the car for so long.” She began bustling around the kitchen, all her cheerful, motherly energy returned. Harry took the spot he usually sat in whenever he stayed at the Burrow and within minutes, a plate of sandwiches was placed in front of him. With a flick of her wand, Molly set a glass of water down in front of him as well.
“No, sir. I haven’t heard from him except for a letter on my birthday.” Harry replied, looking out the window.
A/N: This chapter sucks, but I wrote it while I was busy with my cousins, so it was hard to focus on it, I just wanted to get a chapter done, since I want to get to the good bits of the story! Next chapter won’t be as fluffy so be prepared for some minor (or major? We’ll see) angst. To clarify, this won’t be an mpreg, but I find it hard to believe that the Wizard World wouldn’t have a way for homosexuals to reproduce, so that’s why I included that bit from Draco. Before I go, I’d just like to say thank you, thank you, thaaaaank youuuuuuuuuu for nearly 200 reads on Wattpad and nearly 1000 reads on AO3! It makes me so so happy to have people reading what I write, and I love interacting with everyone!
The next day, Molly woke them all up bright and early to head into Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies. They Flooed over to The Leaky Cauldron for a quick breakfast before starting their long day of shopping. Fred and George tagged along, mostly just to bug their mother all day long while she tried to keep Ron and Ginny on their best behaviour.
“It’s just… that’s quite an interesting outfit you have on.” Draco’s eyes went up and down Harry’s body, or well, what he could see from where he was standing, seeing as Harry was half-way hidden by the couch. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Excuse me, Uncle Vernon.” Harry started, trying to keep his tone as polite and respectful as possible.
Draco wanted nothing more than to go back in time and stop Harry from doing it. But no amount of hoping and wishing and battling with himself internally would change reality. He remembered stumbling to Pansy and Hermione’s flat several months after Harry had died, drunk and sobbing uncontrollably. No matter how many times Pansy tried to console him, he’d cry harder and manage to choke out a “When will this end? Why can’t he come back?” To which Pansy would always reply with “I don’t know, darling, I really don’t know.”
“Can’t you just talk to me one m-more time?! I’m going c-crazy!”
A/N: This was a long chapter and it took me ages to write and I’m not that happy with it but I’m posting it anyways since I need to get on with this story. I’ve sped up Draco and Harry befriending each other so they’ll have some pure moments before they start realizing their true feelings :’) Some of the characters that have gone against Harry will come back to support him for the sake of the ships that I want to feature! Anyways, I leave for the beach quite soon, so I’ll be trying to update as much as possible during that week, but we’ll see how it goes. I’m also planning far ahead in this story, so I know where I want to go but I’m not sure if I’ll ever eventually include smut or if I’ll not include that but oh wellllllll. Thank you for the nearly 100 reads on Wattpad, and the nearly 500 reads on AO3!
“It’s so good to see you, Harry, but you are far too thin still.” Molly stated, not unkindly.
“Where are my bloody pajama bottoms?!” Harry shrieked, his voice high-pitched. Draco covered his mouth to stifle his laugh at the shrillness of Harry’s voice. Pomfrey waved her wand and the bottoms appeared and she passed them to Harry, who slid them on while still under the blanket.
“I believe he was sexually abused, or, well, raped from the looks of the damage.” She said in a rush. As much as she was trying to remain professional, Harry was dear to her. It was hard to not grow fond of him, seeing as he ended up in the Infirmary nearly every week. Harry had a great sense of humor and he liked to chat with Pomfrey while she gave him any potions that he needed. She’d had absolutely no idea of anything that had gone on in his life, but she still felt guilty for having it come to this. How had she missed the signs?
Draco could feel the muggles staring at him oddly as he walked down the street. He supposed he did look a bit out of place, his eyes and nose red and puffy from crying, his umbrella at his side despite the rain steadily falling, and the bouquet of roses clutched in his hand.
Whispered Words – A Drarry Fic
“Yes, your stuff has been brought to the new room by several house elves. Should anything be missing, you are permitted to return to your old sleeping to find whatever is missing.” She replied as she collected the empty potions bottles from Harry. Harry started to get out of bed before looking down at his legs and shrieking, pulling the blanket tightly around his waist.
"Sorry sorry, you just.." Harry began to calm down, giggles subsiding. "You just remind me of my Aunt Petunia's grumpy old cat. A real feral little thing."
Draco gasped. "Excuse me? What do you know of my tastes?" He crossed his arms in annoyance.
Hermione rolled her eyes in tandem and decided to just say, "Hello Draco, how are you doing today?" She was the polite one out of the group, the only one Draco had any inkling of respect for. She would've made a wonderful Slytherin, he thinks.
"I refuse to become slave to anything that causes a person to become like that," he replies, pointing subtly at a girl and her dance partner who were laughing in a bubbly fashion, the young lady practically draping herself against him and refusing to let up. "If I ever become that clingy, please take me to the farm and put me out of my misery like a lame horse."
"Oh no, you two are a match made in heaven. Both of you are as hard-headed and stubborn as the next. You'd keep yourselves endless amused." Hermione stopped Draco and whipped him around. "He's quite fit as well, no? Very strong~ I bet having those grand biceps cornering you and pinning you down would be quite exhilarating no?" She wagged her eyebrows as she spoke in hushed tones. Draco's thoughts fluttered back to the memory of Harry pinning him back, speaking to him in a hurried tone, tugging him closer and Draco remembers his knees growing weak and his throat growing dry and-
We're starting to get a little spicy folks ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"May I have this dance?"
"Malfoy!" Harry gasped out, fingers curling into a fist, white knuckled and red palmed. "I...I need a housekeeper."
Slowly, Harry pulled away. Draco's eyes fluttered open and his pupils were wide as he tried to catch his breath.
And then there was Harry Potter. Draco could make out only one word from his lips as he stared on at him, eyes never wavering.
"What are you two doing here?? And why is he back??"
"Oh? That? Well, I learned it quite young as a way to convince my father of pretty much… anything?" Draco smirked sheepishly, hands coming down to undo his parka and place it next to him. The warmth of the fireplace was making him overheat in his new downy coat.
He clutched onto Draco's hand and relished in its warmth as they climbed up the winding staircases towards the second floor, into the darkness and away from the joyous noise. Soon, the two found themselves alone and in silence, rows of doors lined the walls and Draco smiled back at Harry so brightly it seemed to be the only light source nearby. He was led to the last door at the end of the hall, a grand white double door with golden knobs. A swish of Draco's pretty hand and suddenly the door unlocked and opened, the blond walking confidently through them. "Welcome to Chez Draco," he giggled, another swish of the fingers and the lights turned on to a beautiful warm glow. Draco's room was exactly what Harry would have imagined it to be: white, grand, and princessy. The bed had a lace canopy shrouding it with a matching white dresser to the side, a plush couch and coffee table in the middle, and a grand balcony that led to an open veranda. Truly a bedroom fit for the blonde. Harry walked around the room in curiosity, taking every little detail in, wiping his fingertips across each piece.
"I'll be sure to do that. Come on now guys, before all the good candy is gone." She grabbed Ron by the sleeve and forcibly dragged him away and into the store, leaving Harry with the three other Slytherin. Harry's eyes didn't leave Draco's ever-growing pink blush on his cheeks. The blonde couldn't bare looking Harry in the eyes, knowing that those deep green eyes would be staring right back at him.
"Uncle you don't have to for Harry's sake-" Draco laughed, but the man had already disappeared in a swath of black fabric, making a beeline back to the alcohol bar. Draco sighed and shook his head, "That's Uncle Severus for you, more repressed and tight than a knot." He turned up to Harry, snaking his arms into the brunette's. "Now come on, let's slip out for a bit." Harry was then whisked away from the crowd, away from the golden yellow candle lights that illuminated the rest of the Malfoy home and into the dark and cold hallways nearby.
"Whatever. Let's just drop it." Harry said as he got up and matched towards his bedroom. Hermione and Ron were left alone in the room, the sound of Harry's footsteps echoing through the room.
Harry blinked and looked away, his own skin beginning to heat up. "You're welcome," he said back gruffly, walking back into the kitchen. While the brunette fiddled around with the kettle once more, pouring himself another cup, Draco found his way to the couch, sitting down carefully. He curled up and tucked his legs under him, trying to take up as little space as possible.
"Draco-"
"What?"
"I DO NOT!"
"How did you convince him to let me stay?" Harry asked, picking up and observing the knick knacks and toys that littered Draco's room.
Harry swallowed down his anger, leaving veins in his neck to bulge and his scar to burn. Harry had wanted nothing more than to hex the man next to him; to curse him with all that he has. How could he dare to let such filth spew out from his mouth? And how dare he tell it to Harry, himself. The boy who had come to play victim to Voldemort, the boy whose parents had fallen to him and the boy who had always pined for the Malfoy child from the moment he had first seen him. It was as if Rodolphus was especially trying to get a rise out of him. As if to show the Malfoys, to show Draco, that Harry didn't belong in this world. But it wasn't as if Harry thought Draco belonged here either. The blonde wasn't anything like any of his supposed family members. If Harry had his way, he'd tell all these people to fuck off and take Draco home with him, back to the Burrow. Ron would surely have a fit and Draco would probably hiss like a scorned kitten, but at least he'd be somewhere that was devoid of miscreants such as these.
Draco frowned and shoved the glass back into Harry's hands. "I in no way attempt to be cute for your sake, Mr. Potter. Do realise that you come off as a perverted old lech when you tease me so."
I'm so sorry this update is really late, school started up again and I didn't have the chance to write. Please enjoy!! Comment if you liked the new update. ❤️
"Oh Dimitri, you wound me! How dare you assume I have an ulterior motive! Perhaps I would just like to visit my favorite person?" Draco preened like Cheshire cat, draping himself against the wall, one leg delicately brought up and showing off.
The thought of his family made Draco's heart ache. He decided not to look at the photos anymore.
Draco scoffed and let out a breathy, sarcastic chuckle. "Gentlemen?! That cad?? Trust me 'Mione, he is no gentlemen. Devilish brute more like it." Draco picked at the woolen materials, running his fingers through them absent-mindedly.
"You look like an angel."
Upon hearing about the Masquerade ball being held in Mr. Weasley's estate, Narcissa began her energized frenzy to prepare outfits for herself as well as Draco and Lucius. Naturally, she had one request for her only child.
"Ronald and your beloved Mr. Potter are currently outside in the yard, acting like children and racing each other." Hermione drawled on as she resumed her activity and took a dainty bite of her roll. She took a small sniff from her nose and her eyes narrowed slightly, her head turning towards Draco who was sipping his tea. She came closer to Draco, sniffing down his neck and leaning in even closer when Draco attempted to pull away. "Are you wearing perfume? You never wear perf-"
Draco's eyes widened at the sight of the clip, his heart swelling. It felt as if there were millions of butterflies in his stomach, all of them fluttering inside and making their way through his body. He felt as if he were about to burst into tears and yet he remained perfectly still.
Harry could believe that perhaps some were indoctrinated into the Dark Lord's army against their will. He wouldn't put it past Voldemort to do so, considering the monster was the reason Harry was orphaned at the tender age of one. And perhaps this is why Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were deeply shameful of their Dark Marks. Something that they had never wanted in the first place.
"Why isn't it my angel in disguise!"
Upon closer inspection, Draco could fully see the young gentlemen. Mr. Weasley was a tall and lanky redhead (borderline ginger). He seemed to exude a rather homely personality, kind and generous and yet slightly clumsy. He wanted to interact with the other guests, saying hello to each one who he passed and giving a few handshakes. Meanwhile, his companion was not the least bit as hospitable.
"Oh I was just uh… leaving," Draco muttered as he sharply pushed between Hermione and Ron to get to the exit.
Draco stared back at the boy as if he grew another head. "What are you talking about?" Draco felt his skin erupt in goosebumps and the hairs on the back of his neck stand up at the implication of Harry Potter being his husband, even if it was pretend.
Draco's little bubble burst at hearing Harry's last remark. He turned to the boy next to him only to see he was already staring back. Malfoys and Potters? Yes it was definitely a century old feud between them. Death Eaters Vs. The Light. It wasn't as if Draco's parents had a choice in the matter. When Voldemort asks you to do something, you simply don't say no. It's in the past, their hands were tied. Can you truly punish the apple for coming from a rotten bunch? It's not as if his parents are bad people. They're kind and smart and funny and loving and goddammit he's tired of all these assumptions. It doesn't even matter now. Voldemort is dead. As dead as a doornail….Draco supposed he has Harry's parents to thank for that. "I guess that means we were destined to hate each other too," Draco mused with a small, sad smirk.
"You'd have me be a child bride!?" Draco whined, his fingers gripping Harry's even tighter as they began to see the glowing lights of the party and the sounds of music once again flow. "And no, no no no! I will not elope like it's some shitty shotgun wedding." Draco and Harry began to see the guests once more. "We'll have a beautiful wedding. Nearly 300 guests. And it'll be here maybe, so my mother can plan it!" Draco smiled, and Harry was lost in his crystal eyes. He didn't even notice the guests around them, Death Eaters and criminals alike. Who cared anymore, the darkness that seeped into the room from the guests. Not when he had the most dazzling thing in his own hands.
"But it has to be the right one, daddy," Draco muttered, his eyes never leaving the animals. He finally came across a beautiful Blue Russian cat, a sparkling gray coat and brilliant green blue eyes, Draco whipped around to his father behind him, attempting to put on the best "Please, Daddy~" eyes he could.
"Oh?" Draco asked, "And how do you know I'm an angel?" He asked, a twinkle in his eye.
New home, new feelings.
"Well, I thought it was appropriate for a pretentious princess like you. Besides, I thought you liked all that fluffy crap, " Harry scoffed back under his breath, nearly downing his tea in one gulp, ignoring the scalding hot liquid burning his throat. Draco remained quiet, looking down at the amber tea in his cup.
"The only two available rooms are the ones on the third floor. The ones that are across from each other." Ronald smiles and sighs, "I'm in awe of how brilliant you are, my love."
"If it's my body you want, then please let me know. I don't know what you want, Harry. I don't know and it's killing me." Tears began to spring from Draco's eyes once more. Harry felt like the air was knocked from his lungs. He watched as the boy in front of him crumbled, frantically wiping at his face to hide the tears that threatened to fall. Large, warm hands came up to Draco's cheeks, one hand sliding down to Draco's neck. The boy looked up at Harry, eyes glittering and wet.
Draco bit his bottom lip and followed Harry inside the school, which was now more or less silent except for the occasional mutterings of a painting or ghost. He doesn't know why he's so blindly following the brunette, it's not like they were friends now. It's not like one night would change anything. But hey, now that he's here, might as well see what the fuss was about that made Potter apparate them all the way here. They finally stopped in front of the Gryffindor Commons room entrance once more. This time, the Fat Lady was lounging against her chaise, feeding herself grapes and other fruits. She was startled to see the two students, her body jolting up from his position quite animatedly.
"Never a lack of insults from you, right, Mr. Potter?" Draco purred, finally wrapping his arms around Harry's bicep, holding on as the wind picked up. He could hear the only man chuckle slightly, feel the rumble in his chest as it vibrates against Draco's skin.
Before Draco could let out a peep, Harry brought his finger to his lips, signalling for Draco to listen carefully for the sound of receding footsteps clacking against the cold stone floor, each one getting softer than the last. When the two boys were finally once again surrounded by nothing but dark quiet, Draco pushed away against Harry's chest, feeling the suddenly heavy material falling against him. It was opaque around the two, clearly indicating that Draco and Harry were currently surrounded by some kind of-of enchanted blanket or something.
Draco stepped closer which made Harry's mouth close shut abruptly. Draco looked up at the painting with a charming smile and his eyes like a doe. Even Harry was stuck staring at him. "Won't you let me in, once more? Please?" Draco begged, peering through darling eyelashes up at the Fat Lady. His pretty pink lips pouted and Harry found himself unable to look away.
In the back of Draco's broken-down little closet, he pulled out a heaving wooden trunk by it's metal brass knobs. He hit the floor with an 'oof' when the trunk finally was breached from its hold and Draco rubbed his ass, wincing as he did so. The trunk was made of shellacked maple wood, decorated with swirling clouds and delicate flowers. It housed the only momentos he was able to bring with him from his old life: photographs, postcards, clothing, and trinkets. He hadn't looked inside the trunk since he had first placed it in the back of his wardrobe, but he would be damned if he would leave it behind. He stood up from the floor, sighing as he did so. Draco gently waved one hand above the illustrious trunk and in a flash of soft light and golden sparks, it disappeared from its spot. This was the extent of Draco's powers now, simple parlour tricks. He was able to apparate things away, something that a child could do in their first year of schooling. The Ministry had deemed Draco a non-threat to society and therefore allowed him to keep the simplest of incantations.
"Excuse me??" Draco's eyes narrowed, "Did you just compare me to a...a…"
"You opened yourself up to intimidation this way. Why did you leave your friends?" Mr. Potter's veins throbbed in his neck as he attempted to remain calm.
"It's fine, Uncle. Just some stupid idiot." Draco couldn't look his uncle in the eyes. He wouldn't.
Silence filled in the gaps of their conversations. Shifting eyes to one another only to look back at the fire in front of them.
Harry's mind began to wander, not wishing to focus on the idea of Mr. Nott any longer. He turned in his bed, the sheets drawing closer to his chest. Harry remembers speaking about marriage with Draco. How embarrassing he must have been. He remembers those soft eyes, icy and yet warm. They were wide, shocked and slightly glassy. Had Harry said something to offend him? Damn the alcohol, damn it all to hell. From now on, Harry drinks nothing but tea and coffee (and the occasional glass of wine). Harry definitely remembered speaking about marriage with the younger.
"Perfect! No man could resist you now! Come, let's go show your father!" Narcissa once again grabbed Draco by the hand and dragged him to the living room, where Lucius was seated, waiting for his wife and son to be ready. "Husband! Don't you think our son looks absolutely ravishing? He'll be the prettiest one there!"
"Listen Malfoy, it's important!"
Draco has heard of the illustrious Harry Potter, in passing conversations while sitting in his father's lap as he discussed with colleagues or when his mother read the daily gossip columns in the papers. Harry Potter, the boy that survived Lord Voldemort's hex and, at the ripe age of 1 year old. His parents, Lily and James Potter, had protected their child and killed the once Dark Lord, only to die in the process. Their likenesses were carved in marble, statues were erected in the middle of Hogsmeade. They were deemed heroes of the Wizarding World. They were legends, visionaries, gods.. and yet, here their child was. An orphan in ill fitting clothes and broken glasses.
He cleared his throat softly and avoided eye contact. "A gift from a classmate," he said simply, eyes scanning the newspaper in his hands in an attempt to look anywhere but his mother.
"I could tell, you see, I saw an aura around you. As if you had a halo," the man smirked, toothy, Draco noted as hot breath hit his neck.

Draco was on top of him, totally starkers, and their cocks were firmly pressed up against each other.

She almost had him with that one. Harry's Gryffindor guilt began to rear its ugly head when, in a triumphant burst of insight, he found the hole in her argument: she wasn't mad
food if I am the only one buying any!
I am afraid your Great Gitness will have to make do without me. I am on medical quarantine and cannot return to work until St. Mungo's clears me.
"Try blowing on hot food first, maybe?" he lifted up a chip and studied it for a moment. It wasn't exactly what he had expected. "I am not judging the food... Yet. I was judging your terrible hand holding qualities and inability to recognize the steam rising off your chip."
"Am I interrupting something?" came a familiar voice from the doorway.
Harry replayed the conversation over and over in his mind as he made his way down the long gravel drive, searching in vain for hints at Malfoy’s involvement with Burnbridge’s sudden appearance and trying to discern what, if anything, he should have done differently back up at the house.
"The place where you bit me is sore," he breathed. "Did you mean to mark me, or was it just passion?"
"Of course I thought about you!" he said exasperatedly. "And the more I thought about it, the more convinced I was you would disapprove. And look at that--I was right!"
Dear Draco,
"Some night," he declared inanely, for want of anything better to say, as he flopped onto the sofa beside Draco (who scoffed in response). "How does that expression about 'best laid plans' go?" he asked. It was rhetorical.
He held his breath while Malfoy seemed to consider and released it with a grateful exhalation when the taller man waved him on. “By all means,“ Malfoy drawled imperiously, a benevolent king doling out mercies from his gilded throne.
Lots of people. Who would want to hex and/or badly injure him, or worse. He gulped as discretely as he could, held his head up high, and attempted his old cocky mien that had seen him through other rough times.
It was only after he looked away that recognition set in: the bloke was none other than Zabini.
"I'll bring wine and salad next week," she declared. "If you love me, you'll make dessert. If you love Ron, you'll serve red meat. Oh and please let Draco know I plan to grill him on all the details of his next book. I'm so impatient for it to come out!" She then kissed him on the cheek and sent him out the door because she had work to do.
*****
Oh well.
He spooned a bit more curry and chewed it thoughtfully, expression innocent and serene.
With an unqualified grin, Mike prepared their order and handed over two hot paper cones, heaped with golden brown fish and perfect salty crisps. Harry thanked him and lead Draco away a few paces. "Do you want to walk and eat, find a place to sit, or head back home?"
******
He returned to his spot and picked up his spoon to dig in to the dessert. It was gooey, molten perfection on the inside.
******
he thought smugly, just before leaning down and swallowing Draco's hardening member to the hilt. Draco let out an adorable yip of surprise and Harry relished drawing out the tease with a slow, sucking drag up the shaft. When he got to the end, he flicked the slit with the pointed tip of his tongue, savouring the musky flavour of precome gathering there. He hummed in delight.
Draco nodded in response, though the growing feeling of trepidation wouldn't leave him. Everything seemed like it could be the beginning of the end, and suddenly he regretted not asking to have dinner at some muggle place that would be more toward Harry's tastes. He shook his head as they turned a corner and stood before the doors of the Garden Room.
,” Malfoy said again, directing the wand this time toward each of the extinguished lamps. And just like that, the room was bathed once more in their comforting pink-tinged glow. It didn’t get past Harry that this spell, unlike the ones that had preceded it, was cast with deliberation and control.
That elicited another short laugh from the blonde as he was already being tempted into round two. He was young and definitely horny, but even he needed at least ten minutes between rounds. Slowly, he pulled out of the kiss.
Draco gasped in horror. He growled and began to advance on Harry, eyes narrowed to slits. He grabbed his lover by the collar of his shirt and proceeded to leave many biting kisses along his neck--latching on like a lamprey.
He wanted to give the Auror complete control to see what he might do (merely the thought of it was a major turn on), but it was growing difficult not to buck forward. He distracted himself by slanting his mouth against Harry's and sucking hard on his tongue.
"Like that, Draco," he praised breathlessly in reply. "Just like that."
He rubbed circles into the side of Malfoy's foot near his prominent ankle as they ate their dinner, trying not to fixate on how little distance separated said foot and his crotch. (He was doing a piss poor job of it.) "So tell me," he prompted (to give himself something else to think about), "were you ever going to approach me or were you just going to keep writing best sellers about me while I was none the wiser?"
Draco slipped his hand into Harry's almost too easily. His slender fingers danced across the Auror's pulse before gently gripping his wrist and squeezing. Everything Harry said made sense and felt far more comforting than he expected. He breathed a long sigh and smirked--much more confidently this time.
He stood up from the chair to pace, unable to sit still with his temperature up.
Draco acted like he couldn't care less about the fact Harry was displaying a rather impressive feat of strength--Auror training was rigorous--in honoring his absurd demand. (He was skinny, but he didn't weigh nothing.) The way he clung to Harry and set right in to nuzzling the side of his face told a different story, however.
He could only hope Zabini was hurting worse.
Indeed.
Potter was so willing and the kiss was even more than Draco dared to dream. It was hot, passionate, and utterly perfect--like the rest of him. It was too bad it had to stop.
After taking several minutes to compose himself and attempt to puzzle out Pansy's unprecedented vitriol, he returned to the kitchen feeling confused and downtrodden (and no closer to solving the mystery).
Thirdly, you scared me off of trying to do anything helpful around the flat with all those weirdly formal, half-threat notes you left everywhere about how to clean

"She's in the zone," Potter explained, grinning ruefully. "A cauldron could explode in here and she might not notice." He swiped the book from Granger--who protested shrilly--and set it before him, even going so far as to open it to the correct potion-stained page.

Harry breathed.
"Then I'll call the DMLE and have you forcibly removed. I don't imagine

Draco startled a laugh out of Harry with his admission.
"About fifteen minutes, but I charmed the oven to turn off on its own to avoid burning your house down," Draco sucked Harry's bottom lip into his mouth; licking, nibbling, and pulling until it was swollen before letting it go. "If you're going to take advantage of me, I expect you to compliment my dinner, even if you hate it."
Draco forced thoughts of a once rejected handshake out of his mind and contemplated other ways to communicate his identity to Potter instead.
He leaned back and regarded the Auror thoughtfully.
"And here I thought I was being friendly! You wound me."
******
Harry's breath hitched at the sudden skin-on-skin contact.
"I'm not quite finished yet," Harry protested weakly, reclining back in the squeaky chair to give his boyfriend more room. He gripped Draco's narrow waist in both hands and barely resisted grinding against him.
No reason they couldn't do both.
your eyes looked brighter than I remembered."
Checking the time and seeing it was close to five, he decided to head home for the day (without bidding Ron a goodnight. Wanker).
“You’ve seen the full extent of my disability—it’s only fair for you to show me yours,” he stated matter-of-factly.
It was a lost cause.
Draco's head fell back, his eyes screwed shut, and his mouth was wide with a deep, guttural moan as he finally came all over Harry's hand. The Slytherin's body stiffened through his orgasm and his inner walls constricted on Harry's length. After a few long seconds it was done and Draco was falling limp against the bed.
She thought that if I wrote back it might keep you from climbing the walls while they work on an antidote. For what it's worth, I am sorry that you're suffering. I'm going to do a bit of poking around to see if I can find the culprit. DMLE resources and all that.
Draco,
Dear Draco,
Draco couldn't agree more.
Pressing his own erection into Draco's leg, he began to wank Draco in earnest, trailing kisses down his neck and stretching himself almost to the point of pain to do so while still keeping Draco's arms pinned (because the Slytherin was so bloody

His prick was still rather stiff.
What he did instead was offer to take a turn about the garden with Draco.
He leapt off the sofa and landed in a rolling tumble, hindquarters working independently of the fore in his haste. He righted himself quickly and flowed across the floor, body moving in sinuous waves (like some kind of foolish land-bound sea serpent), avoiding furniture and discarded quidditch gear on his way to the other side of the room.
Harry frowned sternly. "Someone' most assuredly should

Potter pinched him on the shoulder but snuggled in harder as soon as it was done. Who knew the Saviour of the Wizarding World was such a Hufflepuff after sex?
Finally a directive Draco could comply with. It probably didn't hurt that the feeling Harry wanted him to focus on was good enough to have his toes curling.
Even so, Harry decided he didn’t need to know what Hermione would do after all.

His stubborn conscience was unmoved by such logic.
Draco unleashed a furious tirade about how it
Once his mouth was released, he moaned and panted eagerly--the sound somewhat muffled through his teeth as he bit his lip to try and hush the noises. The heat of Harry's palm on his skin made him want to reciprocate, and he did so by undulating his his hips against Harry's cloth-covered crotch. The already short shirt rode up his torso until his belly was exposed.

are what I want. Though Salazar knows why at this point. How much clearer do I have to make it?
His head fell back with an unpleasant bump into some kind of gardening implement. He didn't care. Draco's skillful fingers were wrapped firmly around his shaft and tugging with a purpose. Nothing else mattered.
Harry's anger rose (along with sickening bile in the back of his throat). That Draco would even consider letting either of his so-called-friends rape him--because, let's not split hairs, that's what he was describing--just so he could keep them happy made his wild magic snarl and snap.
As for the marriage contract, it is a long standing tradition among pure-bloods (even the Potters at one point) to have arranged marriages. I imagine if not for your paternal grandparents' choice to indulge instead of control their son, he may not have married your mother. And then where would the world be?
Feeling more dizzy than the pensieve use alone could account for, Harry ran a hand through his hair and asked the first (professional) question that came to his mind--
His eyes widened again, heart racing like a frantic rabbit.
Draco,
In that same moment, all the lights in his living room came on, joined by a chorus of, "
Draco released a slow groan as his cock was taken in Potter's sure grip. He bucked his hips without shame and bit his lip to stifle any further noises that threatened. Besides a fluttering of nerves in his gut, Draco seemed perfectly at ease in the nude. And it helped to see Potter looking him up and down with such eagerness and approval, so much Draco accidentally blushed a little.
******
Draco kissed Harry's cheek tentatively, then gave in to an impulse he might not have if he thought Potter was 100% and nuzzled the side of his face with his pointed nose. It was finally dawning on him that Potter was fairly lucid, at least enough to make Draco believe he wanted him, but the idea of kissing a man who may not have even brushed his teeth that morning due to exhaustion from sickness was just too much to overcome.

"I'm sure," Harry replied unironically. Merlin knew Malfoy'd been through worse.
He took the liberty of grabbing Harry's free arm and carefully moved to escort him back out the way they came.

Anxious and feeling trapped, Harry filled the space with idle chatter, pretending he wasn't tied up in knots over the maddeningly silent man at his side.
"I suggest," he continued in a sultry tone as he leaned forward to bite Harry's jaw just below his ear, "that we continue our snogging session. Now that we're both sated, our cocks shouldn't be too much of a factor, and if they become one we can just sixty-nine them back into submission. Or mutual wanking. Or I could introduce you to some of my toys. One of them vibrates into your perineum while it fucks you--it's charmed to thrust on its own until you command it to stop."

Draco's body bent like a bow as his orgasm tore through him. Harry's movements lost their rhythm in the face of it. He kept going as best he could but he was rather distracted by the sight. Not to mention the feeling of Draco's interior muscles gripping him tighter still...then pulsing in time with the hot stripes of come that soon painted his chest and abdomen.

The familiar bit of holly smacked into his palm as it sailed from Harry's denims. Draco smirked, pleased with both his rightness and the wand's obedience.
Harry chuckled. "You didn't have to wear them," he retorted, eyeing Draco appraisingly.
Harry's heart wrenched in his chest; Draco slid his foot until the edges of their shoes were touching, offering his support. Harry wanted to crumple into it but he kept up the brave front for those that remained.
Harry was no stranger to the morbid. His education had included thorough training on the assessment of and the referral and treatment process for suicidal ideation (not uncommon in someone dealing with disability) and his own life had led him to some...dark places. But he'd never heard someone speak so cavalierly about their fate. It was unnerving.

The rejection had been confusing at first. Draco thought Harry was denying a shower with him, but then the Auror--quick to scoot to the edge of the table and gather him back--had Draco trapped between his legs and his tongue down his throat before Draco had much chance to think.
He opened the top drawer of the large black filing cabinet--metal cold from the air conditioner vent directly overhead--and rifled through its alphabetized contents in search of 'Allard, A.' His mind and conscience continued their tandem assault, as they had done every bloody night since The Incident; 'No rest for the wicked' proven to be all-too true.
"You're stalling," Lucius said simply. "Bringing up the past won't sway me. I lost someone quite precious due to those mistakes and I won't let them happen again. My son, in particular, means more to me then you will ever know... or believe.
Truly, he'd just as soon cancel their reservation and spend the time in Draco's bed instead, but he was trying--with dubious success--not to let his libido get the better of him. If Draco continued to grind for very much longer, however, it would be a lost cause.
Harry dropped his hand onto Draco's, who obligingly turned his palm up so Harry could link their fingers together.
"You already have one, princess," he replied archly, licking a bit of cream off his upper lip. "And I am quite picky. You just happen to be up to my high standards."

I hope the fact my life is boring won't make you regret this deal.
Harry snorted.
Securely sheltered beneath a heavy armoire, Draco was nearly bowled over by the overwhelming stimuli of being so close to the action. The powerful sounds and smells overloaded the tiny ferret brain that housed his consciousness. It kept trying to distill his possible responses down to the basics: fight, flight, freeze, or fuck (strongly favouring the latter).

I lumped Hermione in with the Weasleys--she and Ron aren't married yet but they will be soon. I see them most of all (mostly because Hermione worries if she doesn't check in on me at least once a week).
"Oh really?" Potter chuckled.
... Or would I?

He propped his head in his hands to enjoy the view of Draco rifling through his bag to produce Merlin-knows-what.
"Still no tolerance for the drink, I see," Draco replied casually. Blaise stood right beside him, leaning in close enough Draco could smell the wine he had consumed. The blonde leaned away from it and frowned deeply at his former friend. "And still no concept of personal space. Lovely."
It wasn't long before Draco arched completely off the bed with a strangled cry, his knuckles white with the intensity of his grip and his eyes rolling back in his head. He came hard across the flat plane of his abdomen, a few spurts even landing on his chest.
P. S. At least you've gained a bit of humility and perspective  from this ordeal. Really, though, I'd rather you be the same insufferable prat and for the contents of my stomach to stay there.
Malfoy fidgeted with the hem of his shirt and Harry--in a sudden burst of insight atypical for him--realized he was seeing an emotion he'd never before witnessed on the posh Pureblood: he was self-conscious.
"Take your time," he called up the stairs. (To which Draco gave a non-committal mumble.)
Potter never did bring out the best in him.

Draco gasped (a manly gasp, and certainly not at all the squeak it might have sounded like) as he was suddenly jerked against the Hero and gripped nearly to the point of bruising. There was a giddy screaming in his head and the light blush from before finally breached his pale cheeks.
"He was under the effects of Veritaserum when he provided that information," he said significantly. "Ron talked to Parkinson and Zabini last night but they refused to answer any questions."
Harry scoffed at the bit about Gladys. He didn't need any extra reason to avoid the crazy old bint. At least Ron was eager to investigate, as he'd hoped (he often complained about his 'boring' Saturdays without Harry).

After a beat he added fake sternly, "But you are going to have to ease off all the coy innuendos and unsubtle taunting and ruddy skintight clothing," he raised a pointed brow at Malfoy's shirt, "if you want me to keep my hands to myself."

"In that case... How would you like to address things? I assume you know how I feel about it. Rather obvious, really."
Time for a test.
Draco grabbed the take-away bag, put it aside on a coffee table, and grabbed Harry by his collar to pull him into a hard kiss or seven.
"Your mother's 'in town?'" he repeated after a moment, surprised. "Does she not live here?" Lucius resided at the Manor, he knew, because the Aurors kept tabs on him as one of the conditions of his parole. It was news to him that Narcissa wasn't there with the bastard.
“Turn,” Malfoy ordered, demonstrating the motion with his index finger.

"No," she said decisively. "But you haven't given me any reason to be."
"Well, I don't know how to cut it myself, and after the last time I tried to have someone other than a house-elf or my mother do it... Well, let's just say wearing half my head close-cropped is not a good look for me. I haven't the patience to deal with my father, and Mother has been on extended 'vacation'," he lifted his hands and quoted the word with his fingers, "for ages. With no one else I trust, I just... let it grow.

The snog went from brilliant to really bloody fantastic, just like that.
"I did say there was plenty we could do leading up to sex... And you seem like you need some help," he smirked before undoing the top button. "Let's put my blow job theory to the test, hmm?"
Prudence demanded that they have a conversation right quick--before his hormones took over and made reasonable discourse impossible. If he was going to have any hope of focus, that foot would have to go. Regretfully, he gave it a final squeeze and shifted it to the floor; scooting his chair back as he did so that Malfoy wouldn't be able to reach him anymore. (Gladys had taught him a thing or two, after all.)
It was that 'innocent' smile--smug around the edges and smirking in his eyes--that did Harry in. Malfoy had pushed and needled and goaded and teased him almost continuously since the wedding.

are expensive.)
"Fred is dead because of Voldemort," he passionately asserted. "And there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't miss him or I'm not broken up about all the people who lost their lives because of that monster. But Draco isn't any more responsible for his death than me--maybe even more-so in my case since I'm the one Voldemort was trying to get to all along. So unless you're going to start taking me to task over that, you need to lay off of him. And bloody well get used to the idea of him being around here," he poked Ron hard in the middle of the chest. "Because if I like him enough to go through all this bullshit, he's probably going to be sticking around for a while."
Feeling vindicated, he shook his wand out of its holster and into his hand, pausing a moment to request permission. When Potter made no protest, he cast a gentle, yet effective scourgify to lift the topmost layer of sweat and grime from the man's body and finished with a useful little spell he'd learned in school for dealing with inopportune erections. Potter gasped and cupped his rapidly deflating member, glaring bloody murder at Draco for the trick (the sensation was akin to dunking one's anatomy in a bucket of ice water; in a word, unpleasant. He made no move to cast the spell on himself--his robes hid the situation in his pants more than adequately. He did, however, point the wand at his head to restyle his hair and calm the flush in his cheeks.
Shifting his attention to the other nipple and taking it between his teeth, he flicked it with the tip of his tongue and delighted in Draco's mewling whimpers. He straightened up after a minute to better appreciate the sight of a fully nude Draco reclining (on the ruddy kitchen counter) as Harry's hand moved over his flushed and leaking prick.

So that was that, then.
"I could come just from listening to you talk," he rasped against the side of Draco's face, squeezing his wrists tight and dragging his body up Draco's length. "If we don't go to the loo right now, there will be an even bigger mess to clean when we finally do make it."

Draco woke with an indignant yelp and irritable grumble. He swatted blindly at Harry and pulled a pillow between them for protection, curling into a sleepy ball under the blankets. It was almost offensively cute.
Harry cast a mild stinging jinx at Ron's arse. He smiled with grim satisfaction when his best friend yelped and glowered.

"Better than a crucio," he retorted between breaths, favouring dark humour in times like these.
Their seats were close enough that Draco could easily lean in and kiss Harry's cheek, which he did with an added lick to his neck.
"You noticed him, too, eh? Not too subtle is he?" Draco chuckled. "It's whatever you want to do, love. I couldn't care less what they think or say. It would end up as gay-hate, Death Eater, Hero-Gone-Traitor, scumbag tripe no matter what we said. Perhaps it would be better to consult your Quibbler friend? What was her name... Luna, yes? If you really want to give a statement to the Prophet boy over there, however, I'll comply."

"No, I definitely want this... I just needed to confirm this was okay for you. It is nice to know you're fond of me, at least," Draco laid back and placed both hands into the bed on both sides of his hips, waiting to be positioned. "Go ahead."

Maybe it wasn't too late to go back to school. Hermione could help him study. He could become a medical examiner--cadavers don't talk back or take offense or suggest the barmiest bloody ideas ever to be dreamt up...

Harry decided he liked it that way.
Malfoy gave him a flat expression. “You mean besides not being able to use a wand?“ he said tartly.
A shiver ran down Draco's spine at those words, and again at the husky way Harry called for the help. Within seconds a young waitress appeared and they placed their orders, Draco deciding to add a chowder to his selection--heavy with fish and clams. Once the girl (who'd been oddly cold and impatient towards him...probably jealous of his date) was gone he offered Harry a grin.
Draco smirked. "That wasn't what you said last night when I--"
It seemed momentous.
"Gimme a heads up next time, yeah?" he frowned, battling against the vertigo of unexpected apparation.
If anything was going to happen between them (and that was a big bloody
Harry inhaled deeply and held it for a beat. "You heard Arthur," he said, exhaling on a sigh. "I have a number of apologies to make. ...Starting with you." He turned to face Draco fully, offering his hand. Draco laced their fingers without hesitation, listening attentively.
Harry cast a subtle notice-me-not and shuffled until the park's gate was at his back (with Draco clinging to him all the while). The bars were uncomfortable but he didn't care. He dropped his newspaper cone, held on to the fence with both hands, and turned his head to give Draco more access.
******
"Is it just you and the house-elves here?" he asked.
Is that really you?"
Draco slowly sat up and laughed. He licked his dried lips as he stared at Harry with a wicked grin.
The public thing might take a little longer to consider, since he hadn't been out in a Wizarding crowd since the wedding, their disasterous garden dinner, and a charity auction his father had dragged him to a year before (and a small scattering of dinners out with his former "friends"). Draco's heart quickened with panic just at the thought, but as his gaze moved to lock with Harry's--staring so earnestly into his... Draco knew he couldn't say no. Even if his hands grew a bit sweaty.

"Mm," Draco returned Harry's kiss and added a flick of his tongue across his thin upper lip. He smirked again, with teeth this time, and began to slowly unbutton Harry's once nice shirt. It had practically melted into the man's strong pecs and biceps from their 'stroll' through the garden.
"I admit I was a little drunk. Not buzzed yet, thank Merlin, but tipsy. I didn't see it at first. We were all on the dance floor: me, Blaise, and Pansy. There was glitter, colorful lights..." Draco snapped his fingers. "That's right! The club was called '

"It looks like I am lactating," the Slytherin complained. "As soon as we find a properly private place, I am going to suck your prick so hard you'll wonder if it's going to fall off!"
A bottle of champagne sat on the small table in front of them. Harry poured a generous amount into each of their flutes and offered one to Draco. "To new horizons," he toasted, smirking over the rim of his glass.
Harry snorted, feeling smug. "I work out almost every day," he replied, flexing his arse beneath Draco's palms. "But they're not just vanity muscles." (They were that, too; he felt he had to compensate for his height.) "My job can be very physically demanding at times. When I'm not wasting away with paperwork, that is."
"Maybe next time," he replied, feeling a pang of regret even as he said it.
"I'm trouble. Before even the war I caused so much

His thoughts fell away, unwilling to put a label on the way he was feeling just yet (whatever it was, however, turned his brain to mush and was painted clearly on his face.) Instead, he closed his eyes and began to work the laces on his trousers. He slipped a hand through the loosened hem and skated his fingers across his cock--the thought of brilliant green eyes and wild black hair stirring it to hardness before it was even freed.
Draco laughed as he was pulled into Harry's side. He hugged the Auror's waist with one arm, nestling the other under his neck. He grinned wide and returned the kiss to his lover's cheek.

I know a place. You always seemed to be able to find me in the castle back when you stalked me six year. Can you still? I'll be waiting...

He wasn't sure if it was the drinks or the thrill of the game or something else altogether that had incited him to behave so out of character. Normally Draco was aloof and utterly unattainable to everyone in the Ministry and he treated Harry with polite reserve on the rare occasions that they crossed paths. Not that Harry expected any different, but he had entertained more than a passing fancy. Draco was bloody fit. And he'd made a damn fine show of turning his life around. And he may or may not have been the reason Harry realized he was bent shortly after the war (when he finally had a chance to sort those things out).
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious reference, but the Auror's speech caused a grin to once again light up his face. He squeezed his lover's hand and did his best to suppress the blush that threatened.
Draco cast a nonchalant glance toward his second level where his bedroom was. The second floor had a railing but no walls, and normally one could see the bed and matching brown and black antique suite from the living room... But now with at least ten strong cloaking charms the upstairs appeared blank--like an unused, empty room. He turned back to the Auror, lifting his legs onto the couch and curling them under.
"It might be sexier, but I'm not willing to risk damaging your skin to find out," Harry replied, burying his face against Draco's neck. He felt sleepy and content, but he wasn't the one laying in come or having it seep out his arse. Draco could solve the problem himself if he was so concerned about it.
Not a fantastic way to return from holiday, you wanker.
He was about to dive in with gusto when his neck prickled with the sensation of being watched. He looked over his shoulder at Potter, who was indeed looking back at him.
Draco Malfoy
Smoothing his expression and fixing his gaze ahead of him, Malfoy answered coolly, "Tuesday last." The line of his shoulders was tense, even as they bobbed in time with his steps.
No one could make him feel defensive like Hermione. Particularly when she used that disappointed mum tone.
"Wasn't me," Ron maintained, holding his hands up in a show of innocence (and popping the last piece of croissant into his mouth while it was close).
"Trying to help yourself to some dessert, more like," Harry quipped, inferring that the terror had--not for the first time--used the cupboard shelves as steps to reach the off-limits treat. Said shelves were currently a jumble of splinters and cockeyed boards hanging past the gaping wooden door.

What about you towards me? I thought you hated me.
Well,
He surged forward for one last deep thrust and collapsed onto Draco, who slumped against the bed with a contented smile and dry quip.
He sat on his haunches to relieve muscles that were beginning to protest his stooped posture (and to buy himself a moment). He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply in order to properly steel himself.
"Don't mistake my prudence for lack of interest," he warned, righting both himself and his robes. "Your gown awaits, and that," he gestured at Potter's lap, "is going to disrupt the fall of the skirts."

It wasn't that Harry didn't notice the finger now firmly lodged in his arse--it would be rather difficult to miss--but the sensation was somewhat lost in the bloody incredible feeling of Draco sucking him with skill that defied his lack of experience.
"So, where are we?" (Draco decided to ask outright to confirm his suspicion rather than sit and wonder.) "And why aren't we naked and in your bed instead?"
Draco leaned over the table and bit his lower lip as he regarded Harry with a smoldering haze. The bit of soft, pink flesh snapped from his teeth.
"He liked me in school, apparently, and it wasn't easy for him to admit that. Which is why I know he's being honest." He caught Ron's eye to add facetiously, "Plus, I don't know if you're aware, I've had extensive training and experience in interrogation and interview techniques so I tend to know when someone's lying."

No sass or I will hex you the moment I get back. This is partially your fault, you know.

Draco eyed the way Harry immediately spooned his ice cream and plunged it in with the soufflé with a curious quirk of his brow. He had eaten ice cream (including strange and exotic flavors he was certain Harry'd never tried) and soufflés (baked by master chefs), but he never thought to mix the two at once. It seemed a bit plebeian, but...

Malfoy's movements were obviously strained, and he tried ineffectually to hide a limp as he attempted to brush past his would-be occupational therapist.

Draco huffed, but the reasoning was sound. He sighed and
He squeezed the shaft with a gentle pulsing rhythm and took the upper half into his mouth for some light bobbing, getting everything wet with the broad side of his flattened tongue to ease his motions later on.

Eager, and somewhat nervous.
His balance, on the other hand, needed work.
He set to work on the rest of Draco's buttons and rid him of the shirt, letting his hands roam freely over the delightful expanse of his long, lean torso and kissing a path from his collar bone to his mouth.

Why, then, did he stop?
Harry's spine went rigid. "I don't want an apology, Draco," he said tightly, pushing him back far enough to look him in the eye (but not releasing his shoulders). "You aren't responsible for my feelings or anyone else's. That's the whole bloody point. Godrick," He growled, overcome with frustration. "Do you have any idea how awful it is to hear you talk about bribing someone with your body to buy their supposed friendship?"

The halls remained blessedly empty as they traversed the castle. Potter refrained from speaking while they were out, which Draco appreciated; he was in no mood for curious inquiries. He contented himself with basking in radiant body heat and listening to Potter's strong, steady heartbeat. (And if he inhaled rather deeply of the man's scent, who was anyone to judge.)
Draco gasped, loud and wet, as his cock was swallowed and licked with a surprising amount of skill. The blonde wondered for a brief moment if Potter was naturally talented or had a lot of experience, as the sick Gryffindor ate his sensitized member with such intense enthusiasm it nearly left Draco dizzy.
The warning growl that vibrated in Draco's chest was small but sincere. And he paired it with his most fearsome glare.
big a deal to get angry about? Everything was in a jumble so he shut his eyes a moment and forced it all into little compartments (his hand tensing as he did so.) Whatever it was it didn't require analysis now.
Draco snorted, both for the "infamous" comment and for the jab at Slytherin loyalty, before cocking a grin and slowly turning his head to face the Auror once more. He opened one silver eye lazily.
"Fuck yesss," he groaned as he was rocked by a powerful aftershock.
He spent a few moments looking around the room, ignoring Harry completely. Harry took a steadying breath and tried to see it through his eyes.
He realized after he'd said it that it sounded like he was inviting Draco to stay indefinitely.

But he did like the look of Draco's trim little waist and the faint dimples above his arse.
Circe's circlet, could Draco move any slower he groused internally (impatient for warm, wet heat engulfing him).
When he said things like, “Put your other arm around me,” and “Don’t move—just like that,” and “Yes, Harry!” it was all Harry could do to keep from laughing hysterically. Or sobbing. Or snogging Malfoy for all he was worth. Or some combination of the three.
Harry felt genuine pity. "You poor, deprived sod," he lamented. "I knew you were sheltered in your ivory tower but I didn't realize how bad it was. Please tell me you've at least had real fish and chips--the kind served in a greasy newspaper cone?"
I have a type. It may or may not have been heavily inspired by you. But I had no reason to think you might ever be attainable, so why risk my vulnerable ego approaching you? One definitive Potter rejection was quite enough, thank you.
It was after dark when the owl returned bearing Potter's response. Draco was in the middle of dinner; nothing too fancy, just a meal of random veggies and a chicken cooked in thick, white wine sauce. He had just stuffed another slice into his mouth when the owl surprised him. He quirked a brow and stood from his dining room to allow the bird in, this time through his kitchen window. The poor thing seemed tired now... Did Potter live terribly far from him? Or did the Ministry just over work their birds? Either way, he offered the ruffled creature a perch and some chicken and peas before unrolling the scroll.
"Not my doing," Draco whispered hastily, disavowing all knowledge of the would-be surprise party.
Potter continued petting him, neglecting to comment on Draco's nudity or the fact he still occupied his lap. "Potion wore off then?" he asked, though the answer was obvious.
"And I'm glad you're looking forward to the rest of the evening," he smiled after another sip of champagne. "I wish I could take full credit, but a lot of this was Hermione's idea." He was unwilling to pretend otherwise; it wasn't honest. "She told me I needed to take you on at least one date that communicated to you how much I think you're worth. So here we are," he gestured with his glass at the opulent expanse of the Hall. "I had the big picture idea--a nice dinner, music, dressing up. She found the venue."
“I always do.”
*****
"No? And why, pray tell, is that?"
A harried looking house elf yanked open the door just as Harry raised his fist again.
Harry tried to keep himself busy while he awaited Malfoy's reply but jittery anticipation made his short attention span even worse than usual. The fitful night of sleep wasn't helping anything. Neither was the fact that he couldn't stop perseverating on Malfoy. If it wasn't the owl he was thinking about, it was the unusual details of Malfoy's supposed attack (which had spurred him to send a letter in the first place) or, worse, the surprisingly...not repulsive...way Malfoy's body had felt when they danced last night.
"How will I turn you on with my clothes ever again if you're already turned on? How can I give you inappropriate stiffies now if you can control yourself?"
Your other relatives sound vile. I should wish never to meet them.
"How is it?" Harry asked, trying to draw his focus to something more pleasant as they made their way to the restaurant.
“There isn’t a way for me to show you without taking off my trousers,” he replied (very sensibly, he thought).
Draco had said he would be over 'shortly.' What did that mean? Harry's stomach gave a nervous flip.
The day had taken a turn for the worse when Parkinson and Zabini arrived for questioning. Even though they hadn't been allowed to communicate with one another, they followed the exact same script when Ron began their interrogations, with Harry watching through a spelled wall. (He'd sat out so as to not compromise the results in case someone wanted to accuse him of bias at their trial.)
“A right pair we make, Potter,” he murmured sardonically as Harry lowered himself to the cushions.

Draco turned to him for a reaction and Harry let his appreciation shine through unfiltered. "I like it," he grinned.
Draco grinned as Harry brought him in for a comforting hug. The kiss that followed was even nicer, and suddenly Draco felt secure again (or as secure as he could get these days.) He allowed Harry to lead him out, or did at first. Harry stopped and stared at his own reflection while Draco snickered.
Malfoy had the decency to look contrite. "She told you that?" he asked.
Even with the name calling, Draco was being sweeter than he ever had to Harry. He really did seem concerned for his well being. And damned if that didn't make him feel all warm and fuzzy in a way quite different from either the fever or his unexpectedly awakened libido.
While I am able to have (almost) anyone I want, I haven't actually done so. You and Pansy make me sound like a shameless rake. I am more discerning than that.
Well that was a departure from his original stance, now wasn't it?
******
“‘m sorry, Malfoy,” he hastily apologized (and because his eyes were averted, he missed the fleeting moment Draco allowed genuine disappointment to show). “It’s been a rough couple of weeks.” He looked up quickly and continued, “Not that I’m trying to excuse it! Just if you could go a little easier on me. For a bit? I swear I’m trying to make things up to you. Not that I can make it up to you, not really. It was right awful what I did. You have every right to never forgive me—“
He hoped so.
With Harry.
And he thought about it. He really did. Draco's idea certainly had merit, but he wasn't quite ready to take the plunge.
*****
As he was somewhat of a Spartan bather, Harry had expected to be waiting on Malfoy but was pleasantly surprised to find the other man already seated. Malfoy greeted him with an almost imperceptible smile and a nod, silver eyes flicking quickly over Harry’s body in appraisal. He gave no indication if what he saw it was to his liking but he gestured for Harry to sit next to him all the same. Harry’s stomach clenched with more than simple hunger. He hadn’t felt this nervous since… Well, probably something else having to do with Malfoy and his proximity. But he was no coward. Gryffindor and all that. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he put on his brave face and went to the place setting arranged for him.

"This better be important, Draco," Pansy snapped, glaring murderously through the flames and looking perfectly demonic. "You've got five minutes before I hang up. I'm

Dear Potter,
My heart beats all the louder for you when you play hard to get, my scrumptious, unobtainable Auror.

"What, you want to shake hands?" Potter asked incredulously, easy laughter making his words melodic. Draco held his gaze. That was
Yes, your hair.
"I didn't realize I'd be judged so harshly for my technique," Harry said around a bite, arching a brow. "Maybe you should give me a tutorial when we're done eating so that I won't disappoint you next time."
Draco pulled up until only the head occupied his mouth. Both hands moved to stroke the rest of Harry's length in furious swipes, urging him to climax. He could taste the salt of precome dribbling into his mouth. He swallowed automatically and awaited the moment when something much thicker would coat his tongue.
Draco squeaked. He couldn't help it. The shock was just too great. Was Potter really wanking to thoughts of
Harry's stomach chose that moment to grumble loudly.
Malfoy quirked a brow at that but didn’t press the point. To Harry’s immense relief.
"The fact that he's carried a torch for me for so long could go either way--maybe he'll be more likely to stick around even though I frequently come home late (or not at all) because of work and I'm kind of a slob and I snore, or maybe he'll realize I don't match up to the fantasy of me he's created in his head and he'll bolt," he shrugged. "I might decide he's more trouble than he's worth or that cock doesn't actually do it for me--" Ron grimaced, Harry laughed and went on, "I won't know unless I try."
Malfoy looked pointedly at him. Harry tried not to squirm.
Harry
Draco gasped as Harry slipped out of his wanting chute and slammed back inside. A deep groan emitted, accompanied with a roll of his eyes, as his prostate was roughly brush over.
"Sit down," Harry prompted, gentling his smirk to a smile. "I already think you're the sexiest bloke here and I can't wait to whisk you away," he explained, nudging Draco's foot with his own under the table. "You putting on a show like that is like throwing a log into a forest fire--it's fuel, sure, but that fire was going to burn anyway, with or without it."
Harry chuckled. "I find that hard to believe," he answered truthfully, wrapping around Draco like a clinging vine (lest he suddenly come to his senses and attempt to flee). He pulled the ridiculous mask and bonnet off Draco's head and tossed them off the side of the bed. Much better.
"I can only imagine," he opined. There was something almost like fondness beneath the words. Harry warmed at the sound of it.
The photo session can wait for morning, when I can catch you naked and unprepared.
Malfoy sighed. "I have tried. But it is difficult to find the motivation to really exert myself on my own. Particularly because it seems like wasted effort."

And Malfoy unlocked the gate.
"See? Not so bad, yeah?"

Good grief, man! The only greater violation would be you helping yourself to my toothbrush or shagging someone in my bed. (Note that if I ever catch you doing either of those things, your next of kin won't be able to identify your body when it is recovered from the Thames.) You are the

Biting his lip was insufficient. Draco turned his face to the side and bit his own shoulder in an effort to stifle the stream of gasps and moans ready to spill forth.
"Eat up," he prompted, nodding toward breakfast. "You're not supposed to take potions on an empty stomach."
Thankfully, Malfoy didn't seem to mind. He just peered up at Harry from beneath his fringe and gave that half smirk that did unspeakable things to Harry’s pulse rate.
And if there was a small part of him that enjoyed making his notorious tease of a boyfriend fidget and huff, well, he was only human.
. You are neither my doctor, nor my Healer within these walls—you are my manservant, if you recall?”
Harry came with a shout, heat exploding through him, setting his nerves aflame. The image of Draco grinning up at him as he swallowed his load burned itself into his mind, sure to haunt his dreams.
Mother believes I was slipped a love potion aligned to you. I am currently being held "for my own good" in my bedroom until further notice (when the specific potion has been identified and a cure is procured), but they did not restrict my owl privileges.
He hammered the heavy oak door with his fist, shouting, "Open up, Malfoy!" through the ancient wood. He listened for a response and heard nothing, so he repeated the command, even more forcefully this time. "I

"Good. Now, let's get our things and go back inside. I'd like a nap."

Dear Potter,
"Don't look at the mess," he warned, half-jokingly, as he opened the door.
I dare you to let me do your hair tomorrow. You can pick up the tie while you're here.
Harry looked up from his desk and the assorted parchments thereon (sodding forms in triplicate, mostly, in need of his review and signature) when Draco let himself in.

Draco looked to Harry again, already devising a plan--his face one of barely kept rage and concentration.
*****
the guy liked you? And how do you know he's being honest about it?"
"Not to worry, love. I don't mind it at all! Besides, I'm not wearing robes, though this outfit was designed by an Italian designer in Wizarding Milan," Draco squeezed Harry's shoulder. "And as a bonus I'll look even better by comparison."
Draco huffed but didn't argue; he gripped the headboard where Harry'd placed his hands. Good.
"I hope you don't have other plans, because I'm the sort of bloke who likes to be fucked all night."
Harry wasn't particularly close himself, but he got a good deal closer watching Draco take his cock in hand and wank as urgently as he was being fucked. It was the sexiest bloody thing he'd ever seen.
Draco lifted his hips after Harry made quick work of his trousers. Only a pair of dark-blue pants were left, thin and silk--his cock jutting out beneath the fabric. He pulled himself up further along the table until he was lying in the middle of it (or half lying, half sitting) and motioned for Harry to follow with a crook of his finger.
Harry's prick began to take more than a passing interest in Malfoy's antics. He ignored it (as he did the majority of the time it tried causing trouble).
Harry ground his teeth. Pompous bloody infuriating
Dear Potter,
The divulging was quite easy really--I just put quill to paper and there you go. That and the fact I wasn't trying to impress you at the outset made it easier to be honest about things I haven't shared with others before (like the fact I considered having a sham marriage). You've responded so well it made it so that I could keep being honest, even now when I kinda do want to impress you because I've been reminded of just how much I fancied you fifth and sixth year (yes, even when you were being a gigantic tit).
Harry put out the order to bring Parkinson and Zabini in for questioning and owled Draco to let him know he'd be working late that night on his case. He added a post script suggesting that Draco lie low until things calmed down and to make sure his wards were in peak form as a precaution.

You also made me laugh with your comment about the Weasley women. When did you become clever?

Harry chuckled to think of it and opened the door for Draco with a smile on his face.

I found a marionette of you and thought you might find it amusing. It has your old school uniform and spectacles, the big circular ones that used to magnify your eyes so it was easier to see their remarkable colour...hideous though the frames were.
"Save it please," Harry prudently requested. "You're tempting enough as it is. If you start in with the dirty talk, I'm just going to apparate us home." (Though he smiled wryly when he said it, he was being completely sincere.)
Harry's heart quickened as Draco shifted on the bed, the easy movement at odds with his supposedly reluctant words.
"What about you? Why did you start reading?"
"No, he didn't ask me out," he answered through gritted teeth (embarrassed at both the conversation and the tiny thrill Janine's idea had sparked). "I made an assumption about him that was wrong and he, very reasonably, took offense."
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion. Morias went to school with them? Why didn't he know him, then? It must be a penname. And Malfoy said it was a clue.
...Okay, maybe he was a little delirious. But at least some of that was because he had Draco Malfoy, naked and willing, in his bed.
Of all the questions Malfoy could have asked, that, at least, was an easy one.
*****
If they went too far it might ruin the tentative relationship they were developing. It was like ripping skin off, forcing his mouth away from Potter's with a loud gasp. He squeezed Potter's fine, firm arse once before both hands moved to still his rolling hips.
Harry, for his part, was far from calm, but he remained silent. In the tense moment that followed Teddy squirmed free from Andromeda's grasp and came barreling into him, peppering him with a barrage of questions and comments faster than a speeding Snitch. "Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry! It's your birthday! We surprised you! Were you very surprised? Why were you kissing Cousin Draco? There's gonna be cake! With

He came to stand beside Draco and kiss him hello.

Draco leaned back against the tiled wall as his cock was touched. He grabbed Harry's wrist, but not to push away or direct, just holding onto him as he watched his lover stroke him.
"I am here in an official capacity," he replied. "This isn't how I would choose to spend a Saturday night if left to my own devices."
“I think it’s to do with whatever that was back there,” he replied, showing tremendous restraint by both chewing

And where did Ron get off using one of Molly's looks on Harry, anyway?
"No," he smiled. "Not too weird."
(That was sarcasm.)

Face heating with embarrassment and the remnants of the anger that had spurred his outburst, he forced himself to calm. His breath whistled through his nose as he fought to keep himself from panting. He couldn't bear to survey the room to see who might be watching their little spat but the smart money was on everyone (and most especially Janine). Overhead, the lights buzzed harshly.
You would think that after all of his dealings with Gladys, Harry would know better than to be caught flat footed by a would-be paramour. He allowed himself one moment of indulgent self-pity--he had a warm, willing, interesting, and attractive man on top of him, and honor demanded that he extricate himself post-haste.
"You can show me all the best spots," he suggested. "And I will keep my hands to myself...If you want me to, that is," he grinned.
Harry waited to see where this was going.

This gift is another muggle one. Be careful with it--it scratches easily and doesn't work as well once it's been damaged. It's called a Compact Disc (CD for short) and it's really quite brilliant. I've put a bunch of my favourite Christmas songs on there. Muggle and Wizard bands, both. You have to use a CD player to listen to it, but Arthur has one you can borrow until your next gift comes.

He exhaled hard enough to make his fringe flutter, catching himself mid-psychotic rant. "I've only had like three conversations with him," he amended, somewhat calmer, "so who the hell even knows if this will go anywhere. But I want to try."

I suppose if I'm honest it does make me feel somewhat lonely, but I have no one to blame but myself there. You have to actually go out and
He beckoned Draco to lean forward so he could whisper to him. "I don't believe we will need to make an official statement to the press this evening," he murmured, glancing subtly at the intrepid reporter to indicate why. "Unless you want to, that is. I'm willing."
Yes, that means I, too, find you desirable. Or in laymen's terms, I fancy the pants off you. Always did, you blind fool.
It was only after the pain had (mostly) subsided that he realized how very uncomfortable the rest of him was. His skin was once again sticky with long-cooled sweat, his spine bent at an unpleasant angle, the arm he had tentatively put around Malfoy (to prevent him from accidentally rolling onto the ground! Certainly nothing untoward) was half-numb from the effort, and he had a persistent itch under his right shoulder blade that he couldn’t possibly reach without disturbing the precarious balance of their perch. In spite of all that, if he was perfectly being honest with himself...it was rather nice to be sitting there holding Malfoy.

My Darling Harry,
Zabini, wearing a ridiculous hat, drifted off to charm a gaggle of witches. Parkinson, wearing an equally ridiculous 'dress', departed with her tongue in some bloke's ear, abandoning Malfoy to his own devices.
you were a kid. No one can blame you for what you did,” he asserted (Draco’s expression was one of obvious disagreement). Harry waived the unspoken argument aside. “All that is beside the point. My point is, a bit of nerve damage isn’t going to keep you from your goals. You can use a wand and you will. Hell, if you put your mind to it, you could probably even do wandless magic. Merlin knows you’ve got the wizarding pedigree for it.”
Before Harry could grab for his wand or snap at his friend, Draco said quite loudly, "I made ice cream cake for dessert! Uh, Harry introduced it to me a couple of weeks ago. Until then I thought ice cream cakes were literal cakes made out of ice cream- you know, shaped? From... Ice cream."
Harry rolled his eyes. "So noted."
My letter was completely sincere! Every part of it. I wasn't trying to make a big deal about the fancying you bit, I just wanted to cheer you up.
Restrained? I wouldn't do anything you didn't want me to, sugar lump!

Your dangerous tendencies are exactly what attracted me to you in the first place these past few years. I have no qualms with seeing more of it, though I suppose I should be good.
Through sheer force of will, Harry prevented his eyes from traveling any lower than Malfoy's waist. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to stop him from noticing the way Malfoy's nipples were visible through the clingy material of his shirt or wondering what else might be seen if he let himself look.
"No, mate," he groaned with disbelief. "You didn't."
"Had to learn when I began to live alone. No house elves. This is actually something I concocted myself, a cross between Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna. I don't like Parmesan cheese or the big noodles and meats in lasagna, so I took what I liked from each one day and put it together. It came out exactly how I wanted it."

"Do tell if you figure it out." Malfoy's affected air of nonchalance wasn't quite convincing, not even to Harry. "I am rather interested in knowing."
Malfoy's eyes sparkled.
On the topic of pureblood expectations, I was under the impression that being gay didn't get you off the hook for begetting an heir. Not that I blame you. Ginny was none-too-pleaded about the fact I had a difficult time getting it up with her. (Does the line "it's not you, it's me" ever work with anyone?)

Dearest Harry,
Ron blinked. Draco was frowning in disapproval, but his voice had been steady. But it wasn't his words that caused his belly to cool signifigantly or his tone, but his eyes. They were down toward the floor, staring at the tiles like a crup being punished. He nodded.
The blonde, now comfortable, smirked cockily up at his lover.
You ninny. You are not still contagious. Does your skin have a greenish tint? Still sparking when you sneeze? I highly doubt it. But if you truly don't want a dashing and heroic rescue, that is your loss.
Dear Harry,
"I know your knife skills are good, Mr. Potions Prodigy," he declared with a smirk, dropping the vegetables on the counter on his way to the refrigerator to retrieve the chicken and coconut milk, "so get over here and work for your dinner. I'd like that onion cut into eighths, the potato cubed, and the carrots thinly sliced. I'll get started on the protein. There's another apron in that drawer," he pointed with his elbow since his hands were full, "and the knives are in the block."

"The lubricant with a warning label a full page long. 'Guaranteed to give three times the orgasms in a single romp'," he said, quoting the ribald advert for the product. "So, one becomes three, two becomes six, and so on. We're still young so we could rest between. Achieving thirteen in a day is entirely doable!"

Malfoy, for his part, was coated in a sheen of perspiration and his hair had come completely unbound. It framed his face with wild, sweaty tendrils, his deep-set eyes were fever bright. And he was grinning like a loon.
"You don't seem the type to enjoy flowery words and sweet nothings, so I'll say this... Either take off your clothes and let me feel your thick, hot cock inside me or I'm taking tops his time."
Dear Malfoy,

"You are most gracious," Draco replied, offering his hand in turn. Arthur shook it stiffly and made his way to the back of the house. A few minutes later, the crack of apparation signaled his departure.
The dizzy, chaotic feelings of the afternoon coalesced into pure and simple want. It pooled hot and heavy in his gut.

That's a load of bollocks and you know it. And don't think I didn't notice your conspicuous absence from Transfiguration today. Don't tell me that after everything you've put up with this year,

Lucius eyed the Auror's office with an undisguised look of disdain. It was far too small, the desk was cluttered, the place smelled of commoner's tea, and the lights were giving him a headache. The elder Malfoy sneered as he casually made his way from the door and a mere foot from Potter's desk. With a clearing of his throat he schooled his features and stared down his nose coldly at the man, exactly as he did when Potter was a boy.
Harry was spared the executioner’s wand. For another day, at least.
"Have you heard back from the publisher about
He was wearing the same suit he'd had on at the wedding when they met--this time with the top button undone--and he was looking forward to seeing Draco's reaction to it. He was also eager for their actual date. He'd planned this one with Hermione's help and thought Draco would be more than pleasantly surprised.
some of them, for Merlin's sake. They also know that I fancy you, though I've hardly made that a secret--you were probably one of the last to figure it out.
Harry smiled to remember it as he made his way back from lunch at the local sandwich shop. The walk afforded him both the opportunity to stretch his tired legs and enjoy a bit of fresh air. Daydreaming was a bonus.
He'd skipped the afternoon meal in favour of his experiments because he was nearing a breakthrough. To make matters worse, it seemed his metabolism was heightened in this form--his gut was on the verge of digesting itself.
Harry made short work of his denims, avoiding eye contact as he pushed them down to his ankles. Curiosity quickly got the better of him, however. It had been some time since he’d let someone see his injury by the light of day. And even then, it hadn’t been on ruddy display. Within the span of a heartbeat he was overcome with the need to see Malfoy’s reaction. Would it be disgust? Revulsion?
He gave another startled gasp when Harry surged against him almost forcefully enough to unseat him. He recovered to bear down hard once more.
Harry shut and locked the door and cast a

Besides, I admit I have wanted to ask you on a- to spend time with me anyway. That wasn't a side-effect of any hospital mishap.

"Come off it," Malfoy grumbled irritably, crossing his arms before his chest. "Malfoy's fine. I'm not worried about any of these old codgers alerting the Prophet to my whereabouts." He was looking about the facilities and the handful of other patients therein, many of whom were, in fact, elderly (and utterly uninterested in the likes of a toffy blonde with a sour attitude and a limp, Harry thought).

Harry's chest constricted painfully with a surge of both guilt and love. "Arthur--" he choked.
"Well,

It wasn't the Garden Room at the restaurant nor the gardens of the manor, but the wild flora stretched out across an expansive back yard (also not as large as the manor) and displayed many colors and sounds. There were a couple of trees from which birds sang, a rabbit could be seen hopping in the grass, there were crickets playing--completely wild and oddly peaceful.
Given his languor, Harry wasn't sure if the man had intentionally misunderstood him or if he was sincere in his reply. Either way, he'd have to rephrase his question. He took another large swallow of firewhiskey first.
He reached out his free hand toward the opening of Potter's top near his neck while the Auror was staring away from him to the crowd and gently grazed the skin he met with careful fingertips.
It makes sense that you would want to create the family you never had growing up. Two children is the most appealing number to me, but I likely could be persuaded to go higher. Not that you've any interest in my stance on the matter.
"Come on," Harry smiled, holding a hand out to help him up. Draco poured out of the chair and wrapped himself sinuously around Harry, loose and languid as a cat. It was a nice change from the tense and tetchy energy he'd crackled with before. Harry glanced at the wine bottle and noted that it was empty; Draco's really taken his instruction to heart.

"Hm," was all he said in reply.
"Let me tell you something, princess," he growled next to Draco's ear, "I don't need a wand to undress you."
Potter grinned. "Of course, Your Majesty."

Harry did a quick inspection and counted at least four individuals attending to the scene. All but Janine pretended not to have been watching. She--cheeky bint--gave a double thumbs up. Harry waved her off.
In short order, they got their ducks in a row and had the waitress brought in for questioning, making especially sure to file all of the appropriate paperwork in advance this time around to avoid another debacle like the one with Zabini and Parkinson. Once again, Harry stayed out of sight and let Ron do the interrogating, deeming it especially prudent in light of the incident the night previous.

"Actually," he responded, full-throated and low, "I was rather looking forward to that suck." He punctuated the words with another firm roll of his hips.

Really, though, given that she and Ron are rather visibly dating, it shouldn't be hard to figure out my identity and understand why I was reluctant to approach you directly.
"Rosie is almost a year. She's got the Weasley ginger gene and Hermione's curly hair. Fortunately for her, she takes more after her mother in the looks department," he smirked. "She's sharp as tack and devious enough already to have us worried she'll be sorted Slytherin."
Lucius stared at the Auror in total silence for a few long seconds. Just as it seemed Potter's impatience was rearing its ugly head again, that was when he chose to shift and speak.

And for the second time that day, he was awakened unexpectedly.
Hurry over.
He didn't bother to pull out as he flopped heavily on Draco's back like a sack of potatoes, breathing against his hair and hugging the blonde's waist as he slowly came down from his incredible high.
"Like this? You want more?" His voice was rough and low as he half-spoke, half-groaned. "I haven't just... Used fingers in a while... I forgot how fucking tight it feels inside."

Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco needed help. He couldn't so much as hold his wand in this infernal form, let alone wield magic.
Malfoy opened for him without a breath of hesitation, setting Harry's blood aflame.
Salazar, he needed his body back.
And what ever happened to the girl Weasley? And the rest of the Golden Trio? Are they married yet? Popping out curly-headed, ginger-haired children by the dozen? If not, it is only a matter of time, I'm sure.
Draco couldn't decide what to do. He spent a good majority of time awake and flinging his wardrobe around or owling letters that he had meant to send or make at Harry's, getting a howler from his publisher for being late a week with the rough draft (crafty woman waited until after he sent in the rough draft), and receiving/devouring in a nervous fit very expensive chocolate from his mother.

Draco fell back against the table, but before he had a chance to make any smart quips about their situation the Gryffindor was on him again--roughly driving his cock into Draco's own hardened member. He gasped aloud, his hands gripping Harry's waist tight.

So much for his 30 whole seconds of thinking exclusively work-appropriate thoughts.
Harry arched his back to push into Draco's demanding hands, spreading his legs wider for better access. With their torsos pressed together, his own hands wandered from his partner's hips--one grasping the hairs at the back of Draco's head in order to pull him down close enough for Harry to bite his thin lower lip as the other slithered beneath Draco's thigh and lifted. Their cocks met with the action and Harry didn't hesitate to grind against him.

"Sorry for doing that without warning," he apologized after they'd landed (referring to the apparation, not the punch). "We can go to Grimmauld if you'd rather, but I didn't want to presume."

"That's right," Draco chuckled. "Look who I'm talking to. Mr. My-Life-Is-Always-Crazy."
Harry refused to let himself think about what would have happened if he weren't there and Draco had been alone, or whether Parkinson's threats were genuine. Even thinking about not thinking about it was enough to make the caged beast within him snarl and snap for blood. He focused instead on the smell of Draco's hair and the feel of his back and the way he swayed into him, unsteady but trusting.

Harry bit his tongue. Rather savagely. He wanted to rip Ron a new one, but doing so would undermine Draco's bid for civility so he settled for glaring bloody murder and giving himself permission to hex the git if he mouthed off again. He made a point, however, of kissing his boyfriend on the top of his blond head when he set a plate in front of him...and dropping Ron's on the table with a ringing clang.
He licked his lips a second time (unrelated to the first).
she wanted to get back at me? We had been engaged and she used to spout nonsense about our happy future together. Half the time in class she'd send me fluffy love notes... We had a lot of arguments about it."
He would rather not have made the connection. Not only was the idea more than a little disturbing, it threatened to engender a kernel of sympathy in him, which was more than he wanted to give Lucius, slimy two-timing bastard. Ignorance really was bliss.

"So I take that to mean you're as terrible a dancer as you were during the Yule Ball?" Draco did drop his hand, but only as far as his hips; both palms were perched on the planes of his waist. "Besides, when does your presence
"And I'm taking this!" Draco snapped as he grabbed a baguette, slamming the door open and letting it close with a loud clang of brass hinges. Draco bit angrily into the bread as he ruminated on Dimitri's words, stomping angrily down the road. All associates of Voldemort and Death Eaters were stripped of their magic, forced to live as a muggle in the world they used to know and love. Usually, a person accused of mingling with dark forces was stripped entirely of their magic and then killed in order to assure they could never come back. But for Draco, the boy who was given one last chance to live, he was granted simple incantations. His wand was confiscated and destroyed, insurance that he would never do any conjuring more advanced that simple levitation and manifestation. Sure, Draco could do cheap parlor tricks: bring objects to himself, make objects disappear, but other than that he was as defenseless as a newborn.
"You don't have to look so scared, you know," Harry half chuckled, slicking back the strands of hair that were sticking out. He was slightly amused to see Draco squirm. It was both entertaining and endearing to watch. He looked more...innocent now. Less sharp and malevolent. It was like growing up with an angry and vicious kitten only to realize years later that they were just scared. Draco attempted to calm down, sitting back in his seat and uncrossing his legs. Harry's lips curled at the corners, only slightly. "I'll be back late."
Getting dressed in his robes, Draco powdered a little blush on his cheeks and nose and spritzed himself with a small vial of perfume he had snuck from his mother's boudior.  The blond made his way down to the dining hall, which was already bustling with cheerful energy as other students attempted to get their daily fill. Some kids from the Slytherin table beckoned Draco over, kind smiles and warm eyes. Draco doesn't even know if he remembers their names. The boy sat down gingerly, picking up a muffin and picking at it. He watched the scene before him from the lense of an outsider. Periodically, someone would include him in the conversation, but soon be bored of his answer and move onto the next topic. Draco didn't mind, he was used to such conversation. As most people know, Slytherin students were mostly the sons and daughters of politicians, actors and actresses, and other high officials. They were all poised and cunning and snooty and rich. Future entrepreneurs, politicians, doctors and professors. Draco, perhaps to them, was just a pretty little air-headed heir. They were curt and perhaps even slightly rude, but Draco grew to not mind. After all, these were his...friends? Companions? Even if they didn't remember his birthday.
Dear Potter,
Harry needn't have worried: Draco only had eyes for him.
the turtleneck--the material was too delicate.
Something Malfoy had said niggled at his brain. "You don't get out much anymore, do you?" he asked.
At Malfoy's involuntary flinch and subsequent wary, wide-eyed expression, Harry came to his senses.
"Chocolate is good for health and soul! Especially when combined with red wine," Draco countered with a superior sniff. He eyed the fries and their almost carrot orange color with the same trepidation as the burger... Though that had turned out well. He broke off an end with careful minstration and popped it into his mouth--chewing slowly it as if to discern all its ingredients.
Draco nodded curtly for greeting and he received much the same treatment back, with an added dubious glare from Weasley. However, in the interest of Harry and not wanting to be rude, Draco quickly offered a smile that was somewhat awkward but at least it hadn't been a sneer.

And, really, what did Draco think he had come over for? Between Harry's current nudity, the interest he made quite clear in his letter, and the ruddy photograph of him wanking to climax, he'd thought it was rather obvious what his intentions were.
"I was excited?" Draco offered with a cheeky grin and only a hint of genuine apology. Harry rolled his eyes.
Ginny took one look at them and burst into tears. Exactly two seconds after that, all hell broke loose.
Harry took the offered forkful if for no reason other than his need for a pleasant diversion. It was a good one, at least. The cheesecake was smooth and tangy, the fruit acidic and not too sweet (but still enough to make his jaw tingle).
"... I didn't realize what I said would make you so upset. I'm sorry."
I may be leaving work early. Maybe. You should convince me as to why this is a good idea by providing more details.
Malfoy jerked out of his grasp abruptly and put two feet of space between them, glowering.
He held the tiny sun between both hands, staring into its yellow-orange center until his vision went white, then, without warning, he crushed it to nothing with an echoey clap.
"You're going to have to take up painting then. It's the only thing for it,” he proclaimed, enjoying the conversation and realizing with a pang how much he’d missed it. “Just do one of the modern muggle styles--all those primary coloured blobs and paint splatters with pretentious titles that may as well have been done by children. She won't know you've only just begun!"
"What did he do?" Draco asked as soon as he opened the door.
Coming out as...not straight (he wasn't sure yet what box he fit in, just the one he didn't) would make waves. Doing so with Draco Malfoy might cause a typhoon. And you know what? He was fine with that. The only things he worried about were the possibility of upsetting his loved ones (and even then, their opinions only held so much sway) and Draco being in danger for his association with him. But if Draco was willing to take the chance, Harry certainly was, too.
******
? Ha ha... ha... Erm, anyway! So, one of the main reasons this has taken so long is because I didn't have internet access on my computer. My tablet, sure, and my phone, yes, but both of those are annoying to the point of giving me an aneurysm when I try to do things like edit chapters and then post them up, so... Yeah.
Draco stood with his fresh cup of pink sparkling vodka and watched the Auror under a casual gaze.
Or not.
At any rate, if you mean to take her advice about writing, we are doing that already, so I can only assume you were referring to her charming assertion that we shag. I am certainly not opposed to the possibility, especially knowing that you might be amenable to such an idea (which was quite the surprise, I must say) but she was mistaken about it being my primary motivation. What I am interested in is a

"We were just getting to the good stuff," Hermione pouted, surrendering Harry's seat and returning to her own. "At least tell me this, Draco," she bargained amiably, "do they stay together or is it just a holiday fling?"
as I say."
******
"That feels... Weird and good at the same time..." Draco commented, though words left him as his entrance was slowly invaded by the stiffened end of his tongue--the pink muscle teasing his entrance.
Draco didn't want to think of the letters Potter might be sending his other friends (were they friends?) in his addled state. But if it was possible, just possible--
Draco frowned deeply. "Stupid? Why?"
"I wouldn't mind, honestly, since it would cement my claiming of you, but that woman annoys me. She keeps tapping my face or shoulders with her breasts," Draco sneered, but didn't relent none the less. He used his left hand to capture Harry's, the one gripping his wrist, and with his right now freed once more cupped and rubbed Harry's cock. "Don't worry, I just want to touch it a little. When she gets back I'll stop."
," Draco corrected, pursing his lips at Harry in the way that signified his disapproval. Hermione and Ron looked affronted (but course they did; it sounded like a long time when Draco put it like that!). Which was right bloody fantastic--now
"You have got to be fucking kidding me!"
At any rate, I became an Auror to address the debt I owe to society. Put simply, people died because of me, ergo I must do my part to save lives with all the means at my disposal. Not that that will ever make it up to the individuals and families who were hurt by my actions, but nothing can, really.
"Of course I am," he replied as he lifted his legs around Harry's waist to pull him in close. "And you... Are too damn handsome for anyone's good."
Dear Draco,
Malfoy consented with a curt nod and Harry wasted no time in doing so lest his mercurial patient change his mind.
Blaise gave Draco a dark smirk.
"On the double!" Draco added, full of cheek.
"You--How did--I am stuck between extremely turned on and impressed. I've heard of some wizards and witches who could move things or do simple spells with their minds, but

He moaned into Harry's mouth at the heady urgency of his kisses as he clasped his hands over his (boyfriend's?) trim waist. Their lips slid together and Draco's tongue darted inside. It was hot, wet, and wonderful.

The rapid burst of questions wasn't how a victim/witness interview was supposed to go, but he was too excited to care.

"Harry," he moaned again, "I'm--!"
Perhaps the only thing Harry hated more than weddings was politics.

Even to his own ears, it sounded like so much meaningless chatter, though some of his hisses and the lower register growls were fairly expressive, at least.
A small whimper escaped as Draco was unexpectedly, and rather roughly, bitten. His cock quickly began to harden.
I may have to come to your residence to teach you a thing or two about common courtesy.
Both his legs were forced to remain flat on the chair as Harry had his thighs pinned down with his superior weight. He smirked up at his lover as he bucked like be had before--just barely grazing Harry's balls.

All things considered, Harry was in a rather fine mood when he arrived at the office, and the day continued looking bright...excepting an awkward 'don't ask, don't tell' moment at the outset when Ron had wondered what put that dopey smile on his face. They got past it.
"You sound jealous," he half-murmured, half-moaned as his body began to writhe and twitch over Harry with the imminence of his climax. "No one... I've never done this with anyone except myself..."
to be alone in his home except Hermione, Ron, Arthur, and Molly. Not even Ginny or George got a pass unless they were chaperoned by one of the four (Merlin knows he dealt with enough practical jokes and booby traps even when George had supervision).
"I'll tell you what," the blonde began in a tired, though loud slur. "I'll not speak until after I wake up... If you'll help me get my boots off. I love these, but they take forever to undo."
*****
Draco rolled his eyes as he was given orders. Of course he had to help. He gave a very put-upon sigh but consented nonetheless with a long drag of the chair from the table. At least the idea of labor was enough to allow his erection to subside.
Draco keened, eyelids falling shut and fingers digging into his own thighs. Harry waited until he had his attention again--irritation flashing in his silver gaze this time. "I love you," he said, before pushing home.
Draco positively wilted before Harry's eyes. He put on a brave front but his fidgeting hands (fluttering when he spoke and playing with the edge of his napkin when he was still) betrayed his anxiety.
He dropped his backpack on the floor, acutely aware of how dingy it looked in the pristine space. He avoided making eye contact with himself in the expansive, spotless mirrors for the same reason.
"Exactly," Harry retorted. "And you're apparently very flexible," he added as he openly leered at Draco's cock, relishing in the thrill of holding him captive. "Besides, we have all night. I'll let you bugger me next. Now where can I lay you down? Decide before I choose to throw you on that sofa-thing again--I am not replacing it if it breaks."
, he smirked to himself, picking up the next piece of parchment in his inbox.

He shuffled Malfoy around until he was draped over one shoulder and they were facing the same direction. He propped the boneless tempter up with an arm about his waist. He then cast a disillusionment charm on the both of them and half marched, half dragged Malfoy to the Head Auror's office.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You're incorrigible," he chided, twisting out of the way.

Just for that, Draco tackled the impertinent brat. He should have learned by now Draco didn't have to be a ferret to
There was nearly a crow of triumph, nearly, as Draco was dragged onto the dance floor. Though he kept any noises to himself, he didn't bother to suppress the excited grin that nearly reached his eyes.
Draco protested for half a second before melting into the kiss. Harry was deeply pleased by the dazed, slow-blinking expression Draco wore when he pulled away a few seconds later.
Dear Potter,
"You sure do like your tarts," Ron laughed and shook his head at his best friend's antics as he moved to pull the first file from the in-box. "Maybe if the next fit bloke you saw was covered in the stuff you'd finally be willing to admit you like men."
*****
"It's your fault for making it so hard, you know," he informed Harry (with a chuckle at his unintentional innuendo) as he regarded the man below him. Harry was covered in smeared cum and his cock half-hard from Draco's ministrations. He brushed his hair back to distract his mind from noting exactly
Draco bit his bottom lip as he took a step back to appreciate Harry now that he was fully on display. His firm chest and abdomen were just as mouth-watering as they had been earlier--tempting Draco to touch, lick, and even bite. Harry had strong, stocky legs, perfectly proportioned to the rest of him, and well-toned arms. All of him shone with drying perspiration.
The orgasm itself was brief, but packed a punch. Two hard spasms wrung his balls dry as he unwittingly fulfilled Draco's request, painting the wall with a ropy strand of come that was quickly rinsed down the drain.
," he reminded him firmly (the smile easing the censure, he hoped).
"Where shall we go, then? I wouldn't say no to pre-dinner ice cream. Cheaper than any dessert they'd have at the restaurant anyway. Or we can stop by the Apothecary," Draco almost mentioned going to visit the Magical Menagerie, just before he thankfully remembered a certain snowy owl and the fact that Harry had never replaced her. "You have Granger for books so I'll spare you that, unless you want to go."
*****
He gave Draco a farewell kiss, but paused in the doorway on his way out. "I'd like it if you were here when I got back," he admitted over his shoulder, using up all his courage to do so. He left before Draco could reply.
He put his work frustration aside and straightened his suit in the mirror. He had a date to get to and a handsome bloke to pick up.
"I certainly haven't said anything," Hermione echoed, gentler now, coming to sit beside her husband. "I know how important your job is to you."
helpful today," he drawled, drawing each word out until it was practically a moan. "I'd like to show my appreciation. What's say we recreate your afternoon wank fantasy?"

"Shhh," Harry prompted, unable to say anything more. He couldn't afford the distraction, his attention strained enough as it was.
Draco glared but didn't try to escape. Good.
Draco gasped with genuine surprise. He stared, wide-eyed and shocked into speechlessness, up at his talented partner.
"Are these wards going to do anything nasty to me if I trip them?" Potter asked, frowning thoughtfully at the lines of magic crisscrossing the wood.
Not that I'll be anywhere close to finished when that happens.
"Minor bruising. Twisted ankle." Malfoy cleared his throat quietly before adding, "My pride suffered the worst of it."
...An animagus potion. Think of it! Easy to administer, widely accessible ingredients, minimal side-effects--he'd make a fortune from Ministry contracts alone! He just needed to fine-tune it. ...Along with a brew to reverse its effects.

"You can call Parkinson," he said warily, "but one-way only, please. I'm not interested in dealing with the possibility of unexpected visitors. Traps or no."

*****
He took the snowflakes out to inspect them up close. Their fractal patterns were visible through whatever Draco had crystallized them in. The smooth disc fit in the middle of his palm and he rubbed his thumb over its surface wonderingly.
They were his guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Hermione had gifted him one as a joke for his birthday last year because the love interest supposedly reminded her of him (which was all kinds of weird given the explicit sex scenes). But green eyes, black hair, a troubled past, and a fiery temper were such a staple of the genre that they were practically cliched at that point, though Morias did seem to favor the type more than most authors he had read so far. And his stories were exclusively of the homosexual persuasion, but for some reason Harry found them the most compelling. There was always an edge to them--heat and challenge and mutual strength--that was lacking in most of the novels with a female protagonist he'd tried. Even when the authors tried to give their heroines a spine, the women still ended up wilting under the touch of their skillful lovers. Harry would toss the book in the bin at that point. Morias's men, in contrast, never lost their character or convictions, even in the throes of passion. And that's why Harry had read every one of his novels even though he wasn't really bent.
He summoned their server for the check and settled it with a sizable stack of galleons. Draco excused himself to the loo.
"Bedroom, then? Is it clean this time or shall I avoid eye contact with anything besides you again?" Draco smirked.
"If that was meant to encourage me to hurry, you've got another thing coming," Harry replied archly, but he followed Draco all the same. He wanted to go on this date. Well, to accomplish the goal of going public with Draco, anyway. A good portion of him was dreading the public's response--if for no reason other than the hassle it would create for him at work--so he wanted to just do it and be done with it.
*****
Which was where Harry came in.
"You're so sexy, Harry," he purred, carding his fingers through the ample fur on Harry's abdomen. "And the noises you make...!"
*****
Malfoy paused, considering. He then inclined his head a fraction of an inch.
Dear Potter,
"Like
Maybe Malfoy noticed the beads sweat that had broken out on Harry’s forehead or perhaps it was the greenish tint to his complexion or the hunted look in his eyes, but he subsided and gestured for Harry to rejoin him on the couch.
Instantly on edge, Harry stood to go check on Draco. As he passed near Zabini, he couldn't shake the sensation that the man's date looked familiar, as well. Neither one paid him any mind.
Either anal was much more damaging than Harry'd been lead to believe or Draco was a whinging baby who'd exaggerated his experience with scary-sounding sex toys. He was inclined to believe the latter, but given that Draco'd been gracious enough to let him shag him, Harry felt he owed him the benefit of the doubt in this case. (Though it certainly wasn't encouraging him to let Draco have a go any time soon.)
The arched window opened to admit the bird who dropped to his desk just outside his scattered parchment and quills with a hoot, sticking its leg out. Draco noted the seal of the Ministry hanging from a small badge around its neck and chuckled.
7 is fine. I don't get off work until 6 so that will be perfect. Should I bring some leathers, food, anything at all, or just me?
Potter's hand finally got in on the action, squeezing Draco's prick once before it matched the tempo of his thrusts. It was heaven.
Dear Harry,
"Well, those atrocities you used to wear never did you justice anyway. As for me... No, not really. I don't see the point anymore. At first, I would go to clubs and parties in an attempt to have fun and act my own age again, even for a little while... But the hatred of The Mark doesn't leave you anywhere you go. One man at a rave tried to stab me with a needle full of air. Between daily spittle, occasional rocks, and curses or hexes being thrown my way I just found it easier to remain at home."
He remembered belatedly that it had been Draco's first blowjob, which likely had more to do with his speedy release than any masterful technique on Harry's part. Still, he congratulated himself on a job well done.
Dear Malfoy,
"So you've said," Draco replied, his smugness knowing no bounds. (He'd damn well
be okay."
Lucius could tell Harry seethed. The fact that the usually fiery Gryffindor could keep his mouth shut for as long as he did (without interrupting) perhaps indicated Draco's good influence.
"Are you sure you'll still want to sleep the day away if you go to bed at a reasonable hour?" he asked carefully.
Before now, anyway.
needed to be involved, Harry offered the vague, "He doesn't know how to take 'No' for an answer," and silently begged the women to leave it at that. He fidgeted in his seat, never having gotten used to being the centre of attention despite all the practice.
Granger looked at the book again. He could practically see the gears working in her brain. "Caesar shift, transposition, or a book cipher?"
Draco scooped a scant spoonful of the rich, steaming soufflé and appraised it. It looked like perfection. He hovered the spoon over his bowl and waited for it to cool on its own.
*****
"What is the meaning of this, Harry?" he asked, hurt and disappointment writ clear in his weathered features. He urged his still-tense son into the wingback chair beside him. With few exceptions, everyone had been rooted to their respective spots since the initial
Draco smirked at the Auror and winked, meeting Potter's sarcasm with coquettish teasing. "I think I could get used to waking up with you as the first thing I see," he noted wryly. He took a nice, deep breath and slung his legs over the couch.

******
"So, Granger, I heard you were going to interrogate details of my next books out of me?"
******
Your go.
*****
"Hold this will you?" he prompted, passing the bunched skirts up so his hands would be free to work. When Potter obliged, he wrapped one hand around his shaft and cupped his balls with the other, appraising their texture and weight. (Excellent on both counts.) Rolling them skillfully between his fingers, he flicked out his tongue to trace a thick vein that ran from base to crown, finishing with a swirling lick around the glans.
******
Draco widened his legs as Harry began to grind. Even between their clothes (or rather, two sets of Harry's clothes), the friction of their cocks was electrifying. He moaned softly, allowing Harry's tongue full access to his mouth.
Harry wasn’t about to let Malfoy fall into a pity pit. Not now. Not after they’d come so far. "You should take them up again," he said briskly, forestalling an unwanted shift in Malfoy’s mood as well as his own natural curiosity about the revelation (there’d be another opportunity to ask about Malfoy’s apparent artistic side later if he played his cards right). "It's good practice. Now quit stalling and go get changed. It’s workout time.”
Pretending calm he didn't feel, he turned a smirk of playful accusation on Harry. "See? I told you that you mess with my brain. You're too sexy."
"That, and the truth is... I just like touching it. But I'll be good, for now. Tell me about work."
Potter, the insufferable imbecile, sat there in his damp towel, grinning and clapping like he was at the bloody circus. He kept remarking how clever Draco was and that his "tricks" were brilliant.
"Bugger!" he yelped, as yet another blue shock lanced up his arm, only partially diffused by his weakening shield charm. He shook his hand out, trying to rid himself of the unpleasant pins-and-needles feeling.
******
Draco frowned at the tone in Potter's voice. It was almost like sympathy, or at least close enough to make the blonde cringe. His eyes lowered to his glass coffee table as he tried to regain his confident smirk.
"Hey," he said in a matey sort of way (and feeling awkward for it). "You look great. Really. Not that anyone needs to in a place like this, but you do." Malfoy met his eyes in the mirror and Harry went on, as if paying the man a compliment was something he did all the time and the utter strangeness of it wasn't making his palms itch. "Your clothes are top-of-the-line, high performance, and perfectly coordinated. Right down to the £200 Nike's you're sporting." He nodded at the all-black trainers in question and wondered just how much Malfoy'd spent on his clothes; the shopgirl must have had a ruddy field day with him.

Ron listened intently to his friend's explanation, realizing briefly that Harry didn't have to justify his own life to anyone--and usually wouldn't--but he was being made privy to it anyway. He frowned, though, concern writ plain on his face.

"Draco?" he called uncertainly (shaking his wand into his hand as a precaution).
I only meant I know you are capable of having "the best" among pure-bloods, so I found it surprising you'd apparently want me so bad. As for Parkinson, if things work out I'd thank her. I was tempted to keep the photo (it was rather captivating) but I would have felt guiltier about it every second if I did.
Draco nodded through the update, giving minimal encouragers where appropriate and only paying partial attention. Harry was just too earnest and sweet. He needed a bit of ruffling. Especially for that last smart comment. (Draco was also uninterested in discussing the Weasleys and their brood any further.)
He'd rather make conversation while the Hall emptied out than fight his way through the crowd.
Where do you stand on the matter?
"...How many did you say you destroyed?" he squeaked.

Silence fell between them as the machine whirred in time with Malfoy's movements. Flexion at Malfoy's jaw and temple betrayed that he was gritting his teeth.
Draco's head snapped up, questions and a whisper of hurt in his expression.
"To put it simply, they married out of obligation and wanted me to do the same. Being gay changes nothing. I'm sure that on some level they did care for each other very much, as they do continue to be quite civil--even affectionate, but my father never planned to stay with her. I sometimes feel sorry for my mother, though her life today is apparently very exciting. She told me of exploring the pyramids just last week--the pyramids! My mother! But I think she was a lot like Pansy in that she had hoped it would be a permanent arrangement. When I broke things off--well... Nevermind."
"Well, you're young... Or you just don't have a kink for public sex. Do you even have any kinks?"
"I won't regret it in the morning," he insisted (to himself and Draco both). "I want the world to know."
"Holy shit," he exclaimed on a breath when it was through (many seconds later). "Are you all right?"
Malfoy cupped his own chin and tapped his pursed lips with his index finger, apparently considering.
You know how much I love you? A ton. And you know how you complain about me fidgeting and yawning at business meetings? Wouldn't that just be
I have heard you ramble so much about?"
Harry smirked. "Promise?" he asked cheekily, breaking off a piece of Draco's fish and eating it in one bite.

Plus a little bit extra.
Dear Draco,
"Want to turn over or just thrust into my mouth?" Draco asked in a dry, raspy voice. He was enjoying the delicious friction between their cocks, so much that when Harry would move to pause Draco would continue it by jerking his hips forward for more. "Want to fuck my throat, Harry? Or do you want me to fuck it for you...?"
?" The questions kept coming, an unstoppable torrent. "And if you want to sleep with him, why haven't you? The guy is supposedly pretty easy, and so are you for that matter. You never hesitated with a woman, anyway. What
, his id unhelpfully suggested. He ignored it.)
And that, more or less, was how he found himself shivering outside the Manor's gates in the murky time between days (where did one end and next begin, exactly?), blowing on fingers that were both numb and stinging from the combination of the damp cold and his several failed attempts to dismantle the wards keeping the wrought iron bars firmly shut.
There was one missing piece to the puzzle, however.
He had been serious about wanting to go all night.
"But, Harry, they won't talk to you!" Draco protested. It was strange, the almost high-pitched quality his voice took as he spoke. "One of the first things we learn as children is to always call a solicitor when it comes to discussing possible criminal involvement and the consequences thereof," he explained as he was coaxed back onto the cushy sofa once more. "Even if... Even if it's true, I know what buttons to push and what not to say. And I'm a friend, so they wouldn't think to mistrust me."
The next day, Draco arrived at the Ministry exactly on time--the clock was just chiming noon in the lobby. Despite the clawing fear and the racing of his thoughts he schooled his features into a confident smirk and looked for his escort. His hands were jammed into the pockets of his knee-length coat to hide how much they shook. It wasn't terribly cool that day (actually, it was nearly blistering), but certain standards required certain dress codes. Coming to the Ministry meant he would need something to hide himself in, so to speak, in case he needed to, in fact, hide... Like his hands. Or the occasional leap of his chest at random noises.
Harry's face fell into the space between Draco's shoulder blades where he huffed hot breath and took in the scent of Draco's sweat mixed with some sort of (most likely expensive) cologne. He bit into the man's shoulder and closed his eyes tight to hold his orgasm at bay.
Potter,
*****
*****
He stood and pulled Draco flush with him for a lengthy snog. "You look great," he murmured when they finally broke apart (as predicted). He ran his hands over Draco's well defined curves and counted himself a lucky man.
Harry was surprised by Draco's gentleness with his feet (the affectionate way he held and rubbed each one was, oddly enough, a bit of a turn on).
"Our next appointment will be Monday," he said needlessly, leaning his hip against the counter and facing Malfoy at a somewhat less intimidating angle. "That should give you enough time to recover from today. And you're seeing Nancy tomorrow, yeah?" Malfoy tipped his head in confirmation. "You'll like her," Harry asserted. "She's sweet as treacle but doesn't take shit from anyone. You'll learn that sooner rather than later if you try to cop an attitude with her. But she's brilliant with all the fine motor stuff. She'll give you exercises to do at home and I can make some suggestions for how to modify them for a quill or wand. But when it comes to the work you and I are doing, no practicing on your own, ok? You need supervision for now."
