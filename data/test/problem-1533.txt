He couldn't just sit here and do nothing! If there really were Death Eaters involved, she was in grave danger.
"Beryll!" She exclaimed happily. It was her family's owl. Beryll held out his leg that had a letter tied to it and hooted softly. She gently stroked the owl's feathers before untying the letter.
"So is Draco going to get back his magic or not?", I hear you ask. And I promise you'll find out in the next chapter. Totally. This chapter went away with me again... But we're almost at the end. It hink there will either be one more chapter and an epilogue or two chapters plus the epilogue. So, stay tuned, dears <3 And leave me your thoughts :)
Thanks for reading!! if you’re liking it so far please leave comments or kudos, seeing it makes my day and keeps me motivated to write more!
Harry found himself looking forward to the time he was spending with Draco. Studying alone was boring, and even if they didn’t talk much, Harry felt having Draco there was comforting.
Except Harry doesn’t get anything done. He wants to tell Draco why he studies so late, he just can’t find the right words.
Harry looked around the Great Hall as the food appeared on the tables. His eye caught on the Slytherin table. Not many of them had come back. But the one person he had not wanted to see had. Draco Malfoy sat at the Slytherin table eating slowly. Like everyone else in the room.
BEFORE YOU START: TW/CW of offensive language (the f slur I’m sorry) and mature content (but nothing too bad idk how to write that... yet)
Hope you liked it! The next chapter may not be out for a while, the end of the month is super packed with trips for me.
I would also like to add in advance that I am apart of the LGBTQ+ community, but if I ever explain anything wrong please tell me and I will correct it :)
Edit: i totally forgot to make drinking a TW so here it is: the whole party scene has mentions of alcohol, Harry also gets very drunk.
“Come on, Harry,” Ron stood and held out a hand for his friend. “Let’s get cleaned up and then we can come back.”
Harry was sitting next to him, hunched over in a small chair, one hand resting in Draco’s. As the blonde stirred awake, Harry stood and leaned over Draco to look him in the eye.
Harry sighed and grabbed his Defense Against Dark Arts book and scroll. He dipped his quill in the ink and hovered the tip of it over the paper.
I might work on some one shots or short stories in the meantime, so look out for those if you’d like.
Just before he was discharged, standing with Harry next to the door, Madame Pomfrey pulled him aside.
Draco was huddled in the corner of the bathroom next to the sink. One of his arms was extended over his knee, in his hands was a blade, now covered in red. His other arm was tucked close to his chest. Blood soaked his clothes. His head was leaning back against the wall, his eyes closed.
“We were just getting along! Friends even!” Draco grumbled. “He just disappeared! I drove him away.”
Harry nodded slowly. He clenched his fist to stop them from shaking and steeled his breath. Harry patted his pockets, searching for his wand.
As they arrived back at the common rooms, Harry kept his arm around Draco and led him up to his room.
Ron nodded and pushed his way through the crowd, now bigger as more and more people had grouped together to see what had happened.
Draco ran to the Slytherin side of the dorms and pounced into Pansy, Blaise’s, and his enclosed room.
The expression on his face turned sour. "You're wasting my time with your nonsense, Potter." He took a step closer to her. She had to fight the urge to step backwards. "You know, I was honestly considering your peace offering but now I've changed my mind. Nobody threatens a Malfoy," he spat, taking another step toward her.
"Great. See you at eight then," she said, sending her a half-smile. She turned to go but Luna's voice made her turn back around.
. Something was tapping against her window. Haley sat up. An owl! She opened the window, letting the bird into the room. It was no ordinary owl that flew onto her bed. An eagle owl. She had never seen one of those up close. Malfoy owned one of them, didn't he? Was it his?
Despite the harsh words it seemed like there was something else he wasn't saying. She saw it in the way his left hand came up to rest on top of her own, interlacing their fingers over his chest as if he was trying to pull her inside his heart. His eyes, too, were two silver pearls of raw emotion, shimmering with an intensity that seemed both vulnerable and determined at the same time. And in that moment it was almost as if she was hearing the words he was trying to express silently.
"What…?" She whispered, feeling a hand on her arm, trying to steady her. She didn't understand. The words didn't make any sense at all. "That can't be… it doesn't make… he… what?"
She shook her head. The sight was too baffling. "I've never… I've never seen you in muggle clothes before. I thought you despised them."
It seemed so fragile… the moment. Like a storm was starting to brew around them and they were standing in the middle of it. It was always calm in the eye of a storm. But one wrong step could potentially send them into chaos and oblivion. But there was a different possibility as well. Another step might lead them to an entirely different place. A new world. Unknown but immeasurably beautiful. She wanted to see this world so badly. And she wanted to discover it together with Draco. Without having to hide her face underneath an Invisibility Cloak. Maybe there was hope yet. She could feel it. There was change in the air.
"You don't get it!" He shook his head and let go of her shoulders, giving her a little shove. The abruptness of the movement made her stumble backwards against the wall. "What do you think would have happened if he hadn't showed up? What do you think the Dark Lord would have done to him? Or to mother and me?"
"Well, I've gotta… there's still some homework I have to finish," Haley said awkwardly, not sure if he expected her to spend the whole day with him.
"Try to imagine your favourite drink," mum advises, sipping from her own cup, "Mmm. Strawberry and vanilla lemonade!"
"Bu-but, that's why I wanted to go to that stupid café with her! It was her who said that it was awkward," he grumbled.
But the moment he spotted her, his lips turned into a grin. It seemed like an unconscious reaction. Haley squashed the feeling of guilt surfacing in her belly.
Although their left hands weren't touching, Draco and Neville's fingers were connected through both of their wands.
"Did Potter make those for you, too?" Suddenly his presents didn't feel as special to him as they had before. Lovegood had received exactly the same! Well, technically she had made the gloves herself but still…
"It's just-" She buried her hands in her auburn locks, pulling in frustration. "What kind of retarded blockhead tells a girl she doesn't live up to his fantasies?"
"Malfoy, you mean? Are you fighting again?" Ron wanted to know. "I really don't get it. One day we hate him, then you date him, but it's only pretend, then it's not pretend and now…?" His brows furrowed in confusion. Haley wished she could explain. Why was all of this so complicated?
"But what-?" Before Ron could finish his question, Haley rushed past him, pulling him and Hermione down the hall, away from the class room.
Neville drew the curtain aside further and caught a glimpse of the sleeping boy. "Oh." He said quietly. "What happened to him?"
"I won't be able to make it tonight," she said, "But I'm free tomorrow night so if that's okay with him, we could meet then." Haley was sure she was blushing furiously. She felt weirdly exposed, saying all that. "Could you… tell him that?"
He walked toward the ledge through which the owls flew in and out. If she was out on the grounds, he should be able to spot her. But as expected, there was no sign of the girl either.
Haley wasn't sure whether to bring it up or not. But she wanted to hear her friends' thoughts on this so badly. Although, she could already guess what Hermione would say. "What if she didn't kill him? What if he's still… alive."
Opening her eyes, she saw he hadn't. Of course he hadn't. Instead he was leafing through a familiar looking journal…
Haley balled her hands to fists. No matter how much safer he felt behind that mask, there was no need for him to be this relentlessly cruel. She jumped to her feet. There was no way she was going to sit there and let herself be insulted in such a way. Painfully slowly she walked up to him until the distance between their faces was no bigger than the length of her wand. Haley knew what she'd say next would be just as cruel as Malfoy's words had been.
. You need to wake up or I’ll be late for Potions!” The surprisingly high voice continued to torment her. The hand shook her shoulder again.
He grinned, tugging at her hands playfully. He seemed bubbly like a kid with too much energy. Haley glanced around. Well, he had certainly released some of this excessive energy on her poor room.
So much for giving in easily. Malfoy walked a few steps down the hall toward an empty class room. He was obviously expecting her to follow him. Haley closed her eyes for a moment and inhaled deeply.
Before I have the chance to reply the bedroom door opens. A girl with white hair and a familiar feather dress gazes inside the room. She finds my eyes and gives me a pointed look. It's the kind of look that says
Seeing Haley with her green eyes and his trademark blonde hair did strange things to him. At first she had reminded him of his mother. But that hadn't lasted for long. She didn't have his mother's regal features that often made her appear distant and closed off. Instead, her round face was always open, clearly showing exactly what she felt most of the time. Familiar. In a different way. And then another thought had entered his mind. He had never seen anyone who was not a Malfoy with that particular hair colour.
That night when Haley entered the common room after another session with Umbridge, she hadn't expected anyone to still be up. Yet, here they were, two figures sitting in front of the fireplace. At the sound of the portrait opening, they had looked up so Haley recognized the alert faces of Hermione Granger and… Ginny Weasley.
"Looking forward to it." And suddenly it was like they had never been fighting. It felt good to finally have her friend back. The way the other girl smiled at her, told her that she felt the same.
"I'd prefer the real you over that bearded version any day," Haley teased but she knew he understood what she was trying to tell him. That she didn't need to pretend any more. That she wanted to be with him. And she was no longer scared to admit that.
"Neville! Your fingers!" Haley exclaimed, grabbing his right hand and holding it in front of her eyes. There were burns all across his fingers, along with blisters reddening his skin. She was pretty sure they hadn't been there the last time she had seen his hands. But then, she couldn't even remember the last time she
"Thank you," the Ravenclaw answered with a cheerful smile. Ron dropped one of the turnips. He didn't even seem to notice.
With a sigh, he put down the quill and made his way downstairs. It ended up being Molly. She brought him some of her famous pumpkin pie and complained that he wasn't eating enough. She didn't stay long but informed him over a cup of tea in his kitchen that the Order was meeting the next day. Before she left she handed him a letter from Haley. His goddaughter. His stupid goddaughter who he terribly missed. He almost forgot saying goodbye to his cousin, that's how eager he was to read the letter. He broke the seal and fished out a small piece of paper. It was a good thing Sirius was already sitting down at his kitchen table because the words he found in the letter almost knocked him over.
"'ey. This is a pre-exam! No talking, everyone!" Hagrid instructed, pointing a massive finger in their direction.
Haley rolled her eyes. "I once woke up to my little brother jumping on top of me because he was scared of the ghosts beneath his bed. That was overwhelming."
"Okay, okay, I'll tell you," he said with a chuckle. "So judging from the way your boy keeps stealing glances at you whenever he thinks no one is looking – meaning whenever he doesn't have to pretend for anyone – I'm honestly surprised he hasn't offered his heart to you on a silver plate."
Haley closed her eyes, seeing the scenes clear in her mind. "He says I'm supposed to stay away from 'Malfoy'. And that he's evil and dangerous."
"No," I reply, narrowing my eyes to slits. He seems disappointed. At least that's what his pout seems to say.
Mum reaches for the cauldron but before she can dip her hand into the clear liquid, it turns to fire.
Just when she was about to pick up her spoon and try the ice cream, she noticed the frown on Draco's face.
But perhaps it was the reminder of the houses. Their rivalry. Maybe it had worked like a trigger, reminding him that they weren't supposed to get along. Hufflepuff. Ravenclaw. Slytherin. Gryffindor. Those houses. Hermione had always thought that it was stupid to split everyone up like that. To squeeze people who were only children into categories and put labels on them. To divide them and make them compete against each other. Wouldn't it be better to encourage unity and togetherness? Especially now, it was important to stick together and not let marginal differences further divide each other. It was always us and them. She wondered if there would have been a war, without the constant rivalry and animosity between Slytherin and the rest of the houses. Perhaps. Perhaps not. But the way it looked, they were just at the edge of a second wizarding war. Unless people started to learn from the past for once. But maybe this was a sign.
Haley followed his gaze and sure enough there he was. Draco Malfoy. He was leading a group of Slytherins toward the Great Hall like they were his entourage. Haley wondered whether it was all a big show. In his dream last night his housemates hadn't been that supportive. More the opposite really. But here he was, confident as ever. She couldn't stand him. And the thought that he dreamed about her in such intimate ways made her feel so angry and disgusted, she wanted to–
"Oh, well. It was a birthday present. My father has his ways." He said it like they were talking about nothing more spectacular than a visit to the zoo.
A moment ago, all he'd wanted to do was find Haley and make sure she was fine. Now… all he wanted to do was hide in the huge wardrobe in his room at home and never come out again.
"Who does he think he is?" She whispered to herself once her breathing was somewhat normal again. This was insane! Couldn't the git once and for all decide what he wanted from her? Fighting one another with words she could handle. Being ignored was bearable as well. But if he decided to be a jerk then he should just bloody well stick to his decision. What was she supposed to think when one day he behaved like an utter git only to act like he cared the next?
The girl's eyes wandered across the slightly crumpled letter with a frown. "Another one? What did Haley say when you showed her?"
The boy sighed and carefully stepped over the root toward the tree with the face. He leaned in close and whispered something she couldn't hear. Then, all of a sudden the vines came loose around her limbs.
He wasn't going to leave his mother behind. How could Snape even suggest that? "Right, turn my back on my family – you said that before. But I can't just–"
"Don't bother, Neville. There's no reason to-" Ron began. But the other boy was already at the door.
When they were out of hearing distance, Hermione stopped abruptly, taking a deep breath before turning to her friend with determination. "You have to tell him!" She stated, visibly trying to stay calm.
The boy glares at me for a moment, before turning back to his portrait and painting overly long vampire teeth into the corners of the girl's mouth.
As much as Haley would have loved to draw out this moment just a bit longer, she should probably let her mum have a look at him. And besides that, she was still worried about Neville. Had he woken up by now?
Wide green eyes looked up at him guiltily. "Oops," she said, biting her lips sheepishly. It should have annoyed him but her expression was just too endearing.
House elves really were helpful creatures. Even the thought of carrying Haley all the way up to the Gryffindor common room filled him with exhaustion. So, of course, he'd called for his old house elf and told him to help take her to her tower. He hadn't known, the elf would disapparate (or whatever it was house elves did) along with her right away.
"Let's just go down, all right?" Her friend walked toward the portrait door, leaving her to follow him.
All this time she had been afraid to let herself feel something for him. Because of their past. Because of his house and his family name. Because of all the little fights they had had and the cruelness he was capable of expressing toward others. And toward her as well. She had thought that she could never truly care about him because of all these reasons. But now she understood that there was more to the boy than just his faults. He was also capable of being caring and vulnerable and
He could just say no and be done with it. But the truth was, he wasn't done with it. Even though the Ravenclaw's explanation made perfect sense there was still a part of him that doubted. That felt like an insecure little boy. He hated feeling like that. He shook his head.
"I'm not going to skip, okay?" She replied impatiently. "There's just something I need to take care of. I'll see you in Charms!"
, she was already halfway across the pitch. Running, because in her detached state of mind her instincts had told her to jump off the broom and just
?” I wonder out loud, as Draco stops in front of a bar that has a painting of a man with a mad grin and a lute in his hand above the door. The boy winks and opens the door, gesturing for me to enter. Well. It does look nicer than
"Sometimes, it feels like an endless nightmare," he continued. "I just wish… I could finally wake up."
"Um… look at what?" As far as I can see, there are merely a couple of boards nailed to the wide oak tree.
Cautiously, he stepped around the unconscious Slytherins toward him. His arm was outstretched in a weird angle. And there… in his open hand – almost invitingly – were Haley and Hermione's wands. Quickly, Ron grabbed them, storing them safely in his wand pocket next to his own. For a split second, he swore he could see the boy's mouth twitch somewhat. Was he smirking?
"You wouldn't be that cruel… would you?" He asked carefully, searching her face for a lie. "You wouldn't… trick me like this? To get back at me?"
"No, not yet" Haley replied, squeezing his hand reassuringly. "Maybe I'll ask Pomfrey for another spoonful." She joked.
Harry jumped at the touch. He saw who was next to him and sighed. Looking back at Hermione, he gave her a troubled look.
Harry stopped caring about living with Draco and the other Slytherins and started to focus on school for once.
Madame Pomfrey arrived not long after Draco woke up. She did a final check-through of Draco, fussing over his wrists and making Harry give him some space to rest.
“Draco? Hey, hey.” Harry spoke softly, one hand absentmindedly going to Draco’s hair, brushing the strands away from his face.
I don't have a schedule for updating, I'm working on three fics right now, but I'll try to update once or twice a week!!
When Draco woke up, Harry was by his side. The curtains were drawn around the bed, giving them privacy while Draco recovered.
Harry wrapped Draco in a hug, burying his face in the smaller boy's neck. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry tentatively. He relaxed in the boy’s arms and buried his face in his hair.
This was it. She couldn't do this any more. This was just because of the stupid dreaming thing! She shouldn't have started in the first place. What she had seen in Malfoy's dream… what did that even mean? Malfoy… did he… have a crush on her? No, that was impossible!
I glance down uncertainly, tapping my fingers against the table. "I'll see if I can get Draco to come. He… doesn't really… want people to know…"
"No." She replied. It wasn't even a lie. She hadn't been to the dream corridor ever since that last time when she had yelled at Malfoy and created an inferno inside his dream.
Suddenly the words her mum had said to her, after turning her into a warrior queen came to her mind.
"Of course you can," she replied softly. She just wanted him to stop hurting. "Does your head hurt?" It looked like the wound on the side of his head wasn't too serious. The blood was already drying. She had read somewhere that head wounds always looked much worse than they really were.
treating him with kid gloves. That's why she wasn't able to figure out what Malfoy was hiding. She wasn't even
Haley could hear the chatter of people nearby. It seemed like they weren't too far away from the main road.
Haley raised her eyebrows in an unimpressed way. Sirius stared a her, sternly, crossing his arms to make his point.
Hearing a suspicious noise really should have worried Haley. And it did worry her but at the same time she felt relieved for the distraction it provided. She liked kissing Malfoy. As crazy as that sounded she could admit that. And she had already admitted it to herself. But… from the looks of it the boy had been about to tell her something… something that she wasn't ready to deal with yet. So she had been glad at the chance to escape his intense eyes for a moment. It was eerily quiet in the hall that opened toward the observation deck and the moonlight didn't provide much light. Where had the noise come from? She had almost reached the stairs when she spotted something shiny lying in front of one of the windows. Carefully she approached the thing and knelt down in front of it. It was a telescope. Nothing more, nothing less. She sighed in relief. Someone had probably forgotten it on the window sill during one of the Astronomy lessons and the wind had caused it to fall down. Right? That seemed logical enough. From the corner of her eyes she registered a sudden movement. What was-?
“Hello, students of new and old! We have one more announcement for today.” The headmaster said. “The eighth year students will not be in their old dorms as there is not enough space.” A collective murmur grew from the four tables.
I know Draco is taller than Harry but were gonna switch it for this because that's how I see them :)
“Listen, Potter, We don’t talk to each other, don’t look at each other. Okay? I don’t want to deal with this right now.” Draco said angrily.
“The year started so great, we became friends and I loved hanging out with you, but then we kissed, I kissed you, and it brought a lot of confusion and a lot to think about, you know. And I started distancing myself from you, which I know now was the completely wrong thing to do. I should've just talked to you, I’m sorry I didn’t.”
TW for this chapter include throwing up and self-harm, please stay safe while reading, and if you have to skip this chapter that's perfectly ok
Harry was startled by the new headmasters’ voice booming over the crowd. Harry hadn’t bothered to learn his name.
The crowd groaned and complained. Harry looked across the room to Draco. They locked eyes and joined the complaining.
He had no idea why he had started helping Harry. Just days ago he was arguing with him. The truth is, he had gotten used to living with Harry already. He was starting to like it.
Every Friday night, Draco would bring down snacks with him while they studied. Harry would grab blankets and they would sit together on one of the common room couches and study.
Draco, instead of smiling back like he wanted to, glared at Harry. He threw a bag of snacks at his head. Harry pulled out his wand quickly, stopping the bag mid-air. He brought it towards him with his wand and grabbed it, throwing it open.
A few days passed with no problems and the two boys started to forget why they were constantly mad. They had been fine with each other. Even liked it.
Then Ron was next to him, grabbing Draco’s limp arm and removing the blade from his hand. He grabbed a towel from next to the sink and wrapped Draco’s wrist.
But that was a lie. He knew exactly why he was like this; Draco Malfoy had fallen asleep on his shoulder.
Harry noticed how hard Draco worked to get good grades and how stressed he got when there was an assignment due soon.
I will try to get chapters out at least once a month, but with school and sports I don't have a lot of time to write, but I will try my best!
Ron had heard about Harry’s crush from Hermione a few months ago, though Harry always described their relationship as a friendship or a ‘thing’. Ron assumed Harry was scared that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated, but talking to Draco this past week had proved him wrong. And after listening to Harry’s repeated argument, he could tell that unrequited feelings were never a problem.
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding, he felt tears roll down his face as he closed his eyes. He wrapped his arms around Draco, burying his head in the boy's shoulder, not caring that people were watching.
Harry knew Draco Malfoy was an ‘enemy’ of his, but he found the boy's company relaxing. Maybe he likes hanging out with Malfoy.
Draco stayed silent for a moment, remembering what Harry had been arguing about just a few days prior.
They went the whole day avoiding each other. Harry stuck with Ron and Hermione, using them as shields while Draco sulked around the school with Pansy and Blaise.
“Harry,” He whispered, looking down at his hands. “All of that stuff you said to Hermione, was that true?”
Harry gave a small smile and picked up his books to move. Draco followed behind him and plopped down onto the couch.
Blaise snorted from where he was sitting, causing a pillow to fly into his face. Draco followed suit and threw a pillow at Pansy. The three continued this, leading to a full-on pillow fight.
When they left the parlor, the tattoo was wrapped in plastic. Draco looked pleased with the new design.
Harry’s face was twisted with guilt and shame. His mouth hung open in silage de. He had no explanation to give Draco.
Everything led back to him. He should have been there for Draco, Shouldn't have been pushing him away for his own selfish reasons.
Harry looked up from the notes he was copying and shook his head. “I don't know, ‘Moine. Just haven't been feeling up for it I guess.”
Harry continued writing with Draco leaning over his shoulder. Harry stopped writing and turned to face Draco, their faces just inches apart. Draco swallowed and glared into Harry’s bright green eyes. Harry gave Draco a small smile and pushed back. Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding.
"No!" I grab a pillow and throw it at the boy. Simon hits it with the sword he's practising with at the moment, sending it right back at me. It barely misses my face.
"It hasn't even been five minutes," Haley answered, "We could at least try to solve these questions without her." She stared down onto the blank parchment, quill in hand and willed the answers to pop up in her head. The first question was:
"Well because… because it's still raining," he argued. That ought to convince her. She was a girl after all. Surely she wouldn't want her hair to get wet.
Potter glared at him. "She's got a name, you know. And well – she knows I'm on a date but she doesn't know who I'm with." That made sense at least. If her friends only suspected their precious golden girl was so much as smiling at him or holding his hand he would have been faced with at least a dozen threats to his life by now.
A few announcements: So, I've decided to continue this in a seperate fic, meaning the next chapter will be the last (!) of the 5th year arch. But there will be a sequel (of this sequel xD). And I will tell you more about it in the next chapter.
"This doesn't make any sense without Hermione. What's taking her so long anyway?" Ron mumbled, as he frustratedly shoved his assignment for History of Magic away from him.
Sucking in a deep breath, I lean in and quickly touch my lips to his cheek. There, I've done it. Before Malfoy gets the chance to turn this into a real kiss I turn my head and look away.
"Don't worry I'll stand watch!" That's the last thing I hear before my door closes behind me. So much for exploring… Well, she won't be standing in front of my door the whole night, right?
"Too bad." Madame Pomfrey sighed. She pushed the spoon into his other hand, urging him to swallow. "Drink, drink."
Haley looked at her fingers that were clutching the handkerchief like it was her lifeline. Maybe Hermione was right. It was possible. But was she really ready to accept that as true? In any case, staying away from Draco hadn't helped bring Sirius back at all. It had only made her more miserable. And on top of that, she was starting to think that maybe she had somehow misinterpreted the dreams. Hadn't Sirius clearly told her to 'ask him'?
"We should quickly inform everyone that we're going to have the first meeting today," Hemione continued, "Or are you not okay with that? Is there something else you wanted to do tonight?" She asked Haley curiously. Actually… there was something else. The image of the note she had found inside
unlikely. And she never asks questions anyway." Despite her words Draco could tell that she was starting to doubt her idea.
"I see." A deep red rose petal sailed down from above, barely missing Draco's cup. It looked like a drop of blood.
"I know what this is about," Hermione finally offered. Her voice sounded as sharp as a knife and her eyes were tiny slits, fixed on Haley. "Are you playing with his feelings? As punishment for what he's done to you?"
"I wanted to," she whispered after a while. "I wanted to tell you so badly. But-" Her voice was suddenly small. Almost inaudible.
"Yes," Haley whispered, even though she didn't have the least bit of an appetite. If she had been in a better mood she might have given her scone to Simon but as it was, her mood was terrible. And on top of that, if her brother ate one more scone, he would surely burst! Haley ignored the pout on Simon's face and stuffed her face with the pastry.
Haley rolled her eyes. "I don't even know what's in there. You didn't give me a chance to look, remember?"
Someone was screaming. Two people. It took a while for Haley to figure out that she was one of them. The other… she couldn't be sure. Without her glasses she was barely able to discern Ron from his sister. But… she knew that voice. Or more like that whisper.
"Get off me, Potter!" He yelled angrily, trying to push her off him. But she didn't move an inch, sitting on his stomach and gripping his wrists tightly.
That night Haley wrote another letter. It didn't come easy to her, putting everything she felt into words. It was still painful. And incredibly draining. But in the end, she felt a tiny bit better. As if she had made the first step toward making things right. Reading the letter once more, Haley wondered what Draco might think if his eyes ever saw it. But then, she still wasn't sure if she even wanted him to see the words that she had practically carved from the depths of her soul.
As it neared the honey jar, Neville reached out his hand cautiously. He was holding a net between his fingers. He was just about to drop it over the glumbumble when Haley noticed the burns.
"Wow! Those are amazing!" He exclaimed, his eyes shining happily. Haley softened at that. Ron's honest excitement was kind of sweet. And didn't sweets always taste even better if you could share them with friends?
!" He insisted. "Why can't you just leave it alone and go? It's useless. My own father would disown me if he knew what a failure of a son he had. What good am I without magic? Who'd want someone like that? A pathetic disappointment. That's all I am. A broken, miserable-"
Haley bit her lips. "Well. He had some problems with his wand, I think. It would sometimes emit sparks or small bursts of fire. And there were instances in class where he would try a harmless charm and the object he was working on would go up in flames." Something else came to her mind. "And other times his spells seemed to go… overboard."
"Shit," Draco cursed. The owl had bit him again. This time it had picked his finger. "Blasted bird", he mumbled, shooing the brown owl away. It hopped closer again. What did it still want? A treat?
"Does this seem like a joke to you?" Malfoy yelled, effectively silencing her. "Look at me, for Merlin's sake!"
but Draco's attention was focused on the girl standing there with her back to him. He angrily stalked around her until he was standing right in front of her.
. Did he seriously want to know? It was strange. Being asked so suddenly… She couldn't think of an answer.
"You know what my mum always says? There's a potion for everything. And if there isn't… it simply hasn't been invented yet." She was trying to convince herself as much as him. But on the other hand, she did believe in those words. There was always a way. You only needed to look in the right place.
The girl got up, reaching for the book on the table and sending him a cheeky grin. "Just looking for a book," she offered, before turning to the other girl sitting at the table. "Hi Luna. See you tonight." And with that she left the corner just as quickly as she had entered it. It was as if she hadn't even been here in the first place. Slowly, Draco's eyes wandered from the spot where his girlfriend – his girlfriend! – had vanished to the blonde, sitting opposite him with a lifted eyebrow. He cleared his throat once more.
What the hell? "I-It's not a rumour," she answered carefully. "But – I mean. That's not an official statement so – don't tell anyone I said that."
The girl cleared her throat. "It's Creevey. Not creepy. Also, that's a pretty old joke." She sent Haley a glare. Hm. It looked as though she wasn't as much of a fan of Haley as her big brothers. She'd have to be more careful with her.
"I – um… uh – actually – I – uh..." What? Now she couldn't even form a proper sentence? Well, too bad, she hadn't been able to come up with a good excuse.
"So… Diggory bailed on you?" He asked, making sure his voice sounded mostly bored but also taunting. Potter didn't turn around but at least she stopped walking.
"That had to be because of the room." Hermione argued. "You've seen all the strange things happening in the Mystery Department."
"All right, all right. I'm coming," Haley said, shoving the drawer closed and finally getting out of bed. Duty was calling. She'd have to deal with the matters of the heart later. And maybe with bratty little girls.
"What, now you're siding with him?" She rose from her seat as well, glaring at the other girl angrily.
Not ten seconds later, they reappeared with another tray filled with sandwiches, and pieces of various delicious looking cakes. In no time at all, the table was covered in an array of chocolate cake, strawberry cake, cheese cake, pumpkin cake and several others. She hadn't even realized how hungry she had been.
That terrible beast of a Slytherin, Millicent Bulstrode crushed her against the wall, keeping her from doing anything useful at all. Umbridge was all over Haley. And their friends were shoved inside by all these other bulky Slytherins. She had to think of something. A plan.
my future?" Haley burst out irritably. "Do you know what McGonnagall and I talked about during our career advice session last month? Basically she listed jobs that seemed fitting in her opinion and I pretended to be interested!" She snorted. "Actually, they were all jobs that my parents would have liked but I…" She shook her head. "I'm fifteen, for Merlin's sake! How am I supposed to know now what I want to do for the rest of my life?"
"Two very important classes!" Hermione argued passionately. Right. History of Magic and Transfigurations were such important classes. Well, Transfigurations maybe.
But I really don't want to think about that now. Instead I try to focus my mind on the task of getting back to my own dream door. I'm halfway there when I realise that I'm not alone in the corridor. A figure is there. Standing right in the middle of the hall and blocking my way. It's a little girl, clad in a white dress, looking about 6 or 7. Her hair is as white as her dress and her big, owlish eyes are staring right at me. She watches me intently as I come closer and for a moment I wonder if I can get away with walking past her. The moment I pass her I hear the girl's voice for the first time.
Mum doesn't say anything for a moment. Then she mutters, "You have enough people telling you that. If you're not careful your ego might grow as big as your dad's."
Just when Haley was about to ask and quell her own curiosity, she noticed Draco clenching his hands to fists under the table. He was starting to get impatient. Seemed like she had to save her own questions for later.
"Never!" Haley growled, shoving away the man's hands that had started to search her robe pockets. "Neville, catch it!"
"I'm fine. There's no need to get into a fight because of me." She lifted her head from where it had been resting on her arms and looked at her two friends in a way that was meant to be assuring.
Would it be far away? Will we have to travel through endless halls until we would finally reach mum's door? But mum doesn't move an inch. It can't be far then.
Just when Haley was contemplating whether to send a 'harmless' spell after him, a groan from the bed shifted her attention elsewhere. Had the noise woken him up?
"That's rubbish!" Haley argued. "You didn't take anything away from him! Least of all me! I'm not a thing, damn it!"
With that he turned away from her and strode down the hall. Haley watched him vanish behind the next corner with her mouth gaping open. These last words Malfoy had said had made three things irrevocably clear.
It was making her sleepy. Who knew kissing could be that exhausting? She could barely keep her head upright.
I need to stop writing these freakishly long chapters. It takes forever to edit them! Anyway, I really like this chapter. It might be one of my favourites :) What did you think of it? Are you tired of Draco's antics yet? Do you want to be serenaded by him, too? And the most important question of all... what do you think Draco might be hiding besides his more or less obvious crush?
"Nothing," he whispered and then spontaneously decided to make one more chocolate as well. "Could you get me another pot,
"I didn't-" The boy started to say but Haley didn't let him finish. She pulled him forward by the front of his robes and stopped him from pressing the issue.
"I've seen it in a magazine," she lied swiftly, looking to the side. "A fan magazine of the Weird Sisters. Do you read those, too?" That was a trick she had learned from her dad. If somebody suspects you, always direct the attention toward the other person. Just like a handy counter spell.
Title is inspired from the iconic 'Oops... I did it again' by Britney Spears. Is that foreshadowing? Maybe...
"Fine! What do you want me to do? Follow your advice and join Dumbledore? And if not – if I can't leave my family behind – will that be it then? Will it mean this is over?" He hadn't meant to say all that. The words had just poured from his mouth, along with his pent-up anger and frustration. No matter how much her answer frightened him, he couldn't take it back.
"Oh yeah? Well, why didn't you also tell them that you're actually dating the son of a Death Eater?" He pushed himself off the wall and stalked over to her, his face stopping only inches away from hers. "Because you're ashamed of me? Because you were lying to me the whole time?" He sounded so bitter. It was unbearable.
Draco sunk against the tree in frustration. What would they be talking about now? Would Potter accept the Hufflepuff's invitation? He remembered something Lovegood had told him not too long ago.
"Don't be such a–" He breaks off, never finishing whatever he had wanted to call me. I freeze. Because there's a glob of cookie dough ice cream on my cheek.
"You're right," she agreed in a small voice, "I was just a little overwhelmed and… it won't happen again?"
"Yes," he whispered absently, reaching for a long strand of red hair and freeing it from one of the buttons on her jacket it had caught on.
But to his annoyance… he wasn't alone. Someone was sitting over at the edge of the observation deck, obviously having had the same idea as him. He was about to turn around and find a more deserted place, when he recognized dark hair and the small form of her back. Haley.
After getting everything he needed from his own supply, Draco began setting up his cauldron and all the ingredients on the girls' bathroom floor. It felt good to be doing something. Better than sitting around, waiting for something terrible to happen. There. Everything was ready. The last thing he needed was… his little golem puppet. He fetched it from his bag, reading through Luna's notes one last time.
"That reminds me," Haley remembered, the talk of the Great Lake had triggered her memory, "How did you get Dobby to help you out with the gillyweed? I mean, I know he used to 'work' for your family but… I didn't get the impression he was your biggest fan… so to speak."
Although his whole world had turned orange, Draco could see vague contours of his surroundings. It looked as though Weasley had made a run for it, Pansy following behind, firing hexes at him.
"You always have to have the last word, don't you?" She asked almost dazedly. She felt so weak all of a sudden.
Haley turned to where the voice had come from. Ron. He hadn't spotted Malfoy at first but now that he'd stepped further into the hall, he glared at him.
(comments and kudos are very much appreciated <3 bookmark/sub to work for updates and future chapters!)
Sorry about the late update, my friends moved and we were helping plus school so i didn’t have much time to write :/
Hogwarts had given the seventh years another chance for their NEWTS, but they had to take the year over again. He was sitting with Ron and Hermione, but no one was talking. They all knew that the school year would be stressful and sad. Walking off the train onto the Hogwarts ground was a painful thing to do.
Hello and welcome back! Thank you all so much for the support and being patient while I work on updates!!
Draco turned his wrist over and stared at the mark, now with scars cutting off the snake's head. He still hated it and wanted it gone.
Hermione blinked once, recovered from the shock, and strode over to the couch. She placed a hand on Harry's shoulder and shook him awake.
“I know, this is not practical, but we have two rather large rooms for the eighth year students to stay in. We have made common rooms and bedrooms in these empty towers for the groups.”
I'll try to keep updates on a 2-week basis, but summer is very busy for me with all of the trips planned!
People stared as they walked past, the dried blood on Harry’s shirt sending confusion into the crowds. Whispers followed them like snakes.
the next chapter should come out within two weeks or sooner. I don't really have a schedule still, summer is just as hectic and crazy as school is
2020 has sucked... I miss all of my friends and its been a rough year for me in general. Hopfully 2021 is a little better.
Also please leave comments/kudos if you are liking this, they give me motivation to write and get the chapters out sooner :D
Harry looked up at Draco as the other boy stilled his hand movement. They both had tears running down their cheeks silently.
Harry pulled himself off of Draco, his shirt was wet with blood. He scooped Draco into his arms, carefully protecting the arm he had cut. Draco’s head lulled into Harry’s shoulder and stayed there. He stood slowly and looked at Ron.
“I think it's because people don’t expect me to.” Harry sighed. “People think just because I’m the freaking ‘boy who lived’ I don’t have to study. It's absurd!”
“Draco, Dray, please. Look at me, I’m right here.” he wrapped his hands gently around Dracos neck, pulling his face closer to his. He leaned his forehead down against Dracos. “I’m sorry, Draco, please. Please, Dray, open your eyes.”
"This is an infirmary!" Madame Pomfrey interrupted him, appearing suddenly behind Neville. "My patients need a peaceful environment. If you want to yell at each other do it outside!"
"Well..." The man dropped a sugar cube into his own cup. "Unfortunately… I did not call for you merely because I wanted to have a cup of tea with you."
Haley bit her lips nervously. "I…" She started to say. "It's not what it looks like?" Her statement came out like a question. Which was fitting, seeing as she didn't even know what it
"I–" Haley looked back and forth between Hermione and Luna. Maybe this was exactly the excuse she needed.
With a final scream, he stops and sinks against it. There is the face of a familiar boy pinned to the red fabric. Baz, Simon's raven-haired quidditch rival.
"Probably because of Malfoy," Fred commented. Haley almost choked on her pumpkin juice. Had George told him? Was he insane? "We've seen him earlier. Limping his way to Madame Pomfrey. Wish we knew what happened to
He turned left and right. Back and forth. Pointing his wand at books, pictures, chairs, sheets, brushes, paintbrushes, clothes… everything he could find. He enlarged them, made them float, shrunk them, lit up a candle, summoned a cauldron from who knew where… until the whole room looked as if Simon had let his kittens loose inside of it. He seemed like he was in a frenzy.
Mum's dream door looks the same it looked the first time I stood in front of it. Painted green wood. A round window with white lilies surrounding it. And to the left, a bronze cauldron. How does her door open again? Right. I need to get the key from inside of the cauldron. As soon as my hand nears the cauldron, bright flames shoot up from it. I pull my hand back reflexively.
Haley nodded. "It's always the same dream." She explained. "It started the night Sirius – the night we went to the Ministry Department."
He glanced over at her hand, that was clenched to a tight fist on top of the blanket. He lifted his own hand as if he wanted to reach out and touch her but in the end he let it sink to the grass.
. "If you like her so much, why are you–" I shake my head, trying to make sense of what I actually want to say. "Why do you treat her like this?"
We stop in front of a… well it's not really a door. It's more like a hole in the wall that resembles the night sky. Kind of similar to the ceiling in the Great Hall but much smaller. Is that the girl's 'dream door'?
She coughed awkwardly. "You may be right about that." The glimpses she'd gotten of his nightmares so far were enough to last her a life time.
"Well, it's not simply watching the dream. If you do it correctly you can actually take part in it."
With that she spins around and marches back to her own dream door. She barely steps through the door when my legs start to walk in the opposite direction almost on their own accord. Before I even have the chance to properly make up my mind on whether I should spy on Malfoy again or not, I have already arrived in front of his dream door.
"Oh come on, Haley. Do you expect me to believe you've been wandering around Hogsmeade all day looking for some shop that Loony Lovegood obviously made up?"
Mum gives me a look, that tells me she knows exactly what I'm thinking about. She squints her eyes at me.
She should have known the Slytherin wasn't going to leave it at that. With an ugly scowl he hurled the journal into the puddle next to her, splashing a new wave of mud in her face. The girl screamed in frustration, hitting the puddle to create her own wave. But to her disappointment it never hit the git.
"There's nothing that you want?" He asked incredulously, like she had just told him she hated Quidditch or something equally upsetting. He pulled up his leg, which had been dangling from the edge, and turned his body halfway toward her.
Hermione shook her head firmly. "I've already arranged everything. Can't you try to make some time around noon? It's really important! And it won't take that long. We should be done by the afternoon." The urgent tone of her voice convinced her. She knew her friend wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
Haley rolled her eyes. "I knew it wasn't a dream." She squinted her eyes. "I usually see better when I dream."
"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll all fit in there," she said with a chuckle, "Some people call it the Room of Requirement or the Come and Go Room."
"No." He argued weakly, shaking his head. "You're just saying that. You're messing with me." He looked so vulnerable and scared. Like a little boy almost. Fresh tears glistening in the corners of his eyes, eyebrows pulled together in sorrow, bottom lip quivering dangerously.
I land on top of something soft and fluffy. Hedwig. She saved me. And as if it could not get any more surreal than this I suddenly hear a very familiar melody that seems to come from everywhere around us.
Along with the annoying ghost who apparently haunted this bathroom. After asking him who he was and what he was doing in her bathroom he had simply ignored her. He wasn't in the mood to chit chat with anyone. The least someone who so uncomfortably reminded him of Pansy.
Luckily the armchair was wide enough to fit two people comfortably, so when Haley sat down next to Ginny she didn't have to actually sit on her lap. From up close it was even more evident how guilty she felt.
"I cannot say yet. I have never encountered something like it before. He is not responding to any spells I have tried. It will need some more time." Severus explained.
. Was he dreaming? Would he wake up only to find that none of the events of today had ever taken place?
"Mum says you should come down for tea," her little brother, Simon said. His hair had almost the same shade of auburn as hers did. But while Haley's long locks had a more reddish copper tint (like their mum's) Simon's hair always reminded her of bronze.
Two days before the end of term Draco was called to Professor Snape's office. While knocking on the door, he wondered what the man could possibly want from him. Perhaps it had something to do with his parents?
, I tell myself. I can't get hurt in a dream. Not really. I take a deep breath and begin climbing the ladder. It actually holds my weight! As I continue climbing, Malfoy gets on the ladder after me. Heh. He's beneath me. There's this urge filling me. Wouldn't it be fun, if I kicked him off the ladder? Even the mental image is enough to make me snort.
"I…" She started, trying to recollect something interesting from his dreams. "I know… your favourite drink."
Soothingly, Haley stroked Hermione's hair. She had never seen the girl break down like this. It made her feel terrible, the girl's sobs echoing in her ears. She wanted to blame someone. But there was no one to blame.
She finally tore her eyes away from the disturbing sight and fled. But she couldn't stop the desperate cries of the pitiful creature from haunting her even once she was long gone.
"Exactly!" Haley exclaimed, the confirmation making her feel more at ease than before. She slapped her hands onto the table irritably. "That's what I told him, too but he just – ugh…"
A surprised gasp slips out of my mouth. It's not loud. And he definitely shouldn't have heard it. But somehow he did as it seems. (Maybe because this is a dream?) The boy turns his head, looking for the source of the noise.
"I – I'm sorry – I didn't m-mean to–" Malfoy stammered, before stopping when his gaze fell onto Haley's injured hand. At once his eyes hardened.
She had always had a crush on the boy with the sandy blond hair and the round face. There was always a kind smile on his face and he had a really strong sense of justice. Haley found that extremely attractive. His eyes were an intense shade of blue. Sky blue. When the sun shone brightly. He
"A Gryffindor and a Slytherin?" Draco could barely stop himself from gaping. This was unheard of. Whose story was that? Was Snape making it all up for his sake?
"You sure about that?" Fred asked, snatching the thing from her hands in a quick move. "I bet you got it from one of your admirers." He teased with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
"We should really use that prank book you got from your dad, don't you think? Just to scare him a bit. I mean, we won't tell Hermione, of course. Let's do that, eh?"
Right. She had put on a pair of jeans. And a hint of mascara that she'd sneaked from Parvati. But surely Ron of all people hadn't noticed that?
That's when the boy in question and his Slytherin friends burst into roaring laughter. And they weren't the only ones. Some of the members of her own house were also joining in the laughter. Even Neville was fighting off a grin. Haley felt her face flame up in embarrassment. Could this get any worse?
"I know some people think that you can see the future, if you put on a knight's helmet on a full moon night. But I think that's only a myth. I tried it myself, you know."
He wasn't sure what happened first. If he opened his arms or if Haley settled against him. But that wasn't really relevant. What was more important was that they were finally where they belonged. In a world that was just their own.
" he added nonchalantly, his self-satisfied grin made her think of a striped cat she had once seen in a muggle book. Wait. What had he said just now?
She threw herself on her bed with a groan. Why was she the bad one all of a sudden? Everything she had been doing was trying to get Malfoy to stop picking on her. All she had wanted was to find out something scandalous about the boy so she could finally get some peace in return for keeping his secret. And now? Now she had snogged him – twice! – and had gotten into a fight with her best friend. Her throat was starting to feel tight. No, she wasn't going to cry!
The girl's face was shining with wonder and eagerness, capturing his full attention and making a strange feeling spread through his insides. Then he tripped over a rock.
When she was done, she folded up the letter and hid it at the bottom of her trunk. Not only hiding the words but also the tear stains, covering the lower half of it.
This time it was him who spotted the snitch first. He wasn't going to let her show him up a second time. Without hesitating another second Draco sped toward the goal post in the middle where he had seen the golden ball. He grinned to himself. Potter was nowhere in sight. She probably hadn't even noticed him speeding away. Victory was his now. He removed his left hand from his broomstick and reached for the fluttering ball. It was only metres away now. Then something flashed into his vision from the left and snatched the snitch away before he could blink twice. Potter again. Where had she even come from? Ah, he saw it now. She had emerged from behind the bleachers, giving him the illusion that he was winning. He wanted to stomp his foot to the ground But sadly that wasn't possible atop his broom.
"That's not – we didn't – I just –" Haley tried to explain, waving her hands back and forth frantically.
"Oh. You mean… at a concert. Or… when someone serenades you." And suddenly she was reminded of the dream where she'd been serenaded by
"Right. I hope it will work out for you. You deserve some happiness," she gave her hand a squeeze, "And don't forget to tell me once you've figured it all out."
Draco huffed impatiently. "Well, I gotta go. So, if that's all." He whirled around. Where was the best place to activate the golem?
"Would Slytherin have been so bad?" He asks, a wistful note in his voice. Perhaps he's picturing what school would have been like if we had been in the same house.
kind of loony but she was also sort of his ally. She knew his biggest secret. So he'd make an exception. For now.
The boy froze at the spot. A number of emotions flitted across his face. Disbelief, surprise and was that…
"Must have fallen off her fringe," she rushed out almost hysterically. "Happens to me all the time!"
"Neville! Your grandma already went ahead to the platform. We should hurry or you won't have enough time to say bye," said Mrs Longbottom, who had just arrived next to them together with Neville's dad, "Hello Haley, dear, did you have good holidays? And is that you, Simon? The last time I saw you you were barely as tall as our dining table."
It was unusually hard to form coherent sentences. That's probably why Draco informed Potter that her hair was wet. Well, it was an important piece of information, wasn't it? Usually, hair wasn't supposed to be wet. So it was only nice of Draco to tell the ignorant girl about it. On top of that it was incredibly irritating!
"So? We fit right in, don't you think?" He smirked at her, taking a step closer and wrapping his arms around her waist. He dropped a kiss onto one of her cheeks, letting his lips linger there for a moment. "By the way…" he whispered close to her ear. "Is there a reason for your… new look?"
He watches the broomstick sceptically and shakes his head. "You know I can't fly any more." The pain reflected in his grey eyes makes my heart ache for him. I want to hug him and make him forget all his pain. But somehow, I don't think this will help him.
Hermione shook her head, pulling a huge book out of her bag. "I need to check my Runes notes. There is this one word I keep getting wrong.
It started in her fingertips and spread over her fingers, her hands, her arms into her chest and filled her whole body from there. A tingling feeling as if her body had fallen asleep. As if a hundred million stars were exploding inside her. She was a galaxy. A galaxy of joy.
"Um, Haley, would you come with me for a moment. I found something in the drawing room I wanted to show you."
Her friend took her in for a quiet moment. "You know, this all seems like some weird dream," she whispered. "Malfoy having a crush on you. It doesn't make any sense, does it?"
"We can just forget about all of this," I tell him, gesturing vaguely toward the class room, "But first you have to fulfil this small task."
"The hair gel was getting tiresome, you know. Don't think I changed my style because of you or anything." He said in a rather bored tone.
"What?" Hermione replied too loudly, still frowning. Her eyes had wandered to Ron now, who didn't seem to notice the dangerous atmosphere surrounding him.
"I… I wanted to… I wanted to say goodbye." She whispered. He wasn't going to like what she was going to say next. But hadn't Hermione said she had to be honest if she wanted this to have a real chance? She'd said he would understand… if he really cared about her. This was the test, then. "So, I visited you… one last time."
With his left hand he reached for her right one and gently wrapped the handkerchief around her injury. Even after he was done he didn't let go of her hand. It felt so much better now.
"Oh." He seemed to consider that. "Well, I wouldn't even know how to do it anyway." He said, almost disappointed.
"Merlin, you're gonna be the death of me," he mumbled and then she felt something soft beneath her head. Merlin? Was Merlin here with them? When had he arrived? Why was he going to be the death of someone?
I hear the impatient clicking of Hedwig's claws again. She's not going to throw me off, if I don't tell her the rest, is she?
"Besides, I told you. I don't need practice. I'm a natural." He winked at her. Then he frowned. "You never said what brought you up here in the middle of the night."
, isn't it?" George babbled, holding the white cloth in front of him now. Sirius peaked at it over George's shoulder.
Simon's eyes went innocently wide. For a second, he even looked sympathetic. "Okay," he answered, slightly pouting. "But you owe me."
. When he thought he was only dreaming of me, I was actually there inside his dream." Haley bit her lips. Damn, she hadn't meant to say that.
Luna shrugged. "She just lost someone very dear to her. Of course, she needs time to come to terms with that."
The first-years Draco liked to hex hadn't done anything either. Not really… Or the muggles that his father had taunted last year during the quidditch world cup. But they had been muggles… So… of course it hadn't mattered to him. It still didn't matter much.
As the girl took her chopsticks and started twirling the noodles around in their sauce, she felt his eyes on her. "What?" She snapped. "You're not going to eat anything?"
As Haley followed him up the staircase she felt the sudden urge to push him over the railing. She suppressed it. Azkaban wasn't a place she wanted to see from inside.
"I – well, I might talk to Arthur about it. But you know I'd rather not have you all wander about in these uncertain times."
"I was losing myself, wallowing in my misery" he admitted. "I would have lost myself if it wasn't for you." His fingers drew invisible patterns onto the small of her back. It was oddly soothing. "You who kept bothering and irritating me."
"Do you remember, when I told you about that mean boy from our rival team who always kicked me off my broomstick for fun?"
He sighed. "I'm s-" He bit his lips. "It was a mis– an accident." He still couldn't do it. Apologize properly. Somehow, she found that endearing.
"If you say so." Her friend gave a shrug. But the thoughtful look on her face was definitely alarmed.
. But then, she should really know better than this. Taking her dreams too seriously was what had lead to the tragic events in the Department of Mysteries in the first place. And more than that… she had seen him. Seen Bellatrix Lestrange fire the curse. She had seen him fall and finally… disperse into nothing. Sirius would never come back.
"Um… how do you know – I mean… since when are you friends with Luna Lovegood?" Haley felt kind of stupid for asking that. It seemed like something she shouldn't have to ask. Something she should already know.
"I was serious, Ron. I'm dating him. Draco." It went from her lips so easily. She remembered not being able to even think the word
"What? Where? No, stop it! Are you crazy?" Draco looked up in time to see the Ravenclaw's hand sink to the table. There was a slightly disappointed frown on her face.
Well, then. I asked. If he doesn't want to tell me, it's not my problem. I sigh. "Hey Simon?" I ask after a while.
"Fine." She giggled, ducking out of her reach. "But I think it's about time, I told Ron that you were the one who hexed Parvati because he asked her to the Yule Ball instead of you."
"All right, all right," Simon said from his room. "Bishop to F9." He was sitting in front of his own chess set. They were playing chess across two rooms with two sets of chess. It was absurd. But at least it kept her from worrying herself to madness. And like this she could keep an eye on Baz. Somebody (read: Simon) had to watch over Neville. And since Haley didn't want to leave Draco's side and didn't trust that little devil in a room with her baby brother, they had found themselves in this impossible chess arrangement.
"Come on, then. We can take a walk through the village at least." He placed a few sickles on the table and fetched a familiar mirror from his shoulder bag.
Haley huffed. "Isn't it obvious? To eat? To see you? You're the one who keeps skipping classes. Not my fault, I barely remember what you look like."
"I promise," Haley reassured her. "Gryffindor's honour." She reached out her hand and with positively shining eyes the little girl took a hesitant step toward her.
The boy accepts my answer and we continue climbing up the ladder while the midday sun burns down on us. Honestly, this ladder is endless. I could swear that the distance between us and the tree house is still the same as when we started.
that I found at Healing Herbs' (That's a lovely little shop near our town!). The shop attendant said if you make tea with it or rub it onto the skin it will heal any injuries located on the arm. It's inside the little pouch attached to the card.""
"We have to go," he repeated more urgently this time. "There's no time." He didn't know how much longer Snape and Pomfrey would be occupied with the draught of living poison he had knocked over in the Infirmary. Accidentally, of course.
Draco shouldn't have mentioned the Hufflepuff. A frown was forming on Potter's face. It was funny how much she resembled her usual self in that moment. Watching him suspiciously. Her glasses slightly askew due to her scrunched up nose. And her hair was short again and back to its raven colour. The top half of it was tied with a green hair tie and part of her fringe was hiding the lightning-shaped scar. Draco couldn't help but grin as he waited for her response.
, she wondered suddenly, her eyes misting up. She had never told him how pretty she thought they were. "Please open your eyes." Her voice shook. "Malfoy…Can you hear me…? Can you–?" She gripped his shoulders finally, shaking him to force some kind of reaction out of him. "
"I'll meet up with you in Hogsmeade." It was insane. Haley knew that. But with the way Malfoy's whole face seemed to light up at her words she couldn't find it in herself to worry too much.
"No – I just – just do me this favour and then I'll do you a favour in return." Is he pouting? Damn, his eagerness reminds me so much of my brother Simon that I sigh again, crossing my arms in front of my chest and close my eyes. It does sound good, him doing me a favour.
Evans had been her name. The name of the witch from the memory. The one he'd desperately tried to impress. The one who looked so much like Haley… Her mother. There was no doubt about it. She didn't even spare the boy a single glance. It was obviously a one-sided attraction.
"You wouldn't dare," he whispered, thinking aloud. He felt betrayed somehow. He barely stopped himself from saying,
?" It shouldn't be this surprising. And it isn't. Not really. But actually hearing Malfoy say it like this seems so… earth-shattering.
He scowls again. "I don't look like this!" He complains, using his paintbrush like it's a catapult and splattering me with paint in various colours.
No. She hadn't. It was reassuring in a way. That she wanted to fight for him. Didn't it mean that she cared? If only a bit? It would have been crushingly disappointing if she had given up on him that quickly.
"Definitely," he replied lightly, taking a step toward her. It was evident, he had put some effort into his appearance as well. His hair was void of the usual gel and framed his face in a way that said 'carefully styled to look natural'. He looked fairly decent in his dark grey robes that accentuated the colour of his eyes. She had to give him that.
"Haley! Are you coming or should we go ahead?" Ron called from the entrance of the library. She hadn't even noticed that her friends had already started to leave. Well, it was impressive how fast Ron could be when there was the promise of food.
On top of that he was so angry about the fate that awaited his father. What was his mother going to do now? But then… when he thought of Haley again… it probably was so much harder for her. Her godfather… was dead. She'd never see him again. She was probably hurting. Needed someone to comfort her. But was he the right person for that? He didn't know. And there was no one who was going to tell him.
She felt him shake his head. "Unlike you, I've got a reason to skip. If you want to we can meet up for lunch later."
I nod. It's a good thing, he doesn't see my face. Lying is much easier that way. The boy's fingers still in my hair.
Although it was impossibly embarrassing to admit these feelings out loud, she nodded. "The worst is… even now… I want to be selfish and keep you with me, even if it endangers you or me or everyone close to us. Even though I've wronged you. Even if it means I'll never see Sirius again."
Haley was just about to follow him, when she was reminded of the boy that still had his arm around her shoulders.
Seeing Professor Snape in her kitchen for breakfast was slightly surprising. "Did he spend the night?" Haley asked Simon in a whisper that only he could hear, when she sat down next to him.
The setting evening sun was giving him a strange glow – his white blond hair seemed gold – and bathing the room in a warm red light. His face didn't betray any emotion except for the slight crease between his brows. And he was worrying his lower lip, turning it an angry red. A sudden image flashed before her eyes. A memory. A memory of herself leaning into the boy and biting his lip just like he was doing at the moment. She stepped forward reflexively. His eyes widened only a fraction.
else, she would gladly do that. But like this? She still wasn't completely convinced this wasn't all an elaborate joke.
"But you did! You think I'm stupid for trusting him. That I'm too naive to see that he's using me for some nefarious Death Eater plot, am I wrong?"
Haley's hand fell to her side, while Malfoy quickly got to his feet. He didn't look at her. She watched his movements carefully, ready to stop him at the first sign of him making a run for it.
Draco was sure he was slowly going insane. How else could it be explained that he was telling his deepest secrets to a stranger? Maybe it was the fact, that considering the girl's reputation it was unlikely anyone would believe her, should she ever tell someone about this. But perhaps it was also because he had carried this secret with him for such a long time that it felt liberating to finally be able to talk to someone about it. Even if it was Loony Lovegood. Said girl seemed to think about her answer for a moment.
A thought was inkling at the back of Draco's mind. No, it was a distant memory actually. It had been during a visit to Hogsmeade… where suddenly out of nowhere something – or someone had thrown mud at him, Crabbe and Goyle. He had thought it was a ghost at first but then… there had been Potter's head floating in mid-air.
It was a Hufflepuff from their year. That muggleborn that had been petrified in their second year. They were talking but he couldn't hear the words clearly. Potter was laughing about something.
"It's all right, Draco," Snape drawled dismissively. "Potter is here for a little remedial Potions. What is it?"
Draco needed a moment to take all of that in. If this was true… Haley had to be devastated. If that was true…
Still grinning, she shook her head. The boy took another sip of his sugar tea and watched her warily.
"You see, to me it sounds like there is absolutely no reason for you not to come to Hogsmeade with me."
With visible reluctance Draco reached for Neville's wrist and held onto it as if he wanted to take an Unbreakable Vow. Neville did the same. He looked slightly nervous and kept looking either at Haley or her mum, who were both standing around the couch next to Simon and Snape.
"This is useless," he said with a sigh. "Why are we even looking for – wait didn't he say they like to hide inside tree trunks?" There was a tall tree opposite them at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It looked like it had been struck by a bolt of lightning. "I'm sure one of them is hiding inside it!" He pointed at the tree eagerly.
"Mum!" She lunged forward and attacked her mother with a hug. It was so much better to see her in person after all the dream visits and all of her emotional outbursts.
With a sigh, he turned the letter around. But there were no more words. No secret messages. Well, at least it seemed as if Luna was having nice holidays. For a second he imagined coming along to Sweden with her and her dad. The image in his mind made him snort. It would be nice if he could just run away from everything like that.
"Dating?" He asked, feeling foolish but he needed to make sure. He was actually surprised she hadn't told them already. Didn't those Gryffindors share everything with one another?
The first thing he noticed was the darkness. It wasn't black exactly but it was considerably darker than it had been seconds before. And It wasn't raining either. Something to his left fell into the grass with a soft
"Don't worry. It's not too dangerous. It will probably pass if you lie down for a bit. Maybe you should go back and rest?"
"Maybe he did." Lily chimed in. She had been silent the whole time. Contemplating. "Maybe there simply was no way."
"It's like the Yule Ball..." Malfoy mutters as he walks a few steps backwards, pulling me with him. "I still remember you... slow-dancing to that song," he reminisces. "With another boy." He seems annoyed at his own words and a little… jealous?
She didn't remember getting up but suddenly she was standing. "Well, I'm sorry I couldn't live up to your
Could that be true? He'd never heard of something like this being important for brewing potions. But then, with potions, the taste wasn't really the most important factor. He tried to think of something nice, just in case. Like how happy Haley was going to be because of his chocolate. He smiled.
For those of you who love Luna as much as I do I'd like to recommend my all time favourite Luna/Harry fic. It's called "Soulmates" by Lily Ophelia and it's so, so beautiful! I love how Luna's character is treated in that story. Go read it! https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6790534/1/Soulmates
Mrs Weasley frowned. "A bit difficult for the beginning..." She tilted her head left and right thoughtfully. "But I guess it could work. Have a seat, dear." A kind smile formed on the woman's face as she patted the seat next to her. At once Haley was handed a pair of needles and a ball of bright red wool.
"I was livid," he continued. "I'd planned it all and finally convinced myself it wasn't the most foolish idea of all times… and then you go and ask Neville
inevitably. Why had he been so nice? Why had he made sure, she got away from Snape without getting scolded or worse? Why had he done that? Why had he – he… kissed her? Did he… was there a chance that he…
She almost expected him to take her hand this time as well but surprisingly he didn’t. He only lifted a brow at her and walked past the Great Hall. He was leaving it up to her.
Haley sighed. She searched out Neville, who would surely offer her an understanding smile. But the boy wasn't looking at her at all. His gaze was fixed on something behind them. He was worrying at his lip like he was deep in thought.
The days following that disastrous Christmas morning, Sirius had been suspiciously absent. Haley suspected he was spending all of his time in that little room where Buckbeak was staying but she was too scared to check. Once, Hermione had carefully asked Haley about her godfather but the girl had only shaken her head sadly, not being able to reply. She hadn't been asked about him since.
Severus sighed, rubbing his nose again. He could really do without a headache. He did not have a potion for that with him.
"Keeping you from doing anything stupid." If this had been anyone but Severus Snape, he might have winked at Draco. "Honestly, I would expect this kind of behaviour from a Gryffindor." He sneered. And then he rushed out of the door.
"It's not my fault you can't even exit a train like a proper human being," drawled Draco Malfoy, as he nimbly hopped off the train.
"Fine," she agreed reluctantly, "But you'll go straight to Madame Pompfrey if it gets worse, all right?"
"Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other. Sirius was in Azkaban half her life." Ron added. "And before that their families never met–"
"Who says I forgave you?" She heard him ask into her hair. It made her stiffen slightly but really… after everything she put him through, why would he forgive her just like that?
With a wave of her wand, and a whispered spell, Hermione made the needles and the thing she was knitting sink to the table. It was weirdly quiet without the clicking of the needles.
"I just – I'm just… tired. It's all been a little much lately." It helped that she had to yawn for real in that second. She really was tired after all.
"Well, then," she said, pulling out the chair in front of her and sinking into the seat. Then she proceeded to ignore him, busying herself with whatever she had come here for.
"I hate him, I hate him, I hate him so much!" Simon replies, punching the punching bag one last time, before tearing off his boxing gloves and throwing himself on the bed. So, basically on top of me. "Get off, you klutz."
He was kissing her fingers, she realised. With each little kiss that followed, Haley felt something fluttery inside her stomach. Were those butterflies? Whatever it was it felt scary. And overwhelming. And she didn't want it to stop. So of course it stopped in exactly that moment.
"Let's go back this way. We also need some Dirigible plums for the flavour," Luna said, leading them to the other side of the greenhouse, where there were even more trees.
Something felt wrong when she woke up. Or not wrong but… different somehow. Unusual. The light was different. Softer and… her night stand was on the wrong side. Haley frowned, reaching for her glasses. At least they were on top of her drawer. She drew the curtains aside and climbed out of the bed. That's when she finally understood. She hadn't been sleeping in her bed after all. She had slept in Hermione's bed. How had that happened? And where was Hermione? Why hadn't she kicked her out of her bed?
He breaks the kiss and lies down next to her. Then he buries his face in my doppelgänger's shoulder and wraps his arms around her middle. And when she hugs him back he has this
Luna nodded toward the hallway on the left. She nodded. The Ravenclaw walked ahead and Haley began following her.
He took the biscuit and held it in front of his nose, pretending to smell it sceptically. Then he bit off a small piece and chewed it, letting the sweetness fill his taste buds. Was this cinnamon he tasted? He loved cinnamon!
sick!" Haley said triumphantly, never minding that the two Slytherins now knew she had been eavesdropping on them.
Hermione looked up at the midnight blue canopy. "I think… that you've been feeling frustrated and helpless for a really long time and..." She sighed. "Sometimes something like this can drive people to do things they would never do under normal circumstances."
, Malfoy," Potter almost growled at him. Well at least she wasn't on the verge of tears anymore. If Draco couldn't say something nice he might as well distract her from being sad. Without giving his words much thought he simply talked, trusting his mind to do what he was best at: Get a rise out of Potter.
The movement caused a fluttery thing to shoot up behind Haley. She turned around but the golden thing already whizzed past, about to escape into the maze of the dungeons.
Huh? What was that? If Haley had been more focused on the words he was saying – which she absolutely wasn't – she wouldn't have noticed the almost warm tint in the boy's voice when he had talked about her
Not a second later another owl arrived, carrying a book-sized package in its claws. The unfamiliar owl dropped the package into Haley's lap, took a sip of water from Beryll's bowl and flew away again. A post owl probably.
"I wish I could promise not to do that again but… I doubt you'd believe me." Malfoy glanced over at her hand almost longingly. Then he looked right into her eyes.
"Are you sure, you don't want to go to the hospital wing?" Ron asked for the fourth time as they made their way down to the Great Hall for lunch.
"So…" Neville seemed to have similar problems. He was chewing on his lips like he always did when he was nervous. It made Haley chuckle softly. Some things never changed. Suddenly, she was longing for their easy friendship. The way it had been before she'd started crushing on him. Why did feelings always make everything that much more complicated?
That made him chuckle. If only a bit. "You're insane." Then he pulled back slightly, pushing one of Haley's lose strands behind her ear. "You'd do that?"
Mum looks so eager as if she's about to burst at any moment. "I thought you'd be happy?" She asks, her smile wavering slightly. "I was really looking forward to meeting that Malfoy kid, too…" She looks honestly disappointed.
"Really? I think you're the one who doesn't want to play. Because you're afraid you'll lose." She couldn't back down now. She was close to breaking through his walls. She felt it.
." His voice was full of disbelief, as if the whole situation still baffled him. "I couldn't let him get through with it. Who was he, thinking, he could take something I wanted so badly. I needed to teach him that this wasn't how you treated a Malfoy."
"Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn't she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn't have killed Sirius."
"Obviously you are!" The potion master hissed with a dark glare. He was walking back and forth in front of his desk. Draco had never seen him this agitated before. "Playing around like some… foolish child. Carelessly thinking that your parents are going to fix it–"
"I guess," she began, "you're not as subtle as you think you are," Draco's heart sank, "But it's not like it's blatantly obvious."
"No tricks this time," I mutter as I close my eyes once more. It takes a bit longer before she tells me to open my eyes again. When she finally does I'm in for a surprise.
That made him chuckle. "What would be the point? You already know everything." He slung an arm around her waist. "Besides, I can hardly hide from someone who follows me into my dreams."
Haley flopped back down on the bed with a groan. Then she carefully glanced at the boy next to her. He blindly reached for the plush dragon and pressed his face against it with a sigh.
wanted to take revenge. His own father had stood there and laughed while his girlfriend had been tortured. For all he knew. The mere knowledge was practically unbearable. Could it really be true? Well, at leat he hadn't been the one doing the torturing.
"I think, I'll pass," she murmured after a pause. Then one corner of her mouth started to twitch upwards in amusement.
Haley bit her lips. "So?" She was probably too eager. There was no way he was going to tell her… But then… he didn't seem all that angry any more. More than anything he seemed dejected and sad.
I remove his arms from my stomach and scoot to the other side of the bed. "A fishtail braid, really? I'm so amazing, I can make a fishtail braid." I honestly don't know, where I've got the sarcasm from. Dad is much too vain for sarcasm and Sirius too confident. Mum offers sarcastic comments every now and then but that happens so rarely, that I don't think I've picked it up from her. Maybe it's just something that belongs to me?
"Extra points?" She pointed her chopsticks at him in amused disbelief. "Are you trying to win the house cup?"
Haley giggled, shaking her head and grabbed his arm to stop him before he accidentally woke them up.
"Oh." Hermione said softly, looking as if it all made sense suddenly. "You're not talking about Malfoy, are you?" She whispered into Haley's ear so nobody else could hear her.
"You-" He exclaimed, reaching for her hand. "Give that back!" But the girl was already jumping backwards. She held the small festively wrapped up box up in the air and shot a triumphant grin at him.
"Is it the butterbeer, still?" Ron asked. He was trying to take a look at Hermione's scroll, while she was distracted. If Haley didn't feel like she was being interrogated she would have grinned. But wait. Butterbeer? Butterbeer... Of course, the butterbeer! It seemed so long ago that Luna Lovegood had told them that story about old pixy dust in butterbeer but it had actually only been several hours.
His wand aimed straight at her heart. He opened his mouth to speak but Haley couldn't hear a word he said. All she saw was cold, merciless eyes and a cruel smirk. And then… a flash of green light. That's when she found her voice again.
"Mum!" I exclaim happily. I'm always happy to see her. But even more so, when there is a horde of hippogriffs occupying my dorm room.
"Ron was right, you're really trying to turn me into a Slytherin!" The girl said with wide scandalised eyes.
"Do you like it?" The boy in front of her drawled lazily. It was definitely Malfoy. Nobody else she knew drawled like that. Haley snorted.
"So, anyway." He continued, before the girl could inspect the invention further or get ideas like confiscating it. "Should I make a guess why my dear little brother has stopped talking to you and is now hanging around with his amazing twin brothers all the time?" He raised a mocking eyebrow.
–!" He breaks off before he can finish, looking at his hands in bewilderment. They're empty. His wand is gone. His gaze wanders up again until it lands on the wand that is lying there in Neville's open palm.
It's weird just standing there, while he's sitting down. Just as I think this, an armchair appears next to me that I promptly sink into. A single strum down the strings alerts me to the boy in front of me. He plays a few chords, his gaze fixed on his left hand, before launching into a familiar intro.
Huh? It didn't make her heart pound like it usually did. His smile. And it did look a bit forced, didn't it?
Draco sighed. He had to see that she was right even if he wished she wasn't. She could feel his fingers tremble. He pulled his hand away and crossed his arms in front of his chest in an attempt to hide it.
Hello, hello! It's fall again. Such a lovely season, don't you agree? But on to more pressing questions. Like, what the heck happened to Haley? I don't know. But apparently, my characters want to go their own ways now. And I am left to listen to them and grant their wishes. If that makes any sense. (She reminds me a bit of Sophie from SGE now. I don't even know.)
' It was one of his favourite expressions because it assured him that she wasn't going to abandon him even if he messed up. Like just now, when he'd mentioned his father. Only casually, though but… it had probably reminded her. Reminded her of being tortured? He still couldn't believe… that had really happened.
"And you are going to do what? Play the white knight in shining armour?" He snorted. "What would your father say?"
He kissed her like someone being freed from a prison. Like someone being captured underground and finally seeing the sunlight after years of darkness. It was glorious. It was perfect.
"You looked so beautiful," the boy whispers dreamily. "In your green dress robes… and with those lovely flowers in your hair."
. Did she know who had sent it? When Draco couldn't keep the curiosity at bay any longer he stated, "It seems you know the author of that letter." He waited for an answer. But the girl only scowled. When it looked as though she wasn't going to reply, she heaved a heavy sigh.
"Oh! Yes, sure," she replied, handing the necklace along with the velvet box back to the boy. Then she pulled off her coat and carelessly dropped it to the ground. This time zone was much too warm for a winter coat and she would actually be able to put on the necklace like this.
He raised his hand toward her face and tilted it upwards, making her look at him. The movement caused her hood to fall away from her face, but it didn't matter. They were the only two people in the night.
The boy grinned. That was exactly what he'd had in mind. He needed something meaningful. With a connection to him. But what could that be? A star? A gingerbread man?
How was it possible to feel this much just because of a stupid Gryffindor? But it wasn't just any normal Gryffindor that was leaning against a shelf a few rows away from them. It was
Haley went after him, snaking her arms around his middle and tried to hold him back. "Calm down!" She hissed, stopping him inches away from the cabinet.
cheerful. But mostly gloomy. And frustrated. Which was understandable of course. But it was hard not to let it get to her as well. What good was it if they were both dejected and hopeless? She needed to stay strong for him. Keep the light alive in his eyes.
The boy rolls his eyes. "My point is that you're really ambitious and intelligent. I think you would have made an amazing Ravenclaw." He reaches for my hand and gives it a squeeze. "I would have, too. Wouldn't that have been nice? The two of us in Ravenclaw?"
"That's it. Now you've gone too far." He said darkly, tackling her to the ground and letting his fingers wander across her sides, seeking out her ticklish spots.
"You were the one who told me not to say her name," Lovegood reminded him, "Besides, I thought it was fitting. Did you know that some people call you the
"I… I never thought you weren't interesting. I… it was the opposite. I always wondered how someone as amazing as you could ever like
"Mother?" The voice asks again. If I don't answer, he'll probably check who entered the room. But I need a disguise! Something good – something… My eyes flit around the room until they finally rest on a poster. The same poster that I've seen only seconds ago in the dream corridor. It's worth a try, I guess. I close my eyes and concentrate hard on making myself look like Myron Wagtail. I've been a fan of the Weird Sisters for so long, that imagining what their lead singer looks like seems like child's play. I open my eyes again, spotting the black nail polish and countless silver rings sitting on my fingers. I notice that my hair is black as well, as it comes down to my left and right. I feel like an endlessly cool badass rocker now.
"I'll count to three." Malfoy said, mounting his Nimbus 2001. Haley quickly straddled her Firebolt, as the Slytherin fetched something shiny from his pocket. A snitch.
This was probably normal for her. Something weird and dangerous like this happened to her every year. First year, she'd gone after the philosopher's stone. Second, she sneaked into the Chamber of Secrets. Third year she'd somehow gotten involved with Sirius Black's flight and a horde of dementors. And fourth year? That had been worst. And not because of the dragons or the lake, or the maze… It had been worse because he'd actually
." She whined, turning her rat translucent instead of camouflaging it. She could see its tiny heart like this, thumping violently behind a pale ribcage. Did her own heart look the same? "He didn't even
Oh. Quidditch. She'd totally forgotten. She cursed the day she'd tried out for the quidditch team. Why wasn't there a guitar competition team or something in Hogwarts? Or an art club?
"No! I'd never!" Luna burst out. "It was a gift from you." She looked so indignant that Draco had to smile. A little bit.
"I am dating him," she spat defiantly. "I'm giving him a second chance. After all, I'm an actual human being," she glared at Hermione. "Not a monster." And with that, Haley shoved past the other girl and stalked toward the stairs leading to her dormitory. Everyone she passed, quickly made room for her and averted their eyes, pretending they hadn't eagerly watched the spectacle. Everyone except for a pair of sky blue eyes. Neville's eyes. There was a frown on his face. How much had he heard? Haley gulped uncomfortably. What did it matter anyway? He hadn't stood up for her either.
," she said to no one in particular and let go of the button. There was a flash of light, reminiscent of a camera flash and then the umbrella folded itself up. The only thing that was shielding them from the rain now was the tree they were standing underneath.
She couldn't even begin to think up a clever reply to that because her vision was filled with nothing but his grey eyes. The emotion in them was so intense that for a second she thought he was going to attack her. But to her surprise the attack turned out to be incredibly soft. It came in the form of a kiss.
As it happens, the next chapter plan is Christmas, so I'll try to post around the 24th/25th! See you guys then!
Harry shook his head. “No, Draco, look it's just,” He took a breath. “I was, am, confused with all of this.”
Harry tuned out the voices and focused on getting Draco to safety. All that mattered now was that Draco was alive.
Ron put a hand on his friend's shoulder, stopping him. Magic was probably not a good idea with Harry’s mindset right now.
I didn't expect anyone to read this, I was posting it for fun, but seeing the hits and kudos made my day!! Thank you so much!!
Ron walked in a few minutes later. “Hey, Hermione, have you seen-” He looked up, seeing Harry, and paused. “Oh. Er, Hey, Harry. Catching up on missed work?” Ron said, forcing a smile.
She had healed everything easily with magic. But she kept him overnight to keep an eye on him. Draco could tell that this wasn’t something that she was just going to brush off. He was anxiously awaiting the talk about what had happened.
Harry started skipping classes to avoid Draco. But when he fell behind, his friends were there to help.
Thanks for reading everyone!! Seeing that people read this and like it makes my day and makes me want to write more, so thanks so much!
P.S. did I mention it was angsty? no? oh- whoops. yeah, my writing went a little dark here... good luck!
Once this was over, Draco lied down and thought about the conversation he had earlier had with his friends.
Harry cut him off. “No, no Draco. I should’ve been here for you, I shouldn’t have pushed myself away from you for my own selfish reasons and left you to deal with this shit alone. I’m so sorry.”
Draco noticed how Harry rarely studied during the day, he instead stayed up late in the common room and studied alone. Harry was always tired after those nights, even if he didn’t show it.
Also, just a heads up: with school starting back up, chapters may not be updated as often. I will try to get them out at least once a month!
“I know, it’s only November, this weather is stupid!” Harry said, letting his eyes scan across the room. “We could move to the fireplace?” Harry suggested.
Harry started to write the statement that had been in his head before Draco had very rudely interrupted him.
They sat in the hallway outside the infirmary, legs curled up to their chests. With the silence in the hallway, they finally had time to think.
Harry had fallen asleep and dropped his head onto Draco's shoulder. Draco shifted slightly to be more comfortable and went back to studying, leaving the boy asleep on his shoulder.
I surprised myself and wrote a chapter that is about the same length as the last one (around 3300 words) and I’m pretty proud of it!
All Harry could think about was Draco's face is the firelight, the shape of his sharp, but soft jawline, his eyelashes brushing against his soft pale cheek, his platinum blonde hair swooping around his ears. Just thinking about the boy made Harry flush. What the bloody hell was wrong with him?
“Ron,” Harry whispered. “Why did he..” The words died in his throat as he broke into a sob. His head fell into his arms.
The mark was still visible but now it was blooming with colors. It looked magical, full of life rather than carrying death.
The headmaster laughed. “Patience young one. I was getting there. The houses will have to merge. We have arranged for Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff to be together and Gryffindor and Slytherin to room together!”
Her hand left his shoulder and she passed him a pamphlet. “Read this, hun.” She gave him a soft smile. “It will all be okay.”
Harry noticed Draco’s staring and the look on his face and frowned. He wanted to help, he wanted to take that look off of Draco’s face. He wanted to make the other boy smile and laugh. He wanted to make him happy.
Haley was shocked at the accusation. "You really think I would do something like this?" She snorted. "It's not like he wouldn't deserve it."
"Yes. Basically that," she says, "But even though I'm telling you all that it doesn't mean I don't trust you."
It was a seemingly normal Tuesday at lunch. Definitely more quiet than the morning had been when Haley had been on the receiving end of both Angelina Johnson's and Professor McGonnagall's angry outbursts. And on top of that she'd also lost five whole house points! What a morning!
this." He sounded defeated. And when he opened his grey eyes they seemed to be drowning in sorrow. She'd never seen him like this. It made something ache deep inside her chest. He placed his hand on top of the one cupping his cheek as if he needed something to hold on to.
Clearing his throat, he turned around to where a blanket had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and sat down on one end of it, gesturing for Haley to do the same.
table in the library. He'd ordered Crabbe and Goyle to do a background check on her. She was a fourth-year and her name was Luna Lovegood. People often called her "Loony" because she believed in the existence of all kinds of impossible creatures. Also her father was the producer of
Then he felt a surprisingly warm touch on his hand. He didn't have to check to know what it was. His skin seemed to remember the feeling of Haley's small but warm hand and his fingers curled up to greet it almost reflexively. She chuckled in a way that made him think she found his reaction amusing. He had to admit that it was a tad pathetic. But that didn't bother him enough for him to pull his hand away and go without her touch. Not when it made his skin tingle as if a thousand little ants were crawling up and down his arm.
"G'night," Haley added with a tiny smile and turned to walk toward the stairs, leading to the dorms before either of her friends had the chance to say anything else.
"I'm just… glad to see you," she admitted, burying her face in his robes. "I was kinda afraid, you might go back to hiding from me."
"What?" He asked somewhat aggressively, when he noticed her staring. Haley only shook her head and turned to the cupboard as well.
Coming to Hogwarts had made her happy. She'd found her first real friends there. And Sirius… And also… she'd found Draco. She'd found love. And by trying to save one thing, she'd sacrificed the other…
"Oh! Hello, Haley!" The blonde said with a smile, "We learned about Singing Grass today. It was really interesting! Did you know that there is a flute made of Singing Grass that produces a sound similar to the human voice if you play it?"
"Er…" She had actually been hoping to sit with Neville but she had spotted him sitting with Hermione and the other Gryffindors from their year. There really weren't many other options. "Sure," she agreed, trying not to sound too disappointed. "Why not."
"All right. Er… make yourself at home, I guess." With that, she fled to her own bedroom. For some time, nothing but faint noises could be heard from the other room. He seemed to be settling in for the night. Haley tried to do the same, but she couldn't stop worrying about him.
"Why don't you ask the Lion Princess herself? I'm surprised you didn't ask her yesterday," she said in her usually dreamy voice. Draco almost didn't notice her subtle hinting at the date. He grinned triumphantly. Finally she had given in.
What was that? Runes? He had seen these symbols before. Regulus had had a phase where he'd been interested in all kinds of secret codes and runes once. He glanced back at the page.
