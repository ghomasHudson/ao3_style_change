By the way, totes forgot to mention that the song title comes from the Vince Vance and the Valiants version, not the Mariah Carey one.
Yelping as snow went down the back of his shirt, Harry rolled to the side, taking Teddy with him. Next to them Draco sat up, shaking snow from his hair and making the pale strands fall into his face. The streetlights coming on turned his hair silver, and Harry got caught up in looking at him until Teddy grabbed his face.
Harry laughed so hard he doubled over, hands on his knees and wheezing. Draco was about to ask if he was all right, when he straightened, cupped the blond’s face, and pressed their lips together. “You’re amazing, you know that? An asshole but amazing.”
“Grandma said she used to do that, but she forgot how to fold it.”
Ron whistled through his teeth. “Damn. Whoever your secret Santa is, hook me up?”
Harry blinked rapidly, then slid his hand down to clasp Draco’s, lifting it and kissing his fingers. “I understand, but I promise to do my best to deserve it.”
“You look as bad as Harry, mate.”
Draco turned to look at him, not missing a beat of conversation. “I have a potion for that.”
“Harry. I told you. Call me Harry.” The lift came to a stop on their floor, and he stepped to one side, hand on the door to keep it open, and motioned Draco out. “I’ll let you know the next time I have him, see if you’d like to come to dinner again.”
“Harry.” Smiling, he laced his fingers with Draco. “And I guess we just have a special bond after all we’ve been through. I guess we’re just something special.”
The letter slipped to the bed, and it took several minutes until his eyes stopped watering. How could he be so seen by someone he didn’t know? How could he be so seen period? He worked hard to keep the soft places of himself hidden, not wanting them to be a liability to himself of anyone, to close himself off.
This chapter is also a bit short, so I'd normally have combined this one and the previous. I wanted to keep the two separate because of following different POVs. Hope no one is too angry at the shorter length!!
“You should come play. Help us put this one’s ego back in it’s place.” He shoved Harry in the side of the head, and Harry elbowed him, the two quickly dissolving into a wrestling match.
Sighing, Draco set aside the vial and pulled Harry into a deep kiss, licking into his mouth with a soft groan. “Yes.”
“So, the thing is.” Ron took a deep breath and faced him straight on. “The thing is, you’ve been really sad, lately. For a long time, if I’m honest. And you hide it well, but you’ve been sad, especially around the holidays. Only this year, you haven’t been sad. Not like normal. And I think it’s because of Malfoy. Draco, I mean.”
Harry laughed so hard he almost spilled his coffee and had to right his tray before continuing to read.
Draco waved his wand, enclosing the cauldron in a bubble, and stepped back. “It’s sort of like an extra-strength dungbomb, but it’s meant to also fill the space with fumes that mimic the Swelling Solution. I got the idea from a muggle Auror show I’ve been watching. It would effectively incapacitate a room full suspects without doing any lasting damage.”
Draco grimaced and rubbed his face, feeling very much like a first-year again. “I, um, I can. Um.”
She smiled, “You are, too. And so is Draco.” She laughed when Harry started at her words. “I’ve worked with him recently on a fundraising project, and he’s grown into someone I’m happy to call a friend. If you want to call him more than a friend.” She waggled her brows. “Go for it.” Harry blushed, and she laughed harder, hugging him again. “Thank you for understanding.”
Draco straightened as Harry crossed the room, cupped his face, and dipped his head to kiss him, nipping his full lower lip. “Please owl me if that changes? Please?”
After a few rounds through the park, the sleigh changed directions and took them into the nearby town, stopping in front of a shopping center. “Here ye’re. Santa is just inside.”
“What?”
“It’s cute!”
“It’s useless against you guys without a beater.” Bones shook sweaty hair out of her face. “The two of you are unstoppable. Good to know you’ve got a backup career if you decide Ministry work isn’t for you anymore.”
Draco laughed, the sound high-pitched and too sharp. “No. I don’t suppose I was supposed to.” Standing, Draco paced in a circle, holding up his hand and backing away from Harry when he tried to step closer. “Don’t. Just don’t. I’m a case? This was all a case.”
Ginny still barely spoke to him, communicating in jerks of her head and grunts, but Luna met him for tea twice a week. She didn’t always tell him when she was meeting him for tea, just randomly showed up at his house, opening the door and walking in as if his wards meant nothing to her. She was far scarier than she let on, and he was regularly reminded of how grateful he was that she used her power for good and Wrackspruts.
Draco stared for a moment, looking at Harry, not the clothes, then strode across the room and kissed him hard, tongue battling for entrance then dominance.
“It’s Harry.” He smiled, scrubbing his fingers through his hair, realizing he’d been using Draco’s given name all night, and not just for Teddy’s benefit. “And you’re welcome.”
“Lunch break, though I’m taking a bit of a long one in order to have time for this purchase.”
Hermione nodded, digging through her bag for a notebook to scribble a note to herself. “I’ll look into him. Thank you. I’m guessing I’ve got your support, too, since you’re who funded the bill’s start?”
“Blinding Lumos, sun in a jar kind of thing. Some buff vampire show did it.”
Draco’s vision blurred as he realized this was a list of the times he’d been with Harry. He heard the crash of his cup slipping from his fingers and onto the floor. Heard a shout and the sound of feet running, looking up to see Harry stumble to a stop just inside the room.
“Dray?” Harry wrapped his arms around the other man. “What’s wrong?”
Our soft boys play Quidditch
“That’s too fancy for the Burrow.”
Harry hugged Draco tighter, thinking back to the insane mess of his office versus the boy who never had a hair out of place or wore anything but the best. “Well, we could get a gnome.”
Harry gaped. Malfoy was taking the blame? Malfoy, whom he’d just walked into, knocked off balance, was taking the blame for their collision.
figured out I liked guys! I’d only dated women before him.”
Draco’s cheeks heated, and he struggled not to smile back. “Snape hated me, really. It just looked good for his reputation around purebloods and Death Eaters to dote on me.” Draco quit fighting and let himself smile. “I did beat his scores on the Potions Master exams, though.” He felt a rush of pride when Potter’s smile widened at that. “I want to learn to feed myself. I enjoy knowing I’m not dependent upon others.” He shrugged, lowering his gaze as he scooped up his next bite. “And knowing that no one is responsible for my life. For keeping my alive.”
Draco stared, lower lip quivering a bit. “How? How do you always manage to get to the core of me, Potter?”
Harry reached out with a napkin to wipe Teddy’s face, face even hotter at the idea of Malfoy helping Teddy get him a gift. “Chew and swallow, kiddo. What about Mal— I mean, cousin Draco? You didn’t buy his gift in front of him, did you?”
When the reached the Ministry pitch, the others were already there, George included. Since there were only twelve of them, they decided to play without seekers, Harry and Draco ending up Chasers on the same team. Within minutes of starting the game, it became obvious they were the force to beat. They flew in sync, years of flying against each other letting them know how the other moved, when to dodge the other’s dive.
“The lights go on first.”
“No. Fuck no.” Harry slanted his lips over Draco’s, irises blown wide. “I wanna hear you. I want you to scream yourself hoarse and know that I caused that.”
Draco’s whole body shuddered, not answering, and Harry caught and held his breath. Finally, he said, “Okay.”
Harry froze, mid-step. “Seriously?”
“It’s a gnome.”
The Malfoy box was large, lavish, and decorated in green, silver, and snakes, making Harry laugh.
Harry laughed and nodded. “Arthur, why don’t you tell Draco about what we’ve done to the bike. He’s a bit nervous about it.”
Draco had heard that Potter’s upbringing wasn’t the nicest, but he didn’t feel comfortable asking if that was why he disliked cooking. “I enjoy cooking, actually. Reminds me of potions.” Draco huffed a slight laugh, pushing his curry around his plate. “I’m pants at it, though.”
Harry could feel himself grow red, and he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I mean. Well, yeah, no, I thought you were off today.”
They curled up together, kissing and making plans until it was almost time for the boys to arrive.
“You’re meant for hooligan.”
Remus shrugged, “You never know. She just might.”
Teddy woke Harry early, starving since he hadn’t eaten dinner the night before, so Harry had Kreatcher make a full English breakfast while he helped Teddy get dressed and collect his things. Once they’d both eaten, Harry floo’d Teddy home, arriving at work an hour late.
“Yes, you can, baby. Just let go and ride it out. It’ll feel even better when you do.” He sped his hips, each thrust sharper and harder, and in seconds Draco was shouting his name, body spurting between their stomachs as his core rippled, milking Harry’s cock.
“Baking is like potions. Cooking is chaos.”
I am so sorry for the delay in posting this chapter. I had family holiday stuff and some mental health issues making me feel a bit too bleh to do it justice. I'm back, though, and I'm already starting on the next chapter. I think that will be the last one, but I could be persuaded to add more. We'll see.
“You’ll stay with me?”
Okay, the semester has started, and it's HELLA crazy, so I'm ending this piece here. I have some others that I'm working on, though, and once I get a few chapters written and/or outlined, I'll start posting one of those. Thank you everyone for the sweet comments and kudos and reading!
The man huffed out a breath, muttering for Harry to remove his elbow from his stomach and sit still.
Sirius looked from his fiancé to his godson then back to Draco and nodded again. He pulled Harry out of the way when Draco motioned them aside and pulled out his wand. “It won’t do any good to blast her. I’ve tried. Depulso. Incendio. Nothing works. Just damages the wall.”
Harry paused, tapping the end of his quill to his cheek as he tried to formulate his thoughts, not sure how much of himself he wanted to put in a letter that was going to what could be a stranger to him.
Harry kept reading all night, not stopping until he’d gone through the book twice. It was only when the sun started to come up that he realized how long it had been. Clutching the book to his chest, he made his way upstairs to fall into bed and get a couple hours of sleep, still not letting go.
Harry opened his mouth to apologize but ended up stepping forward and hugging Draco, wrapping his tightly around the other man’s shoulders and pressing his face into his neck, inhaling deeply. “My bad.”
Harry ran though the days in his head. “Eleven. No, ten. Day ten. Ten traditions. Do I even know ten traditions?”
“I love when you get like this for me. Watching all that perfect posh politeness fade.” He punctuated each P word with an upward grind of his hips, grinning ferally as Draco whined and writhed in return. He worked his hands between their bodies to tug their flies down, pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses along Draco’s neck and down to his shoulder.
The tiny bird bounced around Harry’s desk, nudging at everything, then flew over to a filing cabinet and did the same. Like he was learning the office. Like he wanted to learn it. Like he wanted to be so good at whatever Harry might ask of him.
Harry met him halfway across the room. “We. We didn’t fake any of it. I was stupid and should have ended the case sooner, should have been honest with you sooner. But I didn’t fake anything.” Cupping Draco’s face, he pressed their foreheads together. “I will spend as long as you need proving that. I will risk my job and let you read all the correspondence between Robards and me for the rest of forever. I’ll do whatever you need to know that I do really love you.”
The moved as one, Harry stepping back and sitting on the plush couch-like seats of the box and Draco coming with him, crawling into his lap. Their lips found each other again, and Harry gripped Draco’s ass to pull their groins just as tightly against one another. Draco cried out softly, head falling back, and Harry gnashed his teeth along the delicate column of his throat, snarling as it wrenched another cry from the blond.
He nodded and walk a few feet down the hall before looking back at her. “Do I? I mean, as a professor with my own quarters, how do I handle asking someone to visit? If I decided to?”
“What’s the meaning of this, Potter?”
“The same way you can be an Auror when you keep getting lost in your own head and walking into me.”
Harry nodded and stood, brushing the snow off himself then holding his hand out to help Draco up. The other man paused for a moment, licking his lips as he stared at Harry’s hand, then reached out, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. They ended up each holding one of Teddy’s hands and swinging him between them every few steps.
They walked downstairs together after cleaning up from breakfast, holding hands, but Draco started to pull away before they entered the lobby. “Draco, is this because you’re not ready to hold my hand or because you don’t think I’m ready.” Draco bit his lip, and Harry took his hand again, crossing the lobby and kissing his cheek. “Have a good day.”
“Yes, Teddy.” Draco laughed, helping him down. “Don’t muggles take pictures with him? Wizarding children do.”
Harry starred at the other man, shuddering, having not realized how much he wanted someone to speak to when his days were like this. “Someone almost fucked up the Rosier case.”
“I love you, too.”
“Letter? Run?” Harry groaned and rubbed both hands over his face. He hadn’t set an alarm to run today, having wanted to sleep in and enjoy the high from last night. And he hadn’t look for a letter while heading downstairs to answer the door. “Accio letter.” It zipped into his hand, and he tore it open.
Tenth, a jam roly-poly
“Fine, what are you? Wait, are you transfiguring one of my shirts to fit you?’
Harry had sent owls, come to his flat, even reached out to Minerva. He didn’t want excuses, though. Didn’t want apologies, even if they were honest, because that wouldn’t undo the damage. He’d lost the last tie to his family, lost friends that he wasn’t even sure he’d ever actually had, lost his heart. Just how much of this last summer had been a lie? Draco blew out a long breath and scrubbed his hands through his hair, letting his head hang.
Draco wrapped his arms around himself, voice a shuddering whisper. “Never. I’d never have hurt him.”
An hour later, most of Harry’s house looked like a Christmas catalogue had thrown up before being buffeted by a tornado, but Teddy was pretty proud of what they’d accomplished.  The gingerbread was also done, and that scent of that sweet, spicy cookie made everyone join together in the kitchen.
Harry smiled and kissed Draco, fingers tangling through his hair. “Mmm, boyfriend, huh?” Draco blushed at the slip, knowing they hadn’t talked about labels, but Harry just waggled his brows. “I like the sound of that.”
The woman behind the counter smiled and shook her head, “No. It was left here in expectation of you.”
Harry laughed until he couldn’t breathe, wishing Draco was here to be part of all this. When Molly slipped away to the kitchen to check on her pies, leaving Arthur to lead clean up, Harry followed. “Hey. I had a question.”
“No, no, that’s exactly why.” Draco nodded, motioning to himself. “His family went to pot after his father’s death during the first war. It was just him and his mother, who didn’t support the whole pureblood thing as it turned out she wasn’t actually one herself. Hidden affair led to her being half-blood, you see. Anyways, Voldemort turned on them, and they lacked the money necessary to rebuild their reputation. He’s managed to work his way up in the Ministry, though, and if you gave him a chance to put his name on something so big, especially when that connects him to your name.” Draco shrugged. “Slytherin’s know a good thing, know what will get them ahead, but we’re also willing to put in work to achieve our goals.”
“You do that every time.” Draco paused and looked up. “You always thank the staff, even when they bring something for someone else. And you set up your fork and stuff all fancy-like.”
“I didn’t fund it. Bills don’t exactly get funded,” Draco mumbled, looking at his plate.
He wrapped his hand around his length, feeling the same callouses mentioned in the note, wondering how a smoother hand would feel. One with long, tapered fingers that ended in carefully manicured nails. Shuddering, he twisted on each upstroke.
Harry caught his hands. “Yeah, that’s what a family is like. Andromeda and Teddy are just as bad about fussing over you and making you eat, if you give them the chance. Dre is just sneakier about it. You end up with half a meal and three desserts and thinking you’re somehow doing her a favor by taking it.”
Draco knocked his tea cup over, though it was at least mostly empty. “Me? At the Weasley house? I don’t think so Potter.”
“Can’t imagine that would be.” Draco’s words are drawn out slowly, hesitant, like he wasn’t sure why Ron was telling him this, and honestly, Harry was just as confused.
Draco felt his entire body melt, tongue going thick and awkward as he stammered out a hello.
The next morning, the same grey shower of sleet was coming down, making everything icy and everyone on edge, the same frustrated parents were running around to get their children gifts, and the same annoyed Harry Potter stomped into office. However, before he could close the door, Grinch flew out.
“Because you’ve never asked.”
“Very cottage style.” Harry frowned as he looked over at Draco who’d stepped away to peer over the wall. “There’s a tradition in English gardens to leave things a bit wilder, more dense and less ornate. Grace versus grandeur kind of thing. I’ve never seen one, though. Mother always liked pristine order and neatness. Oh! What’s that?”
“Big day for me, too.”
Sirius merely grimaced and nodded, struggling to cover the portrait again. “Bellatrix sounded just like good old mum.”
“I want to.” Draco nipped Harry’s lips, making the other man open his eyes. “Last night.” He shook his head. “I was still hiding. I knew I hadn’t told them, hadn’t been honest with them. Or myself really. But I’m not, now.” He kissed him again. “I love you. I trust you.” Another kiss. “I know you won’t hurt me.” Another kiss, followed by a smile. “I want this with you.”
Clearing his throat, he stepped back, scrubbing his face again, mind scrambling for a way to explain what he knew would be bloodshot eyes. His mind had spent the day whirling back to that first year of Hogwarts, and he braced for the biting sarcasm and bitterness that hung from Malfoy’s arrogant, eleven-year-old shoulders.
“I’m fine sitting anywhere, so long as I’m seeing the game and with you.” Harry squeezed his hand, knowing Draco was hinting where he’d be more comfortable but not trying to push. “But I also don’t mind more space to move around. I get into quidditch.”
“What the? Hey!” Dropping his robes, he started to follow but realized the bird was already around a corner and out of sight. “Dammit.” Running his hands through his hair, he sighed, knowing all he could do was hope the bird came back then wondering when he started caring if any bird came back. His sighed turned to a growl and he snatched his robes from the floor and hung them. “Dammit.”
Harry suddenly remembered being very small while someone very large yelled at him for something accidental. Harry sat heavily, struggling to breathe for a moment. “I’m sorry Grinch. I know you didn’t mean to. This isn’t your fault, not really, and I’m sorry.” The bird chirped at him, pushing one leg closer, and Harry realized it was the leg that did not have a letter tied to it but did seem to have taken the worst of the splattered hot tea. Cursing under his breath, he waved his wand to clean the mess from the bird any everything else and scooped up the small animal. “Are you all right? Is it hurt badly?” Grinch chirped again, seemed to examine his own small appendage, then held the other leg out to him. The one with the letter. Smiling, Harry shook his head, “I suppose not, huh?” He took the letter, gave Grinch a few treats, then set the missive aside and collected his reports.
“Is dinner ready, yet?”
Snowballs flew every direction, Draco and Harry usually aiming for one another with Teddy throwing at whoever was closest.
“So that’s what family is like?” He seemed to catch himself, scrubbed his hands through his hair, and shook his head. “Your family is like. That’s what your family is like.”
When Harry headed downstairs for breakfast the next morning, he found two notes sitting on the kitchen table. One from Percy, saying the solution for the acne issue arrived the previous night, and the other from his love.
Harry was always pissed if someone interrupted his work with no warning, though, and he didn’t want to piss Draco off this early in their relationship. Or at least what he hoped was a relationship.
The redhead was shorter than him but strong from her career as a Chaser, and she grabbed his arm to stop him. “I don’t care. The two of you are miserable apart, and I miss my friend being happy.”
“I suppose that means you aren’t free to go to Christmas dinner.”
“That’s Canis Major and the Sirius star. If you move your binoculars up and over a bit. There. You should see the Potter star.”
Harry nodded, reaching out to place his hand over Draco’s. The former Death Eater’s descendant had been caught a few months earlier using the Imperius Curse to abuse younger family members. “The evidence collected had been misplaced, possibly breaking the chain of evidence and making it null. Luckily, even though everything was in the wrong spot, the paperwork on that wrong spot was correct, so it should all work out.”
“He lets me borrow those.” Every bit of old Malfoy pride and glee was back in Draco’s voice at once again having something to hold over Harry, but there was no malice this time. Only pride that he was allowed something so sacred, something precious to Harry’s inner sanctum. “I currently have Queen’s debut at my place. They one autographed by Freddie himself.”
Draco blushed and nodded, pressing closer. “Yeah, yeah it does.”
Sirius had merely stared while Remus choked on his tea with laughter.
Harry sputtered, “First editions? He lets you touch those?”
“Let’s go home, Grinch.” The bird popped up, flying three circles around the office before diving onto Harry’s shoulder, nipping at his ear. “Okay, okay. I’m excited, too.” Harry laughed and locked the door, still grinning when he once again met Malfoy at the lifts. “Afternoon. I didn’t think you were scheduled for today.”
“Are you sure you’re okay with this? With Harry dating Draco?”
“He can’t do twelve in one day. He can’t. Oh, who am I kidding. He’s Harry fucking Potter. Watch him do what I did and better.” Smiling, Draco wiped his eyes. “Or at least faster.”
Upon check out, Harry got another package of socks, and he did a quick inventory. “Yeah, that’s seven.” Opening the package, he laughed when he saw the potions-themed socks. “Perfect for opening with you, huh?”
Draco swallowed hard. “I love you, too.”
Draco had always been able to compartmentalize, focus on what was in front of him, but Harry had always been able to ruin Draco’s best laid plans. He gave up on work. Instead, he indulged in his chocolates and waited for the next package.
“I honestly don’t know that he’s ever spoken to me, so that’s not too hard.” Harry looked at Draco, tie discarded, shirt unbuttoned the top few, sweat making it cling to the narrow planes of his chest, his pulse pounding against the hollow of his throat. Harry wondered what that hollow would taste like. If he’d be able to feel Draco’s pulse against his tongue. He cleared his throat as he realized he was starring, turning to look back where Lee and Alicia were still chatting. “So, yeah.”
I said this would be the end, but it's not. I'm doing at least one more chapter. Probably a couple more. I've had a major blow recently, and I need to give these boys a little more happiness before I can let them go.
“Uncle Harry!”
Draco laughed, the sound relaxed and truly happy. “We’ll put them at one end to themselves.”
Harry laughed at sat, setting their food down. “I heard the Blacks could give you a run for your money.”
“Snobbery does come with a price. Marrying your cousin. Children with extra toes. Following the Lord of the Idiots into battle.”
Biting his lip, Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’m sure.”
“Harry what?”
He had just set out all the food and drinks when Draco barged in.
He wondered briefly if he should do something other than sit at home and drink, be more proactive than wallowing in his own self-pity, but it was a Thursday and he’d been splashed with cold water on his way to work and yelled at by a father for not making sure some new broom toy was available on time, as if he had any control over that, so he thought some wallowing was due. He’d worry about the adult way to handle holiday loneliness tomorrow.
After they finished their spaghetti and garlic bread, Draco pulled a chocolate mousse out of the fridge, and they finished the wine while eating that. They cleaned up together, Harry flicking soap bubbles at Draco, and Draco swatting him with a dishtowel, before getting glasses of firewhiskey and moving to sit in the living room to continue their conversation until Draco began yawning and Harry felt his eyes droop.
“Did you see me? I really went for it! Like, really did. No fear!” He danced around in a circle as he and Harry headed for their favorite lunch place. Getting food together had become as much a part of their ritual as the game itself.
“Dammit! Grinch!” Standing quickly as hot liquid splattered him as well as the desk and paperwork. “What’s wrong with you?” The little animal had been squawking and hopping around swinging his leg, but quickly quieted and shrank down at Harry’s bellow.
“Kreatcher can do it with a snap, huh?”
Harry watched as Draco’s wand swished in one hand, his other hand hitting buttons on the stove and sliding in the pan of bread, amazed by the ease with which he combined wizarding and muggle behaviors. In moments, bowls of spaghetti bol were steaming on the table, the wine sitting between them.
His day went to hell after that. It started sleeting on his walk to work, and he’d forgotten his umbrella. The heating spells were wonky at the Ministry, and his office was so cold he could see his breath. Some paperwork hadn’t been filed correctly, so evidence had been possibly mishandled, and he spent three hours chasing down the actual lost items. He then had to figure out if they were still useable in court and then file the correct original paperwork and then the extra paperwork to explain what had happened and how it had been fixed. An emergency meeting was called to discuss what could be done about the outbreak of Christmas toy scalpers. Next, he had to take over an afternoon training class when the instructor called in sick, and he had a student who could rival Neville for chaos creation and Seamus for blowing things up. Finally, he had another meeting and hour of paperwork to finalize that the problem from that morning was completely fixed.
Draco grinned. “I may or may not be one of the people funding the broom and thus have some inside information.” His smile faded as he lifted the lid to the box he’d just unwrapped. “This is. Harry.” In the box were a set of potions utensils made with unicorn horn handles and two silver cauldrons encrusted with emeralds, one collapsible and one self-stirring.
“How do we make frosting, Cousin Draco?”
He’d also distanced himself because of that. From the Weasleys, afraid they would only see the empty space at the table. From Andromeda and Teddy, worried he would just be a reminder of the child and parents that weren’t there. From his friends, scared seeing him would just bring flashbacks of flying curses and cold tents.
Harry flipped through pictures of his parents’ wedding, a few of his mother pregnant. His favorite was one of his mother sitting in a rocking chair, his father kneeling before her with his hands on her stomach. He was smiling in a besotted way, looking at where his hands touched her stomach, and she was smiling at him, just as smitten. The image moved, James looking up at Lily, and when their eyes met, they both grinned widely. Harry remembered thinking his mother had hated his father after seeing Snape’s memory, but this image proved that was wrong. So wrong. They were so obviously in love that it hurt to watch. It was a good hurt, though, and Harry stared at the moving image until his tea went cold.
Draco’s mouth dropped open for a moment before he responded. “Didn’t think you’d noticed, Potter.”
Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s lips, full and a deep pink from the cold. He swallowed hard as he felt the urge to kiss Draco and see if his lips were as soft as they looked. Before he could follow through with that urge, though, Teddy dove on top of them, dumping an armful over snow on them both.
“Hi, kiddo. Did you enjoy your Christmas?” Teddy nodded as Harry carried him to the kitchen. “Are you washed up for dinner? No? Okay, we’ll wash up together. Andromeda, do you need help?”
“Well, yeah? Aren’t we?”
Harry stalked forward and tugged Draco’s hands away, stretching out over his body. “Don’t hide from me, please. I love looking at you.” His mouth trailed down Draco’s neck and over his collar bones. “You’re so soft, so delicate. I feel like I shouldn’t be trusted to touch you, but damn.” He gnashed his teeth over the sharp jut of Draco’s hip, making him yelp and moan. “I never want to stop. All of you is long and pale and perfect.” He wrapped his hand around Draco’s length, tugging, and Draco’s moan stuck in his throat, cracking. “All of you.”
Moreover… “Is that my shirt?” Draco wasn’t sure if he’d meant to ask that question, but he suddenly realized that Harry was wearing the same grey button-up he’d left when he’d apparated away over his tee.
They called Teddy back over to open his cleaning kit, laughing as he crashed twice on his way over.
This continues the previous chapter and everyone having lunch, though.
Another hour passed and a familiar otter arrived for Ron, Davies and Cadwallader also leaving since they had early days. Alicia bowed out then, too, sitting with Lee to watch the rest play. The last of them played three on three for almost another hour before Boot and Bones bowed out.
He missed them, though. Missed the birthdays he bowed out of early. The Christmases and holidays he worked. The weekly dinners he said no to. Missed the warmth and laughter and grief that was family and healing. More so, he deserved that. Just as he’d said to Draco, he’d been a pawn, forced into a war he didn’t start, and the blame for it all was not on him, even though he’d been shouldering it for years.
“Really? Bloody hell, mate, that’d be awesome. I don’t think Hermione would be interested, but I don’t think she’ll mind having an afternoon free of me.” Ron laughed, clapping Draco on the back. “George would probably love to come, though. If you don’t mind, that is.”
“Teddy, no!” It was too late, though. The snowball hit its mark, smacking Draco in the side of the head. Harry froze as Draco stopped, head turning. His scarf was up around his mouth, hat pulled low, so it was impossible to tell his reaction. Just as Harry started to apologize for Teddy, Draco launched forward, tacking the little boy to the ground and tickling him, making Teddy squeal with laughter even though he probably couldn’t feel much through his thick jacket
Remus laughed and cried at the same time, nodding. “I’d have said yes then. I’d have said yes when we first met back up. I’ll say yes until the day we die.”
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco, face pressed into the other man’s shoulder. “Never again. I promise you. Never again.” He kissed Draco’s cheek before moving to join Sirius. “Here, let me help.”
“I can feel you lurking, Potter.”
Draco’s composure snapped. “Oh? Miss everyone’s hero being comfortable about using me? Miss feeling okay with lying to Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and all-around bastard?” Draco sneered. “I’ve worked hard to be more than my past, dammit, but at least my poor behavior stemmed from love.” He turned to leave again, stopping short when Ginny spoke up.
is so
They soon fell back into their position from upstairs, Harry tucked against Draco’s side. Harry leaned up, kissing Draco again, just a brush of lips, nuzzle of noses, neither ready for rushing into more or breaking the sweetness of the night. They curled together, faces touching, as the both fell asleep.
Harry stepped closer to him, arms around his waist. “That moving potato thing?” Draco nodded. “That’s a gnome.”
“Um…yeah?” Draco looked around the seating area then leaned to peer out the windows as much as he could, expecting to see the area surrounded by Aurors or staked out by former DA members, all ready to attack or arrest him for daring and be out and about in a muggle area. That was preposterous, though. He’d been having dinner at this restaurant every Tuesday for months, and no one had bothered him, yet. Tuesdays were their quietest nights, and he always had leftovers for Wednesday, which had been his long day of travel and training with Horace.
“So what are you plans for the holidays? Other than work.” He smiled over at Draco, honestly curious as to what the other man did. He knew Draco had moved out of the Manor as soon as his house arrest ended, but his parents still lived there.
His words cut off as Harry took his arm. “I don’t understand why you wouldn’t think I’d like you.” Realizing how his words sounded, how they might be taken, hell, how he might be meaning them, Harry felt himself turn just as red as Draco. “I mean, we were both pawns in someone else’s war, just on different sides. It’s not like either of us had much choice in what we were told we had to do.” He dropped Draco’s arm, laughing without any real mirth behind it and stepped back to lean against the counter. “Innocents shouldn’t be punished for the plotting of others, right? We were innocents, just kids. I’d like to think who we really are, underneath all of that, is who we are now.”
Harry’s hands were calloused, rough, the nails short and blunt, and he touched every bit of Draco with them, scrapping in a way that contrasted the hot, smooth bob of his head as he sucked Draco deeper into his mouth. Then, those fingers slide down Draco’s cleft, swirled over his hole, and he whined, body clenching. Harry just continued to rub, though, teasing. Draco’s hips bucked upward, whines turning to cries with each roll of his body. Harry suddenly pressed his thumb to that spot just behind Draco’s balls and used his other hand to tug them.
“What is this? Some holiday extra?”
Most of this fic is in Draco's POV, but I wanted to break a bit and give people a little happy glimpse of WolfStar, as they lived. The next chapter will be back to Draco and build off this one, and since this one was shorter, I'll post sooner. Promise <3
“I don’t believe you and I have a day off together, Potter.” The posh accents were back in Draco’s voice, punctuating every syllable.
“I’m going to gain a million pounds, if I do, though. You have all that Auror training. I sit around a lab.”
Draco had been taught loyalty his entire life. Loyalty to family and the family’s name and reputation. Loyalty to their beliefs and status. To their slurs and prejudice. Then, when his family’s lives were threatened, he was taught loyalty to the Dark Lord. Had it instilled into the marrow of his bones through hours of the Cruciatus Curse mingled with Aunt Bella picking through his mind, all while his mother and godfather stood and watched. He’d learned to nod and agree and repeat what was said to him and stop throwing up while watching others be tortured before him.
Molly walked in, drying her hands on a dishtowel. “Having a baby?”
They were waiting for their godson to come over with Sirius’s second cousin….and Harry’s apparent new boyfriend.
The final arrival was once again with Grinch, a short note of
Draco nodded. “I was. I’ve been afraid to lose them because I lost a lot of people during the war and stuff, which I know was my own fault, but I don’t have much left.” His voice cracked, and he had to clear his throat. “I was afraid of being alone. I’m not afraid of that anymore, though. Not now that I have you.”
Draco’s mouth twisted, curving upward to one side. “Damaging the wall is my goal.” He pointed his wand and fired off several careful aimed blasts around the portrait, leaving half a dozen holes punctured almost completely through the wall. Everyone stayed quiet as he continued to stand stock still and study his work. After several long minutes, he laughed. “She’s stuck to the wall, but the wall isn’t stuck.” He turned and took in the confused faces of the others. “The wall isn’t repairing itself. It’s just a wall.” No one seemed to catch on. “That means, you could rip the wall out around her portrait.”
Draco sat, sipping his tea, making a sound of approval when it was the right flavor. “Could be a bit hotter, but mother says I’m going to scald off my taste buds one morning.”
Harry had laughed at that, gaze running down Draco’s frame. “I don’t think you need to worry. You seem pretty naturally lean. You could always start joining us for pick up quidditch games, if you want.” He grinned, leaning closer to Draco. “And if you think you can still keep up with me.”
“Come on. We’ll start on this, and I’ll accio the bread once it’s done. Tell me about your day.”
“I’m sorry, by the way.”
Harry slicked himself with more of the lube then lined up and pressed slowly inside, cursing under his breath as the head breached Draco’s body and hesitating.
“I should go to work. Let you two get on with it.”
“It’s because of my father, isn’t it? The renewed interest in me. I still had lunch at the Manor regularly, so they worried about me being back under control of my father.”
“No. No, we don’t.”
This time, Harry interlaced their fingers, lifted their hands, and kissed Draco’s palm. “I trust you.”
“You damn well will,” Draco growled, taking Harry by the arm and dragging him, still complaining, after Teddy and into building to stand in the short line.
Harry didn’t set his alarm the next morning, and though his body still woke him fairly early, he managed an extra hour of sleep before making his way downstairs to breakfast, wondering if he could convince Kreatcher to make more of those cinnamon rolls from yesterday. He stopped cold when he reached the kitchen, though, the heel of one hand still pressed against his eye as he scrubbed the last of sleep away. Harry had remodeled most of Grimmauld place, getting rid of the cobwebs, elf heads, and portraits of Walburga, but he’d kept a few items that reminded him of what had happened here. One of those was the long table he and the Order sat at while planning during the War. He often sat at the same place Sirius had, placed his hands where his godfather had in an attempt to still feel close to him.
Harry started to ask how Draco knew he always stopped for ice cream but stopped himself and just nodded. Of course, Draco knew. “It’s been a few hours since then.”
Draco nodded and kissed him again. “I trust you, Harry. I want this with you.”
They spent most of the afternoon at the Burrow, sitting in front of the fire and telling Draco stories of the trouble they all got into as kids.
Harry felt his body relax as he released the breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding, the same choked, sob-like sound from the morning repeating. Then, he’d nodded at the bird and left.
Draco smiled softly, “Yes, three of your older brothers have children, now, do they not.”
The third gift was a stocking with a note that they would add it to the collection they hung next year. Fourth, Draco received a note that 1,000 galleons each were donated to Wizarding War Memorial for Snape, Vince, and Narcissa with another 1,000 to the Wizarding Pride Project in Lucius’s name, just to piss him off.
“Bushes.” The creases disappeared from Draco’s face as he smiled fully. “Blueberries grow on bushes. They’re my favorite.”
Loyalty to himself and his own beliefs felt pretty damn good.
“She raised seven of them. I think she’s used to it.”
Harry nodded. “I think so. I told them that wasn’t true, though. And Seamus and Dean agreed to write character reports for you, since you were around them all the time, even without me. And Lee vouched for you from our games. He’s not an Auror, but he works with our department as PR, so they trust him.”
Harry’s blush increased, not wanting to let anyone know about his admirer, wanting that to be something that was just his for now. “It seems. What about you? Are you ready for the holiday?”
Harry snorted. “I can hear you two. And Cho is worse than us both.”
Draco jolted as he heard the screeching voice of Walburga echo off the walls around him, eyes going so wide you could see the whites around his pale grey irises and a hard shudder racking his body.
He sighed and came to a stop just outside the quidditch pitch. He’d been unable to actually cross the border onto the pitch or into the stadium, hadn’t even brought his broom or quidditch gear. “Too many memories.”
Harry hadn’t slept well. He’d spent most of the night tossing and turning, wondering who was writing to him.
Draco snorted, gaze glued to where Harry was touching his left forearm. “You know why I don’t call you Harry?” A bit stunned at the change, Harry should his head. “Because it lets you get close, and I’m terrified of that.”
Draco straightened, frowning. “Is that? No, no, it’s not. That’s not common practice, even in muggle families.” Harry’s face went hot, and he rolled his shoulders, eyes flickering to the left, a sure sign he wasn’t comfortable. Reaching out, Draco took his hand. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bring up something upsetting. I know you don’t have many good memories from them.”
Then, when Minerva reached out to ask him about his aptitude with potions and whether he wanted to pursue that, he began an apprenticeship under Slughorn.
The next morning, Draco awoke to Harry kissing him awake. “Wh’time’sit?”
Harry nodded. “And he’s blocked me from his wards. And he’s moved to Hogwarts already, so I can’t just go to his place. And I can’t just walk into Hogwarts without permission, but I don’t think McGonagall is going to take “I broke my boyfriend’s heart and need to fix it” as a good reason.”
Remus heard the break in Sirius’s voice and tugged him up into a hug. They’d talked about how hard Azkaban had been. How Sirius’s guilt had caused him to feel responsible for their friends’ deaths, for losing time with Remus. He’d accepted the sentencing because he didn’t think Remus or Harry would ever be able to forgive him for failing to protect James and Lily. However, his memories of them all and his hope that they were happy had been what kept him going. Both men still carried more guilt than either could truly vocalize.
Harry. He was still calling him Harry. That was a good sign. “Until the end, love. You’re a part of me, now.” Harry kissed along the back of his neck, smiling as he felt the other man drift into sleep.
Laughing harder, Harry bumped his shoulder into Draco’s as the entered the lift, it packed at this time so the ended up squeezed together to one side. “I won’t argue that. I’m keeping at least one coffee shop in business.”
Draco nodded. “A great aunt type of relation, but yes, they were related.” He grimaced and scrubbed his face. “I wish we’d be nicer to them all. Wish father hadn’t.” He paused and took a deep breath. “But I suppose there’s no way to change that. Just to be better now, right?”
Teddy squealed as he saw Grinch, darting over to look at the little owl, and Andromeda stepped in to give Harry a hug. “It’s not problem. It gives me some time to do a little last-minute shopping and wrapping.”
Harry’s smile somehow seemed to get bigger. “Gods, you’re perfect. You know that? Go see your parents. I’ve got some paperwork to finish up for work. I’ll see you tomorrow, though?”
. To want for himself, rather than hope he helped others survive.
“Let me get my broom. Would either of you mind if I asked the other potioneers? A few more are off, now.”
He flooed to his parents’ house for their regular lunch meeting. His mother and father were waiting as he exited the floo, looking as if they expected something between a riot and full-blown war. In fact, he’d not seen them look this serious since the end of the Second Wizarding War and their trials.
His head snapped up as heard Potter choke on a bite, but the other man wasn’t in trouble. He was laughing. “You? Potions Master and Snape’s favorite? Can’t mix things up following directions?”
He cleared his throat, weight shifting from one foot to another. “I hope I’m not interrupting.”
Draco had Boxing Day off, but he’d been at work until almost six am before someone pulled him away from the cauldron and sent him home. He’d slept most of his day off, only waking long enough to eat what was left of the Christmas dinner that Harry brought him before sleeping again until time to prepare for work once more. He was still smiling about his dinner with Harry when he arrived at work on December 27th.
“You don’t perchance mean my darling ex-girlfriend Pansy?” Draco turned up his nose and fanned himself with his napkin, lifting his voice to a screechy point. “I’m sure she’d be
“Yes, Harry, but you don’t need to thank me for this.” Draco’s arms wrapped around him, and he squeezed. Harry’s body relaxed, breathing starting to even out, and Draco squeezed again, clearing his throat. “This would be more comfortable…not on the roof…”
She nodded and moved to the side to let him pass. “If you decide you’re hungry later, please let the elves know.”
Draco’s fists clenched in the sheets, lower body lifting, and he whispered. “I’m yours to take.”
For the first time in a long time, Harry smiled for most of the morning, even sending Grinch over to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes to has Ron for lunch. The third snitch was there when he got back from that, and he spared a moment to wonder again how someone kept getting in and out of the locked office before unfurling the letter.
“Do we have too many ornaments on that side?” Draco started counting ornaments.
He stopped. Close himself off. Maybe he’d closed off too much. Closed out too many. Picking up the letter, he almost accio’d a quill to respond when he remembered Grinch was still in the office, a note left for the elves to please keep his food and water fresh as they took care of the office. The owl had looked up as Harry had prepared to leave the night before, but when Harry made no move to collect him, he’d hopped over to his tree without a sound.
Harry took Draco’s suddenly clammy hand and started toward the towering, oddly-stacked house. “Normally, we’d use Sirius’s flying bike. Molly hates it, but Arthur’s thrilled to pieces every time I bring it over.”
“Eloquent as always, Potter.”
With a groan, Harry dropped his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, losing his rhythm as he simply thrust until his own orgasm hit.
“Yes. Please.” Draco pulled him down for another kiss.
Harry flipped him off again, tucking the note into his pocket. “Yeah, if I tried, I’m sure I could.” He walked around his desk, motioning for Ron to sit, and reached for the string holding the package closed.
Draco froze the second Harry’s lips touched his, sure he must be dreaming. They did not just kiss in the middle of a crowded street like they did this all the time. Like it hadn’t upended Draco’s entire world. Like this wasn’t everything he’d known he didn’t deserve from the moment he realized how vile his family’s beliefs, the belief’s he spouted as fact, really were back in fourth year. “Amazing asshole?”
“So do you.” Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, body undulating. “Don’t stop.”
Sirius laughed and walked over to crouch in front of Harry, clapping him on the knee. “Look. We’ll figure out a way for you and him to see each other again. But you need to think about what you’re going to say.”
The response the day before had come back almost an hour after he’d sent his question. It had taken so long that he’d begun to worry the little owl was lost or that his admirer had deemed the whole thing suddenly too risky. Instead, right before lunch, Grinch had fluttered back in with another note.
Draco looked up, three other potioneers now in the room with him. “It’s. No. Potter.”
Once dinner finished, Harry asked if Draco wanted to go for a walk, so they ended up hand in hand in the enchanted gardens. With how late it was, there were only a few other couples and no reporters in sight. Deciding they wouldn’t be disturbed, neither man bothered with more privacy spells.
“Cool!”
A second brow joined the first, Malfoy’s lips lifting as he brows did. “That so? I’m in the midst of a project that I needed to check on.” He reached up to pet Grinch, gently rubbing the backs of his fingers over the little owl’s chest, his fingertips ghosting lightly over Harry’s cheek as he did. The little owl preened and fluffed, and Harry felt like he did the same, chills running down his arms at the brief touch, static filling his ears.
He shook his head, and Remus gently bopped him in the jaw with his book. “Padfoot. But?”
Harry grinned. “So, I can hold your hand after we arrive and stuff? Are you okay with that kind of PDA?”
Kissing him again, Harry pulled Draco to his feet, hands running down his chest and to his hips, pulling him close and then pushing him toward the stairs. “I did promise you a next time.”
Harry smiled and took a step forward. “So did Sirius and Remus. They all like you, Draco. Really like you. They didn’t fake any of it.”
“I wish.” Draco muttered.
As if on cue, the redhead in question barged through the door, apologizing for being a bit late, but he’d sent food home to Hermione. He stopped and looked from the broom to Harry then back, grinning, “Awww, mate, you shouldn’t have.”
Harry grinned over at Draco, squeezing his hand and leading him into the kitchen. Remus looked up and smiled at the two of them, gaze dropping to their hands then moving back up to their faces. “It’s good to see you two. I know how you take your tea, so I’m finishing up our cups, now. Feel free to take a seat with my whiney partner over there.”
“Yeah.”
Draco’s entire body began to shake, and the same cold that he used to feel when the Dark Lord lived with them invaded his bones. The same fear. He struggled for a few minutes to remember how to take in a full breath, swallowing several times, but he raised his chin. “It is. I—I think I’m in love with him.” Draco suppressed the want to cower from his father’s cold stare. Though he knew his father’s weaknesses, he still longed for his love, his approval.
owl didn’t hurt so much. No one was standing next to this owl and looking at Harry with expectant eyes, eyes that asked if he was ready to move on, move past, get over. For once, someone saw his pain, validated the hurt that still existed where his first real friend had lived, and said that pain was allowed to stay as long as he needed it to. That the memory of that first friend was allowed to stay.
Harry was careful to not push Draco too hard over the next few days, knowing his emotions would already be raw, but he also made sure to stop by his office whenever they both worked in order to say hello or invite him to dinner. Little by little, Draco relaxed again, gaining confidence in how much he was wanted.
Sirius coughed and scrubbed at his burning eyes, twisting his head to the side as he focused on keeping himself under control.
Long minutes later, their breathing calmed, and the spunk that coated their bodies and shirts had gone cold and seemed to be sticking them together. Draco sat up and stretched, satisfied smile on his face, and Harry licked a stripe up his throat, making him whimper.
Grinning, Harry nodded as the waitress left. “Bacon is the best breakfast food. It’s one of the few things I deign worthy of cooking without bitching.”
Harry and Draco made plans to meet up for breakfast again the next day so that Draco could try pancakes. They weren’t as good as waffles, but he did like them, and since they didn’t involve buying a new machine for his kitchen, he could start trying to make them at home.
“Oh, god, Harry. I can’t.” Draco’s head thrashed on the pillow, eyes squeezing shut as his body clamped down around Harry. “It’s too good. I can’t.”
Harry laughed, catching the tomato and popping it in his mouth. “Yeah, but I’m your prat.”
He wiped sweat from his brow as Potter approached him, grinning. “Okay. I know. Don’t rub it in.” He could see the laugh form inside Potter before it bubbled to the surface, and he found himself grinning back, even as he huffed and swatted the other man. “I said, don’t rub it in!”
The next Saturday, Draco got off work just as Harry was going to lunch. Harry smiled as he Draco poked his head into his office.
They linked arms and side-alonged to their assigned check point. The crowd went a bit quiet as they arrived, and Harry felt Draco stiffen. He grabbed his hand and smiled, “Come on. I want snacks.”
“For about five minutes, actually.” Ron laughed and handed him his takeout container. “You like this person, huh?” He cleared his throat. “You know, you can tell me, tell all of us, who it, who he, is. We won’t judge or anything.”
Sirius grimaced and sighed. “It’s a bit harder when you’re not sharing a dorm room, huh?”
Walking home, he realized it was probably politeness that led Potter to say such a thing and was, thus, unlikely to happen. It was nice, though. And he was still smiling.
Snorting, Draco shook his head. “I mean, I’m not Golden Boy, running about and saving us all.” Harry groaned and threw a bit of toast at Draco, making him laugh. “But I know that my family name has always stood for something, and I’d like it to stand for something good, now.” Draco sighed and shrugged. “I’d like to mean something good.” He flushed as Harry studied him. “I suppose it’s still part of the Auror job to keep an eye on me, though. Well, me, my family, and anyone else who’d been connected to V-Vo-V.” Stopping before the stutter could get worse, Draco cleared his throat. “Connected to that sort of evil.”
“They?” Draco’s voice was barely over a whisper because he knew it would crack and shatter if he tried to speak up. He found himself subconsciously moving toward Harry.
Molly ended up sending them home with cookies, part of the crisp, a loaf of bread, and another jumper for Draco. “I know Harry said the dark rose was your favorite color, but I think found this slate-colored yarn the other day and just knew it would work with your eyes. Besides, no one can have enough jumpers with the weather like it is.”
Harry laughed, running a hand through his hair. “Yeah, my bad. Come on, Dray.”
Draco’s jaw wobbled, and he nodded. “You did. And I didn’t want to push because I was afraid of what I might find out.”
Draco leaned into Harry. “She’d have made one hell of a Slytherin, you know.”
All those years, Harry had hated Draco for having what he didn’t, for having the parents and the house and the gifts. He’d seen how Lucius had bought brooms to get his son of the quidditch team, how Narcissa had sent treats every week. Comparing that to the Dursley’s denying Harry’s existence when it suited them and ignoring him the rest of the time, Malfoy seemed to have a charmed life. He supposed there was more than one way to make someone feel like a burden rather than a child, though.
“I don’t need you to. Probably don’t have time.” Draco smiled and kissed him lightly. “Especially if you brought me food.”
“Christmas tree delivery. We’re here to set it up in the front room, as requested.”
“Up-upstairs.” Draco yanked at Harry’s faded Canons t-shirt, pulling it over his head so that he could run his hands over his body, whimpering at the sight of tawny skin and defined muscled covered in a dusting of curled dark hair.
Harry laughed. “We could pick another day, if you’d like.”
“Hard earned or not, it makes you heavier than me.” Draco smirked, arching one brow. “And slower.”
Harry came with a groan, teeth clenching, imagining a long, pale throat between them, the hitch of breath he’d heard this morning when he reminded Draco to call him Harry. He wanted to hear that voice moan his name. Moan the word yours.
Her smile widened slightly, and she nodded. “You simply ask them to visit and give them your floo address. Just, don’t let them run too wild around campus once students are here.”
He stepped inside and hung his robes, turning to greet the menace in question, when he noticed a long, thin wrapped package. A suspiciously broom shaped package.
“Why would I want to include Wilkes? His father was…I mean.”
Ginny grinned and bellowed, “We have an announcement. We’ve had a baby.”
Draco laughed and pushed him back. “No being late tonight. I don’t give a damn if you annoy Robards.”
Harry sat on the edge of the desk as he skimmed the short note again. His Firebolt had been a Christmas gift from his godfather, so to have another broom at this time of year turned something over deep in his belly. And to be opening it with Ron again, as he’d be there any minute. Harry laughed, remembering how Ron had been almost more excited than he over than Firebolt.
Harry nodded, knowing his godfather was right.
Draco preened under the praise. “We did a lot of rotten shit, but we looked good doing it. No one fails spectacularly with quite as much style as a Malfoy.”
Some emotion Draco couldn’t understand passed over Harry’s face, and his wand clattered the floor before he hauled the other man into a kiss.
Harry blushed, portioning out pie for everyone, realizing he’d left the four vases and whatever note came along on the table that morning, having forgotten them completely during the day’s events. “They. Um. A friend?”
Harry looked at Draco. “He’s right. It’s just slabs of cookie.”
Harry watched the red of Draco’s cheeks deepen as he smiled and hugged the little boy. “I, uh, I mean, if you’re sure?”
With that in mind, he opened his office door, stripped his outer robes and hung them neatly on their hook, then spelled away the cold water clinging to his trouser legs, straightening the charcoal grey slacks as he did. He didn’t notice the owl on his desk until it gave a tiny “whoo.”
Draco nodded, shuddering again, voice hoarse as he choked out. “She used to say that, too. That I was only good for target practice. Before hitting me with a Crucio. I had to learn to stay on guard at all times. If she was in the house, I wasn’t safe.”
Draco scoffed and shoved Harry back. While neither man was particularly tall, Seekers were supposed to small, Draco did have almost two inches on Harry, so he was able to sneer down his nose. “I’d be more worried about you keeping up with me, what with all the weight you’ve put on.”
He attached the note to Grinch and sent him off then changed from his Auror robes to his regular coat and went in search of Draco.
Groaning, Harry shifted the two of them farther back on the bed and lifted Draco’s feet to rest on his shoulders, pushing his legs back enough to expose his tightly furled hole. Draco shifted, whining softly in confusion before giving a shout of shock and pleasure as Harry ran his tongue up the hidden cleft to mouth at the sensitive area below Draco’s balls then wrap his lips around one, sucking. Repeating the action but teasing the other ball, Harry hummed around the heavy sac. He released it, murmured a cleaning charm, then lowered his head again, running his tongue around the pale rim of Draco’s hole. Alternating between sucking and licking, he slowly worked Draco open enough to thrust his tongue inside. Draco’s toes curled, digging into Harry’s shoulders, and he reached down to sink a hand into Harry’s thick curls, tugging him closer as he babbled a stream of
Face pink, Draco bit his lip, smiled, and nodded.
Those ideas were still there that night, and his head thrashed against the pillow as his mind conjured faceless images of men on brooms, wondering what position they’d play, only to have the double entendre of that leave him groaning and digging his fingers into the sheets beneath him. He finally fell asleep to whispers of
“Whatever our feelings on Draco’s past, we love Harry. We should trust and support him enough to at least give this a shot.”
Draco bit back another whimper, writhing. “Am I supposed to be quieter?”
Andromeda laughed. “I’ll leave you boys to it. Have a good day.” She kissed Teddy’s head, hugged Draco, and left.
Draco gasped and laughed, recognizing the joke. “Now, who’s the punk?” He grinned and collected his cup, going to explore Harry’s house, realizing he hadn’t seen much before the entrance and upstairs. Sipping his tea, he circled the living room, looking at the various photos Harry had hanging up: him with Hermione and Ron, him and the Weasley family, with Remus and Sirius, playing quidditch with their regular group. Draco found himself imagining a picture of the two of them joining the rest of these walls, thought he’d like such a picture on his own.
“Harry.” Sliding his hand down, he squeezed Draco’s ass. “Say my name, Draco.”
Teddy shook his head, speaking around a mouthful of greasy potatoes. “No, we bought your gift, too. And for Aunt Cissy.”
“And we repair a Walburga-free wall.” Harry tugged Draco into a kiss. “It’s sexy when you’re smarter than me.”
“Oh wow. This is really good. How did you manage to sit through my food?”
“How do I apologize to someone who doesn’t want to speak to me anymore?”
The morning after their date, Draco awoke curled on his side and snuggled against Harry’s chest, head tucked under the other man’s chin as he lay spread eagle on his back. Draco shifted, not sure what time it was or if they needed to be up. Harry made a soft noise in his sleep, arms wrapping tighter around the blond. Smiling, Draco nestled closer, letting himself drift back off to sleep. Life could wait a while longer.
Draco set the bag down and followed Harry to the kitchen to pour them each a glass of the crisp liquid. “What are we having?”
Harry snorted and kissed his cheek. “Prat.”
and I did that.”
“I expected more of me, too.” Draco sighed, and shook his head. “I suppose I’ll need to practice, since I’m playing against you in pick-up games.”
Remus just grinned. “Because I’ve spent years keeping your dumb ass alive.”
Jabbing his wand at his hair, he put it back up in the pompadour, mussing a few pieces up around the front. “Middle ground. I can find middle ground.” His wards shivered and a knock came at the door, making his jump and yelp. Hands shaking, he walked over to open the door.
Draco nodded. “Not ‘til later, though.”
Eventually, he sat on the couch and noticed that there were papers and quills strewn across the coffee table. He remembered that Harry had mentioned having paperwork for his job to do the night before, and, not wanting to pry, Draco started to move a file folder to cover the papers. Until he noticed that several of the pages had his name on them.
“I recall you thinking you needed wood to make a fire.”
Harry nodded, lifting his hand and kissing his fingers. “No problem. I’ll ask tomorrow, set up a day.”
Draco looped his arms around Harry’s neck, lips parting for the press of the other man’s tongue as he was pressed back into the wall. Moaning, he arched, legs parting to let Harry slot himself between his thighs again. On another moan, Draco lifted up onto his tip toes and pressed his hips forward to meet the thrust of Harry’s.
Harry’s head snapped around, but he kept his hold on Draco when the other man tried to jerk away. Teddy stood in the door, fidgeting.  “Yeah, kiddo. It should be done. Did you wash your hands?” He nodded, and Harry released one of Draco’s arms, letting the other linger long enough to squeeze lightly. “Great. You and Draco go ahead and sit then. I’ll get it out and refill our glasses.”
Harry laughed, asking about Draco’s day, what was planned. He wasn’t due in for another couple hours, but that would give him time to go home, shower, and change.
“Just be sure Master is home for lunch.”
“You want to be loved first.” Draco tensed, but Harry just held him tighter. “I get that. Caring about someone, knowing they care about you. It does make a difference, and I can wait.”
“Harry. And I told you to take the day off.” Draco spluttered, but Harry just kissed his cheek again. “We’ll come help decorate the house once we’ve got all this up. Kreatcher can help you find things, if you need.”
“Tomorrow, you’ll be at the Burrow, right?”
Harry dropped into one of the leather armchairs in Sirius and Remus’s sitting room. “I fucked up. I didn’t think of him as the case. He’s just Draco, has been since the second time we talked. I didn’t think...” Harry’s voice broke on a sob, and he hung his head. “God, I fucked up.”
“I hate to vent. I mean, it’s your day off. Why ruin it with work?”
“I love you.” Harry pulled Draco close, kissing him briefly. “God, I’m so in love with you. And I’m so sorry. I’ll never do anything like this again. I swear.”
Blushing, Harry shrugged. “I figured we ought to be officially dating before I gave you a gold ring.” He ducked, looking up at Draco through his fringe. “Next time?”
As it became known that he had honestly changed and was truly trying to help, he’d been contacted by his cousin, Sirius Black, and the two championed the fight for werewolves to be treated as equals, arguing that their mistreatment and lack of resources was often what caused them to engage in crime. St. Mungo’s now housed the RJ Lupin Ward, where lycanthropes could go to get Wolfsbane and rest safely during the full moons. It was also working toward more innovation in potions to help with management of the condition.
“I don’t.” She flushed, laughing. “Well, I mostly don’t. But you were together for a while, or she at least liked you for a while, and you’ve known each other so long and all.” She sighed, “And I realized I loved her. I guess I’m afraid that having something this good will get taken away, like…like, before.”
Harry sighed and made a face. “I sent her an owl just in case.” His head dropped back onto the chair. “She said it was up to Draco.” He scowled, grumbling, “Though she called him ‘Professor Malfoy.’ Like that’s all he was to me.”
“Eat together?”
Harry nodded, relaxing back into Draco’s touch. “I understand. And I’ll do whatever you need, whatever we need.”
“Don’t be sorry.” Draco sighed. “I mean, I can tell them. If you want me to.”
“It’s one thing to apologize for this situation, for not telling him you’d be assigned to a case about him and ending that case before fucking him.”
Draco whined. “Really? I never get it right. It’s always too chewy or too crunchy.”
Draco shook his head, grinning back. “Rotter. Dinner sounds lovely. When should I be there?”
Harry nodded, pressing their lips together once more. “Thank you.” Grinning, Harry backed out of the room and headed for the lift, floo’ing to Andromeda’s house.
The owl hooted and flew a circle around the office, reminding him of Pigwidgeon back when he first arrived. Harry smiled without meaning to and opened the letter, spelling it to its correct size and adjust the thing metal frames on his face.
“Honestly, I think he just knows you’re far more intimidating that any of the rest of us.”
Ducking, Draco flushed. “I’m still afraid that I’m Draco Malfoy.”
A few days after accepting his position at Hogwarts, Draco sat at the small Indian restaurant down the street from his flat. It was owned and run by muggles, but that meant he didn’t have to worry about anyone spitting in his food or on him. Though he’d worked hard to rebuild his reputation and the expectations of his family, apparently, it took more than seven years to repair generations of damage. He might not like it, but he understood. The bell over the door jingled, and he looked up to see an all-too-familiar mess of black hair enter. Before he could figure out how to hide under is table without being obvious, Potter was at his table, smiling.
They were kissing again when they landed in Harry’s bedroom, and Harry backed Draco into the bed, both tumbling over onto the large bed. Draco whimpered and arched, gasping as Harry’s mouth broke from his to trail down his jaw and throat.
Draco swallowed hard, the pupils of his eyes dilating until the black almost took over the grey. “Yes.”
“Why not together? Have dinner? With your godfathers? Together.”
“Fuck, your sounds.”
Sirius nodded, still sick just thinking about how close the boy had come to dying, then. And so many other times. “I know.”
“Well…” The wrapping fell from the broom, and Harry lost his train of thought. It was a Firebolt 6000. The newest model. The one that didn’t come out for another six months. And emblazed on the handle in gold script was H. Potter with the R turning into a phoenix.
