Hermione made a beeline towards the pungent aroma of tomato soup as soon as they entered. Draco settled down on one of the stools by the table in the middle, grabbing the first thing he could get his hands on—a large banana muffin—and bit into it.
"Can't you just show them your pass?" he asked as he stuck his hand out from under the canopy and felt the cold drops splatter against his palm.
the paranoid part of him questioned.
"Wouldn't it be faster if we simply make an announcement?" Draco asked, directing his question at Astoria, noting that the wizard looked chagrined at having been dismissed rather rudely but not having the patience to feel apologetic over it.
"Why're you being so pig-headed about this?"
"While dreams and nightmares are essentially figments of our subconscious minds," Malfoy began in the same professional tone of voice, "dreams are mostly disjointed images and scenes created from emotions we have felt and things we have experienced previously. Not all dreams have much significance to a person's routine, daily life as they occur normally during the REM cycle whether the person is aware of it or not. Most often than not, many people don't remember their dreams, but for light sleepers or people who sleep restlessly, or if one were to awaken while they were dreaming, they may momentarily retain the memory of their dream.
now behaved like they were the best of friends (which may have been a slight exaggeration, but still). Of course, that made Draco think no end of himself and fed his ego greatly, but it was also awkward because Harry seemed to spend quite a lot of his free time with Draco than his
"Well, that was a shitshow," Draco commented, eyeing Harry.
"Thanks, Dad!" James cried as he pranced around the cycle, and Lily looked on, wide-eyed.
Mr Hussain turned out to be a burly wizard of Arabic descent, who used to be a Beater in some small-town European Quidditch team Harry hadn't heard of, before he decided to follow his family's legacy and came to England in search of a job that would need his services. He was a very jovial, easy-going man, and his friendly demeanour had helped Harry out of his initial embarrassment at receiving a full-body massage from another male.
"Oh, I absolutely do not support your decision, let me make that very clear," Kingsley said with the same familiar glint in his eye. "But I don't intend to stop you, either. Robards has been assigned to handle the whole operation, and he shall recommend you to be placed at the top of it, so until then, sit tight and don't jump the gun."
"Why you're being slow on the uptake." Buxley glanced sideways and hollered for one of his men. When the fellow arrived, he said, "Mason, go 'round the corner and buy one of those large, Muggle cheeseburgers. Here, take this."
As they reached the little carts, the goblin motioned to one and said, "Get in, please." Harry stepped in and barely had time to clutch the handlebars tight before the cart zoomed off down the winding tracks and finally halted abruptly before a vault.
"Ron!" Granger snapped, slapping him on the arm.
"But we're going to
Ron shrugged. "You don't have to enrol your kids there. Just talk to Audrey. I'm sure she can help."
"Are you the Head Auror?" she asked, breaking him out of his thoughts.
"Alright, you lot. Get ready," he called as the boat began to manoeuvre into the narrow jetty. There was scrambling as a set of Aurors climbed onto the deck in order to help moor the boat. The vessel groaned as ten-foot tall waves crashed against it, and he swore as there were several shouts followed by splashes.
"Hermione, relax, for Merlin's sake," he said as he scribbled on a memo and carefully folded it into an aeroplane. Once he was satisfied with it, he let it flutter for a bit as he opened the door and watched it zoom off.
Her dark eyes twinkled with mirth, and Harry felt himself relax. Although he was glad to have helped an innocent man, he would've hated if it had been at a cost of a friendship. Besides, Padma was one of the most resourceful people he knew, and a valuable asset to have.
Harry placed his cup down and held his hands up. "I know, and I apologise if I've offended you, but I really just thought it would help…" he trailed off, motioning between them again.
“Call me Harry. Just Harry.”
"Did they get bad again?" She glanced around before leaning forwards and whispering, "Your nightmares?"
Kingsley's eye twitched, his mouth downturned in the slightest, and Harry knew it was because of his tone of voice, but he continued to hold steady eye contact. If there was one thing he'd learnt from working with Kingsley for all these years, it was that the wizard greatly trusted those who stood up to him to a certain level and held their own ground. As intimidating as Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt was, Harry still knew that the wizard depended on a lot of people to help him hold the fort.
"Step One?" Harry asked, staring at the bold lettering.
"This is why I didn't want you to see this."
calls you Little Lou."
"So, have you told her yet?"
"I hope you know what you're doing." Kingsley's eyes had a familiar, knowing glint in them.
The blond sat up a little straighter at that, and Harry continued. "Will it be alright if I were to come along, too?" When Malfoy's eyes widened in the slightest, Harry quickly said, "Just to see who ends up with the vase. I mean, I don't want just anybody to get it, you know?"
"Not really," Harry responds, sounding oddly dismissive. "I'm rather selfish, if I say so myself. I just do what I want to do and impose that on other people. Like I did and am still doing with you." He gestures to the spread before us.
"Don't start with that, Harry. You know I have to work."
A disembodied voice announced the lift's arrival, and she stepped in, barely waiting for him to enter before shutting the doors and clicking on the button marked G. She continued to stare at the door and ignored his existence.
Malfoy began to apply pressure as he said, "Tell me when to stop," gradually increasing it until Harry said, "Stop" in a hoarse voice.
"Mobile phones?" Harry and Hermione said together, sharing a look.
Harry grunted. "Tough day at work."
He holds up a rather large picnic basket that I hadn't noticed in my nervousness and grins. "Would you care to join me for a quick dinner? So I can make it up to you for the other night?"
Dominique raised her eyebrows and crossed her arms, and Louis seemed to instantly realise his mistake. He opened his mouth, making to say something, but his sister beat him to it.
He hadn't really planned on it, but he was glad that his day-off was turning out to be more productive than he had expected. Like Buxley had said, he wanted to get stuff over with as and when he could, and not push them off for later, because, knowing his profession, tomorrow would never come. He either got things done every free moment he had, or they would just pile on until they cascaded down on him and crushed him under their weight (something he had come to learn from experience).
"Leeky is bringing coffee for masters with breakfast."
Malfoy nodded again. "Do you think you can recollect any of them? Perhaps some aspects, if not the entire thing? Only if you feel like you'd be able to or want to; this is a safe space and I want you to feel comfortable and not threatened in any way."
"Of course not."
"Kids, dinner!" he called as he Levitated the plates over to the table, smiling as the trio raced into the room, exclaiming happily.
"Maybe I will…"
"Well, that's not enough, is it?" Draco yelled, his voice trembling, and jumped to his feet. He grabbed Harry by the arms and shook him. "My son has been kidnapped, Potter! My little boy! Yet you're telling me your best effort hasn't been able to find him!"
"Are you a bad dad?"
"I'm not
There was some sort of commotion coming from inside as he walked past, and he paused out of curiosity. The owner of the bakery—a short, plump, balding, middle-aged Muggle—seemed to be in a right state. He was bellowing at the top of his lungs as he came around the counter, a rolling pin brandished in one hand. Harry frowned, wondering what had happened, when something small barrelled into him, nearly toppling him over.
Hughes looked up and nodded at Harry as he pulled off the goggles he was wearing and held them out to him. "You might wanna take a look at this."
Malfoy nodded again, opting to remain silent and allowing Harry to talk. Was this how all of their sessions were going to be like? With him just saying whatever he pleased, and Malfoy just patiently listening except for when there was a need for him to respond?
"Potter, Potter!" someone kept calling through the cacophony, sounding worried, and he tried to focus on what was in front of him.
the one that asked him to be friends," Harry said, coming to stand beside Draco and holding an arm out in front of him protectively. "Don't take it out on him; he has nothing to do with anything."
"Whadya mean
"It does."
What alarmed Harry the most, however, was the final line that contained Draco's name in it. It was about how Harry had testified on the Malfoys' behalf in their trial, helping them avoid being sentenced to Azkaban, and this was highlighted multiple times, so vigorously that the page had ripped.
"Oh, Harry," Ginny said, her eyes full of pity, and he instantly felt a fire light up in the pit of his stomach.
Draco folded the piece of parchment he’d jotted down some notes on that morning and placed it in the pocket of his Potions Master overalls. Pushing back the flaps of plastic hanging over the potions room, he made his way to the front of the small store.
Harry cleared his throat and dropped his gaze to stare at his teacup as he said, "Well, the truth is that one of the main reasons for my stress over the past week is the fact that my wife is out of town."
"You made it through just fine."
"That would be fantastic, thanks." He clapped the man on the shoulder. "Tell the rest of the squad that if they stay overtime, lunch is on me tomorrow," he called as he made his way out of the Auror Office and towards the DMLE's head office.
"Yeah?"
Harry nodded. "That's all the reassurance I need, thanks."
Hermione huffed and said, "Yeah, but you forget that you don't
"Yay!" Lily exclaimed as she came around the counter and hugged him. "I'll tell Al and Jamie!"
"Why's that?"
"Got them right here." Harry held up a stack of paperwork. "How's your new post treating you, Rogers?"
Seeing stars, he sighed and fell back, placing an arm over his eyes and wallowing in his epic failure. When he tried to move, his other arm was assaulted by a shock of numbness, and he was on pins and needles, grimacing at the odd sensation in his limbs as he waited for the feeling to pass.
Harry sat up and rubbed his face, feeling cold and empty. This nightmare hadn't had the same impact as the most recent ones, but none of them had left him feeling as emotionally, physically and mentally drained as this one. He felt as if his very life was slowly seeping out of him. He could feel the familiar tug of hunger in his stomach; it reminded him of not having enough food, and it took him all of his willpower to keep from being sick.
Harry looked up to see Audrey make a beeline towards the table he was sitting at, and he rose to his feet just as she reached him.
"I haven't been
"Thanks." Harry smiled as he settled down at the counter and poured himself some coffee from the pot.
She laughed airily and almost skipped around the counter, kissing him again and all but running out of the room with a hurried, "I absolutely
"Why don't you just connect it to the house?" Scorpius asked for the hundredth time, as his mother still did every chance she got, even in a tone of voice so similar to hers that it was undeniable Scorpius was his mother's son.
Harry tried to placate the man. "Camberwick Green is a fictional town from a Muggle children's show," he explained. "It's also the location that every other person who disappeared via Floo over the past several weeks was traced to."
"What could have happened to him?" she asked, wringing her hands. "If he really left before you, how did he not arrive before you did?"
"Yes, well, it turns out that there exists something similar between a journalist and her interviewee."
Dad! You know I've been waiting all year for this!"
Harry nodded slowly. "I suppose that makes sense. So my nightmares weren't sudden, but what caused them to return?"
to say he would turn himself in because he failed to protect my parents,
"I prefer it that way," Kingsley replied, motioning for Harry to step into the empty lift. "So, Robards has reassured me that everything is going according to plan and that the DMLE's top brass have high expectations for you."
Harry nodded in understanding.
She finally glanced up at him and smiled, although it seemed forced and didn't reach her eyes. "I was informed that you had overdosed on a potent Calming Draught and Draco had found you sprawled on the floor of his office, so it's perhaps wiser for me to assist you in Apparating someplace safe? It's faster this way. The Floos are usually packed at this time of day."
"What's going on? I thought something happened."
I stare at him, unsure of how to respond to this piece of information that was unlike everything I imagined the man to be. Harry runs a hand through his hair and chuckles at my befuddled expression. "You're probably thinking I'm a half-wit, and you're not wrong. But…I don't know. I guess I just wanted to exhaust all avenues from my end so that even if it didn't work out, at least I wouldn't regret not having done enough. You know?"
"Oh," was Neville's reply and Harry pinched the bridge of his nose as he motioned for the other man to take a seat.
"Yeah, we did," Harry admitted, although he didn't really feel like letting it go. He still didn't know why exactly she'd lied about it. "But I want to make sure that there isn't something you're keeping from me, Ginny."
Once all of his men were piled into the black, Muggle van, whose interiors were magically expanded to fit them all in, Harry opened the passenger door and helped Lisa in. He climbed in after her and shared a look with Buxley, who was driving, and they set off.
"Oh, you're back early!" Hermione exclaimed, surprising Harry as he stepped out of the Floo.
She had a thoughtful expression on her face and finally nodded. "I suppose you're right. She
"What in heaven's name is all this stuff?" Hermione exclaimed, helping to extricate Ron from under the bags.
Ron grinned, and Harry shook his head, a sense of awe settling over him. He'd missed this. The way Ron was able to give clarity to things that Harry would complicate for no reason through his simplistic ways of thinking. That was one of Ron's greatest gifts. It had saved both Harry and Hermione countless times before and would, countless times more, Harry was sure.
"You can count on that," Harry called after the man as he flopped down on his chair.
"I couldn't see, so… sorry," he said sheepishly, and she gave him a weird look.
"Please, call me Camilla—or Cam, whichever you prefer. If we're going to do this, we need to break away the formality as much as possible."
"Not at all. In fact, you came at the right time. There's barely a handful over today, so it's not very busy."
"A note."
"What can I do for you?" he asked, crossing his legs and clasping his hands before him. "And if this is going to be like another one of Weasley's pointless tirades, then I suggest you quit while you're ahead."
"All good; sorry 'bout that!"
He glanced through the notes he'd added in after his meeting with Padma, replaying the most important details over and over again in his head.
Images of his childhood before Hogwarts flashed through his mind, but now it was all much worse because his past self had juxtaposed over the boy he had seen, and coupled with the nightmare… he shuddered, feeling shaken up.
"Well, since I ditched work today, I might be later than usual. Is that alright?"
Harry bit back a sigh and forced a smile on to his face. "Miss Barkridge—"
She watched as he fell to the side, eyes wide, and reached out with her foot to nudge his cheek. "Disgusting," she said with a sigh.
There had been a point that day when he had realised that it was all real and was actually happening to him. For a moment, he had wished he'd told Ginny about his nightmares. He yearned for her company, and he just needed to know that she was somewhere close by and not halfway across the country. He wanted to come clean to her so badly, to tell her everything he was going through, and just have her wrap her arms around him and tell him it was all going to be OK and that she'd always be there for him like she had countless times before.
The blond scrunched his nose. "I told her I was all out. She's proposing to her girlfriend this evening, though, so I offered to make a bouquet with a bunch of other flowers," he said, walking around the counter to pick the flowers.
Harry gawked. So
Harry stared at his feet as he slowly let that thought settle in his mind.
"Must you be so gruesome in your means of getting rid of hindrances?"
"Well," Hermione said as she hugged Lily and motioned towards her husband, "as much as Ron and I would like to spend the evening here, we promised Arthur and Molly we'd have dinner with them, so…"
"I won!" seven-year-old James yelled, propping himself atop Harry's shoulders.
The floor was covered in a soft, fur-like carpet that was cream-coloured with large, beige circles decorating it. All the furniture was made from the same dark mahogany as the panelling and furniture he'd seen in the lobby, with intricately carved designs that he couldn't quite make out unless he had his face inches from it. Light-coloured wallpaper covered whatever wall was visible, with delicate patterns on it, and wall-length bookshelves stood to his left. To his right was a large desk, behind which were wide, glass windows, the only source of natural light in the room.
"That makes no—"
"My father is different. He's a wizard; magic runs strong through his veins, which is why he is able to live in this realm." He flicked his wrist, and the air seemed to contort around his hand. "I'm sure you've sensed it too; the air here, it is alive with magic. Only those with a strong affinity can survive it."
"And what am I doing here? Having a gala of a time with my girlfriends, is it?"
"To eat. Your treat."
He sat there, stroking her hair and humming softly, till Ginny bustled into the room, the boys following close behind. It took her a moment to notice him and Lily because she was busy rummaging in her bag and relaying instructions to their sons, but when she did, her eyes widened and a somewhat pained expression crossed her face.
"Neither do I," Harry replied with a grin, and Draco rolled his eyes and looked away.
"It's good to see you in high spirits, Malfoy," Potter said with a resigned smile before walking away, leaving Draco feeling like
you thought that me being your healer could be beneficial to the both of us?"
"The original was found in Mr Malfoy's fireplace. This one's a duplicate we made before the forensics team took the other one."
He pursed his lips and asked Buxley to hold the line as he turned to Malfoy and Camilla. "Actually, do you mind if I take a rain check on our next meeting?"
Harry brought his face close, wrapping his arms around the blond's waist. "Don't you see what that means?"
"He will do no such thing!" Molly called as she bustled into the living room, several plates holding large pieces of tart floating after her. "Now, who wants tart?"
Harry nodded, impressed by the level of diligence. "So I just sign here?"
His patience drawing thin, Draco decided that he would save the man the trouble of firing him—and salvage what little pride he had left—and pulled off his overalls. Throwing it on the floor, more for show than as an act of defiance, he said, “Seeing as how we’ve reached the point of no-return, I may as well remind you that your decrepit old shop only survived this long thanks to me.” Satisfied when the man’s face went red and he spluttered in anger, Draco looked down his nose and shot him a contemptuous smile. “I shall see myself out, then. Good day, Mr Palmer.”
"Ginny, you said you wanted to put them in a school, and I found a really good one. I'm not saying we've to enrol them there, but Audrey works there, and I spoke to one of the parents whose kid goes there, and he recommended it, too—"
"Are you here to take me away?"
His stomach lurched at that, and he inhaled, leaning back against the wall as he tried to suppress a headache that began to throb through his temples. Ginny was telling Angelina she hadn't found a missed call on the phone's call log, and Angelina was saying maybe she had called the landline connection by accident. Harry still hadn't thought the previous night's events through, and right now, with his hangover, he wasn't about to.
Harry grabbed it first and placed it on the ground beside his feet. "Everyone knows Rabastan Lestrange was far less dangerous than his brother—especially after those first fourteen years."
"Ginny is going to
"Hey, Al, how about you and I go flying? You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Camilla sighed softly as she stood, shot Harry a smile, and touched his shoulder as she walked past.
"Is that right?" Deciding that he might have him mistaken for someone else, Harry asked, "Do you think your uncle will be long?"
They watched Ginny wrap her arms around Harry's neck and swing around him, and then looked back at each other. "So glad," Hermione said seriously, and Draco couldn't help but laugh.
"Yeah," Harry replied breathlessly, shaking his head in awe. "There're so many things I want to ask you but I suppose they'll have to wait until later."
Harry sighed as he watched the sniffling brunette seated before him and wondered if she was being scatter-brained on purpose.
For a moment, nothing happened, and he was about to say the spell again when a box flew straight at him, hitting him in the gut and sending him sprawling across the floor. He groaned as he pulled himself up and dusted his clothes. Muttering about cookbooks and better control over spells, he'd just started down the stairs when there was a creak behind him.
"Why? Because you're
courtesy of Mrs Weasley."
He spun on his heel and stalked away, leaving Granger looking from one to the other with a torn look. Harry sighed and waved his hand for her to go after Weasley, and Granger gave him a quick hug before running after her boyfriend.
Harry took the file and flipped it open, frowning when he saw that it was a missing persons report—that had only just been filed—his eyebrows shooting up when he saw the name at the top.
Harry glanced towards where Ginny was laughing at something George was saying. He caught her eye, and when she smiled, he looked away, as though he was guilty of knowing something he shouldn't have known. He turned to Angelina and gave her a small smile.
Harry grinned, wondering what Ron's reaction would be if he knew that the other person was Malfoy.
Lily placed her hands on the edge of the table and got on her tiptoes, eyeing the bundle curiously. "What is it?" she asked, fidgeting when he didn't seem like he would open it anytime soon.
"I know," he said softly as she ran her hands through his hair. "But no more surprises for a while, OK?"
I give you
"Harry?"
Harry cut him off by slapping a palm to his mouth and pushed him down. Straddling him, Harry grinned and waggled his eyebrows. “Wanna see how well you do against a seasoned Auror in a wrestling match?” He punched the air with his fists. “Come on, pretty boy.”
"Oh, there's no need to be formal," Audrey said with the wave of her hand. "We're family, after all. So, when would you want to meet? There's no hurry, of course; we can wait until Ginny gets back. I just want to know so I can get started on the list."
when you're talking about yourself."
Potter's eyes widened. "You forgive me?"
"Yeah, she is. She's leaving today, actually. I'm hoping I can get back early to see her off." Harry nodded to Buxley as they left the office, and the man shot Neville a look before nodding back.
His frown deepened, and he had a flashback to the countless arguments they'd had over pre-schools and where to enrol the kids. He started to feel a headache settle behind his temples and he closed his eyes.
"Still going to be
There was a pause, and Harry bit back a sigh as he continued to bounce his leg. Somehow he was feeling really agitated and the more he tried to calm himself, the more he wanted to snap at someone.
"Why did you?"
"For you, anytime," she replied as she opened the pouch. "Well, I managed to connect the fireplace in the office to the Burrow, so I'll be off, then."
"Hey, Gin. Are you busy?"
"Well, I wouldn't want to delay you." Kingsley nodded at the two of them before glancing Harry's way. "Walk with me, Harry?"
"Yeah, yeah," Draco said, rising to his feet again. "I need to finish an essay, so I can't waste any more time with the likes of you."
being such a pain in the arse about this?" There was a
As I focus on the rhythmic clicking sounds of the heel of my brand new Oxfords against the vinyl floor, willing the bus to move faster, I belatedly register the blur of green passing by through the opposite window. It takes me a few seconds to realise that the bus isn't taking the city route, and I stiffen, inhaling sharply, unwilling to accept that my tardiness had caused to me to board the wrong bus.
"Why are you telling me this?" he asked softly.
Harry shot Buxley a pointed look. "And you making comments like that won't help my case, either."
"Did you manage to eat before Apparating here?" Malfoy asked suddenly, and Harry looked at him with a weird expression.
"You're doing that thing where you interrogate me about every single word I say."
She didn't reply, and he was left to his own thoughts.
He swore loudly and flicked his wand, casting an Imperturbable Charm on the door. "Try and be a little louder, why don't you," he said as he flopped down in his chair.
Draco grabbed her and pulled her to the side, looking around to ensure they weren't in the Aurors' way before turning back to his hysterical ex-wife. "Astoria, I have been here, staring at these horrible messages all night trying to see if I can think of something useful that could help us find Scorpius. I know I didn't do my job as his father, I know I didn't keep him safe, and I'm sorry I broke my promise to you, but I'm doing everything in my power to find him, and I can't have you here right now."
Kingsley shook his head. "There's no need for that. Robards has already got it covered."
Despite the fact that he and Astoria had chosen to separate due to irreconcilable differences, she was a loving but firm mother, a caring—even if often overbearing—wife, and a fiercely independent and talented witch with a brilliant mind. Draco wasn't prideful enough to deny the fact that she had been the much-needed pillar of support to his family during the difficult years after the war—and even later on, when his mother had fallen ill and passed away so unexpectedly that it had sent him and his father spiraling.
Harry bowed his head. "We haven't found conclusive evidence yet, so we're trying not to jump to conclusions, but," he paused, glancing between her and Malfoy, "we have reason to believe that they may all be connected, due to how soon after the previous abduction your son's disappearance has taken place, as well as the similar m.o."
"Five."
"Alright, fantastic, I'll just go take a shower and then we can leave," Harry said and began to walk away when Angelina came up to him.
Harry sighed. "I'll take a look at it when we get back. Anyway, your lads found something far more interesting."
He grabbed his coat and walked out the door, a confused Draco following behind him as he asked, "Where're we going?"
"Do you live on spinal reflexes alone?" Draco demanded, still stunned. "Do you not
"I see you're helping yourself," he said as he snatched the letter from the table before Pig could reach it, and the owl snapped its beak at him. Pig stared at him for a moment longer before turning back to the snacks. Harry snorted as he opened the envelope and pulled out the crisp, neatly folded sheet of parchment.
Mr Simpson rushed up to them just then, standing a little away awkwardly until they separated and acknowledged him. "We're looking everywhere, but he doesn't seem to be on the premises."
"Harry, stop. I'm fine," Hermione said as they knelt down and picked up the parchment she'd dropped.
"Er," Harry said, suddenly feeling awkward. "Well, I didn't get any nightmares last night thanks to the massage, so…"
"You seem to be starting your day on an awfully strong note," Harry commented as Neville took several gulps before putting down his drink with a grimace.
"If it isn't too inconvenient," Harry replied as he grabbed a fistful of the shimmering, green powder and ducked under the mantle. "Thanks again."
"Are you a kidnapper?" the boy asked, frowning.
"Oh, I was wondering when you'd drop by!" Molly gushed, pulling him into a tight hug and calling to Lily. "Lily, sweetheart, your daddy's here!"
"And that's when I realised," she said in a voiced choked with laughter, continuing her story like she had just stopped a moment ago, "that you were just like me. Except you had to put on a brave face and pretend like you could carry the weight of the world on your frail shoulders while I could stand in the shadows and pretend like my petty problems were greater than everything you had to bear."
"Oh, you know how it is. Work, work, work." She waved a hand but didn't seem like she was complaining. She turned to him and smiled. "What about you? I heard Ginny's covering the tournament."
"Hermione, everything is absolutely wonderful, and besides, weren't you the one that said we shouldn't think about depressing things and have fun?"
," Albus finally said, pointing a finger towards the back garden, and Lily ran to the kitchen door and peered out.
take after her mother, after all."
His little redhead looked like she'd been crying. She held her arms out to him, and Harry took her from Ron, cradling her against his chest. She nestled her head in the crook of his neck, and he was startled by how hot her forehead was.
The child stared up at him, blue eyes conflicted, and said, "But what if I'm hungry?"
Harry laughed, embarrassed, not really knowing what he did to leave such a lasting impression on these men in their brief meeting. Just as they rose to their feet, an Auror came bursting in, a panicked expression on his face.
Potter pursed his lips. He gave Draco a long, intense look that almost made Draco fold, and said, “To put it simply, every person involved with me, romantically or otherwise, has been forced into the spotlight, and they’re sick of it. I can’t hold a casual conversation with someone in a coffee shop without it appearing on the tabloids the next day.”
"Is it good?" she asked nervously.
"You wanted to see me, boss?"
The familiar voice washed over him like a cool, soothing wave, and he turned slowly on the spot, his hammering heart racing in his chest. His mind was already on overdrive, so the sight of wide, stunned silver eyes and pale, slicked-back platinum locks did nothing to placate him in his frazzled state. He opened his mouth, intending to say something, but no words made it past his lips, leaving him standing there slack-jawed and looking utterly foolish.
Silver eyes twinkled and the man quirked an eyebrow, gesturing to the garden around them. Harry laughed awkwardly and nodded, unable to comprehend the unusual reaction his body was having to the other man.
He finally smiled and said, "Sorry, were you waiting for me? I didn't notice."
They nodded hurriedly as they started to change out of their pyjamas. Harry helped Lily into her frock and sweater before they zoomed out of the room and down the stairs.
Sending a mental thank you to Malfoy for the idea, he leant back in his seat and waited patiently for her to begin. A few moments later, Lisa straightened up, a determined expression on her face, and said, "The truth is, I suspect that Erhard has the vase with him." She watched Harry as she continued to speak, and Harry made sure to keep his expression neutral. "Ever since the very first moment
their target," Draco whispered brokenly, the misery and guilt that had taken years of therapy to get over rising up beneath the surface.
Harry shook it once, the smile still on his face. "I hope I'm not bothering you with my consecutive visits."
She bowed her head and said, "I truly am sorry. I'm very grateful for all you've done for my husband and son."
She took a deep breath and smiled expectantly at him as she waited for everything to sink in. Harry sifted through the information, recollecting older knowledge regarding an organisation that sounded much like this one, and realised it might be the same. Wondering how many years it was since Neville started consulting them, he asked, "How long have you worked for Antares?"
," Ron said with the roll of his eyes, "I
Draco clawed at his shirt, and he reached into his pocket to pull out a syringe. He jabbed the needle into the blond’s thigh and pushed down on the plunger, hoping beyond hope the antidote worked and reversed the transformation.
He swallowed thickly, his eyes burning. Harry remembered what these pictures were. He remembered how he'd found Colin's body with the rest of the dead and how his little brother Dennis had begged Harry to take Colin's Polaroid. He'd relented when the boy had said Harry had always been his big brother's idol and he would've wanted Harry to have his camera.
He scrambled to a stop as the truck picked up speed, coming directly at him, and he only had a moment's time to jump out of the way before it zoomed past. He crashed into a pile of boxes that had been pushed up against one of the cement columns, hitting the back of his head against something hard and groaning as his body convulsed in pain.
"Oh, and Harry?" she called as he stepped under the mantle and threw down the Floo powder.
There was a short silence followed by hurried shouts and excited shrieks, and lots of thudding and clattering. Sighing, he trudged up the stairs and walked into Albus' room.
"521."
Harry scratched his ear, acknowledging that Draco had every right to be in a foul mood. It was the fourth morning since his son's disappearance, and they were sitting around, drinking coffee like it was just another day. Although Harry was doing everything in his power to make it so Draco could relax, it seemed to be backfiring.
They looked concerned, but Malfoy said, "Of course."
She broke off, unable to complete the train of thought, but Draco nodded anyway, knowing what she meant. Mr Simpson didn't look too happy, but he knew Astoria would take care of it and went off to call the authorities and inform them of his son's unexplainable disappearance.
From the sounds of it, there were four men—four lesser than there were supposed to be—and they were having a heated argument, the contents of which he couldn't decipher due to his poor linguistic expertise, but he presumed it had something to do with the missing men. He pressed closer, attempting to catch a glimpse of the perpetrators, when his radio went off.
He sighed again. "Alright, what happened?"
out of the whole year, and you behave as though the world is ending. What about all the times you're away and I've had to single-handedly deal with everything? And I'm with the kids
to hear that, I'm sure. So, what're you going to do with it?"
Harry sighed. "You're right. I'm sorry. It's just that having to rely on Ron and Hermione and your parents all the time sort of got to me, I suppose."
She handed him a letter, and Harry unfurled it quickly, scanning the contents. He raised his eyebrows when he saw who the addressee was, rereading the short letter to see if there was anything specific he should have noticed.
She pursed her lips. "I don't just want to fill a vacant post, and I most definitely don't want this promotion for the
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Yeah, no, I haven't. Last time we spoke she sounded really busy, so…"
Yawning, Harry walked out on to the balcony to find Hermione already there, a book in hand and a focused expression on her face.
His eyes widen and he sniffs himself. "Sorry, it must be all the alcohol—I didn't know I had bad body odour."
“Where is he? Where is he?” she asked urgently, and the boy waved a finger in the direction of the fire. “Get on your feet if you want to live,” she commanded, startling him awake with a weak Stinging Hex. “Head to Hogwarts! The wards will keep you safe.”
"You're not sixty!" Harry exclaimed.
Harry thought for a moment before saying, "I want you to get a hold of as much information as you can about the Barkrdiges' murders, and whatever intelligence you can glean from your lad in the German task force about Erhard Whatshisname."
Padma merely shrugged a shoulder. "I don't have enough evidence to make that claim, but everything that I told you so far comes directly from the horse's mouth—and by that, I mean my dear friend who headed the investigation."
A flash of red eyes and limp hair, the feel of skeletal fingers against his throat, the smell of rotting flesh…
Buxley nodded, not looking convinced. Harry continued, "I didn't put this down in the report because it didn't seem important—but when she first came to me, Lisa mentioned that her late grandfather had insisted that I'm the only one who could help her." He frowned thoughtfully. "I dismissed it as something unimportant, but now that I think about it, if her grandfather was murdered right after her seventeenth birthday, but still knew to tell her to come to me…" He looked up at his deputy. "Buxley, when exactly did she say the vase was stolen from her?"
But now… although everyone was attempting to smile in the pictures, it physically pained him to see how hard they were trying to get over what had just happened. It had been painful, the war, more so for those who hadn't fought in it but had lost loved ones and the survivors because of how many casualties the wizarding world had sustained from it. It was painful.
"What's this for?" he asked again as she took a step back to admire her handiwork.
"Of course. What can I do for you, Miss Barkridge?" He sat back in his seat and pushed the case file to the side as he studied her.
our heads are on the spike."
Neville shrugged. "I didn't want anyone to know."
“You’re back home quite early. What about work?”
"A red tricycle!"
Harry scoffed at the flawed logic, but Malfoy spoke with such conviction that he felt like he couldn't say no.
The kiss was everything that Draco was not; it was fervent and eager, confused and urgent, desperate and wanton, and when they pulled away, Draco felt more human than Veela.
The 'Realm of Monsters', as Draco liked to call it, was indeed a world separate from Harry's own, but the so-called
The corners of her eyes crinkled as she patted his arm and nodded. "You take good care of them, Harry."
"But it's
"I'm not running a
"I apologise for being late," he said to the three seated opposite Ramsey before turning and regarding the reporter with contempt. "Mr Ramsey, I see you're here, yet again making my job difficult."
"Wow," Harry says, squinting upwards. "Is this all yours?"
"Y-You should talk to your friends," Draco said in a rush, hurrying to get to his feet.
The elf bowed so low, her pointed nosed brushed against the carpet, causing her to break out in a fit of sneezes. Malfoy seemed genuinely concerned, and once he had made sure that the elf was OK, thanked her and sent her off.
They broke off their glaring contest as Ron stumbled into the room, his arms laden with bags upon bags.
"It isn't Ginny I'm worried about."
Starting to panic, he decided that it would be best to go to someone who could help him. The first person that came to mind was Camilla, and, taking in a deep breath, he focused on the image of a large, floating green plus sign and crisscrossing corridors as he spun on the spot.
"Really?" she gasped, her eyes shining.
When Harry had cast a sideways glance at Draco at this, the blond had only scoffed, gestured to the garden, and said, "You wouldn't believe it if I told you that I was imprisoned here."
?" Draco demanded.
"There's always a first time, right?" he said, patting the boy's hair. The child ducked his head and nodded.
Harry felt a lump form in his throat. Pressing a kiss to his son's head, he said, "I missed you, too."
Harry laughed at the exasperation in her voice before standing up and walking to the door. "Looks like it's working." He placed his hands on the doorframe and leaned out to yell, "Jamie!"
“I’m coming in,” his mother’s muffled voice said from the other side of the door.
Head Auror, and as Head of the Auror department, I would think it my duty to make sure that one of Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters' release and transfer happens seamlessly and according to protocol. I would rather be there than not. The last thing we need is a Death Eater on the loose."
Harry deliberated over that as he padded down the hallway to check up on the other two. "Maybe we can. Al, go downstairs while I pop in to check on Jamie and Lils."
Camilla grinned. "I told you so, didn't I?"
"There's no such thing as
The older wizard nodded, his expression grim. "It may be related to the other Floo disappearances."
"Alright, kids!" Fleur called as she came down the stairs. "Time for bed! Wish
"It's just
Harry froze, a feeling of trepidation trickling down his spine as he asked, "Wednesday?"
"Really?" she asked in a small voice, looking up at him with wide, brown eyes just like her mother's.
Neville grimaced. "Well, when I heard about his release… I had this sudden urge to go talk to him."
He lay sprawled over Harry, their limbs tangled together, until Harry shifted under him and Draco scrambled off, his face hot.
"I'm not sure, but please, don't let me keep you."
"Then
"Good. I'm glad you acknowledge your actions and are willing to change them," Draco said, patting the boy's back.
Harry frowned, trying to remember when this picture was taken. By the time the camera had run out of magical paper, he had frankly been overjoyed that he could stop, much too exhausted to bother with anything else, but he still remembered every single photo he had taken—except this one, apparently.
"Hey, come on, don't say that. Listen, how about we take them over to your parents' place and spend the night? I'll tell Angie I'll drop you off at the station tomorrow."
the one that can't let them go," he muttered as he tried to calm his racing heart and stabilise his breathing.
"Yeah… they weren't very bad at first, just passing nightmares, but they've been getting very vivid, and very real, of late. Almost like they're visions." He shuddered at the thought, absentmindedly touching his scar.
" Harry said. "But please, do tell."
Malfoy looked at him in a way that Harry looked at his kids when they were being particularly exasperating and said, "I am afraid that this is the extent to which I can help you on this matter without breaking protocol."
With a startling realisation, he turned, jumping back in shock at the form lying in bed next to him. There was some rustling as the man turned, the sunlight making his pale skin and tousled hair glow like a statue sculpted out of the purest marble.
Harry set her down and held her hand. "Why?" she asked.
"Your bed's next to mine. I've noticed how much you toss and turn."
"I love you," she whispered. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her against him, momentarily forgetting that he was supposed to be mad at her.
"Yessir!" came the united reply.
He turned to Neville, who stood staring at the dead man as though transfixed, and touched his arm. "What would you like to do with the body?"
"That suits us just fine," Padma said, pulling a hand out of her pocket to flip her long, sleek ponytail over her shoulder. "Give us Hertzfeld, and we shall leave you to do whatever it was you were doing before we rudely interrupted you."
She sniffed. "You think?"
"Not gladder than I am," she said with a sigh, and he sensed that something was wrong.
His mind went back to his conversation with Ron about him giving Ginny the benefit of the doubt, and he sighed.
She glanced down at herself and said, "Ah, yes. Draco decided that the traditional, lime-green Healer's robes were much too gaudy for this day and age and that a pristine white suited our profession much better."
She cocked an eyebrow. "So you don't care if I find out, you just don't want me to find out from
"Now, c'mon. I promised the kids we'd tell them some Quidditch stories before dinner."
The men behind her swore and took off running in the direction of the fire, and she sidled back up against the trunk to keep from being seen. Once she could no longer hear their footfalls, she took a final glance at the burning treetops and hurried into the clearing.
The boy nodded. "My name's Dan. Dan Grant."
"So," the blond said as they turned another corner. "Let's see…" he paused as he thought for a moment. "Ah, that's right. You said you deposited a vase in Gringotts today?"
Camilla looked between the two men and said, "Well, it only makes logical sense. Besides, you
It was a picture of him with Draco and Narcissa Malfoy.
"But how did you convince them that I had no say in the matter?"
Draco laughed mirthlessly. "I should be the one saying that, Potter, not you."
She considered that for a moment and nodded once. "That's right."
"I know." Neville leant forwards in his seat, his eyes shining with understanding and support. It reminded Harry of the times during the war when Neville had stood by his side irrespective of what had happened. It sort of relieved him that Neville was here, although he couldn't help but be overly cautious in case anybody realised something was going on. If everything was taken into consideration, his paranoia was justified—at least as far as he was concerned.
"Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind some, thank you."
"Bye," he called as the flamed enveloped her. Ron nodded towards him and followed after his wife, leaving Harry alone with his daughter.
to have my sons ride these ridiculous things," she said, tossing the brightly coloured tricycles to the ground.
Harry hopped onto the counter too. Now that they were eye-level again, Draco was forced to look into his piercing emerald eyes. Harry smiled, and Draco promptly looked away.
This was going nowhere.
"Right away, boss."
She paused again, and Harry felt a lump form in his throat. He could hear the sounds of people screaming and begging for their lives, and he quickly dispersed those thoughts. This wasn't about him. This was about her.
"Well… none of us
"You don't even have a licence! What if we get caught?"
"As long as you put him in his place," the girl muttered, throwing a disdainful look in Buxley's direction.
Harry groaned, and she shushed him as she continued with her ministrations. After about ten minutes, she went away, and when he thought she wouldn't return, she bustled back in.
"Sorry," I repeat as I hurry to the front desk. "We're closed for the day."
Harry nodded. "The one and only."
"Well, all of us live in the castle, of course," James began, motioning to what was apparently the castle, with a flourish. "And Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione and Rosie and Hugo live here," he continued, pointing to a smaller mound. "And Gran'pa and Gram'ma live here," he pointed to a third mound, "and everyone else lives all over here," he finished, motioning to all the different-sized mounds.
"Sounds great. Thanks again," Harry said as he held a hand out. "And I'm sorry for keeping you from your family."
"You seem to be under the misconception," Padma said, "that the man standing behind you is innocent."
Draco stared at Harry, speechless. Of all the things he had expected to hear, that wasn't even close. "Wow," he said, stunned. "That… definitely sounds like something Mother is capable of doing. Lying to the Dark Lord? That's Narcissa Malfoy for you. Don't ever tell her I told you that, though, or I'll be disowned."
"Sir, we just finished searching Grimmauld Place."
"Right… well, it's already been a couple weeks since we pulled them out, and Ginny and I've been really busy of late, so we haven't gotten around to looking for schools, yet. So I was wondering if you had any suggestions or recommendations."
Harry shrugged a shoulder. "I suppose it's not something very recent. Because of my nightmares, I used to go weeks on barely a few hours of sleep, before, but at that time I didn't have a lot of other things I had to deal with. Now that I think about it, I don't even remember when I started to sleep less and less. It just sort of happened."
"Yeah, the same," he said, shifting forwards in his seat. "I'm sure you've heard the rumours of Rodolphus Lestrange begging for the Kiss just a few months after his imprisonment, right? Said he couldn't bear any more nightmares of his wife being tortured. Said he was done."
"Well, I suppose it's about time I got changed, then."
She let go of him and moved away, hands held up in front of her. "Then I'll give you all the space you need. Is this enough?" she stepped further back. "Or do you need some more?"
"Where's Scorpius?"
"Yessir!"
Audrey had been the first to reply; her letter had arrived a little after eleven o'clock, saying she would be busy that afternoon, but was free around lunchtime. Malfoy's letter had arrived just as he was leaving to meet Audrey, and it just said that he would be in his office between two and four o'clock and would leave the Floo to his office fireplace open for Harry. So, Harry had decided to meet with Audrey first, then head over to Antares. He wanted to finish up the rather prolonged deal with who his Mind Healer would be, so he could start off with his treatment—or whatever it was called—and get it over with before people started asking questions.
"We took 'em," James whined. "Dad, we're
"Yeah, I've been giving her some potion Mum told me to mix in her milk, so she's calmed down a lot since last night. Her fever's gone down, too. She should be better in another day or two."
training wheels, I absolutely
Although Draco wouldn't admit it, the jab had had considerable effect on him, and he turned away with a sigh, proceeding around to the back entrance of his clinic-cum-townhouse to unlock it and step inside.
"You never fail to surprise me," Harry said, holding a hand out as the Aurors secured Macnair.
"Right." Harry sat up, anticipation thrumming through him. Malfoy picked up a slim pair of reading glasses from the table and placed them on the edge of his nose. "Before we start, would you like to talk about your day?"
"Yes, this is the first of the many forms you're going to have to sign if you decide to consult with us. It's only the initial ones that are important and need to be read carefully. The later ones that come during our sessions will be standard agreement forms."
"Both, please."
"Alright." The boy nodded and grinned.
After much deliberation, the boy said, "It's time to wake up."
Flicking his wand to shut the door and lock it, he muttered a few protective charms for good measure. He looked back towards the spot on the floor and saw the madman's face, now more prominent than ever, the sound of the waves filling his ears. He touched his throat, almost feeling a tingling sensation where the skeletal fingers had choked him, and swallowed thickly.
"All OK?" the blond asked, looking concerned.
is why I hate getting out of the office just before lunch hour," Harry groused as he got to his feet, taking the rest of the files from her arms. "Come on. I don't want someone else running into you and knocking you over
"Of course. And if Ginny and I decide to put the kids in the pre-school you work at, you might have to deal with more of me than you want to."
Draco smiled, nodding. "I'll keep that in mind. And we don't
He stared ahead, biting his tongue, but she'd explained to him what had actually happened, so he decided that he could let it go—for now. She ran her hand through his hair and he nodded. "OK."
Behind the waiting area was a set of stairs that led to the upper floors, and directly opposite the stairs was a spacious cubicle that had 'Pharmacy' written above it in the same green lettering. Inside were rows of shelves and cabinets that held all sorts of bottles and containers full of Muggle medication. There were several people huddled before it, holding out prescriptions, while three frazzled-looking pharmacists bustled about, pulling various bottles and tablet strips off the shelves.
know?"
Hermione shook her head, a thoughtful frown on her face. "I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before… I'm going to look into it. I'll let you know if and when I find something."
"I see." That was all the blond said for a long moment before suddenly standing up and moving to the back of the room. Harry watched as Malfoy fiddled around with something, then the familiar clinking of teacups was heard, and he returned with a tray. "Tea?"
James nodded, and Harry patted him on the head. As he turned around and made his way back to the entrance he heard James say, "No, they won't eat you if you don't go near them."
"What about?" she asked with a frown.
"On the envelope." Buxley opened his mouth, but Harry cut him off. "In invisible ink."
She didn’t look too convinced, so he added, “I promise you, if the person turns out to be a psychopath, I will run out of there without thinking twice about it.”
Buxley's frown eased, and he had a knowing expression in his eyes. "And what're
Draco stared slack-jawed as the person he was to marry entered the room. His mother jabbed him in the side with her elbow, and he snapped his mouth shut, swallowing down his shock.
Malfoy sat back and brought a hand to his mouth, looking lost in thought. After a moment he said, "I think your body may have grown immune to the potion."
When Kingley gave him a pointed look, his jaw dropped. "
“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded the moment they were alone.
find something interesting." When Harry eyed him curiously, he said, "Miss Barkridge confirmed that her father's aide, and close friend, Erhard Hertzfeld—who was reported missing after Jenson and Amber's deaths—might have something to do not only with their deaths, but also with the missing vase."
not three!"
He was seated beside two witches who, from having eavesdropped on their conversation, turned out to be friends of the older couple that had been abducted. One had just returned from a purported trip to the ladies room, her eyes shining with newly acquired gossip.
"Harry? What's going on? You sound… frustrated."
"Oh, come on, mate, whether you wanted people to know or not is besides the point. Being a war hero, if you'd even taken a single step in the direction of St Mungo's, it'd be all over the papers."
"Me?"
The bespectacled man apologises again, but I've long since stopped paying attention to him, and once I'm back from confirming that I am, indeed, on the right route, he informs me that his stop has arrived. I return his sheepish smile with a forced one of my own, glad to have rid myself of his irksome presence, and return to my brooding. I remain that way until the bus pulls up at my stop, and I hurry to disembark, more than unhappy that the first day of my so-called new life had gotten off to such a great start.
Hermione frowned. "No," she said slowly, pulling a book out of her bag. "Who told you that?"
Harry watched as Lestrange's hooded eyes slowly turned to the two of them, those empty, soulless orbs sending a chill down his spine at the hopelessness in them. This was a man who had given up on life. This was a man who didn't know the meaning of
"We can debate the extent of your foolishness once we're alive and safe," Harry said, stepping away but not letting go of Draco's hand. "Alright. Now do what you need to do."
Harry nodded, shooting the older man a solemn glance before stepping out the door. He wondered where Mrs Buxley was when a strapping young blond strode up to him and saluted smartly.
Draco shook his head. "I will be a fool if I let you talk me into this."
referred to.
random. As I said, the stress from various things and my restless sleep may have triggered them."
"After you." She motioned forwards, and he shrugged, deciding to play along with her.
He gave her an expectant smile, and she conceded begrudgingly. "Fine. But you have to
Malfoy said, "Now, if you don't have any further questions, shall we begin?"
to help
"No, I think I got bitten by something at the beach," he deadpanned. "It's been bothering me for a while now but I assumed it was sunburn. I should probably go see a Healer first thing in the morning."
She finished talking just as they came to stop in front of a door, and as she knocked, Harry's heart began to race again, but he was much calmer than he had been when he'd arrived. He glanced at Camilla and wondered if she'd only told him all of that irrelevant information simply to keep him occupied by redirecting his focus to something else so he could calm down. It was a technique he had learnt and used in his years as an Auror, whenever he had to question particularly nervous witnesses, and couldn't help but smile as he entered the office.
"Yes, well, does it mean something specific with regards to me?"
He started awake and blinked, stretching as he realised he had fallen asleep over his paperwork. The lights were turned off, and he figured it must've been Ginny's doing. Yawning, he eyed the clock on the desk and his eyebrows shot up.
It was love at first taste.
"Yeah, sorry 'bout that, didn't know we were expecting company," Harry said, placing his hands on his waist and giving Ginny a pointed look.
"Can't we just carry him, sir?" the lad he'd saved from going overboard asked, and Harry shook his head.
Harry stared at his tea and hummed under his breath. The implications behind that question were innumerous, but he knew what Malfoy meant. Was he, Harry Potter, willing to spill his deepest, darkest secrets to Draco Malfoy, who had been his sworn nemesis for most of his childhood?
Draco came up behind him, and Harry held a hand out as he waved his wand and pulled down the Disillusionment Charm. Draco's eyes widened as he took in the bloody words so alike the ones that had been scrawled on the walls of Hogwarts in his second year, the message making his blood run cold.
not ready?" he demanded, crossing his arms.
Harry made a vague motion with his hand and let his head fall back, closing his eyes and breathing as he tried to calm himself. Draco took the opportunity to look around the Gryffindor common room, startled by all the glaring colours but also envious of how warm and homely it looked. The eighth years had struck a deal with the professors to remain at Hogwarts for Christmas so they could finish the academic year sooner, and his mother had constantly sent him letters asking him to come home, perhaps thinking he was refusing to because she had forced him to return to the school.
He broke off abruptly when he felt Harry behind him. The bespectacled man reached over Draco's shoulder to pull his shirt off the hook, and Draco stood frozen, every cell in his body focused on the feeling of the other man pressed up against his back. "Pass me my hairbrush, will you? It's right there," Harry said, his voice low and rumbling right next to Draco's ear.
like you're cheating than actually cheat."
him, now?" Harry interrupted, making an exaggerated gesture of shock.
Harry nodded and moved back in his seat, relaxing into the cool comfort of the leather. He breathed out a sigh of relief, caught himself, and hoped Malfoy hadn't heard or seen it. Even if he had, the blond didn't seem to care, and it left Harry feeling conflicted for some odd reason.
They paused a little away from the head office, each lapsing into silence as they reverted back to their own thoughts. A few minutes later, Hermione exited the office. She looked frazzled, and her hair was all over the place, but she was beaming.
"I have documentation here to show that Head Auror Potter is the rightful inheritor of the vase," Hermione piped up, procuring a sheaf of parchment. "It was originally stolen from Grimmauld Place, which is now under the proprietorship of Auror Potter, thus making him the rightful owner."
Exhausted as he was from his lack of sleep and all the recent stress, he managed to lower the banner to the ground while muttering in complaint, sat back, and let his eyes slip closed.
They dawdled for a moment before Draco asked, "What now?"
Malfoy's eyes were wide and shimmering, and he looked as though he was trying very hard to contain his laughter. "I suppose, seeing as you've already invited yourself, an invitation on my part won't be necessary."
"I've been hearing that an awful lot, lately. So, what did the two of you chat about?"
Harry rolled his eyes, opening his mouth to retort when he suddenly realised something. "Wait, so how exactly did Neville know about all of this?"
Breathing deeply, he took several minutes to think about what he would say and do, about the different scenarios that could transpire, and if interfering really was the best decision.
Shrugging, Harry placed the picture back and then turned to the objects he had lined up.
"Hermione wouldn't be too pleased to know that the Malfoys still enslave House-elves," Harry commented after a moment, for the simple reason that he hoped that annoying the man may get him to be more Malfoy-like. He realised that the reason for his agitation may be because the person sitting before him looked like Malfoy but was nothing at all like the man he once knew, and the lack of familiarity in their interactions was unnerving.
"Harry," Ginny said, and it seemed like she was trying very hard to not sound angry. He frowned.
Harry cleared his throat and nodded, trying not to look as mortified as he felt, and Malfoy was kind enough to allow him the chance to spare himself of any more embarrassment by changing the topic. "Alright, now that we've settled that—I would like to give you a simple task for you to complete before our next session."
"Yeah."
"I—I—" he stammered, unsure of what to say, his muddled mind numb and confused, the wine warm in his stomach and like cotton in his head.
he said, holding the glass of water out to Draco, who took it shakily and gulped it down. He sighed, his eyes glassy, and Harry decided that the blond had done more than enough.
"As my wife insisted, I, too, would prefer to be addressed by my first name." His smile was tired but not strained. "Mr Malfoy is how my patients address me, and despite being in the clinic, it feels odd for the primary investigator of my son's kidnapping to address me in the same way."
Harry rolled his eyes as his son yelped and grabbed his leg, shrieking in pain. Albus snickered and whispered, "Serves you right," smiling innocently up at Harry when he looked down at him with raised eyebrows. The three then made their way inside with a limping and grumbling James in tow, but the moment they reached the two goblin sentries standing outside the main hall, all three children simmered down.
tell everyone the good news."
"Never thought I'd live to see the day you admit that," Harry said, and Buxley chuckled quietly.
"I suppose," he answered, feeling uncomfortable under her piercing gaze. This woman seemed like more of a diplomat or a politician than a Mind Healer, and he didn't know how he felt about having to spill all his deepest, darkest secrets to her.
"Yeah?"
what you're up to."
"Sounds like a plan!" she said, putting away the puzzle and helping Ginny clear the living room.
"You deserved it! I
"It wasn't presumptuous of you." When Draco continued to squint at him, Harry chuckled and said, "I would've continued to hit on you all evening if you hadn't told me off."
"Flip through the pages, Sir. You'll see several lines have been highlighted in red."
"Sir," the Auror said, looking agitated. "Samuel Ramsey is inside, interviewing the parents."
"I promise anyway."
They lapsed into silence again, but this time he was smiling, and he knew she was, too. "Come home soon. We all miss you."
She nodded and walked to the kitchen isle, giving him a moment to calm himself. He inhaled shakily and ran the tip of his wand over his body and clothes, cleaning himself with a simple freshening charm Hermione and Ginny had stumbled upon when trying and failing to get the kids to clean themselves.
"Honestly? Yeah."
"I know, Al, but she's your baby sister, isn't she?" he tried to reason, but Albus huffed adamantly and looked away.
"Boss."
“I’m not sure if you follow the news—or the news related to me, anyway—but they still won’t let me outlive this whole Chosen One nonsense and I’m frankly sick of it.”
Camilla stepped forwards and smiled. "I'll walk you to the lift."
Draco brought over the tea and placed a mug in front of Harry before taking the seat opposite him. They sipped their tea in silence, and Harry looked everywhere but at the blond, who was studying him.
had been the subject of humiliation.
His mother was silent for a moment, and he didn’t dare look up at the expression on her face. “Your cousin did.”
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, squatting down beside Harry and wrapping him with the heavy coat he had had the presence of mind to bring.
The man nodded once, and she threw her head back, a peal of maniacal laughter spilling from her painted lips. "Oh, I knew I made the right decision in tracking you down."
"I may have gone overboard," he says, sheepish. "But I find cooking and baking to be very de-stressing, and after...you know...I've just been making way too much food so I thought I may as well share."
"No."
"That's great," Harry said, but Lily stood up and started bouncing on the spot.
"Two days ago."
"Don't wanna!"
"I think I've had a little too much to drink. Don't wanna Apparate and end up splinching myself."
"Oh, Mr Potter." Malfoy rose from his seat and came around his desk. "I didn't expect you to come through the door."
"Ginny? What's going on?" he asked, the worry starting to build up from the pit of his stomach. She was behaving rather suspiciously.
He rolled his eyes at her and said, "Because I didn't tell her. Why do you think?"
, who was just puking his guts out and passed out on the sofa, are all bright and fresh, while
Albus stuck his bottom lip out and crossed his arms, sulking. Harry hid a smile as Lily turned in a slow circle, apparently looking for her grandma.
The coals crackled and hissed, and Hermione's face appeared in the embers. "Harry!" she said, the worry clear in her voice. "Thank goodness you're alright. You had us worried."
"And what's that?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I know that but…"
"Oh, he didn't. He got six."
"I will." He smiled at her and jogged towards where the kids were, allowing his minds to sort through yet another fragment of information that added on to the list of unanswered questions he already had.
"Right."
"It's this weekend." Neville seemed to struggle for a bit, as though he couldn't say whatever he wanted to. "His release."
Draco rolled his eyes, but he couldn't quite reject the brunet. "Only until I'm done eating. And if you get any bodily fluids on me, I swear I'll—"
Draco finally looked at Harry and smiled, but it was the smile of a broken man who had seen far too many horrors in his lifetime to believe in promises.
"Yay! I'm gonna go tell Jamie!"
Harry was about to retort that his naming skills were at least better than Malfoy's, but the smile the blond shot him seemed genuine enough that he decided to let it go.
“Wild dog attacks local children?” he read, motioning to the paper. “What does that have to do with me?”
She sniffed, drawing patterns on his chest with her finger. Harry waited patiently, knowing she would tell him when she was ready, and held her as she sniffled. Finally, she said in a voice so quiet he almost missed it, "Don't wanna go to the Burrow."
"That explains why they aren't here. Do you want a drink?" Draco said, cracking open a can of beer and handing it to Hermione in exchange for a mini quiche.
On his way, he took a slight detour to a certain bakery where he bought a muffin and paid quite a bit more than necessary.
"I love all of you, Harry, you know that."
"Rabastan Lestrange."
They settled back in their seats, sipping their tea in silence as they listened to their kids' joyous shrieks coming from upstairs.
She laughed, tears spilling down her cheeks. "Erhard said the same thing to me in his letter."
"Alright, that's it, we're returning all of these," Hermione said crisply, piling the boxes together and putting them back in the bag.
"I would never put you through that," Ginny said as they hugged.
"Oi, Longbottom!" Robards bellowed, and Neville started, looking around as though there was someone else by the same name, and then pointing at himself. "Yeah, you! Do you see any other pansy idiots around here?"
-oOo-
"That's right! Gives you the illusion of having all the energy in the world, it does! And then I'll be the one to lug your sorry arse inside when you're huffing and puffing and wheezing your poor lungs out," Molly complained as she bustled about.
There was a long moment of silence, after which Buxley slowly raised his arms and pulled Harry's hands from his shoulder. "First of all, please stop doing that," he said as he let Harry's hands go. "And, second of all, if I may say so respectfully, you sound mad."
Draco took it, allowing himself to be pulled off the bed, and stood still for a second, focusing on the feeling of solid ground under his feet.
"Right, well, here're your papers. Good luck."
They consisted of trinkets, memorabilia, keepsakes, and other odd pieces of junk that he was sure he'd only kept because of their sentimental value. He picked up a mirror shard and instantly recognised it as being part of the mirror Sirius had given him. Dispelling thoughts related to Sirius, he set the shard aside and turned to the other things.
"I know what you're going to say," he said before Harry could even speak, "and I refuse."
Harry returns to the Burrow to find Ron and Hermione there, taking care of the sick kids, and with Hermione's coaxing, Harry decides to make good of his day off and take a nap. However, his nightmares haven't left him be just yet, and a worried Hermione confronts Harry about them. Ron, who overhears the conversation, gives Harry his own bit of advice. After a surprisingly restful night's sleep, Harry heads off to work, only to hear startling news about Buxley.
Potter’s expression sobered. “I want to tell you how untrue that is, but I don’t think you’ll listen.”
The one right next to me.
They sat in silence for a moment, and just as he was about to speak, the witch said, "I was rather surprised when Parvati contacted me saying you had something urgent you wanted to discuss. So urgent that you needed to see me in person."
conversation with her, you know, and it could go either way."
"It's too late for that. I'm already involved in it."
in elegant cursive writing beside them.
Harry felt a warm feeling settle in his stomach. He remembered the day when Hagrid had come and taken him away, and couldn't help but wonder if he had managed to make this little boy half as happy as he had been. Ruffling the boy's hair affectionately, he started to walk away, when the child called, "I don't think you're a bad dad, Mister!"
Harry nodded and moved away to grab his coat. He turned around to see Draco ready to leave as well and said, "It would be better if you stayed here, where it's safe."
The last thing he needed was to trip and fall down the stairs and die in a pool of his own blood after having survived a direct Killing Curse from the greatest Dark Wizard of all time.
Harry nodded, his forgotten nervousness coming back with full force. "Well, where do you want me to start?"
"It's perfectly alright," the blond finally said in a voice that was soft and soothing, and so unlike anything he'd ever heard leave Malfoy's lips, that it sent shivers down Harry's spine and made his skin tingle. "I've instructed my secretary to reschedule all of my morning's work to after lunch."
The blond's expression turned to a more genuine one as he motioned to the picture frame on his desk. "Yes, I do, as you're well aware."
Harry chuckled as he watched the on-goings, sipping on his tea.
"Oh, no, please call me Lisanna. Liz or Lisa are fine as well, sir." She waved her hands, looking like she would break out in tears if he didn't do as requested.
"Right, but it was stolen—"
"You're right, and I'm sorry. That was unprecedented, and I should've informed—"
"Oh, really?" Neville asked, not having seen the look Harry's deputy had given him. "What about the kids?"
"Yeah, which other Audrey d'you know?"
Buxley nodded. "Are you implying that this missing aide might be somehow involved?"
"Oh, for heaven's sake." The blond snapped his fingers and a bucket appeared over Harry, overturning and dousing him with cold water. "There, that should clear your head."
"Little Lou is Little Lou!" she yelled, prancing around. "And you're little, too! Little Al!"
"Oh, and Buxley?"
"—but I have a strong feeling about this. Buxley, if anyone knew about the vase and that it was going to be stolen, it would've been Hertzfeld. If anyone knew to question the causes of his employers' deaths, it would've been Hertzfeld. If anyone knew that Lisa was going to come to me for help, it would've been Hertzfeld. And if
Harry frowned in disbelief but was distracted as Draco pushed away the chairs to reveal an ornate symbol carved into the marble. It looked familiar enough, but Harry couldn't quite place it.
He leant forward and sniffed, blanching at the heavy scent of alcohol on her breath.
"It's wonderful to see you too, Harry darling," Molly replied, kissing him on both cheeks. "Oh! I've made your favourite—Treacle Tart!"
Neville jerked back, alarmed, and frowned. "Mate, relax, what's wrong with you?"
He whipped his phone out from inside his coat, barely pausing in his searching, and clicked on the speed-dial button. The call took a few moments to connect, considering his location and the magic flying around, and Robards' voice crackled on.
"Mr Malfoy?" a witch called just then. "Head Auror Potter will see you now."
"Is it because I'm a woman?"
"—but I'm feeling a bit blue myself, and could use a shoulder to cry on."
Hermione stopped in her information dump to take a breath and eyed Harry with a triumphant look. Harry, however, wasn't entirely sure what the point of that story was and was rather afraid to ask any further. He didn't have to, though, because Hermione continued anyway.
Harry nodded. "For as long as I can remember. It sort of became a bad habit I couldn't get rid of, after a point of time, and I had to consciously stop resorting to it every time I had trouble sleeping."
He had his head in his hands from the recent news of Macnair's unexpected death, knowing the media was going to give them flak for poor vigilance, when the door was thrown open and Draco came bursting in.
"I didn't
Harry turned to his fuming deputy and held his hands up in surrender. "I was just doing my job."
Lily whined as James laughed evilly. Albus giggled, but the moment Harry turned to look at him, he instantly sobered down and blinked up at Harry with an innocent expression.
"Something
"No, it's nothing, sorry 'bout that. I've just had a really stressful weekend at work, and it looks I'm still a little hung up over it."
She shrugged and offered him a small smile, but he could see that the recent happenings had taken a toll on her. She was paler than usual, and she wasn't half as energetic as she had been when they'd first met. His men had told him that she hadn't been eating much, and she had refused to check into another place or sleep in the Ministry's housing facility, insisting that she would rather spend the night on the uncomfortable couch in the Auror Office. He hadn't spoken to her since the previous evening, and except for a few, brief check-ins, he hadn't even seen her until just then.
The moment Harry moved forwards, however, he instantly knew what she meant. He shivered slightly as the warm, tingling sensation of the rather subtle Muggle-Repelling Charm swept over him, leaving his extremities feeling sensitive.
"I don't know," Harry whispered, wondering for himself why he was taking everything into stride so simply. "Maybe I'm just that simple-minded."
"Dad, you going to work today?"
"I'm guessing you felt obligated to tell him, considering Lestrange was one of the four Death Eaters that put Alice and Frank Longbottom permanently in St Mungo's?"
Harry finds himself face-to-face with Mind Healer Draco Malfoy and is unable to understand why he's so irritated despite the fact that Malfoy was being nothing but polite and patient with him.
Everyone sat staring at the former Death Eater's body, stunned and unable to believe what they had just witnessed, till Robards' gruff voice echoed through the quiet moor.
Hermione rolled her eyes as she stirred her tea. "I don't remember a time I participated in any of your shenanigans." Harry raised his eyebrows in a way that said
Hermione gave him an incredulous look, as though she simply didn't see the logic behind his reasoning. "That makes no sense, Ron! We don't
Harry looked sympathetic. He offered him a kind smile and a gracious apology before motioning to the message over the fireplace. "So, we've been going through our list of anyone who could have a grudge against you and narrowed down the most likely suspects. From the messages, it sounds like this person may have, in some way, directly been impacted by your actions before and during the war."
Rose and Hugo ran in just then, screaming at the top of their lungs. Albus and James joined in a moment later, and the four kids jumped around the living room, trying to out-shout the other. Lily stirred in Harry's arms with a little whimper, and he instantly pulled his wand out and cast a Silencing Charm on the fearsome foursome. They paused in their bouncing around to stare at him wide-eyed. He simply pressed a finger to his lips and motioned to his daughter, and James, deciding to be the responsible older brother, gestured for the other kids to follow him as he led them up the stairs. Harry undid the Silencing Charm before they disappeared out of sight, and turned to his best mate with a look of pity.
He had no idea where the hell Malfoy's office was.
He had almost finished when there was a knock on the door. Guessing it was probably Buxley or one of the other Aurors, he called for them to enter without looking up from the forms he was signing.
Weasley and his horrible-haired girlfriend walked past Draco to stand on either side of Potter. The duo wore identical expressions of disgust as they eyed Draco—as though
Draco looked at the empty street below, wondering if it was a good idea to keep talking. "I can see it, you know."
"How've you been doing, Harry?" Molly asked as she came to sit beside him, wiping her hands on her apron.
Dyers sat back, looking immensely relieved. "Oh, fantastic. They'll be
"Oh, you owe me big time. And I'll make sure you don't forget it."
Once the kids were all settled in, he switched the lights off and was about to go downstairs when Molly called up the stairs.
"I didn't know you had an on-going investigation in our part of town," Harry replied in a similar tone of voice as Padma as he calculated how many of his men would be required to take down all of the Germans behind her if worse came to worst.
She watched him for a moment longer and then offered him a small smile. "Why don't I make you a cup of tea?" she asked, pecking him on the cheek.
Lisa seems to be hiding something; Harry finds a threatening note addressed to him; Buxley and Harry struggle to find the missing pieces of the puzzle by themselves, so Harry decides to call on an old friend; meanwhile, somewhere in the outskirts of London, some shady business is underway as the lead suspect shows himself.
"I'm actually surprised you chose to finally transfer after being with the DRCMC for so long," Harry remarked.
Harry waved a hand. "I want you to take a few of your men and go back to the hotel Lisa had been staying at. I want you to ask around and see if anyone had seen someone who looked like Hertzfeld in the past few days. The moment you find a clue, I want you to follow up on it, and come back here only when you've found either Hertzfeld or something that would lead us to him."
Inhaling a deep breath, Draco spoke. "Harry, it's me."
Harry sat back in his seat and inhaled deeply before answering. "Well, although the Harpies lost before the semis, they're still going to stay back for the after-party and leave on Saturday morning as planned. Ginny's supposed to leave at the same time, but she's not returning home with them. She's got some more work to take care of, apparently, but I'm planning to catch her right after the finals tomorrow afternoon and spend the evening with her before she leaves."
She hugged him one last time before walking away, looking over her shoulder and waving when she reached the corner. He waved back before stuffing his hands in his pockets, watching the place where she'd disappeared for a long moment before getting into the car.
The moment he felt solid ground beneath his feet, he also heard the familiar gurgle of his stomach and pressed a hand to it.
"Can I do anything to help?"
"Precisely," Camila replied, her smile wide. "Is there anything else you'd like to know?"
"Vase, please," the goblin said as they entered the vault. Harry dutifully handed over the vase and watched as the goblin went over to the farthest wall and placed it on the stone ledge, beside the other artefacts Harry had collected over the years. The goblin then touched the ledge, and the stone above and below the vase warped itself to encase the vase. He tapped the stone cube twice, and it cracked and crumbled away to reveal a transparent glass-like encasement beneath.
She sighed, long and deep, and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. Looking away from him, she said, "George and the kids had planned this whole thing for Angie, so he wanted me to convince her to go on a trip for her birthday so they could surprise her."
"He is a German wizard under trial for murder," Padma repeated, her voice tight. "Whatever evidence you have can be submitted to us, and we shall go about the appropriate channels to determine his innocence—or guilt."
Harry ran his hands through his hair as the exhaustion finally settled over him. "That is literally the best news I have heard all week. Now all I need is a nice bath and my warm bed, and I couldn't ask for anything else."
"Well, if you're only trying to find some stolen vase, I don't see what the big deal is. Other than that it isn't really your job to find stolen stuff for people. The Ministry has a separate department for that, you know."
"You never do," the matron replied, piling a plate with some mash, boiled vegetables, and a small piece of steak. She pushed the plate towards him, and he tried to politely decline, but she wasn't having it. "Won't have one of our volunteers passing out because I didn't feed him enough."
Malfoy nodded. "Of course. If tomorrow isn't possible, then the day after would be fine, but tomorrow would be preferable, even if it's just for a half-hour or so."
He watched her disappear out the door and turned back to his drink, staring at the remnants of it at the very bottom of his mug. A nagging sensation was tugging at the back of his mind, but he ignored it as he finished off the last bit of Firewhiskey and moved to the sink to rinse the mug clean.
"I don't know if they did," she answered truthfully. "But I had to try."
Neville flinched, but Harry's ears were ringing, and his heart was racing so he barely noticed. "Of all the
Harry snorted as Neville went red in the face. "Still think teaching a bunch of brats is worse?" Harry whispered, and Neville shot him a look.
Harry nodded. "Sounds like it's going to be an interesting experience. I've never really sold anything in an auction before. So I'll see you there at, say, three o'clock?"
Harry snapped his head up to see a young witch, who looked to be no older than twenty, standing awkwardly at his door. He rose to his feet and motioned to the chair opposite him. She nodded, shut the door, and shuffled closer. She stood beside the chair and offered him a small smile.
Draco expected her to shut down his claim instantly, but instead she crossed her arms and asked, "Why would he do that? I can't imagine why he would want to sneak past me without being seen."
But, despite all the legislations passed in support of werewolves to help them live normal lives, justice and equality only ran skin-deep. Beneath all the flesh and bone was the unchangeable prejudice born from fear, and no matter the speeches given or marches conducted, the looks of disgust still lingered, crawling up and down his skin and making his insides churn.
Malfoy had a thoughtful expression on his face. "Tell me, have you been drinking Potions for Dreamless Sleep?"
"I can take care of myself just fine, Potter."
Frozen to the spot, Harry felt torn between the rising feeling of guilt that he was the reason Malfoy was having an argument with his wife and the fact that it was none of his business what was going on on the other side of the door. But even as he inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, his mind instructing him to walk straight to the couch and pretend to be oblivious to everything that he had overheard, being the person that he was, he couldn't just let it go.
driving
Malfoy nodded again. "It does. Since you're in a hurry, I have a list of available healers' bios here from which you can take your pick. I have chosen only the most qualified, of course," he added, as though he wanted to make sure that not having Camilla as his healer wouldn't mean Harry had to accept the second best.
dangerous, and I don't think the force would be the same without Jon. He's helped me on countless occasions, and for that, I'll be forever grateful."
The man approached them, emerald eyes glittering with mirth as he came to stand before Draco in a perfectly-tailored suit and miraculously neat hair, his spectacles reflecting the fluorescent lamp’s light and nearly blinding Draco. He held his arm out, and Draco stared at it before mechanically reaching up and shaking it.
"Girls are cute! I'm a
"Gin, are you there? Listen, if you don't want to do this, it's fine, I'm sure he'll understand—"
"Did your nightmares get worse?"
"This is my wife, Astoria," Malfoy introduced, as though they had just happened to bump into each other on the street.
"Sorry about coming unannounced," Harry said as Audrey motioned back down the way she'd come. "I hope I didn't cause any inconvenience."
Harry grinned as he raised his mug in a toast. "Here's to watching you shake up the DMLE from the roots."
"You're making this harder for me, you know," she said in a teasing voice, although her brown eyes seemed suspiciously moist.
"Thank you," Harry replied, still feeling weird about the way Malfoy addressed him but being unable to bring it up. He sat down in the same armchair as last time and made himself comfortable, deciding to distract himself by speaking about something else. "Well, this case was something that needed to be dealt with immediately, so I spent the weekend at the Ministry, working."
James crossed his arms and sulked. "We don't
"And why are you showing me this drawing of a vase, Lisa?"
you plan on doing with it?" the blond asked, drawing Harry out of his mental argument with his conscience.
"And she was right."
for the other to say something. Ginny finally sighed before disconnecting the call. Harry stared at the screen for a long moment before pocketing the phone. He hated it when things were like this.
Harry snorted, taking off his glasses and placing them on the nightstand as Draco climbed in beside him, now feeling the embarrassment take over. He cleared his throat as Harry flicked the lights off.
"Wow," I say, reaching for a scone. "You're one hell of an upstanding guy, you know that?"
Once he was tucked into a corner of his toilet, he turned on his phone, and his eyebrows shot up when he saw that he had received a message from Camilla. Curious, he quickly opened it and scanned the contents. It wasn't written in the usual, formal way all her letters were, confirming his suspicion that this was something personal. He had only left his phone number for the sake of emergencies as their correspondences were usually through letters, and was concerned about why she had chosen to contact him via text message. She wanted to know if he could meet with her for lunch because there were things she wanted to discuss and that it would be completely off the record because she was doing this on her own time.
The forensics team head glanced at Harry, who nodded, then explained, "The Floo Network has a magical trace connecting various fireplaces that allows people to Floo from one location to another. A person can only travel to the places that their Floo is connected to. But, the problem with public-access Floos like yours is that it allows anybody to create a trace to it as long as they know its exact location."
"Draco?"
"I asked Mason to hold the lift. You OK, mate?"
"Well, er…" he seemed to be struggling with whatever he was trying to say, his awkward demeanor around Draco persisting from the previous day.
"Keys?"
Harry caught his breath at the question. He wasn't sure what to say, but he decided that his best bet was to be honest. "I don't think so, no… I might not be the best dad, but I don't think I'm a bad one."
The blond looked up at him. Silver eyes glittered in reply.
"Where is everybody?" he asked as Molly came in through the kitchen door and exclaimed at the sight of him.
Malfoy nodded. "Alright, well, what's on your mind right now?"
Harry grinned. "That I am."
Harry groaned. "She's going to kill me."
"Yessir."
"Where'd that runt run off to, eh? Who's seen him, then?" the man bellowed, waving the rolling pin around rather violently. People moved away from the shop, looking wary, and Harry was about to join them when the Muggle caught his arm.
He gasped as he felt cool fingers wrap around his wrist and shake it, bringing him back to his senses. He stared at Camilla through the haze fogging his vision, taking in the worried expression on her face.
"Harry? Are you asleep?"
"What time is it?" he asked groggily, too lazy to find his watch, and Albus checked his naked wrist.
And he was currently considering giving up as he sat in the middle of his room, surrounded by leaflets, brochures, magazines, newspapers and whatnot. He leant his head back and closed his eyes, inhaling deeply as the familiar sense of anxiety began to bubble in the pit of his stomach.
Draco let out a shaky laugh. "You saved me from a mad evil wizard and from rotting away in Azkaban for the rest of my life. Of course I trust you."
doing here?" he demanded.
"Good night," he replied, turning away from her and watching the sliver of moonlight that shone through a crack in the drapes until sleep overcame him. When he dreamed, he dreamed of another memory.
"Coming, coming," Hermione said, bustling away. She pecked her husband on the cheek on the way out, leaving Harry and Ron to look at each other awkwardly.
I swallow down the guilt and don a smile as Harry looks up at me and pats the blanket. As I settle down, Harry starts to unpack what I had assumed would be a simple meal but turned out to be a full-fledged, three-course dinner.
He scoffed as he kicked the body again. "If this worthless piece of garbage is what you consider
Was there something under the wallpaper?
"Oh." Harry cleared his throat, embarrassed. "Right. Er… well, then, I graciously accept your invitation."
"No. No, I'm not." Harry squatted down so he was around eye level with the blond and smiled tentatively. "I'm Harry."
was the undesirable pest.
He stumbled as he felt solid ground beneath his feet and used the wall to support himself. He was sweating now, and his breath was coming out in gasps. Quickly looking around, he realised he'd landed in the middle of the adjacent corridors of Antares, just beyond the Anti-Muggle spells. Thanking his lucky stars, he staggered down the left corridor. If he was going to hyperventilate and pass out, he didn't want to do it somewhere where people could see him.
She tilted her head and said, "My sister isn't too pleased about having to play the role of my secretary and take down messages for me."
"I walked past this afternoon while on an errand and saw how packed the shop was, so I figured you'd be swamped and thought I'd drop by instead."
“What—why—” Draco stammered stupidly, and Potter grinned in response.
it was just Pig. What had he expected?
The blond strode up to him, looking serious. "Sir?"
The man looked between them wide-eyed. "Your… son?"
"Oh, yes, of course. I can go around asking, if you would like—"
She sighed. "I originally only joined this camp as a volunteer because it was the easiest way to come in contact with families returning to the country after fleeing during the war but having nowhere to go because their homes were destroyed."
Harry stepped back, arms spread out on either side, and said, "I kept thinking I knew Hertzfeld from somewhere because something about him seemed so familiar. But every time I thought about that family photograph, I came to the same conclusion: I'd never seen the man before in my life." He began to pace up and down in his excitement, and Buxley's eyes followed after him. "And then it hit me! The reason I thought I knew him was because he reminded me so much of someone
"I'm sorry," Harry said somberly.
"Why're you going as part of the Harpies?" Harry asked as he dried his hair.
"Yeah," he said slowly as she leaned down, her eyes hooded.
"No!" She stood up, grabbed her purse, the envelope, and the drawing, her eyes filling with tears once again. "No, sir! It has to be the Head Auror. Grandfather
Harry shrugged. "I think it might be mutually beneficial." When Malfoy's sceptical expression didn't change, Harry added, "All I'm suggesting is that we try it out. You
"Right." He stood and walked across the room to where she was standing. "Anyway, I promise to keep you in the loop so you don't have to worry about me so much."
If anybody spots errors in the French please let me know because I used Google Translate and Merlin knows it's as good at its job as Binns is at teaching History.
His deputy didn't seem all that placated, but before Harry could say anything else, the door to his office was thrown open and a gasping Hermione strode in, eyes wide and hair wild.
"Morning," Harry greeted his mother-in-law as she made her way to the kitchen. "Is it too late for breakfast?"
But he couldn't. He had no right.
"What happened to Perseus?" Harry asked, signing the letter.
"Oh, that's not true at all, Harry—"
How in the world does
Draco was absolutely miserable, and every moment he spent in the almost-as-good-as-new castle reminded him why he had vehemently refused to return. He had no friends—the one that did come back preferred to snog his badger girlfriend than have intelligent conversation with Draco—nor did he have Professor Snape to idle the days away with, learning some new potion or the other.
Ron sat back, the same sort of brooding expression on his face that Hermione had had earlier that day. "What sort of case?"
Draco hummed in thought. "Unless you're planning on marrying me for my money, I don't think I will."
"Alright, alright. Let Daddy come in, first." He put Lily down and ruffled Albus's hair. "Where's Jamie?" he asked, looking around when he didn't spot the older boy.
"The one where we promised we wouldn't go digging up stuff about the war."
He watched the flash of green light, and the man before him crumpled to the ground, still clutching the piece of torn parchment. Walking around the table, he leant down and snatched the worn blueprint, eyeing the small arrow marks that pointed away from the words
Ron frowned. "Because those aren't the newest kind."
Malfoy snapped his fingers and his parchment and quill zoomed over and stood at attention next to him. "Don't worry, I'm only taking down the underlying medical factors that could have something to do with your nightmares and your insomnia. These headaches of yours—how often to you get them?"
Harry didn't know how to respond to that bit of personal information, surprised not only because the blond had decided to share such private details with him but also because there was no malice in his tone. He sounded genuinely relieved.
"Do you trust me so little?" he asked with a chuckle, and she laughed.
"Oh, yeah, it didn't turn out the way we planned, but the higher ups are pleased nonetheless, so I guess what's done is done."
Unable to reach a solution, he decided that he needed someone to tell him what the hell he was supposed to do to keep the pieces of his crumbling life from falling apart. He glanced towards the fireplace, and the only image that flashed through his mind was that of a smiling blond holding a teacup, and he knew what he had to do.
"I didn't know you were here," Harry said. "I thought you took Hugo home."
She tutted softly, and Draco scoffed. “Considering they’re willing to take in someone like me, I suppose we have no choice but to acquiesce to their demands,” he said in a mocking tone.
"I know that. Doesn't mean I have to be happy about it, though." He didn't mean to make it sound like he was complaining, but the way Hermione's forehead creased into a worried frown made him wave his hand and try to make light of his words. "It's like you and Ron, except Ginny's far more reasonable when she isn't being completely adamant about something."
Malfoy's eyes seemed to harden at that, as though something about Harry's decision was unsettling, but Harry might have just been imagining it because Malfoy continued saying in the same tone of voice, "No, no. Please don't mind me. I assumed otherwise since most of our clients take painstaking care in ensuring that their actual identities are not revealed, especially since a lot of them are high-ranking or well-known individuals, such as yourself."
He could no longer ignore the fact that his nightmares were slowly eating away at his sanity and ruining his life. Somehow, when Ginny and the kids were around, he was able to function normally, and the nightmares didn't affect him as much. But as soon as he was away from them… it was like a rabid animal that had broken free from its chains.
at the bottom of the sheet.
"Oh, yes, thank you." He handed her the bouquet and watched as she undid the wrapping and replaced the flowers in the glass jar beside the bed with it. He waited awkwardly till she was done and walked up to him, her eyes never leaving the floor. He had half a mind to apologise to her, but he remained silent.
"We make quite a pair, don't we?" Harry says with a chuckle, as though reading my mind.
"Hermione, wake up," he whispered. She stirred and mumbled for a moment before blinking and looking around blearily.
"No. Now move," Draco snapped, trying but failing to walk around the gangly redhead. He sighed. "Look. If you have such a problem with your boyfriend hanging out with me, shouldn't you be talking to
want to go?" he asked, and Lily shook her head again.
need me, you know how to find me. Don't tell Parvati I put you up to it, though."
As they came up to the front, a bit of an argument started between Hermione and Ron, with her insisting that she drive again and him questioning the exact necessity of him being there.
he told his brain, but only got snickers and giggles in reply.
"And for no reason, too! One phone, or even two, is understandable, Ron, but
The two men looked over their shoulder as Harry's deputy stood behind them, looking between them with an odd expression on his face. Harry cleared his throat. "What is it?"
"Well, I've been here longer than any other human you've brought here and I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?"
While Harry was trying to calm Ginny, Hermione and Draco settled down on the sofa and opened up the box of treats Harry had brought along with him. "Ooh, mini quiches!" Hermione exclaimed in delight as Draco eyed the crate of alcohol in the corner.
—but the one that he despised the most.
Ron's disembodied head bobbed as he nodded. "Sure, sure, no problem. 'Mione and I don't mind at all. I mean, Ginny and you've looked after Rosie and Hugh a bunch of times before, so it's all good. Just thought I should tell you is all."
"It's just…" she trailed off, and Harry bit back a sigh. These women and their apparent inability to get to the point.
"Harry, this isn't your decision to make." Kingsley's voice was strained, and Harry sat up, knowing the conversation may just have taken a turn for the worst.
new phones; the ones we have work perfectly fine!"
Camille inclined her head and asked him to wait a moment as she went and conversed with the receptionist. She then motioned for him to follow her as she turned towards the lifts. As they waited, he looked up and was mildly startled to see a large, green plus sign floating just below the ceiling and revolving slowly.
"Potter?" someone said again, and he coughed in reply.
He inhaled deeply, enjoying the pressure along his temples and the back of his head, and the dull throbbing in his head continued to recede even as Malfoy proceeded with his ministrations. He could feel the cool silk of the blond's robes gently caress the back of his fingers, making him relax his grip on the armrest.
“That still doesn’t explain why you chose me.”
Potter chuckled, a small, hollow sound, and Draco swallowed, feeling a lump form in his throat. This man, that had supposedly saved the wizarding world, exuded so much sadness and misery that it made Draco want to curl up and cry.
"Go back to bed," he told her, when she looked like she wanted to say something else. Whether it was his expression or his tone of voice, or whatever else, she simply nodded and moved towards the door.
"You're terrible, all of you," she sniffed as he signed off the second letter, still chuckling.
She pulled him into a hug, and he laughed as Lily whined about being squished. "I'm here. Where're the rest of the kids?"
"—and that's why I really wanted—
There was a heavy silence from the other side of the door, and Harry couldn't help but feel pity for the blond. After the huge fight with Ginny, he could empathise with the sticky situation Malfoy was in. Taking another step back, he was just about to head towards the sofa when Astoria's trembling voice seeped in through the crack in the barely open door.
He shifted, and she noticed the rather large box in his hands. With an exclamation of delight, she spun around and strode up to him. She reached for the box but left her hands hovering inches away from it, eyes wide and shining. "Is this it? The unattainable vase of purity?"
"I'm sorry," Potter said, "for rejecting your friendship so many years ago. I didn't know better."
Draco's smile was wry. "Technically, I'm the villain in this story because I'm the one that stole Astoria from Blaise and married her. He's been in love with her for decades, and, being the cold-hearted narcissist that I am, I pretended that I believed his hesitation to be indifference and took her for myself."
He fingered his wand inside the sleeve of his coat and brought down the glamour on his face as he pretended to peel off a mask. The boy's eyes widened and he took several steps backwards, looking frightened.
He was going to lose sleep thinking about what to do with the vase, he had no doubt. His initial plan was to put it back, but he didn't want it to get stolen again. The German Ministry had refused to divulge any information as to why the perpetrators had been after the vase or why they had murdered people for it. No matter how much they apologised for the trouble caused, they were very tight-lipped over the matter, and the DMLE had given up rather easily, saying it wasn't their problem anymore. They just wanted Harry to get the vase out of the Ministry so they could tie the whole thing up in a nice, big bow.
"It's a drawing of a vase, sir."
he told himself firmly.
Shaking the feeling off, I let him lead the way, and we walk down to the little park nearby. We find a spot, Harry begins to unfurl a picnic blanket, and I'm left feeling disconcerted.
"We could, but…"
on it, and a whole bunch of other stuff he recognised and those that he didn't.
He couldn't—he didn't—
Harry had thought it was one of the wisest things that had ever come out of Ron's mouth
"Been having a tough week at the office," he murmured as he sipped the scalding liquid, revelling at the burn in his throat.
Malfoy bowed his head. "I have an idea, if you would like to hear it."
He stared at his son's head and sighed. Well, this was what he got for not spending enough time with his kids.
on him, haven't you?" was Weasley's latest way of getting in Draco's face.
had erected around him hummed when he touched its surface, and he sighed.
He had walked quite a bit, and just when he realised that he had absolutely no idea where he was, it started to drizzle. Cursing under his breath, Harry quickly jogged to a nearby florist's shop and took shelter under the canopy. Checking his watch, he decided that he could afford to wait for the rain to stop since he didn't really have anything planned anyway. After a while of staring at the grey sky, he pulled out his phone and turned it on.
"I loathed you and found it completely unfair that you got to survive time and again when so many innocent people had died. That you walked to your death and came out alive when hundreds of others never had that choice. That you could stand there, looking like a martyr, when I could still feel the warmth of my brother's blood on my hands. And I could only think of one thing: why you? What made you so special? Why did you get to escape death so many times? You, an ordinary boy with no extraordinary talent or powers, who was standing there and promising a world with no war as though you were our messiah
Malfoy's expression sobered down. "That is a legitimate concern—one that I'm hoping will end in the same way you want it to: with me being your Healer. But we can set that aside for later. For now, why don't we talk about you?"
"What's this?"
"Wake me in an hour," he called over his shoulder as he walked to the stairs.
As they got their food and sat down at whatever table had empty seats, Draco asked, "What about Weasley?"
Padma frowned, and the men behind her shifted again. "Head Auror Potter," she snapped, the coolness of her voice sending a shiver down Harry's spine. "That man is under investigation for murder, and yet you insist that he's innocent even though he is the primary suspect in your case."
"Are you alright?" Malfoy asked gently. "You don't have to speak about it right now if you don't feel like it."
"I'm your husband; that's what I do," he said, raising his mug in a toast.
He nodded as Hermione placed a steaming cup of tea on the table and eased into the chair across from him.
you'll be back?"
Harry rolled his eyes as he walked to his desk and sat down on it. "Look, I know it seems mental—"
The moment Harry awoke, the first sensation he felt was the sharp stab of hunger. That instantly brought on memories of starvation and the metallic taste of toffee wrappers, and his eyes flew open as he gasped for breath. He was greeted with the unfamiliar sight of a dark, starry ceiling and a strange, silky material beneath his palms. He turned to the left and saw some sort of wooden partition that had intricate carving on it, and to his right was a bedside table, atop which were his glasses, and a weirdly shaped candle that smelled unbearably sweet.
"Is that right?"
Harry scoffed in disbelief. "You say that so nonchalantly that I almost believed this had nothing to do with you for a second there."
"Not much?" she said as she teetered and fell against him with a giggle.
If I could go around talking about it, I would've."
"Oh, no, I just asked. You said a
Harry took most of them from Ron and dropped them on the table and chairs, peeking into one out of curiosity. "Ron…is this what I think it is…"
"You seem surprised to see me," she said, drawing him out of his thoughts, and Harry grunted.
"I was hoping you wouldn't say that." Harry sighed.
"Sure you're alright with me leaving them here for an hour or two?" he muttered to Ron as the latter came up to him.
"I heard that!" she calls as she pulls open the front door, causing the doorbell to chime. "And I'll be dropping by again next week. To buy a bouquet, of course!"
"So, how are you? How was work? Did you finish that thing you had?"
"Before that, Mr Potter, have you eaten?" Malfoy asked.
"Mr Potter?"
Harry had been ready for some sort of entertaining reaction or the like from the man, but Buxley's attention was fixed on Liz.
Harry rolled his eyes as he watched Kingsley's glistening purple robes disappear around a corner. He was about to close the lift's doors when Hermione came running towards him. She made it just as they shut and exhaled loudly, putting her hands on her knees.
The blond poked Harry's forehead, where a lightning bolt-shaped mark was engraved into his skin. "This, this. Your tattoo."
He threw his head back and howled, loud and hoarse, sounding like an animal in pain. When he opened his eyes, he only saw a face whose decaying flesh slipped from its bony form. When he dropped his hands from his ears, he only heard the screams for help or the wails of the dead. When he stopped scratching his arms and legs, he only felt the invisible snakes crawling under his skin.
"See, aren't you glad you didn't cancel this trip?"
Rogers stared at him wide-eyed before saluting again. "Yessir!"
to take charge of it. Under my supervision, of course."
"Sorry, that was my deputy," Harry said as he returned to take his seat across from Malfoy.
"Why? Fleur'll be staying till next weekend, right? Why not just let the kids spend time with little Lou and Nicki? They'll have nothing to do at home, anyway, and you'll have more peace of mind that way."
She smiled, a genuine, teary smile, and said, "I suppose I just wanted to thank you. I suppose that's what made it so easy for my parents and brothers to follow after you without even the slightest inkling of a doubt."
Harry laughed. "It is." He looked up at Draco. "I'm sorry I kissed you. That was uncalled for."
"Shite," he swore, as he repeated his message, only to receive more crackling in reply.
They grinned sheepishly, and Harry cut the call, suddenly reminded of the picture of him and McGonagall, and her words on the back of it.
"Good afternoon, my love," her cheery voice said in his ear, and he couldn't help but smile, glad she was in a good mood.
Potter looked up at him, his eyes glazed and his expression empty, and Draco faltered. Ever since they had returned to Hogwarts for their eighth year, Potter always wore that expression. As though he was disillusioned from everything in the world and nothing mattered anymore. It was rather heartbreaking. But mostly disturbing.
Sidestepping, she tightened the grip on her wand, ready to lash out a few curses, but there was a sudden explosion from behind her, causing her to pause and look over her shoulder. Squinting into the darkness, she tried to gauge the distance between her and the rapidly spreading fire.
"Oh, the wizard in charge of the west gate just appeared with a whole battalion of guards. They're sending away the crowd. I'll be able to go in once the guards are sure no one managed to sneak in."
Draco's eyes were wide and glistening with unshed tears as he whispered, "They found Scorpius? They found my boy?"
"Fiddlesthicksh!" Lily chipped in, following after her brother.
He shook his head. Maybe he was just reading too much into the whole thing. There was a lot of background noise on Angelina's side, so she could have been out, which meant that maybe she was using a borrowed phone or a payphone because she didn't have her phone on her…
"Oh, yes, let's!" Hermione clapped her hands together. "I heard about this little place that I think you'd really like, Harry," she continued, dragging the two of them along.
They nodded fervently, and Harry smiled as James reached for his siblings' hands and squeezed them. "Good. Jamie, I trust that you'll keep an eye on your brother and sister?"
He nodded and walked towards the house, running a hand through his short hair. It was so much easier to handle with it short, and he always wondered why he never bothered doing it before.
"That contains the instructions for your task plus extra sheets for you to write down whatever is required," Malfoy replied, pointing at the folder. "We generally provide an Anti-Cheating Quill to some of the clients just to encourage them to be truthful, although they don't necessarily have to use it, but I don't think that's needed in your case."
He couldn't help but grin at that. It had been a while since the feisty Ginny he'd married had resurfaced over the rather stressed out, easily angered one she had turned into lately.
“You don’t have to force yourself to behave in a certain way around me,” Potter said. “And you can reject this proposal if you want; I didn’t make the offer to chain you down but because I hoped you would accept.”
"Gin, I can't hear you! There's too much noise!"
Lily?" Albus demanded, looking up at Harry with an angry frown. "
job on the line to close
"He's home early," Hermione said as she stood, making for the door.
Both children started talking at once, and he nodded, barely listening to whatever great crime Lily had committed that James couldn't forgive.
James jutted his chin out and promptly went, "Little Lou!" earning a smack on the head from the older boy.
"So," he started as she downed her drink in one shot. "I was thinking we really should spend this week away from home like we'd planned. Take the kids out. Have some fun."
Harry watched as the cameras flashed away, a pale-faced Draco standing before the fireplace his son had disappeared in, the bloody message above his head glistening. Draco looked overwhelmed, nauseous, even, after his powerfully worded warning taunting Macnair to come after him, and Harry was glad the interview was over. As the reporters thanked the blond and began to clear out, Harry walked up to Draco, who was standing stockstill, his eyes wide and unblinking.
"I suppose it makes it easier since I haven't signed an official form naming her my healer," Harry said.
"Oh, please," she scoffed. "As if there's a season to prank."
"Well, my name is Draconius, and I am the crown prince of this realm," the blond explained, moving away and making another sweeping gesture with his arm. "But please," he held out a hand and Harry took it without a second thought, "call me Draco."
"Alright, alright, let's not get too excited. How about you tell me who all live in this kingdom of yours," Harry said, picking up a leaf-flag and sticking it on one of the mounds.
"Do…Do you mind if I drop by your bakery later today to grab some?"
Another morning, another bus ride.
He chuckled. "Yeah. Do you wanna maybe let me walk you out, now?"
"Why can't you fall asleep here?" Draco asked despite himself. He had divulged a little too much of his best kept secrets to the other man over the past two days and thought it right that he get a few juicy tidbits in return.
"What d'you mean what's going on, mate?" the ginger snapped, throwing his hands in the air. "I
"Jamie! Al!" came Ginny's voice as she stepped out of the fireplace.
means something in this line of work," Malfoy said matter-of-factly, and Harry bristled.
The two of them looked up to see Neville slowly rise to his feet. "I think I'm gonna give them my statement and then take my leave."
shook his head. "Like I told your colleague, I make it a point to keep my personal and work life completely separate." He sighed. "But, considering how alike we look, I've received compliments in the past on how handsome my son is on the rare occasions that Scorpius has dropped into my office."
family just to babysit
"Robards asked me to give these to you. He and the team are ready for you, Harry," she said in a clipped voice, and Harry sensed her anxiety.
He was just about to return to his study when Lily grabbed his shirt.
He nodded. "Nightmares, mostly."
Draco looked up from the book he was reading as Hermione stormed into the room, slammed the door shut, shrugged off her coat, kicked off her boots, and collapsed on her bed.
"It is a wonderful, powerful name."
"Yes, you are. Look, I don't keep pushing you about your cases, do I? So why is it that you're suddenly so interested in what work I'm doing?"
“Anyway, Potter—”
Malfoy's jaw was set, and he looked like he wanted to argue, but Harry was adamant. The conversation about the vase had allowed him to realise several things, one of which was that he had, in fact, decided for Malfoy to be his Healer so that they both could benefit from it, but also because he didn't want their relationship, or lack thereof, to remain as it was: stagnant and unmoving. He had contacted Antares with one purpose: to find respite from the madness growing within him and swallowing him whole, and he had come to the realisation that fixing something that should have been fixed a long, long time ago might just be the first step to that.
"Camberwick Green doesn't exist," the forensics team head said on Harry's behalf.
Audrey shrugged, sipping her tea. "It's all rather hush-hush, but since I used to be a division head in the Department of Magical Education, I still get updated on the latest news and whatnot."
"Are you done?" Hermione asked.
"Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!" the lad yelled, getting to his feet and running towards where the rest were trying to steady the anchor, slipping and almost falling over in the process.
Buxley is incapacitated, so someone needs to take charge of the vandals case; Harry receives a call from Ron saying Harry's kids are at his place and they seem homesick; Harry drops by Silver Sprigs Pre-school to have a chat with Audrey; and Ginny and him can't seem to have a conversation without it turning into a row.
"Wow, who would've thought I'd have Harry Potter as my own personal bodyguard. Wait 'til my father hears about this," Draco said sarcastically, to which Harry rolled his eyes.
"Professor Greengrass, it's such an honour, as always, to be working with you. And, of course, Mr Malfoy, such a pleasure indeed."
"Look at you, being all dad-like." Harry grinned as he took the mug of hot tea Ron held out to him.
She paused again, and Harry wanted to tell her to hurry up and skip to the important part, but now that she was talking, he didn't want to interrupt, lest she stopped.
"Any chance I'll get to speak with him?" When Harry shot him an incredulous look, Neville held his hands up and nodded. "Thought as much."
"Thinking," Harry said, shivering and pulling the coat close around him.
He scoffed at that. "Yeah, well, considering it's him,
"I propose that you allow Erhard to return to Germany a free man, in exchange for which he will give you all the information you need to not only catch my parents' murderers, but also the underground gang of black marketers and dealers that you have been hunting for years."
*What Harry means by the pre-school in Diagon's not as close for Ginny and him is that they live in Godric's Hollow (according to me, anyway), so going back and forth between the two places is a pain. Especially since there's three kids, so Side-along Apparition isn't always a very viable option. Just wanted to clarify that in case you guys are wondering how that's possible since the Ministry's in London (Harry can't keep leaving his job to check on the kids like Ron usually can). That's all.
Draco stopped just then, and Hermione turned to look over her shoulder. She swiped her sleeve across her face and shot him a small smile, sniffling as she stopped crying, but her dark eyes still looked immensely sad in the blue light of her wand.
Draco rose to his feet, walking away from the chattering witches, his heart racing from what he had heard.
"Yeah," Harry said, turning to look straight ahead. "A smile."
"Harry? What's wrong?" she rasped, her words thick with sleep.
His partner whistled and scratched his head. "At the station. Their getaway car broke down and the bloke that offered them a ride drove them straight over to us."
?" He looked around at the agitated faces. "What is this?"
He bit back a sigh as he steered her out of the study. "All right, come on, let's get you to bed."
"You probably don't remember," she said as she waved her wand, and the procession of books that had followed her into the room slammed down on the desk. Harry sat back and coughed, eyeing the worn spines apprehensively. "But back when we were in Hogwarts," Hermione continued, patting the topmost book, "I was reading the original version of
Harry grunted as he pulled off his coat and uniform jacket, turning in a slow circle as Neville, and a few others, helped warm the wet Aurors.
They were a match made in heaven, and that was all there was to be said about it.
His original plan had been to go camping, but Ginny had instantly opposed the idea with a very valid argument—the kids would
She hummed softly, and he leant his cheek against her head, sighing as he let his eyes slip shut.
"It's not," Neville said a little too quickly. "It's not." He sighed. "I just—it's just—I don't know. I still go visit my parents and watch them flounder around as they unsuccessfully try to grasp at reality and I just… I just wanted to see it with my own eyes. I just want it to be over, Harry, all this pain and suffering… I just want it to end."
He Apparated home, directly into the cellar, and hoped his parents wouldn’t notice he was back. Picking up a bottle of Firewhiskey, he popped the cork and took a long swig, hissing at the familiar burn that trailed down his throat.
seem to be under the misconception that he's guilty," Harry replied just as evenly.
"I would
"Not even the slightest clue?"
"Yes. Thank you for getting it so quickly. Now, can you leave so that I can—"
"Since they're all… dead or rotting in Azkaban, we thought to look at families of people who knew you and had lost someone during the war." Harry paused as he rummaged in his pocket and pulled out a torn piece of paper. "And, surprisingly, we found one name that fit both bills."
Harry watched as the Muggle passed the turn the boy had taken and breathed a sigh of relief. Looking around quickly, he bowed his head and strode down the street, turning left where the boy had. His heart was racing, and he felt conflicted. The child had obviously stolen the bread from the store—a rather brave crime to commit with so many people around—but thinking back, he had looked like he needed it more than anybody else.
She sniffed and nodded. Rising up and adjusting her dress, she strode across the room and into her bedroom, ordering the Aurors out and slamming the door in their faces.
Kingsley nodded and then smiled, his gold-capped molars glittering. "Yes, yes, and how did that turn out?"
She shrugged. "I saw it on the menu and pointed at it." He stared at her, and she glanced sideways at him. "What?"
Harry seemed to consider Draco's proposition for a long moment before relenting with a sigh. "Alright. But you have to stay within my line of sight at all times."
he said over and over in his head, but he couldn't bring himself to say it out loud. He felt like he would be insulting her and the memory of her family if he did. So he remained silent, trying to not let the lump in his throat choke him to death as he struggled to hold her gaze. Unable to, he dropped his gaze to his still-full glass of wine and quickly finished it, wincing at the pungent taste in his mouth. The waiter came and refilled his glass, and he quickly sipped from it, feeling the warm liquid gently ease the lump in his throat. He placed the glass on the table and looked up at the waiter expectantly. The man hesitated for a moment before filling the glass once more and walked away before Harry could finish it and demand another re-fill.
"Harry!"
It wasn't a complete lie. They had no idea where he was, so they had no idea if he was safe or not. The people who were after Lisa's life might be after Hertzfeld's, too.
Draco scoffed. “And you chose me of all people to do that with?”
Harry looked around to make sure there wasn't anybody suspicious in the vicinity and muttered a quick
Inhaling deeply, he braced himself, and before he could wimp out again, he turned the picture over. Harry read the lines very fast, and then, realising he hadn't registered what it said, reread them. Percy's message was very formal, to the point, and short.
"Alright, let's get you outta here before you throw up all over the place and incur the wrath of that very unhappy bartender."
Ginny's suspicious behaviour is causing all sorts of thoughts to go off in Harry's head, and just after a pleasant afternoon reuniting with the kids and getting some work done, she stumbles into his study, drunk. Although their banter is affectionate and leaves Harry with warm feelings, a sudden phone call for Ginny from an unfamiliar number sets Harry off once again. What is it that his wife is hiding from him, and how many more lies will they tell each other?
"What the bloody hell…"
"Harry, darling? I think Fleur accidentally stashed a pile of my cookbooks in Ron's room when she was cleaning the attic. Would you be a dear and get them for me?"
standardised in a way, they're also specific to your needs. So, once you've completed the tasks, we'll discuss and analyse them, after which I will decide on the course our sessions will proceed. As for the tests, they're just standardised psychological evaluations that you'll take when you go through the paperwork. I may administer additional ones if I think them necessary, but we can discuss that when the time comes."
Buxley scoffed. "I'll say. When we got that frantic memo from the front desk about some girl threatening to sue the Auror Department for doing a lousy job, I had a feeling she was more trouble than she's worth."
The receptionist nodded, holding the phone out to him. He took the device and placed it on the desk gingerly, staring at it with fascination. He'd heard about the success of the Ministerial Department for Research and Experimentation with regards to discovering a method where they could cross Muggle technology with magical devices without going haywire. Nobody had believed that it was possible, but considering the extent to which both Muggles, as well as magical folk, had progressed in the field of science and technology, it had become a possibility sooner than later.
Harry looked up with a frown. "Malfoy's fireplace? How?"
"That could be it," Draco said in answer to Harry's silent considerations. "But you also claim that you saw what transpired after I returned you to your world yesterday and that my wish that you hadn't left was what brought you back." He moved towards the circle, reaching out one hand towards Harry. "If that's true, then you were somehow tuned in with my thoughts back then, too."
He frowned. "What a load of bull."
"Half past twelve. We've been asleep for a good two and a half hours."
"That's really not good for you," Draco replied, watching with mild amusement as Harry got smacked in the face with the dust cloth.
"Are you, perhaps, Mr Sandford?" she finally asked in her lilting voice, and Harry nodded.
"Please don't cry," he said, reaching up to brush away the tear stains. "It's not as bad as it seems."
"I eat when I'm hungry," Draco groused, but the matron continued to complain about how skinny and unwell he always looked, making Hermione laugh.
He woke up feeling disgruntled and shaken. He didn't really remember all that much about the nightmare, but the lingering emotions that he felt sent shivers down his spine.
Harry waved at the bed, refusing to meet Draco's eyes. "You sleep here. I'll sleep on the sofa."
Malfoy's brows furrowed in the slightest. "No," he said slowly. "Why?"
"Come and get them," he called, and after a moment, Pig raised its head, tilted it, stared at the owl treats, and then flew at them.
Harry blinked, and Lisanna sniffed, glaring down at her reflection on the glass tabletop. "I really
dreams, lately?"
button with his finger. Exclaiming in frustration, he threw his phone across the room and watched it smack the wall hard and clatter to the floor.
"Yeah."
She watched him for a moment longer and then suddenly, so suddenly that it alarmed him, began to laugh. She shook her head and buried her face in her hands as her shoulders trembled with laughter, and when she looked up, tears streamed down her face, her cerulean eyes shimmering.
"After ordering me around, you're
"And Buxley?"
"Can too! I'm sleeping with you, too!" he finally managed, trailing behind his brother.
Harry's eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. He stared at Draco for a long moment before saying, "I can't see any on you either."
"Hey, let me have my moment. Every other tale is about the 'Youngest Seeker of All Time', so I have to make sure I get my time in the limelight."
Pulling back with a coy smile, she waved once, spun on her heel, and strode back the way she had come. By the time Harry glanced down at the file in his hands and back up, she was gone.
While Harry and Ginny were speaking to the distraught woman and were in the process of clearing the confusion, James and Albus had gotten into a fight because one of the older kids had accused them of getting special treatment just because they were Harry Potter's children. That had led to the involvement of more parents, and everything had spiralled pretty quickly from there.
After that, Harry came over to him, looking conflicted. He pulled down the shield long enough to step through it before putting it back up. "We've found that a powerful Disillusionment Charm has been used on some areas of the room," he said. "And considering they're all large, flat surfaces, we think the perp may have left messages."
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed Harry off him. “I don’t partake in childish games,” he said coquettishly. Harry grumbled something that sounded like wuss, causing Draco to tackle him. He pinned Harry beneath him and smirked. “How does it feel like to be beaten by a pretty boy, oh seasoned Auror?”
"'M fine," he muttered, nodding towards the men being arrested. "Where's the rest'a them?"
She nodded in understanding. "I think it's better off that way, anyway."
"Yes?"
"I mean, a
Albus frowned as he considered that and then nodded. "Yeah!"
"Does Ginny know?"
"What's there to sort?" Harry asked, his voice harsh. "Ron's just too immature and petty to believe that Draco and I can be friends."
"Harry?"
"Vase?" Malfoy asked, a curious expression on his face, and Harry grabbed the opportunity to talk about something that wasn't related to him.
"No wonder we never got along. You're such a twat."
"Alright, looks like I've got everything."
He waved to Audrey as he grabbed some Floo powder and ducked under the mantle. The two women stood watching him as the green flames burst around him, engulfing him in their mild warmth.
Malfoy shook his head. "I'm surprised nobody you know has told you this sooner."
mothering me."
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and nodded. "That's true. Have you spoken to them recently?"
Which meant Harry, whom he wanted so badly it was even more painful than his heartache, could never be his. Because he could have no soulmate, which meant Harry would never be his.
"I'll see you around, then, Dan Grant."
"There's nothing simple about your son going missing, Mr Malfoy," Harry said politely, surprised when Malfoy chuckled.
"Yes, we are, Ron's just sulking that
"Why?" the boy asked, pouting. "Uncle Georgie said he'd take us flying!"
"You'd better." Harry picked up the file Hermione had handed him. He flipped through it, scanning the floor plans of Azkaban, the structure of the remodelled boat—whose interiors had been hollowed out and reinforced with enchanted metal—being used to transport them to and from the island the prison was on, the notes he had made regarding the unit's shifts, and other things she'd printed out.
"Harry."
"Ah, that's right!" she rummaged in her bag again, but, after a moment, seemed to realise her search was futile and looked around on his desk. She then picked up his quill, asked if she may use it, and only after he gave her his permission, began to scrawl something on the parchment.
"Sir!"
Before he could stop his son, Albus had already jumped off the counter and was racing up the stairs.
A sudden thought occurred to Harry, and before he could stop himself, he blurted out, "I'm sure all your clients use aliases when they first correspond with you, right?"
Harry started, and then quickly tried to mask his surprise, but Malfoy had noticed his reaction because he had sat up, a knowing look on his face. So, instead, Harry said in a strained voice, "Yes, that would be me."
‘Please be safe,’ she prayed as she made a sharp turn and hid behind the trunk of a large tree.
Harry glanced up to see that Morrison was taking notes and returned his focus to Draco. "Can you think of anybody you know that could've had a hand in this?"
He'd only been ever been to Azkaban a few times: the first time had been to drop off the last set of prisoners after the war and pick up the bodies to be handed over to the families, and the last time was during his exam for the post of Head Auror. He'd almost thought he'd failed, at that stage, but had apparently done far better than the rest of the examinees—much to the surprise, and dismay, of a lot of people.
It didn't matter who they had been or what they had done, he realised, especially after experiencing Malfoy's kindness and consideration. Harry had appeared there at seven in the morning, well before office hours, and Malfoy had absolutely no reason to entertain him. Harry himself had turned away many who had come to the Auror Office before or after working hours, placating them as much as he could and requesting that they return at an appropriate time. After all, if they were to entertain everyone at all times of the day unless it was a serious case, then there was no point in having a designated time period of work. The Auror Office wasn't meant to be treated like a common police station; there were other departments for that.
"Harry, wake up—"
"For you, Gram'ma!"
Draco was grateful. He was grateful, but his mother's death had changed him. Now, every time he saw a tattoo on someone, his heart ached like he was being stabbed. He could no longer ignore them as he had all his life; he could no longer pretend like he couldn't
and you even took time off from work and everything…"
"But how?" Harry asked as he came to take Draco's hand and stand before him. "You said it yourself; you sent me back. And I remember falling through darkness, so—"
"Seriously, quit it," Draco hissed at Harry. "If you're going to keep hitting on me all evening, I'm leaving."
"That means that I can't say anymore than I already have, and if you really want my advice, I suggest you shut this case down immediately and wipe your hands clean of it."

have magic in your blood."
"I'll let him know," Buxley said, his chest swelling with pride.
“Draco!” his mother exclaimed, her eyes widening in horror. “Do not speak like that!”
Padma returned his grin and held out a hand. "It was a real pleasure seeing you again, Harry, despite the circumstances." She jerked her head towards her patiently waiting retinue. "I have to take my leave now, but maybe we can catch up and swap stories over a drink, sometime?" She winked. "And this time, I'll even come all the way to London just for you."
He had then continued to show Harry around the
I grimace, taking his haggard appearance to be a sign that the proposal didn't go well. "Didn't see you on the bus today," I say lightly, unwilling to be the one to open Pandora's box.
“So, I’m taking that as a yes.”
"I can't reveal the name of my healer, Harry, that takes away the whole purpose of it. Besides, the place I chose to go to has a very strict confidentiality policy. They'll know if I've disclosed the name of one of their people."
"Alright, alright, I understand," Harry said quickly, motioning for her to sit down. "I'll help you, but I need you to tell me
Moving around the room, he picked up his wand from the bedside table and waved it, muttering spells under his breath. The lamp fixed itself and carefully stood back in its original position. The pillows sewed themselves back together, stuffing and all, and flopped on to the bed. The scratch marks in the carpet and the walls slowly disappeared, and he looked around the room.
When Hermione entered the living room, she looked far more relieved than any of them.
He almost told her for a second there, about everything, but something stopped him and he shook his head, forcing a smile onto his face. "No, there isn't. I'm just being my usual paranoid self. Anyway, I'm going to go make sure the kids haven't caught a starfish and made it their pet or something…"
"Fantastic, thanks." He took the teacup and sipped, enjoying the warmth and mild flavour. "You were right. Yesterday's massage really helped. I can't remember the last time I slept so soundly."
"Sounds fantastic." She smiled. "So, tell me more about what you lot've been up to. Percy and I are rather out of the loop, I must say, what with him nearly living in the Ministry and me having to handle more than enough kids on a daily basis, although I try to keep in touch as regularly as possible..."
thing
Harry scoffed and then sighed. "Who did you go see? And how come this is the first time I'm hearing about this?"
He watched Albus make a flag with leaves and hand it over to Lily, who promptly broke it. "Did they eat their breakfast yet?" Harry asked.
"Don't you think, even for one second, that I did this for your sake
A token of one offering their undying feelings to another.
She looked at him with a sort of sad expression in her eyes, and he felt guilt well up in him. In all honesty, he
"Stop it, Ron," Granger scolded as Weasley swore. "I brought him so you could sort this out once and for all."
Ginny shook her head. "No, she just knew about me coming back early, so she only agreed since I promised her she wouldn't have to miss out on going to the carnival. Ron was a right git about the whole thing, though."
"It's good to see you, Molly," he said as he hugged the Weasley matriarch awkwardly around the boys.
"Take care of yourself."
"You said
The door cracked open, and a short, squat brunette witch poked her head out. "Yes?"
She made a frustrated sound and pressed her handkerchief to her cheeks. After a moment, she started to say something else, but a sudden thought struck Harry.
Neville nodded, his jaw clenched. "Yeah, I know."
"Hermione…" Harry groaned, and she smacked him in the chest.
"Isn't it a bit too late, then? If the auction is in two days."
go with her family in order to come with him?
"It was my pleasure."
He hadn't expected the confrontation to be literal until he found himself standing face-to-face with none other than his second worst nightmare: Harry Potter.
"This is only a theory, but if you didn't pass through the portal to your world, then you must have been stuck between both realms, which explains why you could tap into my thoughts or were summoned back by my wish—I was the sole string that kept you tethered to reality, and a slight tug in my direction caused you to topple back into this realm."
The burly interrogator roared, slamming a fist on the hardwood table. "
Harry excused himself and walked to where his deputy was giving two other Aurors some instructions. Once they were gone, he jerked his chin towards Lisa and said, "She's hiding something."
