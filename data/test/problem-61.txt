Lucius’s legs had been damaged during his short sentence in Azkaban, and his mind sometimes lost the plot as he blacked out from time to time. But during his moments of clarity, he gazed lovingly at his wife and son. During the meal, Narcissa asked Harry basic questions about his work, family and aspirations while Lucius listened quietly and only spoke after the last course was over. He asked Harry why he had chosen his son.
to stay, but now that I'm here, I want to. You have a neat shop. Whatever you're working on smells nice."
. He had come to campus that morning with Pansy, Blaise and Theo but the three of them went to Arts School, leaving him to face Business School in his lonesome. Not for the first time, Draco wondered if he had made the right decision in letting his father dictate his education.
He hastily patted his chest, stomach, arms, and thighs. Aside from his eyesight and scars, his physique was unchanged. He still wore the same uniform he had on at St Mungo’s before he blacked out.
“You mean you don’t drink alcohol?” When Draco nodded, Potter added, “You know they also serve things like sparkling water and soda, right?”
The sound of running water stops, followed by the creak of a door opening. Draco Malfoy steps out in pants and a bathrobe, fresh from a shower.
“And we have mated,” Draco announces flippantly, fingers typing briskly on his panel. “Let’s drink to a pleasurable coupling.”
“I know you’re doing this to protect me,” Malfoy says later when they are both recovering from their highs, his back against Harry's chest. “I think… I don’t care anymore. I’m more worried about you, though.”
Harry was out, facing the world and its terrifying people and Draco could not help but admire his courage.
No. He wasn’t losing this. He had found something that he liked, not because someone told him to, but out of his own volition. He wouldn’t let anyone make him stop.
Draco lobbed the ball at Greg, who jumped high, grabbed it clean off the air and turned mid-leap to dunk it into the basket. While the crowd cheered, Draco went up to Smith and sneered right at his face.
Ron returned from the kitchen with a glass of water. He sat beside Harry but didn’t say anything. He appeared to be waiting for something.
On the day of the Hogsmeade trip, Malfoy doesn't turn up. Neville cackles at the look of utter despair on Harry’s face.
Potter apologised for sixth year, for the scars on Draco’s chest, for failing to help when he could’ve.
Harry looks up at the screen and gawks at the large green planet that now dominates their view. The planet wasn’t there before. The incoming fleet of enemy ships is nowhere to be seen. The debris of the exploded ship has vanished.
The potion tasted as sour as the day before. Luckily, Draco had a glass of water on hand this time. He washed the potion down and refilled the glass with
He had it all planned out in his head. He’d probably need a drink or two first, okay, but he is still a Gryffindor at heart and he is going to sweep Malfoy off his feet.
With a grunt, Harry tucked away his wand and trudged across the muddy soil until he reached more solid ground, taking note that Draco was also moving in his direction. “Saving your arse, obviously. What the fuck were you thinking? Sending your soul to another dimension?” Harry shrieked. “Where the hell are we, anyway?”
“Please refrain from breathing down my neck, Potter,” Draco remarked coolly. “Unless you’d like a front seat to the explosion that’s bound to happen if you distract me. In which case, do go on.”
Harry is surprised, but his reaction is minute compared to Malfoy's. The blond's eyes widen at his own words and his face turns red.
and its crew, having known so much about Captain Malfoy already. However, he didn’t know that the older Captain had such a personable and intelligent son.
As Draco sat on the bench, wiping his face with a towel, Harry felt himself growing restless. He had a nagging feeling in his gut that had begun during the first quarter, after only several minutes of observing Draco’s movements. Now with Draco out of the game, Harry couldn't stop himself. He needed to talk to Draco immediately.
He spent a lot of time catching up with Hagrid and Headmistress McGonagall, until they excused themselves, the Headmistress saying she was getting too old for late-night partying.
They agreed to meet at the library on Thursday afternoon. Harry gave his house’s landline number, along with tidbits about his housemates, which confused Draco because he never asked for this information.
In the kitchen, they sat together on a wooden bench, surrounded by treats and desserts. Potter talked openly and happily, as if enjoying Draco’s company. He remained this way — treating Draco in a friendly manner — until they reached Draco’s private dorm. He was the only Slytherin who had returned for Eighth Year so he had a room to himself.
It didn’t take much for Harry to convince Hermione to go to the Hogwarts-Rosenberg practice match with him. Hermione was a diligent student and spent any free time studying or revising, but she always remembered to make time for her best friend-slash-boyfriend. In fact, despite not playing any sports herself, Hermione had a good understanding of the mechanics of both basketball
Harry straightened and gently tucked Draco’s silky hair behind his ears. “I know. I won’t steal his star player.” He touched Draco’s earring, something he had always wanted to do but never did until now. He was obsessed with it.
“I still can’t believe all of you let me go to Business School alone,” Draco remarked indignantly, tying his hair back with a hair tie and using bobby pins to keep it neat.
Draco felt overwhelmed. He barely knew most of these people, he had never talked to them before today, but they treated him like he had always been part of their family. They spoke freely with him, spurting insane amounts of information Draco never asked for, and showing genuine interest in Draco's opinions. Draco struggled to keep up.
“Tuesday is volleyball day,” Draco exhaled, recalling the first day they met. He pressed his face against a cushion, embarrassed. “I’m sorry.”
Madam Pomfrey smacks her lips unhappily. “It appears Professor Malfoy is experiencing some rare side effects of the Anti-Sniffles Potion. This potion is very effective; it can eradicate a flu in just a day, but the side effects of extreme cold, emotional instability and excessive chattiness make it a less desired option than Pepper-up.”
Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t trust himself to be touchy with Malfoy. Only Merlin knows what would happen if Harry puts his hands on Malfoy and — God forbid — Malfoy lets him. Harry’s mind goes down the gutter just thinking about it.
“What do you mean it’s not real?” the voice of Ron Weasley chimed in. “How do you get treated then?”
“How am I supposed to know you expected me to spy on Malfoy?” Ron demanded, keeping his voice low. “I didn’t even know he was in the basketball club until I saw him in the gym!”
“Back then, we were meeting again after almost ten years.” Harry smiles at the memory; he can still remember the forest green robes Draco wore when they first linked eyes in the Great Hall on their first day as Hogwarts professors. “You’re… you’re different now, yet still the same. You still draw me in and capture my attention, and I can’t help but… be obsessed with you.” He chuckles at the last few words, sheepish.
“Harry trained for years to build up his speed and stamina,” Granger remarked, sounding like a proud mother. “I think the game is going to end soon, Ron.”
Draco resisted the urge to bring a hand to his flaming cheeks, and adjusted the heat of the cauldron — it was too hot, that was all.
Harry stopped walking around shirtless after he noticed Draco hiding his flushed face behind an upside-down book.
"I can't say I’m surprised, Harry," said Hermione, her voice clear despite the Bubble-Head Charm. "You have been obsessed with him for almost a decade now."
Harry dozes off at some point, jerking awake at the sound of knocking on the door. He is still drowsy, so he only realises that Draco has walked over to the door by himself and opened it when he hears Madam Pomfrey’s loud exclamation of relief. The nurse trots into the sitting room with Draco in tow.
While Harry hastily parked and chained his motorcycle, Draco unlocked and opened the front door. Pansy had gone home for the weekend, so the house was empty and silent. He waited while Harry fumbled with his pockets and switched his spectacles.
But he can’t help wondering whether Lieutenant Commander Draco Malfoy has ever looked at a man with the same ardour as he does when he talks about pink wheat.
"You mean we can suddenly pass out…?" Harry trailed off, glancing at Draco, who completed the sentence.
Harry’s mind had been filled with Malfoy all day; Malfoy offering to help with his nightmares; Malfoy giving him milk before bed; Malfoy applying medicine on him; Malfoy smiling at him; Malfoy joining him in bed at night; Malfoy being attractive and everything Harry wanted without even trying.
“I carry the most precious cargo in the galaxy,” he snarls, long blonde hair as pale as his bared teeth falling down his back, “yet the Federation sends me a green guard young enough to be my son?”
“And to Draco, without whom we would still be rushing to wrong conclusions,” Harry added with a wink in Draco’s direction. He delighted in the flush that spread on Draco’s cheeks.
"In the same vein, I don't blame you for these scars. I've gotten over that. It was years ago. Worse things have happened since." Draco took Harry's hand away. "It was a war, Harry. We all did things we regret. Have you forgotten that you saved my life? Multiple times?"
has been flying on the fuel made from the Faith Seeds for a couple of months now, and judging from the ledgers, there haven't been any problems so far.
"Let's go to St Mungo’s," Harry said, holding out a hand to Draco. "Mrs Kelley is getting worse. I'll bring you to her so that you can see the effects of the poison for yourself. It'll help you figure out what’s happened."
At eighteen, his beauty was pristine, as though manufactured. His blond hair was slicked back and glistened like platinum. His clothes were obviously tailor-made for him, though not by his choice. His shirt and trousers accentuated his slim waist and long, slender legs, but he appeared too young in them, like a child wearing a grown-up's costume.
After registering, Draco was instructed to take a seat. The only available one was beside Potter, who now had his gaze fixated on Draco, magazine forgotten.
“Probably nothing. Or everything.” Potter shrugged. “Depending on whether your soulmark has anything to do with me.”
When they reached the pavement in front of his house, Draco took his time getting off the bike, purposely letting his hands linger on Harry's muscles. After he returned the helmet, he took several steps to the door before turning back to Harry.
Draco sighed; the sound of his breath was so close, Harry felt his ear grow warm. "Why do you always say incredibly nice things?"
It takes a long time for Malfoy to open the door; he clearly hasn’t been expecting visitors. When the door finally creaks open and Malfoy’s flushed face peeks through the gap, Harry’s heart feels like it is being impaled by an arrow.
“Tried that. Turns out I’m allergic to them. My eyes were red for a week.” Harry flinched at the unpleasant memory. “Anyway, do you always play basketball alone?”
He allowed himself a glimpse of Potter’s happy grin before he headed out, stifling a smile of his own.
The kiss ended too soon. Draco opened his eyes, found himself staring into green eyes and realized that either of them could end this right here. They could pretend the kiss never happened. But who was he kidding? This was Harry Potter, and he was Draco Malfoy and they were always going to gravitate towards the other.
Harry smiled apologetically. "You still have the second half to catch up. I've been watching you closely, and I think I know how you can turn this around and start getting your shots in."
"You're the best," Harry exclaimed, grinning. Harry hated paperwork, and Malfoy was excellent at it, so he always entrusted it to Malfoy. "Oh, I forgot to ask her about the Quidditch World Cup!"
When Snape told the first years to make groups of three, Draco immediately grabbed Greg and Blaise. Theo ended up with Weasley and a boy with dirty blond hair named Anthony Goldstein.
Too soon, Malfoy pulls back, grey eyes curious and dark as he licks his lips, probably unaware of the effect that small action had on Harry. “It tastes like fresh apples and vanilla. What is that?” He demands, referring to the cigar but staring into Harry’s eyes. “Does it contain Amortentia?”
Draco summoned back his pillow, pulled his blanket over his head, and ignored Potter until Healer Kim returned with their bags, supplies and Portkey.
Seated on the Chair was a slender young man with short white-blond hair, dressed in the same dark green Starfleet Federation uniform as Zabini, but Harry has never seen legs – crossed gingerly at the knee —that look
“Basketball is a team sport!” he bellowed for everyone to hear, before lowering his voice into a creepy drawl, eyes narrowed. “Learn to work with your teammates or spend the whole semester warming the bench.”
He discovered they were approaching their destination when Ron's red head disappeared into one of the rooms. “Here we are," Harry declared once they entered the lecture hall.
A curious compulsion drove Draco to fold up his right sleeve and present his forearm to Potter the same way.
Draco stayed until the last Junior Auror bid farewell to Harry. He remained on the bench as Harry jogged towards him, his green eyes widening at the fan in Draco’s hand.
“Weasley,” he croaked, slightly out of breath. “During our first game, when you said I wasn’t as fast as
There is so much to unpack that Harry doesn’t know where to start. He is still reeling when he replies:
Harry emerged from the kitchens, grinning widely when he saw the two new guests. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and practically hauled him as they both approached the two men. Harry only let him go in favour of throwing his arms around the tall brown-haired gentleman with thick black-rimmed glasses.
Draco gazed forlornly at the device resting against Harry's chest. "Well, it's not typical to find oneself in a limbo world and needing to be rescued, is it?”
When the professor turned to draw on the blackboard, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed, halting the erratic tapping. Draco quickly looked at him and opened his mouth, but Harry hushed him, nodding at Professor Scrimgeour, who had faced the students again.
Draco's kiss made Harry's body sing, and as his hands brushed the flawless skin on Draco's back, Harry wished for this harmony to never end.
They took turns casting spells to try to transfigure the bed into two single beds, but the bed seemed to repel any magic cast on it. Malfoy even tried to make the bed wider, but that didn't work either.
Draco kept his eyes on the professor’s ruler, ready to evade in case it strikes again, but the Professor walked away with a huff. Draco turned and saw the bespectacled guy from earlier sitting to his left.
“Er, no?” Harry stammered and discreetly wiped his sweaty palms against his joggers. Malfoy was still holding his head. “Like a… purple pustule?”
Harry laughs. Now with both hands free, he skates his palms down Malfoy’s sides and up his back, pleased when Malfoy lets him. “Yeah. Do you like it?”
Healer Kim's head disappeared into the fire. Shortly after, a leather briefcase shot out of the fireplace and landed on the coffee table. The briefcase bore the Auror Office insignia.
“Oh God, Harry, what did you tell Malfoy that changed the second half so much?” Hermione asked, eyes wide.
“I’m flattered you care about me, Potter,” Malfoy interjects, but then squeaks and turns his face toward the mattress.
Malfoy grabs something from the coffee table — his new elm wand — and casts a Tempus. “Soon.” He glances at Harry through narrowed eyes. “I don’t want you around when I take it.”
They opened the parcel together after Healer Kim’s review. They sat side by side on the couch, a full English breakfast laid out on the coffee table. The Auror Office had compiled all letters and packages for the two of them and delivered them in one bundle. Ron had sent Molly’s cookbook as promised, together with letters from his entire family. Hermione, Luna and Neville wrote their own separate letters. Seamus and Dean sent ‘Get Well Soon’ cards. Teddy had written a letter for Harry and Malfoy each, something Harry could see Malfoy being incredibly touched by. Malfoy received letters from his mother, Andromeda and Parkinson.
“I can’t keep you here anymore,” Draco says. “If you want to return to your quarters and get ready for your classes tomorrow…”
Madam Pomfrey said nothing, but quickened her pace. Draco could feel the warmth of her cheeks against his throbbing cock. Each time her nose reached his pubes, she gave a wet, gagging noise that bounced off the four walls of the hospital wing. He knew that she was only just managing to fit his whole length in her mouth.
‘Here, why don’t we get those off,’ said Draco, jumping forward to help pull of Harper’s Slytherin robes. The boy made no objection, and in fact seemed to enjoy the sensation of Draco’s hands brushing up against him.
‘Do you want to watch me wank?’ he said. His cock was now so hard that it was beginning to cause him pain. When she gave yet another nod, Draco pulled down the thin white sheet that had been covering his lower body, followed by a pair of dark green boxers made from satin that shimmered brilliantly in the light. His boyhood sprung to life at once, throbbing in anticipation.
Draco didn’t wait for further instruction. Jumping at the chance, he went and stood at the end of the desk that the boy’s head was resting on. Still slamming his right hand up and down his rigid cock, he took the left one and rested it on the boy’s face, running his fingers down the boy’s forehead and cute little nose. The tip of his middle finger found the gap between Harper’s lips, and soon half of his hand had found its way into Harper’s mouth, the boy running his small pink tongue between each of Draco’s fingers, coating them all in saliva.
Blaise just tapped his nose twice, and picked up a book from his bedside table. Draco took in the front cover:
On his way back to the common room, Draco, knowing that the common room would surely be flooded with students by the time he returned, had ducked into a dungeon classroom that was sometimes used by Professor Burbage and her Muggle Studies class. True to his hopes, in the store cupboard there was an array of mismatched Muggle clothing. Draco had donned an oversized poncho and a pair of board shorts, the least ridiculous-looking outfit he’d sourced from the collection. It felt unbecoming to wear Muggle clothing, and he had faced several stunned looks from fellow Slytherins as they passed him, but he had a strong feeling that it would’ve been more unbecoming to arrive fully naked and painted with the dried cum of a thirteen-year-old.
But the older boy felt the position wasn’t quite fun enough for him to end it all here. He lifted Harper off the desk, picking him up by the feet, and held the boy’s legs under his armpits, pulling the boy into wheelbarrow. Without warning, he thrust his length back into Harper, and kept slamming his hard cock in and out of the hole. But no matter how hard or fast he fucked the boy, Harper made no signs of wanting it to stop. Draco kept pounding, and now he was reaching his second climax. He thrust himself in one last time, before slipping his cock out and jizzing all over the boy’s underbelly.
‘Your… your cock,’ chuckled the boy, clutching his sides. Draco looked down, then up again. ‘It’s… it’s so…’ he faltered.
He pinched her clit firmly and she gasped. He did it again. Within seconds, he felt the cum dribbling from her cunt, coating the length of his prick, warming it. He slapped his right hand against her arse as hard as he could, knowing that he would not feel the sting. The matron yelped, and he repeated the action with his left hand. This time he felt it, though he knew that the slight tingling sensation in his palm did not compare to the sharp pains he was inflicting upon her supple backside.
‘I think you know why, Mr Malfoy.’ She tilted her head towards him and he raised an eyebrow in response.
‘You look pretty good yourself,’ said Malfoy, and without warning he gently pushed Fred backwards into the water. Fred sat up with his face covered in pink bubbles and spat out a mouthful of liquid.
Rolling over on to his left side, Malfoy traced a finger slowly between George’s pecs and down to his pale torso. It was almost a romantic gesture, he thought. It didn’t take long before George was thoroughly confused, however. He threw the Slytherin a raised eyebrow. Malfoy decided to take things a step further, and he placed his right leg over George’s, practically spooning him. Pulling a sweetly seductive face, he slowly climbed on top of the redhead.
‘Very well,’ she said. ‘That should do the trick. Allow me a minute while I fetch my wand, Mr Malfoy. Roll up your sleeve again, if you please. And no self-exploration whilst I’m gone.’
‘Oh, heavens no. But it would be painful if I were to mend it straight away… very painful, and knowing how you reacted to that silly little hippogriff attack last year-’
‘Come on, Weaselbee,’ teased Draco. ‘Tell me… what exactly have you always wanted to do with him? With your brother?’ Draco walked over to Fred’s body and, kneeling down, stuck his forefinger into Fred’s mouth. The older boy sucked on it obediently, and waves of pleasure ebbed and flowed through Draco’s body, allowing his cock to harden again.
Fred winced as Draco took the head of his cock in his warm mouth. ‘This is so fucked up,’ said the older boy, shutting his eyes tight. Draco rolled his tongue around the uncircumcised head, once, twice, three times. Slowly he took more of Fred into his mouth, using his right hand to stroke the bottom of the shaft, cupping Fred’s hairy balls with his left. By the time the entire length was in his mouth, Draco could feel Fred getting harder. He started to groan around the pale cock, deepthroating it further and further as it grew in size. Fred’s breaths became heavier and more irregular, and Draco realised that the ginger boy was starting to enjoy himself. With a final back-and-forth flick of his tongue, Malfoy pulled away.
After a minute or so, she lowered her wand and darted her eyes quickly towards Draco’s face, eager not to linger on any other part of his body.
‘Then when I asked her about it, she offered for a threesome. I mean, kudos to Goyle for getting his cock into something other than his fat fist, but I didn’t really feel like having his juices all over me, you know.’
yet shagged George. Malfoy berated himself for not having simply fucked the second brother straight away. Why did he waste time and energy blowing him? He wondered now if he would be able to go again, and whether or not George would protest.
‘Well, you know. They… up in the Slytherin dorms, in the younger years, they call you… well, they call you the
‘Or what, Weaselbee? What will you do?’ Draco retorted, pouting. ‘Personally, I think “Fred the Food Fucker” has a
When he finally came, George allowed his eyes to dart back and forth between Draco, whose face was still buried in wiry, auburn pubes; and Fred, who was relentlessly fucking his own prostate with a long and bony finger.
Blaise had turned the whole thing into a game. Each time now that he buried his cock into the cushion, he let out a fierce moan, chanting things like, ‘
‘No, wait,’ said Draco, propping himself up on the cushions as well. He lowered his voice. ‘I was going to tell you… I overheard something when you were away, after the ball. I walked past Diggory on my way out of the Great Hall, and he was talking to Potter about something. About the Prefects’ bathroom, which-’
‘Found it in the Restricted Section yesterday,’ Blaise said proudly. ‘Got a note from Snape. I put a charm on the writing.’
Both dicks were pressed against Fred’s stomach, causing the redhead unspeakable pain that neither of the other two cared much about. They forced themselves in and out, Draco revelling in the pressure applied to his cock from all angles. George could now not only feel Fred’s limp cock pressed against his sweaty body, but he could feel his own cock prodding himself through Fred’s clenched torso. Fred bounced up and down on the two tops, making a strange humming noise, like a muted howl.
This particular weeknight, the two of them were sprawled out on adjacent emerald sofas near the fire in Slytherin common room, each lying on their backs and staring up towards the moss-covered ceiling. Admittedly, in this moment, Draco had tuned out slightly from Zabini’s speech, having become momentarily distracted by the flickering shadows that the fire was creating around the room.
yeah,’ moaned Blaise, milking his cock all over the underwear. ‘There you go. Just so you’ve got something to remember me by, Draco.’ He winked.
She turned away from him but continued talking. ‘I’ve found there is a tendency among boys your age to… well, to get
‘Now it’s probably going to feel a little bit weird the first time,’ Draco added, ‘so you want to make sure you’re as turned on as possible. Picture whatever helps you get off – it can be anything. Chicks in tiny bras, a girl rubbing her pussy in your face, Madam Hooch’s tits, whatever.’
‘Hahaha, shut up you fat cunt. You should’ve just stayed here for the Yule Ball, there was loads of clunge there. You could’ve gotten with Daphne for sure.’
‘Sorry, Professor. I’ll get them back.’ He reached over to the floor and picked up his wand, purposely flexing the muscles in his chest and arms for her enjoyment. Directing the wand at the pile of robes beside his bed, he said, ‘
His voice trailed off as he wrapped a hand around his dick, palming it and stroking softly. He had originally planned to offer the boy somewhat more of an explanation, but the moment he sensed his groin receiving the attention it had been longing for, all attempts to string together a cohesive sentence had been swiftly abandoned.
, thought Malfoy – and the younger boy moaned as he impaled the Gryffindor. He thrust himself up to the hilt of his cock a few times, and then felt the head of another cock waiting outside Fred’s hole. George’s member was twitching in anticipation.
Zabini let out a very deliberate moan as he ground his cock against the cushion this time. Reaching one hand behind him from his plank position, he pulled his pyjamas down just enough to reveal his perfectly shaped arse, and continued humping the cushion, moving his hips faster and faster.
Draco smiled, but before he had had a chance to say anything, Harper had thrown another question at him.
Eventually the sound of students filling the corridors reached his ears, though Draco barely noticed it. There were more important sounds that were far more local: Madam Pomfrey’s moans; the wet noise of his cock pushing inside of her again and again; the echo of him continuously spanking her already-red arse.
‘You needn’t call me that, I’m not a Professor. The potion takes away all sensation from one particular limb; in this case, the arm. Let us say are left alone with your arm completely numb… all alone, Mr Malfoy… what might you do?’
came pretty easily… when you had your eyes on my arse,’ sniggered Blaise. ‘Fine then. How many people do you think you’ll sleep with before I can coerce Daphne?’
Malfoy wanted desperately to complain, but he too was on the verge of an orgasm. Stroking his meat a last few times and lifting his hips up off the sofa, he came three times; the first load shooting past his shoulder, the second landing all over his chest, and the third dribbling down his fist and on to his curly blond pubes. His muscles beginning to relax and his breath slowing, he wiped the cum off his hand and on to his thighs.
After a few minutes of this, Draco decided that it was time to switch things up: he didn’t want to cum too early and miss out on fucking her. He reached out with his left arm and pressed his palm against the matron’s forehead, forcing her away from his cock. Her lips were trembling, and she looked up at him with wide eyes. Glancing down at his prick, he saw that it was covered in a thick layer of her spit. He gripped it at the hilt with his numb hand and continued to play with it.
‘Well, you’ll have to miss your first few lessons,’ she said sternly, though she was holding his wrist rather lightly in her hands. ‘Only because it’s a bad break.’
The two non-Imperiused boys soon developed a constant rhythm, taking it in turns to force the entire length of their pricks into Fred’s tight pussy. As soon as one boy pulled out, the other was already balls-deep. George did most of the work when it came to stretching his brother’s hole; his prick being a couple of inches longer than Draco’s, and his head slightly girthier. He was also positioned perfectly to hit Fred’s prostate, which he managed on almost every thrust. When it eventually felt as though Fred had been stretched far enough, Draco grabbed hold of George’s balls so as to cease their incessant thrusting. George nodded, and together the two of them pressed their cocks together and forced them slowly into Fred’s hole. Fred clamped hard and then relaxed. Malfoy was already whimpering with pleasure, and George gave one of his filthiest moans yet.
For the first few days following his encounter with the third-year, Draco found his evening discussions with Blaise more enjoyable than ever. Around midnight, when everyone else had gone up to their dormitories, the two of them would stay back and lounge on the common room sofas to chat. Blaise’s advances with Daphne were so minor, so trivial, that Draco felt he had the upper hand already by shagging just one person. The idea of sleeping with fifty seemed suddenly far less daunting, despite him having made no efforts to hook up with anyone in the three days that had passed since he fucked Harper.
The funny thing, upon reflection, was that Draco hadn’t even felt anything happening. For about ten minutes after he had revealed to Blaise that his trip to the Prefects’ bathroom had involved more than just a wank, the two of them had wrestled one another in Blaise’s bed – the sort of play-wrestle that they had been partaking in for years, where neither of them intended to seriously hurt the other. The fight had culminated, however, in Blaise pushing Draco from the bed and on to the cold wooden floor. All that Draco could remember was that he had then admitted defeat, and had crawled drowsily back into his own bed. It wasn’t until Madam Pomfrey took a good look at him the next morning that he learnt he had broken two of the bones in his right arm.
He used his good hand to help her to clamber over his legs, and then watched as she hoisted the bottom half of her dark red robes up to her waist. He was pleased to see that her legs were long and toned, and that she clearly used
‘I thought it couldn’t have gone better,’ Blaise retorted. ‘I’ll ask her on a date soon. You should hurry up, Draco.’
She was gazing, a look of terror upon her face, at the door that led to the corridor beyond the hospital wing. Draco whipped his head around to see four green-clad bodies standing, still as statues, in the doorway. Even from where he was lying on the opposite side of the room, he could make out sausage-shaped lumps in the robes of Crabbe and Goyle, who were both so vast that their robes stretched tightly around their waists, forcing their erections to press against the fabric. Behind them stood a pale Pansy Parkinson, whose eyes and mouth were so wide that Draco thought she strongly resembled a common frog, and Blaise Zabini, who was squinting at Draco and Madam Pomfrey with an expression of mingled jealousy and bewilderment.
‘Tell me about it,’ Malfoy responded. ‘You didn’t have to wait up,’ he continued quietly, tiptoeing towards Blaise’s four-poster bed. He didn’t care if Crabbe or Goyle heard him, but he thought it best not to wake Theo.
‘No, thanks to you, it was Pansy. Fucking Pansy. She started giggling and trying to sit next me - DON’T LAUGH, DRACO! It was fucking horrible.’
, Daphne. That’s it baby. Take that big dick,’ and other equally teasing exclamations. Occasionally he would turn towards Draco and pull an ecstatic face, with both eyes closed and his mouth wide open. He knew full well that his friend was enjoying the show, and he revelled in the fact. After a while he made the conscious decision to match Draco’s brisk tempo, fucking the cushion each and every time that the blond boy pumped his hand up and down his handsome shaft. This brought Blaise insanely close to cumming, and after twenty seconds or so of pounding the cushion with his flesh at high speed, his movements finally started to cease.
‘Hey,’ George retorted. ‘It’s not my fault that I get plenty of action. Come on, I was just about to cum again. Please?’
‘Madam Pomfrey…’ began Malfoy, trying to decide how best to win her over. ‘Are you sure I can’t be let out of the hospital ward sooner? Or… could I borrow some potion to take with me, if I used it only at night?’
,’ he muttered, and the loaf that Fred had been plunging his cock into several minutes earlier flew directly into Draco’s hand. ‘Thanks, Potter,’ he said to himself. Wrapping a fist around his prick, Malfoy stroked himself a few more times before long, pearly ropes of cum began to shoot out from his cock, landing all over the bread. ‘Aargh, FUCK yeah,’ he moaned noisily, milking himself of every last drop. Then, turning his wand so that it pointed at Fred’s body, he murmured, ‘
; not to take your robes off!’ she said anxiously, storming towards his hospital bed. Draco couldn’t help but notice that her eyes were glued to his upper body.
As a small amount of precum began to wet his tip, Draco gradually quickened his pace. Before long he was able to ignore the boy’s presence altogether, turning to face the other way and picturing the pleasant scene of his own cock being rammed between Zabini’s buttocks. Once he was suitably close to cumming, Draco reached a finger between his legs and used it to probe the opening of his hole. Digging the finger deeper inside himself, he moved around a bit until he found his prostate, and tickled it gently with the tip of his finger. Then, seconds away from cumming, he heard another sound from the staircase. He snapped out of his fantasy. Opening both eyes and setting his shaft at liberty, he was relieved to see that it was still just Harper. The boy now had both hands covering his mouth, trying desperately to suppress a giggle.
‘Certainly not. Now lie down properly, Mr Malfoy, I don’t have all day. I’ll be back in a moment with the Numbing Draught.’
Draco bent down, placing both of the wands on the marble floor beside him, and turned to look at Fred. Within seconds, Fred had repositioned himself on his back and was probing his hole with the tip of an index finger. Malfoy turned back to George, and slowly took the entire length of George’s member in his mouth. It was already glistening with Fred’s saliva, but Draco could taste the sweetness of George’s precum as well. George placed his hands on the back of the younger boy’s head and began to thrust with more aggression, crashing his manhood into Draco’s warm mouth. His pelvis slapped loudly against Draco’s face, the sound of skin-on-skin echoing through the room.
The Gryffindor robes that George had been wearing swiftly tore themselves from his body, swirling in mid-air for the briefest moment before vanishing completely. In their absence, George was left in nothing but a shirt, tie, and a tight-fitting pair of maroon underpants. He attempted to hide his groin from Malfoy immediately, but the Slytherin boy had already spotted the tip of George’s erect penis poking out from behind the elastic of his underwear. The vanishing robes had apparently knocked the ginger boy’s wand from his hand, and Draco lunged forward to pick it up from the floor. Unarmed and fuming, George put his hands in the air.
‘I recall many a time when students have taken the potion and have later been discovered touching themselves in classes, or else in corridors, desperate to put their numb arm to good use; too self-assured to worry about the consequences. I believe, from what my predecessor once told me, that your father was one such case. He was unable to resist the temptation in the middle of Hogsmeade, I believe. He’d left straight from the hospital wing in a rush to visit the Three Broomsticks with his friends. I’m impressed to this day that he managed to get halfway there before the trousers were finally unbuttoned.’
‘Blaise, I admire your eagerness, but you do know that I’ll most likely be hooking up with someone before midday tomorrow.’
Each evening, he would be all ears for Blaise’s monologue about Daphne, but would follow it with taunts about his own headstart. Blaise would get horny, and the two of them would jerk off before heading up to bed for a few hours’ sleep. It was a great feeling to be ahead of Blaise so early in the game, but Draco was aware that it couldn’t last forever. Even if Blaise happened to fail at getting Daphne into bed with him, the second part of the bet required Draco to finish his shag-quest before the end of the school year – a goal he was beyond eager to fulfil, for he still couldn’t imagine what Blaise might’ve meant by ‘make it worth your while’.
Draco had been so focused on the pleasure that his cock was receiving, his eyes firmly shut in ecstasy, that he missed Fred’s next move entirely. The ginger boy had used all of his force to throw Draco off his back. Malfoy went splashing into the water, and by the time his head reached the surface again there was already a hand on his cock, and a strong arm wrapped around his torso.
‘Shit, Malfoy,’ said the older boy. ‘Not that it makes me any more into this, but you’re proper fit.’ Draco looked down at his body and nodded. The dancing candlelight only flattered his already well-defined muscles; his abs looked smooth and perfect, his pecs taut and his nipples pink.
He directed the fingers on his left hand towards her swollen clit, and began to stroke it forcefully. This seemed to be almost too much for Madam Pomfrey.
Draco could feel himself hardening against George’s leg, and he could feel the Gryffindor responding similarly. When he was ready, he broke off the kiss and lowered himself slightly, his cock positioning itself at the gate to George’s pussy. He raised his right hand to his mouth, spat in it, and rubbed it over the length of his prick.
‘Get on with it then,’ muttered the older boy. Draco came a few steps closer and put his hands around Fred’s cold torso, grabbing him on both sides. He pushed Fred back towards the enormous bath, and sat him down on the marble edge. Then, plying the redhead’s muscled thighs apart, he got down on his knees.
The journey up to the fifth floor was quick and relatively straightforward. Malfoy resisted lighting his wand in case a teacher caught sight of it whilst patrolling a corridor, and instead he climbed the many flights of stairs by the moonlight seeping in through the windows.  When he neared the fourth floor he heard a distinct hiss that would surely be from Mrs Norris, and he lay low for a minute before climbing the last two flights of stairs two at a time.
Draco froze. He did not, at first, recognise the voice of the other Weasley twin. George sounded slightly out of breath, his speech more gravelly than usual, and Malfoy’s initial assumption was that a Prefect – or worse, a Professor – had entered the bathroom. He spun around, his cock quickly softening, to see a tall ginger boy standing alone in the doorway. Draco jumped to his feet, experiencing a sensation that felt almost like déjà vu… hadn’t he himself been standing there several minutes earlier? Originally it had been Fred who had stood fully naked in the middle of the bathroom, but now…
Draco scowled as she left. No longer able to resist himself, he shoved a hand down his robes and rearranged his cock so that it was more comfortable.
‘Won’t work,’ muttered the younger boy. He propped himself up on both elbows, downcast. His eyes caught sight of something then, and an idea popped into his head at the same time that it popped into George’s.
And with that, Draco left the common room, leaving a still-unconscious Blaise on the sofa, and leading the third-year down the stone passage that led to the dungeons corridor. The boy spoke not a word on their journey, nor did Draco particularly want him to. He was far too focused on keeping both eyes peeled in case a professor or student was to walk past and catch him in his birthday suit, with a younger student in tow.
‘Malfoy, fu- fuck me,’ George whispered. Draco slid himself into George’s smooth hole and found it more cavernous than he had expected. He was able to thrust forward with much ease, and soon found himself bucking his hips back and forth at a pace that he could only keep up for short intervals of time. George was panting hard, his arse cheeks red from the force of Draco’s flesh slapping against his own. Draco began taking his dick out completely after each thrust and ploughing it back in on the next, but even that couldn’t deliver the resistance that he needed.
‘Goodnight.’ Blaise had rolled over on the sofa, not bothering in the slightest to cover himself up, and closed his eyes.
‘I meant with magic. We’re… well, we’re trying to make a range of snacks that’ll induce certain ailments, you know, to help kids skive off classes. We’ve almost perfected our range of
, realised Draco post-orgasm, still fumbling with his cock and watching in awe as Harper dragged his little tongue over the floor. Harper was, after all, pretty perfect. The boy’s body toned but cute, young but strangely masculine, Draco rather liked him. And it was a brilliant fuck – he already had the feeling that his cock would ache for days.
‘And what if I do?’ Draco retaliated. ‘It’d give me an even bigger headstart on you. Either way, it sounds like a good place to bust a nut. You coming?’
. He had not yet realised the extent to which his cock was enjoying itself this morning. Unlike Blaise’s member, which was apparently still serenely fast asleep, his own currently stood at full mast, at a perfect right angle to his body, throbbing eagerly as though it were begging for relief.
‘Let’s just say,’ said Draco as they reached their dormitory, himself in search of a clean pair of robes, ‘one down. Forty-nine to go.’
‘-Anyway, what d’you reckon?’ finished Blaise, coming to the close of a rather long-winded sentence.
,’ yelled the blond boy, his wand pointed beneath his armpit. From the sound of Fred’s naked flesh hitting the water, and the slackening of the grip around his waist, Draco knew that his aim had been true. Turning around, he grabbed the redhead’s limp body and pulled it out of the water.
Draco took a step forward and saw that two of the boxes were filled with individually packaged loaves of bread, unsliced like the one in Fred’s hands. The third contained what appeared to be several small, corked bottles.
‘That would be an excellent threat, Weaselbee, if I happened to be at all scared of you. Now… who was it you took to the Yule Ball again? Angelina Johnson? I’m sure
‘Right. Sorry bud.’ Draco’s apology was succeeded by a short pause. ‘You’ve got to admit though,’ he added, ‘she is a
‘Erm… can I… enter?’ he asked the door, hardly expecting it to work. Before he had finished, however, the door promptly unlatched itself and began to swing open, allowing him to see what lurked inside.
The blond boy laughed. ‘Don’t worry about me. You just start preparing that prize you promised me, whatever it is. Besides,’ he added, ‘when exactly are you going to ask her out?’
He couldn’t keep going much longer. There was a tingling in his cock that felt magical. He pulled out of her just in time and erupted all over the matron’s front, thick strands of cum squirting fountain-like up on to her robes.
Draco awoke groggily, groaning into the sofa, and in his half-conscious state he found that he had to wipe a decent amount of sleep from the corners of his eyes before he was able to open them properly. Hardly bothering to stifle a yawn, he noisily mustered the strength to push his top half up off the sofa and on to his elbows. He blinked a few times as he looked around, and was eventually able to locate the other body within the room, sprawled out stark naked on the sofa opposite him.
‘Fred?’ the other boy continued, walking towards his twin. The door to the corridor closed silently behind him. ‘Wh- what are you doing?’
‘Bet you love that, don’t you? All of us boys coming here with Quidditch injuries, begging you to fix us. Bet you wish you could fuck all of us.’
George came first, making a loud and violent noise as soon as his dick erupted. His balls slapped against Draco’s rigid cock, filling Fred with ropes of cum that covered the younger boy’s cock. Globs of it seeped out between the two pricks, and the feeling of George’s sticky fluid running down his shaft was enough to send Malfoy into his own orgasm. The blond boy upped the speed of his thrusts, panting, ‘You like that, don’t you, you little slut? You little Gryffindor whore.’ He came deep inside Fred, his cum far runnier now on his third load that night. Overcome by pleasure, his whole body shuddered. He got a cramp in his feet. After Fred’s pussy had clamped tight around his cock, squeezing every last drop out of it, he lifted the ginger boy off his softening prick and lowered him to the ground.
"Thanks, Ron," Harry said, sweeping the candies and the newly-produced, suspiciously squishy fudge into the pockets of his robes, figuring it would be futile to try and argue against it. "I'd better get going," he said as the chimes died down.
"I know you're in here, Potter," Malfoy finally stated, refusing to take his gaze off of the rolling hills as they sped by. "Your shoe is sticking out."
The Slytherin changing rooms weren't as clean as the Gryffindors', but they felt a little homier-- slightly more worn, with a few silver trophies on a 'bench' that someone had transfigured into a physics-defying broom. Despite never having played Quidditch before, Pansy seemed rather invested in the Slytherin changing rooms, pointing out every tiny piece of history and object of interest.
Harry sighed, trying to push down his emotions. Here he was, once again, outside Platform 9 ¾, preparing for his eighth and final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So much had changed since he had first faced the brick wall. So many people lost. Mrs. Weasley put a hand on his shoulder-- he was staying with Ron, for the time being, seeing as the Dursleys didn't want anything to do with him-- and gave it a comforting squeeze.
"Fancy seeing you here, Harry," a familiar, slightly snarky Slytherin said. Harry turned to see Pansy Parkinson, wearing a Slytherin scarf and two pink clips in her thin hair, sitting just a few rows above him.
Pansy shrugged. "It's in the past," she muttered, even though her tone didn't fit the flippant phrase. "Anyway, I'd much rather we be friends than foes." She cast a hopeful half-glance to Harry.
So Harry and Malfoy don't interact in this chapter, because I felt like indulging myself in the delicious angst of friends arguing.
Luna blinked dreamily up at him, as though Harry had pulled her from some deep thought. "You're not supposed to be here," she stated, although she didn't sound particularly perturbed by it.
"Harry?" Luna asked, looking at him with wide, hazy eyes. "Are you alright? Your head is full of Wrackspurts."
"She goes to Hogsmeade," Harry said, remembering the many late evenings he had spent studying the Marauder's Map, "on Saturday evenings. Filch usually patrols the dungeons around that time. As long as we get the password--"
The younger kids erupted in cheers, and the older ones sat in silence. Every eighth year, seventh year, and a few sixth years hung their heads. One or two had tears in the corners of their eyes. Harry ignored the cheering, picking at a splinter on the wooden table.
"Brilliant," Harry repeated, his voice sounding dull and echoey, fake even to himself. Ron raised a ginger eyebrow at him. "Spent it at the Burrow," Harry elaborated, "without Ron-- the Weasleys--" he sputtered over his words, face growing red as the carriage stared at him expectantly.
"Right," Harry said, raising his hand halfway as a goodbye. Ron pursed his lips into what Harry could reasonably assume was meant to be a smile before taking a few backward steps (he nearly tripped over his robes, which Harry decided not to laugh at), and then scurrying away.
"All right, Harry?" Arthur asked from somewhere behind him. Harry turned and gave a quick nod. Despite the Weasley's kindness, he couldn't help but feel as though he had been burdening them for the past summer. It wasn't exactly easy, living with the Boy Who Lived. Intrusive reporters were constantly bothering them-- even breaking through the Order's warding charms, on some occasions-- and the interior of the house was somber, with Order members entering to give nothing but bad news-- there's been a breakout from Azkaban, Frank and Alice Longbottom have killed themselves, Charlie was mauled by a Hungarian Horntail and no longer has a left arm. It seemed as though wherever Harry went, trouble followed him.
"No need for formalities," she smiled, sliding down the stands. She sat next to Harry, glancing over the Quidditch pitch with a slight scowl.
A tiny smile crossed Ron's face. "Fine. Maybe I will." He stepped forward, and Harry was suddenly reminded of just how tall Ron was. He towered over Harry, and despite his thin physique practically drowning in his robes, the formidable hand clenched tightly around his wand was enough to quicken Harry's heart rate and make him take a step back. Ron seemed to delight in this, smiling wider.
Malfoy laughed, but it was empty of any joy. He stood up, grabbing his trunk from where he had shoved it in the shelves above the seats. "Partially," he said, rolling the inner door back. "And it's also a personal philosophy I have adopted. See you around, Potter."
Then, Harry snapped forward, grabbing Draco by the arms and shoving him to the side, so that he was pressed against the wall between two sinks. Draco's feet scrambled against the slick ground, hands grasping for purchase, as Harry dug one hand, still holding his wand, into Draco's shoulder and wrapped the other around his left wrist.
"You're both being stupid," Hermione said, her voice raising an octave. "Why don't you--" she blinked, as though overtaken by some mysterious force, and smiled. "Fine. I'll see what I can grab."
. After their match, Madame Hooch had given the three of them a long lecture about the use of spells during Quidditch games. She nearly sent them to detention, but, considering that meant a ticket back to Azkaban for Malfoy, she agreed to look past it if they fixed the pitch.
Harry sunk his head down, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands. The names flew around him, guilting him. The parasitic thought, the one he had tried to keep down for so long, re-emerged at that moment--
"You know what the dementors are like, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice wavering a little, growing quieter. Harry could see now, more clearly, the darkened circles under Malfoy's eyes, the slightly cloudy look behind his pupils.
"It's beautiful," Harry said. Indeed, if it hadn't fallen into disrepair, it would be a formidable broom-- sturdy, with wood that had obviously been polished many times, trimmed broom-bristles shaped perfectly for aerodynamics.
"Potter," Draco muttered, his voice shaking with fear, "please." He paused for a second. "You're scaring me, Harry."
He let his mind wander away from the morning, and back to the past, to happier times on the Quidditch Pitch. The first time he caught the Snitch-- nearly choking on it-- and his mind was suddenly brought back to the horrors of the war, the Resurrection Stone, the hopeless way his dead mother looked at him as he walked to his death.
Malfoy looked back down, removing his hand from the graffiti carvings. "Yeah," he replied. "See? Brown drew a lavender flower here." He pointed to a slightly faded drawing in purple ink, on the very corner of the table, signed with Brown in neat handwriting.
At some point while Draco spoke, Potter had rotated his body onto the side, so they were facing each other. The faint moonlight from the windows highlighted Potter's features, his square jaw and broad shoulders. "I'm afraid I do, Malfoy."
“Our mission, you mean,” Draco corrected him as they got ready to return to their office for some last minute preparations. “We’re not going on a holiday.”
“Gentlemen.” Healer Kim raised her hands, palms out in a placating manner. “Calm down. From our assessment, aside from the spores in your system, both of you are perfectly healthy. Your vitals are all stable. Neither of you has any comorbidities or other diseases that could complicate the treatment. After running our tests, my team agreed that quarantine is the best option. Don’t worry, though. You are still under my care. I will review you every morning.”
Harry pondered for a second before throwing caution to the wind. “I've never thought about the way your hair glimmers in the moonlight.”
Much to Harry’s chagrin, he and Malfoy are still in bed, their fronts pressed together as though stuck by glue. Harry is glad that Madam Pomfrey can’t see beneath the covers, where Malfoy’s thigh has slipped in between Harry’s and is dangerously close to his groin. He is still baffled about how he got into this situation or why Malfoy is acting like this. He swallows and hesitantly asks Madam Pomfrey, “So… is he going to be okay?”
They were all at his and Pansy’s house, around the dining table. Greg, Vince and Daphne were on one end of the table, huddled together over a game of UNO cards while Theo, Blaise and Pansy sat close to Draco. Daphne had turned on the radio, which was currently playing
“July thirty-first,” Harry said, turning his body and full attention to Draco. “I saw you yesterday.”
"My friends, the ones who matter, already know." And they are worried about what this arrangement is doing to Harry's feelings.
"I'm going to take a shower. I'll be quick," he adds when Malfoy's shoulders sag. "Sorry. Just bear with it for a while. I'll hug you as soon as I'm done."
“Welcome, Mr Potter!” she exclaimed as though just noticing his presence. “I apologise for my rudeness. Please make yourself at home.”
This turn of events magnified the insecurities Harry had been too afraid to face until now. How could he love someone he had almost killed? How could Draco ever feel anything romantic towards him, after what he had done?
Harry’s mouth quivered with a barely-concealed smile, which he quickly smothered after one look at Draco’s expression. “Ron is taking care of our other cases today.”
Harry, who usually hated getting special treatment because of his popularity, simply nodded and thanked her gratefully.
“Not every night!” Harry corrected. “Just… whenever I’m exhausted or stressed, they come more easily. Even so, I don’t… people can’t always tell when I’m … I mean, I don’t wake up screaming anymore. But it still happens sometimes so I prefer to sleep alone.”
The incident at the apothecary had been a disaster. Harry had woken up at the Emergency Unit of St Mungo’s to the sound of Draco’s screams. His chest felt like it was being ripped apart when he found Draco with his face buried in a pillow while he cried in pain and begged Harry to switch off the lights. Pale hands had gripped his fingers tightly as a Healer wrapped bandages over Draco’s eyes.
Malfoy returned to his spot on the couch with the bag of potions. He took out one of the pink potions, placed a cushion on his lap and patted it. When Harry just looked at him, perplexed, he rolled his eyes. “Lie down. I’ll drop the potion on your pustule. Don’t expect me to believe you can do it yourself, Potter. You almost touched it with your bare hands.”
He then recognised Weasley’s voice, so he dropped the excessively polite act. “Yes, is Potter around?”
“My parents,” Harry explained, taking the spot next to Draco. “I don’t remember them but they were best friends with Remus and Sirius, so I learned everything about my parents from them.”
“The other Aurors will arrive in approximately two minutes,” Draco muttered, leaning forwards expectantly. “Now, what did you say about me being beautiful?”
Feeling like an idiot, Harry dropped to his knees and picked up the nearest book, the cover of which looked strikingly similar to one of his own textbooks. “I’m sorry, I—” He held the book out and froze, words caught in his throat because at that moment, the blond lifted his head and stared at Harry with cool grey eyes.
Draco carefully collected the remains of the potion and put it under a bubble charm. As far as he knew, the vapours from the potion could be deadly. He started casting diagnostic charms on the potion but it was hard to keep check of the potion’s swirling colours with Harry standing so close to him. He was standing still but his mere presence made Draco lose all his focus.
Pansy brought home lunch. She worked as a model for a Muggle agency. Her agent kept putting her on various diet regimens, so her choice of food always astounded Draco. Luckily, she remembered to buy regular food for him.
Holding the ball low, he leaped backwards and landed behind the three-point line. Weasley’s eyes widened in realisation as Draco swung the ball up and threw it towards the hoop.
During the post-match review, Snape hit Draco across the head with a folded newspaper in front of the entire club.
Draco introduces his team to Harry. Hermione Granger has discarded her surgical cap and lets her large hair loose as she speaks clearly into the comms. She allows Harry to send several good words to Ron before pushing him aside.
Potter's gaze was sad and disappointed; Draco could not bear to look. "But I want you to be there. I want to spend my birthday with the people I care about, and you're one of them."
The only unordinary thing was the white folding fan, made of enchanted paper and bamboo, Draco had open in his right hand. At its full size, the fan was longer than the span of Harry’s elbow to his fingertips. The patterns on the slats and paper depicted a white peacock, tail proud and beautiful, just like the man using it.
with Potter wasn't any less terrifying. Nobody would be pleased to learn that The Saviour was sharing a bed with a Death Eater. Any animosity would certainly be directed at Draco. He was a criminal, after all.
The first time Potter pulled off his Invisibility Cloak in front of Draco, the blond had yelped in surprise and accidentally banged his head against the headboard.
He only raised his head when he heard a knock on the door. A Mediwitch opened the door but instead of entering the room, she stepped back to allow Harry to walk in. Once Harry was inside, the door closed behind him.
“I just shared with him what I saw. He figured out the rest himself.” Harry stood up, watching Goyle and Zabini envelope Draco in an awkward yet ecstatic group hug. Amidst the cheers and celebration, Draco caught Harry’s gaze over Blaise’s shoulder.
Blaise had gotten the ball close to the hoop, getting ready to shoot, but at the last moment, he bounced the ball back to Draco, who caught it between his hands.
“Well, I am.” Harry tucks strands of silky blond hair behind Malfoy’s ear before pulling his hand back. He has promised himself he won’t make any moves on Malfoy while the other wizard is ill, but here he is, very close to breaking his own promise if he isn’t careful. “I’m going to ask the house elves to send some food. You can either stay in bed or accompany me while I eat on your sofa.”
There is a confusing tangle of limbs and indignant grunts. Harry ends up helplessly supine with Malfoy sprawled against his chest. Harry stops breathing and freezes, his hands suspended in mid-air.
"I don't think you're silly or pathetic. I think you're brilliant." Harry gently pulls Malfoy's hand away from his mouth and, because he can’t help himself, runs his thumb along Malfoy's sharp jaw. "You don't need to feel embarrassed. I get it. The effects of the potion will wear off tomorrow, right? I'll take care of you until then."
Once Draco was out of sight, having gone to the changing rooms with the rest of his team, Harry picked up his backpack. “Are you going to wait for Ron?”
“No,” Teddy blurts out, immediately biting his tongue after. Seeing Uncle Harry upset makes his chest feel heavy and he hates it. “I can meet him today.”
“Apologies for the interruption,” said a Mediwitch. “I was asked to lead you to Mrs Kelley as soon as you arrived.”
“I actually picked it up after. This is my first time joining a club.” There was something about Harry’s charisma and the way he looked at Draco expectantly that Draco could not refuse to answer. He imagined how disappointed his father would be if he found Draco sharing information about himself with strangers so freely like this. “Anyway, what about tomorrow?”
"Hey Malfoy, are you sure you don't mind doing all this paperwork?" Potter asked as he went through Draco's completed reports on the couch. Draco was confident in their quality, but he always showed them to Potter to double-check before submitting them. "You know I hate doing them, but you shouldn't have to do everything yourself."
"Is that why you wear an earring?” Harry tilted his head, eyes going to the stud in question. “To piss off your dad?"
This meant that when Harry arrived, hair still wet and smelling of shampoo, the only available spot in the car was next to Draco, who had to jam his fists into the pockets of his jacket to stop himself from grabbing Harry. He had his usual round-rimmed glasses on, along with a long-sleeved purple jumper and a pair of blue jeans. When he closed the door, Draco caught a whiff of his vanilla-scented soap.
being wary,” Malfoy argues, still with his head against Harry’s chest and his back to Madam Pomfrey. “Potter is here, isn’t he?”
They took this chance to discover what the other liked and how to please each other. As expected, Harry was an enthusiastic and fast learner. Being the centre of Harry's attention was overwhelming, but Draco doubted he could live without it now that he had gotten a taste.
Harper’s body stunned Draco almost into silence. He’d been vaguely aware of the boy’s cuteness back when he was first confronted by him in the common room, but he’d never dreamed that the kid would be so beautiful underneath his robes…
‘Not yet,’ said Draco, standing up and beginning to remove his own robes. Tugging off his shirt and tie, he threw the whole lot over on to the pile of boxes, where they joined Fred’s.
Fred looked for a second as though he were going to say something in retort, but then his face relaxed and, very reluctantly, he gave in. With one hand he dropped the bread to the bathroom floor, and with the other he instantly covered up his groin.
‘No, he’s got a detention with Snape. And don’t evade the question, Malfoy! I want to know what you’re doing with your dick out while my brother’s got the Imperius curse on him.’
‘Fuck’s sake, Malfoy,’ said the ginger boy, but he did as he was told. Draco marvelled at Fred’s semi-erect cock, licking his lips subconsciously. It was much longer than he had anticipated, but with an impressive girth as well. Probably seven inches erect, he thought, or maybe even eight.
‘Exactly. And whilst there are no school rules against students exploring the carnal possibilities that certain medical remedies present, so long as they do it privately, the problem doesn’t stop there. The potion also, you’ll soon find, gives the taker a feeling of extreme confidence. Confidence that all too frequently, I’m afraid, leads to recklessness.’
There were a few solitary golden curls at the hilt of Harper’s four-inch cock, but apart from that the boy was entirely hairless. His skin was smooth, tanned and, so it seemed in the candlelit room, practically reflective of the light. He had somewhat-defined muscles in his thighs, upper arms, and chest that other thirteen-year-olds would surely be jealous of, and his seated pose on the desk was, to Draco at least, infuriatingly arousing.
Harper looked thankful for breath, but he was still smiling seductively. Draco grabbed one of his shoulders and spun him round, not saying a word. Silently commanding the boy as if he were a puppet, Malfoy positioned him on all fours so that he was facing the other way. Kneeling behind Harper on the desk, Draco gripped his cock and pointed it at the boy’s hole.
‘You can stop there. I’m afraid your efforts have been wasted,’ said the matron, and she got to her feet. ‘I cannot have students pleasuring themselves in the hospital wing.’
‘I am going to fuck you… 'til I fuck your fucking brains out,’ said Draco between heavy breaths. ‘Then we’ll see how you feel about insulting me.’
Draco’s gaze shifted down to Blaise’s toned abdomen, and the snail trail of hair that led to his still-enormous flaccid cock. Thoughts of all sorts whirled around Draco’s mind, each of them more arousing than the last, until they were ever-so-cruelly interrupted by a noise on the other side of the room. Whipping his head around, Draco found the source of the noise standing on the stairwell that led up to the boys’ dormitories – a small Slytherin boy, a third-year if Draco’s memory did him any favours, looking down on the scene below with quite some bewilderment.
The boy said nothing in response, his eyes seemingly too distracted by Draco’s groin. Much to his horror, Malfoy followed the line of sight down to his own private area and made a surprising discovery.
!’ He looked desperately at Draco. The blond boy merely smiled. Blaise started to shake his head, incredulous. ‘Oh, you… you
From his seated position on the floor, Fred looked up at his brother. The half-eaten loaf of bread now sat in his lap, but there was still cum smeared all over his chin. He gave a little smile when he caught sight of George’s face; Draco’s weak Imperius seemed to have given him the countenance of someone heavily intoxicated.
Draco propped himself up further. ‘You right there, mate?’ he said weakly to the boy, attempting not to buckle under veiled embarrassment.
‘Oh yes,’ said Madam Pomfrey. ‘Broken bones are not a rarity at Hogwarts. The potion has been taken by many students over the years.’
Once the two brothers were less than a foot apart, Fred looked up at George and said, ‘Hello Georgie,’ and Draco caught a glimmer of lust and appetite in George’s eyes. Under Draco’s silent command, Fred lowered his mouth on to his brother’s prick and began sucking on at least six inches of it. He wrapped a hand around the bottom of the shaft and, whenever Draco wanted, gave it a slight twist. George looked as though he’d never experienced something so pleasurable. His mouth gaped open and he ran his fingers through his brother’s hair. Draco slid a hand up and down his own length, whilst puppeteering Fred’s every move. Occasionally he would increase the speed at which Fred’s head was bobbing up and down, which always got a particularly agreeable reaction from the other twin.
‘M-Malfoy?’ George stammered softly. And then Draco was kissing him, his fingers running through the older boy’s hair, his tongue darting sporadically forwards like a serpent. And George returned the passion: his lips locked tightly on to Draco’s, refusing to let go; his hands pressed against Draco’s taut pecs. The younger boy succumbed. His sole intention had been to woo George, but once again he had already lost himself to desire.
‘By all means, then, wank yourself silly afterwards,’ said George, looking desperately down at his erection.
The pair of them soon hooting with laughter, Draco grabbed the cushion from underneath his feet and chucked it aggressively across the room at Blaise’s head. Blaise was quick, catching it mid-air and pulling it to his chest. He threw the cushion to Draco, who instantly flung it back in the same direction as earlier. By the time they’d recollected themselves and the laughter had died down, a grin started to spread across Blaise’s face.
He palmed it at first with his left hand, giving it a few strokes to show off his length to Madam Pomfrey, and then took over with his right hand. The feeling was wonderful; if he closed his eyes or looked away, it felt exactly as if someone else was stroking it for him.
