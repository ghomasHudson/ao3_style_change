Harry fell asleep in Draco’s arms, which was not very comfortable, but Draco didn’t seem to mind if they had been in a bed rather than the couch. “Here Draco, I will take him into the bedroom and you both can rest for the day.” Tom said looking a little amused that Draco was more than willing to stay in that position all night for Harry. They both walked into the bedroom and got Harry dressed for bed then laid him in the queen sized bed that Tom and Severus brought from home, “Draco, I want you to try and enter the Garden with Harry see if Lily has any ideas on how to deal with Dumbledore and those lions.” Tom said as he kissed his son on the forehead and wished Draco a good night. “Of course, Uncle Tom, I want to help in anyway I can.” Draco said sliding into bed with Harry pulling him close and let his mind drift towards the Garden.
Draco and Harry walked into transfiguration, they were the first ones there, sitting down Harry looked at the cat on the desk and smiles. “Why does she always do this?” Draco whispered looking at the cat. “She wants to see who acts out on their first day.” Harry said smiling more, kinda hoping that Weasley and Granger made fools of themselves. “I see you plotting Har, what are you planning?” Draco asked still whispering knowing Harry wasn’t going to do anything bad, but he was hoping something happened. “I’m not planning Drayk, you know me, I’m just thinking of what would happen if something happened in class.” Harry said pretending to look chocked at Draco.
After that the rest of the train ride was quite and no one else interrupted the boys. They finally arrived at Hogwarts. Having got dressed 10 minutes early Harry and his friends left the train to go to the boats. “First Yrs follow meh. First yrs over herr.” A Giant looking man said gathering everyone to the boats.
Snape
Just then, the door opened, and in walked Severus, “Harry, I need you to calm down. Can you please do that for me? I will tell you what you want to know, but you have a panic attack, and that’s not good for your health.” Severus said, having heard what was going on outside in the hall.
The next day Harry woke up and just knew today wasn’t going to go well. x “Morning Har, is everything okay?” x Draco asked through the bong looking concerned. * “It’s not going to be a good day Drayk, I can feel it.” * Harry said back looking at Draco with equal concern. Walking up to Harry, Draco hugged his bonded giving him the comfort both of them needed at that moment.
“write down the potions, and I see if I have enough for the next few days, then I will start to stock up,” Severus said just as he heard the door open to his husband, looking very grave. “We got to him in time, Tom, but he’s going to be put into a coma so that we can give him the care that he needs for the next few days,” Severus said, trying to reassure both Tom and himself.
“Fine, I want a meet with you and Severus with Harry. I have much to say about his behavior the last few days.” Dumbledore said with fire in his eyes. “I will let Severus know at dinner we will meet right after. Now may I start my class Headmaster you’ve made it late.” Tom said with a tight smile. “I will see you all at eight, don’t be late I’m a busy man and have another meeting.” Dumbledore said as he left the room just as a jar on one for the shelves shattered.
"Whatever, weirdo." She smiled and hooked her arm in Draco's. "Let's go."
Harry followed him and pushed him against the door as soon as it had closed behind them. His lips immediately went to Draco's neck, only leaving his skin when he took off his sweater. He was making his way down Draco's chest when he pulled him up and dragged him to the shower.

“Unhand me right this instant! I am not some child you can just put your hands on I am a Lord and you will do to remember.” Harry yelled taking his hand away way from this crazed woman who thinks just like that old goat. “You lay a hand on me again without my permission, I will press charges for harassment. Furthermore, my parents would not be ashamed since my true parentage was revealed four years ago and if you could read maybe you wouldn’t be so ignorant.” Harry said looking so pissed that anyone would try to say anything bad about him or his parents. Molly looked taken back how dare this boy say such things to her, a Lord he was only 11 he couldn’t be a Lord yet. “Harry, you aren’t a lord your only 11 who ever said you’re a lord is lying and who ever told you that your parents were those to is the one who should be ashamed.” She said with a smile there that should put some doubt in the boys head, obviously living with the Malfoy’s hadn’t taught him any manners. “Grippy! Please get your father for me as well as my inheritance test, I need to yet again put a crazed Dumbledore fan in their place as well as show them that I am not one to be messed with.” Harry asked looking at his friend who just nodded and called for his father, whom had already shown up and was already snapping his finger for the test to be brought to him. “Inheritance test? You… Got an inheritance test done? When? Why? Who told you to do such a thing?” The woman asked looking shocked and angry that she was about to be proven wrong. “Not that its any of your business but my Mom’s Will suggested I get it done four years ago when it was read at the Ministry.” Harry said looking like he was bored of having to have this conversation then looking at his fathers who seemed to be waiting for Harry to ask for help.
Luckily no one else knew. He had been quiet when spending time with Pansy and Blaise and Harry hadn't told anyone either. He trusted him.
"In loving memory of  James Potter - Lily Potter" it read.
But wishing wouldn't get him anywhere.
"Wait you were the one that locked us up?"
"Please do."
Harry laughed, "Make me, Malfoy."
"Fuck. Ehm, I- I mean, we..."
But most of all Harry hated how much he loved him. How much he had gotten to know him. He now knew that that wasn't the real Draco. That it was just the outcome of his parents' believes, not his own.
“I do wish we didn’t have to kill them so quickly; he has a long recovery from this even after the 6 months are up on the Nutrition potions, he going to have to take them at least once a day for the next few years just to get him back to where he is supposed to be,” Severus said trying to calm himself down, he was so angry but not just at those horrible people but also the ministry as well as Dumbledore.
A bushy haired girl with big teeth walked in, “has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville lost one.” She stated then got super excited gasping she pushed Draco out of the way. “Your Harry Potter! I read about you in the famous witches and wizards of the 19

Chapter 6: Hogwarts
If for some reason James and I both do not survive then guardianship until 25 are in order, seeing as Harry’s creature inheritance doesn’t mature until then. First Severus Tobias Snape and His husband Tom Marvollo Riddle both of you get a purge and get Harry an inheritance test. Second Lucius Malfoy and his wife Narcissa Black Malfoy, Cissa I know you will look after Harry and I will miss you so very much. Third Sirius Black and his husband Remus Lupin look after him and each other we love you both so much. Under no circumstances is my son to live with my sister and her husband.
By DaizyHeart
Remus Lupin I know James left you something but because this is my will you have to take it, I leave vault 585 which has a few chests in it. Sirius Black, I leave you vault 690 don’t talk James into anything crazy please. I wish to let it be known that Peter Pettigrew is the secret keeper for our house in Godrics Hollow; Albus was the binder if anything happens to us there, look to those two. Albus Dumbledore leave my husband and son alone we already told you, that we withdrew ourselves from the Order and from this war, that prophecy is fishy and should be investigated.
“A PRISON! BOY you have it easy here if you think this place is a prison.” Vernon yelled as he through Harry onto the bed in the spare room. “Now get undressed I have need for you and you are going to comply.” Vernon said with a ugly smile.
I can’t allow you boys to be together you are not good for Harry just like his so-called parents.” Dumbledore said getting angry about the turn of events. “Allow! You think, you have any say on who anyone ends up with?” Harry said getting equally angry of the stupidity of the old goat. “I am Albus Dumbledore, I have more power than you have in your finger boy.” Dumbledore said letting his true power show but looked confused when Harry started laughing.
A couple of weeks later Harry and Draco were sitting at the family table when a ringing noise came from the fire place. “I wonder who, that is calling this early.” Lucius said as we walked over to the mantle a voice spoke “Mr. Malfoy may I please come through I have urgent matters to discuss with you.” The voice was none other than the Minister of magic looking at Harry Lucius pointed for them to hide, not having to be told twice Harry and Draco ran for the quite room as Lucius let the Minister through. “Well hello Minister what can I do…” as soon as the Minister came through so did the one and only Albus Dumbledore. “Well this is a surprise Gentlemen what can I do for you today?” Lucius said put up his mask to hide the distaste of having to look at the man who almost got his godson killed. “I am sorry to have called on you so early, Lucius but I just receive news that the family that was caring for Harry Potter, well sad to say they were found dead and your godson and well as his cousin have been found missing.” The Minister said looking distraught and concerned that Voldemort was behind this. “So, after all your, babble about how Harry would be safer with this family rather than his godparents you lost not only him but is cousin?” Lucius said with malice though he knew Harry and his cousin were safe that didn’t mean he wasn’t still pissed about what happened with Harry. “Lucius be reasonable how could we have known that Voldemort would be able to find Harry? Though why he took his cousin as well is beyond me.” The Minister said as he was saying that Severus and Tom both walked into the dining room.
For the next few days, everyone kept busy, Severus with the potions, Tom with the goblins reading everything they could to find a solution, Cissa making sure Harry was comfortable and keeping Draco happy. Of course, Lucius kept the ministry busy, so they did not find out that Harry was missing.
Harry looked around realizing someone must have put him into bed, rather than keep him on the couch. “See you are awake.” Draco said smiling over at Harry’s hair with amusement. “Who moved me last night?” Harry asked Draco rolling his eyes as he tried to get his hair under control it being long it was easier than when he had it short. “Your father, he didn’t think we would be very comfortable on the couch all night the way that we were sitting.” Draco said helping Harry braid his hair into one long braid, it also gave Draco an excuse to play with his hair. “Well I guess we better get dressed and see what my parents have come up with for todays event.” Harry said giving Draco a hug of thanks for the braid. After they got ready, they walked into the living area of the quarter finding not only Tom and Severus but also Draco’s parents.
It had been three weeks since Harry had been found and he was feeling better than he had in the years he had been alive. In the time he’s been in his new place of living he had met Severus, Cissy, Draco and Lucius there was another person in the house, but Severus wasn’t sure if Harry should meet him just yet incase his memories were bad. Harry understood but he wanted to know why he would have bad memories of a person he hadn’t met yet. Harry kept it to himself until he got frustrated that they hadn’t told him more about the other memories of them that kept coming back each day.
Age: 6
Just as he thought those words a loud crackling noise happened around the house. “I wonder what that was, can’t be good for me though I’m sure to be beaten for this.” Harry thought just as his cupboard door opened to the face of his Uncle Vernon.
After class Harry and Draco, along with Blaise and Theo started to head straight to Defense class. As they were walking the old goat stopped them. “Harry my boy I would like to speak to you a minute.” Dumbledore said with his grandfather type smile. “So sorry Professor but unless my fathers are present, I won’t be having any conversations alone with you.” Harry said giving him a smile and walked away hoping to get to his fathers class before being stopped again.

“That is exactly who this is Cissa, his relatives were horrible to him, Lucius might have saved him enough by fixing his lungs, but he’s still in terrible shape,” Severus said as he put Harry down on the bed and got him to undress so Cissa could assess the situation.

“GET OUT! I don’t care what you have read or who you are, if you had any manners you wouldn’t push anyone you don’t know out of the way specially a bonded pair. His name is Draco this is Theo and that’s Blaise, now that you know our names leave us alone.” Harry said looking very angry his Green eyes flashing Purple. “Harry! I’m fine, see no harm done.” Draco said kneeling next to him holding his hand trying to calm him down. Harry looked down at Draco shaking and tried to slow down his breathing. “I really suggest you leave, Harry does not take anyone treating Draco badly.” Blaise said looking at the girl who only nodded as she left the compartment.
As everyone started to arrive Blaise and Theo quickly took the seats next to Draco and Harry blocking anyone from getting to them. Ron and Hermione walked into class and sat behind Harry and Draco, talking loudly. “I can’t believe they allow gay people in to this school, let alone teach students, they should be arrested for be disgusting.” Hermione said looking at Harry with such anger. “I agree, with you Hermione, though maybe just recondition, is a better idea because I believe at one point the Headmaster was gay.” Ron said smiling at how uncomfortable the class shifted
They spent three wonderful days, roaming around the parks laughing, taking pictures having nothing but pure enjoyment. When it was time to leave everyone put on their masks to not show their emotions in front of Harry, who in the past three days had finally come out of his shell and had bonded with everyone especially Severus and Tom who seem to have taken on a parental role for Harry. “Are you ready to go Harry?” Severus asked as he came into the room to make sure everything was packed up then he saw something was wrong with Harry, he was still asleep, but he was tossing around, and it looked like he was screaming but Severus couldn’t hear anything. That was until he got closer to the bed and the wave of the silence charm passed through him, what he heard coming out of Harry made his blood grow cold. “NO!! LEAVE THEM ALONE! THEY DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG. LET THEM GO PLEASE I’LL GO WITH YOU JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE!! NO, NO DRACO!” Harry Screamed but nothing he did would let him out of this nightmare, Severus did the only thing he could think of he let his mind open into Harry’s and what he saw sent him over the rail.
“Not that it’s any of your business but my mom and dad were friends before Hogwarts. My dad was the one who taught my mom about magic.” Harry said still glaring at the idiots. “Why did she go into hiding, if you weren’t James son.” Ron asked trying to stretch for more answers. “Because the person who was after my mom and James didn’t know what they did.” Harry said rolling his eyes getting bored of the conversation. “If we are done with the history lesson, I’m tired and want to get back to Draco.” Harry said looking at them with a bored look. The lions didn’t say anything more and Harry walked away but not before casting a shield and eavesdropping charm on himself and the lions.
Tom smiled Harry had been excited about learning he could have a pet at Hogwarts sure he had his snow owl Hedwig at home but to have a pet that would be as loyal to him as Hedwig was and he could keep in his dorm was what excite him the most. After getting their multiple compartment Trunks with their initials etched into them, they walked over to the owlery to look at all the pets that were available. “What, are you wanting to look at?” Severus ask when they walked into the shop, knowing Harry would most likely look at the snakes. “I want to look at that Green and Purple Python.” Harry said pointing to the cage the held a 3-foot Python that would fit perfectly around Harry’s arm and stay out of site. “If its willing to pledge its allegiance with you then you may have it.” Tom said know Harry got his ability to talk to snakes and was proud every time he spoke. “Hello, my name is Harry what is yours?” Harry said looking at the snake smiling when it raised its head “you are a speaker? My name is Amethyst nice to meet you Harry.” Amethyst said looking at the speaker with respect “Hello Amethyst I am looking for a Familiar for school and have always wanted to have a snake would you be willing to have me as your Master?” Harry said smiling fondly at the snake hoping she said yes. Amethyst was surprised the young speaker wanted her everyone who ever came in here looked at her with disgust. “I would be honored to be your Familiar, I only have one thing that needs to be seen to. For me to pledge myself to you we have to make sure our magic is compatible.” Amethyst said, “All you have to do is touch my skin and if you don’t get cut then we are compatible.” She said as Harry placed his hand on her skin, they were not only compatible but soul bound Familiars.
Chapter 8: Punishment
They had heard everything and were both angry. “Maybe had you listen to the people who knew Lily and James best, you would have know that the only way for those so called blood wards the Ministry put up only work if the people caring for Harry gave him love and made him feel at home, if at any point in time Harry didn’t feel loved or feel like where he was living was home the wards would have broken.” Severus said with such malice that the Minister cringed. “Now Severus be a little understanding Harry was with his mother’s sister I’m sure she loved him.” Said Albus giving them a smile that only made putting him in his place more glorious to bring down. “PETUNIA! YOU IDIOTS SENT HIM TO PETUNIA!! Did you not listen to anything Lily said you either of you, did you dunderheads listen to a single word? Why am I asking of course you didn’t why would you listen to the mother of the son you have lost? She Fucking told you under no right or reason was Harry to go to her sister. She hates anything magic, so your damn blood wards would not have worked for I can guarantee that she hated Harry like she hated Lily. How you became Minister of Magic when you are a complete fucking moron is beyond me. I will Vow this right here and right now if I find Harry and his cousin alive they will not have anything to do with you Minister and they sure and hell will have NOTHING to do with you Dumbledore, I Vow on my life and my magic that I will do everything to keep them away from the both of you.” Severus said with such demand that magic swirled around him and sealing the vow.
“I have had enough, I want to know why I remember these things even though I couldn’t have been more than a year old in these memories.” Harry finally said with such angry that the glass that Cissa was holding shattered. Severus held up his hands in surrendered “Okay Harry I will tell you, but I don’t want you to interrupt until I am done okay?” Severus said looking at Harry with a strained look like this was going to be difficult, but Harry didn’t care he was tired of being left in the dark. Harry nodded his head and laid back against his pillow waiting for Severus to begin Harry maybe six, but he was never an average six-year-old he had been through to much in his life already to anything but abnormal.
Harry sat back on the bed but couldn't let Cissa do everything so he waved his hand around in a circle to indicate the whole room and said “Repro” at the same time the room started to repair itself back into the way it was before Harry’s dream then he shrunk when he saw everyone looking at him with a shocked look. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to be bad I won’t do it again, I just thought I would help.” Harry said pulling his legs to his chest scared he was about to be punished again the dream still fresh in his mind. Tom brushed his hand on Harry’s arm “Harry we aren’t mad, you just did magic without a wand that’s hard to do even for older wizards.” Tom explained looking at Harry with a smile at that Harry looked at Tom’s eyes and saw that Tom wasn’t lying, he then turned to look at Severus and saw he was smiling as well as Cissy. Harry blinked then blushed that he did something that was rare to do even older wizards, he really was a freak how could anyone love him when he could do things like that. Tom looked at Harry seeming to understand what Harry was thinking “Don’t Harry you are not a freak, I said it was hard but its not freakish or bad, and how can we not love you? Harry you have been loved since you were born, your parents loved you and we love you when we lost you… we never stopped looking for you, we have wanted you back so much Harry you mean so much to us.” Tom said as he hugged him and every doubt that Harry had was washed away.
Once the feast was over, the old headmaster got up to do his speech. “Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. I would like to welcome our first years and two knew teachers to our lovely staff. Teaching potions is none other than the Youngest potions master in Great Britain Professor Severus Snape, as well as his Husband who will be our new defense against the dark arts Professor Tom Riddle-Snape please give them a warm welcome.” The Headmaster said then went on to state the rules and then sent everyone to bed.
Harry smiled then blushed when is stomach growled “Harry what do you want for breakfast?” Cissa asked looking at Harry with a soft smile. “Can I have porridge toast and some fruit.” Harry asked hoping that wasn’t too much he didn’t want to seem greedy. Cissa looked at Harry understanding that Harry was holding back the mental damage those vile people did caused him to believe he didn’t deserve to eat. “Of course, Harry, you can eat whatever you want we need to start to get some weight on you. Your health is very bad, so we need to get you to a healthy weight so it’s less likely for you to get sick.” She said as she was talking, she smiled when Harry looked shocked. “Dobby.” Cissa called out with a pop a small elf like creature appeared into the room “Yes mistress Cissa, What can dos for you…. Master Harry! Oh, master Harry Dobby as missed you lots.” Dobby squeaked with tears running down his face Harry smiled in excitement and jumped off the bed running to the Elf. “Dobbies, I have missed you too.” Harry said as he cradled the elf both crying and giggling with excitement. “What can Dobby do your Master Harry.” Asked Dobby smiling at his long-lost Master whom he loved so much. “Dobby can you get me some breakfast please, its been a long while since I’ve eaten.” Harry said with tears still in his eyes looking at his first friend as a baby. “Of course, Master Harry anything for you, Dobby wills be rights back don’t goes anywheres.” Dobby said firmly before popping away to get breakfast for Harry giggling Harry got up and walked over to the table that was brought in when he was ready to eat. Seeing the way Harry interacted with Dobby shocked everyone but they were more shocked to hear him giggling. Harry sat down as Dobby returned with Harry’s favorite breakfast Porridge with bananas and cream wheat toast with dragon berry jam, a side of sliced apples and pumpkin juice was set at the table and all Harry could do was smile at the elf for remembering what Harry liked. Harry could only eat about half of the food because of his malnutrition his stomach couldn’t handle a full meal. After he got done eating Cissa gave him his potions and then laid Harry down in the bed to sleep a while. Harry was well enough that they could go ahead and talk with the elves about James and Lily’s wills as well as doing a purge of Harry’s system of any bad spells or blocks and a inheritance test.
“Here is what I want you to do, Ron I need you and Hermione to create a scene tomorrow. So, I can get a port-key around Draco.” Dumbledore said sounding like he had been thinking about this for a while. “Is that really wise, I mean its all well and good, but do we really want to provoke Harry?” Ron asked sounding a little more like himself but still very monotone. “We have to do this Ron, if the Headmaster thinks it’s a good idea then we need to do as we are told.” Hermione said sounding more confident and more like her foolish self. “Good now tomorrow before Harry and Draco get into the Great Hall cause a scene that gets Draco away from Harry and I will do the rest. Now get up to your dorms its almost curfew.” Dumbledore says while it sounds like he’s walking away.

The next few weeks flew by in a blur of lessons, homework, and Quidditch practice. Harry marvelled at Hermione; he had to give it to her – she always managed to pull the goods out of the bag under pressure. She had used her influence as Head Girl to procure the more unusual Polyjuice potion ingredients without any of the professors adding up what she needed them for. The month long brewing process was now well under way.

These past days he had tried to come up with some sort of plan for not killing Dumbledore and running away with Harry. All of them ended with at least one of them or their loved ones getting killed.
"Yeah."
"Draco," he heard Dumbledore say through the wooden ceiling above him. Behind it he saw Draco pointing his wand at Dumbledore, his hand trembling.
He was caught off guard when Harry pushed him on the bed, but smiled as he looked up at his messy hair and quidditch shirt with the word 'captain' written on the sleeve.
"And there's no way for me to accept you doing it."
"You decided to go away from your usual bathroom I see."
It was Tuesday. Fourty-eight hours since Harry had last seen Draco. He had been nowhere to be found during meals and Harry hadn't run into him in the hallways either.
This couldn't be true. Before he could even realize what had happened Snape was making his way down the stairs, pulling Draco behind him. He could see his pale, shocked face.
"Of course not, I don't give two craps about quidditch. I need to know what's going on between you and Potter."
"It is!" She had started crying again.
"From him?"
"But sir, they're going to-"
He shushed her quickly. "Please, please, please don't tell anyone."
"Oh. Ehm. I've had it for as long as I can remember. I guess that's what happens when people force you to sleep in a cupboard for 10 years" Harry answered with a small grin, trying to laugh it off.
Draco blushed at that.
He looked up at the sound of his name and quickly wiped away his tears. "I-I'm sorry. Fuck, I'm a mess."
Harry looked back and watched them go around the corner, probably heading towards their common room.
"No, I mean... Away from here."
Harry stiffened up and his breathing was still difficult, but he couldn't lie, Draco's strong hands did calm him down a little. Somehow.
"W-wait" Harry said. He pulled Draco up and lead them to a wall not far away, kissing him on the way.
Because. You know-”
He had no idea how much time they had spend together, but everyone was already fast asleep.
A small smile appeared on Draco's face.
'-but I like it...' The boy looked at the name tag that was pinned on his shirt 'What's your last name, Draco?'
But he liked being with his mom. He felt sorry for her, all alone in this big house.
“Do you want to be with him. I mean, do you really think all the hassle will be worth it?
But it was.
It was quiet for a while.
He wanted to tell Harry what was going on... He really did. But how could he tell him that Snape threatened expose their relationship and that that was why he couldn't see him anymore.
"Yeah, of course."
"And I would like to say them..." he continued, "But I don't think this is the right place for that."
Harry smiled sadly, "He won't."
There were many more people at the wedding, but his eyes fell to a couple in the back. He didn't recognise them.
The next time they saw each other was two weeks later at the Malfoy trials.
'Oh, really, who's the lucky...girl?' The boy raised an eyebrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, you may leave." He harshly slapped Draco's hand away from the table. "Don't ruin my tables."
They only counted two, though.
He heard the door open and saw Luna wondering in. The crowd parted as Ginny made her way to her, placed her hands on the blonde's head and kissed her hard.
“I'm not vulnerable, I told you to go away!” He yelled and pointed his wand at Harry.
He thought for a second. "No. He's not. I promise I- we have this figured out. We both know we don't really have a future. But as long as it will last we'll-"
She laughed at that. "What time does it start?"
"You don't have to, okay? Really, everything is fine."
"Is it, though? Is it really?"
"Never" Draco said as he leaned in and kisses him.
'Hi love,' he mumbled against his sweater, 'merlin, I love this.'
"Yeah well, Pansy's full of shit most of the time."
"No no no," Harry interrupted him, "don't tell me. I mean, you're not going to go through with it, obviously."
"I can't be sure." He said.
They stared at each other.
"Hmm... not sure if you're telling the truth, but you obviously don't want to talk about it, so I'll let it go."
"Mr. Malfoy, could you stay for a moment. The rest of you can go." Snape cleaned his desk with a flick of his wand. Draco had been avoiding him, and Pansy for that matter, for two days, but after the Defence Against the Dark Arts class he could no longer ignore him.
"I just... I can't really believe that the Harry Potter had a bad childhood. I assumed that whoever raised you would have adored you and treated you like a hero..."
Harry's hands roamed over Draco's back and slipped under his shirt. He let his fingers feel the back muscles, grinding his hips slowly.
Draco nodded and waited for Harry to go. A minute later he left as well.
There would be no way they'd win the war now. He'd have to stay with the Death Eaters forever. He'd become one, if he hadn't already. He wasn't even sure.
“Because you like him.”
There he found him on the floor, hugging his knees, crying softly.
He had hoped he would have come to him by now, agreeing to go with him. To be together.
"You okay, Harry?" Ron asked.
Harry laughed. "We should probably still close this though." He said as he closed the curtain. Now it was just him and Draco in their little cocoon.
He hated that he had hurt Dumbledore. He hated that he had joined the Death Eaters. He hated that he was filled with prejudices and lacked empathy and that he had treated so many people so horribly.
Draco nearly spat out his coffee, 'That was awful! Please don't remind me of that ever again.' He laughed.
Draco's eyes lightened up and a small smile of relieve appeared on his face. "Thank you. Ehm, I thought, we could go to the Three Broo-"
"Could you please, just, not tell anyone, I mean. About-"
"Oh of course! Leave me! Leave me like everyone does!"
When he carefully shot a look at him across the great hall each morning nothing seemed different. Weasley and Granger still looked as annoying as always and Harry still joined in with their conversations.
This will contain a lot of the scenes from The Battle Of The Astronomy Tower from the end of Half-Blood Prince. As you might understand I am not going to write all of that down so I'll skip over some things and address the important ones/the ones that differ a lot from what happens in the books. (Also I am not sure if all I write is accurate but literally who cares y'all are just here for gay fluff) Enjoy :)
They turned to the stadium as they saw a red and yellow dot making it's way back to the castle, accompanied my music and cheering.
Snape squinted his eyes at him. "I am supposed to... But I pity you," he said with disgust in his voice, "end things before Wednesday or I will tell the Dark Lord and he won't be as nice as I am. Do you understand me?"
“Misschief managed” he whispered and walked, if not ran, towards the bathroom.
"Yeah, no. Of course..."
"But you still hurt me. And that's not gonna change over one drink."
Draco nodded. 'You didn't know?'
Draco nodded and kissed him again, tasting him and wanting to remember this forever.
"Oh, no. Of course not. Obviously." Draco said with a smile. Harry smiles back.
"Don't you dare take another step!"
"You. This. Us. I mean kissing you was... amazing. But what's next? We can't really date like normal people."
He does. It helps.
"It's me. Harry."
He stared at himself in the mirror.
Draco and Snape however, had passed through the violence somehow unscathed, due to the Order unaware of Snape's recent actions, instead believing that he and Draco were being pursued by the Death Eaters.
Draco tensed up a bit. "They keep the House of Black family tree there, right?"
Draco blushed and stared at his hands, folded in his lap. "I might've given him a blow job a few nights ago."
This will be the very last chapter! I can't believe it! Thank you all so so much for sticking with me and supporting me! Now let's wrap this up! Enjoy!
"...I know."
He was about to go back to Grimmauld Place where he was staying for a while when someone tapped his shoulder.
"Harry, I'm glad you're here." Dumbledore said when Harry entered the office.
"I'm heading back to Luna before she turns Hermione into a bouquet."
"Don't leave me like that ever again."
He looked up through the wood, he could now look directly at Draco's face, sadness and fear in his eyes. It hurt just looking at that.
He tried to fall asleep as well, but his mind kept wondering to those beautiful eyes staring at him. Slender finger straling down his chest. Lips touching his' and Draco's tongue doing all the right things...
The man holding him pushed him towards Draco and he got a closer look.

“Yes. We're... Well, not friends. Apparently.”
Draco smiled widely "I would really, really like that. Are you sure you're okay with just... making out? Without anyone knowing?"
Draco said nothing.
Luckily, they found the brooms.
"Okay with what? The fact that they're both blokes?"
He didn't say anything.
Draco pulled away, immediately wanting their lips touching again. He took a breath and placed his hands on Harry's chest.
Draco knew he couldn't let Snape tell them. So what then? He had to break up with Harry? Was there anything to break up? He had three days to figure something out. Speaking of-
All he had now was his sweater.
Draco pressed his lips on Harry's, both boys smiling in the kiss.
"We probably won't ever get to date in public but that doesn't mean this has to end."
"Why Wednesday?"
Right now he was making his way to Dumbledore's office. He had a quest for the two of them. Harry, however, was hoping to tell him about Draco's plan.
Draco quickly grabbed some parchment and scribbled something on it.  He decided he couldn't ignore his stupid feelings anymore.
"...right." He sighed. He was fidgeting with his hands. This was not going the way he wanted it to.
Before he had tried to tell himself he still was a good person. He wasn't so sure about that anymore.
He clicked on a light and looked at him with disgust.
“Yeah yeah. Tomato to-mah-to. Anyway, you hug him and all of the sudden you do everything you can to avoid him and you don't even tell us, your best friends, about it. If you really, truly hated him, you would've used all this shit against him.”
When he ran into the dimly lit corridor, it was full of dust and debris, as half the ceiling had fallen in, as the battle was violently raging, with several Hogwarts residents and the Order of the Phoenix duelling the Death Eaters.
"Harry..." Draco whispered, his voice cracking.
"What do you mean?"
Draco blushed, Harry smiled at him.
He flew through the door, followed by Ron and Hermione with Goyle.
The fire roared around him, nearly killing him. Draco held him stronger.
"Y-yeah. I'm okay. I just. I have to go."
"I- I'm so sorry that they did that to you."
He looked up to Snape.
"What the fuck are you doing here? What if someone saw you? Are you crazy?"
"Okay..." He raised an eyebrow.
"It's sort of why I chose this place." Harry continued. "It's a gay bar."
"It's not your fault."
"You know exactly what I'm talking about."
"I love you so much." He whispered.
He moved back so that Harry could join hum on the bed, he, however, decided to sit on Draco's lap, their crotches dangerously close.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Death Eaters and some followers, he didn't really care who they were, were holding three people. He could clearly recognise Weasley and Granger.
But he didn't. He said nothing and ran away.
"Can we talk? In private?" The blond raised an eyebrow suspiciously then nodded and followes Harry to an abandoned corridor.
The room was pretty similar to his own, a bit tidier and bigger. There were no windows and, obviously, everything was green and silver.
"My Lord," Snape said from his other side, he was the only one else in the dark dungeon, "I understand your anger, but Dumbledore is dead. Draco mag not be the killer, but it couldn't have been done without him."
He kissed the other boy hard, wanting more. He pulled away for air as he felt Harry's hands grab his arse. Fuck, he could do this forever.
I'm okay, he thinks, I'm safe, I'm with Harry.
He bit his lip, waiting for Harry's response.
"Even for me? What is that supposed to mean?"
They discovered each other, hands caressing their bodies.
She stared at him.
'It's for my Medicine Studies.' The bloke explained with a smile. 'I'm studying here at UCL.'
Harry stood up and was about to walk away when a hand on his shoulder spun him around.
"What is it?" Draco asked.
Harry was sitting in the Gryffindor common room. Out of all places, this is where he felt most at home. The fire burning softly, the buzzing of his house mates, Ron and Seamus playing chess and Hermione laughing with Ginny as Luna, she'd often come visit, was braiding flowers into her hair.
"Besides," Harry added, "it isn't really that important. Voldemort is gone and all the Death Eaters are either dead or in Azkaban."
His left arm had the Dark Mark on him. He hadn't yet found a way to erase or even cover it. He didn't know if he'd ever would. He hoped so.
They finished their breakfast, laughing at stories until Harry had to leave for his early classes. The ministry had offered him a job as an auror immidiately after the war, but he had insisted he'd take the classes first, even if they took three years.
"I don't care." Harry said, taking Draco's hand in his.
"Well we still are. Except we're a little bit more than that now..."
Harry kissed him softly. 'It's gonna be fun. It has to be.'
He could hear the celebration going on behind it and wondered if one day he could be part of something like that.
Harry and Draco have a talk.
He placed his hand on Draco's forearm, covering the mark.
As the they passed each other Harry felt Draco's hand on his. It lasted less that a second but he still managed to grab the parchment Draco handed him.
"Yup..."
"Can someone please tell me who we're talking about?" Ginny asked annoyed.
Draco grinned and quickly walked to the Gryffindor tower. He could hear the loud music all the way up the stairs.
Draco smiled proudly at him. He didn't know how Harry got the courage, but he was happy for him. He himself didn't even know when or how or if he'd ever come out.
The boy seemed genuinely interested in him. Draco smiled, butterflies fluttered in his stomach at the thought of Harry.
It felt good finally holding Harry. The heat of his skin, his breathing, his smell, all of it felt more like home than anything in his life. Fuck, why did they have to hate each other?
"Well you haven't been really invested in the future of our relationship!"
"Because I don't want to get my parents killed?"
Draco pulled away slowly and cleared his throat.
"I really don't want to, though... What time is it?"
"Oh sorry, famous Harry Potter doesn't understand people not liking you because he's the most populair person in the school." He should've never told him that.
Draco grinned and kissed him. "Sounds good."
"Take it off." Draco moaned.
Harry smiled sadly. Of course he realised their relationship couldn't really go anywhere. He could already imagine the headlines: "The Chosen One and the Death Eater" or "Harry Potter: quidditch and queers"

And then,  little more annoyed: “What a stupid question is that. It's not like it's even possible. He doesn't like me. And even  if, in some crazy world, he does, we would never be able to have an actual relationship. He's the fucking Chosen One and I'm... me. It just can't.”
He didn't want to appear too formal, but not too casual either. He wasn't sure what kind of conversation he was gonna have tonight.
He took off his shirt, Harry smiling softly
"Y-yes."
"Oh I know!"
"Yeah, ehm. That must be shitty, Myrtle."
Ginny climbed back over the backrest and whispered in his ear. "We wouldn't have such an amazing team if it wasn't for you." She kissed his temple and left.
"Yeah, of course. I wanted to see you."
Let me know what you think! Next chapter is already up!
"Haha! Someone has already done their reading! Very impressive, 15 points to Slytherin!"
"Harry? Draco?..." Hermione looked surprised when she opened the door "Why are you in here?..."

"Can I maybe, eh, take off your shirt? Only if you want to of course."
'Dray!' Harry laughed, kicking his shins under the table softly. 'You're so annoying!' He grinned.
His nose was close enough to Draco's head for him to smell the product in it. He used to hate that smell back in his first and second year, but now he realised it was the same smell as the amortentia Slughorn had shown them in the beginning of this year.
Snape was the Half-Blood prince.
"You don't have to do this, Draco." Dumbledore said again, his voice still very calm.
'Oh shut your mouth,' Draco said, kissing him again, 'now go set the table or you won't get any food at all.'
He followed the smell of eggs and coffee coming from downstairs and walked down the main staircase of the Malfoy Manor.
"And what I did was not only very stupid but also very harmful. I was dealing with so many emotions at the time that I couldn't think clear anymore and it caused me to-"
"Whatever. That's not what I want to talk about. Not really."
“Yeah, no, that's total bullshit” Pansy said while rolling her eyes, “He totally likes you back.”
It hurt so bad, but he didn't want to include her in this. He wanted to keep her safe. He had to keep her safe.
"I know. I'm working on it."
"Sorry for oversharing. Probably not what you expected." Harry apologized.
"Oh" he didn't expect this question. Was he supposed to open up? Harry had panick attacks, no need to be ashamed of his own. Right?
