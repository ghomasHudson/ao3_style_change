Draco tried not to eye it, he really did. But he took the moment and snatched the wand. Potter’s eyes widened with something like surprise. Maybe it was disappointment.
It didn’t answer and instead sniffed his hand cautiously. Draco gave it a scratch behind the ears. It seemed to enjoy it.
“Weasley. Ronald,” he greeted the narrow, unamused face in the fire. “I can’t live here any longer,”
sorry this was a little later than i would've liked... i've been OBSESSED with good omens for the past several weeks and have been devoting all of my time to it. anyways, y'all will meet harry sometime i promise
“Wouldn’t what? He was attacked on our property, by your father. Missing for a year or not he’s a powerful wizard, Draco, and I fear you may have forgotten that,”
He stared at his legs, willing them to carry him out of the bathroom and into Harry’s bed. But they just stared stubbornly back.
“Actually, I’d forgotten. Thank you for reminding me,” Malfoy drawled, coming back over. “I’ll assume you want me to flip pages at your command, as well?”
Luna sniffed. “Lovely place,” she said, leading him and Malfoy out of the room. They walked down a musty hallway and finally through a cheap paint-peeled ‘white’ door. Luna opened the door and here was a familiar place. The dark marble courtroom was the picture of elegance and bureaucracy. The little busts of famous Wizarding lawmakers passed judgement over anyone who accidentally looked in their direction. Which was quite difficult to not do, as the busts lines the dome of the circular room. Apparently, they were harsher when you knew their names, which thank Merlin Harry didn’t.
Then Malfoy looked down and unhooked the ruffle. “Here,” he said, handing it to Harry before stalking off to his wicker chair.
Potter made eye contact with him in the mirror, striking green eyes boring into cold grey, the most adorably confused look in them. It was like the look a crup gives you when you hide his favorite toy behind your back. “It’s just a reflection of us and the hall,”
He turned to where she indicated, and saw Malfoy soundly asleep on the sofa. He looked strangely peaceful, and yet remarkably tired. Though the deep line of concern and disdain had smoothed over, Harry could now see wrinkles and bags under Malfoy’s eyes. They were the kinds of wrinkles and bags that accumulate after years and years of haunted dreams and hunting sleep. They wouldn’t be erased for months. Malfoy was clenching a book in his hands, turned upside down like he had finished the last page and immediately passed out.
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two…
hi!! this chapter is a little shorter than I usually do, but there's been a lot of things happening and I really wanted to get this one out as soon as I heard about jk rowlings latest bull shit.
“And Blacks know how to tell the truth.” he finished. It was something his mother had told him time and time again, so long as his father wasn’t in the room. It was their little secret, their little mantra. It had given his mother hope for restitution in darker times.
“Wizengamot’s having a discussion today. It’s open to registered parties, which, luckily,” she procured three ‘visitor’ badges with the day’s date and their respective names. “we are,”
The next door was bare wood. It was locked. Draco frowned, but decided to move on. Whatever secret Potter hid in there wasn’t worth discovering today. And who knows? Maybe he could get Potter to tell it.
He took a breath, glancing up at the sheet music. His brows furrowed and he closed his eyes, starting again with a quiet, almost peaceful melody. It sounded like he was setting up for something grander. A cascade of pretty notes followed, and with it Harry could have sworn one of the golden dragon engravings that decorated the lacquer of the piano blinked its eye.
“Potter…” Draco started, but he didn’t know how to end it so it sounds right. “People shouldn’t treat you like that,”
It was half past eleven when Draco realized he was growing uncomfortably hungry. So he took a break. There was nothing much in his flat, but toast would have to do today. Maybe he would get groceries tomorrow. That’s what he said yesterday, but here’s to hoping.
He took a deep breath. “A friend came by who needs to speak to Malfoy. Urgently. Preferably over lunch.”
“Last night,” Pansy began again, “I received an owl. Or rather, your mother did. Lucius, as you know…” she trailed off.
on his lips. But then his head was yanked up. He thought it was Lucius, but the force pulled him backwards.
From behind the door of his flat he heard the faint distinctive pop of apparition, then he walked back out into the store. Sure enough, Potter was gone. But come to think of it, London was an awfully long jump, especially side-along. Did he mean to do it in two? No, Draco realized. Potter didn’t mean to do it in two because Potter was the most powerful wizard of our time, by all reports (especially
He hated to think about how quickly the Manor could be manipulated. Draco hadn’t been there in a few weeks and suddenly Lucius’s mistaken thoughts had corrupted it.
The tables had turned. Harry wasn’t sure where they had been pointed in the first place, but now they were resolutely not in his favor. He was most certain of it. “Reading,”
Draco gave them a grateful smile. It wouldn’t be perfect. Hell, it probably wouldn’t be anywhere close to good. But it was a step forward, and Draco needed those. By Merlin, he needed a few good steps forward, and hopefully right into Harry’s arms.
But Potter wasn’t shagging his friends; of that Draco was certain. There were no telltale bruises, no crumpled clothes. And when he wanted to, Potter could hide. He had that damned invisibility cloak, for one, and probably a lifetime supply of polyjuice from his numerous contacts.
“Now that you mention it, yes,” she said, and then a fire lit in her eyes. “It’s atrocious that every intelligent witch or wizard is expected to work for the government! You remember when we had to do career planning at Hogwarts? Whenever someone mentioned entrepreneurship or higher education by way of independent study or apprenticeship, they tried to talk us out of it. Entrepreneurship was too plebeian, higher education was too expensive, and if you became an apprentice you’d be destined for some sort of lonely life of solitude. What the Wizarding world needs is more powerful, intelligent, and organized opposition to government rule! Do we even have government parties?”
Then he leaned over, and Harry’s eyelids slid closed and his lips parted involuntarily. Once he’d realized what he’d done, the warmth he had barely been keeping at bay flooded into his cheeks. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice what he’d done though, as he was carefully lining up the temples of the glasses with Harry’s ears.
They ate lunch in the room, silent save for the occasional rustle of blankets or squeak of a chair against the hard wooden floors.
“It’s finality. And I’d come even if I hadn’t the faintest clue why you wanted to, you know that, right?” Ron had said.
It reflected on a pair of green eyes with huge dilated pupils sparking with anger. Not literally, of course, but Potter looked close to accidental-on-purpose arson.
It was Wednesday and he couldn’t very well apparate into the Mum’s house, given they were muggles. He could imagine their faces if he suddenly appeared in the spare bedroom or something. Campbell would demand where he came from and Harry could never lie to her. Elise, on the other hand, would just pretend she remembered him walking in. He smiled to himself.
Ron had said it was too light, then. But, twat that Malfoy still was, Harry could see that it had somehow been enough.
If the going got tough, Draco could always try a good old-fashioned seduction attempt. If nothing else, Draco seemed to be his type in physicality.
Draco looked over to the piano, the lacquer soft in the morning sun, inviting him to go over there, lift the lid, sit on the bench, hover his hands over the keyboard and then begin to play.
“Hmm, that’s true.” Potter came up the counter and leaned his body forward towards Draco, “I wouldn’t mind getting to know you though.” Draco stared into his eyes, stunned for a moment. Potter’s refusal to look away caused Draco’s cheeks to suddenly heat. Draco cursed his pale heritage and could hear Pansy’s laughter in his head mocking how pink his cheeks would turn. Draco cleared his throat and took a small step away from the counter, forcing his face to appear indifferent despite the pink hue he knew it had taken. Potter slowly stood straight as well but smiled slowly as he continued to peruse Draco’s countenance.
“Why did Millie call you?” Draco stood from the bed and brushed his hair back into its usual shaggy state.
Blaise dropped his hands and looked saddened by what Draco had uttered. “Do you not want to perform anymore? You used to love playing with us. The band was your idea.”
“Don’t worry about it. It’s on me. Now move,” Draco leaned towards him to whisper, “Claudia takes forever, and I have a line to get through.” Draco genuinely smiled at him, before plastering his fake one back on for the world to see, pulled back and motioned for Claudia to step forward.
“What do you want?” He all but yelled into Draco’s ear. Draco hadn’t realized the bartender was finally free.
“Fine. Once Greg and I are sloshed, we will dance up on you to your hearts content.” Greg spluttered for a second and Draco watched with glee as Millie glanced at Greg and began to blush. Okay, it probably wasn’t the perfect opportunity, but he couldn’t help himself sometimes. Draco was saved from any scolding by Blaise arriving.
“I don’t care! You pick!” Draco yelled back. Greg shrugged his shoulders and leaned towards the bartender to give his order. Their group was already tipsy from the drinks at the apartment and from the round of tequila shots Pansy made everyone down as soon as they arrived. The rest of their friends went off in search of a table while Greg and Draco stayed behind to order drinks. Draco was regretting offering to help Greg carry everything back after he saw the amount Greg had ordered. The bartender was nice enough to fit everything onto two trays for them to carry.
“In the hallway there was a pair of jeans lying all crumpled. And…and Theo never wears them. Never.” Draco again glanced at his friends, seeking confirmation.
Greg shiftily glanced at Millie before replying to Draco. “Didn’t have anything else going on.” Draco glanced at Millie to see the small smile adorned on her face. He wished they would just get it on already. For years, Greg has been pining after her, and for a while, Millie seemed oblivious to the fact. Over the last year or so, Draco suspects that she finally caught on. Now that Draco wasn’t completely caught up in his life with Theo, maybe he could give them a little nudge in the right direction.  He just had to wait for the perfect opportunity.
“You know it’s pointless if I stay anyway. None of those girls ever want me to wait on them. They just wait for you. I’ll be back in 30 so you’ll be fine.” Daphne patted Draco’s cheek before pulling her apron off and heading into the back.
“Put this on, and these pants.” She threw a pair of black skinny jeans that Draco honestly forgot he even owned. “Wear those black boots I got you two Christmases ago. I’ll be back in 10 minutes to check your progress.”
Draco stopped his thought process where it was. He was already feeling terrible about Theo. It was best to not drudge up old memories. He needed to at least appear as if his life was doing okay, at least for today. He was working the front counter after all.
Millie snapped him out of his thoughts as she pushed a glass into his hand. “Drink up! And make a plate. We’ve all been waiting and we’re starving.”
“To new beginnings and old friends.” He said fondly. They all shouted cheers, clinked their glasses together, and downed their shots.
“I think I’m making it incredibly easy. You tell me what you want to drink, I place the order, you pay me, I give you coffee, and you leave. Very simple process.”
Draco had his elf Bippy send his things to Millie’s apartment. After a long guilt trip from his favorite elf (were they even allowed to do that?) Draco must have dozed off on his new bed.
Draco forgot how much fun the club was, especially this one and its eclectic music choices. Silva’s song melded into Two Feet’s “Go fuck yourself.” Excitement thrummed on the dance floor, and everyone could be heard chanting along to the beginning of the song. Once the beat dropped in Draco found himself swaying sexily to himself. Blaise and Pansy were clearly gone on each other this evening and Draco was thoroughly excited and pleased to see Millie and Greg glued together, bodies rolling to the beat. The song was short, but the DJ seamlessly mixed the end of the song into The Weeknd’s “Wicked Games.
Personally, he didn’t see the point in dressing the part tonight. He wasn’t going to try to hook up. Draco, more than anyone, knew he had issues he needed to work on, and the ache left by Theo was incredibly still new. Tonight, he was going to just spend time with his friends, possibly get plastered, and then maybe go back to the shop to eat a bunch of cake. Like they used to do before Draco and Theo became an item. He was interrupted from his musings as Pansy threw a shirt in his face.
Millie once again nodded; Pansy remained the same. Blaise had stopped eating, but was sitting stock still, fork still clasped his hand.
“Hmm,” Potter pulled his drink away and reached into his pocket to pull out some of his cash, “It seems we didn’t follow the process. I didn’t pay you before I got my drink.”
“Nice running into you again.” Before the mystery man could counter, Draco was lost among the crowd, maneuvering his way towards his friends.
Draco felt guilty for having said anything at all. The truth was Draco did love his band. Almost every good time he has had since the war had something or other to do with performing and he didn’t want to give it up. Over the last year, though, Theo had become more and more vocal about his distaste for Draco performing. Particularly, performing on stage with Blaise. No matter how often he assured Theo that there was nothing and never would be anything between them, Theo refused to listen. His jealousy was one thing that Draco was sure he wouldn’t miss.
Draco sighed. Every Wednesday around 1pm, the dance studio down the street let out for an hour break. Most of the girls, and some guys, were college aged and always found their way to Brewer’s Alchemy. Usually they’d buy coffee or, sit in the chairs, and chat. The most daring would hang close to the counter and try to catch Draco’s eye. Draco’s employees thought it was funny. Draco found it annoying.
“The worst,” Draco agreed around a soft pant, tilting his head up to allow Harry just the access he needed to nip at already bruised skin. Harry had thought the man had been beautiful in the light of a full moon, but he was now certain that there was nothing more beautiful than Draco Malfoy groggy and half-asleep and hopelessly turned on in the early morning slips of sun that fell over their shared bed. “It’s just going to end in tragedy.”
“Alright. So maybe for this, flowers to represent you and your dad, yeah? What kind of flower works for him?” Harry went towards the fresh batch of narcissus he had gotten in the other day, picking out a good, fresh bunch and wrapping them in the plastic.
“Good, because it’s all you’re getting.” With that, Harry shoved the bouquet into Draco’s hands, forcing him to hold it before he tied it off with a bright pink ribbon.
Instead he just gave a low whistle followed by an idiotic, “Rotten luck about the renovations, huh?”
“Pancella-!” Draco hissed, and oh, she was never going to hear any good gossip from him ever again! “I am not going on this little suicidal mission you seem so intent on putting together with Granger of all people!”
“Excellent!” Pansy clapped her hands together before whisking Granger away to another part of the house to no doubt seduce her into more misdeeds. Weasley, vapid git that he was, didn’t even seem bothered by the Pansy and Granger bonding.
Draco started to lean away, and Harry had a hand on the back of the other’s neck before he could move more than a breath away. Draco froze in his grip and Harry was overcome with the same feeling he always had when he was on the verge of doing something stupid and incredible and overwhelming.
Harry gave a grin, popping his cheek up on his fist as he leaned over the counter, “Dunno. Guess I’m just that good.”
Draco's eyes narrowed at him. "Have you ever given me reason to before?" Ah, well… he’d give Draco that one.
Ah, there it was. Draco finally seemed to realize what Harry had been trying to tell him all night. Honestly, he shouldn’t be surprised that Draco was immediately trying to hide his face, cheeks flushed an even brighter red than they were when Harry had him on his back and was pounding into him. “You-! You can’t just-! Bloody prat-!”
"Oh, absolutely. Always goes on about that sort of thing." Yeah, that sounded about right for the Malfoys — especially for Draco’s mom.
“Huh. Alright.” Harry thought for a moment, staring at the flowers he already had. “I dunno, is your mom into the flower meaning stuff any?”
“Maybe,” Harry allowed, going back to pressing soft kisses against wherever he could reach, grinning when Draco relaxed into the touches. “You wanna hear what I think, though?”
“Oh, that’s right, you were just telling me about that! Your aunt is doing renovations in most of the bedrooms here at the moment, right?” Granger was smiling but the look in her eyes was pure evil. Pansy, the little tart, seemed to get off on it, beaming.
“It’s a vacation, Blaise,” Pansy lied to their faces, rolling her eyes as if she was in the right. “It’s not as if I’m signing you up for your deaths — besides, we’ll be going to my aunt’s beach house! Draco, darling, you love it there!”
It was the feeling of facing down dragons, and Death Eaters, and mermaids, and the corrupted Ministry, and Tom Riddle, and Dumbledore’s plans, and Death, and it was the feeling of not yet. I’m not ready to let go yet.
The scoff that Draco gave was as familiar as it had been over all those years. "Am I just supposed to trust your word for it?"
Draco had half a hope that Potter would actually throw his weight around for once and get them out of the mess they were about to be stuck in, but then he looked at Granger. Potter heaved a sigh, tone dull as he responded with defeat, “I’d be perfectly fine with it, yeah.”
“So I didn’t.” Harry didn’t even bother to make a show of looking around. “Guess that means it’ll work for sure, won’t it?”
“Probably,” Draco repeated absently, those grey eyes warm and soft and still edged with sleep. “Harry…” The soft call of his name had shivers running down Harry’s back before he could even try to stop them. He was pretty sure he had never heard a better sound than Draco Malfoy calling his name like that. “It’s… It can’t be this simple.”
Honestly… he should not be grinning so much at the thought of him and his little flower shop getting another visit from
Draco thought about it before finally nodding. "Yes… Yes, I think that just might do it." Harry looked down at the flowers, a mix of blues, whites, and pinks, and couldn’t stop himself from giving a bit of a grin. Definitely one of his best yet.
Draco huffed, crossing his arms. He actually looked contrite. "I need a bouquet. A third of it will be Narcissus, but I can't decide on the other two flowers." Huh. Contrite Draco asking for his help and needing a bouquet that was one-third
The silence of the night was only broken by crashing, breaking waves of the ocean only a few dozen feet away and the whisper-soft words of, “You’re staring.” Harry, who made absolutely no move to look away, couldn’t help the amused quirk of his lips as his hands moved. Sand still stuck to his palms, but instead they pressed into those chilled thighs, Harry feeling a thrill at the shiver that wracked through the body of Draco Malfoy.
“Of course,” Draco scoffed, looking away sharply. “The fool probably just jumped at the chance of tormenting me, no doubt.” Still, though… For a moment, just a moment, Draco had heard Potter was going and he felt something like…
"Alright," Draco said with a nod. "It needs something else though, doesn't it? It feels like it." He was right. It did need something else. They had blue and white… a nice pink would go well, maybe.
“That’s the part I’m worried about,” Weasley snorted, the heathen. He then glared at Draco, who made sure to give his own nasty glare back. “Perfect chance for a ferret to slit some throats-”
“Honestly, Draco,” Pansy scoffed, settling back with her own cup and a disappointed cluck of her tongue. “You simply must get over this delusion that you hate Potter when we all want to know you want nothing more than for him to shag you silly-”
“It’ll work,” Harry said firmly. “I know you’re not good at the whole believing me thing, yet, but I have my own faith you’ll get there.”
“So, then.” Pansy sounded close to laughing, Draco firm in keeping his gaze on his empty tea cup, faint memories of tea leaves and their meanings stirring at the back of his mind. “Do you want to go on a vacation with us, Draco?”
“I can do whatever I want,” Harry teased, guiding Draco closer so the man could hide his face against Harry’s chest like he so desperately wanted. Harry wasn’t too upset about it. He had a feeling he would be seeing Draco’s flushed face far more in the future. “Haven’t you heard? I’m the Chosen One.”
Pansy looked at him, something like sympathy warming her expression. It was far worse than any mocking she could have done. “Actually, Hermione mentioned to me that he hadn’t wanted to go at all until he knew you- Sorry, ‘we’ were going.”
“Are you bloody mental?” Blaise shook his head, paused, and then shook it again. “Is this punishment for something? Have you been imperioused?”
Harry cut Draco off in his new favorite way, smothering the words with a kiss that Draco slowly but surely fell into. It was not long enough, in Harry’s opinion, when Draco pulled away with a pout, “Stop that. It shouldn’t- It shouldn’t be so simple.”
Harry breathed in the crisp night air sharply, collapsed on the ground and still trying to regain his breath as he shivered at the cold, wet sand pressing against his bare back as warm palms dug into his shoulders. The heat of the palms only grew more prominent as fingers grasped at his skin even harder, Harry’s attention soon shattered and shot as he felt chilled, bare thighs pressed into the skin just above his hips.
Draco opened his mouth to argue because like bloody hell that was true. Their little ‘group vacation’ was taking place at the beach house of Pansy’s aunt, and if that woman was one thing it was extravagant. Unfortunately, before Draco could craft an argument that would get him his way, Granger stepped in.
“I do, yes,” Draco agreed, voice harsh from where he had almost died. “It just so happens that I also like it when it’s the three of us and not the three people in this world who most want me dead.”
Looking at him, and at the flowers, Draco finally sighed. "Is this really going to work?" Harry waited until Draco looked up at the flowers and back towards him.
Surely it wouldn’t hurt for the two of them to be just Draco and Harry for just a bit longer. After all… they had time.
Harry bit back the sharp hiss of what was certainly not pain, instead looking up as he noticed stormy grey eyes looking into his own. They truly were a storm in their own right, swirling with magic and emotion and apologies and explanations and begging and so much. It was the most Draco had ever spoken to him and it was all said without a word.
“Hush. I have an empty guest bedroom with your name on it. At least until you figure out where you want to go.” She turned to walk back to the employee break area, leaving Draco staring after. She returned a moment later and held a key out in front of her. “Here you go roomie. Take this, get your stuff, and stop working. My shift will be over in an hour. I’ll pick up some terrible take-out and a bunch of wine.”
“…I loved him…” Draco said meekly, sniffled and then finished his wine. He should probably slow down, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Alright gang! Drink up! To new beginnings and old friends!” Millie thrust her shot out to the middle of the table. Looking down, Draco saw a shot placed in front of each of his friends. He took a seat in the curved booth near the end. Everyone sat with their shots in the air, glaring at him to join. Draco, in turn, took the opportunity to look each of his friends in the eye. He was grateful for every single one of them and wondered for the thousandth time where he would be if they hadn’t stubbornly glued themselves to his side.
“Hmmm. Right. Well tonight, we are going to drink and eat until we pass out. And tomorrow night, we are going out.” Pansy finally sat he wine glass down and began to eat.
Greg shrugged nonchalantly, “Didn’t feel like coming back for a while.” He grabbed a tray and took off in the direction they saw the others disappear to.
“Well, how much do I owe you?” Potter began reaching towards his back pocket to pull out his wallet.  Finally, Draco locked eyes with the man again, smile still in place.
With the lights on and apron around his waist, Draco took a steadying breath and let calm rush back over him. This was his safe place. He controlled this shop and everything in it. Not matter how much Millie tried to argue with him about the matter. Methodically, he moved around, turning on the machines for the day and prepping the display case of the baked goods he carried. Knowing Millie, she would show up in another 10 minutes or so. Daphne would be in even later to be Draco’s closer for the day. The shop wouldn’t be open for another 30 minutes, so Draco walked back to what his team affectionately referred to as his lab. He was attempting to create a new blend, but the notes he was hitting weren’t right yet. He knew he was getting close though. He had this idea of infusing something sweet and tart but had yet to land on a taste that he enjoyed thoroughly enough to sell to his customers. Today he was trying Orange zest with pumpkin. If it didn’t hit the target he was aiming at, it could always be something he used during the fall.
“Is that so?” Potter turned his body more towards Draco’s, smilingly coyly at the blush that was suddenly over taking Draco’s pale skin.
Walking the streets of London at three in the afternoon did nothing to alleviate his mind. He was just a speck amid a sea of people. Were there always this many couples walking around? Draco shoved his hands into the pockets of his denim jacket and turned the corner onto Borough Market. He just needed to get to the shop. Something that was his would help ease his mind. He was sure of it.
“It’s not healthy Pans. You know he should go talk to someone.” Millie whispered over the counter to where Pansy was sipping at her tea.
“See you tomorrow Potter.” Potter closed the door and Draco watched out the window as they pulled away from the club.
Finally coming to his senses, Draco plastered his fake smile back on his face and smiled coyly in her direction, “Don’t let Blaise hear you say that.”
“Oh good. You actually listened for once.” Pansy said as she moved closer to inspect his outfit. She motioned for him to stand and he complied. Then she swiveled her finger, in the universal sign to spin.
“Yes, I’m rehearsing again. It’s not like its even been that long since our last one anyway. Now stop fretting.” Draco kissed Millie on the cheek, ruffled Pansy’s hair, much to her displeasure, and made his way back to the bathroom. Despite his nonchalance, he was actually feeling slightly nervous about going. He knew Greg had stopped trying to reach out and was most likely pissed at him. And while Draco wanted nothing more than to hide beneath his covers and forget that he and the world existed, there was also a part of him that missed the feeling performing with his friends gave him. Draco vowed to never miss another rehearsal.
“Well now that we are all here and ready, I say it is time for us to consume some good alcohol before we have to gulp down that swill at the club. Millie be a dear and help me get the shots poured.” Millie grumbled, but pushed herself from the couch to follow Pansy into the kitchen. Greg’s eyes followed her the whole way out and Draco elbowed him in the side in jest.
“I can’t believe how much you were on Greg last night.” Draco said, chuckling softly. Millie paused in putting her apron on and chucked a paper cup towards his way.
“I’m sure it is wonderful; now would you like to order some coffee or not?” Draco deadpanned, cutting Harry off mid-speech. Harry smirked at him for a moment.
“I’ll be fine once I get some coffee. I can’t believe how much I drank last night.” Millie moved away and made her way to the break room. Draco abandoned his work and followed behind her.
“You guys don’t need to worry about me, so just drop it. I don’t need a doctor, I’m fine. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to get ready to go to rehearsal.”
“I came home after grocery shopping. Was going to make us dinner. Thought it’d be romantic…” He trailed off, took a sip of his wine, and then held his glass closer to his chest. “I didn’t think Theo would be home from work yet. I had told him I was working so that I could surprise him, you know?” At this, he looked up at his friends, searching for validation.
“I can’t feel my arms.” He stated while glaring down at both of his hands. “Why can’t I feel my arms?” Draco could hear panic start to creep into Dylan’s voice when Potter’s laughter could be heard.
“So, I went to the bedroom and I heard rustling. And I’m so stupid, ‘cause I was still trying to make excuses. I thought maybe one of his parent’s elves was just making the bed or something.” Draco paused again and shook his head. He took a long gulp of his wine and sat the glass down on the table in front of him.
Once he stepped into the hallway, he heard Millie and Pansy’s voices echoing from the kitchen. Curious, he dropped his clothes on the bathroom sink and then made his way towards the kitchen.
“What are you doing here?” Potter glanced around as if looking for a rhyme or reason that his old nemesis was standing behind a coffee shop counter wearing an apron.
Draco rolled his eyes, leaving the break room to make his way up front to turn on the lights and flip the sign.
“So, you’re a singer huh? Never would have pegged you for that.” Draco glanced up to see Potter smiling at him while folding the flyer into a square and placing it into his jacket pocket. Damn. Draco was going to hide them if he saw Potter come into his shop. It was just like him to get distracted. He couldn’t let him see that he was getting to him. Potter had to be playing at something.
“Blaise put me down this instant!” It would have seemed threatening if Pansy would have kept from laughing the moment he picked her up.
“Hi Potter. What can I get for you today?” Draco asked again, smile still in place. Potter’s shock caused Draco to relax. This was his turf after all.
Besides, Draco knew he looked good too. Theo was an ass, but he constantly prized Draco’s looks whenever they were out with others. And magical world notwithstanding, Draco pulled looks almost anywhere he went. Possibly not as many as Blaise, but enough to know that he was attractive.
After the dark years, as Draco fondly remembered them as, he found himself more and more occupying his time with muggles. Attending their bars, their restaurants, concert venues, shops, and everything in between. No one looked at him. He was just a regular person and one day while sitting in the park, coffee in hand, writing lyrics out in his beat up spiral notebook, he suddenly had a thought that turned into a dream that became a goal bigger than any other he ever had.
“I’m sure I can convince you.” Dylan placed his hand over Draco’s pectoral and tweaked his nipple. Anger surging within him, Draco was about to turn in the man’s arms to punch him in the face, when a broad chest suddenly filled Draco’s vision.
Millie nodded showing she understood. Pansy sat with her arms crossed over chest, one hand holding her glass aloft. Blaise was eating slowly, keeping his eyes trained on his food.
“Yes I know. That’s perhaps even more dreadful. Never fear, there are still some items that will work for tonight’s excursions.” Pansy disappeared further into the closet and Draco sat rolling his eyes.
“Oh, I’m sorry dear. For some reason you seem to be under the impression that you have a choice in the matter. You are going. I know best after all.” She smirked cheekily and dug in.
“Harry Potter!? My, my my! What a surprise! Blaise, Greg, Millie, look who has brought our Draco back to us!” Draco had to repeat to himself that he did actually love Pansy somewhere deep within his soul, even when she was being a bitch like right now. His friends stopped and looked at Potter, then to Draco, then to their hands, which Draco promptly let go of, and then back to Potter with large grins on their faces. There was at least some satisfaction to be felt at the look of caution that flitted across Potter’s faces.
“Knew I’d catch you later little bird.” He spoke into Draco’s ear and suddenly Draco remembered vividly his last encounter with the man. It had been a month or two before Theo swept Draco away. Draco had been here alone on a weeknight, drinking his sorrows away, ignoring Pansy’s messages, when this man, Dylan was his name, came up to Draco at the bar. They had danced and later fucked in the bathroom stall. Pansy, while upset that Draco was self-medicating in such a way, had found the humor in the situation when Draco went on and on how the man kept referring to him as a bird. One of Draco’s least liked creatures.
“Do you want us to kill him? Maim him maybe? I’m sure I could consult mother.” Draco rolled his eyes at Blaise’s questioning and slowly pulled away from Pansy to pick up his wine glass.
Draco felt the tears pushing again and had to swallow down his feelings twice before he could reply. “Millie, you’re a great friend. Thank you.” He took the key and pocketed it, then placed the broom back against the wall.
“Because it’s a big deal!” The whirl of the blender making the iced coffee was loud enough that Draco had to pause in whatever retort he initially was going to give. Once it quieted, he finally replied, although with less bite than what he most likely would have originally had.
Draco regretted drinking. No. Scratch that. He regretted existing. He never drank much when he was with Theo and, at the moment, he was definitely bemoaning the loss of his high tolerance. Millie’s flat was quiet, which meant that he was most likely the first one awake. Being the owner of a coffee shop meant that when the sun began to rise, your inner clock started going off too. He attempted to open his eyes but thought better of it once the light slammed to the back of his retina. Instead, he fished around blindly for his wand.
“Easy there. Here, let me help you.” Potter placed his hands on Draco’s hips from behind and helped keep him upright on the trek out of the club. Draco made it outside just as the uber pulled up. Millie and Greg climbed inside, followed by Pansy and Blaise. Draco reached out to the door and Potter held his hand as he climbed up into the SUV.
“Look, come to rehearsal. You haven’t been for weeks and the guys miss you. And we can’t reschedule for later in the week because you stupidly always work yourself more than your employees.”
“You guys were right,” He flicked his eyes up to meet Millie’s and saw the concern there. He looked away when he felt his eyes suddenly burning, “I walked in on it… I don’t want to talk about it…”
He had just finished with a blonde girl, who either had something in her eye, or thought she looked cute batting them away at Draco, when his eyes widened and his smile disappeared. Harry Potter was next in line.
Draco wasn’t sure how, but Potter knew to bring him right back to the other side of the room where his friends were still drunkenly dancing together. If Draco had any luck, he could sneak back to them, Potter would disappear, and his friends would be none the wiser that Harry Potter was in the club with them right now. Of course, Draco had terrible luck. Pansy happened to look his way, Potter still grasping onto his hand, guiding him back to his pack. He glared back in her direction, daring her to say anything.
Draco choked on his muffin as he realized that meant that Potter would be coming into his shop again. What did Potter want with him? Panic began to boil inside Draco as his thoughts began racing. Wasn’t he an auror? Maybe he was checking in on past delinquents. Or maybe someone is blaming Draco for a crime he didn’t commit. Well, Draco was not going down without a fight! Potter had another thing coming if he thought he could blame Draco for any wrongdoings. He had done nothing wrong and up until his breakup with Theo, the most exciting thing he did was head out to the grocery store on double coupon days. Nodding with resolve, Draco felt definite that he had the entire scheme figured out. And if there was a single little flicker of hope that Potter may have had feelings for him, well that could just blow right out the window. Draco was no longer a schoolboy and any unnecessary crushes had long since been forgotten. And more to the point, Draco had already concluded that he needed time to find himself anyway, so there was no reason to even ponder that line of thought.
“I’m great. Even better now that I’ve ran into you.” The man raised his eyebrow while he gently trailed his fingers along the back of Draco’s hand.
Draco was able to appease Claudia, and two other girls behind her by making sure they knew Draco remembered them when he addressed them by name. He even threw out a wink or two, much to their giggling pleasure. He was starting to feel uneasy though as he could feel Potter’s eyes latched onto his every move. He felt a modicum of relief when Potter moved away.
“Actually Dylan, I want to go. My friends are waiting for me, so if you don’t mind…” With more force than before, Draco shoved at Dylan’s hands on his hip, but still Dylan clutched to him. “Dylan, I’m not kidding. Let go.” Draco grabbed at this hand and ripped it from his hip. Once the hand was forcefully removed, Draco was spun by Dylan’s other hand on his shoulder to face the taller blonde man.
“Hey Draco, I’m gonna go on break.” Daphne broke Draco out of his mini reverie, causing him to glance down at the time.”
“Well, Potter, you haven’t seen me for years. You barely know me. Now what can I do for you today?” Draco threw his rag into a bucket beneath the counter and picked up his pad and pen to take his order down. He was annoyed again that he was left at the counter alone with Potter, but at least thankful that Millie was on break and that the line had dwindled down for the moment.
“I ordered for you. Now move along.” Draco still had his smile in place. The next girl in line was starting to seem annoyed that she wasn’t getting the opportunity to speak with Draco. The girls behind her were starting to appear antsy.
“Draco, if you think you’re getting off the hook from dancing, you have another thing coming.” Millie stared him down. Millie normally found herself wearing jeans and T-shirts like Draco. Working in the shop could be messy at times and looking amazing was never really on the forefront of their minds while minding the shop. Tonight, however, Millie was a bombshell. He dirty blond hair was curled slightly and she wore a dark red body con dress that showed off her curves and bosom nicely. Not for the first time, Draco thought about how the Hogwarts uniform and robes never did her justice.
Draco grumbled to himself and apologized to the man waiting at the front of the line. He didn’t have time to worry about what just happened. Potter was just playing a game. He probably wouldn’t even show up again. Besides, Draco needed to keep his head clear for practice tonight. He owed it to his bandmates.
“Why would I be anything other?” He handed her the ticket with the order written down and turned back to the counter in time to hear the bell ring again.
I know my updates are few and far between, but I am still definitely working on this. We're inching closer to the halfway mark of this fic and I'm so excited to write it. It was the entire reason I started writing it in the first place.
“Hi. Welcome to Brewer’s Alchemy. What can I get you today?” Draco mentally gave himself a pat on the back. His smile stayed in place, his tone of voice was no different than when he waited on any other customer and judging by how quickly Potter swung his eyes down to meet Draco’s, he surprised the Golden Boy.
“I don’t know…” he whispered, “but I feel like I was. Otherwise, why would this hurt so much?” He shoved a forkful of rice into his mouth and chewed pensively as another tear rolled down his cheek.
The shock must have been evident on Draco’s face because Potter smirked in reply. Draco quickly looked away and picked up the rag he had forgotten to wipe the counter down, giving his hands something to do.
“Thanks for taking care of Draco, but I’m here now.” From an outsider’s perspective, Potter seemed friendly. But Draco knew better. It may have been years, but he had seen Potter smile with that many teeth before and it usually was a bad omen. Also, it was usually directed and Draco and Greg for some reason or other.
Gradually, Draco felt his muscles relax and the pain behind his eyes dissipate. He glanced over at his nightstand where his clock sat and sighed at the time. It was 5:30 in the morning and the shop opened in an hour. He had just enough time to get a shower before walking to his shop. As silently as he could, Draco slithered out of bed and picked out his clothing for the day.
Draco couldn’t even count how many arguments Theo instigated over Draco’s friendship with Blaise. It was the one thing Draco refused to give in on. Blaise was there for him during his darkest times. That year after the war would have probably been the end if Draco had any say about it, but Blaise was always there to pull him kicking and screaming back from the precipice. With the news of his mother, so close after his father, Draco felt he had nothing left to live for.
“Draco! It’s been too long! How have you been?” The man smiled earnestly in Draco’s direction. Shit, why couldn’t he remember this guy’s name?
“This is good. What is it this time?” Potter eyed him as he slowly took a drink from his coffee cup. Draco remembered to breathe as we watched his Adam’s apple move up and down.
Draco vowed to never attend another rehearsal. The day before had been brutal. The usually quiet Greg reprimanded Draco harshly about missing. Even when Blaise told him what happened with Theo, Greg had no sympathy, only stating “good riddance,” and “you can do better,” before he started away on his drums. Michael was a bit more welcoming, but not by much. The bassist simply told him that missing rehearsals “wasn’t cool” and told Draco that he was happy to have their main vocalist back. After Blaise’s outrage of not being good enough, everything felt a bit more natural. Draco still felt awful the entire time.
They met again after the war. Both huddled in the back of the many funeral services that were taking place. Something must have been etched onto Draco’s face for Millie asked Draco to leave with her and get coffee. He had felt relieved and then felt guilty for having a reason to leave. He had been conflicted, but Millie simply took his hand and held it all the way to the apparition point. He still remembers that moment in the sun, the light reflecting off her dirty blonde hair, and she turned around with her big blue eyes and smiled. She was pretty. Beautiful even. He saw what Greg saw in her. He hadn’t spoke with him in so long and wondered if Greg even wanted to speak with him after what had happened with…
“I didn’t know you were coming along tonight.” Draco asked, his eyebrows raised indicated his surprise. Greg was dressed in a pair of dark jeans, a dark gray t shirt and a leather jacket. Not posh in the least, but would fit nicely in with the rest of the muggle crowd that normally attended Smithereens.
“That’s not a no.” Harry was smiling full out while walking backwards towards the door, coffee in hand.
“Pecan cinnamon bun.” Draco’s voice may have been a bit hoarse, but it was dry in here. Draco made a note to invest in a humidifier.
“Well good. You can keep me company at the bar while these loons go off dancing.” Draco moved to sit beside Greg on the couch and flopped down as Millie admonished him.
Draco nodded as he wrote an order down on his pad, “Very well, now if you could move to the end, I have other customers to wait on.” Draco arched his eyebrow again as he tore the page from his pad to hand back to one of his baristas. Turning his charm back on, Draco began taking the line’s orders, making sure to keep his focus ahead of him rather than drifting to the side to watch Potter at the end of the counter. He may have slipped once and was frustrated that when he noticed Potter staring unabashedly at him doing his job, his cheeks went pink once again. He was able to get through the line and moved back to help his employees finish the orders. He had almost forgotten about Potter during the rush, until he moved back to the front to see Potter waiting on him, coffee in hand.
“Potter go stand down there and wait for your name to be called. I can take the next guest!” Draco was already looking at the next customer in line, but Potter still stood waiting.
Draco continued on solo with the line until Daphne came back from break. Together they got through the crowd and sighed relief once the last customer had received their drink. It always astonished Draco how at times, the whole shop could seem filled to the brim, and then all at once, the place would be almost empty. He finally let the fake smile drop from his face and let his head drop into his hands on the counter.
“Shut up. You’re one to talk.” She smirked at him while tying her apron around her waist. Draco stared back in confusion.
Before the bell above the door even rang, he saw the herd of them walking down the sidewalk along his large front window. Taking a deep breath, he plastered a smile on his face and waited for the mob to come up to the counter.
“Perfect. Blaise should be here any minute and then we can be on our way.” Pansy and Draco both moved out to the living room where Millie sat and, surprisingly, Greg.
After seeing the seriousness in which Draco felt about opening his own shop, Pansy got him a meeting with Thomas Nott, Theodore Nott’s father. Thomas had once been considered a death eater, but became useful to the ministry when he disclosed he was only a financial advisor for some of the most nefarious members. He was pardoned completely and had made considerable donations to muggleborn organizations in reparations. He was Draco’s best chance in finding someone to loan him money to begin a muggle business. Thomas, it turned out, was impressed with Draco’s proposal and the level of preparedness Draco brought to their meeting. He agreed that day to fund Draco’s dream. Draco didn’t want to think that Thomas Nott was possibly doing it as a favor for his late mother. The two were close friends during their Hogwarts years.
Draco felt his heart flutter again. Stupid thing needed to get over the shock. “It’s our blueberry cobbler blend. We infuse it here ourselves.” Draco felt nervous for some reason now. Now that the shop was empty, Draco seemed to be on the backfoot.
“Well it was great. I’ll definitely know what to order next time. Thanks again.” Potter smiled full out and Draco suddenly felt his heart flutter again. What was going on? He might need to get it checked out.
Draco chose not to turn around again. Today was going to be long, judging by the customers that were already pouring in and he had rehearsal tonight. He didn’t need anymore drama in his life. He vowed to be drama free.
“They really are two very different things.” She said, eyes never parting from his. Draco looked down at his forgotten food and picked up his fork.
“Oh, for God’s sakes.” Draco scribbled something down onto his ticket pad, turned around and laid the ticket on the back counter for Ellie or Sarah to grab when they were ready.
“My apologies Pansy. It’s not like I had a shit day or anything.” Draco and Pansy loved each other, truly. They were just a bit more volatile in how they showed it. It was something other people didn’t always understand. Theo never had…
Draco made his way back to the counter where Millie was standing, nudging her astonished figure out of the way to turn the lights on in the pastry case.
“Did you really dear? Or did you just think you loved him?” Pansy still sat with her arms crossed. She took a sip from her glass and stared at Draco pointedly over the rim of her glass. Draco stared back but said nothing.
“No, Blaise. But thank you for offering.” He took a large gulp of his wine and grasped his fork to idly pick at his food. He didn’t have an appetite at the moment. Pansy moved back to the corner of the couch across the table.
Potter seemed to search Draco’s face for another moment, smile still in place, before he pushed away from the counter and made his way towards the door. As he was leaving, he waved over his head and called out with one last smirk adorning his face.
“Potter?!” Draco was man enough to admit that he did at times sound like a dramatic teenage girl. Potter smirked at him and then looked up at Dylan, who was still plastered to Draco’s backside and wrapped around him predatorily.
“You told me; I just didn’t want to listen.” Draco grabbed the broom and began sweeping the back room. If he looked at Millie again, he knew he would cry and he already had done that enough today, thank you very much.
Part of him just wanted to be left alone. He didn’t want to talk about what happened. He didn’t want to rehash walking into his home and seeing unfamiliar shoes lying haphazardly on the floor, followed by other strange pieces of clothing leading the way to his bedroom door. He didn’t want to relive slowly opening the door to see his boyfriend balls deep in some stranger riding him in their four-poster bed. He didn’t want to recount how he had locked eyes with the strange man and seeing confusion there. He certainly doesn’t want to think about what was reflected in his own.
Draco almost gagged at his words and tried to move away once again. “Sorry Dylan, but I can’t right now.”
Draco pulled a face when Dylan began kissing his neck. “Um hey Dylan, I gotta go. My friends are waiting on me.” Draco moved his hands to those on his waist and moved to push them off. Instead one hand moved up Draco’s chest while the other creeped towards his groin.
Draco took a spot on the floor and piled rice and veg onto his plate. Besides the scraping of the dishes, silence echoed throughout the room. He felt their stares burrowing into him.
Draco had to admit, he looked good. Theo rarely liked it when Draco dressed up unless it was for a business function. He grabbed some gel from atop his dresser and set about tousling his hair. Once he deemed it passable for the club, he delved back into his closet looking for the boots Pansy had gifted him. Working, he favored trainers more than anything, but he had to admit, nothing compared to the dragonhide boots that pansy had imbued with an infinite cushioning charm.
“Really Pansy? Tequila again? Do you want me to black out?” Draco griped at her side. Potter chuckled to his left.
“Potter you have your coffee and I have customers to wait on. Go.” Draco made a shooing motion as he picked up his pad and pen once more.
Blaise threw his fork angrily at his plate, “Good riddance Draco. He was an ass in school and he’s an even bigger ass now. You deserve so much more than that prick. You have us to go to. We are your family, and at the end of the day, that’s what matters.”
“Our chariot awaits young Queen!” Blaise shouted before picking Pansy up and throwing her over his shoulder.
Draco opened his eyes and looked over at Potter, asleep on the makeshift bed. Only Potter could manage to look so careless sleeping off multiple broken bones and a dislocated shoulder (okay, the broken bones were fingers and an ankle, but still). At this point, if Potter told him he was actually some kind of superhuman Draco would only be mildly surprised.
Draco shut up, sat down, and picked up a fork. The noodles tasted nothing like the house elves’ at the Manor, and not at all like the ones at Hgwarts. Not over or undercooked, but the red sauce was excessively cheesy. Draco found it endearing, somehow. He could hear Campbell and Elise prattling on on the other side of the table.
As he walked closer to his house he saw that a familiar blond figure was pacing on the porch. Stella ran up to him, nearly knocking him over. He petted her back for a few seconds before he saw Harry. Then he stiffened and stood.
They sat at the card table, Potter still claiming Draco’s chair. The soup was surprisingly good, but Draco supposed it shouldn’t have been a surprise. After all, the man
She sniffed hello to the pair of sheep that had taken to hanging around near the little bend in the street in between his house and Campbell and Elise’s. The larger sheep blinked at Stella with a clear aura of generic disdain, but the smaller one timidly sniffed Stella back. Harry bent down to give the smaller one a scratch behind the ears, but the larger one butted into Harry’s hand before he could reach it.
“And I suspect Mr. Potter will do whatever he wishes, despite what us poor benefactors choose for him,” she said.
Malfoy was starting to drop off now, slowing at the end of some sentences, then starting the next one too quickly to make up for it. Harry smiled to himself.
He went on to explain the story, how he had felt something drawing him to Draco, something tighter and more urgent than he had ever felt. It was like he had gotten so used to living on takeout and now someone had treated him to a homemade meal. Harry had gotten so used to living without wanting Draco that when he realized (or at least projected) that Draco wanted him as well, a new desire had lit under him.
God, Hermione. He had called her the other day. She had asked him where he was and if he wanted to talk. He said of course he wanted to talk, ‘Mione,’ it’s why he called her. He asked about Ron. She and him were engaged, right? It’s been awhile. It has, she said. It’s been too long, Harry. Why did you leave? Because I didn’t want to stay, he had said. But he didn’t want to go over that again. S’not fun, he had said. S’not polite conversation, is it?
“No, no. I don’t want to trouble you. I have a feeling it will take a very long time for them to ship anything,” Draco wasn’t accustomed to being aggressively cared for. He didn’t like it.
“Don’t push your luck, Potter. You’re lucky I’m playing for you. I haven’t practiced in years and I’ll probably need sheet music,” Malfoy said.
Mother tilted her head just so, just as she had been taught to by her mother to indicate that she was sympathetic to the speaker. She beckoned for Draco to continue without words or gesture.
...I just want to talk to him, you know? First I’ll tell him I’m sorry, then I’ll demand an apology. I’ll be like hey, Posh Spice, sorry, but you gotta pull your own weight, too…
Draco reached down to hold Potter’s hand, give it a reassuring squeeze or something, but Potter beat him to it. He felt a warm calloused hand clasp over his own and became painfully aware of how slender and soft his own hand was. But after Potter had released it, Draco felt a strange sense of loss.
Malfoy jumped awake, one hand on his wand, other hand on his nose. Luna deflected the jinxes he threw.
“–should have been able to happen to stumble upon my town. This is my town, Malfoy, and I don’t need you polluting it!”
Campbell made a shrugging noise. “Just hope we haven’t scared off the boy. I was starting to like him.”
“You think they look good?” Harry said, trying to untangle himself from the ruffled collar of the yellow ensemble.
They looked up guiltily. Probably in cahoots with Malfoy. He’d imperiursed them or something. Or even worse, they were helping him
And do something, he thought, finishing the thought lamely. He couldn’t very well go over and kiss the bloke, now. That could cause all kinds of problems. But anything less would be superficial.
“That you knew where Harry is," she continued. "If you can convince him to help, he’d be your best chance.”
He slipped on the dark pants. At first glance they were black, but they shined green in the light. He peeked in the pockets, and embroidered dragons peeked out at him.
“But that doesn’t mean you need to stretch this out longer than it has to be,” Campbell interrupted from the kitchen. “You need to get things straight between you both. When Elise and I–”
The next day was much the same, except Lydia stopped by. They had a lovely conversation about the properties of newt’s eyes and the possible more humane substitution of mustard seed.
The force pulled him backwards into a room and slammed the door, then released him. Draco stood uneasily, breathing heavily. Lavender walls, bay window, piano.
His mother shot him the same glare she used on him when he was seven years old and complaining about not getting a third dessert. “
So that one was an aloof sheep? Harry took that tidbit of information and tucked it in his brain for later potential use.
Mother motioned for both of them to sit on the pale green sofa. Potter crossed over Draco so he could sit on the right. Odd, but permissible. Mother sat in a chair across from them.
charms every two seconds. Draco kept his smirk to himself as he pushed the press down, trapping the crushed beans in the bottom of the contraption. He summoned a mug and poured his coffee into it. After an excruciatingly slow sip (Weasley’s eye twitched!), Draco was ready. “Disappoint me, please,”
“Thank you,” Draco said. “And seriously, I don’t need you to do this for me. I could manage well enough on my own,”
The rain had stopped at a drizzle, which Draco was marginally thankful for. A pair of sheep were chewing thoughtfully on the road. He looked for the flock, but they were a fair distance away on the side of a hill.
“No, they pay people off. But Blacks know how to read a situation, and this situation calls for groveling.” Narcissa motioned for him to rise. “Good day, Draco. Come back soon,”
Draco scowled, counting out the muggle bills the goblin handed him. “You’re supposed to be sorry for me,”
‘Of course, Draco, you’re brilliant! I regret marring your perfect physique in the bathroom! I think about it day and night with no reprieve! I’m so sorry for my lapse in judgement! But just between you and me, I think they’re very sexy!’”
As they approached the store, Harry cast a subtle tempus. 11:25. Perfect. Campbell didn’t usually start lunch until 11:30.
So he would just happen to head into Campbell and Elise’s bookstore to look for something to read and Malfoy would be heading over for lunch at about that time. But then Harry would engage him in some sort of talk about what sort of book would be best to look for, and Malfoy would have to excuse himself on account of being so hungry for lunch. Harry, brilliant and prepared as always, would invite Malfoy back to his. After all, he might have made a bit too big of a pizza and it would be a shame to let good food go to waste. Malfoy would walk in and say something like, “wow, Potter, this smells delicious!” Then Harry would tease him about never eating and Malfoy would look slightly guilty, but it would be alright because Harry would say hey, Malfoy, what if you just come to mine for lunch every Friday afternoon? I cook only for myself, really, and I’d like some outward opinions, seeing as we’re friends and all. To which Malfoy would respond–
He was in the music room. The indirect noon light glinted off the selection of flutes to his left and glittered on harp strings.
“What the fuck? Leave, Malfoy.” He said, all remnants of relaxation gone from his body. “I’m not interested in any interviews for whatever shit reporter you’ve got up your sleeve.”
Because beauty rest was the only way to describe it. Malfoy’s platinum hair messily flipped across his forehead, a forehead smoothed over with eyebrows calm and relaxed. His lips parted, and Harry could have sworn he was smiling in his sleep. But whatever. It was late at night and Harry was getting too poetic for his own good.
“In that case, I would like to extend a formal apology on behalf of the Auror department that your image was taken and produced without your express consent, and–”
Draco opened the door and felt a cool rush of energy under his feet and through his fingers, and he knew all the rooms were in their proper places again without having to check.
He turned back to Hermione and the pizza. She had this look of determination on her face, like if the circle of sauce and cheese wasn’t precisely concentric to the circle of bread the world would end. She had emptied over three-quarters of the sauce jar and nearly all the bag of cheese already. With a wave of his hand, Harry stopped the knives from cutting more mushrooms and asparagus.
He made an effort to smile. It didn’t work. “There’s these older women who’ve adopted me, sort of. And the granddaughter of the electronic repairman,”
“I thought all the Death Eater shit was over,” Blaise remarked. “The Ministry can’t blame you any more than they can blame themselves,”
Right under the door seemed to bet he best place to start. He began rubbing the vinegar on the floorboards. It should be okay, he convinced himself. These were bare, unwaxed floorboards. Mother wasn’t about to burst in and demand to know what in Merlin’s name was going on. The Lesbian couple who lived across the way had told him to do this. They knew what they were doing.
“I think if we want to keep the Manor,” Narcissa fixed Draco with her cool stare. “You’re going to have to find Mr. Potter and do a bit of old-fashioned groveling,”
Draco looked down to see his pale thin fingers entwined by Potter’s rough and dark ones. “No, you’re holding mine,” he said petulantly. Potter rolled his eyes and Draco took the opportunity to not only snatch his hand away, but also lecture Potter on the Malfoy rules. “My mother is scary. Everything she says to you is a test. If you don’t pass, well, I’m not sure what will happen but I’m not eager to find out. You shouldn’t be, either. Also, don’t touch anything with a cover or in a cupboard or cabinet if you haven’t seen Mother or I touch it first. There’s a lot of lingering Dark magic, even in this Wing on the Manor, and with Lucius–”
Alexandre stepped forward. “Mr. Potter!” He said in lightly accented English, “A pleasure to be serving you today at Lefevre’s. Should you want to employ my services again, you may contact me via the information on this card.” A matte navy card appeared in Harry’s hand.
A young woman in her late twenties or early thirties stepped into the room. She stopped and stared at Draco for about thirty seconds. “Yes, grandfather?” She said, still staring at Draco.
They weeded for an hour or so in silence. If George noticed that Harry seemed to be moving through his garden at a much faster rate than seemed possible, he didn’t say anything. And when Harry noticed that George had started sweating a bit, he didn’t say anything, either. He just stood up and cracked his back with a sigh, and an offhand comment about how weeding too much in one day can upset the soil.
They continued on, after the sun had set and Malfoy had lit his wand for light, Malfoy reading aloud and Harry listening, enraptured.
“Really? Not even a second?” Draco goaded. “Not even the part where I was the most beautiful person in the world?”
Draco decided he agreed. Working with Hermione was more cathartic than continuing to think about Harry and the patronuses and how their magic saw each other as the most compatible people ever and how that meant that if they started anything it would be a huge success but Draco didn’t deserve success and–
He fluttered his fingers between a few notes, creating tension and then resolving with a flick of his wrists above the keys.
So Harry had broken bones. It couldn’t be the shoulder, and the rest of his body was strangely numb, probably from immobilization and stasis charms.
Harry Potter. It’s fine. Draco had dealt with Potter before. He had dealt with him for six years. Of course, that wasn’t the main issue.
And half an hour later, Harry tuned into his broadcasting frequency and said words he knew that only his mind healer was listening to. And maybe George.
He chewed and swallowed the pizza. He wanted to resist her hug, but he didn’t have the energy and it was nice to be hugged every once in a while. “I don’t hate him, I don’t think,” he said.
Draco’s doorbell rang downstairs. He cursed under his breath, then mentally prepared himself for the journey through the empty shop.
There was this thing Draco had learned to do, back during fifth year, refined during sixth year, perfected during seventh year, where he just shut off all his emotions and allowed his body to walk around with fog for brains until he had done what needed to be done.
“If you will remove your clothes and take a step onto the platform, I can begin with the tailoring,”
Draco came to the same bend in the road Potter’s dog had been lurking at yesterday. The two sheep from yesterday were there instead.
“It’s okay, father. He’s dead,” Draco said, gently removing his arm from Lucius’s grasp. Lucius took a step back to steady himself, but his knee buckled.
And then there was silence. Malfoy’s head rested on the back of his chair, one arm curled around a leg and the other leg resting on the floor. Just as the book slid out of his grasp, Harry cast a levitation charm to ease it to the ground. Couldn’t have any loud noise startling Malfoy out of his beauty rest, now could he?
“...And it’s just a piece for beginners,” Draco was saying as he walked toward Harry to collect the folder. “The real arrangement is much more difficult. This was not only abridged, but also simplified. So it really wasn’t all that impressive,”
He looked at his hands, gripping the sink. Blood pounded in his ears and he felt the telltale dizzying buzz of adrenaline. He looked in the mirror. Wild eyes looked back at him. God, no wonder Malfoy had looked scared. Anyone would be.
Malfoy seemed to have gone into some sort of trance when Harry had asked him. He thought about snapping his fingers, waving his hand in front of Malfoy’s face. He could still do that, he figured, despite injured arms and fingers. His right arm was already feeling a lot better, and he didn’t need fingers to wave. And he could snap with his right hand perfectly fine, anyway.
He didn’t mean it. Draco knew this as the man who used to be his father accepted Draco’s hand and stood. Lucius passed him to open the door and Draco knew that his father never apologized for anything. He followed Lucius down the hallway, not the one from before but the proper one, and Draco knew that he had only apologized out of a habit to gain the upper hand. Since Lucius had apologized, the wrongs would not longer be addressed.
The Supreme Mugwump tapped his wand to end the session and Draco realized he hadn’t listened to any of it. Shit.
“Oh, piss off,” Elise retorted lovingly. “Anyway, whenever I sent him Easter flowers he shredded them,”
He and Luna had been friendly for nearly two years now. Just before his trial, they had thrown him in Azkaban for a couple weeks. Luna had visited him every other day, smuggling in good food and her favorite novels. She said she was only repaying him for what she owed to him. That much was true. Draco had given her an Ollivander bread and fruit when they were imprisoned in his basement. But Luna had continued visiting him periodically even outside Azkaban and they had struck up a friendship.
Harry sincerely doubted that, but came in anyway, making sure to take off his trainers. Looking at them, he supposed they were a little grey where they should be white, and a little brown where they should be grey. He referred to it as ‘worn-in.’
As he blinked away the sleep in his eyes, he recognized the cloud as Luna, dressed in a floaty pink tulle dress.
“About two and a half months now, since the day after I met him in the street by accident,” Potter said, and Draco relaxed.
Draco had played piano for him once, and now Harry had gone all third-year at Madame Puddifoot’s. It had to be Elise’s old, wise, artsy, and hopelessly romantic matchmaker influence. Not sure how, it just was.
He met Potter’s eyes and the recognition he found in them was almost comical. They were kind, smiling at the edges at first, then they squinted and the irises darted around, scanning Draco’s face. Finally, they widened and Potter snatched his hand away.
Just when Harry had made up his mind to hit Malfoy with another pillow, he snapped out of his trance.
There was a huge bay window on the far side, backlighting the grand piano in the center. It was a beautiful instrument, Harry assumed. The larger and more ostentatious the instrument, the more valuable it probably was.
He’d gone to Snape’s trial, about a month before he’d left. Trial for a dead man gets pushed to the bottom. Harry’d basically gone in, said some stuff, and the mugwumps has put in a request for a plaque and a portrait.
“What, like you do? We’re twenty-one, Potter. It’s not like either of us graduated from culinary school.” Malfoy started to turn back around.
They walked together the whole two kilometers there not in any semblance of silence. See, Harry somehow knew the right questions to discover that Hermione and Ron had a nice little flat in wizarding London not too far from Diagon. Ron’s job was terribly taxing at the moment, mostly menial tasks and enforcement, but Hermione was glad for it. As Harry was discovering, she didn’t want an exciting life full of risks anymore, and had begun to realize she had never wanted it.
This clearly hadn’t been the question Malfoy had been prepared to answer, and his face smoothed over into that look Harry was already hating, although he’d only seen if a few times.
The women apologized profusely to each other and to him, interrupting each other and making a general kindhearted cacophony.
“I don’t care. How did you even find me? Don’t answer that,” He turned around. “I better not see you again. Fuck.”
Draco swallowed. “Because I don’t want it. I’d never live there, and cruel as I am, I wouldn’t want the Manor to just crumble from disuse. What we need is a new bloodline to shift Malfoy Manor to, and we need to do it before the reinspection is due. When is that, again?”
Then Draco cried. They weren’t huge sobs that wracked his body and tore something out from inside him, nor was it the sweet pitter-patter of a lover’s tears in the movies, full of too-subtle sorrow. He cried like a leaking pipe, tears dripping down cyclically and unhindered. He cried with a blotchy red face and unblinking eyes, a mouth statuesquely open with his fingers jammed between his clenched teeth. It wasn’t cathartic. It was pain and indecision.
“Oh, yes! The pear. I’ve put her in and she’s doing very well,” Harry said, feeling slightly guilty. He had, in fact, relied mainly on stasis charms to transplant the sapling, but as far as The Mums were concerned, he was a master gardener.
He found himself looking at Draco’s hands again, looking at them twist around pens and papers and book covers.
Malfoy calls him into his home, presumably, and offers Harry an afternoon completely wasted. Then the reporter shows up (if what that idiot does can be considered reporting) and he gets kidnapped? Harry had a right to be angry. He had a right to storm home and never seen Malfoy again.
But night passed into morning without Draco’s permission and he remained rooted to the cold marble. He turned to look at himself in the mirror.
“Absolutely not. I don’t know if he even charges money, half the time,” she said, busying herself with the kettle. “What type?”
Harry peeked outside: no Malfoy in sight. He checked the time. It was well past ten-twenty. The git had been
At eight he would water all the house-plants and herbs: the ferns at the entryway, figs in the bedroom, aloe and thyme in the downstairs bathroom, more aloe and lemon balm in the upstairs bathroom, and all the cooking herbs in the kitchen.
“I’ve decided he’s just a little bitch and I don’t want to bother with him any more.” Harry declared.
The tears ran down his cheeks and down his neck at a weird angle and he couldn’t do anything to wipe them away, to dignify himself. He might stay like this forever.
“Of course, love.” Campbell plowed on. “I hope he gets something nice for his wife’s birthday on Sunday. She deserves it,”
Once upon a time, those words would have gone straight to Harry’s heart. He would have took it as ridicule, or worse, pity. A year ago, Harry would have returned Victor’s lighthearted teasing with a glare that could slice marble like butter. He would have demanded to know why Victor thought he was so high and mighty, why he was the judge of what a family is. But it’s not a year ago. So Harry spun on his stool to face Victor and said, “You forgot the vegetable garden,”
Elise grabbed it out of his hand. “Guests don’t have to do the washing up,” She waited while he remained standing for several seconds. “What are you waiting for? Go grab your things!”
Granger? Weasley really just suggested that Draco talk to Hermione Granger about saving the Manor she was tortured in. Interesting.
“How.” Potter grit out. “Did Mister Orion. N. Ager. Know where to find me?” His eyes bored into Draco and the man seemed to grow a good six inches.
“Draco,” His mother started, making Draco’s head snap to attention. “Have you gathered any news about the Manor case? I understand you’ve hired Miss Granger,”
She sighed. Ever since she cleaned up that paper article Hermione had become especially militant about homophobic remarks from Ron, other Weasleys, and the entire population of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, Harry was included in the entire population of the United Kingdom.
“You better listen close, Potter. I’m not some sort of windup monkey you can ask to play as a party trick,”
“He wasn’t off the street! I came into his store. And goodness knows he needed it. Poor kid probably hasn’t eaten in two days. He’s skinny as a rail!”
“What, are you suggesting we’re going to sneak off into a corner somewhere? Hoping, maybe? Don’t be juvenile,”
Pansy was, of course, very smug about the whole ordeal. She slunk against the folding chair, gazing at the collage of Potter’s love life. “I see you found the articles interesting?”
Malfoy rambled on about coffee brewing methods and books on entrepreneurship and consumer psychology for the entire walk. His hands danced while he spoke, punctuating the right sentences with a wave of the wrist or a little twiddle of the fingers. Harry found himself completely entranced. It was like watching a ballet; every movement was so precise, so intentional, so natural, and yet Harry knew that he could never hope to emulate it. Malfoy was a performance. And that didn’t say anything about his hair–
“Of course,” she said, thankfully looking not at all out of place in his yellow-walled plant-filled kitchen. “But that’s not why I came,”
Draco raised an eyebrow and the hint of a smile graced his face. “I didn’t know you watched muggle movies,”
A few days later, Harry had testified for Narcissa. She saved his life, he saved hers. Ashe had gotten one year in prison, a permanent Trace to detect Dark magic, and house arrest for five years.
They discussed old George, his granddaughter Lydia, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson of the pub, and all the people The Mums could think of.
Then Harry remembered that Malfoy was staying with Campbell and Elise, probably because he had no furniture. Best guess was that the program he was with had promised to deliver whatever handcrafted masterpieces Malfoy insisted upon, but hadn’t yet fulfilled their promise.
He walked towards it, but a glint to his left demanded his attention. He turned to see a row of flutes suspended in the air. He reached over to grab the first one, then thought better of it. It was tempting, though. Something about the golden and silver was so inviting, so graspable.
Steam oozed through the crack where the bathroom door met doorway. Harry heard some sort of muffled noise coming from inside. He pressed his ear up to the door and could just make out what Malfoy was saying.
on another note, my English teacher keeps posting our questions of the day at like 1:30 am. should I be concerned for her? lol ma'am you're not allowed to have an unhealthy sleep schedule. that's for your students to relish.
Draco had read a few books and dissertations on the subject while he was working out his own patronus and he’d learned three things that were applicable.
Malfoy rose from the bed, letting the blanket fall off him, then he folded it neatly and placing it on the corner. His sweatshirt had risen to somewhere around his mid-back, showing Harry the knobbly bumps of his spine. Malfoy’s ribs stuck out not prominently, but reasonably enough that Harry could tell where they ended. The skin covering them was smooth and pale, and the stripes of light from the blinds formed a pleasing sort of pattern over them. Malfoy adjusted his sweatshirt, pulling it back down to his hips. Harry felt his gaze drifting downward, then checked himself and started analyzing Malfoy’s hair.
” Draco shouted, pointing his wand at an entire wall. It turned grey. It was disconcerting to know it was supposed to be even more discolored. At least the stain disappeared. Merlin, it might be better to just tear the whole place down and rebuild. Maybe that way he could build furniture into the flat rather than rely on a crusty card table, single folding chair, beige sofa, and television stand. There was no television. He could transfigure it into more tasteful furnishings, but everyone knew transfigured items were vastly inferior. Besides, REFS had said his shipment would arrive within the week. Draco could stand a few days in squalor.
But Potter muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “you’re the one doing any eye-fucking” and Draco felt his skin burn pink.
If Draco wanted to, he could have kissed him. No leaning, no nothing. He found himself afraid to breathe for fear Potter would breathe in his scent a bit too much and Draco would be trapped like a genie in a bottle. Afraid Potter would breathe in Draco’s scent like  he was breathing in Potter’s. It was a dizzyingly clean sort of aroma. Potter smelled of dirt and soup and vegetables and something just so alive. Potter, in short, was intoxicating. What other explanation was there? Draco felt more than a little drunk and it wasn’t even nine-o-clock.
It was subtle enough that anyone else would have just heard Malfoy, but Harry, who’d been trained in listening to Malfoy across dining halls and classrooms, could tell the little ticks and changes in tone he contributed to each character. Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy himself knew about it. After all, he seemed so invested in each new entry. Maybe it was subconscious.
He supposed the rooms near the sun parlor would be first priority, but given that the rooms had been knocked out of order it was hard to be sure. Maybe Potter had gone in the first room he’d seen, but it had actually been one of the spare bedrooms. And then he’d gotten bored or something and tried to leave, but the room he chose had gotten moved as well. If Potter had been dropped off in some unfamiliar part of the Manor, there’d be no way he could get back. Potter had never been in this part of the Manor as far as Draco knew, and it was doubtful he even knew his cardinal directions, being from suburbia and all.
“Stop feeling sorry for yourself, darling,” she’d drawl, sprawled like a cat over the nearest flat surface, picking at her fingernails. “You might be a bit of a shit, but Merlin knows Potter is, too. And if he’s not going to forgive you for being a coward he’s not going to forgive you for anything else, like your filthy shower fantasies,”
Harry could hear the smirk and drawl creep into Malfoy’s voice. His fists clenched almost involuntarily.
“They’re re-inspecting former Death Ester residences. If there’s any hint of Dark magic, they’ll condemn us.” He set his cup down. “And we all know what they want to find, they’ll find,”
She was forced to turn to her nails. “So you haven’t been paying any attention to the papers in the past two years at all?”
“Hello, er- again. It’s me. My therapist is making me do this and all that. I just got off the phone with one of my mates from school. It’s Carrot’s girlfriend, Perdita. No, that’s not her real name. Yes, I’ve read Shakespeare. There’s not a lot to do in an empty house, you know?”
Malfoy rolled his wrists over and snapped his fingers. When he pressed down on a few keys, playing a few chords and little melodies, no sound came out. But clearly Malfoy could hear something, because he frowned and peered under the lid. He played a note a few times gingerly, until something seemed to be fitting together better now and his frown turned to an expression of proud satisfaction. Then he snapped again, presumably allowing Harry to hear the piano’s music again.
“Bet you a pretty penny I could tell you, love!” Campbell called. So they were married, or as good as.
“It’s not a big deal, really,” Draco said. It wasn’t like this was the first time he’d been yelled at, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. “You didn’t hurt my poor little spoiled rich boy feelings,”
Draco nodded as he walked out the door. He made his way through the bookstore. As he was leaving, a tall dark-skinned man with wire-framed glasses and an utter mop of black hair approached the door. He set down an oddly-shaped brown paper package at the door before giving it a resounding couple of knocks. Draco didn’t get a good look at him, but he seemed exceedingly fit under the green jumper.
“Hey, Angie,” he said. He sounded too defeated. “Hey, Angie,” he tried again. “And others. Um. Sorry I haven’t been around for the past few days, I– stuff happened and I had to stay at a friend’s house. Well, I say ‘friend,’ but I’m not really sure…”
“Scheherazade,” Malfoy said, picking up the now-empty folder and floating it over to Harry. “The piece is an arrangement of Scheherazade. I learned it for my summer recital before fifth year.”
A week of this went by with no results. Draco sat at his card table, staring at the collage wall. The list Pansy and Blaise had made was still intact: 1. , 2. , 3. , 4. Seduction, and 5. Seduction. Draco had made a list of his own next to it.
She gave him a hug. “Chicken parm. And do take your shoes off before coming in. Aina just vacuumed,”
“A Sneewitchen Mirror,” Draco repeated. A dark shape flitted at the end of the hallway. Draco let himself sink into Potter a little more. “If you look at it too closely, it shows you an image of the most beautiful person in the world. It was originally made in Germany for the beautiful Queen Grimhilde, and when one day it showed her the image of her daughter, she hired a mercenary. That night, her daughter was stabbed to death in a forest,”
Draco nodded. “Fine, fine!” His voice sounded too high. “I just used to know someone by that name. Probably not the same person, though,” He laughed forcefully.
“I’m staging a protest. He doesn’t want to talk to me, so I’m going to mildly inconvenience him until he’s forced to.”
“Draco,” He said, continuing to stand in the entryway. Campbell pushed him further into the flat. It seemed to have a similar layout to his. The furniture was all blandly mid-century, but prints of various sizes hung about the walls. He assumed Elise had painted them.
This was a rather awkward thing to say, as Draco was further ahead on the staircase and staircases aren’t known for their mobility. Draco, at first, tried to circle around his mother. Then he realized the futility and simply descended the staircase the rest of the way, letting his mother lead after that.
They were standing so Harry could see the profile of both parties. He could see the family resemblance most, now: Narcissa’s balletic posture had clearly raised Malfoy, and their aquiline noses and browbones were twins. She said something and leaned closer, and he blushed fiercely. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if Malfoy’s hair had turned a deep pink as well.
“A girl had to stay at his house, but he was too polite to kick her out, so the house made it so she couldn’t stay by hiding all the bedrooms.”
What a little shit. He thought, taking in the tear-stained cheeks and mussed hair. I’m being a little shit.
“Miss Lovegood sent a parcel by owl to you this morning,” she said. “I presume it’s important, so I shall leave you and my son to open it.” She handed Potter a cardboard box, wrapped with quidditch-themed wrapping paper.
“Potter’s here. You know him. He’ll hex first, ask questions later. I can’t-” Draco swallowed. He could hear his heartbeat pumping through the blood vessels in his ears. “You have to move me,”
They could never prove the muggles (it had been a whole mob of Death Eaters at the time), he didn’t kill Dumbledore, but Harry Potter? The Wizengamot would not be lenient if Harry Potter was killed. And worst of all, there would be no Harry Potter to testify for him.
A cold strike of fear ran through his heart. Lucius. Where was Lucius? Draco hadn’t been keeping tabs, recently. It had been three weeks since he had last stopped in the Manor, and one more since he had talked to his, as much as he hated to say it, father. He could have gone into one of his fits again, thinking it was during the war. Mother couldn’t always calm him down, convince him to go to sleep. And suddenly Draco knew it. Lucius had gotten out. He had contacted some old Death Eater pal and paid him off somehow. They were after Potter and that’s why he was late. Merlin, Potter would never forgive him. He’d have to leave again, or start over again somewhere else.
“And I loved to see it in him. But all that’s probably over now. I’ve gone and messed everything up, I think. Not what I did, okay, maybe what I did, but I don’t understand why he did what he did, and instead of talking about it, I ran away. Instead of matching his energy in the moment, I should have taken time to think clearly and stayed,” That’s something he and Angie had talked about, back when they still did in-person sessions together. Deescalation. Calming techniques. “Except I didn’t,” He sighed. “So fat lot of good knowing that does me now.” Bitterness was okay. It was okay to be bitter and regretful and sad. As long as it didn’t prevent him from doing the best thing, in the end.
That’s when Draco knew he was losing. He drew away, though every irrational bone in his body (he had about 200 of them) begged him not to.
He realized Malfoy was flipping through jumper colors. He sure did have a lot of jumpers, it seemed.
“You’re about four stone too heavy for that, girl,” he said, but let her crush his fragile knees with her paws anyway.
Draco could read the shock in the way Potter’s shoulders tensed slightly, the way his ear lifted, the way he took in a sharp breath. Draco couldn’t blame him; he’d almost forgotten their reasons for being here himself. But Potter, perfect Potter, allowed none of it to show in his face, and he let out the breath slowly and inconspicuously.
Harry checked the time. A little past eleven. They would still be able to catch Malfoy before lunch if they put the pizza in at eleven-fifteen.
George waved a hand in front of his face dismissively. “That doesn’t count. I couldn’t remember. Still can’t. Remembered it just this morning but it seems to have slipped my mind again.” he looked suddenly distraught. “I’m becoming an old man,”
At lunch it became quite clear that Draco had reached his limit on sympathy for the month, and had left feeling altogether better about the whole Potter situation. Surely, he could stay out of his way, if it even was the same Potter from school. Potter, who had saved the wizarding world and all that. With any luck, it would be a Potter whose parents were very much alive and had just celebrated their anniversary.
“I just want to talk to him, you know? First I’ll tell him I’m sorry, then I’ll demand an apology. I’ll be like hey, Posh Spice, sorry, but you gotta pull your own weight, too. Maybe some of it’s my fault, but certainly not all of it. I was doing what I thought was best, what I thought we wanted, but I might have read things wrong. I do know that you certainly reacted wrong, and I do know that I can’t control you. Woah, when did this get so direct? Sorry guys, that was probably intense,” he said, laughing a little at himself. “What can I say? I’ve found a passion for something other than my dog and my vegetables.
If it wasn’t his old school-mates, then, just who was Harry Potter dating, or shagging, or whatever straight men do?
Draco learned years later that when the old man had said ‘Drasha’ it was as a nickname for ‘Draco.’ All throughout childhood, he’d just thought it was a Russian swear word.
“I’m so sorry about her,” He said, pulling a treat from his pocket and crouching down. “She does this homeless attention seeking act.” The dog bounded into Potter’s arms. “Dunno why, she gets more’n enough attention at home.”
Malfoy nodded to it, and he could have sworn the swan gave Harry a reassuring glance before it dissipated.
Hermione shook her head. “I actually kind of expected this,” she said, wiping her eyes. “God, I wish I wouldn’t get this worked up. Anyway, let’s have some pizza now, yeah?”
Kreacher stared up at a picture he’d stuck to the ceiling. There was Regulus in it, and Sirius, as children. As the photo moved, the young Sirius pinched Regulus in the arm and Regulus started and wound up to punch his brother. They were both smiling.
She patted the stool. It was the intense sort of green that gave you a headache if you looked at it too closely. “Take a seat. And didn’t he say you wouldn’t even have to talk to him? Just send an owl to the Wizengamot and tell them to stall the enforcement of the re-inspection bill. You won’t even have to see Draco. Here, I’ll help you write it,”
Elise gave her a small grin. “Right.” She started. “So Victor’s first wife was the love of his life, and he met his current wife at her funeral. A great conversation starter, you know. How’d you meet your wife? Well, it was all thanks to my other wife, really. Just kidding,” Elise added sheepishly, before continuing:
But isn’t this what Draco had wanted? After all, he hadn’t dissuaded his mother from her mistaken belief in their relationship. It wouldn’t have been difficult to explain the real situation, but Draco had gone along with it. And here they were.
Draco wandered into the main room and sat at the squat sofa. He had concealed his wand in a sort of disillusioned wrist holster. He would have to think of a new solution for the summer months, but for April it was easy to slip the holster up his sleeve. Maybe if he could find any wizards or witches in this town, they could share their wand-hiding strategies.
"Of course I do. What they did to you was unfair and shouldn't change how you see yourself. Until you decide to give it away then you, Harry Potter, are still a virgin." As he spoke he watched a flush of crimson bleed across the other's cheekbones. Harry bit into his lower lip yet again and Draco failed to resist the urge, using hte pad of his thumb to pull the lip free and traced across it gently. His heart pounded in response to what he saw pooling in the depths of Harry's eyes, something that looked far too hot to be anything but molten desire. Harry wanted him, if only in that moment, and that knowledge was enough to bring his errection to full mast. Humiliated, the blond sent up a silent prayer that Harry wouldn't notice. A prayer that woud fall upon deaf ears.
With little hesitation Harry slipped his fingers past the waist bands of Draco's pajama bottoms and his snug boxers, the silken materials of both giving way easily. Draco gasped aloud with a low hiss as long, warm fingers wrapped firmly around the heated girth and pumped experimentally, spreading beads of dewy precome from tip to shaft in short moves as the fabric restrained him. Clearly frustrated Harry attempted to wriggle himself closer while trying to stroke the hard cock leaking into his palm. With a soft chuckle Draco slipped the offending frabric over his length, letting out another low moan as the cool air brushed over the wettened tip. Wide eyed, Harry knelt closer, his chest nearly flattened against the sheets as his warm breath ghosted across the exposed flesh, his hand attempting to move over the shaft in the same way he would manipulate his own, twisting his wrist at the tip to palm the head. Draco allowed himself to get lost for a moment in the sensation of being Harry's first; his first kiss, his first pure touch, his first lover, or at least he hoped such would come next. But first, he reasoned, he needed to ask the important questions before things went too far, to avoid regret.
"Shh...easy baby, there's no need to rush. I'm not ready for this to be over just yet. When you come I want you wrapped around my cock. You're going to look so pretty taking me deep inside of you, Harry. Merlin, I've imagined this so many times. I know how sexy you'll sound begging me for more, and I'm so excited at the thought. You make me so fucking hot, Harry. Those beautiful lips, the way you're blushing for me, the way you're already writhing beneath me. Fuck, you're so pretty. And I'm going to make that pretty mouth beg for my cock. C'mon baby...beg for me..." As he spoke he moved his finger in an agonizingly slow motion, loosening Harry gently as he let his warm breath ghost over the other's needy member. To his pleasure, Harry keened.
"Oh, Merlin, Harry, no. No no no. My sweet, sweet Harry. No way in hell could you ruin this. Nothing is going to keep me away from you now that we've come this far. I am so very sorry those people hurt you. I want to make them suffer for every moment of pain they put you through, I want to watch the light leave their eyes, but far more than that I want to stay right here, just as we are right now, and show you how wrong you are. You are not tainted, you are not filthy or disgusting or otherwise unclean. You are so fucking beautiful, galaxies could live in your eyes and never compete with the way your smile lights up the room around you. I don't care about the things those pieces of filth made you do, I don't see you any differently than I did before. You're still Harry Potter, the boy who saved my life, and everyone elses, too many times to count, even though I was the biggest brat in the universe. You're still my friend." Draco's words flowed like a river, like a floodgate had been opened, and as he spoke Harry was shaking his head frantically before pulling back to eye him, teeth worrying that lovely lip yet again.
"Do you want to fuck me, Draco?" Draco felt as though his heart had lodged itself into his threat as Harry brazenly ghosted the tips of his fingers over the bulge tenting his silky pajama pants through his boxers. Slowly, he answered with calculated words.
"Harry, can you look at me for a moment, please? I need to see if your pupils are dialated, you hit your head rather hard and I'm worried that you might have a concussion." At Harry's silence and stiffening Draco sighed and tried a different approach. "Harry, sweethear, if you don't want to work with me I'll need to take you to Pomfrey instead." At this green eyes rose slowly to meet his, cheeks streaked with tear tracks and lips somewhat swollen. Draco's heart gave an involuntary squeeze at the sight. Harry looked far too lovely when he cried, far too beautiful, and Draco felt guilty at the rising desire to kiss those perfectly plump lips.
Draco's palms held his hips in place as he licked a warm, wet stripe along the underside of Harry's long, thick cock from base to tip before focusing on his full, heavy balls for a few moments. Harry moaned without reservation as the softness coated his sensitive area in wet before gently sucking them into his mouth and feeling their weight against his tongue one at a time. After a momentary pause to flutter feather touch kisses against the warmth of his shaft Harry felt those soft lips wrap beautifully around the weeping head before Draco sheathed his teeth and swallowed down as much of the significant length and girth as he could take in one swift motion. Harry cried out in euphoria as he threw his head back into the pillows, wanting so badly to watch himself disappear into the blond's throat but failing as blissed out tears began to well in emerald eyes. Draco hollowed his cheeks and began to bob his head with a gentle suction, taking more and more with each pass until finally his pale nose pressed into the shaven surface of Harry's groin, pleasantly surprised about the absense of hair he'd noted as he'd begun his exploration. Harry moaned at the feeling of Draco swallowing him down, the tight wetness squeezing around him deliciously. Harry was drowning in the sensations, it was everything he'd ever dreamed it could be and so much more, his mind foggy and warm as he felt Draco press a long, lube slickened finger against his entrance. With overwhelming softness Draco pressed the digit into the tightness, spreading slick over every crevice as he twisted his wrist with a flick. Harry moaned low in his throat as warmth coiled in his stomach tightly. Noticing the growing tension Draco moved off of Harry's cock with a wet pop, his finger slowing to a near halt as he continued to work open the tightness he hoped to soon sink into. Harry whined wantonly at the loss, coaxing a soft chuckle from his blond lover.
"Harry, I know you probably won't want to talk about this, but I really need you to help me to understand what happened to you tonight. What would have happened if I hadn't realized something was wrong? You put a silencing charm around your curtains, if I hadn't felt the wall vibrating you could have really done some serious damage. Please, please just talk to me, I can't help if you don't trust me." Harry's eeys went wide with fear, his head shaking in panic. This wasn't about the war, or Voldemort at all, Draco suspected. they had gone through all of that together, and had talked together about it at length a few times before, and Harry wouldn't have felt so petrifed to discuss it again. It had to have come before the war, if it couldn't have been during, and that could only leave on option. Draco had heard the rumors, same as the rest of the school, but he'd never been one to take rumors at face value since he knew how much more quickly lies spread as opposed to facts. However, Draco mused, it seemed that for once the rumors had been accurate. His heart ached at the image of a tiny Harry being beaten, just as his father had beaten him.
"Alright, whatever you say, Dr. Draco. What should we do to pass the time? Do you want to play a game? Ron has a set for Wizard's Chess, if you'd like." A bubble of laughter threatened at the blond's lips. Such an innocent suggestion, it made Draco smile. Slowly, he shook his head and levelled the other with a serious yet gentle gaze. He needed to know why Harry had nearly bashed his own brains in against a wall at nearly four in the morning. Cautiously, he toed into the subject.
For several moments they stayed like that; Harry in Draco's lap, straddling his thighs and resting his head against the other's chest in a shaking, sobbing mess as Draco hummed softly into Harry's hair. If anyone else in the room had come to check on him Harry hadn't noticed, keeping his bright green eyes seemingly glued shut as he allowed his once-enemy-turned-friend to comfort him. Everything about Draco seemed to calm him, from the way he smelled to the way his body pressed into Harry's to the way his heart beat against Harry's chest and the low, unfamilar tune he hummed softly with his face pressed into Harry's dark tresses. Slowly, the sobbing quieted and the shaking melted into comfortable stillness. Hesitantly, the blond spoke.
Harry sobbed loudly as the memories shattered his heart. He hated thinking about those nights, the way they had felt so disgusting and vicious inside of him, the way they never failed to leave him feeling broken and ugly and used. He shook his head violently, pouding it against the cool stone of the wall behind him, desperate to chase away the unbarable images until finally he began to see stars, the scent of copper twinging his nose. Suddenly, soft hands gripped his cheeks, holding his head in place. He stopped struggling as grey eyes, wide with concern, levelled him. Long, slender fingers rubbed comforting patterns along the sides of his face.
Draco pressed gently against Harry's muscular chest until the latter got the hint and allowed himself to fall onto his back in the soft cotton sheets, legs still parted to allow the blond ease of access. Draco kissed a path down Harry's body, slowly worshipping the open and inviting lover beneath him. He began by pressing soft kisses to each closed eyelid, hands trailing over Harry's skin with feather light touches to delight in the goosebumps that sprang up in his wake. He brushed lower to the corners of soft lips, then down over the firm line of his jaw with a smile as he noted the soft gasp he'd earned. His fingertips played at the waist line of Harry's cotton bottoms, the blue fabric soft and pliant, and rained heated kisses over the beautifully flawless skin of his throat, soft nips marring that perfect space with light blotches of color as Harry's pulse quickened, skin warming even further beneath Draco's soft lips. As the blond swirled his wet tongue over the tiny bud of Harry's left nipple he delighted in the soft sqeek of pleasure that sounded from Harry's lips, feeling long fingers lacing into the strands of his silky blond hair, even pulling slightly in his lusty excitement. After proper attention had been shared between each dusky pink peak he dipped his head lower still, placing sweet kisses over each rib and every dip and rise of Harry's toned and prominant abdominals while his hands played along the trembling muscles of the brunet's strong thighs, never coming quite close enough to the thick, achingly hard shaft pressing agianst the blue cloth barrier. To his pleasure the body beneath his writhed and bucked, whimpers and pleas filling the air around them in a symphony.
Carefully he moved his fingers in and out of the tight warmth of Harry's center, eyes hungrily watching the sight in awe. Never in his life had he dared to truly HOPE for this moment, but somehow, despite the horrible and selfish things he'd said and one in the past he'd been lucky enough to catch the eye of the most beautiful and kind hearted person he'd ever met. Harry was the most selfless person alive, having risked himself time and time again to save others, Draco included, and here he was, the Savior of the Wizarding World, moaning sweetly just for him. It was so close to intoxicating, being in the one place he'd always dreamed of being, and the blond felt his brain swimming in a thick haze of pure bliss as he ran his tongue tentatively along the muscle wrapped so snuggly around his fingers.
"Oh, Harry, no, of course not! Who you are now has nothing to do with what they did to you then, being gay isn't a side effect of trauma it's a biological identity no different from hair or eye color. And just because you've discovered you're sexuality now doesn't change how you felt in the moment. You have nothing to be ashamed of, you're not sick and you're absolutely not a freak. Being gay is just one more trait that makes you who you are, you should never be afraid of you are. My God, Harry, how can you be so blind to how amazing you are? Honestly, it would be more likely for someone who sustained the trauma you have to reject your sexuality completely and yet you not only accept that you're gay but also that you still have sexual urges, you really are the strongest person I've ever known. Harry, you are so fucking brilliant." As he finished Harry pulled away yet again, moss green eyes glowing with curiosity that left Draco's heart on the verge of exploding. He truly was so pretty when he cried.
"Do you want to kiss me, Draco?" The words seemed to tumble out, Harry's cheeks flushing pink and hand moving to cover those tear swollen lips, eyes wide as though he couldn't believe he'd actually said the words aloud. Slowly, tentatively, Draco wrapped his fingers around the slender wrist and lowered Harry's fingers. With a gentle nod the blond leaned forward to capture the Savior's lips with his own. Instantly, Harry leaned into the touch and a soft moan left Draco's throat unbidden.
"Please, Draco, please give me more." It was a breathy, needy sound that had the blond's heart thrumming viciously fast. Those sweet lips parted ever so slightly, bright eyes wet and glowing with desire, lean and muscular form trembling in anticipation, it all painted the perfect picture and as Draco gently eased a second lube drenched finger past the slowly relaxing ring of muscle he was rewarded with a gorgeous moan and warm fingers tugging encouragingly at pale hair.
"Please...Draco...please touch me...I need you to touch me." Harry pulled at the blond strands and felt his hips straining for contact, begging for more. He blushed crimson as Draco chuckled and continued his slow and steady assault, lips and teeth bathing his hip bones in affection as his pale blue pajama bottoms were slipped down over his quivering thighs. He winced as his hardened cock sprang free, having not worn boxers of his own, the cold air sticking to the dewy tip as his precome dribbled down the heated length. He felt so needy, he just wanted more, he just NEEDED more. Finally, Draco pressed his lips against the side of his throbbing member and Harry failed to bite back his pleasured moan.
"It started the summer before second year. Uncle Vernon had always used me as a punching bag and had always encouraged Dudley to do the same, he'd said it was to teach Dudley how to fight. That night, though, he wanted to teach Dudley how to do something else. He tied me to the bed on my stomach and tore off my pajama pants and my boxers. He used my body to teach Dudley how to have sex. That first night Dudley couldn't do it after Uncle Vernon took his turn so he waited a couple weeks and then they tried again. They did this to me over every single summer until I got too strong to hold down. I'm disgusting and tainted, Draco. I'm filthy and used and damaged. And now that you know the worst of what they did to me you'll never want to come near me again. I've ruined our friendship. I'm so sorry, Draco. I'm so sorry." Draco sat frozen as Harry sobbed into his bare chest, hands clutching the blond's shoulders to keep himself upright. Instinctively Draco's arms tightened around the trembling body in his lap, tucking the dark hair beneath his chin and locking his fingers into the thick, soft tresses. He rocked the two of them back and forth, realizing as the tears hit the back of his hand that he was crying himself.
"Yes. I may not have been able to choose who owned my virginity, but my first kiss was still mine to give and there was no one else I wanted to have it but you. I hope you don't mind. You've listened to every vile word I had to say tonight and I know it can't have been easy for you to hear what they stole from me, I am so sorry to put you through that, Draco, but I honestly can't think of anyone else who would have been strong enough to shoulder the burden of that knowledge. Thank you for being the one to take care of me tonight." Draco felt a knot tighten nervously in his gut as his next words bubbled on his tongue. He couldn't say how they would be recieved, but they needed to be said.
"Silly boy, worried over a little concussion when you've survived the killing curse TWICE? Of course you'll be okay, I wouldn't let anything happen to you. I do need for you to stay awake with me for a while, though, I can't really tell if you're concussed or not and if you don't want to go to Pomfrey I won't make you but you do need to be monitored until I feel confident that you're not going to slip into a coma. Can you do that for me, Harry?" He kept his tone light and easy and as he spoke his temporary patient nodded, soft smile never wavering. He looked so sexy like this, Draco thought, so sleepy and tear stained and innocent. Draco both loved and hated the way he wanted to have Harry writhing beneath him right then and there.
The psychological abuse was even worse, leaving far more lasting effects than the bruises and breaks ever had. Some nights he could even hear Petunia's shrill, arrogant voice echoing through his nightmares with the all too familiar insults, telling him how he was worthless, how he would never amount to anything, her voice ripping him from a dead sleep the same way she had when he'd been forced to live in the cupboard beneath their staircase. On nights like those he didn't sleep again, instead choosing to go for a walk or to do some sort of renovation towards fixing up Grimauld Place now that it was his. The nightmares came often enough that the house had almost begun to look like a home when he'd returned to Hogwarts for what had been dubbed their "Eighth Year" along side Hermione, Ron, Draco, and many others.
For a moment neither dared to move, worried the other would change their mind and bolt if the mood shifted too quickly. Slowly, however, Draco traced his tongue over the plump expanse of Harry's bitten bottom lip, revelling in the softness, and with a sigh they parted to grant him access. Draco's tongue explored the honeyed interior of Harry's mouth with a slow, raw passion that the other returned with equal ferver, velvet softness submitting to one another in a primally charged dance. As they parted for air Draco's hands had moved to cradle Harry's face, thumbs delicately tracing tear tracked cheekbones as their foreheads pressed into one another, warm breath mingling in passionate gasps of soft pleasure. Draco was the first to speak, testing the waters with slow, precise words.
With a jolt and a sob Harry Potter woke, immediately rising and resting himself against the cool of the wall. As the tears continued to slip over his quickly reddening cheeks Harry cast a quick silencing charm over the curtains of his four post bed and hugged his knees to his chest, resting against the hard surface of his kneecaps. He hated nights like these, when the nightmares were rather memories, and always had trouble falling back into sleep once he'd woken. He was drenched in a layer of icy sweat, heart pounding in a vicious rhythm against his ribcage and dampened brunet locks clinging to his forehead. He fought against the urge to so much as blink, seeing the ugly, blotchy faces of his uncle and cousin as though branded into the backs of his eyelids. With a tremble his sobs came harder and heavier.
He opened the door of Campbell and Elise’s spare bedroom. He had not been surprised when they had retired into the same room at around 9:30 pm.
Weasley’s face disappeared into the green flames for a few seconds. The flames flickered and blurred, then Granger’s face appeared.
‘Potter, I have a terribly important issue only you can help me with. You see, now that the Wizengamot thinks you’ve gone and died–’
Harry’s gaze was drawn subconsciously upward to the owner of those hands, who returned his gaze. Harry looked away quickly, not wanting to be caught staring.
Victor leaned against the thirty-year-old cash register. “So a family is a premature grandfather and a mutt?”
Okay, that one wasn’t in any paper or magazine Draco saw. But it might as well have been. The people’s savior had become the people’s resident bigfoot.
Harry nodded. “Thought as much. And I’m stuck here so the ministry doesn’t paint you as a dangerous criminal?”
He could hold it again, for appearance’s sake, surely. And quite unconsciously, his hand snaked back into Potter’s.
Which meant that Draco really, really hoped he’d been imagining that Potter’s was substantially larger than his. It had to have been the dark. Maybe Potter had accidentally conjured some incorporeal patronus wisps along with his jackal. Yeah. That would make sense.
“Hello?” Draco tried. She dressed like a factory worker from the 1940s and fit the physical description, besides being around sixty years old and uncommonly short. Her brown hair was pulled into a loose ponytail at the back of her neck.
Black was classic, Draco supposed. Or Snape-like. Black also wasn’t a remarkable match to the emerald green of Potter’s robes.
He’d annotated something in orange across several of the documents. It seemed important. It had to have been, if Draco had taken the time to annotate it. But he couldn’t remember what it was. He floated all the orange-marked documents up to where he could sort through them. It was mostly old journal entries, but there were a few technical documents about leasing of some magical buildings post-Statute of Secrecy.
A few pairs of robes, thankfully, not muggle clothes, were laid out on a table in the center of the room. None of them would have been Draco’s first pick, but they would have to do. He sighed and wondered if Potter had any muscle-relaxing potions.
“I’m not sure what to say to that, Malfoy,” Potter said, turning back around to check the soup. “Soup’s done.”
Harry had to fight the urge to slam open the bathroom door and deliver a stinging hex to Malfoy’s nethers so potent the git couldn’t sit down for weeks.
He threw floo powder in the fireplace, then checked the clock. It was only 4, so still office hours.
“Alexandre!” Malfoy said, then began speaking in rapid French. The man (presumably Alexandre) greeted him with a kiss on both cheeks and spoke to him in kind.
He a couple of his pillows to the ground, transfiguring one into a blanket. With any luck, it would last the night.
Harry could have cursed if he hadn’t been so distracted watching the white curve of Draco’s throat bob as he swallowed hard.
He left George’s Electronic Reparations with a fixed radio, a list with the tuning specifications for George’s favorite stations, and a potential friend.
“No! No, no. Please don’t. It’s probably best if… if it is who I’m thinking of, he doesn’t know I’m here. We aren’t…” He flashed a weak smile. “On the best of terms. Oh, look at that!” He ran several metres to his storefront. “I’m here. Er, goodbye. Thank you,”
Then Malfoy’s leg moved. Harry heard the lid above him shift, and the light was back. Harry looked through his peephole to watch Malfoy sit at the bench of the grand piano in the center of the room. It’s blocked by the piano, but Malfoy’s looking at something on the key-cover. He’s inspecting something thoroughly, which was strange because Harry couldn’t remember sheet music or anything to note resting on the piano.
“Don’t distract me, boy. It is most certainly not. It’s the little blond-headed kid’s name. What are you doing with his old book?”
“I’m Elise. Nice to meet you,” She stuck out a hand, then retracted it when she realized it was covered in paint.
“It’ll be the first they go after. Other than that, I dunno. Do you want me to connect you to Hermione?” Weasley asked.
He turned into the Mum’s bookstore, vibrant and orange as always. Stella, of course, stayed outside. Once in, he noticed a stack of books perched precariously on an overstuffed armchair. The top one was a trashy gay porn novel (Harry still didn’t know why Campbell stocked those things). The second one was clearly used. Nearly half the pages had been dog-eared at some point and “D. Malfoy” was written on the bottom of it in sharpie.
“I know that’s probably not accurate in any way, but I can’t help feeling like that’s the truth. Not when I spent every day of my life at school knowing that when Malfoy was frustrated, he’d take it out on me, or on my friends. I’m just used to being his emotional outlet. But I suppose he’s used to being mine, too, so we’ve probably fucked each other up about equally.” Harry laughed. Then he sighed. “Such is life. And I’ll end this broadcast here. Goodnight, Angie.”
This was said in Malfoy’s normal voice, the one he used when talking to Pansy or Blaise at school, not the one used for tormenting Harry or anyone else.
Simple and sweet arabica, but with honey. Most people preferred sugar, but Draco liked the dissonance. It gave him a focus in tasting.
“I’m so sorry, I don’t know how that got mixed up in here. It was a custom order for a gentleman a few years ago, but he didn’t like it. An apprentice must have put them on the show rack by mistake,”
“Good. I like it when I’m right.” Harry said. The piano looked dustier than it had yesterday. A thought occurred to him. “Is shit like what it did to me the reason why they want to take the Manor away?”
The man snorted and turned it over in his hands. He was the sole proprietor and employee of George’s Electronic Reparations, a decidedly smart-looking front room of a home near the end of the row.
Harry wished this, in all its strangeness, had been the strangest day of his life. It would certainly be convincing.
She and Elise rushed out the door before Harry had the chance to narrow his eyes and declare he smelled a rat. He sighed, gave the dishes a quick scourgify, then flicked his wrist to send them to the correct cabinets.
Harry didn’t mind weeding all that much. It was nice work, easy to see your progress and quite satisfying to do, pulling the tall and tough pigweeds by the roots and easily slipping the ragweed out of its place.
He rustled through the cabinets to find the proper coffee strain and began preparing it. “Just dropping in?”
“His current wife’s name is Georgia. So Georgia used to do flowers for funerals, like the arrangements for the coffins. And he met her there, could barely see through all the tears and such and thought she was just a nice, kind, older lady. So he asked her for her business card so he could buy more flowers from her in the future.
Draco ducked off the street and apparated into his flat. He looked at the hand Potter had taken. If he thought about it, Draco could feel Potter’s strong grip hoisting him upright. His hands had been dirty and slightly damp. Rough and calloused, too. The kind of hands used to manual labor. But warm and strong, definitely. A strong grip. A strong grip to hoist him upright.
He noticed Potter apparated across the street. How inventive. Draco smirked and gave a little wave. He cast a tempus charm; it was past four. That was enough protesting for today.
‘That’s good, Draco! A little poke at the Saviour will get him emotionally invested. A spot of genius,’
“I’m still living in my house,” Potter was quoted as saying. The writer speculated this was simply a front, and our beloved Savior’s home had been ransacked by vicious death eaters. Draco had to scoff at that; all the ex-death eaters were either laying low out of the country or in Azkaban. With the exception of him, of course. And his father, who was confined to house arrest more or less indefinitely.
He’s mute, immobile, and trapped in the smallest possible space. His thighs and calves were cramping, and Harry’s pretty sure he’s lost all feeling in his left arm. It’s too small. There’s not enough space. It’s warm, too warm. Harry’s breath is only making it warmer, but he can’t stop himself from breathing faster and shallower. There’s a hitch in his breath and he felt something cool and wet drip down his cheeks. He’s crying, Harry realized. Harry was crying.
The number of pillows under Draco’s head seemed to have multiplied overnight. It had to be Potter’s doing. How he had managed to put them under Draco’s body was beyond him, but the implication that Potter looked over him at night was simultaneously made him smile a bit and want to change his name, hightail it to rural France and never talk to another human being again.
They shared a look. It was a good look, though. One that wasn’t full of pity, but something like pride.
“Look, I don’t know why he suddenly showed up here. Maybe he was just passing through and needed a pick me up. Who knows…” Draco shrugged nonchalantly and moved towards the register as the bell above the café door rang. Customers were already starting to come in and Draco knew the day was going to be long.
I'm sorry I haven't posted in a while. I started college up for the first time in years and I started a new job so I'm getting into the hang of everything. Nice comments and kudos take away my stress though if you want to help ease the mind of this crazy woman.
With eyes barely open, Draco began moving towards the door in an almost dreamlike state. Ugh why did he get this drunk.
“Pansy may have scared off some poor souls.” Blaise laughed and looked at her in appreciation. Pansy merely smirked at the praise. After making room on the table, Millie helped Draco set the tray down and began to pass everyone their drinks.
“I can’t believe how casual you are being about this.” Millie said, already moving to the machines to start the order Draco was taking from the tired customer in front them. This guy must have been out all night too by the looks of him.
“Well, I don’t know if you are aware of this Millie, but we sell this thing. It’s called coffee. Loads of people enjoy it daily.” His sarcastic remark earned him a slap to the arm with her tea towel, “Ow that hurt!” He pulled his arm to himself and pushed his sleeve up to see the welt on his arm turning red.
Ah. So that’s how he knew him. Draco started to feel shame creep into his once okay mood. He decided to cut the conversation short and drew his hand back to grab at the tray once more. Tray in hand, he smiled politely and turned to venture into the crowd.
“It’s just Potter.” He went on to take the customer’s order in front of him but didn’t miss Millie’s whispered reply to herself.
“Good one Potter.” The bell chimed again as more people made their way inside. Draco glanced up at them and made a move to go back towards the register.
“We gotta get outside guys! It’ll be here in 3 minutes.” Millie presented her phone to the group, showcasing that the uber was on its way. Greg wrapped his arm around her shoulder and began staggering with her to the door.
“Yes dear, right after we have a shot with Potter!” At this Blaise Greg and Millie all cheered and moved in on the two of them, ushering everyone towards the bar. Flagging the bartender down, they ordered six double shots of tequila and waited as the bartender fetched their lemons to go along with their alcohol.
Draco moved to grab the second tray, grateful that his job made the task of carrying unstable bottles of liquid an easy one. Just as he reached out to grasp the tray, someone took his hand in theirs. Draco quickly glanced up to see a man at the bar that looked terribly familiar.
He found them tucked behind a leather backpack he has used once to travel to the countryside with Blaise Pansy and Millie years ago.  Sitting down on the bed, he pulled them both on and then went about tightening the laces. Pansy walked back in just as he was finishing.
“Blaise? What the hell are you doing here?” Draco rubbed his eyes and slowly sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. “What time is it?”
“You’re just forgetting how much fun we had. It has been awhile. I’ll remind you…” Dylan wrapped his hands into Draco’s hair and pulled Draco towards his lips. Stunned by the sudden pulling, Draco briefly allowed himself to be pulled forward before becoming rigid and attempting to push himself away. Just as sudden as Dylan began, his hand fell limp from Draco’s hair, and the other fell from his shoulder. Unknowingly, Draco had closed his eyes and took the reprieve to squint them open. Dylan stood there with a look of utter confusion etched across his face. Both of his arms dangled numbly at his sides.
Despite Draco’s wishes, he was the last to finally succumb to sleep, and even that didn’t last long. Instead, he spent most of the night tossing and turning, wondering where he went wrong, why he wasn’t enough, and what he could have done different. He slept on and off until Blaise sauntered in around noon, throwing himself upon Draco’s bed.
Draco had never felt more free. No. That wasn’t right. He had never felt more relieved. No, that wasn’t it either… Happy? No. Lonely? Yes. Betrayed? Yup. Lost? You bet. Maybe not as lost as he was right after the War, but he thought he had finally found a place. Admittedly not always a great place, but a place, nonetheless.
Draco softly laughed to himself and then felt tears beginning to fill his eyes. He covered them with both of his hands and tried to slow his breathing down. He felt arms surround him, and from the smell of their floral perfume, he immediately recognized it as Pansy. He felt another hand rubbing his back as he began crying into her shoulder.
He finally located his wand wedged between his pillow and headboard. Groaning in success, he flopped over to his back and flicked his wand towards his door. The door slowly opened, and a hangover potion sluggishly floated towards Draco’s outstretched hand. The potion would have flown straight to his hand if Draco could muster the energy to concentrate, but he couldn’t be bothered. A century later, Draco pulled the cork from the vial and shot back this disgusting concoction. He waited with a clenched jaw and bated breath as he waited to feel relief.
Many drinks later found Draco and his friends on the dance floor. The music was great tonight and despite Draco and Greg’s vehemence earlier in the evening about dancing, they found themselves lost to the music with the rest of crowd. Silva’s “Genghis Kahn” was blaring, and Draco, Millie, and Greg were drunkenly screaming out the words to each other while moving to the beat. Pansy and Blaise were wrapped around each other beside them, having fun, but clearly in their own world.
Millie and Pansy both came back with two trays covered in shots for them to drink. When Draco tried to argue that it was overkill, Blaise simply tipped one to his lips and refused to stop until Draco gave in. Pansy decreed they were well off after five shots apiece and corralled everyone to the front door to make their way to Smithereens.
“Oh man, did you try one of those new blue drinks at the bar? I heard it was laced with something. Don’t worry though. I’m sure it will wear off soon. Draco and I really do have to go now. Nice meeting you Big Bird.” Before Draco could fully put together what had happened, Potter’s fingers were laced with his, pulling him through the crowd.
. He had gotten taller, a lot taller. Draco was going to have to look up a bit once he came fully up to the counter. His hair, while still messy, worked now tousled on the top of his head, curling slightly around his ears. He still had glasses, but the frames were black now. His light gray t-shirt was spread tightly across his obvious chest muscles. The leather jacket he wore kept Draco from seeing just how muscular. Which to be honest was probably for the better. Draco could tell he was about ready to order and so quickly plastered the smile back onto his face. There was no need to show he was uncomfortable with the situation. This was Draco’s shop. Potter should feel weird if anything.
Harry chuckled again, placing his hands into his jacket pockets. The door chimed as a group of people noisily made their way inside. Potter glanced over his shoulder at the group and sighed.
That night, Draco found himself forcefully sat on his bed while Pansy raided the clothing in his closet. Normally, Draco would have pushed her out by now with a few choice words, but he felt guilty standing her up the previous night after band practice. He already felt emotionally depleted after being reprimanded by his band mates, he knew he wouldn’t have the energy to go dancing like he and his friends used to do. Instead, he wandered the streets and holed up on a park bench until he deemed it late enough to head home without crossing any of his friend’s paths. He did not account for his friend’s inability to let sleeping dragons lie. When he arrived back at Millie’s flat, there they all were, dressed to the nines, eating take-way. After a minute of silent treatment, Draco apologized and then agreed to go out the next night with them.
“See you tomorrow Malfoy!” The bell dinged as he strolled out the door, and Draco watched as he crossed the street through his large front window.
“What’s it matter what you think. You’re utterly daft,” Draco complained, tilting into the kisses before tapping at Harry’s shoulder blade, a clear message for him to continue. “Well? I’m listening, Potter.”
“Right you are, darling. I’m so glad someone seems to remember the things I tell them.” Pansy snapped her gaze to Potter, who had until that point been silent. Shame it wouldn’t remain that way. “Harry, darling, you’re content sharing a room with Draco, aren’t you?” Ah, but the anger in those shimmering green eyes was always so nice to admire.
“Make sure you have a receipt with you, then.” Mm, although, Harry had forgotten how much fun it was to screw with Draco.
“Why not?” Harry knew what Draco meant. It shouldn’t be so simple for them to just fall together so easily. There should have been far more kicking and fighting and screaming. It should have taken weeks or even months to realize there was something there between them, and even longer than that to act on it. That’s how it should have gone, but… in some fucked up way, Harry was pretty sure it already had gone that way. “Why can’t it be this simple?”
Blaise was the one to take up the fight, edging in with a hesitant, “Pansy, you know we love you. Truly, we do. We’ll fight any number of light-loving fools for you, but…” Blaise glanced to Draco, who made sure to show an expression that conveyed how properly upset he was with the matter. “Is this really such a good idea for all of us to go?”
“Dahlias,” Harry said firmly, moving to get some and mix them among the bouquet. “They work well with the blue and white and they mean grace and kindness. Thoughts?”
“We’ve been here for two hours,” Potter said, stating the obvious as he always did. Honestly, he was good for nothing except brute strength and looking not completely bad. “I’m pretty sure you already made some blood pact with Hermione about something and Draco’s about to kill Ron.”
“Mhm,” Harry hummed, kissing at the sunlight touched skin and only stopping when fingers were tangling through his hair and tugging sharply. Harry laughed but followed the pull, lips slotting easily against Draco’s own. The kiss was already dangerously familiar, as was the way Draco’s hands dropped down to the back of his neck, pressing him closer — as close as they could get. “Probably use us an example of who not to fall for for years.”
"Oh, is that it?" Draco didn't seem to question the low price, handing over a note. "I'll just hope it works, then."
Not even trying to smother his laugh, Harry leaned forward until his forehead bumped Draco’s. The sudden heat and craving in the man’s eyes had a shiver crawling down Harry’s own spine. “I decided… that I don’t care.”
Potter looked back at Blaise and then at Draco, those bright green killing curse eyes locking with his own. There wasn’t hatred like there had been for so many years — there wasn’t even annoyance and frustration. There was- Merlin, Draco didn’t know what to call those emotions. Breathtaking, perhaps, for a start.
Harry was silent, watching that storm grow as excitement beat away in his chest. Finally, somehow, he managed the breath to speak, answering with a soft, “No.” Harry met Draco’s eyes, breathless as he finished, “But you are.”
