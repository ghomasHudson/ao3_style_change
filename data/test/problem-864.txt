“Ms. Weasley decided to sit in m- Mr. Potter’s lap while he was eating breakfast.” Bellatrix said sweetly, “So I asked Mr. Potter if he was comfortable with that and he said that he was not, so I asked Ms. Weasley to leave his lap. Ms. Weasley proceeded to say that they were dating despite Mr. Potter’s claims that he would never view her in that way unless under the influence of compulsions of potions of some sort and claimed he viewed her as a little sister. Then you arrived.” she summarized. A pretty good summary at that too. He noticed that Bellatrix had almost called him “my son” or “my Hadrian” or “my Hads” or some variation of that before she’d caught herself, but Dumbledore didn’t seem to notice.
“Professor Dumbledore would be so disappointed in you.” she protested, when he briefly released her.

Tom had excelled in all subjects, though some of his Inner Circle taught Harry some of the courses so he could learn from a variety of people. Neville, Fred/George, Luna, and Draco had all been on the same schedule. They now excelled and were more than pleased. They also had learned and mastered Legilimency and Occlumency on the weekends. Harry was sitting in potions, reflecting on this, when he felt his mark burn. He glanced at his friends, and noticed their left arms were feeling similar to Harry’s. He glanced up at Snape, and could tell that Snape felt it too. Class was over in five minutes, so they’d apparate away then. That was another thing. They’d been taught how to apparate over Yule so that they didn’t have to rely on Portkeys and Floo every time they were called. They were quite skilled and would no doubt shock everyone when they officially passed their apparition tests and got their licenses so quickly. He smirked at that thought.
“We aren’t. You will know, but we placed a geas on you add soon as you entered this room. You will be unable to say, wrote, hint, or use an magical or muggle means to inform anyone anything other than ‘I wrote lines in detention’ in regards to this detention. You can’t give us away either. And don’t worry. No one will suspect: hence why you weren’t crucioed.” Hadrian said, giggling.
“Yeah. So I was wondering if I could borrow your Firebolt for the game. You’re a really good seeker and probably don’t need it to beat Malfoy, so I thought it would give Gryffindor an advantage if I used it for the game.” Ron started. Ah, hell no. Hadrian thought. Ron would be lucky for Hadrian to say yes before his firebolt became a horcrux. Now, there was no way in hell unless Ron pried it out of his cold dead fingers, in which case his lovely Firebolt would have a few choice words for Ron seeing as it was his horcrux. That was one thing he hated about Ron. He always asked Hadrian for things in a statement format. The whole I was wondering if... crap wasn’t going to cut it for the new Hadrian who didn’t have a zillion loyalty potions keyed to Ron.

“Hey mate! Excited for the game?” Ron asked, coming up to Hadrian in the locker rooms.
“Well what are you doing? Is only Bellatrix capable of following orders?” Voldemort snarled at the shell-shocked followers. “Sorry my lords” echoed throughout the room as they left the room and left the manor to disapparate away.

“Of course I did. Brilliant version of the imperius in your skiving snack boxes by the way. I thought it ingenious that you were able to make the imperius radiate from the user to be convincing to the teacher.” Fred and George visibly paled at these words.
Professor Amy Tallivex - also known as Bellatrix Lestrange by enemies and Bellatrix Riddle by allies - wrote her name on the board and told the students her history - well her cover history anyway. She talked about how class would work, and the majority of the students look intrigued by their new defense professor. If only they knew just how well educated and proficient she was in the Dark Arts, Hadrian thought, suppressing a smirk.

“It still sucks you had to go through that. Anyway, the fourth principle of the dark is respect. Specifically for all magical creatures. Werewolves, veela, goblins, vampires, the list goes on from there, all are discriminated against. The dark seeks for all magical creatures to be treated with respect - especially those like the goblins who some wizards view as smart enough to manage wizarding money, but not worthy of respect. The dark calls B.S. on that philosophy and believes that all magical creatures are treasured.”
Neville was going to be the hard part. His parents were in Saint Mungos in cause to a certain Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black. Harry truly hoped he could convince Neville, because he’d been a good friend. He approached Neville cautiously, and asked him if he wanted to take a skiving snack box from DADA to avoid Snape on the first day back. Neville agreed --- wanting to get away from Snape, so they did so. They went to the Great Lake, and Harry set up a privacy ward. “Nev, I think you’re a really great friend.” Harry started.
“Hello Hagrid,” Hadrian purred, softly.
“Sure thanks! It sucks having no prisoners to crucio here. Of course the kivarous isn’t the same, but it’ll definitely do in tight situations.” his mother replied.
“You used to be nice. Now you’re acting like all the other pureblood jerks. You don’t respect Professor Dumbledore, you don’t listen to the adults, and you’ve turned your back on your friends. Ever since you started hanging around Malfoy, you’ve become another pureblood Death Eater in training. I wonder if Voldie will forgive you for your vanquishing?” she said with a sneer.
“Awesome! I’d love that even if I could only understand snakes and not speak back.”
Course:
“Well then I wish you luck in that. You might just get an Order of Merlin for that noble deed.” he smirks, smiles and then waves goodbye as they go their separate ways.

Harry was leaving potions, when he ran into Draco in the hallway. “Oh. Hey. Sorry.”
When Harry - no Hadrian and Tom finished reading the results, they looked at eachother and felt like they were going to be sick. Dumbledore had really signed his death warrant this time. “Hadrian” Tom whispered. “We want all of these spells, compulsions, blocks, potions, everything removed and out and then Hadrian can claim his inheritance.” Tom said to the goblin.
“I’d love that. Thank you!” Harry grinned.
Draco went first. His was a thirteen year old girl who’d told her parents everything that went on in the wizarding world every summer. She’d attended Hogwarts before she was captured. Draco started with a classic crucio, before sending a blood boiling curse for a minute before canceling it. Then he sent an entourage of other creative spells, before he finally sent the killing curse at her. The death eaters laughed and clapped when she slumped over dead. “Draco Malfoy, I welcome you to my Inner Circle.” Voldemort announced, as Draco pulled back his hood and received his mask and robes. Then, it was Harry’s turn. Harry was excited. He had been thrilled ever since his wand had had the trace removed from it, and had been waiting for this moment ever since.
When he finished, everyone was laughing and clapping --- some more enthusiastically than others --- and Bellatrix looked the happiest she’d ever been. “That was your new lord.” Voldemort said, “He is my equal and is to be treated as such. Even his mark represents that, as his full name is imprinted on there as with mine. He can summon you in a similar fashion, and will know if you lie to him about something I said or did. You should treat him with the respect you treat me.” Voldemort said with a grin. The inner circle looked at him with respect, especially after his earlier display. “Welcome to my ranks, Harry James Potter.”
Harry summoned all of the Gryffindor courage he could possibly muster, and knocked on the door. “Come in” a voice called from the compartment. It sounded like Draco, but he wasn’t sure. He entered the compartment, and saw that Draco, was surprisingly, alone. He was reading a book that looked like it was about potions, but Harry wasn’t sure. Either way, the other Slytherins obviously hadn’t arrived yet, so he wasn’t going to waste time.
“What? No! I can fight for you and the light!” Neville argued.
The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord rises
“Awesome! So now that that’s out of the way, let’s begin. We were working on wandless magic and dueling stances, so let's get to it.” She wrote up on the board three words: ‘Purpose’, ‘Intent’, ‘Willpower’.
“I beg your pardon, but I don’t see how Ginevera could have mistook me as her boyfriend when I have never shown so much as a slight bit interested her in that way.” Hadrian replied coolly, “Magic has already accepted my words that I will never like her in that way unless under compulsions or potions.” Hadrian added.
“Taken? Why yes it is. By you.” Hadrian said, smirking at his double meaning. Draco plopped down into his lap throwing his legs up and around to under the Gryffindor table. Bellatrix smirked as she saw her son and nephew together. She totally approved of their coupling and thought they complemented each other beautifully.

“Now. You have yet to successfully disarm Hadrian. I suggest you get to it or you’ll have to attend my after hours for Additional Support.” Bella said, with a pointed look. Hermione looked furious and about to burst. She pointed her wand at Hadrian, and with a flick of her wand, nothing happened. Her right eye twitched slightly.
“Hey Potter!” Harry hears his name yelled in the Gryffindor common room. “You weren’t at practice today! Where were you?” Great. He knew this was coming, but as he turned around and saw Oliver walking towards him, arms outstretched in confusion, Harry’s stomach tightened into a knot of dread.
“Nah, that doesn't sound fun, Severus.” Harry said cooly with a light smirk.

“So? They all know your gay now, so no suprises there. Besides, I’m not marked for all they know.”
Compulsion to mistrust Slytherins - cast by Albus Dumbledore
“Can you tell me why not?”
He knew enough to begin the process now. But who to kill? It did require a sacrifice and it’d probably be too suspicious if Ron or Hermione died. What about Vernon Dursley though. Oooh! Now that was a good idea. Though, he wanted to savor the Dursleys deaths with drawn out torture. He didn’t want to hurry it along to create a horcrux. Someone else then. Maybe Arabella Figg? She’d spied on him for years. Or Hagrid? Hagrid had directly caused Hadrian to go to Gryffindor via asking the Sorting Hat. Even if he’d been told to come to pick up Hadrian, that didn’t mean he had to talk about how all Slytherins were evil. And surely he must have noticed the abuse! He all but saw it, yet did or said nothing. Yes. Hagrid. Besides, Hagrid would be in Azkaban had Dumbledore not pulled a serious amount of strings. Yes, that’d do. Nobody would miss the half-giant really anyway except maybe Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione, but then again, he didn’t care about them anymore either.
“I don’t think you’ll be saying that once I tell you. Trust me for now.” Harry says placatingly. “Just answer a few of my questions, and then I’ll answer yours. Sounds good?”
“I’ll let Tom know your answer.”
“Sorry, Oliver, but I can and I will. I wish to put more effort into my studies. I’ll get my firebolt from the locker this afternoon.” Harry said calmly.
“Hello class, I am Professor Amy Tallivex. You can call me Professor Tallivex. I will be teaching you everything you need to know and more.” Bella started. “Today, we are going to continue learning silent casting. This will give you the benefit of surprise on your side. I hear you weren’t successful with Professor Snape?” A murmur of assent went through the classroom.
“Yeah, if you’re mad at us, just tell us.” Ron said.

“For starters, your products. Several of them aren’t exactly made using only light spells.”
Harry immediately headed for Draco’s compartment as soon as he boarded the train. He’d probably have to do it in front of the other Slytherins bound to be in Draco’s compartment, but there was no way to do it any other way. Draco and Harry weren’t exactly friends, so it would be suspicious if he showed up and demanded to talk to Draco alone. Draco could just tell them what Harry said afterwards anyway.
“Ah, yes. It seems our least favorite customer has decided to attempt to ruin more lives. Right this way.” The goblin said. Harry and Tom were surprised to learn that the goblins were not fond of Dumbledore, but did not say anything. “Three drops of blood on this parchment.” Griphook, the Potter account manager, said, handing Harry a knife. Harry pricked his finger and let three drops of blood fall onto the parchment.
“You know the hat wanted to put me in Slytherin,” Harry commented.

“Yes,” Harry said, moaning, pulling them into the RoR and closing the door. There was a lavish bed and a bathroom with a sink and mirror. Potions had been their last class, but they hadn’t gone to dinner yet.
“No problem. I’m going to have so much fun this winter break when I’ll get to avada muggle prisoners as a stress relief again.” he replied.

Hadrian ignored the two of them. He had to think of the perfect objects. They should be something of significance of course. Hadrian could do his invisibility cloak for one of them. There’s his Firebolt - that’s two. Hadrian could also seek down Lyra’s alethiometer and Will’s subtle knife, and of course the amber spyglass. They were legends of course and the subtle knife had shattered, but the goblins would likely fix it as they were experts. The shattered remains should all still be in the same box. Not that they could figure out how to use the two items. They wouldn’t work anymore and they’d be left as two priceless magical artifacts, remnant from a time in which they did work. He could worry about those later. He didn’t have to make all his horcruxes in such close timing to each other. That was five total. For his last two, he’d figure out those later. He only wanted to create one for now and that’d be his firebolt. He’d worry about the invisibility cloak and the others much later.
Draco appreciated Potter’s apology, and he believed him for that matter too. He knew that it wasn’t Potter’s style to fake apologize. “It’s okay. I understand that I probably came off snobbish at first and I know you were brand new to the wizarding world, even if we’ve all grown up hearing about you as the ‘boy-who-lived’. I, umm do forgive you and I’d be happy to start over and be friends.”, Draco said with a smile.

“Ummm… about that. I’m not sure I want to play Quidditch any more. I’ve always liked flying, but I don’t feel like playing anymore. I figured since I didn’t show up at tryouts, you’d understand that I was quitting the team.” Harry said nervously. “I’m sure there are lots of other great seekers though and I don’t want to cause chaos over this.”
“Wow! I never thought of magic that way. That’s really true though now that I think about it.”
“What ever is going on here?” he asked, eyes twinkling in that creepy way.
“Of course, but only I. If you accept my offer, you’d have to refer to him as the Dark Lord or my Lord.” Harry said with an even bigger smirk.
Vaults:
“Let’s go to the ritual room.” the goblin said, nodding at them.
“That’s not possible.”
“Room of requirements?” Draco asked.
“My lord, I am honored,” Harry started.
Draco gave Harry a look as if to ask if it was from who he thought it was. Harry smiled and nodded at Draco, and quickly scribbled a reply on a piece of parchment.
Later that day, Harry handed the letter to Draco to deliver. Hermione was stressing about studying and Ron was complaining about studying, while Harry was just plain studying in the common room that evening.

“Sure!” the twins replied in unison. Up in the room, Harry locked the door behind him and cast a series of silencing spells and privacy wards.
“I can take my firebolt back because it’s MY firebolt. It was given to me and I never gave it to the school. Also, McGonagall can’t force me to play either, so don’t try to pull that bullshit on me.” After having said that, Oliver stomped off - probably to try and go get McGonagall.
Harry came back to school. For this half of the year, he would be working on recruiting less traditional dark students to the dark order. He created a list of potential members:
“True that. So who are you going to cheer for at games?”
Draco stared agape. “Damn! Lucius would be horrified. That’s disgusting!”

Hadrian woke up the next morning. “Hadrian, when I was your age, this book helped me in achieving immortality. I hope that you’ll find the same.” his father said, handing him a book titled: The Secrets of the Darkest Arts. “Thank you, dad.” Hadrian said, “Can I call you that?” he asked.
Hadrian smirked. “Hermione. Hermione Granger.” Hermione huffed. How predictable.
Harry read the letter, burned it --- don’t want people to accidentally read it and get suspicious, and headed to Herbology with Neville and a few other Gryffindors. Draco had History of Magic first with the other Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, so he’d gone in the opposite direction of where Harry was headed. Harry arrived in Herbology, and remembering his Lord’s advice, he paid close attention. He had Double Potions with Slytherin after, so he would investigate Severus’s loyalties then. He paired up with Neville for Herbology, and they worked until the bell rang and then headed off to Potions.
“Avada Kedavra!” Hadrian said, pointing his wand at Hagrid, and he crumpled to the ground. He wiped his magical signature from the area, and apparated back to Hogwarts. He apparated straight into the library, so that Madam Pince could see that Hadrian had been there the whole time, in addition to adding his name to the library’s attendance log. He checked out a book on Quidditch for good measure. His first horcrux had officially been made and was stored in his Firebolt. He’d actually be playing against Slytherin this weekend. He smirked slightly as he thought of his Firebolt. Did that mean Gryffindor technically had an unfair advantage because they had more players on the field? He smirked at the thought. Obviously Quidditch would be the least of people’s concerns if they found out that their Gryffindor Golden Boy had created a horcrux.
“Tom.” Harry corrected. George and Fred squeaked in shock.
“You refer to him as Tom?” they squealed.

“Our parents chose this as their fight. They knew what they were getting into. They could’ve stayed neutral, instead they took a side. They knew that by fighting, they could die. They chose it as a worthy cause. They sent Death Eaters to Azkaban after stunning them and dementors can be worse than death. Some of those Death Eaters had families too. What is your opinion on the Dark?” Harry asked.
“I was just a baby. Lily was the one who did the blood magic to sacrifice herself for me to live.”
The sorting passed rather quickly, and after Dumbledore’s welcome speech, he headed off to bed. Draco and he had devised a schedule to alternate whose table they sat at on the train. The only notable part of Dumbledore's speech was that Snape would be teaching both Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. Dumbledore couldn’t find an alternate DADA teacher, so it seems that Snape finally got his wish.
“WHAT? AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THE FIREBOLT TOO? YOU CAN’T DO THIS! I’M GOING TO GET MCGONAGALL!!!” Oliver ranted.
“For who? Me? Or the light?”
“Yeah,” Hadrian replied.
“Hey.” Draco replied. Harry’s heart did swoops and he couldn’t help himself. He pulled in and kissed Draco. Hard. On the lips and stayed there for five seconds. He pulled away. “Sorry,” Harry said blushing.
“Sexuality doesn’t. If I was straight, then you could make the claim that in ten years I might change my mind and like loud, hyper, sex-loving little sister-like figues even if I don’t now” Hadrian started, ignoring Ginny’s glare, “But if I was straight I wouldn’t like a guy no matter how many years go by. I fear this is a case of the opposite, so I expect that this slight misunderstanding has been cleared up and should it happen again, it must have escalated to a more serious matter.” Hadrian said, cutting in, “And should you refuse to correct her behavior should it happen again, I will be informing the Board of Directors for them to deal with the situation.” Hadrian added.
Snape snapped from the front of the room. Perfect! Everything was going to plan. Not that he’d be doing whatever menial work Severus prepared for him. He should be honored that their Lord invited Harry to join their ranks, because there was nothing more valuable than more members of the Dark Order.

Harry showed up only five minutes after Draco arrived. They got to work right away. Surprisingly enough, with just a little guidance from Draco, Harry found that he was a natural at potions, similar to DADA, and enjoyed the subject. They had lunch at the Gryffindor table, with some of the second years to avoid a confrontation, and then headed back to the room.

“I’ll take that as a yes,” Draco said, as they both broke down into a fit of giggles.
Fred and George loved the fact that they were a part of the Dark Order. Fred, George, Luna, and Neville had been initiated into their lords’ inner circle last week, and had been trained in a variety of new and exciting spells. They were honored. The only downside that Fred and George could see, would be that it would be hard to hide the reason they’d be wearing a lot more long sleeved shirts. For now, it’d be fine, because it was Winter, but in the Summer, it’d be difficult to explain that to their somewhat crazed mum. Molly Weasley was very observant at times and when it came to anything slightly unusual about Fred and George, she’d assume it was rebellion against her (which in a sense this was) and attempt to stamp it out. Long sleeves in the summer most definitely would count as rebellion.

Harry and Tom walked into Gringotts disguised as random wizards. “I’d like to speak to my account manager and to have a full blood test.” Harry said, slipping a piece of paper with more details over to the teller.
“Oh, and Harry,” Voldemort added. “Yes?” “You’ll be getting a special mark of mine. Your mark will have your and my name inscribed into it, meaning you are my equal. I have the mark as well, with Tom Marvolo Riddle printed under it. Yours will say Harry James Potter. You’ll be the only one aside from me to have it as of now.”

At breakfast, Luna and Neville eyed them suspiciously, and Fred and George exchanged grins with each other. Great. So it seems they definitely could tell. It wouldn’t be an issue though.

She should understand the need for privacy while reading and studying. She is a classic mudblood, but still. Merlin it got annoying at times.
“I do, but that’s exactly when I realized it. I love flying on a broom and being up in the air. As for the sport, it hasn’t really been my cup of tea, but I convinced myself that I loved it, since everyone else did.”

“Yeah, but Snape’s pretty smart and suspicious too. He’d be likely to not buy the story with any old dark spell.” Harry prompted.
“Hey Harry!” Draco said greeting him in the Great Hall, “I wrote a letter to father. He was pissed when he heard what you had to go through with your, umm, living arrangements. Anyway, he’s quite powerful and told me that he could gain custody if you wanted it. Do you want me to write back and tell him to do so?” Draco asked.

Finally, they arrived at school. Draco and Harry got off the train and headed up to the castle. Harry knew that Ron would likely not be happy, but frankly, Harry did not care. Draco had the potential to be a great friend. They entered the great hall and only then, did they separate and go to their respective tables. They were allowed to sit wherever they wanted to at meals, even at other tables, but at feasts - like the sorting feast - they were required to sit with their houses. People tended to sit with their house even at regular meals. Harry actually couldn’t think of an exception to that rule that he’d seen so far. Well, that’d have to change this year.

“Thank you. I’ll let Tom know.”
New Chapter! Yay!
“Normally, I’d say no, but to you, of course,” his father replied. Hadrian grinned. He apparated straight to Hogwarts - after claiming his inheritance, he could do that - and met up with Draco informing him of what he learned. Draco was furious with Dumbledore and thrilled to hear of his new title as Lord Black-Riddle. Of course Riddle was a new house and only Dumbledore knew just who founded the Riddle house, but others would think Dumbledore mad should he proclaim said knowledge. And besides, they weren’t about to go telling Dumbledore that he was Lord Black-Riddle unless he had the audacity to call Hadrian, my boy, too many times.
“What’s with all the secrecy?” Fred asked.
“Oh, I wrote lines. Not too bad.” she replied smiling.
In the morning, they met at the entrance to the great hall. It was a Monday, so they were going to sit at the Slytherin table for breakfast. Harry piled pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries, and maple syrup onto his plate, while Draco opted for some waffles and sausage with bacon on the side.
“Of course. The slytherins agree that Snape’s teaching methods suck. We only tolerate him because he is biased in our favor. I’ve had tutors since my dad is, well, my dad. I’m pretty good at potions so I’ll be glad to help you out!”
The next morning at breakfast, Harry received another letter when Owl Post came in at 9:00am.
“Yes!” they both said in unison.
Legilimency - 100% blocked by Albus Dumbledore - partially broken
“Umm… Draco,” Harry started hesitantly, “I wanted to apologize for being a jerk to you. It wasn’t fair of me to judge you based on your house. You don’t have to believe me or forgive me, but I’ll try and put aside my initial feelings towards Slytherin in the future and won’t bother you and your friends anymore. I’m sorry.” Harry looked up at Draco who was staring at his feet.
“So, the dark. The dark’s principles are pretty simple. I’ll start by defining terms that the light often misinterprets. The first one you need to know is muggle. The light got this right and uses this one too. Muggle is anyone non-magical. The second one, is mudblood. This one is severely misinterpreted by the light. A mudblood is any magical person with four muggle grandparents and two muggle parents. They could come from a line of squibs potentially, but not in recent generations. They accept magic and use it, but reject magical culture, opting for Christmas and Halloween over Yule and Samhain. Additionally, they impose a muggle sense of morality onto wizards. An example is your friend Hermione. Hermione is from a muggle family and has no known wizard relatives. She uses S.P.E.W. to try and force house-elves to accept freedom in addition to better rights. Most house-elves do not want this, and they also need their master’s magic to control their own. A halfblood is anyone with one, two, or three magical grandparents. They have viewpoints similar to mudbloods. A pureblood is anyone with four magical grandparents. A first generation witch/wizard (also called first gens), is the first person with magic in their family (like a mudblood) but takes the time to learn and immerse themselves in wizarding culture and upholds the statue of secrecy when they are around their family. A second generation witch/wizard (also called second gens), is the half blood form of a first gen. A blood-traitor is a pureblood, who sympathizes with mudbloods, but not first gens, and tries to promote mudblood mindsets. They also reject traditions, often causing chaos in pure-blood society, especially if their parents are not blood-traitors as well. The mud in mudblood is not representative of their muggle relatives, rather representing the fact that they are taking their wizarding blood and smearing it with muddy ideas. We need new lines, and everyone, including the Dark Lord, agrees with this. We don’t need muggles interacting with us though, and we need to preserve our traditions. Make sense so far?”
Luna Lovegood
“Alright, no big deal. You have me now. Magic is all about intent. You have to mean it.” She said, giving Hadrian a smirk. Hadrian knew she was thinking back to her lesson in torture curses at the ministry after Hadrian’s disastrous attempt at a Crucio on her after she sent Sirius stumbling into the veil. Hadrian smirked back at her, but only for a brief second, before he schooled his features again. “If it helps, imagine the spell happening as you think it. Wordless casting doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t think the words, but imagine the curse happening as you think the incantation. For example,” she pointed her wand at Hadrian and his eyes went wide. For a second, he thought she was going to Crucio him, but then she did the tell-tale wand motions and his wand flew into her hands. She raised an eyebrow at him as if to say ‘I know what you thought, but I wouldn’t Crucio my own son, much less in a school filled with staunch light and Dumbledore supporters.’, which had a pretty good point. He gave a slight dip of his head, to nod in reply.

Godparents:
Severus felt sick. He couldn’t warn Dumbledore or the order about Harry or even hint about it, and his beloved Lily’s son was turning into a monster. What would she say to Severus if she could see her son now? He couldn’t believe what he’d just witnessed. He would pass on as much information as he could to the Order. This was insane.
“Don’t you think I could recognize the imperius when I saw it? It’s subtle, but I’m observant when it comes to magic.”
“True that, true that! I always thought it was kinda cool you could talk to snakes. Do you think you can teach me?”
Destroy the Dark Lord with love
“That is a very noble goal. I think that would be just what the wizarding world needs!” Harry said with a smile. Draco was glad that Harry agreed with him. They were silent for a while before Harry spoke up again.
“How did…”
“Granger!” Hadrian snapped. “You aren’t successful because you don’t have a strong enough willpower. You clearly have the intent if your scrunched up face is any clue and you seem quite confident, so that only leaves your mental stamina.” Hadrian said, lecturing the bushy haired girl he used to call a friend. “You want to silently disarm Weasley?” he asked her rhetorically.

The five minutes passed quickly, and they went to an unoccupied bathroom to portkey to Hogsmeade. They couldn’t apparate in or out of Hogwarts, but they could disapparate from Hogsmeade. They made a portkey so no-one would be suspicious if they traced the portkey, and then apparated from Hogsmeade to Riddle Manor. Severus, it seemed, was also there by the time they arrived. Potions was his last class, so they didn’t worry about their absences being noticed. It was a Hogsmeade weekend anyway, so it shouldn’t matter if they weren’t strictly noticed over the weekend. Harry was excited and thrilled to see what their lord, Tom, needed.

“Alright. I’ll see you in Additional Support, Ms. Granger. I’ll add you to the list I have. My Additional Support is on Saturday from 7:00am - 10:00am. It is three hours long. Anyone who feels they need help can come. If I add you to my list; however, you have to come. If I add you to my required attendee list, it basically means you have suffered under more lenient teachers than I, and until I deem you ready, Additional Support will be how you spend your Saturday mornings. I will make this clear only once. IF, you decide to not show up AND you are on my list, you will lose two points for your house for every minute you don’t show. I will not waste my time hunting down students. If you are excelling and you want to, you are allowed to come and help me instruct those that need help. Additionally, you will EARN two points for your house for every minute you are there. I will NOT be repeating this again. If you forget my rules, you can find yourself asking another student.” Bellatrix said. “I’ll call out the names of all those who’ll need to start attending at the end of each lecture.” his mother finished. Hadrian suppressed a smirk.
“Are you sure? I just wan-”
“Whatever you wish. How about Tom. It was my birth name after all. Tom could be for non-dark-lord related business. You may also call me Voldemort if you wish --- for dark lord business..” “Yes of course my- Tom.”
“Yes, yes, yes.” Dumbledore said, placating the growing whispers. “Professor Tallivex will be taking over Defense Against the Dark Arts.” Several more whispers broke out at this. “Professor Snape will still teach Potions, but due to his busy schedule, Amy, here, will be taking over Defense.” Dumbledore said, quieting the chatter. Amy smirked ever so slightly.
Harry port-keyed back to school with a grin on his face. It was November, and Yule Break was right around the corner. Harry couldn’t wait for his mark. He was warned that he’d have to wear long sleeves at all times though. He’d get a mask that Voldemort had fitted just for him in addition to his robes, also fitted just for him. They’d both have very protective wards around them, because he was Voldemort’s horcrux after all. He would be allowed to go on raids, but only because of the additional runes that had been invisibly sewn onto the robes and invisibly painted onto the mask. Soon to be his robes and his mask. Tom had removed the trace from his want as well, so he wouldn’t have to worry about Ministry interference. He’d eagerly told Draco everything --- with Tom’s permission of course, and sworn him to secrecy. Draco had been thrilled for his friend. Due to their close nature, Draco would also be marked early --- over Yule with Harry --- and become Inner Circle.
“Wait…” George said.

Harry put on his mask and cloak along with the others and apparated out of Riddle Manor to the DoM. He and Draco sent AK’s at the Unspeakables that got in his way and they split up to search for the prophecy. “Found it!” Draco shouted. Harry made his way to Draco and looked at the prophecy. They needed to get out of there quickly, so they apparated back to Riddle Manor. Harry showed the dark lord the prophecy, and they put their hands on it together. They watched in horror as the prophecy unfolded:
“Yeah, I know you didn’t come to tryouts. You must have been busy or something. I had a boatload of stuff on my plate this summer too. Don’t worry. I saved your spot, so you are still on the team. Now where were you this morning?” Oliver said, interrupting Harry.
“True, so it’d have to be strong, but I don’t think their bad for making Snape let me out of class.” Neville countered.
Damn. Ginny looked furious, and glancing up at the staff table, it looked like Dumbledore was having trouble concealing his rage at Hadrian’s refusal to follow the guide of the potions and compulsions they thought they had him jacked up on. Hadrian may be hiding his true loyalties for now, but he sure wasn’t going to pretend to love the bitch just because Dumbledore wanted him too. Dumbledore was lucky that Hadrian was even pretending to like her as a sister and Ron and Hermione as friends. How stupid had he been to even consider them the “right sort”. Stupid Dumbledore and his potions, compulsions, and blocks. Hadrian was relieved to be rid of his lies and manipulations. Hadrian inwardly groaned as he saw Dumbledore making his way down to the Gryffindor table.

Harry threw a big hug onto Draco. “Sorry. Yes. I’d love that! Can you, umm,” Harry dropped his voice into a whisper, “Tell Lucius to inform the Dark Lord that the Gryffindor Golden Boy isn’t all that light anymore. Just let Lucius know to tell him that I would like to fight for the dark.” Harry said quietly so that no-one else could hear. “Of course!” Draco said with a small smile. “I’m sure, you know who, will be thrilled to hear it.”
Potions was as it usually was, the only difference being his increase in competence for the subject. He needed time to question Severus, so he had to get detention with Snape. That shouldn’t be hard given how much the man hated him. He tossed a wink at Draco and tossed a random ingredient in. His potion turned a dark yellow and stopped bubbling. It actually wasn’t random --- he’d made sure it wouldn’t hurt anyone --- but Snape would give him a detention for it either way, so it didn’t need to be dangerous.

“Well what did the Dursleys do? I mean, I know your life wasn’t the pampered prince it was made out to be anymore, but it couldn’t have been that bad, could it? Dumbledore is a lot of things, but I don’t think he’d put his savior in a toxic environment.”

“Yeah, why?”
The next morning, Harry woke up excited as ever. He was getting marked. Today was going to be awesome! He hopped out of bed and slid into the robes Friva had left for him on his dresser. He headed down stairs and had breakfast with Draco and Tom. He ate eggs with bacon and a chocolate pastry. Draco had the same thing.
Harry was walking to Potions, when Draco passed him a note in the hall. He opened it and read the message.

“Really?”
Draco was working with Longbottom. Severus seemed to find this hilarious, but what he didn’t know was that Draco actually liked Neville ever since he joined the dark. He wondered what Snape would think if he knew that Neville had an identical tattoo to Snape’s on his left arm. He smirked at the thought. Neville had actually been pretty competent ever since the Dark Lord started tutoring. Funny how that is. Snape’s teaching terrified Neville while the bloody Dark Lord’s teaching helped Neville gain confidence actually. After working with him, Nev wasn’t quite so scared of Snape either. When had he taken to calling Longbottom, Nev. It didn’t matter. They were friends now. Harry, on the other hand, Draco glanced over at him. Those avada kedavra eyes were intense with passion and seemed to make Draco’s heart do funny things every time he locked eyes with him. That messy black hair that covered the majority of his scar made Draco’s mind forget about going straight to hell and take a few turns along the way. Shoot! He was getting distracted. It didn’t matter as much though. Neville was actually quite good at Potions after learning from the Dark Lord. Truly funny how that was.
Harry looks at his best friend with a big smile, and he sees the confusion in his eyes but lets it go.
Harry frowns, ‟is there a magic way to babyproof?”
They were greeted by an old-looking man behind the counter, “how can I help you two?” he asked. Harry asked about the snake. “Ah, yes, he is a Western Hognose Snake! He’s about one year now. The venom it produces is not harmful to muggles or wizards! He will probably be around 40cm in the end.” Harry asked if it was possible for him to keep him back. “Well, I usually don’t do that. But, not many people want to buy snakes anymore. Especially after You-Know-Who’s snake. But for one Knut I’ll keep him back.”
It seemed that with that people around him agreed. Harry was steered away from the people. At the end of the Hallway, he found Draco standing there. He would have run to him, had it not been for the fact he could cave under the pressure. The four of them walked off, it seemed Draco had an idea of where to go. In the end, they wandered up to the seventh-floor corridor, which opened up into the Room Draco and Harry had used the year before. Though it felt like a lifetime.
“You’re so bad,” Draco said, “you were the one worried about that, only to make fun of your friend seconds later.”
Sirius hugged the three, wishing them all a good term. Moly cried while hugging them, Ginny whispering encouraging words to her.
“We decided to not tell anyone together,” Harry say, “it wasn’t just me.” He shakes his head. “That you told your mother and friends you’re dating someone doesn’t mean I have to”
That night, Harry cast a
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, keep the focus on my magic on the Malfoy family.” The scroll and their strings glow bright, only the light of the scroll dimming. Narcissa grabs it and places it on the side.
Harry feels himself flush and pushes down the urge to pull his cloak around him. Instead, he gives them a polite nod when their eyes go back to his face. They nod back and it´s more than Harry had hoped so soon.
“Not really,” Harry said, “they’re nice. And Sirius likes to have his family close. Besides, it’s not like they ever want to step into that manor again.” Dean just hummed in acknowledgement.
Draco stops in his conversation with Theo, to turn to Leo. ‟You know Neville,” he says slowly.
Harry feels like laughing but another contraction starts, and he takes a deep breath. ‟Yes,” he says, ‟get the bag, we´re going.”
Harry smiles, pulling Draco into his side, ‟let´s first see what Pomfrey says yeah?” Draco nods, ‟god, I have no idea how they´re going to react.”
“I might actually start to like that husband of yours,” Ginny grumbled, “thank him for us will you.”
‟I mean, he did speak at my trial,” Draco says with a tilt in his head. He´s only realised he´s said something he´s never had before when the three of them all stare wide-eyed. ‟But yeah, he did hate me, but not anymore,” he adds, hoping they won't ask him about the trial.
Draco continued the motion by circling the little muscle with the tip of his tongue. He moved around it, and over it. Harry moving his hips higher, back onto Draco’s face. Draco chuckled, the vibrations moving through his mouth onto Harry. Causing Harry to moan louder. Rewarding the sound Harry made, he pushed his tongue past the ring. He sucked lightly, moving in and out.
‟It´s nothing,” she says, ‟I don´t mind going out for a few hours, and I know the village. It´s easier than letting you stroll around alone and safer.”
“Why did you become a part of this circle of followers?”
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Harry didn’t let him continue talking. “I’ve been so busy with taking care of people and taking care of the whole wizarding world. I’ve given them everything I had, including my life.” He paused, stood from his chair and started pacing. “And I know being a Lord is important to you, but I don’t know if I could handle the whole responsible for legislations and a family thing. Sure, there is no real Potter clan, but still. There is a reason I don’t want to become an Auror anymore. Everyone kept looking at me for how to do things, and how to proceed. I,” he paused looking at Draco not knowing what to say anymore. “I don’t know if I can handle it.”
He was faintly reminded of Riddles diary, and when he looked at Ginny he saw she was too, they huddled next to each other to look through it and saw every difference that they could. Harry was happy that he and Ginny were on good terms.
“Because,” Neville said, “it is how it has always been, and because it is the right of Lord’s and Lady’s. Before there was a ministry of magic, before the Wizengamot existed, the house of Lord’s and Lady’s made the rules, they held legislations and all that.”
‟Maybe someone is holding Rita back from doing that.”
“Not really,” Draco answered, “when Riddle announced he would move in, we kind of had to remove everything that made it Malfoy’s manor. He didn’t want any knowledge that it was the ancient house of the Malfoy family, because he wasn’t part of it, and it would remind him that it wasn’t his. So we hid all the coat of arms, all the portraits of our family members. The only ones that were left were in my father’s office, as that can only be opened by the head of the house. And of course, our own rooms stayed like they were.”
Draco has already cleared most knickknacks from his room. The picture frames, the notebooks. After breakfast, Harry puts his clothes in a box. It takes around three boxes before Harry has finally taken out all Draco´s clothing, and that´s not even counting the watches and other jewellery.
“You guys look great,” Seamus said, “are you wearing eyeliner, Harry?” All eyes turned to Harry who was nodding but looking a bit nervous. “Looks good, would look like something Sirius would do,” which caused everyone to nod their head in agreement.
The front door was open, and Harry saw Pihu standing there together with Lucien. Harry looked over to Draco who seemed as surprised as Harry to see the two together.
“Wow,” Blaise sighed, “how did we think our school days were impressive when that happened while for us it was mostly being punched in the face by Hermione Granger.”
The rest of the day went by slowly, even though they had many free periods. They had gotten a lot of homework for Herbology. The same with Charms when they got back from that. This time Remus had decided to give them homework as well. Harry sat with Draco before dinner, both reading next to one another. Though it was harder to not lean into each other as they usually do while reading. When it was time for dinner Harry sat at the Gryffindor table feeling slightly guilty.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco said, using the voice he had so many times. Riling Harry up. They held eye contact, as they had during the whole thing.
“He wanted to come with, said it was boring without anyone.” He moved over to Draco, hissing something to the snake. “You guys wanna see him?” he asked Seamus and Dean. They nodded, and Harry thrust out his arm, the snake uncurling and moving up his hand. He heard the snake hissing, and Harry laughed. “He wants me to tell you two that he’s cute and you should admire his snout. He’s very proud of it.” The little guy sat on his hand looking at the two humans in front of him.
She nodded in understanding, “no time like the present to figure it out,” she smiled, “but I actually came by to propose something.” The two men nodded, sitting down on their bed so Narcissa could take the chair in front of them.
“Relax Ron,” Harry said, “it’s okay, he can sleep in my room.” Sirius walked to the end of the room, “Follow me Draco I’ll show you where Harry’s room is.”
“Maybe,” Draco turned on his side to look at Harry, “I’ll have to talk to Hermione first.” Harry nodded. “It might be a nice side project,” Draco wondered out loud, “the classes are becoming a bit boring with all the revising.”
McGonagall turned to Harry, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” She asked. Harry nodded, turning around to look for Ron and Hermione, only to see them already gone. He realised they must’ve gone to the chamber.
“No, no, just,” Luna sighed, “you aren’t sitting with her now, so I thought maybe there was something wrong.”
“Morning,” Draco said, his hand cupping Harry’s cheek. “You are doing an awful lot of thinking so early in the morning.” He kissed Harry lightly.
‟I´m not tired,” Harry says, ‟but we have all the time in the world to unpack. It´s nice to have a free living room, and we should start with our bedroom tomorrow. But now we could do something more fun.” Harry smiles.
‟Next week perhaps,” Harry says while he pushes himself up. He drapes himself across and amused Draco´s lap. ‟We have better things to do now.”
,” the snake said, causing Harry to smile.
“But if that happens, I know nothing of legislations, I know nothing about the Wizengamot. Hell, the only thing I really know is that this is really fucking confusing.”
Harry turned around, leaning against his desk. He looked at her. “Do you know what a marriage bond really means?” he asks, she hesitated, never happy to show she didn't know something but shook her head. “When you are bonded with the one you love, you are connected with your mind and your magic.” He paused, trying to remember how Draco explained it, “you can feel each other's feelings in the back of your mind, and you can feel each other’s magic in your core.” She looked up surprised.
For the rest of the day, they talk about what Pansy and Blaise have been doing. Blaise tells them how it is in Italy, where he has been for most of the time. He is avoiding his mother and one of her new husbands. Pansy tells them that she’s been moving around in high society, helping her family out with their duties. She had taken up designing in her free time.
“Sure, that was all it was, eh,” Seamus said, adding an eyebrow wobble to it. Harry just shook his head, though he smiled at the antics of his friend.
“Bring them to the Drawing Room,” she said, she looked at Harry, he was sure she recognised him. “Call Draco, he’s home, if it really is Potter he will know.”
He heard the sound of the condom package ripping open. Draco poured some more lube over the condom, making sure that there was enough, that he wouldn’t hurt Harry. He held Harry still with his hips with one hand, slowly he pushed in, stopping every time he felt Harry tense, and only moving again when he relaxed again. It wasn’t long till he was inside, Harry speeding up the process by pushing back.
Harry laughed, “who said I was vanilla?” he winked, “just had to think which one I was going to tell you guys.”
“No,” Harry said, “I woke up on my own.” Harry laid down next to Draco, though there was enough space between them. Harry intertwined their hands.
Harry turned to Draco, realizing what he meant, “you don’t have to.”
“A Gryffindor,” Pansy repeated, “I mean why a Gryffindor. There are so many good looking Slytherin and Ravenclaws. Hell, there are some good looking Hufflepuffs even.”
Scorpius nods, ‟okay,” he says, ‟I´ll go.”
“Not entirely,” Hermione said, “I did find that there is little that can destroy it. In the book, they warned the wizard that they had to protect it well, as there are things that can destroy it. They mentioned Basilisk venom, which, I suppose we knew.”
“Yeah, I thought you might say that.” Aberforth said, dejected, “The order of the phoenix is dead boy, You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, anyone who’s pretending differently is kidding themselves.”
‟You saw what he´s like!” Draco says.
“How do we have so much homework, when we only have five classes?” Ron complained, putting his bag over his shoulder.
“Uh,” Harry thought, “well, I spoke to Draco,” this caused a few eyebrows to lift around the group, “the day before I told you two that I had Legilimency lessons? Since that was an excuse.”
The rest of the day went by slowly, as did the beginning of the next day. During the middle of the day, Kreacher returned with Mundungus in tow. The three questioned him and found that Umbridge had taken the locket.
“Sleepy,” Draco chuckled, “and very happy,” he added. Harry smiled casting a cleaning spell on both of them. Harry pulled their blanket over them, pulling Draco in his arms. They fell asleep around each other.
“Well then, lunch on me. Consider it a wedding gift,” she said walking away. “I’ll give you our best.”
Harry had thought about it before, but there was nothing he had that could give him any more information. The only thing he thought might help was the book of the prince. “Don’t be mad,” she told Hermione, “but I still got the prince’s book.”
“Why what, Hermione,” he asked, though he had a feeling.
” the snake asked, “
“What are you thinking Harry?” he asked.
‟Is there anything else you want to know?” Pomfrey asks.
With dinner over Draco and Harry leave the great hall together with Harry´s friends. Ginny and Luna trail behind them. Halfway through the night, McGonagall comes in. She announces her presence loudly, letting them have the time to hide any bottles they ought to know should not be in the room.
“I intend to show him how much I love him, how much I think he is worth,” he paused thinking, “how much he means to me as Harry, not as the saviour, but as Harry.”
“Sure,” He turned to Sirius, “ready?” the other man nodded. Their duel lasted not as long as Harry’s and Draco’s. They moved in sync as well, and they reacted before anyone could see something happen, but when one of them lost their wand the game was over. They tried to use wandless magic, but even though they managed something, it wasn’t strong enough to actually do anything. In the end, Remus stupefied Sirius, casting a finite seconds later.
Harry and Draco both look towards the houses. ‟They´re so uniform,” Harry whispers to Draco, ‟kind of reminds me of Privet Drive, all the same, no individuality.”
The prospect of splinching caused Harry to focus more, even though he didn’t like the idea, he knew that he had to be able to do Apparition, after all, he never knew if he would need it in the future.
That Sunday when they walk into a tailor, Draco having said that Harry should let something be made for him. It had taken some convincing, but in the end, Harry had conceded. “Hello sirs,” the tailor said, “how can I help you two.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “that didn’t make it any more logical.”
‟Depends on what you think don´t it,” he says, ‟but I´ll get to it.” She nods slowly, looking Harry up and down.
Harry laughs, ‟well, I wanted to ask Ron. But I was also thinking maybe Neville.”
“Nonsense,” Sirius said, “of course you can stay as well.” He turned to Harry, “tell her the address. We really should disband the whole thing, you can’t even just ask someone over.”
“What?” He asked, confused. His confusion must have been very evident on his face as Sirius and Remus laughed slightly, though he could tell they were nervous.
Draco nods, ‟we should make Ron the godfather. He´s your best mate. And besides, Neville can be the godfather of our next one.”
“I want to have all the furniture checked for any curses, and keep them there to sell with the manor. That is unless they have the Malfoy crest, then I would want to put them in storage.” She looked at her son, “I imagine you want the clothes that have been given through the times, but not those that were made for your father?”
‟I do,” Harry says, ‟and maybe your reputation is in the gutter right now, but you can change that. And even then, who cares about your family’s reputation. He´s your son, he should also have your last name.”
‟What´d you tell him?” Harry asks.
‟I guess she doesn´t mind returning as much as people thought,” Narcissa said. ‟Well, do tell me if anything strikes your fancy don´t you. And if you need any help with acquiring it, I´ll be available for anything. Be that legal aid or funds.”
“Will it help with the mission,” Sirius asked, his face unchanging. Harry nodded, “then we will do it, but Harry, my brother was a Death Eater. Whatever he owned was dark, it won’t do you any good.”
“It wasn’t that impressive really,” Harry said, “it was kind of a normal year then. I mean sure, everyone thought that a serial killer was after me, and he did break-in into the school. But I would say that time that Riddle was at the back of Quirrell's head was the more impressive.”
“We’re doing something by the lake tomorrow,” Seamus said when Neville asked him what he was going to do. “Not telling you what, because it’s a surprise,” he told Dean. Neville laughed, as Dean held up his hands. “You Harry?”
‟I bought stuff for Carbonara; you know how to make that?” Harry asks.
The next day their friends left, having eaten breakfast together. The group helped clean the mess they had made and left, leaving Harry and Draco alone for their last day without any guardians.
“God yes,” Harry answers.
“No,” Harry said, “even though sneaking around was kind of fun, I will rather be able to sit in the common room and lean against you while reading. I’ll tell them tomorrow, Ginny as well, might get her to back off.”
I know it might all seem a bit planned now, but I think that Harry and Draco need an actual plan if they set up a way to assassinate Dumbledore. Especially because it would need to go well, and the people in the school would need to be as protected as they could be. And I think this was the best way to do it.
‟What time is it?” Harry asks taking his glasses from Draco´s hand and looking around. He doesn´t see Ron or Hermione, but Seamus and Dean are sitting by the fire, both reading a book.
“Morning,” someone said from the doorway. Harry and Draco pulled apart, the tips of their ears turning only slightly red. They looked up to see Remus standing there, a smirk on his face. It wasn’t the first time he had seen them kissing, but it never ceased to embarrass Draco a bit. “Don’t stop on my account,” he said chuckling, “just wanted you guys to know that I was getting some tea.”
He felt that the ring would bring him comfort, so he decided that he would wear it. If Hermione would say anything about it he would just dismiss it. He wanted to wear it now, he needed the physical reminder. He put it on, the weight foreign and comforting at the same time.
Draco nodded, “though, we’re buying him new clothes first,” he smiled, “he would be eaten alive if he met them wearing something like that,” he said with a disgusted look at Harry’s clothes.
The tables and chairs were all made of the same pale white material as the chairs outside, though these had none of the decorations as the plates and cutlery were silver and golden enough for that. The silver and gold was charmed that it could not leave the estate without warning either Harry, Draco or the house-elves.
“Yeah, I agree though, I’m pissed,” Seamus said, “and tomorrow we have classes bright and early.”
Not everyone had been as lucky, another order member, Harry had not known him personally, had died in the battle, killed by an unknown Death Eater. That death made Harry realise that even the best trained, even those who knew where they were stepping in to, were going to die. It made him realise, that not only had Voldemort returned, but the war had also begun. That had been the first battle.
“Something Dean said,” he said. Not planning to elaborate, he didn’t have to because Professor Sprout walked in then starting her class. When the class ended he hurried out of the greenhouse, walking over to the lake. He waited there for Ginny.
Blaise and Pansy laugh while Draco scowls, ‟okay so I could fill the bookcases and probably more than those alone.” He shrugs, ‟we´ll just have to see.”
“Ah,” he says, “I see we are almost complete,” he looked around, “we only miss Miss Greengrass and Mr Macmillan right?” they looked around nodding. Harry hadn’t noticed Hannah walking in, but she was standing next to Neville. The last two walked in, seeing everyone there. They looked at all the teachers, a bit vexed why there were three.
“Because the Gringott vaults have more than just money in them.” Draco said, “Though if I remember correctly, you’ll only get access to the family vaults when you turn seventeen.”
“Let’s go to my room,” he said, “I need to set up the terrarium.” Though he knew he should not rub things in Ron and Hermione’s eyes, he couldn’t stop himself from kissing Draco on his cheek. “See you later,” he said. Stepping away he walked up to his room, trusting Hermione and Ron to follow.
‟There´s more,” Ron says softly, ‟isn´t there?” Harry nods, not looking at either of them. ‟You know we don´t care who you like mate,” Ron says, ‟we just want you to be happy. Everyone just wants that for you.”
“You couldn’t have known,” Harry said, “no one really knows.” He took a sip from the glass, the burn grounding him. “But, what Draco did, showed that our magic is intertwined, more than we thought it would be by the bonding. It also showed that Draco is a very powerful wizard. Especially since not even half an hour later, Draco gave me more magical power when I duelled Riddle.”
They start to buy things for Teddy, all with recommendations from Andromeda. But also, because they like it. When they´re in the shop they can´t help but buy some things for Scorpius. Draco buys a stuffed ferret for Scorpius. Harry had laughed when he´d seen it, and kept it next to Draco, mentioning their likeness. Draco had grumbled but bought it.
‟They´ll be using stairs one way or another.” He pauses, ‟we could put Scorp in the second room upstairs, and Teddy in that one,” he says pointing to the room next to the bathroom. ‟Teddy is already one, you saw him waddle. He can walk stairs, and it´s not like he´ll stay over a whole lot in the beginning.”
“What’d you have in mind?” Draco asked, still amused by Harry’s antics.
“No, he only has to stay for a few days, but nothing too bad, don’t worry,” Harry whispered back. “I have to go, Draco,” he heard people walking around, “Love you,” he whispered.
“He knows,” said Phineas.
He tells Mrs Weasley first on Sunday, and she reacts almost the same as Ron. She tells him she loves him no matter what, and to bring him next week. During dinner, Harry announces it again, to Fleur, Bill, Percy and George. They all congratulate him on his relationship and are more than happy for him. George pulls him aside, asking if it´s because of him that Harry hasn´t told him.
She smiled, “that’s great Harry!” she said, hugging him.
“Please do come down,” he called out of sight, “wouldn’t want our breakfast to get too cold.”
“Mate, why are you smiling?” Ron asked when he saw Harry appear. “I can’t imagine a class with Snape so good that you left it smiling.”
‟Why´s that,” Ron asks gently.
“You, do what you do best,” Dumbledore said, “you protect your friends, but if you are present when I am killed, if you see it, which is likely. You will need to act as if you hadn’t known. You will have to act that you are angry at Professor Snape. Because, if you are in the room, someone might be able to tell, no matter how well covered you are. So, act, as if you had not known.” He turned to Severus, “And in turn, you will defend yourself, but, make sure that Harry is not mortally wounded.” The professor nodded.
“Malfoy,” Harry said loudly, opening the door.
“You think so?” Draco looked at Harry with so much hope it could break Harry’s heart.
“You don’t have to worry, Ron,” Harry said, “it’s not like I haven’t woken up screaming in our other years.”
The memories went fast, first of his mother and Snape, when they first met, next the two were sitting together, talking about magic and what the world was like. The third scene was at the platform he saw snape looking at his mother arguing with his aunt. She was calling his mother a freak. the memories went on, all about Snape and his mother. Then it changed, he saw snape cowering before Dumbledore. He saw him beg for his life. He told him about the prophecy how he thinks it was Lily. He asked him to save her.
“Okay, if there is anything I can do, just tell me okay? We are still your friends and we can still help, even if you can't tell what happens in the lessons.” Harry opened his mouth with a mischievous look in his eyes, “That doesn’t mean I’m going to do the work for you,” she said looking as if she was McGonagall’s daughter. “I think you should get going, it's almost ten.” With that, she stood letting harry pack his stuff on his own.
‟You´re an energetic bugger aren´t you,” Scorpius gives a kick as if saying that he is. Harry and Draco both laugh. ‟You are feeling better?” Draco asks Harry.
“My friends know, so why shouldn’t yours,” he said, “I don’t think Kingsley would kill us for that. I honestly wonder how it’s not common knowledge. You were very obvious during the last battle.”
The way Twycross had said that reminded him of what he had said only hours before to Draco. Harry looked around to see people concentrating intently. He saw Ernie Macmillan focussing so hard he had turned light pink as if he had been holding his breath. Harry laughed slightly, turning his focus back on his place.
‟The house is connected to the blood wards,” Draco tells his mother, ‟So you´re free to come by.” She nods with a smile. ‟We´ll see you next week Saturday?”
“Oh, that’s nice, I thought it was only for the sixth years. But that’s cool.” He explicitly didn’t say anything about going with her, Hermione looked at him strangely but let it go. “We should get to class.” With that, the trio went on to their classes.
“You will tell them, that because during Christmas you have more free time and that because there are fewer teachers walking around, it is the best time to work on making the Vanishing cabinet work.”
“Harry,” Draco said, “you sure?” Harry nodded.
They separate before dinner, Harry and Draco going back to the castle, Blaise and Pansy going home. “Harry,” Pansy says, after hugging Draco, “hurt him, and I will kill you. Trust me, I am not as incompetent as the dark lord.”
Harry laughs, ‟I´m glad you had fun,” he says, ‟there´s still soup if you haven´t eaten lunch yet.”
“Okay,” Draco said, “like I said the night we married, anything you want to. We’ll tell them when you’re ready when you feel like they are ready. Besides, it might be better for me to get to know them better before we tell them we are married.”
Draco gasped going ridged, Harry paused immediately, waiting for Draco to either relax or tell him to pull out. Slowly Draco’s breath evened out, relaxing once again. Harry moved in slowly, moving inches until he was flush against Draco.
“Well,” he shrugs, “maybe Lord Malfoy-Potter, but we’ll have to discuss that,” he said, looking at Harry. He saw the thrown look on his husbands face, “I now gather you have no knowledge on how noble houses function,” he said to Harry, who just shook his head. “Why did you think mother was teaching you etiquette?”
He was awake before Harry. He could feel the distress in his movement, in the mumbling in his sleep. He turned to Harry, making sure that the lights were still floating. He woke him, calling out for him, shaking him lightly. Harry’s eyes flew open. The spark that was always in his eyes, momentarily gone. He looked at Draco, tears in his eyes.
“I try,” he says absentmindedly his hand goes to the pocket where his ring was hidden.
The two of them sat down and talked about the rest of their vacation. Harry told Hermione about the talk he had with Sirius and Remus, leaving out the part about asking if his parents would mind him dating Draco. She listened intently, agreeing with most of what Remus had said. They talked till it was time for them to go up to their bed, Harry and Draco had decided to stick with talking Tuesdays and Thursdays.
They slowly unpack the rest of the house, and by the time they´re done the office is full of books, the guest room has space for people to crash and their own bedroom has their clothing hung and in place. They hang the art up around the house. There´s still a lot to do, things to buy. Drapes, small tables, a washing machine. They have a list hanging on their fridge, and every time a new thing is added. Another list hangs next to it pretty quickly, detailing food and other bare necessities that need to be bought.
McGonagall nods, taking the free seat next to Pomfrey. She looks at the boys expectantly. Harry and Draco look at one another before looking at Pomfrey unsure what to say.
“The pleasure is mine,” Harry says, coming back in himself, “and please, call me Harry.” He gives his politest smile at Blaise, letting go of his hand.
“Yeah, I don’t mind keeping you a secret for now,” Harry said, “but in the future, I would love to let the whole world know that Draco Malfoy has captured my heart. But you are right, we should see how people react to us even being allies.” Harry kissed the boy in his arms, relishing in the feeling.
“Yeah,” Ron said, “we apparated like every three days at max. It gets really exhausting, but now we can do it in our sleep I reckon.”
When they finished the tea, Draco saw that the sun was already coming up. Casting a quick tempus he saw it was already 5 o’clock. Draco knew it wouldn’t help to go back to sleep. Not only would Harry be unable, but they also needed to be wake up two hours later. They stayed in silence, watching the sun come up slowly, seeing the sun rays move along the room. The sound of Jazz still filling the room.
“What can I say,” Draco said, “no one can resist my charm.”
They find their lunch in a nice little sandwich shop, and they get a few looks from the muggles, but none of them show any actual confusion.
“That it might be Lord Malfoy-Potter?” Harry asked, Draco nodded.
“Well,” Kinglsey said, contemplating his answer, “I think you should be able to say everything. Keeping things a secret will only make people want to find out more. But, I do recommend that you only tell people you trust.” The others nodded. Kingsley stood, giving them all a hug, “thank you, for telling me, and for being so brave.” They all smiled leaving his office.
The following week Harry and Draco are roped into all kinds of activities with their friends. By working hard with all their friends, the group has started mixing, and everyone is becoming a form of friends. Pansy and Astoria are often seen together as are Daphne and Blaise, though the former is also often missing, while the latter two are never completely alone together, per decorum.
Not only the golden trio had returned, also war hero’s Seamus, Dean and Neville had returned. From Hufflepuff most notably Hannah had returned, she and Neville were in a committed relationship which helped lift both their moods in the dark nights. After all the war had stopped, but the nightmares had only started. The Slytherins were also present, Draco Malfoy had returned. Through the summer of 6th year, he had gotten the dark mark. After Harry found Draco sobbing in the bathrooms, Harry had been able to turn Draco to the good side. In the end he and his mother had been a vital spy for the order and after the war they were able to avoid a trial for their efforts. Lucius Malfoy had not been so lucky, now serving a life sentence in Azkaban.
He walked over and moved Harry’s feet from the end of the couch so he could sit, when Harry went to pull his legs under him he found himself unable. It seemed Draco had decided that Harry’s feet would be placed in Draco’s lap.
Harry frowns, they look around though. ‟Professor,” Harry says, ‟I was wondering about what kind of project I should do for the Defence apprenticeship.”
“Yes,” she said, “and what do you want to know about it?”
“Thanks, guys,” Harry said, hugging both men. Together they continued to sit in the garden until the sun slowly went under.
He actually did follow them, only now they were walking down towards the dungeons, looking back they saw Harry walking towards them. Snape pulled them into a classroom, locking the door and adding a privacy spell on it, making sure no one could hear them.
Draco nods, “tell them you’re bi, tell them you’re seeing someone. I don’t care if you tell them it’s me or not.” He shakes his head, “you will tell them it’s me in the end though.”
“And they let you in?” Ron asked incredulously.
“Hello minister,” Percy said, sanding a jinx to the man, “Did I mention I was resigning?”
I felt a bit stuck writing this chapter, so it probably sucks, but gotta keep going lmao
“What is that I hear Potter, is anyone crazy enough to be in a relationship with you,” Draco said, walking up to the group of Gryffindor’s.
“Hey,” Harry said, turning to Daphne and Draco. “I don’t think we’ve ever really spoken,” he said to Daphne. She just nodded, looking kind of shocked that they were speaking.
George gives him a smile, ‟take care Harry,” he says. Mrs Weasley gives Harry a tight hug, before giving Draco a hand. With that, the Weasley´s all leave, and Harry and his friends walk back towards Hogwarts.
‟Understatement of the year,” Harry says, pulling Draco out of the room without another glance at Lucius. ‟Come, love,” he says to Draco, ‟my back and feet are killing me.”
‟You should go to Pomfrey again,” Neville says sternly.
“The same goes for me,” Draco said, smiling at the old elf. “I’d like you to meet Harry Potter,” he said, “my husband.”
Harry groans from the sudden movement and contact. This makes them both move their mouths, they were kissing, for real this time. Draco was making small keening noises, driving Harry crazy. Slowly Harry opens his mouth, licking Draco’s lower lip. Draco opens his mouth, giving Harry entrance. Slowly the kiss gets more heated, passionate.
Slowly Slughorn moved his hand to his pocket, grabbing a flask, he touched his temple with his wand, pulling out the memory, while keeping his eyes locked on Harry’s eyes. On Lily’s eyes. He gave the memory to Harry, “Just,” Slughorn said, “don’t think too badly of me after you’ve seen this.” With those words, he turned to the table and fell asleep next to Hagrid.
“So,” Draco said, moving around the bed to sit next to Harry, their backs resting against the headboard of the bed, “Ginevra thinks you two are dating, huh.”
“What is wrong Harry,” Hermione asked.
“What’s all this commotion about?” Ron asked sitting down next to his girlfriend.
Harry hurried to the room and pushed his ear to the door, making sure that he could not be seen by the other boy.
“Could you tell us the last time the sword was taken out of the case,” Harry asked, “before Ginny stole it?”
“Who has the first kill then?” Ron said, smirking.
He said goodbye to everyone, even McGonagall. And walked over to Narcissa and Draco, Remus and Sirius having gone ahead. “We should walk to the disapparating point. Then I’ll tell you the address, and we’ll apparate to it.” He told her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In my room,” he answered, “he’s sleeping now, but he’ll come to dinner with me. He likes the smell of food, even though I don’t let him eat any.”
“Yes,” Remus said smiling, “Draco and Harry were a big help. I’ll show you two to your rooms after dinner,” he said looking at Bill and Fleur. The room fell silent again, it seemed that Sirius was done with that, he flicked his wand, putting on the wireless. Soft music entered the dining room, seeming to lift most people’s spirits.
Harry loved hearing about them, even though sometimes it made him miss them only more. Miss the fact that he had never gotten the chance to get to know them, never had the chance to figure this out with them. But he was grateful for the stories, for the fact he could at least talk to people who had known them. He wondered if he would have been raised bilingual if they had been with him. If they would have taught him their flowing language.
“Good morning Students,” said a scrawny looking man, “I am professor Twycross, I am here to instruct you all on the art of apparition. The class will be held right here. The headmaster has graciously lifted the anti-apparition wards in the great hall alone. This means that for the next hour, it is possible to apparate inside the room. Do not try to apparate out of this room, as this will hurt you tremendously and is impossible.” He scanned the group before him.
” He got a chorus of goodbyes back from the three of them. He turned to Draco who was looking at him fondly. “What?” he asked him, getting back up.
“I wanted to give him the possibility to show he had changed. Though, I did keep a close eye on him. He moved up in the school, amassing a group of, with a lack of better word, friends. It was a collection of weaker people seeking protection, powerful people seeking shared glory and thuggish people seeking a leader. They could be seen as the forerunners of the Death Eaters, a group of them becoming the official first of them.”
Harry looked around him, seeing no one around he gave Draco a quick peck on the lips, “they said they would love to come with us. Told me to tell everyone of their cute nose if that would help.” He looked back at the snake fondly, seeing them watch him and Draco. They went up in the store. “I want to ask the owner what kind of snake they are. And ask them if they could maybe hold off on selling them till next week Friday at the most.” He smiled.
With the two grooms gone the party dwindles down Harry and Draco staying until the last party goers leave. They clean the venue with a few swishes of their wands and go back to Grimmauld place with Narcissa.
“You’re still going to be a Lord,” Draco said, “if only in name because we are married.”
‟I´ve never had one before,” Draco says with a frown. ‟I don´t think I´d use it.”
People were running, centaurs fought, he even saw house-elves, led by both Dobby and Kreacher, fighting.
After a while, it seemed that the boys had decided on the art they wanted on the wall. They went back into the hallway, Sirius grabbing a few Sickles and Galleons.
“Hello Dobby,” Draco said with a small smile, it took Harry by surprise, “it is good to see you getting along fine.” This made the elf very happy, and he left with a smile on his face.
Draco and Harry walk around again, their friends walking by themselves. ‟I was thinking an off white for the wall on the ground floor,” Draco says, ‟I expect the rooms themselves will bring enough colour.”
“Do you reckon it's in there?” Ron asked.
“Ron is even better,” Harry said, “I mean he has to be after he defeated McGonagall’s Chess set in first year.”
“How long will you be able to keep this up?” Harry called over to Draco.
Wedding prep!! Can’t believe this is the second to last chapter! I watched so many explanations on jewellery to actually write this lmao
“Oh,” Draco said, “what were you thinking?”
“Well,” the man said, “I spoke to the headmaster. He wants to know where you three are, so he can give the sword, as he had discussed with the previous headmaster.”
The door opens and reveals Draco and Ginny next to each other. Harry holds back a laugh at seeing his ex and fiancé standing next to one another. Draco looks around the room his eyes immediately zeroing in on Harry. After that, his eyes travel to the Weasley matriarch.
That night, Ron, Hermione and Harry arrived at the room. When they entered, they saw Draco reading in the chair he usually sat on when the four of them met. Though his aristocratic demeanour was lost, as he was resting his feet on the table in front of him. He was so engrossed in his book that he only realised the three had come into the room when the door fell close behind them. Harry had to fight the urge to go over to him and kiss him, especially when said boy almost fell from his chair when he realised the others had arrived.
Molly and Ginny, who hadn’t warmed to Draco, were looking with more scrutiny, as they did not like Fleur either. Remus was looking between the two with rapid interest. They were ushered into the dining room, where it seemed that Kreacher had prepared a nice meal. Ever since Draco was there he had been better with the food, and with his mood in general.
“I do,” Remus said.
“C’mon,” Harry groaned, “I’m ready.” Draco didn’t wait for Harry to say that twice, removing his fingers. He moved back from Harry’s neck, Harry letting go of his hair. With one hand he held Harry’s hip, not letting him move. With the other he directed his cock, slowly pushing in.
Harry smiles, ‟I´m good,” he says, ‟exhausted, but energised at the same time.”
They moved on the music, though neither realized. They were not circling each other, but moving as one, intertwined. When one moved forward, the other moved back. When one stepped sideways so did the other. When one moved back, the other moved forward. Most of it was in the beat of the music.
Slowly February turned into March, and Ron’s birthday came up. The trip to Hogsmeade had been cancelled and Ron had been in a sullen mood because of it. Hoping to cheer him up, Harry handed over the gift he had gotten him and a box of chocolate cauldrons that he found in his bag, “Happy Birthday, Ron,” Harry said. Ron eagerly opened the gift, seeing the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves.
In the end, he bought a modest terrarium, not wanting to bother taking one that was too big for now. There was a warming spell in it, so he could stay warm in the cold evenings. He bought some decorations. He got some food from the vendor for free.
“Every time they say stuff like that,” dean mock whispered to Seamus, “and all I can think is, what the actual fuck were those three did. Travelling through the whole English countryside?” The three of them just shrugged, not answering anything about it.
Harry looked lost, not knowing the answer. He opened his mouth, as if to talk, but shut it again, looking frustrated.
“I know,” Harry whispered, “thanks.” His voice was croaky from disuse. It seemed that it was easier for Harry to speak in Parsletongue now, as that was the only thing he said to Ron. He felt Harry shiver slightly, so he put up a warming charm. Harry smiled, thankful for that. His snake was happy too, as Darsh appeared after that.
The first days after the war went by slowly. People were arrested, others left the country, going into hiding. Every day more information would come out, more people were found dead, having either been killed in the last battle or having been killed before. Those who had not been captured were wanted for arrest.
“Even though I’m with Draco?” He knew that his father, who was raised in the magical world would care less that he was with a man, but he didn’t know what Lilly would think. He didn’t know what they would think of Draco, with his Dark Mark and all.
He stills, as does Hary, ‟you don´t think I could be?” Draco asks, wide-eyed.
And harry did, he told Draco about Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Molly and all other people that are usually around Grimmauld place. Draco listened intently. Harry did not speak for long, but he told about the things they did as far as he knew it.
“Darling,” Ginny grinned, walking to Harry as if to kiss him.
Harry nodded, “and we don’t even really know what the estate is and how much money it really is. The only thing we know is, that when we do the reveal ceremony, my family will be added to his. Our estates will become the estates of the Malfoy family,  our contracts will become theirs and our family money will become Malfoy money.”
“I have some,” Harry said, getting attention on him, “scars.”  He didn’t like attention, but he knew that Draco didn’t either, and it was his turn either way. Attention from his friends wasn’t bad anyway.
Harry nods, ‟Yeah, that´ll work.” He pauses, ‟that one the office” he points to the room that looks out on the garden, ‟and the other guest bedroom?” he asks.
‟I wonder if it´s going to be a Slytherin or a Gryffindor,” Pansy says.
Harry ignored the rest of the people in the carriage, all still looking at Harry in favour of turning to Draco. It was hard, as he was in his lap, and they were squished between Luna and Hermione, but Harry managed. He looked into Draco’s eyes, “I’m okay,” he said, he felt his friends' eyes on them, but didn’t focus on it. He cupped Draco’s cheek, “you saved me,” he said, “you won’t ever feel that again.”
“They say they’ve caught Potter,” Narcissa said, her voice cold, “tell us, my son is this him?”
When both Harry and Draco were finished with their list, they crawled under their blanket. Harry made sure to show Draco just how alive they both were, before the two of them fell into a peaceful slumber.
“Right,” Harry said, “I forgot I also had a personal vault.” He paused, looking at the numbers again, “are these numbers including that vault?” Draco nodded his head. “Wow.” He closed it again, he wasn’t sure what to think of it. It wasn’t like he was very interested in money, but to know that he would always be comfortable as would his children, was a nice thought.
Harry nods, ‟can we talk? Somewhere private?” he asks looking around. He sees Draco walking into the common room. His emotions are hidden behind his mask.
The hospital wing fell silent when Harry walked in, Hermione ran up to Harry, “are you all right?” she asked, hugging him, Remus walked forward, Sirius was there, in dog form. Harry nodded, hugging Remus.
It´s a lot of work, a baby. Harry and Draco both knew that, but there´s a very big difference between knowing it and actually having the kid. They´ve told their friends and family all about the birth but also asked them to not visit yet.
“We were sent to help,” George said, “apparently mum wants this done even more quickly than usual.” They all nodded and went to work. With the seven of them, the garden was soon free of Gnomes. After that, they were tasked with pitching the tent and arranging the table.
“And you knew this then because?”
Draco had talked, it was a bad summer for him. After getting the mark he had to stay close to his mother and the dark lord. He had seen things that he could not unsee. When he admitted that he too could now see the thestrals Harry saw tears falling from Draco’s eyes.
“That means you passed all your classes!” Draco said excitedly, “you can officially become Remus’ apprentice!” Harry nodded, looking up to Sirius and Remus at the tables. They were both looking at him, and even though they looked nervous they also seemed confident in Harry.
‟Harry looks good for someone who gave birth not four weeks ago,” Leo says when they both look at Draco´s friends mingling with Jennifer and Theo.
“If that is the case,” Harry asked, “should it matter if he has life in Azkaban or not? The outcome is the same. A man that does not approve of your life. You can still see him, you can visit him, and you can talk to him if you want. The only difference is that he isn’t free to leave, and you are.”
Draco shook his head, “no, there won’t be much time. I think I’m close to finding out a way to make the cabinet work, but I’ll try to work a bit slower. We need to time it right, but I can’t wait too much longer.” He looked around in his back, “I got a note saying that, if I didn’t find a way at the end of this month, they’ll torture my mother,” he looked up with tears in his eyes.
With the help of the book, Harry was once again the best of the class. He had even added some extra peppermint, which helped counter the side effects, which made Slughorn exceptionally proud. Hermione was suspicious, but she knew he and Ginny had gotten rid of the book, so he knew she couldn’t really say anything.
He put it against his lip, seeing the words again. He knew this was where Dumbledore meant. This is when. “I’m about to die,” he whispered. The words loud in his head. The snitched opened, and he saw the stone, the broken stone lying inside. Faintly he thought that he only needed one more object to be the conqueror of death. Not that it mattered, as he was about to meet his death.
He felt something hard in his knee, and when he looked down he saw it was the locket. He picked it up, it had opened up when it fell, when he picked it up he knew something was wrong. When he looked at it, he realised that the locket looked nothing like the real one, nothing like the locket that he had seen in the pensive, no ornate S, no green, nothing. When he looked inside he saw a note, he opened it and read. Someone had taken the Horcrux, someone out there, going by the RAB initials had found Riddle’s secret, and had stolen the real one. Harry felt dread right till his bones. They didn’t get the third Horcrux. It’s not real.
The results came that Friday. The large school owls swept down to all the eight years and seventh years, simultaneously dropping their letters. Harry took a deep breath before opening his letter.
Draco nods, ‟it would be easier though since you want to become the defence professor.”
“I was planning on doing it during our Christmas break,” Harry said. “I was planning on looking at the properties as well. Try and, I don’t know, see how they lived.”
“Neville and Luna already know,” Harry points out, “as do Hermione and Ron. They all know what a war is like, they know about sacrifice and the need to protect. They are still your friends. You will tell your story in that courtroom, not only the plan of the death eaters but also the plan of the order. They will see that you and I worked together and that you only did what you had to do.”
“Yeah,” Draco answered, “she’s stronger than she looks.” He looked at the door his mother just left through, “let’s tell Ron and Hermione.” Harry nodded, they used the floo, asking Molly if Ron and Hermione were available now. Seconds later Harry and Draco were standing in the Burrow.
The night ended all too quickly, all eight years buzzed and happy, jumping around. When they got back to the common room, they continued, the drinks out and music loud. They danced around, singing with each other. Daphne and Ernie even joined, even though they were less tipsy than the others. Ginny and Luna had joined them, dancing around with the group.
“Well,” Molly said, “I accept your apologies, but that doesn’t make any of it okay.” She said sternly, “you have a lot to show before any of us trust you entirely.” With that, she walked away. Harry walked over to the boy, hugging him.
“Okay, but how will I know whatever this person says is the truth,” he repeated, looking intently at Harry. The latter boy was looking back with a blank face, he didn’t know what to say. Malfoy seemed to realise that Harry had no idea what to say, as he sighed and sat back into the chair. “Maybe you should’ve stolen some veritaserum, as we both know you are good at stealing things.”
“Tattoos are a bit permanent right now,” Harry said, “but you do have something with the nail polish.” Draco looked at Harry, nodding.
“Thank Draco, he remembered to buy some.”
‟That is a workroom,” she says, ‟I used to do some experiments there. It has thickened walls and all that.” She comes to stand next to Harry, Draco joining them. She turns her back to the garden, looking into the room. ‟So, what do you think?”
Draco kept his arm around Harry, walking slowly. They walked in silence, but it was comfortable. When they arrived in the kitchens, there were only a few elves working. They came to them immediately, asking what they could do for him.
“Very well,” Dumbledore said, standing, “We will arrange for a meeting between Mister Malfoy and Professor Snape tomorrow night.” He walked over to the door, opening it for Harry. “Think about a way that you can convince Mister Malfoy we really are on our side.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perfect,” Harry said through gritted teeth, “could we speak later?” he whispered into Ginny’s ear, who nodded. “I’ve got a free period after Herbology, you free then?” he asked. She nodded again. “I’ll meet you at the lake?”
Harry shrugged, “maybe,” he looked out of the carriage to the hallway, “do you guys really think I would be a good teacher?” They nodded vigorously.
‟Saturday,” Narcissa confirms, ‟have fun boys,” Lucius grunts his goodbye next to his wife.
“It should be a pureblood teaching it, though,” Draco said, “you won’t be able to find someone who knows everything when they haven’t grown up with it.”
“What’s on that side?” Harry asked, pointing to the opposite wing.
The group remained silent when they walked into the courtroom. Everyone sat close to each other, taking two rows on the pews to spread out. Harry had Hermione and Ron next to him, while Draco sat next to his mother and McGonagall. In front of them The others spread out, Neville and Hannah sitting in the middle, with Luna and Ginny next to Neville and Seamus and Dean next to Hannah.
‟Yeah, thanks, but we´ll do this alone,” Draco says when Pansy and Ron start discussing turning Scorpius´ room red or green.
“Well, you already helped me remember I’m gay.” He says, “something my friends apparently didn’t know.”
They talk some more, his friends asking Harry how they got together. He tells the story with a smile on his face, and when they leave the room, he feels semi-relaxed.
Only when he heard Harry grumble impatiently, did Draco start to move, slowly pulling back and thrusting in slowly. Harry met him halfway. Pushing back every time Draco pushed forward. It wasn’t long before they had established a fast pace. Draco’s cock sliding in and out of Harry smoothly, moving over his prostate almost constantly. It wasn’t long before Draco was close to his release. He moved his hand around Harry, only to find Harry’s hand already moving frantically. His thrust grew sloppier the closer he came. But he held off, wanting Harry to come before him. It wasn’t long that he had to wait, Harry moaning Draco’s name into the pillow while finding his release. The muscles tensing around Draco was enough, bowing forward, and moaning Harry’s name next to his ear. Both boys collapsed, Draco pulling off the condom. He walked over to the bathroom, dropping the condom in the bin, and grabbing a cloth, using it to clean Harry, and to wipe the bed clean. The boys moved under the blanket and fell asleep holding each other.
“Well, he was right,” he grabbed the tiara of the bust. “This is the last Horcrux, only Nagini after this.” He raised his voice, “Ron, Hermione, over here.” The latter two came running over. Hermione skidded to a stop when she saw Draco. She looked around them seeing the Crabbe and Goyle lying on the floor.
Draco nods, ‟yes Harry, yes,” he says, pulling Harry into a kiss.
‟Are you kidding?” Pansy asks, ‟I´m going to spoil my godson rotten.” She tackles Draco in a hug, giving Harry a kiss on his cheek afterwards. ‟Colours though, tell me.” She pauses, ‟no wait, why choose if you can just buy both.” Her eyes light up.
Also, can yall notice me giving Harry a bit of an eboy look, I honestly am not ashamed of it lmoa
He told Harry about how Voldemort had decided to turn his home, the home that he had loved when he was a kid, into the central point for all Death Eaters. How Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan and Fenrir were staying there. He told Harry how he had been asked to come to the main room, where everyone was seated, and how Voldemort had asked him to roll up his sleeve in front of everyone. How he gave him the dark mark.
He saw Hermione and Ron practice the spells, talking softly, but never opening a conversation with Harry. Draco was doing the same, practising as Sirius had asked. He looked over at Harry, surprised to see him do the same. Though, he saw that the boy’s mouth wasn’t moving.
“I’m glad,” Harry said, “I never meant to hurt her. Hell, I didn’t want to tell you guys like that, just had a bad night, and I was done with her acting like I was her boyfriend.”
“This was my room until I moved out,” Sirius said. “I didn’t want to impose on them, so as soon as I had the money, I bought my own place in London. They kept it empty though, for whenever Moony and I would visit. This one,” he said, pointing at the door beside Sirius’, “used to be where Peter slept if he visited as well.”
“That’s great,” Draco said, “I mean I still can’t look that man in the eyes,” Harry snickered agreeing, “but he will be a great minister. He can probably help go against the corruption going on in there.”
The three of them slumped down, “they’re safe, they’re okay,” he said. The pain in his scar hadn’t succumbed, though now not only was it his scar, but also something in the back of his mind. Though the pain was not anger, this pain was more agony. “Bathroom,” he said, walking as slowly as he could without warning them. The moment he went into the bathroom he collapsed.
“No, I should have yelled too,” Ron whispered back, still looking frustrated and sad. “I just couldn’t find my voice.”
Draco chuckled and stepped up to Harry, lust in both their eyes. Draco reached out and combed his hands through Harry’s fur, earning a soft moan from his omega. “So soft,” he breathed, “so innocent.” He leaned down, instinct taking over both of them, and their lips met. Harry moved away slightly only for Draco to move forward, his hand wrapping around the back of Harry’s head and pulling him closer.
“Harry, what electives are you taking?” Theo asked.
Full Moon
“Sirius, honestly,” Uncle Remus sighed. “Anyway, can we take it that you’ll be attending Harry’s Dark Initiation with the rest of the coven?”
“Lucifer!”
“You’re—you’re an Alpha,” Ron repeated. He fell back to his chair and turned to look at Harry. “Harry, Hermione is an Alpha,” he sounded so defeated.
“What are you doing?” Mr. Riddle demanded. “This is outrageous—”
Mrs. Lestrange was satisfied. Taking a step back she looked around her classroom, at the satanic and demonic language she has written over every wall, every floorboard, and every inch of the ceiling of her classroom. Humming to herself, she gave a small dancing gig before letting out a victorious laugh. “Ha! Now it doesn’t matter if a demon kills that femboy, I’ll just do it myself and give the Dark Lord an offering that will surely give me favor.”
“You know, I’ve lived here most of my life,” Harry said. “Grew up a bit north in Westchester, went to this awful all-boys private school for high school, before coming down for Hogwarts. I’ll admit that this isn’t the best pizza in the city, but it’s still pretty damn good, and better yet it’s New York Pizza! It’s so good with—”
“Okay that’s it,” Blaise interrupted, pushing through Draco and Harry, his hand moving face for Parkinson’s throat. “I think you should learn to hold your mouth, dog,” he said darkly, his brown eyes slowly shifting to black. His hand around her throat started to spark threateningly. “So I I’ll take away that annoying bark of yours for a bit until you learn your lesson.”
Harry took a breath and started his story which he planned out throughout the day. “The Potters aren’t my real parents, they raised me for a year, yeah, however, I’m not their biological son. My real birth mother, if you will, was an Omega named Adrian, and he had a husband named Tom. They named me Harrison; however I wish for you guys to just keep calling me Harry, only my dad can call me Harrison. My birth dad, Adrian, died in childbirth leaving just Tom and me. However, it was only a month later when two people broke into our home and kidnapped me. My father, Tom, was never the strongest support or ally of Dumbledore. They had a whole different view on Magic, and how to deal with the Dark Arts. At this time, my father was working on a manuscript, a book that blends together both Light and Dark Magic. I have it in my trunk if you want proof. My father believes, and so do I, that it was Dumbledore who ordered my kidnapping because of their differing views.
“N-No Harry, I didn’t,” Draco said, the Alpha looking shocked and worried. “Please, believe me, I didn’t know.” Just as he spoke, his owl flew towards Draco, dropping a letter. He stared at it for a moment and picked it up. “It’s from my father,” he said.
“We’ll be right behind you,” Harry said, “there’s something I need to talk with Draco about privately.”
“What?” he said shortly.
“Harry? Are you alright?” Hermione asked, “Are you crying?”
“To stop you from marrying my dad,” Blaise said, “It’s so fucking obvious—marry me—and Draco—both of us! Become our wife!”
“No!—I mean, no, none of that,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly. “I don’t feel any draw…”
while others were huddled together, making crude reenactments of what clearly was Harry being struck by the Bludger. “Draco!”
“Yes, Miss?”
“I understand,” Uncle Remus nodded. “However…” he placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders and smiled softly, speaking in an equally soft tone, “whatever happens, you’re welcomed here. The month or so Harry has known you, he has grown so much more open. You might not see it now, but you’re a good influence on him, right Sirius?”
He frowned in thought. The only towers he saw were attached to the main central castle-like building, and he had a sneaking idea that they would not put that much effort into dormitories. So he was left to wander, taking in the beauty of the campus as he did so, straining his eyes to look for any signs or big flags that would point out where Gryffindor Tower is.
“Yeah,” Draco muttered.
“I—no,” Harry said quickly. “I just thought it would be better if we buried the hatchet and make up—”
Still no sign. Did they get lost? Did they get escorted privately? Who do they think they are making the world wait like this? There! Do you see? No those were just black-haired children.
Draco answered.
“Of course,” Voldemort nodded. “Harry, I will be getting you a few… special outfits and suits. For formal wear. You and Draco just focus on more casual wear.”
“Anyway,” Draco said, “I rather not talk about that, it’s nothing.”
The wand spun in his hand before pointing upwards and towards the left. Smiling to himself, the boy quickly moved to the steps, leaving the basement and following his wand. The basement steps led to the kitchen, which was full of house-elves moving quickly, dressed in nothing but a sack with the Malfoy emblem. Harry ignored them and moved through the kitchen, always following the direction his wand pointed as he moved through empty room after empty room, lucky to never run into anyone else, until he found a skinny curved staircase, which he climbed to only come to a terrace where Harry saw Draco Malfoy sitting with another boy at a simple table outside.  It looked as though they were talking, and Harry stopped, at a lost on how to approach them.
“Which reminds me actually… I just got a very interesting letter from my father, Harry,” Draco said, “when exactly did you have the opportunity to tell him about us?”
“His forgiveness? That’s going to take a long time,” Niall chuckled. “One time I made Harry mad, and he wouldn’t talk to me for a week. But you’re cute. I’m sure if you actually learn to be suave like you pretend to be, you won’t be in the doghouse for too long. I would say just give him a treat, like his favorite dessert or something soothing after detention. Stay up and wait for him—but do not lose your cool if he blows you off.”
“With the disaster of the Yule Ball behind us, the second task was drawing nearer and nearer. You’ve helped me there, Cedric, with the bath, that’s where we both learned the mystery of that damn egg… and led to the Second Task. I was scared that they would take Draco and my secret love would be broadcasted to the world, but thankfully they took Ron instead… however Hermione was down there too. That’s why I was the last one there, I wanted to save them all. Anyway, I thought that after the second trial, I would get Draco’s attention, that I could somehow manipulate ways to get him to notice me positively… I was wrong. Skeeter’s article about my ‘Secret Love’ came out after that, and it was all bullocks. I’m not straight, yet I was too scared to admit it… you’re actually the third person I’ve told Cedric. Not even Hermione or Ron knows. They should, they’re my best friends I should tell them… I had the opportunity yet I… never mind, I’m getting sidetracked.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye.” He looked towards the redheaded omega. “But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell, so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.
“Of course,” Ron said. Draco gave a yawn, muttered a sorry, and by the time they reached a small booth by a window, he already drank half of his Red Eye drink. “You really need that much caffeine?” Ron asked.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you,” Harry said quickly. “It’s just that, well, you’re more knowledgeable than me or Draco combined, so…”
“By pure luck, it would seem,” Mr. Riddle said. “It was an open secret that Harrison is a Parseltongue. How this is possible, I cannot say, perhaps it is an aftereffect of his unfortunate encounter with Lord Voldemort,”—everyone except Harry and Dumbledore flinched at the name. Remus frowned and looked down at the table— “Needless to say, he simply followed my pet snake one day and found his way home.”
“Good,” Voldemort said. He watched the house burned and smiled. “By any chance, does your wife have petunias in her garden?”
“I can imagine,” Draco said, joining Harry on the bed. “Dementors everywhere, along with my Aunt…”
“Not that, Dumbledore!” Ron said.
“This, I believe, is one of the many creatures that took our young Harry,” Dumbledore said, out of breath.
he thought to himself.
“I could hardly let him get away with everything he caused. It might have worked out well in the end, because now my son can be happy.” She looked at Draco, her eyes warm, “but that does not negate what he caused.” She touched Draco’s shoulder, the boy looking up to her with warm eyes.
“Well, when did it happen?” Ron asked, being more mature about it than Harry expected him to be. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like you two together, but if you two kissed, why is she now out there kissing Dean Thomas?” He looked back towards the couple, looking disgusted.
Draco frowns, ‟the master bedroom is on the top floor though.” He pauses, ‟you want to be close to him,” he says after a second.
Draco and Harry both went up to Remus’ desk. Remus waited till everyone was out of the room and he closed the door. “I’m guessing you two aren’t telling anyone about the marriage bond?” he asked.
He tried to find any way to meet the other boy alone, but he was always either accompanied by Ron and Hermione or by Ginny, who had suddenly developed the habit of following the trio everywhere. It annoyed Harry a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
After Draco came Ernie, but Harry did not pay attention. He was too nervous. His name was called not long after. “Harry,” she said to him, putting a hand on his shoulder briefly, “you surprise me every year again. Your daring, your stubbornness, your perseverance. But most of all your love. Even in the middle of a war, one with a man that had fixated himself upon you, you manage to find love. You manage to rescue not only your friends but those that had actively tried to harm you.” She paused, squeezing the hand on his shoulder before letting go. “You too will come back in two years,” she said, “continuing that what you started in your fifth year. The education of your people, of the students of Hogwarts, in the art of Defense against the dark arts.” She smiled, “I can not wait till you and I are working side by side, as peers.” Harry thanked her, and without thinking about it he pulled her in a hug, one that surprised her if her gasp was any indication.
‟We could,” Draco says, ‟I have to go to Malfoy manor for my stuff. If we go by train on Sunday we can stay there, pack my stuff and go to London to buy some more things for the house and swing by Grimmauld.”
“Well, I saw this cute hognose snake in Hogsmeade, and I was thinking of adopting it? But I want to ask the others before I do, because, some people have very bad memories about snakes, for obvious reasons.”
“And what, become a teacher as well?” Draco asked.
When he was let go, Remus pulled him into a second hug, “Happy birthday.”
“Uh,” Draco said, blushing a bit, “I think they think I’m out shagging?” He said mumbling softly.
Harry grabbed his stuff, giving it to Hermione. She would put everything in her bag. “I’ll just tell them that we won't be coming back,” Harry said, “They should know.” Hermione and Ron nodded.
“You stole them?” Ron asked, his tone impressed.
“Well,” Harry rubbed his hands to the back of his neck, it calmed him down, “she kissed me when we were hiding the book of the Prince.”
‟You are?” she says, Harry and Draco both nod, ‟oh Harry, that really something isn´t it. Are you happy about it?”
‟What are you going to do?” Ron asks gruffly.
“You heard the headmaster,” Sirius said, “home we go.” He turned to Hermione and Ron, “you’ll be staying at the Burrow with the rest I presume?” they nodded, “Good.” The two gave Harry a hug, a curt nod to Draco and walked away to the Weasleys. Sirius turned to Narcissa. “Would you like to come with us?” he asked, shocking her. “We live in my parent’s house, though it resembles very little of it. You are welcome to stay.”
“Well, I thought, we ask Snape to speak with him. It will be a tricky situation, because Malfoy might think that Snape is a spy for Voldemort, but I am sure there will be ways to make him accept what we say.”
Amelia Bones walked into the courtroom, causing the whole room to fall silent. “We are here today for the disciplinary hearing of Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Fenrir Greyback and Thorfinn Rowle. They have all been accused of plotting and abetting in the murder of Albus Dumbledore. Amycus and Alecto Carrow are accused of the use of unforgivables on underage students and making other people use them. Fenrir Greyback is also accused of the slaughter of Lavender Brown, the attack of muggle-born and halfblood wixen through the groups known as snatchers, the attempted kidnapping of Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas, Harry Potter and the late goblin known as Griphook and the leading of what is known as the Werewolf Army.”
“We will keep you informed.” She said, turning away.
“We still need a way to open it though,” Ron said. “And, how are we going to get the sword? It’s not like Snape is going to leave the school with it, and we can’t go to the school.”
It´s foolish to think they won't accept him. No one cares Seamus and Dean are dating. They won´t care that he´s bi. Sure, when he and Draco got together he wasn´t sure. The wounds were fresh, Ron blamed anyone even close to Voldemort´s side for Fred´s death. They didn´t like Draco, let alone loved him as Harry does.
Draco nodded, “then I want it indeed.” He looked around, “I think all the supplies that are left that are not specially catered to father would be nice to take as well.”
“Was he after the Defence Against the Dark Arts job?” Harry asked, “he never explicitly said so.”
“Me too,” Harry sighed, not once faltering on his pace he bent over once again whispering into Draco’s ear, “come for me baby,” he whispered. He only had to say it before Draco was calling out his name, coming. Harry followed seconds later, streaking their stomachs. Harry rode out his orgasm, leaning on Draco.
“It’s early in this house,” Harry muttered, “I don’t even think anyone is awake yet.” He noticed that in their sleep the two boys had become entangled, Harry’s arms around Draco’s waist, he held the boy stronger, making sure he couldn’t move. “Don’t go yet,” Harry whispered, “I want to cuddle.”
“With the trial now past us, I think it is time to start on the sell of the manor,” she said, watching Draco. “But, before we can do that, we need to clean it out. There are a lot of things there, that don’t deserve to be thrown away, and a lot that does. Your art supplies are all still there, as are mine. The family artefacts that aren’t of dark magic.” She paused, “I know we both would rather not go back there, but we have to if we want to sell it.”
It all goes fast after. He and Harry are put in a room. Harry changes into a hospital gown and a screen is placed around his midriff. Draco is told to stand by Harry´s head. And two nurses walk in. Harry´s lower half goes numb with a wave of the wand and the operation begins. It´s done in under twenty minutes, his magical placenta and stomach sutured together magically.
“Thanks, Draco, that’s really nice of you.” Harry said, putting the book in his bag. He looked up at Draco, both boys were sitting cross-legged facing each other. “I know we didn’t really talk about, ya know the spy thing, last night, but we should,” Harry said softly. “It’s kind of the point of us meeting in secret every night.”
Draco hummed, “so, ask her,” he said shrugging his shoulders, “You haven’t written your weekly letter yet, ask her in that one.”
Harry’s hands were roaming along Draco’s body, nails scraping his back lightly. Draco’s hand were trailing down Harry’s sides, the lower they came, the wider Harry opened his legs for Draco. Draco moved away from Harry, causing Harry to whine. Draco chuckled grabbing one of their wands from the floor. Moving back between Harry’s thighs. He grabbed a pillow, “up,” he ordered, Harry lifting his hips instantly. Draco moved the pillow beneath him.
“Well,” Harry started, sitting down, “Draco and I just came back from Hogsmeade, and we went into this little pet shop, and there I saw something I wanted to buy, but I wanted to run it past you guys first, especially since we still live with you two.”
“Great, the ones from France are the best,” he said, looking wistfully into the fire, “maybe I’ll even share with you.”
When he wakes up, he finds Draco sleeping deeply next to him. He can´t lie on top of Harry anymore, but he´s half draped over him, their legs tangled and his head on Harry´s shoulder. It´s very late at night, and he wishes he could just turn around and close his eyes again. But he can´t, instead, he extracts himself from Draco´s octopus hold and goes off to the bathroom.
“What did you see,” Ron asked, “was he in my home?”
‟I,” Harry trails off. He grabs the mug, it almost burns his fingers with the warmth. He blows the steam away.
“Heir Potter,” he said, bowing, “it is good to meet the man that captured my master's heart.” Draco looked shocked at that statement, which caused the elf to laugh. “Yes young master, I realized you were bonded the moment you stepped back into this home that night. Your magical signature had changed. Do not worry, only a personal elf would be able to tell.” Draco nodded. “Is it your elf that is removing the books in the library?” Lucien asked Harry. Who nodded in response. “She told me the address of the manor you are moving into,” he said, “do you wish to move all your belonging there, young master?”
“You arrange marriages?” Hermione asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry,” Draco said softly, “I thought you knew. Is it bad?” he said cringing.
‟I wanted to name my son James,” Harry says.
Harry realised he felt the magic in Draco slow down. The reaction time was slower, the strength of the spells decreased. He felt his own doing the same, but not as much as Draco’s. It was only a few seconds longer, and Harry cast over a patrificus totalus, and he felt that his spell was stronger than any of Draco’s shield, and he was right. The spell pierced Draco’s shield, letting him fall down. Harry caught him before he hid the floor, having moved forward knowing the spell would hit.
“Sure,” the shopkeeper said, “Have a great day.”
“Well, it was great meeting another family member!” she walked out of the room, “nice meeting you Draco!”
“Oh,” Ron said, “that’s nice.” They stayed silent for a second. “Where do you want to go?” he asked.
Seamus and Dean walk with Harry and Draco to Hogsmeade Saturday. It turns out that that day was when they had dates. They said goodbye in front of the three broomsticks. Draco pulls Harry to the clothing shop down the street.
“Would they know when another is in mortal danger?” Harry asked, Draco nodded in response. “would they die if the other dies?” Draco shook his head.
“Now that that is known, I feel that there is no more time to explain the situation, as most of you need to go back to work.” Dumbledore looked over to Sirius and Remus, “I think I should like to speak to the house owners before we depart back to Hogwarts.” With that the room slowly became empty, some people passed Draco, shaking his hand and thanking him for helping them. Tonks stayed behind to be able to talk to Draco alone for a second.
“So,” Seamus said, “how was your time at the snake house?” he wiggled his eyebrows for good measure.
Draco shrugs, ‟you looked so peaceful sleeping,” he says, ‟and I love you.” He smiles sitting next to Harry, ‟do I need a reason?”
Harry moved along, Grayback tried to attack him, but Harry stunned him too, moving along. He had to follow Draco and Snape, he had to. No one could know, but they all would know he was there. He came down the stairs, he couldn’t not go after them.
“Yeah,” Harry said, “technically you guys are joining her. She lives here when she isn’t in France.”
‟Of course not,” Blaise says, ‟we are courting. Most people,” he says with a pointed look to Draco, ‟do that before proposing to be married. Or diving into bed with their future spouse.”
‟The ministry told me that you were tasked with community service,” Leo explains, ‟They wanted you to learn how to deal with muggles, but well, they weren´t sure how well you´d be at hiding.” He pauses, ‟they wanted someone there who could understand if you did something shifty. I didn´t tell you, even when you knew you were chill because I am basically a muggle. I can´t do magic, and that´s okay. My life is with muggles, I live like a muggle, except for when I´m with family.”
“Does that mean, that if I did magic at home, no one would be able to prove it was me?” Ron asked.
“Hey,” Harry said cupping Draco’s cheek to make him look him in the eyes, “that’s not on you. You didn’t do anything but find a way to survive. And even then, all was done under the orders of Dumbledore, he wanted it to happen like that. They’ll forgive you because they know that you aren’t a bad person. I don’t think they’ll be mad,” he adds hastily, “they don’t have a reason to be.”
“I just have to say goodbye to the Weasleys, and some of the DA” Harry said, “they’ll kill me if I don’t.” The others nodded in understanding. He moved around the hall, hugging everyone he knew would despise him if he didn’t. When he came to the Weasley’s they hugged him tearily.
Draco chuckled, “well, when has your life ever made sense.” Harry shrugged. “This scroll is about your vault,” he said, pointing at another scroll.
The two boys nodded, Ginny, Luna and Neville nodding along. “It was Dumbledore,” he said, looking at all their faces to gauge their reaction. He saw only bewilderment, and confusion in their faces.
“Indeed. It is important to find out what Slughorn told Riddle, as this might show what he has done with the objects. However, I can not ask him, as this is the only thing I have managed to get. Therefore I ask you to try and persuade him to give you the real memory.”
There´s a knock on the door. ‟Yes?” Draco asks, and the door opens to show Narcissa with a serene smile. ‟Mother,” Draco says, ‟We just finished cleaning out my room.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “
He told him about his hunt, what they did exactly. He told how Snape helped him to get the sword, told him how the Horcrux in him knew that it would be able to kill it. Almost drowning Harry in the process. Draco jumped into that, telling how he had woken up in the middle of the night, realising Harry was drowning. How he pulled all his energy to Harry, giving him the energy he could.  Hermione talked about the torture under Bellatrix. Draco telling about how he and his mum made sure that no one else but Bellatrix was there, so the trio and their friends could escape.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, voice concerned. Draco looked at Harry, the mask he had been wearing falling off his face, Harry could see the hurt there. Draco shook his head in response. “I thought so,” Harry whispered, walking towards the blond. “I saw what happened after Rowle didn’t manage to catch me.” Draco’s face contorted in pain.
Draco chuckled, “it paints a good picture indeed.” Draco moved, his head lying in Harry’s lap, feet stretched out. “You don’t have to decide immediately,” Harry nodded, “but if you think it is something you would want, you should maybe write to McGonagall. She could tell you if you really need the NEWT for History or if just and OWL is enough.”
Harry did as the letter read, and after a week of Harry telling them how dangerous it was to stay, they decided that leaving was the best option. They would be taken into a protective detail of the Order. They would be taken to the safe house a few minutes before Harry would be taken to Grimmauld place.
“I think your husband’s got it,” she said, turning to Draco, “I suggest you buy him something green, it makes his eyes look great.” Draco nodded in agreement.
Hermione nodded, laughing lightly, “god, I was scared for a second when that happened, because I had no idea what was going on,” she said. “We hadn’t even realized that Christmas had come and gone.”
“Yeah,” Draco answered, “love you,” he said, kissing Harry’s neck lightly. Harry parroted him and it didn’t take long before the two boys were fast asleep.
“Are you going to keep that name?” Neville asked, “you’ll both be Malfoy’s after the wedding, so wouldn’t it be strange to call your manor after the Potter family?”
‟I can´t believe the dream really came true,” he says with a laugh. Draco smiles nuzzling Harry´s neck. ‟I love you Draco.”
‟You really thought this through, haven´t ya,” Seamus says with a laugh. ‟Scorpius James Malfoy-Potter, quite a mouth full”
“You can’t let that happen, Harry,” Hermione said, “you need to use Occlumency, Dumbledore wanted you to!”
“Yeah,” Sirius grinned, “never let any of us read what he wrote in there. Though, I imagine it was mostly bad written prose about Lilly.” He chuckled, “did he say where he left them?”
“We love you.” They both said. Together they stood, walking towards the hall. He saw people coming out and felt the cloak being thrown over himself. He walked as if he was on autopilot. At the edge of the Forbidden Forest, he looked back. The last time he would see that school, his first home. Apparently his only home. He thought of Draco. Of Sirius and Remus.
“At least I wasn’t the one that followed the other into the bathroom,” Draco said defiantly. Harry just laughed.
“I don’t know if I can do that,” Harry said, looking at Draco. They had both just read the letter. “I don’t know if I can speak to all those people. What do I even say?”
Around pudding, Neville catches Harry attention again, ‟I heard you weren´t feeling well today,” he says.
“Are you really okay?” Hermione asked, taking a seat on his bed.
Narcissa smiled, “that is a great idea,” she said, “maybe we could get another cabinet for my paint.” Pihu nodded, looking at Draco who nodded, letting Pihu know he wanted that too. Seconds later a similar cabinet stood next to Draco’s.
‟If he doesn´t like it he can always change it later,” Harry says with a shrug, ‟it´s his life, if he wants to be called Alex or something that´s cool too.”
“He stole Morfin’s wand, killed the Muggles, and brought the wand back, taking the ring with him.” Harry opened his mouth, but Dumbledore continued, “we need to move to the next memory,”
“Still your own fault,” Harry shrugged, “Buckbeak is a sweety.”
“My day was good, I hope yours was as well.” She said, though she didn’t wait for an answer, “were you going to study?” she asked.
“It is not yours, missus, it’s mine, I found it.” The snatcher said. It was a mistake that he said that, seconds later the snatcher with the sword dropped, having been hit with a red light. The others screamed in outrage, but they were all dropping one by one. Draco pointed his wand at Greyback, making sure he didn’t do anything stupid.
As Harry had suspected, Dobby came up towards the two boys in no time, “Harry Potter,” he said, “Dobby is glad to see you,” he turned towards Draco, “and Master Draco, Dobby is glad to see you too.” Harry had not expected that, he knew Dobby’s tough relationship with the Malfoy family.
Draco was very hard, his cock high in the air, not even lying on his stomach. Harry moved forward, kissing the tip. Draco’s hips bucked, Harry moved back instantly, eliciting another delicious whine from Draco. Harry chuckled, “I said no moving,” he said with a low voice “every time you move I’m going to stop, understand?” Draco nodded, “I need to hear you, love.”
Draco stares up at Harry. ‟You really believe that don´t you?”
“She’s in the kitchen with Sirius and Remus,” Draco offered. Charlie nodded turning to walk towards the kitchen.
Draco nods, he scans the rest. ‟We just have to state how much who is going to pay, since it´s a combined contract. Not that it matters a lot since it´ll all be combined when we get married.”
Draco snorts, ‟and you say I´m the dramatic one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry broke the kiss off, looking into the stormy grey eyes addled with lust. His green eyes, now mostly black with his dilated pupils, staring back. He only nodded, signalling his lover that he was ready. Draco picked up his wand again, adding more lube and adding a protection spell. He looked back again, making sure, and Harry once again nodded.
“So,” Ron asked, “what if that was the actual reason Dumbledore showed it to you?” Hermione and Draco looked at him, “look, if Dumbledore wanted to tell you that his parents were bigots, well he could’ve just shown you that, but now, you know how that ring looks like, and that other thing they show, the locket of Slytherin? The one from the second memory?” Ron said, “Maybe he wants you to find out what they mean to people and to others, you know.”
Ron, Hermione and Harry’s hands all shot up, Remus nodded at them all, they looked at one another, as if questioning which one of them was going to say them. Though after a second they shrugged “Protego totalum, Salvio Hexia, Repello Muggletum, Muffliato, Cave inimicum” they all said at the same time. They had perfected their tempo, making sure they all said the words at the same time. They had realised after a few tries last year that saying them at the same time, while standing on different sides, would help with the strength.
‟Wait,” Harry says, ‟why are you all so casual about being married off?”
Hermione and Ron arrived back from their exam just before dinner. Ron had failed his test, but Hermione had not. After dinner the three devised a plan, Harry felt mildly guilty not having talked to Draco, but he felt that he had to act today. Harry would take the potion, only some, as he would not need 12 hours worth of potion, and go down to Slughorn’s office.
“Never expected to see Harry looking at Draco with love eyes,” Pansy mock whispered to Blaise, “I mean we have all seen the dagger eyes he’s been giving him till sixth year. This does explain why that stopped.” Blaise laughed, nodding.
‟Yes,” Harry answers instantly. He moves to straddle Draco. ‟I love you Draco, and I don´t care what the rest of the goddamn world thinks. You´ll be my husband and I´ll carry your name with pride. Like generations of Malfoy´s have done before you. Your family is more than the mistakes you, your father or grandfather made.”
‟There are some chairs and beds, mostly just warded against breaking and creaking.” He shrugs, ‟if there is something specific you´re looking for, just send an owl and I can ask around. I´ll let you have a look.”
Harry was happy that they were going there, he couldn’t wait to see his godfather, he had missed him. With the Aurors checking everyone’s post, he hadn’t been able to talk to him since before he went to school. Even meeting through the fireplace was not possible, because after fifth year there was a more strict fireplace policy, even though that is what caused the problem in the first place. He also was looking forward to seeing Remus again. Since he moved into Grimmauld place, he too had been more with Harry, luckily the two had been able to do some light talking over owl post, but not enough that Harry did not miss the only two people he knew that really knew his parents as friends, not as legends.
‟Telling me I made a mistake won’t bring me closer to him,” Draco says, ‟how can he expect me to visit him if he can´t even be civil about you.”
“The sword has accepted the claims on the title,” Narcissa said, “hereby you  have officially declared your stance, and are hereby known as Lord Sirius Black the third and Lord Remus John Black-Lupin.” She smiles, “you may kiss the groom.” This last bit she directs at Sirius with a wink.
“Harry,” Hermione said, “why didn’t you tell us about that? You have been keeping so much to yourself, especially with the lessons from Snape now.”
Most people were yelling, all mostly confused, Ron and Hermione were looking at Harry with a betrayed look on his face. And he saw Draco and Harry looking at each other. Sirius leaned over to Harry, “why don’t you go hug him, he looks like he could use a hug. And it would show that you two really are now ‘allies’.” Harry looked at him, the way he had said allies struck him, but he let it go in favour of standing and walking across to Draco. Most people were looking at Harry, and the group let him pass. When he was standing in front of Draco, everyone, but Sirius, Dumbledore and Snape held their breaths.
When Sirius and Remus came home Harry had little time to try and write down a story like he had told Draco he would. They only had one day left before they went back to Hogwarts, and both boys wanted to hear about the men’s honeymoon. The others in their turn wanted to know how their vacation had been and if they had thought about the wedding.
The two came back that evening with proud smiles on their faces. “So you guys managed to get the class instated?” Ron asked, having been told all about it by his girlfriend.
The moment the two boys entered their room Draco collapsed on their bed. Harry walked over, pulling off his cloak before climbing onto the bed and lying next to him. He waited, letting Draco think in his mind, letting him talk only when he felt the need to.
It is fun, and it takes their mind off all the studying they have to do.
“Then Griphook won’t think of it as if it belongs to you. He will think it belongs to the Goblin that made it. Even though, it belongs to you in our minds.” Harry opened his mouth. But Bill carried on.
“So, now that you know what you need,” he asked, “are you getting him tomorrow?”
They spent the day together, Draco teaching Harry how to paint. Or at least he attempted to, Harry did not turn out to be the painter, or drawer. But they had fun in the end, which was the main point.
Draco shrugs, ‟we have enough time to think about that,” he says, ‟it´s not like you have a mortgage to pay for this.” He´s silent for a few minutes, before turning to Harry again, ‟what do you say about finding some lunch before we go shopping for the rest of our furniture and necessities?”
“Not that this isn’t fun,” Ron said, “learning way too much about my best mates sex life, which honestly damn. Like I’m happy for you but how even?” The group laughed, agreeing with Ron. Harry just shrugged.
“Yes,” Dumbledore said, sitting behind his desk again. “The memory has been tampered with, very crudely. Slughorn seems to be ashamed and has changed the memory, however with how crudely he has done this, the real memory is still beneath this version.”
Harry shrugged it off, “We are not,” he said turning to her, “I told you, I’m not interested in you. I have never been, not really. Stop acting like we are dating.” His voice was loud, and faintly he knew that the people in the Great hall were all listening to him.
“Love,” Draco said, patiently, “you were speaking in Parsletongue. How do you not realise you start talking an entirely different language?”
They find two modest desks, with enough space for both of them, and with secret cabinets, which Harry really liked. They find three closets, two for them and one for in the guest bedroom.
“We’d like to get to know you too Harry,” the women said, “but don’t forget, we are only paintings. We have lived our life, yours isn’t even halfway through, we have enough time to talk.”
One of Hermione´s hands disappear from his, and she cups his face. ‟Harry,” she says softly, ‟you know we could never hate you for loving someone.” Harry opens his eyes, to see hers are filled with tears. ‟We love you, we´d have died for you. We don´t care who you love.”
“Because,” Hermione said, “you are meeting people, who have grown up in luxury and who can see who someone is from a mile away. You’re going to have to dress nicely when you are out meeting people, especially once you become a Lord.”
“How does Luna have that?” Hermione asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry went back to the party after that, Hermione asked him what happened and he said he just saw Snape drag Malfoy to the dungeons. She seemed happy with that answer. After the party, Harry brought Luna to her common room and thanked her for a good night with a friend, which made her very happy.
“So that the Malfoy family desk set is in the office of the head of the house, right?” Harry asked, receiving a nod in confirmation. “Good,” he said, “I agree.” Pihu and Lucien had been listening and did as the two had just discussed, moving the desk sets and summoning the Malfoy desk set after they received permission from Narcissa.
“Goblin made items are really expensive,” Hermione said, looking at Harry, “didn’t know Malfoy would give you something that expensive.”
“It turns out that my friends are more interested in who I am supposedly shagging than I thought they would be,” Draco explained. “They followed me, well, the tried to is more like it. So, I had to find a way to get away from them and come here on time. Turns out I can only do one of those.” He chuckled softly.
“It means that the head of the family won’t take care of you,” he said. “My mother married into the Malfoy family, and as she married the heir their allegiance went to them. Obviously, that doesn’t mean we aren’t family with the Blacks, there was a strong alliance bond with them. That usually is the reason that people marry into another noble family. But even though my mother is part of the Black family, she is taken care of with Malfoy money, and she wears the Malfoy name, and she would help my father with the Malfoy house and family. Now that he’s in Azkaban, she is the head of the family. The magic inside her is focused on the Malfoy magic. The black magic is there, but not the focus.”
“Fuck him,” Seamus said vehemently,  “Fuck that, I’m glad you didn’t die.” All the people in the carriage nodded, Harry felt happy to be surrounded by these people.
The two of them laid in the bed, staring into each other's eyes. Suddenly Draco hit harry lightly on his shoulder.
The class went by fast. With Hermione, Draco and Harry all pretty good at potions, Ron and Ernie, who were slightly worse, were encouraged and helped by their ease. In the end, they made an almost perfect potion, as the professor had called it.
She talks to Draco, she takes some effort in getting to know him, and see who he really is. It took some work, but she has accepted Draco. It was a relief to him, which shocked him, because since when did he need the approval of a Weasley. Though, one look at Harry, and how happy he looked to see her back in his life, tells him why.
‟It´s not even born yet and you want to put it in a Hogwarts house,” Harry asks.
Neville moved over to Harry, “did he really just ask why Seamus was walking like that?” he asked, Harry nodded. “Poor Hermione,” he said solemnly. Causing Harry to spit out his water, coughing. Neville’s head turned red, “No, wait I didn’t mean it like that,” he said, realising how it could’ve sounded. “I meant it in a poor Hermione, that she’s in a relationship with someone so tactless. Not in a how sad Hermione has apparently never needed to walk like that,” he rambled, his face only getting redder. Harry was laughing so loud he felt his stomach hurt.
“Ready?” Draco asked, Harry breathed out a shaky breath. He nodded, turning the doorknob, opening the room. Together they stepped into the room.
Silently they walked back to the library, voices coming from the library. Though Harry only recognised Sirius and Remus’ voices, the others were unknown. Harry walked in to see them standing in front of a painting, talking with two people.
Harry nods, ‟sometimes being famous also comes with its perks. Don´t think we´d know this if it wasn´t for him recognising us.” Draco nods.
Harry nods, he unclenches his hands, ‟we were fighting, just now.” He whispers softly, ‟about this, and he said the same thing. I should have faith in you all.” He looks up, ‟I almost told him I bought this during the fight.”
“Oh,” Harry said relieved, “he was just saying that this ring was made by a goblin he knew.”
He had only said yes when he suddenly had a lap full of Harry in front of him. Harry's knees bracketing Draco’s thighs. Even though most of Harry’s first kisses seemed to have been initiated by women, this time it was different. Harry grabbed Draco’s face with both hands, Draco’s hands went to Harry’s hips. They looked into each other's eyes, and Harry surged forward.
“Of course not,” Draco said, “we did it last night, performing a spell that is as strong as this underage is not acceptable, especially as it could hurt your magic.” Remus and Sirius both nodded in agreement.
“I really did not need to know who kissed my sister,” Ron said holding his head in his hands, he locked eyes with Harry, squinting at him. “We will talk about this later,” he threatened.
Narcissa spoke up, “we will be moving large quantities, most of this you will not have to move, but most of Draco’s personal effects are to go to the manor.” She paused, the elf nodded in understanding. “We will also be moving most of the books to the manor, however, I imagine you know better than us how much of the library can be filled.”
‟Just reminds me of Tonks, she didn´t like her own name all that much, since it was that posh,” Ron points out.
Harry nodded, “yes please.” He wasn’t going to mention his part in the robbery if they weren’t going to mention it.
“I do not know,” Luna confessed, “though I believe it was Draco himself that did this. As he was at Hogwarts for some time and no one else took care of us during this period. As did he help us escape, as Harry explained.”
“Why do you have to stay?” Ron asked, to which Harry just shrugged. “We’ll be in the common room of the eight-year, see you there.”
“Harry and Draco,” he said, “It is all up to you.” He flicked his wand at the radio, “some music for ambience,” he said smiling.
Lupin and Sirius nodded, “well, I don’t like that you three are going to leave without any of us knowing what or where you guys are going,” Remus said, “but I trust Dumbledore, if he thinks you three can do it alone, we’ll accept it.”
“Now,” he looked at the clock, “the duel of Harry and Draco took quite long, so we can only look at one duel of an unbonded couple,” he said, “any volunteers?” he asked.

“What?” Bella asked, looking up at the pained expression, “Oh. That. Hads, already?” she asked much to Hermione’s horror and dismay. “Yup. Now’s as good a time as ever. Ay? You wanna go?” Hadrian replied.
“We’re both marked,” Hadrian said giggling after checking to make sure that no portraits or people were around.
“That’s master, mudblood” Hadrian corrected. “Kivaro!” he said, relishing in her screams. “Know your betters.”

“Awesome, thanks so much! And, Draco,”
“Thanks Harry,” Neville said with a smile.

He headed to the locker room and changed into his regular robes. “Good game, Draco,” Hadrian said, shaking Draco’s hand. “You too, Hads,” Draco replied. Hadrian smiled back at him. His father had told him Severus was feeling overworked, but Dumbledore didn’t have any good alternatives. His father was going to have an Amy Tallivex - an American half-blood - offer to teach. She’d have full credentials and was the daughter of Logan Tallivex and Cressa Tallivex - two light wizards who were killed in a gory fashion by “prejudicial” pure-bloods two years ago. She’d moved to England to teach DADA at Hogwarts.

He wasn’t as confident in Neville, but Neville seemed to not be as stuck as Ron and Hermione in his ways and if he could forgive the dark, surely so could Neville. He made a plan to talk to each of them to see if he should push further or back off.

“Toxic environment,” Harry snorted, “Toxic is an understatement. My aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were muggles. Petunia knew of magic because of Lily and Vernon because of Petunia through Lily, but that didn’t mean they liked it. They HATED magic with a passion. I was left on their doorstep in the middle of the night in November with a note, and Petunia and Vernon had the marvelous idea to stamp the magic out of me. My accidental magic was called freakishness and was severely punished. Naturally, I had a lot of it. Oftentimes, I’d be locked in my cupboard without food or water for days, weeks on end. I was also beaten by my uncle Vernon before being sent to my cupboard. I had an insane amount of chores as well. I had to work harder than your old house elf Dobby worked probably. I had to cook three meals a day, vacuum and mop the whole house, weed and trim aunt Petunia’s rose bushes (which were quite thorny), paint the fence when it got worn out, make all the beds, clean the bathrooms, clean and fold the laundry, clean the windows, and dust the whole house ever since I could remember. The chores probably started when I was four or something. Even when I wasn’t in trouble, I had to sleep in my cupboard because Dudley’s second room stored all his old toys. To make matters worse, I had no friends because Dudley scared anyone who tried to talk to me away and I could never do better than Dudley in school or I would be punished by my aunt and uncle. I rarely got food and when I did, it was scraps. Dudley also set up a game called Harry Hunting with his gang, where they’d chase me. If they caught up to me, they’d beat me up. My aunt and uncle were convinced that Dudley could do no wrong, and any other adults would only tell my aunt and uncle. They got me the cheapest glasses they could find and never checked my prescription after that, and that was only when the school called and told them I couldn’t see the board. I never got vaccinations or saw a doctor of any sort other than when I was severely sick and my aunt thought I might die. Magic was considered the m-word and was forbidden. I never got any presents on my birthday or even acknowledgement that it was my birthday every year. I got Dudley’s old clothes and Dudley was huge, so they never fit me.”

Loyalty Potion keyed to the Dursleys - cast by Albus Dumbledore
Harry snuck onto the Hogwarts train with Draco, and avoided contact with Dumbledore. They got off, and immediately side-along apparated to Riddle Manor with an Tom Marvolo Riddle who looked like a middle aged version of Diary-Tom. Tom showed Harry his new bedroom and Draco his guest room for the holidays. Additionally, a personal house-elf was assigned to both of them. Draco’s was called Haddie and Harry’s was called Friva. They settled in and had a relaxing rest of the day. Dinner was brought up to them and they eventually fell asleep.
Harry walked into the room right on time, and sat down in the front row. He purposefully mirrored their Lord’s posture. Their Lord didn’t mind if his Inner Circle did so to intimate other Death Eaters, as long as they didn’t abuse the privilege. Harry certainly counted as Inner Circle --- he’d been told by the Dark Lord himself --- even though he hadn’t been officially marked yet. Severus flinched slightly, but masked his discomfort quickly and yelled at him to start gutting flobberworms. Ugh. He hated that. No thanks.
