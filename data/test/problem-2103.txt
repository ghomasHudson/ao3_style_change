That night after finishing at the Muggle clothing store and eating a silent dinner with Malfoy, Harry lay awake in his bed. They had gotten rooms directly across from each other at the Leaky Cauldron for the night and would leave just after breakfast for Heathrow Airport to buy plane tickets and make their way to Paris and then Cairo.
Harry hurried back up to the school and packed within the allotted time frame. He was by no means eager to begin this journey with Malfoy, but he imagined the man would become intolerable if Harry did not arrive by their agreed upon time.
Susan hardly touched her food as she listened to Potter talk. But, eventually, the story and her questions ran out, and she turned to other matters. "Are you heading out for Gryffindor's tomb immediately in the morning?"
His chest felt like it was constricting while a weight on his stomach felt very much like someone had implanted a brick there. This tension in his body had built during dinner, accompanied by whirring thoughts. That was a big reason why he had been quiet. He could feel the anxiety attack coming, building, rioting in the blood in his veins.
The large silver double doors were easily twice Draco's height. Neither bore a handle or knob of any kind. Twin silver cobra heads with emeralds for eyes and long forked tongues protruding from their mouths were mounted on the doors just a bit higher than eye level. As Potter stopped beside him, both snakes opened their mouths wider and began to speak:
Draco's face felt like a fire ball, and he was grateful that he was facing away from Potter. "Potter," he warned softly. His voice was steady despite the fact he felt like a python was constricting his airway.
"I suspect she was hoping I'd never find it. But, I did. And once I heard the prophecy, the mark appeared on my arm." He pulled up the right sleeve of his robes to reveal a mark identical to Harry's.
Potter glanced up and straightened up so he was no longer sitting over the potion. "Sorry. Anyways, you need to eat, and we need to discuss a plan. I think we should try the blood tracking thing again to see if it points anywhere more specific now that we're here."
"We need to talk," Potter said, and Draco felt the man's breath fan over his shoulder. He was far too close.
The statue was an ornately carved figure with the body of a man and the head of an ibis. It held a long, regal-looking staff in one hand. Over where the figure's heart would have been was a gash that looked like it was encrusted with crystals of varying shades of green. In front of the statue, at chest height, floated a dagger. The blade was a finely sharpened and polished emerald.
Finally, there were no more steps, and they both stopped on the landing. Just as they began shining their lights around them to search for where to go next, two braziers burst to life with fierce green fire. They stood on either side of a curved stone archway. Above the arch was another silver serpent head.
"If," Draco said softly. "If you fuck me." He wouldn't have Potter assuming they were going to have sex right there in the middle of a tomb.
Potter seemed to suspect he had heard a repeat message and made to speak, but Draco jumped to his feet and stormed off to the bathroom to take a shower. When he returned, Potter was seemingly asleep.
"Slytherin has some explaining to do about that last test," Malfoy said darkly from the other side of the room. He held a few small bones in his hand and was searching for more.
"We'd be seen flying that far," Potter said. As if Draco hadn't already thought of that. "And we can't only travel at night."
When he had figured out the prophecy had connected him to Potter, it had been a blow. He had done his best to cast aside those lingering schoolboy feelings. He thought they were long-buried. He was already wary that the contents of the prophecy and the fact he and Potter had been paired together was some type of strange twisted matchmaking. Of course, he wouldn't allow that to happen. Neither would Potter obviously. He knew he was reading too much into it and that his anxiety was likely unfounded. They were enemies now being forced to work together.
"Egypt," Potter said, finishing the sentence for him. He turned to stare at him and then finally blinked. "I've been so stupid. Bill Weasley used to work for Gringotts bank as a curse-breaker. Here. In Egypt. He took the whole Weasley family on a tour of the pyramids before."
Finally, the sun touched the horizon, and they decided to set up the tent for the night. Potter put up the tent with a few waves of his wand and started a fire to cook dinner. As he did so, the surrounding temperature began to drop, and some of the dense heat that had built up in Draco's limbs started to ease.
Potter pulled back enough so that they were now staring into each other's eyes. Potter cupped his cheek in his hand and stroked his thumb across his cheekbone. He gave a nod. "Things are terrifying sometimes. They may even seem impossible. But, that shouldn't stop you from living. Instead, let yourself be scared and then do what ever the so-called impossible, terrifying thing is anyway."
"I think I liked it better when we were enemies," Draco finally said after several long minutes had passed. He felt Potter tense at his words.
Unsure of how to approach the situation but knowing he needed to do something, Harry tugged on Malfoy's arm. The pain was throbbing in his arm, and he needed it to stop. It had something to do with the man beside him, he was sure of that. Was the red glow and pain around the serpent meant to indicate that Malfoy was in peril? Clearly, the mark had only alerted Harry, so this must have been what it meant.
Potter nodded and gave her a hug while Draco muttered a quiet thanks. Susan gave a final nod and slipped through the solid side of the Sphinx into the den Draco knew was beyond.
Potter downed the rest of his butterbeer and slid from the booth. He tossed a few sickles onto the table to pay Rosmerta for the drink. "One hour," he agreed.
Then everything went dark as if someone had snuffed out multiple lamps. Looking around and finally up, Draco saw a huge shape looming above their tent. He sprung up from the bed and ran outside, Potter at his heels.
Potter was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. He held a ladle in one hand and half of a hawawshi in the other. A small cauldron sat bubbling in front of him. He took another bite of the meat and vegetable stuffed pita bread and leaned over the cauldron to inspect the surface.
Harry nodded and waited for Malfoy to collect his things before starting for the other end of the chamber where a dark archway awaited them. He understood Malfoy's rush to get through the pyramid whether it led to success or failure. It wasn't like they could leave. The only way was forward. And Harry really didn't want to have to spend the night on a hard stone floor surrounded by bones of past pairs that had attempted the same tasks.
Draco pulled the pillow away so he could hear better, though he was staring at the wall of the tent, not Potter. "What do you think?" he snapped.
"Potter," he breathed after a few more moments. His mouth felt completely dry as the nerves and excitement from having Potter touch him warred in his stomach. But this feeling was quickly being overtaken by a growing tightness lower down. He tucked his face into Potter's neck and gave a little mewl when the raven-haired man gently squeezed his sac.
Draco actually smiled at this. "Well, thanks to our dear prophecy, I can actually speak it now. I found out when I got home from the vault that day. I could suddenly understand my pet snake and talk to it. It was wild."
Slytherin narrowed his eyes. "You may learn in time that love is more motivating than even death, young Draco."
Draco turned to Potter, who was waiting expectantly. "Right, so..." He explained the brief message the cobras had given him in Parseltongue.
Malfoy slit his eyes open just barely, and Harry was unsure whether it was a simple glance or a death glare.
"So, we have to think like Slytherin," Potter said dryly. "Last time I found a hidden place of his, it wasn't exactly welcoming or easy to find."
"This isn't going to work," he grumbled and got to his feet. He seized the pillows from the floor and tossed them onto the opposite side of the bed. "I know you're not happy about it, but move over."
"Whoa, wait," Draco said, and she looked back at him with a worried crease in her forehead. "Do you know something about all this?" He motioned to the mark on his own arm. He didn't exactly want to go around telling anyone and everyone about their prophecy task, but it was obvious Susan was already privy to the information somehow.
"Hmm, ok." She sat back down and looked between them. "The animals look wary, untrusting of each other. I can't let you two attempt to find the tomb until I know you trust each other more."
Harry then looked back at Malfoy. The man had seated himself on the dais, which was basically a circular slab of obsidian a foot thick and six feet wide. He had buried his face in his hands, his fingers threaded into his hair.
Malfoy sneered. "Ha. Ha. You know, I hope Gryffindor has a personal task for you too when we get there. Maybe he'll have you throw yourself down a gorge and save me the trouble."
Harry laughed hollowly. "I know. And I didn't want to argue for something I knew I was going to lose." He slowly got to his feet, giving Draco time to do the same without pulling on the chain.
Draco stopped walking only once he had reached the bar counter inside the Leaky Cauldron. He ordered a shot of fire whiskey from the barman and downed it a few seconds later just as Potter stopped behind him.
Slytherin drew himself up straighter. "Do not pretend to understand the reasoning of the actions of others. Pride makes people do things they later wish they hadn't. And impending death puts many things in perspective, makes old grudges seem childish. But, you will notice that Godric had his own chances to come after me to reconcile, and he never did. He is just as much at fault for our separation in death."
McGonagall had promised that his office would be locked and remain untouched in his absence. Ron or whoever they found to substitute for him would be given space in a vacant office somewhere else in the castle. As such, he felt secure in leaving some personal items behind, such as the Marauder's Map, the bottled memories he had stored beside the pensieve, and other such items. He wouldn't need them in Egypt and wherever else they were going.
Susan could have grown a second head right then, and Draco would have been less surprised. "Why would Hufflepuff want to protect Slytherin's tomb?"
Harry pressed his lips together in a firm line. "I think we've done enough for one day. We should just tackle any Gryffindor stuff tomorrow. Because I know what you're really trying to do. You're trying to get out of talking about our feelings for each other. You agreed we would talk once we got back to Cairo."
Harry ran another hand through his hair and then finally looked straight at Malfoy, stopping his pacing. "How did you know it was me that's the prodigy of Gryffindor?"
Silence. And then the unmistakable creak of the other bed as Potter got up. Good, maybe Potter would get breakfast started while he spent a few more moments in bed fuming over how unfair it was that the founder he admired was being a dick.
This was it, Draco thought. The statue was going to crush his skull with the next blow, and he couldn't even think where to move quickly enough with the blinding pain from the last strike having dazed him.
He could perform a Cheering Charm, but that was risky. Professor Flitwick had said they worked to reverse sadness temporarily but that some levels of extreme distress could not be affected by the spell. Besides, he hadn't practiced one since his exam at the end of third year. He wasn't about to try to both get it right and be discreet about it on a plane full of Muggles. If it went wrong, Malfoy's behavior could change so drastically that those around him think him mad or drunk. That was not a good idea.
Malfoy's tell-tale smirk appeared on his face. "You were the first enemy I thought of. And, you're a Gryffindor. It seemed...ironic enough to be poetic." At Harry's eye roll, his smirk disappeared, and he became more serious. "I consulted some books on prophecy too. The lines 'blood to blood, find one another' are a staple of many prophecies, it seems. It's how the people of prophecies can locate each other."
Plus, Harry couldn't deny how arousing it was to think of listening to Malfoy touch himself and cum mere feet away. He would have preferred to watch him do it too, but he knew that would never be an option. The only reason he would even be allowed in the room with Malfoy was because they were required to go through the pyramid together.
Draco just stared at him for several long moments. He had made a perfectly sound argument. Damn it. "I..." But he wasn't sure where that sentence was going at all. He looked away, trying to collect his thoughts. His attention snapped back to Potter though when the man laid a hand on his knee.
"No, as I said, we have permission to be here. We work with the Ministry. We're more like police than anything, though we do have the appearance of, I suppose, what Muggles would think is a gang. But we control crime, not make it."
Malfoy made about stuffing his day clothes into his bag for what seemed longer than necessary. He was obviously stalling, and when Harry cleared his throat pointedly, he sighed, slumping his shoulders a bit as he turned to frown at Harry. "There's no chance you'll let the conversation about the third challenge drop?"
Harry sighed. He couldn't deny that the blond had a point. What did this task really prove to Slytherin?
As Potter murmured a spell to switch his pajamas to suitable pyramid-raiding clothes as well, Draco began down the gentle slope toward the pyramid's entrance. Luckily, and unlike the pyramids of Giza, this one had a very noticeable door set into the side of it.
"Possibly both. And since everything else in the prophecy seems to be literal, I'm taking the line about 'rain fire and venom' literally."
"You know," Harry said, walking over to him and stopping several feet away. "You still have a choice. You don't actually have to do this."
Draco pushed himself out from under the pair, careful not to hit his arm on the stone floor as he did so. He looked back at them. Potter was holding what he recognized instantly as the sword of Gryffindor, rubies glinting menacingly in the green firelight.
"Not until you tell me what has you so upset." There was a pause. "Did I do something? Are you angry with me? If you feel like I'm pushing you into something you don't want or aren't ready for, that's not what I-"
Draco gave a noncommittal hum as he ladled the hot chocolate into two mugs he had conjured. "We'll see how I feel in the morning." He shifted so his back was blocking Potter's view of the cauldron and carefully poured the Sleeping Draught into one of the mugs. Then he slipped the empty vial out of sight in his pajama pocket. He walked back to the bed and handed Potter the spiked mug. "I make it the perfect temperature so it's ready to drink," he said as he sat down opposite him. He took a large gulp of his pointedly and indicated for Potter to try his own.

Draco's stomach plummeted. Five hundred years and no one had succeeded with the prophecy's tasks. How could they succeed where other witches and wizards had failed repeatedly?
about the blond, an emotion he had discovered to be capable of for Malfoy when he was sixteen. That day he had cast Sectumsempra on him and thought he had killed him. Now, seeing those scars of self-inflicted pain had brought that emotion right back. When had he made them? They seemed old. Maybe it had been during sixth year when Malfoy had been living in fear of Voldemort as he was forced to attempt a task not even the most feared wizard of all time would dare do. Did he still cut himself and was just better at hiding it now? Were there more marks elsewhere on his body?
Harry stepped over to him where Dumbledore's portrait was hung at almost eye level since his portrait was the most recent. "What do you think about all of this?"
"What do you know about it?" Malfoy hissed, his eyes wide now. He made to stand up and push past Harry's legs, but Harry pulled him back down into his seat.
"I never could have imagined having these feelings for you," Potter continued. "But over the last few days, I've felt these feelings stirring, and I wasn't sure what to do about them. But Slytherin kind of took away my choice to remain quiet about them."
"Then why the aggressive name?" Potter asked. "And what do you mean that this group has been around that long?"
He had spent many hours in the Headmistress's office, pacing and talking aloud with McGonagall about what it could mean. The portraits of past Heads, of course, had their own opinions, and more than once, Harry had shouted to silence them.
He and Malfoy stopped to purchase some lamb kebabs from a woman's street cart, both famished from wandering the city's bustling market that morning. Neither of them had seen anything to indicate wizards nearby. Once, Harry had seen a brass teapot vanish from a merchant's table while the man had his back turned, but the boy was gone before Harry could determine if it had been magic or simple sleight of hand.
Malfoy ignored Harry's outstretched hand and put his bag up in the compartment himself. Then, as if they had agreed on it prior, he slipped into the row of seats to take the one by the window. They had bought tickets in a two seat wide row so as to not have to deal with a third random passenger possibly overhearing them talk about magic. Though, they would have to keep their voices down anyways since the plane was packed full of Muggles.
Yes, they were sharing one room. According to the front desk clerk downstairs, tourist season was at its peak, and everyone wanted rooms with a view of Giza. So, the hotel was very limited on space. Much to Draco's great relief, the room had two beds. He flushed just to think about sharing a bed with Potter.
Potter raised an eyebrow. "No?" He shrugged and ate the bite of bun himself. "You need to relax," he said through the mouthful.
"And I still don't," Malfoy said stiffly. "Just because you...whatever happened in that pyramid is going to
Another pub patron walked by Draco on his way to the bathroom. His face twisted into a look of disgust, and he hurried on. Draco set the vial aside. The man had undoubtedly mistook him for a vampire, and with how thin and pale he was nowadays, he could hardly blame him. Playing with blood while in the middle of a dining establishment was only the tipping point for such an assumption.
He frowned and sat up a bit straighter. Even as he watched, the last sliver of the sun and its diluted rays suddenly shone a rich emerald green. It spread peridot fingers across the sky, quickly darkening to emerald too and then black. Then the sun was gone, and it was as dark as if it were midnight.
He was right. As soon as his hand closed around the hilt of the dagger, the statue's staff slammed down onto his shoulder. A tingling numbness shot through his shoulder down to his fingertips, nearly making him drop the dagger. But he held onto the weapon and backed up quickly.
Two weeks ago, a strange mark had appeared on Harry's right inner forearm. Since one mark on his body had already dictated the first almost eighteen years of his life, he was sure another one showing up randomly was not a good sign. And, he was definitely sure he hadn't been drunk and gotten a tattoo without remembering. Tattoos did not suddenly make themselves known in the middle of a teaching demonstration and shoot bright pain through the inner elbow as if shot by a centaur's arrow.
Draco turned to face him, praying the other man would assume the fire whiskey was what was making his cheeks flame hot pink now. "I did not throw a tantrum. I like my personal space."
Draco turned to stare at Potter, who hadn't said a single word yet. He was thoroughly annoyed to see the man laughing behind his hand. "Do you think this is funny, Potter?"
Malfoy waved a hand frantically, indicating for him to shut up. "Stop, just...stop. We shouldn't be thinking about each other in that way. Besides, even if you had those thoughts about me, you never would have actually acted on them if I hadn't made you." As he spoke, he rubbed his fingers over his inner left wrist, making this action seem like a nervous tic Harry hadn't noticed him do before.
Harry set the vial on his desk and turned away. He moved to a cabinet crammed into the corner of his room and opened it. When he returned to the desk, he was holding the pensieve. "McGonagall gave it to me when I started teaching here." Two years of teaching at Hogwarts, and he still refused to call her Minerva.
Potter shrugged a shoulder. "I'm surprised Slytherin is making a task without magic. But, if using cunning is the idea, then it makes sense."
Draco didn't look at him. He just laid down and got himself comfortable so his arm position allowed them more slack on the chain. "Just stay on your side."
"I don't know," Harry said. "I've only seen one as a boggart in Lupin's classroom. Maybe a Silencing Charm will work?"
"Did I wake you?" Harry asked. He propped himself up on his elbows as he tried to push the last foggy tendrils of sleep from his mind.
Angry determination swept over Malfoy's features as he spun around, snatched up the scepter, and slammed the head of it down onto the glass coffin. The glass shattered, and the skeleton priest fell to the floor with a clatter as easily as if he had been a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Draco stabbed at his iced cinnamon bun with a fork while a flurry of activity buzzed around him. The Paris airport cafe where he was seated was tiny and loud. Truly, he hadn't realized how many Muggles used air travel like this. He had never had a reason to pay attention to such things. But now, he could see vacationing families, honeymooning couples, and men and women in suits about to go through security with their various luggage. Near the counter of the cafe, a mother wrestled a screaming toddler back into a stroller while her other child of maybe twelve ordered what he wanted from the cashier.
This was true, and Harry looked back down at the small vial in his hands to avoid looking at him. "So, you heard it, and the mark appeared, but how did you know it involved me?"
Harry's thoughts strayed to Malfoy as he took down the tent with a few waves of his wand and then stuffed it back into his backpack. The blond had been uncharacteristically silent and extra broody since the encounter with Slytherin's spirit. Even now as Harry vanished the remains of their cooking fire from the previous night, Malfoy was staring dejectedly at the ground.
"Could you not get onions in my Calming Draught?" Draco snapped as Potter's hand holding the hawawshi hovered precariously over the rim of the cauldron in the man's apparent distraction. He knew he should have made the potion himself, but Potter had volunteered to do it for him again to simply have some on hand for emergencies. And since he didn't fancy potion brewing much himself, he hadn't argued the point.
The use of the blond's first name seemed to wrench him back to sobriety, though he still seemed less tense than a few moments previous. He frowned, sighed, and then said, "I'm not into getting close to people anymore. I really never was, to tell the truth. But it only got worse when my parents and most of my friends died in the battle. And then the rest seemed to just vanish. People didn't write back after the war ended. I just can't take that kind of hurt again. Not death, not heartbreak, not anything. I like being in control of who has access to my emotions."
A tall statue similar to the one of Thoth in the previous chamber downstairs stepped out of the alcove. This one had a jackal's head and carried a flail.
Potter nodded once he had relayed the message. "Should we take down the tent? Do you think we have everything we need?"
Though he knew Potter would be out for several hours, possibly till dawn at least, Draco packed quickly. When he had gathered everything, he wrote a note and laid it on the nightstand beside Potter's bed. He leaned over and gingerly took the man's glasses off his face. He imagined sleeping with glasses on would probably be painful. He laid the glasses atop the note.
"Why?" Draco pressed his nose in against Potter's neck, forcing himself to take deep breaths. Even amidst all the anxiety and racing thoughts, he formed a solid good one, which was that Potter's scent was comforting.
Malfoy clenched his jaw, and his gaze flitted to their hands. Harry's fingers had went still but were still brushing against his hand. He looked back up at Harry. "I can't think about this right now, Potter." He pulled his hand away and crossed his arms over his abdomen. "I see your point, but I just can't right now."
Draco was highly aware that he was naked in Potter's arms, but he didn't pull away. Instead, he leaned on him and simply sobbed, unable to speak through the tears now as his emotions seemed to unravel from their tightly bound cord and spring from him. He was grateful to find that Potter didn't speak again and only held him, rubbing his back and waiting until Draco was ready to speak once he had calmed a bit.
Beside him, Potter blew out a long breath and ran his hand through his hair, making it look deliciously ruffled. Draco shook himself and turned back to Susan instantly, though he knew his cheeks were the tiniest bit pink.
Potter actually had the audacity to grin at him. "Is that what you think? You think because I dated girls in school that I'm straight? I'm bi, actually. I figured it out in fourth year." At Draco's disbelieving look, he added, "Cedric."
"You need to calm down," Harry whispered. He cast a glance around to make sure no one had noticed Malfoy's behavior. He didn't think prying questions from a Muggle stewardess was what they needed right then.
Draco swallowed with some difficulty as fresh nervousness thrummed through his veins. But, he did as Potter asked, or rather, commanded. And there was something so undeniably sexy about Potter's behavior that he didn't even feel any annoyance at taking demands from him. He tilted his head down and opened his eyes so he could see the man's hand moving rapidly up and down his cock. He shivered as the sight paired with the tactile sensation seemed to blend together wonderfully and make him even harder. The next time Potter's hand slid to his tip, he groaned loudly as he suddenly released, spilling cum onto the dais in several long stripes.
"Are you the priest that did Slytherin's burial rites?" Harry asked hesitantly. He and Malfoy were still standing just outside the door, and it seemed Malfoy wasn't in a hurry to enter the burial chamber either.
"Focus on breathing slowly," Harry said. He tried to focus on speaking slow and reassuring words for the man beside him. It took all his willpower to keep his eyes on Malfoy's face and not let his gaze flit to their touching hands.
"Right, well, there's no rush, I suppose," Harry said. He moved over to one wall and sat down with his back against the cool stone. "We've made good time. Just tell me when to close my eyes and cast Muffliato on me when you decide you're ready."
Draco thought it was strange enough that apparently a group of past Hufflepuffs had formed something akin to a Muggle motorcycle gang right in the heart of Egypt. But, now, he was so taken aback by seeing one of his former classmates that he wasn't even paying attention to what Susan was saying at first.
He reached the end of the current essay in front of him and marked it with an 'E' before setting it aside on the small stack of graded papers. The stack of ungraded ones from all his other classes was already threatening to spill onto the floor if he breathed wrong. But, there was nowhere else to put them. The rest of his desk space was taken up by books and letters and other random items he had found necessary to have on-hand. The drawers were no better, stuffed as they were with products from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, spare quills, photographs, and
Snape's eyes slowly moved to him. "I think Phineas is suggesting we Slytherins cannot keep our personal and professional lives separate. That Salazar Slytherin himself was not so cunning as to keep a relationship secret regardless of who it was with." He sneered as if this were a personal insult, and Harry understood why since he had learned the truth about Snape's past during the Battle of Hogwarts.
It was hard to tell if Akil looked startled at Malfoy's outburst since no flesh or eyes adorned his bare skull. But he inclined his head. "Yes. Just break the glass, and both Salazar and I will be free."
"I say I quite agree!" piped up Phineas Nigellus Black from his portrait somewhere behind Harry. "Their lives have been analyzed and dissected by some of the greatest historians of the age. No, no, there was no relationship between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I say."
Harry felt a smile tug at the corner of his mouth, but he quickly hid it by looking around to the beds as if giving more thought to the problem. If Malfoy saw him grinning again at his discomfort, he was sure the man would just elect to chop off his arm rather than remain in the cuffs one second longer.
Harry nodded and walked with him to the archway. Peering inside, there were more green fire braziers, and in the center of the room stood the banshee. She was unmistakable. Even though she was cast in green light, Harry knew the color of her skin would be the same sickly green in broad daylight. Her long black hair swept the floor, and dark penetrating eyes stared at them. She wasn't screaming. Yet.
The chamber glistened with stacks and stacks of gold galleons, silver sickles, and bronze knuts. An elaborate green velvet and platinum rimmed crown sat atop a marble bust that Harry recognized as Slytherin since it so resembled the statue he had seen years ago in the Chamber of Secrets. Beside this was an erect scepter set with an emerald the size of Harry's first as the top stone where tendrils of platinum wound around it. A shelf of scrolls and large tomes was next to a table with a crystal ball and a deck of tarot cards.
This question had the desired effect at first. Malfoy blushed scarlet and opened and closed his mouth several times, evidently at a loss for words. Then he swallowed, and Harry was disgusted with himself when he saw sadness cloud the blond's eyes. Malfoy gave a jerky nod. "Right. Well...right. Let's just get the showers over with."
It was Draco's turn to frown. "While being unconscious on the plane sounds great, are you sure I'll wake up in time?" He couldn't imagine the embarrassment he would feel if he woke up off the plane and discovered Potter had had to carry him off or something else equally humiliating.
"Laugh if you want. But think about it. The words of the prophecy itself make it clear that we can choose our own fates. It is not influencing me in my feelings toward you. Don't you think that if the purpose of the prophecy was to force the prodigies to love each other that the very first pair of prodigies would have succeeded? You said this is a journey prophecy. That also means it's a choice prophecy. And maybe you think Slytherin is forcing me to tell you how I feel. No. It's me choosing life over death by starvation in the desert. It's me choosing to take a risk that your secret to tell is not of the same nature and my feelings go unrequited. Now it's your turn to make the same choice. But don't, not for a single second, think my feelings aren't legitimate."
Draco gave a slight nod and released Potter's shirt finally. He lowered his hands to his side and stepped back so there was a few inches between them. "Partially."
"Can we help you?" asked the man in a kinder voice than Harry expected. If there had been any doubt in his mind that this group of bikers were Hufflepuffs, there was none now.
"Silencio!" Malfoy shouted. His spell his the banshee square in the chest, but her scream didn't even waver.
Harry walked over to him to peer at the document. It was a world map, and in the northern United Kingdom was a dried dot of blood labeled as Harry Potter. Harry leaned closer to inspect it but withdrew quickly as a flash of silver caught in the corner of his eye. "What are you-"
This statement seemed to break the spell of silence Harry had found cast upon himself. "The problem?" he spluttered. "I see lots of problems!" Suddenly, he was on his feet again, his hands running a familiar path through his hair that he typically reserved for stressful students or long letters from Hermione about politics.
"We're inside the Sphinx," Susan said. At both Draco's and Potter's startled expressions, she continued, "The Great Sphinx of Giza is considered a protected monument by both the Egyptian Muggle ministry and the Egyptian Ministry of Magic. No one can do excavations here, and we have permission to use it as a base. This is the top floor. Our garage and cafeteria combo. There's more chambers below this one for sleeping and such."
Harry tuned out Malfoy's continued grumbling as he looked around the plane. He didn't see what the big deal was. It was close quarters, but he found them cozy rather than irritating. Maybe that was because he had grown up in such a confined space in that cupboard under the stairs. It had felt safe, like a haven from his aunt, uncle, and cousin. Being in the plane now felt like that again.
Harry loosened his hold on his own chair as the bus settled into an easier pace. Or at least until it stopped for another passenger. "Planes are perfectly safe," he said before Malfoy could get out the protest he knew was coming.
"That's the way I see it," Malfoy said. He crossed his arms over his chest. "So, they have to be brought back together. We're essentially matchmakers, trying to get them to make up."
Harry sighed deeply, unsure of whether that made him more hopeful or more irritated with the current situation. He turned back to McGonagall. "I'm sorry to leave you like this. You know I don't want to leave."
Draco was shaking by now, and his hand was making such uneven movements that it was hard to get a good rhythm going. "Potter," he said, and he thought he had maybe snapped the word in his current state. "Come here. If you really want all that, come here and do this for me."
With hunger in his eyes, he began crawling towards the edge of the bed, keeping his eyes on the prize: Harry's prick.
Draco laggardly worked his mouth lower, letting his tongue explore the new territory. The tip of his nose brushed against his hand he had wrapped around the base and he pulled back up, sucking his cheeks in.
was at this hour, the curtains of his four poster bed drawn tightly with a silencing charm on for good measures.
"Want you." Draco let his head fall to the side, too tired to keep it upright. The expression on his face screamed pure arousal and the beauty of it felt overwhelming to Harry.
Without wasting anymore time than he already has, he let his fingertips graze his skin as he slid his hand over his stomach, making his way down his pale physique.
Harry's foot steps echoed down the empty corridor every time the sole of his shoe crashed down against the stone floor. He frantically raced through the castle, moving so quickly that he was practically levitating through the hallways.
"I just think it would be very unhealthy for you to not relieve yourself of that tension, that's all." Harry's voice was lower than usual, more ravenous. There was no hiding the fact that he was genuinely feeling aroused, even in Draco's hazy state he could recognize that.
"I think I'm quite cozy on the floor here." His hands fell from Draco's cheeks to rub circles into the carpet beneath him. He knew this would frustrate Draco. All of the years of bickering and learning how to get under each other's skin was starting to come in handy.
"It's ok, Papa, I protect you." Albus puffed his chest out, looking all small and mighty. The gesture tugged at the corner of Draco's lips and pulled his mouth into a smile.
Harry melted under his stare, eyes rolling back and mouth parting in pure pleasure. He was close to coming fully undone, right in the back of the potions classroom.
"Come on." The impatience in his voice was salient now. He needed to write back to Harry to let him know that he got his message.
"Don't you even dare." Draco panicked, clasping his other hand around Harry's wrist which put a stop to his tantalizing motions.
He missed Harry. He was so accustomed to the presence of Harry's magic emanating from his home office everyday, that it made his absence feel insanely off putting.
"Soil your trousers. Come untouched. Do you think you could?" Harry questioned, eager to know the answer.
Harry stared straight at the moving photos Slughorn was presenting and he could feel the heat of Draco's glare on his face.
" Draco wedged his hand under Harry's to gain access to the waist band of his pants. He swiftly tugged them back and watched as his cock hit the air of the classroom once again.
! I don't even know why the hell I was in the bath! One moment I was sitting at the edge of the tub and I blink once, and the next thing I know I'm sitting inside with my swim trunks on pretending to be a Princess!"
Smirking to himself, he let one of the leg openings get caught on his big toe and he pulled it back gently with his hand, careful not to stretch it. He let it go with a small snap and his panties flew a few feet in front of him, landing in front of Harry.
"My feet are not fat!" Draco breathed out an over exaggerated gasp in attempt to sound offended. This only caused Scorpius to burst out into a fit of giggles. "You know what happens when little boys are around fat feet?" Draco asked with a devious smile growing on his face.
turn off for them, as it rightfully should be. All good things always come to an end anyways, Draco supposed.
It took a few moments for Draco to gather enough courage to ask Harry for exactly what he knew Draco would ask for.
Feeling Harry's intense gaze on his mouth, Draco consciously slid his own tongue against the soft surface of his bottom lip.
Ignoring Draco became arduous when he caught onto the small whine coming from his mouth. If there was anything Harry learned from knowing Draco for years, it was that he is incredibly stubborn and he hated not getting his way. In this case, he despised not getting an answer.
So in the end, he would do it all again if it meant he was to be blessed with two wonderful boys and one handsome husband.
"I can see that." Draco stifled a laugh and glanced down at the few legos sticking out of the middle of the tower. Or should he say
! It was the most excitement they've experienced all day (that is, if you don't count their dessert before dinner)!
The clock sounded more deafening than it was just moments ago and the room appeared to be shrinking in on itself. The laughter of his children sounded like it was coming from down the street, getting caught in the wind and streaming into Draco's ears. He felt like he was trapped inside a distant memory. His mind seemed to be disconnected from his body, but at the same time he felt so aware of his surroundings
A trickle of pre-release beaded atop his slit at the sight and he massaged it in with the lube. He viewed Draco as his pale fingers wrapped around the lace that was hugging his hips. He took his time, sliding the knickers down painfully slow. Harry was on the edge of his seat in anticipation.
"Spread your cheeks for me, love. I wanna see how beautiful that hole is. Wanna see how desperate it is to have my thick cock inside it. Does it want that, my sweet boy?"
The first thick ribbon shot out and landed on his school robes. Draco's mouth fell wide open and his eyes screwed shut as his balls drew up once again.
"No, it wasn't. Those little guys are a riot in the tub, I will admit. It is true that I have a hard time saying no, though. I guess that's one parenting trait I latched onto from the great Lucius Malfoy." Draco joked before going wide eyed with realization
He was almost just as loud as Draco, grunting and spewing out praises directed to the boy pleasuring him.
His mouth found its way back to Harry's member and it immediately closed around the head, his tongue back to lapping up the sweet flavor of Harry's pre-release.
"Don't worry about it." Harry waved them off, forcing himself to smile. "Goodnight you two." He pushed himself off the cushion and lifted his heavy legs towards his friends. With one quick kiss on Hermione's cheek and a hearty pat on Ron's back, he finally made his way to his room for the night.
For all he knows, the boy he caught feelings for could be up all night plotting his dorm mates death.
Draco mewled, still scraping the mattress with his feet and lifting himself of the bed. He dropped his hand to the side, obeying Harry's orders beautifully. His eyes were tightly drawn shut in attempt to ground himself.
"Do you think you could?" Harry's hand faltered against the waist band of Draco's pants. Now that the idea was engraved into his mind, he couldn't seem to get it out.
Harry forced Draco to look up at his face instead of the mouth watering treat in front of his eyes. He tilted his head upwards with Harry's touch and Harry met his pleading eyes.
"Hey, hey, sweet boy. Relax." Harry cooed. His hand moved lower to fondle his balls, massaging them leisurely.
The dildo instantly got to work, seeking out Draco's entrance. If Draco wanted Harry inside him so badly, this would have to be the next best thing.
He heeded the soft stomps of Scorpius in tow, desperately trying to catch up with his brother. "Albus! Albus!" He tittered through heavy breaths. He was already worn out after ten minutes of chasing Albus around their country home.
Harry threw his head back and his skull collided with the plush pillow beneath him. His guttural moans cut through the humid air of the room as Draco continued to tease him.
"Yes, Sir." Draco saluted him, causing a small giggle to escape past his lips. "Alright, Prince. What is your name?" Draco hoped that was the right response. He didn't know if he could sit through the explanation of the game
They were both Captains on a ship that had no end destination. If one of them fell out of line for even a second, the ship would crumble beneath their feet and sink to the bottom of the sea, never to return again. Somehow their ship was still sailing and they've gained new crew members along the way that made it easier to for them to stay afloat.
"This bathtub will be where I fuck you so slowly and gently that we will be in it for hours. I can see it already."
"Papa! Stop!" Albus' hands flailed through the air, coming into contact with Draco's skin. Scorpius began to inch closer, his nerves were present on his round face. He was preparing himself for a battle with the
Draco leaned into his touch, nodding his head lightly against his warm skin. His cheek grew cold when Harry's hand left his face in order to fulfill his promise.
The idea dawned on him quickly and he bit back a smirk. He reached over and pat Draco's upper thigh in a friendly manner, before giving it a light squeeze.
"In you go, boys." Draco gestured, still feeling slightly annoyed with himself that he agreed to this. '
The clock in the sitting room was nearing 6:30 p.m. as the boys played with their legos on the plush carpet. The steady rhythm of the second hand and the sound of light giggles floating around the room seemed to calm Draco's nerves.
"I'm wizard too, 'Corpus!" Albus added to the conversation. For a second it startled Draco. He completely forgot he was present in the room. The next second he reprimanded himself for forgetting about his own child.
He noticed the excitement his puckered hole was experiencing by the way it continuously clenched around the air, desperate for attention. It reminded him once again of what Harry had asked him to do. This time he didn't get upset that he forgot.
Draco crawled out of the way to let Harry comfortably situate himself and patiently waited, readily eying his cock.
The sounds that filled the room were exceedingly indecent. The slapping of skin coming from Harry, the slick wet squelches echoing every time Draco sat back on the phallic object behind him. Not to mention the incoherent babbles spewing out of Draco's pretty lips every few seconds.
The scene of the fridge toppling over and trapping Scorpius inside was on replay in his mind. He knew Albus' weight was probably not enough to send the appliance tumbling toward the floor, but he wasn't going to wait to find out.
"What a lovely lesson we had today!" Slughorn preached, signifying the end of class. Harry was aware that everyone around him was packing up, but for some reason Draco and Harry couldn’t tear their eyes away from one another. "We will continue where we left off next class."
"I wanna see how hopelessly eager you are to drink up my come. To lick me clean." He let his hand brush back through Draco's hair, balling it up in his fist.
"Harry..." Draco trailed off. He forced himself to meet Harry's gaze, which was a complete mistake. His eyes were dark and full of desire, but they were masked behind his innocent smile. Draco instantly knew he was done for.
Draco clambered on top of Harry, hovering over his muscular legs. He seized the denim fabric of his trousers in his fists and avidly yanked them down towards his calves. Harry's black pants followed suit.
His hold on Harry's erection faltered and his vision faded to black for a few moments, his brain short circuiting after the intensity of his orgasm.
This time, Draco didn't miss a beat before slicking his fingers up with more lube and bringing them down between his cheeks. He pressed the tip of his pointer finger down onto his pink hole, rubbing small circles around it. He could feel it puckering beneath him.
"Swim trunks? Wow, you guys were really living the dream today." He commented once he saw Albus sporting his golden snitch swim suit. He grabbed three of the towels stacked up on the shelf and casted a warming charm on all of them.
He noticed the small movements of Draco's hips rolling into the covers, rutting his erection into the mattress as discretely as possible.
With a little help, he still let Harry lift him up and out of the tub and their two brats instantly latched back onto Harry like leeches. Harry picked up the last towel and wrapped it around Draco's shoulders, repeating the same exact process he went through with his kids.
"Fuck Draco." Harry breathed out, his head falling back along with his eyes. "So hot. So so fucking hot." His mouth was talking for him now, not allowing himself to think before he spoke. "You look absolutely delicious."
It was odd. The feeling of hatred he felt for Draco had completely dissipated over the last several months.
"And this." Harry trailed off, his hot breath lingering on Draco's ear lobe. Draco swallowed heavily, feeling the flush of his skin run up his neck.
"So bad, Harry. Need you s'bad." Draco whined and spread apart his cheeks, hooking his fingers on the g string to pull it to the side.
"Hurry!" Albus held his arms out in front of him and grabbed at the air in Harry's general direction.
"Albus! I save you, okay?" Scorpius hesitated for a moment and then he began to shift back and forth on his feet, thinking about his best plan of attack.
about drinking every last drop of his seed and how dare Harry come in and try to steal that from him.
"Not quite yet, darling." Draco quickly found himself shifting positions so he was on his hands and knees. He
"I didn't say you could touch that pretty prick of yours, did I?" Harry vocalized while tracing the head of his cock with his finger. The soft sound of his jeans being scratched fell quietly into the background noise, the sound not even being registered by the two boys.
Harry's eyes honed in on the movement below Draco's waist and he let out a low possessive growl in response. "Come on, love. Did you already forget what I asked you to do?" Harry's voice was patient, but he definitely felt far from it.
Slughorn waved his wand and the lights began to dim, signifying the start to the presentation. Harry's eyes wandered around the room, taking in the state of his other classmates.
And even though he still executed his infamous eye roll, he couldn't help but grin down at the ink painted parchment placed in the palms of his hands. It all just
in his life. His whole cock was glistening with a beautiful shine under the dim light of the projector.
After a moment of regrouping himself, he sauntered across the tiled floor of the kitchen and carried himself out through the doorframe with ease.
Draco closed his legs, breaking the eye contact. He dragged the lace down his thighs, finally letting his erection free. He continued to slip his knickers past his knees and up and over his feet.
With shaky hands, Draco poured the sticky liquid onto his palm, not caring that it spilled over onto his sheets. He found himself staring at the pool in his hand for a moment, oddly fascinated by the beauty of its reflective surface.
Draco pressed his lips against the tip and dribbled his own spit onto the surface. He moaned against the swollen flesh, feeling it twitch beneath him.
He noticed how his head hung low and how his face was beet red. His eyes scanned lower down his body and stopped at his hands. They were still sat atop his groin, but instead of twisting his fingers together, they were now pressing against his crotch.
"Here's a bit of history for you, the ancient Greeks associated it with death and it was believed that there was a meadow of asphodel in the Elysian fields..." Slughorn continued to blabber on, but Harry decided to drown his voice out. One minute into the class and he was already achingly bored.
His legs grew unbelievably weak and they began violently shaking on their own as his bollocks drew up. His free hand grabbed onto them, massaging them with a heated passion and reckless drive.
He lifted himself up on his knees and parted his legs ever so slightly. He instinctively rolled his hips towards Harry, the friction between his cock and knickers becoming unbearable. The sensitive head of his prick poked out from atop his lace restraint and the delectable sensation caused him to moan.
Harry smirked as he watched Draco stumble to the front of the class, knees wobbling underneath him. He held his robes closed, hoping his erection would be hidden while he walked past his classmates.
"Papa, no! You have to pretend, ok? Me and 'Corpus are bad guys. You aren't 'upposed know." He explained. "Got it?"
Draco cried in frustration, dropping his face into the bedding keeping his bum high in the air. His head rolled to the side and he rested his check against the soft fabric beneath him.
"Harry! Please—nghh!" Draco cut himself off with a moan that got caught in his throat. In the midsts of Draco's whining, Harry lowered his wand, letting the dildo work for itself, causing it to collide with the now loose muscle between Draco's cheeks.
Harry distinguished the slight outline of Draco's erection growing more prominent by the second and he forced himself to tear his eyes away from the image.
"Daddy! Me n' Albus took Princess Papa's castle!" Scorpius giggled, scrunching his nose when Harry placed a kissed onto it.
Upon seeing Harry, Draco immediately forgot that he was supposed to be angry at him for swearing in front of the boys.
"Still not a princess?" Draco joked, referring back to the Little Mermaid. Scorpius roared with laughter, his wet curls now sticking to the side of his face. Draco absentmindedly combed his fingers through the dripping locks, slicking his hair back and off his forehead.
Scorpius let out a frightened shriek and dashed down the hallway to safety. He wanted to get as far away from his Papa as possible.
His little hand found it's way to Draco's knee and he rested it there. His chubby fingers twitched gently against the fabric of his trousers and it soon became the only thing Draco's senses could focus on.
"...showed him how to crush it the other day. Mr. Malfoy, would you please be so kind as to demonstrate how to prepare the sopophorous bean for the potion?"
He leaned in until his lips met Draco's, pulling him in for a light kiss. Draco's eyelids drifted shut and he let himself bask in the warmth of Harry's lips.
"Piss off." Harry groaned, pitching a throw pillow in his general direction. The action triggered screeches from both of his friends, dodging the cushion at the last second.
"What is it, sweet boy?" His voice was strained, trying incredibly hard to not be disappointed by the lack of attention on his prick. Draco's needs came first, but it still didn't help that he was excruciatingly erect, on the verge of being downright painful.
"Seeing as that was never my intention, I think I'm doing just fine." Harry teasingly said, believing it would get a rise out of the other boy. He was definitely not expecting the response he received.
When they found themselves in front of the master bedroom, they walked through the door frame hand in hand. Their whole house hunting journey had been an exciting process. It gave them a glimpse into their future. It made everything feel more
As he sank further into the kiss and felt the sudden stir between his legs, he was instantly reminded of his own arousal.
is ready to be approached, Draco?" Harry couldn't help but jokingly ask. He saw the opportunity and how could he
"I thought you came here to be a Prince? You're already one?" Draco hesitated. He has never felt so lost in his life.
"Of course! You go get them ready for me and I'll be down in a minute, ok Bud?" Harry suggested, ruffling the top of Albus' head. The two boys nodded eagerly and raced off towards the the living room, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
Harry caught Draco's bouncing leg out of the corner of his eye and the repetitive movement made him feel increasingly anxious.
"Harry." Draco tried again. When he didn't receive a reply, he leaned over and snatched the quill right from Harry's hand, snapping it in half. "Listen to me."
"The next ingredient we—Oh! I thought I saw a bird flying across the room there for a moment. Peculiar, that was. Hmm, where was I? Ah yes, The next ingredient..." Draco stifled a laugh and bit back his growing smirk. Harry appeared to be more annoyed than amused by Slughorn's words.
"Iggy, Iggy! Fluffy, Fluffy, Iggy!" Scorpius sang out while bouncing on his feet in an attempt to dance. It was his go to dance move currently, but Draco wasn't sure if you could even call it a dance move.
In his head, he was desperately trying to relive the conversation that unfolded moments ago, but he couldn't. He was too busy entertaining the idea of Malfoy sucking his cock to be engaged in the conversation.
"Just fucking go already." Draco continued to whine, this time pushing himself back successfully on the object and sinking himself further down.
It was the moment when Draco received an owl from Harry explaining that he would be home late, when Draco realized he was simply and utterly
"Wait! You have to examine it first! That's one of the most important steps! If the bean is no good, you'll soil your potion. We're looking for girth and discoloration, remember."
isn't a reindeer either, you cheeky monkey. It's a stag." He smiled in attempt to calm down his beating heart and the small boy who was sat at his feet. He slowly dropped down onto his knees, feeling them crack as they bent beneath him.
Draco's hand didn't move to stroke up Harry's shaft. It just sat atop the slick skin with a firm grip. The burn Harry felt under his skin was absolutely devine.
There was a cough towards the front of the classroom that caught Harry's attention and he turned his head towards the source of the sound.
"No! 'Corpus help me!" Draco mimicked with a wide grin plastered on his face directed towards Scorpius.
"Up you get!" Draco's ears caught on to the soft laughter lingering below. Albus wriggled his bottom closer to Draco's leg in order to latch on tighter. He wasn't going
"Daddy should not be saying those words, they are not nice. Don't repeat words you do not know like that. Come and ask me if you are not sure and I will tell you. Do you understand?" Draco asked, trying to suppress the anger that bubbled in his chest resulting from Harry's carelessness.
It took a moment for Harry to register what Draco was referring to, but when he saw his struggling fingers clawing at his crotch, he brushed them aside and drew the zipper down with ease.
Draco poked his tongue out and settled the wet muscle onto Harry's base, leisurely dragging it up towards the tip. He extended his arm out and threaded his fingers through the dark wiry hair surrounding his phallus. He took several curls and twisted them gently between his thumb and forefinger, tugging on them lightly.
He slowly lowered himself and stopped abruptly when his cock began to roll against the fabric. He let out a small whimper. Harry knew exactly what was happening and Draco looked back at Harry with wild, pleading eyes.
Strong arms enveloped him and pulled him flush against Potter's chest. Potter had torn back the curtain and climbed fully clothed into the shower, sneakers and all.
But, he found himself give pause when he made to move some potion vials out of the way. They were from the night they had been handcuffed together and stayed up late brewing them for the trip into the desert. And one of them was a Sleeping Draught.
"It's going to be a mummy, isn't it?" Malfoy said when Harry stopped beside him and drew his wand as the blond had done.
As Harry read, he occasionally cast a glance in Malfoy's direction over the top of his book. For a while, Malfoy just sat there staring at the floor. Then he shifted to examining all the pictures on the walls. Maybe he was trying to arouse himself with the ancient pornography. Eventually though, after maybe an hour, Malfoy got up to pace again, this time walking circles around the dais.
Malfoy slowly opened his eyes to peer at Harry, though his grip on the bar between them did not lessen. He then pulled his hands into his lap like he was about to curl up in the fetal position and twisted so he was gazing out the window.
Harry couldn't help but smirk. "Yeah, if you'd like that. But if you're not into kinky stuff, we can-"
Draco wanted desperately to free himself from this situation. But his bed was positioned against the side of the tent, and the only way out meant crawling over Potter. And...and it wasn't like it felt terrible to be in Potter's arms, but, well, what the hell was happening?! "Fine, you go first."
He tried to combat these thoughts, but either his arguments were feeble or his internal voice wasn't loud enough because the thoughts repeated on a loop. After several moments where he had begun to shake from the sheer speed of his thoughts ramping up his emotions, he hastily peeled off his clothes and got into the shower.
"Any and all documents I could find on the last days of Gryffindor and Slytherin," he answered. He set the papers to the side of him in his bench seat so they were out of the way. Underneath all of the papers had been the world map, which now was the only paper still on the table. "Maddeningly unhelpful. I was up most of the night trying to glean something from it all. Rosmerta eventually made me go to bed though."
Draco sighed and pulled himself away from the railing. He closed the balcony door behind him, effectively dulling the voice outside. While entertaining and a bit educational, the voice was honestly a bit too loud for Draco to hear Potter very well otherwise.
Harry sighed. There was no point hiding it from her. He had asked for her help deciphering the meaning of the image on his arm. She might as well know what he had found out and what he had to do. He explained it to her, giving her as much information as he knew and finishing it by telling her Malfoy was in Hogsmeade as they spoke, waiting to meet him later that same day and make plans to fulfill the prophecy.
He took his glasses from the bedside table and put them on. He examined the mark on his arm, and his heart jolted with surprise. The lion and serpent no longer looked hostile or wary of the other. Rather, they looked curious about each other, and, in Harry's opinion, the serpent even seemed a bit bashful.
Just thinking of needing to get out of the street, Harry seized Malfoy around the waist and tugged him back to the curb just as the car whizzed past, followed by police sirens getting closer.
"This is weird," Potter said, slowly turning to look in every direction. It was no use. What landmarks had been there only moments ago had now vanished. There wasn't even a tree or bush in the distance.
“Erm.” Draco gave a half-hearted smile and turned toward the direction of the house. “I do not think I am up for flying again so soon. Do you fancy a walk or shall we Apparate?”
“We have been working quite closely on the charity ball. I am sure she will want to know everything about our interview.”
When they arrived, Mrs. Granger-Weasley asked Kreacher to fetch Mr. Potter, and she escorted Draco to the salon. The hallway leading to the room was lined with a variety of portraits. Draco would have guessed that several of them were painted in India as he recognised the style from childhood studies. In one, a young Indian woman wearing an orange, cropped shirt and matching skirt peered at him. She wore a necklace of pearls that extended down to her navel, and a large, beaded ring was pierced through her nose. Her long, black hair was covered by a sheer veil.
“Yes,” Draco gasped, taking the book from his hands and throwing it onto the nearby settee. “Gods, Potter, yes.” Then Draco’s hands were tangling in his curls and he was pressing their mouths together in an achingly searing kiss.
Draco arrived at the front gates of Godric’s Hollow around 10 in the morning. He could see a fine house behind the grate - a bit smaller than the manor, but no less beautiful. The grounds were in full bloom, with luscious trees thick with waxy leaves and colorful flowers lining the path to the front entrance. The gate opened for Draco and he walked up the pathway. The flowers’ aroma wafted toward him, and he wondered if they were charmed to strengthen their perfume when someone passed. When he knocked on the door, he was greeted by a familiar elf.
He was curious but was not sure he wanted to ask. “Very well. I have been spending time with Mr. Potter as of late. And Mrs. Granger-Weasley as well. We are working on a fundraising ball for their charity.”
we want.” Potter’s eyes met his, and he let the weight of his words hang between them. “For example, if I were to miss your soft lips,” he said softly, bringing up his other hand to rub the pad of his thumb against Potter’s mouth, “I could open up the diary and speak to how they feel against my own. How sweet your mouth tastes.”
Draco could feel tears beginning to well at the corners of his eyes, and he clenched his jaw in hopes of keeping them in check. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley—”
“I will speak frankly,” Draco responded, “and say that removing the necessity to have a child of my own does benefit me greatly.”
“That she was a squib. That she had been sent by Professor Dumbledore to look after me. That once she saw how the Dursleys treated me, she took it upon herself to make sure I was ready for Hogwarts, even though she never said a word to me about it.”
He was already unable to sleep, so he grabbed the book and opened to one of the letters Harry had written him during his week in France.
“Of course,” Potter replied. “I will call for Kreacher for tea and we can have it in the library while you explore.” Draco nodded and they returned to the house.
He walked the edge of the room while waiting for Potter, taking in the view from the windows. Several minutes passed before Kreacher finally entered and Potter followed behind him. The ends of his hair were dampened, as if he had just recently bathed, and Draco spotted a bit of shaving soap beneath his left sideburn. He quickly shoved the image of Potter in a bathtub into a dark corner of his mind and locked it away for later.
“Lokey, would you please leave for a few minutes?” Draco asked, hoping that Mrs. Malfoy would feel more comfortable if they were completely alone.
“Oh,” she replied in a very small voice. The sound of it — just that one syllable — gnawed a pit in his stomach. Her pity had been bad enough; her disappointment was even worse.
It may not have seemed like much to a muggle, it was indeed a primitive structure, but to a wizard, it was sacred.
“No, Mrs. Figg only comes to help out on our busiest days, and you are my only meeting at the office today. Hermione has another obligation.” Draco looked up from his notes in shock at Potter’s informality. It was quite strange for a man to call a married woman by her first name, even if she were his own wife. Potter seemed to notice his faux pas and gave a sheepish grin. “I mean Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
“Good day, Miss Lovegood. And to you, sir. What lies in your future this day?” she asked, voice hearty and firm.
Mrs. Malfoy was silent for several moments before she continued. “The truth is that I loved Andromeda very much. I was always closer to her than I was to Bella. Bellatrix had been our parents’ favorite child, and Andromeda and I had each other. But when she met Mr. Tonks… I felt betrayed. A muggle?” She huffed. “We were Blacks, for Merlin’s sake. And Bella latched onto that betrayal and fed off of it, and, well... you know the rest.”
“Pipsy has brought tea for Mr. Potter and his guest,” she said. She seemed awed by his very presence and gave Potter an enamoured smile before setting down the tray and removing the tea cosy. She looked downright smitten.
Draco himself was wearing garnet-coloured dress robes, lined with buttons shaped like the heads of lions, and his gold, silk waistcoat was woven with garnet brocade.
“Yes, sir. I believe I still have your address on file.” Mr. Stone looked up briefly as someone else entered the shop.
“We do have a well-stocked library,” Potter continued. “My family’s collection was already quite remarkable, but Hermione has improved upon it considerably. You must peruse it before you leave and borrow whatever you would like.”
The upstairs quarters fared no better. There was the hallway, where he had heard all manner of cries and screams in the months that the Dark Lord resided there. There was his bedroom, where his mother had held him as he had trembled from the Dark Lord’s hexes. There was the balcony, where he had seen his father—
“Yes, thank you. It has been lovely.” She leaned against the guard rail and looked up at him. “Though I am trying to piece together a puzzle.”
“Thank you,” she said, taking several moments to compose herself. “It is still hard sometimes, missing your father.”
“Of course.” He took Potter’s hand and kissed it, noticing, for the first time since school, the scar he still carried from Umbridge’s cursed quill. Draco had laughed and laughed when it had happened, thinking that Potter had finally received the comeuppance that he had deserved. Now, though…
“Good day! Welcome to the Burrow. If you have a gift for Mr. Potter, you can add it over there.” She pointed to a table already filled with presents.
His aunt’s teacup landed against her saucer with a clang, and a bit of tea spilled on her robes, causing her to gasp.
They were standing at the clearing line, at least 100 feet away from the stones. Harry closed his eyes for a moment before opening them again. “I can feel its power from here,” he said. Then he laughed. “Would it be disrespectful to exclaim ‘Merlin’ at his own tomb?”
“No, it is fine. I will not keep you.” He smiled. “Thank you very much for the invitation to your birthday party, by the way. I am honoured to attend.”
“I think he is happy. At least, I hope he is. He surrounds himself often with friends and the family he has found along the way.”
“Please come this way, Mr. Malfoy,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley said, gesturing to a door at the back of the office. He entered the room to see a fairly large oak table, surrounded with plush, upholstered chairs. The table was round and Draco assumed that was a conscious choice, inspired, no doubt, by King Arthur and his knights. “Please sit wherever you would like. ”
“I would not know as I did not even have a chance to speak with her. We could not say two words to each other without her mother butting in.”
“Yes, all of our elves are free and earn a wage. Except Kreacher, who is too set in his way.  Griffel makes the clothing for all of our elves, and he has great plans to open his own shop if elvish liberation becomes widespread. Herky, from the board portrait? They are partners. ”
He took the satchel that Fitzy had packed that morning and led Draco to the parlor. Potter was already waiting for him in flying robes. Draco had not seen him in such attire since Hogwarts and he almost felt like he was sixteen again, subtracting the crippling fear brought about by the Dark Lord’s mission.
He cleared his throat. “Thank you, Miss Lovegood. I will write to you soon.” She gave a tight smile, her discomfort at the situation apparent, and she curtsied before leaving the room.
Teddy climbed into his lap, which was certainly not something with which Draco was acquainted. “Grandmama let me get on a broom with Uncle Harry today! It was my first time.”
“Oh,” he responded after a soft gasp, visibly touched at hearing it. “Well that is…” he trailed off, and Draco, knowing that his professor was easily embarrassed from praise of any sort, attempted to head it off.
“My mama always told me that Nimue — the Lady of the Lake — and Merlin were lovers. They lived here in the Forest of Brocéliande, and after a long life together, Nimue buried him close to the lake where her spirit resides.”
He certainly did not foresee his day shaping up this way when he sat down to wizard chess with the World’s Most Bothersome Gryffindor. He sighed and looked at the remaining name on his list. After several drafts, including one he set on fire, he finally penned a letter that he felt warranted to post.
The boy was trying to balance a blue plastic cup on the top of his head, completely drowning out the conversation Albus was trying to hold. The cup tumbled down his backside and hit the water with a
Draco stared back at Harry, murderous. "Harry, needa come so bad—Arghh—Please!" Draco whined, his eyes welling with desperate tears.
Harry could feel the uneven jerks of Draco's chest as he breathed in and out and he knew something was wrong. Draco's breathing has steadied since they climaxed so he knew it wasn't from overworking himself.
It was clear that Draco was lost in his own world of arousal, completely forgetting the location they were in. A wave of panic crashed over Harry and his whole body went hot. He acted quickly and clasped onto Draco's wrist, putting a stop to his careless motions.
"Want you." Draco whined and lightly pounded on Harry's sternum. He was desperate to taste Harry at this point. Ever since he got a taste of Harry's pre-come after licking it off himself, he's been dying for more.
"Yeah." Draco breathed out unsteadily. He felt the familiar nauseating clench of anxiety claw at his stomach. Draco didn't want to talk about it in the morning, he wanted to talk about it
Draco whined and curled his toes, lost in the world Harry was creating for him. He could faintly hear the sound of a zipper being undone and the old wooden chair creaking, but as his finger applied more pressure on top of his rim, his curiosity fled him faster than it came on.
"They get stepped on!" Draco's voice roared and bounced off the walls. He shifted his weight to his left leg and hovered the other one over Albus' stomach as if he was about to squash him.
Harry climbed onto Draco's bed, hunger written all over his features. He stopped right before Draco and towered over him, causing Draco to shrink back in on himself.
"Harry I—" Harry cut him off with another kiss, sucking Draco's bottom lip into his mouth and tugging on it gently before letting it go.
Draco jumped, feeling the warmth of his professors touch on his shoulder that sent him back into reality. "Sorry for cursing. I uh—Sometimes I go into shock when it hurts so badly." Slughorn seemed to buy the lie and he guided Draco through the next step.
They laid like that for a few minutes to regroup themselves, but soon Harry grew awfully uncomfortable with the feeling of Draco's cold come against his leg. He wordlessly summoned his wand and casted a few cleansing spells, making sure the other boy felt as clean and comfortable as possible.
"It looks incredible, Scorp." Draco smiled, rubbing his hands back and fourth on his thighs. He focused on the rough material of his trousers underneath his palm. He continued this action until he felt himself coming back to the ground, further away from the episode he just experienced.
Sensing Draco was close, Harry pushed himself out of the old chair. His knees were wobbling slightly as he took a step forward towards the bed. His cock bobbed between the opening of his trousers, standing proudly under Draco's hazy gaze.
Draco stuck his tongue out further, laying it flat against his skin. He closed his lips around it and left behind small wet kisses, all the while still holding intense eye contact with the boy in front of him.
He steadily raised his fingers towards his mouth, placing his thumb against his bottom lip. He ran the smooth padding along it, slicking it with Draco's precome before sliding it into his mouth.
"Nghh—Yes, quiet. Please Harry." His hips bucked upwards again to meet with Harry's palm and the other boy pressed down against the swollen flesh.
It was almost too quiet for Harry to hear, but he decided he wasn't going to push Draco any further. As much fun as it was teasing Draco, it also made him achingly hard again and he was desperate for release.
"I have to write to Dad, Scorpius. How will he know how much fun we're having if I can't tell him?" He hoped the mention of Harry would reroute the boys focus entirely. It usually always did when Harry had to go the Ministry for day. They were so used to having both parents in the house.
A shaky breath escaped past Draco's lips and his eyes flickered from Harry's prick and up to meet his eyes.  He could smell the salt of Harry's arousal and it tickled his nostrils. He was
He mentally prepared himself for the blow as well as he could. He could already picture Slughorn's face of pure disgust looking back down at him as he pulled his strong fist off of his prick.
"You can grow them back. You are wizard Papa, did you forget?" Scorpius gazed up at him with the brightest smile across his face. Draco couldn't help but lean over and plant a wet kiss on his rosy cheek.
"Harry, I said I'm fine." Draco snapped back, grabbing ahold of his robe and draping it across his lap. Harry furrowed his eyebrows in frustration.
"Daddy! You have to see the lego I made!" Albus giggled, still clawing at the air to get Harry's attention. Harry quickly spelled the floor clean and picked Albus up out of the tub.
Draco grunted in frustration and stubbornly tugged at Harry's shirt. The only thing his gesture was doing was lifting the cloth up and exposing Harry's midriff to the room.
Harry presumed that he would stick his nose in the air and tell him, 'please cease your idiocy for the next hour so I can attempt to retain the information being shared.'
Draco couldn't help but stifle a laugh at his sons pronunciation of 'Scorpius'. He knew they had to work on it, but Harry and Draco couldn't bring themselves to fix it quite yet.
Draco's took a few moments before obeying Harry's commands. Harry's sultry riddled irises soon met Draco's and time seemed to slow down. It was only the two of them who mattered in this world in this moment.
"I am a grown man, thank you very much!" Draco lifted his arm and lightly punched Harry's shoulder, which only catered to the fact that he
"Beautiful." Harry said, stuck in a post-orgasmic trance as he watched the head of Draco’s cock disappear behind his foreskin and reappear when he pulled it back down.
He let spit leak past his lips and the warm bubbles ran down Harry's erection. It shuddered inside of his mouth and Draco whimpered in response.
Draco let out a small cry of pleasure as a second finger entered him. He curled his fingers upwards, hopelessly trying to search for the bundle of nerves to send him over the edge.
Panic brewed within the depths of his stomach. He was starting to become freaked out at the thought of forgetting so easily and not being in control. What else might he forget if he—
"I'm not mad, I promise. How about we continue to find out what happens with Prince Scorpius and Prince Albus?" Draco redirected, hoping it would liven Albus' spirit again.
"PAPA!" Draco registered the cry as Albus, who was now charging towards his father as fast as his little legs could take him. With quick thinking, Draco's hand settled on the wallpaper and searched the area for the light switch.
He pulled Harry's pants and trousers off all the way and carelessly flung them across the room. Harry's prick began to scream for more attention, so he clasped his hand around the base and carelessly slipped it up and down the length.
Harry's eyes opened and found Draco's. They were already staring back at him with an intense, lustful hunger.
"Harry my boy, are you alright back there?" Harry glanced up at the sound of his name and realized every face in the room was on him.
Draco sighed, knowing he was fighting in a battle he could never win. Stopping the faucet from filling the water too high, he finally gave into the brat's wishes. Looks like he was going for a swim tonight as well.
Harry could see the entrance to the classroom just at the end of the hall and he gained speed. When he passed the threshold, he came to an abrupt stop, doubling over to catch his breath.
"Hey, hey, you stay there, I'll come to you." Harry jumped in, already having visions of the small boy slipping on the water that slicked the bathroom floor.
"Yes, sir." Harry teased. He might've been able to hide his laughter, but he certainly failed to conceal the wide grin on his face.
"Harry." Draco purred, throwing his head back in pure bliss. His left hand clutched onto Harry's thigh as to ground himself from floating away. His other hand was gripping hard on to his stool, so tightly that his knuckles were turning white.
Draco moaned in response, not wasting a beat before he kicked his legs out in front of him and arched his back against the bed.
His tongue ran across the smooth surface of his skin, watching Harry through hooded eyelids. He swirled it around the back of his hand, lapping at every part of skin Harry graced upon.
When dinner ended, the tables were cleared away to make room for dancing. Drace tapped his fingers nervously against his leg while he waited. In just a few minutes, Harry would say a few words to begin the dancing. However, Harry did not know the final item of Draco’s plan.
Potter came with Draco’s name on his lips, a cry that sounded as though it were wrenched from the very depths of his soul, and Draco could not last a second longer upon hearing it. His back arched, pressing him against Potter’s chest, his seed spilling and smearing between their bodies.
When Draco and Professor Bernard arrived at the cafe in the Wizarding hamlet of Paimpont, Harry was already sitting at a small table in the corner of the room. And Luna Lovegood was at his side. She saw them before Harry did, and she stood up with a soft smile on her face.
Draco certainly did not. He had trembled when his father had called him to identify Potter’s hexed, bulbous visage. He had spent his school years hating him, and would know his face anywhere, hex or not. However, the gravitas of the identification had not been lost on him. If he had turned over Potter, the Dark Lord would have won. When he had been fourteen, he might not have minded such an outcome, but after months of living with the Dark Lord in his home and seeing the torture and murder of countless people, he could not have been responsible for that.
“Have you thanked Harry for saving you in the Room of Requirement? For testifying at your trial? For keeping you out of Azkaban?”
Harry looked up at him and gave that big, beautiful smile that always made Draco’s chest flutter. “Good evening, Mr. Malfoy,” he said.
Weasley looked at Draco for a long moment before placing his napkin beside his plate. “Excuse me,” he said and hastily left the room. His wife looked torn between running after him and staying to save face and patch things up.
‘Mr. Malfoy?” his professor asked, and Draco realised that his mind had wandered. “I asked if your opinion of Mr. Potter had changed since boyhood.”
The days passed in a dreary fog. He did what was expected of him: he met with Miss Lovegood and Professor Bernard about the publication, he invited Miss Astoria for tea, he wrote another cheque to the charity to cover the latest expenses for the ball (delivered by owl to escape any uncomfortable rendezvous). Then, when his duties were complete, he would go home and lock himself in the library, where he would sometimes think of reading but would never muster the energy to do so.
Harry looked at him for a moment, his eyes brimming with love and affection. “Then we will,” he responded and squeezed Draco’s hand before stepping upon the dais. The musicians finished their song and, when the room fell silent, everyone turned to look at Harry.
A trembling breath escaped Draco’s lips. Could it be possible to have family who had never served the Dark Lord? To be closely bound by blood to someone besides his dear mother? There were Malfoys and Blacks in distant branches of the family tree, but this was different. This was his mother’s sister. His thoughts were interrupted by Potter grasping his elbow and giving it a light squeeze. Draco looked up to see him give a reassuring smile, but his heart felt too open and vulnerable to return it.
“I was a child when I did the things that I did. If I knowingly allow harm to come to children when I am 100 years old, then please, Potter, take me to task.” Draco turned away and walked toward the creek to calm his nerves. He was angry at Dumbledore and angry at Potter for sticking up for him and angry that this lovely day was now ruined by history that would not go away no matter how hard Draco tried.
Harry opened his eyes and looked directly at Draco. They were so green, like a meadow after the rain, and Draco could happily get lost in them until time passed them by. “I wanted to see you the other day. Hermione and Ron… well they are very persuasive when they want to be.” He huffed. “They talked me out of it.”
“Do you have something to say, Mr. Weasley?” Draco asked. He could hear Harry sighing beside him, but it was not Draco’s fault that his friend was such an arse.
“Good evening,” he replied, tamping down the flutters against his ribcage. Potter still stood in the doorway and made no effort to move out of the way. “May I come in, or shall we rendezvous here on the stoop?”
Draco grabbed her hand. “I do regret that this conversation has turned this way, but I would not lie to you. I never discussed my studies with you as I did not want to upset you.” He placed the notes into her hand. “Please read these. I hope they will provide you with some understanding.”
“Oh, Draco. I cannot believe Harry Potter will be having dinner in our home! You really have made excellent progress already.”
Draco fussed with his hair once more, sweeping it away from his forehead. It was an unusually humid day for Brittany, which was tucked along the eastern shore, even for the summer. He felt a trickle of sweat fall from his hairline and down the collar of his shirt. He grunted in irritation and cast as strong of a cooling spell as he could muster. Weather charms had never been his strong suit, and he would usually sequester himself at home during particularly hot days in lieu of letting anyone see a Malfoy be anything other than perfectly pressed.
“I will chance Mr. Weasley’s ire,” Draco said, holding out his hand for the other broom. Potter chuckled and handed it to him. As they walked, Draco’s eyes fell upon the grounds around them, lined with trees and hedges. “We flew for some time. Are we still on your estate?”
Draco grimaced at the suddenly uncomfortable situation, but stood to greet her. “Good afternoon, Aunt Andromeda. I, uh, assure you that Teddy caused no harm this time.” Teddy grinned at him, his eyes crinkling above his chubby cheeks.
When he returned to the drawing room, both women looked worn and exhausted, with red-rimmed eyes and splotchy cheeks. He sat next to his mother and looked at both of them expectantly.
Draco shook his head, waving his wand over their office door to lock it. “I’ve fantasised about having you bent over my desk so many times, I can’t resist the opportunity to have that now. Fuck, I’ve come to the thought of your sweet arse so many fucking times.”
“So have you known them most of your life?” Harry asked as Dobby took the finished dough and wrapped it tightly in clingfilm so it could rest for half an hour.
was ridiculous. He’d spent the majority of his childhood alone, but he’d carried himself through it with fierce independence. Even when he was able to escape to high school away from Dudley and made close friends, he’d still prided himself on not needing anyone else.
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “I know exactly what the price is for enlisting someone as   prison protector.”
“You’d be surprised,” Harry muttered under his breath. “Don’t tell him that I told you that he has a nice side.”
Harry was so fixated on the hungry look in Draco’s eyes that he jumped when something heavy hit his desk with a thud. He looked down, finding a bulging file with bits of parchment haphazardly sticking out of the sides.
The air was already beginning to cool as the afternoon dawned on, and he just about ready to ride around yelling Draco’s name, when he spied a familiar bike chained to a rustic gate.
Harry looked for Draco in the crowd and found him easily. Draco’s eyes locked with Harry’s, and refused to look away. Blaise was making eyes at some pretty girl at the bar, and Francesco didn’t show any sign that he knew Harry was focused on someone else.
Harry chose to take a seat under an oak tree, resting his back against the trunk. The leaves gave a pleasant amount of shade and carried a warm breeze.
Harry could feel his dick growing hard, and he ground against Draco as his confidence grew, moving his own tongue against Draco’s with just as much hunger.
“I like hot weather more than the cold, believe it or not,” Draco said. “Winters at Hogwarts were murder for me.”
Harry grimaced and shook his head. “They’re malevolent spirits, but not of human nature. They’re otherworldly beings, some of them incredibly powerful and others not so much, but still dangerous because all of them have the potential ability to possess humans. Don’t worry, I’ve got everything we’ll need to protect us.”
Draco shot him a wicked grin. “No, I imagine he’ll go along with the deal because your uncle is cheap. Only my father will knock the offer down even further, and try and rip him off more along the way. He didn’t get so rich by playing kindly with others. You play guitar very well.”
“Looks cosy,” Draco said, pressing up behind Harry and leaning over his shoulder. “Is this bed purely for sleeping, or are you planning on us having an orgy every night?”
“Yes, but I doubt your ability to stay quiet,” Draco stated, though he looked like he was fighting a smile. Harry flashed him a grin, and Draco shook his head in defeat. “Fine. Stay. But I won’t be afraid to change my mind if you annoy me.”
Draco was kissing Harry before he even thought about it, knowing that thinking about it would have stopped him going for what he wanted. Harry melted into him, his mouth moving soundlessly against Draco’s. Draco drew Harry’s bottom lip between his own and bit down gently, prompting a mewl of pleasure to sound from Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes, but it was more out of habit than genuine annoyance. Draco worked as a financial advisor, and as Harry had a lifetime ban from Gringotts, he had to use Draco’s services whenever he wanted access to his funds.  As a result, he’d gotten to know Draco a lot better over the last four years, and their relationship had gone from disgruntled mutual dislike to client and advisor who shared more snark than was deemed professional.
Harry tried to strip as quickly as he could, which was difficult with how much his fingers were trembling. Draco's hand closed over one of his, trapping it against the bed.
"So? Nobody has to find out." Draco leaned in close to Harry, pressing his lips to the shell of Harry's ear. "We could go back to mine, if you want, and I can show you just what you're missing. It can be our dirty little secret."
Draco pulled back, standing tall, and positioned himself at Harry’s hole. His gaze met Harry’s in the mirror as he pushed forwards, the head of his cock squeezing past Harry’s rim.
Harry’s mouth went dry, not sure he had heard Draco correctly. He opened his mouth to speak, and only a squeak came out. Draco’s smirk deepened.
Even as he moved amongst the pretty dolls, handsome soldiers, wild dragons, and sleek trains, Harry could barely focus on the toys. He could appreciate the beauty in their detail, and the hard work that clearly went into every single one, but it was hard to concentrate on them while he could feel Malfoy’s eyes intently focused on him.
“That wasn’t what I asked,” Pansy said, giving Draco a pointed look. “It’s okay if you do. I know you two have a history, but that makes it even cuter that you’ve moved past that and found a more meaningful connection.”
“Uh, yes. Yes, I still paint,” Harry said quickly when Draco gave him a pointed look after his silence began to feel unnatural. “I started it because my therapist suggested it, and it helped me more than I ever imagined it could. I’m not a great artist, by any stretch of the imagination, but I like to think I’m at least a little bit good at what I do.”
“You’ve got a point there,” Harry said with a grin. “But just the one glass. I had the worst hangover the day after we went to The Glory Hole.”
The gate creaked as Harry pushed it open and stepped into a small orchard lined with rows and rows of trees. Beautiful looking orange peaches were nestled amongst the green leaves, and Harry couldn’t resist taking one. He bit into it, savouring the sweet taste bursting on his tongue as he looked for Draco.
Draco had barely been given any warning that they were going on an overseas trip, only a Floo call telling him to pack a bag suitable for midwest America. He had only found out why they were here after the International Portkey had whisked them away.
"Screw playing fair, Weasley," Draco smirked. "To a keen eye like mine you've left your Queen vulnerable and I'm going to destroy you. Budge over, Harry."
The touch went straight to Draco’s prick, the memory of Harry’s fingers around it the night before still vivid in his mind.
“Do you think I could invent my own spell?” Harry retorted with a grin of his own. “Hermione’s brilliant, but she refuses to work in the Department of Mysteries because she thinks it’s corrupt. She’s probably not wrong. I think Kingsley Shacklebolt is the best Minister we’ve had, but there are too many bad seeds in all parts of the Ministry even now. That’s part of the reason I quit Auror training.”
They both waited with bated breath, but nothing happened. Draco opened his mouth to comment when a thud sounded upstairs, and then another.
Harry snatched the flask from Draco’s hands, took a sip, as directed, and promptly spluttered as his mouth and throat burned. His coughing disrupted his balance and his head dipped under the sea, salty water filling his open mouth and causing him to splutter more as he resurfaced. He felt very much like a drowned rat in that moment, with his hair sticking to his face.
The next thing Harry knew, he was on his back on the warm grass and there was something soft in front of his face. He blinked, startled, and swiped at the thing in front of him. As he knocked it he realised that it was a hat, and that awareness made him frown--none of his family cared about him enough to offer him protection from the sun which he’d apparently fallen asleep in.
Draco grinned wickedly before leaning down and claiming Harry's lips in a bruising kiss. He lay half atop of Harry, finding Harry's hands and linking their fingers to pin them to the bed.
Draco’s cock was more beautiful than Harry could have ever imagined. It was easily at least 10 inches long, and tantalisingly thick. The head of it was a hot pink shade, the slit already shining with pearly fluid. Harry’s tongue darted out to lick at the wetness, savouring the salty taste.
First of all, the hotel was clearly a budget place. The carpet was a mucky brown colour and the walls a faded beige. The front desk and the keys behind it looked like they had seen better days, and the receptionist was a tired-looking middle-aged woman who seemed to wish she was anywhere but there.
Harry felt his face flush, and rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. “Uh, me and Ron snuck in when we were in second year. We thought you were the Heir to Slytherin, and wanted to confirm it.”
Harry never would have thought he’d find speedos attractive until he saw Draco in them. Harry’s own swimming trunks were nowhere nearly as revealing, but it meant he didn’t have to wear another pair of shorts on top of them when they left the villa, which would be a wonderful advantage in the Italian heat.
Draco wasn’t sure when Blaise had started dating Potter, but it made his stomach twist uncomfortably just looking at them. Potter was wearing tightly fitting leather trousers and a strappy, bondage style top, and had clearly been dressed by Blaise. No doubt Blaise just wanted Potter as his pretty little famous accessory, and Potter was probably only with him rumours had it that Blaise was excellent in bed.
Harry found himself yearning to lick those drops of water away, and he wondered how Draco’s lips would feel against his own.
“You’re not just fucking with me, are you?” Draco asked, pulling away as doubt crept through him like a nagging itch. “Because good things don’t happen to me, as a rule.”
Draco tried not to let his surprise show at that amount. He’d barely made half that in his previous job.
“I never intended to spoil him so, but it was impossible to say no to those big eyes of his,” Narcissa continued fondly. “He was a gorgeous child, and he’s grown into a handsome man. Wouldn’t you agree, Harry?”
"Relax, Potter, I was joking," Malfoy interrupted."Merlin, who would have thought you'd be such a dainty little maiden about the most mild of mildly dirty jokes."
The sun was unrelenting, the air hot and sticky with humidity. They were barely walking for a couple of minutes before they were both sweating, and made a mutual decision to sit beneath a large tree. The grass was warm beneath Harry’s skin, and he skimmed his fingers through it.
“Thanks for talking to us, goodbye,” Harry said quickly, moving the planchette to the ‘goodbye’ mark and flipping the board over. He jumped to his feet and ran a trembling hand through his hair.
Draco inclined his head and raised his hip flask. “To being the sad friends who need lesbian babysitters.”
Nausea bubbled in Harry’s stomach, and he couldn’t face eating his breakfast. It didn’t even smell delicious like it usually did, and Harry just pushed his fruit around his plate with his fork to make it look like he was at least trying to eat.
The campervans were magically altered inside to make them wider than the usual Muggle ones, and there was no steering wheel or pedals--apparently they moved with magic rather than manual power.
, it’s a group holiday, not a couple’s one. You’re not the first person we’ve asked, so you don’t have to worry about feeling like a third wheel. We’re going to tour Italy, starting in the south and travelling up north.”
“Just call me Harry; there’s no need to call me ‘sir’. But I was curious as to how you got the name Dobby. It’s not a name I’ve heard before.”
Harry heard the shouting as the song ended, so he pressed pause on his walkman and turned to face his glaring aunt.
“Er, hello,” Harry said, when it became apparent that Malfoy wasn’t going to say anything more. “I’ve come to buy a toy.”
Draco leaned in closer to Harry, Draco’s chest pressing against his back, and Harry had to admit in that moment they’d be one part of an orgy involving Draco that he’d enjoy.
“And of course you’re welcome to stay here as long as you need,” Pansy added. “On the condition you clean yourself, your clothes, and your room. Your current state isn’t very becoming.”
Harry’s uncle pursed his lips in disgruntlement, and Harry wasn’t sure whether his racism, or his hatred of motorbikes, was more prominent in that moment.
He gritted his teeth as he saw Blaise place a hand of Potter’s waist as he leaned in to whisper in his ear.
Harry managed a smile. “Thank you. God, you fucked me good. I enjoyed it, but I’m going to be hurting for
Hugo was five now, and he was the first of Harry’s godchildren to actually be interested in classic toys and Harry planned to indulge him in that. He’d planned, of course, to buy Hugo’s Christmas presents a lot earlier, but Harry wasn’t the most organised of people, and the next thing he knew it was Christmas Eve and he was one present short.
“Do you want to go for a walk into the country?” Draco asked, fanning his face idly with a Spanish fan.
“Darlings, please take your poor attempts at flirting to the sea,” Pansy said, fanning herself with a Spanish fan.
“We were both touch-starved as children so we don’t mind getting each other a little handsy with each other,” Potter said, shrugging. “And his grandmother calls Blaise ‘bambino’ and he found it embarrassing that I overhead, so naturally I like to call him that frequently. Plus he’s been helping me try to get some action going for myself.”
Harry grasped Draco’s shoulders and threw his head back as Draco bottomed out. Harry felt so full, and so
Harry was so entranced with his painting, that when a voice called his name, he jumped so violently that he spilled the tin of blue paint across his carpet. He swore, hastily picking up the tin and casting a cleaning charm, before turning around to face his visitor.
“So, what do you think we should look for next?” Potter asked, ignoring Draco’s last comment. “If you decide now we can get Dudders to organise the trip while I write the article on Nessie.”
“No, you haven’t,” Astoria agreed. “You’ve had your time to be an arsehole, though, so now it’s time to get back on your feet.”
Harry heard him mutter a spell, and then the wall in front of them was transformed into a mirror. Harry could easily see his utterly ravished looking reflection, his hair sticking up in directions that shouldn’t even exist, his cheeks flushed bright pink and his pupils blown. Draco stood behind him, his prick standing proudly out in front of him.
"Miss William, will you stay behind after class, please?" he called out, getting only a small nod in response.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Draco said, coming up behind Harry. “I like being this high, and looking at things below me. It reminds me of flying.”
“What is it?” Draco asked, gingerly sitting beside Harry and studying the screen. A man and woman in smart suits were talking in an office, a poster on the wall reading ‘
Summoning all his Gryffindor courage, Harry eased in the rest of the way and pressed their lips together. He melted almost immediately at the touch, pleasure bursting through him at the feel of Malfoy’s soft mouth moving against his own. Malfoy drew Harry’s lower lip between his own and nibbled ever so slightly with teeth, and Harry’s knees almost buckled at the sensation. He realised belatedly that the reason they didn’t was because Malfoy’s arms were around his waist, holding him firmly.
Draco could scarcely believe that the big man out at the front was related to Potter, both so different in looks and temperament. He also couldn’t believe he’d had a proper interaction with a Muggle for the first time and not even realised it.
“It’s called a Ouija Board,” Harry said, rooting through his luggage for something, which was lucky as that meant he couldn’t see Draco roll his eyes. Trust Draco’s mind to jump to the gutter when Harry had just been talking about something nonsensical, as usual.
"Did your sidekicks make it onto the train without you alright?" Draco asked teasingly, curling his arm around Harry as he slid onto the bed.
He’d spent the entire night moping, missing Draco’s company, and now that Draco was back, he found himself transfixed by his every move.
“Just, you’re really sexy,” Potter said, lips turning up into a semi-smirk. “But I don’t do one-night-stands. I know we had a pretty volatile relationship when we were kids, but I think we’re both grown up enough now to put our pettiness aside and maybe have a serious go at things, if that’s what you want.”
Still, Draco and Pansy’s conversation hadn’t halted, so Harry stopped in front of the door that adjoined his room to Draco’s, and pressed his ear against it so that he could hear better.
"Do you remember that day I caught Ava in the Restricted Section, while you strolled on by obliviously?" Draco asked. Harry scowled but nodded. "Well I went to the library records to see which restricted books had been taken out around that time and nearly all of them about other realms, and travelling to and from them."
They pulled away from the kiss when the need for air became too much. Harry smiled dazedly, reluctant to let go of Malfoy. Malfoy hadn’t released his hold on Harry, though, so Harry figured he was safe to carry on holding him.
Determined very much not to look like his father, Draco did decide to put some effort into rocking his hips in time to the music, but he absolutely refused to throw his hands in the air like Potter and Blaise were doing. Draco’s gaze found itself drawn to the sway of Potter’s hips, and the plump curve of his arse in the leather.
While he appreciated the fact that the professors got their own viewing stand for Quidditch matches, he wished they'd made it a bit roomier. It was the first match of the season, which meant that despite the dark clouds, and cold, dreary weather, almost all of the professors and several of the school governors had come out to watch.
“You don’t really think your cousin’s so stupid he could manage to book us two double rooms in a row?” Draco asked.
“Harry?” Pansy interrupted, raising an elegant brow. Draco cursed himself for slipping up in front of them.
Draco had kicked him out of this spot a couple of days prior, but it was definitely the nicest place in the garden, and Draco wasn’t there at that moment.
Dudley shook his head. “No, I don’t know anything about you. Harry never mentioned you, but he never mentioned anything else either, because I bullied him too. I made his childhood miserable. Despite that, Harry still saved me from those horrid Dementor things, and welcomed me into his life when I got back in touch with him last year.”
Draco laughed, bewildered that he was actually having a pleasant conversation with a Muggle for the first time in his life.
“You have a point there,” Harry said with a grin. “When we get back to England, I’ll have to take you out for a McDonalds or something. They have them in Italy, too, I think, but I’m not going to pass up good Italian food while I’m here.”
, Draco,’ Harry said, trying to mop up the mess with a cocktail napkin. ‘If anyone caught us, who do you think would suffer for it? Look at me and look at you-" he gestured to the scar on his forehead, and then to Draco's forearm where his Dark Mark was currently hidden by his shirt sleeve. "I don't want to get you in trouble. Oh no, my hands are sticky."
Draco smiled, hooked his arm through Harry’s, and Apparated them to a side-street they’d passed in Lecce earlier that day.
"That's one way of putting it. So basically, Potter, I thought you and I could come to an agreement to make great efforts to avoid one another unless we're required to work together for whatever reason. Does that sound agreeable to you?"
“Well one thing’s for sure, you’re certainly not ordinary,” Draco muttered, wondering why he was attracted to Potter despite all the crazy. In fact, Potter’s dedication to his eccentric beliefs only turned Draco on in ways he couldn’t begin to explain to himself. Sure, it was an irritated, tired arousal, but it was arousal nonetheless.
Harry followed after him, albeit more slowly so his body could adjust to the cold. As he grew used to it, it certainly made the heat of the sun a lot more bearable.
Harry grinned at Draco, trying to shake away the low level of nervousness he felt at finally getting the thing he’d been fantasising about for so long. Despite Draco trying to act cool and suave, Harry could see by the way he was nibbling on his lower lip that he was just as nervous and excited as Harry was.
Harry felt his face flush; had Malfoy seen all the furtive glances Harry had been sending his way? "Do you want...? I mean, are you—?"
"Why don't you just play Ron yourself if I'm so bad at chess?" Harry retorted, giving Draco a pointed look.
There were also several photos of Potter with various friends, Granger and Weasley featured most often. A little boy with bright blue hair also appeared in a lot, and Luna and Dudley waved at Draco from a couple of frames, too.
The man could only be the Malfoy son, because he had the customary white-blond hair, the straight, sharp nose of his father, and the steel grey eyes of his mother. He was tall and lean, and carried himself with an easy confidence and grace.
Draco pressed behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s stomach and resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
“Right. Right. Are you sure? Right. Okay. Right. Thank you anyway,” Harry said, clearly having a riveting conversation. He hung up the phone and turned to Draco. “So apparently on our booking we were down as having a double room, and there aren’t any twins left in the hotel so we’ve got to manage with this. I don’t want to risk transfiguring anything into a bed seeing as this place is all Muggle, so I can sleep on the floor if that would make you more comfortable.”
Draco stilled for a moment, before returning to stroking Harry’s erection with a little more force than before.
Draco nodded, grasping the camera hanging around his neck. “More ready to prove you wrong than I’ve ever been.”
“Hardly,” Draco said, harsher than he intended to sound. “In fact, I was just thinking that they’re quite the odd match; both of them could do far better.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak but found his mouth had gone dry. He was very sure that he was awake, yet the whole situation felt like one of his recent dreams. Unlike in his dreams, though, Draco could feel Harry’s heat and smell his woodsy aftershave, and track the subtle movements of Harry’s body as he shifted ever so slightly, clearly unable to sit still.
He placed a hand on Draco’s chest, sliding it down slowly until it reached the waistband of his trousers. Draco moved his hand over Harry’s, guiding it underneath his clothing. He groaned when Harry wrapped his fingers around his cock, breaking their kiss.
"And who better to find an angsty teen, than someone who themselves was once an angsty teen," Malfoy added, shooting Harry a wicked grin. "Which is why I would also like to offer my services for the search."
“Oh yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry said. “Can you get a photo? Good girl, Gertrude, he was probably watching you until me and Draco spooked him off.”
“Rude,” Blaise muttered. “Wait, did you think Harry and I were...oh, Draco. I would never touch the boy you’ve been obsessed with for years. I’m a good friend like that, you see, and an excellent matchmaker. So when I found out Harry wanted you to bend him over a table and fuck him senseless, I knew I’d have to find a way to actually get you both together.”
His hand slid beneath his swimming trunks, bliss rushing over him as he grasped his aching length in hand. Merlin, what had he become, wanking over Harry Potter in a tent on the beach? He’d surely gone insane.
“It’s to record sounds underwater,” Potter explained. “Anything unusual could be the sounds of Nessie. Can you get the camera ready? Take photos of the scenery, but keep your eyes open for any disturbances in the water. If we could get a magical photo of Nessie it could be game-changing.”
“Is there anyone in here with us?” Harry called out to the room instead, choosing to ignore Draco. “Can you push another book from the shelf? Or you can knock something off the desk, if you’d like.”
Suddenly a clock chimed, announcing the new hour, and Potter staggered backward, Draco whimpering at the loss of his body against his. He glanced up and saw that Potter looked a downright mess. His lips were red and full from their kisses, his collar was askew from Draco’s ministrations, and as Draco’s eyes traveled downward, he saw the unmistakable outline of his hard prick against his grey trousers. That did nothing to quell his own arousal, and he took a deep breath to calm himself.
“As much as I would enjoy arguing that point, perhaps we do not have to do it in the middle of the forest after dark. Where are you staying?”
The plan seemed to be working. By throwing one party on behalf of Harry Potter’s charity, many people seemed perfectly willing to at least sweep the Malfoys’ perilous past under the rug, if not forgive them for it all together. With the right handshakes and promised
“Mmm.” He nodded before pulling his wand from his robes. He quickly transfigured Potter’s trousers to black, straightened his collar and hair, and glamoured his lips to return to their usual colour. “There. You look mostly presentable.”
He reached across the table to squeeze her hand and gave her a small smile in an attempt to reassure her — and perhaps himself. She smiled faintly in return.
“Perhaps I should go home before any of the house elves awaken,” Draco said, untangling himself from Harry. “We will see if I can successfully sneak up to my bedroom without anyone noticing.”
Draco’s hands tangled in those unruly locks and pulled his head back to bare his throat. His lips trailed to the small bit of skin uncovered by his starched collar and cravat. “Malfoy,” Potter whispered when Draco’s tongue pressed against his throat, and his hips thrust forward at the sound of Potter’s breathless plea. They both groaned at the movement, and he needed to feel Potter’s skin, he needed to be as close to him as possible.
