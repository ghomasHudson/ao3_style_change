But try as he might, Harry couldn't sleep. In the end he gave up and padded down the corridor to the empty kitchen, in search of a glass of water and a change of scene.
“What a pretty name you’ve got,” Harry coos and Draco just about loses his mind because it’s just so
the Potter he remembered and he doesn’t know if he can take it. He knows without a shadow of a doubt the old Potter would never be able to resist a blatant challenge from Draco and now he’s just leaving?
“Wait,” Draco stands too. He grabs Potter’s arm.
“Anything off limits?” Potter asks. “Anything we can’t talk about?”
“Show off,” Draco mutters as he nudges his shoulder into Harry’s.
So instead Draco says, “Well, I’m happy to treat you to a proper cup, then.”
“Indeed.” Draco regards Potter with curious eyes, not quite able to picture him reading leisurely. “Sometimes it just takes people a while to find each other.”
“Oh, come off it.” The brown-skinned man rolls his eyes at Draco as he removes his matching scarf and gloves. Draco can’t seem to wipe the smile off of his face as he watches Potter make himself at home. “I thought you might want to see me in something else besides my uniform.” His tone is playful with a tiny uptick at the end as if he’s asking Draco.
“Hey!” Potter says firmly, gripping both of Draco’s forearms now almost painfully. “You’re not making anything. You’re going to sit down and rest.”
“This is great,” Potter smiles, twisting his fork to gather more noodles. “You’re an excellent cook.”
,” he repeats.
“Too much bigotry.”
Potter laughs loud and deep causing a grin to tug at Draco’s own lips.
The fact that Potter had limped him to St. Mungos with an apparition that'd made Draco vomit as soon as they'd landed had not been what had humiliated Draco the most. It was that Draco, after a year of being so careful, after being as kind as he could, after writing apologies so long his hands were blistered from the quill, it still wasn't enough. It would never be enough. He would never be enough. He'd known that deep down after the war. But he'd let himself forget and let his guard down. An investigation into Draco's attack hadn't even taken place. Draco hadn't needed another hint to get the message.
“There is a coffee shop just down the street,” Draco begins coolly like he
coiling in on himself. “It would only take a few minutes for us to walk there.”
“It’s my bloody house!”
, wait.” Harry looks up at him, green eyes darkened with heat, mouth stretched wide around him. Draco has to shut his eyes for a minute to regain his composure and stave off his orgasm.
Draco is so wrapped up in the taste of Potter’s mouth that it doesn’t quite register the first time he hears the faint little whisper against his lips. So he keeps kissing, taking Potter’s swollen bottom lip between his teeth.
Potter’s blushing when he takes his hand back and begins walking down Draco’s front steps. On the last step, he turns back to regard Draco with one last look before hoisting himself into his truck and careening down the dark street.
. “Someone steps into your life, takes the door completely off the hinges, and makes you question if good really is good enough, if what you thought you were satisfied with even
“Really?” A genuine grin breaks out across Draco’s face, so sudden it threatens to split his face in half. “That’s… fantastic. That’s really great,” he says because he expected Potter to be so shaken from the last few moment’s events that he’d change his mind. “You’re sure?” he asks just in case.
Time passes faster than Draco would really like to admit. His deadlines are approaching at a frightening speed and his work is making progress at a snail’s pace. All of this, like on most occasions, melts away with a soft knock on his oak door. One night a week becomes two, then three, and dinner becomes whole afternoons spent with Potter.
Draco watches Potter’s eyebrows quirk up at him again waiting for an answer. “Garlic cloves. Second cabinet to your left. Third shelf,” he orders. “There’s a step-ladder in the pantry if you need it to reach.”
Potter sighs and gives Draco a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Okay.”
“Tea?”
“Few years, two or three?” Draco echos Potter’s exact answer from earlier boldly earning a sidelong glance from the other man. He’s just taken an unforeseen step in their dance.
Draco keeps his eyes closed when he says, “You.”
There is a faint ringing in his ears and Draco has to take a deep breath to bring himself back to reality.
“What should I apologize for then?” He asks, genuinely curious.
?” Who the hell is he? Mary Poppins?
“Oh, do shut up.”
. It hides dubiously behind a stray curl that dances over Potter's forehead. This man is clearly Harry Potter or polyjuiced.
“Hello,” Potter replies. “How are you?”
Draco reaches to loop his fingers through the belt loops of Harry’s jeans. Harry lifts his hip to aid him as he wiggles them down. When Draco looks down, he nearly groans aloud at the sight of Harry’s cock, straining against the thin material of his underwear. He takes a minute to try and save the image in his head before removing them. His cock is thick and dark, just like the skin on the rest of his body except for the tip that glistens a deep rosy shade with precum dripping from it.
Something flashes in Potter’s eyes but is gone before Draco can quite catch it. Then he’s speaking again. “I have a route to get back-”
"Fine," Potter amends, suddenly impassive and inscrutable. Then, to Draco's surprise, he stands and dislodges Draco's cat. "I didn't mean to pry."
“No robes today?” Potter raises an eyebrow at Draco’s plush sweater and dark jeans.
“So,” Potter begins with an air of nonchalance. “First tea, now dinner? Someone might think you’re a man after my heart.” He stops slicing to look sideways at Draco with a thick black eyebrow raised, damn him. He shakes his head, dislodging the curls obscuring his vision just to have them flop back down. “Or you’re just exceptionally hospitable to your postmen.”
His own name whispered across the wet slide of his lips as Potter kisses him makes his cock throb in his jeans and a low groan to slip from his mouth. It just, he
“Hear me out, okay?” Harry flushes. “After you were attacked, you just disappeared. I guess I thought I understood why. I mean, there was no investigation, no repercussions. To a degree, I could relate to wanting to leave and start anew. Half the time, I wanted to myself just to get away from it all. But I got curious.”
could actually be.
want to do was much longer than the list of things I did. It started out as an escape, a stress reliever if you will. I rather enjoy it."
Everything goes silent as a moment of hesitation squeezes itself between them. Draco can feel the tension build up until it feels like he can touch it. “Your case,” Harry says finally. “Or lack of it.”
Potter really laughs then, deep and warm, his head tilting back as he leans into it. “Best put the kettle on then.”
And it hurts. It hurts
Just as quickly as the panic attack took a threateningly close hold on Potter, it is avoided and Potter is left with his back pressed firmly to Draco’s oak door, large, cool hands around his neck.
like that.”
He steps forward slowly so that he doesn’t provoke Potter and extends a hand for his third lamp. “Best have that.”
“How about I just owl you?”
“I think the goal generally is to fit in,” Draco says as he bumps into Potter’s shoulder with his own and gestures them to the counter.
. Potter’s lips move softly against his own with enough tenderness to make his head spin. He moves his hand to cup Potter’s jaw and pull him all the closer, diminishing the last remaining space between them. He knows Potter is practically bending himself in half to reach Draco but even that doesn’t diminish the perfectness of this moment. He feels Potter’s hands come to rest at his stomach, fingers twisting into the front of his shirt, his other hand still tangled in Draco’s hair.
“Hi,” Potter repeats and Draco looks up. The other man is standing just behind him to the right, peering over his shoulder with concern. The blond knows he must be a sight for sore eyes. He can’t remember the last time he left his desk, let alone how it is Potter’s let himself in.
“I’m sorry,” Draco puts a hand over his mouth to hide his lingering smile. “That wasn’t funny. Just so heroic. And profound. Mind if I use it in a story?”
, when did Harry learn to sneak up on people like that? Last time Draco had seen him he’d been petting Waylon in the entryway after Draco had flung the door open with a  quick wave of his hand. He’d told Harry to wait for him in the drawing room whilst he wrapped up some writing.
They sit quietly in Draco’s living room while Waylon sits patiently by the fireplace, yellow eyes flicking back and forth between them. The blond takes a deep breath and spits out what he’s been gnawing on all morning before he loses his nerve. “I thought we might go out today?” He winces at the lack of confidence in his voice but steels himself anyway.
Draco’s face flames and he decides to skip addressing that comment altogether. “No work today then?”
“Thank you,” Draco says, keeping his eyes trained on Potter’s face. Surely he hasn’t forgotten Draco? Draco annoyingly hasn’t forgotten Potter. Well, he had compartmentalized Potter to somewhere at the back of his brain and sat him happily at the top of the stack of other
Draco does sit up this time and swivels his torso sideways to look at Potter. “I didn’t mean for that to happen,” he explains. “For you to see me like that, I mean. I shouldn’t have worked so long.” The thought of Potter seeing him stumble around in exhaustion sends a fresh new bloom of pain across his temple. He clutches his forehead.
. How is it that Potter hasn’t even acknowledged, been so utterly oblivious, to Draco and is now standing on his porch delivering his useless second lamp, petting his cat, and complementing its name.
“Right,” the other man concedes. He meets the blond in the middle and pushes the package into Draco’s waiting arms before stepping back. A hand smaller but broader than Draco’s own sweeps Potter’s curls from his forehead in haste giving a small glimpse of his faded scar. It makes Draco’s stomach twist in guilt for being so snarky with the man. “Where’s your cat, Waylon, was it?”
is it?”
The next time Potter is over Draco hurriedly deposits his fourth lamp in his spare bedroom and trampolines back into the kitchen before his noodles boil over. The doorbell rang just as Draco had cracked the uncooked strands, sending odd bits of pasta all over his countertop.
“Well, thank you,” Draco smiles with a glance over his shoulder. Potter is following him closely, dressed in jeans with a hole ripped clean in one knee and fuzzy wool sweater. “And you? I see you’ve decided to dress properly.”
After three long breaths in and out, Malfoy reaches over and turns the page. With his right hand. His left hand remains where it is, nestled up against Harry's. A fire is growing in Harry's chest now. It is fuelled by the scent of lemons and a light touch to his hand, and by the body pressed against his, the leg that has begun to tremble beside his own. Although Harry can't see Malfoy's face, he
Draco nodded over at Greg, who put a record on the gramophone. “Dancing, I thought. And maybe the charming Miss Granger could help?”
When Draco spoke, his voice echoed off the tiled walls and sounded strangely far away. “Thank you. It’s– it’s been a long time since anyone’s said anything in my favour.”
“I can’t drink out of this.”
"It's been a lot of work to get to this point, but I think that it's been worth it," said Ron. Harry could sense Draco hesitate, then seem to brace himself to make conversation.
“Cheer up, mate, we’re finally here! Although,” Ron grinned, “I never thought that Auror training would be a chance to have a break from actually chasing Dark wizards.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, as though his defeating Voldemort had anything to with some background Slytherin he’d barely registered until now. He immediately felt a low wave of shame at how mean this thought was. It had been for Blaise; it had been for everyone. They all deserved to live in a world free from murderous nose-less bastards.
Draco forced himself not to look away: these moments were always the hardest.
"I thought it would be like coming home," Potter said, "but too much has changed."
“Respect others’ property. That means,” he said icily, “you do not ‘borrow my shoes’ to go to the corner shop, or use my hairbrush, or eat my food.”
Potter touched his nose. “I suppose you did at the end.” The jovial atmosphere dissipated.
Harry looked up. Greg was standing above him with a tray of drinks. It was beyond Harry to utter much beyond a garbled word that could have been ‘Yes’. Or ‘No’. He stood, pushing the table back as he did so, his butterbeer spilling on the table. “Air… need air,” he managed to say, before staggering towards the nearest door.
Harry wondered if Hermione would overcome her horror of sloppy magic now.
Maybe it was the lack of caffeine, or the bump to the… everything the day before, but Draco felt the cogs beginning to turn in his mind, and cursed himself for being so slow on the uptake. "You can feel the trees?"
Harry nodded. And then he noticed Felix, no longer asleep but stalking proudly, half hidden among the greenery. “That cat adores you,” he said.
The fire crackled in the grate, and the breath in Harry’s chest squeezed tight into a painful ball.
Harry could almost see Hermione bristling in response to the assumption, but she replied in perfectly cool tones. “Actually, Molly, now I’ve perfected the art, I don’t think I’ll bother again.” Hermione said. “It was the challenge I enjoyed the most; actual cooking bores me.“ Inwardly Harry winced at Hermione’s words, but he knew that cooking had been a bit of a sore point between Hermione and Molly in the past.
"Yes, I know," said Harry. "I'm saying now: it's time to go home."
Harry laughed and sat down, content to watch Draco move around the kitchen, draining pasta and making a quick vinaigrette for a salad. The wine was warming and rich, and Harry breathed deeply into his glass. As they ate, Draco did a fairly good job of pretending to listen, nodding at the right moments and tutting at Robards and his shouting. He then told Harry some tale of the incomprehensible politics at St Mungo’s. He’d worked there for years, but Harry was still at a loss to explain how it all worked.
Harry snorted. “And didn’t we all know about it.”
Harry stared at the door as it swung shut behind Malfoy. He turned back to the owls, and shook his head. “Gunhilda?” he said. “Was he serious?”
Draco nodded, and moved out of the way so that Potter could get to his fireplace. The tin of Floo powder stuck slightly, but Potter managed to open it without spilling it everywhere. In a whoosh of green flames, he was gone. And Draco’s flat felt quiet… no, empty, in a way it normally did not.
If Draco hadn’t felt it for himself, he never would have believed Potter.
“No one gets fat. I just, er… I keep seeing someone.” Draco waited for Pansy to say something, but she stubbed her cigarette out on the wall and kept quiet. She didn’t even move as a wasp hovered over her hand. She was probably more toxic than any wasp venom, anyway. Draco sighed. “Fine. I keep seeing Potter, with me, in my future.”
"My brother has to take Wolfsbane because of you. And one of my brothers isn’t here at all because of Death Eaters."
“I half think that Malf— Draco is going to want to put me in order now,” said Harry.
“My mother taught me how to make tea,” Malfoy said. His thumb brushed the side of the teapot tenderly. “I’ve always loved the ritual of it. I find it soothing.” He laid out the teapot, the two cups, a small jug of milk, and bowl on a tray. “What I really need is a timer,” he said, looking over at the mechanical tomato that sat by the cooker. “I don’t really want a bell ringing loudly in the middle of the night though.” He glanced over to Harry. “I don’t suppose you have your wand on you?”
"That looks almost like a Muggle coat, you know," he said as they walked down the front steps.
to be any one way or another. If they want to have purple hair, or dance with mops, they can.”
“I was only joking about you fancying him,” George said.
“You, Harry.”
“It is when you call me names.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting at their favourite table in the library, trying to research their Charms homework.
When the fire died down they went back to the boys’ bedroom. Harry was aware, the whole time, that the person in the bed to his left was
“You were making toasts to Tinkerbell?”
Malfoy didn’t hesitate when he got to his underwear, but kept going. His movements were fluid and relaxed, his limbs lithe and long. Harry wondered what it had been like in Slytherin, if they’d all walked round starkers half the time. Malfoy’s body, Harry couldn’t help but notice, was pink all over. There were the pale scars on his chest, and there, lower was… everything else. He’d never looked at another man this… carefully, before. Harry felt his focus zoom in, and his insides lurched. He swallowed.
"Hmm," said Harry, still not completely focused.
Hermione offered Molly and the others a mince pie, still hot from the oven.
"Every now and then."
, and no one wants to hear about the stupid, awful choices I made, or how terrified I was all of the time."
A quiver of disgust travelled across Mrs Snettisham’s face at Draco’s use of the word ‘stolen’.
"I do. And I’m not asking you to be my friend."
If they couldn’t smile or laugh anymore, it didn’t matter how much he ached to touch Draco or how right it felt to sleep beside him at night: maybe they had been right, all those naysayers who had told him it would never work, that this was a relationship doomed to failure. But deep down, no matter how touched by bitterness, Harry couldn’t believe it. What did they know about him, or Draco? His eyes never leaving Draco’s face, Harry hated how lost Draco looked. He missed the biting laugh of old, the whispered “Fuck” and “Get a move on, Potter” as they took and licked and pulled and moved in a glorious, messy, thrilling rhythm.
"Something like that. Awareness. Choice."
"What’s so funny?"
that suggests he isn't really reading at all. Harry watches, as diagrams and thick spidery print flash past. It is unclear whether Malfoy knows where to look in the book or not. Or perhaps he is just waiting until Harry leaves. But Harry needs to see the diagrams for himself. He needs to know which part of the knotgrass plant is used in the Polyjuice potion. He needs to know when it is harvested and how.
“Hmm? I’ve seen the tea already, and there’s nothing wrong with it. I made it in a pot and everything.”
He realised he was staring again. After Malfoy and Blaise had left, Hermione turned to Harry. “Well that was interesting.”
"Good." Potter sat back and sipped his coffee. "Now tell me, why are you looking for wood?"
“It’s a bit sad, isn’t it?” he said, his fingers tracing all the blasted names. “I wonder if my name would have been burned off by now too.”
“I…” Draco reached out to the wall for support. He looked up at Henry as he made one more connection. “You’re not poor. You’re stinking rich! You own this place…” Thoughts were racing through his head now, chasing one another. “You… you made me work here, while all the while you could have eaten anything you wanted, any time you wanted? We could have lived like kings!”
Finally, Harry was going to be able to say the name that had been tumbling around his head for weeks aloud. “Hello, Draco.” Did the others hear his voice wobble? Had Malfoy noticed? He didn’t know. “Why don’t you come and sit with us, too?”
“If you’re asking, then you don’t remember.”
Henry took it and smiled. “Thank you.” They sat at the little table, neither speaking as they drank their tea.
Harry wasn’t so sure. But he could see Draco sitting behind Hermione, and he didn’t want to face questions about who Harry would go with, or even disappointment at Harry not having managed to sort this out, either. Rather than sit down to review coming of age traditions once more as he’d originally planned, Harry went upstairs to see his owls instead.
Malfoy nodded. “Yes, because I work hard. As I always have.”
She snorted and went back to her stall, winking at Draco behind Henry’s back.
Greg though, looked disappointed. “I was going to offer you the sofa, Draco,” he said. “I’ve found somewhere else to sleep.”
“I knew you’d enjoy yourselves,” Luna said. “And I’ve been up to see the owls: Altheda’s brought someone home, too.”
From the window he could see the little tree outside. The sycamore’s leaves were beginning to turn yellow; the leaves clung to the tree, but would soon be gone. But spring would come, and new ones would grow.
“I have no idea how they choose their names. Father refused to call him by his name. But then,” Malfoy’s face darkened, “he was never exactly polite with any of them.”
Draco asked sharply. He pushed the papers and photos back towards Potter, and folded his arms. “Because I don’t know anything about this.”
Henry looked as though we were about to laugh, but instead he nodded. “Fair enough. Your hands have looked rather sore this week.”
Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. Her words were fairly bland, but he could see the light dancing in her eyes and the smile quirking at the edge of her mouth. “Yes,” he said, unsure about where this was heading.
Harry’s mother stood over him, so close he could see the way her eyes widened and the tremble betrayed by the quiver of the lock of loose hair by her face.
"But every single thing? Really, isn't that a bit much?"
Potter came up on the other side of the pool, turned, and saw Draco. He smiled and waved.
"Oh yes?" said Malfoy, and he brought his hand between them, palming Harry's length before beginning to move his hand. Harry closed his eyes: it felt amazing. He groaned as Malfoy's other hand slid up under the parting of his robes, touching the bare skin of his back. "What if I've still got some needs of my own to be met?" Malfoy whispered into Harry's ear.
“Nor are you,” Malfoy retorted. “Anyway, if I have to call you ‘Harry’, you have to call me ‘Draco’. Perhaps,” he leant forward, and Harry could feel the heat of his breath as Malfoy lowered his voice to continue. “You’ll like Draco better than Malfoy.”
Harry’s heart began to race, an instant thrumming patter in his chest.
“Did I say you could join me? And what part of ‘leave me alone’ do you not understand?”
Harry could feel the brush of Malfoy’s breath on him as he said the words, and shivered. His heart, already speeding, leapt as Malfoy closed his hand over Harry’s. A moment later he held it up into the air, and Harry realised that Malfoy was showing him how to move his wand for the spell. He tried to focus on the way Malfoy was moving his hand, but it was really hard when he could feel the warmth of Malfoy’s body next to his own.
Harry thought about the weeks they’d spent cleaning, about Malfoy using Molly’s scrubbing spells. He thought about how quiet Malfoy was with the others, and how Harry wanted to shake him out of it sometimes. He thought, too, about pink skin and the strange stirring inside of him at the sight of Malfoy’s naked body, and he decided.
" asked Harry. The snake moved its head closer to Harry, its tongue tasting, smelling, the air around him.
“But my mother isn’t.”
Harry woke, his heart aching with the freshness of their voices. He sat up in bed, trying to blink away the images of Grimmauld Place from his mind.
“I know,” Millicent said. “That’s the point. I decided I wanted to chop it all off, so I did.” She smiled, and her face lit up. “I love it; I feel more like me.” She tossed her head as though to show how much freer it was to move.
"Exactly," said Malfoy, and his mouth curled up in a grin, which Harry found himself returning.
“Do they hang in a room with Lady Caroline? I do like her, she’s always so kind to Ruffles.” Hannah picked the dog up again, and kissed it on the top of its head.
Draco took the tumbler of Firewhisky she handed him, and rested it against his chin. He took a deep breath, and his eyes watered from the boozy fumes.
“Must you be so rude?” Narcissa hissed.
After making another cup of tea, Harry headed down to the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. He knocked on the door, and it was answered by a very short witch with wispy black hair. Vague memories of seeing Draco talk to her came to mind, but no name.
Was it Harry making it so awkward? Why hadn’t he jumped on Draco the minute he’d sat down? He’d been thinking about it for weeks. But it was strange, finally being together, and knowing that they were about to change everything between them. At least now they were being awkward together.
“Yeah.”
“The Snitches at school were enchanted to be used countless times, and could be reset after each match. It’s actually quite a complex process, you need spells to clear and then also refresh the memory-forming abilities.” He bobbed his hand in front of Potter. “This Snitch is more like the ones the League uses. It’s only used the once, so I’ve enchanted it to remember the first hand to touch it. After that any number of people can touch it, it doesn’t matter. It still remembers that first person.”
“Oh don’t start with that,” Harry said. “I don’t pity you.” He cleared his throat. He couldn’t quite name what it was he felt, but… he found Malfoy distracting, sometimes. And noticed when he didn’t eat properly, which was always.
Malfoy winced. “I don’t know.”
"Oh, it's 'friendly' now, not just 'civil'? Your word choices give you away, Draco."
The training building didn’t exactly have the warmth of Hogwarts, and the one common room they’d been shown on their tour at the beginning of the year was empty – “Oh, most people just head out to the Leaky or Apparate home or to see their friends,” the older trainee showing them round had said – but it
“Well it’s true.” Kingsley smiled, flashing white teeth but not quite putting Harry at ease. He tended to feel… itchy, almost, when in this office. The feedback from his first year of training had been:
"Do you two really still call each other Potter and Malfoy?" asked Ron. Harry and Draco exchanged a look.
“Only one way to find out,” said Harry.
The nearby Muggle shops were enough to provide for his simple needs, and Harry took pleasure in picking out chocolate hobnobs and other treats he’d not been allowed in childhood. On the way back, the bags of shopping dug painfully into his hands until Harry remembered that he could cast a lightening charm.
“And there are always two of us who get the balls out together, and we keep track of how often they’re used,” Liz added.
“Don’t tell me who I am or am not! You’ve known me for all of five minutes. I’m not the same as I was at school, or in the war.” Harry’s voice rose but he stared down, his eyes fixed on his knee.
to visit me, but he did. For weeks.” She fixed Harry with a steely glare. “Whatever you think about him, you’re probably wrong. That’s what I came here to tell you. During the war, you were brave. He was a coward. But since then? He’s changed.” She stood up. “I would love to stay and chat properly, Harry, but I’m going to visit the friend who
Draco let out a frustrated sigh as soon as they were alone.
“What if I ruin everything? What if I end up back in Grimmauld Place with Kreacher, alone and miserable?”
"I’m sorry I stamped on you. I know I broke something." Draco had stopped smiling, too. "And I’m sorry for a heap more besides." He sighed. "Merlin, we were a pair of arrogant pillocks, weren’t we? Although I think I probably win on that front. And for being an idiot, too."
“Stop.” Potter reached out for Draco’s arm, not letting go when Draco turned towards him. “I’m still waiting for you to call me ‘Harry’. I can see the word ‘Potter’ in your eyes whenever you look at me.”
“Oh, listen to yourself. I bet you think that you’re an
Harry patted the space beside him, but Draco mouthed the word “breakfast”, and disappeared down the stairs. When he returned a short while later with a plate of scrambled eggs and toast, Harry was disappointed to see that the Pensieve and box of memories bobbing along behind him too.
A nod was Ginny’s only response, and Harry didn’t miss the tiny amount of hurt in her eyes at the mention of the Horcrux hunt. It had shut her out of his life just as much as Quidditch had shut him out of hers.
“Wait. I think that we should watch the next memory first.”
“Sorry about that,” Greg said. “But unlike you all I don’t actually have a room of my own.”
"See, you do think it’s corny."
Once his wand was returned to him, Savage Vanished all the mirrors with a flick of his wand. The room was suddenly empty, only a group of people left, eyes wide with surprise.
He woke up to Draco gently prodding him.
“Me and what? Me and Dra— Malfoy?” Harry gave a shaky laugh. “What?”
“I’m not talking about his hours, and you know it.”
“Hermione insisted. You should have listened to your other half, too.”
Ron looked put out. “But—”
“I don’t think you are,” Robards said. “You’ve got dark circles under your eyes, you’ve lost weight, you’re always wearing an extra jumper, even in June, and half the time it’s like you’re not here anyway.”
“You’re not allowed to?” Harry was shocked. He couldn’t imagine even the Wizengamot handing down such a punishment.
“A bit of both?” Or maybe it was something else, something… blonder. Harry touched the soil of the bonsai one more time, hoping he’d got it right this time. There was a light smattering of leaves on his desk at home, even though it had sat there for only a short amount of time.
Two small sofas faced one another in the living room, and photos of Ted, Lupin, and Tonks were spread over bookshelves, window sills and the mantelpiece. The space was cramped, the furniture tired. With the rest of her family gone, and having to take care of Teddy, Harry didn’t know what Andromeda did for money. He didn’t dare ask, either.
Since Step 1 of Operation Get Harry had no dice, Draco begins Step 2, get Harry to see him naked.
Draco is shocked, “wait what,” he exclaims.
"I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!.” Too enthusiastic.
“Sure,” Draco says.
5 times Best Employe of the Month
"Nice."
“Well, you could say that I was really nervous too. All these new feelings rising up,” Harry says as he thinks about how beautiful Draco looked in the dark and how soft his hair was.
Draco is vaguely aware of time as it passes around him. The light in his house dims and the chirp of the birds outside lessen. Then the sun returns with the birds. A dull ache in the center of his back begins to make itself known with a persistent throb that eventually creeps up his neck. Even his fingers cramp as he etches letter by letter into the parchment.
“And now?”
He's so perplexed he can’t help it when he stammers, “I just thought…” He thinks long and hard about whether he wants to lower the walls that keep Potter and him in this safe and familiar bubble where they don’t talk about how connected and ugly their pasts are. He thinks part of him would like to keep things as vanilla and unrealistically benign as he can. But who is he kidding really? Everything between them was always fueled with spark, power, intensity. There’s no way either of them could keep this up and be truly satisfied.
Potter laughs at this before stepping over to Draco’s sink, rolling his khaki sleeves, and washes his hands. “What do you need, chef?”
He feels as if they’re just getting started. His palms are sweaty and his heart is beating fast because this is absolutely
Harry nods. “I didn’t have a reason to come to your door until you ordered something,” he bites his lip. “It’s stupid, really, but I guess I started off as wanting to keep an eye out for you and ended up not being able to stay away from you.”
“And you?” Draco hopes he comes across as polite instead of prying as he eyes Potter over his mug.
Thankfully, Harry declines anyway. “I,” he looks at Draco and back to the sofa he’s stood in front of, where they were so tightly wrapped around each other days ago. Making up his mind, he sits. “I just want to talk, Draco.”
Draco finds that he can relax a little now that he and Potter aren’t participating in this strange waltz of divulging pertinent information whilst ignoring the erumpent in the room.
Just as the first ends, another begins with firm persistence that says
"You don't seem like the type to write romance," Potter says finally after a drawn-out breath.
“Harry,” Draco says finally. The name sounds foreign on his lips but he hears Potter’s breath catch in his throat. “I forgive you.” He catches Harry Potter’s gaze and says what’s been long overdue, “I’m sorry for what I did to you. I’m sorry for who I was, what I did, and for every single thing I ever did to hurt you.”
“Afternoon,” he greets quickly, ushering the man in out of the cold.
The insides of Draco’s stomach are twisting because he knows that his and Potter’s reactions at this moment are crucial to everything thereafter.
“Two. I am in the middle of the third now.”
“Sickeningly?” Draco twists and stands, abandoning his work and nearly knocking the curly-haired man over with his abruptness. “Are you sure that’s the word you’re looking for?”
he was fine. He thought this was enough. He can’t shake the idea that Potter’s companionship has shown him just what
“I wrote it, didn’t I?”
This surprises Draco and he’s sure his own eyes are wide now. “He’s just inside,” he motions halfheartedly towards the door.
Potter’s gaze is so intense and the space between them so charged. He leans forward until his elbows are pressed against the table. “You’re so different,” he whispers in what sounds like amazement.
So the kettle goes on and somehow Draco has prodded and poked just enough to get Potter into his living room. The specy man sits on Draco's leather loveseat as he owns it and Draco can't help but admire and wretch a bit at how quickly he's settled in. He almost looks like he belongs.
, what the other man wants from him.
wasn’t the one delivering the post in muggle neighborhoods.
Draco surges forward and presses his lips to Harry’s with such force he has to use his hands to grab the sofa to keep from toppling over. He feels Harry instantly melt under his touch, muscles relaxing and tension fading from him. Hands wrap around his back and fist into the fabric of his shirt, tugging it over his head. The blond pauses, pulling back and looking Harry in the eyes. “You’re sure?”
“You didn’t.”
“Forgiven,” he attempts a laugh but winces when all that comes out is an odd little wheeze. His tongue feels like sandpaper.
The milk drops from his sweat-slicked fingers, smashing to pieces as it hits the floor. His heart stutters in his chest because he knows that knock though he was doubtful he’d hear it again. Grabbing a towel from the rack, Draco dabs at his sleeve. “Just a moment,” he calls to the door, voice hoarse from disuse.
And then Draco’s leaning in and it feels like falling.
It is in this moment Draco knows he’s being baited. Potter stares at him intently as if he’s daring Draco to ask the question that’s threatening to escape his lips. Of course in a normal conversation, this would be the part that Draco continued their small talk with ‘which school did you attend?’ but now, faced with the opportunity to get some answers, he finds his lips cemented shut. Because if Draco asks then this facade is all over. The rouse is up and Draco will be Draco again and Potter with be Potter. And Draco isn’t quite ready for that. Part of him feels like he’s being given a second chance impression on Potter and he absolutely cannot budge it up this time.
“Completely.”
“Maybe it’s time for a break?”
But Potter doesn’t change his mind at all. Instead, he laughs his laugh, warm and deep, that Draco’s grown quite fond of and looks him straight in the eye with so much sincerity that for a moment Draco’s caught. “Thank you,” he says, before extending an arm to loop with Draco’s.
Draco loves this. Every fiber in his body is alive with the rush of the other man’s lips moving, caressing, nipping at his own.
together. He shakes his head and stands, wringing the tension from his shoulders with two hard rolls of his neck and back.
“Well, you’re my friend,” the dark-haired man rubs his chin. “Plus, when I got up to try and find you a blanket earlier I found myself in a room with a fuck ton of desk lamps in it. And if
a word to describe how he feels and it’s his
time, in
Fucking “
“Well you don’t talk like that,” Potter points out.
“What is it?”
mind, I mean.” He scratches the nape of his neck, “What I’m saying is, you can stay. Here. Like this. You’ll just make Waylon upset if you move now anyway.”
Or perhaps Draco’s made a terrible mistake and this isn’t actually Potter. Well, he certainly can’t just ask “Are you Potter, Potter?” can he? He doesn’t want to seem completely barmy. Potter interrupts before he can wrestle a decision from his mind.
Draco swallows but nods, pushing his plate further away from him. “Go on then.”
“I,” Potter begins, gaze shifting nervously from Draco to the floor and back up. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me. I shouldn’t have assumed.”
Draco hauls him back in for another hard kiss, dipping his tongue back into Potter’s mouth. Somehow he manages to swing a leg over Potter’s thighs so that he’s straddling him. He rocks his hips hard into Potter’s, delighted at the sound Potter makes because yes, he
“It’s okay,” Potter says. “I didn’t,
He’s surprised when Potter pulls it back rather roughly. Green eyes are large and filling with panic with each second that passes between them. “I can’t. I can’t go back. I’m sorry but-“
Potter extends his calloused palm for the second time in as many weeks for Draco to take.
Draco doesn’t know what he, Draco, is playing at but it seems to be working. He just needs to butter Potter up a bit, tease him a little, soften his edges and then he’s going to fucking
“Hey,” Draco says calmly, looking straight into Potter’s eyes. But Potter’s gaze drops just as quickly as caught and flicks nervously around the room. “Listen, I didn’t realize-“
“Oh,” Potter says when Draco doesn’t elaborate.
“May I ask why?”
, and the butterflies in his belly feel like a bee’s nest. Their lips meet with breathtaking gentleness almost like they’re afraid to frighten the other. Its tender and unblemished. This kiss is extraordinary in that Draco doesn’t understand just how one could be satisfied yet completely discontent at the same time. It’s like Draco is starving for water and has just been given one small drink from the deepest, purest well. It isn’t enough although perfect all the same.
“Just the usual suspects.” He sets his cup down. “You can understand the difficulty it is to maintain relationships when your worlds are so different.”
“No,” Draco answers automatically, fighting back the surge of annoyance that rises in him at Potter’s fretting.
And then it’s over.
Potter rolls his eyes and stands. “Alright, you wanker, you’ve had your fun.” The grin on Potter’s face is warm and genuine, like joking around with Draco comes as natural as breathing. “I best get going,” he says, regret clear in his voice. “Early route in the morning. I’m sorry I can’t stay longer. I feel like I barely got to ask you anything.” He frowns at his bulky boots.
“Careful, Way,” Draco coos, using the toe of his shoe to gently wedge himself between the door and Waylon. “What have I told you about strangers?”
When the knock comes Draco is expecting it so he snatches he tea up before Waylon boomerangs from his desk. Only one piece of parchment falls to the floor. He smooths his robes, grey and smart, while he stands and makes his way down the hall to the foyer.
and they’d be touching. He covers his work as casually as he can with his hands in hopes of shielding it from the man’s prying eyes.
Potter swallows. His eyes cast down to his booted feet. The green-eyed man takes a deep breath and Draco’s sure he’s going to ask to leave again before he says, “Never the matter. I would really like to see this coffee shop.”
for ever making it unclear how I feel about you.”
Potter considers this and Draco almost misses the way Potter's green eyes move over his body. He pats himself on the back for his choice in attire. Form-fitting brown trousers coupled with a cashmere sweater. He's left the top button undone to expose the dip in his collarbone. The brown tones of his clothing make the glittering blue and yellow flecks in his grey eyes stand out and Draco knows this. Apparently so does Potter, who's now looking at his face as if seeing it for the first time.
Harry raises his hand to stop Draco. “Yes, I do.” He runs a hand through his unruly curls. “I was so stupid for behaving the way I did. I never should have left the way I did. I should have explained,” he sighs, voice thick when he says “I should have told you exactly where I stood. Draco, I am so
“Thank you for coming.” Draco sets his fresh mug down. “I enjoy the company.”
The walk to the coffee shop is somber and quiet. Draco feels perfectly comfortable, however, without the incessant need to fill the silence with meaningless chat. Potter walks closely to his side. Draco casually sneaks glances to Potter’s profile and every time sees Potter’s green eyes cutting sideways to peak at him too. The third time draws a laugh from Draco and a sly grin from Potter.
earning another loud moan around his cock.
A pretty rose tinge paints itself across the high points of Potter’s cheekbones, an attractive contrast to his dark skin and green eyes. He nods, blushing further. “On my lap.”
“Perhaps adolescence?” Potter frowns briefly but nods anyway. That effectively closes off a large chunk of crossover in their lives. But Draco’s suddenly aware that he doesn’t really care to discuss the past too much; he likes who he is now far better. “And perhaps we should take this to the drawing room?”
“Understanding.”
Suddenly Draco wonders why he ever thought Potter would want to go somewhere with him. This little friendship, if he could even call it that, was only just blooming but it flowered in such a way that kept Draco awake at night, needing to know and see
Henry laughed and shook his head. “This is it. My home, and now yours too.”
“If they hadn't made the offer, would we be having this conversation today?”
The kitten - George, jumped down from the armchair and trotted across the floor, then leapt up onto Ron’s lap. Ron immediately began to pet the cat, stroking its fur and cooing at it.
Mrs Snettisham was waiting for Draco in her drawing room. She was dressed much as Draco had seen her before, in tasteful lavender robes that managed to convey wealth with every artful drape and delicate embellishment. Her sandy hair was still in an immaculate and shiny bob that suggested a daily application of charms to keep it looking perfect. Overall the effect was rather unnerving. Formal furniture in stiff silks and dark woods were arranged in artful groups, and Draco mentally catalogued them all. The Snettisham family certainly had eclectic tastes: the room was a strange mix of classical furniture and what Draco could only describe as tacky – although antique and no doubt valuable – ornamentation.
,” Potter said, ducking as a bird flew near enough to see the red gleam of its eyes. “But I can’t remember all the details.”
Susan put up her hand, and McGonagall nodded at her to speak.
. And then left for the evening.”
Harry was sad at the thought of spring, because he wouldn’t be there. He had a meeting with Robards booked in for the following week to discuss his return to work, and he was sure that Dudley would be back soon. The thought of the long dark hallways of Grimmauld Place made him shiver: it was too close to the dark spaces of his nightmares.
“I’m trying to help you. And as I said, the curse appears to be aimed at the mind, not the body. Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?”
“Draco,” Henry brought his hand up to Draco’s, and for a heartbeat, for one tortured breath in, Draco thought that Henry might pull him in for a kiss. But instead, Henry pulled Draco’s hand away from his face and stepped back. “I–” He stopped, and bit his lip.
“What? Oh.” Draco picked up the kettle. “I suppose that it’s a stupid question, but I’ll ask, anyway: do you want some tea?”
"Well, that wasn't embarrassing," said Harry, his face heating.
Draco looked down at the perky face, little green dress and the white pom poms, and sighed. “Yes.”
“Hermione?” Molly paused, her mince pie halfway to her mouth.
Draco was silent. Harry was used to this, could see that Draco was working out what he wanted to say, and waited.
“More?”
"Can’t I use magic?" Draco asked, pulling his wand out.
"Pansy Parkinson," said Harry, opting to ignore the food and flop straight into a chair. He groaned as he collapsed into it. The Apparition here had taken the last of his energy; Malfoy had side-alonged him to the nearest public Apparition point, but Harry had done the last bit himself.
Harry looked back at Draco; he was so young. His face, no matter how tired and stressed, looked unfinished, still boyish, and his heart ached for the loneliness and desperation he knew Draco had experienced at that time. For someone young, Draco looked wounded, and Harry found his mind wandering to the familiar pale scars across Draco’s chest. He had no idea if this was a memory from before or after, and he had no idea why Draco wanted to show him the scene.
“Why not?” Malfoy looked up, but kept his hand resting gently on the wall. “It’s not like we have any other answers.”
“Hi,” Harry said again. He took a step closer to Draco, wary of stretching his bond with Hermione, but he didn't feel anything so tried another step. This, too, was fine. “I don't know if I've ever seen you outside of work before. Except that one time, of course, at the Leaky…” Harry said, feeling awkward.
“You looked like you wanted to eat him up!”
“Snettisham House?” A high-pitched voice called out from across the room. “Did I hear that correctly?” Draco and Potter turned to see who it was. A large painting, crowded with various women, hung opposite them. Draco was sure that there were more women in the frame than there had been when they first walked in: gossip travelled fast in the portrait world.
Like Harry had left Draco behind, all those years ago.
“I’m sure that Twinky could find you a chipped cup if needed,” Narcissa said without skipping a beat. “I should think there’s one in the kitchen somewhere.”
He stared at the key for a moment before unlocking the door. Draco hadn’t needed to use a key in weeks now, and there seemed something petty about all these boxes full of people, all locked up. The key itself looked strange in his hand, small and mundane. It looked like a Portkey, an object that meant nothing and could be discarded.
“I know you joke about it,” Hermione said, “But I know that you also know that I wouldn’t be able to relax if I didn’t have them. It doesn’t mean we can’t have a nice time together though.”
"Malfoy?"
And then Draco thought of the breakfast of coffee, eggs and bread they had eaten that morning, and how limited Henry’s repertoire of food appeared to be. Maybe some people just didn’t have the money, even if they thought the plates beautiful. Draco had always assumed that his family were superior to people like the Weasleys because they were more discerning: that poverty, somehow, was synonymous with bad taste and a lack of aesthetic sensibilities.
“Isn’t it?” Malfoy grimaced. “I return to my original question: what is everyone doing here?”
Harry waited a minute in case he reemerged, but when the corridor remained silent he wasted no time in hurrying back to the eighth-year rooms.
"Yes, but it wouldn't have been as much fun," said Harry.
“You need to go back a step,” Hannah said.
“I provide the Quidditch equipment suppliers with Snitches of different grades.” Draco looked at the names on Potter’s list. “Let’s see. The Cannons use Wrights… so do the Tornadoes. The Wasps use Henley’s, and both the Magpies and the Arrows use Ogilvy. Sorry, Potter. I can’t see a link.”
The silence in the room was loud.
Henry looked startled, but nodded. “Yes, that would be good.” His eyes though, were troubled. Rather than sit close together as they normally did they both left a space between them. Draco tried to focus on the designs, but as they spoke he was no less aware of the effect Henry had on him.
“I’ve been quiet!”
"I don't know what you're talking about," said Harry, turning to face his friend and inwardly cursing his cheeks for heating. Ron just shook his head, and dived into a query about surveillance patterns which kept Harry distracted for a while. Once Ron had moved on, Harry returned to his own surreptitious surveillance. It was... strange, not being the one talking to Malfoy. Harry felt a knot of tension, deep in his gut, as Malfoy talked and occasionally laughed with the other Aurors. Perversely, Harry was happiest when someone pissed Malfoy off. Watching him deliver his one-liners kept the odd feeling of tightness in his chest at bay, for just long enough for him to get on with his work.
“I could hate him for that.” There was something fierce in Draco’s tone that made Harry look up, that made his heart pick up for a moment, impossibly.
“And the whole Muggle-doctor-Healer story?”
“If what McGonagall said was right, a lot of that was our magic. Yours and mine. The Room helped us,” he said. He thought of how much easier some of the magic had been to perfect in it, and of that wave of magic that had brought all the attractions in the group to the surface. “But we helped the Room too.”
Harry smiled back, albeit a little uneasily, because Kingsley might be the Minister for Magic but he was also a friend. “So what can I do for you?” he asked, cringing internally that he hadn’t yet learned not to ask that question. He comforted himself with the thought that he still had time to refuse any request, though.
“I wasn’t—”
"I get on perfectly well with Molly," said Hermione, a little stiffly.
He opened the door to find Malfoy standing close to it, a pink tint to his cheeks and the agitation from earlier still visible in a bouncing kind of energy. He almost hopped from foot to foot. It was such a shock to see Malfoy like this, Harry stepped back.
Slowly, she nodded her head. “Very well.”
He wanted to devour Potter. Consume him. Touch him like a tree, and feel his energy from the inside.
“The Room,” Harry said. “It’s working again.”
“It’s not the same, you know that. She’s family. And she can’t hold Bellatrix against me in quite the same way, seeing as she was her own sister.”
Harry laughed weakly. “Luna? I‘m not sure if she’ll be there… Once she disappeared for two months. Turned out she was exploring the Amazon basin.”
Potter came out, attached another scroll to the owl’s leg, and together they watched it fly off.
"Well, I'm still trying to figure out if you're really the giant prick you come across as," countered Harry. The sound of a quiet cough made him look up.
“I don’t think of you like that.”
“Will you stop trying to distract me?”
“We can always Vanish the crumbs.”
“I didn’t mean to pry. I didn’t realise that it was personal—”
How hadn’t he seen before that she was like a tree? He could feel her energy, feel that she spoke with her own truth.
On the screen, Richard Whiteley was telling a long and rambling joke. When he got to the punchline - a pun of course - his wide face creased up on screen, as he laughed at his own joke. He was the only person who did, as usual, and Harry smiled. He loved the quiet feel of this program, the way it was a comforting and calm blanket at the end of each afternoon. He glanced over at Malfoy, who wore a similar expression on his face. How much of enjoying watching this every day was down to the company? Harry wasn’t sure he’d enjoy it as much without Malfoy scoffing at Richard’s ties, or trying to compete with Carol’s maths.
“No calling me names this time.”
But this was
Ron looked at the space it had occupied. “It did look….” He paused. “Well, a bit like Nev’s gran, to be honest.”
“I am not
His fingers move slightly, as they remember— Harry almost stops breathing. Not Ginny. They remember Malfoy's hot skin beneath his when they both reached for the book, the hard ridges of fingers. The way his body was firm beneath Harry when they had last fought, in a tumble of limbs and punches between the tables in the Great Hall. In the strangled silence that follows, in the quiet of the library, Harry can hear Malfoy breathing. It sounds measured, as if Malfoy is calm. Or trying to stay calm.
Draco continued. “It doesn’t matter what you say, Harry, you obviously do care about this.” He lifted up the arm Harry knew held the faint grey lines of the faded Mark. “I can’t believe I let myself fall for yo— for your talk of new beginnings, and your bloody Gryffindor friends, and sodding
Anger curled through Draco like a flame. "I’ve had a difficult day, OK? Thank you for healing my leg, but I’d like to go home now." He pulled himself up and tried to stand, but humiliatingly couldn’t even get upright, and slumped back down to the ground. "I just want to go home," he said in more of a whimper.
a tree in London the same way I did the one here?"
“I don’t mind.” Potter accepted a cup and saucer from Narcissa. “I don’t think I’d know who he was talking to if he called me ‘Harry’.”
"I guess you’ll be alone again soon enough."
"So why
“You seem more… relaxed than you did when we came back in September,” Harry said, although as soon as it was out of his mouth he worried that maybe he’d overstepped in some way.
Potter stopped immediately.
They looked at each other and laughed. Draco had no idea what he’d agreed to, but he felt relieved that he and Henry were talking again. He liked it when Henry smiled, and looked at him as though even a potter in the woods could see something they liked in a Malfoy.
“I shot a spell at it. I was still half asleep, but a singing Manticore is a little much at 3 a.m.”
Harry nodded, but when he left he didn’t join Ron, deciding instead to go do some research into the Doppelganger Charm instead, in the hopes that for once he could manage something by himself.
“You have? Let’s see then.”
"Actually, I came over to tell you that there's someone here who wants to see you, Draco," said Hermione, suddenly more serious. "I got distracted, rescuing Luna. You'll have to come with me, she's waiting in the snug."
He realised that he was pointing out a particular detail in the file, his fingers just skimming the paper. He moved his hand away and the images faded.
“He came to see me when I wouldn’t talk to anyone. When I couldn’t look in a mirror without crying. He– we talked. We talked.” She paused. “He apologised.”
"You don’t look happy, though."
Potter let himself be taken on a tour – really only a walk around the room – while Draco trailed behind. The wizards might be snooty at Ogilvy’s, but there were, Draco noticed, all wearing gloves when they handled the balls.
"Potter."
Harry felt Malfoy’s arm make contact with his side again, and this time it was he who leaned into Malfoy.
“But you… you’re Harry Potter.”
“Yes. I find it most unsettling to see your face twist into an approximation of pleasure in my presence.”
"Oh really, Malfoy?" Hermione's eyes widened. "How interesting. I wonder," she said, her face becoming hidden from view as she bent down to her plate again, "what else will have to break before you call him in?"
?” Blaise said, his voice heavy with insinuation.
Draco smiled to himself. “You really are a spoiled little saviour, aren’t you?”
Draco spoke first. “What the fuck is this, Potter?” He nodded down at the table.
"But you can now."
Harry snorted. “Your hands are perfectly capable of kneading. I’m sure you could pound with the best of them.” His cheeks flamed as he realised what he’d said. “That is, er…”
A smile lit Malfoy’s face, and he looked young again, but in a way that took Harry’s breath away. For a moment - a single, fleeting moment - Harry could imagine how Malfoy might have been if his parents hadn’t been so… morally compromised. He saw excitement in Malfoy’s face, and it reignited something that ran deep in Harry: excitement about magic. He felt again the fire that had been lit within him when he had first come into this world. Harry felt young, too, free of all the horrible things that had happened, free to be excited by the wonder of seeing magic.
“This is Odwolfe Scovel. His focus is more on the magic side of things,” Potter nodded at a pale man wearing silver glasses. “And this is Celeste Mire, she is our resident Muggle expert.” A woman with warm brown skin, her hair wrapped in a brightly coloured headscarf atop her head smiled at Draco. They both put down their instruments – Draco didn’t recognise Odwolfe’s – and stood to greet him.
“Eggs,” Harry said, his voice a little raspy.
“Then you helping me,” Harry finished.
“Go on, then.”
“You seem happier,” she said, then sighed again. “Why does this all have to be so hard?”
Harry stopped when he saw how Draco’s face had fallen, aware that he was babbling now, trying to justify how he was feeling.
“You fidget much more and you’ll wear a hole through the floor,” Ron said.
“Dobby,” Malfoy said slowly.
A shadow fell across the book, and Draco froze, not willing to look up. He couldn’t move, and yet his breath and pulse grew faster, until he was shaking. What if… what if it was
“I can’t promise you won’t get hurt. I can’t guarantee that I won’t mess up. I already know that your father is going to
The first week of December had grown steadily colder, and it took some effort to leave the warmth of a bed with Draco in it. When Harry pulled open the curtains in the sitting room, he was greeted by a grey day. The month had yet to turn truly face-achingly cold, but the winds had been terrible and Harry was glad to see a more peaceful day ahead of him. The trees were now entirely stripped and bare, and the pavements had been cleared of leaves by Muggle street cleaners. The whole scene, with the blank skies and streets, felt unfinished somehow.
Harry wasn’t sure that a few candles would do the trick; Hermione was probably trying to spare his feelings. A bud of warmth grew from somewhere deep within Harry regardless at the thought he could offer this, a home for Ron and Hermione.
“I won’t.”
Afterwards, as Harry lay in a state of post-coital lassitude, half aware of the warm body next to him and of the general feeling of contentment spreading all the way down to his toes, his wandering mind was brought back by Draco's voice.
Draco began with the violin, Potter chipping in with a few details about it – Italian, nineteenth century, beautifully made – all while Pansy listened, a small frown on her face.
As they walked through the first of the fallen yellow leaves of autumn, down the path to the gate, Malfoy poked Harry in the ribs. Electricity travelled from the spot he’d touched, radiating all through Harry’s body. “I can’t see why you made such a fuss about going.”
Hermione looked up from her picture of a fireplace, and Greg from his of a circle.
The singer brought his arms in from where he had been gesturing wildly, and bowed deeply.
"A wand, except—"
“They weren’t any use to you,” John said from his stall. “Poor Jake here was pretty shaken up.”
Draco’s fingers began to fumble at Harry’s buttons, and soon he was doing the same along Draco’s slim tunic. It felt important to get past clothes; to feel skin under his fingers. The expensive robes were soon discarded on the floor, and Harry and Draco sat opposite each other, still kissing, but nearly naked. Harry broke off and looked down to see two sets of tented pants.
Harry arrived at the briefing a few minutes late, which earned him another frown from Robards. He knew that it was worth him being late when he realised that Malfoy was already there: Harry knew this before even entering the room, due to the high volume at which Malfoy was delivering his words.
Granger regarded him with soft eyes. "I did bring a Portkey for you, but you can use it whenever you want. It’s a normal one, it goes to the International Portkey hub. I thought you wouldn’t want a Ministry one."
Draco shuddered. “You’re doing the opposite, calling me that.”
Thinking about such things, Harry realised that the house was strangely quiet without the others. Or perhaps it was more that Harry felt as though he were moving through a strange dream? None of this quite felt real.
“No, I suppose not.”
Potter bit his lip. “I can’t deny that it did look bad for you,” he said.
“You’re inviting me to the pub?”
“I think that we’re going to need close part of this wing of the house, too,” Narcissa said. They’d already closed the East Wing entirely the year before, although how much that was because of the work involved in keeping rooms open nobody used, and how much it was due to the fact that the East Wing had housed Voldemort and his followers, Draco did not know.
Malfoy sighed, and ran a hand through his hair. "I've only really just got started on those," he said.
“That’s not my owl,” Potter said quickly. “I don’t have one of my own. Not since school.”
“Brilliant! Is your knee acting up? We can go together if you want.”
“Stink-free enough now?” Harry sat in his usual place and stretched out, putting his feet up on the coffee table.
“I knew it,” he whispered. “You love this, don’t you?”
They fell apart, both breathing heavily. Draco felt so depleted he didn’t think he could have lifted a finger, let alone an arm or a leg.
“Draco,” Luna said. “Your ha—”
Malfoy kept staring at her, but then Harry realised that he was staring at Malfoy in turn and hunted out the butter from beside Ron instead.
Harry was walking down the stairs later that week when he heard Hermione and Malfoy talking in the bathroom. Their being together in the bathroom was unusual enough that Harry stopped to listen. “I never thought I’d see you doing this,” said Hermione. Through the half-open door Harry caught a glimpse of Malfoy on his knees, scrubbing the toilets. The sight was enough to make Harry inhale sharply. He wondered if his shock was anything like how Malfoy had felt when he’d spied Harry doing the same, the week before.
“I wonder,” Draco said slowly, “if doing that would be enough to return you to your original state, rather than reversing the transformation through a counter-spell?”
Something in Harry’s eyes softened for a fraction of a second, but hardened again as he stepped back and ushered Draco in. It wasn’t much, but it was Draco had to go on. One small spark of hope.
"Probably," he said. "Ah, here she is, you can ask her yourself."
. He sensed Malfoy’s annoyance with him, and saw him offering help to the other trainees. The friendships that grew up as a result left Harry feeling that Malfoy was, in his own way, buying acceptance. It wasn’t enough, not in his books.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked.
"You’re thinking again," Harry said, stroking the back of Draco’s hand. "Talk to me."
“Even Draco can’t complain about your dress robes,” Ron said. “They’re new, aren’t they?”
“So there’s nowhere I can use?” Disappointment twisted through Malfoy’s words.
From where he sat on the bench, he could see a flock of green parakeets in the neighbour’s tree. One squawked, and then they all flew off, strangely at home in this English setting. The breeze picked up, and a spot of rain fell on Harry’s nose: time to go in. He’d heard a few rumbles of thunder, and it seemed likely another storm was headed their way.
“I’m going back to work next week. As an Auror,” Harry said, wanting to kick himself for being so pathetic in naming his profession. Of course Malfoy knew what he did.
Draco swallowed, disarmed by the sight of Potter naked. After carting the water barrel around, those muscles in Potter’s arms and shoulders shouldn’t have been a surprise. And yet they were. Potter didn’t appear bulky when wearing clothes. But he was definitely not wearing clothes now.
Dudley’s room, it turned out, was the small one at the back of the house above the kitchen. A flat roof jutted out under his window, the modern extension that housed the bathroom. According to Dudley it made it possible for Felix to come in and out of the bedroom window, if Harry didn’t mind. He then muttered something about not letting Dick know. Harry was beginning to think that this Dick person sounded like a bit of a… well a dick.
The sun was barely up when Harry pushed open the kitchen door and stepped into the small paved garden. The chill in the morning air was enough to make Harry inhale sharply, the cool burning in his lungs. Of course, this was partly why he had come out. He wanted to feel alive after another night of half-sleep. The soft coos and calls of birds in the trees in the neighbouring gardens surrounded Harry as he made his way to the bench by the wall. He stepped carefully to avoid the early-morning snails tracing silver paths across the rain-damp paving stones.
“We shall let Madam Pomfrey be the judge of that!” She shook her head, looking weary for a moment. “Of all the things I had to worry about this year, I had not considered this possibility.”
Harry didn’t need telling twice, and he Apparated Draco back to his room, casting a quick locking charm on the door for good measure.
He quickly scrawled a note and tied it to the owl’s leg, then watched it fly away. He was ready, he thought, to have them over. Then he remembered his housemates. Bollocks. He’d have to talk to them and check it was OK to invite his friends for dinner. It was his home too, Harry told himself, but he could never quite get away from the fact that Malfoy and Blaise had no say in his living there. He looked down at the ink splattered on his hand. He didn’t have a choice about avoiding anyone now, and he’d acted as though he hadn’t heard a single thing Blaise had been saying to him.
“I was wondering if there’s anything I can do to help.”
“Yeah, I guess we are.” Harry chewed on his scar-shaped biscuit. It had a faint lemony tang, and a crunchy sugar layer. He took another one. “We live together. That is, er, we’re housemates. I thought it was a Muggle house.”
“I had hated you so much, and then I realised that there was something else… The night before, I’d had a dream. You had a starring role. For a moment, when I saw you, I wanted something I thought I’d never have.” A wry little smile turned up one side of Draco’s mouth. “I really never thought it would happen. To be honest, I didn’t know if I’d make it to my next birthday: I certainly didn’t– couldn’t think about an after to it all.” Draco crossed the room and put the tea down beside the Pensieve, a jarring note of domesticity beside the grandiose Malfoy gilt-work.
The words ‘NUDE SUNBATHING AREA’ echoed around his mind, as he remembered the way that Harry’s tan seemed never to end. There was no way that Harry Potter, hero of the wizarding world, medical research philanthropist and well-respected Auror, would sunbathe naked… was there? Draco’s chest squeezed painfully tight, and he wondered if he would survive this day.
Harry knew this was more than a bog-standard holiday. They had a whole small tropical island to themselves, and the kitchen cupboards were stocked with full meals under Stasis Charms.
"Let's just leave it," said Harry. "Anyway, I have news: I'm moving back to Grimmauld Place tomorrow."
"Yellow." They’d go with the delicate tangle of Silphium he’d selected for his mother. "But why, why not London?"
“In that case I doubly appreciate you telling me. And I won’t say anything. Remember Harry, when you’re ready you can tell, because it’s yours.”
The food on the plates was artfully presented, with fine tendrils of green balancing atop a paper-thin crisp circle, under which soft, perfectly-cooked cubes of sea bass sat. It all looked beautiful, with elegant swirls of a rich sauce travelling from the centre of the plate out. Beautiful, but such a tiny portion.
"It worked!" said Harry.
Malfoy was still looking at Harry, eyes fierce. “I chose not to believe her. I chose to walk away from her, and my father, and everything I’ve ever known. And do you know what? She was right. No one wants to know me, not really, and I’m fine with that.” The bitterness in his voice said otherwise, but Harry didn’t say anything to challenge him. “I realised something, out here in the wilderness of the real world.” He stopped, and took a step closer to Harry. “I don’t care.”
“So Ron tells me that you’ve ended up bonded to Malfoy, this week.”
With a smile, Harry stroked the back of Draco’s hand. “Yes.”
Draco brought his mouth to Harry’s skin again, this time licking it softly. Harry’s skin was warm, and Draco could smell the intoxicating scent of balls and sex. Harry writhed under him.
“He saved me, you know,” Harry said. “When the Snatchers caught us. He lied to protect me.”
“It’s not ideal,” said Harry. “But I don’t want to let my cousin down. And I like your cat. I can try to keep out of your way. I’d like to stay, but if you really don’t want me here I’ll go.”
“When we agreed to work together.” Malfoy still had his hand on the door, and looked at Harry in wonder. His face was still pale and drawn, but his eyes were alive in a way that felt strangely intimate to be seeing at such close range.
Finally, Harry reaches over and turns the next page. With an exaggerated sigh, Malfoy begins to write again. The temptation is too strong, and Harry repeats the entire performance. This time it is Malfoy who flicks the page, and Harry relents a little. He does actually want to get the notes, because he still has the essay to write too.
“I wish they’d cast a Silencing Charm.” Malfoy huffed into the darkness.
Harry stared at Ron as though he’d never seen him before. Was Ron really saying that he could understand that Draco was attractive? That Harry could find him attractive? Which he did, of course. Very much so.
“And you know this because…?”
make sense.
Hermione looked puzzled. “There’s no one else here, is there?” Bewilderment turned to horror. “Unless— You don’t mean someone’s… come
“The point is, a young man might adapt the traditions, but they’d still be recognisable. A symbol of availability, a conversation about moonlight, and so on.”
“Maybe.”
Potter lowered the slim file he was carrying, and held it out to Draco. “It’s all in here.”
“What are you doing?”
They drank their coffees, looking at one another, smiling, their feet pressed against each other. There didn’t seem a need for words.
A shiver ran up Harry’s back at the tenderness in Malfoy’s voice. He’d never heard it like that before. “Are you talking to the Room?”
Harry shut his eyes. It wasn’t even nine o’clock yet, and he could just tell that this was going to be one of
The room felt quiet, empty without Malfoy there, and Harry realised how accustomed he had become to having company: Malfoy's company. He shut his eyes and concentrated. He didn't sense anything different, but then Malfoy hadn't come back up the steps yet. Or he didn't think he had. Harry cocked his head to one side, trying to hear if Malfoy was by the door yet, which he knew was probably cheating, but he really didn't feel anything yet.
“I’m pleased for you, Harry, I am. I saw the way he was looking at you, too.”
“And he lived as a Muggle for a few years,” Harry said, feeling that he should defend Draco, too.
Now the anagram that ended the program was on the screen. Harry wasn’t quite sure how half an hour had passed so quickly, but it had. He hadn’t a hope of untangling the letters, but the conundrum in his life was sitting beside him. Draco was a mystery.
“I know,” Harry said. He wanted to talk about children and home and what it meant, to be here in this house with Draco. The realisation shocked him: he’d been avoiding sensitive subjects for so long. “I… I think I can, now.”
“There isn’t!”
“You can dance a whole lot better than Potty, here,” Draco said. “Besides, he needs to learn how to lead, and leading someone who can’t dance is such a courteous thing to do. If you can do that,” Draco said, reaching his hand out to Harry, “You can fit in just about anywhere.”
"Some of this wood is magical. I mean, these trees, this part of the woods."
“All the magic we practised,” Harry said, “it was like it was fuel, helping to rebuild its own magic. And, er, it doesn’t look the same as before.”
Coming back to school had felt different. He felt rested in a way he hadn’t after the summer. He had a family.
“Number three.” Malfoy turned his sharp little face up at Harry, and Harry was reminded of the ferret from fourth year. He hid a smile, channelling all his Auror-learnt skills into keep his face schooled in an expression of bland interest. “All personal belongings, including food, must be kept on or in the allotted shelf, cupboard, or room.
Harry turned away from them, and away from Draco’s fast-retreating back.
, Potter."
“I’m not eating eggs every day.”
" screamed Walburga. Harry cast a Silencing Charm, and Malfoy tightened his grip on his arm.
, of course. But he could see how that confidence could be… attractive. Remembering all of Potter’s conquests put things in perspective. The
Lavender smiled, and squeezed Parvati’s hand. “It’s strange, I’ve got these,” she touched her face with her free hand, “and everything else I’ve got to deal with after the attack, and yet some things in life are easier. Simpler.”
Harry suspected that saying he’d leave it to the morning would not go down well. He washed up, sloppily, and left the plate and cutlery to dry. The takeaway containers he binned, although he did notice that one had been sitting in a rim of spilt oil. The yellow oil, bright with turmeric, had left a stain on the worktop. Bollocks. But the kitchen was already such a nightmare of shelves and windmills he was sure no one would care. Not even Malfoy could be precious about a room this ugly.
here.”
No matter how much he tried though, he couldn’t make sense of any of it. His scalp still tingled with the imagined pressure of Malfoy’s hand pulling on his hair, and nothing made sense to Harry in that moment.
"No. It’s about the trees."
The only compensating factor was that he and Henry had to stand side by side at the sink. Henry was warm, and his body solid. He smelt of sweat and wood smoke and although some part of Draco whispered, “Filthy,” to himself, the rest of him quite liked it. Henry was just so undeniably… a man. He was nothing like the primped and scented men and women of his parents’ acquaintance. In fact, he was far closer to the men Draco secretly day dreamed about: Quidditch players, all muscle and sweat and determination.
Draco gave Harry a heavy look. “That doesn’t count, not from you. Are you going to expect me to start calling you Harry, too?”
“Theories?” Harry said. What had they been discussing when he, Ron, and Blaise had been looking at the hexed floorboard in the hallway? Ron had some ideas about counter charms that might work, and for a while the hall had been lit up like a Christmas tree while they tried a few of them out. This conversation between Hermione and Pansy on the topic of theories sounded like something to worry about; they were both still looking rather smug.
Neither spoke. Felix came in, curled up in a sunbeam on the floor, then promptly fell asleep. A car drove by outside. Harry could feel a slight chill from the draughty window.
That night, Draco slept with Harry under the stars. First though, they took off all their clothes, and Draco rode Harry, slowly and deliberately.
"We did," Potter said, and Draco wondered if he remembered that quiet day by the lake, too.
“Counter-spell?”
“Don’t even get me started on the strange distinctions between all of these groups. I’m still trying to work them all out.”
“Strong enough to stand your teaspoon up in, I know,” said George. “Some things just go together perfectly don’t they?”
Not Malfoy, Draco, Harry reminded himself. Hestia had been quite clear about the name issue.
“I think,” Harry muttered back to Malfoy, “that our friends are getting on with each other.” He surveyed the room. “At least Blaise has clothes on?” he added, trying to make the best of the situation.
“I know. Just one with an ugly scar on his arm. But what does this tell us about the violin?”
“No,” he said. “It will never happen.”
“Look, I’m staying in London this week. What do you say to us working together to clear our names?”
“For breakfast, Malfoy, not for three bloody meals a day.”
“It’s Draco.” Harry smiled, and glanced up to the ceiling. “He… he makes me happy.”
“If he is I bet McGonagall would consider paying him not to,” said Anthony. He rubbed his hands together to warm them in front of the fire, having to bend his tall frame to reach. “He’d sell out every weekend.”
"No."
"I will sort your house for you, Potter," said Malfoy. Harry was about to protest that he really didn't need him to say where he should sleep, when Malfoy shook his head. "I mean that I'm going to work out what this curse is." He put his cup down and rubbed at his forehead with his long fingers for a moment. "Although at the moment, I don't understand why you've had these things falling down." He looked up at Harry, and raised an eyebrow in question. "Unless you've been faking it to get some attention?" he asked. Harry wasn't sure if he was serious or not.
"I’m fine," he called back. He found a rock at the water’s edge at the shaded side of the pool. "I’ll just sit here."
Harry’s cheeks heated at the suggestion in her words. He saw again cold stone and a hot mouth, but pushed the image away. “I can’t believe I have to say this, but you do know that nothing’s happening, right?”
"I care about Harry, and you and he are… well, doing whatever you’re doing. I guess… truce?"
Draco is in his narrow bed, his eyes half-closed in the dim light of the tent. His body feels heavy, as sleep comes to claim him. Just before he falls asleep entirely, he watches as Potter enters the tent and removes his horrible Muggle trainers, his socks, his jeans. Standing there in his boxers and a sweaty t-shirt, he looks strangely pathetic. He glances quickly over at Draco, then takes his glasses off and pulls the t-shirt over his head, revealing a torso that is pale and scarred. It is reassuring to see that the great hero is human. Draco closes his eyes, and drifts into sleep.
When he returned home with his latest book under his arm, it was to a scene of chaos. Water was gushing down the stairs, like a carpeted waterfall. Harry was rather tempted to close the front door and come back again later, but unfortunately Greg saw him before he had a chance to actually do it.
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy, it seemed, was going to be that housemate. Zabini avoided meeting his gaze. “Yes,” he said, “I did: love the cat, don’t be naked, tidy up after yourself.”
“I’d like to explore Teddy’s Harry Potter collection some more. Did you know he had a scar-shaped cushion, a picture book about your life, playing cards with you and your friends on them, a pair of glasses like yours but with blank glass in them, and at least five different dolls—”
Harry wrapped his hands around his own almost too-hot cup. He wanted this, he wanted her to push. They both knew that Harry didn’t pop in to see Hermione while she was working. Harry found though, that he couldn’t find the words to explain any of it.
"Are you touching my cock with your tree-magic?"
. It was probably nothing. A report on the incident in Room 8. Except that there weren’t any of the heavy black lines of a Ministry report. His name got written everywhere. But this was in Draco’s handwriting, and Harry’s chest felt tight.
“Is it always like that, then,” Hermione said. “You and Malfoy?”
"Oh!" said Harry. Suddenly he imagined a home with no corners which refused to light up, no drawers snapping shut on his fingers, no strangely locked doors. "Actually, that sounds kind of... brilliant," he said, looking up and smiling at Malfoy.
At the name Malfoy, the man’s head shot up, but he didn’t say anything. After a beat, he extended his hand. "I am Guillaume."
"Your mum told me you were safe," said Greg. "Don’t worry, I haven’t been sitting up nights worrying about you."
Wednesday dawned fair and clear, and Harry decided to walk to work, leaving Malfoy behind to plan his next step. It was early enough for the streets to be relatively quiet, and he was in good mood when he arrived at the Ministry. This feeling of all being well with the world lasted until exactly quarter past ten, which was the time Robards called him into his office.
. He shivered.
“No,” said Harry. “I’m not. It’s like… there’s a part of me that feels tired. Grown up. It just wants to hide away, not talk to anyone.” He thought about how much he’d wanted to sleep, after the battle. “But there’s another part of me that wants to be young - that knows I am still young - that wants to have fun. It’s just… It’s hard.”
“Why?” Malfoy backed away in suspicion.
“But my father is not here,” Draco said, his fingers tight by his side. “He buggered off to South America with most of our money and left mother and I here to rot. He aligned himself with an utterly mad monster who filled our home with torture and death.” He took a shaky breath, keeping his eyes fixed on the portrait. “I’d rather work with this scruffy carpenter than the kind of pure-blooded traditionalist who thinks that blackmailing her employees is an acceptable way to behave.”
Draco swallowed, bracing for the inevitable rejection to follow.
“The Wizard Who Lived Twice.”
“I did.” Draco leaned in close, until Harry could feel his breath on his cheek. “We should go for a walk to get a better look.”
he will be safe.”
When Harry opened his eyes, he saw Draco, watching him. The room looked different though. He shook his head, and began to walk. He could feel the muscle and sinew move with him; he felt free, in a way he had never known before. Looking around with a deer’s eyes: he could see currents of magic weaving in and out of the branches above.
“Like what?” The shaky feeling was growing into something closer to anger, but Harry tried to keep his temper under control. Susan was suspicious of the Slytherins, but Harry could understand why. He made an attempt to keep things light. “She doesn’t seem the type of person to go for Amortentia.” Harry picked up his tea and sniffed it. “Smells like tea to me.”
“You don’t have to be friends with him. But maybe both of you need to have a chance to talk about this. To listen to what the other one has to say.”
"Oh?" said Draco, looking interested. Harry instantly knew that they too, would be getting one. George ignored Draco.
There was a defiant glint to Malfoy’s eyes as he answered. “No. But I didn’t set the curse, before you ask. It’s– when I saw you stuck to that woman, I knew that I couldn’t let you get stuck to just anyone. And I– I wanted to know if I had imagined it all. I wanted to know if you could like me. Or maybe… maybe I just wanted to get to know you a bit better, to cure me of this stupid crush.”
There was a long heartbeat before Harry heard and felt Malfoy's chuckle.
“You’ve been so kind.” Harry smiled. “Thank you for welcoming me into your family. But I’m nineteen now, and I need to – I want to – live on my own.”
After a couple of long, deep breaths, Harry forced himself to turn away from where he could see Malfoy. Instead, he tried to listen to the long and involved conversation Neville and Zabini were having about plants.
“Spells? There’s more than one flesh memory spell?”
“Hello,” Greg Goyle said. He stared down at his feet, his bulk seeming to fill the hallway so there was no space for anyone else. “Luna said I could come here.” His clothes, Harry noticed, were filthy and a little torn. “I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
“And what about you, Harry?” She asked softly. “There’s something going on for you, isn’t there?”
“We should get out of this cold,” Draco said. Harry nodded, and after only a brief moment’s thought Apparated them straight to their bedroom at Grimmauld Place. He tripped, and Draco caught him, holding on tight.
"What time is it?" Draco was still in bed, Potter having shaken him awake to a grey room and a frowning face.
“I–” What could he say? “Thanks.”
Draco stared steadily at him, as though seeing him again in his underwear, until Harry felt a blush rising.
“We both are,” Harry said. “Wait a second, how do you get in? You’re not a prefect anymore.”
His marbles! Of course: he could give Draco one, and he could send him messages like that.
“Not the numbers, you numbskull, your tea-making skills.”
Draco’s project, it turned out, was some kind of timer that gradually changed colour before warbling like a song bird. It reminded Harry a bit of his alarm clock, in a much gentler incarnation; although the thought that any of the Blacks would have tampered with a mere Muggle artefact was laughable. Harry was pretty sure that his alarm clock had been hand-made by artisan wizards in the depths of Switzerland.
A loud whispering broke out in class. Beside him, Hermione put up her hand. He turned to see her face pulled into a slight frown, as though confused by something.
“That would be helpful, thank you. Four minutes should do.” Something crossed Malfoy’s face, a look of regret or perhaps longing when Harry pulled out his wand. As quickly as it appeared, though, it was gone. “Let’s go in the other room,” Malfoy glanced at the walls. “Even though these are Muggle tiles I keep expecting the windmills to start turning.”
It was a good to get stuck into something other than writing up old cases, and Harry relaxed easily into Ron’s company. He was still feeling restless about the bond, even though his day so far had been quite pleasant. It had still managed to disrupt his usual routine, and keep him from the more active, out-and-about, part of his work. He just wanted it to be over.
When they left, Draco went to find Pansy in the kitchen. She had finished her tea, and was sitting up on the worktop.
“Do you feel that, when we touch?” Harry said. “Every touch of your skin is like lightning to me.” He reached out, touched the back of Draco’s hand. Draco snatched his hand away, and Harry sighed. “Why won’t you call me by my name? Why won't you call me ‘Harry’?
," said Malfoy, his wand tracking an angular shape through the air.
Harry thought about the room they had visited that morning: it was just as run-down as any of the others, with a faded rug on the floor and torn paper on the walls.
A unicorn hair.
“It’s like being back in bloody Potions with that friend of yours who always blew things up.”
Draco half expected to see Minty wring her hands, but instead she shook her head. “No, sirs, I cannot. I did see it in the dining room, but then I found it gone the next morning.”
“Depravity!”
Draco nodded. “She said that the easiest self-transformations were where we use some part of ourselves, something that chimes with who we are.”
, Potter," said Malfoy, and he marched up the stairs, leaving Harry smiling to himself. And not surreptitiously checking out Malfoy's arse – also neat – as it moved with each step, beautifully framed by his tailored trousers. Definitely not doing that.
“Harry! Draco! Fancy seeing you here.” She huffed and clutched her side. “Have you been to see the Snidgets? Aren’t they wonderful? Harry, you didn’t tell me that you were interested in them.”
“No? What changed?”
“Watching TV? Have you worked out how to do the numbers?”
"Oh Merlin, and you fell for him, and then had to leave him behind to finish learning how to make wands?" Millicent said, understanding and concern written all over her face.
“Well… it seems that doing magic in here - learning magic - seems to help the Room.”
He remained quiet over the week’s stay, trying not to notice Ginny laughing and relaxed and seemingly unaffected by their break up. But what he couldn’t admit – barely to himself, let alone anyone else –  was that a great deal of his quiet mood was also because she was so happy with her Quidditch team. He was envious of her passion, for having found a place she truly fitted in. Harry had thought that
"Hogwarts isn’t home anymore," Draco said. "But then, I don’t think anywhere is."
"You are."
Draco froze mid-suck, and he turned to glare at Harry, and Harry grinned, satisfied he’d got his revenge.
"I know these trees," Draco said as they passed through a stand of slender birch trees. He stopped and held onto one while he took a couple of deep lungfuls of air. "Birch. Pretty." The words came out in breathy gasps, and Draco cursed himself for showing how weak he was feeling. He was falling behind Potter, again. Damn his sore body and painful, shaky leg.
a children’s game!” Ron came to sit next to Hermione. “But it does look like fun. Can I spin the spinner next?” He gave it a flick with his finger. “Er, ‘Mione, whose go is it next?”
“I—Yes, that would be good.”
“Have you ever stopped to think that maybe she was right to call it a day when she did?” Ron’s words stopped Harry dead.
“If it turns out that you live up to all the hype…” Malfoy trailed off, and sighed. “I guess you already have, though, haven’t you?”
Every one of the cards he picked up contained incorrect facts, ridiculous histories, and laughable information.
“Do you really think that people will forget so fast?”
"Right," said Ron, as he wiped his face with a handkerchief covered in flashing purple 'W's, which Harry presumed George had given him. "Actually, I think Hermione has a theory about it..."
“This used to be the dining room, but it made more sense like this. I’ll show you the old sitting room when we go upstairs. I—” Harry didn’t really want to have to go in there again. “It’s the only room free, for you that is. But… you might not want to sleep in there. You can decide for yourself.”
Even with Ernie and Anthony there, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about kissing Draco.
“It feels risky, I understand that,” Hermione said. “But sometimes it’s worth the risk.”
Harry harrumphed.
"But Voldemort—"
“No?”
“Don’t change the subject.” Pansy sat back and blew smoke out, her glass of wine untouched. “I want to know what’s wrong.”
“I think it’s safe to say ‘been there, done that’. It’s quite nice
Hermione wrinkled her nose. “Harry,” she said. “Who knows where that owl has been.”
Did Malfoy feel guilt? Harry didn’t know. Maybe he was merely scared of being hexed. It was possible that he’d already been hexed plenty, by strangers on the street. Or perhaps Death Eaters enjoyed practising their Unforgivables on any young person who happened to be around.
“A little consulting.” Potter turned in his chair to look at Sarah. “Also I really do need a personal physician with good knowledge of both worlds.” The warmth came back to his voice, to his face, as he gave her a small smile. The frown didn’t leave her face.
“There’s nothing going on. I—”
Harry gave them the choice of the two rooms on the floor above his. They chose the one facing the garden. “I’m sorry it’s not much,” he said. “I’ve fixed the windows, but the bed’s a bit old and—”
The worst thing was how damn understanding Potter sounded each time. At this rate, Draco would have ground his teeth flat by the time they reached Potter’s shack. He did, however, need a rest. Even if he resented Potter having to look after him like this. This time, instead of saying he was fine, he nodded and slid with no grace at all into a sitting position on the ground.
"Mmmm," said Draco. Words seemed to difficult to make. He lay down on the bed, and Harry curled up beside him. Draco drifted off to sleep, warm and safe, and home.
“Yes. Father was so angry that you tricked him into freeing him.”
He had come in his dream with a muffled groan, the air stinging as he sucked it back into his ragged lungs. The fucking had continued, each rub of the wood on his cock a torture of sensation, until the other man had come and lowered his head to kiss Draco on the back. The two of them had slid down to the stone floor, and kissed again. They pulled back and looked at each other, satisfied grins on their faces.
“That one wasn’t Dudley, was it?” said Harry, struggling to imagine Dudley running around naked.
Ernie and Anthony batted back and forward about Quidditch for a while, with Harry only having to pipe up occasionally, and Draco not at all. Anthony sitting down had pushed them closer together, and Harry could feel how Draco’s whole body had stiffened up while the others talked. Harry gave what he hoped was a reassuring nudge to Draco’s leg with his own, and saw Draco shoot him a small grateful smile. But he didn’t relax at all.
“Me neither,” Draco said. “Although there was this boy in the year below—” He stopped when he saw Harry’s face. “Probably better not to mention it now.”
“Bit more spacious in here, isn’t it?” Malfoy ran his hand along the edge of the desk.
With both hands, Draco moved his thumbs in even circles. Applying pressure, he worked on Harry’s lower back, moving in lines around the dips there, then slowly, slowly, moved down to the top of Harry’s arse.
Ron nodded, and as Harry made his way across the room he felt a sense of peace at seeing all his friends together.
“Harry, are you in?” Ron’s voice called out, muffled slightly by the thick wood.
“Fucking drunks,” John said.
His back ached, a sharp pain across one side, as he thought of the sofa bed at Ron and Hermione's; Harry rose to find Robards and arrange a few days' leave.
The Snidget reserve – disguised as an old quarry to Muggles – was buried deep in the Somerset countryside. Draco and Potter Apparated to the edge of the reserve, but when Draco produced a couple of brooms to take them further, Potter paled and shook his head. In the end they had to walk to get in. After a few minutes, Draco was aware of Potter beginning to limp beside him, but as Potter had refused to fly and didn’t mention anything about his knee, Draco said nothing.
desks. Oh crumbs. “Er—”
Harry kissed him. “This is my first time with you, but for you this is all old.”
Harry sighed, weighed down again by the thought of all the loss, and by the truth he could hear in her words. “I know.”
Once Harry had begun to be more aware of Malfoy beside him at night, he couldn’t switch it off. For one, Malfoy always curled up to sleep, and the position seemed so… vulnerable. Some nights, Harry and Malfoy would end up with some part of themselves touching, pressing up against each other, even. Which was fine if it was an ankle, or an elbow. But, Harry realised shortly after his chat with Hermione, completely different if it was someone’s whole front pressed against your back.
Henry turned to face him. “What was that?”
Potter leant forward, a twinkle in his eye and a sly smile on his face. Draco’s heart thumped alarmingly at the sight, and he pulled back. For some reason he had an urge to run away. He settled for a mild insult instead: “I do wish you’d refrain from that gurning when you’re around me.”
Draco stared up at the owl as it disappeared into the rain, then, as he shivered, his arms and chest soaked, dragged the sash back down. He looked down at the damp parchment in his hand. The folded edges were soft from the rain. Carefully, he unfolded it, until the five lines of neatly printed letters were clear to see. As soon as he saw the first words, he began to shake, and bile rose in his throat.
They sit like that, until Potter's hand has stilled, and the tears have stopped. Draco's head rests on the patch of dampness his tears have left on Potter's t-shirt-covered chest, and beneath the fabric he can hear the gentle thudding of a steady heart. It feels good to be so close, to feel the warmth of another person. Potter smells of sweat and sleep, it envelops him and is comforting.
Ron smiled. “I don’t think you’ve got the monopoly on being the moody one. And if there’s one reason to like you being with Draco, it’s because I feel like I’ve got my friend back. Plus it’s great to see you finally kicking a bit of arse on training.” Harry smiled back, happy to be feeling at ease with Ron again, and with his training, of course.
Forks began to clatter and knives to scrape: it was as if the room began to breathe again. Harry looked down at his own plate, at the roast potatoes and gravy, and the Yorkshire pudding and beans, so mundane, so comforting. He hadn’t realised that he’d been holding his breath, or that he cared quite so much what Arthur and Molly thought about his fr— about Draco.
Eyes, startlingly green and full of laughter. And heat.
Harry shrugged. It wasn't like Malfoy was the first person to question his decision to keep Grimmauld Place. His feelings about the house were complicated, and privately he sometimes wondered if Ron and Hermione, with their more normal family backgrounds, could ever really understand. He certainly wasn't about to get into it now with Malfoy, of all people.
Harry had elected to sit in the full sun, and despite the sun protection charm Draco was soon almost dizzy with the heat.  And perhaps with the sight of the lean body beside him. He shifted where he sat, glad for the charm on his swimming trunks. Harry looked up at the movement, squinting into the sun.
“—I… agreed to fulfilling the magical oath and brought you back with me, but I didn’t want you to think that I did so to get wealthy. Money really isn’t important to me.”
“I’ve already asked it. I don’t really mind who answers, but Potter’s ignored me so far. Why are you hanging in Potter’s study?”
“There are people
“It is certainly fascinating, being able to work with a curse like this. And you really should eat more fibre.”
"Ask it if it knows who we are," he said. Harry glanced over at him, but now Malfoy's eyes were fixed on the snake.
Once George had drained his cup of tea, he broke the silence. “Have you spoken to Ron and Hermione yet?”
On Halloween itself, Ron had somehow managed to wangle an invite to the Weasley’s party for everyone, including Greg. Ron, Hermione, Luna – even Greg – had all dressed up, but Harry didn’t really see the point. “They’re like family.”
The cloud of white mist that emerged silver from his wand rose up, took shape, and spread its wings.
“I'm not sure what to think about all this,” Harry said. “Like I said, I’m not her keeper. Maybe she could like you, maybe not. Maybe she’d rather play Quidditch. Either way… it’s for you to find out, not me.”
“Don’t be. I’m much happier now. Much less of an arsehole, too, to be honest.”
Harry was on his back, while Draco moved with thrusts that changed the shape of his behind, creating dips and rises.
“You’ve made yourself at home here, haven’t you?”
“I’m sorry.” Pansy reached out to touch his arm. “I can see that you’re—”
Before he knew it, Draco was being shoved from behind, and he fell straight onto Harry—
Draco had looked adoringly at messy hair, a lightning scar, and green eyes.
When Harry climbed the stairs to bed, before the stars had faded but after he’d closed the living room window to Malfoy’s satisfaction, he felt lighter than he had done in a long time. He’d never thought he’d be able to have a conversation like that. He didn’t, he realised, have anywhere to air his feelings about seeing Ron and Hermione together, or how lost and unfinished some parts of his life still felt. Yet Malfoy seemed to understand. He seemed, in his own way, lost and unfinished too.
Malfoy smiled, and Harry stepped away.
“I know.”
Draco was momentarily taken aback. He hadn’t expected Potter to say that. “Well, do let me know.” He spotted the Snitch resting on the mantelpiece and snatched it up.
“I just need a bit of practice with the numbers, I don’t watch it every day like you.”
“You’ve never said anything, to me and Ron, but here we are talking about your relationship with a man.”
Two hours later, Draco was beginning to regret turning down the offer of help. The day was proving to be hot and uncomfortable, and by the time they stopped again – this time on the outskirts of a town – Draco was sore and hungry.
“We look them over, then let them out for a minute or two.”
“Inner Gryffindor,” Harry said.
Hermione picked up the box and read out the instructions. Everyone interrupted at least once to ask a question, and by the time Hermione had finished she looked as though she wouldn’t mind throwing the box across the room.
“Do you want to turn the light off now?” Malfoy asked, putting down his book.
“Just because you didn’t get it,” Harry said. “Nobody could get that word, I don’t even know what it means.” He half-heard the explanation on the telly about witticisms, but who used words like that, anyway? “He always gets annoyed if someone gets a longer word than him,” he said to Parkinson.
"We're going to put the roof up tomorrow," she said. George and Ron began to explain the plan for getting it up. Hermione had insisted that where possible, Muggle methods were used in the construction of their house. Ron and George however, had been keen to speed things up when they could. Their discussion soon became technical, with some stones and twigs being Levitated as examples for different possible approaches.
"You believe there’s some mystical truth about trees you need to learn, but you don’t think you can gain from touching a tree?" Potter raised his eyebrows, evoking Professor McGonagall at her most frightening.
Thunder rumbled, but Harry managed not to jump. He hoped Felix was OK, he hated thunderstorms. He always streaked out of the room when it started, running to wherever it was he liked to hide.
“I know, but I was… it didn’t seem real. The visions, that is.” Draco hated himself for messing everything up so badly. He could be honest, now. Even if it was too late. “I was scared of frightening you away.” He looked down, his throat tight with shame. “Like I scare everyone else away.”
Malfoy was still looking at him.
Draco didn’t know what to feel. He knew the sick twist of guilt, himself, for having been so weak, for having stood by for so much. But then if Potter felt like this too… the war had left behind such a tangle of regrets. He wanted to reach out, to offer Potter some modicum of comfort or reassurance. But how could he? This was why it didn’t matter how much his heart soared when Potter played the violin, or how much he ached to know him better.
She frowned. "How?"
“I’ve got plans, sorry,” Luna said.
“You can leave by the Floo if you want. Your, er, robes stand out a bit here.”
This was so much worse than spilling coffee all over someone. Or even forgetting who they were. It was mortifying, standing in the Witches loos pretending that he couldn’t hear anything. He could only guess that she hadn’t cast a Silencing Charm as she had been in such a rush. He caught up with his own thinking: a Silencing Charm! Of course.
“Losing people is difficult, Harry.” Lavender was so soft-spoken he could barely hear her words.  He leant forward. “Look, I came to see you because I had an interesting chat with Hermione last week. I– I didn’t realise that you were finding things difficult.”
A smile worked its way onto Harry’s face.
“We have to do this, you know we do. Now stop being such an insufferable child and try not to scare any potential suitors away.”
The owl section in the Muggle library down the road felt as though it was becoming a second home. First of all, Harry had wanted to identify all the types of owls he was currently housing. And then Eddie had started limping (he was constantly injuring himself), and Gladys began to tremble whenever Harry came near (she was, it turned out, both highly strung and not very bright). Harry had quite a pile of owl books by his bed, but he always seemed to need one more.
Malfoy shut him down completely but why? What was he hiding?
"Oh .. Malfoy what was the snake saying? That you know something about the rise" Harry questioned.
Harry groaned.
*Hogwarts*
No one even looked up. All their eyes were downcasted.
Scorpius said "eewww gross" from behind and run away .
Draco sodding Malfoy has so many kinds of shampoos ,soaps  a body wash which made Harry confused which one he should use . Cursing Draco he picked up the chocolate body wash and washed himself . He applied shampoo he didn't even cared to know much  about the flavour.
Draco looked up . Their eyes met . And Harry kissed him .
",I guess so just do it then"
"Oi stop harassing my brother. I will kick your asses if I see you are harassing a Slytherin again .  " James threatened.
Harry squeezed Malfoy's hips and Draco groaned.
He shifted slightly to avoid Malfoy waking up . That's the last thing in the world he wishes right now to happen. He slowly stepped out of the bed and was collecting his shirt .
Oh!yes Draco had nightmares. His father used to cast crucio now and then there was that snake like lunatic and his hideous snake roaming all over the manor and made his base of operation. His main base of operation to be exact. And sometimes Draco saw the snake like man whispering something to the snake like they were making some plans . Plans to already destroy whatever small left in Draco's life .
Albus smiled "welcome dad. By the way dad mom is in the living room she wants to see you asap"
"Do you guys know Nagini was a maledictus?" Draco asked the duo .
"The concept of resurrection is found in the writings of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the Middle East. A few existing Egyptian and Canaanite writings allude to dying and rising" quoted Draco 'it was the first paragraph of our sixth year's ancient runes book . Remember? "
“But just say--”
With this Kingsley left Harry alone  into the office and left . Harry sighed. He existed the cabin and started to walk towards his office .
"I want you to suck my cock"
Then Harry stopped and Draco groaned.
Draco said as he came towards Harry .
I NEED A BETA LMAO .  IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED PLEASE COMMENT IN THE COMMENT SECTION . AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE PAIN AND EXPLAIN ME THE WHOLE BETA PROCESS . SO YES! XD
"Its one of the base of operation of the dark lord. "
Ana merely smirked and slithered towards him . "You two , unbelievably loud, and also it was a fair nice display of fornication".
"Mate hey! What are you doing here in this hour?" Ron asked as he was approaching his table .
"Tell me what Al? ?" Harry questioned . Draco could see wrinkles of worry forming on Harry's forehead.
And out of nowhere the door bell rang .
"Did I fucking say all these"
After tedious work in the potion lab both Draco and Hermione was terrified to find the end result of the test . It was indeed the rudimentary body portion Voldemort made to rise again in Harry's fifth year . The thought scared both Draco and Hermione .
"Malfoy are you out of your mind? He will be handicapped for the rest of his life . He can't ever  an auror!
"Shut it . Potter"
Then life happened . Harry quit his eighth year and started to take the auror  training . He got engaged to Ginny Weasley . Ron and Hermione his best pals , his constant companions got married . He was so happy for them .
"Tell me and Hermione then what happened ." Said Harry.
"Oh my god these are so familiar . Oh my god its not just carvings Draco it's one of the process which was used by ancient dark wizards  to bring dead to alive. It was used by certain civilization"
I wrote harry and albus's conversation like it was in the book . That's an iconic and one of my most favourite quotes so i couldn't just stop myself from writing . I had to bring draco in the place of Ginny because this is  a drarry fan fiction. I had no intentions to  alter the essence . I hope you will understand . Thank you for reading .
"James? Where are you? Please tuck in your shirt" Ginny glared at him
And suddenly Harry  found Draco's lips crushing into his. Draco forced his tongue inside Harry's mouth. Draco practically was fucking Harry's mouth with his tongue .
Harry snorted and replied "as if you are not enjoying."
Harry sighed and came and sat on Draco's lap . Facing him .
"Thanks Al for Saving me" Harry whispered to Albus
Draco didn't reply and Harry groaned.
Harry actually had forgotten about Scorpius. Its Scorpius's first time too. And of course Draco will be there. ......
Their lips met . It isn't like the kisses they share . Strong , fierce, needy . It was full of compassion, understanding and love .
Draco froze . Harry urgently asked "Did I say something wrong" . "Astoria used to say this to me " whispered Draco . Harry's heart broke as he saw Draco's face. He had a pained expression clearly written on it. Clearly Draco still mourns his wife's loss. "I am sorry can we do this some time later . " "Sure" said Harry . "I am sorry Draco"
"I don't believe you, are you spying on me ? Of course isn't this you always did spying on me, following me around. Thinking I am upto some thing bad and kill me again like you did?" There was venom and malice in Draco's voice which made Harry shudder.
"Professor" Harry screamed. Voldemort turned towards him and laughed hysterically. "Harry Potter how does it feel to see your beloved die in front of your eyes"
"Yeah. I suppose"
Harry was afraid and scared for this first time not because he thought he was about to die but he scared because he thought he will never see his children again . His sweet Lilly . He will never again hear Albus taking like a nerd or how James talk nonstop about quidditch. He will never see Ginny , His dearest friends . And Malfoy . God what ever progress they made from being the worst nemesis of Harry's life to being accidental auror partners . Draco always had one of the major take in Harry's life . Though it was mostly negative in the past but still..... . And with that he saw a flash of green light . And felt a pair of lips crushed onto his . Harry was taken aback at first , too overwhelmed with all the emotions but then he responded. God he likes Draco . He likes Draco so so so much . He has to tell this to him what if something happens and what if he never gets the chance to confess. He is a Gryffindor afterall.
"Hush now, it's over Draco . Everything is . Everything is okay."
They looked around for the snake but they saw just a huge pile of ashes . "What happened with to the snake" asked Harry .
So It's September first again . And its time for going back to Hogwarts . Harry and Ginny both wanted to be with Albus because its his first time in Hogwarts.  Albus is more excited because he will again meet his friend Scorpius. There are some people you will meet at some point of your life , these people have some kind of an aura which will attract you maybe the person beside you won't feel the attraction but you will and eventually they will become your favourite person. Scorpius was like  Albus's favourite person though they have only met once but there was something different about the boy which Albus likes the most . Plus Albus never had a huge number of friends like James . James and Albus are so different that some-times its hard to say that they are siblings.
Draco half smiled and said "I heard you Potter its fine . I don't know why I told you all these..."
"Ask the blonde beside you"
"Draco .. " Harry whispered . He now fully understood what was this about ."
"I will get it " whispered Draco
Harry's mouth hung open" Did Draco Malfoy actually flirt with him? Did me mean that.. oh my "
Draco was running his hands in circles over Harry's back . In order to keep him calm .
Harry could not handle it more, he was about to stomp and hex those when he heard James .
"And that's the reason why your hand is wrapped in bandages?" Asked Harry
Mother will scream again " Draco mumbled some broken sentences.
"Mom I have to untuck it again or maybe Sharon will do that " James winked at his mother
"He is doing fine . I guess . The doctors said he is under control now. His vitals are normal.
As soon as Draco saw Lily and Al his facial expressions softened. The sneer was replaced by a beautiful smile.
"What a surprise Potter. And Hello"
"Harry are you okay? What happened to your lips?" Hermione came running to him as soon as she saw Harry . "Err. Nothing some sort of insect I guess bit me "
" I know its related to Voldemort , maybe the potion Peter used ..."
A whoosh sound  followed by green flames from the fireplace declared someone's arrival.
"Well i was mad at you will i am still now so i said this to Ana while coming home." The snake comically nodded her head as if to confirm Draco Harry was saying the truth . This made Draco to snort .
"Always...only for you" Draco smiled.
*GREAT HALL*
"I didn't say I can't ... I ...I said I didn't tried to speak but last afternoon I spoke to the runespoor with no difficulty."
