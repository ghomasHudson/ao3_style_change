The bag he left with was a significant one. It held bottles of ink in silver, gold, invisible, black and dark green. He had bought himself plenty of rolls of parchment, all slightly different shades of beige and ivory. He had even splurged and bought himself a few basic quills for class and two really nice ones. One was from an eagle, regal and black. His plan was to use this one for acquaintances and business. The other was made from one of Draco’s feathers. It had fallen off one day and Harry had held onto it ever since. It had a nice weight to it, and the silver sheen was nicely accented by the sky blue vein running down the length of it. He wasn’t even sure that they would be able to make it into a quill, but the owner made sure to do it quickly for him. Somehow Harry knew Draco wouldn’t be upset, but he still wanted to keep a few of his secrets for the time being.
"Never date a coworker." Sirius nodded.
“Um...Draco? What is that?” Draco looked up and licked a bit of whatever it was off of his mouth. He rather looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Harry!” Draco was running to him from across the room. He hadn’t expected Harry to get there so soon. Harry ran to him, stumbling slightly on the way and was enveloped in Draco’s arms before he hit the floor.
Some think all of it is because of the losses and depression the War invariably brought on. Others think it's an attempt at making himself look more appealing to the other men. With all of these big changes in mind, you can't help but wonder. Rita Skeeter hopes to secure an interview with both Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy soon to clear up the confusion with the two.'
Harry really did seem embarrassed, like he had assumed something other than what he mentioned. But Draco had no such plans.
“Sorry, it won’t happen again.”
Draco glanced down, clearly caught out. "No. I want a guy like that in my life too. Sometimes I can't always hold others up, and I've found that most women are too helpless for my liking. They always need someone to lean on. Newsflash: I need someone to lean on too." Harry nodded. This he could understand at least.
The rest of the group stood and made their way to the gardens so Narcissa could show off a little. Once the two were alone, Harry sunk to his knees and crawled to Draco’s feet under the table. Unwilling to wait any longer, Harry reached up and unzipped Draco’s bottoms. He inhaled, taking in the crisp clean smell of Draco before swallowing all of him down.
“They used to play?”
They hadn't worn makeup around each other as they felt no need. They felt comfortable around each other, like they didn't need to hide or scare each other away. So Monday morning, they were both in the bathroom sharing the mirror and applying their daily makeup once again. Once done, they decided to brave the world outside their safe haven and grabbed their bags before walking into the cold corridors.
The tug moved, instead of subtly beckoning him towards the window, it was now pulling towards the door to his bedroom. It was getting stronger too, alarmingly quickly. His eyes opened of his own accord and he sat up, his brow furrowed. He couldn’t figure out what he was supposed to do, but his heart practically sung when Draco flew through the doorway.
"You dolt, you are a WIZARD. Undetectable shrinking charms work just as well!" Draco eyed the picture.
A small part of Harry, the bitter part that hated happiness, the part of him he had to create to destroy Voldemort, was disgusted and saw the signs. Harry was hopelessly smitten with the blond man in front of him.
So it was those thoughts that were interrupted by Draco taking notice of the Savior of the World looking at him almost as thought he was made of glass. After a moment of silence between the two, Draco decided that enough was enough.
“Ah, ‘s no big deal. Well, I’m off. Got ter find some good trees for this year.” A large hand pulled Harry in for a hug and he grinned before saying his goodbyes and heading to Honeydukes to meet Draco.
He'd just have to make do with small relationships and the occasional one-night stands. Just not on a work night. Rule number thirteen said so. The next time he heard the blond move, he saw that he was awake.
When he pressed her for an answer on why he had to learn that one first, she simply mentioned that she knew her son well and that he’d probably explain properly later. While that didn’t ease his nerves, he shrugged and they jumped right into the subject.
“Right, but I wouldn’t be starting a relationship at that point in my life. If I’m busy supporting someone who truly needs it that I’m close to, then learning to support a relationship at the same time isn’t going to result in a good relationship. And that’s not fair to me or the other person. But if I’ve got relationships that are already in good standing-for example, us-I wouldn’t shut you out just because mum fell ill. I’d rely on you to help me. But I most certainly wouldn’t expect an almost stranger to help me through that.”
“Have you two seen a toad?”
He heard the door open again and tensed just a little when he felt the bed dip behind him before relaxing completely as an arm slid under his pillow and another was wrapped around his waist. Harry felt himself smile the smallest amount and before he drifted off once more. He couldn’t be sure, but he swore he felt Draco’s lips graze the back of his neck just before sleep overtook him again.
“Anyways, mum wants me to have fun and to date around but I’m not all that interested right now. Like I said, there’s a few things I need to sort out first and then I’ll be able to think about dating. But I almost feel like I can’t mention any of my friends because then she starts going on about how we’d make a cute couple. You know she had seriously suggested to me a few months ago that Blaise and I would be cute together?” Draco cringed. “No thank you. Not my type at all.”
“Ah, I sort of...didn’t think about that. Sorry.” He looked rather contrite and Harry brushed him off.
“The patronus charm.” Harry immediately regretted offering to help Ron.
As if it could get any better, he suddenly started smelling wonderful things nearby. Ah yes, the brunch Draco was talking about.
“Mother, I want to talk about marriage contracts and how they work. I know you’ve been itching to teach me and I didn’t want anything to do with it but I think I’d like to learn now.”
“Well, there’s this...connection between us. It allows us to send our emotions to the other over distance, as well as the direction the other is in. Once it’s more solidly formed, most can tell about how far the other one is as well. Some pairs were so strong, it’s said that they could send images to one another as well as a few words.”
He heaved his trunk in and settled down in his seat with a book to read for the ride. He was quite content with his little compartment for some time until the door crashed open and in flew a brightly redheaded boy that seemed about his age.
“Harry! Are you okay? I was worried sick about you!”
‘How’s your summer so far? I know you don’t enjoy being away from school and wanted to check in on you. Anything interesting happening?
"What's wrong?" He hovered over him, hoping to kiss him senseless after he reveals his worry, to kiss the pain away. He figured that as long as he has the chance, he might as well use it.
"Mmmm..move." Harry looked into his eyes and saw no hesitation or doubt whatsoever. "Hurry up and move, that felt good when you shifted your weight. Now so help me, move or I'll murder you in your sleep!" Harry was only too happy to comply. He pushed and pulled in and out at a slow pace, determined to keep from fucking the man under him. The only thing that could solidify his feelings into actions was the baby he was going to share with Draco. He didn't ever want a baby that was the product of a fuck, but a product of making love to someone.
"How'd you know?"
"You aren't." Harry felt his jaw hit the floor. Here he was getting advice from his professor and best friend and father-like figure and he was being told not to think? This was coming from a man that, for years, had asked him to kindly use his brain or cease existing. Coming from a man that did nothing but think. Harry simply couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that Sev would ever give that kind of advice to anyone...about anything. He just couldn't fathom it. "You're supposed to feel Harry. You're supposed to...Oh for Merlin's sake."
"May I sit here?" Harry nodded and looked back at the table before glancing at Draco. He shrugged, so he looked back at the girl. "I have no problems with you two. It's everyone else." She raised her voice. "And all the Slytherins should be okay with you two since we have more of a reason to stick together no matter what...right guys?" Everyone within hearing distance nodded, but made no other move to talk to them. The Slytherin House was pretty quiet as a whole.
Eventually the tears subsided and he heard a gentle humming filling the air around him. His hand involuntarily clutched at the shirt Draco wore, a sign that he wasn't going to start crying again but he didn't want to speak first.
“Oh yes, but do take note that I will need approximately an entire year if not more to plan out all the details.” Draco groaned.
"My work is done, I'm leaving early." His tone was clipped and left no room for argument.
It was just a gentle pressing of lips, nothing exceptional, so light he could hardly believed it had happened. He felt lightheaded, more so than when he had tested out just how high his broom could take him before it would slow to a stop.
He had been at the table finishing his lunch when Harry had given him his Invisibility Cloak. He had said to wear it for the day while he gave an announcement to the paper. It was simple and to the point. That he'd be too busy courting someone to really be out and that they shouldn't worry if they didn't hear from him for quite awhile. He didn't take any questions-a brave and smart move in Draco's opinion.
"We caught them but before I got them restrained your father hit you with several spells he combined. I brought you here where the Healers started your coma. You were out for three weeks. I thought you'd never wake up..." Draco tried to remember, but it just hurt his head too much.
“I see. And do you think he will feel the same?”
"Harry...I don't remember..."
When Draco saw the white gold band with intricate strands of gold connecting and weaving through fine-cut sapphires, resting on the sapphire-blue velvet, he looked almost ready to faint.
"Potter! Sorry I didn't realize you'd be over today. Um...Lemme just..."
"What?" His voice was soft, not wanting the other man to hear him.
The next week found the two partners at the Ministry waiting for Kingsley to either come out of his office or let them in. Draco was nervous for his first time out on in the field, Harry could just tell. He had been nervous his first time too.
Harry had to learn out on a job- thank God for the box of Bezoars that Ron had given him as a birthday gift earlier that same day. He only used a mild poison, strong enough to show its effects but not so strong as to let anything bad happen to him. He wanted Malfoy to learn his lesson, not become deformed. He even put the antidote in the drink.
“I’ll put it bluntly Mr. Potter. I am going to call on favors this summer. Before your 16th birthday, I will have a new place for you to stay. One that is even more protected than the Dursley’s house.” Harry smiled, on the surface he was glad Dumbledore was going to take him away from that place. But deep down, he knew it most likely wouldn’t happen. It was just another plan that would end up backfiring or not working out the way they wanted it.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know what you two are on about. There’s nothing wrong with my magic.”
Hundreds of rose petals in all different shades surrounded him on the bed. On Draco’s side of the bed was a small black box and a letter folded neatly in half. He reached for the letter.
“Warms your towels for when you get out. Shampoo is the purple bottle and the blue bottle is body wash.” Harry looked at him in confusion. People used shampoo to wash their bodies, didn’t they?
It was a moment of instant panic, the moment that you wake up and foolishly hope you're dreaming but you know that you're not. In that moment Harry felt a pang of fear, something that he hadn't felt since Dumbledore's death. It was in that instant that he felt completely overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.
"He's pretty. His skin is so smooth and with his eyeliner he looks absolutely angel-worthy. Maybe a fallen angel since he always wears black now. His touch is nice, it's a comfort to me. It soothes me when I'm upset and it makes my stomach uneasy when I'm fine. I want to make him happy, but I don't know how.
“And then what?” Draco’s heart was racing. He had gone so far out of his way to make Harry miserable, and why? To be around him. He used to think it was because he was jealous, but looking back he wasn’t so sure. And lately the two have spent more time together doing homework-rather insignificant but they did it near each other nonetheless. The cherry on the cake was now that him and Harry have had many meaningful conversations, and since he most definitely liked Harry’s personality, he was afraid of what his mother would say next.
"Draco?" He looked up immediately, not worrying about the hope that drained from his face, quickly becoming concern when he was met by a worried expression. "I...I'll do it." Draco's mouth gaped; he hadn't expected him to accept, no matter how much the blond had wanted him to.
“Tell me what I’m wrong about then.” Draco shook his head, disappointed that he couldn’t exactly tell her she was wrong about anything.
"It was nasty." He nodded.
“Remind me why I can’t just go to the ministry?” She laughed at him.
When he looked up again, it was because he heard the portrait open and close again. His mind told him to get up, to close the doors, and to make himself look normal. But his body had other plans for him. He remained on the floor, hoping that Draco would find him and go get Severus and praying that Draco would leave him be. He wasn't sure which one he wished for more, and that scared him.
“Are you kidding me? You’ve been glaring at me from across rooms and trying to pick a fight since school started again! Don’t give me that innocent act, it’s not going to work. I don’t want to deal with your insincere attitude, just leave me alone already!” Ron’s face darkened and Harry took an involuntary step back.
He watched, utterly helpless, as flashes of different colored lights lit up the blond hair of the unconscious man. He began to cry for the second time since he was one and his aunt's scream woke him up.
"This," Harry growled as he grabbed an entire box of paperwork, "is exactly why I joined the force. And this," he slapped the files on the desk in the center so it made a loud noise. "is exactly why I refuse to quit until my contract is up."
Every single day since then, Harry would receive a flower from Draco. Sometimes they came by owl, sometimes Draco would place one next to him before he woke up and sometimes Draco would procure one from behind his back. Besides the flowers, necklace and sugary confections, Draco had also given him a new bottle of metallic gold ink, a new package of specialty treats for Hedwig and whatever was in this package for him.
“What do you mean I’m more than just a friend?” Draco blushed and Harry couldn’t help but think about how attractive Draco was when he got embarrassed.
The table full of red trimmed robes burst into applause and cheering as Harry went to sit down. Ron, unsurprisingly, was also sorted to Gryffindor and chose a seat a few down from Harry, which was just fine with him.
Harry was ushered aside as a group of Healers came rushing in when the distress spells went off. He could see the look of pain on Draco's face until he was administered a pain potion.
I didn’t touch myself either angel, and yet my pants are just as sticky as yours. I do believe we will survive my angel. Harry’s cheeks flushed and he cleaned himself up before responding. He had collected his emotions by then, resisting the urge to make Draco melt like butter.
He ate and quickly made his way back to his dorm to grab his homework so he could spend his Sunday relaxing instead of panicking that his essays were due. He had just grabbed his bag and turned when he practically ran straight into Ron who promptly tried convincing him that he didn’t need to be studying right then. They had better things to do.
The hat told him he’d do well in Slytherin and despite the fear coursing through him at the idea of being in the same house as Voldemort was, he conceded.
"Who?" Fear and uncertainty suddenly washed through him. How was he supposed to do this when he could be rejected yet again? "Come on, I won't make fun. And I won't say anything to them. Besides, I'm going to find out eventually. If you tell me then I'll tell you a secret." Draco's curiosity won out.
“I’m in the papers?” Ron’s eyes grew wide and his jaw practically dragged on the floor. The sound of the train whistling snapped him out of it, followed by a jerk as the train started to move.
Draco took a cool shower and promptly fell asleep, not even awake enough to worry about the next day, let alone set his alarm.
They bought their gloves, some more broom maintenance supplies and headed back out into the sunlight. With their shopping complete, they were ready to go back to Malfoy Manor.
He remembered the confused look his father gave them as she took him to the nursery. He remembered her telling him that Elizabeth would be able to talk to her if he needed anything. He remembered her telling him that the charms she would give to him were exact replicas of hers and that they would reflect his mood.
He cried for an hour.
Harry found a seat next to Hermione, and started piling his plate with fruit while Hermione was busy tucking into a sandwich whilst she read. That must be the book Dumbledore was talking about. She seems like she’s almost done with it.
“Do you see anyone looking?” He leaned forward. “In order for wizards to get a reservation here, they have to fill out an application and undergo an interview. That’s to sort out anyone who wouldn’t know how to handle people as famous, or unique, as the two of us. It’s perfectly safe to take your wings out Harry. I promise you that.”
"Congratulations. Baby one is a beautiful girl." She handed the bundle to Draco, who hadn't registered the fact that she said 'baby one'. Harry did, though and looked at her with questions in his mind chasing each other.
Ron stood and yelled at Pansy before releasing a hex of his own. Which led to Blaise sending one towards him. Ron ducked and it hit Hermione, who sent one right back. A second year sent a rather impressive hex and after that was a blur of different colored hexes and curses. Harry sent a shielding bubble over himself and Draco, who noticed that everyone else was severely injured or had body parts where they shouldn't be.
Realizing that he wasn't going to get his paperwork done on his latest closed case anytime soon, he sighed and gave his attention to whatever the young boy wanted. He looked like he had just gotten out of some high end college the muggles had. High and mighty and way too cocky to be wise.
"Harry when are we going to actually do something?"
“No, just be ready to leave in an hour. I’m sure Mother would be happy to escort you. I’ll be leaving now with Father to attend to some things before then.” He winked and made his way out of the room leaving Harry blushing and on the verge of shock and his mother smiling.
“You sure? I’ll have to stand up.” Harry nodded and sat up to watch him transform.
It took a long time for the two of them to make it to the Room of Requirement, but they did finally make it and Harry had to try no less than half a dozen times to get the room to show itself. Inside there was a rather nice sitting room with a huge bed off to the side with hangover potions on each bedside table. A fireplace running the length of the wall crackled happily while they stumbled to the plush couch.
‘The dark angel typically has five bonding stages after they locate their mate: Teasing, Courting, Testing, Reuniting, and Bonding. Most other species only have four steps, combining Reuniting and Bonding into one.
He was bound and determined to show this man that he cared about the both of them. Draco would be the most spoiled pregnant person that ever lived. Harry would make sure of it personally. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's waist as he kept his steady pace, trying extremely hard not to speed up or finish too early. He wanted Draco to finish first.
"Excuse me, what exactly do you mean by that?" Harry looked perplexed and livid all at the same time.
Overwhelming guilt at the things he’d said about Ron flooded Harry’s system when the sobriety potion chased away the pleasant fog the alcohol had him in. He shouldn’t have said those things about Ron, Ron was a good person. Wasn’t he?
After what seemed forever, but was actually an hour, Harry pulled himself together so he could understand what the Healers were trying to communicate to him.
Confused, Harry looked at the package and saw the tag to be from Draco. He tried to say it wasn’t necessary but Draco insisted until Harry relented and opened the package.
"Mudungs may have smelled like shit, but he sure knew how to get his money's worth." Now that actually made more sense to him than anything. But why was he so determined to help him? And what made him cry?
“No, I’m fine. Really.” He felt someone squeezing his hand.
“What’s your opinion on different types of abuse?”
“Draco?” Harry was sitting on the window seat again, perched with a blanket and a schoolbook.
"And their last names will be Potter. Now, I'm tired. Can't you take us home?" Harry looked to the Healer and she nodded.
"Baby two is a wonderful boy." She handed the other blanket to Harry who looked at the baby he never knew about.
‘The bird was inconspicuous, I never thought Draco Malfoy would send such a tiny thing. Not at all up to Malfoy Pompous Standards, I’d say. He’s cute though, does he have a name?
"They used to get by with insulting me and making me do chores and letting their son chase me around. Then I turned nine and Vernon started punching me. Around ten, Petunia started in on it, but she only threw things and slapped me.
“Draco, am I a good friend?”
"I'm...you...that's not true. I've always wanted a little baby, not for an heir or the namesake. But for the simple joy of being loved and being able to love back without being judged. I want someone who will smile at me, who won't care about my past, and who I can take care of. And vice versa if the situation calls for it."
“Summon the wine you bought.” A bottle slapped into his hand and he took a glance at the label. “I’ll hand it to you, you at least picked a good bottle for the lower end of the prices I usually pay.”
Draco nodded and patted Harry on the shoulder.
Harry had fallen asleep almost immediately after Draco slid out of him, worn out after the incredibly long day and even better lovemaking. He smiled and shifted off of him, happy to hold the brunet close as he drifted off to sleep with his husband. He knew there would probably be arguments in the future-and from their history they’d probably be tame compared to what he’d seen his parents to be capable of. But he also knew he would do anything for the one in his arms. Whatever problems they would encounter, whatever issues they may come across, the two would be able to work through them together.
When she spoke, it sounded like her voice had been layered twice.
Wait.
“Way to lighten the mood,” Draco muttered. His mother, never one to mishear a slight like that, smacked him upside the head. “Ow!”
"Just do as I say." Harry didn't question him, he learned long ago that it would get you nowhere quickly. "Now close your eyes and imagine Draco. I don't care where you two are, just think about him. Visualize him to the best of your ability." Harry nodded and after a few more moments, Sev continued. "Now just talk. About what you feel. About anything. Just talk. Don't think. Feel."
You probably don't know who I am yet. So when you're done here, why don't you ask your roommate again? Maybe he'll be a little more open with you this time. Anyways, I decided to give you this owl. He's really good company and may seem unapproachable, but he's really quite social. At least with decent people.'
He giggled as he walked to his bed and his giggles became more pronounced as he plopped backwards onto the soft surface.
“Oh yes, she wants to know all about you apparently. I think she’s going ‘round the bend just a tad, but you didn’t hear that from me. She’s paranoid that I’m going to end up single and alone all my life if I don’t date anyone at school and to be quite frank I would rather resolve a few things first before I start showing my interest in anyone.” Harry nodded. After all, it only made sense.
It made everything so much slicker and easier for Draco’s fingers to slide in and out of him at a much more acceptable pace than the incredibly slow movements that the blond had been subjecting him to. He was staring up at his husband, nerves making him shake in pleasure, and all he wanted was more.
“The knob on the left is hot and the one on the right is cold. But do be careful, the hot doesn’t have a warm-up period like Hogwarts does.” Draco smiled and left him to the bathroom, leaving the door cracked a bit to let steam out. Harry turned the knobs and quickly stripped, hurrying into the shower and closing the glass door before testing the water from the showerhead. It was some fancy once that reminded him of how it felt to stand in rain.
He found another charm in the box, this one an owl. He smiled and attached it before going in search of Harry.
A tear slid down his left cheek.
He felt warm all over, inside and out. He heard Draco practically chirping in happiness. They had both waited so long for something they didn’t even know they missed.
With that, the blond went about making breakfast for the one person that he never thought he’d get to know.
Draco thought that he'd be touching skin and bone, but it appeared that Severus had gotten the boy to eat more than he had been in years past. He made a mental note to thank him later. Instead of the sharp edges he had anticipated, his fingers met soft skin. It was obvious that at one point there was a sharp edge from his hip bone but now it was covered by a layer of softness, implying that he had gained weight recently. He allowed himself a small smile before quickly adapting his usual 'touch me and die' look. The last thing he needed was people seeing him smiling and acting approachable when Harry was clearly distraught at all of the noise and people around him. He just needed to hold everyone at bay until they were no longer where everyone recognized the famous wizard.
Little did he know that Harry had fallen asleep with the same smile on his lips that Draco did.
“I know as well as the next person that the Potter fortune is vast, but please don’t waste your money on dragonhide gloves like I did. At best, they held out as long as two normal pairs would have. You and I fly different from everyone else. We fly hard. Sure everyone does during a match but we fly hard all the time. I’ve had the best luck with basilisk skin so far.” He held up a pair of glittering emerald fingerless gloves. “I’ll warn you, they’re pricey but very much worth it. I bought a pair last year and they only wore out over the summer.”
"I am. Very much so." To prove his point, he snuggled in closer to the brunet and pressed his face into Harry's neck. "Why the sudden curiosity?"
“Draco? You’re driving me bloody mad with all the teasing. Are you going to be like this all the time?” Draco roared with laughter.
"You're not breathing right. Slow, deep breaths. Short and fast won't give your muscles the oxygen they need. Just breathe." After a few moments, they started up again. This time, he kept up with him easier. Who knew that he'd be able to help me by correcting my breathing, of all things?
"Hi Draco. Planning on getting up sometime soon?" He chuckled as Draco jumped up and started throwing on clothes. He clearly wasn't aware he was doing it in front of him otherwise he would've demanded he shut the door or he would've gone into the bathroom he could see that adjoined to his room.
Harry came to actually care about the blond once he saw him show some emotion other than the cold vivaciousness he usually showed. He wanted him to wake up and didn't think it would actually happen. He felt more tears slide down his face and after a few moments of contemplating wiping them away, he just let them fall.
"Here. You pick first names, I'll pick the middle names." He agreed, realizing that it was the best offer he'd get.
“Why, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy it is good to see you two. I do hope your mother liked the gown I sent her for her social gathering over the springtime Mr. Malfoy.” She turned to Harry and gasped in pure shock. “Mr. Potter! Still wearing those robes from two years ago? I’m appalled! Spelling them to fit you better is only going to make them look worse! Tisk tisk, we must get you in new robes immediately.” She whisked Harry onto a pedestal and had just spelled the measuring tape to do its job when Draco leaned in and quietly spoke to her. “Of course. Follow me, Mr. Potter.” She led them into the back where multiple sewing machines were quietly sewing along the pinned marks.
"I never would have thought about checking for poison. Thank you for teaching me before it killed me."
"You did. Just wait until the newsletter comes around next week, they'll have a picture of your face. It was rather impressionable, although I'm sorry to say I wasn't around to see it. Have a nice remainder of your weekend."
He let Draco shove his face further until he couldn’t breathe, but he loved it. He loved the feeling of Draco’s cock stretching his throat wide, the lightheadedness that started with him in this position long enough, the instant inhale and relief oxygen gave him when Draco would inevitably yank on his hair to allow him to breathe just enough to keep him conscious before shoving Harry’s mouth back over his member. The best feeling was when Draco finally let go and made him fuck his own throat before his hot seed burst down into his stomach. He didn’t even get to taste it.
He imagined what it could be like. Harry would be there for him, and when the baby came he'd ignore every spiteful word out of his mouth because he'd know it was just the pain talking. He imagined that he would stay home and help around the house, just because he could.
Before either one of them knew it, Christmas had arrived. They had spent the night before taking their time, slowly learning each other while the silencing charms did their jobs dutifully.
“Draco?” The man in question was walking towards him and he was slowly backing up-only to be stopped by a bed. He wasn’t afraid of Draco, but he did feel a strange sort of nervousness as he neared.
They were refined. More modern. Black rims that were no longer circular framed his eyes and no longer magnified his eyes to impossible proportions and a slight silver design was barely glinting in the subtle light on the arms of the glasses.
He then had to shut that stupid alarm up. Damn his wand-alarm! He shut it off and slowly sat up after stretching like a cat, his behind in the air and his arms out in front of him.
"Yes I'll be fine. I'm just stressed from work and all the idiot fans I have to deal with. None of them know what I've seen...what I've gone through...why I decided to be an auror, I'll never know. But none of that matters so long as the job gets done and the paperwork filed correctly." Harry went silent as his mind took him to darker times.
“Do you take me for a fool, or do you just presume yourself to be that much better than me?” There wasn’t much fight behind his words, talking was going to take some getting used to again. He watched as Draco dipped his head.
They worked tirelessly, so much so that they didn't hear the insults sent their way the entire day. All their teachers were ecstatic they were so advanced in their studies, and Madame Sprout actually learned a helpful tidbit from Harry about getting the plants to stop trying to strangle her while she talked to the class. Lunch came and passed with nothing to note, but dinner was when the fighting broke out.
"I'd love to." Harry helped him stand and before he knew it, they were walking towards his destination.
“Freak! Get up! Dudley wants breakfast in bed!” Harry silenced a groan and got up, struggling to put on his trousers while hunched over in his cupboard.
Harry stepped out of the fireplace and quickly wiped the ash of of his shoulders. He looked around, curious as to why the house was silent. He knew Draco was here, as it wasn't a foreboding silence...it was just odd.
Draco was unnaturally happy about being the person who introduced alcohol to Harry Potter. It was a bottle of Ogden’s Finest, something that his parents saw fit to gift him with earlier that year for his birthday and now for the holiday season. And somehow, Draco managed to convince Harry to play a drinking game which resulted in the two being far too drunk to really think about what they said before they said it, but not far enough to forget everything the next day. They wandered around the castle, arm in arm, singing, badly, the school song and giggling far too much.
"For?"
The next two months passed in a blur and before he knew it, he was standing on at an altar in cream robes with a deep yellow embroidery. His legs felt like jelly after having to walk all the way up to the man he was going to be able to call 'husband' in a few minutes.
He knew him just barely enough to see his eyes soften the slightest bit.
He licked his way up and down where his fangs so desperately wanted to bite down, dragging moan after moan from Draco. He slowed his hips, dragging out the moans until neither one could think coherently anymore. When he started sucking on Draco’s neck, the blond groaned.
"And I've heard you talk in your sleep too. You regret fighting with him." Harry shrugged.
“It’s just...he always makes everything about himself and he never bothers to listen to anyone. He couldn’t care less about homework and all he does is bugger his girlfriend or send Colin to spy on me and follow me back to the common room. He hates that I spend my time studying-time he’s busy with Lavender, mind you-and he lost his bloody mind when he heard about us studying with Hermione the first time. He’s so irrational when it comes to what I’m doing and who I’m doing it with, but it’s normal for people to fight so I must just be wanting a friendship from heaven to not worry about the next argument we’ll be having. He’s always got to be right, even when he’s wrong and I don’t even know if I want to be around him but the blowout would be so much worse than you could possibly imagine. And to top all of that off, he’s so insensitive! You’d have to have the emotional capacity of a brick wall to not be affected by his negativity and constant problems. But I’d miss him if I dropped the friendship. He knows things about my life that no one else does and if that was enough for him to start treating me differently, then everyone else will too. And I’ve spent a lot of time with our relationship, too much to simply give up on.”
‘Draco
"So, how about we share the bathroom connected to these two rooms and then you can pick which color you want?" He agreed and chose the royal purple over the navy blue. They both went their ways, and soon, both were sound asleep.
"Now what?" Draco's voice sounded tired and Harry noticed.
And he knew Draco. As much as he hated to admit it, the man knew how to get to him, how to get the intended reaction that he wanted. It was like he had read Draco and memorized him like a book-what he could get to anyway.
“Draco.” He turned back to Narcissa. “Close your eyes. Do you feel it?” He nodded. “Where is it leading?” He opened his eyes.
“You aren’t shagging each other, are you?!” Harry quickly put that assumption to rest and watched and the color slowly returned to Ron’s face. “Alright, I suppose I can live with you two being friends. Don’t expect me to be any more than civil, Malfoy.”
“Did you know?” His voice was suddenly very menacing. Albus looked between the two in subtle confusion. “Did you know that that boy in there was starved, beaten senseless, weakened just so his uncle could...could….have his way with him?” He practically hissed the last part, he was so disgusted. Dumbledore’s eyes widened, clearly not having any idea that’s how far things had progressed over the summer. A great sadness filled his eyes, and he hung his head. Shame radiated from his body, disappointment in himself for not being able to protect Harry from such a brutal situation. The boy had told him about the beatings, but he must have been covering up just how bad they really were.
Harry had thought about having a family, of course, but when he came to terms with being gay he had resigned himself to never having the luxury of kids that were his. Draco's predicament had sparked a hope inside of him, but he had logic and wisdom on his side. He had to think this through.
Tears welled in Harry’s eyes and he practically ran from the room. He bolted through the common room and just kept walking. He didn’t stop until he realized he was at the top of the Astronomy tower. When he realized where he was, he sat down and thought about all that Ron had said.
And when the day arrived when the students would finally be leaving for the holiday, Harry glanced at the list of students staying in the castle. It was only him and Draco as well as a small handful of first years in Ravenclaw. Not even Colin would be able to follow him around like a lost puppy.
A nearby couple passed, and Draco could hear them giggling over the two of them sitting under a willow tree. He chose to ignore them.
"I said DISMISSED!" he roared at the top of his lungs. The other employees had the sense to drag the git away to the atrium and to escape from the famed wrath of one certainly furious Harry Potter.
“Harry, I think you need to be honest with me. And with yourself. Is Ron a good person?”
I dreamt that Draco, I didn’t do it on purpose. Shock, curiosity and desire was the only answer he got.
Harry watched as Sev got up and stood behind him.
The next day Harry was having tea with Narcissa and going over the finer points of how to manage properties and how to keep the buildings in shape even if they’re not in use. Apparently things can become run down in an absurdly short amount of time.
What he saw was Draco Malfoy laying on the floor holding a book as if he fell asleep reading it. His blond hair fell in delicate tendrils on his face and his mouth was just barely open. It made a sweet picture of innocence and Harry wished beyond what he thought possible that he had someone to hold him. To tell him he was loved. To make everything okay even if he knew it wasn't.
“I-do you really mean that?” Draco looked as gobsmacked as Harry had felt when he first opened his mouth. But he was coming to accept that what he had said was not only true, he had meant every single word of it.
Draco nodded. He didn't like it, he actually hated it, but pride wouldn't let him say anything against it-he wanted to build up a reputation as well as impressing Harry. Besides, maybe he could get some leverage on him.
"Draco?" He looked up at Harry's soft inquiry. "I'd like to take you out to dinner tonight." He nodded and asked what he should wear. "Wear the silk robes. It's warm out, and they'll not rub on your skin too much. I know cotton can irritate your stomach now."
‘As for your little joke about starving to death; that’s not funny. If you didn’t have me to send you food, you would have likely starved to death already this summer alone. You and I are going to have a little chat about this when I see you. And I WILL be seeing you. Write down the address so Father can come fetch you and your things.
“What have I got to lose? Besides, most everyone else only wants me for the fame or the money-usually both. Since you’ve already got both of those, I’m sure that’s not something I’d have to worry about with you.”
“I’ve never seen it done. There’s no rule against it but most purebloods try to make it as long as possible so they can keep themselves available for better opportunities. Personally, I’m not interested in anyone else. What brought this on?”
"Don't you 'Sirius' me young man!" Draco saw Potter flinch. "I cannot believe that you let him get away with insulting two of the best aurors out there! Even better than Moody. And you!" He turned to face Draco. "You insulted them. Why?"
He watched, his knees pulled tightly to his chest, as Vernon loomed closer and closer. He hadn’t started yelling-also a very, very bad sign. Harry cowered into himself with fright. Voldemort himself didn’t instill this much fear into him, and yet here he was, ready to piss himself and Vernon hadn’t even said or done anything yet.
Managing to say anything would be insanely difficult, but Harry felt like he needed to tell someone. He might burst otherwise. It took several attempts, but finally he managed it and once he started talking, he couldn’t stop.
"Josephina and Jasper."
"Because I care and because I don't want either of you two hurt in any way possible." Draco nodded, and let his Slytherin side out for a moment.
“Noticed what?” They both looked up at Ron, who was already sat down next to Harry and stuffing his face with a sandwich.
The rest of the afternoon was spent getting manicures, pedicures, facials and they followed it all up with another massage, this one being a deep tissue. Draco's main purpose was to make Harry as boneless as possible so he'd be in a blissful state for the rest of the evening, and hopefully throughout the rest of the week.
Draco, who was currently trying to balance seven bags of ice mice while reaching for a tin of biscuits.
“Nah, we’ll be playing some chess in the common room tonight.” Harry turned to Ron and braced himself.
Did Harry care for him? Obviously he cared as he stayed by his side while he was in the hospital. And that's another thing. He knew friends and even business partners sometimes visited people in the hospital...but they never usually stayed the entire time like Harry did. It shocked him and made him wonder if Harry didn't just consider him a coworker. If Harry liked him, fancied him.
Draco tilted his head in puzzlement. “See what?”
"The maximum. As in, as much a you can cram in his mind-do it. I'll expect you two to be coming into work in a week." Harry watched his face disappear and hit his head repeatedly on the table. Not only does he have to continue with his aerobics classes, but now he had to put in overtime with Draco Malfoy.
“Well I think it’s brilliant. Too much, sure. But if you’ve got a bunch of people over it’d be great.”
When he finally got all of his clothing on in the right places was when he looked at the analog. 8:15. Class started in fifteen minutes.
Harry focused on making his wings disappear and Draco chuckled after a few minutes.
Harry really couldn't resist offering to help the poor man-Harry knew that the blond would be eaten alive by anyone else. Harry, at least, could only trust himself not to kill him. Not that he cared if someone else murdered him, but he wouldn't do it himself because that would have made it completely unnecessary to save his life the previous year.
He walked up to the bed and sat down on the edge. Harry felt his body stiffen, and he put a hand on his shoulder gently.
"Well obviously or you wouldn't be here talking to me. You'd be in bed sleeping."
“I thought they only worked at Hogwarts?”
"Close. Take another right, and I'm at the end of the hall." Draco mentally slapped his forehead for being so stupid. He led the way and let Harry enter the large office before shutting the outside world out. Harry sighed and filled out a sheet of parchment and sent it zooming out the window before leaning back on his chair. He motioned to the chair across his desk while putting his feet up on the dark mahogany wood.
His hair had streaks of black and blue in it and his eyes were lined in heavy black kohl just like Harry's. His shirt was skintight and dark grey and his pants were loose around his legs. He couldn't tell, but he was fairly sure that his shoes were snakeskin boots. He just nodded his consent and went back to reading his book.
When it was time to leave the classroom for the interview, Draco didn't say a word. He just stood there and gave him a meaningful look, one that asked him if he was all right and if he'd be able to handle what he was about to do. He nodded and got up to go and meet with the one woman who had tried to destroy his life by receiving more readers. This was about to be one messed up interview as Harry would be the one scamming her, instead of the other way around.
The Malfoy watched as everyone basically took everyone down. He jumped when Harry's voice boomed throughout the castle.
“You’re lonely.” It wasn’t a question, more of a statement. Harry’s body had been so preoccupied with healing itself inside and out, trying to heal sixteen years worth of wounds, that the mate aspect of it all hadn’t been something they thought to discuss. Normally it was a slow progression, the loneliness. It was supposed to be a gradual change, something that took a year or more to develop into a bond with their mate.
"He's always got something interesting to say and I never know which way is up or down when I'm around him. He makes me feel like I've never felt before. He's why I've progressed so far with my eating. I wanted to get well and so I did. I made myself potions that would help my body retain what it would need. I ate more because of it, because I needed more in me to sustain my body. That's how I've gotten to be as big as I am.
Later he would say that Draco, enraged and fighting, was a very intense sight indeed. At the time, all Harry could think about was his rage that Draco had to fight his father. He felt shock and anger, a shot of red followed by a numbing sensation, coursed through his veins as Draco passed out.
Courting:
"Do you like him romantically though?" He thought about it and couldn't come up with an answer. "That's okay. Go back and just observe for awhile. Think about it from someone else's eyes. You might learn something." With that dismissal, Harry took off down the corridors until he reached their rooms and entered, fully prepared to observe everything about the other man as he could.
It should be noted that these conditions are very rare, and caution should be used when any similar situations arise.’  Lucius showed the passages to Narcissa, and she gasped.
"Ugh what was that?"
“Ah, and what’s in the package?”
“Voldemort was quite pleased to see you dead, although he was disappointed that he didn’t get to kill you himself. While they were talking up here, my brave little Draco beheaded his awful snake with that Gryffindor sword Albus had so kindly forgotten the day before. While Voldemort was screaming at finally realizing what had happened, Lucius killed him.” She paused to take a gentle sip of her tea. “So you see Harry, we don’t want to be outcasts from society anymore. We were happy to do what needed to be done in order to avenge Lily’s death. I couldn’t sit back and watch you suffer in so many worse ways than Lily could have ever imagined. I can personally assure you, Draco in sincere in wanting to be friends and I am extremely sure that I would be honored to offer you a place to live when you aren’t attending school. I never got to treat you the way I wanted to. I was so excited when she announced her pregnancy to me, I wanted to dote on you and give you the world. She was so excited about it.”
“No Professor. No particular reason.” She eyed him shrewdly and stood before bidding him to follow her. He did and she led him straight to a set of gargoyles surrounding a door he’d never bothered to try to open.
“Draco, are you entirely sure I have to wear this?” Harry held up the offendingly dull black tie. “It’s so boring.” Draco turned to him, a heated glint in his eye that made Harry swallow whatever he was going to say next.
Lube, it turns out, was Harry’s newest favourite thing.
Harry bent down and kissed his lower back, a gesture that everything was okay. Harry was pleased to note that he relaxed without a word on his part. His first finger pressed against the pucker, and he waited, letting Draco know what was happening so he didn't panic. When he pressed back a little, Harry took that as his sign to start. He pressed it into the tight heat, and paused letting Draco relax around him. When he did, Harry moved his finger, searching the heat for his prostate and came up empty.
"Ahhhh, America. I did love this forest. Your father used to deeply enjoy coming here with me." Draco glanced at the painting and looked up at Harry.
“Harry, I was just wondering,” Harry smirked. He knew there was only two things Draco ‘just wondered’ about anymore and both of them had to do with Harry. “Our bond has gotten much stronger, wouldn’t you agree?” Before Harry could answer and before Draco lost his nerve, he continued. “I just thought that since the holidays start in a week, and since you’re spending the holidays at Malfoy Manor, I figured now would be the best time for use to continue on to the next part of our relationship.” He looked down, hating the way they had to separate. They both understood why it was necessary, but neither one of them liked it.
“Harry, if you can hear me...I know you probably can’t. But I needed to practice and I thought if maybe you weren’t fighting me on what I have to say then this would be easier to do when you wake up. I-I know I haven’t been very good to you. Anyone, really. I’ve been a right prat over the years and I’ve changed a lot over the summer. I just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you. I know you won’t want to talk to me...hell, you’d probably punch me if I gave you the chance. I just hope that one day we can put our past behind us. Maybe even be friends.” Harry squeezed his hand as hard as he could, and succeeded in moving his index and middle finger the slightest bit. “Thanks Harry. I know you won’t remember this. I just...I just wanted a little bit of practice so I would have some sort of courage to give you my apology letter.”
He couldn't have been happier to be here.
The snowflake had changed from a bright white to almost yellow and the edges drooped. Draco stared at the bracelet his mother gave to him when he started Hogwarts and felt a tear slide down his face.
The rest of the day passed in a blur, and Harry couldn't get to their rooms fast enough.
When I said I knew the implications of giving you the necklace, I realize I never told you. Well asked you, really. The necklace was made by the goblin Staklind. Perhaps you remember Binns mentioning him in class. He was the best crafter of goblin-made things from the beginning of time through the present. This happens to be his absolute piece, the last piece he ever finished and the first piece he started with. He spent almost a thousand years working on it to make it the masterpiece it is. When he finished, it was just before his death and right after a massive 'cleansing' of the goblin society.
“I think you grew a few inches and I shrunk a few.” Their voices were just whispers on the gentle breeze, and they both took notice of Harry’s in particular. It hadn’t raised a pitch, but it was more musical. Softer, and harmonious now. “Draco…” Draco pulled him closer and Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck.
They ate in relative silence, both wanting to break the silence, but neither knowing what to say.
But what happened to the famous Potter during the summer? When did he dye his hair, and why? Why did he pierce his face? Why does he wear makeup now? All of these questions are intriguing, but none like this: Why is Harry Potter suddenly spending so much time with the infamous Draco Malfoy, disowned son of Lucius Malfoy?
He was effectively trapped in this room with no way out.
"Calm down. Now. As Minerva has deemed herself ready to educate you still, she has decided that I am to take the place of Headmaster of this school along with my usual positions otherwise. No other changes have been made, and the rules still apply to each and every one of you. I expect you to all be respectful of the students who may be arriving within the next week or so as they have all lost loved ones and have needed to, if I may quote one parent, 'get our heads together and stop sniveling in front of others as that's not attractive at all.'" He sat down as food appeared. Harry only ate one bite before putting his fork down. Feeling Snape's steady gaze, he managed another few bites and then slightly shook his head at the plate.
"Yes, that's the general idea. Personally, I think everyone wants someone there to back me up in case something happened. The only problem with getting someone to be my partner that already works here is that I've worked up something of a reputation that people don't care for. They're afraid of me, which suits me just fine."
“I took the liberty of setting up an appointment at the Ministry. They’d like us to arrive in an hour, if you’d like to consult a Seer.” Harry could very well imagine that his cheeks would set fire to anything around them.
He was totally relaxed when he woke up, and he loved it.
“I suppose...well I supposed you and Mother would arrange a marriage for me so I can have children and carry on the Malfoy line.” His father’s brow creased.
"I...Harry that's...I'll do anything in my power before then. But if push comes to shove...I guess I have to honor your wishes."
“But you need someone to support you, too!” Draco smiled at that.
Harry made sure to clean Draco up very well before tucking him away and awaited further instruction. He didn’t have to wait long before Draco was telling him to stand up and follow him. Rising, Harry followed Draco out to the gardens and the two bid farewell to the congregation claiming an early morning the next day.
The Slytherin House decided to defend Harry and Draco during the day, while the others decided to insult them. It all blew up when some mindless first year let loose an insult next to Pansy.
"I mean that the magical community won't take kindly to their Savior having a baby with another man. Being gay is widely accepted, but they expect you to marry a beautiful woman and have ten kids in a cookie-cutter house with a gnome infestation." He walked out. "Just try to stay out of public places while he's pregnant, okay?" They quickly agreed and Draco put his head in his hands.
They both climbed into the bed, Harry having to almost-but-not-quite jump onto the tall bed, and stayed to their respective sides for about an hour and Draco had just started to drift off when Harry whimpered. He reached over and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair until they both settled into sleep.
"Potter. Can I...Can I come over?" Harry nodded and got up, letting the other wizard floo in.
A tripping hex hit him and he fell to the ground. He knew that he was dead, and yet he couldn't bring himself to care. He just wanted Harry safe.
“Mr. Potter, I presume?” Harry nodded. “I suppose there’s no way to meet you at the front door? I thought not,” he said after Harry shook his head. “Very well.” He flicked his wand and the bars disappeared from the window.
‘Harry’
"Why you terrible person! I will not lose my shape and I refuse to answer the second as I'm already dirt to society. I'm slightly offended. No, actually I'm really offended."
"Well, I was thinking about going to Luna's. She may have been a little airy in school, but she makes a mean meal." Pleased by the delighted look he got, he kissed Draco's hand and went to bed, as usual.
"You THINK?" Harry brushed a hand over his forehead and tried to calm him enough to get him to push like he needed to do.
"I always have fun with him, even if we're just having a conversation because we exchange friendly banter and sharpen our tongues without really cutting the other to ribbons. I like talking to him.
"Basic survival spells. You learned them yourself. Nutrition spells to keep you going until you find real food, cleaning spells, sleeping spells so you feel rested until you can sleep. I never left this chair."
"Yes Harry?"
"I did?" The fact that anything could scare Moody baffled him, even more so that Kingsley told him he was precisely the thing that could frighten him.
Harry groaned when he woke up to find the sun peeking over the horizon. Another day that he was left to the devices of the Dursley household. Things had been particularly bad this summer. Dudley had obtained a key to Harry’s prison and had made a regular habit of waltzing in when Harry had just started eating the one meal he was allowed a day and snatching it from his grasp. Sometimes he would just leave after that, throwing his soup on the floor so Harry had to lick it off the wood and sometimes he’d beat harry beyond passing out and take the food with him. It really depended on Dudley’s mood that day.
“Alright, alright! I get the point. And after all that we can get married?”
Had Draco never made fun of him or tormented him, the answer would be obvious. Ask Harry to be the second father. That as it may, he was still stuck between a rock and a hard place.
He turned Draco over and kissed featherlight kisses down his back, making random patterns across the expanse of marble-colored skin. He got down to his lower back and took his time, working the other man into a frenzy.
“Bloody ponce, you are!”
The next morning, Harry woke at five-thirty on the dot. It was a habit that not even Severus had been able to break him free of. He got up and started to make breakfast for himself and Draco when he didn't know if Draco would even be up before noon. He didn't have to worry about that for long though, as the man in question walked out of the bathroom at exactly five minutes after six.
He finished reading, a smile having crept up his lips. He really did like spending time together but Draco was right. They did have forever, after all.
"Why?"
“Oh come off it,” Draco exclaimed. “You’re Harry bloody Potter, of course everyone in the school wants to kiss you!” Harry just shrugged.
"Like a right git, actually. Pardon my language, but it's true."
“Narcissa, then. What’s wrong with your son? The whole lot of you, actually. No offence.” He could feel a blush creep up his cheeks at his rudeness.
"Sure we have our moments. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. Not if it meant I could keep sharing a mirror with him in the morning." Severus stopped him with a touch to his shoulder.
"I did, actually. No one else will deal with me. They don't want to be associated with an ex-Death Eater." He noticed that for once the other hadn't commented on something he had to say. He looked over curiously.
"I know it's hard for you. But you don't have to worry about anything anymore. I'm here for you, just as you were for me. So. Who would you feel most comfortable sharing a room with?" Harry looked up, surprised he was being given a choice to sleep with anyone at all.
The wedding didn’t take place until December of the following year. Harry had spent months renovating the property his parents had lived in the first few months of their marriage before they had to move to Godric’s Hollow to go into hiding and then Narcissa and Hermione spent the next year planning for their wedding to take place on the property.
He expected Draco to leave him then, but he didn't. Instead he felt his arms wrap around him tighter. They held him to his chest, something Harry wasn't too sure what to think of. His body relaxed, but his mind was supplying a stream of unpleasant memories, all of which made him cry even harder. He didn't know what to think anymore.
And apparently Draco had the same idea, because when he woke up, he was right next to him, watching him sleep.
Originally he was just going to wear something he had bought in a muggle store, but chose against it. He wasn't so sure that it would be a good idea to wear anything in his closet that wasn't robes as it would just spell out 'hey I'm homosexual, come get some if you're a guy'. He wasn't ready for that with Potter yet.
"Ughn...no. I felt fine before I flooed but now..." He felt himself falling impossibly slowly to the ground. Just before he passed out, he saw those green eyes he had found him staring at more and more as their school life slowly came to a close. He woke up, terribly sore. "Ugh..." His throat felt like someone placed a swelling charm on it.
"Sorry! I didn't mean-" He was cut off as fits of hysteria slowly clawed their way through Draco's throat.
Harry met the question with annoyance and pure lust. The pain was still there, stronger than ever, but the desire was overpowering it. He heard Draco chuckling and felt another wave of lust crash over his senses as Draco sent him an image of him, on his knees between the blond’s legs. He was begging, whimpering with need both in his mind and in the image.
“He doesn’t know, does he?”
“Harry Potter has never kissed anyone?” Harry shook his head again, trying not to giggle from the way Draco’s mouth hung open. “Never?”
“Mother said she’d be more than willing to help you learn how to manage it all. Father lacks the patience so she offered in his stead.”
On Sunday, Draco sent Harry to lunch without him. He used the excuse of needing a shower, but really he wanted to start teasing him.
Reluctantly, Harry pushed the blond out of his mind and answered his fire-call.
"When I was fourteen, Petunia had sent Dudley to a friend's house for the week while Vernon was at a business meeting in America. She raped me.
Hence, the crying.
"With Voldemort being the entire focus of my life, I never really knew how to have fun. I could never do anything I wanted-it was always what the public wanted of their Savior. I've wanted to be like this my entire life, and the fact that I couldn't because of society hurt but I dealt with it.
"Harry...will you be alright? Do you want me to stay in here for the night?" He expected the words to be coming from Severus, but instead they were coming from Draco. He sighed, and reached out for him.
‘I had this specially charmed. The chain won’t get tangled or grab at your hair and the pendant is meant to give off a subtle glow if I’m thinking about you. And before you ask, I had commissioned the piece a few days ago. It will also warm slightly if someone is lying to you. It won’t burn, but the warmer it is, the more severe the lie. I think it’s time you knew when people were hiding the truth from you.
Harry picked Draco up and quickly apparated them to their Healer and put him down on a bed before yelling for someone. Eventually after a panic-filled minute, a Healer appeared and started shouting instructions to other Healers who propped Draco up the way he needed to be. The tried to kick Harry out, and he let them have it worse than Draco was letting him have it.
“I’ve never kissed anyone, taller or shorter.”
Harry stopped his train of thought right there. He was NOT in Draco's position and vice versa. So there was no need considering it. The real question was would he be patient enough to stay with Draco if he was abandoned?
“I don’t want it to affect our relationship. I’ll tell you if you want, but you have to promise you won’t let it bother you.” Harry agreed readily. He always was too curious for his own good.
“Students, welcome! I am Professor McGonagall, transfiguration teacher and Deputy Headmistress for Hogwarts. You will be led to the front of the Great Hall to be sorted into your house. The four houses are named as such: Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each one represents a different quality; kindness, courage, knowledge and ambition. Your house will become your family away from home in your time here. I expect you to treat one another with respect and kindness regardless of your house.” She led them inside to be sorted as the doors opened.
Draco simply handed him a present and told him to get unwrapping already.
Piles of presents were stacked around the tree in the living room. Even Severus had a pile of goodies. Wrappings soon littered the floor as gifts were uncovered and cherished by the Malfoys, Harry and Severus alike.
He ran the three miles within an hour and promptly started doing push-ups. He'd never admit it to his partner, but he actually enjoyed the exercise much more when he did it right.
Harry, still in Draco's arms, simply laid there to contemplate what had been told to him. After what seemed like forever, Harry finally found something worth saying along with the voice to say it with.
The longer the house was quiet, the more nervous Harry got.
"Merlin's Beard Harry! It's getting late and you need rest. I'll wake you up so you can get packed."
At that moment, it wasn’t Draco Malfoy that Harry was looking at. It was his mate. His beautiful, radiant and very happy mate. Their arms wrapped around each other and they stood there, embracing each other in their wings. Harry felt the tugging stop, and in its place he felt his magic slowly traveling out of him and towards Draco. He didn’t need to panic though, as he could feel Draco’s pouring into him just as quickly.
Harry’s body continued to fight Vernon off until it collapsed with exhaustion. Starving him seemed to do the trick. He could hardly fend for himself, leaving him too exhausted to even cry out anymore. Harry’s mind shut down, unable to comprehend what was happening to him. His involuntary screams eventually ripped his throat so raw he had no voice left.
Harry squinted at her, unsure of her motives. She seemed genuinely sorry, so he nodded his head before wincing a little at the throbbing pain that came with that action. She beamed, while she poured him a small glass of water.
“Ah, yes. Harry, my boy, how have things been?” Dumbledore turned away from one of his delicate looking machines that was magically whirring in the background to look at Harry. “Please, sit down. You’re not in any trouble, I assure you.” He sat, feeling much less nervous now. He couldn’t help being nervous. Every time he had been called here before he was either finding out bad news or getting into trouble.
"Malfoy, would you like to talk to my godfather while I chat with your sister? She really is quite delightful." Curiosity got the better of him and he figured, why not? Harry held his hand out and the picture fell into his hand. He then enlarged it and handed it to Draco.
"My team and I have managed to get him to a slightly better state, but not by much. The only thing we could do to help him was to put him into a magically started coma. He can awaken at any time, and we assume that he'd want to wake up with someone he knows. Do you know of anyone that could fit these requirements?"
“No, Ron. I’m just done. I’ve got somewhere else to be, now move.”
"Harry? What's wrong?" Without anyone noticing, Draco had come to.
So why didn’t Harry feel worse about what he’d said?
"Why the needing-to-help feelings Harry?"
The severity of the damage was worse than he had thought, but at least it was readable. Of course, Draco would have to wait until the next day when the culprit would come back to give him a tongue-lashing. He never took it lightly when someone would write in a book-why wouldn't you just write your notes on some parchment and stick it in between the pages like any respectable person would do?
"But...why?"
"You really should learn to get dressed when you know you have company coming over." Draco jumped.
That night, Draco woke up at the sound of a dull thud and walked out to see what happened. He noticed that Harry's godfather was still awake, and trying not to laugh.
Could life punish him any more thoroughly?
The only interesting thing that happened (besides being the youngest seeker in a century) was the TriWizard Tournament. Harry had been incredibly relieved that there was an age limit on the goblet as well as a 24-hour watch overseen by trained ministry officials. He thought he’d enjoy seeing the tournament, a blessed break from all the studying, but he found that the insane amounts of danger most definitely wasn’t his cup of tea. He left the stands halfway through the first task and didn’t bother going to watch any of the others when they happened, preferring to stay in the library with Hermione studying.
"Making pizza. Why?"
Hogwarts was going to be extremely hard this year.
“It is though! Don’t you get it? He has girls practically lifting their legs at their hero. Think about it, he’s a hero and everyone wants him because of that! Could you imagine how he’d feel if he thought I was manipulating my way into his heart simply because of his celebrity status? It’s not worth it. I’d rather die.”
"I was crying because I don't want to be anything like them. I don't want this child to have to see the horrors of the world like I've seen them. The news is one thing, gossip is one thing. But experience? That's an entirely different realm of unthinkable things. I can't let that happen, and in my dream...In my dream it was just like it was with Vernon and his time raping me, abusing me. But in his place, I was there and in my place was...an empty spot that I knew was supposed to harbor our child."
‘When one is powerful enough to go through the change faster than a year, the loneliness will be overpowering. All of it will hit all at once, usually rendering the creature useless at everything including; self preservation, self defense, eating, and even walking is impaired. It is imperative that the creature have someone they trust completely to help them. Physical comfort from this person will help alleviate some of the pain and will assist in getting them to take care of themselves on their own.
"I seem to recall catching you in second year with your diary stunt. What made you think you could fool me this time?" He turned to Lestrange. "And what made you think I wouldn't avenge Sirius?"
“Can I shower first?” His voice was so quiet, he wasn’t sure he had said it at all. Draco smiled at him and showed him to the bathroom where he touched a box next to the shower. “What’s that?”
The kiss they shared was searing, burning with silent pleas and desire. It eventually softened and spoke only of love and tenderness. Harry’s cheeks were flushed and Draco’s eyes burned with passion and regret. He truly didn’t want to leave, but he understood it was necessary to their relationship.
‘P.S. Don’t leave anything behind, you won’t be back there this summer to retrieve it for school.’
He placed a hand on Harry’s back gently but firmly, holding out a handkerchief so Harry could wipe his eyes. He did so, but he was still shaking.
His eyes flew open, and he sat up. Did he really just hear Draco say he would do it? He had to, his ears never lied to him. Never. And judging by the was Sev was smirking, he didn't hear wrong. His day just started to perk up.
"No...it's fine. I'm just not used to talking about her. No one ever knew...Not even my father knew. I've only ever talked about her with Mother." He could feel his resolve slipping. Giving in, he took her charm and enlarged it.
"You just have to be in a room close enough that if you hear something you can wake me up pretty quickly." Draco nodded.
Ron had grown quite close to him and his obnoxious traits seemed to dissipate and left Harry quite pleased with their friendship. By the time they went back to Hogwarts, they were inseparable.
Needless to say, the two were utterly exhausted when the night ended somewhere in the early hours of the next day. Narcissa produced a portkey for the two and with many smiles, the two were off to their honeymoon.
Harry felt like an arse. Here was someone who seems like they want to help and he had just snapped at them. Although, he didn’t feel too bad as this was the one person who had come after him again and again in school.
Draco sighed and rested a hand on his stomach, the way Harry had watched Hermione do so many other times when she's pregnant. Harry thought it must be a mother thing, some form of ancient instincts taking over when they don't pay attention to what they're doing.
Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Ron really was concerned or if Ron was more annoyed with acting like he was concerned.
"But as for spending as much time with Draco Malfoy as I have, I just decided that a schoolboy grudge wasn't worth a lifetime of fighting with someone for no apparent reason. Draco saved my life and for that, I felt that it was time to put a petty argument away, permanently. He agreed, and we now share private rooms to prevent harassment and to better our studies. It's easier for us to concentrate in a quiet room alone than with an entire other House or in the library where whispers are sent across bookshelves." Harry got up and left, leaving the reeling writer alone and walked swiftly down the hallway. He could hear Draco behind him, giving him room and time to think before catching up to him in their rooms.
He looked up after a few minutes of not feeling the body move away from him and was shocked to see Harry's face so close to his. They were just a moth's wing apart, and yet so far away. Draco heard a small whimper-like noise come out from the back of his throat before he felt soft lips press against his.
Lucius closed the door softly behind him as Narcissa took up her diligent post by the bedside, ready to take Harry’s hand once more to attempt to comfort him from reality while he wrestled with the changes happening to his body and the events of the last twenty four hours.
After she closed the door, Harry groaned and let his head sink into the pillow under him. It seemed he would have to trust the Malfoy family to help take care of him. But if Dumbledore trusts them, then so should I. After all, Malfoy did say he would tell me his secrets under the truth potions effects…that’s got to count for something.
“Well...you see…” He looked to his lap and his fidgeting hands. He wasn’t entirely sure how to start so he took a deep breath and hoped that he could spew out everything all at once to make it easier.
"Don't go. Please." He couldn't voice much more than that, but as he felt the body next to him disappear, he sat up. "You don't have to...I mean...You can sleep in your bed..." He knew he looked utterly clueless as to what he was getting at, but he truly didn't want to be left alone and he didn't want to freak Draco out. There seemed to be no middle for him with anything.
All too soon the sun was coaxing them out of bed. Harry was still half asleep as Draco practically carried him to the kitchen. He groaned and rubbed his eyes open as he was set into a bar stool at the island. He didn’t hurt, but he was sore from their activities the night prior. Draco passed by him, getting them both glasses of pumpkin juice.
Harry drifted in and out of consciousness. Never enough to fully understand what was going on, but he first caught sounds of two people talking. He caught that one sounded remorseful. The next time he drifted back, it was to smell the flowers. Such a sweet smell...followed by some talk of an apology? He let himself drift again.
"Yes Harry?"
“You won’t always have to tote them around like that. There will be some unavoidable circumstances when they will emerge, but from now on it will be painless from what I understand. You won’t be able to hide them for awhile, but over time you will gain control over them, and the rest of your appearance as well.” Harry’s eyes jerked from the ceiling back to the blond.
On some level, he knew she was right. He knew he was stressed and tense and anxious, especially at night when he knew Ron was in the same room as him. But he also knew that she wouldn’t be telling him this if it wasn’t important.
"I don't see why it would have ever ended."
“We’re too drunk to be having this conversation right now, drink that.” The potion kicked in remarkably quickly; you could see the exact moment Harry sobered up in his facial expression.
“I’d find someone to love and live my life with them. Whatever happens after that happens.” Draco didn’t realize it, but he was smiling softly at the idea of living in a reasonably sized house with small children running around and the knowledge that somewhere in the place was a husband all too happy to welcome him home. Before that thought could progress much farther, his father stood and rested a hand on his shoulder.
He almost choked on his coffee when he realized that he actually cared for the blond more than even Sirius made him realize. He figured it was just a friendship, tentative as it was, and nonsexual.
Harry stood there confidently awaiting Draco's response. He was prepared for rage, anger, surprise, disbelief, betrayal. Anything but what actually happened.
Her yelling from earlier had summoned the other three men from down the hall, and they had arrived in time to hear her voice change. Lucius was the first to speak.
"Oh..." His godfather sounded a little put-out, and then Harry remembered he had a partner again.
“Thank you.” He smiled, a rare occurrence when people other than his family might see and helped Harry stand so he could give him a hug. He laughed when he saw Harry’s shocked expression.
Harry seemed to be getting the brunt of the loneliness all at once, and none of the bond. A tear slipped down Draco’s cheek. It had only been a few months for him and the hollow loneliness was already intense. He couldn’t imagine getting a year’s worth all at once.
He then proceeded to attempt to explain to himself exactly what the other man was doing, throwing that batch of dough in the air like that. It looked ridiculous and fun at the same time and he couldn't make heads or tails of what he was doing.
And, of course, the observation he made was that it sounded like it looked like he liked the other romantically.
He watched him run the whole way, and promptly passed out when he saw him stop by the tree and start doing push-ups on his own.
They sat down just as the food was sent up from the kitchens and Harry ate as much as he knew he could take before anyone else came in. He managed a small muffin and a piece of toast along with half a goblet of water. Draco eyed him oddly, but Harry ignored it.
‘Ahh, so you do have courage in you. Better be...GRYFFINDOR!”
“Ron you weren’t invited. You need to leave.” Ron’s face went from bright and cheerful to dark and scary.
After his first summer back with the Dursley’s he learned rather quickly that Hedwig was not only unwelcome but in danger of being outright murdered. He had managed to sneak her out when Vernon had gotten too drunk to remember the lock and Harry had convinced him the next morning that Vernon had thrown her out of the open window and then slammed him into his cupboard. He claimed he hit his head and didn’t remember anything after that and the couple believed him.
Well, he always said he hated surprises, but deep down he actually loved them. He just couldn't wait to see what Harry was planning. For planning Harry was. It became apparent in November when he had left for Diagon Alley, under the cover of Christmas presents.
“In second year, he was so disappointed that you hadn’t changed your mind over the summer that he wrote home the very first night to express how disappointed he was. In third year, he wasn’t even upset that Miss Granger had punched him in the nose. He was upset he couldn’t seem to ever get it right. That’s when he stopped pursuing your friendship, albeit in an odd way, and started observing you from afar. He’s always ribbed your friends, because he was jealous of them. He wanted that closeness to you, although he couldn’t figure out why.” She saw the question sparkling in Harry’s eyes then. “No, I won’t tell you why. I figured it out fairly quickly, but I won’t be divulging that information until he wants to tell you himself.” She rocked herself in the chair that had been next to Draco’s spot and continued.
And, he'd admit it, he wanted to know what it felt like to hold his waist in such an intimate manor. He wanted to know if it would be calming to both of them or if it was just to comfort the poor boy. Or maybe he did it just to satisfy his own curiosity. He often found himself wondering just how thin the other had gotten over the years. He was surprised when his hand rested on a hip that wasn't as bone-y as he had expected.
Harry picked him up and hurriedly apparated to St. Mungos, straight into an empty healing room. A healer jumped and hid all trace of shock upon seeing the pale man in Harry's arms. She had him set him down in a bed and ran several spells, when a team of seven or eight ran in, all slightly winded from the long run.
He just hoped that he wouldn't get there before he could take care of his need to let lose a few tears.
The two had been more than happy when the wedding day started without any problems. It wasn’t until just after Harry had gotten dressed that things started to crumble. Harry had spotted Ron.
It was the single best feeling he had ever felt when Draco slid into him. Sure, it burned and wasn’t at all the slight twinge he had felt at first. But Draco was gentle and took his time, something that Harry greatly appreciated now. Slow thrusts gently rocked him in just a little bit at a time until he was finally sheathed in Harry completely. The two moaned and lost themselves in the sensations, both practically screaming when Harry’s prostate had been hit and then again when they came.
“Guys, I really don’t think I’ll end up getting an inheritance. I just don’t see how that’s in my cards. Plus, my magic is fine. It’s just the stress of having to leave Hogwarts next month…” He trailed off, something neither one of his friends took notice of. Pushing his plate away, he left the Great Hall as they were talking amongst themselves about the perks and disadvantages of having a mate would be.
"So...You're sister? I don't mean to impose...I just never knew you had a sibling...Just forget I ever said anything..."
"Um...Are you happy?"
He had managed to stop himself by grabbing onto the door jam and he just gazed at Harry. He was in his veela form, his cheeks tinted pink and the air around him crackled with excitement and anticipation.
All of the gifts had come with only one thing written on a piece of parchment: 'Curtosy of your secret admirer'.
Lock after lock was being undone, winding Harry up with so much suspense that he almost passed out. When the door finally burst open, it slammed against the wall with the force that had been behind it. Vernon was purple with rage already, hands fisted at his sides and steam practically pouring out of his ears. He turned to slam the door shut and locked it from the inside. Harry’s eyes opened wide with fear. Vernon had never locked the door from the inside before, he had never even closed the door. Dudley usually watched, blocking the one exit that would be temporarily available to him.
“You will be going with them for the beginning of the summer while I call upon my favors. But rest assured, I will be getting you out of their house before your birthday. It isn’t a sure thing that you’ll get an inheritance, but I do not wish for them to find you in a weakened state if you do.” After a few more pleasantries, Dumbledore dismissed Harry for lunch and called the potions master to his office to square a few things away.
"Why?"
"So, you willing to give it a go?" Draco nodded. "Good. Then I'll meet you at your manor at four in the morning. Be dressed in loose shorts, a tank top, and running shoes. Don't bother with your hair or a shower. It won't matter in the end."
Anger at that boiled in Harry’s veins. The patronus charm was extremely hard to pull off for him, having had so few happy experiences in his life strong enough for it to even work. He’d had to fabricate a memory, falsify the feeling of happiness in order to produce the corporeal form and spent months just trying to get a wisp to appear. To hear his best friend say that he must not have to try if he can’t explain it to him was maddening. In the end, he calmed himself. After all, Ron had to deal with being overshadowed at home. It must be hard dealing with your best friend seeming to do better than you as well.
"You don't need me to come in?"
"See...us three used to play a truth game when we were younger and we could get rid of Peter. Bottle of truth potion, and a bottle of a muggle hangover remedy. Nasty stuff. Anyway, we could either drink the truth serum and answer one question or drink the hangover remedy and risk puking all over. Most disgusting thing ever." Sirius pulled a face.
“No Harry, you aren’t. Trust me when I say this, I know you are not well. I’m staying for this. I want to help you.” Harry started to panic. Draco couldn’t know what happened to him. He couldn’t find out what had happened at the Dursley’s this summer, he was sure to blast it all over the school. “Harry, I’ve changed a lot over the summer. I won’t tell anyone. I’ll even confide in you some of my secrets under the veritaserum potion that I have in my room. Whatever it takes to let you let me help you.”
"Shush. Just sleep, I don't mind. Really." Draco's voice was soft and calming, something that Harry had thought impossible in their younger years. He had quickly realized lately that he wasn't always a huge pratt. He relaxed, just enough to close his eyes.
“Good morning Harry. Happy Christmas.” Draco’s voice was rough with sleep and Harry inhaled to respond. He smelled like vanilla and cinnamon, and maybe star anise? Cardamom? There was definitely a hint of orange as well.
They had practically collapsed against each other when they landed, but with a dose of pepperup potion each they were in much better control of their limbs. In fact, if the heated looks Draco was throwing his way was any indication, they wouldn’t be sleeping anytime soon.
"I was lonely..." These words surprised him. Draco Malfoy, lonely?
Being immersed in his thoughts, he didn't feel the weight leave the other side of the couch. He jumped when he felt small, but unyielding, hands start massaging the stress from his shoulders. He stayed tense with surprise for a fraction of a second, and then promptly relaxed, not caring about anything as long as those hands continued to work the knots out of his shoulders and neck.
"You have a sister?"
“Thank you Draco.” Draco smiled and the two spent the rest of the day lounging in the Room of Requirement before dragging themselves to the holiday feast. There was only a handful of people there so there was only one table in the Great Hall which gave the two a good excuse for sitting next to one another.
"Poor Remus never knew what hit him. He already knew he swung both ways, but it was kind of a shock for him when he figured out he loved me too. I never brought it up, but he did one day.
"I won't." Harry grabbed the picture and shrunk him. Harry tied a piece of leather around the hook of Sirius's painting and tied it around his neck. Sirius gave him a spell to make sure he wouldn't come off until he wanted to come off.
Draco had looked around when Harry left, looking for something to do. His eyes spotted a book, and he picked it up, fully intending to read it. He had recognized the cover and knew it was Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare. He just adored the Friar because he never actually lied. Clearly Shakespeare went to Hogwarts and knew about the House qualities.
"Don't bite your lip. I want to hear you moan in pleasure not groan in pain because you bit through your lip. They're too pretty for that." The other man immediately stopped and looked up at Harry, pleading with his eyes.
“I thought you two might need this. Consider it an early Christmas gift to the two of you. Lucius and I will be away for a few days; he’s got some business in Ireland and I’ve always wanted to go.” A dreamy look glazed her eyes over. “Have fun dears!” With that she shut their door softly and a few minutes later they heard the distinctive sound of the floo flaring to life as they were on their way.
Harry’s cheeks flushed with a tint of color. “I don’t know French,” his voice was soft but the embarrassment shone through. “Don’t worry, angel. I learned it just so I could come here with my parents. Seemed such a waste for them to go through all the trouble of getting me on their list of approved reservations for me to now know how to communicate to them. It would be quite rude of me to make them speak in English, even though the entire staff must be bilingual. I can order for you, if you’d be okay with it.” Harry slowly nodded. It was better than looking like an idiot.
“Well, you better believe it young man. I’ve been awaiting your owl for several weeks now, we’d best be off. You’ve got some shopping to do and if my memory serves correctly, you won’t be getting it done with these two lay-abouts. Come along now.” The woman named Professor McGonagall reached out and took his hand, leading him towards the door. Since the only complaint he heard from his aunt and uncle were sputters of indignation at being called lay-abouts, he went with her. Surely wherever she was taking him was a happier place than with the Dursley family.
“Draco, I’m fine, really-” He was cut off by Draco’s snort.
Dumbledore’s eyes sparked. “Of course Harry, come in.” They rode the stairs up to his office and he held out a small container of floo powder. “I’m sure they added you to their wards by now. You should be able to get through without a problem. I’ll have your things sent to you.” Harry didn’t even see him wink. He had grabbed a handful of powder and was gone with a whoosh of green flames before Dumbledore had finished talking.
