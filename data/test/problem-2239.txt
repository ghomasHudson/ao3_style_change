Harry had nearly forgotten the intensity of Draco’s full attention, the vibrant shades of grey in his eyes, the elegant shape, and beautiful long lashes. He had tried to bury just how painfully similar his eyes were to Scorpius’s, the only child to carry them. He would have a reminder of his son right here, and Harry was no longer afraid of that truth.
“At least let me walk you out,” Dean mutters, reaching a hand out to touch his shoulder. Harry jerks back from the touch, shaking his head.
, he's an unmitigated arse and I’d have to seriously re-examine your main mental functions had you slept with him.”
“Welcome. My name is Andrew and I’ll be your server this beautiful evening. Can I get you lovely gentlemen started on something to drink besides water?” Before Harry can answer, Draco starts talking.
“I may not be able to use magic, Queensbury, but I know where every pressure point in your body is. I
Now finally free from consuming the proverbial Pureblood punch, Draco questions the absurdity of Tracey’s predicament. He had realised that there were a number of insidious reasons why Tracey and her family had been disrespected so thoroughly by the Pureblood community in comparison to, say, the Bulstrodes. It made his blood boil, to think about it now. If he had to be forced into a marriage that soon after Hogwarts, he would have gladly accepted Tracey’s proposal. She’s smart, wickedly funny, and not to mention, drop dead gorgeous. Her honey brown eyes were almost as sharp as her fiery wit.
She smirks at him, shaking her head as her gaze sweeps over Draco’s boys. “Oh, Draco! You must pay attention to them!” she giggles. “Aren’t they just little
It struck him, as he was pulling on his clothes, Harry watching him under hooded eyes, that Draco had spent months falling for Harry, spending time with him and wanting him. It wouldn’t be far fetched if his feelings spilled out into some of his every day activities. Like love-sick teens who draw hearts in the margins of their notepads, perhaps Draco had illustrated his feelings somewhere, too. And as soon as he thought about it, the memory came easily, and painlessly, to the forefront of his mind.
Draco gives into the distress in Potter’s voice. Sitting up in bed once more, he drags his hands from under the comfort of his duvet to briefly press the heels of his palms against his eyes, trying to stave off sleep. “Fine. Do you remember anything before you died?”
Potter visibly cringes before taking a deep breath and exhaling. He places his hands on his hips and nods. “Fine, okay. But if I say that bloke is giving off some serious bad vibes, we
“He looks like he belongs on the bloody cover of some hip magazine,” Harry whispers, his gaze snapping back to Malfoy. It
“A Kodak Motormatic 35,” he said fondly, eyes twinkling. “Everyone thought I was mad for loving Muggle products, but never Molly. She would listen to me go on about cameras, fridges, automobiles.” Molly placed her hand on his knee and gave a squeeze.
Rushing towards the front door, Harry nearly yanks it free from its hinges to get it open. Sitting on the first step in front of their house is Albus with Lily in his lap, his little arms wrapped tightly around her.
“That’s all right. It wasn’t one of my favourites anyway.” Draco stares at him, his watery,  stormy grey eyes bloodshot.
“He went in the loo by the kitchens whens Nana left. When Nana didn’t come stop the smoke, I membered what you said about fires. Me and Lily crawled on our tummies down the stairs to the door and—”
The walk to Granger’s new office is a wordless affair rife with tension so strong that halfway through their journey Draco feels an actual cramp in his neck and shoulders from the stress. There is no significant conversation between them, their earlier exchange of barbed insults hanging like a foul odour in the air, exacerbating the wedge of distrust and hatred that’s existed between them since the very first day they met. Draco can sense that Potter is holding his tongue, probably for the first time in his incredibly short-lived, moronic life. Even in death the man is frustrating. Draco has to push away the budding desire to lash out at Potter with a fiery force that’s a culmination of pure fury and indignation. Though, Draco's acutely aware that something at the core of him has shifted from the encounter. Potter’s anger and surprising cruelty exposed a truth about Draco’s crumbling health.
His mother begins the preparations for the annual Pre-Débutante Jewell Party, which involves her traveling back and forth from Dany’s to Malfoy Manor. To be on the safe side, Draco closes up his London townhouse indefinitely, and urges Narcissa to spend her time with Dany as much as possible. As a high-powered figure, Dany is always surrounded by security, and her own house is heavily warded to hell and back, just like the Manor. Surprised by his sudden desire to be in his ancestral home, Draco’s convinced his mother that he just needs to get in some fresh country air before the Season is over. Even though his mother has kept him away from the party planning and the remodelling happening within the Manor, he doesn’t complain, as this provides him the opportunity to hide Sprinkles in one of the many rooms of the Manor when she’s around. He feels safer than ever with the ancient wards surrounding the house and the movement of several house elves cleaning, cooking, and generally checking in on his wellbeing. It’s one week to the end of July. He doesn’t know how he’s keeping it all together: going to work (even though he’s dragging his feet on the case), seeing Harry regularly, seeing his friends, preparing for his next Society event, all while knowing someone is going to try to kill him
emails of healthy recipes, coming over to his place for tea with takeaway from the nearest up-and-coming vegan restaurant, and urging him to go gluten-free in every other conversation— “
Hermione rolled her eyes. “No shame in admitting defeat. Give it here. It’s much too expensive to break.”
“Well shan,” Oliver starts. “But don’t pout, m’eudail, I thought you did great,” he says kissing Draco fully on the lips. There’s a collective “yes,” and “yeah, sure,” that goes around before Hermione stands.
he’s ended up on the floor of this loo. It’s a huge, posh loo, too. The floor is so clean he could probably eat off it. The thought sends his head into the toilet once more, though.
Blaise tosses back his shot of Swott Malt Whisky. “She is such a beacon of unreserved kindness and joy, our Pansy,” he says. “That was as great an endorsement as I’ve ever seen from her.”
Draco can hear Blaise gasp as Lyra erupts from his wand. He had named his Patronus after the constellation that borders his own. Her long, thin body stretches as she tilts her head up, mouth opening in a wide yawn as she shakes her body, as if waking up from a very, very long sleep. Draco drops down to his knees in front of her, his vision blurring as he gazes upon the beautiful, silvery greyhound.
Harry shifts ever so slightly to the left to get a better look at him. He notices with a flare of incredulity that Malfoy’s white blond hair is styled in a long undercut, the top of his hair slightly wavy and tousled, falling to the side and into his eyes. He’s used to seeing Malfoy’s hair short and slicked back, but this haircut is just so…muggle. He also has a large brown leather messenger bag slung across his body and he’s just so bloody at ease in this very muggle surrounding that it rattles Harry to the core.
Bitty turns her nose up. “Blaise,” Bitty starts, turning to face him. “Darling, I’m so sorry for hitting you. I was caught in the moment. You know how I get, my love. I shouldn’t become so angry so fast when you suggest the right course of action. You’re so very right to think we should go home now.”
—growing inside of me. We’ve both seen some of it manifest. I don’t want to lose the ability to feel or my humanity. I don’t want to become a monster, Draco,” Potter whimpers.
“Unfortunately,” he says with a sheepish shrug. “But no hard feelings, yeah, mate?” he asks, gaze locking onto Malfoy’s.
Draco reaches around her to shake their hands before Luna tugs him back. “I have to say, I almost didn’t come, but then Harry told me you would be here and that you two are actually
“I’m eleven weeks.” The kitchen erupts in cheers once again, Slytherins, Gryffindors and an assortment of others all at once. Pansy suddenly appears beside Hermione to scoop her up for a kiss on the cheek, then pulling Ron away from his mates slapping him on the back for a kiss on the cheek as well. Hermione giggles as Draco wraps her into a hug once Pansy let’s her go.
“Don’t be silly. I’m sure it was Pansy having your bollocks in a vice-grip that made you come out tonight.”
Draco shrinks into himself when several people turn to stare at him, their eyes immediately dropping to Harry’s grasp on his elbow. They probably think Harry’s apprehending him, or about to throw him out of the pub. If only Draco had the courage to grasp Harry’s hand right now, in front of all these curious gazes. They make it to the bar. Hannah immediately comes up to Harry.
“I’ll, er, just go take care of that,” Harry says, setting his plate onto the coffee table and hurrying out of the room. Draco tosses his plate of crust onto the table, quickly getting to his feet and snatching his wand up from the side table. He mutters a spell to quiet his footsteps and cancel the Muffliato Harry throws up. Draco stands just outside the slightly ajar office, his hand resting against the wall as he inclines his head towards the opening.
Losing himself in a stranger isn’t going to pull him from the trenches of his anger and despair. He takes a deep breath.
the bulk of trauma you’ve experienced in the last several years, especially from the war. Your difficult breakups haven’t helped in that regard, either. You just...I’m just worried that you may be depressed, Harry.”
“I understand. I just ask that when you do, you come at the situation with an open heart and an open mind.”
Smith shakes him. “Shut your mouth, you filthy Death Eater,” Smith says, voice hard, glaring down at Draco. His eyes flicker down to Draco’s mouth, and Draco’s stomach lurches. “You think you’re so much better than me, eh?”
—is now standing in the corner, arms wrapped around itself as It stares forlornly at Draco, head shaking from side-to-side.
“It is!” Ginny says, suddenly appearing in the kitchen, her sequined green shirt sparkling in the bright light. Pansy had surprised Ginny with a three month long vacation that involved traveling to cities all over the world after proposing to her. They were getting married next month on Christmas Eve. “Hermione, you’d be crazy not to have a glass,” Ginny says, pouring herself a helping.
“Does anyone have a tampon?” asks Tracey in frustration, sliding on socked feet into the kitchen. She checks her wristwatch. “Anyone? Please, hurry? I’m late for my shift and you all know how fucking obnoxious the Goblins are in the morning.”
Quirking a brow, Draco finds Millicent’s name listed next to Luna’s, pointed at Home. He hadn’t known that Mills and Potter were close enough that she’d earn a spot on his precious clock. Longbottom and his wife Abbott are pointed at Diagon Alley, Finnegan and Thomas, Travelling.
Harry would have gone through the war twice if it meant he could have avoided yesterday. Al hadn’t wanted a party or presents, unable to celebrate his birthday without his twin. He instead wanted to visit Scorpius’s grave. The creature had been catatonic the entire time and had disappeared as soon as Harry Apparated the children back home.
“An utterly wonderful, beautiful, enigmatic mess,” Theo says with a crooked grin, running a hand through his wild brown locks before shaking his head.
Anxiety sets in. It trickles down Harry’s spine and for a moment he can hardly breathe. He tries to recall if he’s ever heard Andromeda call Teddy Thea and for the life of him he can’t. Harry hurries up and ties Teddy’s other shoe. When he’s done, he then cradles Teddy’s tiny hands in his own. He stares into his child’s eyes, searching,
“Harry, breathe in and out slowly! You’re safe, you’re at home, nothing can hurt you...it’s okay, it’s
Pansy hums. “Let’s not waste it then,” she says, carefully setting down the enormous black portfolio on a large work table.
” he says, voice muffled. “All this time I’ve been saying he didn’t want to get married,” Draco wheezes. “The truth is he just didn’t want to marry
. The flask is connected to my family’s collection and I promise you, you’ll never taste gin this good.”
When Harry continues to shout, Smith screams out in frustration. “Shut him the fuck up!” he snarls at his friend, who scrambles to do so, dropping his wand.
“Excuse me, Sir, your macchiatos are ready.” Malfoy stands even straighter, if possible, and spins on his heel to face the woman. He thanks her graciously and slips a few coins —
Harry doesn’t know exactly what the question is really for, but with Draco’s voice pitched so low, and filled with such uncertainty and yes, he can hear it,
, his mind is flooding with images of snogging Dean in the men’s toilet, the feel of the other man pressed against him,
Potter laughs, his expression fond. “It’s okay, not everyone has it. And I should’ve asked, I’m sorry. I mean...are you?”
“I’m your supplier, baby, not your voice of reason,” Theo says smoothly, curling an arm around Millie’s shoulders to pull her flush against him.
“The Weasleys don’t wanna drag it on,” Millicent shrugs, taking a seat across from Draco. “Molly’s barely coherent.”
“I would say so, yes. Things were simpler in Paris. I wasn’t so viscerally hated there, for one. I’m eternally grateful that I had the opportunity to get away from Britain after the war.” Draco draws in a breath and exhales it slowly through his nostrils, a giddy spark of anxiety shooting through him as he prepares to say something he’s been holding in for years. “I don’t - I don’t think I ever properly thanked you for your testimony. I wouldn’t have been able to grow or reclaim a modicum of my autonomy without it. I’m indebted to you. I owe you so much, and yet, I don’t even know where to begin in repaying you.” Draco feels a bit dizzy, and there’s a fierce burning in his chest. He feels overwhelmed but also relieved that he’s finally saying this to Potter.
“The Northern Line is a bloody oven,” Draco says before he engulfs Harry in an awkward half-hug. Harry shakes himself. It’s not awkward, no. They do this all the time. They hug hello and hug goodbye and Draco pecks him on the cheek goodbye and again on the mouth but they were both quite legless and it wasn’t at all awkward that very first time, it was truly lovely on New Years...
The bass of the song playing pounds in Harry’s chest, but he doesn’t think the feeling is completely from the music, no, not when Malfoy’s warm hand is in his. He’s pulled into the middle of writhing bodies, the flashing lights, and
He suddenly spots Goldstein coming from the breakroom, as usual, but this time with Astoria Greengrass at his side. Draco doesn’t miss the brief locking of their pinkies before pausing under the sterilising vent, Astoria looks up and smiles sadly at Draco.
“I know, I know. Welcome to my world,” Draco says with a shrug. “It’s utterly ridiculous, but there’s no way around it.”
. Really?” she teases, refilling Draco’s glass and plonking it down in front of him. “Have at it. On the house, my sweet innocent child.”
Harry draws a deep, shaky breath. He gives a weary shake of his head. “I just need to know that you also believe that there’s something here worth exploring in depth,” he says. “That maybe one day we can just...
“Get out,” she sobs, her grasp tightening. “You evil, disgusting, gormless little worm! Get out of my

Draco, still dazed from learning Hermione’s dropped from the project, shakes himself and shoots Milton a smile. “I’ve heard horror stories about your labs, it was one of the reasons I refused a position at your Ministry. If you have Unspeakable Wallace himself here inviting you to our team, I know you’ll be a wonderful asset. It’s great to have you on board.”
Draco leans over the man. “I know you’re frightened right now, but I’m a Healer and I’m here to help you,” Draco says soothingly.
“...the legislation goes to the Wizengamot in less than a week and the protest we’re planning to flood the Ministry’s atrium the day before should generate enough support. Do you know how many kids of Wizengamot members have come round to the Anti-Defamation League for Magical Creatures and Beings? We have members and allies! We’ve got this in the
Harry hisses, anger and hate and regret and sorrow rushing through him like a wild torrent. His vision is blurred behind his glasses, and a part of him is sick that it's from tears. He wants to explode, he’s so humiliated that tears are running down his cheeks. He's fucking sick that Dean gets to see just how broken he is. It hurts even more when Dean frees one arm so he can wipe away the tears on his face. “
Draco swallows and slowly turns around to crawl onto the bed, leaning back against his pillows, his arms loose at his sides.
“It’s quite alright, Hannah, there’s no need to be shy. And if you’re uncomfortable, we don’t have to do this,” Hermione said with a reassuring smile. She carefully placed her camera on the empty seat beside her. After Molly and Arthur’s interview, she decided to upgrade to a more efficient Panasonic – this one had better high-definition digital recording. She’s sat across from Hannah and Neville at a small table in the corner of the Leaky Cauldron. The weekend evening crowd is boisterous, but a handy muffling charm did wonders in the private space they carved out.
“Can you imagine what that does to a man over four years? Harry getting bit by that werewolf was the best fucking thing to happen to me.
Draco deflates. All of the night’s tensions expel from his body like air from a balloon just from the reassuring sound of Harry’s laugh. He closes his eyes and sags forward, utterly spent as he falls against the other man.
they can have, but in their picture perfect family he will always be an observer. Always on the outside looking in at something that isn’t truly his.
Draco turns to Blaise, a soft, warm feeling exploding across his chest for his friend, and his own promises of a similar sentiment to a certain someone. “Absolutely not. You deserve everything you want.”
Crossing his arms against his chest, Draco scowls. “I’ll have you know that my arse is more that of a white peach, thank you very much.”
“Slow down. That’s my best scotch. It’s been matured in three different casks over the length of 42 years.” Draco makes a show of taking a sip, lips turning up at the irritated look on Pansy’s face.
Blaise snorts. “Could hardly drag the bastard out for a stroll when we were in Italy, remember? I swear, Draco, sometimes I think you’re a vampire. You only seem to enjoy cold, dark places.”
Scott Andrews. A brutish man and transport from MACUSA’s New York City branch, he always treats Draco with open hostility. Naturally, Draco hates the man’s guts.
Harry shrugs. “I’m a work in progress,” he admits, startled by his own honesty. “Why are you in the muggle world?”
Harry nods. “I told Harris I didn’t want you anywhere near it. I wanted to tell you the truth first.”
the one fucking in the middle of the afternoon, on a weekend, in the bloody sitting room?” he says, eyes still covered.
Pansy flinches. “Of course not, you’re right. I’m sorry.” She squeezes her eyes shut then, tears sliding down her pale cheeks as she blows out air. “I’m - it’s been a lot, darling. We thought you were going to die. So many of us saw Potter destroy the alley and beat Smith to an inch of his life. I don’t know how Potter did it, but there was some kind of ward preventing people from entering the alley. It only dropped when he Apparated you away. I figured he was bringing you here, so Mia, Blaise and I followed and—the chaos in the welcome lobby was, there was so much blood, I didn’t know—I’m sorry,” Pansy says, now staring down at him. Draco reaches out to clasp her hand. “Potter said Smith tried to kill you. He admitted to almost killing Smith, and that he snapped the spine of one of Smith’s hooligans, fractured the skull of another, and broke the legs of the one that tried to get away from him. I’ve never truly been afraid of Potter, but his anger...the way he retold the events of the evening, and commanded the Healers by threatening them if they hurt you or couldn’t save you was...it was insane and it scared the hell out of me. When the Healers started to work on you, that’s when the Aurors came to take him away.”
” Her words are awkward as she averts her own gaze to the ground. He feels a pang of sadness. It’s pathetic, really, that his best mates had to go about breaking their news to him like this. An invite to their flat on a Sunday morning with copious amounts of tea and a gentle rundown on why they were doing this to him… why they were leaving him to fend for himself for a whole month.
Draco slouches forward a bit as his eyes narrows. “Will you be stating the obvious all day or is it just for this particular conversation?” he asks archly. “I’d like to know so I can tailor my statements for the sake of time and efficacy.”
He chewed relentlessly on a hangnail as he took in the other boy. In the two and a half months that the trials dragged on, Malfoy’s white blond hair had become matted and dark with filth. His already sharp face was skeletal, cheekbones frighteningly sharp against nearly translucent skin. Around his left eye a bruise was blossoming and he was sporting a nasty split lip. He was wearing the traditional frayed Azkaban uniform which hung pitifully from his rail thin frame. Harry wondered what kinds of horrors Malfoy had endured in his short stint in prison. Despite Malfoy’s appearance, though, he was startled to find the defiant glint in Malfoy’s pale eyes as he looked out onto the Wizengamot, awaiting his verdict.
Draco hesitantly steps into the office, his palms suddenly sweaty. “What was that all about?” he asks as he shuts the door behind him.
In three strides, Harry reaches it. He grips the creature’s upper arms and hauls it up before slamming it against the wall so hard the back of the creature’s head bounces off of it.
Blaise had abandoned their beloved Marlboro brand for this silly new fad and was currently puffing away on the long, delicate black cigarette. It smells strongly of cloves and expels purple smoke—for affection. Although the sentiment isn’t clear on Blaise’s chiselled face, Weaslette stares at him with such unabashed longing that Draco believes, rather bitingly, that her discernable affection will be enough for the both of them.
,” Harry says, his voice full of despair. “What kind of Auror do you take me for? The facts have been staring me down for ages.”
He steps into this room that was once their classroom, their dining room, their escape as his fingers graze the soft silk material of the bed sheets. He smiles at the small Muggle picture Saeed has on his bedside table, a lovely black and white portrait of his friends from Durmstrang. Saeed enjoys Muggle photography and fashions, quite the photographer. Draco loves—loved
As they head out the front door, Theo again hands Draco his handkerchief to wipe away their handprints on the doorknob. Draco turns around once more—dog under his arm, nose slightly runny from the copious amount of drugs, and a deep-seated satisfaction unfurling in his chest. He uses the handkerchief to undo Sprinkles’ collar.
They keep the funeral small. Only a few close friends and family, except for Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy. Andromeda never reconciled with her sister and always said she never wanted to. Harry is dressed in a black robe over an equally dark suit. His tie is undone as he sits on the edge of his seat, hunched over with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped tightly between them. His gaze is determinedly fixed on the grass under his shoes. He inwardly winces every time he hears the strangled gulp for air coming from the right of him. Teddy may not fully grasp what’s happening around him, but he knows his grandmother is dead and never coming back. Harry finally turns to face the little boy, perched in Draco’s lap and gasping out sobs, his hair a drab brown as fat dollops of tears stream down his face. He opens his arms and Teddy immediately throws himself into his lap, his short little arms wrapping around him as he sobs wetly into the crook of his neck.
!” He tosses the book onto the shelf before pointing at it. “You’ll fight over this fucking book just because. I mean it. Put your name in it, on all your separate belongings, otherwise you’ll be getting an owl in the middle of the night a week after you break up asking whether or not you’re holding his paintbrushes hostage!” Harry screams.
Pansy grumbles as she rummages through the bag for the other sandwich. “You’ve always been incapable of leaving Potter alone. Now you both practically work together.”
This is the fifth time Potter has visited Draco’s office with images of potential suspects. Sometimes he shows Draco two to three images, other times he brings an entire album of mugshots. Today is one of those days where the album is thick and heavy. It flops onto Draco’s desk, knocking over his quill and ink pot and scattering some of his post-parchments onto the floor.
“I know, Harry. I’m just joking...” Ginny says, suddenly looking uncomfortable. Harry takes a deep breath, feeling ridiculous for being so rude. He places a hand on her shoulder.
“What?” she snaps, biting into her sandwich. “Her family only amassed their fortune within the last hundred years or so,” she says around the sandwich, not even bothering to chew and swallow first.
“Be honest. They’re a bloody Hufflepuff, am I right?” she asks quietly, as if the room has been reduced to just this bed, close together, facing each other in the quiet of late evening. Draco loves their little bubble, Mr Tomato in his splendid outfit caught between them.
Since puberty, Draco has only seen Lucius in his face, in the set of his shoulders, in the lankiness of his limbs. He never wanted to see anything beyond the very perfect image of the greatest man on earth. He remembers how before Hogwarts he would beg his parents to let him grow out his hair, like Father. But they would tell him long hair on a Pureblood male child was taboo and that Draco would have to wait until he reached majority. He’ll now never grow his hair out beyond his jaw, ever.
touch my drink, Blaise?” Draco complains as Blaise takes a sip from it, waiting for Harry to slide onto the bench.
The pain doesn’t subside in Draco’s head. Instead, the pressure increases, as if something is about to pop inside his head, synapses exploding. His head falls into his hands as he clenches at his hair, eyes squeezing shut as a pained moan escapes him.
Draco makes his decision after a quick, furious wank in the loo after his lunch with Blaise and Bitty. The whole time he was pulling off he kept calling himself
Harry fixes him with a steely gaze. “I’m part of a shadow government that’s taken root in the Ministry of Magic since the end of the second Wizarding War. We’re working against corrupt Ministry officials with blessings from the Minister for Magic.”
did the trick,” Potter says, flexing his hands, no wand in sight. Draco sits down beside him on the sofa and pulls Potter’s right hand under his nose to examine his palm. It’s as if the skin never broke.
“We’re doing this,” Harry says, his hands tightening. Draco covers Harry’s hands with his own, rocking slightly forward as Harry pulls him imperceptibly closer, his green eyes flashing. “You’re
He watches in amusement as Potter steps up to the fireplace, his shoulders squared and his eyes narrowed. He leans forward and whispers, the slithering sound that slips between his lips sending a sharp jolt up Draco’s spine. He draws in a slow breath, his heart fluttering as heat rushes to his face.
“I’m going to make this so good for you,” Dean whispers against his ear, licking the lobe. “I’m going to make you fucking
Draco’s eyes flutter shut and he can picture it. He can picture Harry leaning over him, slowly pumping away at him, kissing him.
...” Draco sweetly cries against Harry’s ear. And Merlin, Harry loves how vocal Draco is— how he moans and whimpers and fucks back into Harry’s thrusts, so desperate for all of his cock to fill him up.
and laughter that wants so desperately to bubble up his throat. Queensbury is still on the floor groaning, so Harry decides a quick disillusionment charm will do the trick in sneaking out.
“I was going to go home, I swear, but – and I know this is going to sound bloody insane – I just can’t stop thinking about you,” Dean whispers, his deep voice trembling. Harry’s eyes catch on Dean’s mouth as the man bites his lower lip, apparently trying and failing to suppress a moan. “I can’t stop thinking about your mouth and how your arse felt in my hands. I can’t stop imagining what you taste like, what it’ll feel like to fuck you, and the sounds you’ll make when you come.”
Draco reels back as he eyes Potter warily, unsure of what to say. He hasn’t seen Potter since the trials. Potter’s testimony may have saved Draco and his parents from Azkaban but that was the extent of their interactions. There was nothing Potter had to make right with Draco. And Draco doesn’t want anything that Potter feels some absurd obligation to provide.
Pansy uses the napkin draped across her lap to dab at her eyes. “What on earth do you mean if you’re not murdered first?”
help them achieve. We’ve also been skimming money from Games and Sports and the Davis Gala to outbid your mother on her building deal. Do you know how rich it’ll make my family and the Agnelli’s if this deal goes through? We can sell space off to Pureblood families faster than crepes for a Sunday brunch at
He had been ill when he was born compared to his twin Al’s vibrant health. Scorpius was smaller, frailer, quieter, sweeter, more pensive. Their little gentleman.
Draco ignores him. At his accusation, a blaze of fiery incredulity flashes in Granger’s bloodshot eyes before it’s snuffed out as the eerie, vacant look clouds over her gaze once more.
“I’m going to take you home, and I’m going to take such good care of you,” Harry sobs, and Draco wants to wipe the tears away, but he can’t muster the strength.
Harry nods. “I should have mentioned it to you when it happened, but it just took me off guard. I’m ashamed to admit that I took the coward’s way out by not talking to him or you about it in depth. I mean, we’ve dressed him in a frock more than a handful of times, it’s been harmless…not that I think that’s a viable answer to your question…I seriously never thought it was a big deal. He’s just a baby.”
Draco sits up straighter, the delayed, cold wave of shock rushing through him. He takes a deep breath.
Draco tilts his head to the side, his eyes carefully taking in Potter’s face. Potter’s lightning bolt scar is so violent and angry, Draco’s desperate to know what happened and how he didn’t end up with a missing eye. Not that it takes away from Potter’s attractiveness. If anything, it adds a certain edge to Potter that would make the thrill of flirting with him feel like some sort of seductive, dangerous dance. Draco’s pleased to notice that under Potter’s open Auror robe, he’s dressed better than last time, if simple, in black trousers, a white button down, and skinny black tie.
A tiny flicker of sharp, callous anger shoots through him at her barbed comment, but Draco just rolls his shoulders back, trying to maintain his composure.
It takes all of Draco's willpower not to melt into a warm puddle of affection thinking about Harry. Draco kissed the man for what felt like
people to drive me around. So what I’m trying to say here Potter is I didn’t go home first for the sake of saving time. I came straight here.”
He shook away thoughts of the anticlimactic night he lost his virginity and instead tried to focus on the many faces of the Wizengamot, protestors and finally, Hermione. She was perched beside him with a notebook and ballpoint pen in her lap. She had insisted on coming along with him ‘for support.’”
Draco doesn’t know what’s wrong with him. A stronger person would have left this shit show already. Actually, a smarter person would have turned down the invitation in the first place. Someone who had the gift of both intelligence and strength would have never bloody left Paris, period. Draco knows he’s a coward. He needs the company of his best mates in order to navigate this world that’s decided to evolve without him.
. There are people crowding the streets, music pouring from the doorways of open shops and cafes, laughter and singing from all corners. He’s out of breath when he gets to the entrance, throwing the door open and heading towards the lifts. He presses the top button, buzzing with anticipation as the lift finally calls out the 30th floor. Harry steps from out of the lift, two burly security guards—one bald and the other with spiky red hair—eye him cautiously.
There’s a rise in tension and voices as Hermione snaps back at Draco and Draco hisses at her. Harry raises both hands in a silent plea to
, I didn’t know you cared so much, Malfoy.” Harry shoots him a playful grin, which grows wider at Malfoy’s dark look.
“I’ll do it,” he says resolutely. “But there’s one more thing I want to do with this,” Draco says, turning back to the computer and condensing all his research and the video footage into a zip file.
Milton squints at Draco before briefly biting down on his lower lip. He seems to come to some sort of conclusion because he nods and smiles at Draco. “You’re right. We shouldn’t discuss his details in public. Gedeon mentioned that you voiced some concerns with the direction of the project. I personally had qualms at first, but when Gedeon showed me the results, well, Christ, I cried a bit,” Milton chuckles before slapping Draco on the shoulder once more. “I’m really happy you decided to stay on. Despite Gedeon gloating that you’d be in the lab this morning, he was feeling rather nervous that you’d prove him wrong.”
“I did,” Draco whispers, nostalgia that’s so painful, he wants to rip his heart out and slam it into the ground if it’ll stop the terrible ache burning inside of him.
, Draco falls a little bit more in love with the man in front of him. With all his rough edges, Harry’s been there to smooth and shape them over, even when he didn’t know where the rough edges were coming from. Draco’s thumb fondly spins the engagement ring on his finger.
Harry snorts. “You are a lot of things, Draco Malfoy. No one thing defines you. That’s what makes you amazing, intelligent,
Everyone looks up at Draco. Potter’s hands are shaking as he takes several steps away from Luna, who stops trembling almost immediately. Millicent is glaring at Draco. Padma’s lips are pursed.
Harry starts to panic. He hadn’t expected Hermione to be so emotional about all this. They had taken his coming out very well when they’d arrived home, just as Ginny said they would. They loved him and would support him no matter what. Hermione had taken his relationship with Dean as a sign that he was finally “embracing his true self”, “letting go of past traumas”, “attempting to move on from the war”, and such.
, Draco? Maybe if you did, you wouldn’t have to act like a twat to keep yourself from being happy, or push people away! You wouldn’t have to feel so bloody sorry for yourself!” Harry shouts at Draco’s back.
—sorry,” she says, pulling back and staring down at the patch covering his wound. “Where do you think you’re going?” she asks. Draco doesn’t answer, instead searching for his wand, finding it on his nightstand, and Summoning a plain button down shirt. He quickly pulls it on, using his wand to do the buttons.
Harry shakes his head. “No, it won’t,” he says. He feels guilty, having not told Ron and Hermione what transpired between him and Draco. But it was hard to talk about the shame he felt, and the pain and humiliation. He knows that he fucked up and made Draco feel like just another one of Harry’s pulls. “I slept with Draco.”
It’s then that Potter shoves Draco’s cloak into his chest, holding it there against him even as Draco’s hands fly up to clutch the fabric.
He can recall the last time he saw Malfoy, right after the trials, when Harry’s testimony wasn’t enough to save him completely from time in Azkaban, but anything after? He can’t. He does not recall exactly how much time Malfoy served—had it been three years or four? Did he receive early release or was that his father? How had Harry simply put Malfoy out of his mind after everything they had both been through? How had Zabini not warned him Malfoy would be in a psychiatric ward? Did he even know?
A sharp whimper escapes him, face paling. He drops his tea cup, spilling the contents across the plastic tray, table, and down the front of his robes. He doesn’t register any of the hot liquid on him as he shoots out of his seat, entire body feeling as if he’s been dunked in freezing water. He turns petrified eyes to Hermione’s carefully blank face and Weasley’s puzzled one.
Draco hums and nods, his eyes finally closing. A few moments later, he can hear the bathroom door click shut.
Draco laughs. “Do you remember when I came out to you that first year in Montmartre? I had been struggling with it for
Harry nods, withdrawing his hands from Draco’s warm but still stiff body. “Right you are,” he says, quickly picking his cup of tea up for a few rapid sips. Draco hasn’t addressed Teddy directly yet. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Padma hesitates only a second before she reaches out, like earlier, to brush back Draco’s fringe from his forehead.
“It’s been a couple of weeks since we’ve had all our friends together at one of our flats. Neville was just asking me when he can come by for drinks. The poor sod misses you,” Potter chuckles. “I was thinking Wednesday evening?”
“Millie has the Cloak,” Pansy confesses, her hands clenched into balls on either side of her elegant, pale green maxi dress. Millie huffs in the background. “She’s supposed to give it to me next, but I’ll give it to you, Draco. I don’t need it anymore.”
“This means so much to me,” Harry whispers, fondly caressing the thick frame. “This is so,” Harry starts, breath hitching painfully, “this is
Parkinson arrives back into the massive lounge room cradling the open bottle of prosecco and drapes herself across the chesterfield. “Merlin’s beard, Draco, it’s 4am, do we really need to start with the muggle music?”
“You know it starts off like this, don’t you?” he begins as his laughter dies down. They all stand quietly before him. “We started out like this, Dean and I. Grimmauld Place was nothing but blank walls when you first left Gin, and then Dean came along, and we hung his paintings, pictures of us from holidays, and of his family. We looked at swatches,
Draco straightens up, his hand tightening around his wand. He opens his mouth to say something cutting when he’s interrupted.
“Wait, Harry.” Molly smooths out the fabric over his shoulders, her hands hovering slightly, as if unsure what else to do as she bites her lower lip. Her eyes are bright as she stares up at him. “Please try to understand what he’s going through, Harry. Losing a child is...it’s a kind of pain I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy,” she urges. Harry bristles.
Draco makes an amused sound. “My own personal house elf, making sure I eat every day. Going to personally escort me down to dinner, too? Mm? Pour my portions, and refill my wine glasses, too?” he asks, shooting him a wry smile.
Pansy scoffs. “Probably reapplying her makeup charms after the dressing down I gave her. Vapid bitch.”
Draco presses his lips against the side of Harry’s face, thrusting down once more to chase after the remnants of his orgasm. His fingers curl into Harry’s hair as he brokenly whispers, “We promised. We promised.
“I’m going to listen in on Castor’s interviews, I won’t be far,” Potter says, nodding before following after Castor. Draco watches him go, wondering exactly how much distance they can put between one another in an open space. They haven’t exactly tested it beyond Parkinson House. Potter seems to be able to go wherever Draco goes, but hasn’t been able to travel anywhere else without Draco’s presence; they were somehow tethered to one another, in a sense.
He covers his mouth, trying to quiet his suddenly heavy, panicked breathing. He removes his hand to instead run it through his hair, and takes several deep, even breaths.
“Actually. You haven’t been the same since Saeed left,” Millie muses, her expression questioning. “You know you can talk to us, right, Draco?”
Draco considers Tracey a friend, even though she wasn’t in his immediate circle of cronies at Hogwarts. She was always on the outskirts, and he’s ashamed to admit that it’s because, though a Slytherin, she was quite vocal about her anti-Voldemort sentiment in school. He had even seen her talking to Granger a few times in their shared classes. In order to save face in front of his friends, and later, Voldemort, Draco had to keep some distance from her. Despite his attempts to keep her at arm’s length, he had a brief, passionate fling with her back in fifth year. At one point he truly believed himself to be in love with her. But like every woman Draco has fooled around with, they eventually ended up leaving him to date Blaise.
“I guess it’s nice to know that not all Slytherins have to suffer because of the war,” Draco says unhappily, watching Blaise kiss Weaslette softly on the cheek. Mia follows his gaze and clucks.
, thank Merlin you’re still here,” Draco says, relief flooding his face, his shoulders sagging. He quickly glances down at his wristwatch with a small frown. “Teddy’s going to be as late as you are if I don’t get him dressed in the next five minutes,” he says loud and clear over the wails. This just makes Teddy cry harder, his bare feet slapping harder against the cushioned surface of his floor.
“You must be out of your bloody mind if you think I’ll help either of you!” Draco roars, once again scrambling to his feet, but this time Jenkins shoots a strong Stinging Hex at Draco, causing him to fly onto his back. Draco groans.
“For someone who doesn’t talk much, I’m going to count that as one of the compliments you believe you’re capable of making,” Draco says cheekily.
...” Draco’s voice catches. He blinks rapidly, his hands trembling. It feels good, and strange, and wholly empowering, having Harry like this.
And furthermore, it bothers Draco that Potter has been able to see so accurately through his shield, the only layer of protection he has between himself and the rest of the world. Potter believing he has any right to judge Draco, let alone comment on the choices Draco has made concerning his own well-being and who is privy to it, has left a bitter taste in his mouth. He glances once more at Potter only to find that their eyes meet. Draco hastily drops his gaze, but Potter has now stopped walking, the cold wave of his presence leaving Draco’s side.
Coming from his morning meeting with the Chief Prosecutor and staff, he approaches Barbara’s station, shooting her a small smile as she gets to her feet.
“You sound like Ron,” she drawls. “Speaking of Ron, he’s coming by the Ministry. Why don’t I take you both for lunch in the canteen and tell you all about it?”
“I’m not really surprised,” Ron shrugs, ignoring Harry’s comment. “Mione told me ages ago that you two’ve been running into each other.”
. Harry remembers the painful look on Lucius Malfoy’s face the day he was read his verdict and taken to Azkaban, pulled away from him wife and child. He doesn’t feel bad for the elder Malfoy, but, he is sympathetic about Malfoy’s nostalgia and wistfulness.
“Oh, yes, yes,” Kreacher replies eagerly, dipping one long, thin arm into the chest in contemplation, his leathery face suddenly lighting up. “Kreacher is finding it, Master Black!”
“Because you think I can be nice?” Draco asks, a weak smile tugging at his lips as he recalls a less complicated time, a night of firsts. Their first night out for drinks. Their first kiss. The first time Draco saw Harry as someone he wants to have in his life.
. “No, and thank you,” he says hoarsely. He glances down at the box in his hands, a box containing for the next 28 days a reminder of last night. He hadn’t mentioned to her he was not only a Potions Master, but a contractor for the DMLE
Smith’s cheeks are flushed red, eyes slightly unfocused that speaks to his drunkenness. His gold-blond hair is in disarray, Auror robes unbuttoned, revealing black Ministry-grade tunic and trousers. Smith allows the door to slam shut behind him.
too, and you both have been nothing but supportive. How could we ever think differently of you? We can’t survive without you, you daft cow.”
He casts a Diagnostic Charm and grimaces. The man’s blood pressure is dangerously high, he’s tachycardic, and his temperature is abnormal. Draco rests a hand against the man’s hot skin and leans in to peer into the man’s face. His eyes are dilated. The liquid the man is regurgitating isn’t the Mother of Pearl sheen associated with the potion, but whatever is leaving the man’s body was caused by an overdose of some kind of concoction with Amortentia properties.
The light from the fire reflects in Draco’s glassy-eyed gaze, red-orange and white hot licking across grey.
“What about the kitchen floor?” he quips softly, hoping to pull Malfoy at least a little bit out of his melancholy.
Dean stumbles back into a table of gadgets, his breath knocked from him. But he quickly regains his footing, reaching out to painfully grip Harry’s shoulders.
Potter, though unknowingly, has carried Draco through this pain since the beginning, and maybe telling him the truth now will free him from some of his anxiety. The more he toys with the idea, the more questions run through his mind – What if Potter spurns him? Accuses him of having wanted it or finds him disgusting? Breaks up with him? Draco tries to tame his thoughts before they run rampant. No.
it’ll feel,” she says with a mischievous smirk. “And you know Seamus will crow about it until he’s blue in the face at the next pub gathering. It’ll be our little secret.” Harry sits back in his seat, his gaze on Hermione sharp and searching.
Spinnet, Harry!” Ginny wails hysterically. “Parvati is a bloody Quidditch-loving groupie slag, that’s what she is!” Ginny finally untwines herself from him, wiping her snot with the back of her hand as she laughs hollowly.
“Harry, you need to find a way of not expressing every feeling you have every single moment you have them,” Draco says quietly, taking a seat on the top step.
Draco nods firmly, not yet trusting the strength of his voice. Harry sidles up beside him on the couch and begins to run his finger through Draco’s hair. He closes his eyes briefly, the ministrations calming and it's not long before he’s able to breathe more slowly.
Potter leans back in his seat. “We’ll be here all night if I let you have your way. You’ve always been a nosy bugger.”
. It’s going to pass. I collected the signatures from the petition last night actually, and we met the hundred thousand goal! The Wizengamot can’t refuse to hear the legislation since it’s brought forward by the needed majority!” Draco says triumphantly.
It was all quite emotionally taxing, and you know how blotchy my skin gets when I cry.” Draco shudders.
A shudder passes through him and he steps back from the clock, needing to get away from it. He decides to investigate Potter’s desk, flopping down onto his seat. He pulls open drawers, moves the contents inside of them around, touches the underside of the desk for trap doors or hidden compartments. They’ve wasted too much time dallying.
Despite the million questions that crop up in Draco’s head about that revelation, he keeps them to himself. “Fine. What’s the hiss for open?”
“I didn’t mean to frighten you,” Potter says, his voice like an echo in an empty corridor. The hairs on Draco’s arms and the back of his neck stand erect at the sound of it, and he finds he can’t stand it.
“I stole that dossier from Edward Flint’s house during one of my break-ins. I have photographic proof of the actual theft!” Draco says smugly, thinking about the images Andrews had hung in Draco’s home office the night he broke into his townhouse.
Before Draco can come up with something to say, a boom of thunder causes him to jump in his seat. Potter is as still as a stone. Then, a downpour of rain clatters on the shield protecting the garden.
Potter tilts his head up the ceiling for a moment, his Adam’s apple bobbing before he glares down at Draco. “Hermione told me about your project.”
“Look Kreacher,” Draco interrupts, an idea, a lie, striking him. “I promise you that your days not spent under tyrannical rule are numbered. I promise I’ll take you away from here if you can just—”
“Now’s not the time, Potter,” Draco snaps. At that moment, Granger closes the space between them, her hands curling around the collar of Draco’s lab coat. Despite her very pregnant stature she’s able to jerk him forward with a surprising strength. But that’s not what causes the plummeting sensation in Draco’s belly. It’s the devastation written across her face―the brimming tears, the trembling gash of lips, the rigid posture―that does Draco in. His hands come up to gently cover Granger’s as she forcibly shakes him.
He takes a deep, shuddering breath, and scans the crowd. Now that he’s no longer cloaked in the darkness of the pub, he feels vulnerable in this well-lit space. No one seems particularly interested in what he’s doing, too busy laughing and drinking. He nods to himself and slips through the crowd, eyes downcast, until he makes his way to the edge of the garden with the intimate corner of lush armchairs. To his surprise, there’s a small corner available with three free armchairs, the small table littered with empty glasses and bottles. He quickly makes his way there, taking the middle seat. He pulls out his wand, careful not to move too quickly and give cause to some arsehole to attack Draco. He first Vanishes the clutter on the table with an annoyed tutt before he casts a Disillusionment Charm on himself and the little corner, followed by a modified Repellent Charm he learned from one of the texts in the Malfoy Library when he was young. It had come in handy during the war with Fenrir and other Death Eaters eager to put Draco in his place roaming the halls of the Manor. He didn’t like to use it, wanting to get used to his environment instead of hiding from it. He’ll have to lift it momentarily when he sees Harry approaching.
Harry hands him his wand. “You take this. Stay to my left. Stun the ones with the weapons first. I’ll take the one holding the captain via hand to hand. Once we have them bound with rope, we’ll silence them and make our way through the ship.”
He throws up an Umbrella charm and makes his way to the narrow alley beside the Apothecary, pulling free his crumbled emergency pack of Marlboro Lights. He hates and loves that he’s started smoking again, the thick, flavoured smoke calming, but the winded feeling in his chest now more than missing Harry.
Draco knows Harry can see the many shades of him. It’s the only plausible explanation for their lack of an in-between throughout their years of knowing each other. Life or death. Friend or Foe. Fast or slow. Hatred or love. It was always going to be one or the other with them, and Draco knows that Harry feels the same. They chose correctly, each time.
“I told you that a second chance was wasted on me. Are you sure you want to go to bat for me on a third one?”
He’s been branded by them in more than one way now, and still he needs to participate in such frivolities as his mother is forever unamendable to his desire for a quiet afternoon at home. Alone.
The shame Harry had felt, the guilt, the excruciating loss and helplessness…he had turned it into anger.
Auror Castor raises a brow but takes a small step back from Draco. “We’ve got a 10-29 out there with a possible 10-54,” he says, gesturing towards the Floo before making his way towards it.
Pansy frowns. “Actually, now that I’ve come to think of it, darling, I haven’t. Is it really that much different?”
Potter fixes him with a piercing stare, and Draco would have flinched if he weren’t using every bit of his energy to remain outwardly blank. “You know exactly what I mean. Don’t ever give in like that again. I
a voice in the back of his head reminds. It suspiciously sounds like Blaise. Draco would never admit to anyone that Blaise is his voice of reason, especially to Blaise...he’d never let Draco live it down.
Panic suffuses Draco, and he stares off into the distance as his thoughts race, Potter patiently holding his hand as the silence stretches between them. The whole reason he had left Potter behind at the pub last month was because he knew he didn’t want to be seen with Draco. How could they possibly develop a relationship? Draco suddenly imagines Harry shoving him and telling him it was all a lie, that he never wanted to date him, how could he, when the whole world hates Draco? Draco bites his lower lip.
“I can’t absolve you of whatever regret or pain you may be feeling right now. I also can’t find it in myself to say I forgive whatever choices you may have made that contributed to my death, regardless of your memories being stolen from you. I can’t right now, and I hope you understand the reasons why without me having to explain them. But I do need your help, Draco. My body is out there, I still feel a connection to it, and I know-I know something else is missing from me, something that feels like a part of me is just...gone. I want both my body and that part of myself restored.”
A surreal feeling overcomes him as Potter’s arms wrap around Draco’s waist, pulling him in as their lips gently touch. Draco’s eyes flutter shut, and he finds that Potter’s kiss is like oxygen. He breathes it in.
In his frustration, he slams a fist onto the surface of his countertop, ignoring Pansy’s sharp gasp, the force so hard the porcelain cups and silver teaspoons clink against each other.
Robards clucks his tongue at them before continuing his tread towards the Auror Department. “Right away!” Potter calls out, tucking his head in the crook Draco’s neck to hide his abashed grin. Draco sniggers. “I reckon that’s not anything good,” he says as he lifts his head to quickly peck him on the cheek. “Are you ready for tomorrow?” Draco nods, his good mood spoiling with thoughts of his obligations. After much pestering from Potter, he had finally agreed to a gathering of their friends and had offered to host their catch up at his flat instead of at a Muggle pub, not ready to venture out yet. Potter had seconded the suggestion immediately. “I’ll bring the whisky.”
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Draco asks dismissively, walking past her towards his workstation. He catches the eye roll from Goldstein and scowls.
Draco stumbles slightly over his feet as Pansy tugs him down the short staircase and around the dance floor of writhing bodies. She doesn’t stop propelling him forward until they’re at the bar where four bartenders are moving with a speed that doesn’t seem human.
A darkness falls over Draco like an opulent veil as he gives into the sweet draw of unconsciousness.
Potter runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t know what the fuck happened. I-I forgot myself there.”
“And don’t you ever forget it,” Pansy giggles, leaning forward to place a kiss in his hair. “Now get the fuck off my new dresses.”
But the jacket lands on the floor. Sluggish from his nausea, his headache, and the overwhelming sense of dread in his body, Draco pulls out his wand to turn the lights on in his dark townhouse.
“Same, kid! That’s a wicked name you got there. Well, look at you, Haz! I’m happy for you. Are you, uh, looking for the regular?” Martin turns to grab two large bottles of Jack Daniels. Draco’s eyebrow lifts as Harry flushes, shaking his head.
“I smell the lavenders that overgrow in my garden during the Spring, the Peach Cobbler my grandmother used to make during the holidays, and my late husband’s aftershave.”
Neither of them fall asleep right away, he can tell. Draco doesn’t fall into sleep for at least another half-hour, his breathing shifting to relaxed. Harry looks at the digital clock on Draco’s nightstand, it’s only 4:30am. Harry can wait.
in Diagon Alley during his mother’s orphan's benefit. He had wanted to jump and end things then, and if he could, he’d definitely do it right now.
A hand wraps around Draco’s—Blaise’s—as he glances between Pansy and Draco and asks softly, “I don’t understand, why didn’t you tell us?”
this become dangerous? It’s been a week and now back at work Draco feels like all eyes are on him. He feels like he’s being followed. He knows it’s impossible, no one knows he has those documents, locked under heavy wards in hole in the wall much like Edward Flint’s in Draco’s townhouse. Or what if he was wrong about potential curses or spells being on the cubbyhole? What if Edward knows Draco stole his dossier of horrors? Needless to say, that nervous excitement he had felt when he pocketed the incriminating documents is now long gone.
Marcus and Edward Flint had each been sentenced to Life in Azkaban for murder, domestic terrorism, embezzlement, and treason. Andrews had been killed during the fight in Courtroom Ten. The Agnelli’s had fled back to Italy to avoid being charged for attempted murder and embezzelment. Bitty’s prompt, unexpected departure had left Blaise heartbroken, and he'd tried to turn to Pansy in his moment of distress. Pansy, being a good friend, had consoled him but refused to take him back when he'd asked. Now, a year later, Blaise is dating Tracey, who'd recovered from her injuries, had gone back to complete her Auror training and had joined the Corps. Pansy is now engaged to one of her clients, the
Draco starts, shocked. “What were her reasons? Why was I not provided her letter of resignation as well?”
Pansy is giggling, flicking her short locks from her face in a flirtatious manner when Draco finally tunes back in. He chuckles along with her, not knowing what they’re talking about, and inhales hard when Harry turns to smile tightly at him.
, do please share. Again, many thanks to the mods for this fest. And thank you to my beta for their immense wisdom and insight.
He’s spending more time with his friends – not the usual Friday night Slytherin do, but they meet at coffeehouses during the day when he’s free or will come by Grimmauld Place for dinner. On those nights Potter disappears to visit Weasley and Hermione. Sometimes if the couple can get Molly to babysit Rose, they’ll pop over with takeaway and a game board in hand to spend the evening with him. He had celebrated his twenty-third birthday in the lavish gardens of Grimmauld Place, his friends, the Weasley family, and even his parents joining him to celebrate. It had been an awkward, nevertheless intriguing affair watching Potter stiffly interact with Lucius. His mother had been graceful, showering him with gifts from Paris, hugs, and kisses. He’d even found time to pull Pansy aside, who’s now officially dating Blaise, and apologise to her profusely about his behaviour over the last several months, to which Pansy accepted in tears.
Potter hisses in anger. He squares his shoulders as he moves closer to peer into Draco’s bruised face. At Draco’s continued silence, Potter tears his eyes away from his face to glare at Pansy who’s sitting up to fluff Draco’s 100 percent Hungarian goose down pillows before reclining against them. “You said you didn’t know where he was!” Potter snarls.
Draco draws in a breath, exhales it slowly. “You must believe me,” he says, his voice thin and brittle as he tries to stave off a sob. “I loved you very, very much. My decision to leave had everything to do with the immensity of my love for you, and my desire to see you happy and healthy. I couldn’t give that to you. I couldn’t ensure your happiness, not when I was so unhappy and our surroundings so unforgiving,” Draco says, hanging his head. “But, you know this. We’re not here to dwell on the past, are we? Our correspondences did that enough. Come to think of it, you never did tell me how you obtained my work address.”
His memories are a mess. White spots scatter over his recollection of the last twenty-four hours. He tries to sort through his memories further back and he can tell something is amiss, but he doesn’t know
Harry had dated several people two years after Draco left, and then settled in with Ginevra Weasley for three years. His love for Harry never waned, even as the years slid by. He wanted Harry to be happy. Loved.
“How can you be certain about that, Draco? What makes you think that Potter isn’t pretending to like you because he thinks you’re involved in the burglaries? I mean, if they’re trying to pin this on Theo, you can’t be far off on their list of possible suspects, too. Your family had Dark objects confiscated, too.”
Potter continues to stare at him, that pitying look still on his face. After a few seconds, Potter starts down the hallway. “Follow me, I need to show you something,” he calls over his shoulder.
He’d spent his night with Harry carefully crafting his recusal letter to the Chief Prosecutor, knowing fully that the man is in bed with Flint. Draco had then spent the rest of the day explaining to Harry how he'd conducted each robbery, how he'd planned on influencing the case, how he’d become somewhat dependent on Muggle drugs, and his fucked up encounter with Blaise and Bitty. Harry had sat through it, listening carefully, not judging him. He'd made Draco dinner, held him, kissed him, and made love to him instead.
Draco’s laugh is abrupt, and he stifles it, feeling fond. He flexes his hand again and Harry finally takes it. Draco turns it over, runs his thumb over the nearest bruised, battered knuckle. He brings Harry’s hand to his lips and kisses it. “I could never be afraid of you. I’m just sorry I was ready to believe the worst...believe that you could— with someone like
“You don’t have to be such an arsehole,” Draco says, smoothing back loose tendrils of hair from his face.
Draco closes his eyes. He knows that’s Potter speaking through Jeremy. He’s weak and scared and he doesn’t know if he’ll splinch or not, but he focuses on Pansy’s sitting room, of the rug in front of the fireplace. And then he’s being squeezed, and falling.
“Harry, I’m sorry. I know it’s New Year’s Eve and I know that you’re feeling lonely, but you just can’t show up here and tell me you love me and expect that to make all that you’ve done go away. I mean, really Harry, what am I supposed to say? ‘Oh wow, that’s awesome, let’s ride off into the sunset together?’ It doesn’t fucking work that way!”
He’s sleep-rumpled. Dark bags under his eyes and such a profound etching of mental and physical exhaustion on his face, so startling out of place on his young visage. He had come back from Hogwarts to be with them. He should have been playing Quidditch, going on dates, preparing for his OWLs.
“To annoy,” Potter finishes with a mean little smile. He flops himself down in the chair before Draco’s desk, knees spread and arms coming up to fold against his broad chest, the metal buckles of his wand and knife holder glinting in the light. “Not a bad office. I thought for sure they’d stick you in a closet. I would’ve.”
Harry’s sprawled on his back, his head propped up on the arm of his sofa with a bag of Bassetts wine gums set on his stomach as he flips through the telly. He pauses on TV presenter Natasha Kaplinsky as she interviews the band The Feeling in preparation for their
“It was nice to meet you,” Draco says, his eyes flickering with amusement. “I look forward to seeing your work.”
Luna doubles over as Millicent wraps an arm around her shoulder. “It’s like...it’s like I can feel his presence,” she cries.
“It really doesn’t,” Neville snorts from his position on the floor pressed against the front of Hannah’s legs. She runs a hand through his hair from her spot in an armchair.
“Hermione gave me all the information I needed. This isn’t about you. It’s not about Hermione. The simple fact is I’m intrigued and I want to be invested. The only condition is that we try to keep my involvement a secret from your department head. If Hermione doesn’t trust him, I don’t trust him.
“I told you before not to use silly terms of endearment with me, Potter. And it’s nothing to worry your tiny brain over. He punched me and the Healers kept me overnight to monitor my concussion,” he drawls, and it’s smooth. He’s surprised at how smooth the lie comes out, even with his Occlumency shutters high in defence. He’s so grateful for Pansy’s quick ability to lie, like the perfect snake she is. All thoughts of wanting her to go home last night fly out the window; he could kiss her right now.
“Don’t look at that,” Harry whispers before leaning down to kiss Draco again. Draco loses all his questions in it, moaning as his now bare cock twitches against Harry’s as he rolls his hips in Draco’s lap.
Harry throws his arms around him. Draco takes a half step backwards, stiffening and then tries to jerk away from the contact, but when he doesn’t release him it’s not before long Draco’s relaxing into the embrace, an exhale of breath tickling the side of Harry’s neck as his arms come up to hug him back. “I’m so sorry,” he says tenderly into Draco’s shoulder. “I’m so, so sorry. I didn’t mean any of it, Draco, really. The last thing I’d ever want to do is hurt you. You’re so brave, so strong to keep yourself together despite all the impossible shit you have to put up with, myself included. Can you forgive me?”
“I need your help. Please find Harry Potter. I-I don’t know how you’ll do it, but please make sure he’s safe? I have no verbal message in case he’s not alone, but come back to me to let me know everything is okay,” Draco whispers. Lyra gets up then, circles him, and then runs off at a breakneck speed. He gasps before laughing. He had forgotten how fast she can go.
“You don’t have to know why, love. I just am,” Pansy says, toeing off her heels and positioning herself against the sofa arm. She kicks her feet up on Draco’s lap, and he immediately reaches down to massage her stockinged feet. Pansy groans and takes another hit off the spliff. Then she says in a hushed tone, “he deserves better.”
“Obviously not,” Draco responds, withdrawing his hand to pick up his drink. He tries to calm his thunderous, fast heartbeat as both Potter and Smith fix their eyes on him.
“Harry,” Draco starts, facing him. “You brought light into my life when I was ready to succumb to darkness. You made me feel alive again, and I-I don’t know how I’m going to be able to move past this...” Draco said, shaking his head. “I don’t know how I’m going to carry this pain with me for the rest of my life, knowing that I had you, and I lost you, and it was my fault. The weight of my choices came with greater casualties, and I’m so-I’m so
“Fucking hell, Blaise, how stupid are you? You get a taste of ginger twat, and suddenly you can’t think properly?”
His heart is starting to race, but he can’t get over how sprightly he feels. That hole that’s been in his chest is so full of joy right now.
Harry grimaces, looking down at the three shots of clear liquid and his newly replenished gin and tonic. With a shrug, he picks up the first shot of tequila. Parkinson grins up at him and Harry shudders at how terrifying her grin looks, sharp like a knife. “On my mark, you wankers,” she all but purrs. “Get Set…
“It’s this new skincare routine I’m trying. It’s called ‘barely living,’” he deadpans, a weak laugh escaping him despite Saeed’s stricken expression.
“Are you sure, Shafiq?” Madame Odgen shouts from the back of the benches. “Your family should be under investigation!”
“It’s fine,” Harry laughs, picking the feathered boa up to wrap around his neck once more. “I know you don’t mean any harm but er, just believe me on this – my bisexuality isn’t some kind of layover to homosexuality
“I know. I want to apologise for what I said at my birthday gathering. I was in a shit place and really,” he swallows. In for a knut and all that rot… “I was lashing out at you for selfish reasons. I didn’t want to fully forgive you for leaving me. And-” He’s interrupted by the waiter arriving with menus, which is all well for him because as much as he wants Ginny to know how big of a cock he is and how terrible he is for it, he’s absolutely shite at finding the right words to ask for her forgiveness. Harry orders them a bottle Chianti and the waiter hurries off. He decides to go with the simple honest truth.
Potter’s hand slides away, his arms loose at his side, suddenly seeming uncertain, as though he no longer knows how to interact with Draco.
, Happy Christmas Eve,” Draco says cheerfully, pulling her in for a kiss on the cheek. “Is that eggnog in your glass?” he teases, tapping her wrist. Pansy scoffs as she turns up her nose.
There’s three heavy knocks on the door. Draco closes his eyes, willing the person on the other side to find another fucking loo
Finally, Potter’s gaze lands on the drinks before them. He points to the small pile sat on the table. “Which one of these can I have?”
What it can do for some people. What it can expose and plan and build in its construct and grand unpredictability.
over a hundred times, just like me. I love that you make me question my own sanity because you’re such a nutter. I love that you’ve invented an invisibility cloak of strength so your patients can feel strong and that you carry lollipops for them on you. I love that you're so free and in-tune with yourself that you’re not afraid to laugh at yourself. I love that you smoke pot and dance like you’re the only person in the room despite coming off as this stiff posh prick, because you’re actually
“Draco, don’t - don’t listen to his rubbish, okay? It’s not - it’s not what you think—” Harry starts.
Draco purses his lips, a rush of annoyance making his mind race unpleasantly. He’s always been aware of Bitty’s possessiveness, her insolence, and now her voyeuristic, candualistic behaviour. Even though she claims to love Blaise, she’s drawn to Draco, still flirts with him excessively, and speaks to him like they’re still intimately linked. And nowadays Blaise seems to be on the same page as Bitty with the bizarre flirting. Draco’s had enough with being played with.
“I was desperate for a new start. When I was at the Manor after my trial, I kept dreaming of waking up in a world where no one knew me. Where no one knew what horrors I had done,” Malfoy says, his voice catching. “I just wanted to be free. After the incident in Diagon Alley, I made up my mind. It was time to leave my old life, but I couldn’t just move to another magical community, because surely after a time people there would find out who I am...what kind of monster I am. It took me a while to realise that I could only achieve what I wanted by entering a world I knew nothing about, but strangely, that didn’t scare me. I wanted it.  So, I decided to move to muggle London. I wanted everything I was taught growing up to be proven wrong,” he said feverently, his hands now clenched into fists.
Draco continues to remain silent, thoughts racing as they try to connect how Milton, someone who just arrived today, would know who this man is, and why Draco would know anything about his details. Draco busies himself instead with partially removing the Body-Bind to see if the convulsions have eased. There’s only a slight tremor left in Mr Graham’s limbs.
To Draco’s surprise, it’s Weaslette who swoops in to calm the masses. “Now, c’mon mates, enough of all that. You all know why Malfoy is here. I really want you to play nice.”
polite Wizarding Society when it comes to my Mother? I’m talking Pureblood, old money, with a hint of dark magic.”
“You’re pale as a ghost and you look like you’re about to faint. It’s this Muggle shite Longbottom’s got us smoking,” Theo says, shrugging his shoulders. “Or maybe you’re finally sickened by Potter?” he adds hopefully. “You deserve love, Draco, and I just can’t see Potter giving that to you.”
“Prepare yourselves!” Pansy says before dumping the pile of confiscated rubbish that have been erroneously tapped for portkeys, nearly knocking over Draco’s chips and cakes.
“Have you been to the Leaky at all since we’ve been back?” Draco asks through gritted teeth, trying to hold in as much smoke as possible before exhaling. When he does, he coughs roughly.
“No one would dare call you anything but charming after last week,” Mia says, her lips painted dark blue today. “She used the strongest knee-reversal hex I’ve ever seen on some twat at the bar who called her bitter because she wouldn’t give him her Floo address.”
“I thought you were smart? I already have, Draco! You saw the files. You saw the photos. We have the Ministry wrapped around our little finger. We have our own team of Aurors at our beck and call! Even Shacklebolt is afraid of us. Do you know how much dirt we have on the Minister for Magic? Merlin. Not only does the man have an extramarital affair, he does so with a
“I’m not keen on playing Slytherin games,” Ginny snaps, knocking Pansy’s hand away from her face. “And quite frankly, Parkinson. I don’t see anything worth playing for.” Ginny, despite being a good five inches shorter than Pansy right now, looks the other woman from head to toe with such thinly concealed disgust that even Harry feels personally attacked. She roughly shoulders Pansy backwards, escaping the tight corner she’s pressed into. But Pansy is fast, and only stumbles slightly before wrapping a hand around Ginny’s elbow to keep her in place.
“Rest now, my darling, shhh…” Draco whispers, pressing a kiss to Harry’s forehead as he weeps against Draco’s stomach. “You’ll feel better in a few hours, I promise. Rest.”
“Why, yes,” Bart says, beaming. “The most prestigious residency programs are currently scouting him for his clinical rotations for his final two years. He’s fast-tracked the programme, my little genius…” At Malfoy’s scowl, Bart pulls back slightly, obviously aware of Malfoy’s discomfort over his overwhelming display of pride and affection. “And what is it that you do, Mr Potter?”
Draco hasn’t slept with anyone since Bitty, and he hasn’t slept with someone he cares for, truly cares for, in almost a year. But none of that matters. His lack of sex pales when confronting the reality that they’re about to take their relationship out onto unknown waters. He’s self-aware enough to know that he’s not physically or mentally ready to combat this kind of change, and that makes him dizzy with panic.With every ounce of willpower, Draco’s hands scramble from Harry’s hair to his shoulders to hold him in place.
Farida Khan Shafiq is, simply put, a formidable woman. She’s tall, thin, and always speaks in soft, urgent tones. With her long inky black hair down her back, dark eyes framed by thick, dark lashes and ageless façade, Draco would call her beautiful if she didn’t look as if she was smelling something foul every time she glanced at him.
“Here we are, Harry,” Mr Winthrop says with a smile. “I can’t do much about changing the smell, as we’ve gone over before, but we were able to add a bit of Valerian root to this batch, so do let me know how it turns out.”
do this. Things will go back to normal soon enough. Potter will forget all about his prickly behaviour in a couple of days. But for now, he presses his face into his knees to muffle his sobs and lets go once more –lets the tears roll down his cheeks. His hair falls around his face like a wet curtain and he’s cocooned as he embraces the wave of misery that overcomes him. His tears are salty on his wet lips. The loss and anger is unbearable, like the painful bottomless curl of a dark curse.
Draco draws in a harsh breath, suddenly feeling ill. Memory Charms alone can cause a multitude of damage to a foetus. A Dark curse, stronger than
She laughs. “You’re just a big cock attached to a little man, Blaise, do you know that? You like to pretend you’re so put together, so perfect, but no one knows just how often I have to suffer your insecurities. I don’t know what we’re doing anymore.”
Sometimes Draco wonders why he landed such shit friends. Other times he wonders how he would have ever been able to make it through his adolescence without them. They can be such amazing people, especially when they’re this attentive.
Draco chuckles, his heart soaring at the love he feels for his best friend. He lifts his arms to wrap loosely around Pansy’s waist, pulling her in closer. He presses his face into her stomach.
When he looks in the mirror, Draco realises that he hasn’t had a haircut in a while, what with the looming doom over him, so he slicks his slightly overlong locks back into a pompadour, just a few strands hanging across his forehead. He then heads down to the parlour to acquire a drink before heading down to the ballroom.
“What is it, Gin?” At his question her face flushes and he raises a quizzical brow. Merlin. She’s bloody
for that matter? ” Blaise sneers, shaking his head as he let’s her go with a shove. “You Agnelli’s and your disgusting narcissism. You literally will follow anyone that’ll promise you your 15-minutes.”

Harry carefully sets the frame down before turning to Draco. He looks like he’s vibrating with anticipation as Harry reaches out for him, wrapping his arms around Draco as Draco wraps his own arms around Harry’s waist, hooking his chin over Harry’s shoulder. “Thank you,” Harry says reverently. He simply can’t put into words his appreciation for Draco’s sweet and thoughtful gift. He tries to show it through his hug, instead. Draco’s hands trail up and down Harry’s back in a soothing motion, and for just a moment, Harry feels like they are clasped in a lover’s embrace.
He shoulders pass Draco, knocking him against the doorframe. Shocked, Draco is unable to unstick his lips to say anything scathing to the older man. Draco instead watches Ahmed make his way down the corridor, his black Ministry robe billowing behind him menacingly. He glances back at Potter.
Smith laughs. “What the hell does Harry even see in you? You're a loser. But then again, he’s always saving the losers. That must be it, isn’t it Malfoy?” Smith asks, shaking Draco. Draco’s screaming on the inside, too many tendrils of fear shooting straight to the core of his mind, the trail icy as he struggles against Smith. His vision is clouding over. He can’t do this.
“I’ve always wanted a cat...a Kneazle...Bart was terribly allergic to cats, so the arrangement with my neighbour, Ms Butterworth, is symbiotic.” At Malfoy’s mentioning of wanting a cat, Harry’s brought back to that day in St Mungo’s, and apparently, the other man is, too. “You know...I never said thank you for helping me that day in Diagon Alley. I’m quite sure I would have been murdered had you not intervened, and no one would have lifted a finger to scrape my corpse up from the cobblestones.” Malfoy says this in a light tone, but Harry doesn’t miss the slight shudder that goes through Malfoy’s body. Harry’s about to respond when the waiter, Andrew, comes by with their appetisers.
“Fashion is the most powerful art there is. It's movement, design and architecture all in one. It shows the world who we are and who we'd like to be. Just like your t-shirt shows the world you'd like to be a used broom salesman," Draco drawls. He hates that Potter is making him so nervous that he’s turning up his arseholeness a notch or two.
stepfathers. I know you think being star-crossed lovers with Potter is terribly chic, but this isn’t the way to go about it, darling.”
“Wow, well done. Your place is beautiful,” Draco says. Pansy turns around, a smile on her makeup-free face. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Pansy without lipstick and the heavy kohl around her eyes.
,” Draco hisses in disbelief. “No wonder he wants to kill me if I don’t get those files back to him. His whole world and all his dreams are about to come crashing down.”
The Shafiq’s have been able to gather the Harpies’ Captain, Gwenog Jones, the amazing Viktor Krum, Pudd United’s Oliver Wood, and even Chudley Cannons’s Joey Jenkins, as well as other well-known players to participate in the Annual Quidditch match. The group of professionals play against each other – Team Purple and Team Gold (to honour the Shafiq family colours), with all proceeds raised going to the Society for Distressed Witches. Draco has already promised five thousand Galleons for Team Purple, Viktor Krum’s team.
“You’re an employee of this Ministry, Malfoy!” someone shouts from the back of the room. Patil, Draco pins.
Draco closes his eyes, regret spurning through him. He wants to burst out: fuck all of this noise! But instead he curls into himself. “We can’t do this.”
Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him in and resting his head in his lap. Draco grips Harry’s hair, his fingers trembling in the unruly locks.
He can feel his hands heat up, the smell of ozone and stale air permeates the Chamber. The wild magic begins to burn down his arms, travelling fast to the tips of his fingers. With a final push, his eyes fly open, his mouth wide as an unholy scream escapes him.
Draco runs a hand through his hair, confused and alarmed. He doesn’t question whether or not someone would be able to peer into his mind. Years and years of compartmentalisation and Occlumency has helped him stay protected in that regard. But for just the tiniest moment, he felt as if Andrews saw something in Draco that he’s tried to hide for years.
Despite the ozone-like smell of wild magic in the air, the size of the crowd doesn’t thin out. Instead, the spectacle seems to draw the attention of
He had recently set up refuge here at the Mandarin Oriental while in London, fresh off his mission in Munich. It was his downtime. No one knew he was here, not even The Society.
person that can see him and he doesn’t remember the last six months of his life. Use that brilliant mind of yours...you know this is the work of something Dark if Potter died, came back in spirit form, but can’t be seen by everyone. You know you can help Potter by just telling us what happened.”
He’s surprised the remark hurts him as much as it does. Worst of all, he knows Potter’s comment holds some serious weight to it, weight Draco’s not willing to address. A part of him wants to yell at Potter – dig his barely-there nails into his skin and tear into him. He wants to ask how he can be so blind, how he can be so oblivious he can’t see how fucking damaging that comment is. How can he not see what he’s been through? “Off you go,” he says, keeping his voice even. “I’ll see you later.” He kisses Potter this time, on the lips, and watches as Potter pulls away to head towards Robards’s office. Draco slumps against the wall, spent.
The Pureblood community had suddenly wanted to be friends with the Davis Family, invite them to the best parties, and encourage the family to turn their bizarre opera gala into an annual event. Now that Muggles, Muggleborns, half-bloods, and even Squibs are
Mr Winthrop retired eight months ago and sold Draco the Apothecary. Business has been good enough lately that Draco’s currently in the works of buying the vacant shop next door to expand the business. It’s been one year since that terrible, violent night, but with all things Draco’s starting to learn and embrace in his life, sometimes you have to work through the shit in order to be more open to the things you want in life, the things you can offer to others, and all the fucking happiness you can stomach.
“It’s easier said than done,” Longbottom pipes up, determinedly staring at the table to avoid everyone’s eyes.
“I was mostly tasked with filling out paperwork. I have a heap of research to do when I get back to the office. I sat in while the Wizengamot sent a few people away to Azkaban, which was a surreal experience.”
Harry’s eyes are sad behind his glasses and for one horrible moment Draco thinks the worst, thinks that this is it, that he’s finally going to lose the love of his life.
“Anyone fancy another cocktail?” she asks. Everyone nods, and Harry shoots up from his seat, uprooting Dennis a bit, the poor small mousy-haired man’s eyes shifting back and forth as he catches himself from sliding over into Harry’s now empty seat.
Marcus ignores him, seemingly on a roll with his story. “And now Father will usurp that loser Shafiq for Chief Warlock.” He snorts. “The exiting Chief Warlock Mormont is all for throwing his support behind my father. It’ll go down in the history books. The first man to be nominated outside of the Wizengamot for one of their most prestigious positions! Mormont has no choice, what with the threat of his sordid affairs with his attaché being exposed to his stupid, Mudblood wife. That woman owns most of their fortune. He’d be ruined without her. Can you believe it? A Mudblood propping up a Pureblood?”
“Can’t I just want to?” With that, Potter shoots him a devastatingly charming smile and turns on his heel. “Enjoy that tea before it gets too cold,” he says, not turning around.
," Draco snorts, recalling their awful encounter at The Apothecary as he drapes Potter’s arm over his shoulder. He carries most of Potter’s weight as they slowly cross the road, Potter limping beside him.
“Shut up and let me speak,” he demands. “You’ve confirmed my worst fears, Potter, by going behind my back and arranging my case to be pushed to the top. I knew you would only see me as a victim. It’s one of the reasons I hesitated in coming to you about the attack.” His voice is cold and detached. The expression on Potter’s face is proof enough to Draco that he’s landing blows. “I knew you would make me out to be some hopeless, used-up coward that needs his Golden Boyfriend, The Prat Who Won’t Die, to come in and save him.”
“You’re quite mistaken. I would never say something so crass and problematic. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a shift at the hospital tonight and would like to drop all this stuff off home beforehand,” he says, gesturing to his shopping bags. “Have a nice day.” Malfoy gives him a curt nod, the corner of his mouth lifting just so as he slings his bags onto his shoulder and walks away.
“You’ll see!” she cries, placing a warm, wet kiss onto Draco’s left cheek. “You’ll feel so much better afterwards. You won’t think twice about it being Potter!”
“C’mon, Draco. If there’s an issue, I’d like it if we talked it out, just get it out there so we can tackle it together.”
Draco closes his eyes, slouching in his seat and resigning himself to the fact that he’s quickly losing control, now that Andrews is another layer to an already complex situation.
“Again?’ Harry asks, loud enough for Draco to hear. Draco jumps, his head whipping to the side to stare at him.
Potter chuckles, shooting Draco another warm smile. “Have a good night,” he says before ducking out of the office.
He waits ten more minutes, until the cafe stand opens, purchases tea with a cheese danish and heads to the lifts for Level 9. He’s in a foul mood now. Potter knows Draco’s been running himself ragged trying to end this project. Potter knows what awaits the both of them in doing so. Annoyed, Draco wonders if Potter’s tardiness has anything to do with what transpired last evening, if perhaps Draco read the entire encounter wrong. He cringes at the thought, but pulls out his wand and shoots out an urgent, tersely-worded memo to Potter’s cubicle.
Draco sighs in frustration, a hand coming up to cover his mouth as he slowly approaches the polaroids again. He finds the most troubling image, the one that has been on his mind since finding the dossier, and deciphers it.
The market is just opening up, nowhere as busy as it’ll be in an hour or so. He’s out early to miss the tourists and search for Blaise’s birthday gifts. Draco has a habit of collecting small trinkets for him several weeks in advance of his birthday, culminating in purchasing one large, substantial gift the day before. Blaise had recently taken up Muggle photography, something he’s bonded over with the Thomas twat, exploring artistic expressions, aesthetics, and what have you. Draco wants to show that he, too, can appreciate the depth of Blaise’s artistic ability, definitely more than some lousy two-bit artist, and so he’s out in Notting Hill searching for vintage Muggle cameras.
Draco inwardly sighs. Leave it to Pansy to stir the cauldron in such a silly way. He doesn’t need to see if Harry will react to Draco finding João attractive, he can feel the discomfort radiating off the other man.
Harry hasn’t allowed himself to feel that way for anyone in so long. He’s learned to live without love, but Draco has always been the exception to every rule in Harry’s life, hasn’t he? But the disappointment and rage in Draco’s eyes slices through Harry like a knife through butter.
Draco laughs, the feeling stemming from deep in his stomach as he thuds his head against Harry’s shoulder. Days after leaving Harry to rent a room in Enfield, Draco sent him signed divorce papers. Draco had never properly followed up on them, believing Harry would honour them. “I don’t know if I should kiss you or slap you for your hard-headedness,” Draco says before promptly breaking into sobs.
Draco is ripped from his daydream. He blinks several times before he realises he’s not in the alley torturing the stranger, but standing before the kitchen counter, a food container in his hands, rather than grasping the handle of his Hawthorn wand.
A dry bark of a laugh escapes Draco’s throat as he bows his head. “I’ve been asking myself that for almost four years now and all I can say is—fuck, no.”
Draco relaxes. They both breathe in and out precariously, not wanting to come too soon. Potter shudders and whimpers as Draco carefully lifts off Potter’s cock, his hands planting on Potter’s chest as he lifts his hips before rolling them to press back down onto Potter’s cock again, pleasure exploding through every nerve ending in his body. He
“Tracey! Merlin, it’s been ages. You look gorgeous, as always,” Draco starts, realising that gone are her long, thin braids. Her hair is now straight, parted down the middle, and brushes her shoulders. He used to
“Martin, mate, you’re makin’ me blush,” Harry teases, but his eyes crinkle at the corners as his cheeks dimple, and Draco can’t help but find their entire exchange endearing.
“Whatever you have Harry involved in will come out, Smith, and do you really think the Ministry isn’t going to protect Harry over you?”
, I just—it felt like I could breathe again. It was like the first gush of breath a person takes when they break the surface of water after nearly drowning. It was like coming alive with the love in that cloak and you—you smell like nostalgia, like hope after so much destruction, desire after a lifetime of numbness, and home. You smell like
“I’d like the evaluation forms for any other medical treatments Mr Malfoy is having here,” Harry had demanded. She had popped her gum in Harry’s face before rolling her eyes at his request.
is a much better source for information on the latest topics,” Luna says, her silvery eyes dancing as she looks up at Theo.
There’s a moment of silence between them before Harry suddenly laughs, uncontrollably and tinged with despair.
Fear paralyses him, his legs locking as his jaw clenches, the hairs on his arms standing erect. Beside him Granger is using every single non-Defensive spell she can think of to undo the backlash of magic.
“Yes,” Draco says. When Potter’s shoulders curl inward, dropping his eyes away from Draco, his hand flies out to wrap around Potter’s wrist tightly. The skin under his hand is warm and smooth, and as soon as Draco touches him, the warmth seeps into him too. He can feel the subtle presence of Potter’s magic all along his arm, the usual torrential energy now like a gentle ebbing of water against a shore under Draco’s skin. Potter’s breath catches as he peers back up at Draco. “I didn’t share that with you to make you feel like rubbish or to make you feel guilty. I want you to know that receiving these scars was the beginning of a phenomenal paradigm shift in my life. They helped me change as a person, and I wear them now without shame, fear, or regret of my choices. They made me who I am today.”
But he covers it with a bandage and with layers of clothing, and, for a few hours at least, he can place the bruise aside.
“I know that,” Harry says, his shoulders slumping as the heat flees from his body. There’s an angry, miserable buzzing in his ears; he’s cold, sore and very afraid of the direction this conversation is going.
. He’s angry, humiliated, tired, and desperate for a smoke. He thinks about the emergency pack of cigarettes shoved in the left shoe of his old brown Oxfords. If he stands on the balcony, Pansy won’t fuss as much…
“Mummy uses the same collar on her Afghan Hounds,” Pansy says, fingering the ridiculous collar. “It zaps them if they get too close to the restricted perimeter around the estate.”
“No,” Harry grumbles. “I mean, yes...but it was my idea first!” Harry exclaims. Really, technically, it was Hermione’s. He’s had two sessions so far with Healer Trenchenbaum, and he had to admit that it wasn’t all that bad. “Is he bringing anyone?” he asks, polishing off his glass.
It’s Luna’s birthday, and there are too many people in the house. Too many people he’s hurt in the past, too many people who would have no qualms trying to hurt him if they all didn’t spend so much time shooting him pitying looks. Everyone knows why he’s living with Pansy. Everyone knows he witnessed his Mother’s death and they pity him. They pity the poor, useless ex-Death Eater turned Healer turned Unspeakable. He’s non-threatening now, because he’s too sad to be anything else but pathetic.
There’s another flicker of emotion in Granger’s eyes. It looks pained as a low sound, almost like a gurgle, bubbles up her throat as she wraps her arms around her belly, her lower lip trembling. She holds herself like this for a few nerve-wracking beats before she straightens up in her seat. Draco watches her with growing dread as Potter’s words come rushing back to him―this isn’t Granger at all.
He’s relieved when Flint senior claps him on the shoulder and thanks him. It also helps that his nifty snuff bullet is placed carefully in his back pocket. Draco doesn’t think he’ll use it, but knowing it’s there in case his natural good mood plateaus keeps him afloat.
,” Pansy jeers. “You should relax, Granger, you’re going to get wrinkles from all that complaining,” Pansy adds, peering down at her red-painted nails.
Blaise places a consoling hand on his arm. “There was...there was a lot of casting. I saw their Auror buddies separating them before dragging them off down the corridor. That’s
“A bullet too?” Potter asks hastily, licking his dry, cracked lips. His eyes skate down the length of Draco's body. Assessing. Remembering. Appreciating.
On the opposite end of the room is his former boss, Chief Prosecutor Watson. Watson stands tall and confident in his black robes, his reddish-brown hair parted neatly on the left. He looks at Draco as if he’s little more than a spot of gum under his three-hundred galleon shoes. Draco cringes as he takes his seat on the hard wooden chair in the centre of the Wizengamot floor.
He should’ve done more. He should’ve grabbed Mother and Apparated away. He should have Hexed the man. He should have...
“One thing I do not joke about, Potter, is real estate.” The Malfoy London property is obscenely extravagant and located just across Buckingham Palace. Draco can see why Potter’s in awe, his neighbour is technically the Queen. Draco waves his hand. “It’s been in the family for
“No, you don’t!” Draco shouts, his hand curling around Harry’s wrist. Harry’s head whips around to glare down at Draco.
Draco flushes. “I’m sure you say that to all the girls,” he quips, winking, holding his hand out. “I think you’re beautiful, too.”
“She’s given up information on her own father's rise in the Wizengamot. We were able to flip him to be a double agent for us, under the agreement that if his information proves to be useful in the end, he’ll have full immunity.”
“It’s fine, Draco, don’t ever apologise for crying. I don’t think you should have smoked that spliff.” Potter’s now rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s shoulder blade. “I’m going to tell everyone to head out, yeah?”
I forgave you the very next day. I told you I’d wait for you to come around Harry. I know our break up hasn’t been easy on you and I

There are several groans after that, but Robards ignores them as he sweeps out the room. Harry instead smiles out at the crowd of Aurors.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asks, drawing his attention back to the bag. He finds a small vial of blue liquid and unstoppers it, the scent of lavender and peppermint powerful. He tips the man’s head back just far enough to pour the potion down his throat, the effects immediate as the man’s eyes flutter shut.
“Shush! Just because we’re Disillusioned doesn’t mean people can’t bloody hear us! C’mon!” Pansy says suddenly, her face now refreshingly alert and her posture straight as an iron rod as she beckons them towards a large bush on the side of the house.
Potter shrugs. “Tracey trusts you, and that’s an excellent endorsement if I’ve ever known one. You’re alright in my book, Malfoy, and I meant what I said about a truce. I’d like for us to put all our ugliness of the past behind us so we can try to, I don’t know, be friendly to one another.”

like a ghost, and Draco finds this the most unsettling. Potter’s not the greyish-silver colour of the ghosts Draco has encountered in his short life, instead he’s three-dimensional and familiar. Potter looks like himself: a vagabond-looking man dressed in ill-fitted Muggle jeans and a rumpled button down, shaggy hair pulled back into a messy bun, a five-o-clock shadow gracing his sharp jawline, and a slightly dangerous look about him. And like in the living, his presence seems to fill the entire room with a thrum of barely-contained excitable energy laced with just a hint of melancholy. The only difference now, is that there seems to be a hint of lingering Dark magic attached to Potter’s presence.
“If we were going to brave the Muggle world together, we had to have the very best guide,” Harry says with a laugh.
Draco hushes her, running a hand soothingly through her hair. “Don’t worry about that. I can handle them. Please don’t make yourself sick with worry. Nothing has happened. Nothing is going to happen,” he says, for her and more so for himself.
All he can do is nod, his hands running up Bitty’s hips as she turns to face him once more. Her face is flushed, lips swollen and wet. Instead of pulling her knickers down, Draco takes a moment to slide his hands up her body, his fingertips caressing her hot flesh as he moves to knead her soft breasts. The small noises escaping from her are intoxicating and he can no longer wait. He slides his hand down into her knickers, his fingers dancing through the trimmed line of hair to push two fingers inside. They both groan, Bitty lifting onto the tips of her toes briefly, her hands grasping Draco’s shoulders like a lifeline. She’s so fucking wet
“Ease up, Zach,” Potter says, his hand coming out to clap Smith on the shoulder. Smith shrugs him off a little too aggressively in Draco’s opinion. The shuttered look on Potter’s face is another bit of information Draco charts away for later.
“Oh,” he says quietly, trying to keep his voice even as he says, “I’m sorry to hear that you two broke up. You er, didn’t mention it.”
“Take care of yourself, Potter. You were quite alright,” Pansy says with a nod, wrapping her arm around Luna’s shoulders as she reaches them. “We’ll head out this way.” Pansy inclines her head towards the shared loo. “If you need us we’ll be in the kitchen.”
Confused, Draco places his mug down. “Alright.” Draco rolls his shoulders, feeling slightly warm. He tugs his jumper down a bit.
“I have to tell you, Mr Malfoy, that we are a split community it seems,” Simmons says, opening the briefcase set between them. He pulls out a copy of
Harry doesn’t at all miss the disappointed look that crosses Draco’s face when he gets up to use the loo.
“Potter!” shouts Robards. Potter’s boss strides down the corridor, his face apoplectically purple. “I want your arse in my office in five minutes,” the older man growls, beady eyes shrewdly roaming over them, no doubt taking in their intimate position.
“That too,” Draco chuckles. “I was unsure if I wanted to show my face in the Magical community in such a bold way, but being here with you makes the whole ordeal marginally better.”
“Oh!” Kreacher cries. “If Master Black is being taking Kreacher away as the one and true heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, Kreacher will be doing anything,
employees as he dances with Draco. Harry wouldn’t even call what they were doing dancing, just a bunch of poorly executed twists, twirls, and dips around the dance floor as they laugh in one another’s face.
“Bloody hell, where’d I put the parchment with my notes?” he mumbles to himself. To his surprise, Draco answers.
Once again, Pansy laughs in her familiar tight, condescending way. “Darling, the Shafiq’s are a well-liked family by the Ministry. Did you know Ahmed donated to Shacklebolt’s campaign for Minister for Magic? That’s a sure way to remain under the radar.”
“I forgave you a long time ago,” Draco says solemnly. “I had to contend with a lot of my anger and pain in order to leave it behind me. It was the only way I would be able to move forward with my life.”
This story is about surviving and recovering from non/con as much as it’s about an individual learning how to interact with their partner after such a devastating experience. It is my intention to depict Draco’s experiences after surviving and reporting a stranger rape. I wanted to show some of the struggles that survivors go through when their lives are disrupted through the horrendous act of rape. The reality about rape and consent? It is a two-sided coin. Rape is an epidemic. For far too long people have stayed silent, and that is why we have seen movements in America and elsewhere today such as #MeToo and #TimesUp. This is why we have fests that highlight the importance of consent, why we celebrate consent and enthusiastic consent. I wanted to show a fictional depiction of assault and the aftermath of assault, so we see why these conversations are important, yes, but to also show the thoughts that run through an individual's mind that extends beyond cut and dry 'clinical responses' to rape. I also wanted to show that arriving to the healing process after rape is not always an easy straight line. We’ve seen through the media (or maybe through loved ones or our own personal struggles) that it can take days, months, years for people to come forward, having decided not to immediately disclose their rape to their loved ones or police.
“Really? What did you do, Potter, talk about yourself on the first date?” Harry can feel his cheeks flush because really, wasn’t that the problem? The young woman, Natalie, was kind and sweet and sexy, but she was also hellbent on asking him about the war. Simply put, it was unsettling.
around himself just in case, but he doesn’t want Harry to transform alone. He will never let Harry go through that alone again.
But honestly…they were on their way to getting married. They’ll come back from their travels engaged and reinvigorated. He’ll play his role as the best mate and be extremely happy for them, despite feeling like he’s dying on the inside. Hermione will make a beautiful bride – poised and elegant as ever, and Ron will make a handsome groom.
Mia rolls her eyes. “I’m from the not-so-dark-and-criminally-insane side of the family, obviously.” She shrugs. “We rode out the war in the States, didn’t want anything to do with
“Out of everything that you still need to overcome, the world of hurt still waiting, this doesn’t have to be a part of the process you go through alone. Please,” Harry urges, his voice strong enough to cut through Draco’s fog of misery. “Let me be in the truth with you.”
Draco watches with amusement as Pansy samples each sweet displayed on the buffet table like a modern-day Marie Antoinette. It’s an impressive spread according to Pansy, who is the type of person to carry a small box of Jean-Paul Hévin assorted macarons in her Chanel. He’s only distracted from her meticulous browsing when he catches sight of Saeed across the garden chatting with his new boyfriend, a close friend of the family apparently, as the pair were thrown together by Farida herself.
“You know that’s not true. You wouldn’t be here sitting at my table talking to me if that were true,” Harry says reassuringly.
say something like this to him after a year of ignoring him, a year of forgetting him, of letting go of him. He turns on his heel and all but runs back to the Burrow, his heartbeat pounding in his ears. As the lights of the Burrow come into view, he feels a hand wrap around his arm.
losing the plot. He gives Rose a shaky little smile. “Happy Birthday, my little Rose,” he says thickly. He hastily walks over to where Weasley sits in an armchair sipping on a drink and lazily flipping through the wireless. He hands the baby over. “She looks beautiful, as always,” Draco compliments as Weasley takes her from him. He means it. She’s dressed in a majestic peach-coloured chiffon tutu dress, a matching coloured flower headband in her wild, copper coloured curls.
“It’s a bit complicated Harry. I…I’m just no longer interested in having sex with you. Or any man. Ever.”
Surprise blinks across Potter’s face before he nods. “Sure Malfoy…I guess, well, I guess I’ll see you around these parts,” he says carefully.
you,” Malfoy hisses, two patches of colour blooming high on his sharp cheekbones as he quickly rises to his feet. “I didn’t come here for
Harry leans back in his chair to give Draco an incredulous look. “I can’t imagine she’d be, Draco. You’re insanely successful. Your mum will come around.”
” Harry stops himself. “We have this moment now,” he says, as if trying to reassure himself. “I want this moment to count, to be burned into both of our memories forever.”
