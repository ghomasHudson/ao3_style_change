Harry decided to hide where his smell might be cloaked a bit, and after discarding the option of his library for its relative lack of cover, he chose his bedroom, shutting the door behind him in hopes that Draco would not be able to manage the knobs with his paws. It seemed silly to go for the bed, though it would certainly be saturated with Harryness, so he climbed into his wardrobe and pulled the door nearly completely shut.
Harry smiled, “Of course.”
“I restrain myself around half the time, actually.”
“I just need a chalkboard to show you the options I thought of. Oh, and to compare them to yours and decide which we all like better,” Theodore added. “We could put it to a vote.”
“Oh yes, since before you woke up,” Draco said with a little laugh as he seated himself astride Harry. “There’s a spell. I’ll teach it to you some time. Are you ready?”
“Are you a werewolf also?” Theodore asked, almost inaudibly and looking past the welcome wizard with his chin lowered so that his spectacles slipped down his nose.
Draco chuckled, “Yes, you owe me big time for this.”
Ginny had a little confusion line between her eyebrows, “It crossed my mind, yeah. Mostly I thought you were just jealous and sad and pissed off. Not necessarily a homophobe.”
“I miss having fun with you, Harry,” Ginny said presently. “I feel like I only make you sad now, and I hate that.”
Harry raised his wand and Summoned the basket of scones from the pantry.
“Sorry.”
“A bit hurt,” said Draco rather defensively. “I only needed some dittany, and I’m all right now.”
“Ah of course,” Draco caught Harry’s eye and smiled. “Of course he will.”
“I’ll help too,” Harry offered. They each started at a new painting and carefully cut the enraged portraits out of their frames. Theodore using the knife and Harry and Draco both using Severing Charms. When they’d cut down every portrait that hung in the corridor, Draco sealed them all up with his wand and tucked them away inside his bag.
“Loosely,” said Draco carelessly, finishing his drink. “Don’t you think we’d be better off working together?”
Draco nodded, his eyes shut.
Theodore nodded, “All right.”
“Your best mate?” Harry looked about again, “This doesn’t seem like Goyle’s sort of place.”
“It wasn’t because you’re gay,” Harry said earnestly when the door had shut behind them.
“Ah, well. I’m happy you’re happy.”
“Of course,” Draco returned the kiss. “Thanks for letting me bring Shadowfax. She’s very attentive while I’m transformed, and I think she’d get a bit upset if I wasn’t around.”
Theodore thought about it, “Not really. Hang on. Draco said sometimes it could make people unsafe? Is that it?”
“You could Banish them to my room by magic, if you wanted to though,” Theo wheedled.
“Of course. This way, please.”
“All right.”
“You’re looking better,” Harry said cheerily, bringing Draco his plate. “I hope you’re feeling better as well.”
“Do you need some more Strengthening Solution? I could make some if you’re out.”
Harry pet his hair, “I’ll go first if you like.”
Sure enough, the rug in front of the bed was rumpled and askew as if someone had lain on the floor and dragged themself across it. And just peeping out from under the dust ruffle was the curve of a blunt little tail, the colour of a cobweb.
“I don’t make out it was some grand plan necessarily,” said Hermione. “It was probably just. An impulse.”
“Well. I suppose I don’t really know you anymore.” Harry took a scone himself, though he’d had a good breakfast only an hour before, “Hermione says she’s seen you around the Ministry lately.”
“I do, don’t I? I expect it’ll look even better when I take my coat off in the restaurant and you can see the whole thing.”
After they finished in Eyelops, Draco said he needed to be off, which made Harry feel ashamed again. They walked him to the Apparition area, and Theodore made Draco promise to come see him off on the Hogwarts Express, and Draco promised readily enough.
“You might’ve just used Tergeo,” Harry pointed out.
“It won’t be for him like it was for Remus,” Harry said quietly. “Things are different now.”
Harry rested a hand on it. It was quite steady and still, “I don’t feel anything.”
“Maybe something like the Den, sort of similar to the Burrow, but for wolves," suggested Harry.
“I think it’s got a cursed relic hidden inside,” Malfoy pulled out the desk chair and pulled out his golden stethoscope again. “Yes, that’s definitely it,” said Malfoy with grim satisfaction. “Interesting little thing. Never seen casing quite like this,” he held it out for Harry to see.
“He was quite obsessed with Harry in return, though,” said Hermione, thoughtfully rubbing her pregnant belly where she had dripped raspberry juice on her shirt. “He was always seeking him out and bothering him. He used to come and find him on the train to school every single year. Except sixth year. I suppose that’s what set you off, Harry.”
“Came looking for you.”
Draco returned a moment later and pushed himself close to Harry as he reclaimed his seat, “Now that you’re out of the closet, perhaps you’ll see fit to warm up my cold hands?” He held out the hand that wasn’t clutching his cup.
“A play about lycanthropes, maybe,” Harry said slowly, beginning to cotton on.
Theo did. Nothing happened.
“Fire away.”
“Of course you do,” Dean was already swinging himself back over the counter and gathering up wands from the shelves. He poked a wand box at Theodore, “Try this one. Applewood and dragon heartstring. Ten and a quarter inches and a bit whippy.”
Harry felt cold with shame, despite the mild night, “I’m sorry.”
Harry gave Draco’s shoulder a little shove, “Spoiled, rude, full of himself.”
“Oh, erm.” Harry used the remote control to pause the tape and tried to give Draco a concise explanation of films. Draco slumped against him as he spoke, and Harry thought he was probably bored hearing about it, but he was grateful for the contact anyway.
Draco yawned a tremendous yawn and eased off the sofa.
“You’re squeezing my hand,” Malfoy held up their joined hands. “And your shoulders are all hunched up. Just roll them back and. Unclench. Relax. Take a deep breath. Are you worried about what’s behind the door?”
Harry sat down on the bed and kissed him, “I didn’t know you wanted me lying next to you the whole time like a very big teddy. Are you hungry?”
Harry cleared his throat, “‘Tis a truth universally acknowledged…’”
They went to Flourish and Blott’s for Theodore’s books first. Theodore got very caught up in reading his books right there in the store and had to be gently prodded up to the till and reminded that they had several other shops to visit. Draco bought him a handsome set of quills and paid extra for an Anti Borrowing Charm.
“Er. Do you want me to go?”
Draco shook his head, “No, actually. She’s very clearly inspired by Granger, so what you’re communicating to the wizarding world about yourself is your outsized desire to avoid the spotlight. Still you can’t help being kind of fantastic, can you?”
Harry shook his head.
“I really did want to know how you knew you liked each other,” Harry persisted.
“All right,” Theodore said.
“My wand’s fine. I’ve actually come in with my godson,” Harry stepped back and nudged Theodore forward, “My godson Theodore Lupin.”
“Milk please,” said Malfoy. “He has met me.”
“Nice to meet you, Theodore,” Kal rose briefly from his seat behind the welcome desk and leaned over it to give Theo a high five. “I like your hair.”
It was there that Theodore and Harry met Andromeda Tonks. She was healing slowly but well, and had so far recovered herself enough to come out in her hospital robes and fluffy purple slippers and sit with them for nearly an hour before getting tired enough that she had to go back to her room and lie down.
Up close, Harry noticed that although he’d thought the wooden object was a box, there didn’t seem to be any opening or even a seam to show where it had shut, “Are you sure there’s something inside?”
“Nothing. I mean it was a long time ago,” Harry said apologetically. “You sent me that valentine when you were in first year and I was in second year. The singing one. ‘His eyes are as green’ as a something or other.”
The heat in Harry’s ears was spreading across his face. He hoped it wasn’t visible on his cheeks, “Well it’s. You.” He scanned Draco’s face, taking in his thick blond lashes and brows, his laughing silvery eyes, the sharp nose and high cheekbones. The cupid’s bow curve of his lip. “I suppose people don’t choose their faces,” Harry mumbled, burning.
Theodore was very pale, his mouth still open as if to scream. He nodded slowly.
“I’d’ve thought Andromeda would have talked to him about it by now.”
“Have you got a wolfsbane source yet? Some people just go to the apothecary, but they just have whoever’s on duty when your order comes up brew it, and it helps a lot to have a specific potioneer you get it from so that the formula is more consistent. And there’re workshops that teach you how to brew it yourself as well. Some people choose confinement over wolfsbane, but it’s really not recommended for such young patients, because it can cause adverse outcomes in terms of mental health.”
“Love’s not trivial and selfish, Harry,” Hagrid said seriously, coming back to the table from the fireplace. “And there’s more to it than sacrifice. You can look after your godson without losing yourself in it.”
“Yeah!” agreed Theodore, setting down a plate of pancakes at the table. “And I made the pancakes with chocolate bits in them, and that always makes it a good day.”
“About my name. I think at Hogwarts, I want people to call me Theodore. I mean I want everyone to call me Theodore, and I thought it might be easiest to start at my new school.”
“How did you two know you wanted to be together?” he asked suddenly.
Malfoy nodded gravely, speaking around a mouthful of scone, “Ah we’ve reached the topic of your fan mail at last. I wondered when we would.”
“They were really helpful,” Harry added. “I’ve got a lot of reading to do.”
“If a bacon butty is the best example of your cooking skills you can manage, you may be a weaker cook than you seem to think, Potter,” said Draco, but there was no heat in it.
Through the window, they could see Theo’s friends converge on him to greet and hug him and admire his kitten. Theodore stuck his head out of the window Ara had just vacated to wave briefly to them, then as the train began to pull away from the platform, he withdrew his head and was lost in the crush of students in the corridor.
Ron chewed his lip, his face clouded,  “Nobody thinks you’re a fool, and nobody thinks you’re going to fly off the handle. We thought it would. Stir up bad memories to talk about Malfoy.”
“Mmm,” said Hermione, rubbing her chin. “I sort of think it’s probably not a coincidence.”
Malfoy raised his wand almost casually and pointed it at the ghoul. Some shimmering lavender mist wafted out and settled briefly on the ghoul before being absorbed into it. Malfoy then holstered his wand and lifted the ghoul off the wall, folding it deftly into quarters as if it were actually only a tapestry. He pulled a sack out of his bag and stuffed the ghoul inside, then tied off the mouth of the sack in a tight knot. The ghoul bestirred itself once it was in the sack, bulging and wriggling in Malfoy’s hand.
“I’m very sorry that I was such a horrid little tick to you at school,” Malfoy said. Then after a pause in which he looked hard at Harry’s face til Harry wondered if he had jam on him as well. “And I’m sorry for the time I trod on your nose in particular.”
“What are you doing?” Theo was standing, backlit at the other end of the corridor.
“I’ve got to,” Draco said, his voice still rather faint. “There’s no one else.” He waved away the Strengthening Solution and took another pull on the pain potion. “I’m sorry. I should’ve told you it isn’t very nice to look at.”
Draco put down his bag, set the basket on the bed, and opened it, “This is Sirius’s room, isn’t it?”
“Hmm,” Ginny poured out for everyone. “You know when you can’t stop thinking about like cold pie and Mum’s Sunday potatoes and parsnip mash with that little sprinkle of paprika on top and the crispy end bits of a roast and apple tart, and eventually you’re like ohhhh,” she slapped her forehead for emphasis, “
Harry snorted, “It was Malfoy.”
“It seems to have had a very specific effect on you,” Harry tweaked Draco’s hair away from his face to watch him blush.
Harry put his cup down on the table, “Well, because there’s no need for you to and because. I don’t want you to. There may be something that would frighten or hurt you, and I don’t want to put you through it.”
,” at the absolute top of his voice.
Harry sank into his own bed a very few minutes later, grateful for the sleep that was rising quickly to meet him.
He dropped the bag with the ghoul in it gently on the carpet and brushed the dust from his hands heatedly, taking a step toward Harry as he spoke, “Listen to me, Potter. I didn’t become a cursebreaker and then lie in wait for years and years, hoping for your notice so that I could weasel myself into your house and hex you or something. Since I am not an obsessive lunatic, I’m hardly going to risk my excellent job for the sake of some schoolboy grudge. It was over a decade ago. I’m not nursing any animosity-”
“You’re not wearing your rosette,” Harry remarked as he and Draco climbed the hill toward the Hogwarts quidditch pitch one cold, bright December morning. There was a quidditch match at Hogwarts on the last day before the Christmas holiday, and Harry and Draco had gone up to see the match and to take Theodore out for dinner in Hogsmeade before the journey home. Theodore was very excited as he had never seen Hogsmeade before. Harry was also excited. Draco was rather nervous.
“I think I might actually be insane,” Harry announced.
Harry raised his wand to light the wall sconces, since Theodore’s bedside lamp had been destroyed, then sat down on the bed, “Erm. Theo, I want you to know that’s not what werewolves are like, okay? The boggart was meant to be a werewolf, yeah? When Remus transformed, he looked like an ordinary wolf. So, er. When you do start transforming when you get older, you won’t ever be that. All right?”
Theodore screamed again just as Harry reached his door, and Harry blasted the door open with his wand and dodged as a lamp whizzed past him and smashed against the wall. Theodore seized the carafe on his night table in both hands and hurled it with all his strength, but it too missed its mark.
Harry crept up to the bed and lowered himself slowly to his knees, scarcely breathing. He reached for the dust ruffle very slowly, as if moving too quickly would make a noise, trying to hold in the giggles that wanted to rise up from his chest. Just as his fingers brushed the cloth, Draco burst out from under the bed and jumped at him, knocking him over.
“All right. I’ll count, and off you go and hide.” Harry shut his eyes and covered the lenses of his glasses with his hands, and began to count down from a hundred. He could hear the soft, quick click of Draco’s nails against the kitchen floor as he hurried off to hide.
Draco blushed scarlet, “Lord and lady, Potter!”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “Really?”
“I don’t know what that means,” Harry said flatly.
“You said Belle Brewer isn’t you, but you also said that the magical world needs more art and fiction so that we can understand each other better. How can it be both? Something’s very fishy here, Potter.”
“Oh good!” Theo tossed his book bag onto the floor. “You’re still here. I was hoping to see you.”
“Riddikulus!” Harry bellowed, and the boggart exploded into dust, which glittered in the air for a moment, then settled dingily to the carpet. Harry turned to Theodore, “You okay?”
As he trotted out of the room, Harry decided that Draco would likely be able to sniff him out with his heightened wolfish sense of smell quite easily, so he decided to cheat. He cast a quick Disillusionment Charm on himself and shot a Muffliato toward Draco for good measure.
“That’s a good thing,” Draco said patiently. And by the time Harry finished his breakfast, Draco was sound asleep.
Draco nodded, and they collected their coats, then  walked out of the theatre to the pavement, where the January night air flew past refreshing to a deep, sharp chill. Their noses began to run nearly at once.
“Yes,” said Draco quietly.
Malfoy looked very well, compared to the last time they’d met when he’d been drawn with fear and misery and looking quite pale and rather scrawny. His face had healthy colour, and he’d grown into his pointed features in the interim years. His sleek blond hair now hung to his shoulders, pulled partially back in a neat half knot. He wore simple navy blue robes and had a large black satchel hung over one shoulder.
Theodore considered for a moment, “It was bigger than I thought it would be.”
“The first time is the worst,” Draco dug his fork into his helping of steak and kidney pie with relish. “This looks scrumptious. Though I think I could probably be wheedled into ice cream afterward.”
Draco looked up from examining a cage of white rats, “A familiar offers often essential emotional support, Potter. It’s not a mere pet. It’s a friend and companion and once a bond is established, develops a unique sympathy with the wizard it is attached to. In some cases, it can be a mutually protective bond, where the familiar cares for and looks after the wizard nearly as much as the wizard looks after the familiar.”
“Oh, he was like a lot of things.” Harry drew a deep, thinking sort of breath and leaned against the back of the settee, “I think he must have been a lot like you actually, when he was a kid. I think he was a lot like you were at Hogwarts.”
Kal made a slightly unseemly sound himself, but gamely waved goodbye as they made their way toward the door, “Bye Theodore! Bye Theodore’s dad!”
“Yes, exactly. You know a lot about it, Theo.”
“It went to me, actually. He’s just a kid, and I’m looking after him. And he isn’t a Black, he’s a Lupin!” Harry snapped.
Draco shut his eyes helplessly. “I really like beards,” he mumbled. “That wasn’t the only reason, of course. But.”
“I do. It’s lovely.” Harry looked about, “Is there no one else here or is the island just too big to see them?”
“The valentine!”
“It can go a long way, though,” Dudley said bracingly. “What is the problem?”
“Isn’t it? Owing your life itself to this person. Being desperate to find them, and knowing they know you but having only the tiniest details about them. Tiny intimate details. Just the sound of their voice and their patronus.”
Ginny glared back, “Touchy.” But she did return her attention to her pudding, muttering inaudibly to Luna, who kissed her on the cheek.
He took Harry to a wizarding museum, formerly the family home of the MacNairs. There were a number of fascinating magical artifacts there, and all sorts of portraits that could recount the history of the subject and answer questions. Harry even found a portrait of his father’s father, Fleamont Potter which gave him bemused but detailed answers to Harry’s excited questions about James’ childhood, though it could not be made to understand  that Harry was James’ son.
Harry checked his watch as well. He wasn’t sure why, “Do you want privacy? I could leave. I mean go to my room.”
Harry snorted, “Think we’ve got enough space?”
“Well, yes they talk, but it isn’t a friendly chat about the horrible weather. Please trust me that you won’t like it.”  Theodore nodded again and went tiptoeing off to find a bathroom. Harry decided it would be rude to laugh and had his own wash at the kitchen sink before turning his attention to supper.
“That’s not good.”
“Good, now I’ll incant to dissolve it. You just let it pass by and go.” Malfoy looked at Harry, “Relax. I can see you clutching. It won’t go if it doesn’t have your permission.”
Malfoy raised his chin, though his blush was spreading quickly across his face, “Would it be stupid to say sorry?”
Malfoy had gone pale when Harry reached for him, but now for some reason, he was blushing, “Very astute of you. But I hope you’ll excuse me. I can’t really bear to confront the worst night of my life at the moment, particularly not on an empty stomach.”
Draco went quiet for a bit and thoughtfully clinked the ice in his glass before replying, “It’s a bit daunting. This wall of shit.”
“I’m glad you like it. I thought you might like to see some. Well some nice magic.”
“Well,” Harry shrugged. “I’ve got to be. I’m responsible for him.”
“He wants you to teach him about monsters,” Harry said presently.
“I mean I don’t like. Erm. I want to be called Theodore,” Theo insisted. “But you can call me Theo like Harry does, if you like.”
He slipped a quite dry pad out of the pocket of his pinafore as he approached. He spoke with a Scottish accent, but there was something cool and liquid in his voice as well, “Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to Shore. Is this your first time with us?”
“Mine’s got a unicorn hair core, and it certainly went happily along with Harry after he took it off me,” Draco said, gazing at Harry and not Dean.
Harry drew a deep breath, feeling rather squirmy on the inside, “His letters have been coming with Godric because he has been spending a lot of time at Grimmauld Place. And I’ve been spending a lot of time at his place as well. Did you know he also lives in Islington? Er, that’s not really erm. Relevant, though. We’ve been spending a lot of time together because we like each other. A lot.”
“No, Monday’s all right. I can just lock it up again.”
“It makes me feel like a fucking idiot,” Harry said rather jerkily. “When you two discuss me behind my back like you’re my parents, and I’m your naughty kid.”
Draco sat up indignantly, sloshing Harry slightly with firewhiskey.
“Don’t say girlfriend, Potter, or I’ll hex you. I’ve already made it crystal clear that I’m a homosexual, haven’t I? Astoria’s like my younger sister, except she doesn’t have my rubbish parents. I swear you’ll like her. She’s terribly funny and clever. Shades of your Ginny Weasley, actually.”
Harry grinned, “Thanks Hagrid. I’ll have to bring you some other books to tide you over til this one comes out of the oven.”
Harry raised a hand to his nose and felt it, “My nose in particular? Is it crooked?”
“I miss that too,” Harry said. Then, “Can I give you a hug?”
“Mm,” said Harry, trying to tamp down his impatience at not instantly understanding. But he placed his hand on the door as Malfoy instructed.
“Let’s see,” Harry said aloud as he checked behind the piano, “If I were a wolf, where would I hide? Mm, actually. I don’t expect you think much like a wolf does, do you? Because you told me you’re still in your right mind. So.” Harry paused a moment to think, and heard the soft scrabbling of wolfy toenails on the floor overhead. He made for the stairs at once, an inkling of an idea beginning to form in his head.
Draco screwed up his face as if in painful consideration, “I think I’d best not. I won’t be able to get it out of my head til it’s published.”
The fur there was so plush and thick that Harry wasn’t surprised that Draco seemed not to notice at all. He gently stroked a velvet ear instead, and Draco opened one eye that managed to look cross and sleepy.
“But it isn’t a living thing itself. Most old magical houses like this are enchanted to make them. It just needs to be connected to a magical house or the spell wears down. We put them in a sort of insulated chamber, and the magic leaks out over a while, and they stop moving or speaking. But it isn’t death, because there isn’t real life to begin with. ”
“Kal?”
When they had been going out for a couple of months, it occurred to Harry that Draco might enjoy some more artistic pursuits, and brought him to several muggle art museums, and a poetry reading to extremely favourable responses.
“We’re finished for the evening,” said Malfoy. He lifted his bag onto his shoulder.
“Distracting? I mean of course. Yes, of course. No problem.”
Ginny choked on her tea.
“Draco helped him.”
Draco came first, groaning and shaking, but it seemed to Harry that it was only by moments because the trembling of Draco’s body and the hot splash of Draco’s come against him pushed Harry into his own orgasm. With a grunt, Draco collapsed off Harry as completely as if his bones had turned suddenly to pasta. Harry wanted to cuddle him close, but didn’t feel capable of very coordinated movement, so he groped about and found Draco’s hand and kissed it and brought it to his heart.
“I think we’re cousins,” he said rather shyly.
“I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. Especially over something like that. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, and I’m sorry.”
Harry hadn’t been expecting that, and he held out his left hand, feeling rather conscious of how dusty and grubby it was. Malfoy’s hand was cool and soft, as if he’d just washed it. He held onto Harry firmly, like there wasn’t a reason in the world why he shouldn’t.
“See anything?”
“I think he was really brave, actually,” Harry said rather indignantly.
“Right, I’m keeping you away from Uncle George,” Harry said, giving Theo an affectionate shake by the shoulder.
Draco looked rather alarmed and scrubbed at his face again, “Is it always like that?”
Draco tossed his head, “So what? Women are people, Potter. Sometimes people fall in love with each other.”
Draco looked about also, “There don’t seem to be any other patrons just at the moment. I imagine someone’ll come along some time or other.”
Theo nodded, “Yeah, pretty excited. I’m getting my wand today.”
Harry opened his eyes, “What’s this now?”
. We’ll save the trainers for when we go see Granny tomorrow afternoon, yeah?”
I got a writer's block after writing the dinner with Ron and Hermione lmao. I also wanted to say that I don't know how the amount of writing will be looking during the summer. Both my parents are healthcare professionals and I have no idea if they're going to get any vacation at all. Therefore it is unpredictable to know if I'll be home to post or not since we don't have any wifi at my summer house, just a warning I guess... Now! Enjoy!
He found himself at a small restaurant ordering pasta bolognese and Draco ordering a salad, not that he paid attention. Draco telling him about his studies, without too many complicated words, asking questions about Harry’s job, chatting lightly about friends and their lives. Harry didn’t know that Draco could be so funny. Sarcastic, yes. Funny, no. Essentially realizing he doesn’t really know the man and that had to change. He was going to spend his entire summer vacation with him. He knew they’d fight at some point, it was inevitable but they could be avoided. Right?
His heart raced as he stared at Harry who still was fast asleep and despite himself, he smiled fondly at him, picking up a spare hair strand that had fallen onto his face and put it behind the other boy’s ear. While asleep he looked so innocent, unbothered by the cruel world that had raised them.
“He hates killing, even has a problem killing mosquitos” Pansy sighed. “Who is it?” Sabrina looked up at Pansy a look between sadness and anger on her face.
I..... don't.......okay
But of course, the world is against his wishes.
“I do keep up thank you very much, now I got to go back to them talking about, eh, pride next year I think? Bye Potter, thanks for the latte” Harry nodded in response and shot Malfoy his have-a-good-day barista smile. To hear an “OMG DRACO YOU’RE SO GAY” from a girl in the group and laughing to himself before shaking his head and going back to work.
“I can keep my eyes off him thank you very much. I think he’ll handle just fine without me, can I tell you something?” He asked her as they left the campus for the bus, “Sure” she shrugged “I’ve known him since we were 11, we were… not on good terms”, he settled on because that the thing with it really, they weren't really enemies? Sure they disliked each other a lot but, was it really that bad? He didn’t think so.“How come?” She asks catching his attention once again. “I told you about how I was a brat when I was younger? Yeah, that.” Sabrina just nodded quietly as the bus approached. “But you’ve gotten along so well the last weeks, isn’t that behind you?” And when Draco shook his head she sighed. “You’re hopeless Draco” and after that, they fell silent.
“I expect you’d get a bit tangled up otherwise,” Harry said.
“Okay,” said Theodore, getting to his feet. “I know.”
“So you thought you’d butter me up with sex and romance, mm?”
They stepped out onto the gravel of what appeared to be a small islet in the middle of a vast lake, huge enough that tiny waves lapped against the shore. Harry could hear the cry of  water birds in the distance and thought he could even see a ruddy glimmer of vanishing sun near the horizon. Most of the light was coming from live fairies, flitting low enough for them to see each other’s faces clearly. The air was sweet with heather.
“Your fault,” Harry murmured without opening his eyes. He wondered how Draco had known he was awake and decided Draco must have woken him. Shadowfax was on the bed somewhere. He could hear her purring.
“You did just exactly the right thing,” Harry told him. “Scream your head off til help comes and fight it off with anything you’ve got at hand. I’m so proud. That was a boggart, though. There’s a special trick to getting rid of them, as you saw. Once you’ve got your wand and a little training under your belt at Hogwarts, I’ll show you how to do it. Okay?”
“Ergh,” Harry shuddered. “I usually give Theo some ice cream afterward. The first time, I didn’t think he’d be able to get it down.”
Harry snorted, “Hur hur very funny. Want to see your room?”
Harry stifled giggles behind his hand, then jumped when the latch on the bedroom door clicked and popped open. Harry tried to press himself back behind the hanging robes. Through the miniscule slit between the door and the wardrobe, Harry could see Draco move methodically about the room to check the bed first, then he pranced up to the wardrobe and pulled the door open with his teeth.
Andromeda leaned down to take the book off the boat and looked down at it, still looking rather shocked. She read the title aloud, “
Harry offered to take Theodore for an ice cream at Fortescue's, but Theo said it wouldn’t be fair on Twinkle. Which was what he’d named the cat. So Harry shrank the parcels for easy carrying, and they walked home. Theodore carrying Twinkle in a domed basket with a mesh over it so that she could see out and Harry carrying everything else, shrunk down to fit into a single carrier bag.
Harry couldn’t help laughing, “You look like you want something. Are you hungry? Would you like me to let you into the garden?”
“It’s Theodore,” Harry corrected automatically.
“Couldn’t go two sentences without bringing him up,” Hermione chipped in.
Luna laughed as well, “I think she might be hungry now, actually.”
“Not a thing,” agreed Malfoy. “All secure.”
“Plenty of practise,” said Harry rather grimly.
Harry let go of Malfoy, “Just a little precaution, but we’ve finished now. Nothing to worry about.”
“Fickle?” Harry repeated.
Draco crouched down on his front and covered his eyes with his paws obligingly.
There was a spicy, earthy smell in the air, and Hagrid’s pumpkin patch was full of nearly ripe pumpkins. Just as Harry turned up the path, it began to rain, and he pulled his robes up over his head and ran the last few yards. Just beyond Hagrid’s cabin was a slightly smaller one with a patch of dirigible plums thriving in the front garden. Harry splashed up to the door and chapped it.
“I don’t mind you asking me questions about being gay, Theodore,” Draco said kindly. “You haven’t offended me. But Harry’s right about it being usually something you let people tell you on their own. You might want to be a bit careful in future. People can get quite upset when they have to talk about that before they’re ready to, and sometimes it can be. Unsafe for them. All right?”
“I haven’t seen Greg in years, actually. My best mate’s name is Astoria. Astoria Greengrass. She was in my house, but the year below us. You’ll like her. She’s always been much more decent than me. She helped me get my head together after the war.”
“I really am. I know I was. An idiot.”
“What are you going to do with them?” Theodore asked curiously, as they all trooped down to the sitting room.
Harry shrugged, “That’s not terrible. Politer than half my fan mail, so long as you didn’t also send along a love potion or a lock of your hair or dirty knickers.”
“Yes, Theo?”
“In the rear dining room,” he said meaningly.
They went to Ollivander’s next for Theo’s wand, and Harry suddenly remembered Dean Thomas had apprenticed with him when they found Dean behind the counter.
“Exactly,” Harry nodded. “That’s it exactly. And sometimes, people consider it a bit private, and they want to decide for themselves who they talk to about it, so if you ask, they don’t get to pick their own moments, and it can make them feel uncomfortable. Does that make sense?”
“Yeah, we get on. That’s not the problem.”
Harry opened his mouth to point out that Malfoy had not officially been engaged yet, but Theo lit up at the words.
“And then Harry was the school hero over and over, and I was incredibly jealous that he was so brave and talented and so admired and that I could never show him up.”
“You never did tell me where we’re going to eat,” Harry prompted.
Theodore sighed bravely. “I’ve decided to go by Theodore, Aunt Molly,” he announced as he stepped into the green flames of the Floo.
“Oh yes, Theo. Theodore. I do remember something about that now. I’m sorry, dear.”
“Oh,” Harry tried to tuck himself against Draco’s shoulder without interrupting the activity in his hair. “Is that what’s upsetting you?”
“You’re so. Huge. Sometimes it’s like dating the sun.”
“I know.” Harry grinned and tried to hide it in his collar and grinned more.
Harry sighed, “There was a boggart in his cupboard. Theodore’s. It came out last night and scared the living daylights out of him.”
“That’s great, Hagrid,” Harry helped himself to tea. The pot was wrapped in one of Molly Weasley’s magical tea cozies, and the steam that rose off the tea was thick and stung his eyes.
“Maybe I am,” Ginny turned a cunning look on Harry. “Are you hungry, Harry? Maybe been daydreaming about a lovely blond potato?” She grabbed for the biscuit tin in the centre of the table anyway.
Harry grinned, “Go on, then.”
“Mate, don’t try it. I saw you with the Marauder’s map, watching him all night every night sixth year.”
Draco laughed, “Glad to hear you have such a positive attitude about it.”
“But if I don’t cook with my wand now, how’m I ever going to learn?” Theodore asked innocently.
“I’m relaxed,” Harry said defensively.
Harry and Theo both nodded.
“No, I don’t think I do.”
“You’re welcome. But you know you’re falling asleep already. You can hardly keep your eyes open.”
“Because,” Draco said soberly. “My family and I have not been very nice people. We’ve done a lot of things wrong, and lots of people we used to know don’t wish to know us anymore.”
Dean frowned a little, “Hmm, that’s unusual. It does happen, though. Sometimes the wand’ll sense a powerful affinity, and decide that’s as good as permission.”
Hagrid clapped him on the back appreciatively, knocking him right off his stool
“I mean I wanted to see Draco,” said Theo, tossing his cap after his book bag. “How did the cursebreaking go? Did you find any more monsters?”
Harry leaned against the worktop while he waited for the kettle and watched Malfoy slather his scone in strawberry jam, “You might have written to me.”
A young, pretty witch who introduced herself as Priti gave them a tour, showing them a hydroponic garden where the Centre grew herbs for brewing wolfsbane, sleeping draughts and pain potions, a seminar room where patients learned first aid spells and how to brew sleep and pain potions and even wolfsbane brewing courses for patients with at least five years potioneering study, a nook full of bookshelves that Priti called the resource library, and a handful of rooms at the very back for individual, family, and group counseling. Theodore was rather quiet and looked about him with wide eyes, but Harry asked lots of questions.
Harry scrubbed his hand through his hair, “Are you upset?”
Theodore looked wide eyed at Harry, “Really?”
“Don’t I look ready?” Draco stepped out and shut the door behind him.
Ginny bit into a ginger nut with relish, “Both!”
“Great. See you then.”
“Oh are we finished with the seduction bit already?” Harry asked as Draco shoved away the blanket and shed his own pyjamas.
Theodore pushed the tapes about on the floor, “Maybe something scary?”
“It vibrates when it detects Dark spells or objects. There’s something quite seriously cursed in here. Please tell me you haven’t been using the room regularly.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “Really?”
Ron nodded, “Right, Theodore. Does that have anything to do with why your face is like that? It’s a nice name and it isn’t yours anyway, so I hope not.”
“Ah, you’re awake.”
“Well I hope we sort it out, because I’d love to read a wizarding novel I didn’t write. Or see a play. I’d love to see a wizarding play, wouldn’t you? A story acted out on a stage. I really think our lack of artistic expression stunts our thinking and our ability to fully relate to one another and see into lives and minds and hearts that are not our own. I think we’re much the worse for it as individuals and as a society. It’s really quite sad. How could I not want to sort of. Lean into that void a bit and maybe try and get some other people to come with me?”
“Personal protective equipment.”
“What?” Theo looked blank. He’d been very focused on Twinkle since they got her and Harry had interrupted him cooing to the cat about teaching her how to fight boggarts.
The audience rose in a standing ovation during the bows, and instead of filing out with everyone else when the house lights came up, Draco sank back down into his seat and surreptitiously Conjured a handkerchief to wipe his tear-sticky face.
“Boyfriend,” Luna said encouragingly, as if Harry had only forgotten the right word.
“Even? How do you reckon?”
Harry felt strongly that if he didn’t leave quickly, he’d make some sort of unseemly sound of surprise and hilarity, “We’ll tell him you said hello. Come on, Theo.”
Theodore had gone back to gazing about him, his eyes wide, “Should I get a rabbit, then?”
Harry baked scones, and Draco gobbled up half the batch in about five minutes, then looked longingly at the pantry again. After a little trial and error, Harry offered him the last of the steak off the cold shelf, and Draco et it raw and with great relish.
Draco withdrew his hand from Harry’s arm slowly with a curious expression as if he were checking himself, “I’m sure you will, Theodore. Very responsible of you.”
“If you’re a pixie,” Malfoy said lightly. “They eat pixies or mice and bats if they can’t get pixies.”
Harry snorted, “You always were a terrible liar.”
“I’m not-”
“Of course,” Draco said. “Do you know how to get to the platform, Theodore?”
“No, you’d only be taking it back to humour me, and that’s even more gracious. It’s worse.”
Theo took the wand and promptly set the till on fire.
“He swore up and down that he was just there to do a job, and he didn’t even know it was my house.”
“See that you do!”
“I know. Thanks.”
“Well I think it’s brilliant,” said Dudley staunchly. “Having a big family,” he raised his bottle of butterbeer like he was making a toast, and they all followed suit and drank.
Harry gave him a little nudge, “Something like that, but stop making me laugh or I’ll never get through it.”
Harry cleared his throat, “Any last questions?”
Ginny shrugged, “Most people wouldn’t be thrilled about their fiance leaving them for someone else.”
“Excellent. I wanted you to know that I’ve checked over the house, and there isn’t anything Dark or dangerous left in it, so you’ve nothing to worry about in future. Nothing here is going to hurt you.”
“I. Am trying to be er. Measured and responsible. Which is a bit new for me, because I’m used to just doing things as soon as I notice I want to.”
Draco laughed, “I mean you look nice in the shirt I gave you for Christmas.”
Harry was very taken aback, as he hadn’t realised Theodore recognised Draco, but he was saved from making a proper answer when Theo’s Portkey began to glow. He handed Theodore his bookbag and his hat and had only time for a hasty goodbye, before Theo touched his finger to the Portkey and vanished.
“Did you catch any more monsters today? Can I see them?”
Theodore lit up in sudden comprehension, “Cut the portrait out of the frame!”
“Can you use your words, Theo? I don’t know what you mean by that. Yes, it’s packed?”
“I don’t suggest you set fire to anything inside your house. Nor anything out of it,” Draco added hastily. “Not unless it’s in a fireplace or something, and you must certainly have your godfather’s permission first. No, although if you did set fire to the portrait, it certainly wouldn’t be on the wall anymore. You have me there. But what we’re going to do is,” Draco held up the knife he’d shown them before.
Theodore’s expression flickered as if that were a very clever idea that he hadn’t thought of before, but his friend Ara stuck her head out of the nearest window and yelled, “Theeeeeodoooore! Come on before the train goes! I’ve got a compartment with Rus and Monica and Katie, and there’s still room for you!”
“Sorry, am I being an arsehole? I didn’t mean to embarrass you.”
Draco made another of his jerky nods.
Harry and Draco watched the train out of sight. When it was gone, Harry took a long draught of hot chocolate. It did make him feel better, but he was also beginning to notice that the other parents lingering on the platform were whispering and nudging each other and pointing covertly at him.
Harry cleared his throat, “It was a long time ago. Before you were born, Theo.”
Harry was quite touched. He hadn’t seen much of either of them since Hogwarts, though he’d been fond of them both at school, “Of course I’ll come.”
“Well, that’s just the thing. If it was only me, I would have already. Well. I might’ve. You know. But it’s not just me. I’ve got to think of Theodore as well. He needs a stable family more than I need a,” Harry trailed off.
Harry glanced about him to see if Theo was in eavesdropping range, but judging by the distant shouts, Theo was still trying to have a game of one on one quidditch with Victoire in a neighbouring field.
When Harry unlocked Regulus’ room and let Malfoy into it, he made a little hum of surprise and dismay.
“I suppose that will have to do,”
“One plate is for you and the other is for me,” Harry said with a laugh as he sat down on the edge of Draco’s bed. “But I can fix you some more if you’re still hungry when you’ve finished, or you can have the last of the scones.”
“Like a sort of sympathy,” Dean explained. “Or attraction.”
“So’m I,” said Ron.
Malfoy smiled, a warm genuine smile that Harry had never seen before. It changed his whole aspect, “Hello there.”
“Under me,” Draco pressed him flat on his back. “Where I can look at you.”
Draco squeezed back, “Ah, Potter?”
“It’s all right,” said Theo politely, but he still looked a bit hurt.
“That was some very quick thinking, Potter,” said Malfoy in a faint voice. Then he slipped forward out of his chair, and his head lolled toward his knees in a swoon.
After outfitting Theodore for Hogwarts at Madam Malkin’s and the apothecary, and a very brief stop at Quality Quidditch Supplies, where Harry told Theo that he would not be getting a broomstick, as he wasn’t allowed to have one yet at school, they finished their shopping expedition at Eyelops.
“I didn’t mean to be rude!”
“What was he like?”
When Theodore had finished with his water, Harry rose from the bed, “Come on, I think we need a little change of venue for the night.” Theodore got up and followed Harry obediently  out of the room. Harry paused in the corridor to shoot a Silencing Charm at Mrs Black’s portrait before they went on down to the kitchen.
Harry was surprised when Draco rang his doorbell to collect him for their outing instead of coming through the Floo.
Harry shrugged, “Well. Who’s gonna stop them?”
“Fun, really?”
“That’s why he looks so familiar, isn’t it? He’s my cousin, Draco? I know him from Granny’s photos. If you let me borrow Godric, I could write to him. You would, wouldn’t you?”
Draco fell asleep after the film ended, and after several very pleasant minutes of being softly snored against by Draco and death-glared at by Shadowfax, Harry very gently extricated himself and got up. He went out on the stoop to watch the sunset, just for a breath of fresh air. He could still smell Draco on his clothes, even out in the open, and it made him smile.
“Mind you keep hold of that,” Harry advised, nodding at Theo’s breakfast. As an inveterate dawdler, Theodore had missed most of breakfast, but Molly had held back enough bacon and toast to make him a bacon sandwich for the walk to school from his Port point.
Ron gave him a friendly slap on the back, “Rosie likes me to walk her so she can chat to me. I think if she isn’t continually talking, her head might fall off.”
Malfoy pressed his hand, “We can handle it.” He seemed to think better of it, “But it isn’t your job; it’s my job. If you’d rather not come in after we take the ward down-”
Harry laughed, “Are you teasing me?”
Draco didn’t let go of Harry straight away, “Would you stay with me tonight? Sleep here? I really want to be with you tonight.”
Harry screwed up his face and started drawing long breaths in through his nose, then looked up at Draco, “I have to see them all. Responding. All at once. It’s not like that with books. I have to watch them forming their impressions right in front of me.”
Harry tossed a pinch of Floo powder into the cold fireplace, and immediately a cheerful green fire blazed up in the grate.
Shadowfax followed Draco out of the room, and while they were gone, Harry lit the lamps with his wand. Draco returned presently, barefoot, and with his pale hair loose to his shoulders. He was wrapped in a blue silk paisley dressing gown, so sumptuous looking that Harry thought it must have come from his Malfoy family fortune days. Draco regained his seat, and Shadowfax sprang into his lap.
“Have you had a good summer, my dear? Are you ready for school to begin? You must be nervous.”
“When you say you’re not going to talk about Harry Potter, you mean the Harry Potter persona? The Chosen One? The Boy Who Lived? Are you still chafing under it? I imagine you find it a bit wearing, but you must have the urge to correct it or at least update it. Get yourself out from under it?”
On the second day of Theodore’s visit to Shell Cottage, in flagrant defiance of his editor, and as he had written a fairly solid number of pages the day before, Harry decided to pay a visit of his own. There had been something preying on his mind for some time, and it had only gotten louder since his trip to Diagon Alley with Draco and Theodore.
Harry cleared his throat, “One to start, please.”
“Were you r-Malfoy!”
Harry swallowed and shook his head, “But I. What if I muck it up somehow? Theodore really does need D-Draco more than I do. And if it doesn’t work out and Draco doesn’t want to be around us anymore? He’d be devastated.”
“All right, then. Put your head down again. You’re in my light.” Draco obeyed and Harry opened the book and flipped back to the beginning. “This is another muggle book. More novels, ha. It’s called
“Sorry.”
“My complaints are dwindling,” Draco said, eyeing the tray eagerly. “That’s for me?”
Harry balked, and something in his expression seemed to annoy Malfoy.
“No! I mean. I don’t know. Not any time soon. We haven’t been. It’s still quite new.”
Harry pet Draco’s back while he thought about it, “You’d help me with lycanthropy stuff?”
“Er. I’m not sure. He told me it’s okay to be gay and patted me on the arm.”
“Well houses have names. Like the Weasleys have The Burrow and Victoire’s house is called Shell Cottage, and Draco when you were a kid, your house had a name as well.”
“Oh yes, of course. We’ve just been sorting out what Theodore needs for the morning. Go on Theo; I’m just behind you with your school bag and your
Draco went a little pink, but he nodded, “Exactly. You’re not alone. And you still get to be a whole person, and there will still be people who can see that, even if it isn’t every single person you meet.”
Draco smiled, “Bigger than you expected?”
Harry groaned, “You saw that, did you?”
“Right, so. I’ve got to be careful. Because it isn’t just me I’m concerned with, because Theodore is my main responsibility at the moment, and he needs a safe and stable and comfortable life more than I need to. Helter.”
“Wow, congratulations!” said Kal, popping up again for another high five. “I finished at Hogwarts a couple of years ago. You must be really excited!”
H. Potter
“This is brilliant magic,” Harry looked around eagerly, scanning again for the musicians. “That’s really thoughtful of you,” he turned his gaze back to Draco. “Thank you for bringing me here.”
Harry followed Malfoy back into the corridor before he asked, “PPE?”
“Bear it?”
“Ah well, we can be a bit stupid in love,” Hagrid interjected a bit gruffly. “Least said, soonest-”
“But you’re the most important person to both of us,” Harry said hastily. “And er. Nothing’s ever going to change that. Okay?”
“Little menace,” Draco said fondly, scraping her off his shoulder and turning her onto her back in the crook of his elbow, “I should have warned him about you, and then he wouldn’t think you’re doing that to be nice.” Shadowfax hugged and kicked his arm with evident affection.
“Oh,” Harry tried to remember an Astoria. “Helped you get your head together? Was she your-”
“They shouldn’t have left you.”
Harry folded his arms, “Whenever you’re through. I’ll wait.”
Luna returned to the table, dragging a stool for Harry, “I think we have a couple of rock cakes leftover from tea yesterday.”
“Same thing this time,” Malfoy murmured when they’d joined hands in front of Regulus’ door. “But this time when you feel the ward, release it.”
“It’s funny seeing you do that,” Draco said when Theodore had left the room.
“Aunt Ginny told me ages ago, like when I was nine,” Theodore said wisely. “Does it mean anything else?”
not going to act like we are,” he laid very pointed emphasis on I’m. “I’m not here to intrude on you or my cousin or to convince him to start doing in muggleborns or whatever it is you were just shouting about. I’m here to do a job that I’ve been asked to do, and that I’m damn good at. I’d be very pleased to help provide my cousin with a safe and comfortable place to live, but I’m not going to beg you to let me do it.”
Draco burst out laughing, “Yes, it was terribly childish. I might have made better decisions if I’d had a friend like you, steering me right.”
Draco sighed, “And you’re hopelessly ahead now.”
Draco frowned, “Sometimes? How will I know when sometimes is?”
“I think I might be an integrationist now,” Draco remarked over drinks one drizzly November evening.
Draco looked rather shocked, then laughed, “You’re still teasing me, aren’t you?”
He smiled when Harry came in, “There you are.”
“No trouble at all,” answered the cursebreaker in a cool, familiar voice that made the hair stand up on the back of Harry’s neck. The cursebreaker stepped forward, waving away the smoke that had built up in the Floo during Harry’s delayed answer and it was Draco Malfoy.
“Hello Theodore, I hope your day at school was satisfactory.”
“Well, I’ve promised myself I’m not going to talk about Harry Potter, so I’m afraid I can’t satisfy your intrigue on that point.”
“Well, it’s my responsibility, isn’t it?”
“Not as such,” Malfoy agreed. He stood up, “Shall we get on with it?”
“We could play hide and seek,” Harry suggested. “I’ll be It first, if you like and you can hide.”
And Harry clasped Draco to him, kissed back gratefully when their mouths met, dragged his hands over every bit of Draco’s skin he could reach.
“Right, I know what the word means, but I’m really stupid with fucking at the moment, so you’ll have to just say what you want.”
“Harry was obsessed with him,” Ron added.
“Inside my bag, there’ll be a pouch. Check the pouch. There should be a flask for a Strengthening Solution and a pain potion. And I’ll need to eat something.”
“Not exactly,” Draco said after a moment. “At first I desperately wanted Harry to like me, but he rumbled at once that I was a completely horrible, spoiled little tick, and he didn’t like me at all, no matter what I did. It didn’t occur to me to try and be nice, so I mainly showed off as hard as possible and made a lot of very unpleasant jokes and was generally foul and a complete nuisance.”
“Fine, I’ll stay. Thank you for asking.”
Draco took the water gratefully and gulped, “You’ll be in front of the Wizengamot on Statute of Secrecy charges if you’re not more careful, Harry. You didn’t even check if we’re alone.”
Harry laughed, “Well he deflated his head a bit after leaving school. But I mean, he was handsome and funny and clever and loud, and like. Pathologically game for a laugh. And spoiled and rude and a bit er. Full of himself. No offence.”
“Shall we carry on with the assessment, then?”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up toward his hairline, “But you were fond of him?”
Draco shook his head and answered around his mouthful of pie, “‘ll’ve a drdfl hngvr ‘f do. Dsnt mx w wlfsbn.”
“You know I’m trying to hear what Harry has to say, and you two keep annoying him,” Dudley said mildly, helping himself to some of the raspberry fool.
Draco pushed his face into Harry’s book with a huff.
“Absolutely,” said Malfoy, giving the box a sharp jab with his wand. “I’ll need to put a protective charm on it before transporting it.”
“I shall hold you to that strenuously. I don’t suppose you’d be willing to tell me what this one is about?”
“Hi Luna. It’s raining out.”
“Beards?” Harry rubbed his chin. “Really?”
Ron considered, “Well, you know Andromeda was never very keen on Remus, if you believe Mum. I think she’s probably sort of in denial about Te-er Theodore.”
Draco smirked, “Sure. Lead the way.”
They ate a very scrumptious and luxurious dinner in a muggle tapas restaurant, then went on to the play. Though they’d read the play before the holidays to prepare themselves, they were both riveted by the performance. There was something thrilling about being so united in their feelings, not only with each other, but with the rest of the audience and the cast as well.
“Hagrid?” suggested Ron. “He’d love collecting everyone’s monsters.”
“Of course we can. Will you come through now?”
Theo’s face sort of flickered, and he tried to smile, “I sort of knew you from Granny’s photos. Did you know me? I suppose you haven’t seen me since I was small?” He grew his hair out all in a moment til it was long and blond like Draco’s, as if he thought that might help with the recognition, then seemed to think better of it and changed it back to its naturally mousy colour.
“It makes you like your dad,” Harry added, having found his voice. “And he was one of the kindest, cleverest people Hogwarts ever saw.”
‘“It’s Theodore now, Granny,” Theodore said. “Remember I told you last time?”
Theodore glanced at Harry, and Harry nodded, “Go on. If you want to. It isn’t dangerous.”
“That wasn’t your fault,” said Ron quickly. “You just missed it.”
“Of course, he has” Draco smiled at the floor. “I’ll join, I suppose” He tried to look posh looking back at this mother like she didn’t just see him smiling down at the floor when she mentioned that Teddy missed him. “Something else?” He asked.
“I think this will do it actually” Hermione answered and the girl, whose’s name tag said Sabrina helped them check out.
“Hi” Potter greeted him as he came out to the store, glass still in his hand.
-15th of February-
"This has surpassed the bro level," - Harry Potter
“It means,” She looks around nervously before starting to lead Harry away from the door as well as the crowd. “I’m,” she takes a deep breath “I’m pregnant” Harry stopped, mouth agape as he stares at her. “But-” he stuttered, having problems with actually forming a sentence.
*****
Harry feeling like this moment between his best friends is to private to watch turns away- to look at Malfoy and his friends. They had stood up to leave now, at the time Harry looked over they were halfway over to them, it seemed Malfoy was waiting for Blaise Zabini to pay for them at the cashier and was currently watching the Ron and Hermione moment happen.
I'm sorry
“Remember when I told you that my brother died at age 16 in a horrible accident?” Draco nodded. “His name was Colin, he was-” Sabrina put the back of her hand to her forehead and sniffed a little bit before taking a deep breath. “He was magic. Just like you people seem to be, he died in a battle at his school, a battle Draco! He was a little kid, he shouldn’t have-” Sabrina shipped after air and tears started to roll down her cheeks, Draco stood from his desk and walked over to where Sabrina was sitting on the couch. He sighs beside her before taking her hand in his and after a couple of seconds, Pansy held Sabrina’s other hand. “Your brother, he, he didn’t die in vain Sabrina,” Sabrina nodded tears streaming down her face. “He wasn’t, he wasn’t supposed to be there, he was underage and-” Sabrina couldn’t finish. “And he was expelled for being muggle-born,” Draco whispered beside her, Sabrina nodded.
Harry took his boots and coat in arms and backpack on his back and stopped in front of Draco, a big smile on his lips, “So you’re coming through my house then,” Draco nodded and walked back into the living room. “Their fireplace is quite spacious, but I’m afraid mine isn’t so we can’t go at the same time,” Draco threw some floo powder in to make the floo network activate. “What did you name your house?” Harry asks, “Well, ‘Malfoy apartment’” Draco said not looking up at him. “You go first, to make sure you get there,” Draco stood and gestured for Harry to get in the fireplace. “I’ve only used the floo, like for real, once before,” Harry said nervously, “And it went horribly wrong I’m guessing,”  Draco said, teasing.
“Does it mean anything in particular?” He asked, but she started to walk down the stairs, “Well,” She stopped, “It can, but thinking that they were in Knockturn alley, or that’s what he says anyway, we can’t know for sure, he can just be returning them to their right place but then again…” She cupped her chin and looked at him in wonder, “Draco Malfoy is a strange man,” She concluded and walked down the rest of the stairs. “Wait,” Harry rushed down the stairs to where Ginny had stopped at the end of them, “Does the Weasleys have one?” Ginny crossed her arms and nodded, “Well, first of all we have two, just like you,” Ginny sassed and Harry rolled his eyes, “but dad’s the youngest of three boys so there’s no way for even Bill to get it,” Harry nodded, “The stone is kind of orange,” Ginny said in thought and lifted her hair, “I wonder why,” which made them both laugh and together they walked to the living room and joined the others again.
. He couldn’t breathe. His parents had been wearing these. And Draco found them, for him.
“No, no he’s fine Ron” Hermione argued. “Would you just go out to the car for a bit alone darling?” Hermione gestured to Ron and the door. “Why?”
“Oh really?”
After collecting himself and he walked out of the ‘employees only’ door to see Draco, fully clothed in outerwear leaning against the wall, clearly waiting for him. “Your friend said you’d come out this door,” he explained himself and Harry smiled at him, “You mean my co-worker?” Draco shrugged, “should be about the same thing,” they walked out together, with no real destination, “Where are we headed?” Harry asked when Draco turned a sharp corner. “Lunch,” Harry nodded along and pretended he knew where they were.
They weren’t supposed to use that much flour but it had simply ended up everywhere, Teddy’s eyes were bright, flour on his nose, he’d smacked Draco’s cheek, his hand full of flour and Draco couldn’t do else but roll his eyes at while Teddy giggled mischievously. While the cake cooled Draco ran him a bath so they could get all the flour out of Teddy’s hair, Teddy hadn’t helped, laughing while changing his hair colour to the same as flour, looking up, trying to see his hair in excitement, only to make Draco sigh while laughing tiredly. They made an easy dinner and Teddy ate before demanding he could eat the cake. They ate the cake and Draco put Teddy to bed. He’d read him a story, Teddy fitting just right against his chest so that he could read with him slowly. Draco tugged him a sleeping Teddy around 20:30, his hair now his natural curly brown and Draco ran his fingers through it,
After he’d grabbed his wand he started the fire to floo over to Andromeda, he was supposed to be there at 16:00 and he was determined to not be too early. He arrived 15:59 to Andromeda with her shoes on in the hallway, “awfully sorry,” he said, dusting himself off. “It’s fine, the clock hasn’t struck-” but the grandpa clock rang at that, Andromeda looked towards it, “you’re just on time,” she said when the clock was done ringing, “Teddy is in his room, I’ll be back around nine, do you think you can put him to bed?” Draco nodded, “I’ll do my best, at eight, right?” Andromeda put her wand in the wand pocket of her coat, “that’s right,” she hugged Draco then, it felt weird, stiff in a way, but he hugged her back, “I’ll see you around,” she cupped his cheek before walking over to the stairs in order to say goodbye to Teddy who came jumping down the stairs.
It's valentines day folks! Or the next one is... In the meantime, enjoy a date in disguise.
Potter nodded as well as he could from the angle that his neck was currently in. “Here’s a weird impulse…” Potter started.
Deciding to look for Draco he ventures out on the dance floor, not really feeling for dancing anymore, he never really did in the first place. It was mostly because Draco wanted to that he went to this party in the first place. He looks around if he walks just a meter or so he’ll be met by dancing, or more like jumping bodies, he braced for it and walked through the barrier of people, walking towards the sofa in the corner. He saw Parkinson there, sitting on top of some other guy’s lap and decided to sit down next to them, “hiya,” he almost screamed in her direction, she raised her eyebrow but screamed “hello,” back, “you seem lost,” she says pointing at him, still sitting on the other man’s lap. “I lost Draco, so yeah, I am,” Parkinson giggled a little at that, “famous Potter, spending time with Draco Malfoy on valentine’s day huh,” Harry felt like he should argue, because this isn’t spending time, it’s the last thing it is really, but he simply shrugged. “It’s either that or spend time alone in my apartment and I think this is better to be honest.” beside him Parkinson nodded and took a shug of her drink. “Y’know,” she clicked her tongue and leaned closer to him, “you can have ANYBODY you want, wizard or not. Draco can’t,” Harry raised his eyebrows, “why not?” Parkinson rolled her eyes at him, “his family name mate, his family name and all the things it represents, and listen to this,” she continues. “If you hurt him, and I mean this, I don’t care if the evilest wizard ever wasn’t able to kill you because I will,”
But it was like he saw Draco Malfoy everywhere he went, to the club, when he was working, when he was out on walks, he was everywhere. Sometimes it wasn’t even his face that he recognised. Sometimes it was just the hair. He remembers when he first saw him in the club one night two months ago. It was a muggle club so it didn’t make sense of him being there.
“Students are exhausting,” Neville said, standing up to get another beer. “Promise me one thing Harry,” Neville said, sitting down again, Harry nodded for Neville to go on, “never become a professor,” Harry shrugged, “Listen, I get asked about the snake thing constantly after class it’s become a personality trait,” the rest of them laughed at that, Neville huffing, crossing his arms. “Got it,” Harry smiled,
He walked over to the little package that Draco had given him them in. It was still heavy. Harry realised, there must be another. Otherwise, Narcissa couldn’t be wearing an identical stone to Draco’s. He lifted the silk that surrounded them and indeed, there was another one, glaring up at him just as cruelly as the other one had, he picked it up and immediately read the bottom line:
It is so weird to write about winter in the middle of summer, y'all have no idea.
Harry
“Coming to the café today Draco?” Sabrina asked as they walked out from their last lecture of the day. “No thanks, I’m going to my mum’s again today” He answered as he put on his winter coat and Sabrina raised her eyebrow slightly. “But what about that cute barista you can’t keep your eyes off?”
“So, where do you wanna eat?”
“For.. another 10 minutes, yes” He sighed into the phone as he glanced towards the clock. Meanwhile, Hermione gave a hm. “Aaand when you do get out of work?” and Harry, catching onto something immediately fills himself with, probably unnecessary, worry “Has something happened?” He asks her. “No, no, mum everything's fine” She nervously laughs and he hears a door shut in the distance.
“Yep”
*****
He remembers being 17 years old, he remembers Hagrid carrying a dead Harry Potter in his arms and Voldemort’s army march towards the fallen castle. He remembers the battle so clearly, it could’ve been yesterday. He remembers the feeling of relief when Potter turns out to not be dead. Because maybe hope wasn’t lost.
Harry is on his short lunch break when Hermione calls “Hello?” Harry says as he answers the phone. “Oh thank god! Are you on break?” Hermione’s voice clung in excitement on the other side of the call, like back in first year when she’d found a really good book and has raced to tell him and Ron about it. Despite knowing that they’d probably wouldn’t care.
But then look forward to, hopefully (no promises), more regular update schedule or some shit like that I don't even know at this point. I'll try to work around it, have with your day, go to bed if you're reading this in the middle of the night. Please take care of yourself, assumed human, the world loves ya, okay that sounds cringe... Goodbye.
“Told me Teddy had missed cousin Draco very, very much” His mother smirked at him as Draco glared at her.
“It’s, it’s me, Sabrina, I know you’re going to hate me now and I totally deserve it just, I hope you forgive me one day.”
It's just, school. I have national tests to worry about.
“You wouldn’t, would you?”
So what Harry hoped Draco would walk into the café without warning his entire shift, of course, he wouldn’t. So what if Harry no longer felt like going to the pub with the boys, just wanting to go back to Draco’s flat to watch Netflix on the couch? Not. Gay.
Harry stared at it for a second before averting his eyes. They paid and set off back to the university campus.
And now, he was out eating dinner with Hermione and Ron and Malfoy was with his friends on the other side of the restaurant.
. They got married the year before he was born, and in mid-war. Harry thought as he stroke his finger over his father’s name. Above it, it read:
“Is it okay if I stay the night? I dunno when the trains go and I don’t have my wand with me so I can’t apparate.” Andromeda hmed back, “Why don’t you just go with Harry then? Of course, I’d love to have you but, muggle trains seems like a lot of work when you’ve drunk an entire bottle of wine,” Draco sighed “Do you mind?” He asked Potter who was about to open the door but stopped abruptly. “No, not at all,” He stepped in again as Draco put on his boots and jacket, said goodbye to his aunt and they were out the door. “Why don’t you bring your wand with you, I’m not against it, of course, I’m just curious.” Draco blew out some air creating a cloud of smoke in the cold air. “I came directly from school, didn’t have time to pick it up on the way” He answered easily and Potter nodded. “Should I apparate you directly into your apartment or outside or?” Draco rolled his eyes at the question. “Just aparate to outside your apartment or something, I think we live in the same neighbourhood.” Potter nodded, they fell silent after that. They just walked alongside each other until they reached the apparition spot when Draco grabbed Potter arm and he apparated them outside his apartment building. “Thanks,” Draco said as he let go of Potter, and started to walk away. Behind him, Potter smiled a little smile before entering his own apartment.
I wanted to come on here and thank you all, every read, comment, bookmark and kudos reminds me of how lucky I am to have you all. I am incredibly grateful for every single one.
“What do you want to watch?” Harry said, on his way to dig out his computer from his bag and take up Netflix.
“Mother still gives me very expensive Christmas presents though”
“They had to see where you’d end up?” Draco rolled his eyes, “Maybe that’s part of it.” Harry raised an eyebrow, “So, where’s the Malfoy family in this?” Draco shrugged again, “I didn’t include it.” Draco closed the folder and put it back in his bag, not looking at Harry. “Well, what’s the book called?” Harry urged, interested in reading said book, Draco glared at him, “Britain's magical families, past and present,” he muttered and Harry made a mental note. “Thanks, buddy,” He patted Draco on the shoulder and stood up, “I’ll pay, when does your next lecture start?” Harry watched Draco look down on his phone and make a face, “In 45 minutes,” Draco said and stood up as well, putting his phone down on the table and reached for his coat, that second a message popped up and Harry couldn’t help but read:
The Malfoy family first came to Britain with William the Conqueror and were awarded land in Wiltshire after rendering unknown, but shady and most likely magical services for King William I.
After what felt like a half an hour everyone settled down again, Ron now with a protective arm around Hermione, “two then,” Molly concluded happily looking between Aubrey and Hermione, “How long have you known?” Ginny asks, now very interested, “I’ve known since early November” Hermione said with ease before looking up at Ron, “Well, Hermione is a little shit and kept it from me for a month,” Ron said grumpily, “So I didn’t know until early December,” He concluded looking around, “Sorry,” Hermione said quietly to Ron, “No problem, love,” Ron whispered back and turned back to the family, “And in case you all are wondering we made Harry godfather,” Ron turned to him and Harry smiled back at him,
Grabbing a biscuit and his book together with his tea he walked back to his bedroom, Harry was still fast asleep when he settled at his side, draping the cover over him opening the book at the bookmark, Harry murmuring something in his sleep, “what was that?” Draco asked in bemusement and to his slight horror, Harry’s eyes opened. “What?” he asked sleepily before yawning big,
“huh,” Harry said walking to his desk grabbing some paper and writing a short note saying he’d love to and will be over to 14:00, using the same envelope Luna had used, just erasing her writing and replacing it with his own. He sent it off with the owl and looked over at the clock, 6:50, “fuck,” Harry swore, he had the morning shift, which started in ten minutes, sometimes magic is good, Harry decided when he found a hangover potion laying around and a few refreshing spells he apparated himself into an alley the corner around work, practically ran in, his coworker had already started the work thankfully, “sorry I’m late,” he told her and she waved her hand, “you’re taking the goods and machines because of that,” she winked and Harry smiled, “oh fuck off,” he told her playfully, grabbing a bun and walking over to the locker room.
Harry carefully placed the coffee mug beside Draco’s books, Harry smiled, “It’s on the house,” Draco glared, “If you give me free drinks how am I supposed to use up that gift card you gave me?” Harry shrugged, “You can go to a different café, or not come in stressed as you did just now,” From somewhere Harry fished up a wet cloth and started wiping down the counter. “Then why give me free drinks?” Draco repeated, Harry, still wiping the counter, smiled and then shrugged. Without looking up at Draco he said: “To make you come back?” Draco’s mind stilled for just a moment before straightening himself up and remembering he had work to do.
“I’ll go home and tell him now,” Hermione said, carefully putting the book down in her bag before taking a deep breath “Wish me luck” She hugged Harry goodbye to walk towards the actual apparition spot.
“And if it’s just a friend crush, why are you feeling like this? Why are you beating yourself up about this?” - Ronald Weasley.
“Draco?” Harry asked, not letting his eyes leave Draco. “Yes?” Draco looked up, “What happened to your dad?” He saw Draco still and his smile falling from his face, Draco looked down to his hands, before shaking his head at Harry, symbolling him not to bring it up. And Harry moved closer and bravely but his arm around Draco and told him, “Sorry,” in the gentlest voice he could manage, feeling heart sinking even more as Draco shot him a sad smile back.
“Oh I’m not surprised at all,” Potter said sarcastically and laughed.
“Because I talk to him?” Hermione said in confusion.
Andromeda came out and served the dinner and the boys fell silent and kept to just glance at each other when the other wasn’t looking. Harry felt the room getting hotter by the minute, maybe it was the good food, maybe it was the company, either way, excuse his French, holy shit.
Harry took a deep breath before pulling the silver chain over his head and laying it in his hand, “Do you know what this is?” Ginny put her head on the side, studying it, “It looks like a family stone, of some sort, why?”
When they went inside they met up with the rest of their friends, Draco walking up to Kevin, grabbing him by the arm and whispering “My medicine isn’t out yet, can you share your notes with me?” and pulled away, “Yeah, sure,” Kevin said and they walked together into the lecture hall.
“Am I allowed to take his place?” He asked the remaining crowd who made place so he could sit down. “How are you?” He whispered to Hermione which he now sat next to, she gave him a weak thumbs-up, “I’m puking all the time and my feet are extremely swollen but what’s new,” She whispered back. “Do the other’s know?” He said, still whispering, Hermione shakes her head in response.
Harry took off the stone to study it further, “But how did you know this was the right one?” he asked running his thumb over the cold stone, “There’s this book that I happened to find in the library at the manor, it said so,” Harry nodded, “But also…” Harry looked up to see Draco innocently biting his lip, “Turn it over,”
“Well, before you dated Ginny and then you dated-” Harry burped Seamus name and pointed to him, “who’d that work?” the conversation had gotten serious now, Harry could tell, Seamus had climbed of off Dean’s lap. “Well I’m bisexual, thought that was obvious,” Dean said, he sounded nervous, “I don’t know how it works, I kind of just like the person, it doesn’t matter if they’re a girl or a guy y’know,” Dean shrugged, besides him, Seamus looked uncomfortable, “listen if you have a problem-” Dean started,
“Accurate,” Ginny finished for him and they laughed.
, he thinks but complines. “I’ll get ready at home and come right back, alright?” Harry studies Draco and thinks that the invitation most likely comes from him being high off his sleeping meds.
Harry apparated them to Draco’s apartment, they stood there for about 3 seconds before Draco, gagging doubled over, letting go of Harry’s hand, “oh my god, are you-” Harry didn’t have time to finish his question before Draco puked all over his white rug. “Holy shit,” Harry signed softly before slowly patting Draco’s back in comfort, “I’m sorry,” Draco whispered and Harry hugged his from behind to the best of his ability since Draco was still hunched over. “It’s fine, let’s get you to bed,” Harry took out his wand, vanished the vomit and led Draco the bathroom, “you can fix yourself up, right?” Harry asks and Draco nodes, “Do you need anything?” Draco shrugged at him, “makeup wipes maybe but I think they’re in here,” Draco rises to stand from the toilet but almost falls down again if Harry hadn’t had quick reflexes. “Okay, so I’m gonna do that I think,” Harry concludes, sitting Draco down again “which cabinet?” Harry pointed towards the sink, “the right drawer,” Draco sighs. Harry find the makeup wipes and sits down on the bathtub beside the toilet, “alright, gimme your face,” Harry says and Draco leans closer, it takes Harry longer than it probably should’ve to clean Draco’s entire face which Draco later will blame on Harry being too goddamn gentle, but it’s Harry’s nature and he can’t help it.
And he was here, Draco smiled to himself. What Pansy said to him yesterday when they’d run into each other on his way to his bus stop. And it does hit him, he likes the bastard,
“So what was that?” Sabrina said, pointing at the fireplace where Pansy’s head had just disappeared. “Uh, magic?” Draco said though it sounded more like a question.
Draco mouthing along starting dancing and trying to get Harry to, when Harry then decided to not dance he dissed him and turned around to find his friends to dance with them instead, with the light on his face he danced and sang along with his friends, having the time of his life, for at least an hour before Pansy called out that it was close to midnight.
“But Draco and I aren’t together or anything,” Harry said, now defensively, “I’m not gay!” he exclaimed but Pansy just hm: ed and turned back to the guy whose lap she was still sitting on, “keep telling yourself that, tell him hi when you find him,” she waved as she dragged the guy towards the middle of the dancing floor.
Together they ate the cookies and cream ice cream before Pansy gave in and went to work, saying Draco can keep the other one and to do some school work, Draco had shoved her into the fireplace. Draco put the ice cream in the freezer and grabbed his computer. When the clock struck 15:30 Draco put it down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s a lot of Harry Potters out there you got to be more specific.” Draco turned back to his computer to quickly read through the paragraph he just wrote. “The magical one! Obviously!” Sabrina stretched out her arms in an attempt to make them understand. “Oh yeah, the saviour of the wizarding world?” Pansy snorted. “Quite a tosser, really” She then added. “Yeah, we were in the same year as him, he works as a barista in the café we go to all the time,” Draco turned back to them, adding to what Pansy had said. “Oh.” Sabrina’s posture suddenly became somewhat relaxed. “My brother did say there was a bully or ‘an annoying piece of ass’ as my brother called him, called Draco Malfoy in Harry’s year… So, Wait… You guys are… And you must be the mean girl who bullied the Granger girl…” She pointed at Pansy,
When Draco’s 8th year was completed and his magic was taken away, he tried to forget that part of his life, to start out new. But it’d always be a part of him.
“Malfoy’s going to University?” Harry suddenly spoke up making them all turn around to look at him. “Yes? I am?” Malfoy answered with a raised eyebrow. “As in?? Muggle university??” Malfoy leaned against the table Ron and Harry was sitting around, crossed his hands over his chest. “Something wrong with that?” He then asked and after having stared at Harry for a couple seconds Harry shook his head. “Suppose not” Harry crossed his arms and slid down on his own chair.
In the meantime, Draco grabbed his computer out of his bag and logged into the free wifi.
“Ron?”
*****
Uhhhhhh, party
, Harry realizes, “I’ll see you tomorrow then, Potter,” Draco waved and walked onto campus and Harry didn’t move until Draco had walked into a building,
“Did you? Just call me mum?” Harry laughs into the phone “I told them I called my mum, I’m in a separate room now, so,”
“I need your help to decide on something so I was wondering if... You’d like to go out shopping a little, yeah? Before you say anything, I know you hate shopping, but this is REALLY important” Harry feels himself raise an eyebrow when hearing that, “Alright, I’ve worked over time anyway, I can go home now, we have enough employees here anyway.”
He exited the bathroom only to find Draco, without shoes but with coat still on, in his kitchenette holding a glass of water, Harry walking up to him, “So, the coat is okay but not shoes?” he crossed his arms, leaning back against the wall. “Well, I don’t know about you but I prefer not needing to clean the floor every day,” Draco retorted, taking another sip of his assumed water, “Hope it’s was okay that I grabbed myself a drink,” Harry nodded back, leaning back against the wall, “So, is the party far away?” Draco shrugged, “about 20 min with a bus, so not really,” Harry walks over to the hangers with his jacket on it and threw it on, hands in his pockets he says “Well, that sounds long to me,”  he smiled at Draco who simply shrugged, “There are things that are way farther away,” he puts on his shoes and said, “shall we go?” Harry nodded and put on his own shoes, together they jogged down the stairs and out to the nearest bus stop. “Y’know,” Harry stared shoving into Draco’s side, “If someone told me I’d be going out to a valentines party with Draco Malfoy in 2006; I would’ve kicked them,” Draco shoved him back, “Kick?!” Draco laughed, “Of all things you could do, kick?” Harry shoved Draco again when they reached the bus station, “you’re a git,” he pouted, Draco grinned at him, “How many times have you told me that since we’ve started talking again?” Harry shrugged, “a couple of times, maybe,” Draco rolled his eyes but smiled. “Hermione told Ron she was pregnant with a book, did you know?” Harry said, with a lack of anything else to say, Draco nodded, “I saw Sabrina check you guys out,” he said and Harry raised his eyebrow, “you saw us?” Draco nodded, “yeah, I was stocking some books around the corner and unluckily for you, I recognize you quite easily.” Harry scoffed, “Really though, when haven’t I recognized you?” Draco said defensively and took out his phone, “Well, there was this one time when shopping for school in second year,” Draco looked up from his phone, “In the bookstore?” Harry shook his head, “No, before that,” Draco looked like a question mark, Harry chuckled to himself, “to be fair you didn’t know I was there at all, I was hiding after all,” Draco looked even more like a question mark then, “Let’s just say it like this, Knockturn alley, you apparently talk a lot about me with your father,” Harry smirked, Draco’s eyes widened, he bit his lip and turned around slightly, “I dunno what you’re talking about, Potter,” Harry smirked wider, “Sure you don’t” Draco glared back.
Out of nowhere, they heard an apparition pop and both of them were on their feet, hands already on their wands. But Teddy just calmly looked up from his drawing and said, “Is great auntie here now?” Andromeda smiled at her grandchild, “I don’t know darling, shall we go check?” Andromeda and Teddy went out into the hallway to greet Narcissa, Malfoy went to pour himself some more wine.
Harry stared at it for a moment. It felt too real. This was a step in a life so far from him. He chuckled a little bit “I’m surprised you went so long without knowing.” and she nodded.
“So what did you want?” He asks
“Well, that’s a dramatic way of saying it but…”
And besides, Harry wasn’t gay, for sure, but he knew when a man looked good and damn, Draco did look incredible.
“Is there something, anything at all, that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the opportunity to?” Potter asked and Draco stared at him from across the table. “Yeah” he huffed. “Several things”
He remembers parts of his childhood, running in the garden, careful not to ruin mother’s plants. So full of joy he was back then.
By the way, I am trilingual (Swedish, English and French, ish) so, I would say that I'm qualified to say that, that's an accurate representation of knowing several languages, don't come at me.
He heard Draco arrive as well and soon he said, “What are you staring at?” Harry turned slowly, looking at Draco, “Your plants,” He stated, Draco raised an eyebrow at him and took out his wand, “Very well,” he said and cleaned the dust of both himself and Harry. And marched away towards the door that Harry assumed lead to the bedroom. He slowly followed Draco and watched as he opened the top left drawer and put his wand in it, fiddling with the Malfoy stone before putting that down as well.
6:42 am.
“Well, that was a different turn of conversation than I expected,” Pansy said after the door had shut behind Sabrina. “Oh shut up,” Draco said and went back to sit down by his computer.
“I am going to babysit my cousin okay” He waved her off as he leaned on the wall to the booth. It was raining heavily and he almost regretted deciding to take the train instead of apparating. “You can’t use your family as an excuse to not come with us and study every time. Give up darling,” she cooed. “First of all, I’m not using them as an excuse, and second of all. I’m taking a train for three hours to go see my aunt and my little cousin whom I haven’t seen in a month.” Sabrina hmed and sat herself down on the bench in the booth.
“He’ll be fine darling, besides, he can always cancel, right Harry?” Harry looked at her from behind Ron, “I don’t know, maybe, if I’m honest, he seems like a great guy. Haven’t told you guys but he’s been to the café I’m working at to study, usually staying until closing.” Hermione hmed from behind Ron, and Ron, well, shook him some more just for the sake of it. “Hermione, he’s gone mad!”
“I’ll meet you at the next lecture, chill out,” He said and plopped his computer and book down his bag, “Yeah, don’t skip it, and you no longer have a choice but to come to the café afterwards and I hope you know it,” Draco rolled his eyes, “Okay mum,” he said as he put on his jacket and did salute to the rest of the group, “See ya, losers,” and walked out the door.
“Before the expiration date,” Draco said giving it to Pansy, who downed it. “I remember you sitting on a man’s lap, what was that about,” Draco asked, ice cream in his mouth, “drunk me doesn’t know I’m a lesbian and WILL sleep with anyone,” Draco nodded into the ice cream, “well you see, I’m pretty sure I’m sexually attracted to men, just not romantically,” Pansy continued, grabbing her ice cream spoon again. “Because men ain’t shit,” Draco said and Pansy nodded, “because men ain’t shit,” she echoed.
A wave of an enormous sense of thirst washed over him and he stood to get some water. Just as he’d started sipping on his water Rowan called for him to come up front because someone was there.
“Take your shoes off,” He told Potter as he did himself, hanged his jacket on a hook and proceeded to tidy up his living room and kitchen while Potter did as he was told.
This took a long time to write... ha ha ha... It's not like I just was too lazy to actually open my computer to write it... nooooo
They arrived at Harry’s apartment, just before he opened the door he remembered it was a mess, “my uhh, it’s a mess, sorry,”  Draco shrugged, “I’ve been at my friend Max’s place, I couldn’t see the floor,” Harry grinned before opening the door, looking self-continuously at Draco, realizing he’s never been to Harry’s apartment before. Walking in with his shoes on he picked up some clothes and walked into the bathroom to change, leaving Draco waiting for him by his door.
“How old is he again?” She asked, accepting that he wasn’t going this week either. “Seven” Draco muttered. Staring out coldly in the rain. “Besides, the barista that you want me to meet again so badly is going to be there” he inspected his nails as he spoke. In reality, it was no big deal that Potter was going to be there, he was Terry's godfather after all. “Why? You guys aren't cousins? Right? Because sorry Draco, but that'd be disgusting” he made puking sounds behind him. “No, we're not cousins. Potter is Teddy's godfather, so, yeah” Sabrina hmed again behind him before standing, he heard her shoes move against the pavement, a short walk of three steps towards him.
“Wait is that why you look like shit? Draco what happened?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh Harry, how did tea with the Malfoy’s, Teddy and Andromeda go?” Hermione asks two hours later as she and Ron put on their coats on their way out. “It went smoothly. I and Malfoy were both intoxicated by the end of it.” Harry claps his hands together before awkwardly putting them in his pockets. “Did something happen?” Ron asks above Hermione’s careful eye, “Not really, I guess we randomly planned to travel around Europe, together, this summer…” Harry says carefully shifting his weight from his toes to his heels
“Why do you have alarms for when you got to drink water?” Ginny turns to Hermione who was on her way to stand. “Control-issues,” she told her happily before walking over to the kitchen. “God, they’re not even married yet but they’re so married,” Ginny muttered. Sitting down beside Harry in Hermione’s place. “What’s up?” She turned to Harry, the difference in tone being ridiculously big. “Not much,”
But that’s beside the point.
Deciding to take a nap he tries his best to fall asleep and not get the pain in his neck get the best of him. Then he sleeps for one and a half hour, he wakes up by yet another pling in his phone.
he thinks, there are a few seats by the countertop so why not. A pling from his phone gets his attention back to his desk again.
-16th of February-
“Alright,” Draco said to Teddy when Andromeda had left, “wanna bake?” he asked, not even looking at Teddy, rather the door in the front of them. “Yes!” Teddy jumped, took Draco’s hand and walked them into the kitchen.
And I just wanted to note that yes, tags that I've forgotten are added as I go but one thing for sure, there will not be any detailed sex scenes, since I'm not very comfortable writing that so don't worry about that. Maybe an indication of something happening but not actual scenes.
All the memories, one wand. A single object.
“Sorry” Ron mumbled and looked down on his plate.
“No, well, I’d like for you to bring someone as well, Ginny, a boyfriend would be good for you,” she said, “I have already told you; I’ve already got someone and I’m very happy with her, thank you very much,”
Draco prays Harry doesn’t pick up the book. Prays he’ll forget.
Hope you like it! Dunno when the next chapter will be up but... soon... I hope
Draco telling him to stay.
When Draco stepped into the café, Harry looking up to the ring of the bell to greet a potential customer only to have it be Draco his smile widening and becoming real and waving him over made Draco feel things he shouldn’t.
Harry couldn’t help but stare at the name, his father’s name. “Where did you find this?” He asked breathlessly without looking up, “A store in knockturn alley,” He heard Draco say, and then he felt him coming closer before seeing what Harry was staring at, he pointed at his father’s name and said, “That’s the year he got married,” at that Harry did look up at Draco and watch him take off his own, pointing at the name:
“I would, but I really do not see how that matters,”
He got out at 12, his coworkers insisting he should work full days more often, “because I’m such a delight,” Harry said laughing, walking out. He took the bus home because that’s relaxing, he got time to actually think for the first time since he woke up.
“So, you and Ginny huh,” Harry said after a while and Luna smiled again, “you don’t mind do you?” Harry shook his head, “of course not, you both deserve to be happy,” Luna smiled happily at him, “I heard Molly’s had a harder time with it though,” Harry said, sipping his tea, Luna shrugged lightly, “not really, she just isn’t used to the idea of her daughter not dating you in general, she’ll come around, I know she will,” Harry smiled at the hope in her voice, “she better,” Luna nodded, “it’d be strange if she didn’t, she loves her kids with her whole heart,” Harry nodded at that, there was nothing more accurate about Molly than that. “You’ll come to Sunday dinner on the 5th right?” Harry shrugged, he hadn’t thought about it, “why especially the 5th?” Luna smiled, “I’ll be there it’d be nice if you were too,” Luna had shrugged and Harry had nodded, “I’ll think about it,”
“Yeah, like, the only actual English ones were Black, with a lot of french people in it sure, but English is the origin, and then the Abbotts, McMillans, Potters and Weasleys I think,” Draco put down his fork and started digging in his bag, “But maybe the Weasley’s are Irish?” Harry rolled his eyes, “Is it because of the red hair?” Draco made a face, “Yeah…”
There on the other side of the stone named in scripted and Harry scanned all of the names but stopped at
Teddy released him in order for him to take off his cloak and shoes, for those were the rules. Before dragging him into the living room where both his mother and Potter was sat in silence.
I don't... yeah...
“Remember when we saw each other in the grocery store in October?” Draco nodded, “and I was so shocked I dropped all my groceries?” Draco snorted beside him, “why didn’t you have a cart?” he whispered, his head starting to droop. “Because I was going in to buy cookies and realized on the way that I needed way more,” Harry said smiling, “You’re stupid,” Draco said although there wasn’t any actual spite in his tone, so Harry nodded, “sure am,” he responded, “let’s get you home,” Harry continued and slowly stood, and held out both his hands for Draco to take, which he slowly did. When Draco was standing they kind of just stood smiling at each other, to busy to see Parkinson smile from the floor. “I’ll check in tomorrow morning,” she patted Harry on the shoulder before leaving, Harry rolled his eyes at her before his eyes returned to Draco’s, together they slowly walked outside, hands not leaving each other's. It felt safer this way, Harry convinced himself.
Harry caught himself wondering again, “Hey, Ginny?” the smile faltered from her lips and she raised her eyebrow, “Why the sudden change in tone?” she asked seriously,
As soon as he opened the door Pansy greeted him with a hug, the glitter she had all over her face transferring to Draco’s coat which he quickly took off feeling how many people there are inside, “You should open a window,” He said briefly as Pansy led him over to the bar. “Nonsense,” she said and poured him a shot glass of vodka. Draco rolled his eyes at her before swallowing it in one go,
“A child?” Harry asked, his mouth full of potatoes, “No, no, unless you’d like to bring Teddy of course, but girlfriend,” she said pointedly and let herself glance towards Ginny, who groaned, “No mum, not happening,”

Eventually, he puts it down in the drawer again and gets ready for bed.
, he thought,
And so they kept talking during Potter’s entire lunch break, and when he finally told that he had to go back to work Draco didn’t answer but just left him on read and put down his phone in his lap. His heating pad gone cold long ago and he was starting to get hungry so he dragged himself over to the kitchen to make something to eat before sitting himself down at the computer to study again.
“Yeah, my crippling loneliness is just getting to me,” Draco said and chuckled, Harry, wrinkled his eyebrows but decided to laugh along.
I'll try to get these up once a month but no promises.
Draco

“Summer 2000,” Luna said from behind him, Harry startled, immediately putting the picture down, turning around to face Luna who gave him a puzzled look. She leaned back on her four-poster, gently picking on a flower she had taken from a vase, not looking at Harry, “when I was imprisoned in Malfoy manor Draco would hold guard sometimes,” she took a pedal of the flower, letting it fall to the floor, “when everyone else had gone to bed he’d come back, several plates of food with him,” she looked at Harry then, “or he’d order way too much food for him alone to eat,” another pedal fell to the floor, “on my 17th birthday he brought a cake, it was small, rather a muffin than anything else, but the gesture was genuine,” Luna looked up at the ceiling, smiling, “he’s a good person,” she said, then looking at Harry, “it’s okay to like him,” Harry laughed bitterly, “I don’t,” Harry said and Luna hummed, taking a sip of her tea, “of course you don’t.”
With one more glance at the ceiling he stands up, admittedly, a little too quickly, he has to hold onto his desk for a moment while his blood pressure goes up again. “More water,” he says to himself before hastily packing his bag with 2 of his school books, a regular book, a notebook, his pencil case along with his computer and charger, throwing in a portable charger to his phone as well.
Hugging Dean was not something Harry thought he’d enjoy but Dean was taller and could properly wrap around him and he was warm and, good at hugs, which he pointed out and Seamus agreed, the hug with him being more awkward, them being the same height alone made it worse, but still good.
“Oh if it isn’t Draco Malfoy,” Andromeda said when she had come down the stairs to greet the guest. “If it isn’t Andromeda Tonks,” Draco replied and hugged her in greeting. “Cousin Draco!” Teddy lunged himself into Malfoy’s arms, fancy dressed robes and all and Malfoy hugged him back “There, there, Teddy. I was here last week,” Malfoy said putting him down. Andromeda tapped Harry on the shoulder and said, “Go change, I’ll take over the kitchen,” and Harry slowly crept away from the small crowd. Yeah, he felt out of place for sure.
He couldn’t believe that Pansy had gotten a better job than he’ll ever get.
“I have to shower,” Harry said and Draco knew it was a poor excuse to get away, he’d used it enough himself. Draco hmed as Harry picked up his jacket and put it on. “We’re good right?” Draco felt himself ask self-consciously and Harry shrugged, “‘course,” he said, but Draco wasn’t sure, regardless he let it go, “I’ll see you then,” Harry nodded before unlocking Draco’s door and walking out, “Do you have your wand with you? Phone?” Draco asked like a worried mother and Harry nodded, walking backwards to the stairs, “see you later;” Harry had waved and Draco had waved back. Looking after him as he walked down the stairs,
The bus stopped half way where Sabrina said goodbye and walked towards the cafè ahead. Draco watches her go and as she walked into the cafè he sees Potter by the cashier, he was taking orders and smiling at his customers. Draco hopes Potter doesn't see him through the huge windows. As the bus starts he looks away from the cafè and down on his phone. Music would be very welcome at this moment.
“Is it time to go already?” Andromeda walked downstairs as Potter was putting his coat on, still talking to Draco who was leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets. “Yeah, sadly, I have work tomorrow.” To which Andromeda crossed her arms. “On a Saturday? Harry James Potter” Potter snickers and Draco couldn’t help not to join in. “Yes, cafés are open on Saturdays as well, I’ll walk to the apparition point. Have a good night,” he waved towards Andromeda and then nodded towards Draco who nodded back.
“10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1”
“What’s up?” Draco asked as he slides away from Teddy and left him to read by himself, “Your mum doesn’t want me to be here,” He said rather quietly, “Oh,” Draco responds and looks over at Teddy who still sat quietly, concentrating on his book. Draco looks back at him and smirks, “Wait until I tell her I’m going to spend my entire summer with you,”
And so Harry Potter started to follow Draco Malfoy on Instagram, later also discovering Pansy and Blaise on there and following her too if he just didn’t have to make it worse for himself.
Follow him on Instagram, why the fuck should he do that? He asked himself as he went and did just that.
I am sorry that I have not updated on here for like... two months?
“Yeah but I woke up early today,” he let Teddy down and hugged the older lady in greeting. “I must go get myself presentable for my sister and nephew, you wouldn’t mind?” Andromeda said, gesturing towards Teddy, “Oh no, not at all,” Harry replied, shaking off his jacket and his boots. “Come on, come on!” Teddy jumped up and down, dragging him into the kitchen, which was greatly decorated, by his sleeve to show him some drawing he’d made.
A gold moment was when Draco opens his, Harry had gotten him a gift card to the café, the sum on it probably lasting several years. “
“I don’t know, I kinda want to go to a restaurant in like… Diagon Alley, but I didn’t know if you were comfortable with that so I… let you decide?” Draco shrugged, “We can go to Diagon Alley, I haven’t been there in a while,”
“So, where were we?” Hermione asked as she sat herself down at the table again. “Malfoy is everywhere?” Ron looked up from having buried his head in his hands. “Oh yeah why don’t we just keep talking about Malfoy” Harry complained.
Harry woke up still in his jeans by an owl picking on his window. Groaning Harry stood, cringing at the light, even though the sun hasn't risen yet, the headache from his hangover getting to him, yawning he opened the window carefully, the letter was from Luna, which Harry was not expecting, especially not in this hour,
Draco wanted to snap but didn’t, Harry sighed, “did we cuddle?” When Draco turns around Harry has one hand in his hair, like he was in the middle of combing it with his hands but stopped mid-way. Draco didn’t know what he should say.
“He’s my childhood friend, though brought up to believe all the pure-blood stuff, so was I, by the way, he was forced into becoming a death eater by his father, who’s in prison right now. He got freed from all charges because none other than Harry Potter pleated him not guilty” Pansy smiled at Sabrina and then glanced up at Draco.
He puts his phone down again and rubs his eyes, he had a headache
“Her?” Molly said and raised an eyebrow. “Yes,” Ginny responded, looking very done with the discussion at hand. “Congratulations,” Harry said to her from across the table and she gave him a little smile, “Now, now, Molly, let’s settle down and eat, yeah?” Arthur calmed his wife and slowly but surely the small talk to up once again.
Harry wondered think back to all of his crushes, Cho, Ginny and… no one else. Obviously. Harry signed deeply and leaned his head on the sofa and closes his eyes.
Oh and I don't know how to spell apparate? Is that how you? Do that thing?
“Yes? Please hurry up my warm shower is waiting for me, mother, and my bill is rapidly going up I suspect.” His mother chuckled at that. “Harry Potter will also be joining us” Draco stared at his mother. The world has cursed him he decided. “Okay,” He said casually, though he suspected it sounded rather strained. “Okay, go continue your shower darling” Narcissa waved as she disappeared from the fireplace. “Fuck,” He said to his apartment as he stood and walked towards the bathroom to continue his precious shower.
“I mean… okay, sure”
To say the least, Malfoy got scared when he tapped him on the shoulder to tell him they were closing. Malfoy nodded and packed his stuff but stayed back from leaving.
For just a couple of minutes later his doorbell rings. He’s in the middle of an episode of Friends and not only that but also in the middle of his breakfast and the doorbell rings. Curse it, he thinks as he stands up to open the door.
Harry, ignoring her, sits down next to Ron on the sofa, “What ya watching?” He asks him with a mouth full of food. “I don’t know Harry, something”
He didn’t think that Potter would’ve even remembered the journey, trip or whatever you want to call it. He thought Potter would’ve at least pretended like he didn’t remember that conversation happening, apparently not.
*****
Yeah I'm sorry this was pretty short but it was just one scene and I kinda want to get as many chapters up before school starts :)
“You need to let loose Dray,” She said, a smile on her face before she left for the crowd currently dancing widely, in the main room. Draco goes and fills a cup with more vodka before exiting the barroom and onto the main one, he had unbuttoned two of the buttons on his shirt and were wearing black high-waisted jeans, he glanced in the mirror he concluded that he did look quite hot, the scar that was left behind from the death eater mark, now a mere scar was also making an appearance since he had rolled up his sleeves to right below his elbows. The room he entered had a lack of air and smelled like sweat from people jumping and dancing together, the music deafening. Seeing a couple of tables in a corner he walked over them, seeing as to in comparison to the rest of the room it was just as packed,
playing loud though the speakers,
Harry stared at the name, his grandfather. It must be, even though the numbers were very far apart. He goes up another row,
And so they continued until they had planned their entire journey deciding to go to Ireland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and France. And then they went on to book their trip in one go because why not, calculating how long they’d have to stay at each place to get to do all that the wanted to do and if they were going to get there by car, bus, train or plane. Also, make sure that every ticket and hotel where a money back in case they took longer to get there or had to cancel it.
By the time the countdown was happening Draco and Kevin turned back to the rest of the group and together, everyone present counted down together:
“Hello,” he was greeted by Hermione who stood there and sipped on something which was probably water, “Hey, Hermione,” He greeted back and she went to hug him as well. “How are things?” And when Draco simply shrugged in response she also added: “And freedom?” “How’s it not being able to drink alcohol until sometime in July?” Draco countered cheekily and Hermione sighed, “Incredibly difficult as you must know,” Draco hummed, “Not really, I’ve never been pregnant,” Draco smirked as Hermione rolled her eyes at him,
Someone help me. He prayed as he laid down on his sofa again, deciding that, he was not going to get up until he really needed too.
Waking up on your sofa the next day to find yourself with torticollis from having your neck in a weird angle sleeping on the sofa, isn’t the nicest of things. Nonetheless, stinking breath and the smell of ice cream remains that’d been there all night isn’t much better.
“You look horrible, has something happened?” She said, a matter of factly at the same time as she managed to look and sound, concerned.
If you've decided to read the previous chapter again you might've noticed I went back and changed a thing, now you see, Draco has a drivings license. I realised I don't know the traffic laws of Britain and doesn't even have a driving license myself, just a minor change, mostly due to the fact that I have no idea how to write it.
Draco's friends are really up his ass about things sometimes, ain't they?
“Café, Draco!” Ava called from the other side of the lecture hall the next day. “Keep dreaming” He yelled back. His good friend Craig accompanied him on the way out. A difference from the others he didn’t constantly nag him about going to café Cursed beans. He didn’t go there unless he really needed to. AKA for group projects. However, Craig didn’t take the bus and couldn’t shield him from Sabrina.
“Hey,” Harry had come up behind him, Draco had almost jumped, “Hi,” He replied looking at his friends who, almost together said, “The barista!” to which Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
Harry cleared his throat to get Draco’s attention before saying, “I’ll be on my way then,” Draco looked up at him and nodded, “I wouldn’t go out in those clothes if I were you but then again, I am not,” he opened a drawer to look inside, probably for a pyjamas. “No matter how much you’d want to be,” Harry smirked, and Draco turned to glare in his direction. “Bye, thanks for the stone, again,” Harry scratched his neck turning around towards the door. “No problem,” Draco said, now standing in the doorway, pyjamas in hand. “I’m leaving now,” Harry announced, “Really? You don’t seem to be,” Draco teased and rolled his eyes. “Okay now I’m really leaving,” Harry said, slowly walking towards the door, and opening it slowly, “Bye,”
7.30 am
“WHY do you know this?!”
When they’d gotten their food they ate in silence, until a thought struck Draco, “Did you know most English pureblood houses come from different countries?”
“Are you flooing or apparating?” Draco asked as he walked towards the fireplace to use the floo. “Oh, I don’t have a fireplace, so I don’t really have a choice,” Harry said with ease, going into the hallway to get his backpack. “You can always floo to mine and go home from there,”
Harry lowered his voice and trained his eyes on his mug, “I’m bad at this. I don’t know how. I barely know how to look after Theo even without making it more complicated.”
“Like I say, I thought you might like to see some nice magic. There’s more to the world than the bits that have hurt us,” Draco added quietly.
“Are you really going to laugh at me about not knowing what muggle things are and then not tell me? What’s an astronaut? Can you get it in a shop?”
Kal fanned himself with one hand like he thought he might faint, “Oh my goodness! Isn’t he just the loveliest person you’ve ever met? He teaches one of our Potioneering seminars, and everyone adores him!”
There was an awkward pause.
“Yes, it’s packed,” Theodore’s voice came out smaller than usual, and Harry was immediately awash in regret for speaking to him impatiently. He still looked quite peaky.
“No!” Harry and Draco answered together.
Harry and Draco both laughed then.
Draco was curled up half under the covers and rather twisted up in them, clearly still quite nude but with the essential bits mostly covered. He had his eyes squeezed shut and there were tense lines in his brow and around his mouth. “I forgot to get my potions out before I came down to transform,” he murmured faintly. “Your fault. Too dishy.”
“Hi Molly, sorry to bother you so late.”
Malfoy snorted, then cleared his throat, “I’ll ask Mr Flyspring to send another cursebreaker.”
Harry staggered under the weight, “All right! Don’t knock me down now!” He steadied himself with a hand on Draco’s back, and his fingers all but vanished into the dense, soft fur.
Malfoy had been looking at Harry’s hand and his stance before, but he fixed his cool grey eyes on Harry’s face, “Eye contact is important, but don’t think about the incantation once I start it. Think of what we’re protecting. Fix it in your mind. That’s essential. You start, and I’ll incant in a few moments. Ready?”
“This place is incredible.”
Theo returned his attention to Draco’s arm, where his sleeve was still pushed up and noticed the bite scar for the first time, “Did the cursed thing have teeth and bite you?”
“Who’s Malfoy?” asked Dudley over Ron and Hermione’s sounds of surprise and dismay, which promptly turned to laughter at the question. Dudley looked at Harry, “What’s so funny? Who’s Malfoy?”
Theodore nodded slowly and said, “Okay,” in a very small voice.
“I definitely agree with you on that, Theo. Very stupid.” Harry drew a deep breath, “Theodore, I want you to know I love you very much, okay? You’re my favourite person in the whole world, and nothing’s ever going to change that. All right?”
The cock in question went from quite interested to completely hard so quickly that Harry got a bit dizzy and had to shut his eyes for a moment.
Theo nodded rather glumly, “If I hadn’t been scared of the boggart, then would you let me?”
Harry shouldered Theo’s school bag so that he could focus on not dropping his sandwich and checked his watch, “Bout ten seconds.”
“You can learn it, though,” Draco said eagerly. “I mean you weren’t born knowing how to write a novel.”
“You’ve already got the boggart sorted out, I expect?”
Theo made a huffy sort of sound of annoyance, but at Harry’s raised eyebrows, he stumped off to the kitchen for his tea.
“And sometimes I got hurt or saw my friends hurt. And sometimes I thought I’d die. And that changed me. It changed my mind and it changed my body and mostly in not very good ways. And it was wrong for them--the grownups--to let those things happen to me, because I was a kid. It isn’t because I think you’re no good or you can’t handle it. That isn’t the point. The whole point of the cursebreaking is to make sure there isn’t anything that will hurt you in the house. If I let you stay and watch, you might get hurt anyway, and that’s the last thing I want. I know you’re interested, but there’re more appropriate ways for you to learn about that stuff, okay? You trust me?”
Belle Brewer had felt very lively and vivid that morning, his own prose wry and charming, and if he paused to consult his thesaurus on what word he ought to use, the book seemed to fall open to just the right one. Even after pausing for lunch, Harry’s flow state continued. The keys of his typewriter clattered away under his fingers almost musically, like his hands were in perfect harmony with his brain. It was thrilling to have it all slide out so easily for so long.
Malfoy brightened, “Would that be a help?”
“Oh.” Draco tossed his silky hair, “Well then calling it a familiar is simply one of our few non-rubbish traditions, and I’m not going to toss it aside simply to avoid your chaffing.”
Draco shook his head impatiently, “Yes, of course, but I mean it isn’t healthy to be isolated from people like yourself that way. You must let me set you up with the support group. I’ve got a leaflet in my bag, I think. He’ll be able to meet other werewolves around his age, and there’s a group for families as well you ought to join. It provides all sorts of support like recommendations for healers specialising in lycanthropy patients, resources for nutrition and pain management and transformation sites.
Draco changed Harry’s fork into a piece of chalk just to lovingly annoy him, but Harry was laughing too much to be annoyed as he handed it over.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Do you think that’s really fair? Suppose Daisy asked me to write her a note to get out of the uniform and Rosie as well.”
Malfoy smiled cordially, “Good afternoon.”
After a little more pie, and a leisurely helping of ice cream, Draco got up from his seat, checked his watch, and looked out of the window, “Won’t be long now.”
“That’s all right. Where I am now is better than where I was before.”
Harry Disapparated, and they reappeared in Diagon Alley’s Apparition area. He followed Ron to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Ron let them into the shop. Harry helped Ron arrange a display of the new line of Tickling Cloaks, and did not throw a wobbly.
Draco was still looking about him curiously, “Between all your uncharacteristic apprehension and the way the room was sealed up, I thought for certain there was a hell mouth in here or something. I’ve seen you meet a dragon with more swagger.”
Theodore was surprised when he came home and found Draco still at Grimmauld Place and waiting for him beside Harry.
“That’s why you aren’t allowed in the cursebreaking,” put in Harry.
House Names:
Draco handed him the knife, “I’d recommend you start in one of the top corners. Bit closer to the frame, perhaps? Perfect. Mind your fingers.”
Draco was looking dreamy again, “That’s her name? Diana?”
“You look very nice,” Draco remarked, at his threshold when Harry collected him for their outing.
” Ron sang in a misty voice. “'
“Oh, Kal. Of course. The pink hair. How could I forget. How did you like the Centre?”
“Malfoy?” Hermione shrugged, “You’ve seen him. Why ask me?”
“Thanks.” Harry laughed, “You’re a really, really sweet kid, Theo.”
“Oh no, you need to have it all in place before the transformations begin, not scramble about afterward. Especially the wolfsbane, Potter. You really ought to see to it at once.”
Theodore drew breath as if to finally speak, but instead burst into noisy tears. Feeling a bit useless, Harry shuffled up the bed and put his arm about Theodore’s shoulders, “Hey, it’s all right. You’re safe. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”
“Not bad,” Harry said modestly.
Draco hid his face against Harry’s chest and did not say it.
On Saturday morning, after a hasty breakfast following a certain amount of dawdling from Theodore, Harry and Theo took a muggle bus to the Youth Lycanthropy Health Centre, which looked from the outside like one of those cramped and musty old shops that sells hideous antiques by appointment only. Inside, it was clean and spacious and surprisingly modern for a wizarding building, with lots of angular furniture and white tile floors.
Harry gave Theo a little ruffle, “I think I’ll put my name down for that wolfsbane course.”
Harry shrugged, “I’d cope. Do you need a hug?”
“Oh just fine,” Hagrid said, smiling over a huge sip of tea. “Pumpkins are comin’ along. Grawp was down from the hills the other day for a visit, and he’s well.”
“I think you contradicted yourself,” Draco dropped into a desk chair and rocked it from side to side as he spoke.
“And yet you thought that one might fancy a cuddle,” Harry shot back.
“Yeah, and it’s Theodore now.”
“Yes, amazingly seduced. More touching, please.”
“I didn’t want to snub you,” Draco continued. “I’m very pleased to have met you, but I thought actually that you might not want to know me.”
Draco harumphed and Vanished the slimy handkerchief before lying down with his head against Harry’s chest, stickiness be damned, “I want to tell you something. You’re going to think it’s because of the sex, and it isn’t, and if you say it is, I shall turn you into a frog.”
Harry looked at him in surprise, “I’d no idea you had a rabbit.”
“Can I wear my Converse tomorrow? The blue ones with the moons on them.”
“Right,” said Theodore, and disappeared further into the shop without another word.
“Theodore! That’s not a polite question!”
Ron interrupted gently, “You didn’t let anything happen, Harry. It was just one of those things. You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re not the Dursleys--the old Dursleys I mean, not Dud. And you’re not Dumbledore. Go easy on yourself.”
Dean calmly extinguished the till with his own wand, “Not that one, then. Let’s see. Maybe the beech…”
Malfoy made a sour face, “You shouldn’t be allowed to be good at cooking.”
“To stop them being stolen,” he advised Harry.
“I still don’t see what this has to do with Theodore?” said Dudley patiently, chasing a last bit of gravy from his plate with a crust of bread.
Harry rolled his eyes and tried not to grin too hard.
“I’m still interested in your story. I think that would make a great play.”
Malfoy flinched and the remnants of his high, angry colour drained from his face. With a prickle of guilt, Harry recalled what he’d said to Theo about triggers.
“Ten o’clock will be fine,” said Malfoy.
The three of them fell about laughing. Dudley looked at Harry, bemused.
“I don’t swagger-”
Harry kissed his rosy cheek, “If you say so. Darling.” Draco drew out his wand menacingly, but Harry only kissed him again.
The Saturday before Theodore was due to set off for Hogwarts, Harry took him to St. Mungo’s to visit his granny. One of the courtyards at the hospital had been turned into a garden for the patients to take sunshine and air in, and there was a special nook of it arranged for spattergroit patients and their visitors in particular. Spattergroit remained contagious by touch for months into the recovery, so in order to enforce physical separation without tedious protective protocol, the needed distance was built into the garden.The patients sat on park benches on the shores of a tiny island in the centre of the garden, and the visitors sat across the surrounding moat on their own benches.
Harry could feel something rushing over his hand, so like water that he almost wanted to check and see that his hand wasn’t actually wet. But he remembered Malfoy’s instruction that eye contact was important, and he kept his eyes fixed on Malfoy’s clear grey ones. Presently the rushing feeling of the dissolving ward subsided. The latch on the door clicked softly, and the door opened.
Draco wordlessly made room for him, “What’s this now?”
“Harry, mate I’ve seen that face a thousand times. You’re blaming yourself for something.You want a chat, I think. Or a wobbly. Follow me to work and have it there while I get ready to open, or I’ll be late.”
While he was pondering it, Theo remarked, “Oh we like those books as well. I like The Hobbit better, though.The Lord of the Rings makes Harry-” he checked himself before declaring that the books made Harry cry, but added, “Are you gay, Draco?”
“I’m Theodore,” Theo’s hair went pink for just a moment, then shifted back to a turquoise that matched his jumper.
Draco got very interested in the tabletop suddenly, “I booked the table a month ago. I got up the nerve to ask you yesterday. I suppose I might have kept that to myself, now I think about it.”
“And I’ve spoken to her healer, and we can have a little visit tomorrow. Straight after school, okay?”
Harry laughed weakly, “That’s generous of you, thanks. I’m just sorry it was. Up in the air.”
Theo ignored him. “What happened to you?” he asked Draco.
Malfoy’s mouth tilted in stiff irritation, but a faint flush tinged his cheeks, “Come again?”
“Read the book, Granny,” Theodore insisted earnestly. “I don’t want you to be afraid for me anymore. I’m not afraid anymore. I have the YLHC and Draco and Harry. Harry’s really been looking after me. He’s great,” and he looked back at Harry with a little grin, as if Harry’s purported greatness were some sort of scheme they’d cooked up between them to please Andromeda. Harry gave him a hug. “Oh Granny,” said Theo in dismay when he turned back. “It’s all right, really.”
“Well Belle is still looking for the person who saved her life at The Rampant Hippogriff.”
“Mostly, but it’ll really hurt my feelings if you don’t slick me up first.”
“The cat, then,” Theodore decided. “I love cats.”
Harry had done quite a lot to prepare for Theodore’s arrival, though it mainly hadn’t been choosing videos to watch together. Before it was decided that Theodore would be coming to him, Harry had been dawdling through finishing with the cleaning up of Grimmauld Place, as it hadn’t really seemed a priority compared with everything else going on in Harry’s life.
“Oh,” Harry was a little disappointed. “Well that’s all right. I’ll send you an inscribed copy when it comes out.”
Draco shook his head, “I’ll be all right. This much’ll get me to the loo in a pinch, and I’ll be better still after I have another sleep. Thanks for breakfast. That helped a lot.”
“Really?”
Hagrid and Luna must have seen them through the window, because they came banging in, dripping wet.
Malfoy shrugged, “Not likely. But. Even so. It was a mistake for me to come here. I should have known at the outset that it was a mistake.” He fiddled with his left sleeve, shoving it up and down his forearm nervously, “I did want to see you.” Harry gawked at the admission. “Not to do you a mischief or anything,” Malfoy added quickly. “I just. Don’t you think it all ended a bit. Abruptly?”
The shop attendant helped them choose everything they needed for the cat, while Theodore trailed around behind, holding his purring cat in his arms. Draco walked beside him, but Harry fell back to last of the procession, wondering if the lingering prickles of surprise and embarrassment were an over reaction and trying to jerk himself out of the feeling enough to enjoy the rest of the trip.
After they took their seats, which were warm stone, possibly warmed from inside, Harry looked up at the sky. It was the dusky colour of a shadow, and didn’t give the slightest hint that they were actually inside a smallish restaurant in Islington. He noticed that Draco’s shirt was the exact same twilight colour as the sky and also that it matched his eyes.
“That was lovely,” Harry said a little breathlessly. “You’re lovely.”
“I wasn’t suggesting you would! I’m just trying to be practical about. Any possible eventualities. I want you to be comfortable.”
Draco was waiting for them already when they reached The Leaky Cauldron. The pub was crowded and noisy, but he’d managed to stake out a table near a window, where he was sipping a gillywater and looking rather ill at ease. He was wearing blue robes again, a deep teal instead of the navy blue robes he wore to work. His fair hair was pulled back into a loose half knot, and a bit of it had come down in the front. He was toying with a strand between finger and thumb, and it made him look young and rather nervous, and not for the first time, Harry was struck by how unguarded he was.
