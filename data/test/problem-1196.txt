But Potter just shrugged. “Outstanding, I guess?”
“Yeah. Quite a character.”
Draco looked up at him, his eyes going cold. “I told you, Potter, no matter what your intentions are, if you--”
“Then I guess we are.”
I'm trying to update consistently, I swear, but if my inspiration just isn't there it won't be very fun to read, you know?
They stayed like that for a moment, fingers linked, looking at each other. Draco flushed, pulling his hand away. He didn’t want to let on how nice it felt, having any kind of contact with another person. Even just linking fingers was strangely calming. He remembered the offer of a hug Potter had made the day before, and wondered once again if he’d been serious. Knowing Potter, the cheesy bastard, he probably had been.
“He said you’re a good man.”
you reading about?” Potter asked again, sounding even more curious now.
“Seems not.” Draco stepped further into the room, but didn’t approach Harry. “Mind if I join you?”
Harry felt the familiar stab of guilt he always got when he thought about Ron. “I’m sorry, Ron, I...I owe you an apology. Like, a thousand apologies.”
A bit more bedraggled and sickly, surely, but Harry would know those ice blue eyes anywhere.
So so sorry for the wait guys. Next one should be up sooner. It’s been a rough week.
“You should see the other guy,” Draco quipped, taking a seat.
She blinked. “Draco? Oh thank Merlin, Draco, it’s really you…”
“Well, Draco,” she continued, “I'll keep looking into it, and I’ll send you some books over, if you’d like to research it on your end, too.”
“Oh...hey,” he said, giving Draco a sleepy half smile.
Potter took a step towards him, and Draco stepped away, back hitting the wall. A wave of shame washed over him. As much as he despised Corbyn, the man always succeeded in making Draco feel lower than dirt. All the things he’d done, all the screaming he’d sat through, all the murders he’d watched--he could see them reflected in Corbyn’s black eyes.
Harry watched him, wishing he could do something. He’d always been rubbish at knowing what to say, and he didn’t think Draco wanted to hear any of it at the moment, anyway. But still, Harry couldn’t just sit there and watch him cry. Tentatively, he reached out a hand, and rested it on Draco’s shoulder, waiting for Draco to pull away. He didn’t. Eventually, ever so slowly, he leaned against it.
“Are those the marks from the chains you came here in?” Harry asked, gesturing at the bruises that hadn’t healed.
Hope you enjoyed, as always, please leave your thoughts. <3
activate the curse, did you?”
Draco pulled away, intentionally this time. “What are you doing, Potter? Playing nurse?”
Draco cleared his throat.
“Something.” Draco fisted his hands. “Something besides following orders. Besides being a coward, just letting it happen.”
Malfoy stared at the jumper in silence for a long moment.
Draco shook his head. “No, I’m tired of avoiding it.” He took a deep, shuddering breath, cramming the heels of his hands into his eyes to stop the tears in a well-practiced motion. Had it really come to this? Had Azkaban really messed him up that badly, that now even the thought of kindness turned him inside out with dread?
Draco drained the last of his coffee, and scrubbed a hand over his face. “Great. I really am a pity project, aren’t I?”
“If you’ll just sign here at the bottom, to finalize the delivery.”
“Do you know where she is?” Harry asked.
More coming soon

Draco wrapped his arms around himself again. Potter was right, as usual, all Draco wanted at the moment was to bury his emotions in a fight. The fact that Potter had seen through his defense, yet again, just made him angrier. “Just leave me alone,
“I don’t want you to apologize. I want you to…” Ron trailed off, wringing his hands, staring down at them. “You’re one of the bravest people I know, Harry. Whatever’s lurking in the back of your head, you can fight it.”
“So you gave him to
“You didn’t...look under my sweater, did you?”
“I get them, too,” Harry said.
“Getting plastered, I assume.”
“The master said,” the elf continued muttering, “The master said this was Kreacher’s part of the house, Kreacher does not know what this criminal is doing--”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief at that; at least Narcissa was safe. He couldn’t wait to tell Malfoy. He hoped Malfoy would believe that Hermione really did have the best of intentions, that Narcissa really was safe with her.
Draco set the books down, wrists aching, and then immediately regretted it, his arms feeling empty. He wasn’t sure what to do with his hands. “Mr--Um…” ‘Mr. Weasley’ had annoyed him, but ‘Ron’ sounded far too familiar. “Um...Weasley, I just want you to know how sorry I am for--”
Potter’s mouth was a firm line of anger. “Do you really think it’s smart to be testing me? After everything you’ve done?”
Corbyn was looking at Draco again. His lips twisted into a smile, looking at the bruises and raw skin around Draco’s neck. “Did you take his shirt off yet?” Corbyn asked.
He didn’t feel like himself. He didn’t feel like anyone. He certainly didn’t feel like Harry Potter. And he was going to drink until he forgot that damn name, forgot he was the Savior of the Wizarding World. Until he felt numb again.
“Typical Slytherin,” Harry said.
“They got married, got a house. I’m sure they’re very happy.” Potter sounded bitter.
“It’s sort of boring, really. One time, over Christmas break in fourth year, when I had woken up in the middle of the night. My mum was up, too, and she made me some tea, and we just sat there in the kitchen talking, until the sun rose. It’s the last time I remember feeling…” He looked away, cleared his throat. “Feeling like a kid, I guess.” He picked up his fork, dug into his pancakes. “Told you it was boring.”
“Wait,” Harry stammered out.
“What did it mean to you?”
The ride to Harry Potter’s house had been long, but this moment was even longer. Draco Malfoy shifted his weight from foot to foot in the entryway of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. What was Potter playing at, he wondered, requesting him specifically from the program, and then rejecting him when he got there? Did he just want to give Draco a moment of hope, a glimpse of sunshine, before sending him back to Azkaban? To
on me, more than once. Not many Aurors willing to use unforgivable curses--they get paranoid, superstitious. But Corbyn...Corbyn loved it.” Malfoy spread his shaky fingers out on the table, observing them as they twitched like they belonged to someone else. “And when he used it on me, I could
Harry shook his head. “Please, just...let me get this out.”
Malfoy.
Potter folded his arms. “I don’t remember getting one.”
“If I didn’t want you waving a wand in my face, Potter, what makes you think I want you wielding scissors next to my neck?”
“Sorry you’ve been mildly inconvenienced by my enslavement, Potter,” Draco said, a little miffed.
“Okay, Malfoy. What happened today? Who was that guy?”
“She seemed pretty happy, from what I saw,” Harry said, hoping the thought would be some comfort.
“A…key?” Draco drawled.
“Maybe it’s related to the dark art of contract law,” Potter said sarcastically.
Ron blushed. “Hermione dragged me, okay?”
“My family’s dead,” Potter said, through a mouthful of chow mein. “I got it at a thrift store.”
“What?” Harry asked tiredly. “Let me guess, it’s too dirty for your standards? You’d prefer to freeze to death?”
“You went to
“Thanks for the advice, mate,” Harry said, his voice shaking.
Potter laughed softly, running a hand through his overgrown bangs. “Fine, you don’t have to tell me.”
Draco couldn’t remember the last time someone had helped him calm down from an episode like that. His memory had gaps in it, but he was fairly certain no one ever had. Draco could normally control himself well enough not to break down like that unless he was alone. Until Azkaban, at least. But no one there had been inclined to comfort him.
Draco was stepping into the entryway as Potter opened the door, but when Draco saw who was behind it, he stopped short. Corbyn. And Reynolds, that ginger lard who loved kicking him. Reynolds was big, but Corbyn was even taller. They made an intimidating pair, blocking out what little grey, noonday light managed to filter through the clouds.
Like when he’d insulted the Weasleys, Draco found himself realizing belatedly that he’d stepped on Potter’s toes. Sirius Black was one of the only other people Potter had ever considered family, as far as Draco knew, and Draco had thrown a temper tantrum in his house. Draco shifted his weight in his chair, pushed the food around on his plate. Finally, he forced the words out of his mouth. “I’m sorry, Potter. For putting a dent in the wall, and throwing things, I...”
“Would you?” Harry said, honestly curious. He knew Malfoy was a Slytherin, and he’d been a bully back in school. But when the chips were down and Harry had been a prisoner at Malfoy’s family home, he hadn’t identified them to the Death Eaters. To Harry, that counted for a lot.
“Alright,” Potter replied. “Fair enough.” He set his food down on the table. “What about you? Do you have any requests?”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Potter asked, but Draco couldn’t find air in his throat to answer him.
Malfoy blinked at him, his cheeks taking on a slight tinge of pink. “Well. Who knew. The Boy Who Lived goes both ways.”
“That’s not the point,” Draco retorted.
Harry chuckled softly, remembering Mr. Weasley’s fondness for Muggle memorabilia. “It’s noon,” he said.
And Harry had never seen Draco as a monster, not really. He’d been a bully, fair and square--but so had Harry’s father, he remembered, the day he’d stepped into Snape’s memory needling at the back of his mind. People did plenty of dumb things, as teenagers. It had just so happened he and Draco had been caught in the middle of a war.
“Hungry?” Potter asked, searching the floor with a hand for his glasses.
Malfoy smiled up at him. “Thanks,” he said sleepily.
Draco pulled his hand away. Potter had used his name again, he realized. Dammit, why did Potter have to be so convincingly sincere? Those green eyes were staring at him, still looking more concerned than suspicious.
Draco let out an angry huff of exasperation. “Really, Potter? You think they’d want that for you?”
Potter blinked. “Excuse me?”
“Cleaning out my liquor cabinet, more like…” Harry muttered. “Would you stop winding that damn thing? Keeps me awake.”
feel better.
There was a long, tense moment of silence. Draco could hear his own heart thumping in his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Still cold?” Harry asked, as Malfoy drained the glass.
“I think you have a right to be wary. I think I’d be terrified, if I were you. And, well…” Potter cleared his throat, apparently choosing his words. “I think that’s why you didn’t want me working any kind of spell on you, in the beginning. But I think if I pulled my wand out, right now, and threatened you with it, you’d just stare straight back at me--probably dare me to do it. You haven’t backed down from a fight since you got here.”
“I’ll just take the one,” Ron replied. He stood and stepped forward, dropping to a seat on the floor in front of the fire. “It’s fine, Harry. Now stop looking so guilty.”
They’d mixed hallucinogens into his food before, and usually the visions were terrible. But he remembered once imagining, being absolutely sure, that he was back at Malfoy Manor, and his mother was there, making tea and singing softly to herself. It had been quiet, and peaceful, and when he’d finally sobered and realized where he was, it had been unbearable. No company but the rattling breaths of Dementors, nothing but cold, dripping stone and echoing screams.
Malfoy picked the sandwich up, turned it over. “That’s cause I haven’t.” He chuckled to himself, bitterly. “Yeah, I know, poor little rich boy, had to go a couple days without eating.”
“The one who...the one who broke your fingers?” Harry said.
“What will work then, if you’re so smart?”
“Harry, I know. I’m part of the program.”
What if he was still back in that place? He couldn’t go back, he couldn’t. Not after...whatever this was. It would break him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, thrown.
Draco swallowed, hard, and finally spat out the truth. “I was researching the runes. Looking for a way to break the curse.”
The two Aurors, engrossed in their argument with Malfoy, looked up in surprise. Malfoy didn’t look at Harry, but there was a small smile of triumph playing on his lips.
“So, your hair…Ginny used to cut it, didn’t she?”
He wondered if he could ever forgive Draco, and found himself surprised to realize that he already had. Mostly, at least. The amount that Draco had suffered, the weight of his actions obviously hanging on his shoulders...it put his desperate, foolish crimes into perspective.
Ron raised an eyebrow at him. “Did you just call me
charm, so I can take a look at it, Okay? Do you...do you mind if I take a look?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “How about we pinkie swear, instead? Since we’re apparently in primary school now.”
Malfoy set the glass down and hid his hands in his lap. “I’m fine.”
Draco took another bite of the apple. “Not much for questions, Crabbe and Goyle. Or terribly astute observations.”
Hermione was talking to Potter; Draco began listening again. She seemed to be giving Potter an earful about being more careful with the curse.
“That’s good,” Harry said. “She’d probably live off of coffee for days, without you.”
Okay that's all, just wanted to say thank you!
He felt himself tearing up, and shoved the heels of his hands into his eyes. He didn’t want to cry in front of Potter; he’d embarrassed himself enough already.
“What did they do?” Draco asked, before realizing it had probably been a faux pas, asking about Potter’s childhood trauma out of the blue like that. He certainly didn’t want to talk about his own, while hungover and trying to eat.
The picture he’d taken of Draco two nights ago was still sitting on the counter. Harry reached down and picked it up, inspecting it. He’d used a wizard camera to take it, and the tiny Draco Malfoy in the picture was staring down at his shirt in disdain. When he caught Harry observing him, he raised his middle finger with a familiar smirk. He lifted the finger to his lips and blew Harry a sarcastic kiss with it.
“Yes,” Harry said again, his voice quiet.
It was Ron who finally broke the silence. “So, you...wanted to talk to me about Malfoy?” he asked incredulously.
It was 6 am on a Friday when the Aurors knocked on Harry’s door, rousing him from a nightmare wherein he was back at the Dursley’s house, and Vernon was banging furiously on the door of his cupboard.
“You hungry?” Harry asked eventually, not wanting to dig up the past.
Potter set his fork down to comb his soggy bangs off his forehead with his fingers. “So you met Kreacher, then.”
“I was thinking pancakes.”
His breaths were shallower now, stabbing in and out of his lungs, burning his throat.
He knew he was getting an earful either way, but hopefully Hermione would let him explain first.
have that back?”
“Kreacher sincerely hopes the master will enjoy his evening,” Kreacher croaked, and then went back to winding the clock. “Mocks his responsibilities, drinks like a fish, smells worse, at least the filthy blood traitor opened a window every now and again...”
He needed some way to pay Potter back, some kind of peace offering. And as Draco got out of the bath, shivering, to get dressed, the perfect idea struck him.
Draco considered. The ones he was wearing
“Maybe that’s the issue,” Potter said thoughtfully. “Consent.”
“I’m not the best with healing spells, but…” Potter wiped his forehead with his sleeve. “That was a lot harder than I thought it would be.”
Hey guys, sorry this one's kind of short and not much happens. I wanted to post something though. <3
“Would I?” Harry asked. He was pretty sure that wasn’t true--what Harry had hated most about the Death Eaters was the way they seemed to
“Did you want to do it now?” he asked finally.
“Drink?” Potter asked, raising the bottle.
“I know this is a wild idea, but you could compliment it.”
“It’s not about how a friendship starts, it’s more about keeping it going.” Harry took a sip of his drink, swallowed, hard. “Not that I’ve been much good at that lately.”
Malfoy shook his head in response, pulling his hand away.
I finally changed the title, the old one just didn't feel right. It's from the song of the same name by the Cars, if you're curious.
“That’s what they do,” Harry said. “They tie your thoughts up in knots, lead you around in circles. Make you feel like every bad thing in the world is your fault, like all of it’s coming for you at once.” He swallowed, hard, that bad taste in the back of his mouth again. He still remembered that cold, poisonous feeling, the unforgiving, viscous misery pooling in his veins. “I…I know better than to try and change your mind. But for what it’s worth, I...” he trailed off, unable to put his thoughts into words.
Draco tucked his overgrown hair behind his ears and attempted to tune out the muttering and focus. The filter was clogged with a strange green sludge, the fan blades were broken, and it was running on one power cell. No wonder the damn thing didn’t work.
Draco shrugged. “Wouldn’t say no to a Chocolate Frog or two.”
So Potter had let him sleep on the couch and elected to sleep on the floor, instead, because Draco had seemed lonely. Draco sighed, lying back down again. “You really are a saint, aren’t you, Potter?”
“Intimacy.” Malfoy was staring at the table. “Told you I’d be honest,” he added quietly.
Potter finally ripped his arm away, and Draco’s hand grasped uselessly at empty air. The pain receded, the floor came up to meet him--but Potter’s hand intervened, cradled his head.
“I’ve...sort of been thinking of you as one, I guess. Keeps me from, ya know…” he twirled a finger beside his head. “Losing my mind.”
he was talking about. “Draco…”
“How could they let such disgusting people become Aurors?” Harry wondered aloud.
Last chapter was a little crap--not trying to be disparaging about my writing, but usually my scenes have more direction than that. Anyway, hopefully this one came out better. Love you all, thanks for all the encouragement <3
“Everything’s going swimmingly,” Potter said, his voice still coldly sarcastic.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, I mean...you’re still my best mate, you know.”
“Abysmal,” Potter said. “And no, I don’t wish to elaborate.”
“Who are the Dursleys?” Draco asked, struggling to remember what Potter had told him so far as he picked up his fork.
“It’s okay, I’m the one who brought it up,” Potter said, aggressively stabbing the last of his eggs and bacon on his fork.
Draco smirked, holding an arm out to observe the lumpy, grey knitting of the jumper. “Normally I'd say I look good in a sack, but this...this might actually be worse than a sack.”
This chapter has a lot of set up, but there's some domestic fluff mixed in. Hope you enjoy <3
Draco Malfoy, was asleep on his living room floor.
Malfoy ran a finger around the rim of his mug. “How much I miss that.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Not you too,” he muttered. Did everyone who knew him assume he had a drinking problem?
a voice in Draco’s head reminded him. As he was quickly learning, that was the one thing that really set Potter off.
“Fine,” Harry said finally.
Potter smiled sardonically, washing down a mouthful of scrambled eggs with coffee. “They did worse, trust me.”
Okay, thanks for reading! hope you're all doing well <3
After a few moments, the doorknob turned, and Potter’s face peaked through the crack, green eyes crinkled in concern. When they fell on Draco, they widened, and Potter pushed the door open and stepped through. He ignored the water spilling from the tub, dropping to his knees in the puddle in front of Draco.
“I did what?” Harry spat.
Ron chuckled some more, and then his smile faded into something almost sad. “He did seem concerned though, honestly. It was...weird.”
Draco cursed himself. Maybe he shouldn’t have brought this morning up at all. How convincing did Potter expect him to be? “If you want me to pretend to care about your feelings, Potter, I’m afraid my acting skills aren’t up to the task. But as long as I’m living under your roof, I won’t insult your friends again. I swear.”
Draco looked away again. “Shouldn’t that make me
Please leave a comment if you liked, and/or tell me what your personal take on Draco's character is. I think he's really interesting. Then again, I'm a sucker for the conflicted, morally gray characters. I love what the HP series did with Harry & Draco and Dumbledore & Snape in books five, six, and seven. The way Harry looks at his mentors, peers, and enemies shifts so much in the last three books. Rowling's so good at creating character foils and subtle theming, ugh. I want to write like that someday.
They sat in silence for a long while, just drinking, before Malfoy finally slammed the bottle down on the table. “You ever used a Cruciatus Curse, Harry?”
Potter gave her a crooked but reassuring smile. “Yes, we’re alright. He’s safe, Mrs. Malfoy, I promise.”
I’ve noticed in a lot of Drarry fics, Draco is the one who’s already messed around with guys, etc, and I thought I’d switch it up for once, and have Harry be the one who’s more confident in his sexuality. Also I feel like Draco would be liable to have a lot of internalized homophobia, after his upbringing.
Harry woke slowly, his head pounding. It took him a moment to recall where he was. He’d drank himself asleep at his kitchen table last night, apparently.
A thought struck Draco that he hadn’t really considered before. The Weasleys were more or less Potter’s family. He’d been best friends with Ron, almost married Ginny. They probably felt more like family than Potter’s dead relations.
Then Potter began tucking into his chow mein again, like everything he’d just done was perfectly natural.
Harry sprang forward and wrapped his arms around her. “I’m sorry, Hermione. I’m sorry I didn’t return your calls.”
Potter took another sip of coffee, licked his lips. “Okay. Shoot.”
Potter shook his head. “Nah, I could never sell this place, not really. As much of a mess as it is, it’s all I have left of him. My godfather, I mean.”
“Just curious. Psychoanalyzing my current captor doesn’t seem like a bad idea.” In truth, Draco was just trying to figure out what made Potter tick, why he was being so damn nice. And why the Boy Who Lived, the Savior of the Wizarding World, the Chosen One who defeated Lord Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts, had such an abysmal view of himself. He’d imagined Potter would have a giant ego; the entirety of wizardkind regarded him as a legendary hero. Instead, Potter’s self esteem was in the gutter, and seemingly had been for a long time. It made sense, a little, learning about his past. Sure, he’d been a celebrity for almost as many years now, but the things that happened when a person was young had a stronger effect. Draco could attest to that. He was living proof.
“I’m awake,” came a voice from behind them.
Malfoy chuckled softly, picking up the pot to pour himself more coffee. “Some people, like you, they learn what being on the wrong side of power feels like, and it makes them kind. But other people…” he poured the rest into Harry’s mug. Harry looked up, caught his eyes.
“Alright,” Draco agreed, yawning. He followed Potter down to the kitchen, blanket wrapped around his shoulders.
“You don’t trust me?” Harry asked, keeping his voice forcedly casual and trying his best not to be offended. “I could get Hermione to do it, probably--”
“Didn’t think so,” Potter said with a sigh, and then bent his head to pick the sliver of glass out of Draco’s foot with careful fingernails by the light of his wand.
“They don’t look like they’ve gotten much better.”
Potter nodded at him, once, and refocused his attention on Draco’s bruised arm, moving his wand slightly closer.
In a way, he felt strangely responsible for Potter. Like it or not, he’d been dumped into the man’s lap, and into the center of his storm. And even though Draco knew he could never make a very good friend--or even a sorry excuse for one--he was still going to give it his best shot.
“I wasn’t kidding, I just…” Harry trailed off, embarrassed.
“Don’t mention it,” Potter replied, just as softly. He cracked his knuckles, and raised his wand.
He still couldn’t believe Potter was actually trying to
“No, I just…” Malfoy reached out slowly, and touched the cloth, running his fingers over it, face unreadable. Finally, he took it and pulled it over his head, slipping his arms through it with a wince.
Harry straightened, pulled on his coat from the back of the couch, and shouldered his backpack. “I’m going out. And when I come back,” he turned to give Malfoy one last look. “Maybe you’ll be ready to have a grown-up conversation.” And with that, he headed out the door and into the rain.
He suspected, knowing the Black family, that it did.
“It’s not you,” Malfoy said, cutting him off.
“I didn’t mean it like that…” Harry had forgotten, momentarily, that Malfoy couldn’t actually
Harry regarded him, took a sip of coffee. “What’s your favorite color?”
“Think I’ll head upstairs actually, take a bath.” In all honesty, he just wanted to be alone.
He sat on the edge of the tub to pick a chunk of glass out of his foot.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not much,” Draco said, honestly, hoping Potter would be reassured.
Malfoy considered. Harry could tell he already knew, he was just deciding whether or not he wanted Harry to know it, too. Eventually, he spoke.
“What are you thinking about?” Potter asked.
Draco extended the other arm, ignoring the rush of nerves he felt.
“It’s not a deflection,” Potter insisted. “I just want some coffee.”
it. Like I never had before. I could feel exactly how much he hated me, exactly how much pain he was in. And it was…” Malfoy shook his head. “It was the thing that finally broke me, I guess.”
(Read the ending notes if you want a sort-of content warning. It's a story about PTSD so I kind of assume we're all on board for in-depth depictions of it)
“Yeah. I’m sure you’re real concerned.”
“Would you say no to some new clothes?”
But Potter just shrugged. “Ah, I’m making it sound worse than it was. Worst they ever did was lock me up for days when they were mad at me.”
“Yes, sir, Kreacher,” the elf murmured, looking offended simply at being addressed.
Harry’s smile was crooked. “She looked like she was working herself half to death.”
Draco looked down at the glowing circle of light emanating from the wand raised between them. “You’ve done enough, honestly.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I hate you,” Potter continued. “But I’m not the type of guy to…break someone’s damn nose when they can’t defend themselves.”
Anyway, hope you enjoy!
Draco leaned back to eye the grandfather clock in the hall. “Potter, it’s two in the afternoon.”
“Well, eventually, when I was a teenager. When I was a kid, they used to lock me in this broom cupboard under the stairs--you don’t wanna hear me go on about it,” he finished hurriedly, taking a large bite of bacon.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, coffee cooling, forgotten on the table. He didn’t want to tell Malfoy he was wrong--Malfoy was talking about his experiences, and he had a right to feel any which way about them. Harry didn’t want to attack his perspective, but it was still a dismal one, and one Harry disagreed with.
Potter rose. “You’re not going to do anything stupid, are you?”
“But that’s…irresponsible, I mean, isn’t the Ministry supposed to protect people in their custody?”
“No, let’s talk about it." Harry took a deep, steadying breath. If Ron was angry with him, Harry didn't want him to go on hiding it. "Like I said, I’ll apologize as many times as you want me to, I know I--”
“Worried I’m going to off myself?” Malfoy reached behind him and tossed one of the Ministry parchments to Harry. He wore a particularly nasty version of his usual smirk. “Apparently I couldn’t, even if I wanted to. Learned that, tonight. Not only can I not harm you, I can’t harm myself, either.” He laughed bitterly. “I’m stuck between Azkaban and basically being enslaved to my good old friend Harry Potter, and I can’t even take the third door out.”
“Wouldn’t say no to some toast,” Potter conceded, and Draco headed down the stairs to the kitchen to make him some.
Potter spun. “Ron?” He ran up to the living room, and Draco followed him. The orange head of a Weasley was coming to a spinning stop in the fireplace.
“Thank you, Mrs. Granger. At your earliest convenience, of course.” Malfoy came closer to stand beside the couch, his gaze fixed on the floor. “I hope you’ll accept my deepest apologies for any offenses I may have caused you in the past. If there’s any way I can make it up to you, I sincerely hope you’ll tell me.” He paused, and looked Hermione in the eyes. “I wouldn’t dare ask you to forgive me, but I hope that any grudges you may rightfully hold, you will not extend them to my mother.”
“They never contacted me,” Harry said, nonplussed.
“You’re wrong, Malfoy. I know how to control myself. But it seems you still haven’t even learned manners.”
Harry hovered uncertainly for a moment. Malfoy was so injured; he wanted to do
Harry said, affectionately, dropping to a seat in front of the fire.
“I’ll go back to ‘keeping the estate,’ then,” Harry said, hoisting the empty bottle in his hand. “Enjoy my booze, you old creep.”
Harry wrapped his fingers around his mug, not sure what to say. He wondered, not for the first time, what Malfoy’s motives had been, joining Voldemort, how much a choice he’d really had. How much of a choice Narcissa had had, for that matter.
Potter rubbed his eyes tiredly. “You’re probably the closest thing I’ve got left too, at this point.”
Draco watched him leave, and then rose to clean the kitchen. It was the least he could do, if Potter were really buying him clothes. And it was a nice distraction from how much he hated himself.
Corbyn’s voice had been sneering, as usual, and Draco felt as if he could hear it, even now. He remembered the feeling of dread twisting his guts at that statement--at the time, he’d figured it was close to the worst case scenario, having Harry Potter hold his contract.
It was then that Draco realized he had yet to inquire about Kreacher. “Oh, I forgot to mention, Potter,” he said, unsure how to even broach the subject, “You...you do know you have a deranged house elf living in your basement, right?”
Harry corked the liquor reluctantly and cracked his knuckles, staring down at his hands. It was time to admit he was out of his depth.
“Well there must have been some kind of mistake. Wherever you found that heap of self-aggrandizing dragon dung, take him back.”
They both leaned down to stare at Potter’s hand. Sure enough, a small, white rune was etched into Potter’s skin. Potter removed his fingers from Draco’s arm, and the rune disappeared.
“You’re living in my house, I have a right to ask what you’re up to. And I didn’t look at what you were writing, and I’m not going to. I’m just curious why you’re up so late, reading a bunch of dry old spell books.”
They smiled about that for a moment, and then settled into an awkward silence.
“I mean, they never tried to kill me, or torture me, so…” Potter ran a hand through his hair, finally abandoning his fork to stare into his coffee.
“No,” Malfoy answered flatly. “You gonna give me a drink?”
Draco had lied to Potter earlier, about Corbyn’s wife--he hadn’t just guessed, he’d known. Draco remembered her. She’d been a muggle sympathizer, blonde, with big brown eyes, wearing a purple Muggle-made jumper with cats on it beneath her robes. Bellatrix had hurt her, just for the fun of it, and Draco could still remember standing in the living room, staring at himself in the mirror, as the screams echoed off the walls of his childhood home. He remembered Corbyn’s wife sobbing, crying, begging for help. And he remembered wishing he could do something, anything, but simply standing there, unwilling to watch but unable to stop it.
But even if he’d been lost in the midst of the worst kind of nightmare, Malfoy’s reaction had been…dramatic. Harry didn’t want to think about what Malfoy had woken up to in the past, to have
“A potions master in the making, it would seem,” Malfoy said sardonically.
“Slow down,” Harry said, standing and reaching for the whiskey. They stood there for a moment, both of them holding onto the bottle. Malfoy finally relinquished his grip.
“I was tired of freezing my arse off.” Draco sat up and shrugged, as if it had been easy. It hadn’t been; he’d had to go looking through the crates for spare parts for the fan, and he’d cut his hands more than once.
The doorbell rang again.
certain he wasn’t--Draco’s own powerlessness still sent shivers down his spine. Every time Potter so much as reached for his wand, Draco braced for the worst, every muscle tense and his mind scrambling in all directions. He wasn’t sure he could willingly allow Potter to raise it at him, or stay still long enough for Potter to heal him.
Malfoy turned back from the stove, twirling the spatula in his hand. “Better, I guess.”
Harry twisted the scroll in his hands. He had all the power he didn’t want in this situation, and no ability to do the things he
What if this really were all in his head? What if it was still that night before he’d left for Potter’s house, when he’d been lying on his back, stomach hollowed out with hunger, thoughts racing?
Potter finally dropped a plate of bacon, eggs, and toast in front of him with a proud smile. “There. Not even I can muck this up. Made it for the Dursleys a hundred times.”
“There’s a reason Hermione’s a Gryffindor, not a Ravenclaw. If there’s one thing she cares about, it’s equal rights and social justice, believe me. Do you have any idea how many times Kreacher called her an M-word? And she still defended him, said he wasn’t right in the head and he should be freed. Trust me, she’ll help.” He looked up at Draco. “We’ll find a way to break this curse. I promise.”
She’d said ten am--it was barely nine forty-five and Harry was already seated on the couch, waiting. Malfoy had been falling asleep sitting up, so he’d gone upstairs for a nap. Harry figured this would all go smoother that way, in any event, so he could fully explain the situation to Hermione before she saw Malfoy.
Malfoy took a sip of coffee, his expression carefully placid once again. “Can I make them?”
“You asked me, before,” Potter began, sounding thoughtful, “Why I assumed my friends wouldn’t forgive me. So let me ask you something. Why do you assume people only interact with you as a way of ‘getting something’?”
Thanks for reading! Please leave me a comment, they mean the world <3
Harry looked up at him carefully, raised an eyebrow.
He even suspected, in the darker parts of his thoughts, that Potter was simply waiting for his moment, waiting for Draco to heal a bit, before he really started having fun. But then why the little kindnesses, here and there? The ones that seemed almost inconsequential, but that Draco couldn’t get out of his head?
Draco watched Potter as he left, feeling strangely more fond of him in that moment than he had since he’d arrived at the House of Black. He looked down at his foot, wrapped in messy gauze and medical tape.
Draco held his eyes, keeping his expression casual, almost impatient. Truthfully, giving the jumper back was proving to be harder than he thought. He wasn’t too much colder without it, but he was somehow...lonelier. The jumper had become a sort of warm, enveloping hug in the past 24 hours, a small comfort in a time of great stress, and now, if he were being honest, as ugly as the thing was, he was loath to part with it.
“It is hideous, isn’t it?” Malfoy put in. “Thank you, Hermione.”
There was nothing, nothing for him. Nothing to his back but pain, nothing ahead of him but anger.
Malfoy jolted awake at his touch and scrambled away until his back hit the couch. He was panting, his eyes wide and scared like a fox cornered by dogs, his arms up to protect himself from an imagined attack.
It helped, a little, and Draco could feel himself getting closer to the surface. He gripped Potter’s arm harder.
“So when the Aurors showed up I signed him over to my name and now I can put him under the Imperius Curse with a snap of my fingers, hell, I can torture him, I can kill him just as easily--”
Draco considered. He’d really rather get it over with, and not have to work up his nerve again. And now that everything else was healed, the bruises around his neck felt even heavier, making it hard to breathe. But he felt like it was asking for too much.
“Excuse me, I’m talking to you,” Draco said, interrupting the elf’s rambling.
Draco forced himself to meet Potter’s eyes again. “Only one way to find out,” he said, wondering if Potter would rise to the challenge. From what Draco had seen thus far, Potter didn’t have it in him to rip Draco’s clothes off of him, no matter how curious he was.
“Is that all?” Harry asked.
Hope you enjoy this one!
“Well, If I learned anything in therapy--”
Ron tilted his head to the side, looking Potter up and down pointedly. “I’m sorry, do I know you?”
After sitting there staring at Malfoy for a while, trying to convince himself this was reality, Harry decided that coffee was probably still a good idea, and rose as quietly as he could.
“Sorry,” Potter muttered finally. “Can’t uh…think of the spell.”
“Yeah, I…I guess it does.” Potter readjusted his glasses and his jumper. “Um, come on, now that you can walk.”
he whispered.
Potter shook his head. “Draco hurt me, by accident, and the curse hurt him. It really
Okay, thanks for reading!
Ron snorted softly. “I know you might find it shocking, but not everyone in this world is as selfish as you. Some of us don’t use our power to push other people down. And I didn’t spend seven years fighting evil just to turn right around and become it.”
Walking gingerly back into the bedroom, trying not to trail blood on the floor, Draco dug through the drawers of the dresser and found a couple pairs of musty socks to slip on his feet. The last thing he wanted to do at the moment was face Potter—not only was he still mortified after everything that had happened today, but the pain he’d felt from simply grabbing Potter’s wrist too hard was still fresh in his mind. Potter could make him feel that again, for as long as he liked, and it would be terrifyingly easy. He wouldn’t even need to put any effort behind it, not like a Cruciatus Curse. The runes would do all the work for him.
“Why? I called her a M--” Draco cut himself off. “I called her a lot of things. Why on earth would she help?”
Anyway, as always, please leave a comment, they make my day.
He sank back down onto the couch, wrapping his arms around himself. Just another nightmare. It was already fading, all he could remember was a dark, hooded shape chasing him through a maze-like forest at night as he ran for his life, tripping on roots and snakes. The dream felt like the ghost of a memory, and Harry had a sick taste in the back of his mouth.
Secondly, Kreacher is like one of my top ten favorite characters in Harry Potter, so there will definitely be more of him. I was trying to keep him like in the books, just a little more senile. Hopefully I did a decent job of writing him.
They shared a long, significant look, until Harry finally looked away.
his fault, it was mine, I should have thought--”
Draco shut his eyes, raised the apple to his mouth, and bit into it slowly. His expression was one of pure bliss as he licked juice from his lips.
Harry chuckled softly and flopped down on the couch next to her, already feeling strangely calm. It was nice, so nice, seeing her again. Then he remembered the conversation he needed to have, and his nerves flooded back.
“But he activated the contract yesterday,” Corbyn said, obviously displeased.
He picked up the spatula, scraping the pancakes off the bottom of the pan and flipping them onto a plate. The bottoms of them were dark brown, almost black in some spots.
Potter took a seat and began digging into his own plate. He looked up after a few bites.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, feeling exhausted. He could only imagine how Malfoy must feel. “You should get some rest.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shrugged. “I don’t mind. I used to eat the burnt ones, when I lived with the Dursleys.”
Potter lowered his mug, looking almost offended. “It’s my house, I’m not going to make you sleep on the floor.”
be drunk, if he was letting Harry do this. They reached the top, and Harry half-walked, half-hauled Malfoy to the couch, and let him drop. He crammed a pillow beneath Malfoy’s blond head.
Precisely a minute before ten, there was a soft knock on the door. Harry leapt off the couch and then hesitated, working up his nerve. He took a deep breath, and swung the door open.
It took Draco a moment to understand what Kreacher was talking about. “What...the runes? You know them?”
Draco must have allowed his state of mind to cloud his expression, he realized, still staring down. He’d shown a shameful amount of vulnerability already, but at every turn, Potter had responded with sympathy rather than derision. Draco tried to bite back his thoughts from slipping past his lips, but it had been far too long since he’d had someone to open up to. Someone who called themselves his friend, and followed through.
“Keep your shirt on, I’m not about to pull out the M-word. I’m not that suicidal.” He smirked. “Not yet, at least.” He looked back up at Harry. “Anyway, Hermione. Why don’t you ask her?”
“Well, you seem pretty comfortable pushing all your friends away and drowning your problems in a bottle.”
“Are you through yet?” Draco asked for at least the fifth time, even though Potter clearly wasn’t.
“My mother looks well,” Draco said. “...Cheers, Hermione.” He was too shaken up to be more eloquent than that.
Potter was silent for a long moment. Then he spoke, his words cautious. “Are you actually apologizing, Malfoy, or just telling me what I want to hear?”
Draco held his breath. He hadn’t thought that his behavior might be considered, and that Potter would be the one judging it. He was pretty sure he’d earned a Troll grade for ‘behavior,’ especially after the temper tantrum he’d thrown yesterday. And besides that, all he’d done so far was do his damndest to piss Potter off. And pissing people off was, unfortunately, one of his best skills.
Malfoy drank the potion just as fast, drinking almost half the bottle before Harry snatched it back from him, getting worried. Harry sat down at the kitchen table across from him.
Kreacher studied the chains, and then the marks. Eventually, he looked back up. “Kreacher agrees to the deal. Kreacher will fetch what you need.”
“That’s for doors, you dimwit.”
Potter snorted softly. “If you put a dent in my wall, I swear…”
Potter winced. “They weren’t great. But at least they kept me alive.”
The Auror held up the half-crumpled parchment Harry had returned to him. He tapped a line at the bottom.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter gave him a bemused half-smile. “I hope you accept Chinese food as payment for maintenance, cause that’s what I’ve got.”
Harry winced internally. It didn’t sound like Draco had accepted that he didn’t need to be better than everyone around him—it sounded like he’d simply decided he was garbage. Harry would almost prefer to see Draco go back to his old arrogance, rather than the look of self-disgust that lurked in his eyes now, but there had to be some kind of middle ground.
Get ready to witness some of the most awkward kitchen table small talk you've ever seen lol
Malfoy gripped the spatula tighter, ignoring the batter as it popped and bubbled behind him. He was silent for so long, Harry had started to accept he wasn’t getting an answer. But then, Malfoy spoke.
Potter was still looking up at him, one hand in his pocket, the other hand hovering over Draco’s socked foot.
Ron narrowed his eyes at Harry, and then his face split into a grin. “Hey, you git,” he said, raising the can at Harry.
Draco’s face was pale in the firelight, his eyes wide. “That’s...that must have been…” He looked away, shut his eyes. “I can’t imagine being in his head.”
wanted. Like free Malfoy, or end the whole program, or reform Azkaban. It was infuriating. Trust the Ministry to come up with something this twisted.
Draco ran a finger over the cuts. They’d scabbed over, but whatever curse Corbyn had used prevented them from fully healing. They were swollen, the edges of them a sickly yellow. They looked almost infected, and some part of Draco knew they’d scar, no matter how they were healed. Maybe it was better that way. Maybe Corbyn was right, and they were a good reminder of what he was.
“Yeah,” Malfoy muttered, extending a hand. “Can I
Malfoy was silent.
And after all that, Potter had given him the couch? Draco had been so drunk, he would have passed out at the kitchen table.
Well we finally know what Corbyn did to Draco now, which I think some of you guessed, and Harry gets a closer look at Draco's guilt. And then...Draco gets overwhelmed and turns back to his old ways for a minute. Like everyone says, recovery ain't linear.
“If I could borrow those scissors you talked about, though, I’d like to cut my hair,” he said finally.
“You’re right. I’m sorry I said anything, okay? Just…Stay out of my business, and I’ll stay out of yours. Deal?”
“Alright,” Harry said, leaning back in his chair again. “I can wait.”
Even if Potter wasn’t going to take advantage of the power he held--which Draco was
“You were right, I shouldn’t have dragged Ginny into this. I apologize. It won’t happen again.”
“What the hell do you want with my mother, Potter?”
“Draco Malfoy is kind of my prisoner.” That could have been phrased better.
“I want to.”
“Well, you do still have a horde of cursed objects of dubious origins downstairs, guarded by an alcoholic house elf with no idea what year it is...”
“...Safe, you’re okay, you’re at number 12 Grimmauld Place in London, your name is Draco Lucius Malfoy, you’re safe, it’s three pm on a Sunday, December second, you’re okay…”
Ron looked back down at his shoes, and when he spoke, it was almost in a whisper. “Take care of him for me, will ya?”
“Oy,” said Harry, before the Auror could land his blow. “He’s in my custody now, right? By my reckoning, that means if anybody’s kicking him, it’ll be me.”
Harry wracked his brain for a moment. All he could think of was drinking.
“Just me being pathetic, ignore me, please,” Draco replied, his tone forcedly casual with that familiar grate of self-disgust beneath it.
Harry looked at the fire, watching the flames spread over the fresh log. “Dementors. Snakes. Godric’s Hollow—where my parents lived, in the snow. Hogwarts, but it’s empty. A...a graveyard.” He shivered, remembering that night, the ghosts of his mother and father, Cedric’s corpse, Voldemort’s shrivelled body. He ran a hand over the scar on his forehead. “I used to dream about Voldemort, about what he saw, what he felt. Sometimes the nightmares are...sort of like that.”
“What about you?” Draco asked softly. “What do you dream about?”
Potter ran a hand through his hair, turned the tub off with a wave of his wand. “It doesn’t matter what I tell you. You have to forgive yourself.”
“Neither was yours.”
“What, sex?”
This was at least the tenth time they’d had this conversation; Harry was certain his words would be disregarded, yet again. He couldn’t really begrudge Kreacher his habits, he supposed. After this many years, he was set in his ways.
“Now?” Malfoy looked back at him, with a rather sick smirk. “Now the fun begins.”
Hermione wrapped her hands around her mug. “Just be his friend, Harry. You’ve always been good at that.” She held up a hand when Harry tried to retort that he
“I’m not, I--I’m just curious. Did he hurt you?”
why you called me,” Ron said, pointing a finger at Harry in mock accusation. “I should have known.”
Draco flexed the arm, rolled the joint. “I’d rather just...get it over with, if that’s alright with you.”
He knew Hermione wouldn’t be pleased about any of this, and he didn’t need the situation worsening by her thinking
*My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic theme song plays in the background*
He opened the door to a very odd sight indeed. Two Aurors, dressed in their ministry robes, holding a tattered looking man between them. Harry was reminded of Sirius Black, if Sirius had been in the habit of bleaching his hair Marilyn Monroe blond.
Draco heard a muffled voice behind Ron’s head, and then Ron was yanked out of the fireplace and replaced by Hermione. Draco stepped a little closer.
Draco sighed tiredly. “And I can’t even make pancakes without scorching them to a crisp, apparently.”
“What’s your favorite memory?”
“Oy,” Harry said. “Stealing my alcohol again, are you?”
They stared at each other awkwardly for a moment, both of them clearly thinking of last night.
dammit, but he was too exhausted to be convincing. Besides, Potter could always just use Legilimency on him. Potter wasn’t good at it, but Draco couldn’t perform Occlumency. The curse he was under wouldn’t allow him to hide things from his captor.
“It’s a spit pact,” Potter said, as if it were something everyone did. “Me and Ron used to do it. C’mon, it’s not official until it’s a spit pact.” He was smiling now, looking amused.
Potter bit his lip, lost in thought. “I told you...Ginny, she left...right?”
Harry huffed a sigh of frustration. “Stop saying you
Malfoy huffed. “No offense, Potter, but you’re not exactly gifted in the culinary arts.”
Potter, how do you drink that?”
“I’m the one who hurt you--” Draco protested.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. “I know that.”
I feel like this chapter sucks but I feel that way about every chapter so who knows. The next one will probably be fluffier cause it's been a hell of a week and I'm in the mood to write something happy.
Draco looked away, cheeks warming as he realized he’d been staring. He’d just been bored, waiting for Potter to be done, he told himself. That was it.
Malfoy hesitated, for just a second. “Getting sorted at Hogwarts,” he answered.
Draco finally began pouring pancakes, brow furrowed in concentration.
“Of course.” Corbyn offered Potter an officious smile from thin lips. “How would you rate your level of satisfaction with the program so far?”
Potter shook his head, an absentminded, worried hand in his hair. “I’m not going to...remove your clothing without your consent.”
Draco wet his lips, and nodded, feeling as if he were diving underwater. Something about Potter taking his sock off, touching an injury, felt very intimate. And giving someone else his trust felt alien, and wrong, like a shirt he hadn’t worn in a while, that had become too tight around the chest. Draco breathed shortly and deliberately, as if he were taking sips of water.
“You mean…” Harry felt a shiver run down his spine, voice breathless. “The Dementors are back at Azkaban?”
“It’s my turn to ask you a question, isn’t it?” Malfoy said, sawing off another bite of pancake with the side of his fork. “If there were a room with a hundred dicks on the wall, how many would you choke on?”
It was a fair point. “I learned it. The hard way.” Harry took a sip of whiskey, enjoying the way it burned, the way it warmed him. His hands felt cold on the bottle. “And I’m not a kid, anymore.” He stared at Malfoy until Malfoy met his eyes. “Whatever you told me, Malfoy, I wouldn’t hurt you for it. That much I swear.”
Malfoy took a bite of toast and chewed slowly before answering. “I think it’s clear even to someone as thick as you, you don’t need my consent to do anything. But if you work magic on me without it—“ Malfoy locked eyes with him, his gaze suddenly cold as gunmetal. “Consider any civility between us officially ended. For good.”
“Mr. Potter,” the Auror on the left said, a tall, skinny man with dark hair. “We’ve come on direct orders from the ministry, to deliver prisoner #6583-9K into your custody, as agreed.” He held up a remarkably official-seeming document with a flourish.
“I haven’t decided yet,” Ron replied, “Probably both.”
“Alright,” Harry agreed, as Hermione was already heading for the door, checking her watch.
“Oh, sorry, I was too busy being tortured to visit the barber,” Malfoy said, taking another sip of coffee.
“Malfoy said that about me?” Harry felt his eyes widening, trying to imagine that.
“That was a terrible deflection, Potter, even for you.”
“We’ll see how long it stays that way,” Malfoy muttered darkly.
“Just doing some light reading,” Malfoy said casually, restacking one of the books he’d been looking at and surreptitiously tucking a parchment he’d been writing on within it. “What are you doing up?”
“I mean, really. Your very favorite.”
?” Draco asked, keeping his voice carefully casual.
Draco looked up at him in surprise. “Are you sure you can manage it?”
Harry took a drink, and passed the bottle back to Malfoy. “Drink it...slower,” he finished with a sigh, as Malfoy was chugging it again. He was beginning to suspect there was a little more to it, something he was missing.
“So,” Draco began cautiously, doing his best not to look nervous, “If you’re not going to send me back to Azkaban, what are you going to do?”
Hermione gave him a fond smile. “When was the last time you showered?”
“The lowlife is busting into Kreacher’s room, going to rifle through Kreacher’s things with his grubby fingers, the master will be furious--”
“Harry…”
“’Muggle’ seems to be the operative word around here,” Malfoy said.
“What are you looking at?” Harry all but snapped. He was already sick of having Malfoy in his house, and it hadn’t even been an hour.
Anyway as always please leave your thoughts <3 thanks for reading
“Old magic,” Draco replied.
“There’s certain prisoners that everyone wants, everyone’s clamoring for the higher-up Death Eaters, for instance.” Hermione curled a braid around her finger as she spoke, her face a mixture of exasperation and disgust. She looked like she’d gotten used to both emotions in the past few months. “And now, they’re letting people who ‘donate’ to the program pick who they want--the higher the donation, the higher up in line you go, of course.” She gave Harry a cynical half-smile, looking tired. “It’s monetary nepotism at its finest.”
“I will, I will,” Harry said.
His fire had died hours ago, and he had chills rising on his arms, but at least the house wasn’t ice cold anymore, thanks to Malfoy. He got up to get a glass of water, picking his well-worn path through take-out boxes and empty bottles in the pitch-black room. As he passed the staircase to the upstairs, he glimpsed a soft light coming down the hall.
The idea of Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, being friends with a former Death Eater was laughable. But Draco didn’t feel like laughing, watching Potter stare into the flames.
“Don’t mention it.” Potter took his glasses off to rub his eyes, looking even more exhausted now. “I need a drink.”
Kreacher shook his head. “No, no, the lowlife thinks he’ll escape, but no, not from these. The rats may crawl into the gutters but you, you’re stuck in a trap. You’ll have to gnaw off your own tail, filthy little rodent--”
“Oh, sorry, were you planning on doing it some time in the next few years?”
He looked down at his new prisoner. “What now?”
“Yeah, how dare you bleed on my floors, Malfoy, they were so clean before…” Potter said sarcastically, kneeling next to Draco’s foot. “You must’ve gotten glass in it,” he said, reaching into his pocket for his wand absentmindedly as he spoke. Then he froze, looking up at Draco. “I’m just going to cast a
“What’s yours, then?”
As Malfoy continued to argue with the Auror, Harry glanced down and studied him, looking past his initial shock of recognition. Malfoy looked…awful. His eyes were sunken and glassy, the bones in his wrist and neck sticking out beneath his tattered shirt, and his skin was pale, pale as parchment and littered with dark, startling bruises like blotches of ink. He’d obviously been abused, and underfed, and he looked like he hadn’t seen the sun in years. But the Malfoy he knew would probably prefer that to being within a hundred miles of Harry Potter.
“It’s not fine,” Harry retorted, shaking his head. “I never meant to hurt you, or Hermione. I swear, I just…”
Malfoy was tense again, jaw clenched, shoulders rounded. “You ever consider my mother is none of your business?”
Last chapter was mostly fluff, this one is mostly angst (the universe has to remain in balance, after all)
The knock came again, more insistent this time. Draco rose unsteadily and walked to the door, peering through the peephole. He saw ginger hair and a freckled face staring back at him. Ron Weasley, holding an armful of books.
Thanks for reading this far. Leave a comment?
“Rehabilitation Welfare Check,” Corbyn said, his voice deep and cold as an abandoned well. Just that voice made Draco’s stomach coil. Corbyn looked over Potter’s shoulder at Draco, running his thick fingers over his bald scalp with a smile that made Draco feel sick. “Miss me?” he said quietly.
“You really...don’t have to
Draco just kept shaking his head, unable to speak. He couldn’t say it out loud, the guilt that hung around his neck like an albatross. He could usually push it away, distance himself from it, but at the moment he felt its full weight, heavy as a stone in the pit of his stomach.
Kreacher returned, handed him a half empty power cell. “Here, Kreacher hopes this is what you need, Kreacher has nothing else you would want, no, no…”
Potter folded his arms. “I’m not
“The runic bond activated yesterday, of its own accord, meaning the prisoner stepped out of line." Reynolds gave Draco a suspicious glare. "We just wanted to make sure everything was alright.”
“That was Corbyn,” Malfoy said tiredly, dropping his head into his hands.
Potter to heal him felt like showing weakness, felt like letting someone in, opening the door on all the hurt and pain he’d kept locked away behind his eyes, squeezed tight in his fists, shoved down to the bottom of the deep black pit in his stomach. The thought made Draco sick, just like all of the flinches, the tears, the moments of panic and fury and self-hatred he’d allowed Potter to witness. In a way, he’d almost
Harry accepted it but didn’t drink, cradling the cold glass in his palm. “I can’t imagine how bad the nightmares must get, after Azkaban.”
“Okay.” Potter removed his wand from his pocket slowly, but didn’t raise it, instead holding it in his lap. “Start with the wrist, then? I’m just going to use the simplest healing spell I know.”
Harry. And we got through it all together. So stop trying to do this alone.”
‘Gloomy,’ had been their code word, during the war, when things were going very, very wrong. “No, mum, I promise. Not gloomy at all.”
An alternate title for this chapter is "Harry finally gets fed up with Draco's shit," haha. I didn't want Harry to be too much of a jerk though. I'm not going to lie, that argument was hard to write, I rewrote it more than once. Tell me what you thought?
They both chuckled about that idea, and then Harry came up with another question.
Potter slipped off the couch to sit on the floor beside him. “It’s okay, you know, we can wait...we can just sit here and complain about the weather, if you like…”
“Relax,” Potter interrupted him, holding up his palms. “Do you see me reaching for my wand? I’m just saying, maybe that’s what bothers you. Giving me permission.”
Draco fisted his hands. More words began falling from his lips, unbidden. “I was certain you were going to torture me, when I first got here. But now, I really...I don’t think you are. I don’t even think you want to, honestly.” He squeezed his fists tighter. The shakes spread, from his fingers up his arms. “So
Harry was struck by a thought. “Surely your mother would.”
And then the searing pain hit him, running up his arms and into his chest, squeezing at his heart, like fingers of liquid fire. Draco’s whole body shook, his fingers squeezed tighter, as fireworks of agony exploded behind his eyes.
He hadn’t suspected he was opening such a messy can of worms, suggesting he and Draco were friends. But considering Draco didn’t have any, these days, perhaps Harry ought to have expected it, in hindsight. And he had to admit, he felt a little strange himself, calling his old enemy a friend. But Draco looked like he could use one.
Harry bit his lip. “Not sure Ron’s the best to talk to about...emotions. Especially Draco Malfoy’s.”
Kreacher’s expression twisted into one of distaste. “Kreacher belongs to the House of Black. The House of Black belongs to...
Draco’s throat felt like it was closing; sucking in the cold air was becoming painful. He could feel his pulse racing in his neck. What was he supposed to say to that?
“More or less,” Draco said, wiggling his toes. “Thanks.” His voice came out husky. Potter’s concern still felt strange, and his technique could probably use some work, but Draco had to admit his foot
Harry wrapped his fingers back around the cold glass of the bottle. “It won’t help anyone, hating yourself. I know it becomes comfortable, after a while, but it doesn’t help.”
“Is that your excuse then?” Harry asked, guessing Malfoy was talking about himself.
“I’m sorry--” Potter began, but Ron cut him off again.
“You just assume they’re all going to be furious with you, and yeah, they probably were annoyed, at first. But you were friends for over seven years, you lived together, you defeated a dark wizard together. And you’re clearly in a bad way,” he added, gesturing at Potter’s wrinkled, dirty attire and thin form. “You think your friends don’t have any self-restraint? Any patience? Any compassion?”
Draco was silent. He dropped his hands from his face; a tear escaped from his lashes and rolled down his cheek. He wiped his eyes, swore. “I don’t even have a right to cry. I’m not the one who got hurt.”
“I don’t think anything I told you would change your mind,” Potter said. “But maybe I can prove you wrong, eventually.”
“Alright…” Harry said, starting to get a suspicious feeling in his stomach.
Hope you guys liked Hermione! Someone buy the poor woman a cup of coffee, lol, she's been through enough already.
“So you decided to, what, alphabetize the Black family library?” There seemed to be more books stacked around Malfoy than there were on the shelves.
He came back from the kitchen a little while later, carrying coffee and toast for two. Malfoy still looked horribly malnourished, and if the man was going to be his responsibility for the time being, Harry was at the very least going to feed him.
“He’s in my custody, I’ll be the judge of that.” Potter was sounding more irritated with every second that passed.
Draco felt that soft, warm feeling swelling in his heart again, rising in his throat, and swallowed it. “Hey, yourself.”
And Corbyn had leaned back down, ignoring the cries of pain escaping from Draco’s clenched teeth, and carved a word.
You tell me I don’t deserve it, all of this…” There were tears welling up in his eyes. “I just couldn’t take it. Couldn’t take the way you’d look at me, if you saw me...saw me the way I see myself.”
“Uh, yeah.” Harry ran his fingers through the back of his hair, tugging on it. “He’s just...really depressed, and…” Harry trailed off, faltering.
He was hesitating too long. He needed to say something. He could feel his neck getting hot.
“Don’t push your luck, Potter.” Despite his words, Draco felt the corner of his mouth turning up in a smile. “On a scale of one to food, it’s definitely food, I’ll give it that. Can’t say the same for...what was it? Bull-lone-ya?”
“One more thing,” Harry said hurriedly. “The curse, that keeps people imprisoned, have you any idea yet how to break it?”
Potter, I swear…”
Once he had it, he stood, and turned back to the kitchen sink to wet a rag, stowing his wand with a quiet “
More Harry angst, hope you enjoyed.
Draco couldn’t meet his eyes. He lowered his empty stare to the floor.
Potter was in the kitchen, his back turned, stirring something on the stove and humming to himself. There was an open bottle of brown Muggle liquor beside him on the counter. Great. To make matters worse, Potter was drinking again. He’d been calm the last time Draco had seen him intoxicated, hopefully that behavior remained consistent.
“You do know,” Malfoy said, “If I had ever gotten the opportunity to make you miserable, I would have seized it with both hands.”
“I’m coming in, unless you say something,” Potter said, through the door.
“My fault, really,” Draco said, cutting him off.
“Thanks, for um…” Draco cleared his throat. “Coming by.”
Harry leaned back in his chair, watching Draco fiddle with the stove knobs, muttering about inconsistent heating every time Harry heckled him over how long it was taking.
Harry sighed, looking down at his wet knees. “You’re not a killer, Draco. I saw you, on the tower, with Dumbledore. Even though you thought you’d be killed, you weren’t going to kill him. You were lowering your wand.”
“Yes, I know, I’m so, so sorry, it was...a stressful situation--”
“You can hurt yourself, though. Are you going to?”
Potter rolled his eyes a little, and finally folded the last parchment. “Well, it’s not much, but at least we know it’s related to the curse they used to use on house-elves.” Potter leaned back, removed his glasses to rub his eyes. “You said Kreacher recognized the runes?”
Draco opened his mouth, and shut it again. “Nightmares,” he admitted finally.
“How was it?” Malfoy raised a suggestive eyebrow.
Harry shook his head.
Draco’s face looked pained, for a fleeting moment. Then he huffed. “I can’t let you eat these. My pride couldn’t take it.”
“It used to be related to blood magic,” Draco cut in. “But I think the Ministry has related it to something else, something else to bind people. I was thinking about the fact that I can’t leave Potter’s property, and I realized that back in the old days, wizarding families like mine, or the Blacks, would mark their territory with blood magic, to prevent trespassers. But now, I mean, Potter got the House of Black in a will from his godfather, so how does the curse know?”
Thanks for reading, and as always, please tell me what you thought!
“Whatcha up to?” Harry asked.
Ron opened his mouth, and then shut it again, hesitating. “Friends like Harry are hard to come by,” he said hoarsely.
“And anyway, you did get hurt. From what you’ve told me, you went through hell.”
Unable to conjure a way to make the situation less awkward, Harry simply turned, walked into the kitchen, and, ignoring the broken dishes on the floor, buried his head in the refrigerator. It was…sparse. He realized he hadn’t gone grocery shopping in a couple weeks. There was nothing but pickles, mustard, bologna, and some mayonnaise that had gone off long ago. Thankfully, he still had some bread in the freezer, and so he pulled it out and began making a sandwich. Malfoy hovered in the doorway, watching him.
“I want to,” Potter repeated, with more conviction this time. “But only if it’s okay with you.”
Draco shrugged. “You’re still feeding me. I’m not going out of my way to insult your cooking.”
“He was right, for once. You’re the kind of guy to care about anybody who’s hurting, even if they’re your worst enemy.” Ron scratched the back of his neck, staring at the label on the can in his hand. “Can’t believe I’m about to say something this cheesy, but...ah, hell, if you care, Harry, I care too.”
“She’s married to Ron. And I figured she’d be mad at me, too. Besides, they had both tried to help me, too, just like Ginny. But I didn’t want help, back then.” Potter took a deep breath, spat his words out almost painfully. “So no, I don’t think any of them want to see my face.”
throbbing fiercely. But looking at the wand in Potter’s hand, Draco’s nerve left him. He didn’t care how bad his injuries were, he didn’t want his captor pointing a wand at him and casting spells.
“I’d prefer if you didn’t,” Malfoy said carefully. “But as I said, you can do as you wish.”
Harry bit his lip. “Cheers, Hermione, but...I’m a little out of my depth.”
“For Muggles, I’m guessing.” Draco opened the package and hoisted a slice of bologna into the air with the tips of his fingers. “It looks like someone ground up the wrong end of a rat and turned it into a meat pancake.”
Potter opened his mouth to speak.
But then Malfoy broke the silence himself. “You know, back in third year, I never really understood what bothered you so much. About the Dementors, I mean.” Malfoy took a deep breath, scrubbed a hand over his face with a sharp wince. “But now I get it,” he continued. “Let’s just say, if they want to torture me, they have plenty of memories to choose from now.”
“Nothing, really,” Draco said hurriedly. “But a friend is a valuable thing to lose.” He swallowed, hard. “Take it from someone who has none.”
The coffee maker burbled to a stop, and Harry jumped. He rose, getting two mugs down, and pouring a couple heaping spoons of the sugar he’d bought yesterday into one of them, with a fond half smile still lingering on his face.
“No. Like I said, I’m not overly fond of anything in this house. Although you did probably muck up the resale value a bit.”
Harry snorted. “I highly doubt it.”
Potter had surprised him. He hadn’t thought that was possible. Draco had prepared himself for whatever torture and mistreatment Potter could come up with, steeled himself for nothing but vindictiveness and derision. The one thing he hadn’t expected from Potter was self-restraint. And...what, concern?
Draco tried to command his brain to
. He wasn’t sure he was ready to bereft himself of the only things in the world he owned.
“It certainly tastes like it.”
“It was an accident--” Potter began.
Draco played the scenario out in his head. He was fairly certain Potter was right. Sure, Draco would be afraid, but showing fear, showing weakness, usually just made whatever was coming worse, like running from a dog. So Draco had learned how to subdue it, how to hide inside himself, to project nothing but confidence. It still took effort, but it was fairly reflexive, by now.
“Did you want to do the other?” Potter asked, switching his wand to the opposite hand to wipe his palm on his jeans.
Harry considered belatedly it had been a rather intimate thing to do, giving Malfoy his own clothes to wear, but it had seemed natural to him at the time. He was just making all this up as he went along, sue him.
Potter was silent.
Harry really didn’t know what to expect from Ron. He’d been mostly jokes, on their floo call before, but Harry knew how adept he was at hiding his feelings behind his sense of humor. Harry didn’t feel he had a right to call Ron at all, especially to ask about this. Still, if Hermione wanted Harry to call him that badly… She knew Ron far better than he did, these days. And Harry knew he’d never hear the end of it if he didn’t.
There will be more Ron soon, I promise, I love that little ginger bean.
When Draco had shaken his head, Corbyn had laughed unkindly and stepped closer, those black eyes seeming to stab Draco with their gaze.
“It’s like you said, Malfoy. You have a right to be mad.” Potter sighed heavily, took another drink. “I get it, believe me.”
“So,” she said, “Tell me everything, Draco.”
“You what?” Malfoy whispered.
Draco nodded. “I’m fine.” He swallowed. “Thanks,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper.
“That’s uh...that's fine. Just came over to give you these, anyway. Compliments of Hermione.” Ron stepped forward to dump the pile of books into Draco’s arms, and then pulled a satchel full of parchments off his shoulder and dropped it to the floor.
Harry sat on the floor across from him and began drinking his own coffee, black—since he was pretty sure Malfoy had just used all his sugar in a single cup of coffee.
Thank you thank you thank you for all the kind comments on the last one! it means so much to me that people are still enjoying this fic.
Right. Draco had forgotten about that. He’d been too invested in their conversation about Potter; he’d neglected to even come up with a lie. But there was no way he could tell the truth--Potter would just send him back to Azkaban.
“No. You didn’t.”
Potter was shaking his head. “I told you, I’m not going to do that.”
Anyway y'all, this sort of closes out part one of this fic, part two will have more Ron and Hermione, more focus on Harry's angst, and more of Draco pining after Harry without admitting that's what he's doing, (along with more fluff) so stay tuned.
Malfoy opened his mouth and Harry prepared himself for another smart remark, but Malfoy hesitated.
“And besides,” Potter continued, pausing to take a sip of coffee, “This has basically become my bedroom. The rest of the house kind of creeps me out, to be honest.”
I can’t wait to get to the next turning point in this work, and I’m having such a blast writing it.
I’ve just been kind of writing what I feel like, and sort of letting the story write itself, but there will be more Harry angst soon. He’s messed up too, but he’s been repressing/ignoring his trauma for a while whereas Draco’s is still fresh. It’s gonna take some digging for him to start opening up, and letting his friends in and all.
Malfoy simply raised an eyebrow in response, but he rose and followed Harry back up the stairs. Harry climbed them slower this time, since Malfoy was obviously in pain. Once they’d made it to the second floor, he turned to the first room on the left.
bad at this Hermione--”
“These markings, Kreacher knows these, oh yes…”
“It’s okay, it’s okay, you’re safe…”
Draco finally succeeded in tugging his arm back. He cradled it. His wrist was burning furiously; Kreacher had wrapped his fingers over Draco’s raw skin when he’d grabbed him.
Harry shook his head. “Whatever Draco’s feeling, it’s sure as hell not healthy.”
Harry set the parchment down on the desk, cracked his knuckles, considering. He wanted to tell Malfoy he didn’t think he was that awful of a person, through and through. Even back then, he’d recognized Malfoy as a scared teenager, stuck in a bad situation. Just like Harry had been. But in the end, all Harry came out with was, “Sorry, I’m...bad at this.”
“I knew you’d take care of him. Please don’t be angry, Harry, I had the best of intentions, honestly--”
And Draco had given him ample reason to, he realized, looking around his decimated bedroom. But if Potter were mad enough to do that, he probably would have done it when he found him. Draco hoped, at least.
, I just…” Harry trailed off, wishing for the millionth time he was better with words. “I just don’t want you to be that miserable. I...I feel responsible, I guess.”
“Hilarious,” Harry replied, and drained the glass. He went to pour another, and then paused. “I’m guessing you don’t want one?”
Corbyn shot Draco a look; Draco held his eyes this time. “Nothing’s ever an accident, with this one.”
“No, I don’t give myself an excuse. My story’s a little different.” Malfoy turned back to the stove, flipping the pancakes out onto plates.
“Did you find anything promising in those books?” Potter asked eventually.
Poor Harry, he really tries in this chapter and Draco isn't quite having it, lol. I imagine Draco having very low self-efficacy and a sort of learned helplessness from all the situations he's been stuck in, so trying to convince him he can recover and change is going to be a hard job. Luckily our boy Harry is stubborn as hell.
And then there was this morning. Draco had been humiliated by his overreaction to being startled out of a nightmare--Potter had barely touched him, and Draco had cowered away as if Potter were trying to kill him. He was disgusted with himself, ashamed that the things that had been done to him had left such a deep scar in his brain.  He’d thought he was stronger than that.
Malfoy’s eyes were far away. “He did a lot more than that.”
“People don’t have to be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ than anyone else, you know,” Harry said. “People just kinda...are.”
Harry swirled the liquor in his glass, thinking of his last conversation with Hermione.
Potter took his glasses off to scrub a hand over his face, and squinted up at Draco. “Going to give me a lecture about my ‘potion problem?’”
Harry shook his head. “Of course not.”
Malfoy’s features were still pinched with worry. “She’s a good actress.”
When Harry reached the top of the stairs, he stopped short, staring around his living room. The room was...clean. The trash, the bottles, all gone, the clothes, piled in a hamper, the books, stacked, the dust and cobwebs, cleared…
“Save it, Malfoy. You’re only being polite cause your mum is technically my prisoner, and I could make her life miserable if I really wanted to. For your information, I’m not that kind of sick bastard.”
She looked lovely, her bushy brown hair tied back in a myriad of thick box braids down her back, her ministry robes tailored and pressed, a soft smile on her face. As he looked closer, however, he could see she was a little worn down; there was a heavy, dull fatigue in her eyes and the hang of her shoulders.
“You are such a twat,” Potter said, almost absentmindedly. He ran a hand through his hair, looking around. “
Potter’s expression fell, instead. He stared at the floor for a minute and then a smile spread across his face. “I might be a stereotypical dumb jock,” he said, “But I know one Gryffindor who’s not.”
“Like I told him, door’s always open, if he wants to drag his arse over.”  There was a strange, pained look on Ron’s face. He turned to leave.
Still, her smile widened, and she spread her arms. “Can I give you a hug, Harry?”
“Is that some kind of Muggle phrase?” Draco asked, as a deflection. He was pretty sure Potter had said it before.
“Yeah, we can stop. I--I shouldn’t have brought it up out of nowhere, anyway.”
“I know that. And I’m going to keep telling you, you didn’t deserve this, until you believe it.”
“Am I not allowed any privacy, whatsoever?” Draco took a sip of his perfectly sweet coffee. Potter had dug through the kitchen drawers, and finally used an
“I’m sorry, Potter.”
Potter nodded, a half smile of remembrance on his face, but it faded as he saw Draco’s troubled look.
Potter held up his left hand, the one nearest Draco. “Um, may I?”
Draco resisted the urge to smile. “I could do a lot worse.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Alcohol cleans wounds, so technically, yes.”
“Harry…”
Potter shrugged. “Practice,” he said, taking another drink.
“I ought to tell Malfoy, he’ll be pleased,” Harry said.
Harry sighed in exasperation, setting a completed sandwich on a plate and shoving it towards Malfoy. “Well, it’s all I have, at the moment. Do you want it, or not?”
Draco was standing in front of his bedroom door, panting, fists still raised and knuckles bloody. Curse Potter, and that way he had of getting under Draco’s skin.
Hermione waved a hand. “You’re the Chosen One, you automatically got the first pick of them all. For the publicity stunt, if nothing else.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did anything happen?” Hermione asked, raising a concerned eyebrow.
Draco accepted it immediately, fingers shaking harder than usual, and took a drink.
“Thank you for the sentiment, Potter, but I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed.”
“That doesn’t...disturb you a little? Having him live down there?” Draco asked.
“Are you saying you’d turn down pancakes?”
Harry fisted and un-fisted his hands a couple of times, lowered his voice.
Hermione shook her head, scooping up her Ministry robes from the arm of the couch. “Not yet, but I’m working on it. Why don’t you call me tonight, and we can talk about what I’ve found. And Draco can speak with Narcissa.”
“I feel like I let
Okay, well I hope you enjoyed, please please leave me a comment, they brighten my day so much <3 If I ever don't reply to them, it's just cause I don't want to be annoying, but I read every one, and they give me the inspiration to keep writing. Love you all <3<3<3
“No. So maybe focus on the future.”
Harry reached out, took Draco’s hand where it was sitting on the table, clasped the shaky fingers in his. Draco started to pull away, but he stopped. Eventually, he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s hand, his eyes fixed on the floor.
Draco nodded. “I’m not proud,” he whispered. “I’m not proud of what I did, I swear.”
“Thanks,” Draco mumbled finally, setting the half-eaten apple on the counter to flip the pancakes. It seemed no matter how enraptured Draco was by a piece of fruit, he couldn’t let his pancakes burn.
“Really?” Malfoy took a sip of his coffee, eyebrows raised. “You must be damn good at sucking dick.”
Harry woke with a start and rolled off the couch, hitting the floor. His face was pressed into the musty, tattered carpet, and he rolled over with a groan.
“Be my guest,” Harry said, waving a hand.
Draco began to open his mouth to enquire what Potter meant by that, but then thought better of it. Potter hadn’t appreciated him digging into his business before, and they’d established a fragile sort of peace between them again. Draco was too worn out to break it.
“Don’t get me wrong, I was tempted, but...ah, hell, Malfoy, you know I’m a bad liar. I didn’t,” he said, meeting Draco’s gaze. “I swear.”
“I don’t do anything I can’t do well.” Malfoy gave him a confident, smirking smile, looking, for a moment, like his old self.
“You’re just not ready. Give it some time.”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Potter said suddenly, jarring him.
“I would have guessed I’d have to use an Imperius Curse to get Draco Malfoy to act as a maid.” Harry said, walking over to set their mugs on the table.
“Potter isn’t home, I’m sorry.” Draco assumed--and hoped--that was who Ron was looking for.
Draco could feel a
Malfoy’s smirk turned cynical. “You know he did. And you know I won’t let you point your wand at me, so why are we having this conversation?" He hiccuped, rolled over on the couch. "Suspect you’ll be able to do whatever you want soon, anyway. Once I fall asleep, I’ll be dead to the--” he yawned-- “World,” he finished, and hiccuped again.
“Well, maybe it was in that briefcase? If you can remember where you threw it in your rubbish dump of a house.”
“Nice, to me, since I got here. And I’m too much of a coward to even let you heal me. I didn’t used to be that way--I mean, having a wand raised at me made me wary, for good reason, but I could at least
There was Kreacher, standing on a chair to wind the grandfather clock in the hall, a bottle of Harry’s liquor clutched in the other bony hand.
Ron looked down at the can in his hand, and shrugged. “Dad confiscated a bunch of it, along with a lot of other Muggle stuff. Think some of it’s cursed, honestly, but the beer’s fine.”
feeling better.
Draco looked down, at the bruises around his own wrists, the raw skin. It still stung, and it hurt every time he moved his hands--along with his neck and ankles. Potter had offered so many times to heal it with magic…but the thought of a wand raised at him still sent shivers down his spine. He sighed heavily, disgusted with himself. How many times had he faced down Aurors, looked them steadily in the eyes as they shoved a wand in his face, spitting threats? Potter had been absurdly nice, why was he still so afraid?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you want me to do, Malfoy? Threaten you? We’re going to be living together for the foreseeable future, can’t we just be civil?”
“I’d hate to see dirty,” Malfoy muttered, but his eyes were already fixed on the dusty bed like a long-lost lover. He began to walk towards it.
He sank to the floor, eyes watering, teeth clenched. There was a sob rising in his throat; he pressed the back of his hand to his mouth, trying to quiet himself. “I’m not proud,” he whispered, to the empty room. He knew what he had done. He didn’t need a reminder. It would never leave him alone. He let go, let the guilt swallow him, his whole body shaking. He was sobbing, he realized distantly, feeling as if he were watching himself cry dispassionately, rather than doing it himself.
“And now he’s asleep in Regulus’s old room upstairs and all I’ve fed him is a bologna sandwich and some toast and some Chinese food and he still looks half dead and I’m so,
It was amusing, watching Potter cook. He swore a lot, cracking eggs clumsily with his wand while he drank coffee with his other hand, banging pans around on the stove, scrubbing the bottom of them with a spatula when things stuck, burning his fingers. It was a bit of a chaotic mess, but it smelled good. Or maybe that was just the hangover talking.
Draco blinked back his tears, swallowed hard, wishing his stomach would steady. “Nothing.” He didn’t feel like letting Potter in, not again. And anyway, it would just make Potter pity him more, and Draco knew he didn’t deserve it.
Potter dropped to the floor again beside him, cradling his mug in his hands, glasses fogging up from the steam.
The Auror smacked Malfoy upside the head this time, but it didn’t faze him.
A more genuine smile spread onto his mother’s face, but her eyes were still tinged with worry. “Alright. Things are going wonderfully over here, too, Hermione is a treasure, and the Weasleys are all very lovely.” She turned to Potter. “And Harry, Ginny’s playing in a tournament at the moment, but she wanted me to tell you she missed you.”
“It matters to me,” Ron said, his voice raising. “I want my friend back. I miss you, you...
Without thinking, Harry pulled off his jumper and held it out. “Here. Sorry it’s so cold.”
Draco stopped, and turned round. “Kreacher, is it?”
Malfoy’s eyes had turned very, very cold.
Harry swallowed, chose his words carefully. “Because...when I see someone in a bad situation, I imagine how I would feel, if it were me. And it makes me want to help.”
Ron shifted his weight on the floor, his eyes far away in thought. “I reckon...I reckon Malfoy sees the world a whole different way from how you do. He’s a Slytherin, Harry. You come busting in, wand blazing, with your righteous Gryffindor forgiveness routine...he’s never going to accept it.”
“Are we really friends?” he asked finally, his voice quiet, almost tremulous.
“Fine, don’t answer me.” Potter stepped forward again, and Draco took a sharp step back, shoulders slamming into the wall. He cursed himself. He’d sworn on his pride he wouldn’t give Potter the satisfaction of seeing him scared.
Hermione gave Potter a soft, sad smile, and then her head disappeared again, replaced by Ron’s freckled face. “Yeah, you wanker, call us, alright? Or better yet, drag your arse over here in person.”
“I’ll trade you a very cursed set of chains if you’ll loan me a spare power cell.”
“Wouldn’t say no to clothes, either,” Draco replied finally.
“That may be true, but…” Draco swallowed. Why did Potter have to be so understanding? It just made him feel guiltier. “I didn’t have a right to take my emotions out on your house, or break your belongings. I’m sure that’s not what you expected to come home to. And I’m...
Draco reached a hand up to touch his neck and face, taking a long, deep breath. “Thank you, Potter.”
“--Seriously hurt him, Harry, are you listening?”
” Harry gritted out despite himself, resisting the urge to straighten his loose-fitting nightshirt, which he now realized was hanging off one shoulder.
Potter turned, and seeing Draco far behind him, turned back. And pulled out his wand.
He wondered vaguely if he wasn’t still back in Azkaban, having a long, weird hallucination.
Potter gave him a tired attempt at a smile. “Know how to make something besides pancakes?”
“You know how much I despised you, back in school.”
He looked up. “You gonna tell me what that was all about, back there?”
“Honestly, Potter, I was just bored. Stop trying to change the subject.”
“I’ll never forgive myself.”
Draco was clearly aware of what he’d done, of the side he’d chosen, the beliefs he’d held and the effects they’d had. And from what Harry remembered of their drunken conversation two nights ago, Draco hated himself for it.
There was nothing, really, to say. And telling Potter about the things he’d done, about what a slime he really was, would just make Potter hate him more.
“It was an accident. Next question?”
Draco nodded, feeling grateful to Hermione once again, and exceedingly sorry he’d ever called her a Mudblood. She was an angel.
Malfoy was staring down, his eyes far away. “Your memories…they were awful things that happened to you. But mine...I built them myself. They were all my choices. My mistakes.”
“He didn’t deserve to be tortured,” Harry retorted, the vicious cuts on Draco burned into his brain. “If you knew the stuff they did to him…”
That was the part that baffled him the most. The food, the rest, the requests to heal him...He could almost chalk that up to Potter wanting to keep him alive, for the time being. But it was the little things that stuck in his head, like the offer of a drink, or the sugar for his coffee, or not invading his privacy by reading his personal file.
Malfoy was shivering, Harry realized. Harry had become accustomed to it, but the house was freezing, and he still couldn’t make the damn heater work.
“Interesting definition of justice,” Harry said. “And no, I don’t find it amusing.”
“May I speak with her?” Malfoy asked tightly.
Ron sounded hurt. It was understandable. Draco remembered what Potter had said, that night in the office.
It should be easy, calling his best mate. But when had Harry’s life ever been uncomplicated?
“Here’s to hoping I die before I wake,” Malfoy said, already crawling under the faded duvet.
“Better than whatever slop they’re serving in Azkaban, I’ll give it that.” He looked back up at Harry. “Thanks, uh, for the food. And the jumper. You know you don’t have to do any of this, right?”
Corbyn was opening his mouth, but Reynolds interrupted him, looking uncomfortable. “Very well, sir. You may answer the questions as fully as you’d like. Finally, would you say this program has improved 6583-9K’s character in any way? Our primary wish is to reform.”
Potter shut the door and turned round. Draco could feel Potter staring at him; he fixed his gaze on the floor again. Looking at his hands, he realized he was shaking, harder than normal. His whole body was. He wrapped his arms around himself. The cuts on his chest stung beneath them.
Harry’s gaze was distracted by the bruises on Malfoy’s face. Most of them were beginning to fade slightly, turning more of a tired yellow than an angry purple. But the ones on his neck, wrists, and ankles, were still dark, the skin still raw.
“You got me there.”
Tell me if you liked it? I've noticed in a lot of works of this type, Harry and Draco don't really maintain their personalities, I like it when they're both sassy it creates a cute dynamic. Anyway, please tell me what you thought, literally good, bad, ugly, doesn't matter, I live for comments.
He set the food down on the coffee table, and then hesitated, staring down at Malfoy. Malfoy was clearly hurt, and weak, and Harry was quickly learning just how powerless Malfoy really was in this situation. Most of the time, however, Malfoy still managed to project an air of unshakeable confidence, to fire back at Harry with seeming fearlessness, to hold himself in a way that made it clear there was still some steel down his spine. But asleep…Malfoy looked strangely vulnerable. His dirty, white blond hair was tousled over his face, and his features were tensed in an expression of discomfort, his fingers twitching in what looked like a nightmare.
His anxiety must have shown on his face, because Potter was regarding him, eyes narrowed. “You sure?”
Potter rose. “I’m going shopping,” he said, stretching with a groan. “Want anything?”
The blanket was slipping off Draco’s shoulders; he let it fall, crossing his arms. “Potter, I gave you hell for seven years, and when I showed up at your house, you treated me--like this.” He uncrossed his arms for a moment to gesture around, at his jumper, at the food, the coffee. “Can you imagine treating a defenseless child--your own flesh and blood--the way the Dursleys treated you?”
Harry wondered if Draco were having trouble sleeping, too. He didn’t think it was an accident, that Draco had ended up spending the last couple nights in the living room. But after their conversation in the kitchen, Draco had seemed like he wanted some space.
Harry set the photo down, feeling a bittersweet smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Tomorrow morning marked a week that Draco had been at the House of Black, and Harry was already more fond of him than he’d like to admit. Staring down at the photo, that strange feeling of responsibility came back with full force. Draco needed professional help, he needed family, or friends, or
Potter looked up sharply. “I’m sorry, that’s not what I meant, I just…” He trailed off. “If it’s been a nightmare for me, I can’t imagine what it’s been like for you.”
the right to cry, you know. It just happens.”
“Is everything...going well, over there? For you?”
But just then, Hermione came into view, a steaming mug in her hand. She almost dropped it when she saw Harry’s head in her fireplace.
Harry looked down at the parchment he’d crumpled in his hands. It wasn’t like he was exactly in a position to be giving advice. The only way he knew to make his thoughts go away was drinking. “Well, is there anything I can do to help? Besides...that?”
I don't think Rowling has a lot of magic tech in her books, from what I remember, but it's one of my favorite concepts, so I made the heater sort of science fantasy. (That's one of the reasons I like writing fanfiction, you can make up whatever you want and have it exist within the world. It's amazing.)
Malfoy finally pulled the bottle away from his lips, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, face twisted into a grimace. Then he raised it again.
“And you know, anything can become comfortable, if you sit with it long enough." Ron's voice had dropped a little lower, sounding uncharacteristically serious. "I doubt Malfoy even wants to part with his guilt.”
Draco met Ron’s eyes carefully, trying to gauge his honesty.
Harry’s other hand moved in his pocket, and Draco knew it was grasping his wand.
“But you--” Malfoy’s voice broke. “You don’t just...not hurt me...you…” He stumbled over his words, scrubbed a hand over his face. “You’re
Harry shook his head. “I’m sorry. I never wanted anyone to understand what that felt like. Even you.”
“Really?” Harry asked.
want to punch him.
Potter stood, and Draco managed not to flinch.
“Hermione can be very persuasive when she wants to be.”
“It’s just a rag,” Potter said, holding up the object. He reached towards Draco’s face again, and this time Draco forced himself to hold still, not wanting to offer Potter any more free amusement. He was expecting Potter to shove the rag into his mouth, but instead, Potter began to gently dab at the blood still trickling from Draco’s nose.
“Lucky us,” Draco said, with a tired attempt at a chuckle.
“You’re very kind, Draco, but Harry can be a bit thick at times,” Hermione said. “Anyway, I suspect you want to talk to your mother, so I’ll leave you to it--love you, Harry, please call me again soon, alright?”
As they headed back up the stairs, Malfoy tripped, near the top. Harry reached out to steady him, and Draco leaned back against his arms, chuckling slightly.
“Now, look at your right hand,” Hermione continued. “On your palm. Do you see it? It should look like a tiny, white scar.”
“I want to,” Potter answered immediately, and then flushed a little, looking as if he wished he could swallow the words.
“You have a tremendous responsibility, you need to be cautious--”
“The Muggles who raised me,” Potter said, already seated and tucking into his eggs.
Harry’s eyes were stinging harder. “I’m sorry I let you all down,” he said, bitterly.
“Well, she had to be, we all did, working for Voldemort.” He sighed quietly, scrubbing a hand over his face, as if trying to wipe away the dark look he was wearing. “But the fact is, I’m not sure I ever saw my mother happy, not really. Not all the way through.”
Potter extended a hand, and laid in on top of Draco’s. “What happened?”
Draco sat, his whole body tense, waiting for a stronger reaction. “I understand why you would, but please don’t send me back there. I’ll stop, I promise. You can use Legilimency, if you don’t believe me.” Draco’s hands were shaking harder than normal. He folded them in his lap.
“Maybe when hell freezes over,” Draco said, with a humor he did not feel.
Ugh, I just want them to hug already, but it’s still a little too early, lol.
“Yeah, he was real concerned.” Ron chuckled. “Maybe he’s already fallen in love.”
Draco rolled up the sleeve of the jumper and held out his arm, a little amused by how embarrassed Potter looked. “Go ahead.”
Kreacher laughed unkindly, and then seemed to remember he was supposed to respond. “No, sir, Kreacher has not seen such a thing, sir.”
Harry shoved the plate of toast towards him on the coffee table, wishing he would eat something. “I’ve got some scissors, you know, we could cut it.”
But it went back further than that, he realized. It went back to his time serving Voldemort, struggling to steel himself, to smother his every emotion and hide the ones he couldn’t. It went back to being eleven, sealing off all his thoughts from the sorting hat except one,
Harry took the opportunity to wink at him, and Malfoy looked away, blushing harder. It was fun, making Malfoy flustered for once. He was a hard man to catch off guard.
Draco took the cell from the thing’s grimy little hand and returned to the heater to snap it into place. Now he just had to get that muck out of the filter and jerry-rig something to fix the fan blade. Kreacher, after giving him one last suspicious look, thankfully retreated to his room and shut the door.
Draco looked back up, trying to think of something. Before he could, the truth came out of his mouth. “That after all these years, you’re probably the closest thing I’ve got to a friend.”
Draco was silent for a long moment, staring at the floor. When he spoke, he sounded choked up. “Maybe—Maybe it doesn’t matter, if it helps.” He cleared his throat. “Maybe it’s what I deserve, anyway.”
“I’m just here to fix the heater, then I’ll be going,” Draco said, pushing past the elf. He could almost feel Kreacher’s malevolent gaze burning into his back as he squeezed his way to the back of the room, where the heater was clunking ineffectually. He’d found a screwdriver under the sink—with no wand, he’d have to do this the Muggle way—and now he opened the panel in the back, rolled up his sleeves, and got to work.
Draco had heard Aurors say similar things, and then behave very differently behind closed doors.
Malfoy took another sip of the potion. He looked like he was feeling its effects already. He smirked, reminiscing, in a bitter facsimile of a fond smile. “Corbyn used
“You’re alive. As long as you’re alive, it’s never too late.”
But to his surprise, Potter was nodding. “Okay, noted. I’m sorry, about yesterday, by the way. You’re right, I should have asked first. I will, from now on.” Then Potter did something even more surprising. He raised his palm, and spit in it, and held it out for Draco to shake.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked, as his next question.
So I've finally decided the direction I want this story to go.
“Well, you’re getting one. It doesn’t help, roughing yourself up in your head, so you’re ready the next time someone decides to have a go at you. It doesn’t work like that. Trust me, I’ve tried it.”
Draco took another deep breath, wet his cracked lips. The air was chilly in the absence of the fire, the room quiet, the only sound the rain pattering against the windows.
This chapter is dedicated to ges_who, who said that healthy (ish) communication was their kink. Hope you enjoy!
“But...I didn’t pay anything. And I certainly didn’t pick
“Why’d you sleep on the floor?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t like thinking of myself as a child,” Potter said, his fingers gripping his mug tightly. “Makes it all hurt more, I guess.”
Draco shut the door as Ron Disapparated, and leaned back against it, taking a few deep breaths. That had gone...surprisingly well. Better than he’d thought it would, at least. He’d known Potter’s friends wouldn’t be happy to see him—Hermione had been very kind, but he was fairly certain it was out of pity. Ron, on the other hand...he’d expected far more vindictiveness. He could faintly remember Ron had lost a brother, in the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco had anticipated a reaction more akin to Corbyn’s.
Harry’s eyes fell on Malfoy’s bandaged foot. “How’s it feel?” he asked. Malfoy was only barely limping.
Draco’s jaw clenched. He could feel anger coiling inside him, and even though he recognized it as a defense mechanism, he couldn’t stop it. He’d let Potter in too close, and now he felt the urge to push him away again. “Don’t patronize me. I told you before, I don’t want your pity.”
“What is it?” Potter asked softly.
“He’s got a whole lot of cursed junk down there. I think he’s a fence or something.”
Potter finally sat back on his heels, apparently satisfied with his work. “There. Feel alright?”
“She was great.” Harry smiled softly at the memory. “I expected I’d be...awkward, but honestly...we knew each other so well, it felt almost like a...like a conversation.” Most of the sex he’d had—and definitely the best—had been with Ginny. He’d hooked up with a few Muggles over the years since then, too paranoid to sleep with a witch or wizard he didn’t know well. He didn't want them spreading rumors about him, and besides, he didn’t want to use his fame just to get laid.
“I’ve never been much good at it,” Draco muttered.
“He’s a good man,” Draco agreed.
More Ron! What did you guys think? For a character who appears on the surface to be the "Bland Best Friend," he's a lot deeper than he looks and kind of hard to get right. It's way too easy to turn him into a raging asshole or a total idiot.
“Listen to me, going on like a self-righteous bunghole,” Ron muttered. He sighed heavily, voice softening. “I know family is important to you, Malfoy. It’s important to me, too. Narcissa’s safe with us, I swear. She’s committed her share of crimes, but she’s paid for them probably a hundred times over. And like I said, I’m not here to hang it over your head.”
“I just...I told him he didn’t deserve everything that happened to him. That he was trapped in a bad situation, wasn’t necessarily an evil person--”
Potter rolled his eyes.
“Who could that be?” Harry said. He didn’t think Ron or Hermione would come over without calling or sending an owl, and neither of them usually rang the doorbell. They still remembered when the painting would scream every time.
“It’s been a long time since someone’s…” Draco trailed off, rubbed his eyes with his fingers. “Thanks,” he muttered.
Harry considered, thinking about the dark way Malfoy seemed to see the world.
Harry’s jaw was clenched. This was not what he’d wanted to talk about, not today, when he already felt all shaken up inside. “The war’s over. The world doesn’t need me. What does it matter, anymore?”
“Thanks,” he said softly, reaching for the almost-empty potion bottle again.
Harry picked at the label on the bottle in his hands. “No. It’s just something I’ve been trying to teach myself.”
Draco shook his head immediately. “Don’t think we’d get along, anymore.”
Hermione’s face appeared again.
“It’s okay, mum,” he said, leaning closer, although he was close to tears himself.
Hermione set the cup down on the table with a steadying sigh. “It’s fine, Harry. What did you want to talk about?”
“You’re right, I don’t know why you would care...how I feel, I just...I know I owe you an apology,” Draco finished, unused to stumbling over his words.
P.S. If anyone gets the Potter Puppet Pals reference in the chapter title, you’re officially my favorite person <3
Malfoy was already standing. “They’re going to be the best pancakes you’ve ever had, believe me.”
Finally, I just wanted to say thank you all for reading and for all the kudos, comments, and support in general. You're all really kind and I'm overwhelmed. Thank you.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ignoring Draco, Potter dug around beneath his sink and pulled out a battered first aid kit, grabbed some gauze, and wrapped it clumsily onto Draco’s foot with what must have been at least a yard of tape.
“Wait, wait,” said Reynolds, holding up a hand. “We just wanted to ask you a few follow-up questions, if you don’t mind?”
One of Draco’s tears fell; he wiped his face with his other hand, still not letting go of Harry’s.
Draco shook his head. “A blur, honestly.” He’d been sure living with Potter would be a nightmare, but in truth, it felt more like a daydream. A pleasant daydream where he lived in Potter’s house and Potter was kind and his mother was safe. Where no one was hurting him, and he was getting stronger.
Harry swallowed, hard, unable to speak. He’d never seen Malfoy show this much raw emotion before. The closest he’d ever seen was in the bathroom in sixth year, but this time, he knew Harry could see him, and it was
Harry knelt beside him, and placed a careful hand on his shoulder. “Malfoy?”
Potter swore quietly. Draco summoned his courage and met Potter’s eyes.
Anyway, this chapter finally has more Ron! He is so. hard. to. write. Idk why, he just is. I enjoy the challenge though. Hopefully I did okay <3
“Because you’ve been nothing but…”
“Is that so?”
Harry cracked his knuckles, took a couple deep breaths, reminding himself that the man sitting across from him couldn’t defend himself,
Malfoy looked down at his arms. “Yes,” he answered quietly, sounding reluctant.
“Say what you want about me, but this is between us. Leave my friends out of it.”
Kreacher startled, almost falling off the chair. His bulging eyes glanced down at the bottle in his hand and back to Harry, before clumsily hiding it behind his back. “Kreacher is cleaning, master,” he said finally, in his unearthly, croaking voice.
“Yeah, well…” Potter ran his hand through his hair again. “Turns out they’re a lot more fun to drink than to make.”
Harry felt tears gathering in the corners of his eyes for the first time in a long, long while. “I’m sorry. I just...I don’t feel like me. Whoever you want back, maybe...maybe he's not around anymore."
Malfoy’s expression was cold. “Other people, they live on the wrong side of power for too long, and it turns them mean. They start looking for ways to push other people down. Cause they never want to be under someone else’s foot again.”
They sat there in silence for a moment before Harry spoke again. “You had friends back in school, though...Crabbe and Goyle...” Harry tried to remember who else he’d seen Draco with at Hogwarts.
Reynolds thanked Potter awkwardly for his time and then followed his coworker, disappearing into the cold, misty air.
Malfoy swallowed. “I know that.”
Potter placed his fingers lightly on Draco’s forearm.
It was a harsh yet surprisingly subtle feeling, hating yourself. Harry knew it well. And he knew the way it clawed its way out of your chest when you were alone.
Potter stared back at Corbyn for a long moment before answering. “We were classmates. Can we move this along?”
“I’m just being honest.” He ran his hand through his hair, looked away. “You want some coffee, since we’re apparently staying up all night?”
Potter looked up at him, his expression calculating. He seemed to be waiting for more.
“What have you said?”
They both spun; Malfoy was standing in the doorway. He stepped into the room, inclined his head to Hermione. “Miss Granger. I believe I heard from the stairs that you have custody of my mother?”
Potter considered for a long moment. Draco held his breath.
Draco didn’t have anything to say. He drew his knees up to his chest, folded his arms around them. He didn’t even care if Potter found him like this. He didn’t have it in him, to keep his guard up.
Harry opened his mouth to defend himself, but Malfoy intervened for him.
Ron swallowed, hard. “I’m not trying to beat you up over it, I’m just saying, you know the feeling.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, searching Malfoy’s face but finding nothing. “There’s more to it than that.”
“Would you stop reminding me about that?”
“Hello?” Draco asked. He couldn’t see anyone else in the dim basement, all he could hear was the quiet croaking voice, seemingly muttering to itself.
He thought of when Potter had taken the chains off him, his first day in the House of Black. He’d stared straight back at Potter and his raised wand, still as stone. Had he really gone that soft in just a few days?
am I still so scared?”
Harry swallowed uncomfortably. “Um…I made coffee.”
Draco smirked. “I told you, Potter, life’s a game. And even I can see I’ve lost, in every way possible.”
“Do you want to know what I think?” Potter asked. He sounded wary of offering his opinion. Draco had to admit he'd consistently responded with anger when Potter tried to give him advice in the past.
“Tell me I’m wrong.”
And to think, he’d been proud when the Dark Lord had chosen him, given him a mission. It had seemed like an honor at the time. But in the months he’d spent in Voldemort’s service, he’d quickly realized it wasn’t an honor at all. Voldemort looked for weakness and hate in other people, for a willingness to follow orders and a hunger to subjugate others. And at sixteen, Draco had all those things. He’d been a stupid, insecure, bullying boy, with no idea what real suffering looked like. He’d learned soon enough. And by then, it had been too late.
“Looks better on you anyway,” Potter said, pulling out a plastic fork and digging into his noodles.
Harry asked, shocked.
been so good at it, lately. “Always,” she repeated.
Harry bit his lip. He’d anticipated anger, not...whatever this was. Draco sounded as if he were close to tears. “Draco…”
“Hungry yet?” Potter asked, interrupting his thoughts. “Second-best hangover cure is bacon and eggs.”
Harry looked up at his friend. He caught a bitter glint in Ron’s eyes. “I’m sorry,” Harry said, feeling hollow.
“Oh, I’m terribly sorry, Potter, I wasn’t aware you had a medical degree. I won’t argue with you and…” Draco squinted to read the black label of the bottle in Potter’s hand. “Doctor Jack Daniel’s professional opinion. Is that what they use in Muggle hospitals?”
Potter leaned back in his chair. “Okay. Okay, fine.” He traced the rim of his mug with a finger. “They...they weren’t very nice to me. They were awful, if I’m being honest. My aunt had always resented her sister for having magic, maybe even hated her, maybe was even a little bit afraid of her. And she looked at me the same way. My uncle resented having to take care of me, and my cousin just looked at me as someone to pick on. So...yeah. There was no love lost between us.” He looked back up at Draco. “Why do you care?”
“Do you miss getting punched yet? Cause I’m more than willing to oblige.”
A thought struck him. Potter
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” Draco replied coldly.
“What
“The abusive ones? They made you
“It’s ‘baloney,’” Harry corrected. “And no, it’s for people.”
Hermione huffed. “Oh, just on the arm or something, any physical contact will do.”
“You drink muggle beer now?” Harry asked, not wanting to talk about anything more serious.
“Oh, don’t wake him--”Hermione began.
“Drunker than I thought,” he mumbled.
“Thank you very much for taking care of Draco, I hope you two are...getting along alright.”
“Coming from someone who smells like a wet dumpster,” Harry replied, knowing it was a bit of a cheap shot. Malfoy had been in prison, he could hardly be blamed for his lack of hygiene.
He dumped whatever he was cooking—some kind of meat and vegetables—out of the frying pan and onto two plates, slamming one down in front of Draco. “Here. Stir-fry.”
Draco shook his head. “These are fine.” In truth, being in Harry Potter’s custody, living in Harry Potter’s house—it was already too much. He didn’t think he could stand wearing Potter’s clothes on top of it. The sweater was different—it had been a seemingly kind gesture, an almost friendly one, and because of that, Draco supposed, he somehow found it comforting. But his prison clothes, despite being a reminder of a place he’d much rather forget, were the only thing that was
“Yes,” Draco answered, eventually.
Laying waste to an entire room of Potter’s house had also been stupid, and Draco had been fully ready for a fight when Potter had caught him at it. But Potter had surprised him once again. Draco wasn’t sure what to label that conversation. It hadn’t been a fight, exactly, as hard as Draco had tried to turn it into one. He winced, remembering how many things he’d said he wished he could take back, how much ammunition he’d given Potter to use against him, if he wanted to.
Harry pulled away. “Want to come in? Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess.” He’d picked up some of the trash, at least, but he hadn’t had the energy to do much else. Hermione didn’t comment, she just came in and sat on the couch, pulling her ministry robes off as she did so and flinging them over the arm.
Harry sighed. “It’s still too early, maybe, but give yourself time.”
Draco hesitated, studying the floor, knowing he was in dangerous waters. Hermione had custody of his mother, and he was speaking to her husband, who for all intents and purposes had control over Draco’s mother as well. He couldn’t afford to make Ron any angrier than he already was.
“Ah, man…” Potter took them off and rubbed his eyes, still looking half asleep.
“That’s a terribly cruel thing to say about yourself,” Draco said, wondering who had made Potter believe it, as he clearly did.
Draco struggled to keep up in the chains, picking his way through the filthy living room. Take out boxes, open books, empty coffee mugs and muggle clothing were all piled around the room, along with an impressive collection of empty potions bottles in the corner, among empty bottles with labels Draco didn’t recognize, but assumed were some type of Muggle sprits. Seems the Chosen One had picked up a habit in the post-war years. Not that Draco could blame him. He would have too, if he could.
Please tell me what you thought about this one, I'm a little unsure about it.
“God, those things are strangling,” she said. “I feel like a Muggle judge. All I’m missing is a powdered wig.” She was wearing a much less official-looking T-shirt and jeans beneath them.
“I’ll still eat ‘em,” Harry said, honestly. They’d probably still taste better than anything he made himself.
What was he thinking? Draco reminded himself. Potter was a Gryffindor, he’d probably forget he possessed a wand at all and just punch Draco in the face. Or kick him. Potter’s line from the front doorstep floated back into his head.
“I’m not in their custody. I’m in yours.”
“I was messed up, after the war.” Ron studied the can again. “I was
” He turned back and picked up the liquor bottle, took a drink, and then poured a little on the rag. He knelt again, and wiped Draco’s foot.
“Sorry, Hermione, just a joke.”
This entire chapter is basically just Harry and Draco flirting with each other without realizing that's what they're doing lmao. So...just like canon?
Harry learned over to pull his backpack towards him from the other end of the couch, and then dug in the smallest pocket, eventually excavating some sugar packets from the diner down the street. He tossed them to Malfoy.
“So don’t worry,” Malfoy continued, giving him a sarcastic smile and throwing his arms wide. “You’ve got me for as long as you want me.”
Potter stepped back with a frown. “What are you playing at, then?”
Ron sighed heavily. “No. Reckon he didn’t. But guilt is a healthy reaction, you know, after everything he did.”
Ron was silent for a while. “You know what else Malfoy said?”
Harry snorted softly. “You just want me to talk to him, don’t you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter looked incredibly worn out, and Draco didn’t blame him. Too much healing was taxing on anyone, and the marks from the chains had been abnormally difficult to get rid of. Potter wiped his palm on his jeans again, rubbed his shoulders with a sigh, and leaned forward, wand raised towards the bruises around Draco’s neck.
? Draco felt his stomach turn over for the hundredth time that day. At least he’d thought quickly enough to twist Potter’s motives, whatever they were, into taking him into custody. What curse would Potter start with first?
“Of course,” Potter said, already getting up. He came back from the kitchen and held them out to Draco. “Here. They’re rusty, don’t cut yourself with ‘em.”
Getting that drunk had definitely been a mistake, but he hadn’t been able to stand the way he’d felt any more.
“I’m not a therapist, Harry.”
“Oh, right,” Draco said, not knowing what else to say. He’d forgotten Potter was an orphan. He realized belatedly that he’d returned to his usual brand of mockery, and wondered if he was still on 'thin ice,' so to speak. Potter didn’t look ticked off, though, just tired.
Draco fixed his eyes on the floor, his thoughts racing. What if Potter took this opportunity to send him back?
“Great. Thanks.” Draco watched as the elf hobbled back to his storeroom, and leaned to the side to peak in. It was a treasure trove of dark, cursed objects, rugs and chandeliers and crystal balls and strange, whispering mirrors. Draco could not begin to guess how Kreacher had accrued such a collection of unholy odds and ends, but at the moment he just wanted a damn power cell so he could get the hell out of this basement.
Harry bit his lip, wondering if it was the loneliness that bothered him. He knew well enough it wasn’t fun, being alone with your thoughts. “You could have the couch, if you like.”
“Yes, I do.” Hermione’s voice had turned slightly officious, the way it did when she’d made up her mind about something. “He could use a call from you. And I really
“Hermione, I...I need to tell you something. And I need you to promise to let me explain the whole situation, and not judge me until I’m through, alright?”
Draco felt a tiny bit of the pain fade. He looked down. Some of the abrasions seemed to have disappeared, but the skin was still raw, and it still ached. Potter’s brow furrowed in concentration, and he began muttering more healing spells, moving his wand in a slow circle.
“Thank you for fixing my heater, cause I didn’t have the foggiest notion of what I was doing,” Harry admitted, “But you really didn’t have to clean up after me. It’s my fault I let it get this way.”
“Hermione…”
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
Malfoy sighed. He drummed his fingers on the book in front of him, staring down at his wrist.
But Malfoy simply ignored his remark. “Maybe we should relight the fire, give her a floo call. If you gave her a few Knuts, she’d probably clean your filthy house for you, too. She is a Weasley, after all.”
He looked up, dropping his hands from his face. Potter was staring at him intently.
“I just want you to know how much I don’t care,” Ron interrupted him.
Anyway, thanks so much to everyone for reading my work <3 more coming soon
“You two not talking?”
Hermione gave him a soft smile, seeming to understand. “Of course, Draco. Let me fill you both in on what I’ve picked up on the curse--it’s not much, unfortunately--and then you two can have some privacy, alright? Now, pay attention, Harry--are you drunk?”
“Still not on first name terms with the git, are you?” Ron looked down at his own feet, kicking the leaves on the doormat absently. “Not sure I am either, these days,” he murmured.
“That he does,” Potter agreed. He looked lost in thought. “There’s got to be some way to break it, especially if I’m involved--like the clothes, with house-elves.”
“Really, Hermione, it was my fault,” Draco threw in, not wanting to drive a wedge between them, and a little uncomfortable at having the subject discussed. Thankfully, Potter still hadn’t brought up what had been happening when the curse had struck Draco, whether through absentmindedness or tact, Draco didn’t know, but he didn’t want his mother hearing about it. She’d just worry, and she looked like she was doing enough of that already.
he told himself.
“I’m not an expert, but I think most people remember being a child and feel nostalgic, not...try to convince themselves it could have been worse.” Not that Draco’s childhood had exactly been idyllic, but...was anyone’s?
Friendship--part of Draco was starved for it, and part of him felt sick at the thought. He didn’t think he was made out of the right stuff, to be a friend. And as much as he wanted it, he knew he didn’t deserve it. Especially not a friendship like Harry’s.
Malfoy was sitting on the floor in the middle of the cluttered, musty office, surrounded by books and parchments.  He looked up as Harry walked in. Malfoy looked pale in the light, and his eyes still had dark circles under them. Harry supposed he wasn’t getting much sleep, either.
Potter gave him a small half-smile, eyes twinkling green in the soft, glowing light.
Harry ran his hand through his hair. “I need advice. About Draco.”
“You going to answer it?” Malfoy asked.
Draco stared up at the bright green eyes looking back at his, at the face creased with worry, the lips moving soundlessly. It was the last thing he saw before his vision faded black.
They sat there, watching the fire until it settled into glowing embers, and cold blue light began to steal in through the windows.
Draco startled, hard, and raised his head. The tub was overflowing, water beginning to touch his toes. He couldn’t summon a response.
“You used to dream from...
Malfoy, despite the blood streaming from his nose, just snickered. “Can’t wait.”
Malfoy looked up at him, his eyes half shut. “If you really want to help me, just put me out of my misery.”
Draco shrugged noncommittally. “We were friends. But I think that word meant something different to me than it does to you.”
“You seemed like you didn’t want to be alone,” Potter said, wiping his glasses with his sleeve.
Draco huffed softly. “Cause that’s how the world works, Potter. In every interaction, there’s always a goal, and a road to achieve it. A victor, and a victim. We’re all just trying to get things from each other. And if you’re not playing, you’re losing.”
Draco was standing in the bathroom, listening to the tub fill, wishing the sound would cover the noise in his head.
“Is he feeding you?” Ron asked, looking slightly disturbed by the state of Draco’s health.
Why was he being tortured? Who was hurting him?
Draco gave him a disparaging look as he rose, and headed for the stairs. He climbed them slowly, his limbs feeling heavy. He clutched the banister with one hand, and scrubbed the other over his face, trying to wipe away his thoughts. Sharp, minute details were stuck in his brain like shards of glass, the sickly, fetid smell of Azkaban, the wood grain of the table in Malfoy Manor’s dining room, the sound of hazy, echoing screams, the twisted features of dying faces. He felt a sob rising in his chest, and swallowed it.
