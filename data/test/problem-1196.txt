The two sat there in silence for awhile thinking to themselves. They knew this was all going to come to a head eventually, but it didn’t make it any less hurtful. They had all been through hell and back together. They had almost died together. But Ron was out of control and he needed to be told and if he could not see that it was his loss. They would always have each other if it came down to it they knew that, and they had Sirius. Harry looked up and met Hemiones eyes they knew they did the right thing and needed to stand by that.
“Mr. Malfoy you will stay out of that room, as I’m sure Snape has instructed everyone” was the snippy reply from McGonagall. Pomfrey was behind the head mistress with a sour look on her face.
“She’s right you are, I don’t think we would have cared either way. We probably would have ended up with the professors before we would have figured that out” all four made an uncomfortable face, they definitely didn’t want to sit with the teachers. That would be humiliating they all knew.
Draco stared on as the four others carried on talking and picking at each other though Ron mainly took the brunt of it. He smiled to himself, months ago he never would have pictured himself here with friends, especially calling Ron and Hermione friends. But he felt right, he felt happy, not complete though he only had that feeling once two nights ago as he laid in bed with the beautiful brown haired dule color eyed boy he had fallen for. He knew this was going to be a hard road, but he also knew the people sitting here on his bed would bring him through it come hell or high water.
The afternoon classes went better than the start of the day. The three teens went from class to class, apparently, they all had the same schedule of classes and free periods. It actually looked like most houses eighth years all had the same schedule. Thankfully nothing more eventful happened throughout the day and nothing was said or got around about Dracos outburst in potions. After their last class they dropped their stuff off in their rooms and went for a walk, per Pansy saying the sun would do them all some good, Draco thought it was more so that she didn’t want Draco to hole up in his room for the rest of the night like she knew he would. They went out to the lake and walked around it chatting about the classes, and how they noticed some people had changed, mostly the remaining two of the golden trio, Blake of course didn’t have much to say about this. After they completed a full lap Blaise and Blake started to head to the entrance.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about” he said sternly, eyes still trained on Pansy. He snapped his head to the bushy haired girl again when she touched his arm.
I know this update took longer than expected but I've been babying it. I want it to be perfect since so many asked me to write it. I have a few chapters wrote and am in the process of going over them. I do not have a beta so its all on me if there is anything you see please message me and let me know. I hope you all enjoy.
Breakfast went by silently and Snape handed out everyones time tables. He stopped briefly when he got to Blake and reminded him of an appointment, they had later that week and expected him to remember. Before the food was even banished from the table the three teens were making their way down the corridors to their first class. Which was potions with the Gryffindors. The group walked in and sat at the second to last long table. Pansy on the end followed by Blaise Draco and Blake.
Pansy listened intently through all of this, she had mixed feeling on the thing as a whole. Yes she noticed from the time the boy sat down last night, the shift in Draco, it wasn’t instant but there was something that shifted. She was very protective of her two best friends, ever since they were three, but it got worse with Draco after everything he went through, and losing Harry damn well almost did him in, she was still scared it might. So yes she was worried that Draco had latched on to the first new face he had saw, and yes she noticed those eyes Blake had, more specifically the one eye that was a lone emerald. But at the same time Draco was smart he didn’t latch on to anyone, you had to earn your way to his trust, he thought thoroughly about everyone he let in. Not only that he was a Veela, they were known for good judgement. Just like everyone knew they died when their mate died, but Draco hadn’t. Could Narcissa be right and Draco had been wrong about his mate. But then there was Dracos story of his last minutes with Harry and he knew it was the classic mate bound indicators. She had no answers, and only more questions.
“Isn’t it obvious? Friday we’ll eat meals with the Gryffindor’s, mainly Ron and Hermione. I mean Slytherins making the first move towards friendship looks good not only on you all but the whole house. It might even make the rest of the school feel better coming into contact with the rest of the house” he finished and looked up from his book. The other three looked almost astonished quickly they smiled, and Pansy hugged him.
He put his letter in an envelope and sealed it shut, he called to his egal owl and sent the letter knowing she would get it first thing in the morning. He tucked himself back into bed and drifted off to sleep thinking about a brown haired boy with brown and green eyes. It didnt seem there would be any nightmares tonight either.
Draco woke up early so he could get ready and have time to write a letter to Blake. The group had decided to pass the notes back and forth for the two boys while they did research into Blakes medical issues though its hard when there isn’t really a medical issue so to say. Blaise had tried many different times to explain the situation but he wasn’t able to, every time he would get to close to letting something of value out he’d get a head ache or a wave of pain would wash over him. After the fifth time of him trying they had told him to stop trying before he did major harm to himself.
“She is a Black and my sister by all means if anyone technically has any right to tell her what to do its me, and if I wont do that Ill be damned if you will” the raven said stepping closer. The two boys were now nose to nose. Hermione stood behind the two worrying her lip between her teeth. She knew this had been a long time coming but this was not the best place to have it happen.
“Draco are you faring well, considering the situation” he asked softly. Draco looked up at Severus then and his eyes filled with unshed tears and shook his head.
Soon they all walked into the common room the first years gathered around Snape listening to the standard intro duction pretty much saying ‘ You fuck up, ill have your ass for the remainder of your education here’. The group of friends walked over to their normal seats Pansy and Blaise sitting on the black leather couch in front of the fire place and Draco slipping into the high backed chair. Blake was actually walking over to the group of first years to listen in on the ‘Welcoming Speech’.
“Hey Harry want to head back now” she asked and gave a slight smile she could tell he wasn’t really enjoying himself anymore.
“What’s that look for Pans” he blushed redder when she gave a smirk and faced forward and continued to walk. After another few minuets of silence and him talking himself into talking to the girl about his cluster fuck of a head right now he opened his mouth what came out was not what he wanted to say.
“In short Ronald insulted Black, Harry, and Hermione. Harry socked him in the jaw and Ron did more damage. Harrys lip is split, black eye, bloodied nose, and Im fairly sure the back of his head is sore from hitting the floor” Blaise didn’t get a reply and that worried him. A quiet Draco is a deadly Draco.
“Draco you don’t have to its ok, Im sure Snape would understand” Pansy said softly. He shrugged his shoulder and stepped forward.
“Do not handle her that way. You want to man handle someone why don’t you try with me” he said icily staring the red faced boy down.
Breakfast dragged on and on then finally he had had enough and grabbed up his bag making his way out of the Great hall to potions. He was the first there and sat up his station and notes. Snape had slipped in from his quarters, glanced around before making his way to his Godson.
“Well there we have it. Game plan A next will be plan B but we can wait for that” Blake said excitably.
“His name was Harry?” Draco looked over to the duel color eyed boy and raised an eye brow. The boy was looking down in deep thought not meeting his eyes.
“Harry for the love of all that is holy! It is just a house party” Hermione said angerly. She had spent the whole day listening to Harry go on and on about the house party the Slytherins were going to be hosting later tonight. This was the first one ever that would be open to the other houses by invitation only of course. Harry had automatically jumped to conclusions. At first it was hilarious listening to him make up excuse after excuse of why they should go. Ranging from ‘They could be planning to poison the drinks with some potion to manipulate the people’ to ‘ They could be trying to recruit people to the dark side’. It was now just after classes and the bushy haired girl was done hearing all of Harrys nonsense, and Ron feeding into it.
The night had carried on like this sitting in the same spot and chatting to a few people who made their way over to him. Some even wanted to dance but he politely declined. By this point he had had two more glasses and was definitely feeling it. He started to doze off in the chair every so often but would wake himself up. Blaise and Hermione made their way over to him and he smiled at them.
Draco glanced to Blake and saw him shivering and pale in his God fathers’ arms. He finally stepped to the side but did not take his eyes off Severus or the boy in his arms. The older man made his way quickly to the isolation room off to the side in the very back of the ward. Draco was right on his heels when he was grabbed and hauled backwards.
He slid his feet onto the floor and stood up walking over to his dresser pulling out his cloths for the day. He walked into the joining bathroom and started his daily routine. He thought of all the ways he could beg for forgiveness from the two teen boys he had royally pissed off and hurt last night. He really didn’t mean to use his pull, he was just overly worried. Blake had not shown up to lunch, then to find out he hadn’t because he was sick after taking a potion he apparently had to take for some kind of sickness. It scared Draco to no end he was worried, he wanted to help, he didn’t want to loose someone else. He stared wide eyed at himself in the mirror with his toothbrush hanging out of his mouth. How had the other teen gotten so close to Draco in only hours, this had never happened before, and honestly it scared him, but not enough for him to run away. He wanted Blake Viper as his friend and that was the end of it.
“My self and the one that has staked claim to you brother there, especially after he sees your brothers face” Blaise said darkly. Both Harry and Hermione glanced at each other.
“Hermione you were next to me at the Yule ball you KNOW I cant dance and am worse than you” he laughed “But I guess well figure it out, but I draw the line at grinding” he said seriously.
They heard retching which brought them back to the ill boy sitting next to Blaise on the bed. He was completely pale now besides his cheeks which were flushed his eyes were hollow looking and unfocused. Then without warning the brown haired boy went limp and about fell off the bed but Blaise caught him.
“Sure you shouldn’t have been put in Gryffindor? You sure act like one” Draco mused, Blake stiffened a little and shook his head.
“Your right Zabini, would you happen to have any ideas?” the Blond asks with a sinister smile which Blaise returned.
“Dray Darling its not that hard for someone to figure out your password. I mean really Emeralds could you be any more predictable” she simply stated while pulling out his school robes and tossing them to him. “Now go do your beauty regimen and get ready for the day. Blaise, Blake, and I will be waiting down stairs” and with that final statement she turned and walked out the door but not before catching the off handed ‘I do not have a beauty regimen’ she smirked and walked down the stairs to wait in the common room.
“And what was it that had you running from the class Dray. You haven’t done that since ……… well you know” and Draco knew she was talking about sixth year when his life first started going to shit.
“You are going to stop with this ‘Oh the world is nothing but a bitter place’ shit. Starting today we hear you saying that anymore your ass is grass” Blake said with a hard stare Blaise next to him with that same look.
Hermione smiled to herself when she heard Draco grumble behind his friend something about ‘being forced into hosting, and inviting the two.’ At that Blaise shot him a heated glare that shut the blond up completely. Ron chose that moment to push forward finally realizing what was going on. Blaise was hitting on the girl.
“ Shut up Parkinson! Ladies aren’t supposed to be disgusting” he scolded then looked at the brown haired boy “ No offense though Blake, you are quite fetching but I prefer the red heads”
Draco had his fangs bared and his eyes were blown wide and black. Snape stopped and sneered at the Blond.
Blaise didn’t get to answer because at that time Pansy threw the door open and stood to the side as a red faced Ron came stomping in along with a serious Hermione. Pansy mouthed ‘sorry’ to the blond from behind them as they all made their way to Dracos bed and stopped. The two Gryffindors crossed their arms and glared at Draco.
“Oh fine ill just walk with Dray, you two go laze around, and get fat eating junk food” she turned her nose up and looped her arm through Dracos and pulled him with. Draco sent a half hearted glare their way, but he could use this time with Pansy anyway, he had wanted to talk to her. Might as well do it sooner than later. The two boys waved and walked off shoulders brushing with each step as they talked between themselves. Draco felt that hot pit in his stomach again, he sighed and turned his head back towards Pansy. He was met with her brown eyes studying him.
The bell signaled the end of the class and they all stood packing up their things. Blake walked up towards Snapes desk and leaned over saying something quietly. Snape nodded his head and replied, then sat a hand down on his shoulder, Blake nodded his head and smiled then turned around and walked out of the classroom. Draco gave Severus a pointed look and the man had the audacity to smirk and shrug. So Uncle Sev knew this boy too. Once the three friends walked out, they were surprised to see Blake waiting. Blaise walked up to him and threw an arm over his shoulder and started walking off with him as Draco and Pansy followed behind.
“Well since that fun is over I’m going to go get ready for this miserable day” Draco announced but stopped when he heard Blake having a fit just behind the door.
Blaise looked up to McGonagall and her back to him with the same expression of worry. Of course, anything concerning the boy currently in the isolation room was never easy. They got Draco to a bed and laid down and allowed Madam Pomfrey to tend to him, as Blaise and the head mistress waited for Snape to return.
“Don’t heal them…..please. Let this play out the Weasel deserves it” Blaise asked with pleading eyes. Hermione glanced between the two then lowered her wand.
“No need to be sorry, I’m sure you’re going to want to kiss me anyway after I give this to you” he said smugly and held out what looked like a book. Draco raised his eyes brow at the boy whose smirk grew even wider.
With that the two other teens left the room leaving Blake and Draco in complete silence. The blond stayed kneeling in front of Blake with his eyes cast down waiting for Blake to say or do something. But time continued to tick on, and the longer it did the more Draco wanted to stand up and run from the room. He jerked when he felt a hand on his shoulder, but other than that didn’t move.
So I know this chapter is more like a filler but at the same time it has some critical thigs to it that is for the story. But no worries Im writing the next chapter as we speak. Please if you have any ides or maybe something you’d like to see happen please PM me and let me know. I promise ill taking it into consideration and see if I can work it in. Reviews are appreciated
“Draco what the fuck! You were forcing him to tell you his personal busines. If he doesn’t want to tell you every detail then you need to respect that.” By the end of the rant Blaise was red and Blake had come too. The dule color eyed boy was in tears as he looked at Draco from behind Blaise. It finally clicked what he had done he went to stand and Blake backed off.
“Actually you will only see him in classes Draco” Draco snapped his head back to his God father and growled.
“Hey what the hell is going on! Ron you have no right to be screaming at her like that now get lost. I will be reporting this and writing home about it” Harry growled as he made his way over and stood by Hermione.
Draco started to get drowsy and let his eyes slid close his body relaxing as well causing him to lean more heavily against Blake. He felt the boy shift and lightly grab his shoulders and lower him down to the bed. Then Blake leaned up and made to get off the bed. Draco snapped his eyes open and grabbed Blakes wrist stopping the boys movements.
The next few days passed uneventfully for the four friends. They mainly talked about how they would approach the two Gryffindors and what they would say. Draco and Blake had gotten closer during this time, to the point you did not see one without the other. This development was good for Draco, he was getting more sleep at night, eating more due to Blakes hounding and mothering, he had taken up with the boy and he looked all around healthier. Everything was actually pretty peaceful, and they all were soaking it up enjoying every minuet of it. Friday quickly came and found Draco, and Blake outside the bathroom door in Blake and Blaises room trying to talk the Italian and Pansy out of said bathroom.
Draco sat there looking at their hands it felt right and soothing. He considered the offer, would it help? He had been thinking earlier about how it would be refreshing to have someone new to talk to. And maybe this could help bridge the gap more from the fuck up he had had with breaking Blakes trust. He took in a breath then sighed.
“Harry would NOT want you to live this way, hating yourself, being miserable, crying all the time. I mean he was very vocal about how he felt everyone needed to live for themselves and their happiness, and I think if he knew you were living the way you have been it would destroy him” she laid her hand on his cheek with a sad smile and wiped away the tear that fell. Draco hugged her tight and shed a few more tears after that he pulled away with a sad smile.
“Ron you need to stop you’re being unbearable. Harry is actually looking out for me, you on the other hand. You want to control me and have others. You had your chance, and you threw it away, I told you I wasn’t going to wait!” she hissed to him. Ron spun on her and sneered.
“He’s the only one that can handle Blakes condition in the first place and this has never happened before so its best if he knows first Draco now go get him” Blaise shouted back.
“Save it Draco YOU should know better. Im going to bed good night” was his parting statement as he left following Blakes path.
The room was dark and lit with low green lights there were chairs and couches pushed up against the wall in the corner of the room where some people were already congregating. The middle of the room was turned into a dance floor that many were taking advantage of moving and sliding against each other. At the other side of the room was a long table with food and multiple types of alcohol. Where the stairs lead up to the dorm you could see people standing and talking or making out. It definitely wasn’t like the parties Gryffindor had this one seemed more sinister in away and had Harry on high alert. Hermione noticed and pinched him.
Draco laughed and the others looked on astonished that he would dare laugh at the professor. Draco waved his hand dismissively and turned towards the front. Blake shook his head and did the same.
“Do you think this is a good idea?” he asked looking from Blake to Draco, it hurt him to see that Blaise didn’t trust him right now but he did understand why.
The boy spun around with a sneer. He had short sandy blond hair that was spiked up, and dark blue eyes. He was handsome in a normal everyday country boy way. Draco could tell he was pissed at being called out on his obvious attempted seduction of the Slytherin boy.
“Well its ok for us, means we’ll have some sort of entertainment, especially since Pot….” But Draco abruptly cut off his own sentence with a stunned faraway look. Blake reached out and laid his hand on Dracos arm trying to bring him back. When he finally came to he jerked away as if he had been shocked. “Nothing just was meant to be a joke. But you’ll be fine between the three of us well get you through without a detention” and with that he turned towards the front just as Snape bellowed in.
“Yeah I think its more than that Harry Potter, I think you just want an excuse to see a certain Slytherin” she said loud enough only her and Harry could hear.
“Good morning Draco sorry we woke you how about laying back down for a few more Z’s” when his name left Blaises lips Blake Stiffened instantly.
Harry stood in front of his full body mirror and checked himself over. He had taken a shower and fixed his hair in it causal messy manner. He wore a dark green button up that was left open and rolled up to his elbows. He had a black tee shirt under it and wore a pair of washed out blue jeans with black leather shoes. The only jewelry he had on was his silver chain that had the Black family crest hanging from it. Harry had to admit he looked better than he normally did, but he still felt self conscious, no matter how much Sirius and Hermione told him he was drop dead sexy he didn’t believe it. After a once over he walked out the door to go and get Hermione.
“I was really hurt; I have issues with trust and privacy. Both were denied to me all my life and Im trying to change that now with my new life. I just need time and maybe one day I will tell you, but until then please don’t press the subject. You are free to ask questions and such but if I say I don’t want to answer please respect that and don’t force me. You think your spoiled brat ass can handle that” Draco let out a deep laugh and slung his arm around Blakes shoulders.
Harry fell to his knees in front of me and wrapped his arms around my shoulders and pressed his face into my neck. I could feel the tears rolling down his face now too, and it hurt me to know he was crying.
He looked up when he felt a hand on his knee and met the eyes of the two Gryffindors who were smiling at him. Blaise and pansy next to them smiling too.
I apologize everyone had some stuff happen and was kept busy for the past few days. Im really upset with myself I was hoping to post my Halloween chapter on Halloween but didn’t get to. But to the ones who have left kudos, comments, follows and such thank you so much, it keeps me going. You all are amazing. I was considering going forward with a Blaise/Ron and possibly Pansy/Hermione coupling but not sure. Tell me what you think, please comment, message me and let me know what you think, or if you have ideas, or would like to see something. I promise to do what I can.
“Draco please don’t think that, you made the right choices in the end. And don’t ever think you need to pay for what your father… parents did. You are a good man and caring, even I can see that. Please stop tearing your self apart you have no debt to anyone or the world to atone for. I know your mate would not have wanted you to live like this. I know he had to love you as much as you do him and doing this to yourself is probably tearing him apart”
Both boys shook their heads no but their shock was still clear on their faces. Ron rolled his eyes and pointed to the other end of the table where Blake Pansy and Hermione were now sitting.
Harry looked at Blaise and smiled ‘So he’s more than interested in just a casual fling then’ harry thought. He stepped to the side slightly and guided Hemiones hand to Blaises but stopped and smirked at him.
I hope you all are enjoying so far. Please feel free to review or let me know what your ideas are and what you think. I enjoy hearing from you all I really do.
“ Actually dearest Draco I and three others were wondering if you wanted to have a meeting. I mean really between the two smartest people in our year we should figure it out”
“ And how many times do I have to tell you, you owe me. Should have you rubbing my damn feet” he said with a smirk. Blake glared at the Italian but didn’t say anything more when Blaise returned his feet to his lap.
“I believe your veela magic is what has caused this situation and Mr.Vipers current situation. You will have no contact with him besides what classes you share and at lunch. To insure this, he is being moved to a room that only a select few will have knowledge of. When Mr.Viper wakes he will be informed of this. This is not up for discussion so do not argue with me.” Snape went to turn to leave but was stopped by Blaise.
“We saw Harry before he left the castle Draco. He told us about what you said.” Ron whispered, his own eyes gleaming with tears.
“You can look at me” He looked up and met the duel colored eyes he had come to enjoy gazing at in the short time he had known the teen. Blake then leaned down further and grabbed Dracos wrist pulling him up to the bed to sit next to him.
“I smell flowers, lip gloss, and silk” she said her face going bright red when Ron laughed. The red head followed next after Hermione hit him in the arm.
Draco sat back on his bed and propped himself against his headboard then he opened the journal. He had it on the very first page and he stared at it for what seemed like forever. He jumped though when he saw silver swirls start weaving all over the page. Then they stopped and words appeared.
“We can’t wait I’m taking him to the hospital wing, you go get Snape” Draco snapped then picked the boy up bridal style and ran out of the room. Blaise did not have time to argue because the blond was already gone. He had to get to snape quickly before anything dyer happened.
“No Im not going anywhere” and he stepped forward then sat down next to Draco. “I didn’t realize and Im sorry.” He stopped waiting to see if the blond would yell or scream at him but when noting came out, he continued. “Your amazing Draco, you have kept going and continued to live even after you lost your mate. Im proud of you and your strength” after he finished what he was saying he wrapped his arm around Dracos shoulders then wrapped his other arm around his knees and hugged him.
“Snape is no medical professional as I’m sure you are aware. So he needs to be looked after properly” Draco was quickly becoming irate.
“Damn you Walker leave him alone, can you not tell your making an ass out of yourself” he finished angerly.
Voices could be heard from somewhere far off in the fuzzy part of his brain. Everything was dark but seamed to be coming back slowly. There was an irritating buzzing in his head also that he just wanted to go away. Then it was like a flood gate had opened and everything came rushing back to him. Draco sat up abruptly looking around franticly for the sick boy that had been taken from him.
The boy ran his fingers through his hair out of nervousness then extended his other hand towards Draco.
Draco and Blaise stepped back from the door as the boy continued to scream and yell and then they felt a small surge of energy. Blaise turned to Draco with wide eyes and underlying fear, and Draco was a little scared too. So he gave Blaise a smile and ran out of the room not taking a chance at being at the receiving end of a pissed Blake.
“I am caring for him Draco but I can’t if you don’t move” Severus was ready to hex his God son if he didn’t hurry up and move so he could get Blake in the room so no one would see him. Blaise stepped up to Draco and grabbed his arm.
She sadly shook her head “We all fuck up but you majorly fucked up. But you can fix it, you have to grovel” at that Draco let out a choked sob/laugh. She was right that’s what he was going to have to do and not only to Blake, but to Blaise too, for messing with his friend. The two remaining Slytherins stood and Pansy walked Draco to his room and left him with a hug promising it was able to be fixed. He just first had to beg forgiveness and explain what was going on too. Draco walked into his room and stripped leaving his cloths on the floor not caring that they belonged in the hamper. He cried himself to sleep yet again but this time not only over Harry but over the fact he had used his veela powers to force Blake to do something he didn’t want, and had possibly lost him forever after only having him as a friend for over twenty four hours.
Blake and Draco walked to the great hall in silence, it wasn’t awkward as one would think, but more of a comfortable understanding. Draco glanced over at the shorter boy every so often taking in all he could. There was just something familiar about him, and it calmed Draco. The few times he had talked to Blake in the past twenty four hours the pain of losing Harry disappeared. Draco felt horrible about it, he felt he was betraying his mate in those few moments of forgetting the pain. Wetness formed in the corners of Dracos eyes and he quickly wiped them away, passing it off as brushing something off his face. ‘I need to speak to Pansy’ he thought, he had to get this out and with the boy being close to Blaise he didn’t want to take the chance of Blaise saying something.
“You two are ridiculous” she said with a glare but was smiling. Both of them laughed and Blaise escorted her from the room.
‘Wait don’t do that, I was just messing with you. If you don’t want to tell me that’s fine. How about for every question I ask you can ask one too?’
Hermione spun around face going bright read and glared at the black haired girl, and Draco felt scared for his friend in that moment.
“Well we could always send Pansy after her give her a chance to act on her crush” Draco said. Both Blake and Pansy started choking on air and babbling.
“Get rest Draco, you won’t get better unless you do” He said then stepped forward to bring his arms around Dracos abdomen and hugged him. Draco returned the hug wrapping his arms around the smaller boys shoulders and squeezed.
Draco didn’t know what he expected to see when the boy opened his eyes, but it wasn’t tears. The beautiful green emeralds were bright with unshed tears. Draco pulled back and looked at the teen worriedly.
“Im going to bed” was the choked hasty decision from Blake as he ran to the dorms. Blaise stood blocking Draco so he couldn’t follow.
“I don’t want to talk to you Draco…. I just can’t right now” he said and he heard the anger in his voice. Draco stepped closer and put his hand on Blakes knee and knelt he stared at the boys chest then tried again.
“I dreamed about him again Sev, it was so real I didn’t want to wake up. He promised he never left me and never would. But he did and I am alone” Draco finished with a choked half cry. Severus did the one thing no one would believe and pulled his god son to him and held him for a brief moment.
Once inside they sat down Pansy, Blaise, and Theo who had joined them talking about any and everything but Draco could tell they were watching what they said carefully as to not touch on anything that could send Draco over the edge. He hated that they were treating him as a child but at the same time he appreciated the gesture. The carriages begin their long trek up to the school and Draco chose to use that time to stare out the window and let images of Harry pass through his head. No matter what he did or how much he slept or how much he drank Harry would not leave his head. His heart ached so damn much anymore, but he figured it was the fates condemning him for all the wrong he had done because if they weren’t trying to torcher him they would have let him die with his mate. They finally made it up to the school and the four friends made their way inside.
“You’re not going to ask them to marry you, you’re just going to say hi and eat breakfast. Come on out” Draco tried to say with a calm voice but at this point his patience was thin.
Harry allowed himself to be drug over to the bad and stopped once Draco let go of him and went to his side of the bed. Harry sat down and started to take his shoes off then his over shirt and paused for a moment before he pulled his tee shirt over his head. Once done he laid back and pulled the cover over himself. He glanced up and froze when he saw Draco sliding into bed with nothing but silk pajama bottoms on. When the blond looked his way Harry quickly closed his eyes hoping not to be caught staring.
“ What are you hiding, there’s no reason I cant come into your room. It has never been an issue before until now! You always come into my room!” The red head spit out.
“You left me!” at this I fell to my knees both my hands clutching his brown jacket on either side, my head hung low as I continued to sob uncontrollably.
Today they were going to be working on their first partnered project. They were going to be making Amortentia, Blake looked at Draco and smiled mouthing ‘Your mine’ indicating he was claiming Draco as his partner before Blaise or Pansy could, but that little phrase sent a sense of fire through him, something almost feral. Draco quickly tried to push it down, but it was not wanting to be extinguished. Draco nodded, his face flustered. When he looked over Blakes head he about fell out of his chair in laughter. His two friends looked panicked, but what got his attention was the two Gryffindors that were looking for an exit. Maybe they felt for the two Slytherins more than they let on, they were all about to find out.
“Well that among other things” she said standing up and making her way to the door and smiling back at harry. “Also wear your best Harry I think it’ll do some good”
“Yyes Draco” he finally stuttered out. Draco really should have stopped but he had never been this close to the boy before he didn’t want it to end. So he continued his teasing.
“Please don’t cry Love, please stop. Stop living miserably and hating yourself. Stop wishing for death every day when you first wake up. Please live your life, I want you too. If you won’t do it for yourself then do it for me. I just want to see you smile again, your real smile. I promise I’ve never left you, Ive been with you this whole time even if you can’t see me.” Harry pulled away and took my face into his hands and turned it to where I didn’t have a choice but to look at him. He smiled that beautiful smile at me and my heart melted. I leaned forward and rested my head against his and gazed at him.
One of the doors to the great hall slowly opened and in walked a boy about 5’7 or 5’8. He had Medium chestnut brown hair, that was cut short almost buzzed on the sides and the top was longer and looked like the boy had tried to use his fingers to sweep it off to the side. Actually Draco knows that’s what he did because said boy just ran his fingers through his hair in that sweeping motion out of nervousness. His face was slim with prominent cheek bones and a chin, almost like his but had more of a boxyness to it. As Draco was taking in his appearance the boy looked his direction their eyes making contact and Draco felt his heart twinge. The boy had green eyes, no correction, the boy had a green eye that reminded him of those emeralds that haunted his dreams, the other eye was a dull blue. But what danced in those eyes was what scared Draco. He only ever knew one person who had that kind of passion dancing in his eyes and that person has been gone for months.
Draco sat back against his pillows and sighed then reached over to the tray of food and started eating. Happy it was just a simple sandwich and chips he knew his stomach wouldn’t take anything else. The two sat silently each replaying the past two days and thinking of the days to come.
“He’s in his sisters’ room, luckily he showed up when he did or this morning would be going a lot different” Blaise said darkly.
“You didn’t even take me with you when you left” I sobbed and pulled him fully up angst me and I cried as hard as I ever have before.
“He said if you still want to talk to him, to have that” he pointed to the journal “Open to the first page at ten o’clock” Draco was even more confused but nodded. He looked down at his watch and saw it was only a few minutes before ten. He looked back up to Blaise but before he could say anything the boy laughed and turned around.
“First no contact physically Draco and Blake will not be allowed to be within 20 feet of each other. They can be in the same room but that is about it. Blake will be placed in his own private room that only the head mistress, Snape, and I will know the whereabouts of. Before you ask no I can not tell you where it is or take you to it, they have taken precautions on this” he said through gritted teeth.
“You two are allowed in, you will take me in to him NOW” was the predatory screech that left the blonds mouth.
After stepping into his room and shutting the door Draco finally let his mask slip. He walked to his four poster bed sat down and cradled his head in his hands letting silent tears roll down his cheeks. The welcoming feast felt anything but welcoming especially with Harry not there. He didn’t get to smirk and cheer a little louder while staring at the Gryffindor table hoping to irritate the raven haired boy. He didn’t realize that that would affect him but then again he did it in the past to get a rise out of Harry so he would notice him. Everything was so wrong now and it seemed like he was the only one who was affected by it. Draco stood up and made his way to his black wardrobe and pulled out night cloths and changed, then made his way back to his bed and laid down covering himself. He silently cried himself to sleep, and in sleep he dreamed of beautiful emerald eyes, but then at some point one of those eyes turned brown.
“No there’s no room just come to my room. I have a private chamber so no one will bother you” Draco tried to say as casually as possible even though inside his heart was racing.
“They will not give us the time of day why should we have to endure that humiliation” Pansy cried back
“Welcome back students and I hope your new year has started out wonderfully. This year the professors and I believe that we need to focus on enter house unity. In the past there has been too much hate and fighting. With the war over we have all lost, and won on some level. None of us want to repeat the past that we have had for generations. So it is our duty to come together and stand strong!” as her speech closed the hall burst into cheers and applause, even from the Slytherins. “ With that being said we will  be holding events for the houses to come together and celebrate, when those times come it will be posted in you common rooms. Also we plan to have two Balls this year not only for unity but for all you children. After all these years and hard ships you all were deprived and we want to give you something especially our honored eighth years” at the mention of the few eighth years that had returned after the battel the hall erupted again but even louder. All the teens looked sheepish or guilty but still tried to plaster some kind of smile on their faces. “Again watch for updates in your designated common rooms” with that the students were dismissed to finish out their classes for the day.
“She don’t want to go anywhere with you, you dirty snake” the red head growled. Blaise stood straighter and stepped forward challengingly.
“Well I can’t go back tonight so I guess Ill just crash here in the common room” with that he started to make his way over to the chair he had been in before he left.
Draco spun around when he heard a knock at the door. He ran over and threw open the door to find Blaise standing there looking around worriedly. When he spotted Blake, he pushed his way inside quickly. Blake was now on the edge of the bed holding his stomach gasping.
“ Yes Mrs.Malfoy” both Blaise and Pansy said at the same time and followed Draco. Shortly after the train departed from the platform.
“What is wrong, what potions do you have to take? Let me help you.” Draco continued to stare as did Blake, he looked almost in a trance. After a few seconds Blake started to speak.
“He was a perfect gentleman; he stayed and held my hair back while I threw up and then after I passed out, he slept in the chair” she defended.
“Told you it would be a good idea to invite the two of them” the Italian said and started to walk away.
Blake paused glanced at the group then walked over to the three friends. Pansy grabbed him by the arm and tugged him down between her and Blaise. The poor guy almost looked traumatized as Pansy started in on him asking any and every question she could.
“What’s the worst case? They say no, but I think we can live with that… or just stalk them again” Blaise laugh.
“Then why did he leave me, why didn’t he take me with him” Draco all but screamed into the others hair.
Harry stopped tickling the girl and glanced over his shoulder to see Draco and Blaise Zabini standing there. The blond was his normal immaculate self the only problem was the nasty sneer he was throwing to Hermione. Blaise stood next to the blond looking at Harry with a smirk, then cut his eyes to Hermione and gave a genuine smile. He stepped up to the girl that was now standing next to Harry and took her hand bowing slightly and kissing the back of it.
“Pansy, Blaise will you catch them up on things some while I check all of our potions.” His friends nodded to him understanding he didn’t want to talk about it anymore.
“You all need to do something honestly. You will never know if you don’t, I don’t want you two to end up like me.” Draco said softly and all eyes turned towards him sadly.
Snape sneered again then snapped his eyes to Draco who was now sitting in the bed quiet and stunned. He was the one who had hurt Blake, but he hadn’t meant to. He wanted to be close to Blake even now, but he wasn’t willing to put his health in jeopardy either.
“Oh Dray Dray its time to get up and primp for the day ahead” at hearing the horrid nick name given to him by none other than Pansy herself at a young age, Draco sat straight up and smacked said girl with his pillow.
Ron threw his own and then both boys were on the ground fighting. Harry was still quite small, so Ron had his size as an advantage and sadly Harry was losing. The red head was thrown off the top of him right after the bigger boy had split his lip open. Harry looked over to Hermione who stood there with her wand drawn and pointed at Ron.
“Oh Draco, none of us have even checked to see how you were holding up with this project” he jerked his head over to Hermione in surprise, then looked accusingly to Pansy.
“Yeah. Alright” was all he could say and made his way back to the exit stumbling a few times. Yeah he definitely wasn’t going to feel well in the morning. Draco stood there with a blank face and watched the raven leave. He closed the portrait and stepped back and leaned against the wall.
“So who gets the pleasure of chasing you all night” he asked with a knowing smile. She blushed heavily and bumped against him playfully.
Pansy walked along side Draco and caught the looks the new guy was giving him and the glances Draco snuck in. “He and Blaise seem close wonder why hes never mentioned him before. And he seems to have eyes for you Dray” she chuckled.
“He wasn’t aware of the ‘situation’ and I told him, then he asked a basic question involving ‘partners’. I told him the other was dead” they understood the cryptic message Pansy nodded but had this look saying they would speak later. But Blaises head had whipped towards Blake and had an almost horror-struck look and Blake looked like he hated himself. Draco was getting agitated again and huffed.
‘I love my mother she’s my rock, has always been there through the good and bad and did her all to protect me. My father is my father I love the him he use to be, maybe one day hell be that father again. Have you ever had a girl friend?’
The first thing Harry noticed was the big king size four poster bed with black curtains. It was overly plush and had a Slytherin green comforter. He looked to the far side of the room and saw a black leather couch in front of the decent sized fire place that was ablaze. Harry started walking to the leather couch to settle in for the night when a hand on his elbow stopped him. Harry looked up and met silver eyes looking at him in confusion.
Still he had stayed hidden and watched as the teen became more and more depressed. Every time someone had went over and tried to win the boy over or get him to dance Draco had sneered and maybe sent a few stinging hexes. Once he had fell asleep Draco kept an eye on him from afar and made sure no one was meaning to cause him harm. Soon the common room dyed down and everyone was gone, he went to retrieve a blanket for him but unfortunately he was awake when he returned, and Draco made him walk out of his life. The blond sighed and turned to walk away but was brought back by loud banging on the portrait. Draco drew his wand and cautiously pushed the picture open, he then had an arm full of someone with raven hair. He looked down and met bright green eyes that had a little fear in them.
“Your mate? You never told me his name. His name was Harry.” Blake was now looking at him his eyes had a sheen to them, like he was ready to cry. There were two gasps across from them and Draco remembered the new additions to their group. He shook his head.
Before Blaise could move, a first had connected with Rons jaw and he fell to the floor. Harry stood there just looking down at his friend shaking his head, and Hermione stood over him face red with anger. Blaise and Draco were stunned at the fact the girl actually hit one of her friends.
Draco walked all the way to the back of the train and stepped into the last compartment. He sat down and let his head fall to the back of the seat and just stared at the roof of the compartment. Blaise and pansy stepped through the door and closed it behind them and sat on the bench across from Draco. The three sat in silence for quite a few minutes. Draco staring at the roof and the other two staring at Draco.
Draco looked and saw it was from his mother. His eyes turned sharply to the man. His mother never made mistakes like that, especially with mail. His Godfather stared back at him, Draco didn’t miss the anxiety that flashed briefly. Draco smirked his iconic Malfoy smirk and took the letter.
“Ok fine, talk to him but how do I start that? I don’t want Granger around; I don’t want anyone around just the two of us”
Draco stepped out of the bathroom his hair was swept to the side and back not a hair out of place. He wore black trousers perfectly tailored to his body. He had a dark green button up on with the top two buttons undone and the sleeves rolled up. To finish off the look he wore his silver necklace with the Malfoy crest and a pair of black Italian loafers. But what scared him was the blank look the blond was sending his way. Blaise stood up and adjusted himself looking back at Draco with a blank look of his own.
“Oh piss off Zabini” Blake said with a roll of his eyes, Draco looked at Blaise and raised his eyes brows. The Italian just laughed and passed his fingers over his lips saying his lips were sealed. Next was Blaise who stepped up and did the same thing Blake did.
“That’s enough! Im not glass Im fine now forget the whole damn thing happened.” His voice left no room for argument Blake flinched, but it went un noticed by the blond. Lunch was almost over at this point and food started disappearing again, but before anyone could leave McGonagall stood up to address the student body.
“You know instead of making fun of me you could be helping. Especially you Blake, you even promised while you were hear you would” the glare hardened when he looked at the dule eyed boy.
“Once I see you grovel well be even” Blaise cut his eyes to Draco and smailed as he watched Draco read the letter and grown.
“Got it!” Blaise said triumphantly and walked over to the bathroom and handed it to Blake when his hand shot out for him.
Those words snapped him out of his shock, and he dove off his bed and dug through his desk for his quill then threw himself back onto his bed and wrote back.
A piece of parchment being slid under his arm caught his attention. He looked at Blake then down to the parchment and read the messy script.
“I was just…… a little lost” he said softly staring at the bed cover. He patted the spot next to him inviting the boy to sit with him.
Draco read it and dropped his head into his hand, he knew it wasn’t good enough not for what he had did but didn’t need reminding of it. On the other hand this could be his chance to right himself with Blaise.
He had finished is morning routine and checked the time he still had an hour before he would normally head down to the Great Hall for breakfast. He sat down and pulled out his favorite quill and silver and green ink and began writing.
‘Im a veela when my emotions are high that’s one of the indicators. I was mad at what your relatives did. Now answer my question’ Draco looked into shocked brown and emerald eyes after the teen read what he had said. He quickly wrote back.
“Really Draco ‘Im terribly sorry for last night’ that’s all you were going to say after you used your powers to try and take away his choice.”
Finally, Draco raised his head and straightened his back and looked Blake in the eyes again. Those damn eyes! What is it about them, their so inviting so warm. He put his arm around the boy and brought him to his chest squeezing him in a silent thank you. ‘He smells of trecaltart, broom polish, and potions’ Draco thought to himself then scrunched up his face in thought. He almost knew what potion he smelled like but could not put his finger on it. Draco didn’t think on it anymore but filed it away for another time to think about.
“I wasn’t making fun of you Harry, I wanted to tease you a little” Harry went to pull away again, but Draco held him there.
“I smell……. Broom polish, cinnamon, and hominess? If that even makes sense” he said with an akward laugh. But caught sight of Hermione’s smirk. The bushy haired girl stepped up next.
“You ever say you saw me in this state Ill deny it and call you a dirty liar” he said with a smirk. Blake let out a chuckle.
“Ill be honest Dray, I worry maybe that your trying to latch on to the first new face you see to feel better” Draco opened his mouth to cut her off but she held up her hand.
“Hush you, we both know nothing will happen. Remember he was forced into asking us and still doesn’t like me” he said casting his eyes down. She just rolled her eyes and they continued down the stairs and to the portrait hole. They both saw Ron over by the fire chatting up some sixth year and ignored the nasty look he gave them. By the time they made it to the Slytherin common room they were almost forty minutes late, but Sirius said you were supposed to be fashionably late so that might as well have been on time.
“Actually, Miss Black I do have to ask your brother. Since your…… Father isn’t here he is the male in charge of protecting you. Its only proper etiquette that I ask him” he said with a smile.
I hope you all are enjoying. I've started another story I will be writing also. I started it to appease myself while I search for a fic I've been looking for for awhile that I read years ago. I hope you all will enjoy that one as much as I've enjoyed writing it.
“I know good and damn well you weren’t the one I brought back to my room last night Blaise so why are you here” he threw his hand out next to him meaning to grab the cover and pull it over the other occupant of the bed but was met with an empty space. Draco sat up quickly and glared at the space like it had offended his family. He then noticed the note next to him and grabbed it.
“ Yeah Malfoy that’s something I would do not you. The least you could have done was come find us and we would have happily helped” Ron grumbled out.
“Take your Potions, what’s wrong?” Draco asked worry etched all over his face. Blake reddened and looked down to the floor. Draco wasn’t having it he reached down and grabbed the small teens arm and hoisted him onto the couch and half way into his lap. He brought Blakes face to meet his and he stared hard.
Draco continued to stare at the roof of the compartment tears slowly sliding down the sides of his face. “Now do you see why I believe my mother wrong? It wasn’t just being in the same room and making eye contact. It was just him and I, only the two of us when I felt it for sure as I held him in my arms. The first and last time I held him” a sound of agony slipped from his lips. Draco leaned forward and cradled his head in his hands as more tears started to pour from his eyes. Pansy jumped up and knelt in front of him resting her hands on his knees.
“And what was that all about?” Draco asked once he stood from the bed again and started looking through things as well.
“ Viper” he stated “ Blake Viper” Draco stared at the hand and had a flash back to first year. He quickly recovered and looked the boy in the eyes as he extended his arm and took the boys hand in his and shook it. Feeling a sense of complement, and was that a sense of calm recognition. He pushed it to the side.
“I will listen, and won’t even say anything if you don’t want me too. I know how it feels to hold in pain and heart break and have no one there to help or listen” he said and glanced at the blond out of the corner of his eye.
They stepped through the entry way and was stopped by a big beefy teen they hadn’t seen before. He glared down a the two.
“Zabini can you stop with the shit you have spewing from your mouth” Draco growled, pushed the Italian to the side and glared at Hermione who only laughed. Harry at this point pushed forward and glared back at the blond.
“With all due respect Professor, I think this needs to be discussed with Blake before you go making decisions for him.” There was an edge of hostility to his voice.
‘They hated my mother because she was a witch, said witches and wizards are freaks. I lived in cupboard until I was eleven and that’s not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hell they put me though. So I left as soon as I was able to. Do you like your family’?
“Probably after midnight, and since your awake you should head back to your dorm” the blond said and started walking over to the portrait hole and opened it. He stood there waiting for Harry to leave.
“How the hell did you get in here Parkinson!” the blond growled, she along with all of Slytherin knew he wasn’t a morning person so why she decided to test the beast was beyond him.
Blake walked closely to Blaise and they would whisper back and forth occasionally. Draco would glance his way every so often and catch Blake looking at him When that would happen the boy would smile and look away, ashamed at being caught, and return to talking to Blaise.
The blond lifted his hand to Blakes waist and pulled him closer to him, still gazing into the duel colored eyes. Blakes hand had stopped petting Dracos hair and now rested on the Blonds neck. They stayed like that for a while, enjoying the others presence. Then Draco brought his other hand up and placed it on Blakes cheek, running his thumb over his bottom lip. Blake closed his eyes and Draco felt the others small shiver. The blond pulled the others face towards him their lips only centimeters apart, then finally pressed forward the rest of the way.
Blaise ran as fast as he could to Snapes chambers, he had to get him to the hospital wing before the situation turned out worse. Snape was going to be livid, one because it was five in the morning on a Saturday, and two because Draco had deliberately no listened and could have just put the boy in danger, and that’s one thing Snape would not tolerate. Blaise finally made it to Snapes chambers and started beating on the door until it was thrown open. Snape stood there a frightening look on his face, his scowl said exactly how he felt to being woken up.
They stayed in that position for awhile before they shifted around to get more comfortable. Dracos tears had stopped but he still felt numb. Blake was sitting with his back straight up against the headboard. Draco had slouched down and had his head laying on the others shoulder. Their hands still clasped between them. He might have felt numb but at the same time he felt content, like he was where he needed to be. The sent of wood, treacle tart, and that potion he couldn’t quiet put his finger on, soothing him. He started to drift off to sleep leaning more heavily on the smaller boy.
“ I plan on finding out that answer, and more. And its his problem if his eyes are for me not interested” but in truth Draco was very interested in Blake. He was one big mystery and puzzle that Draco would solve.
When he didn’t move both boys started walking up to him still smiling. Draco took a step back as they came to a stop in front of him. They both reached out at the same time and took his hands. Draco looked up at them, looking between the two with confusion.
“Damnit Ro..mmmmmm” Blake was cut off by a pillow that was thrown at his face causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the table. He groaned out and cussed. “Damnit what the fuck was that for! My damn head is splitting now!”
Draco took in air not realizing he had been holding his breath and he smelt the faint smell of trecaltart mixed with potions. His heart stuttered and his arm tightened a little further on instinct. When he looked down he met the startled duel colored eyes of Blake and noticed the pink tinge on his cheek bones. Draco instantly pushed Blake away from him and righted himself.
“He said when he gets to watch me grovel at Blakes feet well be even. And don’t worry your invited” Draco laughed as did pansy.
“You don’t have to talk but could you please listen. I need to say this, I know I need to” he begged eyes starting to feel like tears were building up. It was quiet before he said again “I promise I won’t look you in the eyes unless you say I can. I know what I did and I’m truly sorry Blake, even though I didn’t intentionally do it I should have known what I was doing, and I didn’t” it felt like forever before he heard Blake make any kind of noise. The sound though broke his heart, it was a quiet shuttered breath that left his lungs, one that you knew meant the person was crying.
“Im already up, might as well make myself useful, and help find Blakes meds he has lost” Draco stood and made his way to the other side of the bed to put his shoes on. Once his back was turned away from the two other boys, he heard frantic bustling and heard the door to the bathroom slam shut and lock. Draco spun around and locked eyes with Blaise. The other looked away nervously and went about looking for the vial Blake needed.
He is returning for his 8th year and wants nothing more than to go through the motions and morn the loss of his love. But there seems to be a boy that refuses to let him do that. And why does Dracos heart pull and yearn for this other boy, and those damn eyes! Will Draco make it to the end of his year, or will he finally fall off the edge, or will the fates bless him?
I stood at the bottom of those dreaded stairs again, and like last time I looked up and was met with raven black hair, matted with dirt grim and blood. Like last time Harry descended the stairs to the last step and came to a sudden stop once he saw Draco standing there gazing at him. I felt my throat go tight with the promise of tears to follow when I met those beautiful emerald eyes. I had missed them so much, watching all of Harrys emotions dance through them easily. Harry stood there gazing back but unlike last time he smiled a warm sweet smile at me, then held his hand out to me. I took his hand and pulled him to me wrapping one arm around his slim waist and brought my other hand up to cradle his cheek, he leaned into it and closed his eyes. I brought my forehead down to rest against his and his smile grew wider. We stayed like that for awhile just enjoying the moment then Harry pulled back and looked up at me and his smile faded but he didn’t pull away.
“Im looking forward to it” was the other boys reply and Draco found himself looking forward to this new friendship that seemed to be forming.
“I promise to never leave you Love, let me come back to you” I was confused but it quickly slipped away when his lips touched mine again and I let my eyes slide shut. We held each other close our mouths dancing in a beautiful dance that I never wanted to end. When we finally pulled apart, I wasn’t met with two emerald eyes, but a brown and emerald eye and chestnut brown hair. Blake stared at me with that soft smile and ran his hand over my cheek.
No sooner then the three sat down Draco bellowed in and made a bee line right for them eyes only on Blake. “You cheeky bastard, I had no such marking” Blake smiled and shrugged. “But it got a rise out of you” Draco was taken back by the straight forwardness of the confession. But he had to be honest with himself he didn’t mind, and it actually made him a little happy.
“Ummmm Draco, I love you and all, but not like that” came the smooth draw. Draco quickly came to and met Blaises dark eyes and smirking face. He pushed the Italian away from him and ran a hand over his face.
After an hour of moseying around and three more shots each they both had given up on finding the boys who had invited them and decided to make their way to the dance floor. At this point they were both pleasantly intoxicated but not so much they would be hungover the next day. But they were enjoying themselves.
“Watch it Malfoy, no need to do anything to get punched again” the raven haired boy finished with a smirk of his own.
“There’s no good explanation Pansy. I fucked up and hurt Draco, short and simple” within seconds Blaise was on his feet grabbing Blake by his collar and dragged him half way across the table. But before the olive skinned boys fist could do any damage it was caught in a bone crushing grip and what felt like claws cutting into his wrist. He whipped his head around and was met with the midnight black eyes of Draco. He was stunned at the action but didn’t make a move he knew good and well what could happen when a veela was pissed off.
“Yes he’s doing perfectly fine, he told me to tell you to stop throwing a tantrum before you get an unlimited amount of detentions or expelled” Draco sat up quickly and shot him an accusing look.
“If you would have asked me that a few years ago I would have said yes. But now I would have to say no. By denying yourself happiness would be betraying their memory, because if they really loved you they would want you happy no matter what”
Draco stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs at the sight in front of him. Raven hair wild and messier than normal fell into emerald green eyes that he had loved since first year, even if he didn’t know that he loved them then. His face covered in scratches, dirt, and blood, his glasses sitting just on the tip of his nose as he stared at the ground as he descended the stairs. To most Harry looked like absolute shit, like he had been drug kicking and screaming back from hell. But in that moment to draco he looked like what he thought warrior angels would look like. As Harry reached the final steps he finally noticed a shadow in front of him, he stopped and looked up meeting Dracos eyes. Draco continued to stare, his heart beating faster and faster as he tried to gather his thoughts. The only thing that kept going through his head was grab him, hold him, don’t let go. Harry stared back at Draco shell shocked not knowing what to say or do. He hadn’t thought he would see anyone on his way to meet Voldemort let alone see Draco.
“Blake is quite lovely” Dracos eyes went wide and he smacked himself. Pansy burst with laughter thankfully it was soon over, and she was wiping tears from her eyes.
Draco nodded then dressed himself, all kinds of things flying through his head. Especially what Blaise had just said to him. He knew it meant something; Blaise wouldn’t say something like that just for the hell of it. He was sure the boy was under an oath at this point with the way he was choosing his words and not saying too much, and obviously that oath had to do with Blake. The two boys exited the hospital wing and made their way to the dungeons.
“You have any hangover potions” he asked with a crooked smile. Hermione smiled with a shake of her head.
I am truly sorry everyone after I posted my last chapter the holidays were here and that took up two day of my time then I ended up getting really sick from a spider bite and had to go to the hospital. Im doing good now and I plan on getting back to posting at least twice a week. I know this is a small chapter so im going to try and get another one up tomorrow to make up for it. I thank you all so much for your comments and reviews. As always please feel free to let me know your thoughts or ideas.
“Your done with the tears Draco, you always figure out a way and that’s what you need to do now” he took a breath and chose his words carefully “ Your… happiness is right in front of you. It has been this whole time. Now do something about it!”
“But I also know you don’t let just anyone in, I wonder if it’s your instincts. I have a lot of questions with no answers, and Im always going to worry but I do know one thing for sure” she stopped walking and so did Draco. She looked him dead in the eyes she knew this would hurt but knew he needed to hear it, knew it might help.
He kept his eyes at the other end of the table watching Blake. The boy didn’t eat near what he normally would instead picked at his plate. Draco wanted to go over to him and hold him and tell him everything would be ok but knew that was not a possibility right now. He saw Pansy was no better than Blaise was, she looked love struck as she listened to Hermione go on and on.
“Draco you need to calm down. Blake is being taken care of but none of us need to be in there including you. His genetic disorder has to be kept secret” Blaise tried to reason with his friend, which apparently was the wrong thing to do.
“We’ll leave you all to your discussion lady….. Black. But we look forward to seeing you and Harry tonight. The invitation is only for you two not the red head” he said with a sneer to Ron.
He walked out of the bathroom grabbed his bag and left for the common room. Once he was down the stairs he looked up and saw Blake and Blaise talking to pansy. Blaise had his unreadable mask on, the one he used to conceal his anger. Blake looked worse for wear, his hair was a mess, and his school robes crumpled, his eyes were ringed in red and were puffy. Dracos heart cracked and he stepped forward wanting to grab the boy. The three saw movement and whipped their heads to him, Blaise scowled at him and grabbed Blakes wrist pulling him out of the common room. Blake looked back at him with watery eyes and lowered his head and let himself be pulled out of the opening in the wall. Pansy walked over to Draco and grabbed his hand with a light squeeze.
With that one statement the tension returned to the group, and Draco laughed to himself. This was going to be interesting.
Draco didn’t miss the hurt saddened look Blake gave him right before he picked up his quill and began to take notes. He didn’t mean to snap but all of this was just to much. He didn’t realize it until Weasley and Granger walked in and sat down that he had been watching for the messy raven haired boy to follow in. Then to slip and make himself realize Harry was gone it stabbed his heart through. But what surprised him was when he started drifting to that place he usually went to when this happened, he was brought back and his heart comforted by a simple touch. And from someone he didn’t even know.
“I mean honestly Blaise you should start by talking to him. You said since the war all the animosity has faded. Use this time to get to know him, if he’s anything like I’ve seen he gladly will” Blake said
“ Draco don’t, don’t say anymore. You cant love me remember you hate me, and you need to continue to hate me” Harrys voice cracked at the end as tears slid down his face. He turned to walk away but Draco tightened his grip and pulled Harry back to him and grabbed his chin. He lunged forward and pressed his lips against Harrys softly and held them there cherishing this first of hopefully many many more kisses. He then felt wetness on his cheeks and pulled away slightly to look down at harry but as soon as he locked eyes with Harrys shinning orbes he pulled away and pushed Draco against the wall and ran away. Draco tried to follow but he was too slow Harry was already gone. And as everyone knows a few hours after that Harry Potter fell in battle.
Draco watched the dule color eyed boy interacting with his friends intently. There seemed to be something he was completely missing. Something was itching at the back of his head like when you know the answer to a question but at the same time you cant bring it forward and if you think about it head on it just moves further and further to the back of his head. But at the same time it seemed like he belonged there, laughing and joking, like hes been the missing piece. “Is your rooming situation taken care of?” all eyes turned to him with confusion and surprise. Out of all the questions why did he ask that it was completely off the wall. He mentally smacked himself.
The whole hall was quiet as he made his way towards the stool and sat down the hat was placed upon his head and there was a pause, almost a full minuet later the hat shouted “ SLYTHERIN!” there was another pause but then people started clapping. The boy stood up shook McGonagall’s hand and made his way to the Slytherin table. As the boy started walking towards where Draco and the others were sitting he finally took his eyes off of him and saw Blaise was motioning him over to sit with them. Draco gave a scowl and looked down at his plate. This was their final year why try and make friends when after this most of them wouldn’t see each other much anymore let alone a new kid that was only going to be around them for a year.
“ Shut it Zabini and help find my potion, how the hell did it wear off already” Blake returned in earnest still shuffling things about.
Blaise stumbled back and pulled his wand ready to strike at any moment. McGonagall did the same thing but was more composed, given the situation.
“If either of you go to that party consider our friendship over” he tossed over his shoulder then slammed the door.
“Draco why didn’t you tell me…… that I was your mate” he whispered eyes starting to shine. I let out a broken laugh but kept my eyes on his.
“You try and you’ll be at the bottom of the lake Zabini” he said casually. Their eyes caught in a battel of dominance. Blaise looked away first but grabbed a bagel and buttered it and threw it on the blonds plate.
Twenty minutes later and Draco finally descended the stairs and looked up his eyes automatically going to Blake who was staring without any shame. Red tinted his cheeks and he walked past them heading for the great hall “Lets go you lot or we wont be able to eat” he commanded.
Draco rolled his eyes and tried to hide his blush as he grabbed his arm and started pulling him to his room. Leave it to Harry to make things awkward he thought. Draco guided him up three sets of stairs and down a long corridor before coming to a stop in front of two doors. Draco leaned forward and whispered ‘emerald’ and the doors swung open instantly. He held his arm out gesturing for him to go in.
“Blake I need to talk to you” Draco whispered and gazed into the others eyes pleadingly, but Blake quickly shut his eyes and turned his head. It felt like a stinging hex had hit his heart when the boy turned away from him.
“Yes mother…” was Dracos hollow reply as he gazed down the platform. He knew he would not catch a glimpse of that raven black shaggy hair, yet he looked his heart hoping.
“You have a point seems pointless I mean having private tutors then to come here. Im sure he already knows more than what is taught here” Draco agreed with Pansy.
“Come now lovey, he has a right to laugh it is a little pitiful” Pansy said which earned her a hex as well. She rubbed her thy and flipped the boy off.
“Your on Malfoy!” he said in delight and started walking out of the exit of the common room to breakfast. Draco followed him with a real smile one he hadn’t used in months if not two years. This didn’t go unnoticed by Pansy and Blaise. Both of their minds working on a plan already. Mrs.Malfoy did say to make sure he made new friends or something like that.
Blaise stood up and pulled the curtains around Dracos bed so he could get up and dressed in the cloths Blaise had brought for him. When he turned around the look of heart break about did him in. He walked over and hugged his friend.
“Draco stop, its for a ….. genetic condition. I don’t want to talk about it right now. I shouldn’t have said anything” Blake tried to get up but Draco pulled him back down and made him look him in the eyes again and Draco stared hard. Blake at this point had stopped fighting and stared back enjoying staring into the ice grey eyes.
As soon as he had turned towards the wall that the bathroom door sat on he saw Blaises eyes go wide and tackle Blake from behind, both falling to the floor. Draco could see the teen under Blaise struggling and made to get up to help.
“Blake hey you need to wake up” Draco pulled the covers from him and put his arm under his shoulders pulling him up.
“Can you insure she gets there safely and intact” the double meaning didn’t slide past Blaise and he smirked.
“Now who has the staring problem” he mouthed to Draco and winked. The blond glared and snapped his head forward to at least pretend to listen to the lecture. He looked over at Blaise and saw he was focused on the red head in front of him probably fantasizing about what he’d rather be doing to him.
“You two are done! You can face Death eaters, monsters, werewolves, and the like. Which means you can suck it up and talk to the Golden Duo. I swear if you don’t I will hex your hair to change colors for the rest of the term am I clear.” the two nodded quickly. If there was one thing they were more scared of it was Draco on a war path, and it looked like if they didn’t do this then that was what was going to happen. Blake had finally calmed down from his laughing fit and was smiling at the two others. He jumped up and grabbed his bag and turned to them.
“You can dance with my sister as long as she wants you to Mr.Zabini, but I think its best if I inform our FATHER of the events, to insure he’s aware of the situation” Harry couldn’t help but let out a small laugh at the wide eyed look Blaise gave him. Ever since Sirius had taken both Harry and Hermione in he had been teaching them the basics of ‘Pure blood etiquette’ and Harry knew what was going to happen. Apparently though Hermione hadn’t caught on. She gave harry a questioning look which didn’t last long because she was pulled away to dance with the boy.
He had snogged Draco Malfoy last night. He.Had.Snogged.DRACO.MALFOY. last night. Harry couldn’t believe it, he had wanted this for so long, and now that it had happened, he didn’t know what to do. It had been a party and alcohol had been involved. Harry might not have saw the blond during the party but that didn’t mean he hadn’t drank too. What if he woke up and found Harry in his bed thinking Harry was someone else last night? Harrys heart sank, he could not deal with that kind of rejection.
He was stupid he had a one in a million chance and threw it away. He and Blaise had hosted this party for the whole reason of him and the Italian making their moves on the two Gryffindors. Blaise obviously succeeded since he had not come back. But not Draco he had hidden in the shadows and watched the boy of his dreams all night. After Blaises attention had been drawn away from the lioness and he saw Harry had been neglected all night the teen had given him one of the iciest glares he had ever seen. Hermione had saw him as she was walking out and gave him one of her own as well.
“I wanted to tease you because I like to see you blush” the blond admitted his own face going red. Harry looked up confused.
“ Did you know I went to him before he went to the forest?” the weight that question held could be felt through the whole compartment. Noting was said and Draco took that as a sign to continue. “ I knew when I saw him walking down those stairs that that would be my only chance to say anything to him…..”
“Is he ok?” was all the blond had to say. Blaise looked up and sighed, he hated the dead look in his friends eyes.
“I’m pretty sure he is, I mean I’ve seen him oggel quite a few” Blake and Blaise were sharing a look of understanding that the other two didn’t quite get but didn’t comment on.
“I feel like Im betraying Harry, every time Blake has been near, talking to me especially when he touches me, it disappears. The pain, sadness, agony, self loathing, all of it is gone for those moments. Then there’s the feeling of completion I’ve felt from him. I mean fuck Pansy I let him hold, and comfort me. The last person I had contact with that wasn’t my Mother, you, or Blaise, was Harry. But Blake felt comforting when he held and comforted me. I even hugged him back AFTER he had let go, I don’t even know this person Pans. Am I so fucked up that I’m just letting anyone in, that ill take comfort from anyone!” he finished exasperated.
“He’ll be fine in a few hours Dray but you won’t be able to see him until tomorrow” Blaise said from his side.
“So you’ve been pining after this guy since second year, and haven’t made a move” Blake laughed. Then he squeaked when he felt the stinging hex thrown at him from said glaring boy.
“Your teasing me” he said with a sniff “You know I like you and your making fun of me for it. I feel stupid over the whole thing. I should have just let Filch catch me” at this point Harry was openly crying as Draco stared at him I disbelief. When Harry saw his face, he took it as the blond being offended and went to pull away and get out of the bed.
Draco pulled back a little and looked down at the smaller boy his face still red from embarrassment. Harry smiled at him and brought his hand to the other boys’ cheek.
“We can all take turns back and forth hanging out with Blake and Draco. And we can pass the notes back and forth between the two of them” Ron added. “I don’t think it would be a good idea to let anyone know you all are communicating at all right now. I have a feeling they would make that stop too” the red head finished.
Draco sat up and ran a hand over his face, and scowled at himself. It was just a dream it meant nothing especially when he had screwed up so royally last night. But his heart sped up thinking of the promises made to him in his dream, and he remembered the one he made. He felt guilty in a way because he was already thinking about not following through, he knew Harry would always be there in his heart and would want him happy and to live his life. It was just so hard to do, especially being so lonely all the time day in and day out. But Blake was there, maybe he should do as dream Harry, and Pansy had said and give not being miserable a try. The smaller brown-haired boy could be a good distraction from the world. Someone new to talk to and didn’t know about his dark past. Didn’t know how horrible of a prat he used to be, and maybe even get a real kiss…. Draco stopped himself before he could finish that thought.
“Oh my god Blake you have committed a horrendous crime! How could you bring something red into the Slytherin lair” Pansy shrieked and faked a swoon like she was going to faint from seeing the offending blanket. Blake rushed over and threw the blanket into his trunk and slammed the lid. He shot Pansy an irritated look then threw a book at a laughing Blaise before he climbed up onto his bed and made to closed the curtain.
Harry sat down in the chair and watched the two closely evaluating the current situation. The two looked back at him Hermione was calm, but Blaise started to look a little nervous.
“Well at least I can see and talk to him in class” Draco said taking a drink of water from his cup by the bed.
“No I haven’t she’s her own woman as I said and I agree with her. Go do what you want but leave her and I for that matter out of it” Harry said calmy. Ron glared at both of them and went to storm out of the room.
“Well I did always like a good challenge” he said with a smirk and both Blaise and Pansy groaned. Blake looked up to him with determination in his eyes.
Dracos eye twitched and Blake threw his arms up and walked away from the door and flopped on the bed. The blond had had enough with his two friends. He stepped back and pulled out his wand and threw a spell at it and the door blew open. Blake sat there wide eyed as the two came floating out of the bathroom upside down, Blaise glaring and cursing at the blond and pansy trying to hold her skirt up to keep from exposing herself. He floated them over to the bed next to Blake and dropped them there. By this time Blake was in a fit of laughter.
“Well I would suggest you start using their given names especially since you want to corrupt them” Blake laughed out, He leaned back against Dracos shoulder which caused the blond to smile.
“How about we go hang out in our rooms. A lot of people in here tonight” he said but had a happy glint in his eyes. Draco inwardly groaned at that, guess groveling started now he thought. The four friends made their way up to Blaise and Blakes room. Once there Blaise said, “ballerina” and laughed, Blake went red and rolled his eyes. Apparently his was an inside joke of theirs, once inside Draco was a little jealous. The room was twice the size of his, it had Slytherin green walls, two four poster beds with black curtains pulled back, across the room from each other. Each bed had a side table and next to the beds were tall dark wardrobes. On the far side wall were two dark desks to match. You could tell whose side was whose by the way the area was kept. One bed was perfectly made and everything in place perfectly down to the quills and papers lined up on the desk. The other side was a completely different story the bed was made but done so in a hasty mess like a five year old would make it. The trunk at the end of the bed was thrown open and different cloths and knickknacks were thrown about. The desk was strewn with books, papers, quills, and even candy that was half finished. But what caught his eye was the knitted red blanket on the messy bed that had a gold snitch on it.
When Blaise opened his hand to let go of Blake Draco started coming back to his senses. He lowered himself back to the bench as he glanced around and saw most of the Hall was watching, he could only hope they hadn’t seen anything involving his ‘Situation’ as they called it sometimes. After gaining control again he looked at his two long time friends and said
Harry jolted awake and looked around, the room was quiet and there were people passed out all around. The lights and music were all off and the room was a complete mess. Movement caught his eye and he snapped his head around and saw the boy he had been wanting to see all night. He was standing there with what looked like a blanket at the opening of the hall that lead to the dorm rooms. He stared at the other in surprise but quickly masked it.
Harry turned around and just started at the blond for a moment then smiled a little and walked to the blond. He stopped in front of him and held his arm out with a giggle he said “Well escort me to your bed sir”
“ Blaise I never knew you were so giving” Pansy duct when a pillow was thrown at her and she burst out in giggles. “ Awww was your crush on the weasel all a lie and you truly pined after this handsome man” with that both Blake and Blaise gagged.
“Details” was all the blond said as he walked into his bathroom leaving the door open so he could hear Blaise talk.
“Draco I’m sure I can trust you to abide by these rules correct” his look softened when he saw the look on his god sons face.
“Harry what’s wrong you seem stiff why don’t you relax, do you need help” Draco brought his hand up to the others waist and lightly stroked it with his thumb. Harry was shaking now his breath coming shorter and shorter. He still hadn’t opened his eyes though and Draco wasn’t having that.
“Blake if you loved someone and lost them then another person showed up that made you happy. Would you feel like your betraying them, their memory if you let yourself be happy with the other person?”
That day…. That day that will forever be mourned and celebrated was the day I lost my heart, my mate, and I should have died just as he had. But I guess my deeds were deemed horrid enough that I was left alone to walk this earth without him. Draco Malfoy came into his inheritance just days before the final battel took place. When he saw harry only hours before he went to face the Dark lord, Draco knew he was his mate. Draco lost his mate that very day before he even had him, and he had prayed he would die like he was supposed to, but death never came only pain and emptiness.
So Ive had fun writing this so far and I really hope you all are enjoying reading. I would love to hear from you all, thoughts, opinions and such. I forgot to say in the beginning I have no betas so its all me.
The boy sat down Next to Blaise and clapped him on the back “ Have a good summer there Blaise?” the boy asked in a happy, soft almost shy voice. Draco and Pansy stared at Blaise with looks of utter confusion.
“We will make you live your life even if we have to drag you through it kicking and screaming Draco Lucius Malfoy” Blake finished then gave him a smile and walked over to him and hugged him tightly. Draco could only stand there and look at his friends, his heart picking up a beat. They truly did care for him even the newest member.
Blaise laughed and Draco just stared back then began eating his bagel. His life was already a crazy mess why not keep going with the crazy at least it’ll keep him busy. One thing the two figured out is the red head had no manners at all. They felt like they needed to put up defensive shields just to protect themselves from the food flying out of Rons mouth as he talked animatedly. But even with that Blaise hung on his every word. Draco smiled to himself happy that his friends were at least happy.
It never came Blaise looked over to Draco, he jumped up and quickly round the bed and took Draco into his arms and hugged him, slightly rocking back and forth. The heart break in the boy’s eyes along with the tears sliding down his face was Blaise’s undoing with this whole situation, oath be damned! Blake thought he was protecting himself, Draco, and others by doing what he was doing but he wasn’t. He was harming himself and Draco the two people who mattered in this whole scenario. And he wouldn’t be any kind of friend if he let it continue, he was going to end this and as soon as possible. Blaise pulled back and shook Draco hard enough to get him to look up.
“If you would like Harry I would be more than happy to walk your sister back to the common room” he was smiling at the girl in front of him.
She shook her head and repeated what McGonagall had just announced. “ They are getting ready to sort a new student. Hes 18 and has been home schooled for years but now has decided to attend Hogwarts”
Both boys pulled back once air became an issue and just stared into each others eyes. Neither wanted to break the moment they were having. Draco lifted his chin slightly and tucked Harrys head under it and held him close. Harry sighed and placed a small kiss on the others chest and closed his eyes and let Draco lull him to sleep while he continued to run his hands up and down Harrys back slowly. Soon both boys fell asleep as the dawn light started to show through the small window across the room.
“If you’d like to we can I was just going to sit for a little bit longer and enjoy the music” he smiled back trying to hide his disappointment. Blaise seemed to be irritated but not at either of them, harry saw him lock eyes with something or some one out of his peripheral, and glare at said person. He then looked back at the two of them.
The three snakes looked on in utter confusion not believing the two were really here trying to help. Draco opened his mouth a few times, but nothing came out. Blaise had a blank look to his eyes like his brain had shut down. Pansy was the one to finally get something out where the other two had lost their speaking capabilities.
“You didn’t give me much time Boy wonder. You ran off to save the world and then got yourself killed” I felt hot tears running freely down my face.
Hermione sat there silently thinking of if anything she had read would come to mind for this situation, but noting was clicking into place.
“Thank you, professor, I believe I will have to speak with Mother about her carelessness” Severus’s eyes widened. He then scowled and quickly bellowed to the front to begin class.
“I will only say this once and there’s nothing either of you can do to stop it. His ass is ours we will handle this if anything else occurs you need to let us know” he left no room for discussion on the subject.
“What about you Harry were you a perfect gentleman” he asked a grin breaking out as Harry started to stutter.
“Mr. Black I’d like to have a dance or two with your sister” he said his eyes never leaving Harrys. Hermione laughed and went to step over to the Italian.
“I can’t allow that; I’m putting this student in an isolation room now. No one is allowed in besides the Head Mistress, Blaise, Lupin, and myself. Am I understood Pomfrey” Snape ordered.
“Snape is well versed with Mr. Vipers condition and is the only one to see to him. Now you will calm yourself or I will take precautions”
“I take pol…..” but didn’t finish as Blaise jerked Blake up and glared at his blond friend. The Italian was livid.
“Well romance aside it’s a start” Draco said still not liking not being able to touch Blake, but it was better than losing him all together.
Draco smirked seeing the smaller boys face redden and he stepped back and waved for him to come in. The blond made his way back over to his bed and sat back up against the headboard where he was before Blake knocked.
“Im assuming you all are part of this deal” she said with a smile then walked up to Blaise and hugged him, then Pansy, who looked like she could have died happy right then, then Blake. Ron followed behind and did the same besides, he finished with Blaise. When he pulled away Blaise automatically grabbed his wrist and pulled him down on the bench with him and started jabbering on about quidditch. Draco sat down across from Blaise and Ron and pulled Blake down next to him so there was no choice but for Hermione to sit with Pansy. The group settled into some comfortable chit chat here and there. Blaise and Pansy mainly taking up the time with the Gryffindors while Draco and Blake softly spoke to one another.
“How do you and Blaise know each other then if you were locked up and hidden all those years?” Blake looked to Draco and flushed a deep red and looked down again. “ Well either years ago I had to go to Diagonally with some care takers and we ran into each other. After an hour of him pestering me and stalking me” that statement got him popped in the head with a foot from said boy. “I finally sat down and talked to him. We talked for hours and after that we just kept in touch and hes actually helped me out quite a lot”
As the day went on it was harder and harder for Draco to keep himself away from Blake. And every time one of their friends drug him in a different direction to keep him away, he started hurting more and more. He didn’t know how he was going to keep this up. Finally, classes had come to an end and Blaise left the group saying he was going to drop his things off and go see Blake in his room. Draco decided that he was done with the day and stayed in his room for the night. He was exhausted after dealing with the emotional whiplash.
“So someone, well not just a someone, a Weasley, put their hands on the person I intend to court” Draco asked while he grabbed his wand and slipped it into his pocket.
Blake groaned and shifted trying to get out of Dracos arms. When he could not his eyes fluttered open and met Dracos. He looked confused but then realization kicked in and he sat up some. The movement caused Blake to hiss and his hand flew to his stomach and he doubled over, his body covered in sweat now.
“I like you too Draco” he said simply and for the first time ever Harry saw the blonds mouth drop open in shock. Draco stared at harry in disbelief but quickly recovered and glared at the boy.
Blaise had to hold in the laugh that wanted to escape at the pout his friend wore for fear he would get a tung slashing.
Draco was in his room laying down staring at his canopy, thinking about the day. It had started out good everything had gone to plan with Blaise and Pansy. Then potions class came along, and they had to do that damn potion. Ever since then he just didn’t feel the same, he was confused to no end. He thought he smelt Harry but then there was that scent mixed in that was Blakes. Was he confusing the two since they were similar? Or maybe he made himself think it was all Harrys but what he smelt was all Blake. That could be possible though. He had his mate and lost him, you could only have one and his was gone, There’s no way he would be able to love another. But at the thought his heart speed up and his inner veela started to stir. He rolled over and felt something crinkle in his pocket, the letter from his mother. He sat up and took out the envelope, broke the seal and started to read.
The four continued on working on their assignments late into the evening. Then took a break long enough to go eat dinner then resumed where they left off late into the evening until it was curfew and needed to head to bed. Pansy wished them all a goodnight then veered off to go to the girls dorm side while the other three went up the opposite staircase. They came to Dracos room first and he said good night but did not go in, Blaise looked to Blake but didn’t say anything and kept walking to their room. Blake stopped and looked up to meet Dracos eyes with a small smile.
Harry looked to the Italian with raised eyebrows and smirked, but that smirk died down when the Italian took on one of his own.
“I don’t want you to leave and I want to still talk to you. I don’t have any friends besides Blaise and what I have seen with you and Pansy, I would like if you all would consider the idea.” He stopped and took a breath and continued.
“Comfortable Harry” he whispered making sure his breath ghosted over the others lips. He felt the boys body shutter. His smile grew as he leaned a little closer.
“Who the hell would attend school their last year when they never did the first six year” Draco whipped his head to Pansy and gave her a look clearly saying ‘ Shit Im caught, I wasn’t listening’
“I know Draco but you will have to, Please promise me you will live Draco. I need you too, just like I promise I will never leave you” he whispered and gazed up at me. I couldn’t deny him I really couldn’t
