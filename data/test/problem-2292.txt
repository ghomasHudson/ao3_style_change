The next DADA lesson starts without Malfoy present. Harry keeps checking the door, expecting it to open any second now. Only Malfoy never shows.
It’s only since last weekend that everything seems to go wrong. It started last Saturday when I went out to fly my new broom, in the hope it would help me take my mind of Draco. It didn’t. All I could think of was how badly I wanted to fly together with him. He’s so talented on a broom. I’ve been coming to look at most of his Quidditch training. He’s noticed me there. He always looks around the stands until he finds me when he comes on the field and then just tries not to look at me for the entire training. Pansy and Daphne are also always at the training, cheering Draco on. I wish I could cheer with them. Hermione says I should stop going, that it’s not healthy. I should just forget about him and move on. Like it’s that easy. I still have the nightmares, only the situations keep changing. Sometimes we are sitting in the Great Hall having dinner and I look away for a second and then Draco is gone. I then run out of the Great Hall, looking for him, but he has just vanished. Or he’s playing Quidditch and suddenly his broom would be empty. I hate them, the nightmares. What if they are a bad omen? Like my nightmares from last year, that warned me about the danger that was coming? What if Draco really is going to disappear? I don’t think I want to live in a world that doesn’t have Draco in it.
We went back outside and I sat down on the stone steps. This was it; I had to go down the trapdoor myself to get the stone first. I’m sure I looked paler than Draco at that moment because he looked very worried. I told them I would go to try to get the stone myself and they both said I was crazy. I screamed at them then, saying I wasn’t planning on just waiting until Voldemort would come to kill me because I was never going over to the dark side. Draco whispered a ‘neither will I’ and that made me feel all warm inside. It was a big thing for him to make that statement, with his parents being followers of Voldemort. I grabbed his hand and squeezed it to show him how much I appreciated him saying it out loud, that he would take my side if it would come to it.
After that Draco and I just sat down on the stairs up to the Entrance Hall and stared at nothing until it was time for the Christmas meal. It was probably as good as the last two years, but I hardly tasted it. Draco was just as quiet beside me. There weren’t many students at school this year and we all dined at the same table. Professor Snape told us to light up, that it would be fine. And then Professor Lupin snapped at him that he should give us some time to grieve, that brooms are like lovers to Quidditch players, but that Snape won’t understand that since he never had a heart for the sport anyway. And then Headmaster Dumbledore made the entire table open Christmas Crackers to light the mood.
After that Black told us how he escaped from Azkaban and how he came to watch me during Quidditch. He says I fly just as good as you dad.
After that I quickly slid into class, only to have Nott make some stupid comment on how I already needed extra help from the professors. And it didn’t stop there, Nott and Crabbe have been making nasty comments all week about how professor Lockhart favours me, that he likes me. They even asked when the wedding would be. And all the time Draco just stands there and acts like nothing is happening. At least Hermione, Ron, Neville and Blaise all talk back to them, telling them to shut their mouths. Even I did a couple of times. But I’m scared they are going to hurt me again, dad. Just like last year. Now that Draco is not looking out for me anymore I’ll be a target again. I’m sure of it. I don’t want to hide bruises all the time and look over my shoulder every time I walk somewhere alone, just to make sure they won’t hex me.
The next morning Draco was already up and out in the Great Hall having breakfast by the time I got out of bed. I dressed quickly and went to find him. He was sitting with Pansy and Daphne on either side of him like he was making sure I couldn’t sit down next to him. I walked up to him and greeted him, but he didn’t respond at all, didn’t even look at me. I begged him to please talk to me, but he wouldn’t. Nott was grinning on the other side of the table. He most think it’s really funny that Draco is ignoring me. When it was clear he wouldn’t speak to me I just walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Hermione to have my breakfast.
Well, he probably is, since she was the first on the field when the Bludger got past the Beaters and Draco got hurt. It smashed onto his elbow and Draco broke his arm. He almost slid off his broom but was able to keep a grip with his legs. But the Bludger went for him again, going straight to his face and I was afraid Draco would die. He didn’t. He managed to swirl to the side, but it made him lose his balance and he fell to the ground. With a loud splattering thud, he hit the mud.
“Your time will come, Draco. You just have to be patient for a little longer,” Blaise says when he looks back at Draco.
“No, why would you even send me them? Do you think I enjoy remembering all the awful stuff that happened to me in the last seven years?”
Before the exams started Hermione was unbearable. She had much more studying to do then me and Draco and we were already struggling to cramp everything we learnt this year into our heads. And her exam schedule made no sense, even though she said she’s been to all her exams so far. I got a glimpse of it last weekend and it said she had two exams at 9 on Monday and two at 1. I asked how she was going to sit for two exams at once, but she didn’t want to answer. Draco told me to leave it. He was getting annoyed with everything because he was afraid he would fail his exams. I know he wants to do good to impress his father. He says he doesn’t care about what his father thinks, but I know that’s not true. Even though they hate each other at the moment, he’s still his father.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He’s happy that they can help out, and he loves Teddy. He’s a fantastic child. And the way Harry is with him, how much it’s brightens Harry’s mood when Teddy is around. It’s worth the pain. Because it hurts more every time Teddy and Harry interact, seeing what an amazing father Harry would be to their children. And every month that passes without Draco getting pregnant is another reminder that it may never happen for them. That they will never be able to make Teddy a big brother.
Granger and Weasley walk out of the castle. Around the lake. They stop at the tree where they used to do homework with Harry. Granger turns around and takes a couple of steps towards Draco. Draco doesn’t move and waits for the hateful words to come.
“Me too,” Harry says. He pushes his feet over the floor. He knows he should turn and walk up the stairs after his friends, but he doesn’t want to go. Draco also doesn’t move. He must hate being alone in the Slytherin common room. Maybe Harry should ask his friends if it’s okay that Draco also hangs out with them in Gryffindor tower. It might be better for Draco. He won’t be alone that way.
Draco walks away in silence. He goes straight to the lockers. Once there he pulls off his Quidditch robes and claims one of the showers at the back. The hot water washes over his back while salted tears stream down his face. His hand slams into the wall and a broken scream escapes him. His legs give out and Draco slides to the floor of the shower. He hugs his knees and rocks back and forth.
James gives Harry a knowing look. “The Quidditch World Cup? Why would you want to go there?” he jokes.
“No, we're not,” Harry says. He gives Neville a dark look. “And you should both remember that.” He picks up the plates and walks to the kitchen. He can hear his dad tell Iris and Neville to behave. Lily must have instructed him to be considerate of Harry’s wishes to keep his massive crush on Draco a secret.
Moments later Hermione opens the compartment door. “I’ve got the parchment,” she says before she sits down next to Malfoy like it’s the most normal thing in the world.
Harry writes down Ginny’s name. Her full name, as that is the way it shows up on the map. Draco nods once he reads it and turns back to the map. Harry hurries to wipe away the name before Ron sees it. He doesn’t need to know that Neville has a crush on his sister. He will be weird about it. Luckily, Ron’s still busy trying to get all the information out of Hermione for his essay about werewolves.
Harry looks at the pictures on the mantle. Draco is present in almost all of them. He smiles at Harry from the top of a mountain in Iceland. He holds little Rose when she was just born. And he hugs Harry on the day of their first anniversary.
A tear escapes Draco eye. Harry is going to leave him. It will be over, and Draco will be left alone and broken. Beyond repair. It never ends. Everyone always leaves, no matter what Draco does to try to keep them close.
“Neville, you remember what James told you about the Dementors,” Remus says. Neville nods. They had a long talk with dad when it was clear the Dementors would be guarding Hogwarts until Pettigrew was captured. Harry thought it was a bit much, but he understands now. The Dementors are dangerous if they would attack an unconscious person just because he’s scared. Or feels guilty about something, as Remus said earlier.
We caught up with them at the top of the stairs and Draco forced his sock into his father’s hands, telling him that he would still be his father no matter how much he would try to pretend he wasn’t. Mr Malfoy was looking at his son in disbelief, pulled the sock from the diary, throwing it towards Dobby and looked furiously from the ruined book to Draco. I had to swallow away the no I wanted to shout at Draco’s father’s response to it all. He said that Draco would be going to Durmstrang next year, to teach him some respect for his elders. And then he just walked off calling for Dobby to follow him.
“Bloody hell, Pansy. Spill it out. I haven’t seen you like this, since that time you got drunk and ended up in Blaise’s bed.”
They fall silent again. Draco doesn’t know what else to say. He just wants today to be over. That the invasion of his body which is coming has already passed and that there is a plan in place to move forward. It will all be better than the last week where time was standing still. Draco knows that Harry had taken care of most things around the house. He’d called the family, told their friends, called Draco’s work to say to them he won’t be in anytime soon. Draco hadn’t had the strength to do any off it. He’d stared at the TV, watched the movement on the screen without seeing it. At some point Draco had tried to read a book, only to go over the first sentence over and over again. His mind just couldn’t process any of it.
We started that day with Potions, and professor Snape made me sit next to Malfoy, in the hope I would learn some from a student that was more gifted in the art of Potions than me. He gave a lecture on how to prepare a potion to cure boils. Telling us to study it before our double lesson on Friday, where we would have to make one ourselves. Malfoy didn’t really pay attention to me. I think he really likes Potions and wants to do well in the class.
And the scowl on Draco’s face when he reads them. Harry loves that scowl. He can’t help but smile each time Draco crumbles up another note and tosses it in the bin on his way out of class.
I told them I would use the invisibility cloak. Draco just nodded and then turned his eyes away from me and Hermione, probably trying to hide that he was close to tears. Hermione surprised me by saying she would come with me and that she would start going over her notes so we would be prepared for all the protection charms.  We agreed on a time to meet at the trapdoor and then Hermione was off.
“I fucking know that! If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have defended your behaviour. I wouldn’t have convinced Harry to let you stay here every time you screw up. You know that he only puts up with you because you are my friend. He thinks you’re spoilt and selfish. And I finally see how right he is.”
“It is,” Harry answers. They both remember the last time they were at this ward in the hospital and how painful and horrible that time was.
“Yes, we can start with the basics this holiday,” Hermione says while she pats Ron on his head. Ginny laughs until Hermione looks at her and she realises that she will have to start with a BSL crash course too and she groans.
But we didn’t crash into the castle, Ron had swung the steering wheel and was whacking his wand against the dashboard and the windshield, shouting stop. Only that didn’t work. We crashed into a tree, and not just any tree, no a dangerous tree called the Whomping Willow. We landed on the ground and I was really happy I was still alive and that Ron wand looked like the only thing that was broken. But we weren’t save jet. As I said, the Whomping Willow is a dangerous tree. It started hitting the car with his big branches. For a moment we both thought we were done for, but luckily the engine restarted and Ron was able to back us up far enough to get out of the tree’s reach.
Harry nods, that will work. Hermione shakes her head on the other hand. She of course thought the idea of Harry making notes was a better idea.
“You should hurry now, the other players have already left the castle,” Myrtle says while she flies around them.
Draco looks at his mother. She sits up straight. Her head held high. She never shows any fear. Not around others. But Draco knows better. His mother is scared. Just as scared as Draco. Scared of the antics of a Lord with an unpredictable temper. His anger is deathly. And there is no hiding from it. Not in this house. Not now the one promised to defeat him is dead.
“He hates me,” Harry whispers. Fresh tears well up. Harry doesn’t care that he’s in the middle of the hallway and that everyone can see him. Neville pulls Harry into a tight hug. Ron and Hermione join them. Harry hides between them as he sobs. It’s sweet and well meant, only it doesn’t comfort Harry. His heart just broke into a million pieces and he doesn’t know how it will ever heal and be whole again.
Remus doesn’t let go of Harry. He holds him close. It’s the only reason why Harry stays upright. His legs are weak and Harry feels light-headed. There is movement around them. Professor McGonagall orders others around. Professor Snape escorts Draco out of the room and Madam Pomfrey takes care of Neville. And in the meantime, Harry just stands there, held by Remus. Until Remus asks him if he’s ready to go.
As silently as he can, Harry walks towards the stacks and searches the rows. He should have taken the map from Neville. That would make this search in the library so much easier. Now Harry has to look around each corner, into each pathway, in the hope he doesn’t run into Pettigrew before he finds Draco.
“Today I can tell you all that when I’m six, I will get a very important job, the most important job in the world. Because I’m going to be a big brother,” Teddy declares. The table erupts in cheers and congratulations towards Draco and Harry. Harry places his hand on Draco’s stomach. A thing he’s been wanting to do all afternoon, but he didn’t want to steal Teddy’s big moment. Their boy had been so proud when they told him Draco was pregnant again. And now that the first scan was all good and Draco has heard the heartbeat of the little one growing inside him, he can’t help but be excited too.
Draco is here, at Grimmauld Place. Officially he’s staying with his aunt and uncle, the Tonks. You remember, they were the once that took me in before third year started and I had run away from the Dursleys. His mother had arranged it all, to make sure Draco is safe. Mr and Mrs Tonks were at the train station, only Draco refused to go with them. He wouldn’t leave me, so he came home with me. He’s still here. I think he’s scared that if he loses sight of me, something bad will happen again.
By then it was already two o’clock when I could sit down in peace with my flashlight and the letter Draco had sent me. I read it a couple of times until I almost knew every word by heart. As I said, he’s hiding out in his own wing. He finished all his homework in the first week of the holiday and is now reading this interesting book about potions. He misses me a lot, says it’s weird to sleep alone in his massive bed. His mother is taking him to Diagon Alley to get his supplies the Sunday before school starts and he hopes I can go that day as well, so we can finally see each other again. He misses kissing me. And to be honest, so do I. His lips are always so soft. I dream about them at night.
“He hates me,” Harry finally says. He sits up and Remus holds up his arm so Harry can crawl against his chest.
I couldn’t take it and turned around, with tears in my eyes. If even the Hufflepuffs think I’m an evil wizard. They are normally the nicest of everyone here in the castle, always seeing the good in people. But even they were now convinced that I’m the dark wizard terrorising the school.
“She’s been keeping me up at night,” Draco says. Harry looks at him and sees the dark circles below his eyes.
We didn’t take the Port-key with just us six. When we got at the location Cedric Diggory and his father were already there. Draco and I both agree that Cedric is extremely handsome. He’s about seventeen and is the captain and seeker of the Hufflepuff team. His father got all excited when he noticed that I was along everyone. He looked at my scar and it made me a little uncomfortable.  Draco squeezed my hand and it made me feel a little better. Until Cedric’s father looked at our locked hands like we were contagious. Cedric noticed and mouthed a sorry towards us.
The nasty boy from the robe shop came by in the train. He asked me if I was Harry Potter and was mean to my new friend Ron. He said I shouldn’t make the wrong sort of friends. I wasn’t very nice to him and I now wish I had been. I didn’t want to shake his hands and be friends with him. But now he and his friends make fun of me all the time. Everyone looks up to him down here. But he said mean things about Ron and Hagrid. Even about you. I hate him. I wish I’ve never met him.
“I messed up my Potions exam,” Harry signs when he can’t take it anymore. He’s a chicken for not saying what he wants to. How hard is it to rub a fist over your chest and just be honest?
He turns and runs away. He falls on his knees between the first trees of the Forbidden Forest. Nobody will follow him in here. And he will only stay for a short while. He should be safe for just a few minutes. Just a couple of minutes to get himself back under control. To fight the tears that keep coming. To stop the heartache inside him, to forget the hollowness that consumes him.
But it was amazing to fly again and Fred and George forbade me to try out for the Slytherin Quidditch team after I caught all the apples they threw at me with ease. They think I would be an amazing seeker with my reflexes and all. It reminded them of their brother Charlie, who was a seeker during his Hogwarts days. And it would be unfair to the other teams if I would give Slytherin the advantage of a talented seeker. I wish I could talk to Draco about this; he was talking about trying out for the Quidditch team this year, as a Chaser and I wonder what he would think if I joined as well.
Tears fall from Draco’s eyes. His hand trembles in Harry’s, who squeezes it lightly. “I love you, Draco. And I hate seeing you in pain.”
Come seek us where our voices sound, we cannot sing above the ground. And while you’re searching, ponder this: wove taken what you’ll sorely miss. An hour-long you’ll have to look and to recover what we took. But past an hour, the prospect’s black. Too late, it’s gone, it won't come back.
Harry is glad the topic has changed. He takes the quill from Draco and writes: ‘That’s cool. Uncle Sirius is fun. He hates being deaf. He misses sounds. Do you also miss them?’
He lunged for me again and I fell to the ground. Quirrell his hands squeezed around my neck. My scar was hurting so much it was horrible. But Quirrell was in more pain and let go of my neck. His hands looked burned. Voldemort ordered him to kill me and he raised his hand. But somehow I grabbed Quirrell’s face with my hands. I don’t know why I did that, Draco says it was my instinct. But I’m glad I did because it saved me. Touching Quirrell made his skin burn, so I knew I just had to hold on to him until help would arrive. The only problem was that my head was hurting so much, it was blinding me. I could hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks, Voldemort’s yells of ‘Kill him’ and I could hear Draco begging me not to go. I’m sure that last one was only in my head. It was the last thing I heard before I passed out.
“I didn’t want Draco to see me,” Pansy answers. “He looks miserable enough without me making it worse.”
Hermione was really worried about Ron. I told her he would be fine, to calm her and to try to convince myself. Because what if he wasn’t? What if he would die because I was so stupid to go down the trapdoor?
Professor Lupin looked around and told us all that we would be at Hogwarts in ten minutes, and then he asked me again if I was okay. I don’t know how he knew, but he called me by my name. Draco was also surprised by that, but none of us thought to ask him how he knew.
And before I knew it the game had started. All my nerves vanished as soon as I was up in the air. I glanced around and saw that McLaggen was on my tail, so I sped off in search of the Snitch. I listened to the commentary of Jordan who was a typical Gryffindor and made it sound like every goal Draco made was a lucky mistake. He couldn’t have it that our star player was better than all three Gryffindor girls. Spinnet, Johnson and Bell had trouble taking the Quaffle from Draco. And even Fred and George their well-aimed Bludgers didn’t slow down Draco.
Draco’s hands move slowly. Harry stops his shuffles towards his wand. The signs are timid and small. Harry has to concentrate to decipher them.
It was a beautiful sunny day when we got on the train back to London. Draco and I sat alone in a compartment by ourselves. Blaise, Luna, Greg and Daphne said we should rest and that they would be just across the hall. Draco took me in his arms and I soon fell asleep against his chest. It wasn’t until after lunch, when Hermione and Ron came looking for us that I woke up again. Draco had some sandwiches for me, not that I was hungry. But he forced me to eat something, said it was no good to stop eating.
Greyback still hadn’t taken his eyes off of Dumbledore. “We’re to take the Malfoys to him, dead or alive. Though his Lordship didn’t say we couldn’t play with them before handing them over.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so sure about that,” he said as he examined his wand again. Harry heard him mutter something along the lines of useless unicorns and Dark Magic.
“Are you in danger?” Malfoy’s jaw clenched, and Harry said, “You should talk to Dumbledore. He can help you.”
Ron yawned widely. Hermione said wearily, “For the last time, Malfoy was just being his usual vitriolic self. He’s not trying to murder Dumbledore using toast. Now could we please talk about something else? Have either of you done the essay on animal-to-animal transfiguration for Professor McGonagall? We have a bit of time before our first class, I was thinking we could go to the library and get a head start.”
Harry thought back to the years of tea dregs, crystal balls, and dream diaries collectively agreeing upon his imminent and violent demise.
“Draco?” repeated Ginny faintly. She rubbed her face with her hand, smearing some dirt across her forehead. “Merlin’s pants, I’ve gotta talk to Hermione. If you don’t catch the Snitch tomorrow because you’re lovesick over Malfoy…”
Ginny rolled her eyes again, though the effect was lessened by her struggle with the Bludger. “You’re not exactly subtle,” she panted as she wrestled the ball into submission. “You stare at the Slytherin table whenever we eat, and all I hear you, Ron, and Hermione talking about these days is Malfoy. I can put two and two together.”
“Draco hasn’t come visit me for three days now!” she wailed. “I miss him, and I know he misses me too. He’s lonely just like me. He
“Dark Magic isn’t evil,” said Harry. “And Death Eaters aren’t the only ones who have hurt people. I’ve had enough of people dying around me. This war has to end.”
Malfoy stared at Harry’s left hand floating in the air next to his red pajama bottoms covered in golden Snitches. It did look a little strange, but it was nothing compared to the time Ron used the Cloak as a makeshift blanket one night and appeared to have lost his legs.
Harry numbly let go of Professor Trelawney, who immediately swayed backwards a little before righting herself with a hand on the wall. He paid her no attention. His heart was pounding very fast, as he realized several things at once.
“Snape’s a Death Eater, through and through! He doesn’t care what happens as long as he serves his precious Dark Lord! What do you think will happen the instant Voldemort demands he hand over the Malfoys, huh? What do you think’s gonna happen to Draco?”
Harry gaped at her, nearly letting a Bludger go flying back into the air. “What did Ron tell you?” he asked, imagining them discussing Harry’s interest in Draco’s jam preferences and feeling even more betrayed. “Whatever he said, it’s not true.”
Snape was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy all those years ago, and the reason Harry grew up an unloved orphan with a lightning bolt scar. Snape was the one responsible for his parents’ deaths, one of whom had been his childhood best friend.
Harry looked at the door with a sense of impending doom. “This is ridiculous. Let’s at least wait until morning. He already hates me, he’s going to kill me if we wake him up right now.”
“Oh, uh, sorry,” said Harry hastily as Myrtle’s eyes filled with tears. “I didn’t mean to, I was just thinking about something else.”
Dumbledore gave him a piercing look.  “Professor Snape has made terrible mistakes in the past, but he is not without a heart,” said Dumbledore evenly. There was no anger or judgment in his voice, but Harry felt inexplicably ashamed. “He did not hear the entire prophecy then, and did not know that Voldemort would go after you and your parents. At the time, he was still a Death Eater but after your parents died…”
Malfoy looked even more alarmed and eyed Harry suspiciously. Harry hoped Malfoy never found out about how he used Kreacher as a spy for a few weeks.
“I never knew school could be this fun,” said Greyback, licking a trail of blood off his finger. “So much delicious untouched flesh, all in one place…”
He had looked for Draco the previous night, hoping to find him on the seventh floor, but his dot had stayed in the Slytherin dormitories until midnight, when Ron had staged an intervention. He had forcefully wrested the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauders’ Map from Harry and given them to Hermione for safekeeping. Harry had gone to bed with ill grace and dreamed of Draco.
The next morning, Harry did his best to focus lest he be persecuted by his housemates for losing the match (he had no doubt Ginny would spread the word that Harry had been too busy thinking about Draco to catch the Snitch).
“Let’s not waste time on details,” said Draco airily. “Potter has been stalking me, and it’s getting tiresome.”
“Yes, he and that barman were at the door, spying on my interview! Not that it was particularly surprising, I am quite well known within certain circles, undoubtedly they were hoping for an autograph from such an esteemed Seer. Dumbledore gave me the job as soon as they were gone, and I am sure he did not know of my celebrity status before they came along so perhaps it was for the best. You see, you’re not the only one who struggles with the burden of fame, Harry – Harry?” She looked down at Harry’s painfully tight grip on her arm.
“Draco? Are you in danger? Are you hurt?” Snape noticed Harry standing there and his expression soured considerably. “What is Mr. Potter doing here?”
Harry forced the potion down Dumbledore’s throat even as his headmaster screamed and cried and begged for him to stop. An army of Inferi had crawled out of the hidden depths and silently lurched towards them, grey hands reaching to drag them beneath the surface and join their ranks. Even as Harry had fought them, he couldn’t help but notice that some of them were just children, not even Hogwarts age.
“Go?” said Harry. He stared at Dumbledore for what felt like a few minutes before saying slowly, “Professor, where is Draco?”
“But I need to know what’s going on!” insisted Harry. Dumbledore, Snape, and Draco were not at breakfast, a fact Harry took note of within two minutes of stepping into the Great Hall.
“I want Voldemort defeated and the Death Eaters disbanded,” said Harry seriously. “I want the discrimination against Muggle-borns to end. I would very much like it if you and your lot stopped calling people Mudbloods and bullying first-years, but mostly I just want everyone alive and safe at the end of all this.”
“The Malfoys are unfortunately unavailable at the time,” said Dumbledore calmly, though he leaned against the wall as if he no longer had strength to stand. “Perhaps if you send a message next time and notify me of your plans.”
Harry tensed, wondering whether Professor Trelawney remembered anything about the infamous prophecy she had made that night.
,” said Harry again, since Ron and Hermione apparently missed that point the first time around. For some reason, that fact bothered him very much. He took an unenthusiastic bite of chicken pie.
On his way up to the Headmaster’s office as instructed, he passed by a rather unsteady Professor Trelawney on the seventh floor. She stumbled and crashed to the floor, and Harry heard the crack of broken glass.
At that, both boys went very red. Draco turned away and took advantage of Harry’s discomfiture to knock loudly.
Ginny punched him in the arm hard as she flew past on her broom. “Harry James Potter, I will kill you!” she hollered at him. “Get the Snitch!”
“It’s not my fault!” said Harry defensively. “I don’t know what happened to him either.” He hefted his bag up higher on his shoulder. “Look, let me go talk to Dumbledore about this, okay? He should know.”
When they landed on the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore instructed Harry to put on his Invisibility Cloak. He had barely covered himself when a barrage of spells came at them. Harry was hit by a full Body-Bind before he could react and stiffly fell against the wall. Dumbledore had defended himself, but Harry could see the effort it had taken him.
“The only way Dumbledore could help me is if he choked to death on his toast tomorrow morning,” said Malfoy. “And if you want to help me, make that happen. In the meantime, leave me alone or I’ll hex you.”
“This is for you,” said Jimmy, handing him a scroll of parchment. “So, uh, what were you doing in there?”
“Harry, there you are!” said Dumbledore, gathering up his black cloak off his chair. “Are you ready to go?”
A few months ago, Harry had realized that every morning without fail, Malfoy only went for raspberry jam and would even go as far as walking over to the Ravenclaw table if there was none left for the Slytherins. He had watched for weeks, trying to figure out whether there was a secret code he was missing, before giving it up. But really, who likes raspberry jam more than strawberry jam?
“Fenrir Greyback,” said Dumbledore levelly, though a flicker of disgust crossed his face. “So nice of you to come visit Hogwarts. And is that Alecto? It’s been a while since your time here.”
“Mr. Malfoy and I will talk with Dumbledore in the morning,” announced Snape wearily. “Potter, get out of my sight.”
“Don’t cry,” said Myrtle in a surprisingly comforting voice. She reached out a translucent hand to rest on Malfoy’s shoulder. He jumped a little, and Harry winced at the thought of feeling an ice cold hand grab onto one’s shoulder. “It’ll be alright, we can figure this out together.”
“You like Draco Malfoy!” accused Ginny, with a look of horror. “Merlin. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.”
Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy by the shoulders. Malfoy seemed too stunned by his Muggle approach to react.
Dumbledore waved aside her concerned protests, and Harry Summoned the brooms from behind the bar. They mounted their brooms and flew off for Hogwarts, leaving Rosmerta, who was clearly terrified, to alert the Aurors.
“Where have you been?” demanded Alecto, rounding on Snape angrily. “The Dark Lord has been asking for you for several days now. You better have a good explanation for him.”
“I want to know what you were talking about earlier,” said Harry. He took a step closer to Malfoy, who stepped back looking alarmed. “It sounded like you need help.”
“Their relationship is not for me to disclose, but Professor Snape cares about Draco very much. I would wager he sees Draco as good as his own son,” said Dumbledore thoughtfully. “But enough on the Malfoys. Are you still interested in hunting a Horcrux?”
Malfoy snarled at him and his hand went for his wand, but Harry was quicker. He pushed Malfoy’s sleeve up and saw pale, unblemished skin. No Mark.
“Definitely not,” said Harry firmly. “Besides, in case you’ve forgotten, he’s not the only one who has cast the Cruciatus curse.”
,” she said, her face contorting in disgust. “Okay. At least we’re not facing Slytherin tomorrow. Okay. But really, out of all people, Malfoy?”
A roar went up from the Gryffindor stands and the team converged upon him, yelling and slapping him on the back and ruffling his hair. Harry vaguely noticed Ginny grabbing Dean Thomas and kissing him, and Ron waving the silver Cup in triumph.
“I heard someone crying and wanted to see if they were okay,” said Harry, lying through his teeth. He was absolutely terrible at comforting people but he was at least sure confessing to stalking the other would not be conducive to the situation at hand.
“You will never believe what happened with Malfoy,” said Harry as he swung his legs over the bench next to Ron.
Malfoy laughed disbelievingly, but the fight had gone out of him. “Even the ones who have used Dark Magic? Hurt other people without a care in the world?”
Snape said nothing, but a muscle in his jaw jumped. He and Dumbledore stared at each other for a long moment. Snape looked away first, his mouth curving downward into a sneer.
Harry grabbed his Invisibility Cloak and sneaked past his snoring roommates out to the common room. If he hurried, he could beat Malfoy to the Room of Requirement and maybe see what he’s up to.
“You will never cease to make my life that much more difficult, will you Mr. Potter?” said Snape despairingly, and pointed his wand at Harry’s face. “
(“But why were you holding his hand for so long?” “I was not holding his hand!”), Harry went to find his two best friends for dinner.
“I don’t stare,” said Harry, tightening the strap on the Quaffle unnecessarily to avoid looking at Ginny. “And there’s really nothing going on.”
Malfoy was fastidiously spreading raspberry jam on his toast as he listened to Blaise Zabini. Harry looked up at the staff table and saw with relief that Dumbledore had chosen oatmeal for breakfast.
Malfoy snorted. “After the fiasco last year at the Ministry? The Dark Lord doesn’t trust my family at all.”
“Get your filthy hands off of me,” snapped Malfoy. He pulled hard against Harry’s grip but Harry refused to let go.
After wasting some time (untruthfully) convincing Myrtle that he and Malfoy would no longer fight and even more time (very much truthfully) convincing Myrtle that he was not interested in Malfoy like
The practice went fairly well for everyone except for Harry. He had several narrow misses from Bludgers when his mind wandered to thoughts of a certain blond-haired Slytherin. After the fourth time he nearly ran into a goalpost, Ginny pulled him aside and quietly informed him that unless he got his mind in the game, he would have to answer to her. Fear of Ginny’s wrath drove him to catch the Snitch shortly after and end their practice scrimmage on a happy note.
Myrtle huffed. “You ignore me when I try to talk to me, then you walk straight through me?” she said indignantly. “How could you? I thought you were better than that!”
Harry was beginning to wonder whether he had imagined seeing Draco at the Quidditch match. His moping drew suspicious glances from Hermione and Ginny, no matter how often he insisted they had the wrong idea. He ended up visiting Moaning Myrtle at her second-floor bathroom a few times to escape their knowing looks.
The only things Malfoy was good at were brewing potions, playing Quidditch, and being a pretentious arse. Voldemort was unlikely to be interested in the last two, and surely he would ask Snape before Malfoy for anything Potions related.
If someone had told Harry that he would be drinking Earl Grey with Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy before dawn, he would suspect they were suffering from a severe Wrackspurt infection. And yet here he was, spooning several lumps of sugar into his tea to the distaste of his Slytherin companions.
“I’ve been busy,” said Snape shortly. He glanced at Alecto and Greyback, then at Dumbledore, and then his eyes seemed to flick towards where Harry was propped up against the wall, invisible.
He ignored Professor Trelawney’s protests and found himself past the gargoyle, up the spiral staircase, and outside the Headmaster’s door with barely any recollection of how he got there. He entered the office without knocking.
“You really are like all the other boys,” she said, scowling at Harry as if he were single-handedly responsible for the emergence of misogyny among teenage boys. “Boys never ask why girls are upset. You just care about yourselves.”
Snape and Draco finally came out of the room, neither looking too happy. Draco looked sullenly defiant, and his silver blond hair was mussed as if he had run his hands through it in frustration. Snape had a vein pulsing in his left temple.
Harry walked out of the classroom in a foul mood. He stormed down the corridor but suddenly felt a horrible cold rush all over his body.
“Why would Snape care so much about Draco? Draco called him ‘Uncle Severus’ before, but they’re not related, are they?”
“I’ll be waiting,” she said forebodingly, sinking slowly down through the floor until she disappeared.
Draco raise his eyebrows. “You’re the one who said you weren’t leaving me alone until I tell you what’s going on. I’m exhausted and I want nothing more than to sleep for the next twelve hours but I’m not going to bed with you coming along.”
There was a silence in which Malfoy looked at him steadily and Harry looked back at those bright silver eyes, just inches away from his own, and knew that in one way or another, Draco Malfoy would be the ruin of him.
“I promised Draco and his family my help should they renounce Voldemort,” said Dumbledore sternly. “As Headmaster, the safety of my students are of the utmost importance to me. Even if Draco isn’t at Hogwarts at the moment, he is still a student of this school.”
A large hulking man came into view. He had wild yellow eyes and a tangle of grey hair matted with what was unmistakably fresh blood. His jagged nails were so long they resembled claws. He bared his long teeth in a parody of a smile.
“There’s only so much time I can listen to you talk about what his different hairstyles mean,” agreed Ron over the indignant hoots. He gave the owl a piece of toast. The owl ruffled its feathers and glared balefully at Hermione before taking flight and clipping her head with its wing.
Sure enough, Harry was standing next to the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy when Malfoy came into view. The Slytherin took a few steps, hesitated, and tapped his nose with his wand. Malfoy sniffed the air and looked straight at Harry.
Myrtle squealed and disappeared through a wall. Harry threw up a shield charm, knowing it would do nothing to stop the curse, but all that happened was a small fizzle of violet light. Malfoy furrowed his brow at his wand.
The next few weeks passed in futile attempts to talk to Dumbledore, Snape, or Draco about what was going on. Harry grew more and more frustrated as the three had seemingly disappeared from Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall was covering all of the Defense of the Dark Arts classes, much to the delight of his Gryffindor classmates, though the bags under her eyes suggested she had more than enough to deal with at the moment.
Harry couldn’t sleep that night. All he could think about was what was going on with Malfoy. He wasn’t a Death Eater but Harry would eat his sock if Voldemort wasn’t somehow involved. But what would Voldemort trust a sixteen-year-old to do?
“What a shame you failed your O.W.L.! But alas, it was just as I foretold,” she said, waving her hands mystically and almost falling into the wall. “Many people doubt my abilities, though I have never once been incorrect. Dumbledore knows this, he understood my gift the very first time we met at the Hog’s Head for my interview.”
Draco shakes his head. He knows Ron means well, but he doesn’t want anyone to see him like this. It’s already hard enough to see the concern on Harry’s face all the time. He doesn’t think he can manage Ron’s pity next to that.
Draco comes by on the weekends. His mother won’t let him stay all the time. I get that she wants to spend time with her son before he goes back to school, it’s just that I miss him when he’s not here. I love talking to him, and kissing him. Mrs Tonks lets him sleep in my room when he’s here. I sleep much better with Draco against my back. I’ll be glad when we’re back at Hogwarts and Draco can crawl into my bed every night.
That morning we had Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. During Herbology I could see that Draco was still upset that his mother hadn’t written to him, so in between our classes, I pulled Draco behind one of the greenhouses and kissed him senseless. It helped put a smile back on his face and I had been wanting to do that ever since we got back at school. I’ve missed Draco during summer break, more than I can admit. Sometimes it feels like I’m incomplete when he’s not around. Is it supposed to feel this intense when you are in love? I don’t think Blaise and Luna are this obsessed with being together all the time as Draco and I. And Hermione wasn’t like this when she was with Ron. Sometimes I’m scared that Draco and I are to close, but then he smiles at me and everything feels right and I can’t help but smile back.
The door opens, and Teddy walks in with two large cups in his hands. Harry holds the door open and smiles at Draco. It’s the first real smile he’d seen on Harry’s face since the scan. Apparently, Teddy hasn’t lost his touch to cheer Harry up when he’s down. Something Draco hasn’t been able to in the last couple of days.
What if he stays alone in the library? And then Pettigrew shows up. What if Harry’s dream comes true?
“Hey little monster,” Draco says as he takes the boy from his mother and holds him close. “Have you missed me?” he asks. Vincent nods and then rest his head against Draco’s shoulder and almost falls asleep instantly.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. In a way, Neville is right. Why do you have to come out as gay, but not as straight? It is kind of unfair. As if it isn’t hard enough to figure it all out, and then you have to announce it too. He looks at Neville, at his soft smile and accepting eyes. Harry moves without thinking. He pulls Neville in a quick hug and whispers a thank you before letting him go.
And then on Monday Herbology got cancelled. We have that class with the Hufflepuffs this year, so I decided to go look for Justin and explain. I went looking for him in the library, but he wasn’t there. Some of his house-mates were and they were talking about me. They said that Justin had gone back to their dormitory to hide. That he should be careful now that I had marked him as my next victim. One of the girls asked if Ernie was sure. And he said that I was a Parselmouth, so I must be a descendant of Slytherin. And then they said that I had a run in with Filch and the next thing you know, his cat gets petrified. And that Colin was annoying me at the Quidditch match when I wanted to leave, next thing you know he gets attacked. Hannah then said I always looked so nice and I thought that was nice of her. She also pointed out that I had made You-Know-Who go away. But Ernie also had an answer for that, that only a really dark wizard would have been able to defeat him, especially because I was only a baby. And that that is probably why he wanted to kill me in the first place. That Voldemort didn’t want another Dark Lord competing with him.
“Yeah, sorry,” Ron says in a softer volume. He bends over the table again so they can whisper. “But a werewolf teaching? That’s asking for problems.”
Of course, Draco was really surprised to see me sneak into his room yesterday, but he didn’t hesitate for one moment, he just lifted his blanket and let me crawl into bed with him. He asked me if he was dreaming. I told him I was really here. Then he asked me why I was at his house and I told him that I had run away and that I was afraid that I won’t be going back to Hogwarts because I did magic. Draco said it would be okay, that the Ministry would understand that it was an accident and that I shouldn’t worry. He kissed me then and that made my worries ebb away. I fell asleep in his arm and woke up with him staring at me. It was really nice.
When Draco was swimming some laps I took of my own clothes and joined him in the bath. It was so deep that my feet barely touched the bottom. Draco swam to me and wasted no time before he started to kiss me. And it didn’t just stay with kissing. For the first time, we had more space than our small bed and it was just perfect. He turned me around so I could lean over the edge while he entered me, his hands roaming over my body. It was amazing and we both found pleasure and were still having when we both had a heart attack. Out of nowhere, someone said that this was quite the show. We turned around and spotted Myrtle sitting cross-legged on top of the taps.
I yelled and rolled back onto the pavement, just before a purple triple-decker bus stopped beside me. The name ‘The Knight Bus’ was spelt in gold lettering over the windshield. A conductor leapt out of the bus and introduced himself as Stan Shunpike. He spoke loudly into the thin air until he noticed that I was sitting on the ground. I got back up, looked for the massive black dog I had seen only moments before, but it was gone.
“Don’t be a fool, Neville,” Hermione says. She doesn’t look up from the paper but skims through the article about Pettigrew.
After that, he tried to obliviate us, couldn’t have us blabbing his secrets all over the place. So I reached for my wand and used the Expelliarmus spell to disarm Professor Lockhart. Ron caught the wand and flung it out of the open window. I was furious. Professor Lockhart said he couldn’t do anything to help Draco, because he didn’t know where the Chamber of Secrets was. I spit at him that he was in luck, because I knew and that I also knew what was inside. I told Neville to go find Professor Snape or Professor McGonagall and to tell them to find us in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Neville ran off and Ron and I forced Professor Lockhart to come with us to the bathroom.
“It’s the rat,” Harry signs as he takes a step closer to Draco and Pettigrew. “Can you worm out of his grip?”
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco starts when he and Harry find a private spot to cuddle up together to stay warm.
Off course we also had to get all the books for our standard subjects like Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells Grade Three. When we got at the Tonks home after our shopping Draco spent the first hour going through the books, looking up things he finds interesting. He’s a nerd from time to time, he just doesn’t like it when I point that out.
As time went by my scar started to hurt more often. I tried to ignore it, only Draco notices everything and I know he was getting worried. I told him I was fine, but the fact that I wasn’t sleeping well on top of it, made it so that Draco didn’t believe me. I kept having nightmares about Voldemort, hearing him laugh when he killed you, mom, and then seeing a hooded figure with blood dripping from his face staring at me. It woke me up screaming a couple of times. And every time I did, Draco was next to my bed in seconds to make sure I was alright.
Included with Draco’s letter was my first ever birthday card. I placed it on my bedside table while I read his letter. But I was interrupted a couple of times. Firstly by Hedwig who came back with a birthday card from Hermione. She’s in France, enjoying her holiday by learning about the local history of witchcraft. A little later Ron’s family owl Errol showed up with a card from Ron. He is in Egypt with his family after they won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. Ron is also getting a new wand next year, which is good because that broken wand of his causes more problems than it solves.
That evening during dinner Draco and I got into a fight. Blaise was coming up with all kinds of ways to get passed the age restrictions for the TriWizard tournament and I’m not even sure anymore what happened but it ended with me and Draco shouting at each other. I think I said something nasty about Draco’s parents and he got really upset saying he didn’t want to see me anymore. I yelled back that he didn’t need to and turned around to leave. Blaise later said that Draco was crying by the time I had turned my back and reached out his arm to grab me, to stop me. But before he could reach me there was a loud bang and someone roaring: ‘Oh no you don’t laddie!’. I turned around to see Professor Moody walking towards us, his wand pointing right at a pure white ferret that was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, right where Draco had been standing. Draco was nowhere to be seen. I took me two seconds to realise what had happened. Professor Moody had turned Draco in a ferret.
“Don’t disagree,” James says. “You’ve got a massive crush. You might even love him if you’re anything like me.”
“Is it normal that it takes this long?” Harry asks. He looks at Draco from the other side of the small waiting area.
“You’re an idiot for making us do this,” Ron says when they sit down underneath a beech tree close to the lake.
“He won’t,” Hermione says. She places her hand on top of Harry’s. It forces him to stop fidgeting with his sleeve.
Six years have passed since that day. Six beautiful and loving years. Until two months ago. Until the worst day in Harry’s life.
Draco has known that this day was coming. The last time they saw Hermione, she was huge and kept saying she wished the baby would just come already. So when Ron phoned Harry this morning to say they were on their way to the hospital, that it had started, it was no surprise. So now he and Harry sit in the small waiting room at the end of the hallway, while Hermione is giving birth to her little one. And all Draco can think off is how it’s been nine months since new years. And that for nine months he still hasn’t managed to conceive again.
Sorry for the long wait everyone, moving countries takes up more time and stresses you out more than I expected. I'm back on the writing wagon now and hope to post a new chapter at least every two weeks. But I can't promise a regular schedule, real life still takes priority.
Harry nods his head. He understands that. He feels it too, he thinks. He can’t imagine himself with anyone other than Draco. “How did you know she was the one? That you shouldn’t give up?” Harry asks.
They sit and drink their tea in silence for a while. And then Andromeda starts up a conversation with Harry. Draco doesn’t listen to them. His eyes keep drifting to the teddy-bear in his hand. He remembers the weekend Andromeda forgot to pack it, and Teddy had a nightmare. The only way to get the boy back to sleep was to let him sleep in Draco’s arms. And now Teddy has given his most significant comfort to Draco, to make sure Draco will feel better. Tonks and Remus should have been so proud of him if they could see him now. If only things had turned out differently, if only Draco had been braver, maybe the world would have been a happier place today.
“He’s telling everyone who wants to hear that Harry is gay,” Ginny says with contempt, followed by a softer “Is Harry okay?”
“Of course Tedster,” Pansy answers and then she turns back to swirling around her glass of wine. Draco shakes his head and gets up. He sits down next to Teddy on the floor.
“They are going to catch him,” Harry tells Neville before he turns and follows Oliver out of the entrance hall.
Harry flies them over the Great Lake and then back to the Quidditch field. He lands softly. Draco lets go of him and Harry doesn’t want to admit that he misses the arms around him straight away. But then he looks at Draco. His cheeks are flushed and his hair is blown out by the wind. And there is a massive grin on his face.
Uncle Vernon also put a padlock on Hedwig’s cage, so she can’t fly around. She’s bored like hell. Just like me. But she is lucky; she’s not having an emotional crisis because her best friend kissed her on the cheek. And she’s not the one not capable of sending a letter to her other best friend to ask her what it means. No, that’s just me. And I’m scared of the owl that will arrive with Draco’s letter, will he say anything about it in a letter. Will he explain why he did it? And what am I supposed to write to him now? Does he expect me to say anything about it? I’ve been trying to write to him, but I just don’t know what to say. I can’t put in a letter that I’m confused, that I don’t know what it all means. AARRGHH, it’s driving me insane.
The next thing I remember is waking up when the train was moving again. The lanterns had come back on and I lay on the seat. Draco was knelt next to the seat, his hand brushing through my hair. I felt really sick and was glad I was laying down. Draco asked me if I was alright and I told him I was fine. I asked what happened and what that thing was. And finally, I asked who screamed. Draco told me that nobody screamed. I stuttered that I heard someone screaming. Draco looked at me with his worried face and kept petting my hair.
I think it was a good thing that Wood was a keeper because he looked like he wanted to hurt one of our team. Points went back and forth for some time, but Slytherin stayed in the lead. If was just never enough to win the cup. So even though I spotted the snitch a couple of times, I didn’t chase it. Every time I spotted it I faked a look of concentration and pulled my Firebolt around toward the other side of the field. McLaggen kept following me, not spotting the snitch but being stupid enough to think I would lead him to it. Like he could outfly me if I would spot it first.
The blush is back on Draco’s cheeks. A real tear slowly makes its way down his cheek. Harry reaches out and gently wipes it away with his thumb. Then he leans in and places a kiss on Draco’s lips. “I love you,” he whispers when he rests his forehead against Draco’s forehead. Draco’s hands play with Harry’s hair for a little and then he pushes Harry away. His hands move and Harry’s heart skips a beat when he sees Draco’s fist turn in front of his chest and then point his finger at Harry.
Ron was sorted in Gryffindor and he looked happy to be there. I wish I was sorted into Gryffindor as well, at least then I would have had one friend in the dormitory. Now the only person that even says hi to me is Zabini.
When the show is over, the others move back into the house. Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads him further away from the house. He smiles and lets his free hand brush the leaves of some bushes they pass.
Other students enter the Entrance Hall, and one of them runs into Harry. “Sorry,” the boy shouts as he moves towards the Hufflepuff common room. It shakes Harry into action. He waves at Draco and then walks up the stairs. When he’s halfway up to the first floor he turns and watches as Draco makes it down the stairs. It hurts watching him go. “Fuck,” Harry mutters and then he continues his tread to Gryffindor tower.
Harry takes some food from the fridge and places it in the oven to heat up. Then he pulls off his shoes and climbs the stairs. He turns on the lights in their bedroom. Draco lays under the covers, with his back turned to Harry.
It’s because of that stupid duelling club that Professor Lockhart tried to start up last week Wednesday. Hermione and I thought it would be fun and useful. Learning how to duel might help with keeping the bullies at bay. It’s not as bad as last year; it’s mostly just Nott saying mean things. But Hermione is right, and now that Draco isn’t teaching me defensive spell anymore I’ll have to learn them somewhere else.
It’s the right thing to say. Draco brightens up and then moves in to kiss Harry. Harry lets him. They might not kiss for some time after this. Harry will ask his parents if Draco can come to visit. But Draco’s parents might not agree to it, and then they won’t see each other for two months. So Harry makes sure that Draco knows he’s loved before he has to go to a home where love seems to be lacking.
“Yes, you need to make the broom hover,” Harry says. “That’s the hard part. You control the broom with the movements of your body. You lean forward when you want to speed up, or backwards when you want to slow down. It’s easy.
Harry puts his book down and strokes his hand over Draco's back. He leans over and places a kiss on Draco's neck, just below his hairline. Draco used to love it when Harry would do that before sex became a necessary evil. Now it’s just a reminder of how big a failure Draco has become. He doesn’t want this to last. He just wants Harry to dump his sperm inside him. What does it matter if Draco enjoys it or not?
We thought we were safe, and then the only person that could see us showed up. Professor Moody walked in on the scene and he looked right at me and Draco. We stared at each other for some time. I was sure he was going to give us away and get us in real trouble. But he turned back to Snape and they had words. Snape had mentioned to Filch that someone had been in his office and Filch let that slip to Moody, and then Moody and Snape had this little argument on the stairs. Moody said something about spots that don’t come off, and Professor Snape suddenly seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it hand hurt him. Later that evening, when we were back in our bed, Draco told me about the Dark Mark, the sign of the Dark Lord that was tattooed on his followers left forearm. He told me his father has one, and that he knows for sure that Professor Snape also has it, that he was part of the Dark Lord’s followers. That there was no other reason he would grab for his arm like that.
Only Potter can’t be gay. That would be insane. He’s the boy who lived. The saviour of the wizarding world. Nobody will want to have a gay saviour. But then again, nobody wants a gay Malfoy heir either. And they got that anyway.
Harry looks over the lake and shrugs. “I can’t help it, Neville,” he says. “He’d made studying fun, somehow. And now it’s just painful.”
Ron pats Harry on his back. “The gay boy who lived. I can’t wait until Seeker finds out about this.”
“Mister and Mister Potter,” a familiar voice says from the other side of the room. It is healer Burke, and Draco lets out a long breath. The Auror is saved by the bell.
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his. “Don’t give up hope, Draco. Our time will come.” Harry looks up at Draco, his green eyes still filled with hope. Draco can’t take it. Harry should hate him. But the man in front of him loves him. Draco doesn’t understand. After all, Draco has done, after the massive price Harry paid for Draco’s actions. Sirius would still be here, for one. Draco is sure of it. And now Draco is the reason why Harry is going to be childless for the rest of his life. How is it that Harry can just let all that slide and still love him?
The car stops on the driveway, and Neville and Luna step out. Luna moves the car seat so Draco can get out.
Before I could reach Dobby he had darted out of my room and down the stairs. Dobby was sitting on top of a cupboard and Aunt Petunia’s pudding was floating up near the ceiling. I begged Dobby to put it back, but he wouldn’t unless I would promise not to go back to school. I told him I couldn’t and then he dropped the pudding on the floor and vanished.
It’s only two more days before they all go back to Hogwarts. James has been called into work this morning. Harry and Neville both know why, but nobody says a word about Pettigrew. Sirius stops by after lunch and takes Draco with him on a little trip to a shop that specialises in products for deaf people. Harry slumps into his room and drops down on his bed. Neville follows him and drops down next to Harry.
Only that also never happened. The Dark Lord sits, eats and talks to his Death Eaters. He never contradicts the lies that are told about Draco. He keeps up the ruse that Draco killed Harry Potter, that it was intentional and not an accident. If only Draco knew why. Maybe then all this would make sense. Maybe then he can prepare for the years to come. For the life he never wanted. The life he choose to fight against. On that faithful day, when everything changed for the entire world.
Harry closes his eyes. “It hurts,” he says. “The way he told me to leave him alone. It was clear he was angry. I have never seen him sign like that.”
Well, at least I now know what I’m supposed to do for the second task. Not that we have any idea how I’m going to do it. But we still have a couple of weeks before the task, and Hermione and Draco are sure we will find a way for me to breath underwater.
Harry leaves the butter and picks up a slice of bread. He takes a bite and forces his jaws to move. Even toasted the bread is still uneatable. He drops the slice and walks out of the kitchen. A picture of him and Draco still stands on the cupboard in the hallway. Harry looks at it. They smile and look so happy. Harry remembers when it was taken. They had just moved in together. All was right then with the world.
“Fuck, you crazy idiot. What were you thinking going after the snitch like that? You could have died,” Adrian shouts. Draco doesn’t respond. He has no idea what to say. Everything is messed up right now. And it’s all so unfair. Harry was the good one. The person that would defeat the Dark Lord and make this world a better place. Draco should have been the one that fell, not Harry. Who will lay dead and broken on the ground by now.
Potter kissed him on their last day together. Draco kissed back, afraid to let the lips go that made him feel whole for the first time in his life. Potter died hours later by the hands of the Dark Lord. It comforted Draco to know it was a quick and painless death. It was on the front page of the Prophet. The picture showed how the green light hit him and how he fell down like a broken doll. Draco cried. He would get out of his cell, he would find a way to stop this all. His chance came when his father made a mistake and dropped his wand. The wand rolled into the cell. Draco took it in his hands and pointed it at his chest when he spoke the words Avada Kedavra.
After a while, Draco urged us to continue to walk up the path back to the castle. When we were about halfway there we saw Ron and Neville run towards us. I pulled off the cloak and we stopped them. Draco told them it was already too late and Ron let out some curse words that shocked Neville. Hermione gave Scabbers back to Ron and he was happy to see the rat. But Scabbers was writhing in Ron’s hand, plainly terrified of something. That is when Hermione spotted Crookshanks. Scabbers slipped from Ron’s fingers and scampered away. Crookshanks sprang after him and before anyone could stop him Ron was running to catch up with them. Hermione yelled after Ron and was gone in seconds. Draco, Neville and I looked at each other for a second and then we were sprinting after them.
To change the subject, Draco had picked up the egg and opened it up. It was still wailing and I pushed it close, the sound making me feel nauseous. And then Myrtle told us to try the egg in the water. Apparently, that’s what Cedric had done. Draco asked her if she had been spying on Cedric too. She said, of course, she had and even asked Draco if he’s ever seen Cedric, who would not spy on a good looking boy like that. Draco agreed with her and I slapped him, told him that his boyfriend was standing next to him. So he kissed me and said that I was the only one he ever wanted to see without his clothes on.
“I’m sorry,” the healer says again. Draco tries to remember her name, but his mind is blank. Slowly the healer slides the probe she used for the echo out of him. Draco wants her to put it back, to have another look, to tell him that she was wrong, that she made a mistake.
Draco swallows away the lump in his throat. “It will be an honour,” he says. His voice sounds small, but it’s all he can manage. He’s just heard what his death penalty will be. At least it will be quick and painless. Dumbledore is not a man that tortures his enemies.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says again. A bit louder now and with more confidence. He’s genuinely sorry. “For all of it, the baby. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep him safe. I’m sorry I’ve destroyed our chance to be happy. You’ll be better off without me. You and Teddy both.”
“Maybe. But you can still talk to him,” Remus says. “We haven’t done anything yet. And I can wait until you have discussed it with Malfoy before I talk to professor Flitwick, if you want.”
“And I love you too, even if you are the idiot that brings Slytherin blood into the family,” James continues.
And he didn’t start work at Hogwarts alone. He took Winky, Mr Crouch his house-elf that he fired after the Quidditch World cup. She cried all the time we were there. Dobby told us she doesn’t like being free like he does. And he really does. Draco is extremely happy about that. He had been worried about Dobby ever since he set him free, and knowing he’s in a good place, doing what he likes and being free, well it brought a beautiful smile on Draco’s face.
And then there is Potions, where I’m still forced to work with Malfoy. We’ve studied the different types of Cauldrons and Vials that we are supposed to use, but I don’t really get it. Malfoy always makes sure we have the right ones because he loves Potions. He’s really good at it, which makes it hard to keep up with what he’s doing during class. We’ve been making some potions like the cure for boils and the herbicide potion, but like I said Malfoy makes them and I just watch.
Harry rubs his hand through his hair. Why can’t the book put it down this simple? Somehow Draco can explain the material in a way that makes sense to Harry. This is why Harry works on this essay now. He will never be able to do it without Draco’s help. Even his mum can’t explain it as Draco does. When she does it, Harry also gets confused half the time.
“Oh, Harry, don’t be all bothered,” Hermione says. “You know why I think it’s stupid. Not because it’s a bad plan, but because I don’t think Malfoy wants our help. He’s not going to copy my notes,” she explains.
Harry turns to look at Neville. It’s the first time he’s called Draco by his first name. “You called him Draco,” Harry says.
And then this Saturday Draco had his first Quidditch match of the season. Slytherin was playing against Gryffindor. I know he was nervous in the way he snapped at everyone. And for the first time since I had made friends in Gryffindor, I didn’t at all feel conflicted about which team I should be cheering for. With me in the black books of the Gryffindors, there would be nobody giving me a hard time for cheering for Draco and our own house.
Myrtle told me how to do it. And I’m going to. She’s right if life is this bad it’s better to end it. And I’m going to. When I’m dead I can be with you and everything will be okay. So tonight, when everyone is asleep, I’m going to go to the bathroom and break a mirror. I will use the glass to cut open my wrist. Myrtle told me to not do it horizontally, but vertically, from the bottom of my hand and then straight down over the veins that are visible there. She promised it would be quick and painless. She asked me if I would come to her as a ghost so we can haunt the bathroom together, but I told her I wanted to go to you. That it is time I would get to know my parents. And she understands, even though she is sad to see me go. But it’s for the best. I know that now. The world will be better off without me.
Harry sits up a bit when Madam Pomfrey is done with all her check-ups and has given him some potions for the pain and dizziness.
Draco laughs and tells Hermione they will. They say their goodbyes and Draco puts his phone away. He rests his head on Harry’s shoulder and watches the telly with him in silence. His mind races and he can still feel the hole in his heart, but the strong arm around his shoulders helps, and maybe soon the pain will be replaced by the joy of a new little miracle of their own.
The landlord of our campsite was a muggle and was really confused about all the crazy people that had pre-booked and looked like crazy people that kept showing up. Mr Tonks had a nice chat with him. Being Muggle-born, he was able to settle the man a little and he showed us on a little map where our site was. The entire field was filled with tents, some of them looked muggle, but a lot of them didn’t. Our spot was at the edge of the wood at the end of the field. With the guidance of Mr Tonks, we set up two small tents. One for Tonks and her father, and one for Sirius, Remus, Draco and I. The tent looked very small from the outside, but once you would get in it was pretty large. It had two bedrooms, both with bunk beds. Sirius told us we could have one just for the two of us, as long as we promised to keep our hands to ourselves.
In the end, Dumbledore gave out some extra points before the house cup was awarded to Gryffindor. We went up from the fourth place to the second. Dumbledore gave 50 points to Ron for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years and 50 points to Hermione for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, making Gryffindor’s lead even greater. And then he rewarded me 100 points for pure nerve and outstanding courage. Those points made us go to second place, but Gryffindor was still a 110 point in the lead. But seconds was always better than last, at least that is what Blaise said, but most Slytherins were still upset about losing.
Draco found comfort in confiding to a ghost, the crazy Moaning Myrtle, about his fears and struggles. He didn’t want his mother to suffer for days before she would pass away, or even be the reason she would die. His father would never forgive him.
Hermione rests her head on Harry’s shoulder. “I think you’re wrong. The way he stares at you, and wants to be close to you all the time. He might feel the same as you,” she says.
Harry can’t die today. He has to get his wand out and slow down. He has to tell Draco that he likes him. Because Harry does. He likes Draco. It’s more than just an urge to kiss him. It’s everything. Every minute spent together. Every skipped heartbeat because of Draco. And Harry won’t let that slip away just because he fell off his broom.
Draco pulls out of the kiss and stares over Harry’s shoulder. His eyes light up when he spots their friends. And maybe Harry can be kind. It’s their last day at Hogwarts. Their last trip to Hogsmeade this year. And it’s clear Draco is going to miss them all. Not just Harry. So Harry turns and waves for them to join them. They all sit in a way that Draco can see them easily and that brings a smile to Harry’s face. They’ve all adapted to Draco being deaf so quickly, and without complaints. Hermione and Ron are even learning how to sign. Hermione is making progress, but Ron is a disaster. He can’t seem to remember what he should do with his hands. Draco shakes his head and at one point even takes Ron’s hand in his to make him stop.
Malfoy nods and then packs away his things, including the book about wizard BSL. He stands up and motions for Harry to follow him. Harry rushes to put his things away and together they walk to the DADA classroom. When they get there Malfoy takes out a new piece of parchment and a quill and hands them to Harry. Harry gets right down to business.
Finally, after another corner, I came to a solid wall on which two entwined serpents were carved. I told them in Parseltongue to open. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves sliding smoothly out of sight and I walked inside. By then I was shaking and terrified of what I would find.
It's dark by now. Harry had to stay late at the school to have an unpleasant conversation with some parents that think their child is an angel. Harry sometimes wishes he could use a Pensieve to show them what a brat their kid is.
The afternoon goes on. Harry puts away his Snitch at one point and drifts off a little. Ron is already snoring. Hermione flips page after page in her book and Neville’s pencil scratches over his paper. The sun is warm and Harry feels good. It’s been a while since he felt normal. His heart still aches when he thinks of Draco, but it’s slowly healing. Maybe this summer isn’t going to suck after all. Harry will enjoy the good weather, the beach, and hopefully a couple of weeks at the Burrow, practising Quidditch with Ron and Ginny. It will be nice to have Ron join Harry during Quidditch practice. The others are great, but they are all older and still treat Harry as the baby of the team. Not that Ron joining will change that. Ron is older, and about eight inches taller by now. If he keeps growing as he’s done this year, Harry will soon need a step to be able to look him straight in the eyes.
Harry hates the idea that Pettigrew is still on the loose. It’s been months. James had promised they would have him back in Azkaban in no time at all. And even though James never meant to break that promise, it happened anyway. Harry is angry. His dad is supposed to keep them all safe. That’s why he works for the Auror department. And what does it even mean that they still haven’t found Pettigrew. Are they all incapable of doing their job? Or is Pettigrew that smart that he can stay out of their sight? Did James tell his colleagues that Pettigrew can turn into a rat? Or is he keeping that a secret to protect Uncle Remus?
My whole body was in pain and I just couldn’t move anymore. Goyle left then, saying I would have sure learned my lesson by now. But Nott and Crabbe stayed. They walked up to me and started kicking me, first in my stomach and at my back. And after a while I felt Nott’s feet hit my head, breaking my glasses. The glass got stuck in my eye and I screamed from the pain. I passed out after the second kick against my head. I don’t know how long they continued after that. I only know that I woke up hours later in the hospital wing with a bandage on my eye and in a lot of pain.
Iris doesn’t move out of Harry’s embrace until her friend Johanna comes to fetch her to go study in the library. She hugs Neville and Harry before she leaves. Harry watches her sprint out of the Great Hall, all excited about spending her Saturday morning in the library. Harry will make sure she will keep enjoying every minute she spends at school. He will keep her safe. Just as he will keep Neville safe. And Ron. Mrs Weasley will kill him if anything will happen to Ron. And Harry isn’t ready to die. He’s still got plans for his life. He needs to catch a rat, teach a stubborn Slytherin how to use sign language and then become a professional Quidditch player before he joins the Auror force. But to make sure that happens he’s got to make sure Neville never gets close to Pettigrew. Because a life without Neville is unimaginable. He’s been Harry’s brother for as long as Harry can remember, and Harry will always need his brother by his side. So, there is only one thing he can do. He will go after Pettigrew alone and kill the rat. It’s the only thing he can do to keep Neville, Iris, Remus and Sirius safe.
He walks to his fireplace and takes a hand of flu powder. He takes a deep breath and then steps into the green flames.
There was another Hogsmeade trip this weekend. Of course, I was not allowed to go, but I found a way to join Draco there. It all started with me borrowing a copy of Which Broomstick from Marcus. I wanted to read it, to see what kind of broom I should get as a replacement for my old broom. I’ve been using a school broom at practice. It’s a Shooting Star, which is very slow and jerky. I need a new broom. I took the book after I kissed Draco goodbye and went up to find a nice alcove with window to sit and read. I wanted to be able to look over the grounds, see the fresh snowfall and the world go white.
So for an entire week, I had to pretend that I went to St. Brutus’s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys, was not allowed to do any ‘funny’ stuff and I was to keep a civil tongue when talking to her. I woke up Hedwig as soon as Uncle Vernon left to tell her to go stay at the Weasley’s for a week, that it wouldn’t be safe for her to stay with Aunt Marge around. I’m sure one of her dogs would go after her. After that, I made sure all my cards and letters from friends, just like my schoolbooks were put away safely.
Harry laughs. “I will,” he says. “And you say hi to Uncle Sirius for me,” he shouts as he runs back towards the castle. His head spins. He needs to find a way to get Malfoy to accept his help. Harry can teach him some basic BSL so Malfoy can understand what Snape and Remus say      in class. And he can help him by writing things down for him. Or even just pointing him in the right direction. Harry will have to step up his game, but he knows he can do it. There is no need for Malfoy to always be alone.
The prefect gave us some simple rules, like that only Slytherins, are allowed to go into the common room and that boys and girls are not allowed to go to each other’s dormitories. I share my dormitory with Malfoy, Zabini, Nott, Goyle and Crabbe. There are no windows in the dormitory and the place is lilted by a green light hanging from the ceiling. The beds are four-posters hung with Slytherin green velvet curtains. Our trunks had already been brought up and placed by the separate beds. Mine is straight across of Malfoy’s bed. I had to wait until all the other boys were done in the bathrooms before I could go to brush my teeth. They didn’t want me in there with them. Zabini gave me an apologetic look when Malfoy forbade me to follow him. After I brushed my teeth in silence I quickly put on my pyjamas and went to bed. I closed the curtains and tried not to think of how mean the boys were being to me.
“You’re wrong,” Harry whispers. He can’t find his voice. James had warned them that Pettigrew was dangerous. But they didn’t listen. And now, Neville is gone. He would have moved by now if he wasn’t. And it won’t be long and then Harry and Draco will die too. It will all be over. Why did Harry break his promise? He should have listened to his dad. He should have kept them all safe.
“What’s up with him?” Ron asks with his mouth full. Harry doesn’t pay him any attention. If they want this to work, they can’t show up late. Someone else would have taken the back seats in the classroom and Harry won’t be able to explain to Malfoy what’s going on. He can’t leave that up to Hermione. She will be all business-like and just scare Malfoy away. And Harry needs this to work. He needs to make Malfoy’s life easier. He doesn’t know why, he just knows he has to. It would be what his parents would do. It’s what they did for Sirius. And now it’s Harry’s chance to show that he can think of someone else. That he can take care of others.
And there is talk about closing the school for good. Meaning I would have to go back to the Dursleys, for the rest of my life. I would never see Draco again. And I can’t do it. I can’t do any of it, momma.
The wards around Draco’s room fall. Draco jumps upright and quickly wipes some tears out of his eyes. Not that it will do him any good. His eyes must be pussy and red and his cheeks are still wet from the tears. Everyone will know he’s been crying as soon as they see him.
After that, we were allowed to go and Hermione pulled me into an empty classroom as soon as we were far enough away from Professor Lockhart’s office. I know she is worried, about me hearing voices and she said it was a good choice not to tell them, it would only make me look guilty. She also explained to me what a Squid is, it’s someone born into a wizarding family without any magic, but I’m sure you would have already known that.
It was all so nice. And then it all became horrible. Professors McGonagall and Flitwick came into the Three Broomsticks, together with Hagrid and the Minister of Magic Fudge. Draco and Hermione pushed me under the table just before they all took a seat at the table next to ours. They talked about the Dementors and Sirius Black. How Sirius Black used to be your best friend, dad. That the both of you had been inseparable when you went to school at Hogwarts, like brothers. They talked about how Black had been the best man at your wedding and that you had named him my godfather. And that wasn’t even the sickest thing about it. He betrayed you, gave you up like you mend nothing to him. I heard them talk about the Fidelius Charm, how Black had been your Secret-Keeper and had given up your location to Voldemort.
And in Defence against the Dark Arts, we are supposed to be learning about Doxies, Gnomes, Snails and Imps at the moments according to our book, but professor Quirrell only talks about vampires and how to fight them off. We are also supposed to learn spells, like shooting green and red sparks and a wand-lighting charm. Ron has shown me how to make the sparks come from my wand when we were reading through our DADA book. It was very easy and I feel like I could be good at DADA if the professor would just stop obsessing about vampires. I’m glad some of the charms are also part of the charms curriculum, like the wand-lighting charm.
I hit my head pretty hard on one of the falls and struggled to get up after that. I tried to crawl to the door. I screamed for help. But nobody heard me, and they just kept going. I was crying by then and I was so afraid. When would they stop? Would they keep going until I was dead?
“What do you plan to do, boy?” Pettigrew asks. He turns his wand back to Draco’s throat. “You better drop that wand, or your little boyfriend dies.”
I see that Draco already explained most of what happened yesterday to you. He’s sleeping now, he’s got his hand twisted in my t-shirt. He’s scared, just like me. Yesterday was bad. Cedric is dead. Every time I close my eyes I see him getting hit by that awful curse. He just fell to the ground, like he was a string puppet who strings just got cut. And all I can think off is that Voldemort did the same to you. He used that curse to kill both of you. I’ve known for some time now that this is the way you died, but seeing the curse happen, it has made it worse.
Tomorrow we are going to Diagon Alley. Our school letters arrived today. I was a bit surprised that my letter had arrived here at the Burrow, but Mr Weasley said that it seemed that Dumbledore already knew I was here and that the man doesn’t miss a trick. I have to catch the train at King Cross on the first of September and I will need a lot of new school books, most of them written by Gilderoy Lockhart. Fred thinks we’ll have a witch as new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher because of this.
But before I could another try, Draco was going to try to cast a Patronus. He would stand behind me so that the Boggart would turn into a Dementor. I felt cold and the white fog was surrounding me again when I heard Draco’s voice, so steady and certain. And then a beautiful Tiger leapt out of his wand and chased away the Dementor. Professor Lupin was speechless and I just looked at Draco and felt my heart almost burst out of my chest. Draco had done it on his first try! I kissed him then and Professor Lupin had to scrape his throat to get us to focus again. He was very impressed and told us a female Tiger was a beautiful Patronus to have. That it represents patient and protectiveness.
On Sunday I told Hermione about what I had heard and she was also afraid that it wouldn’t take Snape long to find out how to get past all the protection that was in place for the Sorcerer’s Stone. So she and Ron started to tell people off that were making fun of Quirrell his stutter. And I’m giving the professor a friendly smile whenever I can.
“You’ve heard me sing. I will never be able to do what you do, makeup notes and words and make them work. You should have become an artist,” Harry says as he sits down next to Draco. Draco takes Harry’s hand and places it on the keys. He pushes the fingers down as he leans his head against Harry’s shoulder.
They go to the Quidditch World Cup final. The game is amazing and Harry has a great time. He spots Lucius Malfoy with his wife. Harry’s heart speeds up while he searches if Draco is with them, but they appear to be alone. Harry is disappointed, but when the night turns into a riot and the Dark Mark appears in the sky, Harry is glad that Draco wasn’t there to witness it all.
“Yes, but we also promised not to go after Pettigrew,” Harry says. “And it’s Ron. He hangs out with us all the time. He won’t mind.”
And then Hermione goes off, explaining how she’s always scared that she will fall, and that a lot of accidents happen during broom rides. Harry falling off it isn’t the first and certainly not the last one. The numbers are bad, only nobody seems to care and it stays a form of transport. It’s barbaric, according to Hermione. Neville signs along, but the movements go too quickly and Draco has already pushed his parchment back to Harry, who scribbles as fast as he can to keep up with Hermione’s words. Draco doesn’t read it yet, he tries to follow Neville’s movements. It’s great to see how hard Draco tries to get the hang of BSL. It warms Harry’s heart and it makes butterflies chase each other in his stomach.
“Harry, it’s okay,” Remus says in a gentle voice. “We know now. And we will help Malfoy as much as possible. But he has to want it. We can’t make decisions for him.”
Hermione puts the paper down. “I might not have grown up with it,” she says. “But I do know what that man did to your family.”
The next day Nott followed me around the castle and I was afraid to go to Myrtle’s bathroom to talk to her. She was the only one left in the castle I could talk to. Isn’t that pathetic, Hermione is away for the holidays and I’m left with only a ghost of a dead moaning girl to hang out with. Nott tried to hex me all day and I used the Expelliarmus charm on him a couple of time with success, stopping him from tripping me with his leg-bind jinxes.
“I know you’re talking about me,” Hermione says. Her hands struggle to keep up with her words, but she’s trying. Even Ron has started to sign some small words, like yes and no. It will take time before they are all fluent, but it’s a start. And it helps Draco to feel included.
‘Well, you did,’ Malfoy writes. ‘And you did again when you told the teachers. Nobody is allowed to know.’
The game started out good. Lee Jordan, a friend of Fred and George was commenting and had to be reminded a couple of times to stop advertising the Firebolt and focus on the game instead. I just flew around, looking for the golden snitch. Chang was a good flier and followed me around the pitch. The most fun in the game was every time I passed Draco, seeing he was in possession of the Quaffle and he would blow me a small kiss. He scored the first goal of the game and most of the goals for Slytherin after that. He’s really the star of our team and I’m so proud of him.
Harry snaps out of his mind when Malfoy slips away from his arm. Harry turns to see Malfoy fall to the ground, his body limp and his eyes closed. Harry crouches down and lifts Malfoy’s face in his hands. He quickly checks if there are no wounds from Malfoy’s fall. “Don’t leave me,” Harry whispers. “Everyone else has already left me. I want to be your friend.” Harry doesn’t know where that comes from, but he knows it’s true. He wants to be Malfoy’s friend and help him.
These last two weeks have been unreal. First off, Draco kissed me. Like really kissed me, on the lips and everything. And now we can’t seem to stop. I love feeling his lips on mine. It’s the best thing ever. And I’m glad we get to do it whenever we want now because when he first did it, I thought it would be the last thing I do before I died.
I also showed Hermione the get well card I had received from Professor Lockhart. She thought it was amazing. I still think it’s too much. He was wishing me a speedy recovery as a concerned teacher. And the way he signed off is just ridiculous, as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award. Who cared that he won the most-charming-smile award. That doesn’t say anything about his abilities as a wizard, or as a teacher. So I gave the card to Hermione. It made her happy and I enjoyed that at least one of us was still finding the strength to smile.
Before Hermione and Neville left for the holidays we’ve been searching for information on Nicolas Flamel in the library. You remember the name Hagrid dropped when we talked about what Fluffy is hiding. Well, he seems impossible to find. We’ve been through hundreds of books, but we can’t find him anywhere. He isn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century or in Notable Magical Names of Our Time. But we have to find him; it’s the only way to discover what Snape is trying to steal.
“I’m still not going to let you win,” Harry says. “Nothing will persuade me to give you all the glory on a silver platter.”
When we told Hermione about the Firebolt she agreed with Professor Snape, saying my safety was more important than a broom. Draco called her a heathen after that. He’s angry at her because of it, so we are spending a little less time with her. She’s still in our little study group, but I haven’t spent time with her outside of that. Daphne told me to stop being stupid, that she’s my best friend and that she’s just looking out for me and that I would do the same for her. I know she’s right, so I send Hermione a message to ask her if she wants to hang out this coming Sunday, just the two of us, to catch up and hear about her Christmas holiday with her parents.
And then, out of nowhere, something hit Draco hard across his face, knocking him off his feet, landing on the floor beside me. Neville and Hermione also got hit and we all ended up on the floor. I lifted my wand and made light come from it to see what was happening. It turned out we had moved to close to the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking and whipping around to stop us from getting any nearer.
“Yes, I want the potion,” Draco whispers. It’s a sentence he never expected to say, it goes against everything he fought for four years ago. Harry’s arm pulls him close, and Draco cries against his chest.
“But if Pettigrew is hiding as a rat, he’ll be impossible to find,” Ron says. “There are probably a million rats around Hogwarts.”
But the worst part about the Yule ball was that we had to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas break. And I wanted to go to the dance, the weird sisters were coming and they are really good. But for the first time in my life, I also had a proper home to go to. I had kind of looked forward to celebrating Christmas with Sirius. Sirius wrote that it was fine and that we would just have to make the next summer holiday extra special. But it still felt wrong to stay at Hogwarts now that I have a home and a family that loves me.
“Harry, you want us to take you to the hospital wing?” Neville asks. He pushes Harry upright and looks at him with a weak smile. Harry should say something. He should move and go on with his life. Only he doesn’t know if he can.
I’m fine by the way. Madam Pomfrey said I’ll be allowed to leave before dinner tonight. I didn’t break anything or got hurt, I just fainted. The only reason I had to stay overnight is that Madam Pomfrey is worried about me since this is the second time I passed out because of the Dementors.
Harry stares at him, hoping Neville can feel the daggers that Harry spits with his eyes at his brother for this betrayal.
“Don’t I know,” Harry says. “You would think that me having a boyfriend would stop them from hitting on me.”
Iris smiles, gets up and walks over to the Ravenclaw table. She waves towards Harry and Neville and then sits down between her new housemates. Harry slumps in his seat and stares at the Ravenclaw table. “She can’t be,” he whispers.
“Harry,” Lily says. She turns him around with her hand and places her other hand on his other shoulder. It won’t be long, and Harry will be the same height as her. She hardly has to look down at Harry. Her face morphs into one of compassion when she looks at him. She pulls him against her and circles her hands around Harry.
Harry looks back at Hermione. “Sorry,” he says. “It’s just. I don’t want you all to get the wrong idea.”
Neville doesn’t answer. He starts to walk towards one of the other traps they set for Pettigrew. Harry follows him in silence. When they are close to the next spot Neville says: “Yes, I still fancy her.”
Later that evening I told Draco that even though it was horrible to hear the last moments of my parents replayed inside my head, that it was also the only time I had heard your voices since I was a very small child. Draco kissed me and told me I shouldn’t chase their echoes, that it won’t bring them back. And I know he’s right, but I kind of want to hear you both again.
Some older Slytherin students made me leave the Slytherin table in the great hall this morning, saying I should go hang out with my Gryffindor friends since I was only planning on shaming my house. I hope they won’t do anything worse to me, like what Nott and Crabbe had done to me in March. My eye has healed mostly by the way. I did need new subscriptions for my glasses because my eye is a little worse than before. But I can see everything just fine with my new glasses.
Draco kissed me in front of the whole school then. He took my head in between his hands and told me he would be right there waiting for me. He told me to be brave and rested his head against mine for a small second. I nodded and turned to the door, alone and scared.
We also started our lessons with Professor Lupin. He still looks ill and Draco said it wasn’t that strange. He didn’t want to tell me why, but I know he and Hermione figured something out that I haven’t. It’s really annoying. But Draco says it’s not for him to tell and that I can figure it out for myself if I would just think about it some more.
The answer is simple. Draco signs: “Dad.” And then he looks away and out of the window. Harry follows his gaze. The sky is black and the lights reflect in the window.
So now, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Harry have placed their books on a table in the Gryffindor Common Room. Hermione works on her study schedule for the coming exams. They all still don’t get how she gets to all her lessons and how she hasn’t collapsed under her workload yet. Ron is busy with his Charms essay and Neville reads something to do with Herbology. And Harry stares at his books and has no idea where to start. He hasn’t done a thing for school besides showing up to his lessons since they’ve been back from Easter break.
The next day we had our Care of Magical Creatures exam. Hagrid didn’t seem like himself but we all had to focus on our exam so we didn’t really have a chance to speak to him. Potions was that afternoon. And even though Draco helped me study I just couldn’t get my Confusing Concoction to thicken. It was kind of frustrating to see Professor Snape’s disappointed look when he came to check my potion. Draco asked me afterwards what whet wrong, but I didn’t know. I thought I did everything as we had practised in class.
It’s a fun afternoon, and Teddy is excited when he opens his presents. The new broom is a big success, and it doesn’t take long before Harry pulls out Draco’s and his brooms so they can go flying with Teddy. But Teddy only wants to fly with Ginny, saying she’s the best. So Ginny takes Draco’s broom, and she and Harry take off with Teddy to the backyard to fly around.
The best thing is when Malfoy shows up for DADA and motions to Neville that he needs to go find a different spot.
This Saturday Draco and his mother met Mrs Tonks and me in Diagon Alley to do all our shopping for this school year. I wrote to Hermione and she promised to come as well. Our first stop was Quality Quidditch Supplies. Draco had told me about the new broom that came out just two weeks ago: the Firebolt. We went to go take a look and had to manoeuvre around other people to take a good look at it. It’s a beautiful broom and has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds. The Irish International Side is going to use them this season. I wish I was bold enough to buy myself one, but my Nimbus 2001 is a perfectly good broom. Draco begged his mother for one. I’ve never seen Draco beg like that before. He really uses all his little tricks, teary pleading eyes, promises of studying hard and buying his mother the best Christmas present ever. It didn’t work though. His mother told him he just got a new broom last year that will be just fine. Draco was a bit cranky after that. But not for long after I pulled him into a little nook and give him a proper kiss, he was smiling again after that.
“Fuck you, Harry!” Oliver shouts back. “Be glad you are the only decent Seeker in our house, or you would be off the team now.”
He wanted to know how I, a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent, who even wasn’t smart enough to kill himself properly, managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How had I escaped with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort his powers were destroyed? I asked him why he wanted to know and he told me he was Lord Voldemort. That it was the name he had fashioned for himself, a name he knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when he had become the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Also, I'll be going on holiday in a view days and will be without internet for most of the trip so it will be at least two weeks before I'll be able to update this story again.
James snorts. “Oh my,” he says. “So you’re in love with a boy who wants to date girls, and Neville is falling for a girl who wants to date girls. What did I do wrong? Where did I fail as your parent?”
A book slams closed in front of Harry. Harry looks up and sees Malfoy stare at him. His lips flatten as he holds his chin high. With force, Malfoy tears a piece of parchment off the bottom of his essay. He picks up his quill and starts to write. Harry follows the movement of Malfoy’s hand with a soft smile on his face.
By then Hermione was pulling me out of the Great Hall. People on either side of me drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Hermione dragged me all the way to Myrtle’s bathroom before she turned on me and asked me why I had never told her I was a Parselmouth. I told her I didn’t even know what that mend and she explains it means I can talk to snakes. I told her I know I can talk to snakes, that I once accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo. I thought loads of people could do it, talk to snakes. But it turns out it’s very rare and that it was bad. I asked why it was bad. Didn’t people understand that if I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin… And that is where Hermione cut me off and told me that she could only hear me speaking Snake language and that it sounded creepy. I had never realised I spoke a different language, and that still freaks me out a little. How can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it? And then I asked again why it was bad and Hermione told me that being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for and that now the whole school will be certain that I’m his great-great-great-grandson and therefore the one who attacked Colin and Mrs Norris.
“Ask your best friends, they’ve just scarred me for life,” Draco tells him. He opens one of the cupboards and starts to take out the champagne glasses. Harry takes a couple and kisses Draco on his cheek.
The classroom door opens and Malfoy stands up from the floor. He goes inside. Harry, Neville and Hermione follow him. As usual, Malfoy finds a spot at the back of the class. He sits down and pulls his history textbook out of his bag.
“And he’s deaf, Harry,” James continues as if Harry hadn’t even responded. “That is. Well, it makes things even more complicated.”
I almost didn’t go to Grimmauld Place. Sirius told me he fought with headmaster Dumbledore about it. The headmaster wanted me to go to the Dursleys. Said it was saver, that my mother's protection would protect me there. Sirius didn’t agree, and as he’s my legal guardian, he decided I would stay with him. This house is unplottable and protected in other ways. Sirius is sure it’s safe, and I trust him. I would have hated it if I would have been at the Dursleys again. Here I have people that understand what happened and don’t care that I wake up screaming for Cedric almost every night.
Viktor stood over Cedric, who lay on the ground, twisting and jerking around. I used Stupefy on Viktor to make him stop. I couldn’t believe he did this, I thought he was a good guy. He was always friendly towards us, joined us for dinner on multiple occasions. And even Hermione liked him in the end. But it looks like he was a cheating bastard after all. We did send up some red sparks so the teacher could get him out of the maze. I didn’t want to be responsible for him getting eaten by a Blast-Ended-Skrewt.
One of Harry’s hands wipes a tear from Draco’s face. Draco looks up at Harry, and his heart breaks even further. Harry’s eyes are filled with love and understanding. Draco still doesn’t understand how Harry can be so kind to him when they talk about the baby they lost because of Draco.
I’m crying now. I haven’t cried in a long time. But being here, all alone at Privet Drive, not having my friends nearby to talk to, it makes me sad.
The only problem is that the traps are always empty. Even regular rats don’t seem to get trapped in them.
The trip down to the potion lap is short. Harry stops in front of the door. Maybe Malfoy isn’t in yet. Maybe Harry can go in and see Malfoy has the day off and then he will have him as a friend for one more day.
Ron mutters something and Ginny starts to laugh. Harry looks at the chessboard and shakes his head. “I thought you were the chess champion,” Harry jokes.
Ron groans and drops his head on his Charms book. “I’m going to have to learn too, don’t I?” he asks.
This is when Draco remembered that Voldemort had summoned his followers, and he asked if his father had been there. I just nodded, I didn’t want to tell him how his father had spoken about Draco. Greg didn’t need to be told, he just said that his father would have come too. Then Millicent said she was sure her dad would too. And then Neville did the most amazing thing, he said that didn’t matter, as long as they all knew what was important, and that if they needed, they could all come to stay at his place to stay safe. And that is how I know I have the best of friends, and that even if things will take a turn for the worse now, I’m not alone. None of us is.
“You found something more important than beating Slytherin with Quidditch. You can’t be the real Harry,” Ron explains. Neville laughs and then looks the other way when Harry gives him an angry stare.
At some point, a Bludger hit Krum who broke his nose, but the referee didn’t see because his broom was on fire and Krum just continued the game with a bleeding nose. At that moment the Irish Seeker suddenly went into a dive, he’d seen the snitch. Krum sped after him and they drawled level while they hurtled towards the ground. Lynch smashed into the ground and Krum rose up into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand. He’d caught the snitch. The final score was 160 points for Bulgaria and 170 for Ireland. Remus asks why Krum had cot the Snitch and both me, Draco and Tonks explained to him that it was clear that Bulgaria was never going to catch up to the Irish.
They both burst out in laughter and Harry almost drops his glass. “I don’t know,” he blurts out. “Because it’s the biggest Quidditch tournament ever. And because it’s our favourite sport.”
Harry looks at his dad. His mouth is set in a thin line, and Harry knows that he won’t be getting any good news.
And that is when Draco woke me up. It took me some time to realise it was still the middle of the night. Draco handed me some water and then I curled back against his chest and let his sweet words dose me off to sleep.
“No clue.” Harry lifts his shoulders and takes the fabric from Hermione. It’s softer than the fabric of Harry’s robes, still new and shiny. Harry puts the fabric in his pocket and returns his focus to his breakfast. He’ll throw it away later, just like he’s done with all the other little tokens he’s received all summer for saving the world.
He and I have been getting along well this last month. You remember me telling you that I thought he was staying awake at night to make sure Nott and Crabbe would behave. Well, I was right. He fell asleep during History of Magic that Tuesday and he could hardly stay awake at lunch. So I asked him about it that evening when he was walking me back to the dungeon. He first tried to brush it away, saying he got plenty of sleep and that it was nothing. So I told him I don’t blame him for what happened and that he doesn’t need to protect me, that I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. He screamed at me then, saying I clearly did need protection, since I had spent two weeks in the hospital wing after Theo had beaten me up. And that I was crazy if I thought that he would let that happen again. I just stood there, looking at him with my mouth open, not knowing what to say or do. Malfoy was really worried about my wellbeing and that was just too crazy for words. After a couple of seconds, Malfoy started walking again and I just followed him.
I don’t have that much more to tell you. I’m doing good, even after all the heartache of the second task. I’m happy and school is going good. Having so many friends to study with really helps.
Hermione picks up the fabric and turns it around in her hand. “It’s the same material as our robes,” she says. “Why would someone send you a small piece of robe fabric?”
“Harry James Potter, you are brought before the Wizengamot to be trailed for the crimes you committed. I understand that you have waived the right to have an attorney present. Is that correct?” Shacklebolt says.
"Please tell me you didn't, " he says as he kneels. He pulls the duvet from Draco's face. Draco's eyes are closed, and Harry grabs his shoulders.
But on more fun subjects, Defence Against the Dark Arts is quickly turning into my favourite subject. Professor Lupin is a very good teacher. We’ve studied Red Caps (little goblin-like creatures that lurk wherever there has been bloodshed) and Kappas (creepy water-dwellers that look like scaly monkeys) so far. Draco is a little bit shy in the class ever since the Bogart incident, but none of the Gryffindors says a word about it. I think Ron and Neville told them not to, I haven’t really asked them. We don’t see them that much lately, only in class. Ron and Hermione are not getting along anymore. I asked Hermione, and she just said that Ron is a stupid moron. Draco thinks she still loves him and that she wants him to take the first step, but Ron is clueless, so he doesn’t get that Hermione wants to be his girlfriend again. And their pets seem to be on a warpath too. Seamus said that a couple of weeks ago Crookshanks had jumped Scrabbers again. And when Brown got the news that her pet died, it even made Ron and Hermione fight a little until Professor McGonagall opened the door to her classroom and we could go in.
But back to Dobby. He wears a tea cosy as a hat and he’d decorated it with a Christmas bauble. He gave us both our presents, two pair of socks. Dobby had made them himself. We both had one sock filled with Snitches and one with broomsticks upon it. Draco was really happy with them and Dobby asked him to put them on right away. That made Draco blush because that would mean getting out from underneath the blankets and well, he had no clothes on. Blaise threw some boxers our way and told us to get dressed and make the elf happy so he could go back to sleep. He didn’t care about his presents at all, not like Greg who was already unwrapping them. Draco put on the boxers and then got out of bed to pull on the socks. Then he walked to his trunk and took out a package he gave Dobby, a gift he apparently had gotten for the elf. Dobby opened his package and then his mouth dropped open. Dobby was shaking his head and saying master Draco shouldn’t be giving Dobby this. But Draco insisted he takes it, that it used to be Dobby’s when he still lived at the manor and that he deserves to have them back. It turned out Draco had given him a set of photo’s of when Draco was little, some of them had Dobby in it, and some were with an older elf. After Dobby left, Draco explained that the older elf had been Dobby’s father who had passed away when Draco was six or seven.
“Draco, I know you’re struggling. You’ve been sick this entire pregnancy. Not to say your emotional state. We all want you to be okay, so let's make sure you will be after our little third miracle is born. We’ll have four beautiful children and I want to enjoy them with you, not just by myself.”
That closes the topic and Ron focuses on the game in front of him. He beats Neville in three moves and then they all shuffle back to the Great Hall for lunch.
The others get up softly. Ginny and Hermione both give a short wave towards Harry and then they all turn and leave Draco and Harry alone. Harry is grateful. Draco seems uncomfortable and Harry isn’t sure Draco wanted to tell them all. But maybe when it’s only Harry he’ll open up.
“Nobody gets it,” Neville says. “But it’s starting to take its toll. She yells at Ron more and more. This way they are never getting together.”
When I finally made it to diner I got informed about the news that the delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang would arrive on the 15th of October. And arrive they did. The entire Great Hall had been decorated with enormous silk banners representing the Hogwarts Houses. And in the afternoon we all had to gather in the entrance hall with our cloaks on. Professor Snape ordered us into a line, with the first years in front and the seventh years in the back. Then we had to line up in front of the castle and wait. I leaned against Draco and Professor Snape ordered me to stand straight and to behave. Blaise laughed next to me and whispered to me that clearly, Professor Snape has lost his brain if he thought Draco and I could behave ourselves. I snickered and laced my fingers into Draco’s, just out of view of Professor Snape.
Dobby hadn’t only woken me and Draco on Christmas morning. Draco’s screams woke Blaise and Greg. Blaise asked if we could please put up some silencing charms, that he didn’t need his Christmas ruined by our filthy habits. And then we could here Nott. He sounded angry about the fact that Draco and I were sharing a bed and he stormed off to go tell Professor Snape. I expected Crabbe to follow him, but he just said ‘can’t believe it took him this long to figure out that the lovebirds never stopped sleeping together’.  Greg and Blaise laughed and for a moment I thought that maybe we could all become friends one day again.
Only when the holidays had started, I and Ron kind of forgot all about Flamel, because we were having so much fun. We spend a lot of time next to one of the fires in the Great Hall, eating anything we could spear on a toasting fork. We started plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled. That was so much fun to talk about, even though the plans would never work. I didn’t mind going to the dungeons at night during the holidays, because I was the only Slytherin still at the castle. So I had the entire common room for myself and could take long baths without being afraid of getting beaten up. My longs don’t hurt that much anymore and the bruises have all healed.
Normally, Harry would push his dad away from him as soon as possible. But today is different. His dad needs to hold him for a bit. And Harry needs to be held. He almost died and left them all behind. But he’s still here. Alive and done with keeping his sexuality a secret.
Hogwarts is not as nice as I thought it would be. I’m sitting now in my bed and wished I was back in my cupboard. At least there I was left alone. Dudley had been afraid to be in the same room as me and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia acted like I wasn’t even there. But it was better than this.
It was then that there was another knock on the door and Draco’s father strode into Hagrid’s hut. He had a cold and satisfied smile on his face. He didn’t seem to notice me and I was a bit relieved about that. I didn’t want to know what he would say to me if he even knows who I was and how I feel about his son.
“No, you can think it over, and when you come back next week for the second scan we can go over it all again, and you can decide what you want then.”
“Draco didn’t leave you, did he?” Ron asks. Draco bites his lips. Of course that is the first thing on Ron’s mind when Harry looks like shit. Draco most have done something wrong, something to hurt his best friend. And he’s not wrong. Draco gave Harry the one thing he wants more than anything, only to destroy it a couple of weeks later.
Harry rounds a corner, coming up to the other park of tables. The chairs here are still on the floor. And one of them is occupied by Draco. His back is turned to Harry, as he leans over a big book. Harry can’t stop the loving smile that forms on his face. Draco is completely in his element, unaware of the time and his surroundings. Harry has stared at him often enough when they were still friends. Draco never noticed then, or pretended he didn’t. It was the best part of studying with Draco. The time's Harry could just look at him and feel complete.
“They might,” James says. “Sirius’ parents used to scan his mail, make sure he didn’t get anything inappropriate. It’s why I never wrote to him during the summer. They didn’t like me all that much. Draco’s parents might do the same.”
“Ron is going to kill you,” Harry says. “No doubt about that. He’s too protective about his little sister.”
Draco lays his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulls him against his chest. He doesn’t interrupt and he doesn’t say anything about the tears that moister his shirt.
The next day I stayed in the Slytherin common room, avoiding Ron because all I could think about was going back to the mirror at night. I set down on the floor in front of the mirror and planned to stay all night. But I wasn’t alone in the room. Headmaster Dumbledore was sitting on one of the desks by the wall. I hadn’t noticed him at all when I came in. He sat down next to me on the floor and told me all about the mirror of Erised. That it shows us what we want, that it shows our deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. And then he told me that many men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. The mirror was moved after that and I promised the headmaster that I wouldn’t go looking for it. He told me it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Before I left I asked headmaster Dumbledore what he sees in the mirror and he said he sees himself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks. That it was because everyone always gave him books and all he wanted was to get some nice socks. I don’t think that was a trued full answer, but then again, it is quite personal what the mirror shows, and the headmaster probably didn’t want me to know.
During the train ride, I bought a lot of candy from the trolley witch. I know I had said I wouldn’t spend all your money on useless things, but I was very hungry and I wanted to try out all the new strange candies. I shared my candy with Ron. He only had corned beef sandwiches and he doesn’t like corned beef. I liked the chocolate frogs the best, one they are chocolate and two they have cards of famous wizards. I now have cards of Albus Dumbledore, Morgana, Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, Merlin and Druidess Cliodna. I think I’m going to try to collect a lot of them. They will be able to keep me company when I feel alone.
James pulls him into a sideways hug. “You fool, he’s a Malfoy. How could you ever fall for a Malfoy?” he teases.
After some time they get up from the bed and make their way downstairs and start a movie on the television. Draco has no idea what it is about. His mind is blank, and all he can focus on is Harry laying against his chest. When the movie comes to a close, Draco feels sick. His stomach hurts, and he knows it’s starting. The first cramps are manageable and just annoying. But it doesn’t stay that way. Within a half-hour, Draco lays on the sofa with a pillow pushed against his stomach. He screams in pain with every cramp. Harry sits in front of the couch, one hand holds onto Draco’s hand, the other hand keeps sliding Draco’s hair from his face.
The next morning Zabini and Malfoy waited for me before they walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Hermione gave them a friendly smile before she took my arm and escorted me to the Gryffindor table to eat with them. And either Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean, Fred or George walk with me through the hallways. And then at the end of the day, Zabini and Malfoy come to take me back down to the dungeon. And it looks like Malfoy is hardly sleeping at night. He has dark circles underneath his eyes and he starts drifting off in class more every day. I think he stays awake at night just to make sure Nott and Crabbe don’t hurt me again.
Harry looks back at the water. Naming all the people he loves who are still alive always helps. It was a trick his mind healer thought him, a way to remember that not everyone dies. Maybe Harry should make an appointment with him again soon. Just to talk about what has happened. Find healthy ways to cope with this loss and to see if he has ideas of how Harry can help Draco move on too.
Charlie’s friends came only minutes later and they rigged Norbert up in a harness so they could suspend him between them. We helped them buckle Norbert safely into it and then they were gone. We slipped back down the spiral staircase. I felt horrible and didn’t feel like going back to the dungeon where I would find an upset Draco. And I didn’t really get a chance to get back there, because we had forgotten to put the invisibility cloak back on. I left it on top of the tower and I’m sure I’ll never see it again. And on top of that Filch was waiting for us at the foot of the stairs.
Harry hums in agreement, but he can’t get his eyes to move away from the blond hair that swings around Malfoy’s face to take a look at how Hermione is dancing with Krum.
I told Sirius what Hermione was up to and he wrote back to wish her good luck with trying to accomplish the impossible. I also wrote to him about Moody and his mistreatment of Draco. I know Sirius doesn’t really like the fact that Draco and I are together, but he said that I should tell him when Moody goes too far. And that he would write Moody to ask him to tone it down a little, to not think that my friends are the same as their parents. It’s nice to see Sirius look out for me and Draco. I’d never known how good it is to have an adult that will always be on my side, no matter what happens. So thank you for making him my godfather and making sure I’d have someone now that both of you are gone.
“Our dear young Malfoy showed what he’s worth when he killed Harry Potter. I’m sure he can handle old Dumbledore. He will kill him before the end of this school year,” the Dark Lord says.
The sun is setting by the time Draco wipes the tears from his face. He takes a couple of deep breathes and pushes the pain away. With dreaded steps, he makes his way back to the castle. He just needs to remember that he’s a hero. One who’s proud of what he did. Not a boy, slowly dying on the inside because the love of his life died yesterday. No, he’s a Malfoy. A dedicated follower of the Dark Lord. The one who killed the Boy who Lived. He has to be, for mother.
Harry smiles. His heart beats in his throat. Draco doesn’t want him to die. Because he calls Harry his best friend. The smile falls from his face. Harry is just Draco’s best friend. Harry can’t tell him what he feels for Draco. It will ruin their friendship. Draco just said it. They are just best friends. Nothing more and nothing less. Harry is gay and falling for a straight boy. But he’s gay. There’s no doubt about that. Harry has known for a while, but now he’s a hundred percent sure. Because his heart has just shattered into a million pieces. He’s only Draco’s best friend.
Draco is acting weird since the first day off school. Harry doesn't understand. It's like last year didn't happen at all.
Harry shakes his head. “I never paid him much attention,” he says. “Not until today, at least. I think he’s lonely.” Harry takes another bite of his chocolate bar. He knows Remus won’t let him be until the bar is finished.
“You shouldn’t have rescued me,” Draco shouted on that first day. “You’re throwing away your life. And what for? A school crush?”
And on top off all that, we also lost the game. Diggory had caught the snitch just after I fell. He hadn’t realised what happened and tried to call it off. He even suggested a rematch, but everyone agrees that they won fair and square. It’s why Marcus is a bit upset with me right now, and apparently with Terence.
Hermione is somewhere in this room. He’s seen the paper when she was elected into the Wizengamot. Harry was proud of her. Still is. But that doesn’t matter now. She will not give him any favours. She will hear his testimony and know she won’t be able to claim he’s innocent. Because he isn’t.
After that everything became a little hazy. Headmaster Dumbledore ordered everyone around. He told Tonks to go and set the real Professor Moody free, and then he ordered Snape to get his best trued serum and for Professor McGonagall (who was checking up on Sirius) to go and fetch Winky. The headmaster told me that the person that just tried to kill me wasn’t the real professor Moody. That the impostor had used Polyjuice potion to hide in plain sight all year.
Hermione wanted to talk to us about Rita Seeker. She had figured out how she got around the school and knew so much about everything. It turns out that Rita is an unregistered Animagus and can turn into a beetle. And Hermione had her captured in a jar. Hermione set her free when we got to London. She made Rita promise not to write another story for an entire year. If she does, Hermione will spill the beans on Rita.
Harry’s mind brings up a blank. What else could they get him that is related to Quidditch? Unless it has something to do with the World Cup that starts in two weeks. He shoots up and looks at his dad. Did they really? Will Harry go to the Quidditch final? But mum said it was too expensive. And Harry doesn’t want them to struggle because of his dream.
Harry clutches Remus his clothes in his hands. He doesn’t want Remus to let him go. He lets out an uncontrollable whimper and closes his eyes.
Harry can’t stop the massive grin that spread on his face. “I guess I have,” he says. He looks at Draco who’s still talking to Lily. Neville has joined them, while they wait for Iris to say goodbye to her friends. Harry looks around to see if Ron and Hermione are still here, but he doesn’t see them. He’ll write them tomorrow once he knows how grounded he is during this summer holiday. Harry does see another familiar face. Draco’s father makes his way towards them, and he doesn’t look happy.
I went to have tea with Lupin the next day. I wanted to know if he knew that Black had betrayed them, and why he still had a picture of him in his office. But first I asked him if he knew why the Dementors affect me so much. I don’t want to fall off my broom again if they show up again for our next Quidditch match. I told Professor Lupin that I’m scared that I’m weaker than the others. But he assured me that it has nothing to do with weakness. It all has to do with all the bad things that have happened to me. Professor Lupin explained it to me. That Dementors drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around you. Even Muggles can feel their presence. When they get close every good and happy memory will be sucked out of you, only leaving the worst experiences of your life. Professor Lupin said that the worst that has happened to me is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. And he might have a point, but that doesn’t mean that I want to faint every time they are near. Even though I’m sure that the woman I hear screaming when they get close is mom. I think I hear you’re final moments, how you try to protect and save me.
Harry looks up from the parchment and sees as Malfoy bites down on his bottom lip and stares past Harry. It’s heart-breaking and Harry again wishes he could just reach out and take Malfoy’s hand in his.
Lessons have started again, and Hagrid seems to be in a better mood. He taught us about Salamanders and we spend the entire lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep a fire blazing. Divination is crap as always. We are now busy with palmistry and Professor Trelawney told me I have the shortest lifeline she has ever seen. She also wasn’t happy with the length of Draco’s lifeline, but at least it’s longer than mine.
‘Malfoy, you don’t have to tell us anything. But we would like to know why you are upset with us? We didn’t mean to upset you in any way, so by knowing, we will be able to make sure it doesn’t happen again,’ it says.
Harry still stares at the picture of Pettigrew. It’s a picture of Pettigrew when he was sentenced to Azkaban, and is twelve years old. But already, Pettigrew’s face has some rat-like features. His mouth looks a little bit like a snout. And his eyes are tiny and black.
Draco kept holding on to my hand on our walk back to the castle. Nott made a disgusting face when he passed us into the Slytherin common room. He went straight to bed, but I stopped Draco from following. I told him about the stone and Fluffy and everything and that I now think that someone very weak wants it, someone, who lost all its power. And then it came to me, Hagrid had told me the first time I met him, that some people said that Voldemort was dead, but that he might also still be out there, weakened and searching for something to get him back to power. Something like the sorcerer stone.
“Did I tell you all about the food in Egypt?” Ron asks. “It was good, as long as they didn’t tell you what was in it. They eat crickets as snacks. Can you believe that?”
“Of course you can. She’s just a baby who wants to meet her uncle Draco,” Hermione tells him. Draco looks at Harry on the other side of the bed. He hopes he’ll take Rose instead. Draco doesn’t know if he can keep the fake smile on his face in place if he has to hold the little one.
“Don’t take crap from anyone,” she continues after a short pause. “George is right, it’s nobody’s business but yours. And maybe that Malfoy kid. If that part is true also?”
At once, the cup is back on the table, and Teddy whispers that it’s not allowed. He turns towards Harry and asks him to hand him his tea. Harry stands up and gives Teddy his hot cup of tea. Once it’s safe in Teddy’s hands, Harry places a kiss on top of his head. Teddy blushes and a smile forms on his face.
Harry makes the same fist again, but this time shakes it a little, just as you would shake your head. Malfoy copies the movement.
Harry brings a piece of sausage to his mouth. He chews on it without tasting it. Hermione leans against him for a second in comfort and then changes the subject. Plans are getting made for the day. Harry doesn’t listen to them. He just focuses on getting some food past his lips. He’s hungry, but on the other hand, he doesn’t want to eat. And all the while people keep staring at him. Is this how it always feels like for Neville? The looks and whispers are a pain, only reminding Harry how one little kiss ruined everything.
“I love you too.” Draco chokes on his words. He wishes it wasn’t so, that he could just get up and leave. That way, Harry wouldn’t have to choose between his family and Draco. Then Harry would be able to find someone that can give him that perfect family he deserves.
After those attacks, almost all the students decided to go home for the Christmas holidays. Hermione tried to convince her parents to let her stay, but they agree, saying they missed their daughter, so she also had to go. Draco is also leaving, going to his elaborate Christmas dinner at the manor. I hope he will have a good holiday. I think he’s really scared and sad right night. He’s been crying more often at night. I hear him every time I wake up from my nightmares. They are still the same. I see Draco somewhere, I try to get closer to him and then he disappears. What if he doesn’t come back from the holiday?
Draco and I also visited Hagrid this weekend. He was all dressed up and even tried to tame his hair. Draco joked later that maybe I should go over more often and maybe try to braid Hagrid’s hair into something decent. I told him my braiding skills were only for him and that resulted in a nice kissing match. But back to Hagrid. The Skrewts had started to kill each other and for a moment Draco was hoping we’d be done with them. But Hagrid had put them in separate boxes, so there still like twenty of them. Hagrid made us some lunch and we had a good time catching up with him. When we left his cabin, Madame Maxime (the headmistress of Beauxbatons) passed by and Hagrid was blushing. He looked at her like he looked at his baby dragon and it’s clear that he’s smitten.
After seeing Draco do it so successfully, I was sure I could do it too. So I tried again. Only I fainted again. This time I could hear dad shouting: ‘lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off.’ When I woke up again I said that I heard dad and Draco hugged me close. I was crying and Professor Lupin suggested now might be a good time to stop. Only I wanted to try again. And the third time still wasn’t perfect, I only made a huge, silver shadow come out of my wand, but it stopped me from fainting, so that was a good thing. Draco said he was proud of me and Professor Lupin gave us a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate to eat.
Teddy nods his head and then puts his tea on the table. “I’ll be right back,” he says, and then he turns and leaves the room. Harry puts down a plate with cookies and then sits in the chair next to Andromeda.
Lily smiles at Harry. “He just got here. And we are a lot to take in. It’s busy and chaotic. His own home is probably quite different, as he’s an only child.”
Lily rolls her eyes. “Look, Harry, I know you aren’t together. I just don’t think Draco wants to spend the entire week on a mattress on the floor. He’ll be more comfortable on a bed. So he’ll be staying in the guest room.”
After class I walked out with Hermione, she was very quiet. Ron walked in front of us and was complaining to Neville about her. He said it was no wonder no one can stand her, that she was a nightmare. Hermione took off after that. She was crying and I ran after her.
“Shit, man. I can’t believe they attacked you,” Neville says as he sits back down. “You had some chocolate?”
“This is me,” Draco says. He needs Harry to know that this is a part of Draco that will never entirely leave him. He’s in pain and wants to hide. Even if he gets help and finds a way to battle his demons. But he will try, he will go to a mind healer and try not to push everyone away.
And the article, you wouldn’t believe it if you read it. The only problem is, that most people do believe it. The article only focusses on me, it hardly on the TriWizard tournament. And Cedric isn’t even in it like he isn’t competing at all. Off course this pisses off everyone that isn’t a Slytherin. She made up most of it, quoting me on things I’ve never even said. Like how I get my strength from my parents and that I still cry about how you died. And she outed me and Draco to the entire wizarding world. I don’t know how she found out, but it was in the article how I was in a relationship with the young Mr Malfoy.
Only nothing happened, Nott just kept giving me and Draco lurking faces in the next week. Hermione, Ron, Neville and I spend a lot of time at Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to make him realize he can’t keep the dragon. But he even named it Norbert, like it’s a little child. It had grown three times in length in that first week and Hagrid didn’t do anything else than look after it, ignoring all his gamekeeping duties. Draco didn’t want to come with to Hagrid. He always made up excuses about homework he still needed to do.
“Okay, so we need to wait a week to have another scan, which will tell us the same as now. And then what?” Harry asks. His voice strained, and Draco knows he’s angry. With the healer, for making them wait another week to go through this all again, or with Draco, for not taking care of their precious baby, Draco doesn’t know.
“I know, sweetheart. I’ve already called healer Burke. She said she would send over prescriptions for your birth control potion.”
What if Malfoy is asexual, or demisexual? Maybe this is all a mistake and it will ruin everything they’ve accomplished over the last three years.
“I’m dreading the Christmas dinner,” Draco answers Harry’s question. It’s only half an answer, but it’s all he’s willing to let go. “They are a lot.”
And then the entire Great Hall became silent. It was time to find out who would be the Hogwarts champion. We all hoped it would be one of the Slytherins who had put their name in the goblet. Adrian and Miles were clearly nervous. They both looked scared while we waited for the goblet to light up again. I must say we were all a little disappointed when Dumbledore told us that the Hogwarts champion was Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff. The Hufflepuff table went crazy and Cedric was grinning while he walked to the other room.
“What else did you expect?” Theodore asks. “He was a celebrity. This always happens with celebrities.”
Harry stops and wants to snap at Neville to leave him alone. Only Neville’s face is red and he clumsily pushes his ink bottle into his bag. They will have a fight here in the middle of the common room if Harry refuses him. And Harry doesn’t feel like it. It’s none of anyone's business that Harry is feeling like shit.
Draco grabs the hovering broom and then lifts his leg over it. He sits with his feet still on the ground. Harry steps up next to him and holds him. They nod at each other and then Draco lifts his feet. The broom stays in the air. It’s working. Carefully Harry removes his hands from Draco’s waist, but he keeps them close, just in case. Draco smiles and then shivers. His eyes are wide as the broom moves a little.
The wind rushes in Draco’s ears. His fingers slide over his broom, fighting to hold on. Only the broom is wet and Draco’s fingers threaten to slip off. The rain pours around them, drenching their robes. They get heavier by the second. It won’t be long before Draco’s fingers slip and they would both fall to the ground. If it was just Draco, he would be able to get back on his broom. Only, it isn’t just him. He’s holding the arm of Harry.
We were both shocked when we reached the Quidditch pitch. The pitch was no longer smooth and flat but filled with hedges. At that moment still small and easy to step over, but in a month time they will be about twenty feet high, turning into a maze we’ll have to navigate for the third tasks. When I told Draco about the hedges on the Quidditch field he was just as upset as me. I assured him that Mr Bagman assured us that the field will be back to normal after the tasks and that we would be able to play Quidditch on it again. Not that Draco believes this. Adrian and Miles told him it would all be fine, but Draco just keeps shaking his head and complaining about how unbelievable it is that the pitch has been destroyed. Adrian joked that Draco is turning into a real captain, stepping into Marcus footsteps.
After dinner, it was time for the first dance and when Headmaster Dumbledore moved all the tables to the sides of the room I got nervous. Draco took my hand and whispered in my ear that all will be fine, that I just had to follow his lead. And that is what I did, I let Draco guide me over the dance floor and just focused only on him. Blaise later told us we looked amazing and so in love that it was disgusting. Daphne and Luna both told him to shut up, saying it was the cutest thing they’ve ever seen. I didn’t even realise when the first song had ended and others had come onto the dance floor. I was just enjoying myself in Draco’s arms. At some point, Professor Snape passed us and muttered the word distance. We both laughed and took a small step apart. Somehow during our dancing, we had moved closer to each other and were getting a bit to close apparently.
