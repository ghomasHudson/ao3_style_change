, his traitorous mind supplied.
Harry shrugged. "I told them if they didn't clear out and come back tomorrow in small groups, you'd tell the staff Lily wasn't allowed visitors."
Draco felt his insides go to ice. He doubted either of these
"And?"
She wasn't sure if it was the sickly green colour Draco had turned or the pleading tone of his

reports from people who couldn't keep their own stories straight. The perp was tall, short, had long hair, and had short hair. He was blond or a brunet, one even stated he was bald! Harry slammed the file shut and rubbed his hand over his face. With one final glance to his still dark screen, he stood, stretched and made his way to bed, still not understanding exactly what happened.
Underneath the signature was a hand-written note from Preston stating that he was available anytime to discuss the contract and its contents with Harry.
Not that he was necessarily keeping the meeting a secret, it was more that he didn't expect it to actually go ahead. That, and he didn't really think he could take another grilling about his
"I doubt that," Harry taunted, "your Beater's aim is shite!"
Draco took his time gathering his gear at the end of today's training session. He'd decided he didn't care if it got him a reprimand, he'd had enough of being paired with Potter every time during hand-to-hand training.

Darian poured him more coffee. "Pretty much all of it."
"And I've illustrated my point. I
The cheers from the crowd were deafening. It took the rest of the team just a moment to cotton on to what was happening, but when they did, there was no mistaking their triumphant smiles and fist pumps in the air. The Appleby fans were screaming, ecstatic. The team did a low flyover of the stands, Harry making sure he flew right over Ron's head. He couldn't help but wonder what his best friend would think of his decision once her husband told her what happened.
"True," Draco laughed. "And it wouldn't be the last time either."
Ludo uncrossed his legs and patted his knee. "Come here, sweetheart. Don't be so stand-offish." His smile turned sickly sweet. "I can make it well worth your while."
Harry began to flip through the pages of the contract. It had so many phrases like
First place was on the line and there were three participants remaining in their seats. Harry glanced at Draco, unsurprised to see him so close to the edge of his seat, he risked falling off of it.
"Hi. Have you got an appointment?"
?" Harry snarled.
Charlie and Deon came over to where Harry stood watching Draco. "Stupid, fucking know-it-all," Charlie snarled. "I told everyone to keep an eye on him. He's been making noises all week about how he had all this experience with mother dragons. If I told him once, it was at least a dozen times that a new mother would not allow anyone close to her eggs."
going to stay?"
"Might wanna have your arse at the door next time. If we decide you get to eat again." He gave Draco an evil glare. "Better try to eat something, they'll be coming for you soon."
Walking quickly beside the little park, he could see the sign for the
Pansy watched as Draco chopped onions and garlic and started them cooking in some oil. He added some minced beef and stirred while it cooked. Then he opened tinned tomatoes and dumped them into the pan. As that simmered, Draco filled a saucepan with water and lit another burner on the hob. Soon that began to boil and he poured some fusilli into the boiling water. When everything was done, he put plates together, added fresh parsley and chunks of crusty bread and set the plate in front of her at the counter.
Draco raised his head high and spoke as clearly as he could, "Yes, sir, I understand and accept the terms and conditions set forth." As the clerk who had led him into the room approached the table where his beloved hawthorn wand rested, Draco closed his eyes. He heard the spell being murmured and felt some of his own magic siphoned away as he if could
Two days later, he left a note, along with the torn out page of the newspaper, on their kitchen table.
Pansy smirked. "So…" she gave Draco a side-eye look, "when was it you finally decided Potter's joggers needed inspection from the inside and while he was wearing them?"
Draco swallowed. "Hello." A startled silence followed, and it sounded as if Harry was moving the phone from ear to ear.
Pansy often expressed her disgust with the way Draco was being treated and normally he just let her rant. But tonight she wasn't letting it go.
She studied him serenely. "I really don't believe it will be an impediment to what we both want."
She giggled in delight, and it sounded like the chiming of silver bells.
He pulled out his phone and replied.
Draco looked around, finding Hermione far enough away that she would never hear him.
"I know. But see, I know something you don't, Harry. I know why James is different from the others."
"So I see."
"Six would be perfect, if you can get away that early. That will give us time to catch up before eating."
When it came time to leave and Pansy picked up her handbag, idly leaving the paper on the table, Draco leaned across and snatched it, slipping it into an inside pocket of his long overcoat.
Pansy gave a negligent shrug. "Oh, I know, but it was far more fun when you thought about what I might say to Potter." She leaned back in her chair, played idly with her champagne glass and added with a smug look. "Now that we've established that I'm a genius, I think it's time to decide what I'll get from you for being right. Don't you think,
"Yep," Harry answered. "Just follow the red-heads."
The Snitch shot away from the rings and dodged and danced over the heads of the Portree fans, who screamed and booed him as he shot past, but Harry never lost sight of it. He chased it down around the Arrows rings, then straight up until he nearly lost the feeling in his lips. He tightened his legs, locking his ankles so that when the Snitch turned and went into a dive straight down he didn't lose contact with his broom. He sensed the Portree Seeker just behind him, could hear him gasping in harsh, staccato breaths. No question, he was tired and doing everything he could to keep up. The ground was coming up at them fast, and the damned Snitch wasn't pulling out of its dive. Harry concentrated on the Snitch, trying to ignore the green grass that was getting closer and closer.
Draco took the half step separating them until he was close enough he could feel the heat from Harry's body. He took Harry's other upper arm in his free hand and gently held both. The strength in those arms sent a thrill down his spine, they always had. "Is that all that's bothering you?" he asked gently. "Truly? That Lily might somehow derail her career with this baby?"
Once they were on his nose, and he could see himself clearly, Harry was still, staring. As it turned out, Darian was in fact a miracle worker with a pair of stylist's shears and a straight-edge razor. Harry's mop had gone from too long and too unruly, one cowlick on top of another to something suitable for the pages of a magazine. He didn't know the man looking back at him. He was sleek and stylish, handsome in a way Harry had never thought of himself. He blinked.
After a slight pause, Draco shook his head. "Mother removed most of her things when she moved to France. And father's things… I'd like to light them on fire, but I'll refrain in order to save time."
It morphed to a surprised smirk when he saw that it was
"I think you're right," Harry agreed, turning toward Draco before going to his knees, then lifting one leg to straddle Draco's lap. Draco arched a brow.
Astoria's voice hitched. "Don't be upset. It went so quickly. This time we really didn't have time to call. She's so small, but she's absolutely perfect."
"Oh, I don't think so," Pansy grinned. "I simply
"I believe it's suffering from its encounter with a wooden pool cue." Darian opened his refrigerator and took out a parcel wrapped in white butcher paper.
"Don't tell me," Harry said with a sigh. "You're needed back at the hospital."
Darian pressed the button on the front of the machine and leaned back against the counter, his arms crossed.
"Then, when we arrived at 'Another Sinn', the music was obnoxiously loud, but there were people willing to buy you drinks. It was an 80's-themed night: lots of disco and half naked men…"
She turned in the middle of the room, her wand held down at her side. "I have no idea. Maybe I should call your clients first?"
Draco had actually owned some lovely Victorian, cherrywood pieces when they'd moved in together, but it had become obvious within the first few weeks that they wouldn't survive Harry's feet being on them several nights a week. He'd put them into storage, and they'd purchased the dark, heavy thing that sat there now. Even Harry couldn't destroy it with his heavy Auror boots all over it.
The man delivered a pat to his shoulder and left the room, no doubt off to perform his miracles on someone else. Harry turned to Darian, who waited in the corner of the room in his usual chair.
Scowling, she slapped the magazine onto the desk. "Do not for a moment think that this conversation is over, Draco Malfoy." She stared defiantly at him.
"Of course, sweetie. Where else would we be?"
"I, uh..." Harry cut himself off, feeling very uncomfortable. "Yeah, I'm bad at it."
"Woman, don't you…"
She crossed her arms defiantly. "Magic punishes those who misuse it."
He was startled by a voice calling for him from downstairs, and recognised it was Emilio. He took a deep breath, supposing it was time for him to find out how long he had to find a new place. The family told him to focus on his end of term work and not to worry about the house. Emilio had assured him they would talk about it later. He couldn't help but hope he'd meant
"Thank you," Draco said, offering a small smile. "I'd really like not to have to replace my windows along with everything else." Harry rolled his eyes, but he seemed calmer. Pansy caught his eye, and hers were very wide.
Draco took a bite of his fish. "Are you quite finished?"
Harry sighed internally. "What's your name?"
Harry paused, scraping at the table with his nail. "Could have used a chat with my best mate before I left this morning."
were in fact the same person; and that they both didn't want to talk to him anymore.
There was a short pause. "I figured that was your
Potter nodded. "I did. I talked about you a lot in those sessions actually. About how I wanted to find you, and when I did..." He fidgeted idly with a sugar sachet. "I'd really like for us not to automatically snark at each other. He told me, the only real way is to make a concentrated effort to alter the behaviour. Which I guess means, we have to be nice to each other until it takes."
"But quitting your job…"
"Harry, you're unhappy at work. It's ridiculously obvious. You're late nearly every day, you're terse with people. For the love of Merlin, even the old witch in the cafeteria asked me the other day what had your wand in a knot."
Pansy gave Draco a shove from behind. "Liar," she hissed in his ear.
Draco knew it was time to stop Pansy's rant before she built up steam. "Pansy, for the love of Merlin! Let Hermione come in.
"He's okay, then," Oliver said.
Draco waited until he'd left and then walked over to look at the tray. It was a bowl of grey glop, pretending to be porridge, and a cup with about three tablespoons of tea in it. He took a deep breath and picked up the cup. He'd raised it to his lips when Beecham's voice sounded in his head:
"I find," Draco said slowly, "that I'm having some difficulty understanding precisely what you're getting at. Perhaps you should just… spell it out for me."
Movement at the door to the dining room caught his eye, and Harry looked up to find Draco standing in the doorway, eyes watchful, James hovering anxiously just beyond his shoulder.
After they donned warm coats, Charlie cast a modified Disillusionment Charm over them both, restored the brooms to their normal size and they took off. Flying in the air, Harry felt freer than he had in a very long time. The wind whipped at his hair as they streamed across the sky. Even though they were quite high, Harry could see as the ground below changed from green sumptuous land to the snow-capped peaks of mountains.
Hermione would never let him forget it if he lost his mind enough to act on the impulse. She'd been telling Harry he had a thing for Malfoy since sixth year and he'd been denying it all that time. Clearly, the answer was to keep baiting the blond prat. Or to stand out longer in the freezing wind; no erection could survive it. He was beginning to wonder if his fingers would.
The words had come out in such a rush, Harry had to take a minute to comprehend them. He was just processing his thoughts when Draco spoke again.
Emilio Sorrentino pulled on Draco's hand, hauling him into a fierce hug. When he released him, Draco had to wipe his eyes again. "It's all of our loss, yes? And I've told you over and over these past three years to call me, Emilio, Draco. You have been as good as family to our dear Sophia. I hope you know how very much she loved you."
, like it was moving through drying cement and each day its passage got slower, and slower, the cement dryer. Each day was the equivalent of five days, each hour nine hours. He even took to marking each day off on a calendar—something he hadn't done in a decade.
"You know you're an infuriating git, right?" Harry replied. "Fine, I wanted to see you. Is that what you wanted to hear?"
," Pansy said salaciously. "I'd pay to watch you two go at it."
"Are you friends with her too, then?" Pansy asked, carefully keeping her eyes averted to what she was doing. Draco stared at her narrow shoulders for a moment.
"And if all else fails, there's always takeaway."
"What are we doing, Draco?"
He looked into Pansy's eyes. "My charming mother-in-law took her to a Healer at St Mungo's."
, Harry practically groaned in relief. Easing off the clutch, he put his foot on the gas.
oo00oo
"Mother tells me you've been going to Uni. How very ambitious of you."
Harry nodded. "If you'll have me."
Something about the whole situation felt off. He'd really thought they had some sort of connection, an easy camaraderie. It had certainly felt that way when they'd chatted before.
"I see the repertoire of spells you learned didn't include anything for the rat's nest on your head."
"What's happened?" Pansy said instantly. "Has that cunt Astoria done something else? I will cheerfully kill her, I swear to God, Draco."
"You knew," he said. Harry nodded.
"Possibly," he grumbled. Suddenly as if a light bulb went on above his head, Draco sat up and moved to pat the table. Instead he ended up slamming his hand down onto it, shaking the line of empty glasses in front of him so they rang like bells. “Sandringham! That’s the little shit’s name.”
Soon Charlie was banking to the right and flying towards the ground. From the air, Harry got a quick glimpse of the reserve. He managed to see it was very large and contained a number of penned off areas. As they landed, Harry noticed the temperature was warmer than he'd expected.
Here he was, another Friday night with just his right hand for company. Maybe Hermione had a point, after all.
"Fairly normal," Oliver repeated dumbly.
"Particularly not to a woman."
"Let's talk about that later, shall we?" Darian winked at him.
"Sure, we can go with that if you want." She rested part of her bum on the edge of Draco's desk and smirked. "So precisely how long have you and Potter been texting and exactly why are you pretending that you don't know each other?" She winked. "Some kind of kinky thing that goes along with the '69' at the end of his name?"
"Actually, speaking of your type," Pansy smirked, and Philippe rolled his eyes.
"I thought we'd go to Bigăr Waterfall. We have to travel to get there. We could fly, but it's over the mountains and they're not very forgiving if we run into any bad weather. The easiest is to Portkey." He held up an old coin for Harry to see. "It's part of a national park, but I know where to go so we can picnic."
Harry blinked. The report he'd been reading was as dry as dust and just about as interesting, his lunch time caffeine fix having long since faded.  "Christ, Ron. Put just a little more inuendo in that, would you? I don't think they caught on over in Improper Use." He pushed his glasses up to his forehead and rubbed his eyes. "He's over in the Magical Law department meeting with Hermione." She found some precedent or something she thinks will help us in the Ruster case."
I can be, Mr Malfoy."
"No, I couldn't have," Darian countered. "You were determined to sleep naked. And cuddle. And for future reference, don't poke people with that thing if you've no intention of using it." He gestured vaguely towards Harry's lap.
"You're fine, as long as you don't give him one of your looks."
Harry shrugged, turning his face away. "Nothing, it's fine."
"Merlin's saggy balls, Draco," Pansy said brushing soot off her trousers. "I've been trying to get you to answer me for nearly ten minutes. Are you so busy admiring…" Her words stopped the moment she saw Draco in a jumble of robes on the floor. She rushed across the room, dropping to her knees at his side. "Oh god, oh fuck! What happened? Is it Harry? Has he been hurt?" She took him by the shoulders and gave him a shake. "Talk to me, dammit!"
Draco entered his spacious office, dropping the folder onto his large desk and taking off the robes. He hung them on the coat rack in the corner, fetched his heavy winter overcoat and was still buttoning it when he tossed some Floo powder onto the flames in his office hearth and said, "The Leaky Cauldron."
"But..." Draco lifted his head and speared his hands through his hair. "I want..."
Draco pulled her close, completely unable to deny that the feelings his daughter had were wrong. Unlike her mother, Draco didn't love his daughter any less for an apparent lack of magic. If she was a Squib, they would make things work out. It certainly took the stress of moving back into the wizarding world away. Magic or not, he'd intended to remain in Notting Hill, in this lovely home.
personal than intentionally hitting a Bludger at an unsuspecting player's back. It's a prick move, and you know it."

"Below us are the Bistrița Mountains, part of the southern Carpathian mountains," Charlie called out. "We're headed to that green area in the centre of all that white."
Harry started to speak, but Draco shook his head. "You asked, now let me tell my story…my way."
A few minutes into the tour, Harry had to admit he was impressed. The changing rooms were large with plenty of space between the lockers. Not like Hogwarts where you practically changed on top of each other. And the shower room was almost nicer than the one in his flat. There was the communal bank of showers, but they also provided what looked like a dozen or so individual stalls. Harry couldn't help but wonder if the top players were given the individual stalls and the rest of the team was relegated to the communal room.
"Uhm, yeah, I guess I do."
They stared at each other, then Harry turned and went to the wall, pushing on a hidden door that led to a small room he knew was there. It popped open, and he gestured expansively, urging the women through before him. When they were all inside, Draco closed the door, sparing a lingering look for Harry as he did so. The crossed arms and the stormy expression didn't bode well for Draco's plan, but there wasn't time to argue about it. He felt the shiver of magic under his palm, and knew Granger had spelled the door so they could see through it. She was an amazing witch; from this side the door looked as it always had.
"Charlie tells us you spent quite a bit of time with the young Malfoy boy," Molly said. "Charlie's been singing his praises for sometime now. I think it's wonderful he found something to do with his life. We hear he's a remarkable Healer."
"Absolutely not," Draco said firmly. "She's beautiful, and I couldn't be happier. I've given it some thought, and if you are in agreement, I'd like to name her Camélia."
text the number you gave me," Harry said exasperatedly. "And you replied. Or at least whoever I texted replied. And I'm meeting him tomorrow for coffee!"
"Am I going to have to drag the story out of you word by word, because you know I'm just stubborn enough to do it." She glared at Harry, with an arched brow.
Draco's morning dragged through a number of meetings that seemed pointless and couldn't hold his attention. During a break he glanced up at the clock and saw that according to the schedule Draco had plugged into his mobile, Harry should be between classes. He taught the most advanced level of DADA at the Auror Academy, and had a practical during the mornings on Mondays, but it ended at ten o'clock. On a whim, Draco sent off a text, mostly composed with his thumbs.
"I do," she said, smiling. "I still think you should talk to your mother."
"Maybe." Harry frowned at him. "You're making me nervous! I'm not at my best when I'm nervous."
Ron shook his head. "George isn't working on anything like that. I've been in the shop often enough lately to know exactly what's in production and what's in testing. Harry, that is a legit letter from the Arrows."
?" he said with far more inflection than was necessary on the last word.
Harry had immediately suspended Holden and Beecham, without pay, for two weeks and was still certain that whether or not Draco brought charges against the Ministry – which he absolutely should – they would be out of jobs. Not that he cared. At the moment all he could think about was Draco and how horrible he'd looked.
"I got the impression she and that photographer had been looking for you all over the place. Someone—and don't ask me who because I don't know—has apparently been tattling to the wizarding press about your off-field exploits."
Pansy mouthed, "be nice," at him, and he held his tongue and didn't say anything else.
"That's not suspicious," she said sharply.
"Are you fucking nuts?" Bishop hissed between his teeth. "He's Harry Potter! What is wrong with you?"
"Oh, relax, Clute. Chances are he's in the market for a bit of furniture, and having heard all about those flats the Arrow's provide, I'm betting on a new mattress."
"Certainly, Mr…" Harry narrowed his eyes playfully, and Clute stopped. "Harry, I would be delighted to sell you a mattress."
He moved to sit on the edge of the skinny, sagging mattress that covered the metal cot. Draco didn't even want to think about the vile things that had occurred on that mattress and that paper-thin excuse for a sheet wasn't much better. He rested his elbows on his knees and lowered his head to his hands. Nothing made any sense. He was a nobody anymore, really. He worked, paid his bills on time and did his best to live a better life. He knew he'd been given a second chance and had no intention of doing anything to ruin that chance.
Draco led Scott into his home office, urging him to sit in a chair. He considered getting the man a shot of bourbon, but knew Harry would smell it and want to know what was going on.
He blinked, frowning. "I… no. I don't think I do, actually."
As if to prove her wrong, the owl gave Hermione a shake of its head and pulled the chicken from Harry's fingers and gobbled it down in two bites. Then it stared at Hermione before flying back out the open window.
"I am." Darian put his comb in the disinfecting jar, his eyes moving over Harry as he pushed the lid closed. "Well, well, look at you, Mr Potter. You do own something besides blue jeans and ratty trainers."
He took three steps then turned back and walked resolutely into the room. Moving quickly, he crossed to his mother's dresser and opened and closed several drawers. Finally in the bottom drawer, tucked into the corner was a small sachet that Narcissa had imported every year from the lavender fields in Provence. Draco pulled it out and slipped it into his pocket.
"Doesn't hurt."
"Are you sure? You have been known to perform some pretty wild magic, after all," Draco had teased him in retaliation.
"Draco?" Astoria sounded exhausted, but elated.
Harry didn't think he'd ever felt the truth of the phrase, 'the agony of waiting' before like he did that early morning. He rubbed his hand over his jaw, felt the fact he needed a shave, felt the faint tremor in his hand. It was fatigue, he knew it. They all looked completely fagged out, eyes too wide and staring, standing in clumps or pacing.
They usually shared a glass of one of the amazing wines bottled in Tuscany, not far from where she'd spent her childhood, and as far as Draco could tell the only wine cellar that rivalled his fathers was the one beneath Sophia's kitchen. With all the good food and even better wine, he felt he was expanding his horizons and his waistline as he sat at her table.
Harry jerked slightly and looked up, and his racing heart lurched into his throat.
Draco looked up from the wand pointing at him. "Pans, it's me," he said with a quiet waver in his voice, "Draco."
oo00oo
"I told you nothing was wrong," Draco said, wearily after Harry had read them all. "Now do you believe me?" He looked down at Harry, who finally looked up at him sheepishly.
at all, and he’s a nice enough little man when you get past the overbite.”
Harry pulled back, looking up into his eyes. "So, come," he said, thumb swiping over the straining cock. "Come for me."
Pansy stepped to the closet and pulled out a jar labelled
"No, you don't understand. You may be dating him, but it isn't the same." Draco was adamant. "You do some Muggle things because of Philippe, but at the end of the day, you still can Apparate anywhere you choose, use a spell to wash your dishes—scratch that, you'd have the elves do them. But you are allowed to pick and choose what you do the Muggle way and what you choose to use magic for. Astoria may find it all perfectly novel and charming in the beginning.
Any thought that Potter might not notice the scarf went up in smoke as Camélia held it out to Draco and shook it.
there." Draco stood, then leaned over to buss Pansy on the cheek. "Have I told you recently how much I adore you?"
Harry spluttered and wine dribbled from his gaping mouth. He blinked several times. "You're mad," he finally managed. "Completely gone 'round the twist. Crazy is what you are."
Hermione had the grace to look embarrassed. "I didn't mean it like that. You have an important name, Harry. Don't you want to do something meaningful with it?"
At that moment, the indicator board lit with "
"You… you…" Her lips began to tremble. "Just when I think I know how you're going to react, you go and say something like that. You are so…Draco!" She sighed and shook her head. "Which is probably why I love you so." She leaned back in her chair and crossed one perfectly toned leg over the other.
Harry gave her a final squeeze and kissed the top of her head, as he'd done a thousand times before. Draco watched the exchange with a knot in his stomach. Every time he thought he was fine knowing their daughter loved him, but worshipped her
"Well, it was actually for a private collection of the Goblin Cripnock's work, including his last piece. There were only five cast at the time of his death, and I've tried for years to get my hands on one." He paused, rubbing his thumb over Harry's knuckles. "There was a copy of 'Blue Mother Dragon with White Baby' listed in the catalogue, you know, the one you used for a coaster."
Draco gave him a stern look. "If 'making them an offer they couldn't refuse' means the kind of Galleons I think it did, you should be glad my priorities are right where they are, smart arse. Because I would hate for one of us to kick it off the table when we got... enthusiastic."
Draco woke suddenly from a dream that included Voldemort and his crazy aunt Bellatrix. He rolled to his back and covered his eyes with an arm, sighing deeply. The room was nearly dark, which meant he'd slept much of the day away. He hadn't dreamt about either of those lunatics in years and wasn't best pleased to have them making an appearance in his head. All that dream had needed was his father, and it would have been a perfect trifecta of terror. He scrubbed his hands over his face and sat up. If having those two in his head wasn't bad enough, he also had a dream with Potter in it. Not that Potter dreams were completely unusual, but in this one Draco was fighting with Pansy in the Great Hall as she tried to hand Harry over to Voldemort.
Harry nodded his understanding. "You're right, I know."
"Oh, really," Draco said, trying to walk the fine line between delight at really good gossip, and the realization that the man had been someone Harry looked up to. "Do tell."
"I know." One corner of Ted's lips quirked up, a dimple creasing his cheek. His mother's dimples. Harry sighed softly. He should have known he'd never be immune to those dimples.
"I think she's torn. Part of her is quite happy; it was the point of this marriage, after all. But I think part of her is refusing to accept that she's old enough to have a grandchild."
"Oh for the love of…" Hermione huffed out in frustration. "Speak."
After many tears and a smack on his shoulder for not trusting her with the story of the scarf, Pansy wiped at her face, leaning back.
"And moving back to London?" Arthur said. "That's alright? I know your friend is in Appleby." He nodded toward Darian, who was watching them with a slight smile on his face. "I know you'll miss him."
"Is that your way of saying you want to fuck?" Harry asked with a mischievous grin.
"Then hire a nanny," she said dismissively. "A lot of women don't raise their own children. You know that."
Ron rubbed the back of his neck. "Made it there about an hour and a half into the game." He shrugged, "Long story that's not important now."
"Actually, you said you'd go after Hermione for distracting me if I didn't pull my head out." He took a sip of his coffee and moaned softly. "What is it about this stuff that makes my head immediately stop pounding?"
"Hey, you git. One wannabe-ferret in a life-time is enough, alright?"
Harry turned away and Oliver fell into step beside him. They'd taken just a few steps when Ollie caught Harry's arm, stopping him. Oliver turned back and called out to the other team as they began to walk back to their own side of the pitch, "Oh, and, Ellison," he called. The surly Beater turned back.
He grabbed it just feet from the visitor's stands, yanking the broom up and back right before he would have slammed into the field's barrier fences.
"Miranda Lowry Bergstrom," she said briskly, "Proprietor of the Iron Lantern, finest pub in Appleby."
"Sorry," Harry replied, running a hand through his hair.
"Nah," Darian said, opening the can with a pop and a fizz. "Your cock's too small."
"Yes, yes, understood." Narcissa said firmly. "Thankfully, you were never careless with money. And with owning that lovely house, you should all be fine." She sounded so sure. He wished he could feel the same. "I'll confess I'm glad that when your sentence has concluded, you'll have the means to do what you want."
"She's fine." Draco rubbed the spot she'd smacked on the back of his head. "I, on the other hand, will no doubt have bruises tomorrow." It was getting easier to talk as he did it, and he rested his head on the back of the sofa. "I apparently overreacted to something -- "
"The Godfather," Darian murmured.
"Nice to meet you, young man." It was the second time Draco had looked gobsmacked in one day, and Harry knew he'd never tire of the expression on his face.
"Why you fuck-faced twit!" Beecham roared. "I'm not taking that shit from a fucking Death Eater!" Holden grabbed his arm and Beecham easily shook himself free.
"Draco?"
Hermione slapped Harry's hand. "Harry! That chicken is far too spicy for that poor thing."
"On the telephone," Draco clarified. She straightened and inhaled, clearly insulted.
More than one moment, actually. How could he have forgot, for even a moment, Potter's sweaty hand yanking him onto the back of a broom as he flew him from the heart of hell? He fell asleep remembering the hard lines of Potter's back, the tensile strength of his slender torso as he pressed his face into Potter's black curls and inhaled the scent o him; the scent clinging, even after all this time, to the scarf in his hands.
Draco stood slowly and moved forward. The Auror opened the cell door and grabbed his arm in a tight grip and twisted. Draco grimaced, unable to help himself. "Now walk because I won't tell you again." Draco wanted to twist his arm out of the bastard's grip, spit in his face and run. But he knew better than to try anything so foolish. Best, he decided, to go along and try to figure out what the fuck they thought he'd done.
She looked startled but kept up. "Walk? But…"
"How can you say that?" Harry asked, frowning in distress.
"I'm gonna go," Harry said. "But I will be anxiously awaiting your call."
"Coming," Harry hissed, his hand curling around Draco's forearm.
Harry leaned back far enough to stare into the wide grey eyes, finally seeing what he’d longer for. With a soft, needy sound, he slipped his hand into the fine blond strands and fit their lips together. As he
She sighed. "My curiosity will be the death of me." One tweezed brow arched. "And 'Harry', is it?"
A long groan escaped Harry's mouth. "Fuck, I didn't do that while Skeeter was there, did I?"
Heaving the Quidditch breeches over the rack, Draco fished his phone out of his pocket and opened his texts and cringed.
"Merlin's fucking hairy taint," Malfoy finally erupted, his face red. Harry was surprised he'd lasted as long as he had and bit back a laugh. Mrs Erminmeister turned to him and gave him a glare down her nose that could have outdone Snape.
"Braydon," Harry supplied, groaning aloud. Very cute, very blond, very
was slightly ajar. Rationalising, Harry took it as a sign he was supposed to follow Draco. He slid the door open a bit more and slid through the opening, pulling the door closed behind him. It took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the dim lighting inside, then he crept forward, listening for voices, preparing to slip between the black velvet curtains that hung along the side of the stage if he needed to.
The man turned, and Draco had to reach out and grab the door frame to remain upright. Green eyes widened, thick black lashes like the points of stars around them. A curl fell down nearly hiding the lightning bolt scar, and the dark, rectangular frames of his glasses seemed to mirror the adult lines of Potter's face.
He didn’t answer, just stared over Harry’s shoulder. Harry glanced back only to find Twilford Mordach standing right there, staring at Harry and his date. Ah. The dreaded ex. Well, he’d been warned about this.
"Yeah, and you almost became part of the stands." Now that he was looking, Harry saw that Darian was unnaturally pale. Harry grabbed his jacket near the shoulders, giving Darian a light shake.
"I'm sorry," he said, words muffled by his hands. And like she'd done so many times during their last year at Hogwarts, Pansy pulled Draco into her arms and held him while he broke down.
"Thank you for riding the Knight Bus," Harry called out after his passenger. Under his breath he muttered,
Draco felt his face heat and vowed he wouldn't look at Potter again until he was sure he wouldn't spontaneously combust. He didn't need to look in order to know the scarves matched.
Even Harry saw the desolation that moved briefly through his reflection in the mirror. He blinked it away and straightened. "How much longer do you plan to play with that?"
Darian's widened eyes were the only warning Harry had. A disabling, screaming pain roared up his spine to his head. His eyes closed, and then he knew nothing more.
Harry was as nervous as a Kneazle in a room filled with rocking chairs, but he hoped he sounded confident when he replied, "Perfect."
Pansy and Philippe entered the house, looking, to Draco's mind, utterly perplexed. "Why wouldn't we knock?" Philippe said with a shrug. "It is polite, no?"
with his life."
Draco grabbed his hands and threaded their fingers together. "You won't," Draco said kindly. "At least not completely; you wouldn't be you if you did. But you must try to be the voice of calm when you talk to Lily. She needs you to be that steady rock for her now, Harry. If we want her delivery to go as smoothly as possible, she has to calm down and relax."
Harry smirked. "I may have actually deserved it."
"Shite." Harry came up behind him and dropped a kiss on the back of his neck, his hands settling gently on Draco's shoulders. "A totally pointless stakeout in a barn in Cotswold. I smell like livestock."
oo00oo
Ever so slowly, Malfoy's lips curled in a wicked grin. "You might want to reconsider the wording of that sentence."
"Come on, Hermione," Harry said bluffly. "Help me at the bar. Same again for the rest of you?" he asked, noting the near-to-empty glasses on the table.
. "You about ready?"
His mouth dropped open and Draco's eyes grew wide. "You're dating someone! How can you proposition men? Does this Philippe have no pride?"
"Draco?" Harry called out from their darkened kitchen. The light downstairs flipped on, and he could almost predict what Harry was doing without even seeing it. First he'd removed his robes; yes, there was the sound of the chair legs on the flag stones as he tossed his red jacket over it. He heard him open the refrigerator, heard the cap from his beer as he tossed it in the bin. "Draco, where are you?"
The other players, from both sides, gathered, wondering if a fist fight was about to break out in the middle of the pitch. Oliver Wood walked over and stood at Harry's shoulder.
"Yes, you do, you dolt." Draco's expression was defiant, but his tone soft.
Pansy came back in a few minutes later with a platter filled with crackers, fruits, nuts, cheeses and some sort of sausage. She smiled when Draco's stomach growled, even though he'd eaten a few hours before.
"That's quite true, but here you are. You're managing so well, Draco. With something most wizards would find impossible. You've gone to school, begun a profession. You're handling the Muggle transportation system, shopping, cooking,
he could do back at home, thank you very much.
With a mischievous grin, Draco continued. "We were having our tea while our mothers chatted. The Parkinson's elf, Lizzy, makes amazing scones. We had blueberry ones that day and Pansy wasn't eating hers."
He grimaced. "I don't think even I'm that cynical. Marrying a woman while checking out her brother."
Draco continued to call Astoria every evening to discuss his day and see how she was coping. He made sure to end each conversation with
"So Robards has a gambling problem?" Draco asked.
She leaned her head on his shoulder, then sighed. "I'm glad you asked me to help you with the drinks. There's something I need to talk to you about."
"Caffeine. You're an addict. And whatever I said," Darian reached out and curled his hand around Harry's bicep, "I'm glad it had that effect."
Several air-freshening charms later, Draco was still unable to abate the stench clouding the shop. Worse still, several sets were now missing Gobstones which he couldn't turn up—even with his best summoning charms.
"You don't have to do that," Harry said, already so humiliated he wanted to climb into bed, pull the blankets over his head and not get out for about a month.
. Absolutely, one hundred percent right where she ought to be for a woman in her thirty-eighth week of pregnancy. She's ungainly, and she can't see her feet, and she's retaining water, and her hormones are making her behave like a mad person. All of this, you are intimately acquainted with." Harry rolled his eyes but smiled slightly. "All she wants is for little whoever they are to be born." Lily and Scott had decided to be surprised by the baby's sex, or they were doing a very good job of keeping it to themselves. Since Draco doubted his daughter could keep anything to herself at the moment, he was certain they didn't know who they were about to welcome into their home. "It is your job, deerheart, to keep her calm, not go ‘round the twist with her."
♥ ♥ ♥
"Wandless magic," Draco breathed, changing the angle of his head and nipping at Harry's chin. "Very hot."
"Oh, bite me," Harry shot back, walking down the hall to his room. He called out, "I should have stayed. Got the third-degree anyway."
Draco tugged his pillow over his head, loud pounding disturbing his sleep. Slowly, he tried to pull himself out of the ridiculous dream he was having, something about Pansy and a litter of baby Kneazles that all looked like Granger's hideous specimen. Disgruntled, he rolled over and tried to find his wand on the bedside table.
"I will not." Draco gave her a stern look.
"Berlinger's palsy." Harry shook his head, picking up his cup and nearly whimpering as the heat of the coffee began to thaw his fingers. "Never heard of it."
When the war was over and the trials finished, Harry Potter knew one thing for certain: he no longer had any desire to be an Auror. He'd spent seven years chasing after and avoiding being killed by an insane megalomaniac and his followers, and enough was enough.
"Any idea when he might be home? Unlike those of us pissing our lives away pretending to be a professional Quidditch player?"
Harry had to laugh. "Well I'd like to at least be the first one to see what it says, thanks." He stepped into the kitchen and pulled the letter from the inside pocket of his jacket, pausing to look at the front before he opened it. He took several deep breaths to calm himself.
Draco threw his hands up. "Well, of course it did. For Merlin's sake, was there anything at Hogwarts that
Harry's eyes lit up first, but he did give Draco a small smile.
"You'll think it's dumb."
"That sounds like a story I'd like to hear." Darian's expression was bright and welcoming, and his assessing looks were flattering. It had been a long time since someone as attractive as Darian had openly shown such an interest in him. "If you'd like to share it." He withdrew his hand, and Harry immediately missed its warmth.
Harry turned and stared. "What have you charged him with?"
Hermione began to pick at the edge of her jumper and a tell-tale blush rose on her cheeks.
Draco nodded without calling her out on her physical reaction. After all, he wasn't concerned; he knew Harry was about as fond of fanny as he was.
She spread her hands as if to say, 'see?' "But that aside, his sentence didn't prevent him from seeing other wizards or witches, only from setting foot in wizarding areas." She took another sip of her wine. "Really, Harry, you need to stop worrying about him and start living your life."
Harry looked down at him, his eyes livid. "What do I do with this, Draco?"
sitting on the kitchen floor, cradling your bowl of cereal and crying as if you'd been told some horrible news."
The Auror who delivered his meal didn't speak, just shoved the tray through the slot. Draco glanced as it bounced against the table top, food sloshing in the water as it spilled across the tray.
“Oh, Gods,” she muttered. “The two of you deserve each other.” She glared at him. “Draco, Harry is only with Deylon Sandringham out on that dance floor because you have made yourself unavailable.”
Harry turned so he was walking backwards. "I imagine there are a number of discussions we still need to have, Draco." He gave Draco a jaunty wave, turned around and jogged down the road to Charlie's cabin.
"So you say. I still don't know where the money came from to set you up in the first place, but I have an excellent imagination. It was oh so very easy to convince Gawain Robards that you'd been selling that pretty little arse of yours for long enough to pay for school, the flat, everything. And you do know that prostitution is illegal in our world." His beady eyes turned cold. "As part of your arrest, your account at Gringotts was audited." His grin reminded Draco of a snake, and he shuddered. "You still don't have any money in your account, Draco, and you haven't since the Ministry took all of Daddy's money. So how, exactly, are you paying for everything? You can see how it looks."
He sat motionless on the couch as the day faded. The sun set and the inside of the townhouse darkened, and he still didn't move. He didn't have the will. He was emotionally exhausted. He wasn't going to pretend he wasn't disappointed, but Pansy had made him think. And frankly, he wasn't sure he appreciated it. He wanted to feel sorry for himself, damnit. He sighed deeply.
Deon shook his head and chuckled softly. "And to think Charlie's always said such nice things about you." He lifted a hand and with a grin, walked down the hall and into his room.
The second the words were out of his mouth, he knew he should have listened to Severus' voice. The larger Auror charged across the room and backhanded Draco so fast he didn't have a chance to duck or pivot and he took the full blow to his cheek. His head snapped back and pain shot up the side of his face.
Harry lifted his eyes to her, then turned to look at Draco, waiting.
"Coming for me?" Draco asked, standing and moving quickly to the bars. He grabbed them with his hands. "Why am I here? What exactly is it I'm being accused of?"
"You ever intentionally injure another of my players, and I will beat the ever-loving shite out of you myself." He pointedly looked at the other team's captain. "We clear?"
"Looking a little rough this morning, Malfoy. What's the matter? Wrong soap in the shower? Because it's pretty obvious you didn't take one again today; I can smell your stench across the room."
Draco watched as the jubilant Auror team lead him to the ground, cheering and shouting, pulling him off of his broom to pat him on the back and shake his hand. They lined up to exchange handshakes with the good-natured team in black, then as everyone else headed for the side lines, the bloody fool stood at the centre of the pitch letting the rain drench him.  All the anger, all the frustration he had felt about Harry sneaking off to play Seeker washed away in the rain, now that Draco knew Harry was safe. Then what he was seeing, standing there in the monsoon like rain, caught up with him.
He picked up the picture and carried it with him to the downstairs parlour. He feared with everything that had occurred today, he'd not be able to sleep. He knew he'd never again sleep in his old room filled with memories and ghosts of the past. He recalled lying stiff in the dark, dreading the sound of footsteps outside his chamber's doors. He'd spent a year in abject terror, just waiting to be called and forced to do unspeakable things. He couldn't do it; there was nothing in that room that was worth the memories attached.
"That cookie will rot your teeth," Pansy muttered, turning a page in her newspaper. That was the moment Draco realised she was holding the
"That's brill! I can't wait to see them." Harry's voice dropped. "Do you think Draco will be unhappy I came back?"
He felt the tears on his arm before he realised he was crying.
"I thought it would be." He looked at Harry with an expression that reminded him forcefully of Arthur Weasley; almost fatherly. "I know young men can be impulsive, but you should always at least sit on a sofa before you commit yourself to the purchase."
"Duly noted," Deon said with a salute and a grin. "Well, wonder-boy, it's been a pleasure. Don't be a stranger."
Draco shrugged. "Maybe today I am. Are you complaining?"
"Nanny Ava called you my zeba."
"Yes," Draco said. "It was quick and quiet, and is safely behind me. Alright, my turn."
"Never better," Harry replied. Fortunately, they'd taken the win against the Wasps with a good margin, or he had a feeling the conversation might have been a bit more in depth. Harry shook himself from his memories, the belated thought that this was the kind of distractedness Oliver was wary of.
"Not knowing you," Harry clarified. "What if I'd like to learn more about you?"
Draco had never moved so fast in his life, nor been so glad he'd perfected that take down move.
As Harry watched the cinders of the morning's Prophet fade to grey in the hearth, he knew Darian was right. He grabbed his jacket and scarf off the coat rack, and picked up the yellow envelope from the dining table. It was time to talk to his solicitor and put this right.
"Darling, just go get it, then tell him it's what he's giving you for your birthday."
— He hit send, knowing whatever it took, Pansy would meet him tomorrow. He crawled on top of the duvet, fully clothed, and as the tears started again, he drifted into a fitful sleep.
Malfoy snorted, turning back to the window. "I venture to say you don't know very much about me at all, Potter."
“If you don’t shut it, I won’t tell you what I know and the two of you can continue circling around one another forever. I’m heartily sick of both of you. Are you going to listen?”
"I know it's none of my business, but may I ask what prompted this sudden shopping spree?"
Harry was a little surprised. Truthfully, he was pants at remembering his own mobile number—it had far too many digits and it wasn't as though he ever dialled it himself—but he had never intended to seem like he was trying to dodge making contact with
"I have to," Harry said. "I need to check on some property I own there. I'm considering remodelling it. Mainly because of what you said to me the weekend the Harpies were in town."
She went to Astoria and kissed her on the cheek. "I'll speak to you tomorrow, darling."
"Well, I would hope so," Mickey said, propping his hands on his hips. "You look like a different person. Not that you weren't hot before, but now, you're
"It's not that bad," he grumbled, and she arched a brow at him. He finally conceded the point with a shrug.
"I'm not thinking about… anything," Draco lied. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Harry sat, staring at her, slowly shaking his head back and forth. "I don't believe it. There must be a mistake. Robards? Why?"
"I don't believe that for a moment," Draco said. He shifted on the bed. "Does this mean I can transfer the Black vaults into my own accounts now? No more having to remember to sign as D. Black?"
"Worse than a camp bed in the Forest of Dean?"
The server nodded and laughed as she patted Ron on the shoulder. "Happens to the best of us. Let me know if you need anything else."
"No," he said faintly. "They didn't."
"Don't play stupid," the Auror shot back. "It won't help. You know what the hell you've done and the sooner you admit to it, the better it will go for you." He huffed. "Not like it'll do you any good, you Death Eater scum." He pulled the cell door shut with a clang, and Draco felt a horrid chill race over his skin. That sound – his throat worked. The Auror sneered and walked away.
Draco smiled at Harry. "Anyway, after I decided to become a Healer, I applied and was accepted at a school outside of Brussels. When I was finished, I worked in their clinic for a year, then was getting restless staying in one place so long. There's only so many hangnails one can heal before you question your career choice."
Charlie groaned. "Be a mate and tell her you didn't see me, will you?"
Draco finally looked up and frowned. "What's so interesting, and why do you look like the Kneazle that got the cream?"
Finally gathering enough nerves, he quickly sent some messages.
"What?" he asked in alarm.
The next time he woke, the sun was shining and Harry could hear birds chirping. Birds…chirping…  It all came back in a rush, moving the dragon…bird…fire…limb falling…unbelievable pain. He must have cried out because soon he saw the outline of someone coming towards him.
"Draco, you had to know someone was going to question your turn in fortunes. Everyone knows the Ministry took everything, and yet you suddenly came into money." He shrugged one shoulder. "I simply— shall we say— presented a hypothesis. A very convincing hypothesis."
"I do not pout," Pansy said, pouting.
"Anything else from in here, Draco?"
Draco turned his face so that his cheek was pressed to Harry’s, and Harry caught his breath.
Trying to figure out just what to do with his life was easier said than done. At first Harry's time was spent in physical therapy at the hospital. The Hospital was affectionately referred to as 'St Janet's' after Janet Douglas who was burned as a witch on the site in 1777. Harry had awakened one night to find a beautiful Elizabethan lady with flowing red hair smiling down at him. She touched his hair and then drifted away, and when Harry described her to his nurse in the morning, she told him he'd been 'blessed by St Janet', the patron saint of 'reckless but lucky wizards'.
"Also…"
Draco pushed him away. "Wrinkles," he scolded. "Idiot."
"Ah, there's the bridegroom," Walden Greengrass called as if he was announcing the races at Ascot. Astoria blushed.
Harry stood still, breathing steadily in an attempt to keep from strangling the idiot. He was about ready to show the little bastard exactly who he was, when Harry just stopped. He didn't have to prove anything to anyone. He knew what he'd done. The battles he'd won, the scars he'd earned. It was as if, as in a cartoon, a light bulb shown brightly above his head.
When Hermione opened her mouth to reply, Harry just held up a hand.
He'd known he couldn't play Quidditch forever, and honestly he hadn't wanted to. But then, he never imagined he'd grieve for his career once it was over, either.
"You're welcome. Mimsy will be here shortly with food, but in the mean-time I thought we could start with this." She held up a chilled bottle of Pol Roger.
Harry strolled through the Atrium and into the closest Floo. He stepped out into his living room, tossing his robes onto the back of the couch.  Walking into the kitchen, he set his wand on the counter and picked up a bottle of Firewhisky, then poured a generous amount into a glass and took a sip.
"I know," Harry replied. "You must."
Harry's mirth remained, but his laughter faded to a fond smile. He cupped Draco's cheek, his thumb tracing his pointed jaw. "You couldn't look like a soggy dishcloth if you tried."
"I went to John Lewis and had one of their consultants help me put things together. I really think you'll like it." He paused. "I wish I could somehow show you how it looks. It's a lovely room."
is a bit strong. Will you allow me to play
Harry bumped him in the shoulder. "Come on, you prat, I'll walk with you to the Leaky and we can use the Floo to get home. Neither of us need to be Apparating after this much beer."
Harry gave him a wry look. "Don't get used to it."
Hermione was one of the smartest people Harry knew, and the part about wanting to irritate Aunt Petunia was dead on. For the first time he wondered if his accidental magic could have worked that way, even when he was four. After thinking about it for a long time, he figured there was only one way to find out. And if Robustus's stylist tried to give him a swirling comb-over, he figured he could always just make it grow back out again.
He opened his eyes to find her still studying him, almost as if she'd never seen him before. After a waiting moment, she grinned and went up onto her toes, kissing him on the cheek.
The test he'd given earlier that day had been so easy, that the recruits finished it well before class ended. Harry had released them early, not caring if Kingsley approved. He was the teacher, damnit, he'd do what he wanted. He laid his head on his desk and sighed. He knew what he wanted and
The words were right there on the tip of his tongue but he succeeded in not saying them.
He looked around the beautiful home, with it's wonderful mix of old and new, and once again, wondered exactly what she had been thinking in leaving it to him. He'd objected, quite loudly and strenuously; he'd listed every single reason he could come up with for it to be an insane idea. Not the least of which was the fact he'd only known Sophia for three years. And, as he told himself silently, he didn't deserve such a generous gift.
Draco resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at her.
He picked the magazine up off the floor, opening it to the article he'd been reading. The words blurred on the page and he started thinking about Draco's face when he showed Harry the waterfall and told him the folk tale. How Draco's face had glowed with excitement at sharing it with Harry. 'Fuck this', he thought and dropped the magazine again. He was about to go to the infirmary, when the door opened. Charlie was back.
"My, my," she teased with a smile. "This one must matter, then."
♥ ♥ ♥
Draco had started to reach out but his hand froze in mid-air and his eyes jerked to Harry's. "Bagman? But– Why?"
, but it's been what, eighteen months now? It's time you shook that off, got out and had some fun. I mean, would it kill you to just talk to someone, or go on a date—"
He slowly unfolded the pages. He squinted down at the page, his heart shooting into his throat. He must have made a noise, because suddenly he heard Ron calling out, "What's wrong?"
"Alright?" Harry asked.
He nodded. "And I realised I could use the massage therapy along with potions I brewed specifically for people, and I actually could do something productive with my life."
Shaking his head, he slipped the phone back into his pocket and continued about his day, trying to put the text from his mind.
"I can't think of anything
Once in the air, Harry saw exactly why Ginny was already being scouted by the Harpies. Her form on a broom was perfect and she radiated confidence.
"We have a Mind Healer and psychologist on staff, you know. They're always available. Take this as my sincere recommendation—as your friend—that you see them voluntarily, and in the near future. Pull another suicidal move like tonight, and I'll bench you pending an official evaluation."
"Alright," Harry said, "so we each have parts that we've cheerfully used and abused." He kissed Draco again. "There's always this old favourite…" Harry gave him a saucy grin and ducked down beneath the covers, taking the tip of Draco's cock in his mouth. Draco made a soft sound of pleasure and ran his long fingers through Harry's hair.
Draco cleared his throat, looked as if he was going to speak and then closed his mouth. "Never mind," he said stiffly. "This was a stupid idea."
"Oh, just blame me," she said with a breezy laugh. "Tell him I insisted on coming with you. It won't even be a lie."
It was only the middle of the afternoon, but he'd opened a very nice bottle of 1985 Château Latour Bordeaux. It made him smile to think of how positively appalled his father would be to know Draco was drinking one of the best bottles from the cellar…alone…in the middle of the day. He held it up in a mock toast.
Harry wanted to crawl into bed and pull the covers over his head. Instead he shrugged and winced. "Sort of forgot Draco told me never to
Harry smiled, broad and genuine at Neville. "Thanks mate, I'll be sure to."
Harry shook his head. "Oh, not at all. You know I like it. Makes me feel wanted."
"I just didn't want…" he shuddered.
; even if he still wasn't sure exactly how he'd done it.
"No Astoria, that's fine. We can talk tomorrow. When you know what time you can leave, let me know and I'll be there. Philippe is going to use his father's car and drive over to help bring you both home. When I thought about it, I realised a taxi might not be the best idea."
Draco flipped through the paper and landed on page seventeen. His eyes feasted on a glorious five by seven, full-colour photo of Harry Potter stripped off to the waist, hair damp around his face, a towel wrapped around his waist as he spoke with a surrounding crowd of sports writers. Apparently, Potter had managed to bring Appleby the league championship for the first time in eighty years. He certainly looked more than capable. His shoulders were broad and his pecs firm, and Draco wanted to bite one of those thickly muscled biceps. Water trickled from the dark hair on his chest to follow the line down between his striated abdominal muscles. Draco stared at the photo and then decided he wanted to lick the small copper-coloured nipples so badly his mouth watered. He wondered if he ought to be seeing a Mind Healer about his oral fixation. Or perhaps about this hopeless infatuation and longing he still had for Potter.
Harry felt as confused as he must've looked. "But, why…"
"Well, have you told anyone?" Draco countered.
A blush filled her cheeks. "I didn't know you were still so close."
Draco looked up. "I don't know what you want me to tell you. I'm a massage therapist. I brew some oils and tonics for my clients to help them with muscle pain or sometimes to help them sleep." He threw his hands up in frustration. "I don't know what else you want me to tell you."
Ron snorted. "You told us he wasn't as much like Malfoy as he looked," Ron said, lowering his chin and looking at Harry from beneath his brows. "You lied."
"Have you given any thought to a name for her?" Astoria asked as Ava left the room.
Harry scratched at the day-old beard on his cheek. "I don't know."
"Didn't you want to keep it a secret?"
"We tried that a few years ago, if you recall," Pansy shot back, dark eyes gleaming dangerously, "dreadfully unsatisfying for us both." She flicked his forehead with her finger. "Now shut up and listen. I'd curse you with a Full Body-Bind, but I'm not in the mood to explain to the Aurors why I found it necessary."
"All right, Mr Malfoy," Pansy said briskly, looking over at him. "Before you fall asleep standing there, give me the keys to your office. It's time for Ms Parkinson…Mr Malfoy's able-bodied assistant to go smooth some ruffled client feathers and make certain you have a business to run." She winked at him, linking her arm through his. "Next week is soon enough for Transcendence to re-open its doors. I'll do what needs to be done and Floo home after."
Draco reached over and took Pansy's hand. "I do too, old thing. But life is different now." At her glare, he smiled. "Let me finish…things are different, but you're right I do need to take time for friends and dinners together. But for the love of all that's holy, can we not do it in Paris?"
"Draco Malfoy, you have been accused of several crimes. Testimony has been heard in your defence from Harry Potter, and this body has taken it into serious consideration in outlining the parameters of your punishment. Please stand for your sentencing."
"Oh you're just a laugh a minute. And I wasn't sure before, but yes, I'm going to meet
Harry walked over to Hermione and pulled her into him, his chin resting on the top of her head. "I know you mean well. Honestly, I do. Let's set it all aside for now and eat. But we will talk when we're finished eating."
Malfoy looked nonplussed for a moment, then he huffed, staring out the window. "Which means you crashed the awards ceremony because you couldn't stand not knowing what I was doing." The ring finger of his left hand moved in tight circles against his right elbow, and Harry watched it for a moment in fascination.
Harry shook the dark hand and looked at Charlie in surprise. "Pleased to meet you." He winked at Charlie. "Well this is interesting."
"In light of the testimony of Harry Potter, you will not be required to serve time in Azkaban. However, the conditions of your sentence are as follows: your wand which is currently being held by this court will be taken and the magical core will be removed." Draco felt a sick wave of nausea roil through his stomach. His wand; they were going to take the magical capability of his wand! He wanted to vomit. "At such time as you successfully complete the terms of your sentence, you may have it replaced. Secondly, for the next ten years, you are prohibited from performing any magic and are further prohibited from entering any magical areas – including but not limited to Hogsmeade Village, Diagon Alley or any magical building within the United Kingdom."
Draco took a moment to compose himself, staring out the window, memories swirling in his head. "The thing is, Pans," he said firmly, "I had to try to figure things out on my own. All my life someone told me what to do. Mostly my father, but Severus too. Mother was the only one who let me…no, made me think for myself."
"Tell us what you do all day," Beecham asked for the third time.
"Glad you like it."
"There he is." Darian leaned to his side then was back, placing glasses on Harry's nose. The room beyond Darian swam into focus. Ron was standing just behind Darian's shoulder, leaning forward.
Draco was shocked and didn't agree. "Deserved to have your career ended?" He shook his head. "I don't believe that."
and had just moved on with his life, never to be seen again, and without even giving him a chance to help him.
"Here we go," Charlie said, stopping in front of a small cabin. He held his hand on the plate on the door and it opened right up.
"Master Draco is always being very kind to Mimsy. Unlike some witches I know." Mimsy retorted.
Draco slipped his mobile back into his pocket and cleared the room with a simple, "This meeting has gone on long enough, ladies and gentlemen. We'll try again next week. Do see if you can't come up with more palatable arguments to increase your budgets for next quarter."
"Stuff it, Potter. Just get me to London before I'm late."
"Yes. Better. I can't even tell you," he answered. "Thank you."
I'll know better what to do
. What if he couldn't 'perform his husbandly duties'? What then?
"Yeah, I guess. Although…" Harry walked up behind him, noticing changes on the tapestry that hadn't been there before. "Oh, it has changed. Huh."
"Then you came in and you know the rest." He heard a noise at his side and looked over to see Draco. His face beet-red. "Don't be mad, I know I screwed it up."
"Don't speak," Harry ordered, and the look on his face leached away some of Draco's amusement. His eyes were so intense Draco wouldn't have been able to look away if he tried.
A week after their initial meeting, Oliver caught up with Harry after he'd been to see the team trainer. "One more thing, Harry," Oliver said calmly. "Before you even think about getting back on a broom for me, you will get cleared by the team's Mind Healer. That is not open for discussion."
He'd eaten a bagel standing up leaning against the kitchen counter, drinking a scalding hot cup of tea. By the time he dragged himself up the two flights of stairs to get to Harry's suite, he was so tired he was glad no one was trying to speak to him; he feared his only response would be nonsensical babble. He stripped off Harry's terry-cloth bathrobe, laying it over the foot of the bed, then slipped naked between the sheets. He was sound asleep moments after his head hit the pillow.
who had knocked him off and claimed the top spot. He was surprised and annoyed to learn that
A few hours later Draco was savouring the last sip of his third—or was it his fourth?—Firewhisky, listening to the fire crackling in the hearth under the sound of coffee-table jazz playing quietly on the stereo.
"Ah, my love," Draco said, a smile in his voice. "Come along. Your grand-mére taught me how to properly pack a trunk, and she's a genius."
oo00oo
don't even know what's happening." Harry wanted to groan in frustration. "And now you're annoyed and…"
Bryant rolled his eyes. "Right. Might as well hit your opponent with a good case of acne. It'd be almost as effective." He laughed loudly, and looked around at his friends again. They were all staring at him, mouths open.
from her purse, passing it to Draco.
Harry tightened his arms around him until Draco found it hard to get a deep breath.
"Yes, sir." Harry didn't delay further; he pulled Draco in and covered his lips, gently parting them with his tongue. Draco sighed softly, one of his hands sliding up into Harry's thick hair. He angled his head, and the kiss ripened, deepened. But when Harry started to press forward and to ease him down onto his back, Draco stopped him with a hand in the middle of his chest. Harry stilled, looking down at him. "What?"
"Don't worry about it Ava," Draco assured her swiftly, wondering how to get the scarf out of his daughter's hand and somehow behind a sofa cushion.
"We could always go over to the pens and let them know," Draco offered.
Draco sighed. "You do if you're the Healer on staff and you're trying to run a diagnostic on your patient."
Draco pursed his lips and nodded slowly. "Said that, did she? My understanding from what I've read is that traveling by Floo in the later months of pregnancy isn't advised because of the dangers of splinching." Astoria grimaced. "Yes, it's particularly grizzly, but apparently possible. So, would you care to try again?"
"I got my marks on my Management Accountants certificate exams this morning."
"I know you do," She murmured. "I love you, too. And Philippe has the patience of a bloody saint. Between the three of us, we should manage not to kill the sprog, don't you think?"
"Pansy, I adore you, but you pout like a pro," Draco told her. "Now listen, we need to do this or he's going to go away!"
"You're a Healer?"
"I'm old, young man. Not dead." Harry felt his ears heat in the cold air. She winked at him and then turned to walk the short distance to Edna's bright pink door. Harry waited until it opened and another old lady swathed in shawls, these loud paisley prints, greeted her with a hug. He turned back to the bus and jogged up the steps.
To add insult to injury, Bryant was in the Level II class with all his cohorts. The bullshite started the first day, with Bryant making comments under his breath, then looking completely innocent if Harry tried to call him on it.
Draco laughed. "I wondered there for a moment. So tell me everything." And even though he'd asked, Draco tried hard not to roll his eyes as Pansy went on and on and on some more about the
"There's some things I'm not going to tell even you, so don't ask. Did Draco and I enjoy each other's company? Yes. What am I feeling for him? I have no fucking clue. I just know that we had a great time together and seem to have chemistry between us."
A quick glance at the clock on the wall had Ron grimacing. "Shit, I need to get going. I told Hermione I was going to be a bit late, but this is really pushing it."
"I think I was fairly clear." He replied. "What, other than upholding a contract I had absolutely nothing to do with, is in this whole—arrangement for me?"
"Touchy." Harry frowned "Where are you going that you have to be so fancy, anyway?"
"Oh that sounds really nice. I can't wait to see you tomorrow." There was a brief pause. "Thank you for calling, Draco. It was good to hear your voice."
Harry choked on his naan. "I am not obsessed with Malfoy. Well, I wasn't." He sighed expansively. "Honestly I'm not sure what I am when it comes to him."
She turned to Draco, lips pursed, all but stomping her little stiletto clad foot. "Yes?"
Draco managed an outraged scoff. "I have not," he countered. "And 'Holy Mordred's vagina'? Where in the hell did you pick that up. That's…" he shuddered, "vile."
"I could live the rest of my life without the thoughts of you and Hermione having sex, thank you very much." Harry shuddered.
"Right in one. Come on and I'll introduce you."
It took every ounce of Draco's will power not to start yelling about
and the connection closed.
"Hey 'Mione," Harry said, leaning over to kiss her cheek. "Good to see you." The pinched look on her face, in conjunction with a pointed look at Darian, made Harry bite the inside of his lip.
"Potter," Pansy echoed, nudging Draco toward the booth where Harry was sitting.
She glared at him, snapping the paper open again. "For God's sake, Draco. Will you calm the fuck down? I've already cast Muffliato and a Notice Me Not spell, and if you look around, you'll see that you are not in a magical establishment. I believe that was the condition of your sentence—that you do not go into any magical areas? We're right in the middle of the Notting Hill shopping district, which can hardly be called magical. Merlin, calm your tits. Just looking at the bloody paper isn't going to summon the Ministry."
"Shut up," Harry muttered. Draco grinned as he wrapped his arms around Harry and held him tight.
Harry stood, shaking his head. "Those two morons? I don't even want to think about how many laws they've broken."
Draco gave him a slow smirk. "Only if you mean it."
"Pans?" Draco said, more of a question than a statement. His knees felt like water and he could scarcely breathe. "Merlin's nuts, Pans! What the fuck are you doing here?"
"So, goodbyes taken care of?"
Ron winked at his wife, then his expression changed. He looked at Harry, then back at Hermione again. Then he groaned.
"Hoping to play a little more tonsil tennis with the good Healer before you leave?"
Philippe reached behind Pansy and laid a hand on Draco's shoulder, squeezing the cap of muscle there. "No one is blaming you, Draco. In fact we are all so grateful to you for being here with her. It has been such a relief knowing she wasn't alone, and that you cared so deeply for her."
Harry nodded. "We'll see. I need sleep. Tell Charlie I'm sorry I missed him again. He with Zoya?"
"Right, right," Harry held up his hands. "You just can't expect a horny man to not touch something that nice."
"I can't close my trunk," she said, sounding near tears. "And I still have clothes to go in."
Pansy gave Draco
Draco paused as the sound of little running steps came from the kitchen, and through the dining room. Camélia came around the corner, now wearing a chocolate moustache and her little bunny slippers.
"Oh, I know she does," Darian said. "She's got the sensitivity of a dinner plate, but I know she truly cares."
Harry stared at her for a long time. He was going to argue with her, he really was, but he was so tired of pretending.  He shrugged. "Yeah," he finally admitted softly. "I think I figured myself out because I was fixated on his arse."
"Take care, Potter." Draco ran his hand down Harry's cheek, and turned to walk away.
He shook his head and walked behind the bar to make them both a large gin and tonic. When they were mixed, he carried them to the coffee table and set them on the coasters that were always present.
daughter, Astoria."
♥ ♥ ♥
"Aside from putting your life back together, you mean?" she replied.
"Oh, I didn't see you," Harry turned and pulled the door shut. "Sorry, just…err. Well I'm not quite sure." No way in hell he was telling Charlie's boyfriend he had a boner that was about to burst his zip. Hoping against hope it wasn't obvious, Harry turned back toward Deon.
across the nursery, no biscuits had ever suddenly been in her hand when she'd been told no. Draco was devastated. Tears ran silently down his cheeks, and he mourned the absolute loss of magic in his life for the second time. This time for the delights of magic that his daughter would never know.
"That's not necessary. Just, please. Astoria. Don't do this again, alright? I can't afford for you to spend the way you're used to."
“Because lovely as your arse is, darling, I won’t kiss it.”
Draco thought the man must be mad, and he was afraid his expression must convey that. He held his ground, staring at Ludo, waiting. Finally, Ludo sighed.
as he rolled his eyes at Ron. "Way to be subtle, mate. The two guys behind you did a double-take when you mentioned Quidditch!"
"Bitch."
They were taking on the Wimbourne Wasps. There was a long term, bitter rivalry between the two teams, and the matches were known to be filled with poor sportsmanship and illegal plays on both sides. Oliver had been adamant in a team meeting the day before that they
Harry grinned. "I know you hate the mess. We've been together long enough that I take some of what you bitch about to heart."
The diminutive elf rushed to the cabinet and hit her head against it. "Flimsey is bad," she said over and over.
Harry laughed and followed Draco into the living room. "I've been trying to throw him out the door, Pans, honest."
"I'd just hate to see her… settle."
"But who was it who had the balls out impudence to tell the old fool to his face it was time he hung up his cauldron?"
"So every bastard and his brother seems to think." Harry rolled his eyes. "Fuck. It wasn't even that close. I should know, I was right there."
"Oh, right." Was the best Harry could come up with in reply.
Anything that had been damaged with magic could be restored, but the Aurors obviously knew that, and these fuckers had brought knives with them. He hadn't thought he could be any angrier; he'd been wrong.
Harry tilted his head and smiled. "Potter? Back to that, are we, Malfoy?"
oo00oo
Harry gave him a wry look. "Know about my itches, do you?"
They both jumped and their hands came apart as they looked up at her. Draco turned back to Harry.
"Do you?"
"Oh, I don't know about stunning," Harry said awkwardly.
"Would have been worth it, given what was in them," she said wistfully.
"Everything's fine," Harry promised. "Just looking forward to kicking a bit of Weasley girl behind. No offence, Molly, but she's been rubbing my nose in what she plans to do to me since last season."
"I just don't make a bigger deal about it than it needs to be. I'm very careful who I do wandless magic in front of. A cleaning spell to get spunk out of my pants
Harry turned his head and gave him a slightly sour look. "I do have a brain in my head, you know."
Darian showed Harry a few simple steps to style his hair and gave him a bag with the products he'd need. They were on their way to the front desk when Harry gathered his courage and looked at the handsome stylist.
Pansy snorted. "Oh, darling, you are so truly clueless."
Harry paused outside the apothecary and looked up and down the cobblestone streets. He smiled, as he had the first time he saw Diagon Alley. All the memories of seeing magic performed came back to him in a heady rush. "It's really brilliant," he enthused. "It's smaller than Diagon, but just as amazing."
As he started up the narrow stairs to their bedroom, he heard the sound of the shower running in their en suite. Smiling slowly, he unbuttoned the top of his ratty work robe. When he crossed the threshold into their room, he saw his new pale blue robes hanging on the door of his armoire, encased in a shimmering protective spell. 'Draco Malfoy, Pharmaceutical Supervisor' was embroidered in dark blue thread on the right breast pocket. Encouraged Harry had remembered to pick them up, and that the address for the auction house handling the sculptures was
Shifting to wrap his arm around Tommy and Draco, Harry cleared his throat softly. "This is Lily…and Scott's way of telling you that you're just as important to them. You'll be surprised to know that Lily and I have talked about this in the past. One day when she was in uni she told me she found a quote by a Muggle that said something like,
"So what should I do? I don't want to leave it like this. I also don't want to push him away."
"It's done," Darian sighed. "Now," he propped his hands on Harry's shoulders, forcefully pulling Harry's gaze back to the mirror, "what are the rules?"
"See here's the thing," Harry said around a mouthful of pad thai, pointing with his chopsticks. "I can't find a damn thing about an order to go to Malfoy's and detain him or to toss his place."
"What? No, honestly, I just thought…" He stopped, then dropped his head onto the table, just as the server brought them their drinks.
"May I help you?"
"Pierre Blanches Pinot Noir, nice choice. I'm sure you had help with that, my wine challenged friend. Did the clerk slip you his number in the hopes of sharing this with you?" Hermione's laugh was musical and exactly what Harry needed at the moment.
The Leaky was doing a brisk lunch time business, and he returned Hannah Longbottom's wave as he exited out into Muggle London. He slipped his hands deep into his pockets as he stepped into the flow of sidewalk traffic.
Holden looked as if he was giving that some consideration when Beecham hit him in the arm. "Don't let that lying sack of shit get to you!"
"From the moment you implied to Dorin it was a date, my brain sort of short circuited." He rolled his eyes at Draco's frown. "No, in a good way. Like all I could think was that it might be nice to be on a date with you."
"He's out," Ron whispered. "I need to go call Hermione."
"How does the television work? I mean…"
The next time Draco looked up, his eyes were wet, but he'd seemed to have found his voice. "I don't understand. Your Dad…he's…he's everything."
Thirty-year-old Milton Sanderson, star Beater for the Arrows, was six foot seven and weighed in easily at 19 stone. Harry and Ron had placed bets on what sort of broom could even get him in the air. Harry had vowed to stay on the notoriously cranky Sanderson's good side.
"You're on!"
Draco propped his hands on his hips. "You obnoxious little bastard."
A snort stilled his hand.
He hesitated over the
"Why are you crying?" He was truly baffled.
"Yeah, I know. But I still need to read this and see what it says."
"Apparently it's been under contract for a long time, since they were small. Some of these contracts have been let lapse, but not this one. Apparently both sides are determined to follow the terms of the agreement…"
"Oh, you aren't so very objectionable," Draco teased. "Most of the time you're completely sane. And very, very shagable."
Draco thought at the beginning of his Muggle educational journey that Pansy, and to a lesser extent Philippe, had lost the bloody plot. When he read the qualifications for an accounting degree, he had precisely zero of the necessary coursework. Hogwarts didn't offer classes in maths or economics, and he doubted classes that included Outstanding N.E.W.T.s in Potions and Arithmancy were going to help him one bit. When he told Pansy all that, she'd merely laughed at him and produced transcripts for one Draco Malfoy, including something called a 'GMAT', on which his Muggle counterpart had apparently scored a more than respectable 701.
Draco hesitated, and he saw the hope in Harry's eyes begin to fade.
Harry worked half-heartedly through a few Quick Laps on some of the moderate difficulty maps. His times were pretty abysmal, but he managed to pick up some powerful bonuses in the Broom Drills by sheer luck which were enough to knock
"But…but…he's…him and I'm…me" Harry spluttered.
Philippe's father came over, stopping in front of them. Draco wiped beneath his eyes and stood to shake his hand. "Mr Sorrentino, I'm so sorry for your loss."
"Once I finished school, I was determined to be Harry from there on out. So, please call me Harry."
Harry looked down into Deylon’s pale, perfectly nice blue eyes, and realized it was true. He was, absolutely hopeless. He was mad for his Auror field partner, and could think of little else other than what it would feel like to kiss Draco Malfoy, to hold him in his arms. He’d be a freak in bed, Harry imagined, desire slipping down his spine, hardening his cock. He canted his hips back, not wanting to give Deylon the wrong idea. How did one actually explain that the hard on you were sporting wasn’t for him?
. It will be delightfully encouraging to see that the saviour of us all actually does have limitations."
Draco leaned back in his chair and sighed. "As you might have guessed this is one of my favourite places to eat when I come into town. Dorin is constantly hassling me that I'm too young not to have a boyfriend. I'm sorry, but it really is the easiest way not to have him hovering all night dropping ridiculous hints."
"Draco Malfoy-Potter!" Harry snapped softly. "Stop it right now. For the love of god, I manage an entire Auror division. I organise ops that involve coordinating scads of personnel." He glared at his spouse. "I'm damn sure I can manage to give our daughter her bottle at six, her bath at seven and have her in bed by half-seven. I'm not a moron!"
His mother had closed off the Manor's east wing immediately following the war. The filth and dark magic Voldemort and his ilk had left behind made it uninhabitable. After she was exiled to France, Draco seriously considered burning it to the ground. But the memories of losing Vince in the Fiendfyre at Hogwarts were still too raw, so he simply pretended the wing didn't exist. He wandered the family wing, through some of the other rooms, trying to find some happy memories to cling to but he felt so overwhelmed with despair, it nearly choked him.
Sitting back in his chair, Draco pondered the conversation. Pursing his lips, he thought,
"Yum." She chuckled. "Does the wife know you're cheating on her?"
Draco shook his head quickly, as if to erase the memories and his maudlin mood. He knew he was stalling. He needed to go tell Pansy the whole story, but even now after getting some sleep he didn't have a fucking clue what was going on or why he'd been dragged to the Ministry.
"I'm not taking your father's money, Pansy!" Draco cried, horrified. "Leave me some of my pride."
Pansy broke the silence with an audible sigh. "Oh for the love of—" She plucked Draco's phone out of his hand and flipped it open. She quickly scrolled through the contacts, smiled at Draco and hit
Draco made the little noise in his throat he made every morning as he woke, a soft groan and a grunt as he stretched. Rather than lie there and pretend to be asleep, Harry rolled over and put his head on Draco's shoulder.
Draco shook his head. "When you've got nothing tangible, all you have left that's worth a tinker's damn is your pride."
The doorbell rang again and Draco tapped his foot sharply. "If that's Frank dropping off the Omnioculars, there's a special order for him on the counter. And please, do hurry."
Astoria stood. "Like I'd want anything from you now—including your precious daughter." She walked toward the door and turned. "Mummy is downstairs, and we're going to pack right now—the
His fire flared green and Hermione's face popped into view. "Harry," she called out. He shifted to his side and hung his head over the edge of the couch.
oo00oo
Harry pretended to think about it. "No, actually. No we don't." He pressed his chest over Draco's, pinning him down, his hand slipping between them and stroking up Draco's long thigh. Draco placed his fingers over Harry's lips just as they would have closed over his.
Draco smirked as she popped out. "Well, there's you told."
Harry stood, hands on hips, his wand dangling from his fingers. "I know colours just fine. Red, blue, green, yellow. What the hell am I supposed to do when you're tossing things at me like chartreuse and saffron!"
He saw Pansy look up at him and blink.
"See, that's the thing," Draco looked Harry in the eyes. "I can tell you this story, which is true, in case you wondered. But I can't for the life of me tell you her name. She died right in front of me and I can't tell you who she was." He took a deep breath. "I knew after that I wanted something more out of life. I was good at potions and transfiguration, so I decided to do something with my life. Mother's still never gotten over it. But she's happy in her villa in Switzerland, pretending I don't work and especially pretending I've never dealt with the, shall we call it
"Thank you," he murmured. The next words seemed pulled out of him without his permission. "So do you."
. But of course, his brain went right to the night he and Draco had enjoyed a jar of chocolate body paint and the inventive ways they used to remove their
Draco sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. "I know. Sorry. It's just…difficult to remember how it all happened. I've kept it to myself for so long." He took a sip of his drink, then hid a small smile behind his glass.
"Suddenly?" Astoria laughed. She moved closer to him and pressed up against his side, her breasts soft against his upper arm. He could smell alcohol on her breath. "And you made me believe we'd have a proper marriage." He stepped back from her clinging body. She made a
oo00oo
Draco's glare spoke silent volumes.
"She hasn't got a brother." Pansy's piquant face was very amused.
He was glad Preston made the offer; he'd been so wound up he'd actually left his own broom at home! He followed Preston back to the locker room where Appleby Arrows Quidditch leathers waited for him in an open locker.
Draco ignored Pansy's
The image had aged. He looked strained and thin but so, so handsome. His white-blond hair was softer around his face, and his grey eyes looked wide, softer than Harry remembered. His chin was angled up softly, but the arrogance was gone.
Bugger, Draco thought to himself. He had intended to get around to that question, but now would have to wait for a few questions to pass before he could inquire.
It was the smell, and the rough feeling of inexpensive sheets against his fingertips. Pillows as flat as the ancient, much used cushions on Arthur and Molly's living room sofa beneath his head. And the tell-tale sounds: hushed shoes with the occasional squeak on linoleum floors, the distinct sound of alert bells and chimes, and the soft voices paging the Healers.
Harry was clearly listening intently. "And this caused you to have a falling out with Pansy, how?"
Harry nodded. “I think that’s a very good idea. Just – let me know if you need any help.”
"And I did listen to what you said about not wanting to travel alone. So I was thinking, what if you went some place where you knew someone. That way it wouldn't be so much like travelling alone."
♥ ♥ ♥
"For Merlin's sake, Papa, stop fishing for something that isn't there. We just want to have dinner with you, although I certainly can't figure out why at the moment." She laughed and gave him a saucy little wave as the connection closed.
They stood and together cleaned up the picnic before Apparating away.
Draco took a step closer. "You do realize you're rambling…right?"
She was barely out of earshot when Ron blurted out, "How'd it go, Mr Quidditch star? Did they hire you? Are you the new reserve Seeker for the Arrows?"
, but he had to agree, it was a good way to get to know somebody. Even if that somebody was clearly
As Hermione reminded him often, he was a bit shit at reading people, but Harry felt like he was talking to someone else just now. This
"We really had a great time together. I felt," he paused, "well I felt more than I expected to ever feel for Draco. He's funny, charming, and good looking. But he's also smart and really cares about everybody in the compound. And he's damn good at his job."
The Dark Mark,
"You planning on looking at that letter you got, Harry, or you just gonna let me sit here about to explode all night?"
"Oh, you're just a barrel of laughs," Draco drawled. "And stop calling her Dumpling. Her name is Clare, for Merlin's sake. She's not something you put in your stew." He stopped and kissed the back of the baby's head as he passed. "And your Auntie Pansy is a shrew. Best you learn that now."
"Draco," Harry replied finally. "Um, hi."
"I am."
As he inched closer, whispering sternly for Jellybean to get off the furniture, something much larger shifted on the couch. Harry realized Jellybean was tucked firmly under Draco's arm on the couch.
Hermione returned her appraising look. "Back at you." She turned to Harry. "I can do this alone, you know."
She leaned closer to him. “He dates them. He. Does. Not. Fuck. Them.”
"So I somehow need to become less interesting?" Harry shot back. "What's less interesting than a Quidditch player with a broken back, whose biggest obstacle to getting outdoors is the fucking steps down from the front porch."
"Oh do fuck off, Draco," Pansy replied with a roll of her eyes. "That was bitchy even for you, didn't get laid last night?"
Răzvan said something in Romanian and Draco gave a hearty laugh. "Yes, you're right" Draco replied, "he doesn't look much like a
"Possibly," he answered casually. "Is Gunther about?"
Draco pulled Harry close. "Looks like
He had to admit that caring for a baby was far more work than even he had imagined, especially since Camélia had colic and was fussy much of the time. Draco and Ava could often calm her by walking with her, but Astoria found a crying baby
Darian sighed. "I know you do. And I know it won't impress you a bit when I tell you I won't let you go alone, because I'd just spend the night at home trying to read a book, but worrying about you. You need to remember that I too went to the gay banquet you're now gorging yourself at, and I always,
Pansy strode across the room, grabbing Draco's trembling hands before pulling him into her arms. She tucked her head under his chin, wrapping her hands around his body and clutching him, hard. She whispered against his chest, her voice raw, "Because I love you and I won't let you give up."
With a satisfied smile, Hermione answered with one word. "Romania."
"Which merely proves she's soft in the head as well as delusional."
"Are you alright, Astoria," Draco asked, honestly a bit alarmed.
As a matter of fact, Draco did catch a whiff of gaminess lingering to him.
"Of course."
"Oh, lovely," he groaned. "Christening Daddy, then, are you? I guess I can only be grateful you didn't choose to christen Papa's down comforter. Fuck," he muttered under his breath, looking around for a place to put her, no longer trusting the towel to be enough protection between her and the bed. Finally he decided on the thick carpeting in front of their fireplace and wrapped the towel around her, then stood to yank his clothes off, letting them fall to the top of his hamper in the corner. Draco had always insisted on his own hamper, the fussy git. His, an exact match for Harry's, was neatly closed on the other side of the armoire while Harry's dirty laundry seemed to multiply all on its own and spilled out over the top. He decided he'd deal with that as soon as Clare was in bed.
As he was passing the sitting room he came to an abrupt halt, startled to find himself face to face with his mother-in-law and his wife. Astoria lifted her chin and stared at him. Her eyes, usually a soft blue, seemed to hold an arctic frost in her pale face.
"A bit of warning please," Draco grumbled, "the bits are a tender area and need a soft hand."
Simone blinked several times. "But, darling. You need me to show you what to do."
Harry turned to Draco. "No, tell me. I want to hear it. Please. What would happen if she fell in love?"
. There was an odd sense of urgency in them; as though they were words that should have been spoken rather than texted.
Harry nodded. "When tomorrow?" And Merlin he hoped that didn't sound as needy as it felt.
Pansy's mouth formed a perfect circle. "Oh." She recovered quickly and continued. "So you've contacted Christie's and have authorised them to place your bid as high as necessary."
Harry reached over and set his hand of one of Draco's, stilling it mid-movement.  He slid his fingers between Draco's, in spite of the awkward angle. "Maybe it's time I find out."
"You're
"It is not amusing, Draco," she said stiffly and he imagined to her, it probably wasn't. Losing access to that kind of money had to sting.
"You want him to give it to you. Yes, I know." She laid her hand on his arm. "He isn't going to. Now, what's more important, letting Potter fail in this because you're too stubborn, or getting the piece you've only wanted for the last five years?"
"Well that's colourful," Harry said with a grimace. "Yes, I brought food. Charlie had me pack a sandwich, some chocolate biscuits and a flagon of pumpkin juice. I hope at least some of that is okay." He handed the bag to Draco and grinned when Draco popped a biscuit into his mouth with a happy moan, that went straight to Harry's dick.
Knowing it wasn't good to exhaust Astoria, Draco pulled his mobile from his pocket and called for a cab. When it arrived, they stood to leave, and Simone bustled over and immediately began to fuss over Astoria. Draco wanted to strangle her when she began to complain—not particularly quietly—that it would be so much simpler if she was able to Apparate Astoria home.
"And are you planning on asking it?" Paloma Proudfoot replied sharply.
Draco followed behind, a bit more slowly than he normally would have. He wanted Harry to see the article before he came into the room.
Feeling somewhat restored, Draco pushed up onto his elbow and watched Harry walk across the room, arse muscles flexing, broad bare back a thing of beauty in the firelight. Harry bent and picked up the flannel, hanging it over the side of the hamper.
"Ludo is in custody, bitching a blue streak on how he was set up to anyone who will listen." Harry's mouth flattened. "I'm sorry, Draco." Draco's heart sank at his expression.
"Shall I take her upstairs, Draco?"
Harry managed—barely—to not say anything he would later regret.
Draco pushed past him to the wardrobe. He shuffled things back and forth before pulling out a pair of black jeans and a grey jumper. "These," he said, handing the items to Harry.
Draco led the way into the small parlour he had been living in. Philippe sat on the couch and motioned for Draco to sit in one of the chairs by the fire. Pansy sat by Philippe, leaning into him. He braced his hands on his solid knees. "I don't have to tell you that living as a Muggle is different. You're learning this. And going to uni is not going to be like attending Hogwarts."
"Charlie!" Harry spluttered, sending a shower of beer across the table. "I….no…I…"
Sitting at the table sipping his coffee, Harry frowned at his phone again.
"Good morning, sunshine," Darian chirped, as hands holding a vial of what looked like Hangover Potion appeared in his line of sight. "Forgot what my flat looks like, did you?"
"At least I'm getting laid on a regular basis," Draco tilted his head and gave her a pitying look. "Can you say the same?"
and he
Charlie shook his head as he laughed. "I've a feeling Hermione has it figured out already. She saw Deon when she Floo called the other night. And since he was in his boxers…" His smile faded and he scrubbed a hand over his chin. "Although I don't really have to worry about her telling anyone, do I?"
things he could be doing. Ron, on the other hand, thought it was brilliant and asked Harry to take him on a rip-roaring tour of England when they got back from retrieving Hermione's Mum and Dad from Australia.
"With room to spare," Rob agreed. "You do know the flats get larger and posher the higher up you go on the roster."
She collapsed in gales of laughter and after a few moments, Draco joined her.
They'd spoken at the same time and stopped at the same moment. Immediately on the heels of their voices tapering off, the sound of rapid little footsteps coming down the stairs made them both turn.
Harry sat back. "You could, however, stop grinning at me. It's not my fault. I looked up at you when you came and hell, you looked so damn hot. All it took was my own hand on pressing down on my cock and it tossed me over the edge."
"And how is that?"
"It is not fine. We've cancelled on them twice already – once because of your job and once because of mine. They're going to think we don't want to have dinner in their new place."
"Alright, Astoria," Draco said, balancing the cup on his hand, "shall we discuss what this is all about?"
"Let's go talk with Oliver and Preston first. Then, if you don't have a job anymore, you can hex him three ways from Sunday."
She hustled to a small chest against the wall, picked a glass and filled it with an Aguamenti. She brought it back to Harry, who drank it gratefully. When he was done, her wand touched the rim of the glass and it disappeared.
"Don't tell me the hero's afraid of the healer?" Deon teased.
"Sometimes, yes."
While they ate, they talked about this and that and really not much of anything. Harry knew he was avoiding any discussion of their kiss and what it might mean.
"Yes, Papa has a few scarves," he said cautiously. Something about the way she had said the words were curious.
"Pansy and I -- had a bit of a falling out, I guess you could say."
Even as he shrunk, addressed and neatly stacked the last parcel for tomorrow's owl-order dispatch, the niggling feeling in his stomach still hadn't abated.
Draco blinked, his mind whirling, his fists clenching in frustration. He forced his lips into a grim line. At least that way his mouth wouldn't flop about like a landed fish, no sound coming out. He could imagine how much the bastard in front of him would enjoy that.
"Miss what?" Draco asked, clearly confused.
Harry stepped into his jeans, pulling them up, fastening his belt. "I'll call Hermione and tell her to alert the troops."
"Mr Potter," he said deferentially.
"It was tea," he answered dryly. "Afternoon Tea at the Goring is always lovely. Their afternoon blend is always perfectly brewed and served with perfect little cucumber sandwiches. Everyone displaying their perfect, high pinkie manners."
"I imagine you won't find out unless you try." Harry's tone held promise.
"And it comes mostly furnished," Philippe went on. "If you have a few things you'd like to take, a few pieces of smaller furniture, that would be fine. Mostly what we'll be moving is your clothes. Although I do suspect you don't own much in the way of Muggle clothing… but no worry there. I'm quite certain you're aware that our Pansy is the queen of shopping."
They wandered down the streets, looking into shop window and occasionally stopping to go inside a store and check it out. Harry picked up a few gifts for Hermione and Teddy along the way.
"I just couldn't imagine you were much of a mechanic." Draco studied him with grey eyes, and Harry fought the urge to fidget. He looked out at the street instead.
Draco huffed. "Revolting. And if you bit, I'd yank every hair from your head. I'm not into pain."
"Stop thinking about it," Pansy ordered. "I could tell the precise moment Potter entered your head. Without you saying a word, I can feel the tension returning to your body."
He sighed and crossed his arms. Honestly, how difficult could this be? He shook his head. If you were Harry Potter, apparently
"Morgana's saggy tits, Draco. Open your mind to the possibility. He practically said to you 'Hey, I'm Harry Potter!' Look here," she scrolled back several messages. "Here!" she pointed to the screen.
"I was just going to ask Toby where his mum was," Draco said.
Harry couldn't help but grin slightly, then it faded. "So now what? Do we keep
The house had been quiet when Draco woke up, the other side of the bed cold. It wasn't uncommon for Harry to go in early; in fact, he seemed to remember Harry saying something about a stake out. Draco hadn't really been listening; he'd been mentally rehearsing his argument for Christie's to allow him to buy the 'Blue Mother Dragon with White Baby' before the auction even started. He thought he might be able to do it; he could be very persuasive when he wanted to be.
The evening came to an end after a photographer from the
"And she's back," Draco laughed and shook his head.
His brain was whirling in so many directions, it nearly made him dizzy. He tried to sort his thoughts. First there was that kiss. It had been so tender. Harry tried to remember ever being kissed with so much pure emotion, but couldn't think of a time. Mostly his experience with other men was more of a
"So how does Astoria feel about becoming a mother?"
His black hair gleamed, no longer a disreputable mess but something artfully mussed by some stylist who’d actually
"Draco, that's illegal."
"And I really hope you keep that promise." Harry let his arms drop to his sides and lowered his voice. "I kind of like my prick and balls right where they are."
Draco sighed. "I never thought it was."
Draco was surprised by her softly confessed sentiment, so unusual for her. It warmed his heart.
"What are you going to do?" Pansy asked.
"This had better be good, if you're…" Draco stopped when he opened the door and saw Harry.
“So, is this a result of your previous partner, or are you that happy to see me?”
"Draco— your lab. Oh, shit, I hadn't even thought—"
"Oh do get fucked, Malfoy." Harry grabbed at several files threatening to slide to the floor.
"It's
It made Draco laugh, which was the point. He hadn't been doing much of that lately. And Harry knew why.
"I truly am so sorry."
but she snapped the phone shut and slid it back across the table.
Harry tripped and struggled to remain on his feet. "Draco? What are you doing here?"
"Tish tosh, Draco, she's only two years younger than you, which makes her twenty."
The bus lurched and groaned and Harry's ear popped. He glanced in his rear view and smiled when Malfoy reached out and grabbed the back of the seat in front of him, his knuckles white. Moments later the thatched roofs and brick walls of Afriston came into view outside the windshield. He shoved the bus into park, then turned and looked down the aisle. As always, Mrs Erminmeister was wide awake, shoving her knitting into her carpet bag and rising to her feet. He had no idea what inner sense told her that her stop was up, but she never slept through it. She toddled down the aisle, patting Malfoy on his square shoulder as she passed.
"Or maybe Grandma Weasley could look after the sprout. You know she'd love it."
"Oh how foolish," She turned a charming pink. "I still have so much to learn." She slid her hand into the crook Draco's arm and leaned against his side, giving him a hopeful look. "I hope you won't mind teaching me?"
Draco pulled on a pair of joggers and walked Harry downstairs. At the door, they kissed again. This time it was longer and filled with promise.
Harry thought about it. "He's maybe twenty-six."
Pansy's cup stalled halfway to her mouth and she stared at him, dark brown eyes very wide. After a moment, she carefully lowered her cup to the table. "Well," she said finally, "aren't you just a potent little pro-creator? This had to happen on your wedding night, didn't it?"
Harry leaned into the overstuffed back of the sofa, pulling Draco along with him. He chuckled softly. "Draco, I love you, but subtle you are not."
. It took Draco a moment for the fact he could read his name to register.
"Easy, Harry," a warm voice said softly. "No rush."
He paused at the bathroom door. "When I come out of here, we're going to go have dinner with your son and my cousin like grown-ups."
Draco blinked, then shook his head. "You aren't wrong."
He had finished reading the book his mother had loaned him—a delightfully intriguing murder-mystery featuring the ever glamorous and intrepid
"Oh, sweet man," Ludo crooned. "Of course you do. I'm referring to the visit you had from some of the fine members of our Auror Squad a few days ago. I'm guessing that's their handiwork on your face."
Harry shook his head. "He deserves what he gets. Anyway, Robards stopped paying Ludo his cut. Then you insulted Ludo's
"That's sort of difficult when I live in fucking Appleby most of the year," he growled.
He landed close to the open end of the alley, but fortunately no one was around. He rushed out and down to The Bullfrog Pond. Inside he grabbed one of the few tables still open. Even on a Monday, the pubs in London did a decent business at the end of a workday. Ron came in a few minutes later. He nodded to let Harry know he saw him, then wound his way through the tightly packed tables to get to Harry. As soon as Ron sat, the server came over and took their order.
He had to wait for a response, or let it go. It was no longer within his control.
Harry was beyond confused. Surely
Harry stared at him steadily as Draco slipped off his coat and settled across from him in the booth. "What?" he asked finally, shifting a bit uncomfortably.
When the guard came back, Draco followed him down to the shower room. He used a pitifully thin flannel to wash himself as best he could, wishing for his wand and a cleansing spell. He knew he had the sour stench of sweat and fear on his skin, but there was no way Draco would remove one piece of clothing in front of anyone in the building, even for a wash. The bruise on his face throbbed, making Draco wonder if it looked as bad as it felt.
Harry knew he had to look as surprised as he felt when he nodded his head in reply.
Harry rubbed his fingers over his mouth to hide his snigger.
"And he has Parkinson, who is here. She won't let him starve; you can count on that."
"Don't push it, Potter."
"And you're deluded." He shook his head and smiled, allowing her to cast the spell as they stepped into darkness.
"And it's time for more pain potion. You can't have anything with alcohol, but I've bought Diet Coke."
Ron scrawled.
Draco laughed. And as he did, he realised it was the first time in weeks he actually felt like laughing. He didn't know what had prompted Pansy to turn up, but as he poured her a glass of Bordeaux, he was eternally grateful she had.
Draco scooped Camélia up into his arms and turned her trembling body away from Astoria. He glared at her and mouthed, "Not another fucking word." Then tried to comfort his daughter, as he carried her back to bed.
"I was going to say insane, but your way is nicer."
"Did you, without my permission or knowledge, connect my fireplace to the Floo Network?"
—" she wheezed, slapping her thigh, "Potter did
"Muh- Malfoy?" Potter said, breathless. His voice was so deep; when had that happened?
Draco nodded. "As I recall hearing at Hogwarts, despite the inordinate amount of time you spent in the Infirmary, it was not your favourite place. I suspect that remains true, but you need to stay overnight for…"
"Merlin, Draco," she said walking into the room in her bra and panties.
replied tersely.
"Draco heard that," Draco called from the sitting room. "Don't make me sorry I stood up for you." Harry shook his head.
Harry watched Mickey sashay, and that was the only word that fit, across the room and poke his head behind an elaborately painted wooden screen. He was curious about the brilliant Darian, wondering exactly what a modern miracle worker might look like.
Harry inhaled sharply, and for a moment he wondered what he should do. Then he thought of Pansy, and decided he actually was braver than he’d been acting, and if it caused a problem at work, well… he’d just have to deal with it.
He gave her a disparaging look. "All of it? Like who tops and who bottoms?"
Unfortunately, Draco knew they were right. Even though he had spent several years now without magic, living among and getting to understand Muggles better than he ever had at Hogwarts, Draco knew Astoria's discomfort around them was their biggest liability when it came to her having to deliver the baby in a Muggle hospital. He had long given up fighting with them about it. He supposed it was because he hadn't simply come out and said,
, and Draco needed to remind himself of that.
Draco thought about it, then shook his head. "No. But I thought you might."
After that it was only Walden and Simone. Walden had booked and paid for the honeymoon suite at the Dorchester, and it apparently didn't matter how many times Draco thanked him, he needed to hear it again. And again. Until Simone said, "Walden, that's enough. Let them go, now."
That way your bride won't AK me on sight."
was a wizard or not. And in order to find out, he had to get
"Oh, shut it." He took a moment to mourn a lovely silk button down he'd bought himself recently, then threw the poor tattered thing into the bin. "During the day, he'd go for training and I'd wander around his flat. I finally mastered the appliances in the kitchen and I found an old cookbook. I started teaching myself to cook."
"Every week," she insisted.
Flimsey began to wring her little gnarled hands. "Mistress Narcissa will not be pleased with Flimsey. She will say Flimsey didn't obey her mistress."
Draco set it back down, an idea already forming in his head. "Well then, happy birthday to you. It is a remarkable gift." He walked away, quite aware that the hiss of whispers behind him meant the 'man who kept to himself' was now the current topic of conversation. It amused him and he didn't give a damn.
was the one who made Draco shudder, made him hard. His tongue flicked under the glans before he pulled Draco's cock into his mouth. Draco's resulting moan shot straight to Harry's dick. He wanted to look at Draco, to watch his face, but the cock in his mouth felt so perfect that he couldn’t stop long enough to glance up. He let Draco set the pace, forcing himself to breathe deeply through his nose, tiny exhales puffing against Draco's skin when he'd taken all of him in. Harry wrapped one hand around the base of Draco's shaft, using it for some of the up and down motion while he pressed his tongue against the vein and then pull back slowly, sucking hard until only the head was still in his mouth.
"Romania," Harry said, much more positively. "To visit Charlie. It's a great thought, but I don't even know if he'd want a visitor."
"It's all right," he murmured to him. "You can smile."
"Before you go into interrogation mode," Ron said with a laugh, "I owled Harry when I was leaving training and asked him to meet me at that Muggle bar we go to. I needed to hear how today went."
"Draco, I'm sorry. I told Mummy I thought we should let you know what was happening. But apparently the mobile was forgotten here. I'm really sorry."
“He doesn’t care about Sandringham, Draco. And my name is Hermione. Would it kill you to call me Hermione?”
"Indeed," Draco added casually. "The rain was starting as we arrived." He looked through the cafe window, the sky had darkened further and the pavement was slick with rain.
gesture. "I managed to get you to stop thinking about how Potter's doing with the baby for a minute, didn't it?" Her face softened. "Besides, I'm just getting back at you for you telling my god daughter I'm a shrew. Don't think I didn't have that connection open in case you tried to change your mind." She pouted. "But it's not just that, I miss our dinners together, Draco."
in his contacts and typed:
Draco turned just as Pansy and Philippe joined them. Philippe looked handsome and casual in jeans and an oatmeal-coloured cable knit jumper. Pansy, on the other hand, was a complete fashion plate: wearing slim fitting black leather pants, a bright red silk blouse, a black wool cape and boots with her trademark towering heels.
"If you would allow me to speak, rather than blurting out a barrage of questions," Simone interrupted, "I will inform you of the situation."
"Yeah," he said, following Darian reluctantly. "He was on the wrong side in the first war – at least as far as she was concerned."
"Well, forgive me for pointing out that unlike most people about to become a grandfather, you look somewhat less than thrilled with the prospect."
"Can't bringing Quidditch fans enjoyment be meaningful? And do you have any idea why Ron didn't Floo me this morning?"
their little girl from them. At least that's how Harry saw it. The night he'd asked for Lily's hand had been a trying one. After nearly an hour of the poor boy taking a grilling like only Potter could deliver, Lily finally stomped into the study and announced to Harry she was marrying the young man, whether he liked it or not. Once they left, Draco reminded Harry how terrifying it must be to face the vanquisher of a Dark Lord and ask for his daughter's hand.
, the paragraph began. Draco felt his blood chill and a knot of dread curled in the pit of his stomach. This could not be good.
Harry stood by the door, dressed from head to toe in black with his rucksack on the floor by his feet. "Promise you'll take good care of Jelly while I'm on this mission." He rubbed the back of his neck. "I'll be back as quickly as a can…two days, three tops."
"You," he drawled, his eyes narrowed, "are an evil, evil bint."
Pulling a bottle from the warming tray, and not for the first time Harry was so happy to be a wizard and to have the bottles always ready and at their fingertips, he touched the nipple to Clare's mouth. Her tiny lips latched on and she began sucking as if her life depended on it. Which Harry mused, it did. Feeling quite pleased that he'd been able determine what his daughter needed, Harry sat on the couch.
"What?" she said, for all purposes looking like she had no idea what he was talking about.
"Thanks. And I might possibly love you forever if whatever is in that tureen tastes as good as it smells." He sat on the couch, looking hungrily at the tray on the table in front of him.
"Oh, I knew I liked you. Cheers."
Ludo gave him a greasy, smug smile. "I'll bet you've had enough of that for the week, haven't you?" He focused on the bruises on Draco's face. He lifted his hand to touch it, and Draco ducked under his hand. "Oh, dear. Someone truly did bat you about, didn't they?"
He stopped. "Harry are you quite certain that you'll be all right here. Alone." He bit on his lower lip. He'd delivered Clare not quite three months before and this was the first time he'd left her since. "You know what? I'll just call Pansy and reschedule." Draco nodded to himself. "Yes, that's what I'll do, I'll reschedule."
The banging was enough to pull Draco from his pacing and he rushed to the elf's side. "Flimsey, stop that right now." Draco said firmly, grasping her skinny shoulders. "You are not to bang your head."
Harry chuckled, "Nah, I was quite early. And I didn't trust that stormy sky. I couldn't very well sit here smelling coffee, and not have one."
"You'll make it…disappear?" Draco raised his eyebrows and crossed his arms. "And how do you propose to do that, precisely? You haven't got that kind of clout at the Ministry, Ludo."
"Hermione." Ron scolded, shaking his head.
"You'll never convince me that you can't afford new pants. And after seeing the godawful state of those poor Cannon's briefs I'm betting there are some threadbare Quidditch jammies somewhere in your drawers—probably with Snitches on."
"Excellent." Draco straightened with an audible pop of knees. He grimaced, then pulled Harry to his feet. "Let's go home. I have plans for you."
"You know how she is, mate. She's just worried for you. Now, she's totally wrong about Quidditch, mind. But part of that is she couldn't fly around the pitch to save her life. If she's not good at it, you know Hermione: it can't really be important." Ron looked imploringly at Harry. "Remember divination? Must be rot, even with the proof of the prediction sharing breakfast with her every day."
Pansy groaned and threw her arms up, stomping out into the shop as the bell rang a third time. "I'm coming, I'm
Harry shifted and looked at his boyfriend. "Did you just sniff me?"
"You do trust me, don't you?" Pansy asked warily. "The only way this will work is if you trust me and in turn, trust Philippe. I know you've not met him, but you will shortly, and you'll like him."
" She pursed her lips. "Define…
"Takes one to know one, Auror Potter. Now, go take off those robes. And by the way, there are already two sets needing laundering in the hamper, and I will not do them for you."
Potter chuckled. "Oh, she's a charmer."
"Like how I'm a 'quib," Camélia answered thoughtfully.
"You want to take him, or shall I?"
She pursed her lips. "Then we still don't know any more than when you popped in unannounced."
Charlie smiled. "You work outside all day and see what happens." Charlie pointed to his arm. "That? Just a Ridgeback that decided to see if I was serious about moving him into a new pen." He puffed up like a peacock. "I won."
“Hey,” he protested, truly wounded. “I’ll have you know…”
"Okay." She turned and skipped back into the kitchen.
Pansy's voice echoed through his head. This was harder than almost anything he'd done so far. "I'm gay, Astoria," he said in a rush. She looked at him so mildly he wondered if she'd heard him.
"Where he can't go," Harry said flatly.
Draco scowled. "I did not break my promise."
They lay together, breath harsh against each other. Harry felt Draco shift, his hand moving to Harry's belt. "I need to take care of you," he  rasped out. "Just as soon as my bones are no longer liquid."
"How was your day?" he asked, carefully stirring his drink.
"Oh, for fucks sake," Draco burst out, setting his cup roughly aside. It clattered in the saucer. "Fine. Just get to it."
He couldn't quite remember when it happened, but he had let slip in one of their then twice-weekly sessions about Malfoy having a baby. The mention of the Malfoy name didn't draw a reaction. Colin simply hummed during Harry's conversational lull and waited for him to continue. So continue, he did: launching into the whole story about Malfoy, since the trial. How he didn't know where he went, and had been initially worried for his well-being. How he knew he was at least alive, married to Astoria Greengrass, and apparently expecting a child—the latter detail courtesy of the wretched tapestry on the wall in his sitting room. He supposed the child was probably born by now, but couldn't bring himself to look and find out what its name was, because it just hurt
"What's happened, Philippe? Is it Zia Sophia?"
A line appeared between Harry's arched brows. "Is that what you think?"
"Okay, Malfoy." He pulled the doors closed with a loud clack. "Next stop Dominion Theatre on Tottenham Court Road."
Harry knew there was a town not too far from the Reserve. He'd seen it when they were flying in. Charlie had told him the town was called Brașov, a fairly popular tourist location. It also hosted a small wizard section in town.  While Harry wasn't crazy about visiting it alone, anything was better than sitting inside all day.
Harry grinned, then siphoned the coffee away from the expensive silvery grey robes, followed by the seat and then the floor.
"Need a lift, Mister?" Harry called. He was delighted when Malfoy rolled his eyes.
reply.
"Auror Potter," he protested, still squirming against the ropes. "This man—, this man…" He apparently could see by the anger in Harry's eyes and the ticking muscle in his jaw that he wasn't getting anywhere with him. "Undersecretary Granger, surely you can see what's happening here— clearly the MLE is corrupt!!"
He was tempted to just vanish the lot but knew Harry would pitch a fit if he did, so he carefully sent the coins to a jar Harry kept on his dresser, sent the robes to the hamper, and the reports to pile neatly on top of nearly fifty just like it on the corner of his desk. Then, using one of the housekeeping charms Molly taught him, he waved his wand and dusted and polished every piece of furniture in the room.
Draco, who had been on the other side of Pansy's sass, wasn't convinced, but sat and listened.
"What?" Draco cried, then realized he was proving her point when he heard his voice echo back to him. Ordinarily his voice was on the lower side of tenor, dropped to baritone when he and his husband were in bed, but at the moment it had a shrill alto quality. He reached across his body to pinch the back of her hand. "You're a horrible cunt."
"The only thing I got out of it that I don't regret," Draco went on, "is Camélia."
Switching off the heat, Draco hurried down the hall to the main entrance and the windows alongside the door. He looked out of one of the long side windows to see a small transit van making the curve of the circular drive and coming to a halt in front of his house. His blood ran cold and he feared the wards had finally fallen and Muggles could see the house. Thinking they were coming to steal everything, he was about to run back to the kitchen for a knife, when he heard the unmistakable laugh of Pansy Parkinson. She jumped down out of the passenger side of the van and smiled back to someone inside.
Astoria crossed her arms on her chest.
Draco was fairly certain that if she could have, Lily would have stamped her foot, just as she had done at four. He smiled at the wave of nostalgia the thought inspired; she'd been so his child in temperament, bright as a new Galleon with a winning smile and a hellacious temper.
"Is that why you're late," Toby asked. "Cuz a clatalsizmic thing happened?"
But even before they entered, Harry could see that there was an enormous difference. Light poured out of the doorway, and curious, Harry peeked around the frame.
"How is it you know this and I don't?"
"You know," Pansy said thoughtfully, looking at her. "Weird as it sounds, I think I could really like you."
He escorted Mrs Erminmeister down the bus stairs and into the petrol station, ordering his coffee while flirting with the friendly Heidi, taking his time about it. It would piss Malfoy off royally, he knew, and Harry was rewarded on his return with lips so tight there was a white ring around them when he and Mrs Erminmeister boarded the bus.
"I was just going to suggest that perhaps this would be a good time for you to go on holiday. You've not been away since…well if I can't remember how long it's been – then it's been a ridiculously long time."
"But even feeling the way I did about him, I stayed away, because I knew he was too young, and I guess I knew what everyone thought of me. But James just… wouldn't give up on me, I guess. And he's so brilliant, Harry. So smart, and clever, and I love him, and I'd rather die than hurt him."
"Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?" Harry teased.
"Please Draco; you agreed not to interrupt. Just go along with me for now. The advantages to this
"DRUNK POTTER ATTACKS!" The headline screamed above the fold. "BYSTANDERS FORCED TO TAKE COVER IN GAY BAR"
sounding around him, he assumed this was a good thing.
"You were out of contact on a stake-out when it all went down. How can that possibly reflect poorly on you?"
Harry wondered if he'd been reading Draco wrong, but decided to wait until later for that discussion. They'd only kissed once, well twice counting the peck today. Maybe Draco didn't feel the same pull that Harry did. He'd worry about it later…maybe. The Portkey was about to activate and Harry wanted to be ready to go.
Draco rushed in the door, dropping his satchel on the floor. "What's wrong? Has something happened to the baby?"
"I'm going for a ride?" Harry asked, voice breathless.
"It's completely the wrong shade!" Lily cried out in anguish. "It was supposed to be pale mint and it's
Harry had moved to sit on the arm of Draco's chair, and Draco could feel him trembling with suppressed rage. Again, the windows began to rattle in their frames. The harder he fought not to show it, the more his rage seemed to reorder the basic molecules in the room. Carefully, knowing Harry's magic could be wild when he was wound up, Draco reached out and curled his hand around his wrist.
Draco nodded. A bell sounded again, two quick rings. "Harry, I'm really sorry, but I need to go. Zoya's been a bit of a problem and I have two other patients here besides Rhet. They're not as badly injured, but I set an alarm to remind me when it's nearly time for their treatments."
"Well, that makes me feel oh so very important," Pansy groused, crossing her arms.
Draco stared at the square hand, then grasped and shook it firmly. The last thing he wanted to appear before this imposing man was weak. "Draco Malfoy, and she does have a tendency to be quite the bossy-pants."
Draco smiled, feeling quite pleased with himself. It seemed his hints for what Harry should
Draco moved over to a table and pulled everything out of the bag. He unwrapped the sandwich, sniffed and took a bite. "Oh sweet Merlin, this is good. Be sure to thank Weasley for me. I was not looking forward to another bowl of broth and saltines."
"I'm so glad you're going to be alright," she said. "I know you aren't happy, but—"
Ron sighed. "About that…" He shifted, in obvious discomfort. "I wanted to firecall before I left for training, but then I thought, erm, well maybe it would be best if I didn't interrupt you." He fidgeted with a coaster. "You know, like in case you were trying to
Yeah, Harry figured. No question: He was the luckiest bastard alive.
Harry pressed his fingers into his temples, and he discovered they were sore. Not his head, although that was, too, but his fingertips. It had been bitterly cold the night before and his hands ached something fierce. "Do you plan to tell me why you're here, giving me shit when I could be sleeping?"
"Then we'll be just fine." Harry was looking around as he walked, trying to follow Charlie and Deon, but still see the compound. "This place is huge. I hope I don't get lost and end up in a dragon cage some night."
The Chief Warlock continued. "You are further prohibited from travelling out of the United Kingdom, until such time as your sentence is complete. At the end of ten years from this date if all of the conditions of this sentence have been upheld, the restrictions regarding performing magic, owning a functioning wand and the constraints from entering magical areas will be lifted. Do you, Draco Malfoy, understand the terms and conditions of your sentence?"
"I've had a lot of beer," Ron muttered and to Harry's relief, his and Hermione's conversation ended.
"Stupid Potter with his stupid broad shoulders and and his stupid sexy scar, and his stupid squeezable arse," he grumbled to himself.
"Awards banquet?" Harry scoffed. "Who in their right mind would give you an award?"
That seemed to register in Draco’s head. “Wait,” he said. “He what?”
"I think that's a brilliant idea." Draco pushed his chair back, picked up his wine glass and the half a bottle of Shiraz that sat in the middle of the table. "Come along, James," he said with a smile. "You can introduce me to your new owl."
They crossed the street and walked down worn, stone steps down to a short gangway that lead to a building with Ischia carved into the stone wall. Inside the room was lit by candle light, casting a golden hue around the large room. Rather than feeling it was decorated for romance, the square tables with their white tablecloths gave it a homey atmosphere.
He knew he was right. And he supposed the sooner the better.
no big deal." He gave Draco's bare arse a pat. "Time for me to go before I start acting on the ideas I have for that bare arse."
This only heightened Hermione's hilarity, and she sat on the floor, her legs straight in front of her, bending over them as she laughed. It was such a delightful, unexpected sight that Pansy laughed, which set Draco off. The only one not laughing was Harry, and he stared around the room, shaking his head.
When Oliver called them back to the ground, Harry had managed to catch the Snitch only once. Even then, he felt pretty good about the try-out. After all, he'd held his own playing with a professional team and had managed to zip around the other Seeker and pluck the Snitch right out from under his nose.
. What a load of rot." His surprised expression amused her. "Oh, I'm sure you've figured out that warmer is a total loss. Not even a
Pansy scoffed. "Here," she said, waving her wand, "allow me. Jon is long gone." As she spoke the joggers and hoodie adjusted until they fit Draco quite nicely.
Draco nodded in agreement.
Darian's white teen flashed. "Yes, but my parents fought in the first war against Voldemort and were able to see what was coming. They put me in Muggle school, had me privately tutored in magic, and they sent me to my grandmother in the states once the rumours that Voldemort was back gained steam." He pulled some of Harry's hair out between his long, elegant fingers and used the razor with finesse and skill. "My dad worked at the Ministry back then, in Magical Games and Sports under Ludo Bagman. When he found out the first task included dragons, he got the family tickets. I was dragon mad back then, and Dad figured it was the only way I'd ever see one."
He'd just dropped off a wizard at the Leaky Cauldron, when
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. "Might I remind you, you also share my
"I do not nag." Hermione crossed her arms on her chest and huffed. "I
this afternoon and knew after the advisory board meeting, I'd need a reminder to tell you. The alarm going off just proves I am getting old and forgetful."
“Twil,” Deylon said softly. “Don’t make a scene. Please.”
Draco gave her a dark look. "Neither of us are exactly 'boys'.
"It's basically dedicated to the Black family tapestry. I hate the damned thing."
"If you value both your lives, Potter, you will leave now and return promptly. I will care for your mutt, but if he eats another shoe, I will not be responsible."
Her bright laugh filled the room. "Just because I spent most of my time worried about what a wanker Ron was being, doesn't mean I didn't have eyes. Come on, Harry. You know it was there. Although I suppose at the time you were generally too busy trying to kill each other to notice, but you two positively sizzled."
"I wouldn't have been annoyed at you asking for food, you ninny!"
"You were defending my honour, as your on again, off again spouse," Darian said, spreading his hand on his chest, but his expression was amused. "I was touched." He dropped his hand and snatched Harry's last piece of toast from his plate, taking a dainty bite. "By the way, I think Adam has a bit of a thing for you. It's really too bad you don't remember the body shots. Watching you sucking tequila out of his navel was a good time for all."
"In what way? As I recall, she was far more 'daddy's girl' than Daphne was." She sat with her long legs encased in dark capri's and crossed beneath her, her black flats sitting on the carpet near the legs of her chair. She was painting her fingernails blood red, and the smell permeated the room.
Now as I look into your eyes
Draco shrugged. "I suppose there is that. To continue… cooking doesn't take all day, so I also spent some time trying to decide what I'd do once I had money. There's nothing quite like having absolutely nothing to convince you to find a vocation that pays, even if your only previous experience is being decorative."
!" His voice had risen to a shout. "You've said it often enough yourself: I like cock. I do not like fanny."
Astoria sniffled and looked up at Draco. He gave a smile he hoped looked supportive. "That sounds like a very good idea. Come along, Astoria." He helped her up from the chair. "Let's get you settled and then we can discuss a name for our beautiful daughter."
"In the matter of attempting to kill Albus Dumbledore, we find you not guilty. In the matter of assisting the Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, we find you not guilty, due to the extreme duress you were placed under. In the matter of joining forces with Voldemort and causing pain and suffering to Muggles, we find you guilty. In the matter of assisting the Death Eaters to hold prisoners in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, we find you guilty." The Chief Warlock lowered the parchment he was reading to look directly at Draco.

"Oh no, you're not getting me in on this," Harry said. He turned to Deon. "I will tell you that Ginny and George will be relentless in making certain you
"I hear that," Peterson muttered. "This is brutal."
that nearly kept Malfoy from keeping his promise to this young boy. He really didn't even know why Malfoy was here or what he'd helped this Toby with, but he was feeling a bit of an arse for delaying Malfoy's arrival.
Pansy was quiet, settling back in the chair. Her foot bounced up and down, and she looked thoughtful. "When you put it that way, I see your point. But don't you think it's quite unfair of you not to at least listen to Astoria's side of the story? Maybe she really doesn't want to go through with the arrangement." She shrugged. "Or maybe she does. At any rate, you're not being fair to either of you if you don't at least meet with her." She paused for a brief moment. "You won't be a Muggle forever, you know, and when you go back to the wizarding world you might want a charming, lovely
"Oi, back off, MacTavish," one of Appleby's newest players, Connor said. "Don't be so sore cuz he can fly circles around you."
"Merlin's balls, woman," he said, affecting a snide tone that might allow both of them to reclaim their dignity, "these may not be my things but I'd appreciate your not getting snot all over them!" Draco gave her a squeeze and a kiss on the cheek. "Now that's enough Hufflepuff for tonight."
her dads." He elbowed through the crowd and stopped at the door. "Oh for cripes sake! Let them through or I'll have the staff send you all home with no news at all!"
"It's almost comical when you're viewing the world as a Muggle, how much magic can interfere with life. But then I don't suppose Grand-mère Malfoy anticipated I'd have to live as a Muggle at all, let alone until I was nearly thirty."
Astoria took the baby from Draco and followed Philippe's instructions, before sliding into the seat next to the carrier. "You can sit in the front with Philippe, Draco. I know it's not very far but we'd be cramped with another adult back here. Oh, I can't wait to get home and see the nursery!"
"And what, Pans? Just say it."
When he found the little salon on Appleby's main thoroughfare, he was pleasantly surprised. He supposed he'd been expecting something like the shop Aunt Petunia went to with the weird plastic chairs in front of those old-fashioned dryers that made women look like astronauts and the astringent smell of permanent solution. When he'd been a kid and he was often forced to accompany Petunia to weekly 'beauty appointments', the stench had made his eyes water. What he walked into could not have been more different.
"Oy!" Ron called out. "Get a room!"
Harry smiled. "Hmmm, let me check my schedule." He made the motion of flipping through pages of an invisible calendar. "Well, Ms Granger, it's your lucky day. My schedule seems to be free this evening."
"But isn't he older than you are?" Hermione said. "By quite a bit?"
She all but ran to them, turning the knob and pushing them open. Draco let loose a soft cry when he saw that his waiting room was undisturbed.
"Oh I'm sure the Ministry will make an exception this one time." She shrugged her shoulders. "How can they possibly refuse you the right to be present at the birth of your child? Just go talk to them." She sat back as if it was all settled.
He rubbed his chin, pretending to be in thought. "Ah, yes, now how was it you so accurately, if indelicately, put it? I recall—because I'm
"I'll see you tomorrow, Astoria. Sleep well." Draco hung up and sat staring at the phone. Astoria would be the easy one in that group to convince. Simone and Walden were going to be more difficult, but they'd never

Darian leaned over, reaching up to shift Harry's fringe out of his eyes. "First thing, we're going to deal with
She clapped Harry on the shoulder and exited through the dim shop's front door, and Rob made a sound of disgust.
"I have my moments."
Darian shrugged. "Because we'd rather stay friends. We're much better at it."
"You don't think they've noticed, do you?" Harry asked Darian.
There were trainers rushing out onto the field and Harry saw a player lying on the ground beneath the rings at their end of the pitch.
Draco stiffened. "I don't know what you mean."
He took and released a few breaths as Darian counted slowly. When the rapid beeping had slowed and fallen silent again, Harry spoke. "Tell me what happened. At the game, I mean. I remember..." he stared into Darian's eyes, "I remember your face…"
"Fair enough," Charlie said. "Let's get you settled. You okay bunking with us?"
"They're going to instantly know I'm a fraud," he said, staring at the listed grades in horror. "I can fake some things, Pans. I imagine I could pass for straight if I put my mind to it…"
"I remember," Hermione said. "The clause about injury severance was
"Like I'm going to let you loose, out there alone."
"Mrs. Erminmeister," he said, blushing helplessly. "Now I have to worry about you checking my…beam." She grinned.
"What?"
"Gee thanks for the boost. We gonna play or are you going to lecture me until it gets dark?"
"It's a fairly straightforward question and I'd like to know your answer."
button a moment, before pressing it and waiting.
… how Harry's smile stopped just short of his usual brilliant one, the crease between his brows that didn't leave, and the one that told Draco it was time to leave; the muscle above Harry's left eye would twitch, ever so slightly, when he spoke.
"I will let you go with me on one condition; you will not, under any circumstances, repeat it to the Slytherin cadre. If you do, I will not be forgiving. And you know just how very sorry I can make you; am I clear?"
"I certainly hope so, Pansy, I'm about to trust my future to him." He took a deep breath, studying her earnest face. "If you trust him, then I'll just have to."
"Have you done anything to make that place more welcoming? More like your home?"
Harry put his cup back in the saucer. "After that revolting sentence set down by the Ministry, against which I should have fought harder," Draco opened his mouth and Harry held up his hand, "No. I should've. We all should have; it wasn't right. They were punishing you for having a shitty father, pardon my bluntness."
"Good," Draco urged. "Do it."
Pansy followed with her plate and laughed as she handed it to Draco. "And he even does the dishes."
"Get in line, Potter."
Harry grinned and patted him on the shoulder. "That would be excellent." The next day, he let Hagenstack teach him what he already knew. He happened to catch sight of Preston watching them after practice and was afraid he'd made himself look like the weaker flyer. That was, until Fergus gave him a slight smile and a nod before turning away, as if he knew exactly what Harry was doing. Harry hoped so, at least.
Pansy laughed. "Is it somehow better if she isn't? It's not like you know what you're doing."
He was about to flip to the last page, when a number caught his attention. He blinked several times, quite certain he was seeing things. Hermione's gasp told him he'd not read it wrong.
method today.
Draco gave one self satisfied nod. "Good. Then I don't have to tell Mummy how much little Pansy has convinced Daddy to add to her trust fund in the last six months."
Draco rolled his eyes before gaining his composure. "I'll have someone bring it in to you shortly."
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry on the cheek. "You do to me."
He climbed back up the stairs, falling into his seat and pulling the door closed behind him. Pausing for a long moment just to breathe in air that didn't burn his lungs, he was startled by a thermos that sat next to the controls on the dash.
Harry blinked. "That's not what I meant. Merlin, I just meant that I'd not realized how big it was inside and how well equipped it is."
"Don't, Draco, I can see when I'm not wanted. I just hope you remember who's carrying your precious heir."
Harry stood. "I completely agree. Come on, I'll walk you to the Leaky. We can both Floo from there."
Harry smiled, watching as the tips of Draco's ears turned a lovely shade of pink. "Yes, you did. You sniffed me? What's that about?"
As a group they headed outside, Draco's arm wrapped firmly around Astoria. He allowed Simone to get in the cab first. He turned Astoria to him and kissed her gently on the lips. She gave a soft gasp and touched her lips. He felt as if he'd kissed a sister, but she clearly had different thoughts. He didn't like manipulating her, and felt a bit guilty. Until Astoria whispered, "Thank you for today, Draco. I hope we can do it again." She smiled at him from beneath her lashes, "Maybe next time without Mummy."
"Yeah, that." Darian frowned. "Toujurs Pur…
"What did she do to make you treat her this way?" Draco asked.
rush over him, followed by the distinct scent of lemons.
Draco covered his face with one hand, laughing weakly. "Not particularly." He reached down into the pocket of his coat, withdrawing the ragged scarf and putting it between them on the table. "You dropped it," he whispered, "the day of my trial. I tried to call you back, but you were already gone." He sighed. "That's not entirely true. You weren't that far off yet—I don't know why I kept it, but…" He rested his hand on it. "It's been a comfort to me, more than once. Obviously." He shrugged sheepishly. "And if you think it's weird…"
Harry could see Draco's jaw tighten and the cup in his hand slowly crush, but to his credit, he didn't retort.
Harry's hand slowly caressed his abdomen, moving ever so slowly towards the thatch of hair that led under the towel to nirvana, his fingers twisting in the dark hair. The towel slipped a bit and Draco could see dark curls springing around the top of the towel. Draco was torn. Should he make himself known, along with his wish to suck Potter dry or should he stay quiet and enjoy the show?
"No," Draco grinned, "but I do make an excellent one." He stood and crossed to Pansy, holding out his hand. "If you'll join me in the kitchen, I'll show you that I was quite an exceptional student and learned to make more than a cheese toastie."
Charlie laughed and turned to Harry. "Harry, this is Deon. Deon, Harry Potter."
In the final analysis, after hours of discussion and a viewing of Darian's memory in a Pensieve, Harry kept his job. It was thanks entirely to Darian and his memory, and his concise and eloquent description of what happened when Skeeter and her photographer cornered Harry behind a pool table. But it was a near thing, and Harry didn't fool himself. It really could have gone either way.
Stricken, heart sinking, Draco nodded tightly then caught Philippe's eyes over the top of her head. 'Get her out of here,' he mouthed to Philippe, who acknowledged his words with a slight nod.
"Which is Healer speak for
"No," Draco repeated. "You did not. I will not force Astoria to live as a Muggle. It may sound like some sort of… adventure to her and she may think it's easy, but it is not. And I will not do one single thing to risk this sentence not ending in six years. I can't, and I won't."
"I won't. I promise."
"You've asked around?" He wasn't surprised that she'd checked into it; frankly, he'd have been surprised if she hadn't.
He gave it to her before he thought better of it, then watched in consternation as she banished the glass and the overwhelming scent currently filling his loo, only to replace the slivers of dark glass with a brand new, unopened bottle of the pricey cologne. "Pansy," he protested.
Astoria looked a bit helplessly to her mother, chewing nervously on her lower lip.
Harry stood staring into his wardrobe, finally pulling out an old brown sweater. He was just about to pull it over his head, when Draco hurried into their bedroom.
"Fucks sake, Beecham," the shorter, square-shouldered Auror said, pulling Beecham away from Draco as he ordered him to sit. "What the fuck you thinking?"
"I know the basics, and I don't care if she makes comparisons," Draco said darkly. "I just don't want to be responsible for
how many times before? He's left a trail of broken hearts from here to Cardiff. Is it wrong I don't want my son to be the next one?"
Harry reached back teasingly and squeezed Darian's arse. "And it's a nice arse."
Draco arched a brow. "Oh."
Windbarm cleared his throat. "But one of our entries truly shined above the others. Please join me in congratulating… Toby Burgess with his inspired way to save a potion ingredient that might have otherwise been lost to us!"
"Even from you? Why?"
"Bitch," Draco hissed as they were being led to their table. "I do not smell like a baby, for fuck's sake. And if I did, it wouldn't be that terrible. I'm a father. I have a baby." His tone became defensive. "And I like the way Clare smells, all clean and fresh."
Harry pulled Draco back in, singing softly in his ear.
—the ones that Ron and Hermione didn't know personally. It was best to wait until after he'd met him, and he at least had some concrete details to be grilled over.
"It's a total lie, I know," Harry said. "I just can't figure out why."
Harry put his hand over Draco's on the table. It was warm, and it grounded him in a way few things had before. To have the scarf beneath it, and Harry's hand on top of it, was pretty much the most protected he'd felt since he'd been in his mother's arms. "The same way that you've been denied it for ten years."
"Did you go to Hogwarts?" Harry asked, finding the blue eyes in the mirror. Or, he thought he did. He couldn't see a hell of a lot with his glasses sitting on Darian's station. The regret he was able to see on Darian's face told him he'd fucked up before he'd even started: was Darian a squib? "You are – a – wizard, right?"
Draco gave him a disbelieving look. "Liar."
"That's not what this is about Potter, and you know it." Oliver huffed. "Go hit the showers. Take that Malfoy look-alike you're 'not dating' and take some of your frustration out on his arse, or have him fuck some sense up yours. Whatever works, but have a change of attitude before you come back." There was no use telling Ollie that Darian wasn't his boyfriend, it wouldn't matter. Everyone thought he was, and the more Harry tried to deny it the worse it looks.
She looked positively stricken. "Harry, I don't think I truly understood until right now how much…" She stopped, biting her lower lip.
When they moved apart it was obvious Draco was as turned on as he was, if the erection pressing into his hip was any indication. They each rolled onto their back, breath uneven.
Heidi was old man Gardner's very adorable daughter, and Alfie was his twenty-something, extremely good-looking son. The old woman pushed laboriously to her feet.
"Yeah, he's going to be paying for that for a long time." Draco enjoyed the satisfaction in Harry's eyes. "Deciding to use you to get back at Robards was probably the dumbest thing he's ever done in his life. He's lucky Hermione was with me as witness; it kept me from kicking him square in the balls, which is what I wanted to do. Oh, and Beecham and Holden are paying, too. Gawain has been suspended without pay until Kingsley and the legal team can figure out what to charge him with, but Beecham and Holden got the sack."
His mind still in the past, Draco turned and stretched out on the cot. He pulled the excuse for a blanket over himself and fell into a fitful sleep filled with dreams.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, that might have made this a bit easier."
Harry nodded. "That makes total sense. I knew it had to be something like that; this criminal report was filed for revenge. Damn it!" Harry pushed to his feet and began to pace restlessly. "I want to know who the fuck ordered those two numpties to come after you."
"You know there isn't," Draco said, fighting his revulsion. "I'm licensed, I went to school. You know I run a legitimate business."
She took a deep breath. "Will you be disappointed if I'm not in Slytherin?"
"You left me here!" he shouted. "I've been here for days with barely any food while you've been off… off doing who knows what!" He flailed his arms in the air. "Dammit Pansy, can you think for one minute about someone other than yourself?"
Moments passed and finally the screen lit up.
"Do you know where he is?" he asked, checking to make sure Ron wasn't on his way back to the table. Her mirth faded, and she shook her head sadly.
She cut Draco off with the look she gave the class to stop their chatter. "Are you questioning my decisions, Auror-trainee Malfoy?" Her tone was chilly as a winter wind.
had been speculating wildly about his possible return to Quidditch, his now strained relationship with the Arrows, and lately, his whereabouts—today's article was more of the same.
." He scowled. "How utterly charming. What's all this?" He reached out and touched one of the blackened, burned places.
He wasn't going to be one of those people who sat around feeling sorry for themselves. He'd stopped enjoying playing Quidditch as it was. Maybe it was time to figure out what he
Harry curled into Draco's side and nodded. "I suppose I do. I guess I just needed to see them together. Not as kids, but as adults – living in their own place. It's pretty obvious, that Teddy loves James. But it was good to hear him say it all the same."
As promised, Draco and Philippe were waiting outside St Mungo's when it was time for Astoria and the baby to come home. Draco leaned against the bonnet of the car and anxiously willed them to step through the window of the ramshackle department store that was the entrance to the wizarding hospital. After what felt like hours, but was probably closer to fifteen minutes, Simone stepped onto the sidewalk, her hand on Astoria's elbow to steady her as she came cautiously through the barrier.
"For example," Harry said, pacing in front of the class. "One of the most effective spells a dueller can use is
Harry followed her, laughing all the way.
He stared at it sitting on the sofa while drinking coffee and watching telly, grateful for the rostered day off work.
"Family expectations," Draco said, leaning his hips back against the counter, studying her. There was one more thing she didn't know, and he had to tell her. It was only fair. And perhaps it would let them both out. "There is something… something personal I feel you should know. I, uhm…" He faltered briefly.
Draco pursed his lips tightly, knowing they must be nearly invisible, but he nodded."
Draco was startled, then laughed out loud and shook his head. "If you're willing to help we can go into the kitchen and see what we can pull together. And I know there's at least a few bottles of wine with our names on them."
Narcissa merely walked out, calling over her shoulder. "It would be best if you dealt with that now before the formula settles into the carpet. And do remember you're a wizard, and use your wand. A nice strong
Hermione chewed thoughtfully. "You know, Harry, you're going to have to go talk to Robards about what Beecham and Holden have done. In fact, I'm fairly certain he already knows and is wondering why his Deputy Head Auror hasn't been in to see him yet."
"Alright, then." Darian stood up and came around the bed. "Let's do this."
"So maybe you should ask him what you've done wrong, and see if you can agree to work things out once he tells you."
"Was I unclear?" Draco gave him a rough shake. "Disconnect it. Now."
"Tired." Harry admitted. "Sore."
"News," he provided, moving away from the settee to sit in one of two ecru armchairs that sat on either side of the fireplace. They were slashed, the stuffing mostly gone, but Draco figured repairing them wouldn't take much effort and they could both still be sat in. He used his wand to cast an
He paused in one of the wings, looking out onto the brightly lit stage. He could see several tables set up in a row behind a podium. He was about to take a step when he heard a young voice cry out.
Ellison snarled and started forward, but now it was his coach's turn to hold him back.
"Playing stupid won't save you this time," the man spat out with an evil smirk. "Now eat your food. I'll be back in five minutes to take you to piss and wash your face. Maybe we'll even give you time to do your hair." He walked away laughing like he thought he was hilarious.
Harry was slightly taken aback. "Oh, so now you've knocked me off the top spot, you remember about the game?"
"Draco?"
"Mum! Did you leave it alone?" Toby sounded horrified. Draco gripped his little shoulder in a large, reassuring hand.
"What are you doing here?"
"I find it so exciting," she said brightly, "to be riding around London like a Muggle." Her voice wasn't terribly loud, but Draco glanced around at the immediate vicinity to see if anyone gave her an odd look.
"No, you shouldn't. You've had them on all day; it won't kill you to keep them on for a few more minutes. Now, talk to me."
Pansy gave him an amused look. "You really are quite the drama queen."
Draco sighed heavily, crossing his arms and gripping his elbows. He was trembling in his core, and he hoped the man in front of him couldn't tell.
"Excellent," Pansy hugged Draco again. "I also want you to start thinking about what you're going to take from here when you leave. We have a place in mind for you to live and it comes furnished, but you can bring a few things you'd like to keep. Also, between your mother's and my mother's house-elves, the manor will be tended to periodically." She paused for a moment. "We'll have to get you more Muggle clothes, but that'll be easy."
"Are you kidding me?" Pansy shot back. "From the moment you rightfully tossed Walden Greengrass out on his large arse, I wouldn't be surprised if they've contacted a solicitor and are setting you up as an 'unfit' father."
She looked up at him from beneath her thick lashes, and he nodded before leaving the room.
Draco laughed softly. "It won't surprise you to know that's exactly what Mother said."
"It's a big place," he shrugged, feeling awkward. "I'm here alone and no one cares if I'm living in one room."
Draco moved both hands to Harry's shoulders, looking him in the eyes. "Don't do this if you're not sure. I'll stop right now and we'll be friends. But if this goes further than another kiss, I might not be able to pull back." He leaned his forehead against Harry's, his breath fast and shallow.
