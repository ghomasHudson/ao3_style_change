So, when his potion turned the same shade of navy blue with silvery whisps in it as Professor Snape example potion on his desk, Harry was quite pleased. The silver was a bit too muted in his which was a sign that he stirred too quickly while it was boiling, but overall a well made replica.
"Is that really all he owns? Half a bag of old clothes that dont fit? Im amazed you muggles survived this long if this is your idea of how to treat a small child. And speaking of small, he looks half starved. You two and that fat pig of a son are truely repulsive. Merlins beard you ought to be locked away for however long you have left." The blonde man said sneering with full force as he stared directly into Vernons eyes, like he was daring the man to deny it.
Hed have to ask Draco about the encounter later
"I see. While I fail to see how that's any business of his, I do appreciate the olive branch. If he agrees, I see no reason why we can't have a cease fire. And as for the other thing, um, how did you find out?" Harry asked his face red.
Even Malfoy, who was present, had his back facing him. The hot cereal, that he was already having trouble swallowing, now tasted more like glue than anything. So, with a heavy heart he decided to skip breakfast. He had a free period that morning and decided to go sit in the library. It was quieter there and he was more likely to have some time to himself there in a back corner somewhere.
Harry found himself taking a very long time to get dressed. He was not looking forward to going shopping today and was procrastinating.
The plan is revealed. Sort of.......... I may be making this too complicated..... Oh well, ONWARD!!!
Harrys nerves grew from there. At least Draco was sure of where he was going. Harry couldnt be sure.
The others silently agreed. Harry being shy was the main issue. Along with being good hearted in general. Not to mention he was just small for his age. Thus everyone felt the need to protect him.
He knew he had been manipulated. Honestly, Ron had a
"Oh Draco..." Pansys arms came around him. She was always a good friend, however snarky and over confident. A hug from her was rare, but always came when most needed.
Now, if Draco would just give him half the chance to do so.
He had waited for Draco to come to him, knowing the other boy needed to figure things out, and it paid off. Only a week into school, Draco came back saying he wasn't ready to mate (obviously) but they could at least attempt to be friends. That way, provided Charlus was right, the transition into being mates when Draco came of age, wouldn't be as jarring.
"Well that's lame. Class will be over by the time she gets back." Ron announced in a disappointed pout.
"Hello there, my boy. Might I see you in my office after dinner. There are a few things which we should discuss more privately." The headmaster said, that twinkle in his eye making Harry supremely uncomfortable.
still want to make things work between the three of them, but he also knew trust was important. They had tried to trust him, but his past became an issue, and when that trust ended they broke his. It had been a misunderstanding and he knew that, but trust had to be earned back on both sides.
Still, he felt like a bloody genius and the work he put into this nonsense that had somehow become his life made him feel extremely proud. He actually didn't feel like he suddenly needed his fathers approval. No, finally he knew what independence felt like and he would sell his very soul to keep it. That didn't mean he wanted his father dead though. No. His father also had a part to play in this little plan.
Draco just smiled back at her and nodded.
"Did you smell that Lucius? Potter has creature blood too. Can't tell what with the glamour but, it was so.... sweet. Like honeysuckle and mint. I will admit to distraction, but you are right. I will wait to inform Dumbledore, but you should inform the Dark Lord immediately." Severus agreed once he came back to himself.
Harry was sneaking through the corridors, sticking to the walls so as not to bump into anyone on the way to the dungeons.
Never had Draco found himself in a more humiliating or frankly awkward situation as the train ride to school.
It was enough to drive you mad on any day, but it was Dracos birthday for Circes sake. Just congratulate him and move leave well enough alone.
Harry waited a few moments before the teller returned another Goblin with him.
"How was it? Surely not as bad as all that?" Charlus asked curiously.
To put it simply, none of the three were easily messed with, and they were easily to be the most influential triad once officially mated.
One man was really tall, with long black hair and a sharp look to him all over. His clothes were all black and he seemed in a dour mood as it were. The other was only a bit shorter than the other with long hair that almost glowed silver. He was pale and seemed rather drawn back. He sneered at Petunia as she offered tea. The sneer almost seemed to darken the whole mans face just as him smiling fondly at Harry seemed to lighten it. These men were..... Odd.
"You may not believe me, but I understand. However, I know that you will get better. You just need your mates. They will be the key to healing." Of this Lucius was certain.
Harry made his way casually to the apparition and floo room. The room was lavish, but simple. It was designed with the purpose in mind. No carpets because of unavoidable soot, and enough space for several people to pop in without squishing or landing on top of each other. There was a coat rack that currently only held Harrys travel cloak, and a chiming clock above the large fireplace that could easily fit three or four people in it comfortably.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, go. Be careful. Worry not for tomorrow, I shall cancel your classes, just in case." Trust Dumbledore to make life easier for him. Now he could follow Harry the whole day without question.
Draco nodded before he said his goodbyes and left.
Speaking of Snape though, the man had been on his mind a lot lately. First off his whole demenor was different. He no longer sneered or talked down to him either. In fact, potions had been almost peaceful this year. For the first week it had Harry completely unbalanced as Snape hating him had been a constant that he had subconciously relied on to judge his own sanity.
It had been months before they had healed to any degree, and several more before they felt whole again.
"Correct, now, it is possible there may have been a few dealings with the primary account, but your magical guardian would have needed your express approval for it. So nothing should have been touched, but we will see when I bring up the files. This here is your new key. It is tied to your magical signature, so no one else will have access you your vaults, and all other keys have been retracted and no longer connect to your accounts. Now, this is the lordship ring. It goes on your right ring finger and will resize to fit you. It is spelled so no one can remove it, and in the case of your untimely demise, will be returned automatically to your primary vault until it can be claimed by another generation." Griphook passed an ornate box, far larger than a typical ring box, with the Potter seal emblazoned upon the top.
It was after tea time that Narcissa and Lucious had Draco down for a nap.
It wasnt long after that, that Draco went off the find their other firends. Harry agreed to wait and save the compartment for them.
"I'm sorry. My what? I don't remember filling out the paperwork for an emancipation." Harry asked as he followed Griphook to his office.
A large bed on one side. A dressor on the other. A desk by the window and a small bookshelf next to the desk.
"Alright, but I still don't know what to get you. Your house isn't nearly as obvious." Draco admitted.
"What do you mean? He's just a prat. Ignore him." Wood added.
Potter was an enigma that refused to explain itself. No one seemed to ever have the whole picture.
"Yes, I am." Severus answered with a questioning tilt in his voice. Silently asking for more details on whatever request she had.
Shopping was a different experience than anything Harry had ever seen before. Everyone was dressed in the same strange clothes as Snape was and the shops carried some of the strangest things that Harry couldn't even begin to name.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I plan to go tomorrow to the ministry. If I register that I have found my mates with you two then it would be completely illegal for Albus to intervene. If he tries anyway then we can leave. Draco you were planning to finish your education at home anyway. Worst comes to be, Harry will join you and you take your exams at the ministry. It would of course be up to you two." Severus added.
"I want to know who it was that jixed his broom as soon as I get back. And not one foot will have left the ground until I get back from the hospital wing, am I clear!" Her words were a clear command and everyone else nodded assent.
Harry was confused. Stone? Master? He assumed that by Master and Lord that they were referring to Voldemort. Oh, yes, Harry had heard the story before. Severous told him all about what had really happened to his birth parents. How after hearing an incomplete prophesy, the Dark Lord had tried to take Harry but ended up nearly killing him. A killing curse rebounded and destroyed his body. And while his body was gone Lord Voldemort had found a way to come back.
"My magical inheritance included a creature inheritance. I'm a hybrid though. Half dark veela and half dark pheonix. I got wings and horns. It was quite the change to get used to. I'm surprised your father didn't tell you. Grandfather and I explained it to him when he came to visit that one time." Harry explained.
I kinda feel bad for Lucious after this
"I wish we didnt have to take the train. Father said its a right of passage or whatever, but it will take forever." Draco complained, knowing Harry was likely stuck in his head after facing that many people.
And Lucious, the Slytherin that he was, took off for the ministry with Severous in tow. If they were to save the boy they would do so without giving anyone any legal loophole to put the child back in that blasted muggle house.
A few weeks into the school season.... Harry is still befudled by the strange behavior the Slytherins have been showing. What was Malfoy up to now?
"I will be happy to accept your generosity of course. The time is perfect. Good day Mr. Potter." Malfoy senior walked away after that and while Draco remained silent, there was a curious light in his eyes as well as he looked Harry over almost approvingly.
"State your name and business." The goblin at the booth grumbled at him.
He didn't notice Draco eyeing him sadly as he left, nor the looks of worry from the twins, Neville, and Luna. And he didn't feel the small knut sized spider that jumped onto his school bag.
Lucius and Severus both apperated out to Malfoy manor.
So Lucious made a proposal.
Draco was, apparently, tired of watching him flounder.
Lucious understood his friend well and knew he wanted an excuse to check on Lilys son but wisely never mentioned it. He found the tenacity rare in the strict man Severous had become and wasn't sure why it was disturbing.
I totally realized while writing this that I don't write British slang very well. This should be interesting
Who was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.
Draco was excited about his many gifts. Harry had actually gotten his friend a little snake charm for a bracelet that matched Harrys as they exchanged charms on their birthday every year. It even hissed.
"I have been trying to get through to both Wood and Minerva to get them to cut down on practice. Neither will hear it from me. I was going to be speaking to Madam Pomfrey tonight about it. This is entirely too unhealthy for an eleven year old boy, and I will have that drilled into their heads one way or another. There's more than inexperience keeping first years from being on the primary team for a reason." Sev informed his godson.
Life is ever changing.
"Yes right over there, just as before. You will write, I must not tell lies and I will obey authority. I will let you know when you may stop." Umbridge said as she motioned for Harry to sit.
"So, what, you think I'm a liar too do you? You don't think I would tell you what was wrong if I knew? That I wouldn't tell my mates what would help me? You really think that little of me?" Harry was obviously angry and was more than a bit hurt by the assumption.
"Unfortunately I will be busy today. However, I am free tomorrow afternoon, if you would like to come by the manor for tea. Would around 2 o'clock work for you?" Harry extended the invitation. Harry knew he was out of his depths here and would prefer to play host than guest. He hoped that was subtle enough.
This comment had gotten a small laugh from Harry, who was surprised to feel a sense of relief. Lucius had kept his word.
With this less hostile Snape, Harry was left wondering if he had finally snapped and was hallucinating.
That said, maybe Lucius would be there. The man had garnered some kind of tentative friendship with the boy, so maybe he would have some idea about what to do about Harrys predicament.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Please have a seat. The elves were particularly excited to have their first guest, so I hope it's not too much." Harry said with a small willful smile.
"I knew something was different right away that day at the bank although there is a specific way for a vampire to sense their mate. Your blood sings to me. It was a matter of time before one of the knives slipped. You should sharpen your set by the way. Also, it pays for to be the best friend of your other mates father. Lucius finds it hilarious that I ended up mated to both of my godsons." Snape said , his eyes rolled upward in exasperation.
"Arther! Dear we have unexpected company!" Molly called out, heading into the place like she owned it.
"Got you now!
Harry then shrunk down everything he owned and placed them in his pockets before draping the invisibility cloak on and sneaking out the portrait hole.
"Your first year this corridor was off limits due to what the headmaster hid here. Normally though this is the family wing. It is used for visiting families from over seas or when members of the board visit the castle. Families like being able to visit for holidays or birthdays and have somewhere to spend the night before heading home the next day. As you can see, it's much cleaner now than it was back then." Lucius pointed out.
"All the more reason to leave. If we are registered as mates, Dumbles will likely use the two of you against me to force my hand. We need out from his clutches, and I have nothing here for me anymore except the two of you anyway. For now I will remain neutral." Harry declared.
"Draco, we never followed our parents. If you're switching sides, we are too. We stick together. We follow you, not Snake Face." Blaise announced seriously.
Harry fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow. He was still a bit weak from the healing sleep and then the anxiety and stress of running away was enough to see him out like a light.
He had quickly packed, but stopped to transfigure copies of everything he owned and placed the copies where the items were normally.
Hagrid was an excellent distraction.
Professor Severus Tobias Snape, the youngest potions master ever in Great Britain, and spy in the war with the Dark Lord Voldemort, was taking out his frustration on every single gryffindor student whose name passed his desk.
So when Narcissa Black Malfoy, in her stunning gown and robes with perfect hair and a look of determination on her face, took her son by the hand and marched up to the Weasleys to proclaim,
"Well Ive heard Father rant about them often enough and since they're purebloods, he feels obligated to invite them to events at the manor so Ive seen them, though its rare. If you weren't such a wallflower youd likely have noticed them by now yourself but you always vanish as quickly as you can at events." Draco answered. Well that makes sense, besides, if they hated each other it was likely the Weasleys very rarely attended and likely not in such a large crowd either.
"You called for me, my Lord." Severus greeted, sweeping into a practiced bow.
"As if. You lot have been in Slytherin for generations. If you're not wearing green the day after sorting, I'll swallow the darn charm myself." Harry said confidently.
Meeting with Malfoy Senior, and of course DUMBles tries something. It's Dumbles after all. He's always trying something.
"I have been perfectly safe at home. Now if you want to stand there and lecture air be my guest, but I am going to finish my shopping so I can return home." Harry stated in such a way as to say he was done with the entire exchange.
"Yes, Mr. Potter. You'll be writing lines. I have set up a desk just there with the parchment and quill set out for you. You'll be writing 'I must not tell lies' until I believe the message has sunk in." The woman spoke as if he were a toddler and it really grated on his nerves, but never the less Harry sat down at the small desk indicated.
There was also a basement but Mr. Snape said he had potions ingredients down there and that Harry should steer clear as while nothing down there was poisonous or even remotely harmful, it was still dangerous and should be left alone.
Harry nodded morosely. He had to admit that he agreed. He would prefer Voldemort killing him over the idea or Dumbledore somehow forcing his compliance.
"If I've been emancipated, then can I use magic freely now? With discretion around my muggle relatives not withstanding." Harry asked hopefully.
"But Harry, if with what happened it isn't safe by yourself." Hermione, who had apparently either been there or just joined them, added in her 'Im smarter so do as I say' tone.
Knowing Harry as I now do, and keeping in mind that I still don't know him very well on a personal level, I believe yours and Dracos lack of trust in his words will likely have him feeling quite rejected. I am sure I don't need to remind you what happens within a few days of a veela being rejected do I?" Lucius' words were carried by a weight that Severus knew too well.
"You can't be serious. You mean to tell me a boy the same age as my own son, is being hunted by both sides of a war he had no choice but to participate in? Has Albus gone mad!" Lucius replied.
Harry was glad for his inner Slytherin coming out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had to agree a bit. He hated the idea of being a weakness for Harry. The very idea made him feel a bit ill.
Harry had never before found himself in a situation like the one he was in.
"Mr. Potter. Come with me please." Professor McGonagall called out over the other students.
Draco looked to him. Potter had this stupid mirthful look on his face that instantly irritated and stunned him at the same time. It kind of reminded him of Dumbledore for a moment. The old git must be rubbing off on Potter.
"Malfoy." Harry replied back.
"Oh good, you are both here. Do you have everything you need? Both of you?" Severus asked, his voice was calm and soothing, as if they weren't running for Harrys life here.
(See the end of the chapter for
at my birthday party." Draco commanded, grabbing Harry by the hand and dragging him along to begin mingling.
That left him with his most likely option.
Now, Harry wouldn't ever judge someone for choosing to decorate with their favorite color, but this was.... well it just shouldn't.
"So, whats it like having a death eater like Snape as a dad?" Ron asked, a sneer on his frekled face.
"Ok then, I will be reclaiming the Potter seat, and would like, after this conversation, for all mail and such regarding my accounts to be redirected there from here on out. I will be investing on my own after a while but would like to, at present, continue with anything still active from my grandfathers time. Anything we don't cover today can be sent to my new or rather my proper home. Also, is there a glamour or something for the horns and wings until I get the hang of it myself. I notice most creatures use one." Harry added.
"Mom!" "Not ok!" The twins for once had different statements though still spoke in synch. Percy was silently horrified and likely trying to remember why he had agreed to be there at all. Ron and Hermione however were glaring at Harry and the Malfoys.
so I'm working in slightly shorter chapters but it is kind of a thing.
Harry hung his head and followed, sure he was going to dread the detention that was surely coming his way.
"Will you SHUT UP! I have heard you rant and complain and belittle the people I care about since school started and I am done. Learn some respect for others you ignorant Weasel!" Harry blurted almost shouting.
Harry suddenly remembered the other student he had heard the rumors about her detentions from. A little first year girl who was trying to tell their prefect what had happened.
This crazy bitch was actually making the students write lines in their own blood!?
Molly, bless the woman, was only stunned for a brief moment before coming back to herself and yet still couldnt come up with a proper response.
"Draco Malfoy." The blonde walked up confident and proud as always.
Harry sat alone for about twenty minuets before the door opened and he was greeted by red hair and a rat.
"Not that I have noticed. If someone is attacking the students as a whole, then it would be likely for Harry to get caught in the middle. None of the Slytherin students would dare lie to me about such things, and it is common knowledge that I have every one of my students examined at the beginning and end of every semester." Severus answered. He was personally responsible for ending the abuse of several of the Slytherin students in his tenure as head of house. He had no qualms about refusing to send a child home if they were being abused.
Harry couldn't believe that this was the same man that tried to kill him in second year. It was almost comforting.
The minister nodded and the relief on his face was evident.
"Alright, I trust you. I can not wait to see you again this winter for yule. I'll have the elves put up a real traditional holiday. I know you will have social obligations by then and won't be here for the whole break, but for yule itself it will be nice to have you here and relax. Tell me everything that happens when you get back. Hold your own Grandson." Charlus wasn't the type to say the words but that was the closest to 'I love you and goodbye' as he was likely to get.
Both boys contemplated this information. Severus was right, of course. There were laws that protected them as mates. And while both Harry and Draco both came from actively prominent families, they could not leave out that Severus was the acting lord of the Prince line, only recently died out when Severus' mother ran away and married a muggle.
"But they aren't here, are they? I've been abandoned again, haven't I?" If it were at all possible, Harry actually looked even more forlorn.
"I don't believe we were ever on different sides per say. You sided with keeping your family alive. And while I don't have family, I do have an interest in surviving this war. That said, if what you wanted originally was the promise to reform the wizarding world and bring back our traditions and culture, then all you need to do, is stay alive to see it. I don't care for Voldemort, but if we restore his soul into one piece, you may get back the true leader he once was. All I need is the horcruxes. You may have better leads to figure out what they are than I do, and Dumbledors lessons are next to useless. By the time I get everything out of him, I'll be older than Merlin." Harrys words dawned on the potions master and the aristocrat.
"One moment please, I will need to fetch Griphook for you. He handles all the Potter and Evens accounts, and since the tournament is over, will need to forge you a new key." The teller announced, surprising him. Harry nodded to the goblin, who promptly took off down one of the many hallways.
Severus nodded at her in thanks before leaving. He would send Draco to the hospital wing to watch over Harry first. Then he would package up the quill and still wet parchment to Lucius. Then he had to speak to the headmaster and report to the Dark Lord. All before he could return to his young mates side. He didn't think Harry would take it well if he awoke before he returned.
What are you doing? Why aren't you with your family? You shouldn't live alone. Tell us where you are. Speak to the headmaster.
If this was the first day of the year, then the rest was sure to be an absolute mess. Ugh. He was already tired.
The outfit was a dark blue set of robes. Fairly simple in design, as children clothes often were, and they actually fit rather than just hanging off him. It somehow made him appear even smaller and yet Harry was exstatic. A brand new, never worn before, outfit just for him.
"Thats of course fine, but I should still tidy up Snape estate and just move us there. The house I'm in now is too small to add a child anyway. I can keep my potions work where it is and Harry will be closer to the manor that way regardless. Merlin knows I would never anger your wife." Severous agreed readily.
It was well into the school year and Professor Umbridge was quite pleased with herself, even if she did have a lot still to do.
"You, you can't do this. This is kidnapping. I will have you destroyed for this. Do you hear me Snape?" The woman ranted. Snape simply ignored her. He stunned her before obliviating her of the entire detention. She wouldn't know what had happened during this detention any more than Harry had known about the previous ones. All part of Snapes brand of justice served.
"I have no desire to anger Minerva. That said no first year needs to be playing on the team. The reserve team maybe but not the regular teams." Sev continued. Harry merely rolled his eyes only to receive a swat to his head.
Still both adults were pleased when the young lord obediently sipped at the broth he had been given and then dutifully knocked back the healing potion.
"Professor Umbridge, I must speak with you." That was Severus' voice.
"I'm sure they have outdone themselves. I look forward to your hospitality. That said we can drop the pretense. We are the only ones here and it is clear that niceties are still painful for you." So Lucius had picked up how uncomfortable the small talk was. For all that his slytherin side was coming out, Harry was still a gryffindor, and it was hard to not just get to the point and figure out what Lucius had wanted to talk to him about.
What she had witnessed so far however was a young man who was respectful if not dismissive, and who had been unargumentative the entire time he was around her.
"Oh Harry I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. You were so obviously ill and I felt so helpless not knowing how to aid you. I know it is no excuse, but please, I only wish to help you now." Severus spoke in a soft, deep voice that despite everything caused Harry to calm a bit.
"Harry Potter? Like THE Harry Potter. Do you have the, you know, the scar?" Ron was practically whispering when he finished.
"He is a child! He doesn't know what's best for him. He needs to be somewhere safe." Molly tried to argue.
My Grandfather explained to your father that if you could sense the change in my aura, then you are likely my mate. More specifically, the sub of the pheonix, though that won't mean much until we are both of age. However, with the marriage contract between our families, and with me being a bearer, I guess that works out really." Harry told Draco the shortened version, not really wanting to delve into that conversation after Charlus decided to talk to Harry about everything in excrutiating detail. Harry nearly blushed just at the memory.
It did pay of course to have the minister as a drinking companion. Close enough for favors and powerful enough to maybe, lets say, get a hold of the final will and testiment of one Lily Potter.
Second problem Harry was faced with was the wizengamot. Harry had a seat for the Potter family and was obligated now to fill it. However, most of the dates for the meetings clashed with his schooling, and he wouldn't likely be taken seriously until after he graduated anyway, emancipated or not. This meant he needed a proxy. He needed someone he trusted to vote in his interest.
Channel the part of himself that had watched Malfoy do exactly that for so long.
Once the room was completely empty, Harry looked up to see Snape watching him.
Ginny, Hermione, and entertainingly enough Pansy, all ship it.
They introduced themselves and Harry, who decidedly remained a bit behind Mr. Snape as the silver haired boy just stared at him.
He would need to find a way to destroy or merge them.
Harry reflects on everything.
"Not that it's anyone's business, but last I checked, I was emancipated and didn't need a babysitter. And since I literally
OK, so a lot happened here. Hope you guys like it. It actually took a while to come up with an idea for how the legal system would work, so I kind of combined the voting process with the supreme court and added a little fantasy to make it work. Hope you guys like it. Leave a comment and let me know.
The Slytherins were more reserved. For now.
"Yes, and you'll finish it all followed by this healing potion and I'll need to redress the bandages on your hand. There were no permanent damages to the muscles or tendons in your hand luckily, but it likely will leave a nasty scar." Madam Pomphrey interjected after Lucius promptly failed to make Harry feel any better. Now Poppy didn't blame young Harry of course, or Lucius, it was a nasty business all around.
Yes Dracos 11th birthday, the last before he started at Hogwarts and was undeniably sorted into Slytherin. Harry understood the milestone as in about 3 weeks he would hit the same milestone.
"Yes, and how is young Potter. I've heard he is not well. Have you learned anything about this?" Why would the Dark Lord care about that?
It was also no secret that the Weasley family supported Harry Potter and the effort to put an end to Voldemort once and for all. And they did so with religeous, classic red head tenacity and boldness.
She also got Harry a new quill set with proper metal tips. The maker was American as well. Apprently the tips would last longer than the feather and could be fitted on new ones as well. Pansy showed him how easy it was to write with them and indeed his usual chiken scratch was much more legible as the metal tip glided on the paper much easier than regular quill tips did.
Once at the front Harry noticed a stool and there on it sat the sorting hat. Harry watched in fascination as the old beat up wizards hat started singing of all things. Sev had said before that the thing was obnoxious and that no hat should be able to talk no matter who it belonged to or what enchanted it.
Now Harry was the one snickering as Draco sent him warning glares that Harry valiantly ignored.
With his budding friendship with Draco and the growing relationship that had started to bloom between them and Severus, Harry hadn't felt lonely in a while, yet now he couldn't help but notice that he had no more friends to talk to about this. The Gryffindores didn't talk to him on Rons insistence, and the other houses generally ignored him regardless.
Lucius gave them both a meaningful look that promised pain should they fail to fix the problem. And it was with a promise to return to Harry that Lucius dutifully left while otherwise ignoring his best friend and son.
"Sorry? You're sorry. That's all you can say?! Not one of your so called friends have seen or heard from you outside of class in over a week and all you can come up with to say is 'sorry'. We were beginning to really get worried but its only quittich practice. Surely not since no one in their right mind would run an 11 year old for more than an hour or two. And yeah you may have made the team but surely the people who have been your family since you were four is more important than a sport team you weren't supposed to be able to join yet anyway. Though clearly I am mistaken." Draco ranted.
Well they had heard enough.
If only the problems had ended there.
"At the moment you magical guardian gave his permission for you to be entered into the tournament he had waved his rights as guardian. It is standard for the winner of the tournament to be emancipated as part of the reward for winning, if the champion was underage. That was part of the old rules and still was legally and magically binding. Therefore, Magic sought to give you all of your inheritances as soon as your hand gripped the cup. This included your latent creature inheritance. It is possible that without the tournament magic, you might have never manifested your creature side, but it wouldn't have manifested at all if the blood wasn't there by more than 20%.
"Come in." He voice would always grate on his nerves.
He always seemed to be leaving the library as Harry walked in, or wouldn't meet Harry's eyes during meals, or even taunt him over quittich, which had always left Harry motivated to try his absolute best. It was a shame really because now, Harry didn't even really want to play at all.
It had been a very long time since Lucious had gone a night without his wife beside him, though with Draco being their only child (Cissa not being able to have more) he didn't blame her. Dracos state didn't escape his notice any more than it likely escaped his wifes, and she was prone to making rash decisions if she though it would make him happier.
"Don't know honestly. You?" Harry asked, trying to be polite but also very uncomfortable.
Before he could even reply though, Draco was already stomping away.
Soon it was time for bed though. Harry had eaten more than he thought was possible and was tired. Besides apparently there was shopping to do tomorrow.
"Yes sir." Harry said chuckling.
Sorting ceremony time. Where to put Mr Potter? Only one way to find out. Lets get to it then.
"Just had to get it in about my manners. I am sorry by the way. I should have made more of an effort to learn how this world works, rather than assume it is the same as in the muggle world. That was my mistake. And now, I fear, I am paying for it." Harry said genuinely. He wanted, for some reason, for this man to understand him.
Now he had to face the Dark Lord alone.
"I didn't know all this was here." Harry said, mostly to himself.
"Where ya goin Mister Potter?" The driver, Harry couldn't quite remember his name, asked.
His Aunt had been absolutely livid. She ran his arm under ther water and then promptly locked him in his cupbard, arm still bleeding and now wet also. He had no idea how he did these strange things but he knew it was bad. He just wished he knew how to stop it.
So if Dumbledore wanted him dead, there must be a reason. The only thing that needed to be destroyed in order to kill Voldemort once and for all were the horcruxes. Dumbledore told him all the way back into second year that Voldemort left a piece of himself in Harry when he failed to kill him as a baby.
Well as he cried from the pain, a jar smashed into pieces with no warning or obvious cause.
Harry was slowly and quietly making his way down to the dungeons.
No seriously, comment below and let me know i didnt just ruin one of the most famous moments from the original books... Like please just tell me.
"If I have to go fly despite the stupid thing not rising an inch or more off the ground when I say 'up' hen you, who did so on the first try, are not missing it. Nervous or not." Hermione said, a hand on her hip and everything.
or you Malfoy." With that Harry left Snapes office and headed back to his dorm where neither Slytherin was invited to follow him.
"No need to be an arse, Malfoy." Ron insulted, not thrilled with the whole situation.
"No, he only mentioned what was spoken about in regards to the wizengamot. He said everything else was shared in confidence and he wouldn't say a thing unless you mentioned he could. He said it was a matter of honor. He practically danced at that alone." Draco must have been dying for answers since then. Which explained why he was here alone long before even getting to Hogwarts.
I dont like the Dursleys either but their appearace is short no matter how unpleasant.
Draco felt infinitely better than he had in a long time. Sure there were some kinks to his plan, but that was inevitable regardless.
Then she write a letter to Dumbledore. She pleaded he watch over Draco and to be cautious of the death eaters directly targeting him soon if Draco abandoned his mission as she hoped. And added a string of appologies for everything she allowed to occur up until that point.
In fact he felt so different that the lightening bolt scar that he usually tried to hide with his fringe was actually on display a bit with his hair combed slightly to the side.
"We aren't very good mates and our worry clouded our judgement. I should have known something was wrong. You dropped so many hints that someone was messing with your mind and we completely ignored it. I'm sorry Harry." Draco said, his eyes were brimmed with rare tears as he stood behind Severus looking very uncomfortable.
Harry wasn't sure what had happened. It wasn't every day you find out you are part creature. That said, it wasn't exactly a shock either.
Starting off with a mothers decision that changes the course of events ever so slightly.
"Uncle Sev, please tell me Harry is with you and not at practice again?" Draco asked sounding a bit depressed.
Harry shivered uncontrollably, his instincts were unsure whether to feel safe or not in the arms of the man who had essentially rejected him. That on top of the sheer amount of pain he was in made it impossible to settle down.
He dodged again as the first spell shattered his shield.
"I do believe woman, that he is safer behind ancient family wards at his own manor than the hovel you call home. As for you Mr. Potter, I would like a word in regards to the wizengamot. I was going to send you an owl, but since you are here..." Lord Malfoy let the sentence end prematurely. It was like he was testing him in someway.
"It actually true. He really is different." Draco couldn't believe it. Potter was actually breaking away from his manipulators. It was enough to make the young aristocrat giddy.
As the prominent young lord that he was, he decided, much to his grandfathers delight, that the muggle clothes had to go. Harry had made several appointments to different private tailors and had an entire wardrobe made for himself to reflect his status. They were uncomfortable for all of a few days, but going from over sized rags to clothes made to fit would have made anyone uncomfortable for at least a while, no matter the material.
"Honestly Draco, it's nothing much. Just a lot on my mind to be honest." Harry answered dispassionately. The cold draft in the empty classroom where Harry had decided to sulk causing him to shiver just a bit.
Cute awkward shy boyness. Someone notices.
For so few words, it was a lot to take in. So, he was a phoenix/ dark veela hybrid. Somehow, that made sense with what he could observe at the moment. The wings made so much more sense now.
The next morning found Harry up early. He'd been well rested and was surprised to see that breakfast was already made.
"You do. You actually think I would lie to you. You both actually think so low of me. Well, if it's a matter of trust then fine. Don't trust me. But don't think I'll be back here." Harry turned to grab his bag.
Draco had no doubt that dealing with Umbridge and the death of his god father had likely affected him in many negative ways, but now that he was paying attention, it seemed to have gone back to fourth year. It was right when the school year started. It almost seemed like Potter was falling apart and not in any kind of productive way either. He was more secretive. Harder to rile up.
"Thank you Lucius, for housing me and for the warning. Goodnight." Harry said, his nerves returning after the quick reprieve.
"Get it over with Draco. You know as well as I do that avoiding Pans is far more horrible than avoiding a howler." Blaise reminded him darkly. Yes Draco knew that very well and was beyond relieved he had not been betrothed to the rather difficult young woman. Blaise had a tough one for sure.
Harry took off after it. He zoomed passed Ron, nearly making the red head lose his balance.
"That is the question. What about it Malfoy? What do you want?" Potter asked him again.
"I've told you I have no idea. I eat breakfast like normal, I attend all my classes, I get my homework done, I eat lunch and dinner. I practice with the team and I come here. The only time that changes is on Tuesdays and Fridays when I'm in detention with Umbridge, and all she has me do is write lines." Harry answered in a slightly annoyed tone. They had had this conversation several times before now and he couldn't fathom why they were having it again.
Harry rolled away but hit one of the desks.
"Mint, Clover, Rose. Come here." Narcissa called and three house elves appeared.
"Should we pull you out? With Cissa and Draco presumably traitors to 'he who must not be named' theres little he'd tell you now." Cornelius offered.
"Well I could be in Hufflepuff too I suppose." Harry of course only said as much for the reaction he got.
Madam Pomphrey nodded as she spelled Harry into a healing sleep, having noticed an overdose of dreamless sleep in Harrys system already that needed purging and rebandaged his hand now that he no longer was shivering.
Ron did unfortunately recover however.
"I'm sure that, no matter what, magic would not saddle you with a mate that wouldn't do all they could to protect and care for you. It is what you need after all." His grandfather looked at him sadly. No, Harry had not told him any of the details of how he was raised, but he had guessed at the important parts. Harry was clearly neglected, touch starved, and malnourished. Between that and how little Harry thought of himself told Charlus all he really needed to know anyway.
But another epiphany presented itself. Draco realized hed been treated more decently in the last hour by the people he hated for years, than his father had as far back as Draco could remember.
The party was ... For lack of a better word, frivolous. Harry understood that the Malfoy family was extremely influential in the ministry and therefore couldn't really be seen holding back for large events. That's fine.
"Albus, I received a summons. I doubt the Dark Lord is happy." Severus said, entering the mans office. His mark burned just a bit more, giving Snape a sense of urgency.
Harry smiled as he walked up to the main doors of Potter manor.
to kill Dumbledore and Harry Potter? Surely he doesn't think he'll succeed? Thats madness!" Fudge declared incredulously.
He was never evil in the first place just a really damn good actor.
Next chapter we meet little Harry and get to see his and Dracos first meeting. Prepare for the cute.
"Oi whats this then?" One Draco Malfoy, having been ignoring Rons idiocy, announced. In his hand was a glass orb.
This was not the young man that she had done her research on. From what she could gather, Harry had always been a rude and abrasive character that never truly became a part of wizarding society, having been raised by muggles up until his birthday this summer.
"Harry. Harry please, look at me." Severus sat himself at the foot of the bed and reached out to swipe away the dark hair hiding Harrys face, only to draw back as Harry flinched back.
Yet still, he had not slept more than maybe a few minuets when he first dozed off.
"You as well, Mrs Weasley. If you'll pardon me though, I must see the boys off and all. Good day." She called out politely but she too had become tense, as she straightened herself even further than usual and calmly led Draco and Harry through.
He was glad that with a little work and proper clothing, he looked almost like a completely different person. His grandfather had imparted the secret of maintaining his mop of hair, though it would still be a little wild until it grew out just a little longer.
"The best made plans always have a backup plan as it were. That said we are here to talk. Look the school is about to change. Get shifty you know. Draco must be careful since his every move is being watched. With Dumbledore good as gone for his lack of help we dont have a lot of options in the way of communication between the snakes and lions. That said I will only be able to relay the plan once. Youre the smart one think you can remenber it and effectively pass it forward?" Pansy asked.
Looking away from the parchment, Harry soon realized why his hand had begun to hurt.
Ron blessedly grumbled but otherwise dropped it.
" Draco shot back.
Time for some good old fashioned Gryfindor action. And she figured she knew exactly who to corner.
Molly just shook her head.
"I don't know anything about another project, but I will be doing something about this." Sev promised.
He didn't have his trademark sneer or smirk either, rather a look of curiosity that made Harry believe Dracos animagus would be some form of cat. He was hunting for answers, that much was certain.
There was a walk in closet but Harry doubted hed ever fill it.
So, here's the deal. In canon Umbridge makes an UmBitch of herself fairly quickly. Here I'm going to make her annoying until now because reasons.
Harry sighed as the man left with his son, now thinking that Dumbles was more than aware that Lord Malfoy held his proxy, meaning he was trying to either talk Harry out of it before he met with the blonde man, or use some compulsion or other to force the matter.
"It was a harmless prank. Bet he isn't even really hurt anyway." Ron added with a sneer.
The public.
"Is it to Masters liking?" The thing asked.
The other two however, Harry had grown a bad habit of shrugging when he didn't feel like talking and rolling his eyes when he was annoyed.
Beyond the door was a decently sized room. There was a dinner table with food laid out. A large bed in the back by the windows, seperated by a screen. There was a large fireplace opposite the dinner table. A large wardrobe sat facing the bed from the side wall and different rugs seemed to be what designated different spaces. On the wall above the fireplace was a large tapestry that held the hogwarts crest, depicting all four houses. All in all it was tasteful and elegant, but not completely over done.
That said it looked like he needed either the sword of Gryffindor, which was currently locked safely in the headmasters office, or a lot more basilisk venom, which despite his alliance with Snape, wouldn't prove all that helpful since it was a rare and expensive potion ingredient. He could go into the chamber and see if the rotting snake corpse had any venom left to give, but he doubted it, and any there would likely have lost any real potency.
"What the ginger army? No one important. The Weasleys are technically pure bloods though Father hates them. He and the Weasley patriarch are something of enemies at the ministry. I dont like them either but mainly because they are loud, obnoxious idiots. They hate most pure blood traditions and besides that the lot of them are all Gryfindor. All of them. I think theres one in our year too actually but the youngest won't start until next year." Draco explained flippantly, only slightly bothered at being ignored. Though hed have prefered a different topic of conversation.
"Now, now, it's not all that bad. Look there, you are almost done. Then it's just a few investments to sign on. Griphook is a very good goblin and had already weeded through all the bogus business deals for you. The ones left are more a preference, but will all yield some kind of profit. Look here, this one on top looks good. The estimated income is only a little more than the original investment price, but the regular income nearly doubles. As for your letters, it's all for the different newspapers and magazines yes? Why not pick one print and work with them exclusively. That will cut down the chatter from other prints if you have a contract." Charlus assisted.
Harry came out at the designated floo for Diagon Alley. He stepped out, not wanting to be landed on should someone else come through. He really needed to figure out apparating.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry speaks to Draco and Dumbledore. Necessary but also annoying.
The chapter title kind of covers it I think
However, Harry would like a chance to actually talk to the blonde. To get to know the real Draco underneath the masks and superiority.
"It's not like we could sleep to stress either, Severus. Now what did you say about a horcrux?" Malfoy once again proved to be more level headed than Snape where he was concerned (second year not withstanding)
"Yes. It was Lilys idea. She figured if she died, I might be able to plead for your life as long as you had ties to the dark. So she made me your other godfather. So, even though I hated that you were nothing more than a puppet, I have always tried to protect you. I always will." Severus admitted. Harry smiled.
"That may need to be addressed by Severus himself. He became the potions professor correct? He can address it then.
"You look silly. That gel feels like it turned your hair into stone." Harry commented as Draco emerged from the bathroom.
"Do forget whatever that man has told you. Magic is a gift and a wonderful one. You have a lot of magic and while you are young it will protect you and help heal you. It acts out when you have strong emotions. You'll learn to control it over time." Snape explained patiently as Harry took in this new information.
So, I had to replace my keyboard because typing on my phone screen was unacceptable, but my keyboard died. That said my new one is cute and pink about to be covered in stickers.
"Yes, but that healing potion you just took was from Severus' private stores. He said no matter how good some of his newt students were, he would make sure you healed by his own hands as much as he is able. He gave me explicit instructions to go to him for any and all potions you would ever need while under my care." Poppy explained, having done her job and finished wrapping the new cloth around Harrys hand and then walking away.
Now though as he stared at his completed homework and his most recent bank statements, Harry found himself void of emotion regarding much of anything. He wasn't sure at this point if he really wanted to survive this war and deal with the 'adoring' fans that would come with it. Truly, though he felt like he wanted to be needed, he also didn't think anyone would ever approach him genuinely ever again after the war was over if he lived. It would always be fame, status and money.
Who would look at him anyway? He was really nothing more than a scrawny teen with bags under his eyes. Who could he honestly trust to help carry the burdens that life had given him? Who could.... ?
"Yeahm maybe." Harry mumbled in reply. 'Keep your head down'. Apparently that wouldn't work anymore.
"Already taken care of. All she must do is take one little step outside the schools wards, and she will know pain. I even obliviated her as she has done to Harry." Severus promised as he had indeed taken care of that already.
"The Dark Lord will be here briefly for breakfast, before he leaves to continue work on his own manor. He will want to speak with you Harry, but as long as you are respectful, I foresee no problems." Lucius said, speaking to Harry directly.
"Oh, alright. Lets get it over with. Not much to tell really." Draco admitted, strolling over to the armchair to the side of the couch where he usually sat.
That said, it was actually Hargrid, the gameskeeper, who had the clue they needed. Hermione had become something of a friend to the half giant and Harry, while finding him a bit clumsy, quite enjoyed his company.
"Hermione Granger." Harry perked a bit at the familiar name. The girl nervously sat on the stool.
"Besides, all games are scheduled for Friday or Saturday every few weeks. Practice rotations require only two teams on the field at any given time. So only two practices per week and a possible game that weekend. Wood is only trying to give him a fair advantage against the older more experienced players on the other teams. The youngest seeker against Harry is on the Ravenclaw team, and she is a 5th year student.
"No. I will not. I started shopping alone and I intend to go home alone when I have finished. I will not be herded like cattle. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going." Harry said trying to back away from the now irate woman.
Harry was devastated. He had hurt Draco and the others. He had no idea why he had even bothered with practice so much anyways. He hadn't even really been given a choice in the matter either.
"Well, that's the best news I've ever heard. Im in." Remus Lupin announced as he strolled in unannounced, though frankly they were barely passed the entry way as it was, a wolfish grin plastered on his face.
With that, the Malfoy head made his way out and to his own office. He had false reports to write.
No his father wasn't the most loving father and he was strict, but he had always made it clear to Draco that he only wanted the best for his only child. He wasnt always there but he provided, and he would step in for Draco at the slightest provocation.
"Whatever. I hardly need to listen to you, ferret face." Ron quipped back.
"I have been going over previous votes to try to find someone who won't abuse it. Dumbledore has had my vote for a while, but none of the things he used it to vote in favor of, were things I agreed with. At least half were things he knows with certainty that I would never approve of. That said, I can't figure who to trust it with." Harry answered sipping at his tea.
"Master, it be almost time. Master Malfoy bes here in only a few moments. The parlor is ready for yous and guests. The apparition and floo room is prepared for his arrival sirs." Miffty announced.
"Severus!" Harry called out.
Harry heard Snape sigh before the man bet down and picked him up. The boys bag and the blood quill and blood soaked parchment followed him. He would show Madam Pomphrey first, then Lucius, then Dumbledore. He would not let this get swept under the rug.
Harry turned away heading instead for the library. He was sure that between himself and Hermione. They could figure out what was going on.
"Either way, we should leave. Come along Harry, we have much to discuss and quite a bit of shopping to do tomorrow so you'll need your rest. Come along and you'll never have to see them again." The taller man in all black spoke to him. His deep voice was soothing as he spoke and Harry instantly felt safer than he ever had before.
Hopefully Dumbledore wouldn't try anything before then.
The wide eyed look was apparently funny though because Potter started to genuinely laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are aware Mr. Potter, That Albus is not to be crossed or ignored lightly. I would choose your battles more carefully. I have been ordered by the Dark Lord to teach you occlumency. If you were able to reach a point to where the headmaster could not enter your mind no matter how he tried, you would be in a far better position to oppose him. As it stands however, you are vulnerable to such intrusions." Snape said getting directly to business.
"Well obviously. And its been easier to manage since I decided to try to grow it out. You just look pointy." Harry argued having gotten bored waiting for Draco to finish getting dressed..
"It was the unattended part I was asking about Potter." Snape sounded uncharacteristically understanding, and if Harry wasn't so bloody tired, he would likely have been more suspicious. As it was, he just narrowed his eyes in clear mistrust.
Suddenly there was a popping sound, and a short creature with big eyes and bigger ears appeared. Harry decidedly hid behind Mr. Snape.
"No. Aside from the number of businesses that profit on the sale of alchohol alone, to ban drinking to that degree would be going to far. It's no business of others if someone wants to have a drink or two with dinner or to celebrate something. Besides that, it would over tax our aurors with something unnecessary when they could be doing something else more productive." Harry answered.
Sorry its been so long. I honestly have just been busy.
The other students were cheering as Harry landed.
"Wait that's seriously it? So, where has she gone?" Blaise piped in.
Snape was getting frustrated by how little progress he was making in occlumency and Draco was fed up with him not telling anyone what was going on with him.
Left to her own devices until supper, Narcissa decided to write a letter to her son to explain her rash decision making, and also plead with him to fight his fears anger do what makes him happy. That she would support him no matter his choice. That she hoped with time he could escape the darkness that seemed to haunt his eyes as of late and that no matter what happened to her, he was not to give himself to despair. She would do what it takes to protect him, even if it was from himself or the expectations of Lucious and Voldemort.
Narcissa walked both boys calmly to the barrier and waited as a bunch of red heads all together filtered through. The short older woman, obviously the mother of the roudy large group, noticed them first.
Anyway, my Grandfathers portrait was telling us that a veela senses its mate by aura. When one or more come into their inheritance, the sub will sense it, whether they are of age or not. In my case I have part of two creatures. My veela side is submissive, but my pheonix side is dominant. I will likely have more than one mate. That means in the heirarchy of the relationship, one mate will be my dom and the other my sub while I'm in the middle.
"Hogwarts station!" And in a flash Harry was travelling through the green flames. He had practiced landing by traveling to different rooms in the manor. Now he didn't even stumble.
The woman was dressed a bit worse for wear and as she sighted them, her smile became tight lipped.
He set the sickles he had saved from the end of the previous school year into the bucket that was by the door of the bus and went to find a seat.
He had spoken to Minerva about Harry being on the house team. It had yet to affect his work but you would have to be an idiot to not notice Harry's exhaustion.
His 'friends' were the same way. All of a sudden it was letters daily.
This however, was a new low for her, and by extension, the ministry.
I cant help it. Harry is just an adorable snowflake to me and this will likely show it.
"That's what you've said, but Harry are you sure nothing else has changed. I mean you've been so tired lately on top of everything. We just want you better." Draco continued despite knowing very well that Harry was getting annoyed.
Looking over it was clear Draco was having a similar issue but was hiding it much better than he was.
Potions was almost therepudic that day. The rythmic chopping and dicing sounds as they made their potions (a more advanced healing draught that worked well when one has suffered traumatic but not life threatening injury) almost lulled Harry to sleep.
Hermione had noticed Harry was as nervous as she was about their flying class that monday as they would actually be going up in the air after weeks of broom safety and maintenance lectures. So, she'd suggested that after they finished their charms homework of course, they headed over to Hagrids hut or a bit of tea.
"Ginny would you mind helping me with something? I think I have an idea." Hermione whispered not wanting the boys to know she was up to something.
Before she could do anything, however, she would need to get under Potters skin and find a way to get him in detention.
"Everything hurts. My chest mostly." The boys monotone voice cut into Lucius as he was very directly  reminded of his own battle with rejection.
"Thank you. I don't deserve it, but I could use your help. I may have an idea that will keep us all alive, but it's a long shot." Draco announced. The others huddled in to hear the plan, not noticing theor head of house wearing a rare smirk just outside the common room entrance.
It did not take long for Molly and Narcissa to make it to the Black family home. Grimmauld place being just as dark and dreary as the pureblood woman remembered it if not worse due to lack of upkeep. What was Serius doing with the place. You'd think after azkaban he would have at least made it livable again. Though it looked like the git had actually just made it worse before his ... unfortunate fate. Narcissa made a silent vow to fix the place up now that she was here.
"The others will be here soon but if you need a few minuets thats fine." Harry offered.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was exactly 6 weeks into the school year when Ron asked him a question that instantly made him angry.
It was the morning that Harry needed to leave for Hogwarts and his house elves were practically grieving.
Harry smiled and nodded confidently before he took slipped through the door. He took a pinch of floo powder, grabbed hold of his fully packed and lightened trunk, and stepped into the flames.
"'Both of your godsons' sir? You'll protect me?" Harry was sure he looked extremely vulnerable at that moment, but he was also aware that this man was his elder mate and if he couldn't be vulnerable for him then when could he.
"Probably because you're you. Its not news that Harry Potter was adopted by Severous Snape. But it still surprises people. The Weasleys were friends with your parents while they were alive but they left you with Severous. They probably feel slighted at not getting to adopt someone famous into their brood. I wouldnt think about it too much. You're famous. Weird looks are normal. Especially now that you're at school." Draco wasnt helping Harry feel better.
Harry did however make one friend in Gryfindor. Another student who felt wrongfully placed. A certain Hermione Granger. The girl was incessantly intelligent and they often had theoretical debates regarding different subjects, as well as double checking each others work. They even talked about different electives they could take in the second term.
All the feels but I am not the type to heal someone over the course of one conversation because that isn't very realistic. Trust with be the crux of this entire story and how hard it can be to not only trust someone, but to get someone to trust you back. Trust goes both ways and I feel like that is an important message to get across.
"Well met, Lord Potter. Lead the way." Lucius greeted back. Harry turned with Lucius following him, going down the entry hall that led into a large open parlor with the largest windows Harry had ever seen that looked out on the vast land the Manor sat on. The elves had outdone themselves cleaning up and fixing the gardens. Already the life was coming back to the grounds and Harry hoped to have flowering plants come back by next summer.
"My Lord, the ministry woman is making a nucience of herself. Most if not everyone in the castle can not stand her. Dumbledore seems to let have run of the place however, so as not to annoy the minister at all. He and Potter seem to be the only ones who believe that you have returned. Even his so called friends, Weasley and Granger have ignored him the entire semester." Severus responded obediently.
Harry felt more than a little bad for Miffty and the other elves.
"You can't stop me from turning you in for this. I will not allow you to harm anyone else." Harry said, about to draw his own wand.
"Oi. Don't start. My best friend will
"You must be joking. He asked
So it took me a while to devise probably the most ridiculous reason to throw Harry in detention with Umbritches, and by ridiculous I mean I may have made it stretch a bit because I couldn't think of anything else. I'm sorry I tried.
Things settled down as they spoke more about their first term and Pansy, who had gone on one last trip before the start of term, revealed souvenirs for everyone and an extra gift for Harry since the trip made her miss his birthday. The parchments were American in the making and were used to write notes. This way they could still talk all the time even if they got into seperate houses.
Harry was truely beginning to hate his life. School wasn't too bad true but he found that his house mates were annoying, loud and far to touchy feely for his liking.
It was with great trepidation that he started moving again after that.
For the rest of the evening Harry found himself exploring the estate. He found a large kitchen that would make his Aunt Petunia absolutely green. A large formal dining room and the entry room and parlor by the from door. On the second floor was his bedroom, the master bedroom, as well as two guest room. Above that was a large single room which Mr. Snape explained was to be his play room, although that much space dedicated to gim made him a bit uncomfortable he was grateful.
The boys both followed the dark man and took hold of his robes.
It was the best possible mask to hide behind.
"Won't that out us to Dumbles? I thought we were trying to avoid that." Draco intervened.
Draco sighed. There was no point in stalling further and it looked like they had already vacated to common room of any prying ears.
"Oh will you both stop. You're going to get yourselves in trouble. The professor is here and we'd all like to hear what she has to say." The familiar voice of Hermione perked up. She had originally been speaking with another bookish type girl a bit behind them until then.
'Exciting indeed.' He thought.
Harry managed to gather his books and pay, having them mailed to his manor via owl before he was called out.
When Harry awoke it was to a very concerned Severus standing over him. He was in the hospital wing. Problem was, Harry had absolutely no clue what he could have possibly done to end up under Madam Pomfreys care.
. I can decide that. Besides how do you know which gift is the best when you've only seen yours?" Draco shot back.
After that, they had agreed to meet a few times to study or just hang out and get to know each other. They were closer to aquaintences than friends, but that was ok. Going slow was perfect for them at the moment.
Yes Harry was quickly becoming jaded with the lack of honest human contact and he was damn near leaving England and letting everyone figure everything out themselves.
The problems continued however.
"So, where do you stand? Thats the question isn't it? What do you want to do?" Malfoy was surprised by thequestion and even more surprised by where it came from. Ginevra Weasley was always someone he considered shy and rather pathetic.
Narcissa smiled and gave the boys a hug each before sending them up the steps and onto the train.
"You wouldn't dare, soon to be son in law." Lucius grinned as he continued to egg on his friend.
"Come in." Her voice grated from the other side of the door sounding very much like she was pleased with herself.
Short but oh so important. The drama unfolds, bit by bit.
"Cissy, release Draco, we should let them get settled into bed. It is quite late." Lucius said, having followed his wife at a slightly more sedate pace.
The hat wasn't even all the way on his head before shouting "Slytherin!" No surprise there.
The girls looked around but didn't run into who they were looking for until they got to the library. It was when they were searching the back rows that they were cornered themselves.
He felt he gave a good argument for that particular issue. It was also a wonder that this was only on the table now, but Harry figured that this was a new issue in the wizarding world. The pureblood families were often the ones setting the standard and they weren't likely to be seen away from home while too into their drinks. People around them would likely just follow suit. This issue was brought up after a muggleborn had gotten drunk and tried to assault someone in public if what Harry read on the issue was true.
"If you must know, as a secondary prize, any participating champions in the tri-wizard tournament are emancipated if they win while underage. It's a part of the old rules. They didn't bother to change them since it was supposed to only be of age students in the first place. Now, if you will excuse me, but I am in the middle of trying to retake the Potter Family Seat and estates. I have a lot to catch up on and really must be going." Harry answered, making a hasty retreat, easily catching up to Griphook so they could apparate away.
After a moment, when Draco had cleared the first of five chocolate frogs, He cleared his throat, signaling the start of the conversation.
Harry was surprised to learn that had his mother been a pureblood witch, he himself would be a sacred family, and even though he wasn't by technicality, the Potter line would continue as Sacred 28 so long as his future spouse was also a member. Though even that possibility would be lost to him if his mother was muggle like her sister. Go figure.
"You'll stay in that cubbard until you get that filthy habit under control! There will be no magic in my house!"

Madame Hooch wasn't giving any room for nerves either it seemed as the quittich coach barked out the lesson plan for the day like usual.
His only real hope was if someone came looking for one of them. Surely Dumbledore would. They may not be close anymore but those curses had to have set off some kind of alarm. Someone had to be coming, if he could just hold out until someone came. Harry dodged another spell, this one a sickly pale shade of red.
Harry had done his utmost to be prepared while also keeping up with his classes. Honestly it was a lot easier without Ron or Hermione interrupting him. He hadn't decided what to do about those two as of yet, despite it being almost two months into the school year.
Harry was grateful for that, and that no one else was on the bus at this time.
Whatever for?" Hermione was actually a bit angry now.
That said, Charlus Potter had no other portaits and was also frozen when the manor was closed after his death. That meant the man hadn't had an active portrait since his death until Harry unlocked the manor. As such, he was woefully out of date on certain things. He had had no idea that his son and daughter-in-law were already passed. He also wasn't aware the was had ever ended. He didn't know the prominent players on the political scale anymore. So, manners and court lessons were all he could help his grandson with.
If anyone knew that the other shoe would drop, it was Draco. Behind the portait hiding the Slytherin common room, the students of the snake pitt got a lot bolder. He was in for an interrogation and there was no way out of it if the looks of Pansy and Blaise were anything to go by.
Then just as the poor boy kicked of the ground, Longbottoms broom completely lost control. The boy was being thrown around as if on a bucking bull 15 feet above the ground.
"Ah, well, I do appreciate his discretion, but you can tell him I don't mind who he tells. I'm hardly worried about public opinion right now. Last year was a mess and while I did get a publicist to help me fix it, it isn't like it will be gone overnight.
"Well, I shall inform Draco as well to be on the lookout. Let's finish up here, and then I have a report to make." Lucius stated, clearly dreading the additional paperwork.
Do you follow so far Mister Potter?" Griphook kindly asked, likely noticing the expression on Harrys face.
Draco tried to hand it to him only for Ron to take it.
Harry found mingling an absolute chore. Half these people were minisrty officials and the other half were pure blood nobles. The nobles left things alone as they respected Lucious enough and knew Harry was his godson in all but name. The ministry officals though did not care.
Harry barely made it to his bed before he gave way to the tears that stung his eyes.
"You are clever but I just don't see you as being sneaky or devious like a Slytherin. Honestly, Ravenclaw may be best. You are insanely smart." Pansy continued.
"Thank you, for explaining. Shall we continue?" Harry asked.
"You mean to seek your own alliances. If the headmaster wants you dead then you don't side with him. You are your own spy. How very ... Slytherin of you." Lucius studied the young man (for he was no boy any longer) before him.
"We told you you were a natural but I don't remember  saying you should go and become the new seeker. And what is your head of house thinking. You're only in your first year after all." Sev ranted to Harry who was using his office as a sanctuary.
Dismissed, both of you. I must think." Voldemort waived them off.
"Where is the ink?" Harry asked confused as he picked up the surprisingly black and fairly plain looking quill.
"Now Harry, this is hardly the place for this. I'm sure this was all a misunderstanding, and we can work past all this." Dumbledores eyes were no longer twinkling and Harry turned so he was no longer facing him.
"Come now, sit up. No slouching or I'll have the elves tie your shoulders to the back of your seat again." The voice of his grandfather carried over to him. The man had a habit of jumping into the garden painting in the study to keep him company.
Still that depended entirely on one Lucius Malfoy showing up as promised.
"No need to be hostile, Mr. Potter. What's this about being emancipated?" Lucius Malfoy asked in that curious lordly tone of his.
Dinner was a lively affair, the elf kept busy between the two boys and the adults watching the boys interact excitedly while they ate.
That said he is ok now and I finally have a day off where I can actually write.
"You both sleep well, we shall talk more in the morning." Severus said as he followed Mint.
He was definately being watched. Harry could practically feel Dumbledores eyes on him all day. Breakfast was when it started. The headmaster had tried to summon him to his office again, a summons that Harry ignored.
"No I think Ill take it. After all, he wont need it now." Ron and his small group of 'friends' laughed.
Had Harry been in his right mind he might have thanked him, but in the state he was in, Harry barely registered he was there enough to drop the quill in his hand.
"Mother, you aren't serious? We'll be hunted for sure." Draco, just removing himself from the shock, stated rather matter of factly.
"Well, bugger. I hope I didn't do too badly and you're just observant. It really is painful though." Harry admitted relaxing a bit as both he and Lucius took seats on opposite couches.
"Draco, quit pacing. We need to figure out what's wrong with him. And since he's so determined not to say what we'll have to do this our way." Severus said, trying to calm the blonde teen who was still wearing a hole in the carpet.
Not suspicious at all.
"Very well. I shall fetch him. If you'll excuse me Lenora." Narcissa bid farewell to the woman and left to get her husband.
Sorry for the long wait. I had to reread the book so this could be as cannon as I could make it, but 6th year was a tricky one to reconfigure...
It wouldn't be much of an expense, his father (however irresponsible)
"Go with flow for now. I have no idea beyond that. I never thought Mother would leave Fathers side. Of course I dont know if Fathers even alright. This will be considered treason. Theres no guarantee the Dark Lord won't think Father had a hand in it." Draco had refused to think about it before, but now the truth was there.
"It was what the Dark Lord ordered of Draco. It's impossible for a student. He's breaking apart my family to punish us I think. He may suspect me. Tell me Cornelius, how is a student supposed to kill a wizard like Dumbledore? Or Potter with that ridiculous luck of his? 'Succeed or your precious Mother dies' he said. It's no wonder Cissa snapped. Dracos looked like a bloody ghost for weeks. I don't know whats worse, that I can't tell my wife what I've actually been doing or that she might not care." Lucious spoke harshly, bitter about the truth behind the words.
It took three days for the magic of the blood quill and the over dose of dreamless sleep to purge enough to be safe. The entire time, someone was at Harrys side, be it Severus, Draco, Poppy or even Lucius.
Lucius smiled and nodded.
That led him to thinking about Harry Potter again.
This would be their first guest here and it was the renowned Malfoy Lord. They were frantic with re-cleaning the entire manor until everything gleamed and they spent more than an hour deciding what tea to serve and what snacks to prepare.
This was it! Dumbledore must have had Hagrid get the stone and bring it to Hogwarts to be guarded! But why? It had remained safe in the hands of Mr Flamel for literally centuries. And now Sev needed it for Voldemort?
There was even a private bathroom.
Pansy was pleased. She had guessed the Gryffindor girls would likely be the ones to approach. If they were switching sides though, it would be Granger and Potter she would need to communicate with.
"How do you manage to make a mess of yourself even when you are traveling with others? I though you had fixed this clumsiness." Severus asked, his voice taking just a very slight amused lilt to it.
Harry walked into the bank, not really knowing where to go for the information he needed. That said he was sure the tellers would be able to tell him so, grouchy goblin or not, he walked more confidently than he felt to one of the teller booths.
"Mrs Malfoy. A pleasant day to you." She said politely but tensly.
The speed at which Harry was going was exhilarating. He smiled as he flew by at top speed. He easily caught the glass ball before it slammed into a glass window. Harry was genuinely happy as he realized what he'd accomplished.
So I was going to diverge a bit and follow Harry and Draco on the train ride, and i promise next chapter but Narcissa has interesting history with the Black family home, being born a Black herself and I could never resist a good reminiscent moment when presented one.
......................
'Anyone who thinks I'm head of this house hasn't met my wife.' Lucious thought to himself as he vowed to figure out how to go about this task.
Freaking Slytherins are so much fun to write.
The oblivious obsession continues.
Harry, being shy in nature, was immediately intimidated by the loud, boisterous, and huggy group. He had immediately gotten used to keeping the curtains around his bed closed while doing anything in the dorm room.
Very weird.
"Several reasons. First, for those like yourself using a proxy to go over the new information and give you a chance to change your vote if needed. Second, if anyone wishes to study the new law further then they may. Let's say they missed a loophole previously and now don't think the law is worth the risk, they can change their vote. The second vote allows for fairness and to break any potential ties without the mugwamps extra vote. Plus, like this, anyone under any spells has had time for such things to wear off. While that's not an issue anymore with the new protection spells in the actual building, it was a problem for previous generations, so the practice stuck. And thirdly, it gives both sides one more opportunity to present their case." Lucius explained.
"Yes, lets." Severus said still thoughtful about the brief run in with Potter.
The same outfit would have taken well over half a day by itself. Sure enough though in about 15 minutes the outfit was done and Harry was asked to change.
Well I hope that worked out ok. See you guys next time.
"Yes Mother. Come on Harry! I want to open your gift first!" Draco practically demanded as he led the way.
Harry had only swore once and he would never do it again. It took two hours for the taste of soap to get out of his mouth.
Harry really needed a publicist though because a lot of the people who did write back to his responses often commented that he sounded far more mature than they had expected after reading the news about him. They were for the most part pleased but shocked anyway.
Tea time and a private word with the Malfoy Lord. Further fighting or a new alliance.
He lost his balance just slightly. It was enough though.
"Get out here, boy. They are taking you out of this house. Good riddance to the lot of you freaks." His Uncles face was a plummish sort of purple as if he were terribly angry about this though Harry doubted it.
Severus might not care as much, but it was no secret that Draco idolized his father and that likely stung a bit. However, Lucius figured that it was well deserved and would end in results that much faster.
"I don't know what to do. He's too shy to tell Wood he's over doing it, but no one has seen him in over a week. He's already shut up in the Gryffindor common room as soon as dinner is over most days." Draco explained. Looks like it was worse than Severus had thought.
"To explain simply, I have three votes. One is mine the other two belong to you and Severus. I vote based on my beliefs, but your and Severus' votes are cast based on yours. When an issue is brought up to be voted on a ballet is made magically. Now, for each ballot I will cast a vote for you. If all is as presented in the issuing letter sent out before each meeting, then the vote is cast. If new information comes to light and I think it might sway your opinion one way or the other, I'll make my vote but cast yours as undecided. The next day you will recieve a notice about it. I will likely also send a letter to explain the change, and you will cast the vote yourself through the mail system, by sending it to me. At the next meeting the results of the previous meeting ar discussed and revoted. whatever the results are of the second vote become the law. If the votes land on a tie, the supreme mugwamp will cast his extra vote to break the tie. This extra vote can only be in play in the event of a tie, but as of now the supreme mugwamp is Dumbledore. Does that make sense." Lucius asked.
"Yes, that seems likely. Severus, your orders are this, observe the students tomorrow. I want to know if more students are afflicted than just young Potter. Keep an eye on that mate of yours, if we are to see him switch sides in this war then he needs to know he can find security with us. This job falls on you and young Draco and so far you are failing me. Sane I may be Severus, but I will
So what do you thing guys? Also dont worry, I plan to redeem at least the twins, but I apparently cant stand Ron any more than Dumbles.
"Go speak to whom you need to Severus. I will get him patched up like new, as I always do." Poppy offered.
The Slytherins are not as sneeky with gossip as the other houses would be lead to believe...
"He's my best friend and I basically abandoned him. I'd be hurt too if it was the other way around. Look I'll talk to you guys later, but I am taking this weekend off of practice. I need to catch up on my homework anyway." Harry said, leaving a barely touched lunch behind with a group of very confused Griffindors.
Still it was just before eleven that he made it to Severus' office.
The ever loved scene of Harrys first flying lesson with a little bit of a twist. This was so bloodyanoying to write because tweaking it but still making it as iconic as before is hard. You guys will need to let me know how i did.
We will move this story right along then.
The man might be sane somehow once again, but that didn't mean he didn't always call when it was the most inconvenient.
Regret was a powerful thing.
Sorry for the wait guys, work has been a test in my patience with humanity lately and by the time I leave for the day it is either late or I'm too done with life to bother trying  to write.
Alone.
So, Harry had written back that dinner time on Saturday would be fine and that if he had issues with Professor Snape to take it up with the man in person.
"Interesting. My own family carries veela genes and both myself and my son carries it. That said I still don't understand them." Lucius was list to his curiosity.
"If all goes well I won't need to. Tred carefully Lucious. I'm sure it will all work out." Cornelius didn't really believe that last part but he didn't really need to. It was a false hope and they both knew it.
Which is why Lucious gave him the letters in the first place.
He should know after all. The three empty vials on his bedside were testament to that.
Draco was not so lucky, his own face turning a brilliant pink that Harry had to admit was kind of adorable.
"Very well. Harry, to be sure, do you know how the wizengamot works? I'd like to be sure you understand before I cast your vote for you." Lucius asked.
He had hoped to discredit the boy by showing several detentions and an anger problem to show that he was lying about Voldemort as some kind of attention grab. It worked out well in his plans since it would show Dumbledore in a bad light as well; not that it was needed, the entire tournament was a political fiasco that they were still trying to clean up. The Diggory family now lived in France as political refugees with their much younger twins while mourning the loss of thier first born son, and France was very unforgiving of the use of minors in the second task while Bulgaria felt very cheated by the entire thing.
Ron sat in the air taunting Harry.
He hadn't really gone out in any of the new clothes yet, instead preferring to get used to them in private so he could at least attempt to seem comfortable once he was in public again.
Problem was, he had no idea what was wrong. He had even gone to see Madam Pomphrey, but other than being anemic and having a gash on his hand that refused to heal, she couldn't tell what was wrong with him either. Though she mentioned being worried about him suddenly being anemic, there wasn't much she could do other than give him some blood replenishing potions and send him on his way.
Snape smirked at her in a manner usually reserved for when he was using the most addicting of dark magics.
Problem number three came in the form of his former friends and Dumbledore.
To sum up the opening feast as awkward and tense would be a drasticly inappropriate understatement. The eyes of everyone were practically glued to the silver haired Slytherin from start to finish and it was impossible to not hear the whispers.
Sev sat there thinking for a moment. Harry didn't know anything about the stone did he? Surely not there was no way he could. . . . Well, Harry was always finding himself in interesting situations. Never truely dangerous, but this could be different. . . . He would be making his challenge a good bit more complicated now and Dumbledore could go kiss a troll for all he cared. He was not going to make it easy for anyone to make it into the mirror room.
"Then I'll have to remind you it's none of your business." Harry retorted, falling on the likely event of Draco getting frustrated by his lack of real answers and huffing off.
"Oh, leave it Ron. Nevel was hurt and it could have been a lot worse. We have another flying lesson in two days anyway. It won't kill you to wait." Hermione pitched in, clearly dissappointed by Rons continued immaturity.
Yet it was when his eyes found the empty seat at the staff table that morning that really struck him. Harry couldn't help but wonder if Sever... Professor Snape was avoiding him at all costs.
The hat spoke to her for a moment but didnt take long before shouting "Gryfindor!" Enthusiastically.
He could use a controlled fiendfire, but he wouldn't risk it in the school and he wasn't sure who he could call on that could do that.
"Because it just seemed so unlikely. No one had seemed to be out to get you so far this year other than the newspaper. Sure we knew Umbridge worked for the ministry and we knew she didn't like you saying the Dark Lord was back, but up until now she didn't really do anything about it. We knew you were ill, but you tend to get into things you shouldn't so we just assumed you were up to something and would tell us when you were ready. We weren't going to push it until it was clear that whatever was happening was severely affecting your health. We never connected it to Umbridge because she was giving you detention for disrupting class. She said you were disrespectful and spreading Dumbledores rhetoric about the Dark Lords return, but it was just writing lines. Now that we know the truth we just feel like idiots." Draco explained, his face turning red in his embarrasement.
For paperworks sake however, Lucius had told him to go ahead with the detention and he would deal with the minister.
"No not in here. Least none not made of chocolate." Draco immediately pulled out his wand however.
That required letting Potter and his friends in on the plan. He had left that to Pansy and she had borrowed Blaise. The two of them had apparently cornered Granger and she-Weasle in the back of the library to let them in on the plan and pass it on to Potter.
Draco responded by throwing several pillows and cushins at him.
"Dray! I've been at practice. I'm sorry." Harry knew that particular look. Most wouldn't be able to read Draco but Harry knew he had hurt his feelings by vanishing.
"No. He's right. I haven't been to see any of my friends in ages. I didn't even want to play and this happens." Harry said miserably, near tears.
Looked like that's what he would be doing over the Yule holiday as well. Lovely.
At that time, though Draco was unaware until later, Harry was in contact with his Godfather. He seemed to have things going for him at last.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not too bad, but you are new at this, so it's easy for me to spot. Draco was the same when he was younger, and you have a lot of bad practices to let go of before it will come naturally." Lucius actually was joking with him. This was sureal.
