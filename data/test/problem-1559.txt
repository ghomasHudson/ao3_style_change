“Just an encounter with Weasley. He was very mad at me. He doesn’t believe me and thinks this is all just a front I am putting on for you all to believe I’m good,” Draco sighed softly, not daring to look at Harry. “If you are just going to intimidate me as Weasley did, I’m not interested.” Draco coldly stated, just hoping Harry would walk away to his seat.
“Nothing really interesting—just you know, boring detention. She made me clean and dust her office and some other stuff,” Harry said before biting on the inside of his cheek. It wasn’t like Harry was completely lying. Nearing the end of his week of detention he did have to clean up Umbridge’s office and dust her many cat pictures that line the walls of her office. He just didn’t say anything about the pain he had to endure.
The next day in potions class any time that Snape would turn his back to explain something on the blackboard Harry and Draco would be passing notes back and forth to each other. Ron sent a note to Draco and Harry, and it was a doodle of Snape. With this doodle, Harry and Draco couldn’t help but laugh. They did try to contain it, but it was no use. They quickly stopped laughing when Snape turned and glared at the three of them.
“That would be really appreciated Draco,” Harry smiles and blushes lightly with the thought of getting to train with Draco and having him fighting by his side. The thought alone of Draco fighting by Harry’s side in battle was very romantic sounding to Harry.
“Draco Malfoy, I didn’t expect you of all people to be jealous enough to break me and Harry up. Apparently, being taken is hotter than being single. At least that is what the people I was hooking up with told me… That’s not the point! Stay away from Harry. I had him first, so he is mine, even if I just use him for the popularity.” Cedric glared at Draco.
Harry was in the courtyard with Ron eating some sweets they got from Fred and George. Harry looked over Ron’s shoulder and saw Draco running around looking around like he was looking for something.
Voldemort was reborn that night and Harry just barely managed to make it out of there alive. The Council is refusing to believe that “The one who shall not be named” had indeed returned.
Harry just stood there taking in all the information that he just heard. There was no way that Cedric was cheating and making out with someone else… is there? That is what Harry thought at least. “No… this can’t be right, Cedric would never… he is just too nice to do something like that to anyone,” Harry stated.
He never wanted to become a Death Eater. That was Lucius' dream and his path in life. Draco wanted to live his own life, for himself and nobody else. Draco no longer wanted to be his father’s puppet. He knew that the only reason that his dad wanted him to become a Death Eater was to get back on Voldemort’s good side.
Draco squinted slightly and read aloud, “I must not tell lies? Huh, that doesn’t sound like what she put you through was working at all,” Draco paused for a moment before continuing. “So, would you like to explain this, or would you like me to take a guess as to what this woman has done to you because I highly doubt that this is your own doing.”
“Well, you were with Cedric, and when I thought about telling you… Well, you had literally just gotten out of a relationship with the guy.” Draco stated and Harry nodded.
“Actually, something did happen… but I am not meant to talk about it. With the Dursleys, well other than a lot of hard work, yelling, and my cousin making fun of me, it was pretty normal summer.” Harry looked sad as he had to think back to what had happened. Even though he was dating Cedric there was no way Harry was going to admit that Dudley heard Harry say Cedric’s name in his sleep. That is way too embarrassing to say out loud. It was already bad enough that Dudley said it out loud to Harry in front of his “gang.” With the dementor attack well, the Order didn’t want Harry to go spreading out “lies” which was the truth. That being that Voldemort was back and him being responsible for the rogue dementor that attacked him and his cousin. “I also had to go to trial and the reason is the event I am not allowed to talk about.”
Harry grabbed Draco by the collar of his shirt and pulled him into a kiss. Draco was caught off guard but quickly melted into the kiss. Draco and Harry were blushing like crazy and no longer cared who saw them. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist pulling him closer, deepening the kiss. Harry slowly pulled away and looked at Draco. Draco thought this was a dream and wished to never wake up from it. Draco slowly opened his eyes and looked into Harry’s eyes.
“Well, how can I prove it to you when the school only just started. You have to give me time to prove myself,” Draco quickly stated and paused for a moment. “Just give me a week. Okay? Just one week to prove that I have changed. I am sure I have a lot of you in my classes so you can watch over me if that is what you want.” Draco let out a soft sigh. He no longer wanted to talk. Draco was starting to get in a bad mood, but he was not angry. Draco was just upset, but he should have known that this was going to happen.
Something in Draco had changed. He wasn’t mean to people as he used to be. He didn’t tease anyone that wasn’t one of his close friends. Over the summer Draco had stood up to his father. With Voldemort being back it was time for the topic about being a Death Eater. This was brought up to Draco by his father.
“Sorry, I was really hungry, and I had to find a way to sneak away without Goyle and Pansy finding out,” Draco said in a soft quiet voice. Harry patted the seat open next to him and Draco walked over slowly before sitting next to Harry. “So, why did you call me out here?” Draco asked as the question was honestly driving him crazy.
Harry Cleared his throat before speaking, “um, excuse me, do you know where Draco Malfoy is by chance?” The three looked over at Harry.
Hermione was in complete shock with what Harry just said that she didn’t know what to do or ever say. Harry took the moment of silence as his time to quickly leave the room. Harry left the room and heading his way to the Astronomy Tower. He was hoping to run into Draco but not at the same time since he knows that Draco will quickly see the scar on his left hand and lose his mind over it like Hermione was. Bad luck for Harry though because he did run into Draco.
“Oh, don’t play pretend Draco, I knew it was you. I could sense it moments before I woke up. I heard your mom’s voice asking you if I was okay,” Harry quickly said as he moved a hand to Draco’s chin, moving it to force Draco to look at Harry again. “Don’t lie to me, I know what I heard and felt,” Harry paused for a moment. “I just want to know how? How exactly did you help to wake me up?”
“I know you said that your father wanted you to be a Death Eater and all that, and if you don’t want to talk about it, we don’t have to. I was just wondering if over the summer you learned anything about what they might be planning or not,” Harry just straight out asked. There were times where he didn’t have a filter and right now was one of those times.
Weasley… I am done with games. It is as I have said before, I really do want to change whether you believe it or not,” Draco stated after a few moments. Draco was sounding rather emotional by the end of his statement. He really just wanted someone outside of his group to see that he really wants to try to be good. The thought of everyone forever hating Draco after he has changed makes Draco somewhat emotional.
“I feel so stupid… Getting played like that… I should have just believed you when you told me about what you saw, but I just had to see it for myself…” Harry was not crying anymore but he was still being hard on himself.
“There is just something that I have been wondering… I don’t know how to say this, so I am just going to come out and ask it. Why have you changed so much since last year?” Harry looked back into Draco's eyes, trying to read Draco’s expressions.
At least Harry didn’t make an empty promise that he would write to Cedric and talk with him over the summer. He just knew it wouldn’t be possible with him still staying with the Dursleys over the summer… again sadly. The days leading up to going to the Dursleys and being with the Dursleys only made Harry sad. Making him wish he could be with his godfather instead or even the Weasley. If it didn’t make him feel like he was being a bother just by asking he would have asked to spend the summer with the Weasley’s, but he just couldn’t do that to them. They already had a lot of mouths to feed and, again, he didn’t want to be a bother to them over the summer. At least not over the whole summer.
“Draco? What are you doing up here?” Harry asked as he walks over to Draco. Draco quickly turns to look at Harry. Draco smiles happily.
Even though Cedric was worried about Harry, he was one of the last to hug and check on him. Cho was demanding his attention. He also decided to let Harry and his friends along with the French girl, Fleur Delacour, have their emotional moment. Since Harry did save her little sister.
One of the Slytherin spoke up and told Harry, “Look up in the trees and you will eventually find him. He won’t be hard to find with his hair sticking out so much against all the green in this area.”
Goyle had Draco’s back though. “oh, shut up Pansy, you would do the same if you went through the same rubbish Draco endured,” Goyle protested. It was really nice having him around, despite him being rather stupid at times. He was the first Draco talked to about wanting to be good. Goyle was, surprisingly, with Draco on wanting to be good. After they lost Crabbe, things haven’t been the same. In a way, Draco kind of always knew that Goyle would no longer want anything to do with the Death Eater stuff after the passing of Crabbe. Which is understandable, to say the least. Still, Draco was surprised Goyle even wanted to be friends with him after Draco had officially become a Death Eater in the eyes of the Dark Lord. Goyle, better than anyone, understood that Draco was forced to do it to make his father happy.
“Um, Harry can I ask you something simple?” Draco asks but as soon as the words left his mouth, he started to get nervous. Harry tilted his head, interested in what Draco had to say but didn’t say anything. Draco took a deep break before continuing, “How to feel about me? Like what do you think about me?”
Draco was lightly blushing but shook his head and smirked. He was going to happily take that as a challenge. “you’re on Potter!” Draco muttered to himself before heading off to his room and writing a letter to his mother about what had happened.
Harry looked at Draco’s hand for a moment before taking it, getting help to get up off the ground. “Yeah, that lady is so crazy I don’t want to mess with her. Any time she talks about something she has no clue about, like the fact that Vold-,” Harry paused as Draco was glaring at him. “You don’t want me to say it either? Why? The word holds no power they are just words.”
There was a voice nagging Draco, trying to tell him not to go and that it would be a waste of time. This voice sounded just like Lucius nagging at Draco trying to get him to become a Death Eater. ‘Draco you know that this is all just a waste of time. Why don’t you just send me a letter telling me that you want to become a Death Eater and we can have this whole school in the palm of our hands? Wouldn’t that be nice?’
“I have already spread the idea around to some students, but they need to know if… Voldemort was even back or not. I say she should set up a little meeting somewhere outside of school to talk about it and see who will sign up. Ron and I will spread the word,” Hermione smiled as she looked over to Ron.
That afternoon Draco spent his free period helping the group of Hufflepuffs relax and stay balanced while on their broom. They were just a group of very clumsy Hufflepuffs, so it took a while. By the end of the lesson, they were all laughing and thanking Draco for the help. Draco was feeling rather shy with people complimenting him and thanking him. It really did make Draco happy to be helping others.
years that were in Ravenclaw. The Golden Trio kept a very close eye on Draco any time that they could. Nearing the end of that week people started becoming conformable with Draco being there.
Let’s just say that Draco was really happy to get back to Hogwarts so that he no longer had to deal with the tension between him and his father. He was also excited to get to become friendly with Harry. It was that same summer that Draco thought a lot about Harry, and only then did he realize that he had a crush on him. The guy he still has beef with was his crush. Draco wanted to make things right between the two of them at the very least even if they don’t even end up dating since Harry was with Cedric.
“Geeze thanks… it’s nothing, it is not like you would believe me if I told you always,” Draco didn’t mean for it to sound as cold as it did, but he couldn’t help it. Draco looked away and opened his book to the page needed for today’s lesson.
“Oh, no it is okay, I just needed to ask in case you did know anything that would help!” Harry moved closer to Draco and slightly nudged him. Harry looked into Draco’s eyes and smiled. “It is okay. I am just happy that you are by my side to help me with everything that is going on. I will do what I can to protect you because I will not lose you now that I got you! And that is a promise!” Harry chuckled softly which in turn made Draco start laughing.
about me?” Draco didn’t know how else to explain it without straight out asking if Harry had any romantic feelings for Draco.
much is what I mean... Because I like you like that...” was all Draco said as he was blushing like crazy. He couldn’t believe that he actually just did that. Harry was in complete disbelief. He was shocked but also blushing like crazy.
Harry buried his face onto Draco’s shoulder. “Cedric—You were right…” Harry managed to say while he was muffled from hiding his face.
Harry cleared his throat and that alone got Draco's attention, but Harry still called out Draco’s name. As soon as Harry saw Draco look back at him, he started sopping. “D-D-D-Draco—” Harry managed to say in between sobs.
Draco watched as the two of them got out of view. Draco relaxed and sighed softly once Harry was out of earshot and out of his view. Draco leaned against the tree he was in earlier and smiled. That was until Cedric walked up to him.
“There is also the Daily Prophet, I am sure there will be people wanting to question you. People like, Rita Skeeter.” Narcissa quickly added. This was something she was really worried about. She really didn’t want someone like Rita Skeeter to question Draco and then just twist his words and write what she wants anyways. Draco was slightly tense just of the thought of what the Daily Prophet has been saying about them. “Anyways, I got you something Draco. It’s nothing special,” Narcissa tells Draco as she holds out a gray beanie. “I thought you might have been worried about your hair making you stand out,” Narcissa finishes, and she walks over to Draco.
Once at Astronomy Tower Harry sees Draco once again leaning on the railing looking out at the stars. Once Harry made it to the top of the stairs Draco turn and looked over at him.
“Yeah, yeah I know,” Harry huffed before chuckling. “So, what do you want to do, we have time before our next class starts. I was thinking—” Harry was talking but Draco couldn’t focus on what he was saying. Instead, Draco was more focused on the people over by the bleachers. They seemed to be, possibly, laughing at Draco and Harry.
“Yeah, you are a really smart person Hermione. You would be a great teacher!” Ron quickly adds before Hermione gave out her answer. Ron was stuffing his face, so he didn’t get to add to the conversation till now.
Narcissa was relieved to hear that she son wasn’t going to be a Death Eater, that way if they lost the second war her son wouldn’t go to Azkaban. If she wanted anyone to be safe it would be Draco so that someone could live on with the family name. She was sad that she wouldn’t be getting any grandbabies that are blood-related but she still had some hope with getting her grandbabies.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry quickly apologized. “Hermione was just bringing something to my attention. She has helped come up with something we can do about the whole, Dark Lord thing,” Harry added.
‘Oh, come on Draco. Don’t you want to talk to me? No? Well, your loss. Just think about it. I do think that you are wasting your time, but I am not going to push it. I am sure you will see I am right sooner or later.’ And just as fast as the voice appeared, it was gone just as fast. Draco let out a sigh of relief and made his way to his next class. This wasn’t the first time that Draco had heard this voice. He heard it constantly, giving him advice on what he should do ever since he first came to Hogwarts. He only listened to the voice to make his father proud, but now he just tries to ignore it the best that he can.
When the dance was coming to an end Harry was getting tired and his feet were killing him. Harry had an amazing time at the dance, same with Cedric. Cedric walked Harry all the way to the entrance to the Gryffindor common room even though the entrance to the Hufflepuff common room was all the way over by the kitchen. “Thanks for going to the dance with me, I had a really fun time. It also helped me a lot to talk to you about questions I had about sexualities,” Harry stated giving Cedric a shy yet goofy smile.
“Well, I kind of always thought you hated me. I mean, recently we have become friends, but still.” Harry says. He was giving Draco puppy dog eyes hoping Draco would say that he liked Harry in any way.
“Wh-what? Really?” Harry was smiling, he couldn’t believe his ears. All Harry could do was smile. He was in a playful mood, so Harry decided to press further. “What am I to you? Like a friend, a crush~?” Harry couldn’t contain his smile; he wasn’t being serious but Draco being quiet while his face turning bright red said everything yet Harry was too blind to notice the meaning of Draco’s blush.
Draco was in the middle of chewing, so he covered his mouth with his free hand before finishing his bite of food he was chewing. Draco shook his head before speaking, “No, no it is okay. It actually feels good to have someone listen to me. I mean I have my mom who is luckily by my side on this. She was already a part of the Death Eaters from the first war so she doesn’t feel like she can switch sides without getting killed because she knows too much just from the last war. She knows his tricks and can think of that his plans would be just by how he works and all of that,” just as Draco finished his speaking the bell chimed. “Dang it is already time to leave?” Draco stood up and dusted off his robe. Draco held out a hand for Harry to help him up. “We better get going then, we don’t want to deal with Dolores’ wrath.”
People started to head to their common rooms by this point and The Great Hall started to empty. There is a group of people that stayed behind though, Draco and his group. The whole dinner Draco kept looking over at Harry. Draco didn’t trust Cedric. It could be because he is ever so slightly jealous that he was with Harry, or maybe Cedric was just giving off the wrong vibes around Draco. One this is for sure and that is Draco will never admit to being jealous. That is unless he is forced or needed to say it.
Even though a lot of time has passed since the incident, Vernon remembers the call with Ron like it was yesterday. He was uncomfortable with a Wizard having the number to his home’s telephone, but never even bothered changing the number since it was too much work, and he didn’t have the time to bother with it.
A few more classes later and dinner is eaten it was time for Draco to head off to the Astronomy Tower. If Draco wasn’t sweating before he was most definitely sweating now. Draco was extremely nervous. On his walk to the Astronomy Tower, he was muttering to himself, trying to convince himself that everything was going to be okay. Trying to tell himself that it will not end in a duel. Draco was paranoid and made sure no one was following him.
“I don’t really know… I guess it could be explained by nonverbal magic… I really don’t know. I just remember being extremely shocked and sad that you were dead and just constantly repeating it in my head that you would make it out of it alive—that you would wake up and you eventually did.” Saying that all out loud for the first time made Draco feel like he was crazy. Draco shook his head. “But I couldn’t have been the reason you woke up. I was the bad guy after all…” Draco frowned and looked away once again. Draco truly regrated being a Death Eater. A tear rolled down Draco’s cheek and he quickly wiped it away. “I’m sorry… I should go” Draco quickly got up and when to walk away but tripped on the blanket they were sitting on and fell onto Harry. Draco quickly got up, sniffled, and ran out of the tower.
“I never dated anyone because no one, not even my parents knew that I was gay. At the time I didn’t think that I liked anyone, but over the summer I realized that I had a small crush on you the whole time. When we became friends that crush only grew. Plus, you are not really that observant,” Draco was really happy that Harry liked him back and the same with Harry. Harry was thrilled that Draco liked him back and has liked him for so long.
“You can tell me anything. I won’t judge, but I can’t promise I won’t laugh.” Draco looked deep into Harry’s bright green eyes which were glimmered in the moonlight.
Within that one-week, Draco did what he could to help people. Draco even stopped a few Slytherins from playing bloody horrible pranks on some 1
Draco was doing what he could to be on good terms with Harry. Out of everyone that Draco messed with and was mean to, he wanted to prove to Harry that he was good.
for attention.  Draco was the first of the Slytherin table to excuse himself and headed for his room. On his way, he was stopped by none other than the Golden Trio. He was expecting this to happen eventually he just wasn’t expecting it till before morning classes.
Harry finished his food before speaking, “Draco, I am so sorry. I had no idea that you were dealing with all of that at home. I kind of thought that you were always a jerk because that was just who you are from your father, not that you were doing it to get his attention and make him proud. You really didn’t have to tell me all of that, I didn’t mean to pry into your life.”
“I will do with you. I will help you convince them, and I will also be joining the club with you guys,” Draco says with a smile. “My dad literally asked me to become a Death Eater since The Dark Lord was back,” Draco pointed out.
Draco turned and looked into Harry’s eyes. What Draco would give just to kiss Harry right then and there. The truth is Draco has always had feelings for Harry but had to push his feeling away then he was trying to make his father happy. Draco didn’t even know if Harry was straight or not. He has always seen Harry try and get with a girl but then there was the whole Cedric thing. You would have to be blind not to see the tension that was between the two of them. Draco was sure that Harry was at least a little gay, but didn’t know if he was okay with it.
“Well look to is back from the dead! Where have you been Pottah? I was starting to get worried,” Draco says as he crosses his arms. Even though they have been talking and hanging out constantly for a whole month at this point, Draco still calls Harry by his last name mostly out of habit.
Draco shakes his head. He didn’t want to respond to it. Draco takes a deep breath and just does his best to ignore it.
Harry pulled Cedric to the side and asked him in a low voice so that only Cedric could hear, “Do you want to go to the Yule Ball with me…?”
Draco looks at his mother and then down at the beanie. This is just what he was looking for, but he really didn’t have any hats and a hood was out of the question. He takes the hat into his hand and turns to the mirror and puts it on. “This is perfect, just what I was needing, thanks, mother.” Draco smiles at his reflection. He was in the perfect outfit to blend in. Nothing was standing out that would someone think that this was Draco. “It is getting time for me to leave; I am going to head out to see if I can get on the train before many other people. I’ll write to you when I can and tell you how things are going.” Draco gave his mother a quick hug before getting all of his things and making his way to King's Cross Station.
This is where Harry ended up snapping. “Do you really expect me to believe that?! Do you think I am stupid or something? For the last week I was watching the things, you were doing. You were very touchy and always flirting with someone! This is the only time I walked in on you kissing someone else, but I am sure you did a lot of kissing over the last week that I didn’t see… I wish I could have just believed when Draco told me he saw you kissing some girl in the changing room, but I just had to see it for myself. I regret that decision, but I just had to see if it was true. I couldn’t talk to you about it because you could just easily lie about it and I just don’t want to get hurt any more than I already have.” Harry paused for a moment letting tears run down his cheeks. He wipes them away and lets out a sad broken chuckle. “You think you're super sly. Flirting with them but telling me you're mine. Building me up, but buttercup you lied. I've gotten tired of the games that you played. When you tell me, you loved me then you throw that all away. So, cry me a river… Oh and remember our date in the park? Yeah, I was playing super dumb while I was holding your hand like I didn’t know what was going on… I can’t believe that you of all people would go and do this to me. I guess it is most definitely true now that not all the Slytherin are evil it could be anyone in the 4 houses… I am so happy Draco told me what he saw because I can stop wasting my feeling on someone who doesn’t deserve it… Goodbye Cedric Diggory, please, don’t talk to me again. I don’t want to hear it.” Harry walked away quickly before Cedric could say another word.
“I don’t think I can continue… My body is refusing to move and even if I do, I am sure I’ll be way too shaky. I’ll just end up falling if I try to continue. Cedric looked to the side and saw his wand. After a lot of struggling, he got his body to grab the wand and point it up at the sky, having red sparks shoot out of his wand and into the sky. Cedric was officially out of the race. “You may have one by default, but you should still search for your price. The cup that is,” Cedric smiles weakly before closing his eyes.
“You have been doing that a lot recently. Is something on your mind? You know you can tell me anything,” Harry stopped walking and gently grabbed Draco’s arm.
“You like me too?! I had no idea! I didn’t even know that you were into dudes!” Harry blurted out without really thinking.
The day Draco got the letter from the Ministry of Magic telling him that he would get to go back to Hogwarts was a conflicting day for Draco. Draco was so happy that he would get to go back to school, but he was extremely worried about what others might say or do when they see him. The reason he wanted to go back to school was to try and prove that he is getting better and can be a good person. He also wanted to apologize in person.
Harry and Cedric made eye contact and smiled at each other. Cedric said bye to his group of friends and went over to Harry. “You look great! Green was a good choice,” Cedric says as he smiles brightly.
“Took you long enough, I thought you would never turn over and look at me. I was standing there awkwardly for ages! Well, more like 5 minutes—but still!” Draco was being overly dramatic, but that is just typical Draco behavior.
“Harry! Where is this from? Did Umbridge do this while you were in detention? You have to tell one of the professors or even go tell Dumbledore!” Hermione was rushing was she was speaking because she was in complete shock and running off on autopilot of being a worried mother.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but he knows when a response is not wanted. He signed and left without saying another word. He was walking back to the changing room muttering himself. He really did want to go and practice quidditch. Yet, his mind was somewhere else the whole time, and the captain repeatedly had to tell Draco to focus, but it was no use.
“Oh, come on, it isn’t your fault for what Cedric decided to do. You had no idea! For the record, you are not stupid Pottah. You are actually quite amazing. You’re goofy, funny, down to Earth, easy to talk to, and quite sensitive. Yes, sensitive in a good way. If you weren’t then it would probably feel like talking to a brick wall.” As soon as Draco finished talking Harry started chuckling and hearing that made Draco smile. Harry pulled away from the hug just enough to be face to face, looking at each other.
Draco spent all night tossing and turning. He was really tired, but his thoughts wouldn’t shut up. He honestly wished he hadn’t gone to the tower. For the next few weeks after that moment, Harry would try to talk to Draco, but Draco would quickly leave before Harry even say anything. A full month has passed, and Harry still couldn’t get a word in to speak to Draco.
At dinner, something had snapped in Hermione. Since seeing what happened to Harry, Hermione had an idea of what she can do.
Everything went by as usual. Once in the maze, Cedric wanted to get the cup, but he also really wanted to find Harry. It didn’t take long before the maze was messing with his head.
much staring he would get from that night onwards. Plus, he didn’t want to get teased endlessly for wearing a dress.
Everything was as great as they could be in Harry’s world, but he didn’t pay attention much unless he really needed to. Just like at the Yule Ball and over the summer Cedric was still flirting with people and getting together with them. Even though his relationship with Harry Potter made him more well-known in and out of school, there were obvious things that Harry and Cedric could not do. So, Cedric looked for it in other people.
The guy Cedric was kissing cleared his throat. “So, I guess that means you are single now. So, what do you say—” The guy was quickly cut off, interrupted by Cedric.
As soon as the conversation ended Harry quickly headed to class doing his best not to be seen by Cedric. This is what Harry was waiting for. The main proof Harry was looking for before he would end the relationship with Cedric was to see Cedric kissing someone else and so far, Harry hasn’t seen it. This meeting though was going to be the proof that Harry was looking for. Harry was going to walk in on the make-out appointment and acted like he didn’t know what was going on. He was going to act shocked and cause a scene.
“Sorry, sorry. Um… well, people in my house have been making fun of me about… something and it has just made me paranoid of what others could be saying about me, or us, without knowing,” Draco lightly chewed on the bottom of his lip waiting for Harry’s reaction.
Draco did send out letters to anyone who he may have hurt, but he knew he would have to apologize in person. He sent some letters to almost all the Weasleys, Hermione, and many others. He also made sure that he included in his letter to George how extremely sorry he was for George’s loss. There was one person he didn’t send a letter to. He didn’t send a letter to Harry because he just didn’t really know what to say.
“Thank you for asking me to go with you. I was quite shocked by you asked me, but none the less am glad I said yes,” Cedric gently grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling him close. Cedric winked at Harry before chuckling softly. He stared deeply into Harry’s eyes. “You really do have such beautiful eyes.”
Harry never questioned Cedric about why Cho was there as his person to save and Cedric got away with it. When it took Harry a long time to come to the surface Cedric was about to just hop back in to go get him. He wasn’t a complete monster; he is still a Hufflepuff after all.
“I asked a few favors and got some food for us without Hermione and Ron knowing. They think I am up in my room coming up with a plan with everything that is going on. I do need to think some things through and form something like a plan, but that can wait a bit. Oh, and they also think that I am catching up on the homework that I literally can’t do over the summer thanks to the people I have to stay with outside of Hogwarts,” Harry says with a bit of a worried face about the whole plan-making that he needs to do.
“I am just going to ignore that… I—um, we should head to class, the bell about is going to be ringing soon.” Draco stated.
“It went well. Dad and I did a lot of traveling and got to watch a lot of the quidditch games in person. How was your summer? The muggles didn’t give you too much trouble now did they?” Cedric looks down at Harry while his arms were wrapped around the boy.
“She suggested starting a club to practice Defense Against the Dark Arts, so we know how to protect and fight in the upcoming war. I was kind of surprised since they kind of doubted me that The Dark Lord was back since I was the only one to witness it,” Harry says as he walks over to the railing and looks up at the moon.
“You are not going to believe what I just saw! But you have to trust me! I was going to the changing room to get into my quidditch outfit for practice. Even though my whole team doesn’t practice for another hour. That’s not the point! The point is I saw Cedric in the changing room making out with some girl. I went in to see who it was because I wasn’t sure if it was you or not and I went and got a closer look, and it wasn’t you, so I quickly went to tell you what I saw! Well, after I drenched the two of them in water… but still!” Draco was talking fast but just slow enough for Harry to understand what Draco was saying.
“Are you Draco? You look like hell,” Harry says will a worried look on his face. Draco could tell that Harry was trying to hide the fact that he was worried but was failing.
“Yeah, sorry I don’t really know what you are implying,” Harry was very confused at this point. Draco groaned and grabbed Harry by the tie and pulled him into a kiss. The kiss only lasted for a few seconds before Draco pulled away and looked deeply into Harry’s eyes.
“Okay… so there was more discipline than just the cleaning,” Harry states as he fidgets with the sleeve on his left arm. Draco leans over to Harry and looked at the other’s left hand and wrist.
“I don’t know what you are talking-“Draco was cut off by Harry. Harry was honestly losing his temper.
All Harry did was nod. Cedric was right, since Voldemort is back; this year was going to be crazy. Breaks are going to be needed if Harry was going to keep what is left of his sanity.
Harry studied Draco’s face closely before narrowing his eye. “Is there something you haven’t told me yet that they are making fun of you about?” All Draco did was nod. “It must be a sensitive subject…” Harry paused for a moment. “Remember I won’t judge you about anything, but I would like to know, if you are okay with it, to maybe help you.”
Ron eventually agreed to it and the conversation ended up changing to something different and Harry started to space out. He wasn’t sure how to teach someone spells to defend himself. He started thinking back to all the advice he got for how to perform the Patronus charm. Harry looks over at the Slytherin table, by the door and sees Draco just starring at him. Harry remembered that they are meant to be going to the Astronomy Tower after dinner. Harry quickly nodded to Draco and turn to Hermione and Ron, quickly excuse himself.
“Awesome!” That was the only thing Draco can think of to say in the most awkward way possible with a big smile on his face.
“I’m all ears, what is the matter? Tell me.” Harry quickly said while putting his hands on Draco’s shoulder and gently squeezing them.
“Harry… I have known you long enough to tell when you are lying to me. Tell me about everything that happened,” Draco said as he began lightly tapping his foot. Not because he was impatient it was more because he knew that whatever he was about to hear he wasn’t going to like it. Draco tapping his foot was more of something while trying to stay calm and not get angry at what he might hear.
“Well, Harry, will you od me the honor of being my boyfriend?” Draco asked and then quickly added, “If it is not too soon from your last relationship that is.”
“Draco, wait!” Harry quickly followed after Draco. Calling his name out every now and then. Once they were in the hallway is when Harry was done chasing after Draco. This was his last chance to get Draco’s attention so he yelled, “I shouldn’t, but I need you!” Draco stopped dead in his track, heart racing as he turned and faced Harry.
“Um, Harry, what is with your hand?” Hermione Moved to try and get a better look at Harry’s left hand.
Harry started looking forward to his classes with Draco. Snape started getting really irritated and had to separate Draco and Harry many times in class because they would just not stop talking with each other and goofing around. Ron was starting to get jealous that he might be losing his best friend to someone who was a jerk to their friend group for years. That jealousy was quickly stopped once Ron was let in on Harry and Draco’s conversations. The three of them become decently close, at least they got a lot of new inside jokes between the three of them. And man did all the goofing around made Snape angrier by the day. Ron is still thinking Draco is up to something, but that was just a habit he would have to break once he learned to actually trust Draco.
“Oh, yeah I am up here? What took you so long? I was waiting for bloody ages” Harry called out. Draco walked up the stairs and saw Harry sitting on a red and white picnic blanket. Draco was slightly uncomfortable being in the tower since he hasn’t been in this place since… That one night.
“Don’t make me regret this Potter,” Draco blushed and looked away from Harry. Harry pulled Draco in close and hugged him.
“Don't even fucking say it. I'm no longer in the mood for any of this rubbish," Cedric says in a harsh tone, quickly leaving the area.
Draco snuck a bit closer to see who it was. He just knew this couldn’t be Ceric and Harry, but he had to make sure. There is where Draco saw that the person Cedric was making out with was Cho. Draco’s jaw dropped but he quickly closed it as he becomes angrier rather than shocked. Draco quickly pulled out his wand and turned on the shower Cho and Cedric were under, drenching the two. Draco quickly left the Changing room, making his way to find Harry to tell him what he saw. Draco was not going to let someone get away with cheating on his new friend.
“You must be pretty nervous…” Her voice was soft. She was genuinely concerned with her son and how he must be feeling. She actually didn’t want Draco to back to Hogwarts to go out of fear of what might happen, but since Draco wants to go, she will let him.
From this point on Things go on how it normally does in the books just with a few things different. Draco helped convince people that Voldemort was back and the club forms with Harry as the teacher. Draco would help teach others as well when he could while also practicing the spells Harry was teaching and having others practice. Not long after they became a couple, they told Ron and Hermione about them. Ron was extremely shocked, but Hermione saw it coming somehow. The fact Hermione saw it coming shocked Draco and Harry because they thought they were being really sneaky, but nothing can get past Hermione.
“It will be okay; I am sure of it. You are Harry Potter after all.” Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder and gently squeezed it. Draco wasn’t sure how to comfort people, so he was hoping that this was helping Harry in some way.
“You are so funny,” Cedric flirted. “How about you meet me in the courtyard after class today?” Cedric winked and the guy he was flirting with nodded.
“Please… Just leave me to think. I don’t want to believe you… I will just have to see for myself,” was all Harry said before going quiet. He was lost in thought and no longer wanted to speak at that time. He was hoping that Draco was wrong about this.
“Yes sir, very clear,” the three quickly barked out. When Snape turned back around the three let out a quiet sigh of relief. The lesson went on and the three tried not to get distracted. Draco can’t help it and sends Harry a note.
Draco was shocked yet was relieved when he saw the Dark Lord has been turned to dust. He looked over at his father’s face trying to read his expression. Draco could tell his father was just trying to keep his face blank, but his eye said everything. On one side his father was relieved that he no longer has to worry about the Dark Lord looking down on him… The other side was mad that things didn’t go according to plan. Draco felt his father’s grip tighten on his arm. Not daring to show weakness, he bit his tongue. Looking back at the school he made eye contact with Harry Potter.
Once the first two groups of people realized that Cedric and Harry were each other’s date there were a lot of shocked looks. People couldn’t believe their eyes. Cedric was open that he was not straight, but no one had seen him with a guy before tonight. People were mostly shocked that Harry wasn’t straight since it was obvious how much he crushed on Cho.
When it was time for the Yule ball Harry only had one person in mind. That was Cedric Diggory. Cedric just had his ways of speaking and acting that enchanted Harry. It was because of Cedric that Harry was questioning his sexuality. On one hand, he knew that he liked girls since he was crushing on Cho, but on the other, he couldn’t get Cedric out of his mind. Harry needed answers so he went looking for Cedric.
“It is a long story… It is not that I don’t want to tell you! Don’t get the wrong idea. It’s just that—let me start from the beginning,” Draco looks away from Harry and looks up at the moon. “Ever since I was young my father wasn’t the affectionate person and so to try and get his attention. I tried to do any that I could get his attention by doing the things that I thought he would approve of. That included being a big jerk to anyone who I wasn’t a pureblood. My father despised Mudbloods and so I lashed out at Hermione and tried to make fun of her any way that I could. My father wasn’t the guy who I thought he was. You see since The Dark Lord had come back the topic of me becoming a Death Eater had come up over the summer. My Father was trying to pressure me into becoming a Death Eater because it was greatly “benefit the family” which was such a lie. My father lied his way out of going to Azkaban and because he didn’t even try and find The Dark Lord, he is untrustworthy in the eyes of The Dark Lord, so he is trying to use me to get back on his good side. He really thought he could fool me but that was not going to happen. I am not an idiot,” Draco had paused for dramatic effect. “Plus, I was getting sick and tired of living for my father and not for myself. There was so much about me that no one knows about, and I wanted to share with others and stop hiding from others and especially myself.” Draco finished speaking and looked over at Harry who was stuffing his face with food, he looked to be hungry. The way he ate reminded Draco of the way Ron eats. Draco realized he should eat too before the bell chimed. So, Draco started eating.
In Harry's eyes, the night was so magical. He was starting to understand and accept the fact that he was not straight. He wasn’t aware of any of the terms in the LGBTQ+ community, but he knew the term Gay and Lesbian. That was one thing he knew that he was not, gay since he liked girls. He only recently realized he liked boys. Well, that he liked Cedric. The more that he talked with Cedric though is when he learned the terms Bisexual and Pansexual. That was something he was going to have to learn which one he was. Harry spent a lot of the time either with Cedric, chatting, and dancing or with Ron and his date Padma Patil.
“Do you really mean all of that? You’re not just pulling my leg, are you?” Harry says starring into Draco’s eye trying to study his expression.
“Bingo. I snapped at her, and I yelled, saying that she was lying about—HIM, not being back.” Harry finished.
“That is true, but some say your bright green eye color is even rarer than my grey eyes.” Cedric lightly squeezed Harry’s hands to get his full attention. Harry lightly tilted his head questioning what Cedric was doing. Cedric let go of one of Harry’s hands and moved his now free hand to Harry’s face. He cupped Harry’s cheek gently while rubbing his thumb against the other’s cheek. He pauses a moment before leaning in and kissing Harry.
One sunny day Draco and Harry were chilling on the Quidditch field. “And then I was like ‘I’m not going to bring her back, she got what was coming to her!’ haha, yeah that was a crazy accident. My aunt Marge was a jerk, to say the least,” Harry joked as he looked over at Draco. that was a mistake as Harry tripped on his own feet and instinctively went to grab something to not fall which only brought Draco down with him. Draco and Harry fell to the ground and there was a moment of silence before they erupted in laughter.
“Wh-what do you mean by that? Harry?” Draco was stunned. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry meant to say it in a mean way or not. Harry walked up to Draco, them both breathing heavily as they were out of breath. “Harry…” Draco teared up, thinking Harry meant it in a bad way.
“Draco Malfoy, I demand you to speak to me! I don’t really understand why you are running away from me and ignoring me. You are really being a prat!” Harry was annoyed and really upset. “You didn’t sound crazy. It is okay that you didn’t understand how you saved me. I… But I am still really grateful that you did!” Harry waiting for a response and Draco was frozen in place. A million thoughts rushed through Draco’s head. “What are you scared of Draco?”
Harry of course told Cho that he was already going with someone. Before Cho asked “who” he quickly told her that it was meant to be a surprise. Cho was confused and sighed before accepting that she would have to find someone else and leaving, letting Harry get to class.
“Well, I would be really concerned and ask you if everything was okay and if there was anything that you wanted to talk about—but with the way you are looking at me right now, that is not the case at all so, spill. Tell me everything. I promise I won’t get too mad,” Draco was concerned regardless but also upset at the same time. Draco then realized what he said and realized that there was something that he left out. “Just know that I am not pressuring you to tell me. I completely understand if you do not want to tell me something like this. Just know that I am here for you. When you are ready to talk about it, I will listen to it and try not to interrupt it too much just because I know I will get at least a little bit mad,” Draco added.
“I only did what I could to please you and you really didn’t like them, so I forced myself to hate them even though they have done nothing wrong. I have hurt a lot of people at Hogwarts by calling them mudbloods and by just being rude in general to them when they have done nothing to hurt me. And to be honest, I don’t think they deserve all of this hate. There is a muggle-born witch in my year who is basically good at everything. She is not that different from the rest of us. I don’t want to hurt any more witches and wizards just because they are not purebloods.” Draco took a deep breath and looked at his mother and father, reading their expressions. “I don’t want to become a Death Eater just so you can get back on Voldemort’s good side and I don’t want to become a Death Eater just to disappoint you when my morals get the better of me. I’m sorry I just can’t be… I can’t keep acting like this jerk that is trying to make his father proud when his father is already a really hard man to please. I am hurting myself trying to be someone that I am not. I’m done acting how you want me to act. For now, I am going to be me. A decent gay wizard who is accepting of everyone! I am not doing things for you anymore; I am doing them for me.” Draco was so happy to get that off his chest as he has been thinking about it for a long time now.
When Harry wakes, there’s a dull midday light spilling into his bedroom. He doesn’t usually sleep this late, but after yesterday, he was sort of expecting it. When he peeks at the alarm clock on the windowsill that doubles as a bedside table, there’s a very familiar barn owl perched on the ledge outside. Groaning, he swaddles himself in the duvet and lets it in.
“How’s your husband?” Draco asks. He actually sounds like he cares, if not about Ron, then about Hermione.
They’re in the kitchen now, and Mr Granger is pulling out a chair for him. He groans, first in relief, when he’s finally sitting down, and then in pain, when Ron lifts his foot onto the table. Hermione casts a cooling charm on his ankle, and the pain lessens enough that he’s able to think straight.
Draco visibly relaxes and takes the final steps towards him, leaning in for a hug that’s actually more about him leaning on Harry than anything else. Not that he minds. He drags him in even closer, and they stand there for a few seconds, just leaning on each other and breathing slowly.
“Bloody hell! That was awful! His hands were all over me! Do women really have to put up with this? I’ll never scoff at one of Hermione’s sexism rants again!” He conjures a tissue and starts wiping off the makeup.
With a last hoot, the bird takes flight, and he closes the window again. He turns around to find his clothes, and his eyes land on the shirt he borrowed from Draco. Reaching out, he runs his hand over the soft cotton, stroking it once. It’s such a pathetic, silly thing to do, but no one is here to see anyway, so he brings it to his face and nuzzles his nose into the fabric, inhaling the scent of clean cotton and Draco. He shakes his head and smiles to himself. Here he is, a grown man standing in the middle of his living room, in his underwear, sniffing a shirt. He knows it’s pathetic, especially since they’ve agreed that this isn’t going anywhere right now, which is the right decision, he reminds himself. Again. Mooning over a stupid, borrowed shirt isn’t helpful at all. He’s on his way into the bathroom to throw it in the hamper, but, at the last moment, he changes his mind and throws it on the bed instead. He probably won’t have time for laundry today anyway, and so what if he sleeps in it tonight? Snuggling with someone’s shirt is not completely creepy if they’re going to see where this mutual… thing they’ve discovered is going, is it? And Draco will never know, anyway.
He makes his way over the well kept but winter brown lawn, and pushes the door open. Hermione and Ron are sitting at the small kitchen table with mugs of tea in front of them. They’d looked up as he entered, but their heads are still close together, and Hermione is clasping Ron’s hand. She still looks a bit stressed, Harry thinks, but Ron smiles at him and offers a nod in greeting. He gently extracts his hand from her hold and uses it to maneuver a huge pastry into his mouth.
“Protego!” Matt goes down, but not before he’s thrown a shield in front of Bludger, who’s jumping to his feet and grabbing a canvas tote from the floor. Harry watches as he turns on his heel to Disapparate, but instead of vanishing, he overbalances and stumbles into the table. The bag rolls away from him with a metallic clank and Harry spots a glimpse of gold.
Savage uses her wand to project images from the crime scene onto the wall: the responding DMLE officers standing guard against the door leading out of the cluttered bedroom, and he spots Cho Chang in her lime green healer robes apparating in with the medical team. Not that there’s anything they’ll be able to do, Harry thinks. The man lying on the bed is definitely dead. There’s blood everywhere.
Harry does his best to keep his face neutral. The question is innocent enough, after all. If you don’t know Donovan, that is.
“Yeah...” Donovan lifts his cup to take a sip, and Harry moves away, but he still hears the muttered “he’ll be staying home for a really fucking long time, if he’s still a Squib.”
For a few seconds, he can’t move. Draco is halfway to the door, when he shakes himself out of his stupor and breaks into a run to catch up.
“I know. A counter statement would’ve been a good start, but Cadogan didn’t bother getting one before he locked Draco up for the night. And I don’t think it’s going to count, if I get one. I’m too biased.”
They say their goodbyes, and Ron grabs Hermione’s hand. She turns back, her hand already resting on the door knob. “I'll meet you tomorrow at the ministry, so we can get ready before the match. Draco, you’re taller than me, so you'll have to disillusion your feet when we're under the cloak.”
“Yeah. Sure. Mind if I put some clothes on first?” Ron steps out from behind the fridge door. He’s naked, and clutching a jug of milk, which he’s placed strategically in front of his groin. Harry rapidly averts his eyes.
Malfoy gestures to a couple of plastic chairs along one side of the table, and motions for them to sit down.
“Protego!” Hermione yells, but the curse is already cutting through the air. It slides off the shield in front of Draco, and is deflected right toward where he’s hiding. He acts on pure instinct, curls up in a tiny ball behind his small stone hideaway, with the package cradled protectively against his chest. There’s a deafening crack that leaves his ears ringing, as the stones in front of him splinter. He feels the package starting to slide out of his hands, and desperately grasps at the torn pillowcase with numb fingers. And then there’s Draco’s arm around him and Hermione’s voice in his ear telling him that she’s got his wand, and the sickening tug behind his navel that tells him that they’re Disapparating.
He looks around carefully, and then slips out from under the cloak, just as the whistle is blown and the match starts.
“I’m going to pick up Rose now,” she says. “I’m getting curry on the way. Do you want to join us, Harry?”
Oh! Right. They step into the bedroom and Ron closes the door behind them. Harry’s relieved to see that the body has been moved. But other than that, nothing has been touched since yesterday. They can hear Hermione casting the spell, followed by a hasty shield charm. Then there is a loud rustling, followed by a series of heavier thumps, and another spell.
They’re early enough that there’s still a bit of weak twilight–enough to make out the general outline of their surroundings, but not enough to see any details. Ron nods at a square, hut-like building at the top of the hill, then turns and points at a large rock some ten metres away. Harry nods. They make their way there slowly, careful not to bend any shrubbery or disturb any birds or animals. Then they crouch down behind the rock and wait.
“She’s set up a date for me. Says this bloke she’s working with has been asking about me and she wants me to meet him for coffee.”
Harry looks up at him and… yes. He’s slim, lightly toned and well dressed. If Harry had been with enough blokes to have a type, this would be it. The man smiles at him, revealing straight, white teeth.
Savage isn’t in her office, but Harry finds her in the conference room, when he makes his way back to his cubicle. She’s sitting alone, going through a presentation.
“They must have come from his family home. Do you think the drawing next to the body came from one of the books?”
Harry grins back, and a fraction of the weight that’s been lodged inside his chest these past few days lifts.
Ron doesn’t get as far as the bar before there’s a sudden drop in volume in the room. At the same time, Harry feels the buzzing of the alarm on his ID badge. He pulls it out of his pocket, just like every other Auror in the room, and when he sees the faint red glow surrounding the previously dull brass, he turns on the spot, with the loud pops of his colleagues’ Disapparation ringing in his ears.
Of course. Lucius Malfoy doesn’t do favours for anyone, not even his own son. When he chances a quick glance, Draco looks paler than before, and he’c clenching his jaw so hard the muscle is bouncing. That look is a bit too familiar, he realises. An image of a flooded bathroom, with water being tinted red by blood, is flashing through his mind in a split second. He takes a deep breath, intending to answer Lucius’ question, but before he can say anything, there’s a hand on his arm. He looks down in disbelief, and sees Draco’s fingers rest on his sleeve. The heat from his touch makes his skin tingle.
Draco nods. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. You’re a grown man. It’s not anyone else’s decision to make.”
“I hope you’ll excuse the mess,” he says. “This doubles as our lunch room and the assistants seem to be completely unable to keep horizontal surfaces free of clutter. And we can’t use magic, because it interferes with the traces of ancient spellwork on the artefacts.”
George’s face transform into a gleeful grin. “Oi! Ginny! Angelina! Come and say hello to Harry and his new girlfriend!”
“You shouldn’t go alone,” Ron says. “It’s too risky. Besides, there’s no way in hell Savage’ll allow it.”
“Yes. It’s the prototype. The first broom with a Horton-Keitch Braking Charm to ever leave the CTC factory. My grandfather paid a small fortune for it. He was a great Falcons fan. But, the story goes, he only flew it a few times. Never got used to the braking system. He was a bit old fashioned.”
They apparate to the back entrance of Borgin and Burkes, and Harry spends a few seconds making sure that he’s completely covered by the cloak.
The bar is almost empty. There’s an old witch behind the bar, and two portly wizards discussing their gardens. When they enter, all eyes turn to them, and Harry momentarily regrets that he didn’t transfigure his Auror robes into something less conspicuous before they came in. But, just as quickly, everyone turns back to their own drinks and conversations. Apparently, this is a mind your own business sort of place. He only realises how tense he’s been when he feels his shoulders drop in relief.
He finds Ron and Hermione in the least classified area of the Department of Mysteries, where even lowly Aurors have access. Hermione is engrossed in the diary with a few of her colleagues. Ron is sitting in a chair, surrounded by a gaggle of Curse-breakers and Unspeakables. One look at him confirms that he’s trying–and failing–to control his temper. When one of the Unspeakables pokes him in the ribs with her wand while casting a charm on him, he jumps from the chair.
"Come 'round for breakfast tomorrow and I'll show you?" She smiled at him. The expression was so earnest and concerned that all of a sudden it didn't matter how much of a nag she could be sometimes.
Harry is awake unusually early for a Sunday. A cold draft is seeping under the duvet where he’s stupidly kicked it off during the night. He gathers it closer around him, burrowing into the hot cocoon. He’s not really ready to leave his very nice dream of kisses and soft, blond hair and broad shoulders behind. A sound penetrates his lovely, worry-free state of half sleep. There’s an owl trying to get in. Again. A very stubborn owl, he decides, after ignoring it for about thirty seconds to no avail. He drapes the crumpled duvet around his body and goes to open the window. A gust of icy wind and Hermione’s barn owl sweeps into the room, and Harry slams the window shut. The owl drops a letter on the table, and perches on top of one of his chairs, staring disapprovingly at the closed window. He hurries to open it again, and the owl hoots at him, but stays where it is.
“Yes,” the tall man drawls. "My research suggests that this is indeed the chalice we’ve been looking for.” Harry frowns. It’s hard to hear over the crackling on the Extendable Ear, but that voice... He leans a bit closer to the window, trying to get a look at the face under the hood. A dry twig of heather crunches under his foot.
The house has been Disillusioned, but as soon as Draco has pointed it out, Harry sees it. A warm yellow, two storey building with white windows. It looks… friendly. Cosy, almost, when compared to the Manor.
It still hurts like hell that Draco has been willing to throw everything away like that. But it makes sense, somehow. Harry shudders. The feeling of Voldemort’s presence inside his mind, slithering around, prying through the memories of his most private moments, is not something he’ll ever forget.
“That’s disgusting. And I’m stuck. Could we go over this together and see if you spot something I’ve missed?”
He Floos home after having put Rose to bed and having an awkward cup of tea. He’s barely slumped into his favourite armchair, when the Floo flares to life.
The DMLE is almost empty this time of night. The only ones there are the night shift, and they all look like they’re bored out of their minds. Perhaps the icy rain outside is keeping even the criminals home tonight. Two of the officers are playing Exploding Snap at the front desk, and a few are sitting around the wireless with their tea mugs in hand, listening to Percy and his opponent bickering over cuts in the St Mungo’s funding. Only one officer looks up, when Harry walks past, and his nod is returned with a small wave and a murmured ‘good evening’.
Savage takes off her reading glasses and leans forward in her comfortable leather chair. She rests her arms on her desk and levels Harry with a look that makes it perfectly clear that she wants this conversation to end. Now.
Draco is sitting crosslegged on the narrow wooden bench, his elbows resting on his knees, and his scruffy chin cradled in his hands. He seems to be staring at a spot on the floor, but his hair is falling over his eyes, hiding them from view.
“No. I’ll wait until the game starts. It’ll buy me some extra time. Besides, it’ll help me build my credibility. I’ll tell them my mum didn’t want me to go to the match.”
It doesn’t take long to levitate the prisoners and let Hestia and Williamson know what’s happened, and that they’ll come home as soon as Draco’s up for it. A few minutes later, they’re alone.
He’s barely landed in the huge fireplace in the reception, before the smell of hospital permeates the air and intensifies his post-Floo nausea. He’s hated the smell ever since the end of the war. It reminds him of too many visits at the bedsides of friends and Order members; some had made it out of here, and some hadn’t.
“I’ll send for a team to pick them up. You’re not fit to Apparate or Floo.” And I’m not going anywhere without you, he finishes silently.
Harry leans in to kiss that smirky smile off his mouth. Draco meets him half way. His lips are hungry, almost forceful, and Harry finds himself being grabbed by the wrists and pushed back against the cushion, his head framed by lean, lightly tanned forearms, and his vision obscured by strands of blond hair.
“Oh, leave them be,” chides a young girl in a glittering robe. “Young Draco’s hardly the first to bring a Blood Traitor into the house. Your great uncle Hector was a Weasley, wasn’t he?”
Harry pauses to cast a Concealment Charm, and wishes that he’d brought his cloak with him.  He’s not really meant to use it at work, but Savage probably won’t mind. Maybe. Besides, the rules are a little more bendable, when they’re dealing with SDEA cases.
Harry watches as Malfoy straightens up, but it’s obvious that he’s still a bit wobbly. He rests a hand on the nearest lamppost and turns his face into the wind.
“It’s probably not dangerous! The Head of Department wouldn’t have let them do it if it was,” the young man says earnestly.
“Oh!” Harry fiddles with his tea cup. He suspects this is one of those things he should know, except his primary school years were spent trying to avoid getting beaten up by Dudley. Which made it hard to focus on actually learning things.
Draco walks over to where Ron is admiring a gleaming, antique racing broom, mounted on the wall over the fireplace. Harry follows him. It’s easy to see from the slightly frayed bristles and the shape of the footrests that the broom is old, but it’s shining as if it has been polished just yesterday. It probably has.
He snaps his head up, just in time to see the two Seekers speed toward the ground, chasing the Snitch. It zooms back up right in front of the tribune, and the players follow it, so close to the stands that the tail ends of their brooms almost hit Bludger in the face.
If they’re bickering like this, things can’t be too bad, Harry thinks. It’s such a relief that Ron seems okay that he’s almost forgotten about Draco. Almost. There’s still a small knot of something lodged behind his solar plexus.
He finds a newer pair of jeans and a dark green wooly jumper. Then he rummages through the bathroom cabinet. He thinks he's seen... Yes. There it is. The hair potion Philippe bought for him over a year ago. He breaks the seal on the bottle and wets his fingers. Then he runs them through his hair, before examining the result in the mirror. It still looks a bit messy. But more in a windswept sort of way, and less like he's been struck by lightning.
Dartmoor is too windy to rely on the Invisibility Cloak, but Harry decides to bring it along anyway. He folds it up and puts it in the inner pocket of his uniform cloak before lifting it off the hook on the wall and throwing it on. Ron pokes his head around the partition. Harry is relieved to see that he looks a lot calmer than he did when they left Savage’s office. The anger has been replaced with grim determination.
Ron is already conjuring one of his Muggle evidence bags, when Harry spots the pendant. It’s almost obscured by the blood, but the engraving is the same as on the cuff link. A snake writhing around the stem of a cup or trophy.
“Yeah. But we need to be quick about it, don’t we? That Wright business was too messy. The Aurors are goin’ to come snoopin’.” And that’s got to be Bludger.
Ron goes back outside, careful not to let any of the cats escape. Harry takes a closer look at the sitting room. It has a bay window with fluffy, chintz armchairs and a chaise longue that look like they belong in a much larger room. There’s a dining area towards the back, filled with furniture that seems to be made for grander surroundings. Everything is neat and orderly.
Draco’s still limping slightly, but he refuses to use a cane, so Harry stays close enough that he’ll be able to grab his elbow if needed. He hasn’t told him why, but Harry secretly thinks it’s because he doesn’t want to look like his father. Not that he does. Harry looks at the man at his side. Draco is wearing his usual work attire of khakis and sturdy boots, insisting that they make a slight detour on the way to Malfoy Manor to take a look at his neglected excavation. Even Hermione’s constant reassurances and Martin and Catherine’s visit yesterday hasn’t been enough to reassure him that he can take a few more days to recuperate before going back.
"I'll see what I can do." Savage gives him a small smile and rustles her papers to indicate that the conversation is over. Harry nods. His hand is already at the door handle, when Savage calls after them.
It is his fault. But she doesn’t need his guilt trip right now, so he bites down on his answer, and just holds her a little tighter. She squeezes him back for a moment, and lets go.
Adrienne’s home is the polar opposite to her brother’s in many ways. For a brief moment, Harry feels like he has stepped into Umbridge’s old office. There is a lot of floral patterned chintz and doilies. And cats. Lots of cats. A fat, white one winds itself around his legs and purrs loudly.
“I can teach you the spell, if you want. But it’s rather complicated, so it might take a while. Or I could go with you and cast it. I’m sure Molly won’t mind looking after Rose.”
“Harry?” Ron shakes his shoulder, and he straightens up. There’s a bit of a drool spot on his forearm, where he’s been resting his head. But, luckily, the casefile underneath is dry. He wipes at the corner of his mouth.
Fifteen minutes later, they’re back in the air. The wind that was pushing against them on the way here is pushing them forward, making it easier to focus on flying steadily. Harry keeps the course even, and pulls his broom close to Draco’s. Close enough that they can talk, but also close enough that he can grab Draco’s broom and keep it steady if he needs to. The fact that Draco doesn’t tell him off for coddling him, along with the way he grips his broom with both hands, steering a bit to the right to counteract the way he’s leaning to his left, trying to keep pressure off his wounded leg speaks volumes. They’re just spotting Dover in the distance, when Draco speaks up.
They apparate into Bludger’s brother’s garden, and Harry barely has time to find his feet, before he’s overtaken by a violent shiver. The wind that whips through his hair and presses the freezing cold, humid air through his robes carries the smell of the ocean. He can hear the waves crashing onto the rocks on the shore behind the small cottage and the attached shed, which looks like it might blow away in the wind. There’s nothing here but seagulls and yellow, half dead grass. He shivers again, fighting the urge to wrap his arms around his body for heat.
“I will never understand you! I knew Ron and Harry were immature, but honestly, Draco. I thought you at least were an adult.” Hermione has her hands on her hips, but the smile she’s sending Ron is brilliant. Her gaze shifts to Harry’s feet, and he feels his toes clench even before she draws her wand. The charm that hits him makes his socks slightly damp for a second, and then his shoes are a lot whiter and less scruffy than they’ve been for years. He wiggles his toes. Urgh. They even feel new and uncomfortable.
Hermione is standing in Adrian Wright’s small living room with her hands on her hips and her feet slightly apart. It looks like the beginning of a duelling stance, and Harry can’t really blame her. There are bits of paper and parchment everywhere.
"Let's try this again, then," Harry says. "Tell me everything you know about the Chalice of Infinite Magic."
When he pops back into the cell a few minutes later, Brigg is obviously nervous. Ron, on the other hand, looks perfectly calm and collected, sitting back with his legs crossed, polishing an invisible speck from the shiny boot resting against his thigh. harry puts the vial of potion on the table in front of him. Ron grins.
“This is what’s in it for you, Father,” Draco says. His voice is steady, but his tone is clipped, and his accent is sharper than ever before. “I have been doing my very best to rebuild this family’s name and reputation, but my efforts are thwarted every time someone reminds the public that the head of the family is rotting away in prison. Now, if it were to become public knowledge that you’d assisted Harry Potter with a very high profile case, then my efforts might finally start paying off.”
Interrogating Smith turned out to be more or less a waste of time. Harry shudders at the memory of the fanatic glint in Smith’s eyes. The little shit hadn't managed to give him much to go on; only a couple of first names of group members, and some locations where they met. But his ramblings about pure-bloods taking over the world, and putting Muggle-borns in their rightful place had sounded too much like something Harry’s heard before, through ears that weren’t quite his own.
As they approach the Apparition point, he has to make more and more of an effort to appear careless and happy. This is the point where their plan is most likely to fall apart. If Bludger doesn’t give clear instructions for where to Apparate, or if he somehow fails to Side-Along Hermione and Draco… He tries to shake it off, but by the time they reach the small stand of shrubs and bushes, he’s as pumped on adrenaline as before any other mission, and the loud singing is difficult to hear over the sound of his heartbeat in his ears. A strong, invisible hand catches his wrist for a brief moment, and brushes against his palm. It’s enough to snap him back into reality, and make him wish he could actually hold Draco’s hand. Then they step into the roughly circular path where the grass is worn away by the shoes of hundreds of witches and wizards turning to Disapparate.
He almost barrels right into Ron in the Atrium. He’s spelling away something that looks like either snot or porridge from his sleeve, so Harry guesses that it was his turn to get up early with Rose this morning.
“I don’t know what this is, but it’s not a traditional crest. There are certain elements in all the old families crests, and they’re missing in this drawing. I have a copy of Nature’s Nobility if you want to look it up, but I think it’s more likely that it’s a symbol of sorts.”
A wizard with a walrus moustache and a traditional pointy hat on top of his blond head is less subtle.
He covers them with the Cloak, and they sneak back towards the house. When they’re half way up the path, the door opens. Mr Brigg looks around before he steps outside, and makes his way to the shed.
“I’m sure you will. The magic in a Pensieve is not triggered by the person watching. It’s triggered by the reaction of the Pensieve liquid and the memory. Besides, even if it was triggered by a person, it should be enough that one of the people watching has magic.”
“Yeah. I might be the idiot who grabbed a cursed cup and got his magic stolen, but I’m still the reasonable one around here. ‘Mione’s invited Malfoy.”
“Who the fuck made you the boss?” Matt mutters, but he starts stacking the stones more carefully.  The hole grows rapidly, and a few minutes later, Bludger starts rummaging in his pockets. He takes out a small, unassuming package. It’s square, flat and wrapped in an old pillowcase with bubbling cauldrons on it. He sets it down on the pile of stones and points his wand at it.
Harry casts a glance at the parchment. The Magical Branch of the British Museum is located on the lawn to the right of the main entrance, it says in a neat cursive that he vaguely remembers from Malfoy’s hate-notes in school.
“Right. And we should make a list of all the possible times and places where a lot of Muggleborns are gathered too. See if we can find out when they’re going to strike… Draco, can I use your quill?”
Ron looks a bit pale, but he’s beaming. He also has his arm slung around Hermione, and looks at her like she’s hung the moon. She looks frazzled and a bit tired, but so relieved that she’s probably only standing because of Ron’s arm around her.
“Brilliant! Now, tell me what’s going on with the case. You went to Azkaban. Did you go alone?” A haunted looks crosses Ron’s face. “Wait! They didn’t partner you with someone else already, did they? Because that’s just bollocks! I’ve only been gone for a week!”
"Thank you. I've had a lot of practise. I used to get sunburned all the time, when I worked in the Mediterranean."
The kiss is gentle. Almost like a question–do you want this too–though Harry doesn’t really know if he’s the one asking. He fully expects Draco to wrench himself free, but God, he smells so good, like fresh cotton and man, and Harry can’t help himself. He leans forward on the chair and deepens the kiss, almost groaning at the first, intoxicating taste. Draco’s scent and taste blend together and invade his senses, making him light headed and giddy. And suddenly it’s not a matter of who is kissing whom, but something they are sharing. He runs a hand up Draco’s neck, enjoying the warm skin under his palm and the shiver his touch is inducing. He threads fingers through the short hair at his nape, marveling at the silky feel of it. Draco gasps and arches his head back into his hand. Harry pulls back from the kiss enough to take a deep breath. Draco rests his forehead against his.
The awkward silence after Ron leaves makes Harry squirm in his seat. Mr Brigg just sits there, glancing through the window towards the sea, like he’d rather be taking a brisk walk, than sitting here. Finally the silence becomes too much for him.
He should probably say something to that. Something deep enough to acknowledge what Malfoy’s shared, but subtle enough that he won’t be embarrassed. But the words just won’t come.
Ron looks up and smiles at Hermione. “Research is top priority right now. ‘Mione, you and Malfoy should probably be in charge of this part, since you both have access to libraries.” He grimaces. “I’m sorry I can’t do anything to help.”
His boots clatter so loudly on the stone floor that he wakes the snoring receptionist. She sends him a nasty scowl, but he hardly notices, as he walks past the fountain of the Magical Brethren. As soon as he’s out of the Atrium, he breaks into a full on run. He almost barrels into Donovan on the stairs.
There's a bright fire illuminating the marble floor and the pale blue walls, and the well polished wood of the grand staircase is gleaming in the warm light. He hears Hermione step out of the fire, but doesn’t turn to offer her a hand, because Draco is walking down the stairs and he looks… He looks gorgeous. His hair is falling over his eyes and he’s wearing jeans and a soft looking dark grey shirt, but that’s not the biggest difference. Draco is carrying himself with perfect ease, and Harry realises just how tense and guarded he has been the last few times they’ve met. Not to speak of the haunted boy he remembers from his school days.
Ron laughs. “Good one, Malfoy!” He elbows Harry lightly in the ribs. “I can’t believe you actually got pissed on, mate! I can’t wait to tell people at work!”
“Listen!” he spits through clenched teeth. “This is just a friendly chat. The only thing we can charge you with is the possession of contraband potion ingredients. That’ll give you a slap on the wrist. A few months at the most. But we’re investigating a SDEA case. Do you know what that means? It means I barely have to say the word before someone is here with a vial of Veritaserum, and I can make you spill all your dirty little secrets. And you’ll be charged with all of it! So I suggest you tell me what I need to know, or I’ll make you tell me everything!”
There are four people in the room, that he can see. Possibly more, but he doesn’t want to risk getting too close to the window.  He fumbles for Ron and carefully presses four fingers into his arm, one at the time. They’re all wearing black, hooded robes, and Harry almost laughs out loud. What a fucking cliché!
“I see.” He’s always imagined that someone who’s been in Azkaban for a long time would sound hoarse and broken. But Lucius doesn’t sound like someone who has been rotting away in a prison cell for years. His voice is as smooth and perfectly modulated as ever. He tilts his head a little, and stares at Harry like he’s a particularly unpleasant potions ingredient. “And exactly what kind of… favour is it that you’re hoping my son will provide you, Mr Potter?”
“It’s possible. But we’d have to match all the ripped out pages with the books to find out. It’d take forever, and probably lead to nothing.” Harry takes off his glasses and rubs at the pressure points where they’ve been digging into his nose. The idea of using hours matching scraps of paper doesn’t seem particularly attractive.
Harry checks that Rose is sleeping, and tiptoes back to the sofa. He itches to pour himself a healthy dram, but he has fucked up badly enough as it is. Drinking while babysitting is taking it one step too far, even for him, and even if these last days have been a lot more hectic than usual. How long has Ron been at St Mungo’s now? He ticks the days off on his fingers. It’s Tuesday, so... five days! Has it really been almost a week?
“I agree with Hermione. A Pensieve  is just a magical substance. Like a potion that you submerge yourself in. Most potions work on Squibs. Even on Muggles.” He shrugs. “But maybe it’s better if we take turns, if you’ll be more comfortable that way.”
“Morning! Good shift?” He nods at the scorch marks on her sleeve, and she grins up at him. She has a black smudge across one cheek, and her hands look like she’s been using them to clean a fireplace.
“Hah! This time they almost had you,” Tall Bloke grins. Harry joins in, and gets a kick in the leg from Bludger for his trouble.
"Yes. I do. I had to invent it after Rose ripped half my books to shreds while Ron was supposed to watch her." The last sentence is sort of shouted in Ron’s direction, and he looks up with a sheepish smile before returning to his conversation with Seamus. It involves a lot of hand gestures and a few coasters and bottles, presumably illustrating Quidditch moves.
“Shut up, Matt! Leave Jamie alone, and help me out.” Bludger is kicking at the stone slabs in one of the ancient walls. “We’ll cast a water repellent charm on it and stick it in here.”
Then it disappears. He can feel it rush past him and towards Draco. The air shimmers and twists, and a curl of dark smoke rises towards the high ceiling. Then nothing. The absence of magic feels like a breath of cool, clean air on a hot summer day. Harry lowers his wand.
“He told me that he’d pay me. He told me where I could find some things he’d hidden during the war, and he said I’d get more if I helped him.”
“No sign of the perpetrator. We locked the Floo for incoming traffic as soon as the medical team got here. Healer Chang and her team are just finishing up. We’ll escort them back through and lock for outgoing.”
He tells them everything, from the moment the owl woke him up, to Ron stunning him. When he falls silent, his friends just sit there, looking at him for what feels like hours. Finally, Ron clears his throat.
“No. They’re standing by and you can call them when you’re there, if you think it’s necessary. We couldn’t find the house, you see…”
“How’s the Unspeakable thing going anyway?” He grins at Ron and raises his glass in a silent toast. “Can I ask her about it, or is she going to Obliviate me just for talking about it?”
Harry doesn’t know what he expected the excavation to look like, but it isn’t this. They pop into existence at the edge of the anti-Apparition boundary that Hermione has set up. An assistant wearing muddy wellies is waiting for them. He asks them not to cast any spells, and to only step on the wooden boards laid out for easy wheel barrow access. Most of the excavation site is deserted, but an area has been shielded from the elements by a huge tent. The assistant pulls the flap aside, and gestures for them to step through. Harry blinks at the sudden bright light inside, struggling to adjust.
When they get back to Level Two, the Polyjuice is starting to wear off. Ron shrugs on his robes and slumps in his chair.
Finally the interoffice memo plane swoops through the small slot at the top of the door. He plucks it from the air, and smirks.
He raps on the door to Ron’s room, and waits for the muffled invitation, before he enters. Ron is sitting up in bed, wearing a pair of purple pyjamas with small snitches on them. Harry remembers his face, when he had seen him open the gag gift from George. That had been the first Christmas Harry had spent at Ron and Hermione’s after they’d moved into their cottage, and the first Christmas after the war that George’s smile had reached his eyes.
Hermione pokes him gently in the back, and Harry realises that he’s been staring–again. Draco must think he’s a total idiot, the way he keeps falling off the face of the earth whenever he moves or talks or… yeah. He’s utterly fucked.
The young mediwizard behind the counter looks up and waves as they pass. Harry’s been making more visits to St. Mungo’s in the past week than ever before. Sometimes alone, and in the last few days, sometimes escorting Narcissa Malfoy. Contrary to his previous visits to the hospital, he doesn’t really mind. Especially not today. Because today, he’s got Draco’s bag slung over his shoulder, and Draco walking next to him to the Floo. Except Draco has stopped to look at the screen on the wall in the waiting area, where they’re showing scenes from Percy’s victory party. Statistics from different districts, Percy waving at a group of happy volunteers and a flustered looking Molly in a new dress. Draco turns to him and he shrugs. Percy will get four more years as Minister. But he won’t have the unlimited power that the Chalice offers. It might not be ideal, but it’s good enough for now. A lot can happen in four years, Harry thinks. But right now, that’s not really important.
Bludger is inside with two of his mates. They haven’t bothered with robes this time, just filthy jeans and faded quidditch shirts and bottles of cheap lager. They look like they’ve Apparated here directly from the pub. One of them is so tall that the Tornadoes shirt he’s wearing reveals a strip of pasty-looking belly fat. The other, Harry recognises from the Beheaded Goblin. He’s young, chubby and unnaturally tanned for winter. He’s wearing a gold chain around his neck and a pair of jeans so baggy they seem like they might drop around his ankles at any moment.. His beefy arms are covered in tattoos, and not exactly the kind that could be considered works of art. Some of them look like he’s spelled them on himself. They’re talking, and Harry roams in his pocket for the Disillusioned Extendable Ear he grabbed from the department. It’s not easy to unroll it by feel, but he manages, and feeds it through the same crack he and Ron used.
“Savage signed off on it,” Harry says. He doesn’t know where the odd need to defend Malfoy comes from, but he finds himself wanting to convince Ron that Malfoy isn’t that bad. “Besides, I’m actually glad I brought him. He was the one who persuaded his father to give up the memory.”
“Yes, Rosie. You have to wear socks. It’s cold. Look! There’s snow on the ground,” comes Hermione’s weary reply. This is obviously a conversation which has been going on for some time.
“It’s disturbing that you’re smiling like that when you’re thinking about your wife punching someone in the face, you know,” he says.
“You won’t finish anything by sleeping at your desk. I promised to meet George for a pint after work. Come with us!”
Despite the circumstances, Harry finds his lips curling up in a small smile. “Come on, Draco! It’s not that bad. She didn’t write anything embarrassing. Just that she knew we are… what was it? Oh yes, ‘on friendly terms these days,’ and that she hoped I’d be able to help you.”
“Right, then. I’ll cast the spell to repair all the books, and then I’ll cast another one to identify any books or scrolls with missing pages.” She looks over her shoulder at them. “You should wait outside.”
A small silver vase flies into his hand. He transfigures it into a pair of scissors, and cuts all the way around Draco’s thigh, making the ripped fabric fall away and leaving Draco’s leg exposed from his mid thigh down. He checks Draco over again. His face is white, and his breathing is getting shallow. He must have lost more blood than Harry thought. Fuck! He hopes Fifi hurries with the Potion!
“Here you are. It’ll be a bit crowded, but I think there’s room for all of us to watch at the same time.”
“Because it won’t harm you.” Harry doesn’t have to look at Hermione to know that she’s rolling her eyes. “You’re a pure-blood.”
“That sounds reasonable,” Draco agrees. “I’ll try to identify the curses, and contact you if I need help.”
What the fuck is happening? Death Eater activity? Draco isn’t a Death Eater. He needs to get to the Ministry, right now. He grabs the first items of clothes he can find and throws them on, rips his uniform robes from the hanger and pulls them over his head, already walking towards the fireplace.
And then the searing pain is gone, replaced by a sudden numbness. Draco is staring at him with his wand still raised. Harry stares back.
“I hope nothing happened to the stone altar!” she says. “You’ve been working on that section for weeks!”
Draco clears his throat and nods at the Pensieve that’s been set up on a low table next to his desk.
The Floo at Malfoy Manor is in the entrance hall. The dark blue hearth rug is soft enough to mask the sound of Harry’s clumsy exit from the fireplace. He steps to the side to unblock the path for Hermione and looks around as he brushes a few specks of ash away from his jumper. Admittedly, he didn't spend a lot of time looking at his surroundings when he was dragged here by the snatchers, but he's fairly sure that the room didn't look this bright and inviting.
Hermione puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes it lightly. “Please, Harry. Ron’s going to be fine! Just…” She turns to Draco. “Get his leg fixed and keep him from doing something stupid,” she adds. Then she’s gone and the door closes with a gentle click.
It’s hard to see the blood against the dark wool of his trousers, but there’s already a red smudge on the floor, where his leg is resting. When he touches Draco’s leg, his hands come away wet. He rips the fabric and his stomach turns at the sight of the deep, uneven gash. Remembering his emergency first aid training, he lifts the leg and presses his hands down above the wound, trying to slow the bleeding.
It’s almost noon the next day, when they finally find themselves huddling under cloaks and Impervious Charms in a tiny boat on the North Sea. The forbidding rock that houses Azkaban looms on the horizon, and, as they get closer, the air seems to get even more icy, as if the Dementors are still here, lurking in the low, dark clouds that cover the island. Malfoy seems to sink even further into his warm cloak, his shoulders coming up around his ears, and his face almost as pale and grim as Harry remembers it from sixth year.
“Yes. Perhaps. I don’t know exactly. The snake is a traditional symbol of Dark magic. Or dangerous knowledge. The cup might be a chalice. A vessel which is used to hold something valuable. Does that help?” Hermione gives them a hopeful look.
“Someone will be here to take care of the cats as soon as we clear the scene. And they’ve sent an MLE officer out to buy cat food. He’ll feed them in the hall. Hopefully that’ll keep them occupied for a while.”
Savage casts a drying charm on the scroll she was signing when they came in, rolls it up and holds it out for Harry to take.
“Yeah. Besides, it’s probably best not to disturb them. Unspeakable Granger doesn’t really like to be disrupted.”
“I feel at home here. I used to rent a room from a Muggle family, back when I was in uni. I saw it as something of an anthropological experiment. I even changed my name for a while. Draco Spinks... I wanted it to sound more Muggle, but in the end I realised it just sounded ridiculous." Asmall smile is playing on his lips, and he lifts a shoulder in a lobsided shrug. "The kitchen was my favourite room in their house. It was always warm, and it reminded me of a potions lab, somehow.”
Ron frowns. “From the way you were just staring at his arse, I think ‘all right’ is a bit of an understatement.”
Mr Granger nods and disappears. Harry can hear his footsteps on the stairs. Draco gets a glass from one of the top cupboards and runs the tap for a few seconds to get the water properly cold. He sticks his hand under the stream of water to test the temperature, before he fills the glass and turns the tap off. On the way back, he tears off a paper towel to use as a coaster for the glass.
Draco leads him past the quiet hall into a different wing. Things are darker here. The corridors are lit by torches that flare up when they come near them and die out behind them. As far as Harry can tell, it’s as pristine as the rest of the Manor, but the air is cold and clammy, and there’s a musty smell, like this part of the house isn’t in regular use. In fact, the atmosphere here is much more like he remembers Malfoy Manor from before. A portrait of a haughty looking blond, dressed in something that looks suspiciously like a less moth-eaten version of Ron’s old dress robes, is glaring at them as they pass. Harry can’t help a shiver running down his spine, and suddenly he’s very glad that Hermione isn’t here. Her memories of this place are even worse than his.
“He apologised to you?” Harry has to ask. Just to be sure he heard right, because he can’t really imagine Malfoy apologising to anyone.
“I wasn’t actually planning on asking. She’ll just take me off the case and hand it over to one of the more experienced teams.”
“Neither do I”, Draco says. “I’m not sure something like that should even exist… It has too great a potential for evil.”
“Yes. Sorry. I didn’t think… Sorry.” Harry stammers, and immediately wishes he’d kept his mouth shut. “I’ll help too, if I can.”
George nods. “Yeah. Those new regulatory laws on magical experimentation are making it damn near impossible to be inventive. It’s illegal to brew potions that are not on the Ministry’s approved list. It used to be the other way around, but apparently people need to be protected from their own stupidity more than they need new solutions to their problems.”
“Sorry. Just going downstairs.” There’s no way he’s telling Donovan why he’s rushing down to the cells in the middle of the night, when he’s not even on duty.
The noise dies down a little, and people start talking about the case, Ministry gossip and their weekend plans.
The silence stretches into something almost tangible. Tangible and bloody uncomfortable! He has to resist the urge to squirm in his uncomfortable seat.
“But this could be anything!” Harry takes it from her and snaps it shut. Ron has already conjured an evidence bag. “We’ll have a look at it back at the ministry.”
He picks up the letter and turns it over in his hand, feeling the soft but textured paper against his skin. His heart does an odd sort of skip-beat, when he sees the Malfoy crest on the back of the envelope. He turns it back over. It’s addressed to ‘Auror Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class’. What the fuck? The handwriting is elegant, curvy and a bit old fashioned. And not Draco’s. He puts the envelope back down and gets his wand from the bedside table. He casts a few charms on it, and it glows a warm sunny yellow. Not cursed then. At least not in a way he can detect. He probably shouldn’t open it, just in case, but… it seems harmless enough. He carefully slides a finger under the paper and takes out the single sheet of heavy stationary.
He smiles. It makes sense for Ron to stay with Hermione’s parents, he supposes. And Ron won’t exactly find it a hardship. His interest in Muggle objects has grown over the years, almost rivaling his father’s. Besides, everything in Ron and Hermione’s cottage is operated by magic. Ron won’t even be able to open the door, without magic to take down the childproofing wards, or make himself a cup of tea, without casting a charm on the kettle.
The street is busy at this time of the morning, but the area in front of the Museum is still blessedly free of tour groups and school children. As they walk towards the lawn, the air in front of them shimmers like a mirage and dissolves into a building. Hermione presses her wand against the door, and it opens. Harry hurries to do the same.
Touching a dead person is never going to be Harry’s favourite part of his job. But it is a part of being an Auror, and it has become easier over the years. When Ron unbuttons the cuff on the victim’s shirt, and slowly peels the fabric away from his forearm, Harry is almost disappointed to see that the parchment-thin, yellowish skin is unmarked. He’s placing the man’s arm back on the bed and turning around to cast a cleaning charm on his hands, when something catches his eye.
Harry nods. He grips his wand tightly and waits, watching as Draco starts casting a complicated set of charms.
A weak light is flickering behind the window, and there are shadows moving in the darkness. The door opens and casts a beam of lamplight on two cloaked and masked figures. When the door closes again and the light disappears, the darkness suddenly feels impenetrable. Harry blinks and tries to adjust his eyes, but in the end he gives up and tugs on Ron’s sleeve instead.
"You're welcome," Draco says, gravely. Then he leers. "Besides, you're plenty big as far as I can tell."
He sneaks up to the same window he and Ron were looking through. Everything looks the same, and he can’t really process the fact that it’s been less than two days. It feels more like a year, with everything that’s happened... He tries to shake away the thoughts that are racing through his mind. Thoughts of Ron’s missing magic and Draco’s passionate kiss aren’t really helpful at the moment. Besides, thinking about Ron and Draco at the same time is awkward, even if those thoughts are in really, really different contexts.
Howard is a bully. There’s no other word for it. He’s big and hulking and slightly chubby in a way that reminds Harry uncomfortably of Dudley. Not that Dudders is a bully these days. He’s quite a nice bloke, actually. Harry goes for a pint with him once in awhile. But there’s a part of him that will always feel slightly threatened by big, hulking people, and Ron’s warm, solid presence next to him feels comforting. Howard is slouched in the uncomfortable chair in the interview room. He’s scowling defiantly, but his knee is bouncing and he’s chewing on a ragged thumbnail.
“Yes, but that’s entirely different!” the wizard scoffs. “My aunt Eleona was a very eccentric woman. Everyone knows she wasn't in her right mind. Besides, your aunt was a Longbottom, so who are you to talk!”
“No problem, Ron. I’ll owl the official report as soon as I can.” She turns around and gives Harry a small smile. “Bye, Harry!”
There’s a clanking noise of metal and wood from inside the shed, as someone knocks over a gardening tool, and then Bludger steps out.
He keeps his word. The blinking digital watch on the oven tells him that it’s only a few minutes, before he’s back, though Harry thinks it feels like much longer. The Ibumetin is starting to work, and he’s cast another cooling charm on his leg, so he’s not exactly in pain, as long as he doesn’t move his leg–just uncomfortable, sitting on the hard kitchen chair with his leg on the table.
“Father.” Draco offers him a small nod, and takes a seat in one of the two comfortable chairs set out for them.
“Jones, Williamson, you’re on observation duty. I want you to organise eyes on all residences of former Death Eaters as well as any suspected sympathisers. Get DMLE involved, and you have my permission to talk with the Department of Mysteries if you need more substantial surveillance charms in place.”
The Firewhiskey burns its way through his system, chasing away the lingering cold and leaving a pleasant buzz in its place. He watches as Malfoy takes a sip, following the bob of his throat as he swallows. Malfoy is still looking a bit pinched, but the Firewhiskey is doing its job, bringing a flush to his cheeks and erasing the frown he’s been wearing since they left Azkaban. Or since they arrived there, actually. Grey eyes meet Harry’s gaze, and Malfoy clears his throat and squares his shoulders.
Hermione narrows her eyes dangerously. “No he’s not! He’s an archaeologist. He specialises in ancient magical artefacts.”
A half snort/half giggle bursts out of him before he can try to rein it in. He lifts his glass. “To Percy! I hope Molly is actually able to make him stop and think...”
“Draco!” Hermione sounds exactly like she used to, when she reprimanded Harry and Ron back at school, and Harry can’t help smirking.
Livid blue eyes are staring back at him from the eerily still face of Zacharias Smith. He’s sporting a bruise on one cheek from the fall, and a head of carefully spiked almost white highlights. Ron is making a choked off sound behind him. It sounds a lot like a snort of laughter, but Harry isn’t really listening. He’s too busy being mortified.
They’re greeted with a murmur of voices from the Aurors and MLE officers on duty. Hestia Jones and Jolene Harris are finishing up their night shift by discussing something that involves a lot of pointing at the huge map of London on the wall. Their red robes are slung over the backs of their chairs, and if Jolene’s singed hair is any indication, they’ve had quite the exciting night.
Harry blinks at the sudden shift from the darkness of the corridor, and looks around. The lighting is not the only thing that sets this room apart from the rest of the building. One wall is made up entirely of gleaming white bookshelves stuffed with titles that Harry doesn't quite understand. Practical Arithmancy in Causewayed Enclosures is a huge leather bound tome, leaning against a smaller one titled Neolithic Magic–A Preliminary Guide. A pile of scrolls is propped in a corner next to the books. One of the tags reads My notes on the artefacts associated with Roman fertility rites. Harry feels his cheeks flush red, and quickly turns away from Hermione’s too-clever eyes. He comes face to face with Malfoy’s desk in front of the window. A sleek Muggle computer is pushed off to one side, contrasting with a few scrolls of parchment and a simple quill and inkwell. There are also a few shards of pottery in what looks suspiciously like Ron’s conjured evidence bags. Harry runs his finger over one of them. A pang of guilt goes through him at the thought of Ron conjuring those bags. Such a casual display of magic, random and unremarkable in every way, until the ability was suddenly taken away.
The Firewhiskey he’s been drinking escapes through his nose, leaving his sinuses burning and his eyes teary.
Ron throws the blanket aside and swings his purple clad legs over the side of the bed. Before Harry knows what’s happening, Ron is standing in front of him, with his hands on his shoulders. His face is completely blank, but his eyes are blue fire.
“I was thinking I might go over the list of background information on Bludger. Savage said I could go back into the field when I finished all the desk work.”
“Hermione’s just run to the shop for some dinner supplies,” he says, opening the fridge and pulling out a bottle of milk. “Seems we’re out of almost everything. Now, tell me about Lucius’ memory.”
The boat bumps gently against a tiny sliver of sandy coastline hidden by the cliffs. There’s nothing here except a wooden post, overgrown with slimy seaweed, and a rough path leading further inland. Malfoy fumbles a little with the rope, but, in the end, he manages to get the boat tied securely to the post. Harry turns toward the path, but Malfoy doesn’t follow him.
He must have been too preoccupied with Hermione’s fussing to hear the door opening, but all of a sudden Draco is there, smelling like fresh soil and wind, bending over to take off his muddied wellies next to the door. He bends over and lean muscles strain his thin, wooly jumper while heavy khakis pull tight over his arse and thighs. Harry has to look away to keep his mind from getting flooded by images of what he’d look like without the muddy cotton to obscure his view.
Ginny and Angelina are making their way over. Ginny is still holding on to the crate of extendable ears she was stacking, and Angelina is wiping her hand on her robes, ready to greet the new girl.
They Apparate on the quiet country road outside the gate to the Manor. From this angle, it looks just as forbidding as it always has. The wrought iron gates swing open when they announce their presence, and they start the long trek up the drive. Harry is half expecting something to jump out at him from the sculpted hedges along the path, but nothing happens. As they get closer, the Manor seems to look friendlier. There is light behind the gleaming windows, making it seem more cheerful in the grey winter light. The first spring flowers are struggling to break free of the still cold soil, dotting the bare ground with streaks of bright green. The front door opens, just as they reach the first step.
“Have you considered that that might actually be the right thing to do?” Hermione asks. “Ron’s right, Harry. You can’t go alone.” She turns to Ron. “And don’t even think about going with him! Not without your magic!”
The Malfoy’s summer residence is nothing like Harry expects. Not that he’s spent a great amount of time imagining it. But the vague image of a huge chateau he’s built in his mind is not accurate at all. They touch the ground under the cover of a small patch of trees right outside a small village. The first alders and poplars are just starting to bud, and the sun is warm enough that Harry turns his face up for a few seconds and just stands there, soaking in the rays, before remembering where he is, and why. When he opens his eyes again, Draco’s looking at him with an expression he can only describe as… fond. Something heavy that he didn’t even know was holding him down is lifting from his shoulders, making it suddenly easier to breathe.
They seem so lost in their bickering, Harry gives up and leaves them to it. Years of experience has taught him that it’s no use trying to interfere anyway. Beside him, Draco is following the battle of wills with horrified fascination. He turns to look at Harry, and that warm tingling curls inside him again, at the softness of those grey eyes.
“Hermione, it’s a crime scene!” Ron sounds scandalised, but Hermione is already reaching for the Floo powder.
"Please fetch the burn salve and a dose of pain potion for my guest. Oh, and a clean shirt. Preferably with short sleeves."
“I’ll take Ron to the Ministry, and we’ll sort it out with the Aurors and get the diary pages back to Mysteries, and try to re-match them with the rest of the diary. Draco, you take Harry to St Mungo’s,” Hermione says. And fuck, he’s tired of people speaking over him, like he’s a child. He narrows his eyes at her, but she only offers him a tightlipped smile.
The room looks nothing like Draco's cozy, warm study. The atmosphere of disuse is even stronger in here, and the Dark Magic is so strong Harry can feel it thrumming through the air like a current of restless energy and jabbing at his skin like millions of tiny needles. Like it's trying to push him out of the room. He looks at Draco, and finds him looking just as uneasy as he feels.
“You look so at home here,” Harry says. Fuck. Nervous chatting is not what they need right now. There must be something wrong with his head as well as his ankle. But Draco just smiles a little wistfully.
“This is a signed release order for Mr Malfoy. You’re leaving for France in half an hour, Auror Potter. Take him with you. It’ll be easier to get through the wards on the Malfoy residence if he’s there.”
“Probably in Ireland. That’s what he was planning, anyway. I suppose he could be in France. Malfoy said we could use his house in Bordeaux. But Johnny was nervous about not speaking French.”
Hermione uses her wand to spell the wrinkles out of her skirt, tucks her bag under her arm and starts walking towards the Museum.
Malfoy is pacing in front of the fire when he steps through. He’s expecting to land in the hall, but the connection Draco’s been using takes him directly to his study.
“Yeah. Those books were all huge and ancient. Not something you’d expect to find in a tip like that.” Ron wrinkles his nose.
“We went to the Quidditch match, and then followed the suspects. Unfortunately, my Polyjuice wore off, and we ended up duelling. I hurt my leg and dropped my wand, but got the pages. Then Hermione Apparated us away. My leg’s fine now, though. I was just about to go and relieve whoever is interviewing Cadogan.”
He’s grateful that Ron and Hermione’ve set their wards to grant him access at all times. Otherwise, he might have ended up being bounced back onto the hard marble floor in the Ministry’s Atrium. Flooing into their kitchen at two a.m. might not be the brightest decision he’s ever made, though. He hasn’t even finished spinning, when he feels the tell-tale leaden sensation of a Stunning spell spreading through his limbs. Out of the corner of his unblinking eyes, he spots Ron peaking out from behind the fridge door where he’s taken shelter.
“...understand the needs of the ordinary witch and wizard. Which is why I am asking for four more years to do my best to serve our community and continue to meet those needs!” He finishes with a practised smile and a well choreographed tilt to his head, which makes his profile align perfectly with the new statue of Dumbledore that’s been erected at one end of the Atrium.
Tobby eyes the pile of wet fabric on the floor. He's too polite to actually say anything about it, but the split second look he sends Harry tells him all he needs to know.
Bloody hell! A huge block of ice seems to have lodged itself somewhere around his solar plexus. Icy cold spreads through his entire body, and he sinks into the nearest chair, not trusting his legs anymore. A statement given under the influence of Veritaserum is almost as good as an actual confession.
"Ah! That makes more sense. But I still fail to see how I would benefit from telling you what I know. Assuming that I do know anything that would prove useful. Which is far from certain.”
Malfoy chokes on his Firewhiskey, and Harry’s smile turns into a full blown grin that he hides in his drink. He drains his glass and smirks at Malfoy over the rim of his empty tumbler.
Harry dives out of the way of the Severing Charm, and spots Matt trying to snatch package. Without getting to his feet, he lunges for it, and manages to grab hold. But it’s slick from the mist on the outside of the repelling layer, and he feels his wand slip from his hand as he yanks the pages out of Matt’s hands. He rolls behind the small pile of stones, taking what little protection they offer, and not caring about the burst of pain in his leg, when he lands there. He can hear curses and hexes being cast, and Hermione’s voice yelling ‘Protego!’ right before a sickening green light bounces off the newly erected shields right in front of his face. He fumbles desperately in his pocket, finally finds his glasses and slams them onto his face, already looking around for his missing wand. He spots it in a small crevice between two stone slabs, where the wall meets the floor. It’s a few paces away, and judging by the pain in his leg, he’ll have to use his arms for support if he’s going to move, which means letting go of the pages. He tucks it against his torso with one hand and arm, and uses the other to lever himself up to get a better look at what’s going on. Hermione must still be under the cloak, somewhere further back, but Draco is standing a few steps behind him to his left, hurling hexes and curses at an impressive speed. He’s focussing so hard on his duel with Bludger that he doesn’t see Matt come at him.
“Thank you, but there’s no need, Potter. I’ll just stand here for a moment and clear my head, and I’ll be fine.”
Oh, fuck it! Fuck Malfoy and his stiff upper lip and ramrod posture! No one deserves to be alone after practically being disowned.
“Auror Potter! Just a moment, Sir. I’ll check for you!” He casts a charm on the scroll of parchment in front of him, and a line is highlighted by a blue glow. “Auror Weasley has been moved to the Spell Damage ward, Sir. Room 502. Would you like me to call for someone to escort you there?”
The Magical Branch of the Museum is nowhere near as grand as its Muggle counterpart. The entrance hall is narrow and stuffy, with dark wooden panels and no windows. An ancient wizard in a pointy hat is snoozing in a chair behind a desk in the corner. There’s a sign on the desk that simply reads Enquiries. Hermione walks up to the desk and politely clears her throat. The old wizard’s head snaps up, and he blinks at them owlishly.
"Fucks sake," Draco swears again. Harry watches as he bends to grab his old book from the floor. Before his muddled brain catches on, Draco has slung an arm around his shoulder and Apparated them.
“She can’t tell you much about the actual work. She’s able to tell us a few things because Aurors have class b clearance, but no details or anything really exciting. And I’m dead curious! She’s working on a project right now that has her wearing wellies to work and coming home covered in mud. And the only thing she can tell me is that she’s working with Malfoy! And then she shoots me this meaningful look, like I’m supposed to figure out what the project is about, just from knowing that she’s working with that bloody wanker! The only thing that tells me is that it’s something Dark. And probably illegal.” Ron scowls into his pint with so much feeling it makes Harry laugh.
“Thank you, Auror Potter, Sir.” She blows her bulbous nose and spells the handkerchief clean with a flick of her fingers before handing it back. “They were arguing. The men said to Blimpy’s mistress that she should help them take the magic back from the Mudbloods. But Blimpy’s mistress always said that the men in black robes are plebs and unworthy and they should leave her alone. Mistress said that again to the new men and they killed her.”
“What? No!” The look in Malfoy’s eyes is more sincere than Harry has ever seen. There’s no calculation left on his face. Perhaps it’s the Firewhiskey, or just plain exhaustion. “I wanted to be there, and Fath- my father… I suspected that he’d behave like that. It was unpleasant, but it wasn’t really a surprise.” He coughs. “About what he insinuated… I hope you’re not going to spread the word. My friends know… but I like to keep private matters private.”
“Fifi will get a Blood-Replenishing Potion. Monsieur Draco’s friend should wrap the leg.” The little elf snaps her fingers, and a small mountain of white bandages appear. She sends him a stern look. “Be careful. Do not hurt Monsieur Draco. Fifi will be back shortly.”
He yawns widely, since there's no one here to see him anyway. He should probably make a pot of tea and wait for Hermione to get back from the hospital, but his eyes are slipping shut on their own, and the sofa in front of the fireplace is really comfortable.
He gets up from his chair and gestures to the elf that she’s free to go. But before she can get up, a thought occurs to him.
“Our house is on the east side of the village square, right next to the fountain.” He points at something behind the trees on the square.
Lucius Malfoy is kneeling in front of Voldemort, who is rambling about how Mudbloods are polluting the magical bloodlines, and how the only way to stop them is to drain the magic from their filthy, unworthy bodies and leave them like the Muggles they were always supposed to be. Nagini is there too, slithering around behind him, creeping over his ankles and raising her head to hiss threateningly in his ear. Harry sees him shivering, small trembles that are only visible to someone paying close attention.
“Here you go.” Draco hands him a spoon and measures out the potion. “I don’t think you need more than this. It’s not a very complicated break…”
“Like hell I will! This is my house,” Draco hisses. He’s slipped the Cloak down, making his head float eerily in thin air.
“Look, Potter, I might as well say this now. I’m Hermione’s friend now. I know that’s probably not easy to get used to, but believe it or not, I consider myself a fairly decent friend. Therefore, I care about what happens to her husband.”
“Please listen, people! We have a SDEA case. Someone performed dark magic at the crime scene. Dark enough to set off the SDE trace.” The room erupts in a frantic rush of whispers. Suspected Death Eater Activity is rare, nowadays. When they were trainees, there were still a good amount of suspected sightings and use of curses that set off the trace which had been put in place after the war, but back then Harry and Ron were never allowed anywhere near the actual crime scenes. Harry can feel the adrenaline rushing through him, and without really meaning to, he feels for the comfortable shape of his wand inside its holster. The familiar feel of the well worn holly against his palm settles him somehow, makes it easier to focus on the briefing going on at the front of the room.
“The Blood-Replenishing Potion worked wonders. And I’ll take something for the pain before we leave. I’d really rather just go home.”
Malfoy’s surprise only shows for a fraction of a second. Then he schools his features back into a neutral expression and nods.
Fifi nods again and Disapparates back to the house. Harry slings the cloak over both of them, and they shuffle back across the square and carefully open the front door.
He sighs and pokes his head around the wall. Ron startles and spits out a few bits of feather from the quill he’s been chewing on.
He finds Ron in the kitchen, watching Rose trying to pet Crookshanks. He’s smirking slightly behind his mug of tea. The ancient cat looks decidedly unenthusiastic about Rosie’s sticky little fingers in his fur, his tail swishing at his ears twitching. When Harry hesitates a moment in closing the door, he quickly makes his escape into the garden. Rose frowns, but is quickly distracted by pulling off her shoes and socks.
“Wait! This chapter is not about spells to help you become a thief.” She’s got Secrets of the Darkest Arts floating in front of her and is using her wand to turn the pages.
“Figures. What did you hear? Wait. Hermione should hear this too. I think she’s in the dining room, trying to convert it into a study.”
"No thank you, Tobby." Harry looks at his blistered hand. No. Not up for casting anything yet. "But I'd be grateful if you'd vanish it for me."
Hermione frowns at her empty mug. “There is another option,” she says slowly. “But I don’t know if Draco’ll agree to it.”
Ron looks sympathetic, but Harry knows that if Hermione has set her mind to something, he’ll  be powerless to stop her. It’s been six month since he came home to an empty flat and a letter from Philippe saying that he was moving back to Paris. He had hoped that Hermione would leave him alone for awhile yet, but hopefully a night out clubbing will be the extent of it. He really doesn’t want to become her next cause.
They gather around the basin and join hands. Ron makes sure to stand between Harry and Hermione. He’s getting along with Draco cordially enough, but apparently their ceasefire doesn’t extend to holding hands.
“Can’t say I’m surprised. The brother lives alone in a cottage on the Scottish east coast. Must be practical for work. Think he might help us? Maybe he knows where Bludger’s hiding?”
Picturing Narcissa Malfoy in a flowery dress, carrying a wicker basket full of produce, is enough to make his head hurt.
The elf appears almost immediately. When she sees Draco, her ears droop and quiver, and her huge eyes fill with tears.
“I don’t think Johnny’s ever had a real girlfriend. He’s always chatting up one tart or another at that bar he goes to. But you could ask our cousin, Daniel, I suppose. He wasn’t exactly rooting for the two of you during the war, if you know what I mean. And Johnny’s always looked up to him.”
“A bit ironic, isn’t it? Considering all the petty crime.” Ron waves a stack of what looks like Wizengamot transcripts. “This is mostly just Quidditch brawls, but there are a few cases of theft and possession of illegal potions.”
Tanned Bloke chooses a spot right next to them and unzips his baggy jeans. Oh, bloody fuck! Harry cringes. Having a baby Death Eater pissing on his shoes wasn’t a part of his plans for the weekend. He wants to look away, but something catches his eye. Tanned Bloke seems to have a problem with shedding. There are mousy brown hairs strewn down the back of his shirt. There’s a grunt and then he’s zipping up his jeans, and turning to go back inside. Before Harry even knows what he’s doing, his hand is reaching out, and he’s grasping a hair between his fingers. Tanned Bloke doesn’t notice, stomping right past him and back through the door.
“Yeah. The young one with the trousers around his ankles. Remember? That potion smuggling case where Donovan nearly ruined our cover?”
Bludger hits the floor face first. Good, Harry thinks maliciously. Then he’s throwing himself down next to Draco, and tuning everything else out.
“Of course.” He walks over, still grateful to be able to move, and puts his arms around his neck, pulling him in for a brief kiss.
“Never ‘eard of it.” Howard spits a piece of chewed nail onto the table in front of him. Ron is out of his chair and in his face in an instant.
He Apparates to the corner behind the shed in the Grangers’ back garden ten minutes later, taking a few breaths of damp air and enjoying the smell of soil and pine. He’s still standing there, when he is startled by a high pitched squeal. He peers around the corner, and finds Hermione’s father pushing a laughing Rose on a swing, hung from a pine branch.
“Thanks.” He checks that he’s closed the door behind him. “A trip to Azkaban and a conversation with Lucius Malfoy will do that. But I didn’t come here to talk about me.”
“Potter, Weasley, I want you at the crime scene, and I want you visible to the public, going in.  Head over there now. You can get the apparition coordinates from dispatch. Secure the scene and the evidence and report back with a memory for the Pensieve before you do anything else. No heroics, no pursuits, no duelling. Is that clear?”
“I couldn’t help noticing you had a bit of trouble with your drink. Would you like me to buy you another one? I’m Adam, by the way.”
He watches in horror, as the curse grazes Draco’s leg, slicing clean through his trousers and into his flesh.
“But I don’t really want to have a blind date with an Unspeakable. What are we going to talk about? I’m telling her we’re busy with the case, but maybe when we’ve solved it.”
It feels completely wrong to go to the pub while Draco’s still in a cell downstairs, but on the other hand, a Butterbeer and a Firewhiskey will probably make him sleepy enough to stop thinking about it and actually get some rest. Besides, Draco would be safe at home, if he’d only gone along with the Legilimency idea. He can sort of understand why he didn’t, but still...
Fuck. Draco’s right. He knows that, despite the maelstrom of want and fear and hope that’s pouring through him. He nods.
Harry nods. He's dreamed about doing something like that himself. Get away from all the preconceived notions of who he's supposed to be.
“Harry! It’s good to see you. Hermione and Ron are in the kitchen. You know the way.” He smiles and gives Rose a particularly laugh-inducing push on the swing.
Harry nods dumbly. That small smile is still playing around Draco’s lips, and his hair is falling into his eyes. He looks so open, and he really wants to say something profound. Something to acknowledge the gift Draco is giving him by sharing this bit of his past. But nothing comes to mind, except stupid things like ‘I want to kiss you’ and ‘I think I’m falling for you. Badly.’ So he keeps his mouth shut.
“Right. Focussed.” Like this won’t leave him reeling for days. He stands up and puts the t-shirt on, grateful that his face is hidden for a few precious moments. The soft fabric enveloping him in a cloud of Draco’s scent is pure torture. When he yanks his head free of the shirt and adjusts his glasses, Draco is standing in front of him. He reaches out a hand, but seems to change his mind about touching him, and lets it fall to his side, before it brushes his arm.
“We’re experienced enough to deal with something like this on our own. It's not like they're real Death Eaters!”
Malfoy’s skin is even paler than usual, and his jaw is clenched tight. Harry has a sudden urge to reach out and put a hand on his shoulder or back. But instead he matches his steps to Malfoy’s, trying to present a united front towards both the guards and the prisoners.
“Guess we’re stuck in here again today. I reckon Savage did it on purpose, to avoid sending me on a field mission.”
“Yes, I think you have. Besides, we should probably go back to London if we want to start following up on those leads.”
“Tell me again, Mr. Howard,” Ron is saying. “Are you, or do you know anyone who is affiliated with an organisation called the New Dawn.”
Malfoy’s lips curl up into a smile, and Harry realises that he hasn’t actually stopped staring at them.
“We can’t both stay under this.” His lips are so close to Draco’s ear, he feels him shiver when he breathes the words in a low whisper, before he slips out from under the cloak. “You stay hidden and cover me.”
“Hermione Apparated us here. Besides, I was under the impression that we were trying to keep this out of the papers,” Draco says calmly. “Mostly for your brother’s sake.”
“Thank you for your help. We’ll contact your cousin. I’m sorry to bother you, but can I please use your toilet before we Apparate to Dorset?”
“Yeah. I’m the one who called you. Sorry to disrupt your weekend plans, but one of the surveillance charms went off. Kitty Tor.”
He walks down the stairs in a daze. It isn’t until he’s actually standing in front of the heavy door that he starts thinking about what to actually say. He’s been determined to fix things, since five minutes after he slammed this door yesterday morning, but it’s been sort of vague… something he had to do later. And all of a sudden, later is now. He casts the complicated unlocking charm, and turns the knob.
Draco looks at him a little too knowingly. “Between the Unspeakables and the Curse-breakers, I’m sure the Ministry staff will be able to handle it without my input. Besides, the way you feel about St. Mungo’s? That’s more or less how I feel about the Ministry. I don’t exactly have fond memories about the place.”
“Shut up, Ron. He’s running the Stonehenge excavations. His thesis about the magical symbols of Henge monuments was published in both Muggle and magical journals, and he’s been with the Magical Heritage Foundation for three years now. Draco is really good at what he does.”
Hermione rolls her notes up and puts her quill down. “We should get back to Rosie, but I’ll keep working on the lists. Are you ready Ron?” She turns her far too knowing eyes on Harry.  “Do you want to walk with us, or are you going to Floo?”
He must have made some sort of noise, because Malfoy snatches his hand away as of he’s been burned and takes a self conscious step back.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, Draco? I see you’ve brought someone along? Your latest boytoy?”
Oh! Oh shit. Hermione’s right. The blond is coming over. Harry gulps a mouthful of ice water and wipes his hands on his jeans.
“Ah! Potter! I just wanted to make sure you! I just wanted to make sure you were in one piece. Weasley and Unspeakable Granger told me what happened, but I wanted to hear it from you too.”
“And he got it in the middle of a Cabinet meeting,” George adds, his voice quivering with held back laughter.
At first, nothing happens. Draco is frowning in concentration. He grips his wand a little tighter and tries again. The Dark Magic starts to build. Harry feels it expanding around him. It's like an invisible fist is pressing in on his chest and making him choke and gasp for air. The pressure intensifies until his vision blurs and he has to fight to keep his thoughts focussed.
“Yeah. I can imagine.” Harry winces. Hermione had lost her former love for early starts after becoming a mum. These days she’ll happily stay in bed until noon, if given the chance. And she doesn’t take disturbances lightly.
Ron smiles at him, and Harry has to stifle a laugh, when he hears him start talking about how he’s a passionate collector of dark amulets, and how he just loves going into the ‘cute and quaint’ little shops in Knockturn to look for dark items.
“We don’t know for certain if they set off the trace, but if they did, they must have used Dark magic in some way. But other than that, we don’t know anything about who they are. The state of the crime scene indicates that they were looking for something. Perhaps a book or letter… looks like they took a lot of interest in the books, with all the ripped pages laying around everywhere.” Harry looks at Ron, and finds him nodding thoughtfully. “We should take a closer look at the books. See if there’s a particular kind they were looking for. That might give us a clue.”
Mr Granger pokes his head around the door. “Is there anything I can do to help? Would you like me to get a painkiller for you? I have some Ibuprofen…Or I could see if Hermione has one of those potions in her old bedroom…”
“I’m here to see Auror Weasley. He was in the Magical Emergencies and Disasters ward, but I think he’s been moved.”
“Well, given that your best friend is more or less a Squib at the moment, I’d think the most important question is how to get his magic back.”
Lucius kneels in front of Voldemort and screams in agony as the Cruciatus curse hits him over and over again. Finally, he collapses into unconsciousness. He wakes up in his bed, drinks a pain potion and drags himself to a soft-looking chair in front of the fireplace in the drawing room, where he continues to read about the illusive cup. Then Narcissa bursts through the door, followed by a gang of Snatchers and a small group of prisoners. “They say they’ve got Potter. Draco, come here,” Narcissa says.
He wants to tell him to speed things up because he’s not going to last long like this, but Draco’s cock is dragging warm and wet over his stomach, and when he bucks up, desperate for more, strong hands find his thighs and presses him back down, until all he can do is lay there and let Draco push him over the edge, his orgasm exploding white-hot from his balls to his cock, and into every cell of his body. Over him, Draco gasps and shudders, and comes with a choked off sounds that might be his name.
He should be used to the Muggle references by now, but those words coming from Draco still sound so strange.
Harry checks his watch. It’s been almost an hour, and he really wants to punch Brigg in his stupid, smug mouth. He’s sitting there, smirking at them and refusing to answer questions, while his brother gets more and more time to slip away. Ron looks like he’s about ready to perform an unauthorised Legilimens, or maybe cast an Unforgivable. Which might be a really bad idea, since Savage is standing on the other side of the one way window behind him.
The apprentice must have seen something in his expression. Something that gives away his anxiousness.
He closes the door to the study with a louder than necessary slam, and the portraits’ outraged protests fade into the background. Harry looks around. He didn’t notice last night, but the only paintings in here are landscapes and a few modern, abstract pieces. With the way the portraits behave, he certainly understands why.
“Harry!” He jumps to his feet and takes a few steps. But then he hesitates and a guarded look seeps into his eyes. Harry is itching to reach out and smooth that small frown line between his brows, but Draco has stopped in the middle of the small room, too far away to touch.
“Yeah. She fell asleep while I read to her. She insisted that Ron always reads her at least three bedtime stories.”
“The telly. That’s great, mate. Does Savage think it’s brilliant too? Or are we going to get yelled at for contaminating the evidence?”
Fuck! He looks down at his hands and finds them growing longer and more slender. And what’s worse, more blurry. He needs his glasses again. He grips his wand tightly and looks back up, just as Bludger raises his wand.
Oh, fuck! They can’t move. Not without being seen. And Harry is suddenly hyper aware of the wards pressing in on his magic. Confining him. Disapparating is not an option. They could try to fight, but there are four wands trained on them. He feels Ron reaching for the emergency Portkey in his robe pocket, and grab his arm. And then the tall man throws his head back and a flash of pale blond hair catches Harry’s attention.
“Yes. I haven’t been able to do much, but I did find a few texts. And I still have a possible source left that I haven’t spoken to yet. Please, have a seat, and I’ll tell you what I know.” Malfoy gestures to a comfortable looking pair of armchairs in front of the fireplace.
“Yeah, that’s what the letter said. They didn’t tell you what Death Eater activity you were supposed to have committed?” On the one hand, he hopes not. It’s a tried and true tactic to keep the accusations as vague as possible, to maybe get the suspect to confess to more crimes that the Aurors know about. But on the other hand… If that fuckwit Donovan was the one doing the actual arrest, anything is possible.
There are footsteps on the stairs, and Ron comes back down, wearing his uniform. He grins, when he sees Harry noticing.
When he opens his eyes again, he is standing in the alley next to the Bearded Witch. Malfoy is leaning heavily against his shoulder, but only for a moment.
