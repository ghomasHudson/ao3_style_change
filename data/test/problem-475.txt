Harry didn’t say anything. He had already complained so much about not being informed properly about anything last summer. He agreed with Ron, obviously, but somehow he was getting used to Dumbledore ignoring him and almost all the other Order members treating him as a child.
“No. It sounds a great idea,” Harry said, actually meaning it. It felt hard to not have a proper funeral for Sirius, so commemorating him in at least some way made Harry feel a bit better. “How did you smuggle it in?” he asked Blaise, pointing at the Firewhisky bottle.
“Sirius is dead,” Harry said with a hollow voice.
“I’m not gay,” Harry blurted out abruptly, breaking the kiss.
“Oh, I’m happy to hear that. They are rather dangerous.
“But there is
“I think so,” Harry said. There was at least something good about being at the Dursleys for the beginning of the summer as there was no magic disrupting the mobile phone signal.
If Draco had to try to find something positive in the whole situation, he thought the War had made at least something shift inside his head. He couldn’t put his finger on what exactly had caused the change during the War; probably it was the War itself and the constant fear of death, or maybe it was his whole family surviving and not needing to fear for them anymore, but what was sure was that he knew something had made him see his own life differently. He had hidden for his whole life, lived only some sort of half-life, and he didn’t want to do it any longer. He had gotten another chance as he had not died during the War, and he wanted to seize that chance and try to start finally living as a more complete version of himself. Draco didn’t know
Harry looked down at Draco who was already staring at him with a determined glint in his eyes. “I do believe you.”
“Erm,” Harry said, his heart pounding in his chest.
“I think so, if he’s in the Room.”
“Yes, I got that part. What’s going on here?” Harry asked, cutting Seamus short.
“Why can’t you tell me? Draco, I want to help,” Harry said stubbornly.
“Fine, how about you?” Harry said quickly, trying to shift the focus away from himself.
side, laughing at me and telling him all my –”
--*--*--*--*--
“You so are! It’s either that or something dirty.”
“Um, yes. Though he made it sound like it was rather an honour.”
Soon Malfoy’s mouth left Harry’s, and he started kissing Harry’s neck instead. Harry let out a strangled voice and tilted his head automatically to give Malfoy better access.
his death, and he had to grudgingly admit that what Potter was saying made sense. “A pretty Slytherin move from you to make me agree to your plan by drawing my mother into this,” Draco said slowly. “So, what do you suggest?”
Snape’s short visit at Grimmauld Place had left Harry dumbfounded. Before that, he hadn’t known a thing about Occlumency, though now, having chewed the idea for a while, he kind of got it why he needed the lessons. But having them with
“Detention in the first week, this must be your personal record. Don’t you worry, as a prefect I can promise you this is just the beginning,” Malfoy said, now pacing beside Harry.
“Yeah, I remember what you said but that’s not what I meant. I want to know what you
Harry found his book and Hermione’s essay in record time, and to his surprise, he noticed he had quite a lot of time left. He decided to take a longer route to the Transfiguration classroom and enjoy the deserted corridors as almost everybody was still on the breakfast. However, his walk got suddenly interrupted as someone grabbed his robe sleeve and dragged him into an empty classroom.
Draco sighed and laid down next to Harry, head resting on Harry’s chest and hand petting Harry’s stomach. “Could we just not think about that today? I doubt anyone’s going to come to this side of the lake.”
“To put it mildly,” Harry muttered.
Harry turned his gaze to Draco. This was the first time in weeks Draco opened up a little about what was bothering him.
“So,” Hermione said cautiously. “You knew about Malfoy, then?”
"For the tenth time Pans, no, they haven't opened the doors yet. And yes, we do tell you as soon as we see any kind of movement,” Draco said, gritting his teeth nervously.
“We brought something to you too,” Hermione said, looking at Harry pointedly as she handed Harry the package he had asked them to bring him.
“It was
Eventually, they couldn’t ignore the slowly creeping cold anymore as they both were shivering wildly.
When the day to go back to Hogwarts came at last, Harry felt both anxious and relieved. He would finally get to see Draco. The first thing Harry would do at Hogwarts would be finding Draco and dragging him into an alcove, the Room of Requirement or the Boathouse, the place didn’t really matter as long as they would get to be alone. But the wait felt too long and the last hours on the train seemed to go by extremely slowly, and not even meeting his friends after the holidays or the lunch with Slughorn’s club seemed to make the time go faster. After the lunch, though, Harry had come up with a rather spontaneous idea to sneak into Draco’s compartment with his Invisibility Cloak and hide on the luggage rack.
,” Potter murmured, and in the blink of an eye, the flames were licking the wooden boat all over. “Okay, the wards shouldn’t extend this far. Hold on tight to me.”
so, look at me because I will never, ever die.
“Look, I’m going to say the sappiest thing I’ve ever said, and don’t expect me to ever repeat it,” Draco said, talking over Harry. “But the best gift for me is that you’re alright after what happened in the Ministry and that we’re together now. You scared the hell out of me, you know.”
“So, should we continue?” Harry said and seized the knife.
Harry felt like floating in the air, free and weightless. It was a good feeling, as if he never had to feel anxious or worried or sad again. As if nothing could ever touch him or hurt him.
And when it came to the comfort level of the cell, it didn’t exactly help Draco’s body to relax, either. Not to mention that he was now supposed to sleep on the cold, bare floor. ‘
“Don’t play stupid. The me-wanting-to-put-my-hands-on-you shite.”
Harry was outside, leaning against Hog’s Head’s wall after the meeting. He was relieved the meeting was over. Even though it had gone quite well, Harry still felt uncomfortable when people questioned if he was telling the truth about Voldemort’s return and Cedric’s way to die.
They started pacing towards the castle, which had seemed much easier than what it was in reality.
Draco entered the room cautiously, still marvelling at the sight of dozens and dozens of house-elves scurrying happily around, doing their duties.
It was buzzing so much in Draco’s head his father’s voice sounded like he wasn’t in the same room at all.
going to try again. It doesn’t matter if I wanted to be part of this or not, I can’t be unbiased.”
“Good. I’ll take them as an example again as they are practically the same thing.”
“Dunno. Just kind of realized I know nothing about it. Except for the aristocracy and hierarchy based on the blood,” Harry said, trying to shrug nonchalantly.
They walked in a pressing silence to the bench and sat down on it, side by side.
“No, Malfoy, of course I’m not…” Potter started, impatient. “Whatever. Come on, we don’t have much time.”
Harry hadn’t had any idea how spending the night with Draco for the first time could feel so much scarier than fighting the Hungarian Horntail last year. He wanted Draco so much his body seemed to go all numb, and when he tried move his limbs, it felt like they weren’t his at all. Besides, he was still quite worried about doing something that would make Draco shut down. What if Draco just freaked out and left? Harry took a long breath in, gathered all his Gryffindor courage and took Draco’s hand under the blanket.
“Oh, you’re all here. Hi,” Ginny said in a sing-song voice. “Is it okay if I borrow Harry for a moment?”
“Just some students from different Houses,” Harry said, shrugging and acting nonchalant. “Anyway, there’s a Ravenclaw girl who may think there’s something between me and her, so she kind of kissed me at the end of our practice.”
“I know, I don’t even want you to promise me something like that,” Harry said. “We don’t have to plan our future here and right now; we can take it slowly and see how things go. And when either of us is having a bad moment and things seem hopeless, we'll take it just one day at a time. And if a day feels too much, we’ll take it just one hour at a time. And when even that feels too much, we’ll take it just one minute at a time. Do you think you could do that?”
“Sounds a bit pathetic if you put it that way, yeah,” Harry said. “I miss you. Quite a lot.”
“Yeah, right, whatever,” Draco said, snorting. “But seriously, is this getting out of hand?”
might buy one drink, maybe even two if there’s a special occasion, but definitely not more than that,” Ron said and winked at Draco, making Draco blush deeply.
Here's my pride,
Anyway, I've been writing this chapter (or the whole story in general) based on what I've learned in therapy, what I've learned from listening to people who have more or less experience of a broken/toxic background (alcoholism, violence or toxic ideas in the family, years of bullying, physical or mental abuse etc.), and what I've read about people who have been raised in families who have belonged to a really conservative religious group. After reading quite a few fics and Harry Potter books after a long break, it made me compare the pureblood culture with conservative religious groups and I started to see many similarities in them (how people think their own group is better than the others, how people outside of your own group are a threat, how it’s preferable to find a spouse inside one’s own group, how there are plenty of rules you have to follow to be able to remain as a member of the group, how there might be a lot of love in families but it’s dependent on one’s actions etc.), which inspired me to write this story. Anyway, in all the cases I’ve read about people who have been able to leave their family and community are those who are adults, living already on their own and having enough connections outside of the community in question, and even then it’s been an immensely hard and hurtful process. The only underage cases (that I know of) who have been able to leave their family are those who have had some sort of healthy and close adult who has kind of adopted them. Blaise, Ginny, and Harry were a good start for Draco to start to heal, yes, but far, far from enough in my opinion.
“Draco?” Harry said tentatively as he noticed Draco was lying on his bed, his face turned towards the wall.
“What does it matter? It couldn’t work out anyway.”
When the shaking of Harry’s body calmed down a little, Draco pulled slowly back, took Harry’s hand and guided him to the bed. He took gently the other boy’s torn clothes off and cleaned carefully all the new, small wounds Harry had gotten with a wet towel. When he had removed the dust and dried blood from Harry’s skin, he helped Harry to dress to the clean pyjamas they had brought to the Room just in case one of them would forget to bring their own one day.
exactly like her when she was the same age. Once Nymphadora wanted to taste our pet Kneazle’s tail, you can only imagine how well that ended,” Andromeda said, looking fondly at another picture of her daughter.
“Harry, listen to me, I didn’t want –”
“Gin, would you like to take a walk with me?” Harry asked as soon as he found her sitting in the common room with sour-faced Ron and Hermione. “Oh. Sorry. Did I interrupt something?”
Molly looked at Harry, eyes slightly shining with tears. “You’re right, Harry. I had almost forgotten how fast you all were forced to grow up,” she said sighing. “But you still care for him?”
“I have forgiven him!”
“Because of the Slytherin wrapping paper?” Harry asked, looking puzzled.
“What the fuck, Harry?” Draco said, pushing Harry away. “What on Earth is there going on inside your head?”
The look on Draco’s face turned completely devastated, and he started to tremble slightly. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath to gather himself before standing up and walking out of the room, casting one more miserable glance in Harry’s direction.
Potter pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of himself, looking surprised. Draco smirked to himself. He had been following the boy more or less intensively for the past seven years, the Gryffindor simply had no chance to surprise him anymore. He should have known this by now.
“Should we head back to the castle?” Ginny shouted at Harry as they were flying together over Black Lake one chilly autumn evening, right before the sunset.
“You’ve got a Christmas gift for me?” Harry asked as he licked another snowflake, this time off the tip of Draco’s nose.
“Oh, well, I’ll just cut you a slice to take home with then, so you can eat it later. Your house-elf should definitely take better care of you so that you wouldn’t lose too much weight,” Molly said sharply, cut a huge slice of the pie for Harry, and put it into a separate dish.
“Harry,” Draco murmured back into Harry’s mouth.
“Studied? What do you mean
“Erm, yes, we’ve managed to talk and, well, it’s good to be friends again as we’ve got so many mutual friends and then there’s Teddy and Andromeda and –”
Harry gave a short laugh and blushed slightly. He wasn’t sure whether or not he should be embarrassed by how dependent his daily routines were on his house-elf at this age. “Kreacher has really improved in cooking,” he muttered.
“Yes, but I still should’ve listened to you and not just jump straightaway to my own conclusions.”
“I have heard only your version, but I think so,” Draco said with a sad tone in his voice.
“Yeah, I’ll keep you updated,” Harry said, smiling back at Ginny.
“Er, no, I didn’t. But that’s beside the point,” Harry said hastily and took a long breath in. “Would you like to hang out with me, the bloke I’m seeing and his friend? On Valentine’s Day. Here at Hogwarts.”
“I’ve already told you, I had nothing to do with that sodding necklace,” Draco hissed angrily.
“That’s quite understandable,” Hermione said, nodding. “He’s grown up with magic all around him since he was born; magic is such a huge part of his whole identity. But on the other hand, we don’t have to be exactly alike to feel connected to other people, that’s not how it works. People are so complex beings, we all are rather our own jigsaw puzzles. Some of our pieces resonate with people who have similar pieces in their puzzle, even though those people might seem completely different otherwise. And that’s the whole point with support groups, to find people you can feel connected with and with who you feel comfortable to share your story.”
Harry hadn’t really prepared himself for this, so he hadn’t packed the pyjamas in his bag, and now he didn’t know what to wear. In any case, he supposed he wasn’t expected to sleep with all his clothes on, so he settled for his pants and a t-shirt he had been wearing under his robes.
“So, what’s on your mind?”
Malfoy stiffened immediately. His face flushed and his expression became a strange mix of angriness and fear. Now that Harry looked at Malfoy more closely, he noticed that the Slytherin looked really exhausted. His whole posture radiated animosity towards anyone who dared to come too close, and by the dark circles under his eyes, it was obvious he hadn’t been sleeping well for some time.
“Yes,” Draco answered.
Draco considered the girl who looked both nervous and earnest at the same time. “Fine,” he said finally, still feeling suspicious. “But why are you trying to help me? I mean, I’ve always acted like a complete prat towards you.”
“Yes, we heard about it,” Ginny said, smiling a little. “Draco, why don’t you and I go to the garden with Teddy so that Harry could have tea or coffee with Andromeda?”
“Oh yes. They both got married to decent, pureblooded men, and Narcissa produced even an offspring.”
said. “Harry,” Draco whispered, staring Harry intently in the eye. Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“Give me the list, I’ll fetch you everything today if you look after Teddy while I’m gone.”
Draco winced. “I don’t know. Have just happened to be at the dinner table when they’ve talked about these things. And my mother and aunt Bella have told me all about their cousin, the so called blood traitor Sirius Black,” Draco said.
“We have time. We’re wizards, Harry. We don’t need more than five minutes for packing,” Draco said, starting to kiss along Harry’s jawline and nudging the hem of Harry’s shirt.
“It was high time you came to your senses,” Ron said with a low voice as he, Harry and Hermione were studying in a peaceful corner in the library.
, Harry thought bitterly. He had absolutely no desire to talk about anything that had something to do with his messy feelings.
Something warm spread on Harry’s chest. He knew Draco was trying, and this was a huge step for him. Still, at the same time, Harry couldn’t avoid the fear of Draco not changing his opinions. Fuck, if Draco couldn’t accept and respect himself as he was, how could he accept and respect the others? Harry knew it would become a problem in a long run, he just didn’t see himself together with someone who was so prejudiced and had such a different worldview compared to his. But right now, this was enough. He felt like he was already too deep, caring too much about Draco, and he didn’t want to ruin it.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t dare to open his mouth as he was quite sure the only thing that would come out of it would be embarrassing sobs. He was so close to tears now.
Once Harry had learned how to dodge Draco, his first school week went rather smoothly. That was until Blaise decided to approach him as he, for one, wasn’t scared of being seen in the company of a bunch of Gryffindors.
“Are you kidding? In front of the staff?” Harry asked, pointing loosely at the staff table.
an evil person, Draco,” Harry said firmly, cutting Draco short. “It’s not about who you were, it’s all about who you are now. I can see how much you’ve already changed.”
When Harry’s feet met the thin ice cover for the first time, he felt like wanting to back out and rush back to his pile of clothes. Instead, he gritted his teeth determinedly and stepped on the ice. He could barely feel it before it broke under his feet, rattling a little as he walked through it.
He was used to seeing all kinds of dreams and nightmares. Even though the War had ended, the bad dreams didn’t seem to leave him alone. It was actually boringly common for Harry to wake up at some point during the night, sweating, screaming so loud his throat became sore, and his heart beating so fast it felt as if it was pounding out of his chest.
“But that can’t be too bad? I mean, it can’t be enough of reason to shut him out,” Harry argued.
just keep a low profile?”
They ran back to their cloth piles, giggling the whole way like five-year-old kids. After casting a few Drying and Warming Charms and putting their clothes back on, they both started to feel the calmness engulfing them both mentally and physically. The blood ran hotly in their veins making their muscles relax, and they started to feel pleasantly drowsy and content.
“So, you’re trying to say there was no way Malfoy would’ve been able to leave his family at the end of the sixth year?”
They looked at each other for a while, and Harry felt overwhelmed by emotions. Whatever bad had happened during the summer, it was all fine now, they were safe. They were back at Hogwarts, near to Dumbledore, and finally together again.
I don't know if anybody agrees with me on this, but swimming in cold water really is super relaxing. Haven't done it in a couple of years now, but when I used to do it more regularly, it always made me more relaxed than yoga or meditation. :D
Draco sighed heavily, turned to his side, and fortunately managed to fall into light sleep in a few seconds.
Harry snapped his mouth shut and held his breath for a moment. “Fuck, I never wanted anyone to die,” he started almost whispering. “I never wanted our side to abandon the idea of the trials. Malfoy, we’ve really done everything I can think of,” he went on desperately, trying to reassure the other boy. And maybe even himself, too, to some extent.
“You’ve got a pretty odd way to show it,” Harry said, sounding bitter.
The rest of the holidays passed in bliss. The worry about Draco grew day by day, even though Harry was surrounded by people all the time. Ginny made her best to keep Harry busy at the Burrow, and he played a lot of Quidditch with the Weasleys and had a countless number of walks in the meadows. The daytime wasn’t too bad, but when the night fell, Harry found it extremely hard to get any sleep at all. There hadn’t been a single new message from Draco, and Harry couldn’t believe it would be because of the possibly broken phone or a dead battery. Ginny still tried to tell him everything always seemed to be much worse in a dead of night, but he couldn’t let go of an odd feeling there must be something else, something that had gone seriously wrong.
Harry could feel his hands sweating and heart hammering wildly in his chest, and it took all his willpower to keep his eyes on Snape’s. He didn’t even dare to breathe.
“Harry,” Sirius said tentatively, knocking on Harry’s door. “May I come in?”
Harry flushed. “Erm, I think I started thinking about that… option more during last summer. I happened to scream Cedric’s name in my sleep quite a lot and my cousin asked if he’s my boyfriend, so, well.”
“Malfoy, could I speak with you for a moment?” Harry asked uncertainly.
“Yes?” he grunted.
dim, yellowish, and fluttery light in the small, completely closed place. Draco laid on a familiar lumpy
The rest of the day passed surprisingly quickly. Draco hadn’t exaggerated when he had mentioned there was a lot of work to follow all the moves of a half-year-old who was more than eager to put practically everything he could reach into his mouth. As there were three adults present, it wasn’t such a big problem, but Harry couldn’t understand how Andromeda was able to look after Teddy on her own most of the time when she was supposed to cook, clean, and do all the other house duties as well.
“No, you twit. I said I haven’t told anyone and won’t tell without discussing it with you first. Just told her I’m bent,” Harry said, shrugging.
“No, you keep it,” Harry said, refusing to take the hat back.
Not that Harry knew what he wanted from Malfoy, either. He knew he was attracted to the git, and his instincts kept screaming for more. More kissing, more touching, more Malfoy in general. Even though they had dutifully ignored each other in Potions, the class had still felt like one of Harry’s highlights that week. He had been so aware of the Slytherin sitting next to him. He had felt Malfoy’s body radiating warmth, startled when Malfoy had accidentally touched his hand once and felt his right cheek tingling when Malfoy had reached for an ingredient for the potion and breathed warmly against Harry’s cheek for a split-second. It all felt so bittersweet because Harry’s mind was clearly pleased with the contact but at the same time, it was never enough. When Harry had been ready with chopping, he had to literally sit on his hands to be able to refrain from leaning against Malfoy and touching the other boy. Harry’s body and mind were sending him clear signals that being around Malfoy and touching him were good, positive, and even amazing things, which made his mind go giddy and his body feel warm and tingling all over. As if Harry’s mind and body were yelling to just go for it. But at the same time, Harry still knew it was Malfoy, so there was definitely something that didn’t add up.
“I cannot. I am not. What does it matter?”
Draco swallowed and felt for the first time during their meeting that he had no proper argument to say to Potter. He hadn’t come to think at all about what would happen
“She’s truly trying, yes,” Blaise said.
Neither Harry nor Malfoy said anything. Zabini just sighed heavily, stood up, walked between Harry and Malfoy, took Harry’s right hand, and put it over Malfoy’s left.
To Draco’s surprise, the first weeks back at school weren’t entirely bad, either. As the whole school was now full of kids traumatized by the War, the new Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, had decided to hire a few mind healers who all the students got to go to see if they wanted. At first, Draco hadn’t even considered talking to a stranger about his problems, but Ginny had made him promise to even give it a go and see if it could work. Draco had been quite prejudiced against the whole idea as he knew all the mind healers in the British Wizarding world knew his background as a Death Eater, so he was rather reserved during the first meetings with his mind healer, Miss. Wright, who was a calm, thirty-something-year-old witch with a benevolent look on her face. To be honest, the first meetings with Miss. Wright had felt awkward and just pure a waste of time, but after a few meetings, Draco still couldn’t see any signs of disgust or hate in Miss. Wright’s words or gestures, so he started to open up a little. It wasn’t much, he mostly talked in a dismissive tone about other students calling him names, but it still felt like the burden on his shoulders lessened a bit. The best thing about Miss. Wright was probably that she didn’t push Draco too much. She asked questions but let Draco answer as broadly as he wanted and at his own pace. At some of her questions Draco didn’t even want to answer, and she told that was quite okay, too.
“My father wanted to send me to Durmstrang so he made me study it during my homeschooling before Hogwarts. My mother didn’t want me to go that far away, so I came to Hogwarts instead,” Draco said, shrugging. “Don’t look that shocked, Norwegian isn’t that difficult. It’s a Germanic language so it’s a rather easy one to learn for English speakers.”
“Merlin, no. Ginny’s the only one of my friends who knows. And one of his friends knows about us as well.”
“We as who?” Draco cut Harry short. Harry felt uneasy. He hadn’t wanted to keep DA as a secret, but it felt somehow bad to talk about it to Draco. Mainly because Draco was a prefect and knowing about DA would put him in a difficult position, but also because there were no Slytherin students in DA at all. At first, leaving the Slytherins out had felt an obvious solution, but as the autumn had proceeded, Harry had started to ponder if he and his friends were now the ones being prejudiced.
“But what if it doesn’t work out? What if he leaves me again?” Harry blurted out.
“So, shall we see what the house-elf friend of yours has prepared for us this time?” Blaise asked, seizing the basket and sitting down on the armchair that was next to Ginny’s.
“Quiet!” Snape snapped. “Do you have any idea how dangerous this arrangement of yours is? You’re playing with things you know nothing about. What if the Dark Lord gets to know about your sweet, little teen romance?” Snape went on ranting. “Or your parents, Draco?”
The kiss became fast quite heated, and Harry could feel himself getting quickly aroused again. This time Harry found his hands nudging the hem of Draco’s shirt meanwhile Draco lifted his arms eagerly.
“Potter, you sure are aware that they’ll be able to restore his memory before long?” Draco said grimly as Potter pushed the heavy door open.
Draco froze suddenly, looking shocked. “I didn’t know,” he whispered.
The next day Harry spent having his head in the clouds, and he barely noticed as his legs followed Ron and Hermione from one class to another. He hadn’t been able to sleep at all at night as his body had been all too awake and restless and his mind had kept coming back to the thoughts of Malfoy. He couldn’t believe the previous day had really happened, but when Malfoy had smiled at him quickly at lunch, he had become relatively sure it all hadn’t been just a dream or his imagination.
“Manners Potter, or I’ll have to give you a punishment,” Malfoy sneered maliciously, poking at the prefect badge on his robes. “As you can see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
When the tea was ready, Draco sat down on the table and looked out of the window into the darkness. Even though the days were still quite long, it was all too early to see even the break of dawn.
The weekend had felt like a safe haven. No Dolores Umbridge, no frustrating lessons, no continuous stares and gossiping, and, last but not least, no Draco sodding Malfoy. Or so Harry had thought. All Harry wanted was to hide the whole weekend behind the closed curtains of his bed, but the reality hit him early on Saturday morning when Ron pulled Harry’s curtains open. Ron was bursting with excitement, and he made very reluctant Harry to get up and discuss Quidditch tactics first thing in the morning until Harry made an excuse to visit alone the Owlery before breakfast. Although he didn’t manage to get left alone in the Owlery either as he bumped into Cho. Harry didn’t know if Cho noticed, but their encounter felt, well, somewhat awkward after what had happened with Malfoy last night. His infatuation to the Ravenclaw felt now something really distant and even dreamy-like, as if it never had really existed in this universe.
They uncurled themselves from each other, stood up and started to look for their clothes. Once they both had got dressed, Draco came to stand in front of Harry and put his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
“Er, yeah, just fine. A little tired, you know, Umbridge and all. I think I’d better go to bed,” Harry managed to say awkwardly before heading to the staircase.
The expression on Hermione’s face softened a little. “I can’t stop worrying for you. For
Draco felt his cheeks flaming with embarrassment. “I’m sorry, you know, for everything I did. For what it’s worth,” he muttered, not being able to meet the Gryffindor’s eyes.
“They’re curious, they just want to know more about it and see if they can find life on another planets or galaxies,” Harry said, shrugging.
The door opened, and Ginny peeked into the room. “Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting something?” she asked hesitantly, not daring to come in properly.
“Oh, that’s really nice of you, Dobby will be thrilled. Send him greetings from me!” Hermione said, and Harry squeezed her hand once more before exiting the common room.
“Actually, neither can I,” Hermione said, sighing and looking like she was about to fall asleep over her essay.
Harry considered Draco’s words. Following the auroras moving in the sky, he could definitely see where the belief Draco had mentioned came from. It looked like the auroras were rejoicing and dancing across the sky, not knowing or caring about the sorrow and misery below them. Harry gulped, feeling his throat tight all of a sudden. Who knew, maybe even his parents were there. And all the others he had lost. Maybe they had come there to greet him and show him that they were alright and happy, wherever they happened to be.
“So you

Draco gave a hollow laugh before he managed to regain his composure. “I’m fine, all things considered.”
When the door was closing behind them, Draco cast one more glance at Harry who was standing completely immovably in the room, looking like petrified as he was staring back at Draco a disbelieving and wrecked look on his face. The moment was over in a second, and then, Draco was running again, trying to catch the other Death Eaters with his father.
, just stop pressing me,” Harry said, exhausted. “Ron, I’m gay. There. Can we go to sleep now?”
When the door had closed after Draco, Harry stood up, slumped into his bed without even changing his clothes and curled up into a ball, shaking. What the hell was wrong with him?
As Draco sipped his tea and regarded the nocturnal garden, his thoughts started to wander again. Sleepless nights made him always recall the times when he hadn’t been able to fall asleep at night as a child. Not being able to sleep had always made him anxious as somehow the darkness of the night made his fears and sorrows feel so real and oppressive, and he just felt so, so alone. Every time he hadn’t been able to fall asleep, his mother had somehow sensed it and come into his room. Call it a maternal instinct or something. Even though those nights had always started with anxiety, they had ended up being one of Draco’s favourite memories from his childhood. During the days his mother might have seemed to be quite cold and distant, trying to raise him a proper young pureblood man, but during the nights she had been something completely different. She had taken Draco for short walks on the Manor grounds, they had asked the house-elves to make them hot chocolate with marshmallows, they had built a fort of pillows and blankets, and sometimes his mother had just held Draco, combing his hair and humming songs he had never heard before.
“We didn’t
one. Instead, there seemed to be several truths people believed in and followed faithfully. Technically, Draco would have had the opportunity to choose another truth and follow it, but by the time he had realised it, it had already been too late. He had already had the Dark Mark printed on his skin, proudly decorating his arm, and telling everyone what truth he had chosen to follow. He had been far too deep in the truth his parents had told him, and there had been no turning back anymore, not at that point.
“No! Yes! I don’t know!” Harry exclaimed. “I need some time to think, this is too much,” he continued, turned around, and left the bathroom, Draco’s weeping echoing in his ears.
But he also knew Draco hadn’t even been at Hogsmeade that day, so it was possible, or maybe even probable, that Draco actually had nothing to do with the whole necklace case. Harry tried to cling to that thought desperately, shutting out all the other voices in his head that were telling him how there was no way Draco would be completely innocent in this case.
“Harry, you’re my best friend and we’ve known each other for years now. It’s been quite obvious you aren’t entirely straight, to say the least.”
“You were saying?” Harry said lightly, spinning his wand carelessly between his fingers.
“Norwegian?” Harry spluttered. “Why on earth can you speak Norwegian?”
“You mean because of my connection to him?” Harry asked.
“So?” Malfoy snarled.
feel happy, but he knew that if they were to keep on going, Harry would want more at some point. Not now, maybe not even in a year, but at some point, he’d get fed up with hiding and secrecy. There were already too many secrets in his life and keeping them felt all-consuming.
“I didn’t do anything, just grabbed his wrist,” Harry snapped crankily.
Ginny gave a piercing look at Harry. “But you still wear it.”

“I told him,” Ginny said before Blaise had time to answer. “I hope that’s okay, I mean, it’s hardly a secret anymore.”

“Well, as far as I know, when someone’s teaching Occlumency, they’re not going to
“You’re tired?” Harry asked.
“Draco!” Ginny cried and jumped to Draco’s neck. “Are you alright? Why didn’t you try to contact me? I tried to ask
One evening Harry was walking back to the Gryffindor Tower, holding his aching hand tight. His wound was already so deep he couldn’t hide it anymore right after the session, and his robes were damp with blood as he tried to hide his hand under them.
“Oh yes, they are. They aren’t stupid, you know. And you’re not being horribly discreet about it,” Ginny stated firmly. “Honestly Harry, nobody would care if their archnemesis was looking ill or pale or was not eating.”
When Harry’s back met the wall behind him, Malfoy pushed his chest and waist against Harry’s and took Harry’s arms, pinning them against the wall. Malfoy started kissing him heatedly, slipping his tongue into Harry’s mouth without hesitation. Harry felt powerless to struggle to free himself from Malfoy’s grip as he felt Malfoy’s body flush against his and Malfoy’s warm mouth on his as he kissed Harry passionately.
Harry and Ginny had made it a habit to take a walk once a day to a small and quite unpopular playground nearby. It was a win-win situation for both of them; Harry got to send some messages to Draco while Ginny, being desperate to get out, got to take a break from Grimmauld Place. A couple of times Harry and Draco had even managed to agree to use their phones at the same time, which had, in the end, been much more fun than ten monologue-like text messages from one of them in a row.
Harry had never been a big fan of clichés, but right that moment the only thought in his mind was that Draco looked like an angel, fallen straight from the sky. His slightly wavy hair was spread out on the pillow, glistening in the morning sun, and the look on his face was emanating serenity. Harry wanted to touch him so badly he started to ghost his forefinger over Draco’s rose-coloured lips, not wanting to wake him up.
Draco bit his lip, looking like he wanted to argue, but he refrained from opening his mouth.
“It’s just me,” Harry said in a low voice as Draco looked all around him, frightened.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, even though he knew what Malfoy was referring to.
--*--*--*--*--
Everything had seemed to be as usual. Harry had actually been in a very good mood, looking forward to spending the day with Ron and Hermione and the evening and night with Draco, but the incident with Katie Bell and the cursed necklace had left Harry restless.
“’Course now. What did you think, tomorrow when it’s rainy and cold again?” Ginny said, kicking her brother gently in the shin. “I mean, we’ve got to stock up on vitamin D as we still can and all.”
“I think you’ve nothing to worry about. Just be honest with him, he must know by now strange things just happen to you,” Ginny said reassuringly.
du kan nästan ta på dem.
“Are you feeling any better?” Draco asked in a calm voice, running his hands slowly up and down Harry’s back.
untrustworthy.”
Kissing Draco was weird. At first, it felt like they were tiptoeing around each other, as though they were both feeling somehow scared or threatened. Soon the kiss turned into frantic and desperate with tongues and teeth and gasps and with definitely no finesse at all. Draco’s body felt somehow strange under Harry’s fingertips and against his body as Draco was clearly bonier and maybe even a bit taller than before. But still, Draco’s body felt so familiar, as if Harry knew every angle and every curve on it. And every little spot that made Draco gasp and groan with lust and pleasure.
Draco chuckled and took Harry’s hand. “Come here,” he said softly and pulled Harry into a kiss.
“Malfoy. You’re staring at Malfoy again,” Hermione said, annoyed, making Harry quickly snap his eyes from rather nauseous-looking Draco.
“I’ve kind of gotten used to it,” Harry said, shrugging. “I don’t usually even hear them doing that anymore.”
Draco didn’t say anything, he just smiled softly at Harry before pulling him into a slow kiss.
“Malfoy,” Ginny said stiffly, nodding back at Draco.
“How much have you drunk exactly?” Ron asked and hiccupped. Harry could hear he was trying to sound like he hadn’t drunk anything other than water that night, but he was swaying quite a lot on his feet it was clear he wasn’t that sober either.
“Or no, well, what I mean is that it doesn’t matter if you fancy boys, girls or both. I’m just really, really happy you’re being open with yourself, and that you wanted to confide in me with this. I was just surprised you were ready to talk about this.”
“No, we haven’t gotten it yet. Has something happened?” Molly asked, worried.
“Oh, nonsense. Did you really think we’d invite you here to celebrate Christmas with us and let you avoid our traditional Christmas presents?” Molly asked, smiling softly at Draco.
“Say hi to Blaise for me” Hermione exclaimed as the portrait swung shut behind Harry and Ginny.
” Hermione had stated.
Draco pulled back a little, turning his gaze to Harry. “That was fucking scary. I’ve never seen Severus like that.”
“Erm, I don’t really know if I’m in a mood,” Harry said, hesitant.
“Why don’t you tell me?” Harry cried, the tone of his voice turning from pleading to angry.
,” Granger muttered. “
“Out! Get out of my sight!” Snape exclaimed, not being able to hold back his rage anymore.
Harry sighed and laid down on his bed. Even though Dudley did get on his nerves, Harry felt also oddly… happy? Or content? Or perhaps normal? It felt luxurious in the middle of everything to get to worry about something as mundane as your cousin teasing you about your boyfriend, even though the name had gone all wrong. And speaking with Draco on the phone had made Harry feel like he was in a Muggle movie where teenagers were calling to their boy- or girlfriends, speaking for hours about basically nothing at all. Harry could definitely see himself getting used to that feeling.
Harry gave Draco a mischievous smile and started suddenly tickling Draco’s sides, stomach and armpits.
“Yeah, fine,” Harry said and hurried to the storeroom.
“I get that kind of thoughts aren’t nice, but why are they so harmful?”
Harry froze for a second. “Erm, there’s something I need to tell you,” he said, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
, Harry thought and snorted. What stupid could Harry even do? A couple of beers wouldn’t surely make him lose control over himself. As proof, he started walking towards the drinking table as casually as he could. Which probably wasn’t casually at all, taking into account the curved path he took even though he was sure he was walking straight.
“Do you think something has happened to him?” Ginny asked and sat down on the grass.
It felt fantastic and so, so liberating. Harry had always known Malfoy was an excellent flyer, but they had only ever flown together playing Quidditch on the opposite sides. This time there was no pressure or other students watching, so they were rather cheering each other to try their best. Even the usual rivalry between them had started feeling more like playful teasing from both sides.
“The mystery boy, the one who kissed you!” Hermione said and gasped. “I should’ve realized, you told me someone kissed you and then you started to ask about the pureblood culture all of a sudden and all.”
Snape examined Harry and Draco for a long while, dark eyes flaming with fury and lips curving down with distaste. “No,” Snape said finally. “But you’d better think this over. You’re not going to be able to keep this a secret for a long time. The question isn’t
Harry halted abruptly. His dizziness had worsened making his body feel numb, and for a moment he could see nothing else but stars.
That was until Ginny burst into the common room from the corridor where the dormitories were, Blaise following right after her.
“I thought you would,” Harry said, sighing. “When you said you’d be dogging my footsteps this year, were you referring to him?”
“It’s because I… It’s because we…”
“No, it’s alright, I’ll just pay a short visit and be right back,” Harry said reassuringly as he opened the doors and stepped outside to the brisk autumn air.
--*--*--*--*--
on your thoughts. They rather see one image here and another there, as if they were sitting on a train and viewing a rapidly changing landscape,” Ginny told Harry, as if reading his thoughts.
“Yes. She’s a bit of a horror, though, teasing me whenever she can. But she actually covered up for me so that I could come here to see you yesterday,” Harry said and groaned as a sudden realization hit him. “I’ve no idea how I’m going to explain to Hermione and Ron where I’ve been for the whole night.”
“Hey, I forgot to tell you! I think I might’ve a place for us to practise Defense,” Harry said, desperate to change the subject.
“No, I mean, I was just trying to get into the Room. You know, the one where we were together,” Draco said, blushing. “But it’s broken.”
“Mother,” Draco said, bolting upright as he saw his mother entering the cell. “What are you doing here? How did they let you in?”
“Is there something else than just friendship between you two?” Sirius asked, eyes glinting.
Feeling as if someone else was steering his body, Draco stood up, turned around and walked out of the room. There were no thoughts in his head, he couldn’t even remember his father telling him to pack whatever he wanted to take with him. His feet led him first to the entrance hall, then out to the garden, and then finally out of the Manor grounds through the front gate.
Harry was silent for a moment, looking at Draco’s hand resting warmly on his knee.
“I already told you that you’re not a charity case.”
“Is that so? And what might have caused such a radical reorganization?” Harry murmured back, his lips ghosting over Draco’s lips.
“It’s not just some stupid black lines,” Harry said stubbornly.
As the door had closed after Blaise, Harry felt himself suddenly really strained. When he glanced at Draco, he noticed the other boy looked also quite uncertain, tapping nervously his leg with his forefinger.
--*--*--*--*--
Before neither of them noticed, they were rutting against each other. It was an exhilarating and new sensation that made Harry’s body feel like it was in flames all over. Feeling Draco’s crotch against his, even with all the clothes on, felt so overwhelming, and all Harry could think were the words
“A Christmas party before Christmas. Does it ring any bells?,” Harry said, shrugging.
“It wasn’t me who hurt him, it was actually he who punched me in the face, remember?” Harry said, huffing.
“I don’t trust the house-elf,” Draco said, pouting a little.
i på botten av en sjö.
Draco regarded her for a moment, frowning, but nodded as he found himself too curious to get to know what on earth the Gryffindor was on about.
Malfoy – and Gregory Goyle. But the Wizengamot couldn’t possibly sentence to death also those who had done their punishable deeds when they had been underage or just barely legal adults? They had both still been only students, practically just kids.
Ginny’s eyes widened and she put the hand on her mouth. “Does that mean I finally get to meet your paramour?” she asked excitedly.
“Nothing,” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrow questioningly. “Pansy’s still mad at me, Greg and Vince don’t even notice I’m gone as soon as they reach Honeydukes, and Blaise knows I’m with you anyway.”
The one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time thing is quite straight borrowed from the TV series 'Skam'.
“Oh, sure. There’s not a drop of water anywhere at this party,” Malfoy said as Harry stared at him unbelievingly. “Taste it if you don’t believe me.”
“Go!” Snape shouted, and Draco picked up his bag quickly and left. Now that the comforting warmth of Draco’s body was gone, Harry felt cold as he was facing Snape’s fury all alone.
Draco tried everything he could. He tried to turn around, to kick Harry off, to grab Harry’s hands, all in vain. Then Draco realized to seize Harry’s glasses and toss them aside. Harry froze for a second, feeling taken aback by Draco’s move, so Draco decided to seize the opportunity by turning around before Harry had time to even blink his eyes.
Harry had to bite his cheeks so he wouldn’t laugh. “No, I meant only the firecalls. You can use a phone to call someone or to send messages. I’ll show you,” Harry said and took the phone from Draco’s hands. He showed both Draco and Zabini how to use the phone, and they both stayed quiet, looking positively dumbfounded. When Harry came to the settings section and showed them how to change the ringtone, both Draco and Zabini startled slightly as they heard the first notes of the Nokia Tune.
Blaise looked like he didn’t know if he should be more astounded by Harry using his first name or Harry giving him something as a Christmas gift.
Draco nodded. “Wanted to finish my Arithmancy essay.”
“Could you just hold me?” Harry asked in an exhausted and desperate voice.
“We could try to be friends if it’s okay for you?” Harry asked. “I’d love to have you in my life somehow.”
To his surprise, Draco ended up hanging in the common room much longer than he had originally thought. It helped him a lot to study together with someone, and he actually felt like he learned something as Granger’s enthusiasm for the subject was so contagious he felt getting quite excited as well. At first, Draco had been well aware of the cold stares he was getting, but no one dared to say anything, probably because he was there with Granger. After an hour or so he had forgotten almost completely that there were other people around them, and when Granger started to yawn and said she’d go to sleep around 10 p.m., Draco felt confused by how fast the time had gone.
Hermione blinked her eyes again. “– sorry?”
“Neither have I. Even though he’s usually always angry with me,” Harry said. “Do you think he’s really not going to tell anyone?”
“Well, that’s settled then. I’m off to bed, I’m dead tired,” Ron said, yawning.
“Who’s suspecting me?” Draco snapped.
“Sorry, wasn’t talking to you, it’s just my cousin… Well, I think I’d better go.”
“Don’t be silly, I made you a couple of sandwiches, and I bet Andromeda can make you some tea or coffee so you can wake up properly,” Ginny said, handing Harry sandwiches that were filled with fresh salad, ham and cheese.
“What? Why not? We were supposed to look for some new Quidditch stuff for our next matches!” Ron exclaimed.
Harry stared at Snape, refusing to answer.
“Well, isn’t that lucky for you then that you couldn’t resist me?” Draco said, snaking his arm suddenly around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer. “You don’t even know yet all the things you would’ve missed,” he whispered into Harry’s ear, making Harry shiver.
?” Ron exclaimed as they started to read the front page.
Draco studied the picture carefully. “I bet this isn’t the picture that made you question your sexuality.”
“Harry,” Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, and it felt like coming home after a long, long time.
“Right. Just be careful, alright?” Hermione said before they entered the Potions classroom.
in Azkaban. His father would have obviously been supposed to end up there for years but as he had been physically so sick and weak after the War, Wizengamot had decided to send him to carry out his sentence at the Manor instead, on the condition that he would have no guests, no servants, and he would not get to go out of the Manor grounds. The new Ministry might be suspicious and prejudiced, yes, but not cruel.
“Draco, wait!” Harry said, walking fast towards Draco.
“Mm-hmm,” Ron muttered knowingly. “The next time you go out together, he’s going to try to take the initiative properly. Just mark my words.”
Harry broke off suddenly. As he and Draco had turned towards the door, they both noticed they were no longer alone in the room as there was a tall wizard with long, blond hair, completely black robes and a sneer on his face standing right in front of the door.
“He was one of our house-elves, you remember the one Harry made my father free at the end of the second year?”
“You mean the Death Eaters and Voldemort? Draco, are you safe?” Harry asked, feeling really worried now.
“Right,” Potter muttered, sounding irritated. “Here, I brought you some food,” he said and slammed a big silver tray on Draco’s bedside table.
“What are you insinuating, Weasel?” Malfoy asked quietly, with a hint of panic in his voice.
Malfoy chuckled. “Tell me you want me,” he whispered as he started to rub his and Harry’s erections together.
Later in the evening, when Andromeda had put Teddy already in bed, Harry and Draco were sitting on a couch and Andromeda on an armchair in the living room, sipping tea and watching old pictures of Andromeda, her husband and Nymphadora.
He could worry about all this later.
Another thing Draco was almost sure about was that he was right there where he was supposed to be, in the path that was meant for him, if he happened to believe in things like destiny. And
Harry couldn’t say anything as he was suddenly feeling all too guilty and so, so selfish. Snape had been right all along; he really
“Yeah, more than,” Harry said, smiling euphorically at Ron. Ron’s face was twisting oddly.
Harry didn’t ask Hermione the next day. Nor the day after that. Soon Harry noticed a whole week had gone by and he still couldn’t make himself talk to Hermione. Not that Harry would’ve scared that Hermione didn’t accept him for who he was, but that could still end up being a painfully awkward conversation. And Harry
“Fine, I’ll come with you.”
“This isn’t about me. You’re the one who has to decide if you want to be on my side or on the side that wants to slaughter me.”
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. “I’m okay with usual taunting, I really am. But insulting my dead mum, or me not having my mum alive, it’s way beyond.”
Hearing Malfoy using the reference to Sirius, with or without knowing, for the second time during the week made Harry see red. He pulled his wand out of the pocket and pointed it at Malfoy’s chest.
“Kreacher is busy.”
When he finally made it to the table, he took one transparent plastic mug and poured water into it.
“What if my parents get to know? This is so fucked up, I don’t –,” Draco started rambling, sounding a bit panicked.
Harry laughed dryly. “There’s nothing to tell, really. Everyone’s kind of ignoring me, which I don’t mind otherwise but it’s getting boring as hell.”
“Couldn’t you at least put an and-baid on it?” Malfoy asked after a moment.
--*--*--*--*--
“Bye,” Harry said and ended the call.
--*--*--*--*--
“Don’t, just don’t. It’s been my conscious decision, not yours.
“But he doesn’t know that!” Ginny snapped.
Here's my fucking brokenness.
“So, there’s absolutely nothing we can do before Voldemort’s gone.”
“Are they out of their minds? Why would anyone want to travel to Space?”
“Are you alright?” Potter asked, panting slightly.
When the lesson was finally over and all the students started to march to the Great Hall for dinner, Harry made a split-second decision to take his Cloak out of his pocket, put it on and dart to follow Draco, who had apparently decided to skip the dinner altogether as he, unlike all the other people, walked towards the Slytherin common room instead of heading to the upper floors.
“Thanks, Gin,” Harry said, feeling truly thankful to her. “Should we go back inside?” he asked, shivering slightly as the sun had almost disappeared behind the horizon.
--*--*--*--*--
“No way, you just broke in?” Harry asked, eyes widening.
“Why do you ignore it?”
The look on Draco’s face turned immediately disgusted. “Ugh. Is this really what Muggles are used to drink?”
--*--*--*--*--
They laid down, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest and Harry’s arm snaking around Draco’s chest while his other hand started stroking Draco’s hair. Neither of them said anything for a while, Harry just enjoyed the feeling of having Draco close to him again, smelling his familiar scent and hearing him breathing serenely.
Draco sighed heavily. “Mother, I know you know what there was between me and him. I know Severus told you.”
“There’s nothing you could do, so just drop it,” Draco said stiffly. “Tell me about your holidays instead.”
“How’s it going?” Harry asked, squeezing Draco’s thigh.
min elskede = my love
“Don’t be an idiot, you can’t just bleed all over our potion,” Malfoy said and transfigured a parchment into a small rag. “I can’t do any Healing Spells, but I think this should do.
“Fine, fine, I’m coming,” Ron said, getting up off the couch.
“Harry, please. He’s feeling upset, just listen to him. I’ll make sure no one comes to disturb you,” Ginny said, nudging Harry in the side.
At least they had Blaise Zabini if no one else.
“I didn’t put our past aside, I just – well, it doesn’t matter anymore.”
“Or maybe you will if you don’t know how to shut up,” Harry snapped back angrily, trying to keep his voice down.
“No, but ‘Mione, I was talking about how he saw us snickering and then just buggered off. Didn’t know he’s this sensitive,” Ron said, still with a perplexed look on his face.
“Yes, I’m sure. We’re, erm, friends of sorts. So, no need to worry,” Harry said, trying to reassure the elf. “Thank you, Dobby.”
“And how did they take it?” Malfoy asked, sounding quite curious.
Making Draco come to the Burrow had been its own battle of sorts. In the morning on Christmas Eve, Draco had started panicking slightly and he had told Harry and Andromeda to go without him and that he’d be completely fine celebrating Christmas alone. Once Harry and Andromeda had managed to remind Draco that Ginny, Ron, Hermione and even Blaise were going to be there and that the invitation had definitely included Draco, too, he had agreed to come, though looking rather stiff and nervous.
side that’s responsible for the Wizarding Britain right now. You should trust the legal system
Harry startled and turned around, trying desperately to see who had called him, but in vain. He was wrapped in a thick, threatening, evenly grey mist, and no matter how hard Harry tried to focus his sight, he couldn’t see anything else but oppressive, wavy greyness all around him.
“Well, as it’s not red and moth-eaten all over, I think this is passable,” Draco said, teasing.
“I already told you I like you!” Malfoy hissed back.
“So what?” Harry snapped.
“And Bellatrix and Narcissa got to stay in the family?” Harry asked, trying to pry discreetly more information about Sirius and Narcissa’s relationship.
“Is this how much trust you have in me?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow and acting hurt. “No, I didn’t have to use magic at all. I actually think I did rather well, all things considered.”
“He’s helping George in the shop,” Hermione said, tasting the noodles with the chopsticks. “How did it go at Andromeda’s?”
Suddenly, someone knocked on his door, making Draco startle as no one had shown any interest to pop into his room this school year.
“Out with it. I can see there’s also something else bothering you.”
“Afternoon, gentlemen,” Snape drawled.
“Yeah, right. Based on what I saw yesterday, they really had fed you properly in Azkaban.”
“He is. Had never even talked with him properly before he started seeing Ginny.”
Harry and Malfoy were lying on the ground next to each other, still breathing heavily and both of them feeling utterly exhausted. They had frostbites all over their faces, and their hands were bright red as neither of them had apparently worn gloves. Harry cast a quick Warming Charm on both of them before closing his eyes and falling into silence.
“Please, don’t call him that. He may have not lost his surname but it’s still a sore spot to him,” Andromeda said, hustling around the kitchen. “Sit down.”
For Harry the last lesson of the day, and actually of the whole semester, was Potions. After the previous day’s incident at the Christmas party, Slughorn seemed to feel pity for Draco and pay more attention to him than usual. Similar to the other subjects, Draco was lagging seriously behind on Potions as well, which was highly abnormal to him. As Harry was now the class’s top student, Slughorn seemed to think it wouldn’t cause any harm to pair the two of them together.
”What did that mean?” Harry asked, shivering. Draco speaking Norwegian did indeed some strange things to Harry.
The days following the kiss made Harry’s confusion about Malfoy and his swinging moods turn into grumpiness. To Harry’s misfortune, he happened to vent off his frustration by snapping too often at Ron and Hermione without any valid reason, which made Harry feel even worse. He had tried to explain to them that he was just so tired and angry at Umbridge and her bloody quill, but Harry could see his friends remained suspicious. What was worse, both Ron and Hermione started acting extremely cautiously around Harry, as if Harry was a ticking timebomb that could explode at any minute. But Harry knew there was no way he could tell his friends what was really bothering him. He was pretty sure Ron and Hermione would be okay with everyone else, but not with Malfoy. Besides, Harry didn’t even know what to think about the situation, and even though he was angry with the git, he didn’t want to tell anyone about the situation without at least talking to Malfoy first.
But without you, there would only be chords
“No, not yet,” Harry admitted.
Slowly and with trembling steps, Draco started to walk downstairs, taking support from the walls and railings while walking.
Harry considered Ginny’s words for a moment. “Yes, I trust him. He has changed. Or at least he’s trying.”
Harry’s heart started pounding in his chest. “But what if he doesn’t want to be with me anymore?”
“You know, there are still so many things I don’t know or understand about the War,” Draco said as Harry took a swig as well.
“Hey, what’s wrong with you?” Harry said, stumbling a little.
When Harry got out of the Great Hall, he snatched his Firebolt from the broom cupboard and stormed out. When he saw there was no one else in the courtyard at that time, he started running at full speed towards the Quidditch pitch, letting the cold autumn air ruffle his hair.
“Draco, wait!” Blaise’s voice echoed on the fifth floor’s corridor. Draco stopped and turned around to wait for Blaise. “What the hell has happened? Where’s Ginny? Or Harry?”
“You’re so fucking stupid, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said with a trembling voice, burying his hands in Draco’s hair.
“Ugh, I promise I’ll try,” Harry said, blushing. “I’m still sorry for not listening to you.”
min elskede=my love
“I just came from outside, Potter. You must come up with something else,” Malfoy said, finding his usual, haughty voice.
“Just you and me and Professor Snape,” Blaise answered helpfully.
“An Unbreakable Vow?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrow, and looking much more interested now.
“Yes, you are. You’re working for Umbridge like a good little underling, and Umbridge’s working for the Ministry, and the Ministry is against me and Dumbledore,” Harry said, bolting upright from the couch. “Why can’t you keep a low profile, just like Blaise?”
“Hm, well. We’ll see how it goes on Valentine’s Day,” Ginny said, pensive.
“They’re astronauts. They travel to Space, using that kind of a space rocket,” Harry said, referring to the picture of the rocket.
The worry for Draco had affected Harry’s concentration during their last DA meeting before Christmas, but Harry knew he couldn’t blame it alone for what had happened. During the autumn many of his friends had hinted Cho might’ve some kind of feelings for Harry, but he had determinedly ignored those comments. His mind had been so full of Draco he had actually forgotten all about them. Now that he looked back, he felt himself a bit dumb.
Harry sighed and leaned against Malfoy as Malfoy wrapped his arm around Harry and pulled him closer. It was somehow so relaxing to feel the heat of Malfoy’s body, to smell Malfoy’s somewhat spicy and applely scent, to hear him breathing and to feel his hair tickling slightly Harry’s face. Oddly, Malfoy seemed to know, consciously or unconsciously, how to make Harry anchor to the present moment. His senses had never been as sensitive as when he was near Malfoy. He was so aware of everything he smelled, tasted, and felt, and his skin was always tingling everywhere where it was in contact with Malfoy.
“Oh, right, sorry, my bad. How could I forget I should be okay with you snogging with your girlfriend all around the castle
Draco felt his lower lip starting to tremble, but he had to try to stay strong; it would only make things worse if he showed any signs of weakness to his father. He tried to hold back tears, straightened his posture, and met his father’s cool eyes. But when he tried to open his mouth to say something, his throat felt too dry and hoarse for him to be able to speak at all.
“Yeah, well, I don’t get it, either,” Harry said. “Though I used to dream about becoming an astronaut.”
~BEHM ‘Hei rakas’~
Harry just stared blankly at the tree. It was weird to hear Sirius saying out loud Harry’s thoughts and hopes about Draco. Harry hadn’t dared to think too much about Draco changing sides, but maybe it really was possible if even Sirius thought so, in a way.
“What the fu–,” Malfoy said, inhaling sharply when he saw
For starters, Draco seemed to have a thing to Potter's deep green eyes and his black and always-so-messy hair. Even though Draco was used to comment nastily on Potter's appearance, Draco thought Potter had always been the most beautiful boy he had ever seen with his stupidly pretty green eyes and tousled hair, and even when he was wearing his cousin's old muggle rags. Draco couldn't help the feeling of wanting to absorb every little detail of Potter and his body. He wanted to try how Potter's hair would feel like if he could run his fingers through it, how soft and warm Potter's skin would feel like under his fingertips, how right Potter's flat chest would feel against his own, how well their lips would match with each other…
When he had arrived at the Room, Draco and Zabini had already been there, waiting for him. Everything had felt surprisingly smooth and easy as Zabini had sat down on one of the armchairs, while Harry and Draco had gone to the couch. Draco had laid down so that his head was resting on Harry’s lap and soon Harry’s fingers had found their way into Draco’s hair.
“Should we consider Zabini’s idea?” Harry asked as he took Malfoy’s cold hands between his own and started rubbing them.
“Well, no, but they’d probably be interrogated quite a few times. They might even get house arrest for a while,” Hermione sighed. “It’s not easy for anyone who’s had any kind of connections to the Death Eaters during or before the War. And that includes basically all the parents of the Slytherin students.”
“Draco, how’s it really going?”
“Oh! That’s definitely one way to show your feelings. So, there’s absolutely much more involved than dislike,” Hermione said pensively. “What did you think about the kiss?”
“Yes, and he’s actually quite good at it. Even better than Harry,” Ginny said.
“Think about your mother. What would she think if you betrayed her like this?” Lucius asked, making Draco feel sick. He couldn’t do this; he couldn’t leave his parents. But he couldn’t leave Harry, either. “Come,” Lucius said imperatively, beckoning Draco to follow him.
“Yeah, I remember only the Parkinson case,” Ron said. “Though now that I recall it, I don’t remember Malfoy being with anyone else at school, and he was with Parkinson only for like two weeks or something.”
Sirius took a deep breath and looked Harry firmly in the eye. “Voldemort doesn’t have control over you. Yes, there’s a connection between you. The dream you had is proof of it, but it doesn’t mean he can control you. You haven’t done anything wrong. It’s quite the opposite, really, you saved Arthur’s life.”
And then, with the last hard thrust, Harry came into his pants, Malfoy soon following him. Harry laid down, and Malfoy collapsed painfully on him.
“When will we see each other again?” Draco asked, whispering and pulling Harry against his chest.
“Where have you gotten a phone?”
nutter, but I had no idea she’d go this far,” Malfoy said, sounding worried and looking into Harry’s eyes with a serious gaze.
Harry yawned. He should ask Hermione about this. Maybe tomorrow.
“I told you I was flying,” Harry said and started to pile lamb chops on his plate. He and Malfoy had lost their sense of time until Harry’s stomach had made itself known loudly, thanks to his only half-eaten breakfast and non-existent lunch. They had decided it’d be better if they didn’t go back inside together, so Harry had made it to the Great Hall first, and Malfoy was still probably in the dungeons.
“One is for me and the other for a friend. It’s a Christmas gift.”
Before their trip or going to the Burrow for Christmas, Draco had still one pub night left with his Muggle friends. This time Draco had asked if Harry wanted to join them, if only to show how knowledgeable about Muggle things he was these days, and thus, Harry had surprisingly found himself sitting at a table in a rather crowded Muggle pub in London the day before Christmas Eve, surrounded by Draco and six curious-looking Muggles.
Harry felt blood rushing in his veins just like during their previous encounter on the train, and he grabbed Malfoy’s wrist before the Slytherin had time to walk away. Once again the Slytherin git seemed to freeze as Harry touched him and his mask dropped down letting Harry see the mix of despair and anxiety on Malfoy’s face. Harry stared confused at Malfoy before he got his voice back.
“Mmph,” Draco mumbled, not yet moving at all.
Harry opened a slightly creaking door. He had never been in that classroom before and based on the disorder, cobwebs and dust in the room, it wasn’t used very often.
“Yes,” Draco said again before they both stood up and walked slowly next to the bed.
,” Hermione said warningly.
Lovely.
“Why did you take him in?” Harry blurted out.
Harry sighed heavily. To be honest, he didn’t feel like seeing even his godfather. But it wasn’t fair to Sirius who had been all alone (if you didn’t take Kreacher into account, he wasn’t too much of a conversation partner anyway), locked in Grimmauld Place without being able to go out at all.
“Is this what friends do nowadays, lay on each other's lap?” Draco murmured, the corners of his mouth turning up slightly.
“Yes, Harry, seriously,” Draco answered softly, tucking a strand of Harry’s hair behind his ear. “I know that as a Slytherin I shouldn’t care too much about the fairness, but I still think it’d be nice if one of your friends knew about us as well. Besides, it sounds like the Weasley girl is at least somewhat trustworthy.”
As the potion made its way slowly towards Harry’s stomach, it made Harry shiver as if feverish at first, and then, abruptly, his senses felt awake again and the headache vanished completely. Harry sighed of relief, slumped back into his bed, and closed his eyes again. It was Friday if he wasn’t mistaken, so it wouldn’t do too much harm if he skipped the lessons one morning. Besides, he had been so tired that week he wouldn’t even be able to learn anything anyway, the brain needs sleep and rest and all that.
“Should we go back in? It looks like they’re fading,” Draco said after a while when the night sky was clearly calming down.
Ron startled, looking like Harry breaking the silence had made him break free from his own coma-like state. “Good to hear it’s not only me.”
“Maybe they are taking a nap?” Ginny said, looking at Harry, puzzled. Andromeda didn’t usually forget their visits.
“I know,” Harry said in a hoarse voice as he suddenly had to swallow back tears.
When the game started, Harry and Draco were helping Ginny and Ron quite a lot at first, but as it wasn’t an easy task to play as a mix of a seeker, keeper and chaser all at once, they both gave up and started to look after the snitch properly.
“You asked Dobby to help you?” Harry asked, suspicious.
“God, don’t Obliviate anyone,” Harry said, laughing. “It’ll go fine, as long as you keep your wand in your pocket and out of sight.”
Harry didn’t know he could feel both so guilty and happy at the same time. “Yeah, Gin, likewise. Truly.”
“That’s not –” Harry started saying, but Ron cut him short.
“But that’s still not enough, I think I’ll never be able to do enough,” Draco said. “You know it as well as I do, we were never meant to be one of those couples who would run hand in hand into the sunset and live happily ever after,” he whispered, starting to feel tears pricking his eyes.
“So?” Ginny asked, snapping Harry back to reality.
“A bit too late now,” Harry said sarcastically. “Look, for some reason I’ve started to, er, like you, but I can’t go on like this,” Harry said before turning to his side to face Malfoy.
--*--*--*--*--
“I’d say ours. He just likes to get attention and irritate people,” Ginny said, shrugging.
“A little,” Harry muttered, shrugging.
“Compared to you I very well might be,” Molly said, smiling. “The War is over, Harry, you’ve got your whole life ahead of you. Now go and live it.”
“No, I’m not. I’ve never even said a word to him,” Draco answered, sounding now annoyed as well.
And then Harry was laughing and crying and kissing Draco all over the face.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered sleepily, kissed Harry’s forehead, and let his body and mind finally relax completely.
“Fine, I s’pose,” Harry said, shrugging. “He’s even going out with them next weekend.”
Ron sighed, looking pensive. “Who would’ve guessed a year or two ago that the ferret would be the one to have more Muggle friends than any of us?”
“We’re not superior to them. We’re just… different,” Harry said. “You know, my relatives think
“I can imagine,” Hermione said. “But what I meant was how did
Harry turned his head so that he could see Draco’s eyes. “Of course I do, wouldn’t be with you if I thought you’d be the same person as when we met for the first time,” he said. “Though it doesn’t change the fact that you
“Mm,” Draco mumbled. “They’re from our garden.”
. He broke up with Pansy, probably because of you. Their relationship wasn’t even remotely real, to begin with,” Zabini explained. “Potter, you don’t know anything about pureblood culture, do you?”
“Yeah. It’s supposed to introduce different careers,” Harry said, showing Draco the cover with the title ‘When I Grow Up’.
“I’ve never tasted this one.”
!” he rambled until Hermione kicked him in the calf.
“Draco,” this time it was Narcissa’s trembling voice calling him. “Come. Please.”
“Lily and James? Of course they’d have. Harry, you must believe me when I tell you the thing they wanted the most was you to be happy and loved. They wouldn’t have cared if it was a boy or a girl who made you happy as long as the person in question treated you well,” Sirius said, looking softly into Harry’s eyes. “So, do I know this boy?”
The sky being clear meant also that it was bitter cold, and they both dressed in several layers and put on beanies, scarves, and thick mittens. As they arrived at the shore, they soon realized that night was the coldest so far as even their nasal hair felt like freezing.
Draco tried to stretch his numb limbs a little, but both his hands and feet met the cold stone wall before he was able to stretch himself to his full length. The cell where he had spent his whole imprisonment time was an extremely small, windowless room where the only source of light was one single torch whenever someone had bothered to light it for him. There had been so cold and damp in the cell for the whole time that Draco could swear the coldness had become a new, permanent part of him, and it was so hard to believe summer was supposed to be at its best outside of the prison walls right now. Even though there had been no Dementors sucking out people’s happy memories in Azkaban for quite a long time, Draco still found it almost impossible to try to remember how it felt like to listen to the birds singing or to smell blooming flowers in the summer wind. Or to lay eyes closed on the fresh, green grass at the Manor, feeling the sun warming him with its every ray.
Even though the distance during the weekend had seemed to be a good thing, Harry hadn’t enjoyed his weekend at Hogwarts that much otherwise. The weather was still horribly grey, dull, and rainy, so no wise human being would go out if they didn’t fancy catching a cold. It had been nice to pass time with his friends and Harry had even managed to get some homework done, but he still felt utterly sullen when Draco stepped into the common room, coming back from his weekend getaway. Draco saw immediately Harry, Ron, and Hermione, gave them a small smile, and came to sit down on the couch next to Harry, making Harry’s heart pound suddenly much faster.
“Hey, I could go flying with you! If it’s okay my broom isn’t as fast as yours,” Ron said, mouth full of toast and sausage.
Harry turned his broom to follow Draco, and, to Harry’s luck, the speed of Draco’s old Nimbus 2001 was nothing compared to Harry’s Firebolt.
Draco gulped as if trying to swallow back the tears before he tried to give the hat back to Harry.
“Yeah, okay,” Draco muttered grudgingly, and Potter flashed him a quick, forced smile before exiting the room.
“Don’t be an idiot. You take me as a twelve-year-old?” Draco asked but accepted the card as Blaise handed it to him. Both Draco and Harry turned bright red as they noticed it was a picture of Harry.
“Here,” Andromeda said, placing a cup of steaming tea in front of Draco. “I’ll go and see what Teddy is doing, he’s been suspiciously calm and quiet the whole night. Do you think you’ll be alright?”
“Er, yes? I mean, I don’t know how much Draco has told you, but it wasn’t, erm, too easy at first,” Harry said, tapping the back of Draco’s hand nervously with his finger as Draco squeezed his thigh again, reassuring.
“Thank you,” Draco said hoarsely after a moment. “Excuse me, um, need some water,” he continued, getting up and rushing to the kitchen without glancing back.
“It was me, actually,” Ginny said as Blaise started to pour Firewhisky into four, small glasses. “Or I didn’t practically smuggle it in, I just happened to find it from Fred and George’s things they left behind when they left.”
“Exactly. And you don’t have to do anything for
“Okay, that’s enough, I have to finish my Potions essay,” Hermione said, pulling back and wiping her tears.
As the day to go back to Hogwarts drew nearer, Draco found himself getting increasingly nervous day by day. It was easy to get distracted during the daytime as he kept himself busy by taking care of Teddy and helping Andromeda at home, but when Andromeda and Teddy had gone to sleep, Draco was left alone with his thoughts.
Harry viewed around the Great Hall, feeling a bit nervous. Most of the students
“Calm down, Harry,” Draco said, turning his eyes to Harry and starting to stroke Harry’s cheek soothingly. “I’m alright. Just didn’t want to worry you as you already had quite a lot on your mind. No one did anything to me, it was just… unpleasant.”
“No, I mean it.”
When the Christmas holidays drew nearer, Harry and Draco decided to make some other plans, too, than just to celebrate Christmas at the Burrow. They both felt like getting away from the country for a week or two would be a good idea, especially as Harry had never been abroad in his whole life. They pondered different options for a while, but in the end, choosing a travel destination was quite simple as neither of them wanted to travel too far, and after the War, they both preferred a calm and quiet destination with lots of nature around instead of big and hectic cities. Draco wanted also to practise his Norwegian skills, so after scrutinising Norway’s map for a moment, they ended up choosing a little city called Alta in northern Norway as their travel destination. They booked a Portkey for the Boxing Day morning and started to read more information about Alta and Norway in general, which made Harry feel both nervous and pleasantly excited. The winters weren’t that warm in Scotland, either, but in northern parts of Norway it could sometimes get as low as -30 Celsius, which sounded so cold Harry could almost imagine himself freezing to death. And the sun. Harry was used to days becoming seemingly shorter in Scotland during the wintertime, but how was he supposed to survive a day in a place where the sun didn’t rise at all in December? Like how dark was that going to be?
Draco stiffened when Harry came closer but he still didn't pull away. “Are you sure you know what you’re talking about? What if I hurt you again?” Draco asked hesitantly. How could Harry trust him when Draco felt like he couldn't trust even himself?
“I miss you too. But it won’t be long until we can be together again,” Draco said softly. “When are you going to the Weasleys?”
when they met. Should Harry take Exploding Snap or Wizarding Chess with him? Or maybe some homework? He knew he’d feel somehow naked if he didn’t have anything with him for some kind of backup plan.
“Of course, it would be such a great honour for Kreacher,” the elf said, bowing so deeply his nose almost touched the floor. “Kreacher is going to make supper now, there must be a proper feast for the guest of honour,” he went on, Disapparating from the hallway with a loud bang.
“So, was that gay enough for you?” Malfoy asked and started to kiss Harry along his jawline.
Harry chuckled. “I don’t think so, he won’t probably give up the blonde hair as long as you’re there.”
Ron snorted. “If you wanted to set an example of the House unity, why not hang out with some Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws as we already do? Or even with Pansy Parkinson, anyone would be better than the ferret.”
Harry pocketed the present and drew Draco closer by putting his hands on Draco’s waist. “Thank you,” he said softly against Draco’s lips.
“Well, that was odd,” Ron said, lifting his eyebrows.
“I –” Narcissa began and her lip started to tremble. “I want you to be part of my life again.”
“Of course it’s okay. Ginny asked you first anyway,” Harry said, trying to sound reassuring even though he did feel a bit uncomfortable, to be honest. He just couldn’t quite figure out why. “Truce, remember?”
But Draco had been wrong. Now that Harry thought about it, Draco had probably been making false promises to himself as well.
“I’m going to taste the wine,” Malfoy whispered and put his forefinger and thumb on Harry’s lips. “Open your mouth.”
“You smell so good,” Harry said, almost whispering. “Apples.”
“I’m not going anywhere.”
They didn’t have a chance to meet the next day, though, as the first time Harry had time to take a breath after their last encounter he was already in Grimmauld Place.
“Fine,” Draco said stiffly, his expression completely blank.
”Don’t you even try. I know you’re now calling me names or something,” Harry said, pinching Draco’s arm.
“Who are you talking to?” Dudley asked, looking at Harry suspiciously.
“I’m ever so sorry the facilities of this place may not be very fitting for the Saviour of the Wizarding World,” Draco said, waving his hand at his surroundings. “If I had known in advance that such an honourable guest would bother to come for a visit, I would definitely have cleaned up a bit.”
“You have no idea how happy you’ve made me,” Harry said, pulling Draco into a proper kiss.
Besides, even if the dream had been true and Malfoy really had asked Harry for help, he had meant everything he had told Malfoy in his dream. He, Ron, and Hermione had really already
“I don’t know where that absurd idea of yours comes from, but he was most certainly not trying to, erm, seduce me,” Draco said quite stiffly. “He was just trying to be nice. We’ve got quite a lot in common.”
Harry chuckled and dragged Draco to the couch, snatching his glasses on the way. He sat down and pulled Draco to sit between his legs, Draco’s back leaning on Harry’s chest.
“I could see that. Couldn’t just let you go sulking around. Everything’s fine, dad is fine, and we’re all together,” Ginny said, her tone turning to a serious one. “Besides, it’s Christmas. We don’t have too much to be happy about nowadays. Let’s at least try to enjoy our Christmas hols.”
“Like what?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual even though his insides were twisting rather uncomfortably.
“Well, we three are practically only children in our families, so I think it’s actually Ron who’s supposed to be the one with the most experience here,” Hermione said.
Potter glared at Draco, eyes shooting daggers. “Fuck you, Malfoy,” he said through gritted teeth, turned on his heels and slammed the door shut right in front of Draco’s nose. Draco held his breath for a while and listened to Potter stomp down the stairs and slam the front door shut as violently as Draco’s bedroom door ten seconds before.
“I hadn’t,” Harry said and seized his cup. “Thank you.”
“Harry! For goodness sake, where’ve you been?” Hermione exclaimed when Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table for dinner.
to teach,” Harry whispered uncertainly. “But you’re right, ‘Mione, we definitely need to practise.”
“What are you doing here?”
“Okay,” Draco said, confused as he had no idea where this conversation was about to go.
“Like why did Severus have to tell my parents about us?” Draco asked gloomily, making Harry get goosebumps. That was one of the topics Harry would love to ignore until his dying day if it only was possible. “He told me he wanted to save me, but I wasn’t safe at the Manor.”
“Dobby,” Draco said, confused, as he saw a ridiculously colourfully dressed house-elf running to him and bowing deeply in front of him. “Er, please, no need to bow. I’m not your master anymore.”
“Oh, Harry, you’re sometimes so blunt,” Ginny said, patting Harry’s arm, comforting. “I told you she was –”
“Merlin’s pants, I’d pay a fortune to get to see that,” Ron said, grinning widely.
“You know, you’re the first person I’ve ever kissed,” Harry said, pulling slightly back and putting his arms loosely around Malfoy’s waist.
“Well, I don’t know if it’s real love or not, I only know it’s a very toxic and manipulative form of love, and that’s what makes it difficult. You may feel safe and loved for real as long as you act like people around you want you to act,” Hermione said. “Anyway, the thing here is that as far as I know there are only very few young people with this kind of background who have been able to leave their families. Usually, people may be able to leave their families when they’re adults who’re already living on their own, having enough distance to their family and the group and having enough social connections outside of the group. The only cases who have been underage when leaving their family and the group are those who have had some sort of supportive adult outside of the group who has kind of adopted them.”
“I think so,” Harry said slowly, feeling uncertain.
“I’m starving,” Ron announced, stalking into the compartment and slumping onto the seat next to Harry. “So, what’s up here?” Ron asked, grabbing one of Harry’s Chocolate Frogs.
been waiting for months and don't want to miss in a million years? Besides, I've planned something for Potter so that he'll mess up with his steps even more with my help."
“Maybe a little gay,” Harry said, and Malfoy returned his hand on Harry’s achingly throbbing cock. “Oh, yeah, definitely a little gay.”
He let his breath out slowly. He was finally completely alone in the house.
As Harry’s eyes found Teddy, he noticed the baby had apparently tried to mimic his kind-of-cousin’s appearance as he, too, had now a blonde and slightly wavy hair and twinkling, grey eyes.
“Fine.”
“Yes. You think Blaise would come too? I mean, it’s Hogsmeade day and all.”
? What’s going on? Malfoy’s the most dangerous and most protected prisoner here, he has no right to wander outside of his cell, he must –”
“I said it’s alright.”
“You know very well why!” Draco yelled back at Harry. “If I tell you the Dark Lord gets wind of it because you’re too obtuse to learn the bare minimum of Occlumency! My parents’ lives are at stake!
Draco raised his eyebrow. “What is it?”
to you. And based on all I’ve heard of them, they loved you more than anything,” Draco said and kissed Harry’s lips lightly. “They even wanted you to learn about these ridiculous Muggle careers.”
“I knew you were a self-centred fool, but this goes beyond me,” Snape hissed venomously. “Did you think at all the danger you’re putting Draco in with your actions?”
“You know what a television is?” Ginny asked, surprised, as she turned her gaze to Blaise.
“That sounds actually a great idea,” Hermione said. “Fresh air would do good so that you two can't sleep the whole day away,” she went on, shooting a meaningful look towards Ron and Harry.
“Oh yes, wasn’t that a fun time,” Ginny said, staring gloomily at his brother. “He could try to learn from Fred and George for once, they barely bat an eye when they hear what I’m doing and with whom. Even Hermione’s being nice to Blaise.”
“Oh, forgive me, your Highness, I should have known the whole bloody doorway was reserved for the Chosen One’s exclusive use,” Malfoy snarled.
“I get that,” Draco said. “Or I don’t, actually. Don’t know how it’s to live without a parent, let alone either of them.”
“Only three beers and two vodka shots,” Harry said, lifting four, slightly shaking fingers up in the air. He counted slowly again and raised one extra finger as he looked Ron determinedly into the eyes.
After the War, Andromeda and Teddy had moved to a small, wooden countryside house with a huge garden about one hundred kilometres north of London. Andromeda had wanted Teddy to be able to play freely in the garden and them both to have a lot of fresh air and nature around them, far from the city noises and commotion, which Harry thought had been a good idea.
“Potter!” Malfoy shouted as he hurried towards Harry.
Draco pulled his hand away, looking miserable. “Harry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to –”
“The water should be exactly 37 degrees, otherwise it’ll burn my skin,” Draco said in a soft silky voice as Potter stepped back into the room, grabbed him by the waist and lifted him up harshly. “And I’d also like to have lavender soap and bath salts, please. And a glass of the finest champagne in the house, if it isn’t too much to ask.”
Suddenly, Harry felt the anger starting to boil inside him. He pushed Draco hard on the chest, making him fall harshly on the floor.
with him, I hang out with Ginny and maybe a bit with Zabini, too. Me and Malfoy just tolerate each other,” Harry said indignantly. He had already gone through this conversation topic countless times with Ron and a couple of other Gryffindors. “I’m not hungry anymore, I’m going to ask how Ginny’s doing,” he said and stood up.
“Where is she?”
Hvis du sier det så = If you say so (again, not 100% sure if this one is correct)
Draco was silent for a moment, looking pensive. “I don’t think so,” he said finally. “But if I didn’t go to the Muggle group and if Andromeda hadn’t taken me to her home, I think I’d already be back at the Manor. I’m not a strong person, Harry.”
“Is that a yes?” Harry asked hesitantly.
?” Malfoy asked, bewildered as he finally let go of Harry’s hand. Malfoy looked worriedly around the classroom as if only now realizing that anybody could have seen him and Harry holding hands and gazing at each other in the eye like some lovesick teenage couple. Luckily, brewing the Strengthening Potion happened to cause a lot of steam and require sharp concentration, so no one could really see anything more but their own potion and their partner.
Soon Harry, Granger and Umbridge had been gone. Before they had left, Draco had tried to suggest to Umbridge that maybe he could be of help if he came with them, but she had only gotten rather irritated that Draco had even dared to insinuate she couldn’t manage two wandless underage wizards on her own. Instead, Umbridge had made Draco stay and keep an eye on the rest of the group.

“I’m sorry,” Malfoy said quietly. “Fuck, I never meant to drag you into this mess.”
And Harry tasted, taking a huge swig at once. Malfoy had been right, it was vodka, but there was no way Harry would admit it to the git. He made himself swallow the liquid, feeling his throat burning and eyes filling with tears.
Sirius snorted. “You actually even saw each other a couple of times when you were still babies.”
“Vi lever, min elskede,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear and kissed his cheek softly.
“Malfoy? Oh, for fuck’s sake Malfoy you fucking idiot, what have you done?” Draco heard Potter crying alarmed from somewhere far away. “Malfoy, stay awake, okay? You stupid twat, just keep your eyes open,” Potter said, slapping Draco’s cheeks gently.
“So, are you feeling tired?” Harry asked with a slightly high-pitched voice.
“That’s true. No offence, Harry, but you’re quite slow at typing messages,” Blaise said matter-of-factly as Ginny started to giggle.
Ginny looked at him with a sad look in her eyes. “You know they’d want to be there for you. You could trust them.”
It was the beginning of October, but the weather was still unusually warm in Scotland, and to the delight of all students, the first weekend of October happened to be a particularly sunny and warm one. Harry, for one, was happily sitting in the eight-year common room, talking with Ron and Hermione. As the weather was so beautiful there was hardly anyone else inside the whole building, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to occupy the most popular purple-coloured couches by the hearth. The atmosphere was light and easy, and Harry could feel himself starting to doze off, listening to his friends’ stream of conversation.
“Yes,” Harry said as he sat down on the couch. He was feeling so anxious now that even his hands were sweating.
It started snowing again when Harry made it to the Boathouse. Luckily the temperature was at least some degrees below zero, so the snowflakes were feathery and light instead of wet and heavy as they made their way slowly towards the ground. Harry couldn’t resist the temptation; he poked his tongue out and caught a few snowflakes on it. They melted instantly, making Harry’s tongue tickle a little.
“Er, they don’t actually know,” Harry said as he ran his fingers through his hair. “I mean, I’ve told them I’m bent but haven’t told them I’m seeing someone.”
Malfoy started to draw lines along Harry’s face with his finger. “I wouldn’t do that again. I want to be with you,” he said softly.
“I’m not stalking Malfoy.”
“Oh, for your secret lover?” Ginny asked, eyes glinting as she gave Harry a mischievous smile. Harry’s face turned bright red.
He could hardly make himself enjoy being in Grimmauld Place even though he had been looking forward to seeing Sirius again for months. It felt like everybody was now tip-toeing around him, as if he was some unreliable and possibly dangerous stranger all of a sudden. Or maybe he was only imagining. Maybe everybody
Draco wrapped the Cloak tightly around himself, even though he knew it wouldn't really help as Potter and the boat were still clearly visible. But if nothing else, the Cloak at least warmed him up a bit and protected him from the biting wind.
Harry smiled against Draco’s lips. “You’re so beautiful.”
“Ugh, and I didn’t get to use make-up or dance for the very same reasons. Even waltzing was seen as something so sinful I didn’t get to take part in the dance lessons our school offered,” Anne said, rolling her eyes. “How about you, Harry? Any weird stuff happened at your childhood home?”
“You can speak here as well, I won’t disturb you,” Molly said.
“They don’t know or understand magic, so it’s quite natural they’re afraid of it. When it comes to the purebloods, they tend to despise Muggles and Muggle-borns without any logical reason.”
“Hey, just try to relax, okay? I meant it, it really is okay that you’re coming as well,” Harry said. “Besides, they’re all your friends as much as they’re mine.”
“I got it, I won,” Draco said, grinning and raising weekly his hand that was tightly closed around the snitch, as he was laying under Harry who had ended up being on top of him after their rolling.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Seriously, Harry, you can’t keep it there if you don’t want everyone to get to know. It’s too massive.”
“Merlin, no,” Malfoy said, horrified. Even Zabini’s expression had turned to a serious one.
“Ginny? I didn’t know you were that close.”
“Of course not. But Malfoy would’ve needed help and support, not someone making his situation even more difficult,” Hermione snapped. “Sorry, that was inappropriate of me. You
“Yes,” Harry said, staring at his lap.
“You know, they hardly ever fall from the sky.”
“So, has your boyfriend sent you anything? We’re that far from Grimmauld Place the phone should be working fine,” Ginny asked.
Just for a warning, there's going to be somewhat more homophobic content (slurs, conversations about homophobia) in this and the following chapters!
The most surprising thing of all during the first weeks back at Hogwarts was probably Hermione Granger starting to approach Draco. It started with lessons where Draco was sitting in the furthermost corner of the classroom, always alone nowadays. One day, Granger just sat down on the chair next to him, nodding at him but not saying a word. After a few lessons, Granger had started to talk to him, at first only by greeting him with a ‘hello’ or a ‘good morning’, which had soon turned into Granger talking about the contents of the lessons and asking Draco what he had thought about their latest essay.
The closer Saturday came, the more nervous Harry felt himself. At first, the Room of Requirement had seemed a perfect idea for a meeting place as there would be no bitter coldness nor fear of getting caught. Then again, Harry realized this would be the first time he and Draco would actually be alone somewhere inside, in a closed room, without any distractions. The thought made Harry feel both thrilled and anxious at the same time. They had only agreed to meet, but they hadn’t decided what they’d actually
“Harry, are you sure
Hermione looked pleased. “I didn’t want to forget the Muggle schooling totally when I started at Hogwarts, so I’ve read quite a lot about history, different cultures and psychology in my free time. They’re really fascinating subjects, actually. There’re so many reminiscent patterns in the Muggle and Wizarding world, and no matter if you’re a Muggle or a Wizard, our brains function similarly.”
“If you really must,” Draco said, withdrawing reluctantly from Harry’s arms.
“Oh, but look at him. I think I’ve never seen him looking like that,” Andromeda said, making both of the boys turn their gazes at the baby.
“They’re like, erm, a Muggle version of Aurors. You see, there are quite many careers in Wizarding World that have a Muggle equivalent,” Harry said, showing pictures of musicians, doctors, lawyers and shopkeepers. “And here are the firefighters,” Harry said, pointing at the picture of a man and a woman in bright red uniforms and a fire truck in the background.
Andromeda gave Draco a small smile, her eyes glinting with tears. “The best way to thank me would be if you just let yourself be happy and accepted the kindness people are showing to you. Don’t let your past determine your future, Draco.”
“Can’t he now,” Harry muttered gloomily. Ron had definitely thought differently still a year ago.
“Erm,” Harry said, dumbfounded. Now that he thought about it, he remembered that Ron and Hermione had told him more than a couple of times he was thinking about Draco way too often, but he hadn’t honestly thought there would be something suspicious about it. Besides, talking secretively to Ron and Hermione about his worry for Draco had taught him about some new and important things, just like about the Unbreakable Vow.
“I guess not,” Harry murmured.
“Fire
But why then had the dream felt like Malfoy really had been there, whispering into his ear and asking Harry to save him?
When Harry woke up, it took him a while to orientate himself. He didn’t know if he had ever felt so light and calm when waking up, as if he had been flying or laying under the stars for the whole night. When he realized he could hear Draco breathing peacefully next to him, smell his applely scent all around him, and feel Draco curled up with him, radiating warmth, he smiled.
“Well, I’d hardly say we’re friends, but it was really nice of her to help me.”
“Ron, should we go in and get some more juice? And see if there’s any snacks or something? It’s quite important to remember to eat something salty during these heat waves,” Hermione said, nudging Ron’s side and seizing the empty carafe.
Draco opened the present really carefully, apparently not wanting to tear the wrapping paper. Harry made a mental note to tell Ginny his mystery boyfriend had appreciated at least her transfiguration skills.
Malfoy crashed his lips against Harry’s, trying to kiss him fervently. Harry froze as he felt Malfoy’s warm mouth moving against his. It wasn’t at all like Harry had thought his first kiss would be, tender, clumsy, shy and thrilling. Something beautiful that would make him have butterflies in his stomach. There was nothing beautiful in Malfoy’s kiss. It was desperate and even violent as Malfoy was pushing himself too hard against Harry, gripping his arms too tight and moving his lips and teeth too harshly against Harry’s as if pleading Harry to answer the kiss.
The last days of the school year passed in a blur. Harry couldn’t find himself caring much about the school or even the O.W.L. results that all the fifth-years seemed to be waiting for excitedly. Actually, Harry found it difficult to care about anything at all these days, and if he could, he would most preferably pass all his time somewhere cuddled up with Draco, which seemed to be the only thing that made him feel somewhat calm and anchored in the present moment.
“Mister Draco is a very good friend to Harry Potter, Harry Potter is so lucky to have him. Dobby has seen how happy mister Draco has made Harry Potter,” Dobby said in a serious tone, huge eyes glinting good-naturedly.
Draco rolled his eyes annoyed focusing again on the doors that lead into the Great Hall, "May I kindly remind you that it was
could have survived the place at all if the current conditions in the prison were supposed to be much better and more humane than before. The absence of Dementors helped possibly marginally but there were still so many other reasons to go nuts in a place like that.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly when they both felt all too tired to move anymore.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry. This is going too far,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
“No, you weren’t. I think he actually got quite fond of you during the fifth year, you started to treat him so much better,” Harry said softly.
“Harry,” Blaise said suddenly in a serious tone, a half-eaten sandwich in his hands. “I’m sorry for your loss, I truly am.”
“Better than Harry,” Draco said, sounding proud.
“What should I say?”
By the end of September, Harry could honestly say he felt rather happy with his life. Or at least much happier than he had anticipated he could feel, all things considered.
“I was there the whole time, in the Astronomy Tower. I heard everything you told Dumbledore.”
“Come here,” Harry said, pulling Draco so that he was laying on him, his head resting on Harry’s chest. “You know, I’ve thought about telling my godfather about you,” Harry said and could feel Draco’s body getting tensed immediately. “I mean, I’d like to tell him I’m seeing someone, I’m not going to tell it’s you, of course,” Harry hurried to correct himself.
“Nah, never mind.”
“Kidding, kidding!” Ron hastened to say. “Just let us know when you’ve got something serious going on with someone.”
“Right,” Draco said, giving Harry a funny look.
“I’m trying to explain what there might've been going on inside Malfoy's head. If you let me.”
“Or we could ask someone of the Order members to have a chat with your aunt and uncle,” Ron said. “Or maybe my parents could talk to them! I could ask them to use the fellytone again to call them.”
“I’ve seen them on telly.”
“Er, that I liked the apple pie,” Draco said uncertainly.
Harry flinched. He had said to Ron and Ginny it was okay if they told their other family members about Harry and Draco as he didn’t want to make them keep it secret, especially now that the Weasleys were so close to Andromeda and Teddy. Harry hadn’t just talked yet about the topic face to face with other Weasleys than Ron and Ginny, and he didn’t even know how much exactly Molly and the others knew.
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry said as he started eating them eagerly.
“She’s brilliant,” Draco said, nodding. “There’s also someone else, Blaise, but he’s still in France and I don’t know when he’s coming back.”
Soon Ginny and Blaise got into a deep conversation about different Muggle things they had used or heard of, and Harry and Draco had time to sigh of relief.
All of a sudden Draco felt his body freeze. For some inexplicable reason, Draco felt a strong and odd pull rising rapidly towards the git. There was something about Potter's stupid, messy hair, his stupid clumsiness, stupid, ugly scar and, admittedly, quite fine dress robes that made Draco feel his mouth going dry and suddenly forgetting all the taunts and hexes he had studied fervently for this very occasion. Draco's stomach flipped as he felt an already familiar fluttery feeling in his chest, this time just much more vivid and petrifying than ever before. Draco's head was totally blank, and he could do nothing but stare at Potter with a somewhat shocked expression on his face.
It was not a miracle Draco's head had been a big mess for a long time. Admitting his feelings finally helped somewhat, or at least his head felt a lot clearer. Now he only had to come up with a plan. Draco had been raised to follow his path, and he knew he should follow it with pride. He could never let his true feelings to show, no one could ever know. The only possible way Draco saw was to try to hide his feelings even deeper. Draco knew he couldn't hide his feelings from himself anymore, but he was pretty sure he would be able to fool everyone else. Maybe he could try to date Pansy during his time at Hogwarts and start courting right after graduating. Draco knew he wouldn't be able to be perfectly happy, but maybe he would be content enough. The happiness of his parents came first, while his own wasn't as important. And how could he even be happy if he didn't have his family or his heritage?
They were chatting lightly, joking and laughing, as they ate. Harry was feeling as if he was a bit tipsy even though the butterbeer Dobby had given them was definitely alcohol-free. If he had known earlier that being friends with the Slytherins would mean so much fun, he would’ve tried to befriend them much earlier. Or, well. He knew it probably wouldn’t have gone that well before this year.
“And I was always so horrible to him,” Draco said, miserable.
But Draco didn’t know what he could have done differently. It had been a stupid idea to even consider his parents would willingly change sides; they would’ve probably preferred to turn their backs to their own son than betray the Dark Lord. Draco had felt like he had been stuck between a rock and a hard place, not being able to move nor think. But he had made his choice, and there was no longer anything to do about that.
“You’re not a prisoner, Draco. They’re having you only until they get all the paperwork done,” Narcissa said soothingly, but with a tired tone in her voice. The wartime had treated her hard; she had lost a lot of weight, her usually healthy, rather thick hair had thinned, and she seemed to have permanent dark circles under her eyes.
“Do you realize that Potter might very well die at the end of all this? And if you do anything stupid, try to save his life, for instance, the Dark Lord is going to know where your loyalties lay,” Snape said. “Please, Draco, save yourself.”
Malfoy didn’t look happy as he narrowed his eyes. “Tell me, Potter, how does it feel being second-best to Weasel?” When he saw Harry’s face turning bright red, he continued, smirking again. “Poor Potty, did I touch a nerve? Just watch yourself because I’ll be dogging your every footstep this year.”
“I suppose,” Harry said, shrugging.
“Erm, yes,” Draco said, taking a long breath in. “Well, as I told you, they didn’t pay much attention to me back then, but it kind of changed soon after that.”
“Sorry, can’t.”
On the other hand, Draco wasn’t completely sure how much of the coldness was due to the bitter coldness of his cell and how much was due to the lack of food as he was fed more and more rarely as the time passed. The last time he had been offered food had probably been days ago. Not that it would have been very surprising as Draco had known to expect this; the death row prisoners were never seen as anything other than a mere burden and a public expenditure to the society. Why invest in someone who would have nothing to give to society? Not to mention in someone who would have no future left at all anyway.
“I mean it. Nobody really paid any attention to me, I was basically in my room or taking a walk somewhere nearby,” Draco said, confirming. “I’d prefer to hear more about
“You remember I promised to show you the firefighters?” Harry asked and kissed Draco’s neck.
Harry knew he shouldn’t have been happy about Ron eating Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with a love potion and falling in love with Romilda Vane on his birthday, but Harry couldn’t help but see that as a new opportunity to connect with Slughorn as he possibly couldn’t turn them away when a student needed an antidote. When Ron was cured, Slughorn seemed to relax a bit, and Harry’s plan went surprisingly well until Slughorn wanted to raise a toast in honour of Ron’s birthday. He opened a gift bottle of mead; mead, that turned out to be deadly poisoned. Either Harry or Slughorn didn’t even have time to raise their glasses before Ron had drunk his glass empty in a matter of seconds and ended up writhing uncontrollably on the floor. Harry remembered luckily the bezoar and thus saved Ron’s life, but Ron still ended up in the Hospital Wing, unconscious.
“Oh, fucking hell,” Potter muttered and came to a halt.
“Relax, only you, I and Blaise know,” Ginny said reassuringly, as though reading Harry’s thoughts. “But I must agree with Blaise. The Mark doesn’t make Draco a Death Eater, so don’t worry about it too much.”
“I know. And there’s nothing, nothing I regret more than that,” Narcissa said. “You have always been my son and you will always be. And I’m so, so sorry for hurting you like that.”
“You’ve got to tell me what’s going on! We could go to Dumbledore together and tell him. He could help,” Harry tried, taking Draco’s face between his hands.
Hei rakas kerro mulle
“Whether you want it or not, you’re still just a boy from my perspective,” Andromeda said, eyes glinting good-naturedly before she turned around and left the room.
“Hm?”
“I can imagine. How many children did they have again?”
“You’re worried about the Dark Mark?” Ginny asked.
Hermione looked at Harry with sad and emphatic eyes, as if she knew exactly what there was going on inside Harry’s head. And knowing her, she probably
“I’m curious,” Ginny said, breaking the silence. “Have you known about them all this time?” she asked, turning to Blaise.
“What have they done to you?” Potter asked, ignoring Draco’s comment completely.
“But she doesn’t know it’s me who you’re seeing?”
Malfoy’s behaviour towards Harry had also changed, and now Malfoy had decided to ignore Harry pointedly. He sat every meal in the Great Hall with his back facing Harry, and he refused to even look Harry in the eye when they bypassed each other on the corridors. Even Snape looked seemingly confused and disappointed when he couldn’t hear Malfoy and Harry’s usual bickering even though they were paired in the Potions again. At first, Harry had tried to get Malfoy’s attention, but he had soon noticed it was a lost cause, so he thought ignoring the git would be the easiest option.
“Probably,” Harry muttered, shrugging.
Both Malfoy and Zabini looked at Harry disbelievingly.
he shouldn’t be kissing Harry, not again. And what the hell, what did Harry think he was doing?
Harry handed silently the small purple and silvery hat to Draco who inhaled sharply as he realized what it was exactly.
“What the fu –”
Harry took a couple of deep breaths and forced a casual look on his face before heading to the Great Hall.
holidays.”
“It’s always so peaceful here,” Ginny said, regarding the garden and its various trees and flowers as they walked towards the front door.
“Of course I did,” Draco snapped. “My mother didn’t want me to take it either, but then the Dark Lord started to threaten my family.”
Draco sighed. “So do I.”
“This is not a laughing matter,” Ginny snapped, stepping on Blaise’s foot so hard Blaise whimpered a bit of pain.
Harry climbed some staircases and took a corridor he had chosen earlier to be his plan B. He checked the Map just to be sure the classroom he had had in mind was still empty.
Both Harry and Hermione glared at Ron, surprised, and Hermione started to look a little ashamed.
“And it’s been ages since I last played against you. I’ve been missing catching the snitch from right under your nose,” Harry said, making the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch a little.
Snape’s Occlumency lessons were another thing altogether. Harry had quite soon noticed he wasn’t particularly good at Occlumency and trying to learn it was extremely tiring. Snape wasn’t a particularly nice teacher, either, but at least he didn’t dwell too much on Harry’s thoughts, just as Ginny had presumed. Probably he didn’t even want to see too much as he knew Harry and Draco hadn’t broken up even though he had asked them to do so.
“There”, Zabini said, sitting back down as Harry and Malfoy entwined their fingers together. “I’m not scared of seeing homosexuals expressing affection towards each other.”
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat. Whatever he had thought he would be doing that weekend, he had definitely not been prepared for talking about his love life with Molly Weasley. “Er, I don’t know. I mean, yes, I think so, but I don’t know if that’s enough.”
“Nonsense,” Andromeda said, waving her hand nonchalantly. “What did I just say about this place being your home now? Besides, I’ve got more than enough money to provide you with the school supplies. You’ve got your N.E.W.Ts this year and all.”
“So, what do you really have in mind?” Harry asked cautiously as they started to walk downstairs.
Molly was silent for a while, clearly considering what to say next. “Oh, Harry, you know you can always be yourself in this house? I just wish you could’ve told us. We could’ve supported you both, we could’ve helped Draco to leave his family earlier –”
“What’s this?” Harry asked, perplexed.
“I think,” Draco said, pulling back slightly and sounding serious all of a sudden. “Well, I think –”
Abruptly, Draco stopped laughing and got tense under Harry. “Move off me, would you?” he said to Harry in a stiff voice.
“No, I don’t think so.”
“No, but you’re still going to kill someone.”
, we just meant to get a bottle of firewhisky,” Harry said, frustrated.
“I’m not hungry,” Draco heard himself saying even though the food next to him smelled absolutely delicious. He knew he was being childish now, but he had no desire to act nicely towards Potter.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake. There’s better be a
“Are you talking about the thing that happened with Severus?”
“Would you mind if I borrowed Harry for a moment?” Ginny asked cheerfully, grabbing Harry’s arm, and yanking him up off his chair.
“Why don’t you tell me about your plan? Draco, I only want to help you, I made the Unbreakable Vow to protect you. I promised to your mother to keep you safe.”
“It’s good to be back, isn’t it?” Ginny asked.
“We’ve already talked about how scary it must be to leave your family and the most of other social contacts you’ve got in your life. Otherwise, it’s just pure psychology.”
“I didn’t say you did, just wondered. Ferret’s never like that, he has always something to say, likes too much his own voice,” Ron said, lifting his hands defensively.
“What did the Carrows say when he refused to torture other students?” Harry asked, incredulous.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, amused, and came to sit on the floor next to Harry.
After talking with Ginny Harry felt a bit lighter and more okay even with the idea of Draco having the Dark Mark now. He still didn’t like it and they still didn’t discuss it more, but Harry wasn’t actively trying to forget about its existence anymore, either. And as the autumn had gone quite uneventfully so far, it had started to feel like the more time passed, the less effect the Dark Mark seemed to have on Draco, and thus on Harry’s mood.
“It can’t be
Harry was silent for a moment. “Look, I know you mean well, but I don’t want to be anywhere near to a Death Eater.”
Hermione closed her eyes and took a deep breath. “God, Harry, you’re sometimes just unbelievable.”
Harry stopped on the other side of the lake. The air wasn’t that cold yet, but as the sun was about to set, Harry could feel a breeze that was like a promise of the upcoming winter. He shivered and took a long breath in. It was always so unbelievable to notice, how soothing an effect nature had on him. When Harry viewed the castle from the other side of the lake, it felt like all the problems inside its walls were so much smaller. Harry knew it wasn’t really a wonder because inside Hogwarts’ walls the Wizarding world was his whole life. But when Harry was alone somewhere in nature, he knew that there was so much more in the world. All the plants, animals, lakes, mountains, stars. Harry felt always so small when his thoughts started wandering around the whole universe. Then even Voldemort started to feel like such a small and harmless human being because there was no way he could be a match for all this. Of course, Harry knew there was nothing small or harmless in Voldemort and that the Wizarding world really was Harry’s whole life, but he felt so relieved to be able to escape from that reality sometimes, even if it was just for a brief moment.
The weekend in different locations was definitely a good thing to Harry and Draco’s tentative friendship as they both had some time and space to think about other things and let their feelings calm down a bit. Talking with Draco had made Harry feel quite a lot lighter and easier, and his head didn’t seem to be as big of a mess as it still had been on Friday morning, and at least some of the things that had been bothering him had seemed to fall into place. Besides, Harry was rather relieved he and Draco now had a proper and clear name to what there was between them, and he was so happy they both still wanted to have each other in their lives. It also made things so much easier as they now seemed to have a bunch of mutual friends and both Teddy and Andromeda were in extremely important roles in both of their lives, so it was definitely a win-win situation for all parties.
“Don’t you even start. How could you have understood me when even I didn’t understand at all what there was going on inside my own head?” Draco said bitterly. “But do you really mean it? That you have forgiven me?” he went on, sounding tentatively hopeful.
Här är min jävla trasighet.
Harry’s eyes snapped open. “Erm, got sorted into Slytherin?”
Draco and Blaise were sitting on a red and white checkered picnic blanket that was full of all sorts of dishes. There were at least three different kinds of sandwiches, a huge fruit bowl, all Harry’s favourite candies from Honeydukes, a treacle tart and butterbeer. In the middle of everything, there was a small bottle of Firewhisky, about which Harry didn’t know who had managed to smuggle it into the castle. Probably Blaise.
“Mm-hmm,” Draco mumbled, his eyes closed. “The beast has drained all my energy.”
Harry took a long breath in and out before answering. “You know what a Horcrux is?”
“Are these from the kitchens?”
“Ah, Draco, I think you’d appreciate this card in your collection,” Blaise said when he had checked whose picture he had got.
“Erm, it’s for a him,” Harry said, squirming a little.
“And you haven’t told anyone else either? Not even the Mud – Granger?”
Harry fell silent again.
tell you?”
“That’s definitely the understatement of the year,” Harry muttered, closing his bag and standing up.
“If your so-called friends don’t want to be your friends anymore after what your parents did to you, they weren’t real friends to begin with,” Andromeda said. “What about the Weasley girl, Ginny? You seem to get along with her quite well.”
“Oh, sure,” Ginny said, snorting. “But honestly, I don’t think you sound that much like a Viking.”
“I missed you, too,” Draco murmured, pulling Harry into a long, languid kiss. “Harry?” he whispered into Harry’s mouth.
“Will you stay?” Harry asked, looking Draco in the eye.
“Excuse me, but I can be nice too,” Draco said, pouting a little.
“Yes. But what does that have to do with anything?” Ginny snapped.
“What about him?”
“Let’s have a walk, shall we?” Blaise said and they stepped out of the front doors into the courtyard.
“Me neither, but I’m going to starve to death if we’ll stay a minute longer.”
“I wasn’t hanging out with Malfoy for some bloody House unity,” Harry said, gritting his teeth and feeling immediately bad about snapping at Hermione for no reason. “Sorry.”
“Yeah but that’s the whole point. If this contraption was wizard made I wouldn’t bat my eyelid, but how in Salazar’s name can this be
“Er, how do you know if you fancy someone?”
When Harry opened the door to the Room, he could find Draco sitting there by the table, reading a thick and ancient-looking book.
“Yes, we’ve already heard all about Malfoy looking pale, Malfoy skiving classes, Malfoy not being interested in Quidditch this year, and Malfoy’s dot disappearing from your Map,” Hermione hissed, talking over Harry. “Though Malfoy not eating was something new, must add that to list.”
But Hermione noticed immediately there was something Harry wasn’t telling her. “What? Did something happen there?” she asked, lifting her eyebrow.
Harry waited still a few days until he managed to gather up enough courage to try to find Draco. He wasn’t exactly scared of seeing him, he just wanted to be sure he had calmed down enough to be able to act a bit more civilized than the last time. He could admit now he had acted like an idiot, and only the thought of it made him turn crimson of embarrassment. He did believe in second chances and thought it would be only fair to let people tell about things from their own point of view, and yet he had acted like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Besides, Harry really wanted to try to solve things with Draco, but he still couldn’t help feeling nervous. Talking with Blaise had made his hopes raise tentatively; maybe there was a way he and Draco could talk things through after all, but he had no idea how as he knew he was still so deeply disgusted by the Dark Mark.
“But you’ve got to do something!”
“Started at Hogwarts, skipped my Muggle education, remember?”
“I can’t marry a woman,” Draco said, almost whispering now and looking at his feet.
And then, Cho had kissed Harry. And he hadn’t backed away.
Before Harry had realized, the days had gotten remarkably shorter and colder in Scotland, and the Christmas holidays seemed to be knocking just around the corner. December had come ever so slyly, but Harry was none the wiser about what there might be going on in Draco’s life. At least not until Slug Club’s Christmas party.
helping,” Hermione said, gritting her teeth.
“Harry!” Myrtle shrieked as Draco let out a yelp of surprise.
At first, Draco had tried to hide in the corners, avoiding everybody’s company, but when people had come to talk to him, none of them showing any signs of malevolence, Draco had started to slowly relax. In the morning on Christmas Day, he was already much more at ease as he sat on the floor with Harry, Ginny, Blaise, Molly and Andromeda, having the blonde-haired, green-eyed, and freckled Teddy on his lap.
“Like a broken record?”
When Weasley and Granger began to say their goodbyes to Potter, Draco stopped listening and fell back into his own thoughts. He was utterly confused by how much effort the trio had clearly put into saving him. Or well, not just
“Harry! Come and sit with us, we don’t bite,” Blaise said, smiling wickedly.
The last time Dudley had mentioned Harry’s nightmares, he had asked with amusement and disdain in his voice if Cedric had been Harry’s boyfriend. As Harry had felt the anger rise in him as usual, he had noticed also some other strange and tingling sensation. The brief use of the word
“I don’t think I’m going to have a party,” Harry said. It didn’t feel right to be celebrating anything so soon after the War even though he had just moved to his very first own flat. He hadn’t been able to move to Grimmauld Place, at least not yet, so he had rented a small flat on the same street to be able to keep an eye on the house and possibly start doing some renovations at some point.
“Er…”
The kiss became messy and fervent. There was too much teeth, Harry’s glasses bumped awkwardly between them, and they didn’t really know how to move their lips against each other’s. Still, it felt like one of the best things Harry had ever experienced. His whole body felt so alive as he pressed it tightly against Malfoy’s, wanting to feel Malfoy’s chest and hips against his own. Harry threaded his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and snaked his sore arm around Malfoy’s waist as Malfoy put his hand softly on Harry’s cheek and ran slowly the other up and down Harry’s spine. Harry was surprised to find out how warm Malfoy felt, having such soft skin in contrast to his sharp angles. His body was lean and slender, but still strong after all the Quidditch training he had had for years now. Malfoy’s mouth was hot and his lips velvety soft against Harry’s slightly chapped ones. When Malfoy’s tongue touched Harry’s lower lip, seeking the entrance, Harry couldn’t suppress the soft moan that escaped from his throat. Harry felt so utterly wrecked, lost in the sensation of Malfoy’s body and the desire to just feel and taste more.
“Put these on,” Narcissa said coolly, handing Draco new, completely white dress robes. “Come to the dining room when you’re ready.”
“Not at all,” Ginny said and bolted upright so fast Harry didn’t have time to blink his eyes. She linked arms with Harry and started to drag him towards the portrait hole.
“So there
“I can imagine,” Andromeda said. “But it would be good if you two could learn to tolerate each other in the same place. You don’t have to talk to him or even be in the same room if you don’t want to, but I’m not sending him away and I still want you to visit Teddy and me as often as you like.”
To Harry’s surprise, Sirius barked a laugh, sounding confusingly a lot like a howling dog. “Harry, you do know why I left my family years ago? I didn’t want to have anything to do with such narrow-minded people who thought they could evaluate other people according to their blood, sexual preferences, wealth and so on. If I judged you, I’d go against my own values.”
“Harry?” Draco said abruptly, turning to face Harry once more.
Andromeda lifted her eyebrow, suspicious.
Draco was running behind the Death Eaters, bringing up the rear. Snape glanced at him over his shoulder every now and then, but otherwise no one seemed to remember he was there with them as a part of their gang. Draco could have simply stopped and turned around. Only if his brain functioned properly because now it felt like there was room for only one thought: follow the others, follow Snape, do as the others say.
To Harry’s relief, someone knocked on the door before Harry had a chance to answer Sirius’s question.
Draco raised his eyebrow. “Have the Slytherins finally managed to make an impact on you?”
“Feeling bold today, aren’t you Potter?” Draco asked with a smirk.
“’Mione!” Harry cried, bolted upright, and hurried to meet her. “You went to the Ministry today, didn’t you? How did it go?”
“Sounds tempting,” Harry murmured, breaking the kiss. “But I really must go now before Ron and Hermione come looking for me.”
“Yes,” Harry said, feeling relieved to see his friends taking him a bit more seriously. “I didn’t hear the whole conversation, but Snape has apparently promised Dra– Malfoy’s mother to protect Malfoy.”
“To Draco’s defence, he’s barely off age, and it’s not like any of us would’ve had big parties when we were in our teens,” Olivia said solidarily. “I didn’t even get to watch TV because it was considered as the Devil’s invention to mess up with our heads.
“I know, my love. I’m sorry,” Blaise said, smiling indulgently at her and giving her a kiss on her cheek. “Though I don’t know if I should be worried about Snape for real, he looks like he’s going to get a stroke if he doesn’t get to murder someone soon.”
“But –”
Harry sighed. “Well, erm, Draco kissed me at the beginning of autumn, and then it got quite messy and then I realized I had feelings for him, too, and then we started seeing each other.”
Hermione had returned to her book, and Ron and Harry had settled down to a discussion of different Quidditch moves when Harry saw from the corner of his eye someone with blond hair entering the Great Hall.
“Oh, good, you let them in,” Andromeda said to Draco as she regarded the three of them, clearly sensing the charged atmosphere. “We had a little accident in the kitchen, I had to change all Teddy’s clothes.”
“This was the hat I gave to Dobby at the end of the fifth year,” Draco said, running his fingers on the material. “Why do you have it?”
“I had a quite nice weekend,” Draco said, shrugging and smiling a bit.
“Dangerous, my arse,” Draco huffed, giving Harry a small smile. “So, are we going to meet this evening or what?”
“God, Ginny,
Nothing could have prepared Harry for the unlike conversation between the very unlike couple, which was taking place in the bathroom. Draco was opening up about his fears with Myrtle and sobbing so violently Harry would have guessed it was someone else if he hadn’t checked his Map beforehand. To be able to get a view of the couple, Harry opened the door slightly, only to see Draco shaking and leaning heavily on the sink, head bowed, and shoulders slumped down. Harry got a glimpse of Draco’s face in the mirror, and the view made him feel almost sick; Draco’s skin was paler than ever, his eyes were red and swollen, and his face glistened with tears that were streaming down at a fast pace.
“Yes, of course, Dobby would be honoured to keep Harry Potter’s secret. But is Harry Potter sure he is safe in master Malfoy’s company?” Dobby asked, looking at Draco with worried eyes.
Finally, after the longest first week Harry had ever had at Hogwarts, Friday arrived and allowed Harry to have a little rest. Before that Harry had one detention left, the one that had prevented him to attend the Keeper tryouts. The night had fallen when Umbridge finally thought Harry had learnt his lesson and let him go. When Harry left Umbridge’s office, he could walk just around the first corner before he had to lean against a wall for a moment. His scar had started to hurt abruptly during the detention and now also his hand was bleeding and throbbing worse than after the previous sessions, both making Harry feel dizzy. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to concentrate only on the coolness of the stone wall behind him.
“The best way you can help me is to be with me. I can’t stand this alone,” Draco said, running his forefinger over Harry’s face.
“Who are you?” Harry cried into the mist as loud as he could, and he heard his own voice echoing softly in an otherwise completely silent environment.
“Yeah. It’s like… A group with really strict rules and traditions you have to follow. You can’t be different, do anything differently nor express different opinions if you want to remain as a member of the group. If you don’t follow those rules and traditions, you might be kicked out of the group. That’s usually a really traumatic experience because the group may be your whole world. I mean like your whole family, all your friends and everything you’re familiar with may be in it. But if you decide to stay in the group, you may have to act that you’re something you’re not or that you think exactly like them even if you didn’t, and it’s usually even more traumatic in a long run than leaving the group.”
“Sounds perfect to me.”
But Harry couldn’t go on as he felt sudden pain when Draco hit him hard with his fist. The blood started to gush out of Harry’s nose, and he could taste the coppery taste in his mouth.
Dobby’s eyes widened in horror. “Is Harry Potter in trouble?” the elf peeped rather loudly now.
“What’s all this about?” Harry asked, coming to stand between Ron and Parvati.
The movement of Draco’s fingers stopped abruptly. “You what?” Draco exclaimed.
“Mate, couldn’t it wait ‘til tomorrow? I hate to be the voice of reason, but we do have classes tomorrow,” Ron said, oblivious about the stares his two friends were sharing with each other.
“Hi,” Harry said, placing his hand on Draco’s shoulder and making Draco startle. “You’re here as well?”
“No, thanks, it’s fine. Maybe we could –” Ginny began but Andromeda cut her off, rushing downstairs and carrying Teddy in her arms.
“If you’re referring to the kiss, then no, I haven’t.”
--*--*--*--*--
“Wait, wait! I want to see too what the Golden Boy has bought to you,” Blaise said and came to sit on the other side of Draco. Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything. Maybe he should ask Zabini if they could try the first-name basis, too.
Harry started to stomp up the stairs but he came soon to a sudden halt as he felt someone grabbing his arm. He turned around, only to come to realize that Draco had decided to follow him.
“I wouldn’t be opposed to the idea of making it a habit to wake up next to you, though.”
And then he walked, walked, and walked.
“Er, I think I’d better head back to Gryffindor. Ron’s already quite mad at me as it is,” Harry said reluctantly and starting towards the staircase.
Slowly, the Slytherin had started to show some signs of change. At first, he had stopped hiding completely in his room and started to pass a bit more time in the common room doing homework with Hermione or talking with Blaise who had finally come back from France. Draco was still seemingly reserved, and he looked quite cautious always when he was alone, but when he was with someone he liked, his whole appearance changed from passive, distant and anxious-looking to more present and animated. Sometimes Harry could see him even smiling.
“Yes, you too. See you in an hour or so,” Draco said, darting towards the staircase.
Ron started to giggle. “Can’t hold your liquor very well, can you?”
“You had an argument with the Sorting Hat?” Draco said incredulously. “I didn’t know it’s even possible.”
To Draco’s great surprise, both of his parents had managed to avoid the sentence
“Yes,” Draco said, smiling faintly back at his mother even though he didn’t know if he was looking forward to going back to the Manor. Well, it would probably be better than the cell, at least.
“And if the three of you could concentrate on the lesson and discuss your private matters in your leisure time,” Professor Grubbly-Plank said, raising her voice and watching pointedly at Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Draco looked Harry straight in the eye and nodded cautiously.
Harry hadn’t broken up with Draco after the scene in the boys’ bathroom. Instead, he had started to pester Draco by trying to make him talk to Dumbledore, no longer avoiding talking about the war or the sides or even Draco’s mysterious task. But Harry didn’t understand. The Dark Lord and his ranks were already much more powerful than Dumbledore and the Order, and the Dark Lord was
I think I got a bit carried away with this chapter, I hadn’t initially planned to write it this angsty. Oh well.
“Let’s just stay here for the whole day,” Draco said as he slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth and slid his hands under the waistband of Harry’s trousers.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “At least swallow before Apparating,” she said, taking Harry’s arm and let him Apparate them to Andromeda’s garden.
“What a fucking gossiper,” Draco mumbled. “And as if you were any better at Transfiguration than me. It’s not that,” he said coolly.
“Mum won’t like it. You’re not supposed to keep in touch with your kinds while you’re here,” Dudley said, smirking.
Now that Draco mentioned it, Harry probably had not. He could see the Milky Way clearly crossing the sky, and there seemed to be thousands and thousands of small, bright dots, all twinkling at them.
In reality, Draco knew he would still have his moments of hesitation, though hopefully, they would be less and less as time passed. And now Draco knew he had people in his life whose love he didn’t have to earn because they already loved and accepted him completely as he was. Accepted him holding a boy’s hand and kissing a boy in a broad daylight. Kissing Harry.
“But the pureblood culture is not a religion,” Draco argued.
Harry took a long breath in, trying to make himself calm down. “With all due respect, Professor, I think Draco can make his own decisions,” Harry said levelly, making himself look Snape straight in the eye.
“I’m not sure, that’s actually what I wanted to ask you. He’s sending me very mixed signals, it’s like he doesn’t like me at all, but at the same time it seems like there’s also something else going on inside his head,” Harry explained, feeling himself relax a little.
Draco was sitting on his bed cross-legged, trying to read the Advanced Arithmancy book, though with poor success as his mind didn’t quite manage to concentrate on anything. All the eight-years had been divided into small rooms with only two beds and desks, and as Draco had been paired with Blaise, he had gotten to keep the room himself completely for his own use so far. Even though there were definitely no distractions or noise, Draco struggled a lot to be able to keep his mind on his studies.
December evenings were cold and dark, and there was a thin layer of glistening snow on the ground. Sun had already set, so Harry could have taken the Cloak off of them, but he preferred to have it on to have an excuse to walk so close to Draco.
“Oh, yes. He was really something special, never met someone who’d be as equally brave and reckless as he was,” Ginny said, pensive. “It was a miracle how full of life he could be after the first war and his time in Azkaban. And he really cared about you, Harry,” Ginny said, turning her eyes to Harry.
our son,” Lucius repeated grimly. “Leave.”
“Er, turkey sounds good, thanks,” Harry said, and Draco handed him one, taking a salmon one for himself.
your protection! I – stop looking at me like that, I know what you’re trying to do.”
Slowly, Harry took a long breath in, turned around, and started to walk away from Ginny and Draco, step by step. He didn’t manage to walk far, though, before Ginny grabbed his arm and made him stop.
“C’mon, they’ll survive without the birthday boy for a moment,” Ginny whispered, poking Harry at the side. “Fetch your present and the phone, we’ll take a walk.”
“Draco, please, not now,” Harry said anxiously, cutting Draco short. “I can’t.”
Harry looked at Ginny questioningly, making her blush. “Blaise?”
“I checked there’re no lessons here today,” Draco said as he pointed at the door with his wand, locking it with Colloportus.
“Stop it, you idiot, I already said yes,” Draco said, laughing.
“It’s up to you, only you can decide if you want to have someone in your life. But, to be honest, giving Draco a chance doesn’t sound like one of those dangerous and reckless ideas you and my son are quite famous for,” Molly said, the corners of her mouth turning slightly up. “And as an elderly lady, I’d hope you youngsters wouldn’t be too scared of life.”
Christmas at the Burrow turned out to be quite an experience that year as all the Weasley children had come home for Christmas, bringing their boy- or girlfriends with them. When Harry and Draco had arrived with Andromeda and Teddy, the house had already seemed to be rather packed, laughing voices echoing all around the house.
“Yes. It’s not really that unusual. Muggles have even specific support groups for people who have either left voluntarily or been kicked out. I doubt there’s anything similar in the Wizarding world, even though there definitely should be,” Hermione said gloomily. “Think about Padfoot, for example. He didn’t believe in blood purity nor pureblood traditions, such as marrying another pureblood and producing an heir, so he left voluntarily. His family didn’t take it well, and as you know, he was made it very clear that there’s no coming back and that he was no longer a part of their family. Padfoot was lucky to have close friends who weren’t part of the same, toxic system, so it was easier to leave. If you don’t have that kind of support it’s really scary to even think about leaving.”
As soon as Harry and Ron managed to come through the fireplace, Molly pulled them both into a warm, tight hug.
go soon? I can’t feel my toes anymore,” Ginny whined next to Harry, shivering slightly.
Harry shrugged. “Slept on the couch, feeling a bit stiff now.”
Harry gave a slightly high-pitched laugh and took Draco’s hand. “C’mon, we’d better go fast before our limbs go all numb.”
Apparently, Malfoy felt their gazes on him, and he lifted his own gaze to stare back at them. As he saw Ron and Harry smirking at him, he went pale and looked frightened. Malfoy seemed to be frozen to the spot until his fork fell from his hand making some of the food on his plate to fly right into Parkinson’s lap. Parkinson started to shout something at Malfoy, but he barely noticed. Malfoy got up hastily and fled the Great Hall without saying a word to his puzzled-looking friends. Harry frowned. Malfoy was acting utterly strangely, as if his and Harry’s mutual taunting was suddenly something totally new and alien to him.
“And Ginny was with them as well?” Blaise asked, sounding worried.
“Never,” Snape started, baring his teeth. “Never in my life have I had to witness this level of stupidity.”
Suddenly, it felt like a cold hand wrapped tightly around Draco’s throat.
Even so, he couldn’t ignore the slowly growing fear that had started to invade his body, cell by cell. If Harry could, he would’ve loved to take hold of the naïve belief that everything was fine, but he knew better by now. Nothing was, and nothing would be, as it used to be.
Zabini put his hand firmly on Malfoy’s shoulder. “I think you should talk to him. He’s the Chosen One, after all,” Zabini said with a knowing and a little teasing glint in his eyes.
“This doesn’t look too bad,” Draco said wearily as he let his gaze run all round the Room.
“No,” Harry said quickly. “I mean, at some point, obviously, but not now.”
Draco chuckled. “Well, I’ve actually done that too, but I think I still prefer the apple shampoos from the Manor.”
Suddenly, Draco felt the tears pricking his eyes. Fuck. The last thing he wanted was to start weeping for losing his parents; he had already done that a lot during the days when he had wandered lost and aimlessly along the streets in the Muggle London. Draco felt just so angry with himself. Why did he have to cry for people who had just ditched him on the street using the most humiliating manner one could think of?
Potter pretended not to have heard Draco mutter and first helped him to sit down in the bow before pushing the boat into the water and jumping aboard as well.
They entered an empty and almost completely dark classroom, where the only source of light was the half-moon that shone dimly through the windows. When they were completely inside the room, and the door was closed behind them, Harry took off his Cloak. He looked utterly wrecked; he had dark circles under his eyes, he was shaking a bit, and he was so pale and ill-looking Draco was sure he hadn’t been eating or sleeping properly in days.
Winter's calmness and stillness wrapped Draco tight, and he felt as if he could breathe again after his little episode in the Great Hall. Draco walked slowly around Hogwarts grounds as the glistening snow crunched under his feet and the moon created long, black shadows on the clean white snow. Draco felt his body shivering slightly when he arrived at the shore of the Black Lake, and he was sure there were at least a couple of degrees below the zero.
“I wasn’t the one who started the whole alcove thing,” Harry said, flicking Draco’s forehead with his finger.
“Hey!” Harry said, pinching Draco’s thigh.
“You should talk to him. You don’t have to forgive him if you don’t want to but talking with him would probably help you to understand more what he was going through and why he ended up choosing his family,” Hermione explained. “The more you know about his thoughts and feelings from the time you were together, the easier it’ll be for you to let go of all the anger and bitterness you’re carrying now.”
Draco let out a dry laugh. “But I kind of am alone. I don’t have any friends left there.”
“Malfoy?” Harry said cautiously, but this time no one answered him anymore. “
Harry couldn’t live with not knowing what Draco was hiding from him. At first, he tried but in the end, it took him only a day or two before he started following Draco’s dot regularly on the Marauder’s Map.
Harry thought he could never get tired of kissing Draco. Feeling Draco’s warm mouth against his and Draco’s hands wandering all over his body made all Harry’s problems seem small and irrelevant, as if they didn’t even exist. All he wanted was to forget himself in Draco’s soft touches and the feeling of Draco’s body against his.
As Harry walked from the Gryffindor table to the Slytherin one, he could feel several eyes on him, staring at his back, but he didn’t let it disturb him.
--*--*--*--*--
“Of course you can,” Blaise said, waving his hand dismissively. “But you should’ve seen these two right after they had been caught by Snape,” he continued, turning his face to Ginny.
“Harry,” Draco said with a hoarse voice and bolted up from the floor so fast his still sleepy limbs started to ache. “I’m so sorry about the quarrel we had and how I treated you after that, could we just –” he said, words streaming out of his mouth until he noticed the appearance of the other boy.
“Harry, please, don’t,” Draco said, almost panicking now and trying to jerk his arm away.
“You know Ginny, she’s quite lively. She has probably as many friends in other Houses as in Gryffindor,” Harry said, shrugging.
Harry eyed Zabini, feeling still suspicious. “I can’t promise to do that,” he said hesitantly after a moment. “But I promise to think about it.”
After a few minutes, Potter reappeared in Draco's sight, jogging towards him. “I found it, let’s go,” Potter said, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco again and lifting him up.
“Er,” Harry said, running his hand through his hair.
Hermione beamed. “Oh, Harry, I’m so glad you’ve got excited about the, er, teaching thing,” she said, lowering her voice and watching worriedly at the staff table. Umbridge was unsurprisingly present, glowering at the students as she sipped her tea.
“Yes, but –”
“No, not until Draco told me last summer,” Andromeda said, looking a bit sad. “I wish they had told me, but I reckon Narcissa wouldn’t have said yes if there had been more people involved.”
They took the path that led around the lake, and the further away they walked the fewer students there were. People hadn’t apparently bothered to walk to the other side of the lake as there was more than plenty of place on the castle’s side.
Granger entered the room, and looked around, hesitating. “Is it okay if I –” she asked, pointing loosely at the chair by Draco’s desk.
“How many nicknames do you have for him exactly?” Harry asked, amused.
“Did you see this coming? You two have spent quite a lot of time together lately,” Ron asked suspiciously.
Sirius came in and walked to sit down on the foot of Harry’s bed. He regarded Harry with a warm and worried glance, a glance Harry could imagine his father would’ve had in a similar situation. It made Harry feel a bit better instantly. Sirius was, however, a person who was the most reminiscent of a family to Harry, and Harry had started to see them two as a unit. Sirius had known Harry’s parents and cared for them deeply, as much as Harry’s parents had cared for him. There were always the Weasleys, who Harry truly held dear, but Harry couldn’t still help feeling like an outsider. He wasn’t one of them, not really.
“Er, are you expecting me to say some sort of opinion about that?” Harry asked, watching the bottle with a raised eyebrow.
“Well, you could’ve run straight to the Transfigurations, we must go now anyway if we don’t want to be late,” Hermione said, standing up and grabbing her bag.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean –” he said, still sounding somewhat uptight but maybe a bit more controlled. He had surely taken some sort of a mindfulness course before he had abducted Draco to live under his roof, there was no way he’d be able to go through this otherwise. “Was there something else you’d like to have?”
“I am happier, I think. At least happier than a few days ago.”
All that had happened also affected Harry and Draco’s relationship. Harry wasn’t angry with Draco for having been one of those who had caught DA, but now he had to pretend to everybody else as if he was because there was no way to excuse tolerating Draco’s company anymore. That meant they had to go back to seeing only in secret, behind the closed doors and far from the suspicious eyes. And it made Harry so frustrated. He had gotten to taste how it could be if he and Draco were openly together and letting go of that and going practically backwards felt more painful than Harry could’ve ever anticipated. He tried not to be bitter, but he couldn’t avoid feeling a stab of envy whenever he saw Ginny and Blaise eating together, studying together or walking together hand in hand as if nothing had happened.
“Draco, take a slice of cake,” Lucius said.
“Me too,” Harry said quietly, not wanting Dudley to hear his love confessions.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My sentence is carried out starting officially in August. Besides, they can’t forbid anyone to visit their family member, especially in a case like yours,” Narcissa said. “How are you feeling, darling?”
