“This better be the best fucking excuse I’ve ever heard in my life” Draco laughed at this, whenever Aaron was really angry, he would curse like a trucker, something he otherwise never did.
Harry’s cloak dropped to the floor as his breath hitched in his throat. There were few times that he had been noticed even with the invisibility cloak on, none since Dumbledore. Casper eyes were bulging out of his head, his skin pale as ice. There had to be a spy within the Ministry that was close to them, Harry was afraid to face the idea that she had sensed him there, without any other intel. Harry felt weighed down, his shoulders tense and aching, the Renovation was a more impending issue than they had anticipated. Casper finally let in a deep breath, crouching down on the floor and hugging his knees into his chest, needing the physical compression to calm himself down. The anxiety of this job never got easier, it plagued Harry and several of his auror friends wherever they went. He had gotten so used to his chest feeling dense and stiff that whenever he did get moments of relief, they were whimsical. Harry bent down towards Casper, placing a hand on his back and rubbing it in circular motions in an attempt to be comforting.
Harry had left to go to work again the day before, despite it being a weekend. After their moment in the kitchen, they ate dinner in almost complete silence, and haven’t spoken much since. Draco had ran over the events of the past weekend relentlessly, trying to comb through the meticulous details of what he now learned to be his eventual demise. Maybe that was being slightly pessimistic and it was, but overshadowed by his lack of support system now that he had taken it further than he initially wanted to with Harry, he can’t help but be filled with regret.
“You think you can fuck me and then ignore me for months on end and then expect me to be friends with you? I knew you were entitled but I guess I hadn’t realized to what extent until now. You really are a fucking prick.” he spat, his eyes were beginning to well slightly. He needed to leave soon, he couldn’t let Harry see him cry over him, it would only inflate his already huge ego.
Draco was mad. He was getting really mad. How did he let himself get here, and how could he sit around and cry about some bugger that doesn’t think twice about him? He was Draco fucking Malfoy and quite frankly, had a line up of men eager to be in his bed wherever he went. His drunken mind had decided then that the true solution to this issue was to go out to a pub and screw the first bloke he sees. Draco began stumbling up the stairs, he washed his face and put on his best muggle clothes, determined to prove to Noah that he didn’t give a single fuck about what him or his puny girlfriend were up to. He chugged the rest of his drink and apparated to the pub.
That part was true, if there was one thing that he and Harry had in common was their never ending list of traumas that they had experienced as adolescents. It had created a strange bond between them, one that couldn’t be understood by nearly anyone else in their lives.
Draco had been trying to grasp his feelings for Harry at the time of his arrival and the idea of Aaron having a romantic interest in him was lightyears away. His mind was bewildered with questions that he didn’t have the space to ask. So, in short, after a few painfully long seconds, Draco shook his head in indecision. Almost to say, I haven’t even thought of it.
Harry, of course, tried to stop him, chasing him around the home and begging him to stay. As far as Draco saw it, they were over the second that Harry made the decision to kiss someone else.
He was watching Draco take inhales of his cigarette, admiring his ability to look so annoyingly attractive even in the middle of the night, hoping he wouldn’t look down to see Harry on the curb.
“I don’t think you know what you’re doing, Malfoy.” Harry said slowly, tapping Draco’s face with his palm lightly before turning his body away from him. Picking up the glass that he left on the floor.
However, there was a part of it that was still bothering Harry. Draco had attempted to slide into a conversation of what they were, and Harry had found himself unable to answer in any tangible way nearly every time. Either brushing off the topic to a later date, claiming they ‘still had time to figure it out’ or simply freezing in the moment, which left Draco sitting in silence for several minutes as Harry used filler words to glide around the conversation.
“Merlin, Potter. You had me scared shitless, hell are you doing pestering at my door at this hour?” He then caught a whiff of his scent, “And bloody plastered at that?”
“That being said, I am a mess and would love to use your shower and take a nap on your couch if you will let me.” Draco said, just the sound of the two things beginning to relax him a little. Aaron agreed swiftly and even insisted that he sleep on the bed, ensuring him that it wouldn’t be an issue. Draco complied and walked over to the washroom to start the shower. He got undressed, looking in the mirror and turning around to see some of the scars on his back. They were smaller, nothing compared to what others experienced during the war, but a constant reminder nevertheless. He reached his fingers over them slowly, feeling the rivets in and valleys in his skin. He stepped into the shower, letting the warm water hit his back and relieve his aching muscles. Draco had to actively keep himself from falling asleep under the stream, deciding that it would be rather awkward for Aaron to have to wake his naked body from in the shower. He cleaned his body and washed his hair as quickly as he could, longing for the bliss of finally hitting a pillow to sleep. As he stepped out, realization dawned on as he noticed the lack of towel hanging on the wall, calling out to Aaron to bring him one. Aaron yelled back an agreement, ranting about how apologetic he was as he opened the door a crack and slid the towel in, opening it a little too wide and accidentally getting a glimpse of Draco’s wet and very naked body.
As I’m writing this, it is pouring rain and gorgeous outside. The soft pitter of the droplets encasing my room. I hope you’ll forgive me for the week or so wait in between updates.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry asked as Draco got closer, attempting to place a hand on his shoulder. Draco shrugged it away, pushing Harry to the side as he continued walking. He wasn’t sure why he was mad at Harry but he felt the need to push this anger onto somebody, anybody.
The rush of bodies welcomed Draco back into the dance floor as he left Harry and Aaron behind, avoiding any conversation with Potter. He grabbed onto the shoulders of the first attractive man he saw and began to dance with him. His arms wrapping around the neck of the taller man as he swayed his hips side to side. Draco turned around, grinding his ass into the other man, forming circles and feeling large hands grip onto his hips. He opened his mouth in false ecstasy, his eyes slightly aflutter to see Harry staring with his mouth slightly agape. Draco wasn’t sure what he was doing, but whoever he was dancing with knew how to move against Draco and he wasn’t complaining. He turned back around, his eyes breaking the contact with Harry’s and kissed the man standing in front of him. His tongue sliding against his lower lip for entry, each forcing hungrily into the other. Their bodies pressing together as Draco felt hands sliding down his back and side. The man broke from the kiss, his mouth hovering over Draco’s ear.
“Look, we have to keep you under Ministry supervision, we can’t explain why right now so you’ll just have to trust us.”
“Well, the morning after me and you… you know - I invited him over. Just to talk and hang out - nothing more. He ended up kissing me.”
Draco simply nodded in half-belief, knowing that his own gift is far more than what they agreed on as well.
“We’ve recently had to house a large number of people because of a recent raid that left a lot of victims in its trail. Unfortunately this means, we couldn’t house you with the Ministry. Harry being the only one that lives alone, and I’m quite certain he has a spare bedroom, is the one that we’ve asked to take you in for a month or two.” Marvin explained.
Drinking away his problems had always seemed like a good idea until Draco was faced with a pounding headache and felt his entire body slimy with alcohol. He woke up to an empty bed. At least he had the good sense to kick out his latest endeavour last night so he didn’t have to face the awkwardness that would arise when the sun was out and they were both sober. Sitting up on his bed, he reached for his bedside table where he picked up a potion that would help with this disgusting feeling in his body. Although Hogwarts was never somewhere he really wanted to be, or go back to, he was grateful it sparked his interest in potions, as they have come to save him time and time again. He gulped down the contents of the small vile and closed his eyes as he felt relief, the pressure from his head easing and his stomach unturning from the knots he felt not minutes earlier. He looked over at the watch on his bedside table and saw it read 8:24, not ideal when you work at 9 but Draco had never been one to look wretched no matter how long he took to get ready. He pushed himself off the bed with a groan and forced himself to the bathroom, hoping into the shower once realizing the state of his hair.
“Good morning to you too, you should really get in the habit of locking that thing” Aaron joked, placing his keys down on the table.
Harry’s mouth lingered over the nape of his neck, causing Draco to lean his head back subconsciously, giving him more access. Harry placed a soft kiss over the pale skin, the connection of skin setting his body ablaze, his nerves all alert.
A tear streamed down Draco’s face, his chest aching with a mixture of smoke and heartache. He had decided on going out himself to buy alcohol, understanding that without it not only will he not be able to sleep, he wouldn’t be able to quiet down his mind either.
“You’re twisting my words Potter. All I said was that I wanted so desperately for you to like me that when you blatantly rejected my ass, I was a little hurt to say the least. And so to suppress the years of slight obsession with the Boy Who Lived, I tormented you instead. Made perfect sense to me.” Draco explained, taking an enormous bite out of his waffles as he watched Harry try to wrap his head around the concept.
Harry stares at that wardrobe and has the strangest sensation. He feels like he's aged a lifetime since that moment four years ago, how different everything had been; how can he be that same boy whose misdirected anger almost manifested into something too terrible to comprehend? He'd wanted to kill Sirius in petty revenge when he thought he had been the one to betray his parents simply because he'd been told - by the papers, by friends, by everyone - that he was bad. He's learnt his lesson that nothing ever really is what it seems.
"Ron! Fears are deeply personal. Maybe Draco doesn't want the information broadcast. It's supposed to be between him and Harry."
"I know," Draco says, the fury on his face sliding off to leave a blank mask in its stead and Harry starts to think that he's miscalculated Malfoy, that he's messed everything up - but then, Draco plucks his wand from Harry's fingers. The Dark Mark vanishes with a single swift tug and the soft swish of fabric. "That was always my problem."
The idea of that stops Harry in his tracks. Where will that leave them? Will Draco go back to pretending Harry doesn’t exist? Turn back into another one of Hogwarts’ ghosts, a quiet presence in the back of the classroom? At the end of the Slytherin table in the Great Hall?
They play dirty and it's the most fun Harry has had in a long while. They play until the pearly clouds turn slate. Harry has no idea how long they've been outside for, he measures their time in moments; Draco's immaculate nails scraping against the back of his hand in pursuit of the apple, a desperate fumble of tearing clothes and kicked shins and bruised limbs, the whizz of the fruit streaking past his ear and into the goal, his numb fingers mistakenly yanking Draco's streaming scarf from his throat but it hardly even slows him down.
Okay, so there's this. If I'm being honest with you, I have no idea how long this is going to be (at the moment, I have an idea of 8 chapters from start to finish) but it's not likely going to be over 50,000 words. Also, I'm uploading as I write instead of my usual finish-it-all-with-no-pressure-over-2-years-then-upload-it-in-one-go thing so I'm not sure how often updates will be.
Draco throws a glance to the trunk - to the boggart concealed within - and decides he suddenly doesn't want to be in the same room as it anymore. He doesn't bother to pick up his things, he passes right by the table with the sandwiches (and ignores the growl rumbling from Harry's empty stomach) and steps right out into the cool corridor, pulling Harry along by a grip so tight that Harry doubts he could shake himself free even if he wanted to.
"I don't need pity, Potter. I know my mother loves me. It's just hard for her to show it right now."
Ron's parting words had been less tactful. "If he starts driving you mad and you want to duck out of there early, come straight to the Burrow. You don't even have to send word."
making faces! I - I was actually reading a rather fascinating article on international governments within the magical community and the lack of action taken between countries during times of crisis!" Hermione trills, flustered to the point that Harry nearly takes pity on her.
I know! I'm sorry about this taking a little longer to post! I think there are probably going to be two chapters left for this fic (originally meant to be one more after this chapter but this one would have been at least 10,000 words long so I've decided to split it.) I haven't read through this whole so fingers crossed it makes sense!
Harry raises an eyebrow and sticks his hands deep inside the pockets of his jacket. "We both know that it wasn't you doing any of that."
In terms of press coverage, Malfoy is beaten only by Harry himself. Where Harry had been held up as the paradigm of goodliness and virtue, Malfoy would be cast as his antithesis. They referred to him as
"Are you alright there, Potter?" Professor Sprout calls, her voice booming. She always has a way of shouting every sentence even if you're standing right next to her. Her boots, lined thick with dried mud and leaves, are kicked up onto an empty chair. Transfixed, Harry watches as she clacks her shoes together to expel some more dirt onto the floor. "School year coming along nicely? Hope you're cracking on with that essay I set you on Monday."
He cups his hands around his mouth and shouts up to Draco, his voice echoing around the deserted pitch. "So what are we playing with?"
"You must be joking?" Draco's gaze shifts minutely towards the Gryffindor table, face closing off as he gestures to something behind Harry. "Speaking of. I think your friends are in need of you, Potter." he says quietly, abandoning his seat the moment Harry swivels around. Hermione is clinging onto Ron's arm, holding him back, their mouths moving furiously like they're in the midst of a mumbled argument. "I'll see you around."
With the three of them gone, it's only going to be Harry and Ron in their dormitory this year. Harry watches Malfoy smooth out the front of his robes at the Slytherin table across from them and wonders what his prospects of sharing dormitories will be like - if anyone will even be
Draco takes a step back. Then another, and another until his back hits the opposite wall across from Harry. He thrusts his hands into his pockets, crossing one long leg in front of the other, the tone of his voice cooler than the corridor itself. With his pale skin and white hair, he might as well be forged from ice and snow, distant and unreachable as an iceberg.
"You - you probably shouldn't have seen that." Draco says, sounding stricken. He struggles to regain his composure, rounding on Harry in a fluster. "Don't say a word, Potter, or I swear on Merlin that I'll Obliviate you."
For the most part, Ron is unchanged. His friendship with Harry has only grown stronger, any petty jealousy from their younger years banished once and for all. Ron anchors Harry into himself, almost makes him feel like nothing has happened when they laugh together but it never lasts long.
sugarcoat anything. Harry suspects it's something he's inherited from Molly and he likes that best of all about Ron, that there's no pretence and you know what you're going to get the moment he opens his mouth.
Hermione manoeuvres around a large rock, speaking calmly. "Just because we can do magic, it doesn't mean we need it in every aspect of our lives. We should take note from our muggle counterparts - just think of all the advancements they've made while we're effectively still  stuck in the middle ages!"
Harry sits up onto his knees, hands braced on the soft mattress beneath his hands, shuffling closer. Draco startles at the movement, violently jolting away like a pair of invisible hands are gripping him by the shoulders and yanking him back but he recovers well, expression shifting back into passive.
"Yes, mine." Harry says with a snap, knowing that he can never tell Ron that he'd handed his own wand over to Draco Malfoy. "This is how you get your wand back. I don't know about you but I'd like to report back to McGonagall with
Ron frees himself from the confines of the scarves, every inch of his freckled face drawn tight by unhappiness when he looks over Hermione. Harry finds himself troubled as he watches because although Ron and Hermione still bicker every other day, it's never about anything serious and it's always said with a gentling smile to extinguish any heat that might have lingered otherwise.
It was nicer still seeing Draco shed his armour, as tough as it was to the shell of a Blast Ended Skrewt, until he could laugh freely - at least, laugh
"Gargoyles serve as a water spout but grotesques are just stone carvings. It's said gargoyles can only communicate if wind or rain passes through their mouths." Draco explains in a drawl, glancing up at a particularly hideous face as if expecting one to start talking at any moment. "What did they teach you at muggle school?"
"Master Draco, I is sorry to be disturbing you but you is needed in the parlour. Mistress is wanting you, sir."
"They told me that for the whole of that year, they felt like they were missing something - that it was like they forgot to pack something in the move but couldn't figure out what it was." Hermione pulls herself up and pins Ron down with her defiance; she looks formidable against the swirling storm behind her. "I did what I had to to keep my family safe but erasing all memory of me from their minds was the most painful thing I've ever had to do. I may not have spoken about it but I thought of them every single day when we were looking for horcruxes, knowing that they couldn't think of me back. Your family knew that you were alive, you had someone to run to when it became too much. Allow me the same right now, Ron."
"You know me." Harry shrugs, grinning, revelling in the ease of their banter. "I like a quiet life."
Behind him, Draco Malfoy is methodically taking the steps one by one, occasionally glancing over his shoulder in fear of them being found out - ludicrous really, he thinks, acting like a scared first year after everything he's been through. He can't help but jump at the shadows that seem determined to set him on edge, movements that turn out to be no cause of alarm: a shadow of an owl gliding by outside of the window, the passing of a stray cloud against the moon.
No one in the Muggle world would guess that there is anything remarkable about this boy or what he had done. They'd sensed something dangerous mingling with the early morning fog and the dark, churning skies. They'd uneasily laughed off the sweat that dampened their hairline or the prickling feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. They'd read about the disappearances of neighbours and signed it off as just another tragedy. Yet they could never put a name to it; all they had known was that there was
"Probably for the best." Harry says, grinning at the thought of Draco participating in a P.E. lesson. "Can't imagine you out on the field for a bit of a kickabout."
"Look, it's not just about Quidditch. I - I feel like I'm being stretched all the time," Harry begins, settling himself on the edge of a desk. He focuses on the faded fabric of his trainers, the tears in the rubber from one too many steps made in them, appreciating the ease in which the words seem to just ribbon out of him like fogged breath on a cold day. He's always been one to keep things bottled up until recently, he's surprised to hear admissions flow like this for Draco. "On one side, there's this - there's this
He slips out of bed and noiselessly gathers a few items; his glasses on the bedside table, a jumper, his wand, the Marauder's Map, then sneaks downstairs to the common room.
"I suppose I must." Draco sighs, shrugging off his cloak and beginning to neatly fold it. He catches Harry watching and frowns. "You may not give an owl's hoot about your state of dress but I'm not about to give in to wrinkled clothing for your sake, Potter."
If Draco were capable of regaining even a tenth of the person he used to be, he'd aggressively mime being sick over the side at Potter's disgusting integrity. How can any one person face such honest concern and that woebegone expression Potter always seems to wear around Draco and come out of it whole?
"Let us hope that McGonagall is sentimental then." Draco says sarcastically, rolling his eyes in despair.
Draco doesn't seem to be at ease now, not here in his own home. This time, something gives him pause; he casts about the room, voice dropping to a whisper as if afraid of what his confession may unleash or what spirits of the past may be around to overhear it.
something you want. From me, I mean." He looks up at Harry then, pupils blown wide and dark so that only a thin band of grey remains around its perimeter.
"I dunno. It just...bothered me to see him like that." Harry admits, visibly irked, one hand crumpling his hair into catastrophe. That's the part that keeps giving him trouble; why does it bother him? His history with Malfoy is calamitous, they've never seen eye to eye yet he can't ignore the nagging worry that they could be two sides of the same coin.
"Well? I presume we're here for more than idle chatter with one another. What are you waiting for? What's the password?"
"You are aware, as is Mr. Malfoy, that the wand in question is to be kept within my office until Mr. Malfoy requires it for his studies, are you not?" McGonagall asks frankly, settling back into her seat.
it though; stepping into the dungeons had felt like a scream ripping from his body. Being there had given him a release, a reason to finally turn his back on that chapter when all hope had seemed lost.
together in the Great Hall. Weasley would grip his knife and fork so hard Draco had half expected them to snap from the pressure while Granger was obviously distributing kicks under the table in Weasley's direction. How fun those early days had been, indeed...
"What do you think you're doing, Potter?!" Draco distant cry comes from somewhere behind Harry but he ignores that, trying to make sense of everything. "Get out of the way, you idiot. This is
"Well? I presume you both have homework to be getting on with or do you have any other proposals? Off you trot." McGonagall waves them away, returning to her letter writing. It's only when they're shuffling back to the stone gargoyle that she calls out to them again. "Oh, and Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy?"
As he walks with Hermione down the length of the aisle to reach the empty space on the bench opposite Ron, Harry notices a familiar blonde head determinedly frowning down at his plate. Malfoy. One of the only faces not fighting for acknowledgement from him. He seems intent on remaining ignored, the significant space around him at the Slytherin table suggesting his isolation is preferred both by himself and his peers.
So this is the difference Harry had tried to place; the sheer lack of ego which Malfoy normally carries with him like a shining talisman. Instead, he's trying to achieve the impossible. He's trying to go unnoticed for the first time in his life. Of course, Harry has always made it a point to be aware of anything Malfoy is doing. He's fine-tuned to his actions on a level that would scare him if he really sat and thought about it.
and yet here he was, howling like Draco was even worthy of seeing him this way after everything he'd put him through over the years.
. One hand reaches out to point his wand squarely at Lucius, the other is planting itself on Malfoy's shoulder and shoving as hard as it can to get him out of the way. Draco is more solid than he looks; he stays firm in his place, a string of his furious complaints already lost to a preoccupied Harry.
"Yeah - I mean, yes. With it being N.E.W.T year and everything, I thought it would be - uh - beneficial for him to get to grips with it."
I was doing them and I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway. It - it wouldn't be fair to anyone for me to turn a blind eye to that. It would make me just as guilty as I was then."
More astonishing is the stack of records sequestered behind it, the peeling labels far too faded and weathered for Harry to make out any signifying words. Unable to resist, Harry carefully picks out one of the vinyl discs and slots it onto the gramophone, gently lowering the needle onto the spinning record with the tip of his forefinger.
The stories that they had gotten weren't from the people who knew him best. All they had to go on were distant memories about a scrawny twelve year old boy who had kindly passed on a set of weighing scales once in Potions, or outdated hearsay from when he'd emerged from the Triwizard Tournament clutching Cedric's dead body. Things that had once condemned him to the public were now used to praise him. Every detail was inflated. The Prophet had ran a week long story because Harry had been spotted talking to Cho in Diagon Alley, one that dragged his break up with Ginny into the mix and speculated on his so-called newly rekindled romance with Cho.
"Not really," Harry says awkwardly, scuffling the toe of his shoe against the floor. "I like to cast it when I just want to, you know, think. Feel at peace. I owe Remus - I'd owe him a lot if he - if - just
The fumes from the cauldrons had been starting to get to him anyway; they had drawn out a steady prickling at his temples, the pain spreading across his forehead until it felt like his brain was ready to explode from his skull. He'd clapped a hand over his scar out of instinct and fear, and only when he saw the look of sheer panic on Ron and Hermione's faces at this motion did he realise that the headache was not caused by lightning bolt scar at all.
If there's one thing that Ron is brilliant at - besides chess and loyalty, of course - it's his ability to absolutely

hoping to have this up before Christmas but the second wind I was waiting for never came even though I managed to squeeze out not one but TWO unrelated oneshots in between updates.
The boggart-Harry is meant to be dead, that much is certain. Those dirt stained clothes tug at the edge of Harry’s memory, as does the bruises on its face, the cut on its cheek. It only clicks into place when he notices that there’s a crack in the lens of the boggart’s glasses - only then does he realise that he’s staring down at a perfect replica of how he appeared to the gathered crowd when Hagrid had carried his motionless body out of the forest at Voldemort’s behest last year.
"We have one house-elf in our employ. It seemed imprudent to insist he clean the entire manor for the sake of my mother, who only keeps to her room and the parlour. I think it can stand to grow a little dusty."
Malfoy's wand flies out and into his hand. A little embarrassed, he wordlessly offers it in a silent apology. Instead of taking it, Draco grabs onto Harry's forearm and for one wild second, Harry almost mistakes it for an embrace.
Draco becomes defensive, bright spots of red colouring his cheeks. "She knows that! It's hard for her to break free though. Believe it or not, there were times in my parents marriage that had a semblance of love. She struggles to reconcile the man he used to be with the man he is now - though my father has always maintained his views on muggles and a pure bloodline. A lesser evil, perhaps, if you can call it that."
Draco flounders, blushing brilliantly, and draws his cloak tightly around his body to stave off the cold. "With reason. Don't you understand that I'm trying to spare you. You shouldn't be seen with me, I'm - I'm no good."
The trial had split the wizarding world; the minority in support of him often insisted that he was too young, a wizard barely of age, to be convicted. Yes, he had been a Death Eater but he had joined under duress - how many would be able to withstand personal threats from the Dark Lord and
This is the most formal proposition that Harry has ever encountered but it's so utterly Draco that he's completely charmed by it. His mouth is dry and he has to swallow hard before he can speak.
During his free period at the end of one tediously long Wednesday, Harry risks Hermione's disapproval and decides to head down to surprise Hagrid instead of catching up on homework, only appeasing her by promising over lunch to dedicate the forthcoming weekend to studying.
Draco comes to full attention, his voice sharp enough to cut air. A glance over in his direction informs Harry that he's stopped finding the ceiling so interesting and has turned all his efforts onto Harry instead.
It hadn’t been easy to return, to bring himself back to the dungeons and relive that dark time, to remember Dobby’s bravery and ultimate sacrifice in rescuing them. He had
"You didn't see the look on his face. He reminded me of - " Harry awkwardly breaks off the sentence, unable to say it. Unable to say,
Thrown by the question, Harry nods. "Uh, yeah. You’ve mentioned that to me before but what's that got to - "
"Nothing too dramatic, Malfoy." Harry warns, wary eyes watching Draco test the unfamiliar weight of the wand. "It doesn't have to be anything fancy, a simple Disarming spell will do it."
Her eyes cut between them again before she reaches down to an unseen drawer in her desk and pulls it open, drawing out the hawthorn wand and laying it on the table in front of Harry.
"Of course he's late." Harry mutters into the empty room, consulting his watch for the fifth time since they'd been due to meet. The hands on the watch seem to move with all the speed of an Impediment jinx but slowly they collect up the seconds until whole minutes pass by.
The rest of the tour of the Manor is brusque, dispassionate even. Draco guides Harry through the vast empty rooms, stripped bare of any furniture they may have formerly housed, sending goosebumps along Harry's spine at how much the place seems all but abandoned. Draco shows him a witch nook, similar to the muggle priest holes of their time, concealed behind a decorative fireplace and used by the family during those uneasy times when witch burning was still prevalent and slip ups could cost lives.
Harry says it nonchalantly enough but Draco swears he catches a faint blush running across the tops of Harry's cheekbones.
Harry waits for Draco's footsteps to fade down the corridor, then turns his attention to Ploddy, waiting expectantly by the door.
“Riddikulus.” Harry says firmly before the screaming can take hold, the whip crack sound of the spell accompanying an invisible force shoving the dementor back, its hood yanked down so tightly over its unseen face that the scabby hands reach up as if to free itself.
The office is much the same as it had been when Dumbledore resided here, the only exception a particularly comfortable looking tartan-clad armchair now situated behind the desk, a mildly surprised Professor McGonagall ensconced within it.
The stag starts to falter, the definition around the edges bleeding away. Ah, Draco thinks, there was a wound that was still sore.
Harry pulls out a crumpled photograph from his trouser pocket. It’s slightly bent at the edges and when Harry places it on the nearest desk, Draco has to twist to look down at it. Two people are waving up at him; one, a woman with flowing red hair and familiar startling green eyes, and the other, a man with light brown skin and the same untidy scruff of hair as Harry's. So young, only a few years older than Harry is now.
"Oh please, Potter. I don't need to be treated to another one of your little speeches about how desperately sad I am. Come on, this way."
as vibrant in her as it has always been. The tightness around her eyes softens when Harry appeals to her, his voice quieter than a whisper. "Are you mad at me?"
"Oh, Ron." Hermione tuts, pursing her lips in disapproval. "Don't you remember how awful he looked in sixth year? Or when we saw him in - in Malfoy Manor? He was under a lot of stress. If McGonagall trusts him, then so do I."
They are two young boys with a whole war held precariously between them within the single wand. Harry had felt - and still feels - the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders but Draco had been pinned into an impossible situation by Voldemort, something he will always face ramifications over. The both of them had been chosen ones in their own way, neither asking for such a responsibility and somehow, miraculously, they had come out of the other side bruised and beaten but intact. If Draco can only just reach out, Harry will know that he's not the only person committed to this unplanned alliance.
"There's not much to see," Draco says, his voice sounding as if he's speaking through a distorted microphone. "The Ministry confiscated most of our possessions after my father's arrest. They seemed to think it reasonable to test everything on the chance they may find dark artefacts - oh, I've no doubt they found something to justify their search but I can't begin to imagine what they think we'd have done to turn a set of antique silver spoons lethal." he adds upon seeing Harry's sceptical expression.
Harry walked out of the office, greeting Ron and Hermione with a tight hug, eager to catch up on their lives. They went to this quaint muggle restaurant with dim lighting and warm ambiance. Ron and Hermione talked about their married life and work at the Ministry. Hermione was campaigning to become the next Minister of Magic, which has taken up almost all of the free time she had, which wasn’t much to begin with. Ron had become an auror like Harry, although he was working in a separate department. Harry told the two about his rooming up with Draco, and how it was practically forced on him by Marvin.
He felt himself dancing, his hips grinding on another body, a hand wrapped around his waist, his head thrown back against a shoulder.
“Friend, huh? Is that what you call everyone who confesses their love to you? I suppose Harry is just a friend too huh? Just a lad?” Aaron spat, his face contorting into one of anger.
Harry turned his head up to look at the sky, his eyes catching on a blonde man standing on the balcony. Squinting his eyes, he was able to recognize the shape of Draco, his heart catching in his throat as he did. He was only a few stories up, still living in what he imagined to be the penthouse suite of the shorter building.
“Merlin, Potter, you’re gonna give me a bloody heart attack!” Draco exclaimed, clutching his heart in his hand.
After work Harry chose to go out with Casper to distract himself from the lack of Draco’s presence in his home. They had gone out to a muggle pub, something they do often as Harry can’t go more than a few blocks in the wizarding world before being stopped by one bloke or another, asking for an autograph or the answers to extremely personal questions about Harry’s life and the war.
Their lips collided together again, this time less hesitant and more sure in their action. Draco had missed the taste of Harry, despite it being soiled with scotch, he could barely convince himself to pull away again.
“Hi there, I’m Matt. Care if I buy you a drink?” he asked, his mouth in a cocky smirk. Harry mentally rolled his eyes.
His back arched lightly to bring his head closer to Harry’s, his eyes fluttering shut in expectation of something more.
The weather in London was cloudy and gloomy, not providing him with any relief from his already painful headache. Despite the darker weather, his eyes still burned with the brightness of everyday life. He stopped by a small convenience store to grab a pair of oversized sunglasses to hide behind as he began his trip home.
“I’m gonna need you to change out of that god awful bathrobe today Malfoy” Harry said with a smirk. A blush rose to Draco’s cheeks, he hoped what Harry was saying was only an accidental innuendo.
Draco placed an open palm against Harry’s face, the warmth lighting him up from inside. He brushed his fingers against Harry’s face, pulling him into a kiss, their lips colliding softly. Harry kissed back, his lips soft and brushing against Draco’s. He felt himself being pulled atop of him, his legs now stradling Harry’s waist in between them.
“I hope you don’t take this as me giving in to your whining, but my apartment is just around the corner. Let’s go, darling. I’ll make you some dinner.” Harry offered, leading the way.
It was at this moment that Harry’s phone rang, a default ringer echoing throughout the bathroom. It was Marvin, and although he had taken the week off of work and was hoping not to be bothered in any way, he went against his better judgement and answered the phone, placing it on speaker as he got undressed to enter the shower. This decision might have prevented him from where he was now - and Harry deeply cursed himself for it, wishing he would have ignored the call and continued on with his day. But he didn’t.
Harry stood from his unmarked spot on the curb as he saw Malfoy put out the rest of his cigarette and get ready to go inside. What was just an idea in his head a few minutes ago was now something he needed to act out. All of a sudden he couldn’t live without letting him know how he felt, he would rather die.
“How have you been? Sorry about my failed attempts at hiding last week at the store, force of habit when it comes to exes.” Draco laughed, resting his chin in the base of his palm.
Maybe Aaron would be the wiser choice out of the two men, he was generally more emotionally available, providing comfort and asylum for Draco in his lowest moments, although if he were to go by that measure, Harry did too. Not to mention, Aaron and him have had similar pasts and were able to find an interconnectedness between them that Draco hadn’t experienced before, one of true companionship. Though Draco wasn’t sure if it was a romantic type of companionship in his eyes before this.
They had been on opposing sides of the war and felt a mutual hatred towards each other through most of school, the only link that was holding them together now was Harry.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s, feeling his soft skin on his. He pushed his chin upward, connecting their lips. There was no response.
Harry slammed the door of his and Caspers office as they entered, letting out a frustrated groan as he sat back in his chair.
He had always been jealous of Harry, hated him even. Always surrounded by friends and chosen family who understood him and had similar mindsets. And for him to be constantly questioning why they would want to risk their lives or die for him was even more infuriating, Draco wished he had someone who was willing to do that for him. There was of course that one time in the room of requirement but that didn’t count, did it? It was just Harry doing what he always did - playing the hero and expecting something for it. Well Draco wouldn’t give him the satisfaction. For all he cared Harry could have left him there to die. Draco had struggled with depression for a majority of his life, but he was grown now and out of his parents house so it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. His friends forced him to see a therapist, he didn’t even know wizard therapist’s existed, and that made it a lot better. Most days though, when his mind was too loud and the memories of the war blinded his senses, he could always brew a potion or two or three to make it stop. It wasn’t the most sustainable course of action but got the job done when he didn’t want to be a burden to his friends.
Draco doubles over and rests his head against his arm, gritted teeth stubborn to keep the words inside of him, his worst admission he's been trying to hide from even himself.
to focus and failing miserably as he scans the pages of her book over her shoulder, perks up with sudden interest.
"No, Harry's right." Hermione breathes heavily, eyes shining. She seems to crackle with some unseen force, the light that shines when she talks about S.P.E.W but to full wattage. "We can't stop fighting for what we believe in. We
“I think he is. The other day, he managed to make it stumble. He might not need me to help him soon enough.”
Harry nods without taking his eyes off Draco delicately crumbling chunks of bread into his soup. "Mmm."
Draco allows himself one lonely breath of a derisive laugh. "And this, our grand saviour? Unable to decipher his way into his favourite teacher's office?"
"I don't suppose you had time to admire the architecture the last time you were here." Draco tells him pointedly, letting himself in through the gate. A surprise: Harry had almost anticipated servants waiting for them but there's no one else to be seen. "Anyway, don't be obtuse, Potter. Those are grotesques, not gargoyles."
- but something wasn't right. He was different. Changed. A burden he'd known for seven years had finally been lifted but what had it left him with? Everything he'd not allowed himself to feel since he'd started this fight; his past, his grief, his future.
On the morning of Christmas eve, Harry is lounging on his bed, flicking through a Seeker Weekly magazine without much interest. He's anticipating a quiet day, that Draco is probably up to his elbows in planning now that their days here will be numbered once Christmas is out of the way, when Draco lightly raps his knuckles against the door frame.
"You know, Potter, there's going to come a time very soon when you're going to explain what you just said to me in avid detail." Draco says, unable to tear his gaze away from the silvery mist streaming out behind the stag as it begins to fade. He finds himself thinking this Patronus was destined to wander through a forest of stars.
Yet Draco had called him a friend only weeks ago; his cheeks rosy from flying, the warm slide of his palm against Harry’s, the fringes of his snowy hair falling into his eyes. The glimpses of that Draco have grown evermore frequent and Harry thinks it won’t be so easy for him to slip back into his solitude now.
The thought of that brings what's happening to the forefront, sinking into Harry's every pore; Draco is going to kiss him. Here. In Malfoy Manor. Harry can feel his whole body absorb that, from the thump of his heart to the very loud, very embarrassing whooshes of air huffing through his nostrils, and Harry realises how much he
"If you really want to." Draco tells him slowly, cautiously. "I - " Draco clears his throat, tries again. "I didn't mean to annoy you."
Harry shakes his head, instinctively reaching for his scar. "I've spent a lot of my life feeling helpless. I've never been able to turn away from someone who needed help. How could I? How could I refuse after all the stuff I went through? Everyone turned a blind eye to the Dursley's and the way they treated me, I don't want to be the person who looked away to somebody else."
Ron comes up between Harry and Hermione, slinging each arm around their shoulders. "A word alone with Slughorn? I'd almost feel sorry for him if he weren't the world's biggest prat."
This admission is unusual. Had he simply said to Harry that he can't stand the sight of him, that he puts up with him just so that he can beat his boggart, then Harry might have let it go. This, however - this gives Harry a foothold, a spark of something for him to breathe promise into.
over it. "Yeah, I could tell from the way you were flattening yourself on the ground there. What were you hoping to do, Malfoy? You don't even have your wand."
"After the Dark Lord returned, his erratic nature accelerated. Now, I needed to become a Death Eater and fix the impossible and - and kill
Draco's nose is pink at its pointed tip, his cheeks flushed from the flying, lending a pleasant warmth to the otherwise frozen face. Harry silently admits to himself that Draco's wind-tousled hair suits him; it turns the marble statue of a boy pretending to be a man into more of the seventeen year old that he is. Someone reachable. Some other layer that makes Harry's heart flutter and stomach clench all the more.
"Come on, Potter. Let's not act stupid, shall we? We've been sworn enemies for years. I made your life miserable at every turn, whenever I could. I bullied your friends, I mocked the death of your family, I tried getting your favourite groundskeeper fired, I joined up with your actual mortal enemy and came close to murdering our headteacher on...on
"I don't know what to do anymore," Harry admits. He heaves a sigh, lacing fingers behind his head so he can tip back and stare miserably at the ceiling. "Everything is just a mess."
Things hadn't worked out with Ginny but he wishes they had. He tries out a small smile for her as he takes his seat and is relieved to receive one in return.
"Yet we go on, as is our duty. We are here to safeguard your future. When threatened, we rise up. Again, and again, and
Harry finds his attention slipping from the first year students and Professor Sprout as she begins to call them forth one by one. He looks around instead. He watches Hagrid attempting to sneak to his chair and knocking Madame Hooch from her seat by mistake. He watches McGonagall shift ever so slightly in the headmaster's position, as if she keenly feels the full weight of responsibility on her shoulders. His eyes skim over the faces that are still staring in adoration at him, anxious not the let his gaze linger too long on any of them.
"And that I think everything you do is wonderful. Look, if you think it's a good idea, I say go for it. This lot could benefit from an extra bit of studying."
It had taken surprisingly little time for Draco to give up everything he had to Harry; he can be flinty but he cooperates. He can be private but his best kept secrets whistle through gritted teeth like steam from a kettle. He can be rude but sometimes Harry can't help but wonder if Draco hates him as much as he
Incredible, Harry thinks, how untouched the castle and grounds appear. The Battle of Hogwarts had taken a toll on the school, he'd witnessed it first-hand but you'd never know it now; a third of it had been reduced to piles of rubble, crumbling ruins of a home he loved dearly. He'd walked the grounds himself in those early days after the battle and observed the start of the clean up but he couldn't revel in winning. It felt like he'd lost everything else for the necessity of that victory.
His first visit to the Manor after months of being away had him filled with nostalgia and turmoil, the memories of his childhood bittersweet in his mind. The tall hedges blocking the sun as he walked towards the front entrance, seeing the grand doors that led to a life he left behind. The building always looked so ominous, as if the structure itself was soiled with the secrets and wrong doings of the Malfoy name. His mother, who he hadn’t seen for nearly a year, had aged significantly. The wrinkles in her face and the dark circles under her eyes gave a view into the painful past few months that she had, it hurt Draco to see his kind mother like this, and burned a sense of guilt into his chest.
It was another typical day after work, Draco had stopped by a nearby grocery store to pick up some ingredients for dinner. He had invited Marie and Olive, Harry said he would leave the apartment for the evening to give them some time alone. The fluorescent lighting in the store was illuminating a wide array of cheeses that he was stuck choosing between, growing more wary of the time by the second. He grabbed a handful of random feta’s and gouda cheeses, rushing to get home in time to prepare for their arrival. Rushing home, he apparated to the door of the apartment, scurrying to the kitchen to prepare.
He looked as brilliant as ever, he had a slight scruff, a balance in between having missed a few days shaving while also not too eager to maintain a well kept look. He was wearing a light shirt tucked into a pair of khakis, a belt cinching his waist. His hair had grown out, now a little above his shoulders, his curls unruly in their longer state. Draco caught himself staring.
He was now significantly drunk, having had nothing to eat since dinner and having consumed a little over half of the scotch bottle in only 20 minutes. But it was cold out and he knew that he wasn’t feeling the full extent of his inebriation, still being able to think clearly and not swaying too severely.
Harry was humming in the kitchen as he sliced up ingredients for their cheese board that Hermione insisted they try out, having brought reference photos for exactly how she wanted it laid out. Draco was standing towards the back corner of the dining room, sipping on wine and enjoying the chaotic set of events unraveling before him. It’s not that he was exactly uncomfortable with the three of them all together, it was just that he simply felt he didn’t fit in. They had nearly 2 decades of inside jokes and shared experiences, laughing about references that Draco could never understand.
Draco marched down the hall, displacing his feelings of grief and pain with anger. He spotted Harry a ways down the hall, whose face lit up as he saw Draco, though it quickly faded as he saw the rage boil out of his skin as he continued to storm down the hall.
And with that their lips were back together, colliding softly, more sure of themselves than before. Harry slipped his tongue into Draco’s, tasting the cigarette that he watched him smoke. He wanted nothing more than this, forever.
“Is this?” Harry gasped, his eyes widening. A grin spread across Draco’s face and he nodded quickly.
“A month?! I have to spend an entire MONTH living with that ungrateful little-” Marvin stared into Harry, commanding him not to finish the end of the sentence as a few aurors were still making their way out of the meeting.
“So what made you come to my apartment in the first place?” Draco asked, genuinely curious where the newfound spontaneity stemmed from.
“It was all 11 year old me could muster, and after a while I just had to stick to it. Couldn’t be going around being nice to Harry Potter all of a sudden could I?”
He ran his fingers through Draco’s silver hair, taking a glance out the window as exorbitant amounts of pine trees passed, melting together into a blur of brown and green.
“Don’t. I know how it must have looked from the outside.” He placed a comforting hand onto his shoulder.
He slapped his palm over his face in annoyance at his actions, he simply couldn’t have been any more awkward.
“I can promise you we can stay in bed all day tomorrow, I’ll find plenty of ways to entertain you too.” He replied with a wink, throwing on a pair of red plaid pants for the occasion.
Harry glanced down at Draco’s lips, his arms on either side of his body. They had been in this exact position more times than he could count, neither of them ever taking it further than this.
“So when am I supposed to go to Potters? Pretty sure I can’t get into his apartment without him here.”
They pulled apart, both clearly eager to get out of an alleyway and to somewhere with a bed and heating.
Harry withdrew eventually, making up an excuse about needing to get some rest before tomorrow, saying he had some big work event. He could tell that the man was pissed, probably thinking about what a waste of time this was and how he could’ve spent 8 pounds on a drink for someone who actually would have slept with him.
Draco straightened up, “Oh. Um sure. My bad, I should have left something on the bed for you. Although I can’t say that I hate the sight of this.” He teased, the corner of his lips tugging upwards into a smirk as he gave him a wink, before walking into his bedroom.
“You know what, Harry? I’ve always known you were only out for yourself, I don’t know why I expected you to be any different now.” Draco spat, grabbing his coat off of the rack and slamming the door on his way out of the house. Leaving Harry alone with his heart heavy and chest tight.
Draco stood for a few seconds, contemplating her words before following her. As he sat back down in his seat he looked at Harry, his warm brown hair cascading over his forehead, the light from the candles they had lit hitting his face as he laughed at something Oliver said. Harry looked over at Draco as if he could feel eyes on him, giving him a small smile, lingering for just a moment too long before turning back to his conversation.
It didn’t help that the main reason he had called him over was to frantically gush over his recent night with Harry, and the feelings of rejection he felt the morning after. Now, even thinking about it feels like an insult against Aaron.
“Let’s just say it's part of my charm.” Harry replied. He looked older, not in a bad way necessarily, but Draco could tell that not everything that happened in the last 5 years had been good to him.
Harry looked up a few seconds later, as if the question was something that was barely worth answering.
He unraveled the paper of the gift, underneath revealing a dark wooden box with golden latches at its front. Draco glimpsed up at Harry curiously who simply encouraged him to keep going, he unclipped the latches, lifting up the top of the box to reveal a large handcrafted cooking set. It was filled with a plethora of different cooking supplies, and paired with a cookbook from one of the most famous wizard chefs, which was signed to Draco.
He lit his cigarette, even this simple act reminding him of Harry. How he would light it for him, his hands clasped to block the wind, his face focused as he flicked his thumb over the metal. His face and body so close to his that it was impossible not to breathe in his intoxicating scent. It had become such a habit for him to notice Harry in his everyday routine, while he was cooking dinner, watching movies, pouring himself a glass of scotch, he was inevitable to avoid.
“Oh come on, I only have them when I’m plastered. It doesn’t count” Draco said, reaching over Harry’s body and grabbing another.
Soon he was pressed up against the cold brick of a building, his body pushed by Harry’s, unable to move.
Once Draco was home he dropped off the bags of decorations in the living room and escaped to their room upstairs without a word to Harry.
Apparently he wasn’t the only one who was waiting desperately for Marvin to get there, once he arrived you could feel everyone relax in their seats, happy to have a buffer so they wouldn’t have to directly interact with one another.
The man was nothing like the sophisticated and gathered Malfoy that he was trying to forget about, and although that should have been helping, it simply highlighted all of the flaws in Matt.
“Thanks for inviting me.” Draco slurred, falling back into a chair behind him so he didn’t have to focus on standing.
Draco woke up in his room, alone. His head was throbbing from the night before, he always amazed himself with how drunk he could get without puking. The memories of last night didn’t come back to him until he rolled over on his side and he felt a twinge of pain in his ass. He couldn’t believe that he fucked Harry Potter the night before. The worst part was that he enjoyed it. But the sight of the other empty side of the bed left him feeling that he was the only one.
They didn’t talk much, he made her a warm dinner, choosing to do it himself rather than ask the house elves for the additional personal touch. Her eyes which were once filled with life were now dull and averted. It pained Malfoy to see his mother in this state, especially when, for some reason, he felt he was personally responsible. He should have gone against the Ministry’s requests and gone on his own investigation to try and find them.
“I can see what you mean, you could’ve cut the tension in there with a knife.” Casper said followed by a slight laugh.
“I’d appreciate it if you kept the fact that the Malfoy family is a target to yourself. I don’t need a crazy Draco stomping into my office first thing Monday morning.” Marvin responded, not even bothering to look up from his work.
“This Potter thing has been killing me.” Draco grunted, he had explained his growing feelings for Harry to Aaron a few weeks back. It hadn’t been met with as much surprise as he had expected, but Aaron has been avoidant of the subject since then. He could have sworn he saw Aaron roll his eyes, he decided on giving him the benefit of the doubt.
“Jesus fucking christ you idiot! I thought it was going to be someone coming to tell me you were fucking dead!” Aaron yelled, attempting to slam the door in his face, but Draco catching it with his foot.
“You know what? I don’t even care that you knew before me, I understand. But I asked you, I asked you if you knew specifically and you lied to my face!” Draco said, tears now streaming down his face.
“Let’s just say it wasn’t the best coping mechanism.” He responded. Truthfully he hadn’t drank since Harry had cheated on him, something about the alcohol painfully reminding him of the time spent with him.
This newfound clingy affection that Harry pushed onto Draco the night before had caught him completely off guard. Creating new expectations for what he initially visualized their relationship to be.
Harry took some time to show him around the apartment, pointing out the bathroom and the spare room that Draco will be staying in. The apartment was a two bedroom but only one bathroom which shouldn’t pose as too inconvenient with Harry gone at work all day. After the little tour of the apartment, Draco was left on his own to settle in his room. The walls were painted a light brown, with a queen size bed in the centre, encased in dark red sheets. He slid his phone out of his pocket and saw messages from Aaron, asking if he was okay and if he had gotten to the Ministry housing yet. Draco sent Aaron a quick text letting him know he was fine and that he was living with Potter, promising him a phone call later in the morning to explain everything.
The roughness of the fabric slid up his legs as Draco put on his jeans, the pants a little tight around his thighs, having been borrowed. He fixed his hair in the mirror, scrunching it to make it seem effortless and unkept. Him and Aaron had spent the day together, going to get lunch at a bistro down the street and watching a movie before beginning getting ready for the night. He had already had a few drinks to ensure he was a little tipsy before getting to the club, unwilling to pay for too many overpriced drinks. They had chosen to go to Essence, a gay club in downtown London. Aaron had allowed Draco to choose the place as he had no interest in hooking up with anyone that night, Draco didn’t either but always wanted to have the choice.
As Marie and Oliver got ready to leave, stumbling slightly from the wine, they said their goodbyes to both Harry and Draco, this time bringing Harry into a hug as well, promising to keep in touch. Marie groaned as she put her heels back on, mumbling something about the patriarchy. Draco stood back, watching as Harry and Oliver exchanged phone numbers, Harry looking giddy like a child. Marie caught his eye, giving him a knowing wink before grabbing Oliver and leaving the apartment, blowing kisses left and right.
The presence at his door caught him off guard, he had been so lost in thought that he hadn’t even realized Marie had walked in, standing as regal as ever with a slightly judgemental expression. She always had a way of knowing these things.
“Just go home, Potter” Draco sighed, his face back to his usual scowl as he attempted to shut the door. Harry caught his foot at the bottom in time, not letting this opportunity pass him by.
“Cmon now, don’t be so brittle love, why don’t you talk to me anymore?” he asked, sliding himself closer to the man, desperate to close the distance between them, as if that would make him any more accepting of Harry’s presence.
They arose from their table, placing a few pounds tip on the table before meandering back out onto the streets of London. The cold air had sobered them up significantly, now walking with their elbows interlinked down the sidewalk.
“Oh. Yeah. Sure” Draco responds, still slightly in his head. He should really stop thinking about Harry like this, they had just started dating - or whatever it was that they were doing - and he didn’t want to put this much pressure on it. Certainly not you are my home pressure.
Once back at the Ministry, Draco walked back up to Marvin’s office, hearing shouting from the inside.
“I’ve just been doing a lot of thinking and I just realized that I can’t live like this.” He spoke, a tear falling down his cheek.
“So Potter huh? Did not expect you to be starstruck by him” Aaron joked, pushing himself slightly into Draco.
Despite Hermione adamantly yelling at them early in the morning that this must be done - at least the decorations - before she was back from the store, they were still sprawled out lazily across the cloud soft cushions of their bed. They had their limbs wrapped around each other, Draco’s long and gentle fingers running soft circles around Harry’s spine.
Draco’s eyes flew open. There was no way. No way that Harry fucking Potter was in this pub. His pub. He almost forgot about the guy he was with, who was beginning to get on his knees and was kissing down Draco’s abdomen. Draco pushed him off and buttoned up his pants, curious but anxious to walk further towards the voice he heard.
Autumn in London always sparked melancholy feelings in Draco. It was far easier to stay positive and content in the baking heat of summer, even the worst of days able to be fixed with a walk outside where warmth wrapped his body like a blanket. The colder seasons didn’t bring that sort of comfort.
He crossed his arms, his hoodie swallowing up the shape of his body under a flood of fabric. Harry’s door crept open, the creaking noise revealing a half naked man standing behind it. Draco felt a flush rise up to his cheeks, he had forgotten Harry didn’t have any extra clothes with him, and so he was left standing in the hallway in nothing but a pair of black boxer briefs and a mis-buttoned shirt from the night before.
Once Harry took his respective seat next to Draco, cozying up his knees just under him so he was compacted into a ball, he cast a quick spell and a somewhat large box wrapped in festive paper made its way down the stairs and under the tree. Draco gave him a disapproving look.
Draco just nodded in agreement, taking a seat on the other side of the couch, careful to keep his distance.
“I don’t think I understand Marvin, why can’t I just stay with a friend. I doubt Potter is the only option.”
Their hips pressed together, the tension in his pants already growing tighter from just the slightest of touch. His mouth opened in a moan and was met by Harry’s tongue slipping in and swallowing him.
“Aurora and I are um.. actually engaged, she doesn’t know about us and I ask you not to tell her. I love her, you know, and I really wanna marry her.” There it was, the conversation that Draco had felt coming for a few months now but was hoping it would be something along the lines of I’m leaving her for you, not the other way around.
The night they had slept together was a drunken blur for Harry, but Draco’s presence illuminated his memory, the soft gaze behind his eyes making his stomach churn, not in lust, but in longing. He remembered staring at Draco as he was nearly taken by sleep, his eyes fluttering shut, his bare chest rising and falling with his breath. The moonlight from the window had cascaded onto his face, the cool air entering the room to wash away the thick, hot ambiance. Harry laid there, analyzing Draco’s sharp, cold features until they turned soft and homely, his platinum hair falling over his eyes. What amazed Harry the most was his lack of insomnia that night, Draco’s warmth swallowing him into a deep and restful slumber, much to Harry’s discontent.
“So you’re meaning to tell me that your incessant bullying towards me was your way of showing your liking towards me?” Harry asked, genuinely baffled. They were both 2 mimosas in at this point and slightly tipsy, their slightly awkward demeanor now entirely fallen as they giggled over old stories from Hogwarts.
A stifled groan could be heard from behind Harry’s door, a sound of a face jabbing into the pillow. Draco let out a chuckle, laughing at the probable feelings of realization that flooded back from the night before.
Draco rinsed his face quickly in the restaurant bathroom and patted it dry before getting mentally prepared to head back to his table with Marie, Oliver, and Noah. He loved hanging out with them but in the last few years everyone had been settling down and getting married, god forbid they start talking about having kids soon, and so all of the questions directed at Draco were about his love life, or lack thereof. Luckily, ever since he came out, all of the questions had been about men, so at least he didn’t have to pretend there was this girl from work which they never got to meet, for obvious reasons. Draco began walking out of the bathroom and was faced with the warm grins of his friends.
Draco sat on the couch, catching his breath, glancing over at Harry as he opened the door to reveal Hermione and Ron standing there, suitcases in hand.
The day of New Years Eve had come quicker than any of them expected, all of them scurrying around the house and various stores to get all of the things needed for the night. Hermione had forced Ron to wait in the hour-long line to get to the liquor store on his own, claiming that he drank the majority of it anyway and it was only fair. She was in charge of all of the grocery shopping so her own day was filled to the brim chaotically. Draco and Harry were simply put in charge of all of the cooking, as well as light decorating, including cheesy plastic NYE hats that welcomed the new year.
"It's okay. Just - just don't take the piss out of him, alright? We've all had a rough go of it this past year. I get it - I get that losing Fred - it's not fair, it's never been fair. Everyone we've lost. Don't you think we should give people a second chance if they're trying to change?"
“Is he making any progress with his boggart?” Hermione asks, as if reading Harry’s mind, gently turning the page of the heavy volume balanced on her knees. Ron, with the vacant look of someone
Harry smiles then and Draco's cold, dead heart starts beating in a very admirable way. Perhaps a little too admirably because Draco can feel it in his throat and he thinks he might choke on all of this
“Uh, yeah - yes. Full steam ahead.” Harry babbles, his face hot. Ron’s snicker is loud enough for him to hear, too quiet to reach Hermione and Draco so that he can’t get away with elbowing Ron in the ribs without raising curious stares.
Draco narrows his eyes at Potter's suggestion to turn back and musters enough of his old nerve to stare Potter down, "We're almost to the top."
Harry reaches for one on instinct, knowing from his experience of her being Gryffindor's head of house that to refuse would only annoy her more but Draco, quite unused to such treatment, stares at the tin in astonishment.
Harry reaches out to trace a shaky finger against the lines of a name he's sought out at least a hundred times, a name he's stared at hard as if to will the person into existence before him: Sirius Black. "My point is I don't want to see another person I - I know vilified. There's more to you than that mark on your arm."
"Some Christmas this'll be," Ron says glumly. "With you off carolling with the Malfoy's and Hermione - "
Harry feels an overwhelming surge of fondness for his ever faithful wand. "Yeah, well - how's your wand feel? Back to normal?"
had been bandied about at his trial by stony faced members of the Wizengamot, as if those words bore no weight to them and they hadn't cost Draco a great deal of his self in their ruthless wake. The Chief Warlock had pardoned him after a laborious and record breaking eight hours of discussion, a string of witnesses acquired from Merlin knows where by his mother and a sincere statement of the deepest remorse from Draco.
Draco actually manages a small smile, barely a quirk of his mouth but it causes Harry's heart to hammer out in a disjointed rhythm all the same. He has no memory of Draco ever smiling - not like
Harry smiles in spite of the situation, stepping forward so that the dementor retreats toward the trunk, “Riddikulus!”
"Oh dear," Slughorn sighs, peering across the desk to inspect the slightly smoking floor. "Ah, Harry - can you run along to the staff room and find Mr. Filch? He should have some solution for Wilson's problem."
than he used - at Harry's quips at the hedges trimmed into the twisting shape of snakes or the ostentatious dress robes, all in startling shades of green, that the Malfoy family chose to wear for their portraits.
"Mr. Malfoy, I have not yet excused you. Please retake your seat," McGonagall orders, pushing her tartan biscuit tin towards them. "Do have a biscuit, the both of you."
“Do you...do you want to sit with us?” Harry offers, noting that the other Gryffindors along the table are observing this all with expressions ranging from alarmed to dubious.
"Alright, you've proven your point!" Hermione says, hiding her smile behind a hand. "I hope you know you're included in that
He hates to disappoint the Weasley's, especially because of how generous they've always been towards him. The Burrow has felt more like a home than anywhere else he's lived - aside from Hogwarts, of course - and the Weasley's are some of the people he cares about most. They'd taken him in with open arms when no one else had before, no questions asked.
"Actually, you were." Ginny cuts in brightly, emerging from the girl's dormitory stairway, playfully shoving Ron's elbow off the armrest so she can perch there. "You did it all the time when you were flirting with me. I used to think that maybe you had bad dandruff or something."
with the wand. Consider this a trust exercise; I want to know what times you are thinking of conducting these lessons and in exchange, I'll do my best to provide you with an empty classroom so that you remain undisturbed. I want to be updated with your progress and if I feel that either of you are even remotely shirking on your side of the bargain, no more boggart lessons. "
After the war had ended, they'd come. Reporters, ministry officials, aurors to drag his screaming father off to Azkaban. Draco and Narcissa had miraculously escaped that fate; his mother because she bore no Dark Mark and Lucius had pleaded convincingly on her behalf, and Draco because he was simply so young . Words like
Harry raises an eyebrow and draws out the hawthorn wand, the tingling tremor of energy surging up to meet and welcome his grip. Truth be told, this bond makes him deeply uncomfortable though not because of who the wand belongs to, rather the simple fact that it doesn't really belong to
"She might." Harry says coolly. "You have to stick to it though. I'm not doing it if you decide it's not worth your time."
"I'm in no mood to be sneered at," he says sharply, adjusting the crisp cuff of his shirt sleeve. This, too, suddenly strikes Harry; Draco is even more immaculate than usual, which is quite a feat. The cut of his high collared black coat turns every line of him into a hard edge, his hair slicked back and smooth and bringing out the angles of his jaw and pointed chin. He looks impenetrable. "No. The Hogwarts Express is
"Merlin." Ron groans, throwing himself down onto the table in mock despair just as dinner is cleared away. He grumbles into the table top, accepting Ginny's consolatory pat on the head. "You know what? Forget I asked. I'll manage with my own - or Harry will let me borrow his, won't you Harry?"
Harry turns in time to catch the handle of a broomstick hurtling his way, narrowly avoiding broken glasses. Draco is standing there, dressed down in a black turtleneck jumper and well-worn tailored trousers, the silver and green scarf cast lazily around his neck like an afterthought, not bothering with a coat and settling for his cloak despite the freezing day. He is, however, lightly holding his Nimbus 2001 in one hand.
The turrets of Hogwarts are capped in a delightful frosting of glistening snow, the morning sun reflecting off of the white landscape and dazzling Harry's eyes in its wake.
." Harry repeats forcefully as Draco allows himself one curt nod. "Please, Professor. I've been thinking about what you said at the start of term feast, about all of us being united. This is how I want to do that." Beside him, Draco makes a small sound of disgust in the back of his throat, quiet enough for only Harry to hear.
"You'll be sure to pass my regards onto Weasley, won't you? I'm positive that will brighten his Christmas." Draco teases, tucking his feet beneath himself neatly.
"I'm taking an interest in Harry's pursuits, aren't I?" Ron says, affronted. He sits up straighter, wagging a finger in Hermione's direction. "Remember when you told me we needed to encourage him more when he did stuff without us?"
Harry doesn't. He tosses the apple about between his hands for a minute, getting a feel for its weight and size, ignoring Draco tutting with impatience from above.
"Still takes some getting used to though, doesn't it?" Ron says casually, letting his gangling arms hang down the sides of the chair. "It'd be a bit weird snogging 'Mione all the time with you right there and all."
"So what are you going to do about it, Harry?" Hermione asks briskly, gently nudging Crookshanks from her lap to get ready for breakfast. She starts vanishing any stray cat hairs from her robes with her wand, glancing over at her friend.
The sight of the goblets hits home that Harry will be alone with Draco for the next hour. He hasn't given it much thought to how this is going to go but Ron had certainly made his opinion clear after Harry relayed to his friends everything that had happened since he'd left the Great Hall in pursuit of Malfoy days before.
"Well, I'd rather try it than not! Hold on - she likes biscuits." Harry explains, remembering all of the times he's been hauled to her office only to be confronted by that tartan tin of hers. "Ginger Newts!"
"You're hilarious," Harry says drily, winding back his arm to catapult the apple up and away, pleased when Draco hurtles after it on his broom, exactly what he was hoping for.
"I wasn't going to say that but it's a good point." Ron says seriously. He lowers his voice, watching Hermione rub at her arm through the sleeve of her puffer jacket, at the place Bellatrix had scarred. "Are you sure you're okay going back there?"
Over the days leading up to Christmas, there was little to occupy him. After his initial exploration of the Manor, Harry had wandered the rest of the property; he peered into the empty stables-turned-broom shed which had clearly housed an impressive collection of broomsticks before the Ministry seized the Malfoy's possessions; he toured the gardens, complete with its own hedge-maze where he'd lost his bearings and became trapped for thirty minutes before giving in by using the
Ron laughs incredulously, "Hermione, no one will even know if you let me borrow your notes if you don't tell them!"
"I wouldn't dream of it." he says absently. If Harry hadn't been noticing that the silver stripes on his tie are exactly the same shade as his hair in the darkening room, he might have seen the signs he knows all too well; the subtle change in Draco's stance, his fingers flexing by his thigh, the crease between his thin brows.
Nearly every face turns to stare at him, a noticeable hush spreading across the room. Some people actually strain to get a glimpse of him, kneeling in their seats and shoving their friends by the shoulder, the revered looks on their faces too much for Harry to bear.
Harry cannot see much of the boggart from his position and nor does he need to; his focus is directed solely on Draco and his reactions, the noticeable tremor throughout his body as the boggart-Lucius sneers and taunts. Despite Draco's bravado, he can't manage to verbalise the spell. He let's the boggart shout him down at every instance, cowed by its words as if it truly were his father in front of him.
Harry pushes past Ron, accepting his bag already held out for him by a resigned Hermione. "So I'll be quick then." he calls behind him, taking off into a sprint.
McGonagall arches an eyebrow, an incredible feat based solely off how tightly knotted the bun on her head is. "Potter, I believe we both know a saying that could be applicable in this specific situation regarding talking out of one's backside. Seeing as I am both your teacher and headmistress, I think the more appropriate phrasing for the matter is that I am not entirely positive you are being truthful with me."
Harry checks off everything he's packed, grateful for Hermione taking pity on him and casting an Undetectable Extension Charm on his backpack to save him hauling his trunk about: a ball of wrinkled clothes that he's sure will earn him Draco's disapproval, his toothbrush, several copies of Seeker Weekly that he's yet to get around to reading, a multitude of odd socks...
Also, it feels wrong to post this chapter without addressing a big issue. Joanne has been making it incredibly hard to enjoy Harry Potter these days but I won't repeat any of her views here to spare readers who are on ao3 for a respite. To anyone reading who may have been hurt by the things she has said, please know that you are
"Well, it's just too bad, I'm afraid. I'm Head Girl, I have to set an example to the younger students."
"I told you, Potter." Draco mumbles, getting to his feet, staring anywhere but at the headmistress or Harry. "I told you it would be pointless."
"Draco, as someone who was where you are now, there will always be people waiting to reach out and pull you back in."
long time. I lost my motivation for this fic but somehow, I've managed to scrape together a final chapter. I won't lie, this was really tough for me. I know it's not the best thing I've ever written and I had really hoped to get something worthwhile up for you to read to justify such a long wait. I hate the idea of disappointing you and letting you all down but I fear this is all I have in me. It was a struggle getting myself to click the post button but I've put this off long enough.
"You don't have to do that, you kn-kn-know." Harry says, pausing to expel a tremendous yawn. "I know you're together already - or have you forgotten that inappropriately timed kiss during the battle? Or the entire summer I spent with you at the Burrow? What about the journey here on the Hogwarts Express when you were making those faces at each other?"
Slughorn waves a hand dismissively as he leans towards Harry's simmering potion, "Yes, yes. That's what I said, Wesley. I expect you added too much Erumpent Horn, hmm? Harry? Mr. Filch?"
"I don't have anything to duel you with, Potter. What do you expect me to do? Wrestle it from your grasp like a Muggle? I have standards." Draco scoffs haughtily, putting his hands on his hips.
Draco takes an unconscious step forward but Harry doesn't react to it, entirely unthreatened by Malfoy. The both of them realise Draco's position in that instant, Draco's cheeks shifting to pink. "How did you find me?!"
"Ah," Draco says, eyes turned down. "Therein lies the catch: you're Harry Potter. People would line the streets to know you. The same people who would spit at my feet."
Harry watches the knuckles on Draco's hand grow impossibly white, his fingers squeezing as if to snap Harry's arm in two.
Hermione bites down on her lip, lowering her wand from Harry’s essay. “Thank you, Draco. I appreciate that.”
If it was any other night, Draco would have told Potter to go fuck himself, he didn’t know if it was because of the alcohol or because he was feeling lonely, but he wanted to confide in him.
At this Draco returned back to his earlier thought and placed his hand over Harry’s, watching his shoulders slightly fall in relaxation. His slender fingers laid against his, the warmth from his mug radiating onto Harry’s hand.
This is how their day continued, they made food together, not talking or making much eye contact, Draco flinching whenever their hands lightly brushed against each other.
Draco never did end up telling Harry what was wrong, in fact, he avoided the topic like the plague, sliding in between conversation topics quickly so as not to have a moment of silence where he could be questioned.
Draco decided against his obsessive thoughts and headed to the kitchen to make coffee, which he quickly realized was a futile attempt as there were absolutely no groceries anywhere to be found in his apartment. It felt strange being back in his own space, although more comfortable now that he knew Harry was back sleeping in the other room.
“I think he fancies you” She said, swirling the wine around in her glass before taking a sip. Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, his own cheeks now growing pink.
Draco felt his chest get heavy, like his body was having a physical reaction to this sinking feeling that he wasn’t going to like what Noah is going to say next.
“Just go home, Potter” Draco sighed, beginning to close the door before Harry caught his foot at the bottom.
Although that was a one time occurrence for him and Charlie, they had remained close friends, enjoying their own banter together while the rest of the family badgered them about finding someone to bring to family events.
In spite of the fact that he had never really enjoyed the holidays, he was quite bummed about the unfolding of events this year. At the Manor, it was expected that some sort of argument or disagreement would occur every holiday, usually ending with all of them in separate rooms and Draco bringing in the New Year alone.
Harry brought Draco closer to him, enwrapping him in a tight hug. The hug felt genuine and filled with love, the kind of pressure that Draco hadn’t received in years. The close embrace from Harry caused Draco to fill back up with emotion, it became so overwhelming that he began crying aggressively into his shoulder for the first time that night,  his body shaking. It was the kind of cry that made it hard to catch your breath, your inhales hitching in your throat whenever you tried.
“So now you speak to me?” Harry said, “is this what I have to do to get your attentionnn?” he slurred.
“Because we are going out tonight.” Draco’s shoulders relaxed but he rolled his eyes at the proposition.
At one point, they had created a game out of who could drink the most. Draco should’ve known not to participate once he saw how many shots Ron was able to throw back at one time. His mouth falling agape, receiving a boisterous laugh from Hermione and Harry.
The words took Draco by surprise, he didn’t respond, but he opened the door for Harry to enter, grabbing his arm to lead him to the couch, since he could barely walk without stumbling.
They were keeping watch of the house from across the street, it had dark red brick with overgrown moss cascading down the sides of the house, the lights still on to maintain a facade that the family was still there. Harry had grown so sick of the auror work, desperate to have an escape from dark magic that he had been forced to hunt down for his whole life. It placed substantial pressure to constantly live up to his own name - Harry Potter, the boy who lived - never allowing him to feel like he could make mistakes or be anything less than prophetic greatness. This led Harry to a distorted view of self worth, he felt that unless he was stopping the next Voldemort, he would become nothing worth remembering, it was a disproportionate punishment that he gave himself, but one he couldn’t let go of. It amazed him how Draco had dropped the auror program, it felt so oddly juxtaposed from the Draco he knew in school. Back then, Harry was known as the brave one and Draco, in Harry’s eyes at least, was a coward. Now, Harry wishes he had the ability to live by his own ruling rather than everyone else's, wishing for the bravery he sees in Draco.
“Hello Potter, long time no see.” Draco said cooly, while simultaneously interlinking his hand with Aarons, receiving a perplexed look from Aaron and a glance down at the intertwined hands from Potter. He wasn’t sure why this was his first instinct but he continued.
“Thanks to both of your patience and cooperation, I’m glad to say that your current living arrangements are no longer necessary. Despite us still tracking down some of the leaders of the Renovation, we have secured the majority of its members. I’m sure the two of you are relieved to be out of each other's hair, and I’m sorry that this was obligatory for longer than I initially thought.” He spoke, a cheeky grin on his face, almost waiting for an exclamation of joy to escape their mouths.
His legs got pushed further up towards his head as Harry pressed the tip of his cock against the anus, smiling as Draco moaned. Harry leaned forward towards Draco, bringing him into a deep kiss while his dick filled up his stomach. Draco moaned loudly into the kiss, his nails digging into Harry’s back. His mouth let out a string of curses, amongst them was a beg for Harry not to stop. He felt Harry pound further into him, grabbing his hips and thrusting his own forward.
“So tell me, whatcha been up to since Hogwarts?” Draco was just looking to make conversation at this point, he didn’t want to go home.
“What’s up between you and Noah? I saw him glaring at you like a lost puppy all night.” Potter asked between swigs of his smoke.
His night had gotten progressively worse and what he wanted to be a distraction from his feelings from Draco turned into him missing him even more than he did before.
“Ohhh boy, stress is a killer!” Draco sprung up before turning around, and bringing his mouth to Harry’s ear. Harry’s body sprung around and placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders, forcing space in between the two.
They had been travelling for nearly 16 hours at this point, and they were both exhausted, not to mention they still had 5 hours still to go. But Harry couldn’t bring himself to sleep, not when he felt this issue was still left unresolved.
“You noticed?” Draco was surprised, his friends after knowing both of them for several years hadn’t even tied the two together, at least not that he knew of.
They were tipsy enough to start slipping sexual innuendos into the conversation, giggling over slick references to their hookups, joined but a slight eyebrow raise or soft kick on the shin. If this was the real Harry, Draco couldn’t get enough of him, intoxicated with his facile remarks and nonchalant demeanour.
“Oh please, the amount of times I’ve drunk dumped my feelings on you is countless. Consider us even.” Draco had half a heart to reach over and rest his hand on top of Harry’s, but he thought against it. He figured that if anyone should make the first move right now - besides his needless flirting earlier - it should be Harry. He didn’t want to press where he wasn’t wanted.
They were now in the city center and their drunk rambles hadn’t gotten any quieter, Ron had greatly settled after a few glares from Hermione but Harry was still stumbling in his steps and singing. Draco walked up to him and yanked his hand back.
The momentum pulled Harry in more than Draco had anticipated, their bodies now only a few inches apart. He felt heat radiate off of his own chest, his breath hitched in his throat at the proximity of this man that he was desperately trying to keep at a safe distance. Harry was first to step away, as expected, and walked over to the kitchen to prepare ingredients for dinner.
“This is not unexpected as we know the group in question has been hunting down disloyal death eaters for the last year, the Goyle family was affected just last week. In the meantime, Draco has been placed under the Ministry’s watch, currently residing with our own Harry Potter.” Harry felt some quick glances in his direction.
He excused himself from the bar and went to the entrance to grab his coat, he wasn’t planning on going home yet, unwilling to face the empty guest bedroom that used to be Draco’s. As he stepped out of the warm ambiance of the pub and onto the cold winter street, only lit up by streetlights and the yellow candlelight of romantic restaurants, at which Harry scoffed at.
Draco often found his mind fixating on their lack of a label, and all of the constant mixed signals he was getting from Harry. On the one hand, he had invited him to spend a week together in Italy, which is - in Draco’s eyes anyway - about as romantic as it gets. On the other, he freezes and not so gracefully changes the topic whenever Draco begins to hint at wanting to be official. It’s not that he’s worried about being exclusive, they spent so much time together that Potter would have to try really hard to sleep with someone else - and even if it weren’t for that, he doesn’t really think he would want to.
"If anyone needs me, I'm going to be collecting my things and then I'll be in the shower for the next three hours." Ginny says miserably, snaking strands of red hair plastered to her pale cheeks. "Honestly, it's not the same without you, Harry." she adds as she passes him by on the way to the girl's dormitory, pressing a wet hand to his for the briefest second.
"I thought maybe she'd say a bit about you, if I'm being honest." Ron confesses to Harry. "You know, on account of you obliterating You-Know-Who from the face of the earth. In this room. Literally right over there where the Hufflepuff table is."
I essentially had to start from scratch. Major bummer, absolutely devastated, we're ploughing on regardless.
When Harry looks about and sees that they're some of the last to remain on the platform, he turns and finds Draco consulting his watch for the third time since they arrived at the station.
"I wish," Draco begins slowly, watching Harry chuck his bag unceremoniously onto the bed. "That you wouldn't say that so flippantly."
Golden sunshine - the kind you only find at dusk in late summer, deep and warm and orange -  slices the room clean in half. Harry walks over to the window of the Arithmancy classroom, turning to take it in; McGonagall has made the room available for Draco's first boggart lesson whilst everyone else is at dinner. There's an abundant stack of sandwiches piled high on a platter at Professor Vector's desk, a jug of water and two goblets beside it.
He wasn’t sure if he wanted to get into the interminable discussions surrounding their relationship quite yet, so he stalled through the moment but headed into the kitchen and boiled some water with the flick of his wand. Despite his lack of groceries, tea was something he always had on hand, the warm liquid spreading comfort through his chest whenever he drank it.
“I don’t know. Being vulnerable, I guess.” Draco didn’t know how to reply. Although they had often had late night conversations where they talked about a plethora of things, they had never gotten into the inner workings of Harry’s mind, he was always too closed off to share.
Merlin, were Draco’s palms damp. He wiped them against his slacks, attempting to hide his body's anxiety. He pulled the door to the bistro open, greeting the waitress and taking the familiar table in the back corner of the restaurant. He poured himself a glass of water and glimpsed over the menu, more for appearances than anything, he had already memorized everything that they had.
“I just wanted to say - you know - I’m sorry.. Um.. for barging in last night. Piss drunk. At three in the morning.” Harry laughed to himself in an attempt to hide his discomfort with the conversation.
They didn’t speak anymore, instead Aaron nodded his head in defeat, and turned to walk out the door. Before he left, he looked over his shoulder back at Draco, desperate for an interference, for Draco to beg him to stay, but after a few moments of nothingness, he dropped his head and closed the door.
“What about it?” He asked, returning back to his task after the slight hiatus. Draco didn’t even know how to answer, he didn’t know what he wanted from Harry. They were too dysfunctional to date properly, but their brief attempts at friendship had proven not to be enough.
Harry stared at him suspiciously, unsure if this was a friendly gesture or if he was simply too drunk to notice it was him. Nevertheless, he nodded and grabbed one from the box. Draco lit his lighter and brought it over to Harry’s mouth as he tilted forward and lit his cigarette. They stood in silence for a while, Draco began to take in the situation that he was put into tonight, and his mood fell drastically. He was lonely, and all the drinking and random guys had taken its toll on his mental health.
They got onto the conversation of clubbing and gay bars. Draco had never known who Aaron was interested in, whether it be girls or boys, he’s mentioned having girlfriends in the past, but had never been too enthusiastic about them.
“You obviously fancy the bloke and all this back and forth will only push him further away. What I suggest you do is to stop fucking around and tell him how you feel. People don’t stick around forever at the beck and call of Harry Potter, you know.” Casper replied, his face disappointed in Harry’s blindness to his own emotions.
Draco’s nerves grew at Harry’s ability to be so casual, even the slight scruff on his beard screamed effortless. Though he felt he always looked presentable, there was something about Harry that Draco longed for.
Draco poured the hot water over the chamomile tea bag, watching it sink to the floor of the mug. He needed honey, but the idea of asking Potter for more helped repelled him. He chose against it and scurried back to his room, breathing a sigh of relief as he closed the door behind him.
He was now working as a pharmaceutical alchemist, spending his days testing out and attempting to invent a variety of potions to solve medical issues or reverse specific hexes. It had been extremely rewarding and felt just stimulating enough without arising feelings of trauma from his past. Currently he was working on a potion to clot blood at the area of a wound in order to stop the patient from bleeding out entirely, it had been difficult and he had felt stumped for several weeks now.
“There you go” Harry grinned, knowing he had caught Draco off guard. They stayed quiet for a while, it wasn’t as uncomfortable anymore. Harry rose to his feet, walking over to his record player that one of his exes bought him. The guy was a pretentious prick but he liked the way the music sounded on record so he kept it. He played some soft music, careful not to pick anything too sensual, before heading back to sit next to Draco.
“If you still feel the same way in the morning, when the sun is up, then we can talk. Ok?” Draco asked, he knew that Harry’s feelings while intoxicated were not necessarily a reflection of his sober self, and although he wanted, needed, this desperately, he couldn’t take advantage of his state.
“Fine. I’ll go along with it if you really want.” Harry responded, as he pulled a jumper over his head.
Harry walked out of the room, the purple sleeves reaching an inch past his fingertips, the pants gathering at the base of his feet. Damn he’s cute, Draco thought, brushing the intrusive thought aside before handing Potter a mug with Earl Grey tea.
“So, I know that I’ve been avoiding a lot of your questions. I don’t really have an explanation for that, I guess I was just scared? Sometimes I get scared about pretty irrational things but I promise it wasn’t because I don’t like you. Basically what I’m saying is that I’ve been avoiding one question in particular, and I wasn’t really sure about it even though I have been pretty relationship-y so far. I don’t know I guess seeing you tonight with my friends just changed my perspective and -”
“Perhaps that’s just what you feel, but it doesn’t take a genius to notice how he looks at you.” Marie filled Draco’s glass and walked back to the table.
Draco had only come back 2 hours later, luckily he came back with the party decorations so Hermione was a little more forgiving with her death glare.
Nick pushed Draco onto the bed, crawling up on top of him, his hands unbuckling Draco’s belt as his mouth bit at his neck. Draco threw his head back to give him more access, his eyes rolling back into his head in contentment. He felt hands pull off his pants, he leaned slightly forward and slipped his shirt off his back, tossing it to the side of the bed. It was his turn to be teased, he could see the mischievous glint in Nick as he slowed down their pace, placing slow kisses as he trailed down. Draco groaned in frustration, his cock twitching at the thought of being touched. Nick came back up, their faces inches apart as he reached a finger down to the rim of Draco’s ass, watching his face as Draco moaned, leaving harsh scratches down Nick’s back. The cold finger pressed gently against the entrance, slipping in slowly as Draco squirmed at the feeling.
“I’m glad to hear it.” Harry responded, “Hey, this might be weird so feel free to decline, but would you want to grab a drink sometime? Not in a suggestive way or anything - just to catch up?”
There was no way he was going to go in. He could not handle the embarrassment of showing his face after Draco had explicitly told him that he wanted nothing to do with him. He couldn’t make it anymore clear that he did not feel the same way about Harry, and coming to his apartment in the middle of the night would not result in anything other than a scowled gaze.
The warmth was radiating off of Harry’s skin and onto Draco’s, encasing him in a blanket of protection against the world.
He stumbled into the kitchen, his face flushing up as he felt the alcohol he had consumed begin to fully take its effect. Draco poured himself a glass of scotch, clumsily tilting it up to his mouth. He just had to be drunk when they had that conversation, if he had been sober he would have been able to brush off the news as if it was just another random engagement he couldn’t care less about. But with his emotions heightened, and the expectation of some sort of hook up between the two of them tonight, it stung all the more.
“I’m sure you have overheard conversations at the Ministry that hint at the attack of your apartment being planned. There’s currently a group of death eaters calling themselves the Renovation, that are targeting other death eaters that have renounced the ways of the Dark Lord. They have been targeting them one by one. You and your family have been at the top of that list for a while now, hence why you have been placed under the protection of Potter.” Draco scoffed internally at this, his past rivalry against Potter convincing him that he definitely didn’t need Potter’s protection, despite how friendly they had gotten. Still, his pulse rate increased and he found it hard to swallow.
“Oh fuck! I’m sorry!” Aaron exclaimed as he slammed a palm over his eyes, apologizing profusely. Draco wrapped the towel over his waist and laughed at Aaron’s embarrassment, walking out of the bathroom and ruffling up Aaron’s hair as if he was a child on his way out, to which Aaron blushed like crazy.
As he rubbed his thumb over the palm of Noah’s hand, Noah drew back, breaking their stare and taking a large gulp of his wine.
Maybe that’s why he felt drawn to Draco in the first place, his authenticity with his struggles had taken Harry off guard, it wasn’t often that the people around him didn’t try to hide any discrepancies in their lives. But like all encounters he’s had with affection in the last 10 years, he did anything he could to destroy it, feeling unworthy of the love he saw everyone else experience.
Draco woke up to the sound of someone cooking in the kitchen, he could see through the cracks of his eyes that it was already dark outside, his eyes still heavy with sleep. He reached his arms out in a stretch, thankful for the dreamless sleep that finally made him feel rested. He sat up in the bed, eyes still closed as he began to feel the rest of his body waking up. Walking back out of the room, he rubbed his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt, saying a hello to Aaron.
This chapter was to sort of explain where both of the boys are at rn, do you guys prefer Draco with Harry or Aaron lmk!!
“Alright boys, thank you for your work today. Take the rest of the day off, you can worry about the paperwork next week.” Marvin responded sympathetically. Casper nearly bolted out of the door, Harry could always tell when he was really upset as he became nearly mute.
Harry was currently in a run down antique store a few blocks away from Ron and Hermione’s, he had been planning on staying in the city for the summer but quickly realized he had no hot weather appropriate clothing. So he was lazily shopping for a pair of shorts, until he spotted Draco Malfoy at the far corner of the shop, who quickly ducked underneath a rusted rack of 2 for 5 t-shirts.
“Are you sure you have no idea what they could have possibly been looking for?” Asked a stern looking auror, Draco could tell he was questioning him, but it's not as if his record was entirely clear. If whoever raided his apartment really was looking for something, Draco had not the slightest clue what it was, besides, this could have all just been to send a message to him.
The words burned in Draco’s stomach as he read them. Aaron noticed Draco’s face drop and read the paper, sighing and placing his hand on Draco’s shoulder as he did.
They all sat down at the table, enjoying their dinner and chatting amongst themselves. They sat at a table with a couple of auror’s that Oliver worked with, and alchemists that Draco knew from working with them briefly. Draco had a couple more glasses of scotch, doing shots of tequila with Marie at one point, after which she begged Oliver to try and take a shot from her belly button. Noah and Aurora made their way over to their table eventually, this was by the time Draco was already slightly intoxicated so he was more than vocal about his joy for their marriage. Yelling out how the two were made for each other and grabbing both of them into a buddy hug. A move that he regretted almost immediately after getting a scent of Noah’s cologne and pushing them away quickly. He turned away from the table, unwilling to make jokes and laugh around with them anymore, and walked over to the bar. He ordered another glass of scotch, stumbling into the bar stool as he waited.
Their arrival in Italy was less than ideal. They had chosen to stay in a rather remote town and the bus there was filled with potholes and sweaty passengers that had chosen to sit far too close to them for their liking. They made a unanimous decision to take a portkey back to London in the new year.
Dinner was more of the same, although once they were more socially lubricated with copious amounts of alcohol, the conversation had a smoother and less forced flow.
Harry looked back at Draco over his shoulder, chuckling as he saw him throw his head back, his mouth open as he looked up at the stars in the sky, they were barely visible because of the city landscape but were there nonetheless.
The door to the apartment shut and Harry let out a sigh of relief. Casper had come to his aid so he didn’t have to endure another awkward encounter with Draco. Having Draco live with him was strange, he had spent so much of his childhood hating him, that attempting to live harmoniously felt far out of Harry’s comfort zone.
“I know. Trust me. I just didn’t know what else to do. I should’ve never slept with him.” Harry sighed, his head rolling back in desperation.
He had just gotten used to the distant and argumentative ways that they had begun conversing in, but now, he found himself lying awake at 8 in the morning, and wondering if Harry’s drunken confession from the night before would result in any change between them.
Matt had attempted to kiss Harry multiple times throughout the night, trying to lean in slowly while they were talking and his gaze constantly switching to Harry’s lips. He wasn’t sure why he kept avoiding the kiss, normally it didn’t matter to Harry if the man had the driest personality or barely peaked his interest, he was just looking for a good snog.
“Are you coming?” said a voice from behind him. Draco nodded slightly and stomped on the butt of his cigarette. Turning away from Harry, he stepped into the cab.
There was a knock at the office door, Hermione peeked her head in, giving a greeting to the two boys. She had aged beautifully, her light brown hair cut into a shoulder length bob, making her look older and more mature, not that she needed the haircut to solidify those traits.
Their lips collided against each other, both of them moving onto the bed while quickly taking off the rest of their clothes, desperately trying to feel the other’s bare skin. Harry kissed down Draco’s chest, stopping at his nipples, biting at them lightly, receiving a moan from Draco in response.
Harry nodded halfheartedly, he knew he wouldn’t feel different in the morning, he had been feeling this way for months.
“Let’s get out of here” A scruffy voice whispered. Draco simply nodded, as the man grabbed his arm gently and led him out of the building.
The two of them began their walk, stopping by random shops to kill time, it's not like they were in any rush. They walked past one in particular, one that reminded him of when he would shop in Diagon Alley before every school year as a kid, they had books and random scratchy sweaters and the new Nimbus broom. He looked in awe as he realized just how much more developed the brooms had gotten since the last time he had rode one. He didn’t realize until then just how much he had missed flying, it was one of the things that allowed him to forget his problems as a kid and gave him a sense of freedom. A feeling he was desperately craving for at the moment. He looked at the price tag and thought otherwise, Draco was well off but still could not justify spending that amount of money on a broom when he lived in London and rarely played Quidditch. Regardless, he stared at the beauty with doe eyes before turning around and continuing their walk home. Aaron had noticed him staring but chose not to say anything, Draco was glad, he was tired of talking.
Casper and Harry had been doing desk work for hours, it was already nearly 6 in the evening and almost everyone had cleared out and gone home. The pair was used to working outrageously long hours, but it's not like either of them had anywhere else to go. They were going over the details of the Goyle case, attempting to find similarities between them and the Malfoy raid. The only aspects they had in common was a death eater mark left on the floor of all the targeted homes. There was no way to know how many people were in this organization and just how serious of a threat it is to anyone who was a death eater but has since retired that title. Harry had trouble finding sympathy for these individuals sometimes, after all, they had at one point aligned with Voldemort’s ideals, and something like that isn’t easily let go of. Nevertheless, Harry tried to put his own biases aside and protect the potential targets of this organization.
“I am assuming he will stay in the Potter residence for no less than a month, until we gather our resources to track the location of the next attack.” Harry’s mouth fell agape. Since when did he become a bed and breakfast for ex death eaters? It was bad enough he had to feel uncomfortable in his own home, but to have to keep Draco as a guest for that long felt like his own personal form of torture. Harry kept a mental note to confront Marvin after the meeting, surely the Ministry safe houses would be emptied out within the next week.
He thinks back to the first time he felt he truly bonded with Harry, about how he could feel the warmth radiating off of his skin, and how he had leaned in to kiss him. Looking back, it was probably better that Harry had avoided it, they would have hooked up and it would have been incredibly awkward coming back from it.
“Sure, let me just get my stuff, I’ll meet you by the entrance.” Aaron nodded, his appearance lately has been more and more solemn. Draco felt he should be concerned, but whenever he asked Aaron about it directly, he just avoided the question or changed the subject. After a while, Draco stopped asking.
At one point they had migrated to the kitchen, determined to create some sort of makeshift snack despite having a desperate lack of groceries. It took them far longer than necessary, laughing fits kept slowing their efficiency down. Draco was laughing so hard his jaw was aching, his stomach contracting as he bent over, grabbing Harry’s shoulder to stabilize himself.
“Well, you can either get off your ass and go home, or you can stay and help me out with the Malfoy case. Up to you.” Casper said, clearly growing impatient with Harry’s indecision. Despite being a great adviser at times, patience was never Casper’s strong suit.
“Fine. If you don’t mind, I’ll let you two enjoy your day.” As he pushed past the two of them, head down walking away quickly.
Harry wanted to cry and run away, but he tried again, this time with slightly more force, as if urging him to kiss back. And he did. His lips pressed back against Harry’s, slow and soft, both of them scared that if they make drastic moves that it’ll scare the other away.
