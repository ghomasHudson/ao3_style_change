“Scared, had a bad dream,” she responded, head in the crook of his neck. Draco winced in sympathy. Dreams were no cakewalk, even for an adult. Imagining the horrors Isabelle's mind could from her experiences, he couldn't help hugging the girl tighter to his chest.
Draco gave Isabelle the warm milk and rubbed her back as she drank deeply from the mug. Macy sipped at her own cup, and the three of them sat in silence until Mittsy reappeared in front of them.
“Aww! But your interactions are still so famous in the house. Mr. ex-Prince of Slytherin,” Macy gave a snide remark. “According to the older years. You were the only one who would, and I quote, ‘show that righteous prick what’s what.’”
Draco sat in his customary place at the small round table in the tea room. A luke- warm cup of white tea grasped loosely in one hand, while the other supported his head. His legs were crossed at the knees, his grey eyes tracking the slow, hypnotic swaying of the hanging branches of the willow tree out of one of the massive windows that lined the wall of the room.
Reaching over to get a hold on Max’s waist, Draco turned so he was now on his back with Max trapped by one arm. Shutting his eyes, he blindly reached for Isabelle as well to get her to lay down.
Draco startled at the name. He had met the Hawkes’ once before. A meeting he wouldn't soon want to repeat.
Unfortunately, the new spell wasn’t perfect. These alerts weren't uncommon, since they detected anything with a magical aura. Which meant Draco dragged his body into the cool morning air when he felt that electric tingling run across his skin. Even if the sun was just starting to peek above the horizon. If it was up to the young man he’d be in bed for few more hours.
“Neither. We are traveling into muggle London, where we’ll be shopping in a large building sectioned off into individual stores. The muggles call it a ‘mall,’” Draco said, his excitement a little more restrained than Macy’s own.
“Not just that. You looked terrible after the war,” She said, not one to mince words, “I was worried when you didn’t return to Hogwarts, but I’m glad. You seem like you’re in a good place now.”
Draco sighed as he stopped, staring into the fireplace. Orange flames licked at the cracking wood. The light gave the surrounding furniture a warm glow and had shadows dancing across the floor. Draco wondered idly what spell the Hogwarts dining hall used to replicate the sky. The room could do with some brightening, even if it’s from an artificial sky.
Macy stood next to Thomas looking bored as hell. Her wand twirling expertly between the fingers of her right-hand. Draco caught notice of her perfectly manicured nails, painted bright red. He’s eyes were drawn to the tiger print on her thumb. A smirk formed on Draco’s face as the sight procured a memory of Pansy practicing her skills in the art of nail polish. She spent first year with horrid nails due to this.
He poured the milk in a cup, adding a dash of honey and cinnamon. Casting a warming charm on it, an idea began to form in his mind.
Max was stuck in a continuous loop. Where he would place a scoop of food onto his plate before giving Draco a worried glance, then move the food back. It took many reassurances from Draco for Max to keep a bowl of soup and a sandwich.
“Where’s Macy?” Draco asked. Simultaneously, Jasmine and Thomas pointed toward the other end of the isle.
Despite the look of concentration set on his face, Draco wasn’t deep in thought. Instead, his mind was occupied with keeping track of the birds flying around the willow. But since ornithology wasn’t one of Draco’s many skills, he’d had little success in his endeavors.
It took him standing there in front of the mirror, hands braced on the marble surface to come to this epiphany. A scene so like the one in sixth year, but this time was different as well.
“Anytime Harry. If you come by in about an hour, I should have everything ready.” Without so much as a ‘goodbye’ Luna ended the call. Harry was familiar with this as Luna refused to end a conversation with a goodbye claiming it was bad luck.
When the trio made it back to the Manor, Draco was quick to clean them of every flake of paint before he was forced to hang the paintings.
“You can’t be serious! What about them?” Harry gestured to the group, “we can leave them here with Malfoy.”
Mittsy already had dinner cooking when they stepped out of the fireplace. But first, Draco had to make sure that Isabelle and Max were scrubbed clean of all dirt.
Macy and Jasmine walked directly to the kneazles that lounged in the sun. The animals were so used to people's presence that they didn’t react as the two girls approached. Draco leaned against the fence as he watched them with the animals, Thomas by his side.
“Oh! Gross!” Macy said, her face seemed to cave in on itself, her hands used to cover her ears, “I don’t want to hear that.”
“You still have house elves? How pathetic.” Potter mutters, which Draco ignored. He knew the other man was just trying to rile him up hoping for an excuse to bring him into the DMLE.
“Come along Kiki. We wouldn’t want to keep them waiting too long.” Draco said, picking her up and walking out the room.
“Not tired.” Jasmine said quickly and with finality while trying to remove her makeup with a wet cloth. The others were quick to back her statement up.
“Yes Malfoy, because that’s what I want to do on my weekends. To stalk a pompous assss-” Harry glanced down at Max and Isabelle as they made faces at Teddy, causing high pitched giggles to erupt from the youngest mouth, “-with my godson.”
“Potter!” Draco yelped. Luna’s eyes fell to them once more and Draco swallowed his complaint. Plastering a disarming grin on his face until their instructor looked away.
“Thank Merlin,” she exclaimed, a wide smile on her face. She reached for her wand and waved the slender piece of wood, making several files fly into her hand.
“Stop! Draco’s my friend and I love him so stop being mean.” Clutching his hand tighter, as if to squeeze the others harsh words away.
Meanwhile, Isabelle looked despondently at the ground, where one foot was idly kicking. Her small hands gripped onto the straps of her pack.
The angry teen opened his mouth, ready to deliver a scathing remark to the older man when he walked in. That was until he caught sight of Isabelle and Macy, and his anger quickly cooled into concern.
“What the bloody hell do you think you’re doing?” Draco yelled, jogging toward the group. His shout startled the older children, the sliced hair and scissors dropped to the ground.
“I know that reading those books attracts criticism, but I like how everyone ends up with a happy ending. The bad guy is who you expect, and the hero will always win. And despite the heroine’s tragic past she is able to find happiness in the end.” Jasmine said, not looking at Draco as she worked.
“I suppose they are, but they all can't be scary.” Harry said, giving Draco a meaningful glance. But, the other man didn't want to decode the symbolize in his words, so the sentiment went ignored.
“Can I get either of you some tea?” He asks, honey-sweet. McClain accepted with a head bow, Harry remained silent which he took as a no.
“We’ll be back soon, and you both will have some much fun with Draco you won’t even notice we’re gone.”  Macy assured, hugging the two close. She released them wiping the wetness that had gathered in her eyes.
“What did I hear about vermin?” Draco said darkly. Letting the doors close as he stalked to the group.
Potter seeing his struggle offered to carry Isabelle, if someone would push Teddy for him. A job Jasmine volunteered for. The brunette approached Draco hands raised expectantly.
McClain gave his protege a stern look, “Harry, despite your many achievements you can’t go do what you want. Besides, I see no crime here. When you’ve been in this line of work as long as I have, you’ll start to get a feeling about these things. Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, for the tea and I apologize for the inconvenience.”
Pride because Isabelle showed magical signs so young and relief because of how small the incident was. Every wizard and witch knew of the deviation untamed magic could cause.
Draco had to yell the last part to the group as they scattered around to observe the different tanks. Draco followed them, making sure to locate each one of his charges as he went.
Draco would know, his father had forced him to memorize entire lineages of prominent pureblood families. With his curiosity piqued, Draco scanned the only paragraph on the page:
Harry gave the boy a smile and held out a hand, understanding that the boy was nervous about him from the time they meet. But instead of walking over to give it to him, Max threw the bottle at Harry; unwilling to get closer to the scary man.
Goosebumps formed on his arms when he thought on the stories about the messengers of bad luck, ravens. Seeing one so close to home, especially a magical one, could only mean something unfavorable is around the corner.
“There you are, Kiki. All done!” Draco said, patting her on the shoulder and stood. She looked at him with solemn green eyes, her hair now just short of her shoulders.
“Nobody likes me.” Macy said, but was quick to correct herself, “I mean, when I walk down the halls everyone who’s not wearing the same green and silver colors sneers at me and I feel so disgusting. Last year, I had decided to stop wearing my tie, but they still stared at me. I’m constantly scared of being hexed.”
A mess of flour, egg shells, butter, and chocolate batter spread across the marble. Some of which had landed on the three during the cake making process. Draco dreaded bringing out the frosting and sprinkles once the cake was finished in the oven.
Max tugged on Draco’s robes and pointed to the door to the right of his and asked, “Can I have this room?”
But as the group approached a lone hut in the center of a field Draco began to doubt Potter’s intentions.
In the same store, Jasmine found two one-thousand-piece puzzles that she could work on. One was a picture of a bunch of cats and the other was of a castle surrounded by a green meadow with flowers blooming in it.
The picture was slightly off center, and Jasmine was closer to the lens then the rest of them, but they all were happy.
“No, if I’m forced to go out, it’s going to be to someplace interesting not lame,” Thomas directed that last bit at Macy.
“We don't exactly have any friends out of our house. And we're pretty much blacklisted in Slytherin.” A bitter laugh followed this.
Grey eyes met brown, “I understand that life can get bad and stressful, and you need a way to escape, but this,” Draco ran a thumb across the edge of the bandage, “is not a healthy distraction. Can you promise me if you feel like that again to come find me, it doesn’t matter what I’m doing or what time it is, OK?”
Draco stood at the entrance of the mall and sent a silent apology to the parents who he'd given dirty looks for their messy appearance and wild kids.
“See! But next him don’t throw the object instead roll it to him or place it on the ground for him to get himself.”
But against his believe, the man voiced his agreement. This was a lesson he learned early in life; if one was to be remembered fondly it wouldn't do to disagree with others. Lucius made sure Draco knew this, so he could climb the metaphorical political ladder.
“Wait.” Max called, causing the group to stop at an intersection. He stepped to the foliage that lined the path to take pictures of the large, colorful flowers. They moved out of the way of the path.
“Oh, are you talking to me – the only sane one between the four of us.” Jasmine said, eyebrow raised.
“Not right now. It’s time for bed and you need to a bath,” Draco said, tapping a finger on her nose and setting her back on the ground.
The pressure on his head increased as the culprit realized Draco was awake. Looking up, Draco met the eyes of Isabelle who sat crossed legged in front of him, her hands still gripping blonde strands.
“Thank you Mittsy. You can go back to bed,” he said, lifting Isabelle once more and leaving the empty cup on the table. “Let’s go, Kiki.” Looking back at Macy, who had a look of surprise when Draco gestured at her to follow them, “You too, Macy. Come on.”
Throughout, Isabelle had been playing with the water but as the bath wore on her eyelids began to droop.
Entering Max’s room, Draco saw the small boy sitting on a chair in the corner of the room, twiddling his fingers.
“You can wear that one tomorrow Kiki. Mittsy took that shirt for cleaning.” Draco compromised, hoping that the use of her nickname would soften the scowl on her face.
“Yes, you look quite impressive, but you have something just here.” He used his thumb to wipe a streak of flour from Draco’s cheek. He could feel his cheek warm under Harry’s touch. The brunet stepped back his voice soft, “There, perfect.”
“Shouldn’t an Auror be in better shape? Did you run around the whole Manor?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
Draco looked back at the picture of the skittish boy. Pity and grief bloomed in his chest. He slowly shut this file after signing it and replaced it with the forth folder.
“Stop. No one's going anywhere. Macy please stop screaming.” Draco brought out his wand, “First, we need to get the Aurors down here.”
The blonde man used a simple spell that hung the little girl’s clothes in the closet, while she organized her stuffed animals on the bed, faced toward her. Once they were all placed to her satisfaction, she began to pace in front of them like a general in front of her army. She was still explaining the rules of the room to her new friends of when Draco left the room: no being mean to each other, clean up after yourself, and no staying up past bedtime.
“What’d I say about mentioning Boy Wonder.” Draco said giving her the side eye, but Jasmine didn’t waver, her gaze steady on Draco.
“Don’t Potter, not here.” Draco scanned the crowd as they began to take notice of the commotion. Harry sensing Draco’s discomfort stepped closer to whisper more effectively.
Draco couldn’t stop a huff of amusement from leaving his lips or the small smile from forming, even if he wanted too. Seeing the movement of Draco’s face muscles, Harry beamed even more. For Harry, Draco's smile was a rare sight, let alone one that he had caused.
Thomas responded, “We all could do with a little relaxing.” Which had everyone nodding in agreement.
Nagini would then leap, jaws gaping. She'd be close enough that Draco could count the scales on her face and see the poison dripping off her fangs. The dream always ended there, with Draco jumping out of bed, arms raised in defense, his breathing labored.
Draco slowed his steps noticing the two youngest struggled to keep up with the longer legs of their companions. Figuring it would be inappropriate to try to carry either of them.
“Jasmine, I don’t think anyone can call you stupid. But I know what you mean. Slytherin’s aren’t exactly popular people in Hogwarts right now and the mood within the house isn’t much better. Merlin, it’s so stifling to be in the common room.” Thomas punctuated his words by throwing himself back, so he was lying flat on the floor arms outstretched. He stared up at the dimly lit ceiling as if it held all the answers to the questions of the universe.
“Wow, Mr. Potter your clouds look so cool.” Isabelle praised. She wasn’t wrong, the man’s clouds looked very realistic.
As Draco spread the healing salve across the cuts, he asked, “Why do you scratch at your arm so much?”
“They’re saying you’re starting a new Dark Order.” Potter’s words froze Draco, the door half closed.
“Good. That’s the exact reaction that I want. I can’t turn up looking sloppy, one may think I’m unfit to look after these children.”
Draco took a deep breath before addressing the room, “The only advice I can give you all, is to never give in. Keep your head held high and wear your house colors proudly. Show them you're not leaving, and that their hatred and prejudice won’t win. If there is one thing, I learned during the war is that hatred will never win against determination and-” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose before muttering, “I can’t believe I’m going to say this, - love.”
“It was romantic,” Macy haughtily said, “but I wouldn’t expect you to know anything about romance. I bet all you want to do today is go see a Quidditch match.”
He squirted a generous amount of body wash onto a square cloth and handed it to Isabelle, instructing her to clean her body while he rinsed her hair. Draco ran his fingers through the wet strands inspecting the girls scalp for any insects. Not finding any, he lathered her hair with shampoo and conditioner.
“I’m not following you. Teddy and I have been here long enough and if I don’t get him back home before dinner Andromeda will kill me.” Harry said with something resembling a pout.
However, once it was explained that he wasn't trying to force her out of the manor, she accepted the gifts with enthusiasm. After that, Mittsy demanded nothing but the best clothes. She wanted all other house elves to envy her (and to prove that she had the best Master of all).
“Come on guys! This way,” Macy called over her shoulder, already heading toward the first store, a shoe outlet.
Sneaking a look at Potter, who was helping Isabelle straighten her canvas, Draco would have to remember to thank him. Merlin, he was growing soft.
“How about theses, Kiki? Look, they’re pink, and they light up.” He finished the statement by hitting the shoes together, causing the lights on the soles to flash.
His mother’s garden had always been a sanctuary for Draco. A place where he could relax and bask in the sun. He’d often sought out the garden when he felt overwhelmed. During his tumultuous teenage years, he had practically lived there.
“Draco, Mr. Auror man’s not doing the pose correctly.” Isabelle tattled, drawing all their sights to the man still in mountain pose.
“Oh, ha ha ha, like you would do any better with an animal.” Thomas snapped, leaning back against the fence.
Hermione didn’t even answer his fire call, which was what Harry expected. The bushy haired woman had just recently started an internship at Hogwarts and was bursting with excitement for her days as a professor-in-training.
Once he was sure that the older children weren't going to fall back asleep, he rushed to dress Max and Isabelle. Unsurprisingly, Max was already dressed in black trousers, a gray shirt, and a black robe with blue lining. It was Isabelle that presented a challenge that morning.
“This is Mr. Humphrey. He’s here from the Ministry to finally take you off my hands,” Tally said, gesturing to Draco.
“-ut it’s not possible to-” The other man stood besides Draco’s bed in his red Auror robes looking around dumbfounded by his new surroundings. His crossed arms fell loosely to his sides. Their eyes met and if it wasn’t for the situation that Draco was in, he may have laughed at the look Potter was giving him.
Even Mittsy wasn’t spared this blanket of despair that seemed to have fallen over the house. She hadn’t even glared at Harry when his toe got caught on the edge of a dais holding a family heirloom.
“Jasmine, w- you,” Draco started, trying to collect his words. When his eyes fell to the instrument in her hands he wound up saying, “Where’d you get that?”
They were staring, it was making his skin crawl. Draco ran a hand through his new cut feeling the soft, recently shaved hair. The sides and back were cut short, while the top was kept long an loose, letting it swoop back.
Draco hummed in agreement. Surprised to find a Ravenclaw with such a fanciful view. Though he supposed after everything life has thrown at her, she needed to believe in a happily ever after.
What’s the worst that could happen. After all, a Hippogriff had already mauled him nothing else could top that disaster.
“I can wait.” Max answered meekly. Draco set his hand on the smaller’s head, noticing the slight wince at the contact. He took a mental note to continue with small, caring contact. From what he has seen, Max hasn’t had many affectionate gestures directed toward him in his short life.
"Look, this is my Manor and you all are welcome to stay here,” Draco explain. The uncomfortable twisting of his gut telling him the potion was about to wear out.
“If you’re sure.” Draco said before his hand shot out, fingers closing around the small instrument. He tossed it back to its owner, “Goodnight.”
He looks the same as when he was that stupid, naïve teenager. Back when he thought his parents could do no wrong; that they would always do what’s best for him. But looking into grey eyes and thinking about last night, Draco had a realization.
“No. The owner is probably bragging that Harry Potter stole their late grandmother’s possession.” Draco said.
Draco checked twice to confirm that Max and Isabelle were still by his side as smoke poured out of the train's shoot. A window dropped open a few meters away from the trio and Macy’s head popped out.
Jasmine stood off to the side, her hair up in a bun like the one she wore in the picture. In her hand was an open book titled
Draco learned that his father’s beliefs were wrong in the most uprooting way possible. And would be the first to say that Lucius had many, massive faults.
“Good, now let’s take off those dirty clothes.” Draco said eyeing her robes, “Those need to be destroyed too, so they may never see the light of day again.”
“But I was having fun!” Isabelle pouted, but took Draco’s hand and followed him out. “She said she liked it here, and that she was very happy to meet me.”
In the next couple of weeks Mittsy proved to be a godsend to Draco. She was able to get most of the supplies that the three students would need for the upcoming year. But it seemed like every other day one of them remembered something that they had to have for classes.
In periods of high stress, the child used pain to distract himself from the cause of anxiety. A bandage was wrapped around the area to protect the healing wounds.
Thomas quickly placed the animal back on the ground when Harry turned his back. He reached for the hand cleaning station beside the gate and furiously scrubbed off the germs now on his hands. Sighing in relief once his hands were disinfected.
“And if I was sure that your goal was to protect them instead of trying to discredit me, I would let you.” Draco said voice increasing as he stepped closer to the other man.
Thomas laughed good naturedly then engulfed the older man in a hug. Draco could have sworn he heard his ribs groan from the force, but he didn’t complain. Instead, he wrapped his own arms around the boy and gave back as good as he got. Both were smiling when they parted.
Max was next, followed soon by Jasmine, Isabelle, and finally Macy. Draco made sure that each child could correctly pronounce the name of their destination before allowing any of them to go. He heard stories of wizards ending up in the strangest of places if even one syllable was off.
“Well,” Jasmine said. “It’s too bad you know nothing of it. A few of my fellow Ravenclaws and I were trying to recreate it, but we were unsuccessful. The most we figured out was to see Hogwarts layout and everyone inside. Just not their movements.”
Once he had shown the kids the entire first floor, Draco took them outside to catch the last rays of light. Macy and Max were both enamored with the floral garden. Using a pruning tool he’d summoned, Draco presented the five with a white rose each.
“This is the only thing I have left of my life before the war. It only activates with a specific phrase."
Naturally, Harry ignored that. He strolled into their shared office space determined to find the piece of evidence that would crack this case.
By the time Draco had the correct size down and helped Max into them, Isabelle called out to him for attention. Looking over to the girl, he found her struggling to walk in shiny, pink, seven-and-a-half centimeter heels.
“No, Potions aren’t really my area of interest.” Jasmine stated haughtily, picking up the discarded book. It was then opened, and Jasmine began to read once more, a single finger tracking her spot on the page.
The two joined Max and Mittsy at the table, who were both wearing a tiara. Max held out another one to Draco as he sat down to place the cool metal on his head. Isabelle cleared her throat and in a royal tone announced, “Now the tea party of the princess’ of the house can begin!”
He was half way down the stairs when he realized how his grumbling resembled that of Filch. Shuddering at the thought, Draco continued his hunt, head high and lips shut.
Only a single letter from his friends was delivered to his door since he’d been released. It stated, on no uncertain terms, all correspondence with him would stop. They feared the backlash if they continued interacting with the fallen Malfoy.
It wasn’t right. Even Draco could recognize that - he had seen pure evil in the eyes of a crazed man. He could tell when something was villainous, and Isabelle is so, so far from evil.
Of course, Isabelle had the time of her life as they traveled down the mountainside. She pretended that they were in the middle of an earthquake. Max was soon roped into the game, he was the citizen-in-distress that Isabelle was to save.
Harry gazed at the quill a look of horror passed over his face, “Someone gave it to me to use to sign. Do you think I should go back?”
Gathering the two’s chosen shoes, they went in search for the others. They finally found Jasmine and Thomas sitting with their shoe selection sprawled around them. In Jasmine's lap was a pair of light blue Vans, and Thomas had on a pair of gray Nike sneakers and black converses.
Thankfully, Thomas took pity on the crazy-eyed man and scooped Isabelle up, allowing Draco to hold Max’s hand. Both took turns nudging the two older girls in the right direction.
Jasmine was more hesitant, but when Draco held is arms open to her it wasn't long before she wrapped her arms around Draco as well. The hug didn’t last long but both gave a tight squeeze. Jasmine cleared her throat as she took a step back, a slight blush on her cheeks.
Twirling in her seat, Macy graced Draco with a smile, “They are literally the only band with decent music. Which is why I’m going to start my own band, to bring some actual good music to this dreadfully boring world.”
The rest of the meal was filled with jokes about his haircut. They call it playful teasing, Draco calls it harassment. While Isabelle continued to pout from his rejection and Max sat looking sad.
It was a sunny, spring day. Chirping birds rested in tree branches rich with green leaves. Flowers of all colors were beginning to bloom. Children ran and jumped through puddles left by the morning rain. Their laughter drowned out their parents’ shouts to be careful.
Draco told them it wasn’t necessary for them to join. He appreciated the gesture, but they didn’t have to if they didn’t want to.
But the scathing words died on his lips when he didn’t see sneers directed at him. Rather the two women stared with awe and admiration, just not at him. He should have known that Potter’s presence would be enough to overlook his own reputation.
And that was it. Draco stared at the empty doorway for a minute. All he had to do now was sign a few papers and the children were free to go with him.
The next morning, Draco stood at the mirror appraising his reflection. He looked wrecked. Eyes red with dark bags, evidence of the late night. His hair damp from the shower and mussed from the towel clenched in one fist. The blond locks tickled his cheeks where they rested, moving with the man’s slight motions.
Draco wasn’t nearly old enough to be called 'mister,' but it was unlikely he'd ever meet this girl again, so he’d let it slide. With a swift 'Good evening' Draco left Isabelle.
“This is my room just in case I’m needed. The rooms on both the first and second floors have been prepared for guests, so you can take your pick. Each room has its own washroom and I had Mittsy pick out some old clothes that will fit you, should you need clean clothes.”
Jasmine had her book out, continuing to read when her questions were ignored. Thomas was the only one with anything to say, but it was always to throw insults Draco’s way.
Obnoxiously happy music accosted the group as they walked away from the transit line. The music would be overpowered, every now and then, by the screams of excited children. Draco took a second to recover to ensure that his lunch wasn’t going to reappear. Isabelle tugged at his shirt signaling the end of his break.
Harry leaned in close to Draco, the sharp scent of his after shave invading the blonde's space. Their arms brushing, Draco didn't know if he wanted the other man to lean closer or to step far, far away.
“Are you sure it wasn’t because you were jealous of me getting to ride it?” Draco felt anger rise in him, Potter didn’t know when to stop poking the snake. Isabelle interrupted him before he had time to start in on the other man, which would have included an impressive array of curses.
“Perfect, go ahead and take those parchments with you. They’re to prove that you now have guardianship. If you ever want to be rid of them, all that needs to be done is for the new guardian to sign the legal forms. Although, good luck trying to find someone; I’ve been trying for almost two years now,” she finished with a laugh.
“Man, I wish we were in the slash row!” Thomas said as they left the aquarium. There was a collective disappointed agreement from the others.
Macy knelt beside Isabelle pointing at the fishes swimming by. Draco saw Thomas and Max heading toward the entryway with a sign above that read,
The kids dipped their hands in the paint and flung it at each other and the older men. Potter gave Draco a wink as the kids joined in, then picked them up so they could place a hand imprint the blonde's cheeks.
Draco entered Max’s room, weighed down by tons of bags and prepared to organize them once more, but seeing the small boy brought him up short. Max was sitting at the desk, the five newly bought dragons lined up in front of him. His left hand picking idly at the healing cuts, his teeth worrying his bottom lip; the boy didn't seem aware of his habits.
Draco looked on in horror as Isabelle regaled the table about her first meeting with him, the turkey half chewed in her mouth.
But what really drew Draco’s attention were the tattoos that decorated her arms. The ink appeared to dance across her skin as she moved, the patterns reached to the sleeves of Luna's shirt.
The goat refused to leave Draco alone. It kept butting its head against his thigh looking for another bite to eat. No amount of shoving or edging away from the animal would deter this mammal from its goal.
“Enough, Mr. Nitwiker! Now you all be good for Mr. Humphrey. If not, he might send you to stay with your parents in Azkaban.” With that she turned on her heel and left the group.
“Of course I am. They don’t like me because they recognize me as a superior being to them.” Draco sniffed.
Thankfully, none of the children noticed the attention they were attracting too distracted by the unique culture surrounding them. It was truly a sad day when Draco Malfoy was the muggle expert of the group.
Despite the declaration of Draco's innocence, the rest of the wizarding world weren't as forgiving. There had been many occasions where his infamy had brought trouble. Before long, Draco had to wear a disguise to navigate the streets unharmed. Learning the hard way that people only cared about the mark on his arm.
Draco stood in front of them arms crossed and foot tabbing - his tone firm as he said, “This is getting ridiculous. They left two days ago, I let you tow mope yesterday because I know it’s hard to say goodbye to someone you care about but now, we must get it together. We’ll see them again soon and you’ll be able to write to them.”
Draco closed his eyes and rested his head against the door, weighing the pros and cons of keeping it shut forever. Reluctantly, he re-opened the door to admit the two and led them into the tea room.
“I am her legal guardian I can do whatever I want. Now, what happened to my ward?” She opened her mouth to answer and Draco leaned into her space. “What don’t you understand here? I’m. Not. Talking. To. You.”
“Yep! Of course, can’t wait!” Macy squeaked out, enthusiasm forced into her tone. Her eyes never leaving her hands, unable to meet another's eyes.
Which was true. Isabelle was boneless against Draco’s shoulder, little snores coming out of her mouth.
The next document was for Thomas Nitwiker's sister, Macy Lauren Nitwiker. A thirteen-year-old girl. Draco could see the family resemblance; both had brown hair and the same hazel eyes. Their facial structures so similar that a genetic link could be the only explanation.
“I have some salve that’ll help with cuts and bruises if you have any that needs to be treated.” Draco said trying to once more ignore the rapidly moving ball.
He was out on the street ready to once more try his hand at the locked door of his office when he saw a flash of blonde in the corner of his eye.
Draco glared at Jasmine, who gazed right back. “Don’t you dare! I swear Jasmine if you-” He cut off his statement as Jasmine played her own plus two on top of Macy’s.
It wasn't a lesson he acted on often; Draco loved to argue, after all. But he did know when to use it for his advantage.
The brunette waved wildly at them. Jasmine and Thomas stood behind Macy’s shoulder. They were also waving but safely in the compartment.
“Oh, so I’m Malfoy again? And watch your language, there are kids around.” Draco could help himself from pestering Harry, as he left the room in search for those kids. Knowing that Harry would follow him and not simply apparate out of the Manor.
“Everyone up! It’s already nine. We have a busy day ahead and if you sleep any longer, we won’t get through it all! A bit of forewarning: if you’re not down for breakfast soon, I take no responsibility for Mittsy’s actions.
A smoky blue trail appeared a few meters away from Draco. It swirled as if being disturbed by the wind and never rose above his knee.
The goats suddenly stopped their advance as a sharp whistle broke through the air. They about faced and trotted over to a crouched Harry Potter with animal feed cupped in both his hands. The two animals that practically attacked Draco and Thomas a second ago, were now nosing peacefully at Potter’s hands.
Their bags, once enlarged, took up the table. A few threatened to fall, hanging precariously on the edge. Only Draco’s quick wand work saved them from falling to the ground.
The writing was hastily written and short worded. As Draco read over the words on the page a ball of anger and sadness built in him.
Draco stopped next to the child. He shifted from foot to foot unsure of what to say while the girl sobbed, clutching her unwanted haircut.
When Teddy was lifted out of the stroller, Isabelle took his hand and led him to a goat chomping on a clump of grass. Max was right beside them the whole way, a determined to look after the two and keep them out of trouble.
“Then we go to court. I’ll take on you and Hogwarts. Trust me I won’t lose I have the best lawyer in the country.”
Luna crouched in front of the kids, “Did you have fun?” Two nods of agreement, “then it’s all good.”
“They’re mine, and I’m giving them to you to wear.” Draco handed them to Max, who then began to dress in the shirt and shorts that Mittsy had been able to find for the child.
“Mittsy could you go and inform the kids of our guests." Rolled his eyes as Potter's eyes hardened when his house elf appeared. “And could you tell them to meet us here. Thank you.”
The rumpled note still in his fist held Thomas’ rushed handwritings stating that Macy was in the hospital wing and needed help. And if Thomas was asking Draco for help it must be urgent.
At this moment, Draco understood Gryffindors better than he likely ever will again. This plan, although rushed and short-noticed, had somehow worked. None of his previous schemes had worked out as well, despite the hours he took to plan them.
Maybe the hero won’t barge in, a curse on his lips, ready to vanquish the enemy, but that's not what Draco needed.
Max waved back shyly, while Isabelle had both hands over her head waving and jumping up and down. Draco gave his own wave.
But on this day, the nasty taste of the Polyjuice potion seemed remarkably more unappealing. So, he left the Manor with only a large hood to obscure his features.
Much to Draco's grief, time seemed to slow as they walked to the Manor, but the gates did eventually appear in the distance. Signaling an end to Draco's misery.
They could do with a few hearty meals and a comfortable bed. Which Mittsy would be overjoyed to supply to them. Draco felt anger flood his system; now this was an emotion he was familiar with.
Draco picked up two of the polaroid’s for closer study. From the looks of it, Max has quite the eye for photography.
Jasmine wanted to spend some time in a bookstore, a two stories tall shop, to buy a few of her own books. Draco used that tome to look for children books for Max and Isabelle. His library was sorely lacking literature of that level. Macy and Thomas were even able to find a book or two for themselves.
They continued about the zoo, roaming from one exhibit to the next. Seeing the different creatures such as the jobber knolls who, according to Jasmine, were silent until they died and grizzly bears. The last of which prompted a debate between Thomas and Macy about who would win in a fight; a bear or a shark.
“You all are in so much trouble,” Jasmine said, shaking her head. Then, proceeded to lift the children out of the maze of leather boxes.
Macy wanted to spend the rest of their time in a store filled with makeup products. It was here that Draco felt like he needed to restrict the purchases slightly; Macy was only thirteen, after all. Eventually, she convinced him to buy her a small collection, if she promised not to go too overboard with it.
The group burst through the magicked brick wall of platform 9¾. The train was already stationed, the only people left on the platform were parents and a few stragglers that were nervous to leave. In the windows boys and girls could be seen waving to their families. Others hid their face to avoid any embarrassment from their parents.
Draco smiled as he set up his station. Looks like this trip had been good for them judging by the excitement exuding off Max and Isabelle.
Scowling, Draco threw the pillow back right as Jasmine walked between a couple of pillows in her arms. His throw hit the unintended target on the side of her head. At Jasmine's astonished face, Macy let out a high-pitched laugh.
A plump woman whose auburn hair had streaks of grey at the temples greeted Draco with a firm handshake. She wore a lavender shirt adorned with many ruffles and her khaki pants had a dark stain on the leg from jelly coated fingers. Her shoes made for comfort not style.
Draco nodded to himself after a short scan of the washroom revealed that Mittsy had thought of everything. A stool stood in front of the toilet and the sink, a kid’s toothbrush was in a glass cup with strawberry flavored toothpaste lying beside it, stickers of fish fastened around the tube to prevent slipping, and towels hung on a rack magicked to keep them warm.
“I don’t really have friends I can stay with,” Jasmine told, straight faced. “Those I mentioned earlier are just classmates. So, I doubt they’d let me stay with them for an extended period.”
Draco kept apologizing to them, ignoring the comments regarding his nonexistent love life. Max and Isabelle wouldn't accept the apologizes until he agreed to go on a date.
This was a reaction he was familiar with, a sort of warning that malicious eyes have been set on him. Trying to be discreet, he slowly took in their surrounding but was unable to spot anything unusual. Only people in the shop were parents with their kids and no one out the window glanced in.
He spent the rest of the trip with cramped legs from the lack of blood flow and watching Thomas' head bob haphazardly with the movement of the vehicle.
“That’s not the point. It’s about manners, if you want to use something that’s not yours you need to ask for permission.”
So, he selected an empty room closest to the center of the manor. The room had already been stripped of all its furnishing and re-painted by Draco a few months back. He had originally planned it to be an office space, but this was the more urgent need.
Jasmine attempted to get Macy to help with the photography but was rejected on the basis that the brunette girl was ‘nobody's assistant’. Thomas refused when the bespectacled girl turned to him before Jasmine could even get a word out. It was Max that told her he’d be her assistant if she needed one. Jasmine preceded to teach him how to operate the device and he’d taken a liking to the act.
Jasmine started asking all sorts of questions about the experience. Thomas even looked impressed. He was not about to let Potter tell them this story.
“This is Uncle Snape, he’s my godfather. Is Max and Mittsy setting the table for our meeting?” Draco said, preventing Isabelle’s attempts to touch Snape’s image.
Merlin, he must have been dead to the world if both Macy and Max were able to climb all over him like that.
They looked like they hadn't seen a shower for weeks.  The boring, Ministry- issued, grey robes were disproportionate for their bodies. The hems of Thomas' trousers were tight on his calves, and Jasmine had to keep shoving her sleeves up her arms.
This letter broke the proverbial camel's back. A viscous anger rose up inside of him. Draco would prove that he can move on; he didn't need them.
“You two really have matching personalities. Oh boy, I don’t think the world can handle two Draco Malfoy's.” Harry said, faking horror at the thought. Thomas’ nose wrinkled at the comparison.
“Now you all go on Mr. Potter and I have some things to discuss. I’ll head in soon, with luck without the interloper.”
It’s been a week since the confrontation with Potter and Draco had been tense every minute of it. He’d half convinced himself that Potter was going to retract his testimony and he will be back in cuffs, waiting for an available cell in Azkaban.
The blonde turned from the fireplace. Blinking away the grey spots in his vision, caused by the light of the fire, as he hurried to his potion’s lab. He threw open the doors of the oak cabinet and with single proficient movement plucked the desired potion from the many glass vials.
Mittsy was ready at the door; holding it open for the group. Draco supposed his life had always been a bit crazy and it from the looks of things it would remain that way.
His feet sunk into the mossy ground, due to a light rain shower that night, as he approached the edge of his property. Tracing a complex design with his wand, Draco cast the spell that would allow him to track the creature.
“Seriously, what do you want from me? If you were so sure of my evilness, then why’d you testify for me?” Draco yelled, throwing his arms in the air.
A/N:  Thank you everyone for all the love for this fic, I really appreciate all of the comments and kudos! Here's chapter 5! I hope you all enjoy, and please let me know what you think.
Max stood off to the side, mud splattered, a victim to Isabelle's movements. He used a hand to keep Teddy behind him to prevent any random flecks of mud from getting on the younger child.
Draco on the other hand was glad that the only sits left were in the back because they'd barely got tickets in time. He was not about to let a stray wave ruin his hair and outfit.
Draco would be the first to say he deserved punishment, but somehow, he’d been given a second chance. Isabelle shouldn’t be condemned for what was out of her control. One as young as her shouldn’t have such sad eyes.
The humidity hit Draco first when they entered the habitat. It like a wall that caused his clothing to stick uncomfortably to his body. He was wearing long sleeved shirt and trousers, an outfit appropriate for England’s weather, but was sorely overdressed for this heat. Thomas was the only one as affected by the drastic change in temperature as Draco. The boy was trying to discreetly fan himself, while the others kept up the same energy as before.
They were once more on the train heading back to Malfoy Manor. Unlike the relaxed atmosphere they'd experienced on the way to London, the air was tense between the six passengers. Every pair of eyes skimmed over the group of people, untrusting.
Draco stepped out of the unfamiliar fireplace, noticing that most surfaces of the large room was covered in dark marble. A single pane of glass made up the entire wall across from him, the only place free of the dark decor. This allowed visitors to look out and admire the beautiful view.
Before Draco could start listing the accusations, starting with the letter A, a laugh rang out. The three adults turn to the owner of the noise and saw Macy's frame shake in mirth.
“There’s always time for sleep.” Thomas grumbled through a yawn, but left the room still wrapped in his comforter.
“I agree. Muggle clothes are designed with different styles and colors. Which means, they can express themselves more thoroughly then with we can with robes,” Macy recited.
“Why, Malfoy I do believe that was a compliment.” Harry smiled as he settled a softly complaining Isabelle by rubbing her back.
Draco continued like this for a good distance, thankful that Max wasn’t too much bigger than Isabelle. Regardless of how light the two felt when he first lifted them, his arms were beginning to burn with the strain. He swore then that he’d start workout his arms more and invest in a stroller after this trip.
Too tired to argue, Macy followed the two to the living room. In the center of the room, before the unlit fireplace was a pile of blankets and pillows. The remaining three members of their group, Max, Jasmine, and Thomas, stood beside it.
Before the war, Draco used to do an hour of yoga a day, even at Hogwarts. He would sneak out after dinner and do his favorite poses in the fresh air at a deserted part of the grounds.
Isabelle pressed her face and hands against the glass, leaving smudges on the otherwise spotless surface. Jasmine pointed into the distance, describing the masterful work of the spells to Thomas and Max who listened attentively to her.
Using the element of surprise. He would push Potter into the door and grab Max and Isabelle. Then, run in the opposite direction before Potter had the chance to kill them off.
Draco wasn’t normally a man of fantastical thought, but he couldn’t help believing that this was his chance to repent for his crimes. He would finally choose the side of the light. An idea began to form before Draco had even decided to start one.
Draco will deny it to his death bed, but he'd read every volume that had found its way into the Manor.
I know it's been years but I was sitting at home bored and remembered this fic. So, here's the next Chapter.
The young girl studied him before deciding she liked what she saw. Wiping tears away and with little delay, she presented her back to Draco. With her back straight and head high the unevenness of the haircut was clearer to see.
That's how Harry ended up surrounded these kids and an ex-death eater, standing in the backyard of a place he has despised since the war. Grass crushed under his feet, legs spread apart and arms wide in the warrior two pose.
With those words, the three teenagers left the group to find a room of their own. Isabelle ran to the room directly to the left of Draco’s, calling out behind her, “I want this room.”
“You two should just kiss already.” Jasmine remarked, chin in one hand using the stroller for support. Despite her earlier words, Macy threw them a thumbs up and even winked at Harry. Both men just ignored them as they continued the trip to the lift.
Luna let them all in the hut, which was bigger than it looked from the outside. The room was lit with a grandiose amount of natural light streaming through the ceiling made entirely of glass. Long tables were organized so every seat had a good view of the small stage at the head of the room.
“Well I haven’t seen you or your brood around recently, so I decided to come check on you all.” Harry replied, hands slipping into his jean pockets and a lazy smile formed.
Draco didn’t understand how muggles could stand such greasy food, although the kids didn’t seem to mind. Thomas scarfed down a slice of pizza that had a layer of grease coating the top and the three girls decided to get burgers and fries that left their fingers sticky and wet. While Draco and Max opted to eat Chinese food, the least greasy option in all the choices.
Jasmine was the first to reach the door and held it open for everyone to enter. Draco began the lecture he'd prepared, “Remember don’t talk to strangers, keep in pairs, and if you get lost find someone with a blue shirt with a large whale on it.”
They stood there watching as the train became a tiny speck in the distance. Glancing at the children, Isabelle was silently crying, eyes still on the spot the train disappeared a hand still waving. Max gaze transfixed on the same place, his bottom lip trapped between his upper and lower teeth. He was once again scratching at his arm.
“Wow! That’s pretty cool.” Thomas commented, giving Draco a narrowed eyed look at the older man’s astonishment at his remark. “What?”
“Now, Mr. Malfoy don’t get snippy with me. I was just about to do just that when this cow of a mother comes storming in demanding justice and wanted to leave the marks as evidence.”
Macy had an identical description as her brother. Once again, Draco signed the dotted line on the next page and continued to the final folder.
“Yes, Kiki. When we were younger, Potter and I fought quite a lot. And one time we both took it a little too far and I was injured, but the important thing is that he apologized right?”
“Her parents are Death Eaters, so she deserves to pay,” a boy replied looking down his nose, pride radiating from him. He paused, awaiting praise for his actions against someone born of evil. There was still so much hatred in this world.
“I wish. But there aren’t any matches happening today, besides the only team I’m supporting this season is the Falmouth Falcons. I have a good feeling this year.” He said, almost like a prayer disregarding the fact they hadn’t made it to the final match in the last ten years.
It was like the feeling that had cropped up the morning the Hogwarts’ letters had arrived. Trying to find the reason for their mood Draco casually prompted, “Speaking of tomorrow, are you all excited to go back to Hogwarts?”
Their route planned, Jasmine said, “If we follow this path, we can visit the most stores in the shortest amount of time.”
The announcement distracted Max long enough for Draco to remove the boy from his back and held him to his chest. It seemed for the moment he wasn’t going to fight Draco.
But the brain is a mysterious organ. So, that one small glance had Harry moving in the opposite direction of his office. Toward the one person who could always be a distraction from his problems - even if it was by causing another problem for Harry.
Thomas rushed outside with his new art supplies to sketch one of the albino peacocks, calling back that he'd take the rest to his room later.
Drawing out his wand, Draco cast a quick timing charm that would notify him when an hour has passed. Polyjuice was particularly fickle potion. Any minuscule change in variables would affect the length of time that the magic would work.
Just based off the number of Potter's ideas that worked out for him, Draco should have realized recklessness was the best tactic.
He spent most of his time in the Manor wandering from one room to another in a daze. Trying to recognize his childhood home from the ruins that were left.
Jasmine was too caught up in reciting the recent studies done at St. Mungo’s about a connection between mutations and magic to notice Thomas and Macy slip away. Draco drifted off, preoccupied by the reptiles, letting the girl's words to fly over his head.
Like Thomas, who’d conveniently forgotten that his school robes were now a couple of inches too short and only mentioned this to Draco four days before the train ride to Hogwarts. Let’s just say that Madam Malkin was not happy about the short notice and he had to give a hefty tip to soothe the ruffled feathers.
“The difference between me and you, Thomas, is that I know my limits, and I know for a fact I’m not good with animals. Not even crups like me.” Draco said matter-of-fact, once his laughter was back under control.
“Of course. I should have known.” He sighed. Draco turned to McGonagall, “There you have it Headmistress. Now, I say punish Crystal and let the kids go to class.”
Returning her book back into its hiding spot, Jasmine stood before the map of the mall. Draco took some time as the girls studied the chart to recover his wits and prepare for the upcoming battle that will be this trip.
The next day, Draco paced in the manor’s living room. There was no reason to wasting energy scuffing up the hardwood floor that morning. Mittsy would have his head for the marks he’d left on the polished floors.
“What were you doing? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?” Draco exclaimed, striding to them. He knelt to check them over for injury.
Draco shook his head at the pleased look that crossed her face as she popped away. That elf was a menace, but it seems much of his family is these days. His foot froze half in his leather boot – Family. It wasn’t a word that he thought would be in his vocabulary again.
“I know Kiki,” Draco said, letting out the breath he was holding, “but please don’t jump on the bed you could fall and hurt yourself, OK?”
The scene could be mistaken for one of the Manor’s moving pictures for all it had changed in the past few days. Although today, Thomas had decided to grace them with his presence; a rare phenomenon to be sure.
Isabelle wanted hers at the head of her bed, while Max had his hung above the desk and dragons (now ordered by tail length). Draco used a strong sticking charm as he placed them in fear that the painting would fall on one of their heads. Before laying down for bed himself, Draco placed his own painting in the center of the wall facing his bed.
“Mittsy, I need you to get Harry Potter and bring him to me.” Draco crouched down to look the house elf in her eyes, “And listen to me very closely here. I don’t care how busy he is. I want you to grab him by the robes and drag him here.”
Soon, the sound of stomping reached their ears, continuing until a soaked Thomas emerged from the doorway. “I’m awake,” he grumbled, unamused.
The statement elicited varying responses from the group of children. Isabelle seemed deaf to everything around her, while Maximus let out a squeak in fright. The older girls turned two identical, indifferent stares onto Draco. The look in those eyes unnerved him. The taller of the five formed an angry scowl and directed a cutting glare at the Director.
“Why does it sound like you’re proud of that?” Thomas muttered, kicking at a rock that rested beside his shoe.
“So, Mr. Humphrey. You’re here on behalf of the Ministry about the children of the unsavory families?” Tally inquired, her high-pitched voice brought Draco out of his spiraling thoughts. Her gaze sharp enough that he quickly checked his occlumency shields.
He felt mentally drained. And the extended time spent in the isolated manor hadn't helped. A persistent gnawing, restlessness built under his skin. He'd hoped going on this impromptu walk would clear his mind and relieve him of cabin-fever.
He used the next few months to renovate the manor. The daunting task helped him power through the fear and despair that threatened to overcome him. Many bad memories were associated with each room. But as the dark artifacts were thrown out, rooms repainted, and furniture replaced, the weight on his chest lightened. Until the manor looked less like a prison and more like a home.
“Me too!” Max said, pushing his painting against Draco’s leg. He then proceeded to sign both of their paintings with a lot more flourish.
Draco hummed at the question, until he processed her words. Max was just getting comfortable when Draco’s rush to sit up dislodging him from the older man’s side. Looking to the tea room, the blonde saw that the sun was beginning to illuminate the room.
“Mittsy can show you the way out.” With that the house elf appeared and with a, “Exit be this way,” the two were gone.
“Draco, you’re someone who appreciates the finer things. Which do you prefer?” Macy asked, modeling off the shoes by turning her body left then right. Both shoes were stylish, one reached mid-calf with no heel. The other boot was ankle-height, with a slight heel.
He just had that revelation this morning, it wasn’t time to cower like before. This was his chance to prove to them that he changed. Picking up the tea cup, Draco hoped that Potter could look past their history to see that.
And so, Max and Isabelle watched the scuffle unfold. Draco trying to free his hand, and Harry trying to calm him down. A tricky twist of his hand broke Potter’s hold, the sudden release had the brush swiping uncontrolled against Potter’s face. A jagged, blue line swept along the man's cheek to his chin.
“Hey, Draco. Check me out!” Steeling himself for what was sure to be something completely absurd, Draco turned.
“Isabelle, we’re leaving.” Draco called out. The little girl ran up to him and complained that she wasn’t done talking to the snake.
Thomas was the next to move toward the blankets. “Well. I need to be on the other edge. My limbs are the longest and I doubt you all want me in the center kicking you.”
The boy clambered out of the tub in answer. The water splashing against its porcelain prison as he did so.
“What about Mr. Potter?” Isabelle said. Seeing that the man was still occupied with his admirers, Draco wrote him off as a lost cause.
Draco laughed, grasped Max’s and Isabelle’s hands and continued walking. “You’re too good of a man Harry.”
It was only when they reached the end of the exhibit, that she finished. Everyone had kept up with the group except for Isabelle, she stood in front of one of the glass panes a few yards back.
Lethargically, the two rose and headed to their rooms to get dressed. Sighing, Draco followed them up.
He couldn't hold back the barking laugh that burst from his chest when he saw what the other man was wearing.
Draco felt the tension in his body drain away. “Thank you, guys. I wasn’t sure how to approach the situation without sending Potter in a rage. That was always something I was good at.” He said, eyes suspiciously wet. He lifted the two children into his arms.
Harry looked back at the four pairs of eyes staring at him, “So, what were you guys up to before I came?”
“Snape, it’s been a while.” The young man greeted, setting aside the parchment. Draco had one of the two portraits of his godfather, the other hung proudly in the headmistress’ office. Severus Snape spent most of his time there at Hogwarts, but every now and then he appeared to berate his godson.
“That’s fine. But I want a Keep Away spell. That girl cannot be near Macy, look or even think about her.”
It’d been quite some time since he had played quidditch and the snitch seemed to be provoking him, causing his body to tense in annoyance.
“The Head Auror agreed that I could do this if I don’t let it affect my work in other cases. So, Malfoy you’re stuck with me as your liaison with the Ministry.” He finishes as he stands up.
The wards erected around the grounds would place a nasty hex on anything that crossed into the property. Discouraging any further wanderers. But that was before the Ministry became concerned of muggles discovering our society.
In a crevasse made by Macy’s trunks were two stowaways. They were crouched, huddled together to take up as little space as possible while remaining hidden. Thomas let out a snort and went to go extract Draco from Macy’s octopus like grip.
Draco needed to find a good Mind Healer, one that could help these kids deal with their unique situations. A Healer that could look pass their parentage. The sound of the office door opening brought him out of his thoughts.
Choking on his pumpkin juice, Draco shook his head as he coughed, “No, we are not going to discuss Potter. In fact, his name or any other aliases of his are forbidden in his house.”
A/N: Here's the fourth chapter, I hope every one enjoyed it and please let me know what you think. My family and I actually had an Uno game that lasted for two hours, and my mom described it as her personal hell so that's for you mom. haha.
“I- Thank you, that means a lot to me.” Jasmine stuttered. Clearing her throat, Jasmine continued saying, “Obviously, I return the sentiment. If any of you need my help, I’ve got your backs.”
“That’s right Jasmine! If you ever need to talk to someone about anything, other than homework, then I’m your gal.” Macy excitedly stated, reaching to grasp the other girl’s hand between her own.
“Well, you haven’t told me your name. I had to call you something,” Draco said, brushing the dirt from his robes. She claimed the older man’s hand and proudly announced, “I’m Isabelle and I’m five years old.”
Macy cheered in excitement. Mouth still filled with toast, she exclaimed, “It’s been forever since I’ve had a true shopping spree. Where are we going, Diagon Alley? Hogsmeade?”
In the wake of this team up, the others admitted defeat, and construction continued until everyone was satisfied with their creation.
Thank you everyone for all the support. Unfortunately, spring break is coming to an end so I won't be able to post as quickly but I am planning on regular updates. Anyway, here's the second chapter. Pleas let me know what you think.
“Of course, of course! Here you are, Mr. Humphrey. All the papers for guardianship are in these files. They're just waiting for your signature and those kids will be your problem,” she states, passing the files over to Draco. He accepted the stack, surprised at how fast she'd relinquished the documents.
The sound of Potter knocking on the wooden door echoed around them. By the time footsteps was heard from within, Draco had already formed a plan of escape.
Macy tucked hers behind an ear before doing the same for Max. Jasmine carefully placed the flower in her pocket planning on pressing it later in a book. Isabelle preferred to keep her rose in hand twisting and twirling it admiring how “pretty” it is.
Harry tisked, “And I didn’t even get your signature. “Then presented his ruined canvas to the blonde.
Draco pursed his lips as much as he was loathed to do anything Potter wanted, he was desperate. If it would help get Max and Isabelle out of the house, then he would do anything.
“Besides, it’s not about what the snake says rather about how rare the magic is to get that skill. It could be an amazing tool to understand the nature of magic that is largely unknown.
Potter’s face was now turning an impressive shade of red, his earlier bravo gone. Draco had spent years studying Potter, but still couldn't understand the way Potter could change from a confident, capable man to a red, stuttering bundle of nerves in an instant. It wasn’t an enduring trait, no really it wasn’t.
The brunette man looked at them with wide eyes. He was pushing along a stroller with a young child within. The child tried their hardest to inspect every aspect of the surroundings, leaning forward as far as the straps would allow.
“Thank you, Isabelle.” Draco ruffled her hair before leaving the room. The lack of footsteps behind him had Draco turning around to call for the young girl. But when she emerged from the room Isabelle was wearing a purple shirt.
The next few hours were spent arranging those photos on bedroom walls according to Max's and Isabelle's exact directions. Other photos would randomly appear throughout the manor in the following days. Each one that now hung had its own intricate frame and enlarged to fill the once bare, lonely walls.
Draco rushed to the kitchen and prepped the kettle for tea. The small tremors of his hands made the task difficult; he clenched them to try to steady himself.
Draco’s lip twitched; this boy would fit right in at the Weasley’s home. The boy refused to look straight at the camera. Instead, his eyes flickered about the room never resting in one place for long. The name on the form read Maximus Jacob Hawkes, seven years old.
“Macy hates our parents for what they did and who they are, but I can’t. I want to! But every time I try all I remember are the birthdays spent together, or my father teaching me to fly, and my mother’s soft voice.” He turned to Draco, his eyes sad and confused.
Now with clean teeth, Isabelle was placed on the bed. The blonde began to smear the ointment over every injury he found on her body.
Draco’s mirth was instantly gone. He wrapped both arms around Max, who was staring at Harry mouth open, and pulled him back in his lap keeping a tight hold on him.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t having a good day. Well, he hadn’t experienced a ‘good day’ in years. Not since The-Dark-Lord-with-No-Nose barged into his life, destroying any future he’d planned. So, he had a valid excuse for his sour mood.
Isabelle was back talking a mile a minute. Max would squeeze Draco's fingers every now and then. Checking to make sure they were still there. Behind him, the beginnings of an argument between the three teens could be heard as the blonde climbed the steps to the entryway.
“You were so brave.” Draco solemnly said, placing a sympathetic hand on Thomas’ shoulder. Shrugging the offending hand from his person, Thomas gave Draco a dirty look. The young man’s facade broke at the look and he began to laugh.
“Yes, I do.” Harry said looking sad, “We may have had a rocky past, but I’ve never hated you enough to want you dead or hurt. And nothing excuses my actions.”
The rest of the kids jumped into action. Macy joined the other teenagers at the pile and began to help dismantle it. Isabelle climbed on the couch, calling out orders for the construction of the bed. Max tested every pillow by squeezing them in his arms in a giant hug and pressing his face into them. Finding the softest pillow of them all, he laid it down at the head of the makeshift bed for his use. Then continued the search so that everyone had a Max-approved pillow.
Then, something burst through the leaves with a loud shriek and swooped at Draco. He ducked down avoiding the sharp talons of an ink- black raven. The animal disappeared into the forest, and he watched as the spell shadowed the creature.
Draco knew he was glaring, but neither seemed to notice. Before the stranger could say anything, Luna stepped onto the small stage and announced the start of the session.
Potter stood there, legs spread. An arm lifted in a flex, he had his face scrunched in the cliché heroic expression. And on his apron was the body of a man, a single leaf was the only thing keeping the image decent. A six pack and bulging quads were painted on the black material, all in all, it was so very absurd.
The ride down into the park was surprisingly bumpy. Draco leaned against the side of the swaying vehicle, eyes squeezed shut and his breath released heavily from his nose. Merlin, they had magic at their fingertips was it so hard to make the ride smoother. Even the thestral carts weren’t this bad.
If that's true many questions arise. Like, what about skills like Parseltongue that are pasted down, obviously there's a magical link. And how about squibs, why don’t they have magic-” The rest of them stood there stunned as Jasmine continued to rant. Her words accelerating the more excited she became.
“Sorry, but the thought of Draco hurting us." More laughter erupted from her. "I’ve seen puppies that were more ferocious. He’s all bark.”
A large brick house adorned with small windows loomed in front of them. Circling the place was an old rickety fence that had its white paint peeling and missing in a few places. Above the door was a sign that read, ‘Orphanage for Wayward Witches and Wizards.’
Her arms were gesturing wildly, and her lips moved. Eyes trained on a large green snake coiled on a branch. It blinked lazily at the child, tongue flicked as it tastes the air.
“But when we spent weeks locked in a room at the Ministry, were we treated with kindness? No! They passed us off to an orphanage, where we were abused by the kids and adults there. The Ministry officials that came to check on us refused to listen to our pleads. They only held scorn and contempt for us, leaving no hope left. So, don’t come here pretending that you care now.”
Max wanted his eye shadow done in bright green and blue which Macy was all too happy complying with. Artfully applying the makeup so it resembled scales.
“When Master Draco be your age, Master Draco be wanting only tomato soup and sandwiches,” she recounted.
He had half a mind to ignore the shout but both Max and Isabelle stopped for the brunette. Potter ran up to them, painting in hand.
“Than that settles it.” Draco says, picking up his fork, “You all will stay here, at least for tonight. If you change your mind later, I can help to find a stable place to live.”
He explained the purpose of the salve to the Ravenclaw, and she covered the few bruises she'd collected at the orphanage with the cream.
While Draco’s muscles were lean, Harry’s were more pronounced. It was evident in the way his robes would tighten with the young Auror's movements. Draco begrudgingly conceited a point to Potter in his mental tally system.
Isabelle climbed on the stool in front of the sink and started to brush her teeth. As she was doing this, Draco used the towel to dry her hair, then proceeded to comb out the tangles.
“Hey what’s that supposed to mean?” Came Macy’s indignant response, as she rubbed the side of her head that he pressed against.
Draco stood there, stunned. The only explanation Draco could think of was accidental magic of a minor. As his initial surprise subsided a feeling of pride and relief replaced it.
What a headline that would make: ‘The youngest Malfoy finally detained, not from war crimes but because some woman wouldn’t stop talking.’
The image of Draco as a puppy, barking, sent Jasmine into her own fits of laughter and Thomas gave out a loud snort. Not wanting to be left out, Isabelle let out a boisterous and fake laugh.
Jasmine accepted hers from the elf, then set it aside disinterested. One would think that the letters had kicked a baby animal with the way Macy looked when the letter was handed to her.
“Like I’d trust you to point a wand at me again, Potter.” Draco snapped, the words draining Harry’s face of all color.
Nothing’s changed about him. The same eyes, same white- blonde hair, same thin face, and sharp nose. Nothings. Different.
“Shut up Thomas!” Macy’s head whipped around to give her brother a furious glare, a hand lifted brandishing a bottle of nail polish in return. But Jasmine’s voice stopped her from going through with the threat.
With a bright red face and loud giggles in the background Harry gets into the correct position. God, Malfoy may be one of the most attractive men he’d ever seen and could have walked straight out of one of his wet dreams, but he was still a git.
Glaring at the Aurors Draco replied, “Did your reports tell you that the oldest of these “Dark wizards” is barely fifteen years old.”
Harry spent the next two hours of his life mindlessly flipping through TV channels. The old, scratchy couch gradually consuming him with each new show that passed the screen.
“I would have appreciated a please somewhere in there, but yes you can use the camera,” Draco huffed.
A struggle ensued when Draco had first presented the clothes to the elf. Mittsy shed many tears that day. All the while, throwing everything within reach at Draco with surprising accuracy.
Thankfully, the journey to the zoo was a simple one, it was only a Floo trip away. Thomas was the first to go through the fireplace.
“Lovegood, nice to see you.” Draco greeted. His eyes now on her face, cheeks growing red in embarrassment for his rudeness.
Snape gave the younger man a pointed look, the two stood there is silence until it dawned on Draco. The blonde's posture drooped.
A whirlwind of emotions ran through Draco as Isabelle said those words- anger, pity, sadness. ‘Death Eater' isn't a name that should be thrown around, let alone an accusation toward a child.
He remembered correctly, the Space Chamber was a department in the Ministry of Magic that dealt with the mysteries of space.
“Crystal has been poking fun of Macy since school started,” Jasmine spoke up. “I thought it was just words, but recently I’ve been seeing marks on her skin. She must of waited until Macy was alone before pushing her around. Coward.” She spat with more venom then Draco thought Jasmine could have.
Her eyes squinted in the sudden light. She brought the steaming cup of tea, wrapped tightly in both hands, closer to her chest.
In a way, Draco knew he was lucky. With Potter’s testimony, he had avoided a permanent stay in Azkaban. In fact, the court hardly gave him a slap on the wrist. And with a life-long sentence in Azkaban, Lucius was no longer the head of house passing the title to his heir.
Draco turned his back on Harry to herd the kids back onto the path. When Harry casually said, “Are you sure you don’t want me to come with, you know just in case you run into a stray hippogriff?”
“It serves you right!” Draco said, head jerking toward Thomas. The teenager was inching behind Draco to use him to block the goat that was encroaching on the boy’s space.
“Draco we're having a tea party do you want to join?” Isabelle asked, already in her tea party attire. A metal tiara sparkled, crookedly on her head matched with a purple tutu, and a feathered boa around her neck. The stranger in the large frame stole her attention.
Unfortunately, Pansy was a huge fan. So, he had been dragged to enough of their concerts to know every word to their older works. And boy, do those songs get stuck in your head.
Each seat had a small easel and canvas prepared. There were bottles of paint scattered on the tables and cups of brushes were provided.
“Get the potion now.” Despite Draco’s rudeness, the healer looked pleased. A vial was already in hand as she directed Macy to a bed and resumed looking over her injuries.
“What the- Potter are you stalking me now?” At Draco’s exclamation, Harry snapped out of his state of shock and back into his natural state of sarcasm that always seems to come out around Draco.
Harry’s eyes, once slits, were now wide taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy. Hair styled, a baggy gray shirt on that revealed his collar bones and a generous portion of his chest. The shirt brushed his upper thighs where it met a pair of tight elastic pants that were tie dyed dark purple and black. To finish it off he was barefoot.
More crying was the only response. Draco tilted his head until the sky was all he could see. He’d never been around children before, let alone a crying one.
“Draco is Latin for dragon. Those nine stars there make up the Draco constellation. It's theorized that the constellation is Laden, the dragon tasked to protect the garden of Hesperides where the golden apples grew. Hera, Queen of the gods, placed him among the stars for his loyalty after Hercules defeated the dragon for his twelve labors. If you look just above Laden’s head, you’ll see Hercules’ foot.”
Draco apparated back to his place, he didn’t even attempt to see if anyone was around. He was in a wizarding area after all.
It was at breakfast when Mittsy came in with an owl perched on her head. In the elf’s hands were a stack of three letters that were addressed to Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy.
Harry was about to answer him, when there was a click over the phone and a soft voice gave a greeting.
Jasmine ruffled their hair, “I’m going to miss you guys. Eat a slice of Mittsy’s cheesecake for me.”
They’d searched the shelves for a while, until Draco spotted Max trying to reach a pair of converses on the top shelf. The left shoe had a rainbow design with a white lace, while its counterpart was white with a rainbow lace and sole.
“When I was born my grandfather, Cygnus Black III, gave me this,” Draco said pulling out an astrolabe pendant. It was old and clearly well loved. The pendent was circular and made with the finest medals, its design was intricate and complex.
They weren't children in the public's eyes. All anyone saw was their parents’ choices. Their kids were something for people to sneer at and blame for their misfortunes. Many Death Eaters sentenced to Azkaban, as demanded by the wizarding world. Still, this did little to satisfy their anger.
The red-headed boy began to once more scratch feverishly at his arm, breaking the skin. Unsure how to calm the boy, Draco told him, “I’m not going to send you there, so stop scratching. It’s making the wound worse.”
“No one is going on a date. I wanted a change.” Draco announces, frustrated with the conversation. Putting a pout on Isabelle’s face.
He was about to give her a harsh scolding, but her smile smothered his anger for the time being. Draco lifted her up, morning his clothes that were beyond repair. Isabelle reached up to smear mud across the man’s cheeks.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.” Harry screeched, launching into the air. He slowly turned to the portrait of Snape inside a wagon that Max pulled. His face pale, a hand clutching the material at his heart.
It felt like a train collided against Draco’s chest at the sight of her green eyes. Ones that shared such similarity with a boy once forced to kneel before him, both pleading for his help. It was one of the few times Draco had made the right choice. A brave decision. And without much more thought he stepped forward.
The once dark room was alighted with points of light surrounding the six people. There was a collective intake of air from the unexpected viewers at the wondrous sight. Draco smiled; it had been too long since he had seen this.
Draco’s eyes roamed the remaining photos before gathering them for future use once he received Max's approval.  The two children headed up the stairs their chosen photos in hand.
A cough, that sounded suspiciously like a laugh, from the brunette suggested that he also saw the same body part as Draco in the clouds. Blushing, Draco lifted his brush to fix it.
Harry was the only one still trying to keep up with the girl, like the Gryffindor he was. His head bobbed in agreement even with the look of bewilderment painted on his face.
He swatted at the annoyance with less force than intended due to sleep-heavy muscles. Quiet giggles sounded after the movement, and the weight on Draco’s back shifted. A loud ‘shhh’ was attempted between the two kids.
produced.  Every shop in Diagon Alley seemed to play their songs on repeat. He could never escape the voice of Myron Wagtail pelting out the words to
He now understood their struggle. His hair was a mess from his fingers running through it, and clothes rumpled from wrangling the five to their destination. It was a miracle that they had made it without him having a mental breakdown.
Green eyes meet green, Harry was surprised by the apathetic look on the girl’s face. Every meeting before the child had always been very cheerful.
“Can you talk more quietly?” he snapped. But, Draco had lost his scare factor, because Isabelle wasn’t deterred by his tone. Not in the slightest, as she continued to smile at him.
That and the sound of Thomas fake gagging got Draco’s attention. He gave Thomas a small shove as he passed by the group to stop the disturbing noises coming from his throat.
Of course, with this prompting, Potter just had to show off. Harsh, hissing sounds emanated from his mouth.
As Draco stared into the flames, Isabelle crossed his mind. It seemed that other kids were punishing those with criminal parents and none of the adults cared enough to put an end to it. Draco hadn’t given a thought to the Death Eater children who were still minors.
“We passed a candy store on the way, maybe they slipped into it without us noticing.’ Jasmine worried, eyes wide.
