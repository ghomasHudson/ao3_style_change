“We’re
"Maybe when we turn 60," Harry mused, "we'll finally be over our different flavours of childhood neglect."
Strong, fuzzy legs wrapped around his thighs. "Well go on, then, Mr Party Leader," Harry whispered, dragging Draco's hips towards him, pressing Draco's erection against him, "ravish me."
“How long were you and Astoria married?” Harry asked, walking into the bathroom and searching for his stuff.
"Who eats the most junk food?"
"Nonsense," Draco said, grinning. "That's impossible, for I am fifty-six now, and clearly much younger than they were."
may wear skirts or slacks but may not show their knees’. So this skirt would be a dress code infraction on me, and likely on any non-cis person, but not on Draco here. Because he is, for all the Ministry’s intents and purposes, a man.”
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's chest. "That too. First on my list is that you didn't warn me about Jasper Andersen's brother in
Harry laughed. "Not innuendo, just, if we're going to keep doing this, I would really like to take this somewhere where you won't be impaling my back on a handle." A pause. "For fuck's sake, why is
"Those aren't even
"When we were here for Lily," Harry said, "I think we were in and out in six hours flat. She came in like a Gryffindor, that's for sure."
. You know I have top marks in our classes, excepting Granger."
“You’re such an ageist. As if young people can’t be in love.”
Fleur smiled. "She wants to get out. Do you mind?"
"Didn't get a chance."
He placed a heavy volume called
“I realise it’s not exactly my place,” Draco said, “but can we circle back to the mayo?”
On Friday night, Hermione asked, “So did you figure out a skatepark to go to? I don’t even know where I’d look it up. I suppose you could Apparate to a Muggle town and then look it up once you get there.”
“Try to simply pause. Simply tell yourself, ‘That may be true, but right now I should focus on on what to have for breakfast.’ Or ‘That may be true, but right now I should grab some mates and go play Quidditch.’ Or ‘That may be true, but right now I should start my Charms essay.’”
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Harry squinted at Draco from behind his glasses. "Yeah, no. You're not. Glad, sure. Proud, a bit. But not happy. Not excited."
“We didn’t imagine the present,” Malfoy said after awhile. “We imagined the past, we imagined the future.”
To be honest, Harry thinks, looking around, he's not sure why he's here. Does he want to be an
? I thought we'd agreed I was to be
Harry smiled. "That happens when you're home with them all the time, eh? When do you go back to work?"
Draco's head snapped up. "Harry."
Hermione pushes Harry out of the way. "Let me do this. Sorry, control freak, I know."
They clean themselves up and gather and arrange their clothes, while the revellers outside the door sing along to "Virtual Insanity."
"Draco…" Harry said, tone full of prodding. "I sense there's a story here. A story backed by a good deal of outrage that should be allowed to flourish into a full-blown Draco rant. Let it out."
It was Draco.
Harry stared at the book, alternating between blank staring and wondering why Penelope was forcing them to go through this ridiculous exercise.
"I'm serious, Dad. You don't have to tell me, whatever. I know I'm your kid and it's a little strange. I'm just saying, I know you—and I'm
"Have you seen Aster smile yet?" Lily asked as they settled down at a table. "I swear, I melted when she smiled at me. I've never felt so special in my whole life."
echo in my head, Potter turns his attention to the wall, trying to leave my brain and memories alone.
Albus nodded aggressively. "We know which spells on that list of Taboo spells probably wouldn't hold up as 'foreign' in the Wiz! You and Lily did all that research on spell etymology. If we use social media to tell people which spells to use, like civil disobedience, we can do direct action! Flood the Ministry with thousands of Taboo violations all at once—make their Taboo completely useless."
Dad, I'm not keeping an owl. Do you know how outdated that is? Not to mention, my girlfriend thinks it's animal abuse and I really can't, okay?") to learn how to successfully Summon the phone off its charger, rather than accidentally Summoning the entire cord and plug or, alternately, causing the phone to shoot towards him but then reach the end of its tether and slam down on the chest of drawers. (It was Albus who'd told him in no uncertain terms that he shouldn't keep the charger directly by the bed because who knew if there were electromagnetic frequencies or something? And how would they know if it could affect the magical core?)
Draco spoke around a lump in his throat. "You have great intuition, Ted. Your intuition is maybe better than ours was, maybe, I—"
"Someday, if you have a kid," Draco continues, "that kid will be the luckiest in the world. They'll be surrounded by so much love and wanting that they'll have to rebel against it. They'll tell their friends, 'Ugh, my dad loves me so much, how am I supposed to even relate to other people when they all have so much trauma and I have this beautiful loving family who showers me with love and affection and being wanted and never expects me to be anything other than who I am?'"
"It's not important."
After the last of their family had finally left through the Floo, Harry and Draco fell bonelessly to the sofa. There wasn't enough room for two grown men, but they didn't care, and they didn't move until Lorraine found them, shaking her head and mumbling about soup, and snapped her fingers, Apparating them to their bed.
"Ow," she says, pressing the palm of her hand against where he had poked, then her eyes fly open in a panic.
"Oh, sorry," the mediwitch replied, clearly embarrassed. "I shouldn't've assumed."
I scan though possible responses to his rodent commentary: silent treatment, ridicule him for not knowing that magical barriers can't keep out non-magical pests (this option is perhaps the most comfortable choice, as taunts related to his Muggleness have been a staple of our dialogue—well, a staple of my remarks, anyway—over the years), make a snide comment about his social status.
She crosses her arms over her chest.
After a long stretch of silence filled only with the sound of their breaths, Harry whispered, "Will they be okay? Will they forgive us?"
"Oh," Harry says, feeling incompetent. "I usually cook like a Muggle—I hadn't thought of that."
Other parts, not so much. His clothes kept disappearing. He wasn't sure when telly-watching was welcomed (Draco
"How about I put you in touch with my friend Blaise? He's my best contact who is a businesswix."
James looked between Harry and Draco. “Did that happen to you two?”
"I know, mate," was all Harry said, quietly, in reply. "I don't have a good answer for any of you. We didn't tell because we thought it was risky to tell, and that it wasn't fair to put that burden on you. I thought it would be better—easier—for you all, if you thought this thing with me and Draco had no political motives."
Harry swatted him away. "Calm down. It's going to be fine. We're just putting on a little show, we can do that. I'm playing Harry Potter, helplessly in love with a blond Slytherin despite all his better instincts."
“Imagine Ron gets a handle on his nightmares,” Harry added.
"Dad," Albus said when Draco'd finished reviewing the effect of Fortunade Lestrange's elopement on the Goblin Rebellion of 1752, "stop working and come watch with us. The only way we'll get through this is by making fun of Rump as a community."
The Dark Lord will want to use me to torture and humiliate my parents. But given what just happened.... I don't think there's any way he will let me live. One can't lie to save Harry Potter and live to tell the tale.
"To be honest," Harry says, "I think the fight just proved that we weren't...in good shape anyway. So it's okay."
"Are you sure?" Harry looks at his tea. "I mean, it's fine if you're not comfortable with it. He was a right arse to you for like an entire decade, and then there was the whole getting-tortured-at-his-house thing. You don't need to be okay about him, just for me."
pay for the Triple M with public Galleons.”
"Indeed I was," Jorgen called apologetically.
I reach for my arm, gasping, trying not to pass out—that happened once, and I was punished accordingly.
“Of course,” she said.
"Miraculous," Malfoy drawls, and all the wonder in his voice is gone, replaced with the usual arrogance. As if it's
"Mi, can I ask you a question? How are you feeling about your parents? Do you want to talk about it?"
“I don’t get paid enough for this,” Robards muttered, then looked up and clapped his hands. “Right. Potter, as per the Code of Conduct, you need to go home and not return until you’re wearing proper footwear. Your pay will be docked. The rest of you—” his eyes travelled warily over the other three, “as you haven’t officially broken any rules, consider this a warning. I will see you following the spirit of the Code from now on, and you can register your complaints with the dress code through the proper channels. Because this
"Excuse me, is it alright if I cut in front of you to wait with my friend here?" Harry asked her.
"Oh come on, according to those books you love, interns and students and beseeching public figures are always fucking powerful people in their offices."
“I didn’t mean—oh, Merlin. I just meant, come back to my place with me and we can talk for a minute before we change into, you know, trousers.”
, and Ginny's eyes snap up and lock with Harry's.
"She maybe deserved part of it," Harry says, wrapping his hands around his nondescript white mug. "I could've been nicer. But she deserved it."
about it, and the country was on their side and headlines about Harry and Draco often bumped Rump below the fold. And really, Draco was a good kisser, too—he was all passion and precision, like he was with everything else in his life, and Harry didn't know how long it had been since he'd had a tongue in his mouth—had it always felt this good? He couldn't really remember. Maybe they should stop kissing. Because he was pretty sure their children were watching, and that was why this entire stag do was meant to be G-rated and safe, not R-rated and featuring rapidly-swelling erections.
awkward. He supposes he has lots of reasons to be awkward around Malfoy; maybe that's the explanation: like, he's been focused on all the other reasons their relationship—not
"Don't wanna talk about it." Harry crowds into Draco's space, making to kiss him again, but Draco shoves him off.
I don't mention how much I've read about the Patronus Charm. I thought, stuck in this house, that if I could learn it, I could protect myself. All I discovered was that I'm too far gone for that type of goodness-infused magic.
tried to throw us under the Knight Bus like that, Hazza. Not cool.” A sheepish look fell over Ron’s made-up face. “And don’t give me crap. You know how...
never on patrol. I'm in charge of the people who would be making the arrests, not one of the feet on the ground, as it were. I don't know. What can the DMLE do? This isn't like the non-Western magic where we can overwhelm the Taboo, making it arguably impossible to enforce Rump's bigotry."
Harry laughed, but it came out like a single burst, an exhale. "Fuck, yes," he said, and Draco, wanting to drive him to distraction, slammed his hips down with purpose. "Ahh," Harry repeated, "yes, so much better that it lasts. And that you know what you're doing. Young people sex is for chumps—You're so fucking good at—" He broke off as Draco did it again, but this time Draco couldn't concentrate on Harry, focused as he was on the barrage of sensations—internal, external, Harry's mouth nipping at his ear.
?" Harry asks. "What would
"You look like a couple of wet cats," Scorpius laughed. "Except covered in soot, not water."
"Hey Harry," she said, squinting at the wall. "I told Ron we should buy the more expensive roller."
Harry searched those silver eyes, trying to figure out what the fuck emotion was going on in Draco's head. But he couldn't reach it. It was something indefinable that Harry could only hope wasn't regret.
"How people end up having so many kids." Draco let his head fall back. "That feeling could get addictive."
Harry looks down at his page. He's meant to be reading something called "The Philosophy of Alchemical Science," but he keeps getting stuck on the word
“Annoying my father was a fringe benefit. Hermione and I have enough privilege to do something like this without too much retribution.”
I use a Severing Charm to cut off a few pieces of Wormtail's clothes so I can Expand them into rat attire. The last thing the world needs is a rat inexpertly Transfigured to look like Harry Potter—
I'm still holding Potter's hand.
“Harry! Harry Potter!” a voice called. “Draco!”
Hermione stuck her wand in her hair and came closer. "What happened?"
"I don't know how it happened; we used charms."
. I don't want to have a husband, either. Or a wife, for that matter. Did you know the word
, but he looks much younger than even Albus.
"I haven't scared you away?" Harry asked.
"Never said it did." She rocks side to side a little. "Doesn't make you any less deserving of love or happiness or whatever, you know?"
Lily grabbed Harry's hand and tugged him out of his seat, the world lurched, and he found himself landing much too roughly on one of Scorpius's thrones. Draco, pushed by Pansy, tumbled next to him a moment later.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You know what I mean, Draco."
Harry snorts. "Deal."
"Really?" Harry said, realising too late that his tone sounded a bit pitying.
It was just the wedding, right? People had bizarre ideas before they took big steps like marriage. Of course he was dreaming of a life with Draco, because he was committing to a life with Draco.
goes into effect today!" The man looked at the sign, then at Harry, then back at the sign—poor bloke clearly had no idea what to do. Harry was his boss. In fact, Harry was his boss's boss's boss.
"What was that?" Harry asked, a cocky grin on his face. Smug bastard. He leaned forward and tugged Draco's hands away from his mouth.
Harry stood, pressed a kiss to Draco's head, squeezed his shoulder. "I feel that way about every choice I made in my life up until about age 40."
Draco picked a truly enormous book—
Harry looked up at the lighting fixture. "It just feels real now, you know? If the kids know, it's real."
Harry frowned. He hoped Lily knew he didn't expect any so-called "accomplishments" from her. He reached across the table, tilting her face towards him. "Hey, what? Of course not! You've done so much, and even if you hadn't, who cares? You don't need to
"Draco," she prodded. "Tell me about your experience taking the potion. Was it what you expected?"
"No, I got that when I was
"It did to get me in bed now," Harry said, raising an eyebrow and then ruining the smirk with a guileless smile.
He has no idea how she's managing to juggle infant care with her grief.
Draco was in a skirt again—this one looked like it’d been Transfigured from a pair of herringbone trousers of Draco’s that Harry recalled. His hair was still long. Beard still—beardy.
Harry dropped into the chair next to Draco. “Sorry about that. You know, you told him to make himself at home and you haven’t once asked him to stop doing these things. If you did, I’m sure he would listen. Aren’t you supposed to be a Slytherin? I always figured Slytherins were awesome at parenting authority.”
"What?"
Draco lunged forward and pressed another heated kiss to Harry’s lips. Harry’s eyes widened and he couldn’t help but let out a moan when Draco ground down on him.
my only hope.
"So then we had to watch MTV Select to cleanse our palates." Hermione gestures him over.
Harry feels like he's been slapped. Apparently they're not. "I know that. I don't think we're my parents. I just thought—I thought you'd
"I forgot the part where you're a really good kisser," Harry whispered, and Draco dramatically covered Aster's ear with his free hand. Harry laughed. "And fit, too."
"Nuh uh," Harry said, shaking his head and nudging Draco. "They picked a
Harry laughed—Draco was messy with his clothes?! How could that be?
"So when do you want to go public?" Harry asked around a mouthful of toast.
. I made the decision I had to make at the time, and I don't regret it. I have enjoyed my work, well enough. Is it the thing I should have done, if I didn't have any constraints on my life and my choices? No. Do I want anyone in the next generation to make that choice for constrained reasons like I did? No."
He pulled the parchment for Penelope out of his pocket and started reading through the alternative thoughts he’d written. But instead of feeling that they were perfectly reasonable alternative thoughts, Harry felt a rush of skepticism and despondence.
"No, not that." Draco sighed. "It feels….I don't know. Hopeless. Ominous. Foreboding. I'm not feeling very optimistic about the people who support Rump. They're not going to change, you know? And then I start questioning humanity—like, I know people can change.
Harry snorts a laugh. "Muggles have this machine thing with beaters that can...do that. Sort of."
far enough from the wall to accommodate my body with my head turned toward Potter, and I find myself sucking in my stomach, trying to prevent my chest or face touching the screen. Potter rushes into place next to me, and we're way, way too close.
"You're welcome. I plan to spend as much as possible on Puddlemere United throw blankets and Gryffindor Alumni furnishings."
I roll my eyes. "Technicalities. Anyway, we can figure something out."
"No," Draco said. "We can't involve anyone. We aren't even telling our children, for fuck's sake."
"What?"
For some reason, the sight of his best friend appearing, ready to help, without being asked had Harry all choked up. He walked over and wrapped her in a tight hug, pressing his face up against her hair.
was that almost anything could break the dress code. His dirty trainers again. Skipping his morning Depilatory Charm. Not changing out of his pyjama bottoms.
"But I didn't want marriage with a lover or partner. It just—there's so much tied up in it. So many expectations. So many ideas about what children owe their families and what spouses owe each other. Like the weight of my ancestors' judgment would be weighing down on me, every portrait from the Manor, somehow exerting influence or judgment on my actions. I don't want to be a
Draco answered only with a level stare.
Draco snorted, and it almost could've been a snore.
Draco didn't fuck with pride.
"I only know how to make chocolate mousse," Draco says.
But then Draco reached out a hand and grasped Harry's bicep—Harry wasn't sure which of them closed the space, but Draco's lips were on his and he was
"Draco, I was fucking joking. You can't have a crystal hammer and sickle. I know it's hard for you to remember, what with your being all…Malfoyish. But that would quite defeat the purpose."
Harry pauses next to the packaged yoghurts and stares at Draco.
“Vitality,” Harry echoed, the meaning of the word not making sense in the moment.
"When have you ever known me to enjoy things that aren’t difficult?" Malfoy asked, and it was Harry's turn to snort.
"Maybe the party will be just what you need," Ron says, putting his feet up on the sofa. "You and Ginny can get past your row, get back together."
James grinned widely. "Whenever you want, Dad! My castle is your castle. I cannot wait to show it to you, and definitely bring your brooms because like I said, it is
"But it makes employers scared to hire!" Draco was getting all worked up now, a red flush creeping up his neck. "They feel like they can't trust anyone to work in their business. It deflates the size of wizarding businesses."
Something tightened in Harry's chest. Not that he cared about being bullied with language that was less mature than what Harry and Malfoy would've thrown at each other in their first year, or that he cared about what Rump thought. But the thought that
Malfoy lets loose a gusty sigh and slides into the seat across from Harry. "Couldn't sleep?"
There was a faint dinging noise as a bright-red envelope appeared in Draco’s inbox.
The witch in between them looked back and forth at them, shuffling the cards in her hands all the while.
"Yeah, I am," Nico said, brightening. "But I need like, a real job. Or at least, that's what my parents say. So it seemed like law school was a good idea."
"So we'd like to invite our guests of honour to centre stage!" Scorpius waved his wand, conjuring two identical thrones.
On the other hand, convincing Ron and Hermione that he and Draco were a couple would be the biggest hurdle of this whole charade, so he had to concede it made sense to get the Snitch flying, as it were.
"Malfoy."
But the Weasleys are coming—all of them, including Ginny, and he hasn't seen her since he left the Burrow. He's seen Ron a bunch, of course, and Ron has continued to talk to him about how Ginny's doing. It's strange. Ron tells him as if he'd asked, as if he were a boyfriend or fancied her. But he doesn't. The information makes him feel antsy—because he's sure Ginny doesn't want him hearing about her through Ron, and because he's not sure he wants to hear about her, either. Not in that way, anyway.
Draco rolled his eyes, but then he leaned forward and met Harry's eyes. "I think the first step is to be seen together in public more often, like this. Until now, we've seen each other often enough, but it's usually in private."
"Hmm? These eggs are divine." Draco finished chewing. "You mean with our relationship?"
"Well," Harry says, covering a snicker, "it's whisk-esque. I've never seen one where the loops are all disorganised like that, but I'm sure it will work just fine." He pats Draco's shoulder in a comfort-in-your-time-of-need sort of way.
tedious.”
Harry bursts out laughing. "Aged in a troll stomach? Like, is the troll dead or alive?"
Potter! My pride!
"Well, it's
Draco, feeling jelly kneed and fluttery stomach about Harry saying that, scoffed. "The stuff of infatuation doesn't a long-term, mature relationship make."
Malfoy squints. After a long moment, "Indeed we did."
Draco elbowed Harry as he passed by with a bowl of Pepper Imps. "I told you," he whispered, "that you weren't giving Nico a chance."
"Hi." He smiles as she wraps him in a hug. "No thanks. I was hoping to talk to Ginny." He winces, hearing what she'll hear—the hope of a reconciliation—the hope of a son-in-law. But he's not responsible for Molly's assumptions, is he?
“Huh?”  Draco removed his hands from his eyes. “Oh, because babies wake up crying. We had Lorraine, so.”
Harry leaned forward, resting on his elbows. "So I'm not freaking you out? I was worried it would upset you."
"Yeah," Harry said with a sigh. "But we've been married for over a year. Haven't we already proven that those words don't have to change anything? Also, for the record, you sound just like Teddy, which you know is a compliment of the highest order coming from me."
"Shit," Draco says.
say, pretty good today! I am making inroads with the Minister's file cabinet."
Harry Potter with a preposterous idea is thrilling and terrifying. I'm almost scared to ask, "What?"
Draco’s eyes widened.
"Sit up, Potter. Don't be dramatic," Draco said, then slumped gracefully into his hand. "The entire world is going up in flames. The LabMags haven't even figured out a way to deal with the ban on foreign magic yet, and now this."
“I wanted to tell you—I’m sorry about that stuff your dad said.”
"I can't believe you're making me listen to this," Harry complained, following Draco into the sitting room. "I was making a point not to."
“Yeah,” Harry said, and it was true. He felt love and happiness and all that stuff. He wasn’t sure he felt those emotions the way he was supposed to—whatever that even meant—but he felt them.
"I didn't fucking ask whether the job was important," Draco said, swinging an arm out dramatically and slamming it into a container of
The Floo roared; Scorpius stepped through. "Dad. Thanks for the stuff, but how on earth do you use this thing?" He held up an inscrutable piece of fabric.
Draco shook his head minutely. "No, we're not—"
"I should take Teddy over there to play soon," Harry mused. "It's been awhile since I've seen Vic and Dominique."
They didn't answer, and it was dark, and Harry kept talking. "He thought I cancelled because I couldn't stomach hanging out with him unless I was high on imagination potion."
Maybe it was strange to look to their sons' relationship as some sort of model, but honestly, this entire thing was so fucked up to begin with, why stop now?
The problem was, while standing next to Malfoy, Harry
"Of what I want or of what you want?" Harry asked.
"I know, but you know how people are about weddings," Albus said, looking for all the world like a world-weary divorcee, as if he hadn't been over the moon about his own wedding just a few years ago. "No photo booths. No matching, Charmed hair."
, he was
Harry bangs his head on the table again. "I hate you."
"Uhhh. More or less. She understands, anyway."
“I know,” Harry said, and Draco smiled.
"Oh for the love of," Harry murmured.
A text from Lily: "Dad, tell me how to fill out an application to transfer to MACUSA. I am not even joking. I can't stay here. I just keep looking at people and thinking, 'you voted for R*mp, didn't you? And you!'" And from Albus, a string of skull emojis.
“That doesn’t matter,” she said with a smile.
Or maybe he was making excuses. Maybe all those things wouldn't stop Harry from talking to Draco if he really wanted to. Maybe Harry was nervous.
Part of me expects Potter to get angry—to shoot away from the opposite wall like a Blasting Curse and tackle me. He doesn't.
. Instead, he sits down on a bench they'd once snogged on. "Gin. I am so, so sorry."
A surprised laugh escaped Harry's mouth. "True. Well, for what it's worth, I like talking with you, whether we're on imagination potions or not. It's easier than with most people."
"Pop!"
"We—I don't know. I'm not upset we broke up. Maybe I should be, but I think it was mostly just...over. I'm not even upset that she had an abortion; Merlin knows I'm too young to be a parent."
Maybe getting with a Slytherin was a good idea, after all.
"I already did," Harry whispers under his breath, as annoyed as Malfoy is. He watches with satisfaction as Malfoy's shoulders stiffen.
"They're going to be here in like three minutes," Harry said. "There's no time."
Draco turned around, smiling widely, arresting Harry with his gaze. "You!" He laughed, tossing the walnuts on the counter behind him. "How are you even real?"
“Not hungry,” Harry said, grabbing a pack of Bertie Botts from the pile of nicked junk food in the centre of the bed.
"Me?"
Harry clings to her, thinking of the cracks in the ceiling of her bedroom. "We're not broken, Gin. We're under construction."
"I'm sorry!" Harry says, still idly thrusting into the air even as he does feel bad about choking Malfoy.
Harry should've figured there was no way his "father-son" chat was going to exclude Scorpius. The two of them had been joined at the hip since their first year at Hogwarts. And it wasn't like Harry had the heart to ask Scorpius to leave—he
Draco wandered back towards the sitting room and picked up his teacup. "Potter, would you do me the favour of Obliviating 'the fifth year girls' dorm writing contest,' which seems to have been at least tangentially about us, from my memory?"
“Harry,” Penelope replied, leaning forward in her leather wingback chair, “I'm not saying that these depressive thoughts you're having are
Harry started laughing—the nervous, unstoppable laugh of the drunk and hopeless. "Sorry. Er, we're so fucked."
She smiles and heads for the door.
"Haz?" Hermione's voice called from far away. "We're upstairs, come on up!"
"After 7 o'clock? After a day of work and innumerable nights with poor sleep?" Draco asked, tone disbelieving, then tutted. "Lorraine!"
, and exclaims with joy.” Draco tapped his fingers on his book. “It’s like Christmas morning.”
Harry hummed noncommittally, pressing his nose into the flesh of Draco's stomach.
Draco's eyes flitted to Harry's hair. "No." His mouth twisted in a mocking smile. "You wouldn't."
Hermione starts to laugh, just a giggle at first and then harder and harder until she's heaving for breath.
"Do we duel naked?"
"I wish you weren't a member of the Orphan Club. It's a shitty club. But I promise I'll always be here to understand, okay? You're going to have it
Hermione's eyes widen. "Oh."
Harry's throat clenches; he's still shocked by reminders of it—of Ginny not talking to him, not treating him like a partner, of a tiny bundle of cells, unwanted. He can't tell Malfoy any of that. He shrugs, trying to look nonchalant. "Grew apart, I guess. Had a fight. I kinda yelled at her...she didn't like that."
"No."
Malfoy nods superciliously. "Don't want to lose your inhibitions around me. Quite right."
Harry laughed. "You two make it look easy," he said, which was kind of a lie but it seemed like an encouraging thing to say.
“Nah,” she said, and smiled. “You’re depressed, but you’re happy sometimes, aren’t you?”
Harry couldn't stop smiling. He smiled all through holding Aster for the first time, as he kept whispering, "Hi!" over and over, in awe. He smiled through hugging Albus perhaps more tightly than he'd ever hugged another human. He smiled through getting choked up over seeing Albus and Scorpius together with the baby. He smiled through the arrival of his other kids and Molly and Arthur and the Greengrasses. (He smiled extra hard when Draco told him that Narcissa and Lucius would not be coming to St Mungo's to meet the baby.) He smiled as he watched Draco become uncharacteristically speechless when holding Aster, and he smiled as he watched Ginny dance around the room with her, singing, for some reason, the White Stripes' "In the Cold, Cold Night."
jeans and
He keeps seeing the angsty face from the music video, he keeps thinking that singer is judging him for how he treated Ginny, that singer thinks Harry should be filled with shame. And maybe Harry
Harry breathed in deeply, noting the smell of Draco, and tried to breathe out his anxiety.
“I forgot you bragged about being a yogi,” Harry said, hoping saying something will make him seem less awkward.
anything—it doesn't mean she'll leave Harry. But you can't reason with anxiety, and Harry needs to distract himself. He needs to listen to Draco blather on about something boring. No, scratch that, he needs to pull Draco's clothes off and suck his dick.
The waiter arrived back at their table. Harry smiled and ordered the crustless quiche and a mocha with whipped cream.
Harry picks up the parchment and looks at it for a moment, then touches it to the flames. Instead of bursting into flame, the letter disappears, the roar of the fire increasing for a moment as it pops out of existence. Or out of this dimension, rather.
Lee scoffed and sat in Draco's armchair, leaving the two of them to sit close to each other on the sofa. "Writing about you could never be a step down. Plus, with this gag order! What's the plan? How are we going to fuck Rump? The only thing Pav told me was that she wants people rooting for your relationship." He paused, his eyes flitting to Draco. "It's a bit…surprising, after all."
"Perhaps we should've done a press release, after all," Draco mused.
want to know what they were doing. The looks on their faces were too similar to the time they made him join a charity date auction.
He looked up to find Harry staring at him, eyes glistening with some unnamed emotion of his own.
Malfoy, face satisfyingly red, lips pressed together in anger, pulled his wand and cast.
"It's about the party we talked about having in a few weeks. You know, the party to celebrate our new flat?"
"No! It was fiction!"
him, exactly. "Yes, well," I say. "I was mid-Crucio. We're both the worst. So I suppose we're even."
"I'd offer to help," Draco said, "but I think we both know we'd just be wasting my time. Besides, you don't need a Potions N.E.W.T."
They kissed chastely for a few seconds, but then Harry couldn't help but let out a small hum of contentment, and Draco pulled back, looked at him, and then dove back in with fervor. Harry snaked his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him closer, and Draco's hands were in his hair, running down his back, resting on the waist of his trousers.
He's dying to see what it does when it meets Teddy.
This was bizarre. Harry wasn't used to comforting anyone who wasn't one of his kids or an employee. And truthfully, he kind of sucked at comforting employees—that balance between empathy and superiority always left Harry feeling awkward. But he couldn't leave Draco spiraling like this.
"What are you talking about?" Harry's face was blank. It was the face Harry wore when he was protecting himself, a face Draco hadn't seen in so long.
“Huh?” Harry asks, confusion marring his juvenile face. “But that’s not—we weren’t—”
A Prophet notification appeared on his screen. "Dennis Creevey, head of the Magical Civil Liberties Union, expresses concerns for the rights of foreign witches and wizards currently residing on British soil, and urges citizens to oppose the implementation of widespread Spell Tracking, arguing it will be used to discriminate against those with non-British magical education."
Something clenched deep in Harry's chest. "Draco."
"This is a new era of shit, isn't it?" Harry asked after a moment of silence.
"The Draught of Pure Imagination," Slughorn enthused. "A lovely little concoction. I may nip a small bit of it for myself, I dare say. Ho ho!"
"Did you
was on the
Harry considered this. Draco's speaking voice was lovely, but he could not carry a tune. Harry however, had always enjoyed a good belt, preferably of When Doves Cry. He raised his own shoe.
“Sometimes,” Harry said, “people tend to overlook things in the very beginning of a relationship. Or think the other person is funny for something that, later, they find annoying.”
“Exactly,” Harry says, leaning forward again, “so let me come snog you. It’s perfectly legal.”
"Poor sods," Draco said, his words at odds with the fond look on his face. Apparently they were going to ignore Astoria's commentary on Draco's parenting.
"I suppose." Draco pushed his grey-blond hair off his face. "This isn't going to hurt Scorpius and Albus, is it? They'll be alright?"
you, you know." It was Ron this time. "Like we do every time, Harry." When Draco looked up, he thought Ron looked old. He looked like he'd been trying to convince Harry of this for fifty years and was wearying of the repetition.
Draco walked out of the room muttering incomprehensibly, then spoke up. "Well come on, then. Let's see what Lorraine's done on the fourth floor, and I'll give you the run-down of things about this house you should know now you're living here."
“I really like your legs,” Draco repeated, meeting Harry’s eyes.
"No one," Harry said as he pressed
Harry laughs, clinging to her. When was the last time he touched someone? "No thanks, but I appreciate the thought." A moment passes. "What would I do without you?"
“Well, she didn’t think it was funny. Lately she thinks nothing
Hermione made a thoughtful “hmm,” while Ron lay in the middle of the bed, looking up into the air where he was writing Charms theorems in the air with his wand.
Draco rolled his eyes and extended his hand. "You're ridiculous. Are you quite certain you're not Confunded? Or concussed?"
about things. I thought we trusted each other. Why wouldn't you even discuss it with me? It's not any old decision. It's a
"No." Harry glanced past the dress robes hanging in the corner under a Levitation Charm. "
Except his children, of course. His children were the perfect exception to the lack of choice that had always defined the rest of Harry's life.
Draco paused his mouth on Harry's neck. "Well spotted."
Malfoy nods as if he knew this all along. "Exactly. See? So be grateful, Potter. You can find someone better."
"Hi," Harry said.
"You're going to eat cake with the sugar spelled out? What will even be left? Just a pile of cocoa powder?"
"I was making it about me," Harry says. "Which, I'm not sure if you've noticed—I tend to do that sometimes."
"What the fucking fuck," Draco whispered.
"Are you going to tell me what you want? Or shall I tell jokes? A hag, a witch, and a goblin walk into a bar."
“It might go down better with some salt and lime,” Harry pointed out, and Malfoy laughed. “What do we do after we drink it?”
Hermione would tell him he definitely shouldn't get a dog.
Robards flicked his wand at the door behind them and crossed his arms over his chest. “Explain.”
"Don't be mean to Radcliff." Potter absently heals a scratch on the rat's paw. "You're better at Transfig than I am, so I'm going to do the dead man, you do the rat. Don't hurt him. Like, make sure he can go back to being a live rat when we're done."
things. It's simpler than that: it's just about love and the work that goes into it."
“Because the Ministry is attempting to encode and enforce a system of binary gender presentation,” Harry said, and watched Hermione breathe a sigh of relief. “And they have no legitimate reason for doing so.”
Harry laughed but it came out as a hiccough. "Thank you," he whispered into her hair. Over Hermione's shoulder, Harry saw Draco staring. His cheeks were red and he didn't seem to be able to look away.
Harry followed Draco’s voice to the breakfast table, where he sat surrounded by newspapers, papers, four giant law books, and a wineglass.
Harry smiles. "Need me to do anything to help get ready?"
At first he thinks it is Albus, come for a surprise visit from Santa Cruz, but no—he’s wearing glasses and the red Christmas joggers Harry’d been wearing this morning, and he has the famous scar. It’s definitely
message. Straight to the point, but sufficiently vague that if it were ever intercepted it couldn't be used against either of them. What did he think Harry would show up in—jeans? Leggings? Of course Harry would dress for business!
Draco remembered the summer Scorpius had wandered around the house listening to a Muggle self-help audiobook in hopes of improving his communication with Albus. They'd been as in love as ever, but they'd had a couple years of long distance while Scorpius was at uni and Albus was getting his teaching certificate. Albus, who was prone to depression, kept withdrawing when he was upset. Scorpius, who was prone to anxiety, kept trying to get Albus to talk more and more so they could resolve the issue. It was the sort of communication problem that was easy enough to fix, if the partners recognised the dynamic. When Scorpius was home (not visiting Albus or cramming for exams or writing his dissertation), he often had a phone Levitating near him, playing the book or podcast or whatever it was. That had been when Draco realised that Scorpius and Albus would last forever—because they put the work in, because it was something they valued.
Draco's head turned towards Harry, as if drawn by a string. When their eyes met, Draco wanted to collapse forward onto Harry's chest, to push Aster aside and cuddle her into his own chest to apologise for stealing her spot, for stealing her Harry, but sorry Aster, Draco needs Harry more right now.
supports it, Draco!"
"Oh, thanks. This is just perfect."
They practice the arms until Hermione deems them passable and unpauses the video. "Alright, try to keep it together this time."
Draco throws his head back and laughs.
Draco leaned closer, over his quiche. "Looks like we're starting to plant the seeds right now. Good. All I'm saying is, yes, it might be difficult to pretend to be in love, especially at first when everyone expects us to be all lovey-dovey. But don't pretend that we're not both excellent catches. No one is making out poorly in this arrangement, and you can't convince me otherwise."
"Are you fucking kidding me?" Harry asks, half laughing, half aghast that Malfoy is treating this as a competition.
weaponise your ties to Harry to hurt him, just because you were hurt by our, our deception." Tears prickled at Draco's eyes and he pushed them away through sheer will. "You
"Starting with the clock, if you please," Wilhelm said, swinging his axe jauntily a few times for good measure. "You need to be careful with the screws in the back—a few are stripped."
“Yes,” she said primly. “It meets the dress code. Anyway, I was wondering if you had made any progress on the PIGIE? I need it for the Rembrandt case.”
Harry grabbed a Quaffle from the shed, then took to the air. He much preferred flying without worrying about a Quaffle, and Ron was a much better Keeper than Harry was scorer, but as Harry flew around the pitch, turning to speed towards Ron’s goal posts, he grinned.
“Digital as in
"What do you mean, Harry?" someone asked.
And it was what he wanted, wasn't it?
Draco, smiling exasperatedly, closes his eyes.
"What?" he splutters, and I grin. "No—no, it isn't! It's gross regardless!
"That's half," Al said. "That means halfway, right?"
Harry winces. He's never been alone with Teddy before. "Er, sure. If you think I'm not going to screw it up?"
"But that's not exactly what I asked," Harry said gently. "I was asking if you thought it was a mistake. Would you do it again, if you were given the chance?"
"And how are Granger and Weasley?" Malfoy asked, looking like he was putting supreme effort into politeness.
"—which makes me realise that you haven't changed a bit! You are just an entitled rich boy, running around making fun of poor kids, talking about your yachts and your real estate investments and undertipping baristas who are probably struggling artists!"
Draco snorted inelegantly, rubbing his eyes. "Yes. I imagine that won't get any better once the baby comes."
is your problem with my aunt? You ran out earlier and I thought maybe you were upset about something else, but now you just acted weird when I mentioned her!"
“I’m sure your profile is plenty banterous,” Harry said, patting James’s hand.
"Oh thank fuck," Draco says, tugging Harry closer, pressing their mouths together and rucking up Harry's shirt, snaking his hands around Harry's back.
But he manages to keep his thoughts to himself. Trying for diplomacy, he says, "You didn't take N.E.W.T.s last year, did you?"
It was a compromise and Harry knew it. "Alright."
“Why not, it’s just an imagining,” Malfoy said. “We’re best friends, because obviously among you, me, Finch-Fletchley, Macmillan, and Hopkins, we’d be best friends.”
. Now."
bite, lads! Indeed she does!"
Harry dreamed that Draco showed up at his flat in the middle of the night wearing a pair of stilettos and climbed into bed saying, “I want you to kiss me so badly, Harry. And if we kissed, it would really be sticking it to the man, wouldn’t it? You like that, don’t you?”
. I'm saying that I cannot be married to you when you agreed to it because of manipulation. Not when I…" He met Harry's eyes. "You're going to force me to say it, aren't you?"
For a moment, they say nothing, holding onto each other as their breathing slows.
tell yourself that, since you're terrible at potion-making." Harry chucks a piece of carrot at him.
He felt guilty about blindsiding them. He'd worked with them for so long; this was his home away from home. But it wasn't like he could've warned them about this plan; he didn't want them to be complicit.
“Oh, keep them,” Draco grinned deviously. “But not for the office.”
Malfoy reached forward and grabbed Harry’s forearm, his eyes alive, and Harry froze. Malfoy was touching him.
"The night Dumbledore died—what did you think was going to happen, with the Vanishing Cabinet? It was clear you didn't think a whole mess of Death Eaters would come through and start shooting curses in the corridors. But—"
Malfoy is still trying to stop coughing, his face all blotchy and his eyes watering. "I have. Not Voldemort. And not like, a particularly satisfying kiss, mind you. Better than kissing Pansy, though."
to do this with you. You're acting like you forced me."
Harry frowned. "What do you mean, messiness?" He didn't particularly like the idea of queer issues being "messy."
Harry thought about it. “Mostly that I’d get out of the cupboard.”
He shrugs. "Sure."
"Hey Wilhelm," Harry said, smiling. "How's life?"
“Cardio!”
“I really couldn’t say,” Draco drawled. “Though I feel confident in his cardiovascular health.”
"Have I been neglecting James and Lily?" Harry asked later, toothbrush hanging out of his mouth and waggling as he spoke.
Draco could do that. He could allow Harry the space to avoid getting flooded. If Scorpius could do it, Draco could.
His new vantage point gave him a better view of Harry, who had thrown his head back, mouth open, eyes closed, lips curled up in an echo of joy. Transfixed on Harry's face, Draco rose and sunk back down. Harry's eyelids fluttered, he exhaled shakily.
Penelope’s eyebrows rose.
"What is oleo?" Harry asked as Malfoy stepped back into the queue in front of him.
“It’s no trouble.” Draco refilled James’s cocoa. Draco, out of James’s sight, pulled his wand and waved it towards the ceiling. “Would you like to go choose a room now?”
"I do not."
For a moment, Draco stared at him with a sort of twinkle in his eye. Then, abruptly, he stood, strode forward, grasped Harry's face between two hands, and kissed him briefly on the lips.
Draco lifted the blankets on the left side of the bed and climbed in. “Is that fine?”
thing I want to talk about. "Don't worry about it, Potter, re—"
Parvati's reaction was more calculating. "You're not shitting us?"
“Nah, I have an idea,” Harry said. “Kreacher!”
He just wants a normal life. He was never able to have it before, and now the war is over. It's his first chance ever to be normal. He wanted to fuck his girlfriend and figure out what to do next and get a house and a crup. Ginny was wrong—he doesn't want to be like his parents. He wants to be like—well, like everyone else. He wants a family. He wants a family who actually talk to him and don't kick him out when they argue.
Malfoy must've been walking fast, because Harry didn't catch up to him and ended up standing in front of the bank. He sighed. He hated going into Gringotts, because every time he walked in, fifteen goblins simultaneously gave him the stink eye.
At this point I make the grave error of looking down at the corpse Potter is trying to bewitch into my likeness.
Malfoy looks at him like he's a moron. "When? What people? I haven't seen anyone but my mother. If I went to Diagon, I'm sure I'd be hit with stones, but I'm smart enough not to do that, so."
Draco sat up. "Is she okay?"
No. At the very least, he has a sense of which options would be a terrible idea. What he knows most of all is that he can't stay at the Burrow. He doesn't belong here. He doesn't belong anywhere.
Harry's face crumples in sympathy. "I don't think so. You alright?"
"My percolator broke. So much for Peck’s Prodigious Percolators being 'permanent and imperishable.'" The words felt stupid as they tumbled out of Harry's mouth. Malfoy stared. "Because," Harry continued, "their jingle. You know."
convenience it would be," Draco said, leaning forward, "if the two of us were married and I ran for Minister, I would win. Without a doubt. And you would be able to pass any reforms you wanted, because I would push it through." Draco frowned. "Well, within reason. I still don't agree with you about the banning of cockatrice hunting on one's private lands."
, because I just went home and Aunt Peggy was there drinking
Draco grinned and held his hands wide. "No questions asked."
“Draco.” When their eyes met, Harry continued, “Come with me. We can go celebrate while we’re changing our clothes.”
Harry turns to Pomfrey and makes a can-you-believe-him gesture.
Potter snorts. "Yeah, you're right, Malfoy. My almost taking a knife for Dobby is exactly the same as you telling your creepy aunt that you
"Merlin, I can see their tongues from all the way over here."
He would make the best of it, even if it wasn’t real. “Let’s go see the otters.”
"Who is a better flyer?"
Aster stared at him with wide eyes.
She kicks both their arses.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “Isn’t the entire purpose of the institution of marriage to force people to have babies? I’m not sure holding off until after forty really goes along with that goal.”
The happiness that had been coursing through Harry for hours reached a crescendo—he laughed against Draco's lips, overflowing with joy. He felt rather than saw Draco's returning smile, then leaned in and deepened the kiss. Draco gasped, pushing Harry against the oven. Draco's chest crowded Harry, one of the knobs poking into Harry's back, but then Draco broke the kiss and pulled his face away.
"Is this an intervention?" Draco asked, aiming for an unimpressed tone but missing, he could tell, by a mile. "I'm not sure anyone realised, but I haven't had a sip of alcohol in
Harry set down his bag and turned to Wilhelm with interest. For months, the woodcutter had been trying to befriend one of Rump's sentient objects. "Wait. He has a sentient file cabinet? But…that would have access to the content of all his files!"
She squeezes. "I know. I just—I barely know what to say." She's quiet for a moment. "It doesn't get any easier, does it?"
"No thanks," Harry said, flashing a brilliant smile. "Sorry I didn't warn you about the dinner guests—they just showed up fifteen minutes ago."
Penelope leaned forward. “Do you think when this school year is over, you’ll have to face some uncomfortable things, no matter what? You won’t be living here or at the Burrow, will you?”
"Harry," Draco says, and his voice has lost all its usual irreverence. "Trust me when I say, and I would know, you do not make people feel unwanted. You give everyone a chance. You give people chances who don't even begin to deserve them."
"Okay," Albus said, running his hands through his hair and tucking it behind his ears. "Okay. This is good. This is good!" He seemed to be trying to convince himself.
"That righteous speech you made was pretty sexy." Harry wrapped a finger in Draco's belt loop. "Very like, David Attenborough documentary—Protective Mate Fends Off Interlopers."
Harry eyed the research littering the desk with distaste, but then gathered his motivation to stand from the sofa and go back to the desk. "Yes. Thank you for your help. This is more important now than ever. Think we can make it binding for Rump—so he can't enact any policies that profile based on magical or ethnic heritage?"
"No, he'll definitely kill me," I confirm.
“Is it overgeneralising, though?” Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Would he use the word ‘inseminate’ that way? Makes you seem like cattle.”
She glanced up from her duck. "Sure."
His throat tightened. "We need to get a divorce."
," Harry said, leaning forward. "That would explain why I like him. Or maybe he is Polyjuiced!"
No. Not that. That they weren't
Harry snorts. Malfoy's right, obviously, and isn't that just the cherry on top of the shit sundae of his life. He doesn't know why he can't stop himself from keeping on talking. It's like the alcohol has put him in oversharing mode. With
Harry’s head snapped up. Draco stood in front of him, arms crossed. Was this meant to be his opening? His chance to make a move?
How dare they make Harry feel this way? How dare they take something brilliant that made Draco act like a jelly-kneed tween and turn it into something awful—without even knowing the whole story? How dare they think they had any right to weigh in on the way Harry and Draco had decided to conduct their lives? To use Harry's enviable, love-filled parenting against him? The anger bubbled up, and Draco felt like a teenager for the second time today and for a totally different reason—because it hadn't been since about 1995 or 1996 that he'd been unable to control a surge of anger.
“Dad!” James called. “Spot me!”
—he's really not in danger."
Harry wrinkled his nose. "Er, you showed up in my house at eight o'clock in the morning with no warning and shouted for me?"
Harry's brow crinkled. "The fuck is a nibling?"
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, then back at Harry, but didn't say anything.
"Nothing, I—everything is good with him! He just—I don't know. We need to make decisions about how much we want our lives to tangle together." She paused, fiddling with her cup. "He's finishing his yoga teacher training, you know, and we both have jobs—are we going to move in together? When he's searching for better jobs, does he apply in other cities or not? Do I consider going with him? It's just—you know. Life."
Lily arrived with her boyfriend Nico, at whom Harry couldn't suppress a bit of an eye roll. The bloke was insufferable, always prattling on about things like gut health and coffee machines. Harry kept thinking Lily would come to her senses. Draco kept telling him that Nico was clearly just nervous, intimidated by his girlfriend's very famous father, but Harry thought this was no excuse for Nico's tedium, especially since Harry was always perfectly nice and welcoming.
Draco's eyebrows rose in surprise.
Malfoy leaned back, a devious smirk on his face. "So you're saying you want to do me?"
He's turned Wormtail's hair white, which has accomplished nothing but making him look elderly. Potter has smoothed out the skin, but that's given it a plastic vibe and caused the eyes to bug out. He's shrunken the nose, but the new nose comes nearly to a point.
"That's fine," Harry replied. "I hate you"
“I asked Penelope that,” Malfoy said. “If we should have a list of things to think or talk about or something. She said ‘you won’t need it.’”
"What did your mum do?" Harry asks as he pushes the door open and continues the walk home, laden with bags of groceries. "When she found you making contraband mousse?"
Harry slumps towards her until his head rests against her shoulder. "I liked it. I like him. I don't know
absolute idiot.
Draco frowned at it. “He must have decided that I am such a disgrace, he needs to go on record against my antics.”
“Vitality. Feeling alive,” she said. “Mental and physical vigour. Feeling lively and animated. Wanting to do things. Wanting to try.”
"Say you'll make it part of the platform to ban magically binding entails," Harry whispered, hot in Draco's ear, his tone like he was saying something dirty—and maybe he was, insofar as corruption was 'dirty'.
" before Harry could say the words.
"Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter," Slughorn said, his little eyes twinkling. "Who knows how the potion works?"
“But the
you! You can’t make someone meditate,” Harry says. “I just don’t understand how you can just accept that you’re going to hiccough for the rest of your life. You’re a wizard! Surely there’s a solution!”
Harry leans closer to her, content in the knowledge that she knows he knows he's being an arse and they don't have to discuss it.
"I'm not living at the Manor, keep up. You were
I jump backward about a foot as the rodent swells to the size of a mutant wombat. "FUCK!"
"I think it was a birthing stool," Scorpius said. Then he stood up straight, his eyes twinkling. "Albus. Al! I think that was a birthing stool!" Scorpius started wiggling his fingers, like the nervous energy had to find a way out of his body.
“Gender!” Draco said. “Gender is a con!”
"Yes," Potter says. "We have a fantastic arsenal here. A button, a mint, a watch, a candy that makes you puke, and dittany. Can you brew us a potion?"
"Well, fucking say it, Draco; I'm making it your place."
Harry wrinkled his nose. "Well yeah, I don't need to label. But I
"Mmmm." Wilhelm spun around on the little circular piece of ground to which he was affixed. "And I made sure not to mention to whom in the Ministry my loyalties belong."
Harry sat back, spreading his arms wide, as if inviting Draco to present an arithmantic proof.
“I think about it all the time,” Malfoy sighed. “It’s probably my most common type of unhelpful thought, according to Penelope. Just constant blame and ‘what ifs.’”
Draco scowled. "Well!" He threw a hand in the air in frustration. "Going to the zoo is fun! Seeing the kids is lovely! Work is….politics is….."
"If you buzzed your hair, it would look darker," Harry observed, stupidly.
Draco snorted, allowing himself a measure of relief that Harry didn't take offense. "I may have swung too far in the opposite direction with Scorpius. Every time he pulled himself to a stand, I would whisper that he didn't have to. Astoria thought I'd gone barmy." He paused. "I suppose I had gone barmy."
"Oh come on! You're no fun."
"What are you talking about?" Harry was excellent at Glamours.
"What—" Draco started.
"Well," Draco said, turning to Harry with an odd look on his face that Harry supposed was meant to look smitten, "it happened at a Ministry function a few months ago."
“Alright then,” Pomfrey says, “we need a non-potion treatment. I haven’t ever encountered this allergy in clinic before, so I need to go consult recent medical literature to see what’s recommended. Give me five minutes or so.” She bustles out of the room.
He tried not to appear like he was watching Malfoy order, but he watched all the same.
One of Malfoy's eyebrows arched, and Harry couldn't help but notice what a nice eyebrow it was—slightly darker than the blond on his head, shapely. "Did you just call me a 'lone ranger'?" Malfoy asked, his voice impossibly posh.
, looking young enough to run afoul of the Restriction Against Underage Magic. “Your magic must be wrong,” Draco says carefully. “Would you like me to review the potion?”
"No!" Harry blinked his eyes open and pushed himself upright. "I'm awake! I'm—"
"Do you enjoy looking at every issue from both sides, no matter your personal opinions about those issues?"
meant to himself. And, well.
“Of course not.”
Harry laughed, rubbing at his forehead. "I was really determined to be a good dad."
Potter, don't throw me in front of the wand like this."
“Oh, shut up. Like me, you don’t want to do the paperwork to start a foundation or some shite.”
Every word she says makes Harry feel like a bigger piece of arse lint. He'd been so caught up in his own shit that day—he'd never really stopped to think about that day from Ginny's perspective. What is
His knees were just knobby. Nothing special. Harry knew that—he wasn’t delusional. He didn't have what people would call "good legs." Except they did, because of who he was.
room. Yes, it's fine. Now read your book. Jasper Anderson is going to enchant you."
The lift dinged for Level Two.
Draco’s lips curled up in a small smile. He didn’t draw attention to himself, just looked privately pleased.
It's a writhing mass of bodies, and Harry overhears at least four people lament how they hate this song, but Harry can't bring himself to hate a song. A few months ago he thought he'd be dead by now. And life might be sucking of late. But not because of a band called Chumbawamba.
. I'm attracted to all sorts of people. Usually people who don't care what people think of them. And since you are literally a politician and your job is to care about what people think of you, that may be a struggle for me."
Draco opened the cherries and poured a small pile onto the chopping block. He scowled at one that still had a pit attached, partially dislodged by whatever process was used to de-stone cherries for sale. He shot an Evanesco at the offending pit, but used too much force—the entire pile of cherries disappeared. "Fuck!"
for flying." He turned, looking around the room for a moment, and then spun back towards them. "I am so fucking excited! This is like, so
Draco groaned. “Not safe from the pap even at a Muggle zoo.”
"Teddy," Draco said. "Teddy," but then dissolved into laughter. "Why did you make us so drunk? Why aren't you so drunk?"
"I always do," Harry said, and made sure his office door had closed and warded behind him before walking briskly to the DMLE's Restricted Apparition Point. He was shown to the head of the queue (a pomp he hated, but no one wanted to wait in a queue with their boss, anyway), turned, and landed in one of the available stalls in Diagon's busy Apparition area. He walked quickly out of the way, not wanting to get trampled by the next arrival. Sure enough, no sooner than had he walked forward, a man wearing chartreuse robes appeared where he'd been.
Harry pressed his lips together, determined not to talk to Malfoy anymore, if that’s what he wanted.
are you wearing?"
"Why don't you grab what you need for tonight," Draco said eventually, "and we can have Lorraine move the rest of your things in the morning?"
“What about you, Potter?” Malfoy asked. “After school.”
Hermione and Ron were already in bed, Ron reading a graphic novel called
"Me too—yes—I'm in love with you. I'm not sure since when. It happened when I wasn't looking, if that makes sense. I don't want to stop being together. It felt like shit to hear you say you want to get divorced."
Malfoy's smile faded as he leaned back on his hands. "You said a few weeks ago that you can't believe that I can really be better." He paused. "I will never be perfect. Maybe I'll never be good enough to satisfy your Gryffindor morality. But I am already
Draco leaned forward and hissed, "I am allowed to want good things for people I care about. That doesn't make me a snob."
"Yes, please join us," Malfoy urges—stiff but genuine.
doing—Voldemort sometimes…sometimes I could see what he saw. And sometimes what he saw was you."
Harry hooted, raising his trainer again, and the crowd erupted into laughter.
Harry jogs into the bedroom, returning empty-handed a moment later. "And I went to see Teddy the other day, and I was thinking you could come with me next time, if you want? Because you're right, he's my family now, he and Andromeda, and they're your family too, kind of. It's weird, and I'm totally not okay with it, but I will be."
Harry refused to get into specifics about the war, but he couldn't stop seeing the image of a young, scared Draco refusing to identify him at the Manor. Of Draco unable to kill Dumbledore. He may have been an arsehole, but he did more than anyone who hid in their homes. He understood in a way others didn't—that wasn't a lie.
"Sounds perfect," Draco said.
Harry laughed but tried to keep it silent, which resulted in his face going delightfully red. He waved his hand to rotate the floating book.
As Teddy made for  the kitchen, Harry only just suppressed a dramatic groan. It wasn't a great feeling to have no idea what you want, but to have everyone around you think you know
"He's pretty private these days, Harry," Bill said, setting his cup on the table. "He has to be, I think, what with the way people treat him because of the war. I'd just leave him alone, if I were you."
Harry dropped heavily into the seat next to Draco. "If we're getting married, I need to be honest with you about something."
She grabs a sweater off of a hook—it looks like one of Arthur's cardigans, it comes down to her knees—and leads the way outside.
"How dare—"
Draco quickly leans over the book. "It says put the letter in the flames. Nothing special."
Hermione snorts.
"So are you going to tell me what happened with Ginny?" she asks, never looking up from her puzzle. "Also, 'body part prone to profanity,' ten letters?"
why he’d stopped—his kids didn’t want to do those things with him anymore.
how he'd conducted his Auror career, much to the chagrin of his various bosses. "Yes." He thought for a moment. "Actually, I think that's how I killed Voldemort, too."
It was a piece of art that said
"He does not!" Harry claimed, laughing. "Trust me!" After a moment, he added, "You know, maybe I think he fancies you because
"Wait, what do you mean 'at a Ministry function'?" James asked loudly, almost bouncing in his seat. "You're not saying you hooked up at the
"Because I've been so involved with Aster and helping out Albus and Scorp." Harry paused to spit into the sink. "I mean, they don't deserve less of my attention just because they don't have a baby."
She huffs a small laugh, and Harry feels the ice between them thaw a bit.
After all that, he says nothing.
"Take my word for it—where the entail is concerned, it's better to go along with it. If you ever come into possession of a bunch of their money, you can always donate it."
Malfoy in his brain somehow didn't feel incredibly intrusive, even though Harry was not Occluding at all (and was rubbish at it anyway), and Harry's thoughts about playground taunts brought to the forefront of his mind an image of Malfoy on a broom with Neville's Remembrall, which then changed into an image of Malfoy on a broom in front of Fiendfyre, which then changed into an image of Malfoy looking despondent at his trial, which then turned into an image of Harry's eyes being drawn to Malfoy at a Ministry event, which then changed into an image of Malfoy flirting with Harry over coffee just the day before.
“That’s true,” Malfoy responded. “Better to stick with each other, because at least we understand why we can’t stop talking and coming up with crazy ideas about skateboards.”
Draco grinned. "But who can say if it is a position or not? We will merely be discussing our personal lives."
"Hippogriff holidays?"
"How do we keep them from seeing us when they first come in?" I look around, but we're running out of things to Transfigure. "Can we try to Transfigure that paper into some kind of screen, like to blend in with the wall, blocking us?"
"I thought you hated 'Pop'," Harry said, his voice tinged with glee.
But it feels natural. It all feels natural with Draco. Harry's not embarrassed to be naked with him. He's not awkward about sex (well, maybe he's a little awkward, but like, a normal amount). He doesn't feel strange about being naked with Draco
"Potter."
No need to look so violated."
Author's Note, 24 December 2020: I had so hoped to get this chapter done earlier, but turns out that facilitating remote learning for two kids is like, a lot of work? On the bright side, we get a Christmassy chapter right at Christmas. Hope you're well! Merry Christmas, happy holidays, happy new year!
Malfoy's shoulder hitches up. "I suppose not. I didn't
Draco scoffed. "Harry, you saved the world when you were one and again when you were seventeen. I'm pretty sure we can handle anything too."
"I want," Draco started. "I want better for you."
"Harry Potter," he spat (he always spat, so Harry didn't take that particular factor personally), "what the
Ginny patted him stoutly on the shoulder and smiled. "You succeeded."
was what he wanted. Wasn't it?
"You're right." Draco dragged a hand through his hair, then looked away from his work. He stood, reaching for the baby. "My turn."
“What type of ‘incident’?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
The rat is crouched in the corner, facing away from the door, eating the shirt I made it, and doesn't respond.
Lily sighed, then quickly moved on to discuss a new charm she was developing—it was meant to Vanish pollutants from waterways, though she was struggling to get the charm to target contaminated sediment as well as contaminants in the water.
Malfoy suddenly looks like his father—supremely unimpressed. He looks down his nose and says, "Don't be preposterous; faux humility is unbecoming."
“Draco, get your arse down, that’s cheating.”
He closes his eyes, hand still on the wall, so I mirror him, trying to visualise magic—both my own, happily circulating in my core, and the magic around me. I've never been very good at it, to my mother's dismay. According to her, the problem is too many thoughts in my head to be able to concentrate properly. According to my father, it's a lack of strength and discipline.
Harry scrubbed his face with his hand. "That is—they—that's like, a
"I'm getting there." Harry shrugs. "To be honest, I cried a lot."
“Maybe you should get a pet flamingo and feed it food without that pink coloring, so you could have an albino flamingo,” Harry suggested, watching as a little one tripped on a rock. “One-up your parents.”
“Seriously, Harry, I’ll let you read the letter yourself.”
Draco pulls away. "Can we be one hundred percent clear with each other, here, Potter, since we're apparently doing this whole honesty thing?"
Draco looked up, surprised, and blew out a big puff of air, his fine hair billowing off his forehead. “I don’t know—I loved her. It felt like, I don’t know. Exciting. Being an adult, fulfilling my role. Sex whenever we wanted. Felt like the future was ours to take.” He paused, pulling off his trousers. “I thought it would be a new beginning.”
They sat in complete silence—Harry kept looking at the door, wondering which of the rest of the eighth years would be wandering in to join their den of depression—until Penelope came in.
"Oh sweet Merlin," Harry said. "I will just go. Give me my sugary coffee—what did you call it, a death drink?—and I'll just go."
"Oaths of fealty," the wanker says. "Kissing of shoes. An ode composed on the topic of 'Draco was right'."
Lorraine popped into the kitchen. "Yes, master?"
Draco looked miffed as Harry wandered to the closet to dress. A few minutes later, Harry turned, holding his hands out. "Is this good? Do I look like Concerned Father Harry?"
Harry dropped his head dramatically into his hand, looking away from the chaos of his progeny. He heard Draco laugh, then froze when Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder, rubbing it back and forth like a lover would do to provide comfort. To provide somewhat
“Let’s go to the zoo,” Harry ventured, knowing as soon as he said it that he’d chosen the perfect activity. Outdoors, entertaining, Muggle, snacks. It would take them hours to see all the animals. “Have you ever been to the zoo?”
“Hey,” Malfoy said with a sigh. “I know I never really said this out loud, but I’m glad you won. I realised that too late. But. And you did well. I didn’t mean ‘wonder about how the war could’ve gone differently’ like that. I meant like, what if other people hadn’t been fucking idiots, not that you should’ve done anything differently.”
"Do you want him to lose? Or did you just, you know, commit treason by accident?"
a lot of the time. But since you've been promoted? Tell me you haven't hated it, consistently, since it started."
"What we need your advice on is this," he said carefully. "Harry and I are…romantically entangled."
Harry laughed. "Don't read into it, Draco. Maybe I was just really horny back then. I'm pretty content these days. But if you were to ask me what sex I
Harry pulled himself out of the circle of Draco's arms and raised an eyebrow. "I
Draco nodded, face unreadable. “On the contrary. It’s exactly what I signed up for.” He walked upstairs.
"What happened?" Ginny asked.
They stood in silence, watching them for a minute. Some of them stepped their long legs carefully through the water and pecked their peaks, looking for fish. Others stood on one leg and picked at their feathers with their beak, grooming.
"This is perfect!" Harry enthused. "You're a shoo-in for the nomination."
Draco hummed in agreement as he reached for one of the keto snacks Lorraine had prepared for him. "At least we don't feel bad about muting him." He turned to look at Harry. "What are you working on? It must be important."
wearing a pair of red boxer briefs, and he refused to let Draco shame him. "I've been trying to find my jeans for the better part of an hour. But apparently none of my children or employees can do anything without help from me and I keep getting interrupted." He shot what he hoped was a meaningful glance at Draco, who was, he hoped Draco realised,
All of which was to say that it had been a nightmare for Harry, who thought York was an incompetent prick, but who couldn't act as if he wasn't supporting his subordinates even as he attempted to update departmental training and policies to make sure that foreign spells weren't treated as automatically suspicious. The MLEOs were nervous because they didn't like being near people who were casting incomprehensible spells—it made them jumpy, and unlike their Auror counterparts, they weren't highly trained enough to recognise the quality of spells (Dark or not) by the magical aura alone.
He finds room 107, opens the door, and freezes.
"And almost half of the people in this country approve of this clown," Harry said, shaking his head. "I can't…" He trailed off.
"Infraction of 14 Ministry Code § 340," Draco said. "The Ministry and its operatives shall not discriminate in hiring and personnel on the basis of blood status, ethnicity, gender—"
"I always wanted to go to the magical hot springs in Finland."
"I'm stepping through the door," Draco said, leaning toward Lily in a gentle challenge. "And I'm floating in a most peculiar way, and the stars look very different today."
Harry found himself at a loss for words. He’d thought he’d worked through his childhood zoo issues. He’d been here so many times as an adult, without the abuse of the Dursleys. He had so many wonderful memories here, so many trips with his kids.
"No, no, no. The rule is you have to use Wingardium."
"Alright," Draco replied easily, but he started unbuttoning his shirt.
"He's too vain to kill you in a cellar." I'm not sure why I'm voicing this particular thought, though it's true. "So, there's that. You'll probably die upstairs."
"Of course!" Lorraine disappeared behind a cabinet door almost as soon as she said it, bustling around for ingredients.
Under the text was a photo that Harry seemed to have taken by propping the phone at his shoulder and aiming down—it showed his body stretched out on the sofa, Aster asleep on his chest. Her little mouth hung open, a drop of drool suspended at the place where her lips met her plump cheek.
"That has nothing to do with this!" Ron cries, one long arm flying up in a wild gesture. "
After a moment, three dots appeared to indicate Draco's impending message. "Beautiful; see you then."
, either, you know? And then I've got this baby godson, and he's so small and perfect and the world is going to ruin him, because that's what the world does, right? And I feel like, there's no way I can protect him. How can I make him feel wanted, when he has no parents? When his parents left him home to fight in a war? And then I think, forget Teddy—how do I keep living if I feel like I don't belong anywhere? How can I live, knowing that a baby that I made was so unwanted that it doesn't exist anymore—the like, intensity of the unwanting made it
"Course not," Harry said with a smile. He loved holding Weasley babies. Fleur unhooked the sling and handed Dominique to Harry.
Harry could've used a childhood with more fairy tales.
That was the other thing: Harry kept thinking about how there would be a baby at Christmas next year. He wasn't allowed to discuss it, of course, because Albus and Scorpius were so adamant about not jinxing the adoption. Still, the thought was putting an extra bounce in his step. Harry
Ron starts talking about inviting people from their old Quidditch team—apparently Angelina lives nearby—but Harry's not listening. What a nightmare. If they invite Cho, all the people Harry's ever had an awkward sexual encounter with will be in the same room together.
“Oh really?” Harry asks, and Draco can feel Harry’s cheek against his, but it’s all wrong—not enough facial hair, too soft.
A piercing alarm and a posh voice grumbling softly (“Wanking cuntbag”) jolted Harry out of sleep.
He tried to resume working on his policy paper, but he couldn't help watching the antics of the others. Draco couldn't find the news-hologram spell password. (There were different passwords for different broadcasts, so you could be sure your spell would bring up the right hologram. This had become necessary after people started accidentally projecting porn holograms into their sitting rooms.) Draco griped for a bit about not being able to easily find the password on the Prophet app, and Albus muttered to Scorpius that they would've come prepared if they'd known Draco didn't have it under control. Scorpius eventually found the password and they began the holographic broadcast after some of the (unpleasant) pleasantries had passed.
The crustless quiche? That sounded nowhere near as good as a muffin, but now that Harry had asked, he felt he ought to eat something healthier.
It was just that—it felt like this wasn't part of the deal. It felt like it wasn't fair to Draco, somehow. Harry had agreed to get married for political reasons. Everything they were doing was to that end. Neither he nor Draco had signed on for dreams about laughing in bed, a lover slowly undulating on top of them—
"The boys are freaking out so much, you'd think it was their bodies being ripped apart," Ginny said, a fond twinkle in her eyes.
"But honestly, you can tell me the truth. I can handle it. I won't necessarily change my life because of what you say, but I can handle the truth—so really, you're okay?" Harry looked imploringly at Albus.
Draco raised an eyebrow in his usual, teasing way, though he looked a bit taken aback. "Hah. Right. Well. We'll just, er." He pointed at the sitting room, and Harry laughed, unaccustomed to seeing Draco so wrong-footed.
Draco lets himself fall heavily on top of Harry, pushing the air out of Harry's lungs and then, before Harry realises what's happening, rolling their hips together. "Maybe we did," Draco whispers, his head tucking into the crook of Harry's neck as Harry moans.
reason. Yes. A total mystery.”
Draco sighed. "Yes, I suppose. I'm wondering if it will make people think I'm too eager. Like a terrier. A solicitor terrier."
"Wren switched our coffees," Harry said bluntly, thrusting the cup out towards Malfoy. "Well, she switched our
Harry could tell Ginny was joking, but Scorpius's head snapped up, concerned. "Oh, don't feel slighted. Her middle name is Irene, for the goddess of peace. That's for you and Harry, of course, for the war. And for her bio mum, who was so brave."
"What about them?" Hermione asked.
, raised a hand to cover his eyes.
Malfoy sighed, and somehow his eyes flashed with hurt but his mouth retained the shape of amusement. “Penelope would say you’re suffering from unhelpful thinking. What were the logical errors she taught us? All or nothing thinking. Jumping to conclusions. You should come up with an alternative thought.”
Draco stared at him, bewildered and confused. "I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about."
Harry snorted, standing and wandering into the kitchen. He was thirsty; the air in St Mungo's was awful. He grabbed a glass. "How exactly would that work?"
Harry’s face melts into empathy. “Ugh, me too. I like to pretend that people don’t remember me as the half-starved, clueless, neglected orphan.”
Harry, annoyed, left his search—again—and marched downstairs. When he got to the breakfast area, Draco was sitting at the table reading something, wand pointed at his throat as if in preparation to deafen Harry again.
Draco nodded. "Well, the rumour is that the Minister's office has, wait for it," he paused for effect, "blockaded the Love Room."
Astoria smiled, but Harry noticed that she and Draco didn't act quite as familiar with each other as he and Ginny still did. If there was one thing he'd learned about divorce, it was that it played out differently with every couple.
Harry raises an eyebrow.
"Fuck you."
Harry pushed up onto his elbows. Draco was staring into a mirror, adjusting his collar. "What the fuck does that matter? You can't
Hermione and Draco, in contrast, had petitioned to
"And you know what the best part is?"
Wilhelm frowned, his ginger wooden eyebrows slanting inward. "Is everything alright, Harry? You don't usually leave right away, if you don't mind my saying. And you forbid me alerting you early enough to ensure your punctuality."
Unable to keep the amusement out of his voice, Harry said, “I, er, never usually hear you curse like this.” Harry reached out and gave Draco’s shoulder a little shake to help him wake up.
"Oh my fucking, fucking fuck," Harry mumbles, trying to keep himself under control, but his arms are shaking and he's trying so hard not to drop his weight and choke Malfoy, but Malfoy
"I love you, Tedd-o."
Harry doesn't know what to say to that. Dreams that they're back in the war are the worst. But also, Malfoy was on the very obviously wrong side and should've made different choices, so. "Sorry you're dreaming that."
Catching Draco's eyes during those moments made Harry feel…something. Known? Not alone? Something.
"What?"
Harry nodded.
“Okay, so the answer is no, you haven’t been to the regular zoo.”
"Here," Harry said, holding out the bottles. "Do I look okay?"
"Come on, what is it? Like, five shots of decaf espresso with foam, extra hot, and a dash of cinnamon?"
Harry thought maybe that wasn’t entirely true—if there were any other child enemies turned in-laws turned fake-spouses out there.
Harry sat on the sofa. "It's all done. Lorraine took my stuff up. But forget that, what did Rump do?"
Was that true? Harry tried to think of an exception. "Our kids are pretty lovely."
Harry sighs. "Pretty much everything. But only because my aunt forced me to cook, so I don't particularly enjoy cooking for other people. It makes me feel like a slave. I like cooking for myself okay, I guess. It's just practical. Do you fancy a meat pie?"
Harry smiled—glad the tiredness hadn't stolen their senses of humor. "Has she taken
“What about you, Potter?” Malfoy asked. “If you imagine your best future, what is it? A garden wedding to a ginger bride, a bunch of mini-Saviours? Or do you have a thing with Granger and the other Weasley now? Rumour has it you three always sleep together.”
screamed the Prophet app.
"Well that's simple, then," Harry said. "I want it. I'm happy. I'm happier now than when I was living alone. Are
Harry felt like he was constantly in public, always 'on'. He looked down at his knobby knees. He simply couldn't be 'on' all the time.
"What?"
Harry raised an eyebrow, realising a moment too late that Malfoy was almost definitely doing the same thing from where he was seated on Harry’s right.
"Okay," Harry agreed.
Harry grabs Malfoy's shoulders, pulling him away from his antics.
Malfoy's head spun around. "Are you actually upset with me for trying to be polite?"
Draco gasped with some drama. “How dare you. They’re perfect.”
"Oh, I couldn't possibly," Harry said. "I'm sorry!"
"Okay, okay," Lily said, getting her laughter under control. "We'll stop taking the piss, Al."
Ron grinned apologetically. “No. We never
"Completely separate storeys of the house," Harry said, deflating into his chair. "And I'm not eating that fucking keto diet. And we can't have any un-unionised elves."
jelly kneed and fluttery stomach, and he couldn't even pretend otherwise, and somehow it was as wonderful and energising as it felt silly and juvenile.
"She's good. We read some books and I watched her try to crawl for a while. She's
Jamiroquai has ended by the time Harry opens the door, and a piano melody starts up as he walks into the hallway.
Watching Hermione's face as she takes in Malfoy's response, Harry relaxes; he wants to cheer. Once he's convinced Malfoy is passing Hermione's test, he realises he's not sure what Malfoy's talking about. "Wait," Harry says, "what's personal fiction?"
"No," Draco said, leaning in and smiling at Aster. He glanced over his shoulder at Harry. "She's named for both."
“Why not?” Harry asked, and even as he said it he could think of a million answers to that question.
It's strange—Potter is everywhere. My entire being is eclipsed by him, and it's making me dangerously likely to dredge up memories of him that I don't want to share. I recite the ingredients of Wiggenweld Potion, giving my consciousness something to do. It won't keep him from seeing any memories, but it will, hopefully, prevent me from handing them to him.
"You've
I stick out my tongue like I'm eleven again, and I don't even care. After a minute, I muse, "I don't think they'll be able to come in here without removing the wards. The magic they did is probably preventing anything in or out, including them."
"Father," I say, trying to buy Potter a moment to Apparate the fuck out of here. But the rat is racing toward my father, and he slashes his wand, cutting a slice down the rat's cheek.
Turns out that Hermione had somehow applied to the London School of Economics law programme while they were on the run last year. Harry still hasn't got a clear answer from her about how she managed to do this. The idea that he might have applied to school in that fucking tent is so preposterous that Harry can't wrap his head around the fact that she did it. But then, he can. Hermione's going to change the world.
He doesn't know what to say. "I'm not—I'm not saying I didn't want to discuss...that. I'm saying it feels like shit that you did it without consulting me."
"Fine," Harry said, munching a chip. "You're fit enough for an old man; I'll give you that."
"Oof. My stomach. Watch it, Draco."
"And what the fuck is that?"
"What is going on? Draco, why are you here? Watching Backstreet Boys with Hermione?"
Draco groaned, then decided to play along. "Alright, Mr Potter, here's what I can offer: I can offer you and Deputy Leader Granger time to present your case to the party leadership. I can make sure the leadership takes the proposal seriously. However, I must tell you that I do not think it is a
Albus was turning away and cutting off the connection as he said, "Love you, too" and Scorpius called, "Bye, Dad Two!"
Harry let his head drop to the table. "I hadn't even thought about the Triple M."
Draco sighed. "That's certainly true." He waved his wand and a desk appeared behind the sofa. "If you need to keep working."
Harry walked through Diagon Alley, looking for the new coffee shop everyone kept talking about. He didn't really care about keeping up with new trends, but he did love coffee, and his Peck’s Prodigious Percolator had broken the day before. Plus, he'd already had one too many, "What?! You've never been to Azure Cup?!" reactions when he informed people he hadn't yet been, so it was a perfect time to try it.
Harry hobbled to the fireplace, rubbing his leg. "Al? What do you need?"
call it?"
Draco smelled like Mysteries. The department, not the concept. Level 9 and the Courtroom under it always had this smell like unusual magic, the ocean, whiffs of Amortentia. Harry could never be sure exactly what it smelled like.
The next week, Hermione's doing a crossword while Harry pulls his hair out reading a bunch of forms and brochures the Royal Academy of Magic sent over.
“Excuse me,” Draco drawled, a dangerous edge to his tone. “Are you suggesting that you would blame someone for having an appearance that others find distracting? Because that seems sexist, homophobic, and transphobic, and is probably a bunch of other -phobics, too.”
better now. It's just that better than actual hell can still be total shit."
"Hey, Hermione. Er, Malfoy is here."
Harry's mouth twitched up. "Nice try. We're talking about you two."
And he can't even apologise to Ginny, because he's so convinced he wasn't wrong. She
"I've never written a business plan," Draco said slowly. "But I assume you need to consider the costs, marketing, sets of goals for each of a series of time frames, at what point you project the venture becoming profitable." He paused. "Market research, probably. Showing why there's a need for your product and why you expect it would be successful."
"Mr Potter," Malfoy's solicitor says, "please inform the Court of your whereabouts at the time of Albus Dumbledore's death."
"I keep thinking about the baby," Harry says. "I don't know why I can't force myself to stop."
Or had he subconsciously wanted Malfoy to be thinking about that night?
Potter turns. My aching body is forced into nothingness. Pressure.
Lee walked into the room with Lorraine. He wore his hair in long dreads; he had a denim waistcoat overtop a purple shirt—on anyone else it would've looked ridiculous, but Lee pulled off everything he did through sheer confidence.
"What?" Harry said. "No! I just ran into him at Azure Cup—that new coffee shop. He was ordering a suspicious drink, that's all."
Draco stood on Primrose Hill, fingers wrapped around a paper cup of cold coffee, wondering how much longer he could avoid returning home.
Draco crosses his arms across his chest. "Well, fucking tough. I
you. It's not up to you, Harry." Her eyes blaze. "I'm only seventeen. I need to send an owl to the Harpies to accept a spot on their reserve team. You're a mess. We cannot be parents."
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m making coffee.”
"Are you sure—"
Harry shifted in his seat. “Yeah. We made plans to go Saturday.”
Scorpius started laughing too, and Draco frowned. "What?" Draco asked. "I mean, yes, thank you for believing us, but it isn't
Hermione laid her folder on the desk and flipped it open. “The dress code does not prohibit anything we’re wearing. As you can see,” she pointed a finger at three different highlighted sections, “because the code sets different standards for men and women. Women are not required to be clean-shaven. Men are not required to wear subtle makeup or to cover their knees.”
Malfoy sighs with some drama. "I just want people to be shitty to you, too."
He imbued the word with meaning, but his hand shook slightly in Harry's.
"Infraction of 16 Ministry Code § 240," Draco said without emotion. "Ministry employees shall refrain from sexual conduct both in action and in speech, and—"
That was the thought that finally roused him from the bench, pushed him towards home. Harry didn't make Draco brave, but Harry made him feel like shit for being a coward. Sometimes that was enough.
Harry rolls his eyes, but can't keep a smile off his face.
Harry snorted. “Oh, of course. It is hard. Perhaps he should marry his Hogwarts nemesis and be done with it.”
He dressed as quickly as possible these days, because his room felt a bit like a cell. Today he ate quickly, too, needing to get to the office, needing…something. To move.
They still had no idea what they were going to do come summer. Penelope was helping them to "be okay with not knowing." They kept saying they were okay with it, but Harry didn't think either of them really believed they were.
At this, Harry started laughing again, his abs stinging, and he struggled to take a deep breath.
"Good day to you, lads!" the clock man who was apparently named Wilhelm proclaimed grandly, swinging his little wooden axe. "I've been getting acquainted with the youngster! She has a
He had bags filled with Shrunken items to return to James, Albus, Lily, Ginny, Rose, and Teddy. He'd Vanished enough items that he was having worries about however that whole thing worked. He couldn't Vanish so much that it would implode the fabric of existence, could he?
Harry looked up at the trees, the birds flying around. “I know you’re sorry.”
. Half me, you know?"
“Should we go over there?” Ron asked, turning to Harry with wide blue eyes.
Harry wakes, shaking, and tries to breathe. He's in bed alone, and he doesn't know if he should tell his dream to fuck off or treat it like a prophecy. It's true, in some ways—isn't it? People leave. It's life. And in his life, everyone leaves. Everyone except Hermione. He considers going into her room, crawling into her bed—but no. No. He's okay.
"Better get a move on, lads," Wilhelm's voice shouted from Harry's pocket, causing Harry to jump about a foot. "Auror Diggle's map just told me that there's a crowd forming outside the DMLE offices."
"That's the first time I've ever heard you say that!" Scorpius teased.
Draco shook his head, amused, and Harry took him by the shoulders and walked him backward towards the bed. When his calves hit the bed, Draco sat, looking up at Harry with amusement and curiosity. "
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Yeah, hopefully they can manage to work out a dress code that doesn’t put an undue burden on anyone. But, you know, keeps people’s arse cheeks under wraps.”
"You have an enormous bewitched crow statue!" Lily exclaimed, tugging Nico to the table. "We're ready to decorate. Dad, start the tunes."
Draco leaned forward, glaring in a manner that was likely supposed to be menacing, though the flapping butterfly on his face somewhat ruined the effect. Harry clicked the button. “Get it off!”
Somehow, in the midst of all the other shit he was dealing with, the fact that Malfoy was one of the people whose post-war mental health issues were most similar to Harry’s really seemed beyond the pale.
“Okay, okay, listen!” Harry says, excited. “It’s a novelty potion that makes you look like the age your lover thought you were most attractive. For….er, a few hours, we think. We’re not really sure yet. It’s for George’s new Silver Sorcerers line.”
Harry blinked, the concerned-parent mantle settling effortlessly onto his shoulders. "Did you have it inspected? Did you bring anyone else to see it? Are you sure they didn't rip you off? How did you have enough money?"
He looks over his shoulder. "Er, yes. Is that too weird for you?"
"So I can clean up messes now and in the future?"
"It's capitalist nonsense, is what it is," Harry retorted with the fiery resistance of one certain he's right. "That bill practically makes it legal for businesses to nurture mini-Voldemorts!
“You are 63,” Harry deadpans.
Well, fuck.
Harry wants to slam his head against something. "Erm, no. That's fine."
when I left.”
"You're such a snob."
"Does that getup have any pockets?" Wilhelm asked, hinging forward at the hips for a better view of Harry's clothes. "I'd prefer a breast pocket, but I won't turn up my nose at a trouser."
"Come on, Dad, kiss your husband!" Lily goaded. The entire table of traitors started chanting "kiss him, kiss him" and Harry rolled his eyes, turned to face a still-laughing Draco, and pressed a kiss to his lips.
you!"
"I hate every single one of you," Albus groaned, head still in his hands. "I was
Harry opened his eyes and started scratching out some “evidence against,” watching Malfoy out of the corner of his eye doing the same.
an echo of Dobby's voice sounded in Harry's head. Harry pressed his forehead into his hands and took a deep breath. He didn't much feel like a great wizard these days. He felt lonely despite all his friends, untethered despite his job and house and responsibilities, unfulfilled despite all he'd accomplished. And somehow, he was fixated on Draco Malfoy, as if it were 1996 instead of 2006.
Draco stood there, the early morning sun glinting off his hair, balancing the box on his hip, wearing a Muggle-style suit. The soles of his shoes were worn, and his hair was in his face.
be used on anyone. But less than 2% of cis wizards have reported being sexually assaulted, compared to over 20% of cis witches and 47—47%!—of trans witches and non-binary wix. So this is an issue where violence is being perpetrated
Wilhelm nodded. "Would an anecdote cheer you up?"
Harry hadn’t said this to anyone, but he was grateful that McGonagall was forcing them all to do this. Even if—especially if—he didn’t want to be here.
"But sir! It is being no trouble! Have you ever seen a house-elf perform unpacking magic?" Her eyes grew wide. "It is
"No, really," Harry insists. "Make sure you step off. You can't like...just slide off."
"I feel like I've run a marathon," Harry said later, after everyone had left and Lorraine served chicken shawarma bowls (rice for Harry, cauliflower 'rice' for Draco).
Nico was full deer-in-Lumos now, exactly as Draco had hoped. Draco stood, patted Nico on the shoulder, and returned to the kitchen.
He takes a breath and Disapparates.
"Hold
it. How much he wanted it. And the fact that he knew it wasn't real. Draco had been very clear about their arrangement, and he didn't seem bothered by any of it—but he hadn't really wanted Harry in his bed, had he? He had hesitated when Harry mentioned it. And now, in his sleep, he was cuddling. Everyone knew that cuddling was only good if the other person wanted to cuddle you back. No one wanted a nighttime cuddling accident caused by gravitation towards warmth.
"Not electric," Harry corrects. "Digital. We're going to play Duck Hunt. Wanna play? Malfoy's learning about Muggle pastimes for Magimanities."
Good Merlin.
Harry nudges Malfoy with his shoulder. "No, you git. I just need to keep it together with all these people here. No one needs to see a patented Harry panic spiral."
"I love you," Draco muttered back, his face smushed into Harry's shoulder. "I love you. You really think we can do this?"
Scorpius flung his long arms around Harry's neck and squeezed. "Breakfast! You truly are the Saviour, Harry!"
He grins at me. "Have you been paying attention to McGonagall all these years?"
"We haven't
Draco's mouth twisted in thought. "Might be. Depends if you're ready to be unemployed."
Harry's leg started bouncing. "Yeah. I just—I don't want you to be all careful around me, like this."
Harry wasn't going to say anything to scare Draco off the leftist agenda, but he couldn't help but muse delightedly that Draco, for all he called himself a centrist, was few leagues left of centre these days.

"We're not a
"Please take the Dragon Thief to see Mister Malfoy," the first goblin said, and the second goblin narrowed her eyes at Harry before leading him through the hall and down a corridor. They twisted through a maze of doors and archways before finally the goblin knocked at a tall bronze door.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "What?"
"Oh, good grief," Draco muttered as Harry's eyes landed on the mistletoe hanging over their heads.

"No, of course not, but also—it was a
Harry doesn't know much about babies, but he does know that the most important thing babies need is a simple one: love. He thinks of Teddy, a tiny bundle of hair, spit-up, and crying. He's still not comfortable holding Teddy, if he's honest, but he's getting there. It's not like he'd be a bad dad. He would try, he would be there, and that's all it requires, isn't it?
became Minister. A counting error in the election returns, the Vow killing him on the spot, a freak heart attack—something.
"You know what belonging looks like, Harry?" Draco rants. "Duck Hunt in the middle of the night, and a ridiculous best friend who will stop studying to learn a Backstreet Boys dance. Stop acting so entitled, for fuck's sake."
"We drink so much coffee," Bill groaned. "I don't think I even taste it anymore, I just chug it like it's medicine."
“Draco.”
My father, through the transparent wall, blinks, confused. "Draco?" He's looking between me and Wormtail's transfigured corpse.
Her arms tighten. "What would we do without
Harry thinks he is supposed to have realised something here. "What?!"
Harry, who is definitely drunk and looks young enough that Draco wants to sternly remind him not to drink and Apparate, steps closer. “Come off it, Draco! The magic says this is when you found me the most attractive! So like, let’s take advantage of it! We can make the lasagnas later. Admit that you’re attracted to me, and think the peak of my attractiveness was when we were in school.”
Draco, too, was silent.
But Malfoy shook his head and grinned. “Alright. But only if we can use Cushioning Charms.”
Harry, incredulously, turned to him. "Can we not talk about this right now?"
"That's not how vows work, Draco. Magical vows today are revokable and and don't have compulsion." He put a comforting hand on Draco's knee.
"How to
Draco throws one hand wildly to the side. "Maybe because I
After a while, Draco brought his arms up around Harry's back and shoulders and squeezed tightly, well past the usual upper range of hug pressure.
"No," Lily said, with jarring brusqueness. "No way. That's way too passive. I know you—you wouldn't be happy with that. You're a Gryffindor, Dad. You want to
A moment later, Draco was opening a door, pushing Harry through.
"Yes! The Muggles have been doing it for decades." Albus twirled his fork in his fingers as he talked. "But like, here's an example of how it could work. Dad used
"Did you have fun last night?" she asks, looking up. "I didn't see you at the end of the party. Did you take my advice and go outside for a breather?"
Fuck it.
There's an aunt in his flat, and the Burrow doesn't belong to him anymore. He walks into the nearest alley and realises with an uncomfortable feeling that there's only one place other than his flat where he feels understood. He Apparates to Draco's.
"Who would rather be outdoors?"

“You think it’s commas again?” Harry asked, recalling the Oxford-comma-pocalypse of 2006.
"'Easier' isn't 'better', Dad," James snapped. "Come on. You know that." Under his breath, he muttered something that sounded, if Draco was correct, like
Potter nods, and I'm struck again by how tired he looks. "I know." He fiddles with his trousers. They're really ugly. They have some kind of exterior pocket mounted near the outer knee, like a handbag is riding side-saddle on the trousers. "Do you have any idea how long it will be until he gets here?"
. “But I can bring you a drink or something.”
teenager,
Harry was hit with a wave of wanting to provide comfort—a feeling he often experienced since becoming a father. But that feeling had rarely been directed towards Draco before. Somehow he wanted to cross the space between them and give Draco a hug, to tell him he understood, that they'd both put up with so much shit. To say that this messy family they had now would be better.
“No,” Harry said with some force. “It’s—it’s too close. I can’t question it. I can’t, like, think about it objectively. Maybe someday. Right now I just need to convince myself I did the best I knew how.”
He's not sure what to say. It's not like this is some stranger he just picked up. What is he meant to say?! He stands there, gaping.
need to know what I want."
Harry stepped back, looking between Draco and Albus, amused. Was Albus going to be mad that Draco had bought all this stuff? Harry hoped the large space he had just put between himself and Draco would signal his non-involvement in the purchasing.
"No! I mean, yes! I just want you to act normal!"
Harry chanced a look at Draco, though he worried that if he caught Draco’s eye, he might lose his composure entirely and burst into riotous laughter. Draco raised his hand and coughed to cover a smile.
Draco smiles. "She out-witted the caffeine. Started hitting me with Charms to put me to sleep. At about eight-thirty in the evening, too. I eventually quit the chocolate of my own volition so I could stop falling asleep so early."
Sweet Merlin’s knickers.
"Coordination of random people on the internet?" Draco asked, looking supremely skeptical.
“Yes, thank you, Professor Potter,” Pomfrey says. “This is exactly why people with partners live longer than those without, because someone is around to make sure they seek attention when they need it.” She flips open the record and starts thumbing through it, oblivious to Draco’s shock.
All the nervous energy that had been tapping his leg rerouted and Harry leaned in, pressing his lips to Malfoy's, his heart beating in his chest, and it was one of those rare moments he'd been having since last May of feeling
Jorgen rushed up and Harry closed himself and his assistant into the office, casting a Muffliato. "Okay. In anticipation of Rump sacking me, I need your help getting my important things out of here."
The fire crackled.
And merciful heavens—I don't want to watch Potter crawling around. Well, I
One time Harry stepped through the Floo to find Draco at the breakfast table, papers spread out in front of him, and James running—loudly—up and down the stairs. Every time James landed on the first floor, Draco flinched.
Harry was getting a bit annoyed at the continued hysterics. "This was your idea! Remember? Why did you propose it if you don't think we could handle it?"
stuff, you realise," Draco said, unsure why this was getting his hackles up. "It's not like I think money buys love."
Harry didn't budge, so apparently that wasn't enough of an explanation. Merlin.
"Ohhhhhhhhhh," Ron and Hermione said together, sharing a look.
"I don't know if the other people in your life sit around laughing about your self-abnegation, but I don't find it funny."
"Put your face back," Harry said, distractedly.
I laugh.
Within a couple minutes, Harry is sweating and laughing more than he has in ages. Turns out that he has no sense of direction and keeps accidentally going the wrong way and knocking into Draco. Hermione is fantastic at arm motions and shoulder shimmying but awful at footwork. Draco is so focused on what he calls "the fluidity of the movements" that he keeps getting behind.
"I suppose a distraction would be good. What film?"
Harry sighed, looking around, and started stacking the dishes.
"Hullo," Malfoy says, and Harry kisses him.
Just as Harry began to smile and feel his shoulders relax a fraction, he heard a weary sigh behind him and turned to see Malfoy standing, arms crossed.
," Harry said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out Wilhelm, little wooden eyebrows and mouth arranged in a suggestive, almost congratulating smirk.
to talk to Malfoy. There was a painting on the wall of a satyr, and Harry wanted to ask Malfoy about something he'd read about the use of Satyr magic in curses. There was a witch wearing a pair of earmuffs, each muff shaped like a stuffed pear, and Harry wanted to tell Malfoy it looked like the perfect gift for Professor Sprout. He saw two small boys sitting on the ground next to their mother's feet, one of them teasing the other, and the second punching the first in the arm, and it made Harry want to tell Malfoy he was sorry.
I stare for a long moment. "Potter. Are you suggesting we Transfigure Wormtail's corpse to look like one of us?"
"Is that so?" Draco asks, his voice sounding posher than ever as he tries not to reveal his emotions.
"But," Teddy stammered, leaning forward, "but
"I don't want to talk about it."
Draco pressed his lips together.
"Oh, morning Harry," Hermione says, looking over her shoulder as her arms punch the air. "When do you—"
She looked at him closely, then nodded and started shooting Cleaning Charms around the kitchen—at the top of the cupboards, in the corners of the ceiling. "Why isn't Draco here, anyway? Isn't that his job now, helping with shit like this?"
"I think you just want to call me Professor Malfoy."
Harry had not expected Malfoy to actually do it, though in retrospect he thought he should probably assume that Malfoy would step up to a silly challenge if he issued it.
that are
"Who's more likely to cry during a film?"
“I have not,” Draco responded from his spot on the sofa, a book on his lap. Harry could tell he was annoyed because he kept squeezing his wand hand.
Harry smiles, letting his head fall back. "Go ahead, I know you want to say something. You can say whatever you're thinking."
Jorgen's face dropped, and Harry, again, felt guilty. Harry leaving pulled the rug out from under Jorgen's job, of course. He'd have to get used to a whole new person, with their own quirks and their own sentient office supplies.
"It was nice to forget about it for a few minutes," Draco says. "But Weasley's right—we were forgetting. I don't think Granger has had a chance to really forgive me. Not yet."
Draco made a face, then turned to the baby. "Was your grandpa telling you terrible things about me?" She grabbed his finger and started chewing on it. "It's very important that you never listen to anything bad he says about me. Because I will be the one to tell you all the terrible things I've done, when you're old enough to understand. But you mustn't take Grandpa Harry's word for it. He'll tell you tall tales; he'll twist stories all around. He'll try to tell you that a hippogriff didn't maim me, for example. Which it did."
Draco pursed his lips, looked around surreptitiously, and pulled his wand, casting at Harry’s face before tucking it back in his holster.
smoke pouring out of Rump's ears, like he'd eaten a Pepper Imp. "Don't play games with me, Potter. You get no special treatment from me for something you did when your bollocks were barely descended."
"I mean," Ron said, "if I was going to be worried about his being a bad person, I'd probably focus on the Death Eater thing."
Shit. Harry's face falls as she starts to walk away. He feels like he's been hit with a Stunner.
"So I should see if they can come over? You want to have them over here or to your place?"
For a long moment, Draco was silent, and Harry worried he'd made a grave miscalculation with regard to Draco's banter threshold.
Malfoy takes an ostentatious bow. "Did you do the reading for magimanities? I have a question about Muggles relating to the text on page 37."
He said nothing. Draco’s eyes were so light, silvery grey in the industrial-strength Lumos. “Draco, I—”
"Rump announced he's withdrawing Magical Britain from the ICW."
Harry gasps for air—Draco grabs his shoulders. "Focus on me, Harry. Look at my face that you hate so much."
Harry throws the paper bag onto Draco's table and turns, hands on his hips, to face Draco. "I'm not used to this whole...people-sticking-around thing. I'm not great at it. I'm going to do better."
Harry, ever the Gryffindor even when under the watchful eye of grudge-holding goblins, leaned forward and pressed his lips to Malfoy's. Malfoy reached behind Harry's head, sliding his fingers in Harry's hair, and kissed back.
"We're not joking, Lils." Harry hated lying to his kids. But he and Draco really were going to get married; was it even a lie at this point? "It's serious."
Her glare pierces. "Should I have consulted you first?"
"I haven't scared you away?" Malfoy returned.
"Draco Malfoy is speechless," Harry said, a grin sneaking onto his face despite his foul mood. "Well there's a first. Should I call Rita Skeeter, get this documented?"
Malfoy reaches into his pocket and withdraws his handful of tokens. He taps the bloke in front of them, the one with the spikier frosted tips, and says, "Excuse me."
“But sir!” Harry could not believe this. “I didn’t do anything!”
“No, it’s a good idea. We should get out, you’re right.” Draco reached for his wineglass. “We both work too hard. It’s just—‘something fun’. Like what?”
Draco's face creased in some unreadable emotion, something that looked maybe guilty, but before he could say anything, Harry stepped into the Floo.
He shouldn’t be so open—fuck, what was wrong with him? He was acting like a Hufflepuff, and Malfoy was going to take the piss.
"Who is it?" Molly pokes her head out of the kitchen. "Harry, darling! I haven't seen you in ages. Are you hungry?"
Harry nodded. "Bye, love you!"
Harry had no idea Hermione had any family left. He thought she has parents who don't remember she exists, who live in Australia. He thought the two of them were in it together—orphans, familyless, together against the world.
"Twenty different brands of bottles and nipples, both magical and Muggle. Babies are finicky, sometimes they like the shape of one over the others. Try that and hopefully she'll take the milk."
"I can't believe I'm sitting here discussing a decade's worth of masturbation with you."
Harry, laughing, dropped onto his stomach. “You’re such a competitive bastard. Okay, hold on, give me a second.”
Draco strode in and flopped elegantly in one of the armchairs in front of Harry's desk, his robes billowing around him. "How about, 'Can I offer you a drink'?"
Harry runs into his bedroom and grabs the letter from his desk, folding it so they won't see any of his message. "Got it," he says, coming back out.
"How do you deal with the fact that you fought on different sides?" Lee asked, looking at them with interest.
Harry nodded. "Do you think we were right to put all that banter in? I know Parvati said…but it doesn't seem all that lovey, does it? I just can't help but wonder if she missed the mark with that."
Harry coughed on his mocha, spraying bits of whipped cream high into the air, which of course was the exact moment that their waiter arrived carrying his crustless quiche.
"Potter, what the fuck are we doing?" Malfoy said suddenly, leaning forward on his elbows. "Really, I want to know. Why are we chatting muffins? Do we chat muffins now?"
Harry wanted to ask how he could be so sure, but it didn't seem his place. "Moot. Okay." He sighed.
I stand taller. "Is that a challenge, Potter? Bagsy not my face on the rat."
Potter's eyes flare at the mention of the werewolf threats, but what he says is, "Yes, Malfoy. It's very sad that the hate group you joined isn't treating you according to some code of honour." He picks up a stone. "It's not fair that I have to figure out how to deal with people dying because of me."
"I won't!" I clarify, hating the incredulous look on Potter's face. I tilt my head toward the ceiling for strength. "Honestly. We will
lust. Or normalcy. Like if they kissed with enough intensity, they might
"Fuck me." Malfoy turns back around.
Draco grinned. "What? There's no sense mincing words."
Music echoes in from the other room, no longer a horrible trigger, just NSYNC.
"You said that already."
Malfoy's shoulders relax when he realises Harry's joking. "Yes," he says seriously, "and the quail would try to convince me I'm not evil." He pauses. "It's like an advertisement for WETB."
Draco exhales when she closes her door. "Is it just me, or is she terrifying?"
It was with some satisfaction that Draco saw Lily's face take on a tinge of remorse. Draco loved Lily, but he loved Harry more.
They’d reached the pitch. “A race, or Keeper-Chaser?” Harry asked.
"I wanted—I wanted to get to grow up!" His voice gets louder, agitated. "I wanted to have sex! I wanted to be in love with someone like my parents were!"
at a stag do, it's required attire, Daddy, come on").
and declares, "Potter! You need to ask before you introduce that type of element into our sexual repertoire."
"No offense, Draco, but having to pretend I'm in love when I'm actually not in love and am, instead, horrified about world politics definitely falls under the label of 'shit'."
Draco gave him an unimpressed look. "
, and the entire DMLE was falling apart: an Auror arrested for abuse of power, Persephone Diggle talking around the issue.
"Hey!"
Harry almost doesn't want to show Draco this ugly preposterous thing he made. It's embarrassing, even if it's funny. But he's done hiding his feelings. Well, no, he'll probably always struggle not to hide his feelings. Not hiding from his feelings will be a lifelong quest, and he's starting now.
Granted, marrying Draco would be a bit more pleasant than dying by Voldemort's hand. At least, he was 99 percent sure it would be.
Something sails across the room, straight out of the rat-man's pocket. It lands in front of Potter's feet.
. "The best part is that we are home and don't have to lose any sleep caring for her. And then we can go tomorrow and see her during waking hours, and then we can come back home and sleep tomorrow night."
"It's not a keg," I scoff. "But I think there is a way. I don't know what it is, though. Fuck!"
"You're such a slob." Draco wiped his mouth delicately with his napkin. "So tomorrow let's go out somewhere visible again. Flourish and Blotts to browse the books? Out for a nightcap at the Drunken Cat? What do you fancy?"
The question opened the floodgates. Draco sat back, staring in awe at their assembled progeny as they all started speaking at once, volumes rising as they tried to speak over each other. Draco noticed absentmindedly that Wilhelm, still clutched in Aster's fist, was in on the action, raising his hand and shouting something into the noise.
magic someone a womb?"
"I refuse to let that kind of nonsense continue," Harry said. "If I'm in love with Draco, I want every queer kid in our nation to see it and to know that we're here, and we're happy, and that love is possible. I want our lives to be a giant 'fuck you' to all of that." Harry laughed, scrubbing his left hand over his face. "You can't print that, can you? I just want to say—we're in love, we're happy, and since that's the case, there can be no such thing as 'too soon.' We demand happiness, in full, right now. If I have to be a celebrity, I'm going to be one that queer kids can look up to."
"Well, the sooner the better, really, because we want it to seem like old news by the time the next election rolls around, and we've already done the groundwork of appearing in public together more frequently."
"If you just watched telly, you'd think relationships required nothing but physical attraction. That's not true. They require a lot of things, primarily that you
Draco counted out six dried eyebright flowers and placed them in a mortar. He used his wand to Levitate ten dried lacewing flies out of a jar, adding them to the mortar and charming the pestle. Once a fine powder, he poured the contents into the cauldron.
Author's Note, 17 August 2021: My mind is blown by the changes in the political landscape since I first conceived of this fic—which was I think 2018—and writing it now. In some ways it feels like the world has changed in every possible way, and I'm still trying to write this fic in a way that reflects my emotional understanding of political realities. Wildness! Fun! I hope you're enjoying reading it, too. 💜
Malfoy gestures wildly at Harry, a tea cosy in his hand. "You are not allowed to get weird about this
jumper. But knowing Draco’s jeans (well tailored) and Draco’s jumpers (generally cashmere), Harry had to admit that it would be an appropriate outfit for the zoo, the theatre, and, indeed, most restaurants. Draco, at fifty-six, seemed to have cracked the Muggle code.
Harry can't help it—he laughs. "Alright. I'll see you soon, then."
I'm under no illusion. This is war. When I said
“No idea,” Harry said. This was fucking awkward. He didn’t want to sit here for hours in the dungeon with Malfoy wondering whether the potion was working. “Want to go outside?” he asked. “It’s probably nice out.”
that, in our current society, in which we believe that myth and give it power, gender does make a difference. Sexual assault is a gendered issue, even if it need not be."
It bounced satisfyingly off the back of Malfoy’s blond head. A posh hand adorned with rings came up to touch his hair, and he turned around. When his eyes landed on Harry, they rolled skyward. "What the fuck, Potter?"
The duel resolving in the opposite direction? I start to feel nauseated before I even properly imagine it.
Some parts of living with Draco had become routine quickly. Lorraine ringing the bell for supper at 7 o'clock on the dot, eating next to Draco while they talked about their days, solitary morning walks to Primrose Hill. He'd even figured out how to use Draco's fussy cafetière to avoid bothering Lorraine.
we make an announcement?"
"These are different types of magical nappies—ideally one will fit perfectly and be comfortable for her." Draco stepped aside as the nappies soared into the green flames of the fire. "This is a charmed swaddle—the blanket is charmed. Works way better than charming a non-magical blanket. This is a swing that will sense her state of alertness and change its movements depending on whether she's trying to fall asleep, in REM sleep, in deep sleep, etc."
Potter nods, his eyes wide with fear, and whispers back, "He hasn't taken down the wards."
"Be quiet—you're with him. You're my best friend. Ergo, I have to be friendly with him." She wrinkles her nose. "I don't know how to go about that. How did you end up friends with him?"
But Grusta didn't leave. "Mister Malfoy, I am sorry, but the goblin code states that we will escort him to his place," here she turned to look straight at Harry, "and never take our eyes off his face."
"Oh Merlin and Morgana," Draco said when he pulled away, eyes drawn in horror to Harry's apron, which had become visible when he turned away from the counter. "I've just noticed your apron."
The thought of Draco's reaction to Ron's !! on his text made Harry happy enough to eat his sad oats and get on with his day. Even if he was sure that this dinner with Ron and Hermione would be a disaster.
"Don't bother denying it. I quite like Amaryllis; what say you?"
"Good thing I am, too," Harry said, yawning. "Otherwise we'd be broken up right now."
"Excellent," Hermione says, clapping her hands. "And happy Samhain."
. Get it off me.”
Draco hugged back.
"Oh, Harry."
"And Ron and Hermione," Harry added.
"I don't know," I whisper. "About using it for separate spells. I'm not sure. It might not work, and we won't get a second chance."
“Yeah.”
arson because I very carefully protected all surrounding property. I only burned that which I owned, and I wasn't seeking recompense." Peeking out below the arm that still covered his eyes, Draco's lips curved up. "Besides, they deserved that."
Harry's never wanted to have sex with Malfoy, but now that he's doing it—wet tongues, grasping fingers, cocks pressed tightly together in the circle of Malfoy's fingers—he keeps thinking of the old Muggle saying, "Make Love Not War." Maybe this is how they move on, how they start the rest of their lives. Maybe this is like a commencement ceremony, a ritual to symbolise the break, the start of the rest of their lives, lives not dictated by war and hate and the whims of a man named Tom. The rest of their lives—all their lives, everyone's lives—can be a swirl of contentment, and pleasure, and life—vivid, vital
Draco removed his arm and glared at Harry. "What
Hermione looks over her shoulder and shrugs. "I'm not here to hook up with anyone, so what does it matter?"
"Grow a pair," Rump growled at Draco, then turned back to Harry. "You're done, Potter. Pack your things. The Ministry will be better without you in it."
Hermione shrugs. "Nothing's foolproof."
"I really believed you," Teddy said, looking bewilderedly between them. "That time I put you to bed when you were so drunk, I thought you were going to strip down and start banging before I even had a chance to leave the room. I don't—it's—how were you faking that? Ever since I found out, all I can think is that I must have shit intuition, or terrible ability to judge people."
Draco stares at him. "Yes. Is that a problem?"
"We need to hide over here by the chain, somehow, and Apparate out as soon as they drop the wards," Potter says.
“No rest for the weary, Potter!” Draco quipped, summoning his wand. “I’m casting a Stopwatch Charm, ready or not, 3-2-”
"I know," Harry breathed into Hermione's hair. "I didn't—you were right—"
"Oh for the love of," Harry mutters, trying not to find it funny, trying not to be a person who is charmed by Draco's antics. He fails miserably, and ends up pushing Draco out of the way as he goes back to chopping vegetables.
I nod. I don't
. I thought you trusted us."
?! How has he not been an awkward mess around Malfoy every time they've seen each other? Because right now he feels
"And then when we made an announcement, it wouldn't be completely out of the blue?" Harry asked, trying to wrap his mind around this insanity.
reach out and soothe. It wouldn't give too much away, anymore. In fact, he needed to. They'd promised each other to be honest. Honesty, right now, was reaching out to brush Harry's hair away from his forehead; it was threading fingers through unruly locks.
"We play Quidditch still, despite Draco's old man knee," Harry blurted. It had started a few years ago, at James's insistence, every time they got together with Scorpius and Draco. Harry loved playing Quidditch with his kids—and James could out-fly him any day of the week, but it wasn't the same as going up against Draco. Trying to get the Quaffle from James always felt a little bit like Harry was teaching James on his safety-broom and pretending to let him win. Trying to get the Quaffle from Draco felt like he was back at Hogwarts with stands full of students cheering and screaming.
Harry sighed, all of his righteous indignation deflating out of his body, taking his energy with it. He sat in one of the chairs in front of Malfoy's desk. "I'm an idiot."
"You left a two Sickle tip on the bill yesterday!" Harry said, pointing his finger. "How could you do that? Do you know how awful it is to work in the service industry? No, no you don't. Do you know how much Wren and all the others probably get treated like crap, hit on by various customers, barely making enough money to make ends meet, getting yelled at about foam-to-milk ratios and other such rot! We'd been sitting there, talking, flirting, and then you go and do something like that—"
"Potter," Draco sighed. "You're not thinking in the right mindset. You're trying to think rationally about whether you'd have sex, but if that had actually happened we would've been all swept away by the moment. It wouldn't have been rational."
"Are you sure the gold won't refuse to be donated to a leftist cause?" Harry quipped. "The Galleons won't run back home on little metal legs, appearing back at the Manor like the vault key you tried to refuse?"
"Draco!" Harry shouted as soon as he stepped out of the Floo. He was furious, indignant, worried. He needed to shout without fear of repercussions.
Malfoy's face is unreadable. "Let's say all of the above."
I sneer.
"Wait," Harry said, freezing with horror. "Wait. Oh, fuck me."
"True enough," Harry admitted. "I distinctly remember you and your siblings ignoring toys in favor of a funnel."
Harry sighed and stared at his closet. If he were trying to impress someone, what would he wear? Hermione would never believe he was developing a crush on Draco if he wore an old Gryffindor t-shirt that Lily had produced and sold as a fundraiser when she was in sixth year.
.” Harry’s body tingled from head to toe, and he was asleep.
“So,” Malfoy said, starting to walk back to the castle. “We're really going to go skateboarding?”
Harry Potter. The only person who can take down the Dark Lord."
Harry reaches out and pokes the other one. Seems normal to him. "Seems normal to me."
"That seems promising. You know—you can talk to me about it, right? I know it's different, but I lost my parents, too."
He knew Draco was joking about the guest room, but it caused a flare of anxiety behind Harry's sternum. It was silly—he knew that—but he couldn't stop thinking about how much he hated the guest room. How much it made him feel like he wasn't actually living in this house. Like he was homeless, all his previous bedrooms (which, of course, included a cupboard and a musty tent in the Forest of Dean) gone, only to be replaced with a poshly decorated, sterile room.
"I don't need your money," Harry said, holding up one finger. "I only speak one language so I'm not sure why your being able to speak languages I don't understand would be considered a selling point." Two fingers. "And how does your doing yoga benefit me?"
Harry ignored him, and half expected Malfoy to order him to gather ingredients. But instead Malfoy checked the instructions, his pale finger running down the page as he whispered the necessary ingredients under his breath, then turned and walked to the supply closet.
Before he could answer, a purple envelope appeared in the middle of the air, zooming straight for Harry.
Albus Severus Potter has been known to rant about the inclusion of marriages and bonds under the purview of a department overseeing "propagation of the magical race" (the language used in the department's original charter, since updated to "reflect the times"). He often points out that the institution of marriage is, quite explicitly, about state control of the family unit and the (capitalist, bureaucratic) state interest in achieving replacement fertility. Scorpius Malfoy at this point usually adds that the history is unambiguously one in which heterosexual family structures were used to prop up the state as an institution at a time when magical governmental capacity was tenuous at best. (He then segues into a tangent about the difficulty of state control of a group of people as unpredictable and powerful as the magical populace.) Albus customarily agrees, concluding that the continued existence of B.A.I.R.N.s as a Ministry department proves that Magical Britain is committed to upholding and exploiting the heteronormative family structure as an organising principle of society, and that the only ethical and justice-promoting action is to embrace queer ways of living that challenge and decentralise the power inherent in the institution of marriage, the medicomagical treatment of reproduction, and the necessary failure of the capitalist state to support the dignity of life across the full spectrum of human flourishing.
She nodded. She had kids who'd grown and moved out—she understood. "How are you feeling? About moving in together? It's a big step, and it's been a long time since you lived with anyone."
Harry could not remember the last time he'd felt so awkward. He knew he looked great, and the clothes were objectively lovely, but causing an incident of national import through his clothing was not Harry's idea of a good time.
Andromeda laughs like that was a joke. "He doesn't need anything—I just changed and fed him. You can just sit there like that till I get back."
Harry scanned the paper. Tomorrow, in front of their children, families, and close friends, they'd be married. Today, he would find solace in chatter about Rump's assholery. "Not a big deal. I told them to forward every notice to Rump's office and otherwise ignore them. How long until I get sacked?"
Draco's mouth started answering before he even considered whether he should take Harry seriously. "The restoration of the Muggle Mediation Measures and the—"
Harry grinned. "Sure."
"Mmmh." Malfoy's hand moves faster.
"Worked up quite an appetite in there, eh?" Harry grins as he leans against the sink.
? At the Royal Academy of Magic?"
"Fine," Draco snapped, annoyed at Harry's insight. "We would've got drunk at Luna's house and played spin the bottle in the garden."
they don't give a shit about each other. Maybe that frees Draco to grab too tight, to use his teeth. Maybe the fact that they're doing this at all is a huge
Ron looked away from his sparkly floating notes. “...Really.”
Ron will be living with George once George moves out of his old flat. No one's willing to move into Fred's old room.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Why?"
"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck," Harry said, flopping onto his back on the sofa.
Draco pressed his lips to Harry's neck, which was doing something to Harry's insides. "Was that innuendo, Potter? It was awful." His teeth grazed Harry's ear.
Harry's breath caught. Malfoy was giving him an out, a chance to move away, a chance to play it like nothing had happened, but he was staring at Harry's lips and touching Harry's knee and Harry didn't have to worry he was imagining it, because it was already happening.
Harry closes his eyes. He deserves that. He can let it go. "No, it looks good. Can we talk? Want to go for a walk?"
"This, this isn't—" Draco stammered, closed his eyes, opened them again. "This isn't something you have to do. I have no expectations. You're under no obligation; this isn't necessary to stop the march of magifascism. I want to make sure—"
It all felt more conspicuous in the office.
Normally, Draco would refrain from dispensing legal advice during sex, but the Veritaserum drew it out despite it not being a question. "There are exceptions. It's not a breach of confidentiality to reveal information that is in the public domain; information that the disclosing party disclosed before signing the agreement; information given by a third party, wherein the third party was not obliged to keep the information confidential; and information that was in the lawful possession of the receiving party before the date of signing of the NDA."
"Everything's fine," Al said, sounding anything but. "She's in there with the midwife. A Healer has come to check on them a few times.
"What are you doing?"
"You know," Harry says, "at some point, if you keep putting Backstreet Boys on ironically, it stops being ironic. At some point, you just like them."
Harry pulled a face. “
"No." It was then that Draco saw Scorpius was furious. Scorpius furious was a rare and terrifying and heart-wrenching sight. "No, Dad. I don't want to hear excuses. I can't believe you would…" He trailed off, and Albus wrapped an arm around Scorpius's shoulders, tugging him close and shooting a stink-eye at Draco, as if daring him to hurt Scorpius any more than he already had.
Even with the charm in place, he could hear James arguing with Teddy about what Christmas film to watch, and Albus and Scorpius telling Draco to stop dropping baby name hints, and Nico gamely singing along (loudly—the man was, he told Harry, a classically trained tenor) with Lily's a capella version of "Last Christmas" (which had to be the worst Christmas song to sing with a current lover).
“Really, Draco. They don’t. They see a snarky Potions professor who has given out maybe ten Os in as many years, but who is the best teacher they’ve ever had. They see a coworker who brews personalised potions when he notices they’ve been a bit sniffly. They see a lanky arse who always loses at Quidditch to the handsome Defence teacher.”
Aster reached for the phone with a wet hand. Harry moved the phone out of her range and pretended to munch on her fingers instead. She curled her fingers into his cheek, and his heart clenched with an expansive, overwhelming sort of love.
"I'm your solicitor, George Chambliss." Draco said this in a passable non-Malfoy accent.
Potter's mouth falls open.
Draco, pretending not to be charmed, rolled his eyes.
Draco's eyes flitted skyward. "It's not my place."
Harry manages to stop spluttering, but his face remains bright red. “Digital as in—with an electric, er, device?”
Harry considers interpreting this as an insult, but Malfoy doesn't look like he's harbouring any rude thoughts about Hermione. He looks like he is trying to figure out how to keep away from the conga.
Ron stares at her, his face beetroot red.
Was Draco actually arguing about whether their hypothetically in-love selves would hook up in the Ministry? Or was this all an act to convince the kids?
“No.” Harry sighed, picking up a brown leaf and pressing it between his thumb and forefinger, watching it crumble. “Have you decided?”
Draco threw his head back and laughed. "I don't even care. I mean, obviously, they're right. The binary is a piece of devilry. But a baby girl! I could dance."
, and Hermione using magic to Levitate a truly enormous book called
"So are you." Malfoy sips his drink and fixes Harry with an assessing look. "Why are you even here? Shouldn't you be off with your adoring public, or with your perfect little girlfriend? Why are you here, alone, getting drunk and listening to terrible music?"
"I will not watch it." He pulls out his wand and waves it, and the room fills with the sounds of the Backstreet Boys. Not "Everybody", the dance to which they still haven't mastered, but "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)".
At first Harry thought Draco was being sarcastic, but when he looked up it was clear that Draco's question was genuine. "Er." Harry chuckled nervously. "I don't know. I have a lot of practice making sacrifices for the good of others?" When Draco just stared at him, Harry continued, trying to lighten the mood, "It's kind of my thing, you know."
to turn off the light on his side of the bed. “Hey,” he said, “did you have a chance to write down what we wanted to ask Bill? I can send the owl tomorrow. About the Triple M, I mean.”
Draco tried to keep his mouth shut, but the truth serum had other plans. "I would've asked you to dinner. At a restaurant with private rooms so you didn't have to deal with adoring fans or worry about getting dosed with love potions."
Harry tried to pull him in for a hug, but Albus stared at Draco and his phalanx of baby paraphernalia.
“James, we were just—” Harry began, but he was cut off.
He just wants a cup of tea. Tea will fix this. Tea can't fix everything, but it can at least fix the jitters from a nightmare. He orders the tea and a plate of toast from a tired-looking waitress and rests his elbows on the art-deco table, letting his head rest on his fist and his eyes flutter half-closed.
"Indeed."
They somehow make it through the rest of dinner, Hermione and Ron carrying the conversation, and when everyone's finished, Harry quickly clears his place and runs upstairs to Ginny's room, closing the door behind him. He sits on the bed and waits.
Draco turned to look at Harry, their heads very close together because of how Harry had tugged him close.
“I think I know who it’s from. We spoke with them when it first happened, to make sure we had input from those the policy hurt most.”
"About the ban on foreign magic?"
I reach around on the cold stone floor for something to chuck at his head, but there's nothing. I reach into my pocket and find a wax seal my mother had returned to me at breakfast. That feels like a lifetime ago. I lean away from the wall to aim properly, and feel a tiny spark of satisfaction as the fancy M-adorned-stamp clips Potter's knee.
My father will lower the wards, and Potter will be gone before my father knows he was there. I won't be to blame for keeping him here. I won't.
Draco's chest relaxed a fraction.
Harry crosses his arms over his chest, feeling inept. "It was a last-minute thought." What? Is Malfoy going to kick him out now—because he showed up without his bag? He thought they'd gotten past their enmity, especially given all the remedial video game lessons Harry's been providing.

Hermione can be.”

"I'm going to do it now."
"Maybe he poisoned
Harry could feel his breath catch in his chest at that reminder—it was something he’d been doing his level best to ignore. “Yeah.”
"You love those books too," Draco defended, trying to keep his voice level despite Harry's best attempts to wreck his composure. "And no one's ever been fucked in my office."
“Yes, Master Draco?”
He slumps on the wall. "Fuck."
Draco sighed, and put his fork down with a clatter. "I fucking hate hypotheticals like that. They're
He shucked off his robes and shoes, put away his bag, and walked curiously into the kitchen. James stood, head back, mouth open; Lily faced him from across the room holding a tub of pretzel nuggets and wielding her wand. Nico, amused, lounged on the sofa watching, and Harry, surrounded by floating ingredients and autonomous knives, was cooking.
Draco huffed a laugh against Harry's cheek. "Who am I to say no to that?" Harry's fingers reached down, wrapped around him, and Draco closed his eyes, trying not to hyperventilate. "One of the perks of being middle-aged: if we'd done this when we were young, it would've been over by now."
Draco threaded his fingers through Harry's thick hair. "Hey."
Draco opens his mouth, ready to speak, but Harry reaches forward to cover Draco's mouth with his hand.
So as he made his way to the office, he was grateful to be wearing his own, boring clothes. His Prana trousers that cost too much but looked equally at home at work or on a hike (no matter what anyone said, Harry knew Muggles made the best trousers). His battered Converse that he’d bought in black as a slight nod to workplace norms. His Wrinkle-Warded blue shirt.
After about thirty minutes, Draco whispered, “Am I keeping you awake?”
Harry smiles, though he suspects it looks like a grimace. "Thanks."
defies the odds; not me.
Harry shrugs. "I don't think it's horrible. I want you to be happy. If that's not Ron, well…"
"Well, okay. What's wrong with it? Do you not like the colour? We can redecorate. Do you want to put out some of your own things? I can put up some shelves if you need to display your Order of Merlin in a prominent place."
“Yes, well, you don’t have the energy for anything this year, do you?” Malfoy said, flipping open the book to find the instructions for the Draught of Pure Imagination.
"No, don't be a prat. I—" Harry had no idea what to say. He had come here with the intention of being honest, but right now he wasn't sure what that even was. "Er."
"I'm happy."
Which meant that almost every day Harry would arrive home after work, rushing to get back in time for dinner, to find Draco and James in various states of conflict. Or, not
"No, I— Listen. I'm not trying to therapise you. But it seems to me that what's fucked you up most in your life is that you've constantly been forced to do things because of other people's expectations. Dumbledore, Voldemort, maybe being married to Ginny, I don't know—but certainly your career, the way the Ministry uses you. I don't—I mean, I care about you too much to do that. I don't want to be part of that."
No one else caught it, but Draco saw Harry flinch, his shoulders and back tensing as if he'd just been punched.
Draco refuses to turn around to see the amused look on Potter’s fucking face.
In truth, Harry had considered making a comment to that effect—but only because he really had
Hermione's brows furrow.
Harry knows this is true. "I don't think...that most people understand that."
Malfoy looks up, his face falling into a scowl when he recognises Harry. "Potter? Why are you here?"
"Did you just break my daughter's boyfriend?" Harry asked in a low tone, looking supremely amused.
"Have you figured out what you need to do now?"
Legilimency is a type of magic, like flying or Animagus transformation, that doesn't require a wand, though wands make it easier for beginners. I'm sure he'll get it in a moment. So I nod and turn my attention to my Occlumency defences. It's strange to intentionally let the defences down, but that's what I have to do. What we're about to do requires Potter to have full access to my brain. I try not to think about what he might find in there. My thoughts are terrifying even to me, sometimes.
Draco flung out an arm, frustrated. "What changed is that I couldn't! I couldn't keep my emotions out of it!"
. And he knew he could eat Draco's food, but were there limits to that? What if that box of fancy biscuits was being saved for something?
"Yes."
"Aster!" Scorpius said, sticking his hands under the baby's armpits to steal her away from Draco. With no delay, she pressed her open mouth to his chin, smearing him with apple-scented drool. "My lovie! How are you today? I missed you so much!"
"You're not going to make some asinine comment about how you haven't had your coffee yet?" Malfoy asked in a low voice. "Everyone here at this time of day is constantly making jokes about how they haven't had their coffee yet."
"Don't you get lonely?" Harry asked.
"Sure, now. It's Sunday. We don't have work."
Draco gestured at Harry with a bag of walnuts. "You're the soft one, that's all I'm saying. Despite what the public thinks, that you're like a big bad Auror who annihilated Voldemort with his eyes closed, using his non-wand hand, or whatever they say about you these days. All I'm saying is, of all the grandparents, if the boys were looking for a mark…"
Draco was still cursing at his alarm ("Cunting
“Did she…think you were shaming her for eating?” Harry asked, treading lightly.
? I watched you buy out a tabloid because it printed something mean about Scorpius, and then proceed to fire every employee and burn the office to the ground. Literally."
Harry’s eyes flew open, blinking rapidly in time with his heart. His face was pushed into his pillow, the first light of morning peeking through the window.
"I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter."
"I don't know, Potter." Malfoy didn't turn around. "Perhaps we ought to just stop talking to each other, because clearly we are quite bad at it."
"I've been coming here for months! You just showed up!"
Potter looks over his shoulder, toward the stairs. "Side-Along?"
"Draco, what are you doing?"
Harry rushes out of Malfoy's flat without seeing anything, wishing he were sober enough to Apparate. Disappearing seems like just the thing.
Draco picked up his fork and stabbed a cherry tomato. "Quite right. I have no idea what Astoria would say, but I doubt it would be…strategic. And thank you kindly, but if we're to be married, you should know that I tell my parents exactly nothing. I make up information about my life to tell them, rather than ever telling them anything true. Sometimes I pull a memoir off the shelf, open to a random page, and whatever is there, I report to my parents as my recent news."
"We are now." Harry reached behind his head to tug off his t-shirt.
"Not important."
for the ads I did for Sleekeazy's. I've got plenty for the tiny castle." James paused, looking up at the ceiling and around the kitchen. "Actually, it probably cost less than this place. Despite it being a castle and everything. How much did this bedsit set you back, Draco?"
He tugged his wool cloak (a gift from his children and step-children last Christmas, the fur trim was cruelty-free, duplicated from ethically gathered mink fur) tighter around his shoulders, spelled his hair to stop blowing in his face, and entered the fray. He smiled at people who recognised him, held open doors for witches Levitating prams, calmly allowed one wizard to berate the Malfoys for "strategically monopolising the Potter family line," and accepted handshakes from people who wanted to say hello and commiserate about Rump.
"Right," Draco said, seeming to shake himself. "Anyway, Ministers don't usually have
"I'm not saying I get my jollies from corpses!" I clarify. "Quite the contrary, as a point of fact. I'm merely saying I got a jolly from joking about it."
“I’m not racing you,” Ron said, slinging a leg over his broom. “Keeper-Chaser!”
"You're embarrassing," Harry retorted, his voice a soft echo of the schoolyard taunts that used to comprise the entirety of their interactions.
Draco flung his hand out to point a finger at Harry. “Don’t
"What?!" Draco knew his rising intensity could only escalate the situation, but he couldn't help it. "What are you talking about?! You told me you liked

“I’m in here.”

Harry hoped she had someone with her, that she had someone hugging her and telling her how brave she was.
I whack him in the arm, trying not to overthink how familiar I'm being with him. "Shut up. It's hideous! It's a monstrosity!"
I hear the humming of that malfunctioning charm again, and the scurrying of the rat. Every once in awhile I hear someone yelling upstairs and try not to worry about my mother.
“I know,” Penelope answered. “But you have preferences about how to spend your time. What do you want to do?”
Because why not? Who cared what the public thought? Harry knew what Draco was like now—what he’d worked so hard to become. And that was all that mattered.
"I didn't—" Harry started, but then he didn't know what else to say, and closed his mouth.
Harry swallowed.
"We should have a third list," Harry said.
"Where?" Draco added, as if that were helpful.
"Right," Harry says, distractedly pulling on his pants and trousers. He finishes dressing quickly, despite his continued drunkenness. Before he leaves, he turns and looks at Malfoy. "You're right—you're not dead. Try not to massively fuck it up this time, Malfoy."
"Come on in," Harry said quickly, wanting nothing more than to dispel all awkwardness. "Thank you so much for agreeing to write about us. We realise it's a step down from the importance of your usual work."
"Who proposed?"
"I don't know!" Harry groans. "How do you tell if you're having a fight with
Harry stared at him. Life seemed suddenly, palpably surreal.
for a few years, and now he pretty much chose what he would write about and when.
Malfoy didn’t answer, only raised the potion to his lips and drank. Harry hurried to drink his too, not wanting to look like he had been waiting for Malfoy to drink first.
too much. Is that so bad? I refuse to think that makes me a freak. I get so fucking tired of everyone looking at me like I'm so strange—like there's something wrong with me for caring. 'Oh silly Harry, coming in last place because he couldn't leave a little girl tied up underwater. Oh Harry, so naive!' Maybe everyone else should care
"At the top, of course," I say, completely at random, and cast a spell to remove the fur from the rat's face. The rat's furless face staring back at me, though, is terrifying, and I have to turn away for a minute. "Oh sweet Circe. That is heinous."
“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, finally speaking. “Thank you. Being forced to sit in the same room with each other and to observe basic manners is exactly the same as the time I refused to identify you to my insane aunt or the time you flew me to safety out of literal Fiendfyre. Thank you for that helpful analogy.”
Draco snorted inelegantly and rose onto his knees, then dropped forward, head and arms landing near Harry’s head. “I will absolutely slaughter you.”
Harry frowned. "I don't think anyone in the history of the world has ever thought to compare you to a terrier."
"It's okay!" Harry calls jovially.
Harry closed the gap in the queue and turned to Malfoy. "Er, good morning, Malfoy."
Harry snorted and Summoned a bottle of whiskey from the side of the room. He knew Draco liked this particular whiskey because the first time Harry'd tasted it, it had been a gift from Draco. It was awkward, this whole combining-of-families-for-holidays thing—you had to buy a gift for your in-laws, and really, how did you buy a Christmas gift for your childhood enemy turned in-law? Whiskey was a good bet.
Harry pushed him away, still laughing. "Oh, Merlin. Fuck off."
Potter's eyes grow comically wide. "Use your magic? What—I can't—how?!"
Draco’s mouth curled in a slow, devious smile. “Oh really?”
"Good idea. First on my list of grievances is that you are a stubborn bastard."
After a moment of silence, Harry adds, "And why is every Muggle song these days about abortion?!"
"Goodness," Harry said in a bizarre, simpering sort of voice, "I always heard you people arguing that LabMag isn't a weak party, as is often accused by the Blimps, but I'm not sure I believed it until right n—"
"Draco, it's me. Can I come up?"
A crease appeared between Draco's eyes. For a moment, it looked like he wasn't going to say anything, but then he straightened his shoulders and said, "By 'this shite', am I to take it that you mean all of it—your living situation, hating the guest room, being here with me during Rump's tenure? Because I would hope that if something is bothering you, you'd have the decency to tell me so we could make it right. I take no pleasure in ruining your life for a decade, despite what my younger self would've had to say on the matter."
It was odd, that Harry was unexpectedly skilled at metacognition.
The file cabinets clattered open drawer by drawer and papers flew out, landing neatly in a pile in Jorgen's hands.
If he were married.
Draco stood and approached Harry. "First of all, I can do whatever the fuck I want with my money. Second of all, it's not only the right thing to do but also necessary. Why on earth would we not put both names on the deed? It would be suspicious. As if Harry Potter wouldn't have any property assets." Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco interrupted. "Frankly, you already agreed to this when you agreed to marry me."

'believable' about him conducting a secret relationship with Draco was a preposterous exercise, anyway.
"Business owners are worried about the prospect of losing money," Draco explained, as if Harry didn't know that businesses wanted to make money.
lying. We've made a decision to live together and to be married for a period of time. What difference do our motives make to them?"
"Are you always like this when you have sex?" Draco asked, face completely splotchy and hair a mess. "I can't tell if we're about to fuck or if we're putting on a slapstick duel."
Over Hermione's head, Draco caught Pansy's eye. She was talking quietly with Ron, and when she caught Draco's eye, she winked. Ron, for his part, looked, at the least, resigned—but possibly, understanding.
. It's so strange, but it doesn't really feel strange. Harry finds himself thinking,
Draco stared at the table, absent-mindedly buffing a fingerprint off the glossy surface.
"Thanks for coming," Harry said, feeling awkward. He hated when people talked about him when he was right there, even if he had invited it.
“Sometimes things that are legal are still…” Draco fishes for the right word, “...unscrupulous.”
Harry, though he agrees in principle, finds it difficult to match his son's fervor, and at this point tends to look for someone with whom to share a Knowing Look.
He snorts. "Everything. Everything. I haven't done a fucking thing."
Harry, unperturbed, stuck his tongue out to lick up the drop of sweet liquid on his upper lip.
"Because then you wouldn't be moping about it with me at a bar!" Malfoy responds, throwing one hand out for emphasis, still laughing.
Scorpius turned imploringly to his father. "We don't have to go."
Harry whirled towards Albus. "Albus! Way to make it dirty and then complain about it."
"Well," Harry announced, and Hermione looked up expectantly from the paperwork at her desk, "Malfoy is up to something."
"Apparently there's a notion in some pure-blood circles that a Crucio is an appropriate treatment for a panic attack."
Harry closed his eyes. They wanted to get this in the papers. They wanted their beards and legs and makeup on the front page of the Prophet, blinking up at magical people from breakfast tables all over England. Harry thought they were bonkers—admirably bonkers, but bonkers all the same. He could admire their commitment, but also… “There’s no way I’m wearing a skirt in the Prophet.”

Hermione hugged the folders tight to her chest and looked up at him. Her beard was...fluffy. Black, curly.
"A fair point," Draco said. He stood, gesturing to the desk. "Tell me what you have so far on this policy paper?"
"What?"
"Not lying anymore," Draco said, tipping his head back and closing his eyes to focus on the sensation of Harry inside him, of nerve endings rarely touched brought to life, of the delicious drag on his muscles sparking a tingling sensation at his neck and down his spine. "Remember? We're not lying now. I—
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, let out his breath. He always takes the high road when it comes to his kids. "Right. So have you heard anything from the adoption agency?"
Potter's face scrunched with confusion. "What?! No—I—"
Harry wrinkled his nose. "Let's not talk about that. We're supposed to be enjoying Aster."

"Why aren't you happier about being made LabMag leader?"
"Wren is perfectly comfortable and lives in a fucking estate in Wiltshire. She loves coffee and her work and coordinates the cafe's charitable contributions, which I donate my time to assist with because Gringotts financial planners take a hefty percentage."
Harry turned towards Draco, propping his head up on his hand. "Let me get this straight. You read smutty novels?"

"After Astoria and I divorced, Scorpius either spent Christmas with the Greengrasses, or he and I went to the Manor to see my parents. I suppose I was a bit jaded by all of it."
"She's probably having nightmares of pontificating men with really bad beards," Draco said, entering the room and sitting on the coffee table next to them. Imagine—sitting on the coffee table! Because he wanted to be as close to them as possible! Who

"It's just—love is such a terrible thing to position yourself against, politically. Like, look how we just felt." Harry pressed his nose into Draco's shoulder. "That feeling—through nothing but each other and our bodies. Nothing I could buy could ever make me feel like that, you know?"
"If you had your wand, you wouldn't need to tap into my house's magic," I point out, but he ignores me.
to think I’m attractive,” Harry says. “Because I’m the only person you ever see naked or have sex with. But I mean like, really attractive. I know we’re not as fit as we used to be.”
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. "She's something."
She turns around, still topless, her breasts looking, Harry thinks, bigger than usual. But that's probably in his head. "No, Harry, you can't. They need you there. We can figure this out later." She tugs a red sports bra over her head and uses her hands to stuff her boobs into it, frowning when one spills over the top. Maybe not in his head.
, exactly. But it did seem somewhat miraculous.
"Do I look like an idiot?" Draco said. "I have never employed an un-unionised elf. Can you imagine the political scandal?"
This absurd sight causes Harry to wonder why he's standing here,
Malfoy opened his mouth to answer, but just then a to-go cup flew over on paper wings. When it hovered in front of his hands, the wings transformed into a sleeve. Malfoy grabbed his drink, said a terse, "Take care," and walked quickly out of the cafe.
Harry blinks. He's tempted to look at the ceiling and shake his fist at the universe. What the fuck? How can this be his life? What is he supposed to do—go sit there next to his erstwhile enemy whom he'd fucked just last night? And, oh god, he can see half a hickey on Malfoy's ridiculously white neck.
Lorraine appeared at his side with a wide smile. It was a little creepy to Harry how she did that without being specifically called, but James didn't seem to mind. "Master James, of course I help!"
"I'm sorry. It's just, I finally realised why he's good for you." She starts laughing again.
"Yeah, I guess." Harry runs a hand through his hair. "I kinda forgot we had sex."
"Don't you dare," Albus hissed, pointing his finger at Lily and then at Harry. "Don't do—"
The Floo roared, and Harry turned towards it, surprised. Draco's head appeared in the flames.
Draco's phone buzzed, and Harry leaned over to read the text over his shoulder. Text from Scorpius. "Dad, WHAT are you two trying to do? Give everyone in the country a heart attack? Though I guess I can see the advantage in controlling the message this way. Albus is reading over my shoulder and he says it seems quite Slytherin. I was thinking it was quite Gryffindor. I suppose it's just right then, but ugh. Did you really need to mention incest? Are you and Harry okay?"
Draco glared at him. "You told me anything else would break the Statute."
“Yes,” Harry agreed, sleepy and sarcastic, “systems in place to make sure finances are legal are
"I'm wallowing," Harry grumbled, looking up at Draco's upside-down face. "I'm beating myself up. I'm doing what my therapist used to call
"Aaaaand, I'm going home." Hermione released Harry from the hug. "Unless you need me."
Harry couldn't help it—he laughed, a free, happy, warm-with-family laugh. It was all going to be alright, wasn't it?
Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair, and slumped. Well, if Harry had moved his body in that way, he would've been slumping. Draco was too posh to slump. On him it looked like some kind of casual lean—you might say he draped himself. Wanker. "Rump knows it's shitty. He wants to make sure everyone knows what an enormous twat waffle he is. That's why they voted for him, after all."
"I wanted to move out of here, get my own place."
Draco shrugs. "I suppose so."
Harry knew he didn’t really have an answer to that question. “I don’t know. Hogwarts. The Burrow.”
"You're such a fucking cheater," Harry laughs through gritted teeth, reaching for the pepper as he tries not to fall over. The pie is assembled, he just needs to—
"I'm fine," Harry said, picking up his fork and cutting into the quiche. "But just to be totally clear. You're flirting with me, right? This isn't like, some strange Slytherin social ritual that I don't understand?"
Harry frowned. "We'll circle back to that. But that's irrelevant."
"HARRY!"
Harry gapes, torn between shock at being pelted with baked goods and a double-take at Malfoy's assessment of Harry's dateability. "Well if that's all I need, you must think I should be dating you."
There's a bang, like someone just stood up, then a crash like they hit the wall.
Harry started laughing, overcome with anticipation and amusement at Draco's months of baby preparation, and grabbed the Wine Gums. A moment later, they were spinning, knocking over at least a dozen nosy onlookers as they disappeared centrifugally.
James shrugged, a huge grin on his face. Harry would blame himself for poor parenting, if James hadn't had the Fred-and-George genes in his blood. "Look up."
Harry’s eyes dropped to Draco’s lip. He wanted to test it. He wanted to lean in and kiss Draco, swipe his tongue over that lip. He might taste of pineapple or papaya.
Draco's eyes flew open. "What? No! They're fine. I think. I haven't spoken to them in a few days, have you?" He narrowed his eyes. "What aren't you telling me?"
Harry sighs and gestures for the book. "Give me the book. It's got to be about hunting or video games. Or gang violence, maybe."
She was doing a similar exercise, only with the aim of stopping her obsessive worrying. Except Hermione, ever the good student, had filled in every column of every row and had to append extra parchment to contain her thoughts on the matter. Ron’s workshop focussed on overcoming fears, or something, but Ron’s parchments were completely blank.
"Go on then," I insist with impatience.
The truth bubbles up like a balloon being inflated in the vicinity of Harry's sternum. He can't
“What’s,”
"Har har. Well, er." Harry let his eyes wander away, trying to figure out how on earth to answer the question. Should he answer according to when he admitted to himself how much he liked Draco? According to their official story? How could he answer his child with a story based on a lie? What kind of person was he?! He took a deep breath. "I think it's like—one day you look up and realise that your lives already
,” Draco said. “There are charms to block smells.”
"Potter, what have you done with my
Draco complied, bringing his tongue more in line with the frenulum. He squeezed the fingers of one hand around the base, his other hand on Harry's thigh.
Wilhelm knew
"Yeah, okay, I've heard enough," Harry said, tugging his DMLE badge out of his pocket and throwing it to the floor in front of Rump's feet. "Whatever you think 'Western magic' is, I want no part of it."
“Draco,” Harry asked, propping his head on his hand, “are you maybe not much of a morning person?”
Harry laughed. "Yeah, I cast Sectumsempra right in front of Penelope."
He opens his door, saying loudly for the benefit of any onlookers, "Yeah, I think that book you loaned me is right over here."
Scorpius looked up, his eyes full of stars. "Aster. Aster Irene Potter-Malfoy."
Albus shrugged, unconcerned. "It's just a question, Dad."
"We're in the cocoon," she whispers, and pulls out of the hug, looking red and tear-streaked and beautiful. She takes a deep breath, wiping her cheeks with her hand. "How have you been?"
"Isn't your wrist going to get sore?" Harry asks, wishing he had one of those handheld electric mixers like Aunt Petunia's, which was avocado green.
Harry's head snaps up. "Excuse me?"
"If that's true, good! Do you want a wizarding version of Google or Amazon or Facebook? Because, fucking hell, that sounds like an actual dystopia."
"We're not," Harry says, leaning on the door frame. "We're having a party."
Against Harry's expectations, they'd kissed so many times by now. But this felt different, somehow. Softer. They weren't drunk. There weren't any cameras. It wasn't a raunchy kiss, but there was something so
Behind Potter, I see the humanised rat fall from two feet onto hands and knees, then drunkenly wobble-crawl into the wall.
Draco Summoned his bag, rummaged through it, and pulled out a stack of Duplicated briefs from an old case, flipped through them to make sure none of it would breach any client confidentiality. He pushed them across the table. "Read these. When you're done, report back with your opinion on the most legally difficult feature of magically binding contracts."
The Aurors burst into hoots and applause, and Harry couldn’t help but huff a laugh.
"It's working just fine!" Ron said, casting some sort of masking charm on the ceiling just in time to prevent the shoddy roller from getting coral paint splotches on the white ceiling. Ron turned to look at Harry, and when he did, he immediately cast a Stasis Charm at the roller, which hovered in midair on the wall. "What's wrong?"
"Do you ever feel," Harry asked, pulling his lips away from Draco's, "like your life is just beginning? Even though you're 55? Wait, no, 56."
At that very moment, Nico operatically jumped octaves, sending Lily into a fit of giggles. Harry skeptically raised his eyebrow at Draco.
a question, Ronald Weasley! Did
Potter, honestly"), and Draco manages to get Harry's out too and it's a hot mess of limbs and mouths. It's glasses and jeans being tugged off and laughing against kisses. It's stumbling to the bed and rummaging in the drawer for lube. It's playful snark whilst getting situated on the bed so that they can get both their cocks in one hand. It's heads thrown back in ecstasy and then in laughter as the music in the other room changes to fucking Tubthumping again. It's
"It's appointed by Rump," Harry sighed. "Historically, almost always the Head Auror. That's Persephone Diggle. She's a good Auror. I don't think she'd be…erm…." He trailed off, unsure how to say it diplomatically.
For a long moment, there was silence. Harry looked at the counter the Stopwatch Charm had projected into the air. It read 01:15:02.
"I fancied Harry when I was fifteen," Draco said, ignoring the shocked look from Harry in his peripheral vision. "I pretended I didn't, but I knew I did. I ignored it. We were in a war." He stopped. "But if you've fancied someone before, it's not like you're going to forget that, in the future. Even if you don't fancy them anymore. Anyway, so I would see Harry around after the war was over and even though my life was elsewhere—and I didn't
Potter whoops with joy, and it's strange because the whoop is in my brain as well as in my ears. He's holding a silvery, translucent, glowing chain.
"It's hard to tell from what the
Her face is completely red now. "It wasn't a baby. It was like, six cells in a trench coat."
our first date. When we leave, the date can commence. I can’t believe you tricked me into coming here.”
Harry looked at the shirt balled in his hand. Harry had pretty much never not washed his own clothes. Harry had washed his clothes (and the entire family’s laundry) at the Dursley’s. He vaguely remembered hearing boys snicker about the awkwardness of trying to wash their own bedsheets when they reached a certain age, and he had sort of looked at them in confusion—they hadn’t always done their own laundry? For his first several years at Hogwarts, he thought his clothes were being laundered not by house-elves, but by Hogwarts magic, so he was used to the process by the time he realised elves were implicated, and he mostly pushed the unfair labor of creatures out of his mind. Once he’d left Hogwarts, he’d always again washed his own clothes. Ginny’d hated doing the wash, and they’d had a strict “each person responsible for their own” routine. But now? His clothes in the same basket with Draco’s? Being cleaned by someone else?
Maybe Harry can get a job at one of the shops in Diagon, earn some money, get a flat. Ginny can go back to school after the baby is born. Harry has all that money from his parents' and Sirius's vaults; they'd be okay, moneywise.
Harry smiled and grabbed his glasses. "Okay." He took a deep breath to prepare himself to see the photo that hung in the upstairs corridor of the four Triwizard champions—Fleur said she needed to guard against forgetting—and followed Bill towards the merry children's voices.
It's expected of
"Your favourite Backstreet Boy, Potter, come on." Draco's laughing, too. "Granger here had the audacity to suggest that Howie is better looking than Kevin."
"Har, har, har." Draco crossed his arms. "You know—you
“It shouldn’t make us act strange, unless imaginative is strange. Which I suppose it is, for us, these days. It doesn’t affect behaviour or desire like Felix Felicis would.”
Harry laughed, both aloud and in emoji, then pocketed his phone and looked up. The entire personnel of the DMLE lobby was staring at him. After a long moment, Belinda, the administrative head, pressed her wand to an intercom on her desk and said, "Rodney, can you call in the DMLE PR crisis team? I think we may have need of them today." She withdrew her wand, then tapped it again. "Lara, I need you to assist Jorgen today….Whatever he wants….You'll see."
"Same," Harry said—but that was a bit of a lie. This whole thing with Draco had been distracting him slightly from the Rump nightmare, which was a blessing, in a way.
"Yes, alright," Malfoy said, seeming to build himself up. "Let's sit and have coffee."
“I’ve worn these every day for the past two years!” Harry looked down at his trainers in disbelief. “I haven’t—”
When they get inside, Malfoy bursts out laughing. "Oh my goodness. What was that? Was that you trying to be subtle? Merlin help us. Merlin save us from Harry Potter's attempts at subtlety."
"Aren't there other coffee shops
fucker!") when Harry grabbed his phone and thumbed through his messages. As usual, horrifying news alerts ("Three wizards apprehended by DMLE officers for using an Egyptian spell in Diagon Alley; Dennis Creevey says—"), weather updates, a vaguely disturbing update from the AstroDiv app that Lily had installed ("Today Mars leaves a difficult aspect pattern, but you haven't accepted that your emotional satisfaction is your responsibility"). A message from Lily.
Every face in the vicinity swiveled to look at him and a person at the security desk rose from his seat.
Harry shrugged. "Fine. Good." Harry nudged Malfoy's elbow to let him know it was his turn to order.  From his place behind, Harry could hear Malfoy greet Wren and again order his usual.
Malfoy wasn't talking either, and that made Harry feel marginally better.
Harry's just getting into the rhythm of it, he thinks, when Malfoy moans "Stop!" like Harry's imagination imagines a porn star would. It's a mixed signal to say the least, so Harry pauses, but doesn't remove his mouth. "Stop!" Malfoy repeats, more in control of himself this time.
Ginny wrinkles her nose. "Pee sticks?! What are you talking about? We use a charm. I've never done it before, though—if I really wanted to be sure I'd call Hermione in to do it, but I don't really want to."
Harry refused to open his digital owlmail until he'd had a cup of coffee or three. It was not a good day to be the head of Magical Law Enforcement in Britain. There were sure to be celebrations by Rump supporters and protests by angry, sad, and disillusioned leftists. Hell, if it weren't Harry's job to keep the streets of Diagon and other magical places safe and clear, he'd join the protests.
"Why is that werewolf wearing fur robes?" Draco asks, panting, as he touches the floor, sticking one leg out to the side.
"One, you would never have asked me to dinner, because you would never have risked a messy relationship with me harming your relationship with Scorpius." Harry held up one finger. "Two, you didn't know about the love potion thing."
“Do you want me to?”
Draco snorted and opened his mouth to reply, but they were interrupted by the sound of the Floo.
"So I take it you don't know any secret ways out of here." Potter's look is challenging.
Harry leaned his head back on the wall. "Lils will get over it."
"Is it lamb?" Draco wrinkles his nose. "The house-elves once taught me a spell for reheating lamb, but I can't remember what it is."
“How many times can we say ‘arse cheeks’ in one conversation?” Draco asked, the side of his mouth turning up into a grin.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "And a little scalp massage will cheer you up?"
Tea. They should have tea. He wished he'd brought his wand. He rose, filling the kettle from the tap.
"It wasn't
Draco flops onto his back next to Harry, but he doesn't say anything.
"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Mr Malfoy," Harry said, standing straighter than usual and adopting a public-speaking tone that he never used when actually speaking in public. "First, I'm concerned that the party position on climate change mitigation doesn't go far enough."
Harry's face gets even hotter. "I didn't mean—oh, fuck." He sits at the kitchen table. "I didn't mean I forgot it. I obviously didn't forget it; it was amazing sex. I just—I don't know. I think I compartmentalised it. Like, we did that before we were classmates, and that was something else. Now we're learning how to, you know, coexist."
Harry stared for a moment too long. "Ah, right. Because, that's what bodies do. Kissing, arousal, what not. It's…biology."
tell me you wouldn’t let a trusted house-elf help with an infant. If you think you wouldn’t, you’re fucking lying to yourself. No one is that much of a martyr, not even the Saviour.”
"Good day, laddy!" Wilhelm said as Harry stepped into his office. "It's 8:46 in the am. Top o' the morning!"
When I turn back, Potter's contemplating the corpse. Not like before, with disgust, but like he's really
and fucking hell, Harry is hot for him—and
Harry's cheeks were red, and he felt a bit confused by all this, but he smiled. They were doing the right thing. "Yes, photos. I'll even let him kiss me again."
on a committee? After what happened last time, with the charity fundraiser for the animal shelter? When the International Confederation of Wizards had to get involved?”
“I had to cast an Impermeable Sound Barrier. Silencing Charm wasn’t enough. Would you rather your eardrums malfunction or listen to James’s music?”
Draco dipped the point of his index finger in the butterbeer and flicked it at Harry's face.
Hell, he could move into drafty old Grimmauld Place, live off his vault, and do nothing but chat with an ancient elf and cursed paintings.
"Well apparently we didn't." Ginny sighs. She doesn't look mad at him, but Harry feels her words like a knife to the gut.
