Harry's P.O.V.*
Hermione sat on the couch exhausted and we walked in. "So whats going on?" I asked, sitting next to her.
He cuddled to me and said, "Okay Draco, I love you."
"Because. I don't love him as much as I thought I did. So Draco Malfoy." I took out the rings and said, "Will you marry me?"
I was so scared all day about what Malfoy would do. I told Hermione and Ron what happened and they made sure to keep an eye out. But no one said anything. No one teased me or anything. Wich just made me more nervous.
"Why did you not want to get out of bed?" Hermione asked.
I hugged him and he cuddled me. "I'll let you keep all the bunnies. And when we go to Hogsmead I'll give you anything you want. Just pleas don't neglecte me." He said and kissed my cheek.
"Harry I did not kiss her. She kissed me Harry. please belive me." He said.
"I'm missed you too," I said leaning my head on his chest since he is taller than me. "Why do you have to be taller than me?" I grumbled.
We got into bed Harry cuddling up to me.
He pulled away and got up. I followed him to the dinning room. "You two are very cute together you know." Narcissa said.
"Well it's your fault for taking so long." Hermione said.
He nodded and motioned for me to go ahead and sat against a bed post. I took off my pants and boxers I already did not have a shirt on. And Draco did not take his eyes off me. As I grabbed my dick and began stroking my self. Moaning as I thought of Draco. I noticed him getting hard and he began touching himself through his pants. I began moving me hips as he striped and got on top of me moving my hand. "Your so hot you know that? I love you so mutch." He said and began kissing me and playing with my dick. And moving his hips on mine. He then ,moved down and licked my dick from the balls up and began sucking. I moved my hips but he held them down.
"Did you or did you not try to rape Harry Potter?" McGonagall asked.
He growled and ripped off our clothes. He put my dick in his mouth and began sucking.
The next day we went and got our own compartment and watched the scenery. "I can't believe this is going to be are last year." Hermione said, shaking her head.
"Great. I could also get Harry a familiar. He's been saying he wants one." Draco said.
At lunch, Blaise was making up stuff up about what happened. "I'll go talk to him. You three can start heading to Hagrid's." Draco said and got up.
I then went to the Great Hall for breakfast and saw Harry talking to Cedric. After Cedric left I went up to Harry. "What did you talk to him about?" I asked.
"Thank you. Now we're should we look for Harry at?" Mason asked.
"Ginny tried to rape Harry." Blaise said, probably being the most composed.
Draco tide me to me to the bed completely naked. He rubbed against me also naked while he kissed and sucked my neck. I moaned and he put his fingers inside of my stretching my butt hole. When he pulled those out he replaced them with his dick thrusting inside of my making me a moaning mess.
"To see if there is anything that can help us win the war." Harry said.
"Have you been on other dates?" Draco asked.
He then turned over again and hugged my arm. He eventually stopped moving and cursed under his breath.
"It is too scary, and too bad and so so horrible that we spiders do not speak of it. So alas we can not tell you. So I'll let those spiders eat you now. Good-bye friends of Hagrid." The spider said.
So I quickly took out my wand and obliterated him three times. He flew back against the wall and the whole tunnel collapse separating me from Harry. Me and Ron and Lockhart at the exit and Harry deeper in the chamber. "Harry, you okay?" I said.
Hermione hit him and said, "shut up Ron. It is not just a kink."
"Go to your rooms. Except you four." Dumbledore said.
I frowned but cuddled back a little upset that he does not want to. But I can't force him. That would be rape.
I pinned him down to the bed and began kissing him hard. He groaned and kissed back, pulling me close to him.
I pulled away and said, "Harry, not right now. Remus and Sirius will not like that " then I lean down, and lick some blood that had spilled from the wound. I, then continued to drink.
"So Ron and Hermione how have you two been? Did you two buy the house you wanted?" I asked.
Harry p.o.v
We woke up on the couch and ate breakfast. "So my husband what would you like to do today?"
"Morning." I said and sat Draco doing the same.
After a bit of cuddling we decided to get up and get ready for the day. So we took a shower washing eachother, and got dressed in comfortable cloths. We then went down for breakfast seeing that every one is already eating. "We decides to start without you. Thinking you two were to busy." Hermione said looking at me with disaproble.
"Harry is gay and he is not afraid but you are? That's hilarious." I said and started to laugh.
Mr. Weasley came in and told us we have to go quickly.
"Yah. Just ran into Malfoy today. Just can't get something that he did out of my head." I said.
Pansy interrupted what I was going to say. "Don't give us any of that 'it makes me feel weak' bullshit. It's what a mate does so just deal with it." She said. "Now seriously. Why do you have so many bight marks on you?" Ron asked.
"But I want Harry," I complained. "I mean he is all alone without me."
"Yes it does." She said and flipped to the page. "Every thing. All the creatures and how the lake got there." She added.
"Harry how are you not in Slytherin?" Father said.
I noticed that my friends have not said a thing. Blaise is staring at Ron and Pansy is looking at her nails.
When we got in we found a secret chamber full of students in all houses . I saw Luna comforting Nevill and Dean and semus comforting eachother. Then some random kid yelled, "Harry Potter is here!" Everyone began cheering.
"Transfiguration." I said.
He then cuddled me and said, "Ok, I love you Draco."
"Payback?" Fred and George said appearing out of nowhere.
Mr. Malfoy turned to me and said, "you. That was very Slytherin of you. Draco I hope you stay good to him. And good by Dobby. I'll see you Harry and you Draco over the summer. Good day." And he left.
"Harry!" Hermione yelled running after us, Ron being dragged.
I just laughed and said, "why not?"
"I wonder who Hermione is taking." Harry said.
We apeareated at diagon ally and ran into hogs head to see the bartender washing cups. "What are you doing here?"
"What is it?" Mason asked.
"It's okay. Just sleep." I said and closed my eyes.
Ron then said, "You're making him too Slytherin."
"No dear we are going yo apeareate." Mom said.
"Yes well you all helped. I don't know we're I'd be without you all." I said and kissed Draco.
All the Weasley's came in along with the Minister. Ginny was then  De- petrified and she sat up. Draco gave her wand to the Minister. "Ginny. I have been told every thing, so I condem you to Azkaban." The minister said.
"They're talking things out about their relationship. There going to meet us at Hagrid's so we came here to see if Draco is done mother-henning you, Harry," Pansy answered smiling good-naturedly.
"He did not manipulate me. Plus I don't know what you mean by, 'I'm wrapped around his little finger.'" I said.
He jumped and wrapped his arms around me, snuggling into me. "I'm fine." He mumbled.
"Visiting Hagrid, and you?" Harry said.
"I know the first task." He said, walking past me. The smell of smoke and fire hit me.
"Sure, I'm not positive they have much on my kind of werewolves though ,and we would need to go to the restricted section though." I answered, seeing no harm in trying.
"I'm sorry but Draco is my dominant and I must do as he says especially if it makes him happy," I said cuddling to Draco.
"Okay. We will go look at that. Go to your room." Dumbledore said.
"I love you too." I said and kissed him back.
When we got to Kings Cross I woke Harry up. "We are here love." I said.
"The Imperius Curse. It controls people." She said.
When we made it to the room, Draco closed the door and pushed me to a wall. He began kissing my lips and I kissed back. He slipped my robes off and began unbuttoning my shirt, me doing the same to him. When we both became shirtless, Draco began nipping and bitting my chest making me moan. When he got back to my lips, I took off his pants and got onto my knees. Draco put a hand on my head as I took Draco's penis in my mouth. He groaned and tried to push it in deeper, making me deep throat him. "Damn Harry you are good at this." He moaned out.
"What ever." Ron said, also sitting on the couch.
"Sir." He said.
I smiled. "How long have you been able to do that?" Sirius asked.
"To bad we were not there." Hermione said.
"Still! Who is she going with? He better be good to her." Ron said.
"So Draco there is going to be a wedding at the Weasley's this weekend. Its for Bill and Flure. Apparently they are soulmates." Hermione said, bouncing a bit.
Mason came in and looked relieved that I'm here. "Oh Harry I was so worried. Are you okay?" He asked and sat next to me holding me to him.
"Really? lead the way Draco." Ron said, getting out of his state of shock.
I got up, Harry doing the same, still blushing. "Merlin that was embarrassing." He said.
I woke up relizeing I fell alseep with the stuffed animal Harry gave me. I smiled knowing that when I get Harry to be mine he will like to know that I slept with it.
"I'm fine." He mumbled.
"So you will be going as just friends?" I asked.
"Yah we loved to!" Hermione said.
"Hey Draco. What have you been up to?" Pansy said.
"Your a boy. So your being mean to yourself. Or are you not a boy?" Ron said.
I kissed his neck again and then bit his neck,  causing him to squeal. "Dray! unfair." He said.
The rest of our group came in. "I have a splendid idea." Hermione said. She took coins out of her pockets and enchanted them. "If any of us need to tell the other something and we are not together, just take out your wand, think what you want to say and it will appear on the coin." She said, handing us all one.
"Harry if you are not you can tell me." He said.
She walked away and Dumbledore gave Harry second place.
"Thanks. So what are we going to do now?" Harry said.
"I mean, I don't know what to do Harry. I need a date. But who should I ask?" Ron said.
I moved him so that he is looking at me. "It's okay Harry. You will be okay. There is nothing to be sorry about." I said and wiped the tears away.
Madam pomfry came in making me move and she checked on Harry.
He say on the couch and said, "he done nothing. I used the spell on him. And I saw a few memories. Then he told me to get out. That I am done with the lessions." He explained.
"Yes. He will go into somthing like a heat once a month." Mad eye said.
"Yes father." I said. The only reason he join last time was because The dark lord threatened me and mother.
"I don't know, but I bet she is snogging him now." Ron said angerly.
For the rest of the ride, we just talked about random topics, then when we got to the station I grabbed Harry's trunk and mine, and he grabbed the owl cages.
The girls glared at them and Hermione said. "I hate you."
He seemed a little worried, but tried to hide it with a smile. "Are you okay harry?" I asked.
"I love you to Draco." He mumbled falling back to sleep.
"Stay here and cuddle." I said, getting closer and laying my head on his chest.
Harry p.o.v
He smiled and done as I asked. He grabbed my penis making me moan louder. I felt myself close to coming and said. "Draco. Oh Draco! I then came over the both of us Draco doing the same inside of me. He pulled out and collapsed next to me.
I was not sure to be offended that he practically said I am a girl but I don't care. "What will happen to the Dursleys?" I asked.
Draco nodded and got up and woke ron. Draco sat next to me as Ron sat up and said, "what are you guys doing here?"
I watched as Draco got things for me that I thought looked nice, but didn't want him to get me. he kept saying things like: "This will go great with your eyes." Or "This will look nice with your hair." And "this complements your skin tone."
"Harry you should not use those spells. You don't know what they can do. You should put that book back. You will have to sooner or later anyways." Hermione said.
When I went shopping with Hermione and Ginny, they forced me to get a dress. Ron was not happy about that.
"I am sure they will. Just as long as you are happy I am sure." He said squeezing my shoulder.
"Now that we are all here let's go eat." Pansy said.
Harry glared at him and took a bread roll and started to eat it.
"So have you two got any plans for yours?" Sirius asked.
"Did you get one for yourself?" Harry asked.
I smiled and said, "but you are perfect as you are Mason."
"Why are you two doing this?" Blaise asked.
"Oh honey, you're awake! We believe that your Aunt Bellatrix turned you into a werewolf with a spell. But don't fret, you're different from the others. Unlike them, you can change whenever you want, with the first few times being slightly painful. That is to be expected though. You are still forced to change on the full moon, but you won't be crazed and will be able to mostly keep control over your body. Oh and one more thing, like all other werewolves you will have a soul mate, which is considered to be a blessing and a curse. We will explain that at another time." my mum, Narcissa, explained, running her fingers through my untamed hair in a soothing manner.
The next day we apparated to a muggle place, then the buildings separated to make a new building. "That was cool." I said.
There was a knock so Hagrid then said, "put that cloak of yours back on." We did as he opened the door.
I frowned and looked at the table, positive he is going to kick me out. I know it's abnormal and freaky. No one else does it, except for kids of course. "I'm sorry sir, I'll stop it."
"I could get changed on my own." He said.
Though I just ignored him and ate. "Come on Harry he is your mate just talk to him." Hermione said rolling her eyes.
"Depends on what Harry wants." Draco said, putting an arm around me.
Then about thirty minutes later Harry appeared with Cedric crying. I ran over to him shoving people out of the way and pulled him to my chest. Though it was quite hard because he wanted to stay latched to Cedric's body saying something along the lines if, "no I promised him! I promised I'll take him to his father!"
"Alright I am done with girls. I think I am going to just be gay. Harry gay me up. Let's get this gay show on the gay rode." Ron said and Harry is looking at him like he has grown two heads.
I sighed, barely paying attention. Why can't this go by faster?!
I ditched Ron telling him I have to use the loo. Though really I want yo talk to Malfoy. And with Ron that would be hard because he is a think headed idiot.
"Yes I have. I go there most summers and me and him share a room. I'm sorry if you don't like that." He said.
He jumped up screeching, "where is it!?"
"And that's a bad thing?" I asked thinking he should be proud.
"Are you stalking us now?" Ron asked.
"Fine fine." Ron said getting up. We then got ready. Separately. And went to see Hermione in the common room on the couch reading.
She came over to us and said dreamily, "Have you guys seen Lockhart? I think he just the most handsome man in the world."
I shook my head and said, "this is me we are talking about. If he tells Ron and Hermione I'm sure Ron will spread things."
"So Harry is going to spend the summer with you Draco?" Ron said.
"I expected him to take points away. Though I guess it's because I'm Draco's mate." Harry said.
Draco nodded as we walked in. He sat me down at the Gryffindor table with Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Pansy. "Hey Harry. How are you feeling?" Hermione asked.
"Can we please stop talking about this." I said, hating this conversation.
Hermione took out her wand and said, "immobulus." And they all froze.
My parents came and took me away, as Potter's group took him. I looked back at him, and saw that he is skipping away hugging a stuffie.
I rolled my eyes and said, "if you decide to actually do it don't do it in the tent."
"Yeah. Every time Harry plays he almost dies. Actually, I think it's anytime he is near the game because this year we were watching Quidditch and he nearly died." Ron said.
He began kissing my neck and slipped off my shirt.
Today is Harry's birthday, so right now me and father are out looking for a present for him. I'll also get a present for Harry so I can give it to him at the end of summer.
I walked in. "Dumbledore. Harry is upset because he thinks you are ashamed of him and I am tired of it." I said.
"Okay I'm not. I mean, I'm supposed to save the Wizarding world, but I was not even able to save Cedric or stop this." I said and broke down crying.
Ron and Blaise then came down and sat with us. "Morning everyone. Did you have a good time last night Harry? You didn't do anything bad right?" Ron said like an over protective brother.
"It may have ended badly but now at least we know Hagrid's innocent," I said and looked at Draco.
"Mr. Crouch - I think he's dead," Harry gasped.
"Draco explained it to me. It's quite interesting actually." Ron said and laughed.
Harry p.o.v
"I love you to Draco" Harry said.
Over the course of the next few days,we figured out where the horcrux is, which is Gringotts (in Bellatrix's vault).
"Go to your next class." I said.
Then we fell asleep in each other's embrace.
Harry p.o.v
"Okay let's go to bed." I said.
I pulled Harry close to me and kissed his cheek. "Do you need help?" I asked noticeing his confused expression while looking at his potions work.
"Hello Ginny. How was your week so far?" Harry asked her nicely.
"Mortals. Non-magic people." I answerd.
"What what's wrong?" Ron said.
"Staying here is fine." I said.
"I think I would have done fine with just Hermione and Draco. you I probably could have done without." I said joking.
I am woken up by the door opening. Ron yelled bloody hell covering himself up. I just looked saw Hermione and laid back down.
"Well dragging me around the castle will not help," I said and pulled out of Draco's grasp. "So what are we going to do now?" I asked.
The past few months were good. Mother got a friend for Harry's rabbit. And Harry and I have had a few make-out sessions. Though Ron has ended them when they were getting good. And Harry got a new broom. The Firebolt which is the best. He even likes it better than his old one. He even won the last of the games with it.
And knowing it's pointless to argue, even though I have slept for three days, we followed and we all went to sleep.
"We went and ripped the curtains off Ron and Blaise's bed while they were snogging." I explained, smiling the whole time.
I woke up to silence, absolute silence, and it was frankly quite frightening; I immediately checked the time and felt my heart speed up, no wonder it was so quiet, I was going to be late If I didn't hurry. Automatically when I saw the time, my body started moving and I ran to my wardrobe shuffling to find some suitable clothes quickly. I then bolted down to the showers and got ready, not even spending my time on my hair. As I was running out I noticed that practically no one was in the Slytherin common room, except a few wanderers who glanced at me confused. Next thing I'm in the great hall and noticed that I arrived just as the Golden Trio did. I slowed down into a brisk stride and, walking up to Harry and wrapping my arms around him.
I leaned down and kissed him and began thrusting in and out making him moan against my lips.
I found him in a empty hallway, curled up in a ball, crying. "Harry what's wrong? Is it something I done?" I asked, kneeling next to him.
"Yah. That was great." I said and cuddled to him.
Draco cornered Ginny. "Listen here bitch. Harry is mine, so if you ever try to take him away I will rip you into pieces and put your head on a stake. Then I'll parade around school to show what will happen if anyone messes with my Harry again!" Then he took my arm and took us all back to our compartment.
"He is pregnant, now since the child will be part vampire, the pregnancy, instead of taking 9 months, it will take eleven. You will have stranger cravings than a normal pregnancies and it will be a good idea to drink some of Draco blood once a week. Draco will not want to drink your blood anymore, due to safety of your child. Any questions?" Madam Pomfrey explained.
"Well hello pott- aaaaaaaa." Nevill came up behind him cutting off Nagani head and Voldimort his waist line. Killing Voldimort with the sword of Griffindorks.
"Don't worry Draco he is only bluffing." I said patting his leg.
"Of course you'll be my best man. Now start planning!" I yelled and he quickly got to work.
Draco p.o.v
Then a few other girls came down and they all had the same problem as Ginny. "Who did this?" one girl demanded.
"Fine by us," Draco said.
Before I new it the end of this year is near. And hagrid brought over a half giant brother.
"Love you to." I replied.
I kissed the top of his head and he just cuddled closer.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Mason asked wrapping his arms around me.
"But your our best seeker. We need you." Ron said.
"Okay. So is she like serious or something?" I said, wanting to know what the hell she means when she speaks.
When he dropped kreacher the elf gave Draco a look of respect and disapeared.  When the elf came back he handed us the horcrox and dissaperd  again. "Good job Draco. Maybe you kids can stay awhile and relax a bit." Remus said.
"No... I can't decide what to wear." I replied.
"No one is better than you Dray. you are perfect." Harry said.
Draco p.o.v
"Morning love." I replied.
Me and Blaise run after Draco, with his faimly being former deatheater's, I bet they won't be to happy seeing a Malfoy. We saw the Deatheater's burning down Hagrid hut and running off. Draco looked around and then ran toward them, and shouted a body binding spell, hitting Snape. We ran up to him and Draco said,"How dare you kill Dumbldore!? Harry cared about him!"
"I came to see you. Got bored. Um... what are you doing?" I asked a little confused.
"Yah just. Can't believe I have that to Malfoy."
"So you seen his room?" I asked, not sure how to feel about that.
"Oh. Well I will be happy where ever you take me Draco." Harry said, leaning a bit to me as we walked in.
"Draco!" Harry yelled and hugged me, interrupting Ron and Hermione.
He then pushed me to the couch pinning me down and began to kiss me.
The twins came over and one of them said, "the heir to Slytherin  is with Slytherins."
I'm happy that we finally get to go to Hogwarts. Our dad's told us so much about it. How they met. There adventures.
Draco p.o.v
"Yes I'm his Alpha. He listens to me." I said, smirking.
She then came back over to me as I opened the letter.
"Come on Pansy. I'm sure it's fine. Don't worry Draco any more than he probably is." Blaise said.
We all stepped back except for Harry.
"Well I guess since your kind is rare it's not so strange that there is not that much info." Hermione said shrugging.
"Have a what?"
I chose for Harry a nice green dress with silver shoes and me a green shirt and black pants with boots.
*Harry P.O.V.*
Draco p.o.v
"Don't worry I have it all under control." She said smiling.
"Unless one of us gets a job here, it will be. I'll miss this place." Harry said, leaning against me.
So I went down and the Weaslys Ron Hermione and Blaise is here. Blaise has brusis and cut marks on him and I said, "oh merlin Blaise what happened?"
"Are you all ready for the day?" Hermione said.
Draco p.o.v
"Why?" Ron said.
As soon as I walked in, mom came over and hugged me.
"Please say no, please say no, please say no," I heard Ron mutter repeatedly.
Though I ignored him also.
"No. Plus we need to go and get Hermione a present." He said, standing up.
"Don't ever call me that again." I said as his God father snickerd.
We sat at the couches. "I am not a puppy." I said.
"Where did you hear that name from?" Ron said.
"Still Ron you'll never know until you try. Just try to ask a girl." Harry said.
I sigh and lay in Draco's embrace not fighting it any more. I curl up to Draco, deciding to go back to sleep, since we are not getting up anytime soon. Unfortunately, the curtains were pulled back revealing a bushy haired Hermione, Ron and Blaise getting ready behind her. "Get up, boys," she said and walked away.
"My mum was an insane woman. Did not like muggle born or peaple who asosiated with muggles and muggle born." Sirius said.
We laughed at them for a bit, then continued up.
"When she takes a shower of course," I said as though that was obvious. And it was.
Harry p.o.v
"Sure. I hope you don't mind me asking. Why the sudden change in sex?" Blaise asked.
"Merpeople, Giant Squid, and a bunch of other creatures." Harry said.
"Well, I thought you were a good friend to respect my wishes," Ron said.
"It's a thing that you can use to look at other peoples memory's. I can show you." I said.
"Dwaco there being mean." Harry whined.
I shook my head then walked out.
"She looks like a toad." Harry said
"Well as you all know that Voldemort is...Unwell now and Obliviated. All of his death eaters were either captured or they were put back with their lives in order if they were forced." Dumduck explained.
"Ginny and wormtail." I growled out.
I set him in the hospital wing. Ron in a bed across the room Blaise trying to get him to act normal. Bloody hell what did those brains do to him.
"I love you to harry." I replied and kissed his head.
McGonagall then put on a slower song and I wrapped both arms around Harry's waist and pulled him closer as he put both arms around my neck. He leaned his head against my chest and we just swayed side to side turning in a slow circle.
I pulled him closer as everyone became even more silent. "Harry, that cannot be said out here," Dumbledore said quietly.
"Of course. It's not like it's our first full moon." I said.
He looked at me. "I'm fine." He said.
In the end we left and after all classes we went to our room.
At lunch Umbitch came over. "All of you detention for walking out of class." She said and walked away.
"There is no need to call me sir." I replied back.
"Hermione I think he's broken," Draco said.
"Well, Harry, my fave boy-" Pansy started but was interrupted.
Blaise looks like he is ready to kill. Though both he and Pansy just walked out.
"I was great till you showed up you good for nothing bitch." Harry said.
"I don't know. There was nothing to say what it was so how can we be prepared?" Harry said.
Harry p.o.v
"Fine. Is there anything else?" I said and had him hold me closer to him.
"Sure." Ron said and followed her out.
"Pansy, Hermione, stop being mean to my Harry." I growled and they both nodded.
He then cuddled up to me znd fell asleep.
"Dray. unfair." He said.
Draco p.o.v
I felt as though the water in my body had suddenly become lava and I could hardly register the sound of my screams as I fell to the cold, hard floor. My vision became blurry and I saw blobs of color coming into my line of sight, and slowly fading out into blackness.
"Alright, class dismissed. Harry, please stay for a bit." He said.
Harry p.o.v
"Well, maybe we could wait to until after the Yule Ball. Because we should focus on getting nice clothes and me a date." Ron said.
"Thanks." He said.
"Ginny? Mom has said that she is acting strange." Ron said thoughtfully.
Harry p.o.v
I got up to see him emptying his stomach into the toilet. I rubbed his stomach and moved his hair to make sure it don't get in the way.
"We just slept nothing more. I promise we will not have a repeat of the other night." I said and hugged Harry to me.
"Well you have to go back to school tomorrow. So go pack." Remus said.
"Hello, Harry my boy. I see that you have the Gryffindor sword." Dumbledore said.
"It's okay love." Draco said.
"He will not learn if you do everything for him," Hermione replied.
"So Harry what are we going to do?" I asked.
He hugged back and kissed my forhead.
When we got into the room we heard Ron and Blaise snogging. We walked up, still in our dog forms, and ripped the curtains off, causing Blaise and Ron to scream, making every one wake up and laugh. Me and Draco howled as they cursed us. We got into my bed, still in our forms, and went to sleep. Everyone went to sleep too.
"I hope your boyfriend won't say anything." He said.
"Come on Draco. Let's just go take a shower and change." I said grabbing his arm and dragging him to the bathroom, grabbing the male uniform.
I woke up to some one shaking me and saw Sirius. "It's lunchtime. Wake Harry." He said and walked out.
I quickly went over and began untying Draco. But then I wonder when the others will get here.
"Morning Draco. Today is our date day." I said smiling.
"Harry, I think we need to talk." Remus said setting down his fork.
But I promise I'll have a fuller one next time.
After classes we went to out new shared common room. We sat on the couches our significant others cuddling. Harry is on my lap, Blaise and Ron are just sitting real close. Same as Pansy and Hermione.
"Yes her name is Debra." Mom said.
"Will you let me have some of your blood," Draco said and licked my neck.
Once we found a new spot we stopped and began making dinner. Me and harry rested against a tree and he cuddled to me his head against my chest.
I came up with the girl, and I helped her swim to the docks and climb up myself. Hermione came over and asked, "where is Harry?"
He hugged back saying he is sorry.
I honestly was thinking of tying Harry to the bed or something. I don't think Harry will mind.
Hermione p.o.v
"So you are the smart one with clothes. What should we get?" I asked.
So I got off of him and cuddled him, both of us going to sleep.
Draco and I went up to the Gryffindor tower and I got my cloak and map. "Are you going to come back to my room?" Draco asked.
"Morning Harry." Draco said and kissed the top of my head.
We then got off the train and I finally get to have a great summer.
"I will see what can be done. How about you all go back to your dorms - more information will be given tomorrow." Dumbledore said.
Ron and Blaise went to get there own apartment, for some alone time. Leaving me Draco Hermione and Pansy. I cuddled draco. I thought about getting our own compartment but thought it would be a bad idea.
After we went back to our work.
"That does not give you the reson to punch him." Hermione explained.
He moved away from me, and turned into a wolf that was as tall as me while I was standing.
"Maybe. Now go this will lead you to hogwarts." The bartender said and showed us a tunnel.
When we walked into Slughorn's class, Harry seemed to be quite happy. He set his book on the table and I realized it's because it's the half blood prince book, which is cheating.
I giggled and nuzzled his neck. "tank you dwaco." I said and giggled more.
"Thanks Hermione. How did you get here?" I said.
"Yes." He answered.
"I'm fine. I'll go get Ginny." And he ran off.
"No." The three of them said in unison.
I turned her way and saw a picture of me and Draco kissing then pulling apart on a loop. I looked at him, but he just shrugged, then continued eating. 'if he doesn't care, then why should I.' I thought. "It's fine Hermione. People were bound to find out soon anyway." I said.
"You two are so cute." Mom said and took a picture of us. Then three more.
"This is what I mean! You are- you are bloody stupid!" he finally stormed out just as Harry and Draco came in.
"Maybe," I said pouting.
"Hello Draco." Hermione said.
"Well Ron is not the boss of you and I am your mate." He said.
"Harry you better tell us what's wrong. We can help." Pansy said.
I sat down next to him and pulled him onto my lap. "It's fine love." I said.
"Ginny why would you say such a thing?" Hermione said as we walked in.
I woke up in an all white room with somthing snuggled beside me, hugging me to it.
The school year went by pretty boring. We had nothing to do but classes and I got the reward for winning. Though I felt as though I did not deserve it. And Cedric died.
Harry looked at the floor. We walked into the bathroom and a ghost is flowing around.
"Come on. The only class we have today is with McGonagall and she's teaching a special class." Hermione said and dragged me and Ron out, Draco laughing and following behind.
We sat down Harry flinching a little. "Does this sound familiar? 'oh Draco! Harder!'" one if the twins said making Harry blush.
The next day, we went to the Great Hall for breakfast.
"Fine. Do you think everyone will be alright with me wearing one?" He asked.
"Why are people so stupid?" She asked, sitting across from us.
So Ron stood up and almost fell. "Wow, this is high," he said. Ron began walked around almost falling a few time. After a few minutes, he sat back down and said, "it's hard work. And it does hurt."
"I did not need to know that." Hermione said. Every one else silantly agreeing.
"Harry is not here. I'll go find him." I said, getting his scent and following still in my pajamas.
Draco pinned me to the couch. "I told you to stop petting my hair," Draco said.
And we both fell asleep.
Blaise frowned and I said, "I think she is a little out of your league. Plus she is a veela. She won't want to go out with just anyone."
At night after practice with Snape, I put all of the potion viles into my trunk as Draco slept. Tomorrow  after Draco gives me the potion, I just need to grab the vile, go to the bathroom and drink it. Then I'll be just fine.
"He is not a leech he is a ferret," I said smiling and started petting him.
"I love you Harry. You dont have to do anything you don't want to." I said and hugged him to me.
"Eight. And it's Christmas Harry come on." Draco said and pulled me out of bed.
"You have to go save Ginny why are you leaving?" I asked.
"I heard that Professor Lockhart will make a defense club," Hermione said.
I kissed Harrys cheek and began eating. Everything is going to be okay. Just as long as I have MY Harry.
We got to the great hall and our friends came over.
Draco p.o.v
All throughout the year, it was all the same, from Harry going through mood swings to craving and him having to drinking my blood, to which I've been drinking Hermione's.
"I'm good professor. Why did you call me here?" I asked confused.
I turned into my wolf and ran out to the dungeons.
I smiled and put an arm around his waist. "If you want, I can pack every thing and you can sleep." I said and kissed his cheek.
"Sorry mate, but you look hilarious." I said.
"Let's go to my office and discuss this there. Blaise can you get the rest of the Weasley's? I am going to fire call their mother." Dumbledore said as he started to walk away.
"I'm sorry Harry, but you needed it." I said.
Just as I opened the book, I felt scratching on my hand and I dropped it.
Ron nodded and we talked more. Draco and Ron played chest and they both tyed a few times.
I stopped crying. "Why would Hermione do such a thing. She's my friend." I said
"Everyone already knows your gay. Hermione and I also knew that you're gender fluid." Ron said.
He nodded and said. "You do have your mother's eyes. I was a friend of your father's. He was a great man."
The second day of summer I found out Harry was cutting his legs. It was an awkward conversation.
Every one laughed. "Tell that to your boy toy!" I said.
"It was also my first Christmas in first year." I said.
I found Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, and Blaise and sat down with them. Luckily they didn't know I was a werewolf, so I was golden. "Hey Draco!" Pansy immediately said 'flirtatiously' and latched onto my arm.
Hermione glared at him and said, "because Umbrige was not a good teacher so far so. We need to catch up."
"It's like they never learn. One of these days they are going to regret everything they have done." She said and took out a book and read.
"Aww. Does Hawwy wove his Dracy poo?" Ron said, laughing.
"Your welcome." I said and laughed.
"But Harry! You belong with me!"  I heard a growl from back behind me and Draco came over and took me by the waist hugging me to him.
We found our freinds and took off the cloak. "Did you get the diadm?" I asked.
"I want to give this to you," I said giving it to him.
Dumbledore aloud me to look at some memories.
"Well she was walking and you know how I like it when they walk. But then I just asked her out." Ron said, seeming to be in a daze.
We got ready then went to bed. He fell asleep, then I fell asleep shortly after.
"Thank." He said and put his head on my chest again.
I smirked and said, "Goodnight Harry. And just to let you know you are mine...unless you reject me, that is." I then turned and walked away. Snape gave me a strange look but said nothing.
"Some package from some secret admirer." I answerd him.
"Oh, okay." I said not having a remark to her jesting.
When we walked out every student is crowded. Nevill came up and said, "Every one is willing to fight. Even the slythrens. There is a few who did not want to betray there parents. They said to tell you they did not want to be dark."
The weeks seemed to fly by. Befor I knew it we are on the train. Going home. "I'll convince my parents to let me stay over at your place Harry." Draco said and kissed my cheek.
Draco pushed me into the couch, straddled me and began kissing me. I pulled him closer and he allowed it.
"Yes Ron he exists. Ever one has seen him and he was a teacher before." Pansy said like she was talking to a five year old.
I then decided that I want to try to top, so I flipped us over. "What do you think your doing?" Draco said smiling.
Harry p.o.v
"Don't try! do!" Ron said then stormed out.
Hermione glared at him and said, "Shut up Ron." Then hit him.
So now I'm in my room at Grimuald place since I'm living with Sirius and Remus, flipping through a book. Though I'm not really paying attention.
I shook my head and said, "but, we planned so much. I'll feel bad if we don't."
Lockhart took a picture and said, "you four could just put them back." And went to his office.
"Yes dray?" I said.
"Morning," Harry said and started to eat.
"Yes. They did not know for a while that I could not do magic outside of school. So they thought I could hurt them or there poor duddykins." I said.
He laughed and then began kissing me again, taking off our shirts and pants. He rubbed his hands up and down my body as he began kissing and sucking my neck.
"Okay. I understand why you'd want to think about it." I said smiling.
I smiled. "I'll love to be your husband." I said.
I smiled. "You are an idiot. You could have been injured. I think I should have you put out of Quidditch. I will-" he again shut me up by kissing me.
I kissed Harry's cheek and went back to eating.
Though Harry would just laugh it off.
"I'm fine." I said taking my hand back.
When we got to the school I summoned Blaise over to us. "Ron will like to ask you a question." I sad and Blaise sat next to Ron.
But fine we will stop talking about Ron and McGonagall. We'll talk about Draco and Harry instead!" They said, one after the other. "Dog boy and the Boy Who Lived!" They said together.
I nodded and she just shrugged. So we bought it.
"Yes." Father answered.
"Okay." He said looking at his feet.
Then we went home. Me and Draco staying in his summer home since his parents have the Malfoy Manor.
Once I finished I walked out and started my way back to the common room. But I feel as though I am being followed. When I turn to look though I don't see anyone. Then I felt a hand over my mouth and darkness surrounded me.
"You two are so cute. And nice nickname Dracy poo." Pansy said.
"Hi," I said.
Harry p.o.v
We ate then decide to get up. I got dressed in the male uniform. And we went downstairs to see Ron and Blaise cuddling on a couch across from Hermione and Pansy talking.
"Hey its okay my dear Harry. Come here." I said and hugged him. He began crying against my chest. "I'm going to pick you up okay?" I said.
"Really Harry? Why did you not introduce this to me sooner? It's amazing!" Draco said.
We walked out. "Since we are done, what do you want to do?" Draco asked.
"I'm done. You guys?" Harry asked. They both nodded, so we got up and I led them to Snape's office.
"I'm guessing Malfoy that you will need blood." She said and I nodded.
"But Hawwy." He groaned.
"Thank you. But I think Harry is right. Hermione will not pick any body bad." I said.
"Oh I don't know. How about Voldimort?" I said.
When we went to the mental ward and went to see Voldemort. He is more then happy to see us.
"What is this?" I asked, showing him the vile.
She smiled. "Good." She said.
"Im thinking new cloths." I said.
Once I started getting irritated,  I decided to take a walk in the woods.
"Great look what you did Malfoy!" Ron said glaring at me.
"Please don't." I said.
She looked confused and said, "well there is no possible way to get attacked any were. You are safe."
"Um. I just got one thing to ask and one thing to say." He nodded and I continued. "I just wanted to ask if you can make another batch of antidepressant potion. And the thing I wanted to say was that if you hurt Harry in his occlumency lessons I'll hunt you down and kill you." I warned.
"Malfoy. I'm sorry." I said. Then I walked out.
Then Blaise came and said, "Draco you do not just shove people into closets! Oh hi Harry you look great. Draco we are leaving right now!"
Harry walked up to the bowl. "You should not take them." I said. He did not listen and took a handful. A second later they started attacking him. He dropped them and backed away because they are biting at him still. He hit into the wall and a pensive showed up.
Lockheart then came to me and tried to get rid of it but that just made it madder. It turned to Finch and hissed saying, "you. I'll kill you!"
"He. He ran." Harry said frowning.
"Yes. especially when I could barely say a few words." Harry replied.
"Really?! You people I swear!" Hermione exclaimed.
"Yes. Just pleas pay attention to me." He said with puppy dog eyes.
I woke around the middle of the night from Ron having a nightmare. Ron sat up, looked over to  me, and started to cry.  I hugged him and said, "Hey! Its okay. You're okay, nothing is going to happen. I promise."
In the morning I woke up to Draco straddling me and leaning over me.
The Goblet of Fire
"May I take Harry out on a date," I said wishing that he does not try and correct my grammar.
I turned to see my ex Malfoy and his friend Zabini.
"Snape's yours. That's more unbelievable than this." Ron said.
"Yes. That is correct. Stupid Umbitch." Blaise said.
"Yes." He said.
He hugged me, neither of us caring that I'm naked. "Harry it's okay. I don't know what she did exactly, but it will be dealt with." He said.
"Actually I feel like a girl now," Harry said.
"Um. Okay so your alive now?" Harry said.
"Well just don't make too much noise. Some of us need sleep." Ron said.
As we ate in silence, we thought about what McGonagall has told us. I am pissed. I mean I thought that we were done with this. But no, Wormtail is the new Voldemort. I looked at Harry and he is just eating with no emotion. Hermione looks as mad as me and Ron looks scared. Blaise and Pansy also look mad. "What are we going to do?" I said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"So, Harry, you said you wanted to tell me something?" Mason said.
"That your right. Let's go to your room." He said. We went to our room, mom finishing the cake.
He nodded and put down the Prophet.
"No I'm not. If I was then I would have known what you told me yesterday and not have cut and talked to you." He said, letting out another sob.
"It's late guys. Let's go to bed." Hermione said, standing up.
After dinner we went back to my dorm, so he could grab his cloak. He left and I just got ready for the night.
"I can not belive this. I'm going to punish you." And then he bit my neck really hard making me squeal.
"And if she says no?" Ron said.
I can not believe I just did that. I hope Harry won't be mad at me once he wakes up.
He lightly pushed me back. "Harry wait. We can't just do this." Draco said.
Sirius Black!
Harry glared at him and said, "Would you like to try them on?"
"Well make sure that Lucif does not try to kill me in my sleep again." Ron said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"But I'm doing so much better Hermione. I promise I'll use no more spells. I promise." Harry said, smiling.
"That is not a grinning matter."Blaise said.
Then Ron came through and smiled at the both of us. He looked at Harry. "Merlin Harry, Draco really needs to stop biting you. It looks bad." He said.
He then slipped his hand down my pants and began stroking me down there. I gasped and began moving to get more friction.
Harry stood up on his broom and we are flying a feet over the ground. "What are you doing!?" I yelled, scared he will fall.
"I will be fine. I won't let her hurt me." He said.
"I don't want to go." I whined, but snuggled closer.
"Harry. We are suposed to be studying, not reading about dreams." Hermione said.
"Your little actives with Draco is what I mean." Ron said, smirking.
"It's going to be okay. Blaise will still love you." Draco said.
"Well, that looks fun," Ron said.
I leaned into Draco as he put an arm around me. He leaned to me and wisperd. "Let's go do something fun."
When he finished inspecting me, he gave me a quick kiss and we went to our next class.
I looked at dad who is laughing and said, "why are you laughing?"
Harry p.o.v
Since we were all done me and Harry decided to go to Dumbledore and ask him if I can take Harry out Saturday.
"We dont just think about sex." Blaise added.
"A Young basilisk. Why?" He asked.
Draco hugged me to him and said, "Why don't you want to talk about it?"
"This hat," I said getting the hat out of my pocket. "I also have Tom Riddle's diary," I added and took that out of my pocket too.
Blaise came over calling Buckbeak stupid and stuff.
I squeeked as he licked my neck and cheek. He then looked me in the eyes. Then. He kissed me. I gasped and he took the chance to sneak his toung into my mouth.
"G'bye." Hagrid said and we left.
"Well I have been good. I have just been missing my Harry." I said, hugging Harry to me.
"But he was still upset with you so it's your fault." I said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Will you rather go to the Gryffindor common room, or stay here?" I said.
My father and the Weasleys came over and started arguing. When my father said "It's time to go!" I said "See you at school Potter," and winked at him as I walked out.
Draco p.o.v
Harry p.o.v
I made him look at me and I kissed him. He kissed back and I pulled away. "Want to go to bed?" I asked.
"Yes. Harry is coming with me." I said putting an arm around his waist and pulling him to me.
"Harry, why did you do that?" I asked.
I finally got Harry to stay still and he is now clucking onto my shirt sobbing into my chest. I then smelled blood on Harry so I gently pulled him away and saw a cut on his arm. Harry's sobbing became a little less as Dumbledore came over with Mad-Eye.
"Alright. Just wanted to see. Make sure you two keep the noise to a minimum. Some of us need sleep." She said and walked away.
He looked around and I smiled. He slowly walked up and Hagrid said, "okay, now bow."
"Let's go to breakfast," I said and we went to the Great Hall.
"But you don't have to. All you have to do is say no. Harry the only reason why I broke up with you is because of Voldemort. I never intended for you to get hurt. I was going to apologise but you never gave me the chance. Please Harry." Draco said.
"What do you want Malfoy?" I asked.
"Really?" I asked.
Draco and I both said we will go. But I convinced Draco to let me go. Hermione put the thing around our necks then we time traveled.
"I will pick after tryouts." He said, still looking through the book.
On the other side there is a empty living room. I smiled and went to find Harry's room.
Harry has done this alot, and almost every time he does, all the Gryffindors, Sirius, Remus and Miss Weasley  break. But never Hermione. She is as cold as stone.
"I did not get a chance to speak," Ron replied.
"Yes. He should eat." Pansy said.
One more package came that is from Hagrid. It's a furry book that has teeth.
After breakfast, we went to classes. Ron is still upset with what I am wearing and Hermione complimented me. In all the classes everyone ignored us. In between the twins will try to draw attention but that would only work for a short amount of time.
"Of course." I said like it's obvious.
The next week me, Ron, and Hermione are in potions writing. Draco is on the other side of the room with the Slytherins.
I thought back to when I was with Draco. About how we would just cuddle and talk about the future. Having a wedding and children and a nice house. "Are you okay?" Hermione asked.
Every one is passed out and Harry is no were in sight.
But on a bad note, my father was not able to stop Buckbeak's execution so Harry, Ron, Hermione and I are going to Hagrid's.
Since Mason and I have everything done we are sitting on the couch resting. "So you ready for tomorrow Harry?" Mason asked.
"I want to. I think it will be fun." Harry said as we walked in the dining room.
"What do you mean. I was just telling it not to hurt Finch," he said.
I walked in and Harry was pacing nervously. "Hey love, you're going to be fine." I said, pulling him into a hug.
"It's okay, I'm going to go see. Hermione, take Harry" He said, lightly pushing me to Hermione and ran out.
"Why do you have this? I though you threw it all away!" I said.
I took his off as he began to kiss my chest.
"I can only drink Harry's. Though, if I do then that means he accepts me." I said and stumbled but Hermione helped me.
"I don't like him like that," Ron said getting annoyed.
"Oh okay. Let's go. It's almost time." I said, disappointed about Draco not being here.
"That's great. Hopefully he will never remember." Draco said.
"It's fine Ron. Let Hermione do what she wants. You have a date. you will be fine." Harry said, assuring his freind.
Harry p.o.v
"He thinks Voldemort will, or is going to, use my mind against me." He replied.
Draco tried to follow but lightning almost struck him. I kept going but stopped when I couldn't see it. Lightning struck and I saw a black dog, which Ron had called a Grim. Dementors started to circle me and started to attack. I passed out and fell, everything going to black.
Ginny climbed up and said to the blonde, "Stop wandering off, it's too hard to keep up."
"Well you four saw what happened. Ginny did it. I can get some veritaserum." Professor Snape said.
So I pulled away. "Come on Harry we need to go to breakfast." I said.
Though Blaise came to mine and began complaining about how Ron would never notice him.
Draco sneered. "Me and him are sitting with our boyfriends and she is here because we want her to be. Plus the Slytherin hate us." Draco said.
I awoke to see that I was in my warm, silken bed and had both of my parents on each side. "What happened?" I asked, trying to sift through the foggy memories that had overcame my mind.
"Um. Hey, Draco how about we go get some fresh air." I said and drag him out.
"Take all the fun out of it why don't ya," I said.
I swam through the weeds looking for... whatever I'm supposed to be looking for. Too bad Draco didn't show up. It's not like he'll see much anyway. I'm underwater. But it would have been nice.
Blaise followed him out. Me and Harry began getting ready for classes.
"Yes. I do remember that." Harry said, smiling.
"It's okay Tom. I'm sure that you will be fine." I said, smiling reassuringly.
They nodded just as we pulled into Hogwarts station.
That got my attention and I said, "Fine."
"Yes Harry you are so adorable." Draco said grinning.
"I definitely remember that." Ron said, nodding.
"Well, you are a snob." Ron snickered. (But you aren't you when you're hungry)
When we finished me and Hermione got the best scores. And we left for our next class.
"You don't know? Son, he has you wrapped around his little finger. He is so Slytherin I'm confused as to how he is in Gryffindor." Father said then walked out.
So I just placed the prize in my trunk and never going to use it or anything. As we got ready to leave we first went out to watch the other schools leave. Victor was about to come over to is. But when Draco hugged me to him and bared his fangs at Victor, he ran for the boat.
I looked at Draco and he said, "well, how about you take one of them." And he motioned to Pansy, Blaise, and Hermione.
We sat down and began eating. "Morning Harry and Draco. We're is Blaise and Ron?" Hermione asked.
"It's fine you guys, it was Bellatrix. She is in Azkaban now." I trailed off.
We all got up and went to Harry, who is trying to get Ginny away from him, but she is having him cornered and rubbing up on him.
"Your welcome love." I said and got in behind him, pulling him to my chest.
"Shut up Ron we are trying to eat!" I said and began eating.
"Azkaban is to good for her." I replied.
After we got the scores all of the Slytherins and Gryffindors went to the Slytherin common room since it's the biggest and partied.
"Oh come on Ron. We did not do anything that you are implying. But we did have a good night." I said and laughed a bit.
Then basically we got in a argument and I got sent to professor McGonagall.
Draco p.o.v
"It's okay. It's not like you know Wizarding things in order to use an owl or Wizarding candy." I said laughing a bit.
Me and Draco found one that has my name on it. "So these all are Prophecies? What will happen if we break it?" Draco asked.
As per usual, the house was in chaos. Everyone running around checking on last minute things.  I sat on the couch, holding Simba, and the deer that I named James in honor of my dad. My trunk lay by my feet.
When he pulled away I sniffed and pouted saying. "Promis you love me?" And sniffed again.
I nodded and picked it up.
"Oh come on Draco, Dumbledore trusts him so we should too. Do you really think Dumbledore would put us in harm's way?" I said.
Before he could do anything, I bit his neck, causing him to squeal.
"Maybe you were to young or you weren't paying attention." Hermione said. Blaise and Pansy came in and sat down.
Harry p.o.v wedding day
Some weird people tried talking to me, but Hagrid came to my rescue. "Y'know 'arry this is not a good place to be caught at."
"She broke a law! How is she not dead?!" Draco yelled. Dumbledore went to say something, but Draco interrupted. "And I don't care what the ministry says. My father will hear about this!" He turned and stormed out.
"None of your business." Draco said and resumed eating, me doing the same. Umbridge walked away.
"Yes to all your questions. He's Harry Potter." I answered.
"So are you going to like control his life?" Ron said.
"What is it, his hair or him talking?" Snape replied.
Harry fell asleep in my lap. "Well harry is asleep and it's almost curfew, so how about we do the same." Hermione said.
"That is great Harry." Draco said.
Draco laughed and rolled his eyes. "You are so adorable."
"Okay." I said and put food on both mine and Harry's plate because Harry has nothing on it.
"Yes." I said.
Draco p.o.v
When I walked in every one looked at us and instantly became silent, so they won't wake him up.
He then started kissing me some more and I heard the door close.
"My butt hurts." He said and blushed.
"The chamber of secrets. I read that you let out a monster," Harry said.
"I love you to Harry." I kissed his head and looked at the fire.
"That is mean. You should not say that about teachers. What if she heard you?" Hermione said.
"Have a biscut Mr. Potter." She said pushing a plate of biscut to me.
"Fawkes," Harry replied.
"That book tried to kill me. Why is it that books keep trying to kill me it's unnatural." Harry said.
After a few minutes of just kissing he pulled away both of us breathing heavily. But he went back and began kissing my jaw and neck nipping at the skin. He pulled off my shirt and began bighting at my chest.
The next day we went to Breakfast and the post came. I got all the usual stuff and same goes for Harry. I got the Daily Prophet and flipped to Rita Skeeter's page.
Harry then moved out from under me and pushed me to a sitting position and climbed onto my lap. He placed his head onto my chest wrapping his arms around me.
Draco turned wolf and jumped on her, both now on the ground.
I am shaken awake by Draco and Ron. "Morning. What time is it?" I asked sleepily sitting up.
We looked at each other and Hermione said, "if your on the light side we need help."
He nodded. "We should use protection though." He said.
All summer Harry has been learning how to be an animagus. Sirius and Remus have gotten married because there soul mates.
Harry hugged my arm to him probably trying to get me to calm down. It is working a bit.
"Why me?" Ron asked.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Are you okay Harry? Are you hurt? Do you need-" I was not able to finish because he covered my mouth with his.
"No, but, I don't swing that way," Ron said.
We all laughed at that and went to eat breakfast.
"Because I like boys. Plus Draco is going to make me wear a dress. Somewhat against my will?" I said and Ron looked like he seen a ghost.
"Well...are you,Harry?" I asked.
Draco hugged me and I felt tears hit my neck. "I missed you so much. I wanted you so bad."
"I already showed you this." I said holding up the map.
"But still. I can not believe you." We then walked out. Harry still blushing. And me still hungry for blood.
I shook my head. "No. It's just..she is Ron's sister so it's kind of mean that he is not nice." I said.
When we got to Hogwarts we done the normal. We rid the carriages and went into the great hall. Dumbledore is not there however. Blaise, Pansy, and I sat at the Gryffindor table. McGonagall stood up. "I am sorry to say, but Dumbledore has retired. However the same rules still stand. No going into the forbidden forest-"
"The day after tomorrow you both go back to hogwarts." Lucius said.
Harry p.o.v
"If that Slytherin made you upset I'll hex him." Ron said to us.
"I'm glad to hear that." He said.
"You are horny boys. I can only imagine what you two would do!" Hermione replied.
We laughed and then eventually they left.
He got low over the water, listing. His talons hit the water, sending up droplets. I spread my arms and yelled in joy. He circled back and I held on again as he landed.
"Now you to go to your separate rooms!" Hermione yelled.
"Don't make her mad. Make sure you keep up your image. I don't want any attention drawn to the Malfoys. If you do as I ask, we will not go to the dark lord again." Dad said.
I went up to Harry and lightly kissed his lips. "So love are we good or not?" I asked softly.
"Why are you sorry? Is not your foult." Blaise said sitting up more.
"Don't worry. I'm the boy who lived." I said and kissed draco jaw.
"Hi?" Me and Ron said.
"I love you to." I replied and we fell asleep.
"Sit here and cuddle." Harry said, cuddling into me.
Draco began having a conversation with Hedwig. So me Ron and Hermione began talking about the next task.
"Your lucky that I have a silencing charm on these curtains." Draco said and got up.
"Okay that sounds good." I said.
Ron laughed and said, "All of Gryffindor knows it."
"Would you like me to go change?" I asked.
He shrugged and continued to eat.
Then finally we came together me collapsing on top of him.
After classes, we are still debating about Mad-Eye. Currently, we are doing so in the Gryffindor common room.
"Um. Somthing about keeping People out of your mind." I said, trying to think about it as much as I can.
He handed it to me and I took off my sock and placed it in. Draco looked at me weird as I reput on my shoe and ran out Draco fallowing.
"No." He said and poked me again.
We walked into dracos room to see both him and Harry on his bed cloths a little disheveled. "Um. Are. Are we interrupting?" I asked.
I covered my ears and yelled at Harry to turn it off.
"How long have you all been there?" I asked smiling.
We made it to the Castel and we decided that for today we will sit with our own houses. Mcgonagall made her speech then the first years came in and got sorted. Slythren got  5 griffendor 7 hufflpuff 4 Ravenclaw 5.
"Okay," I said and walked back to my friends.
"Don't worry you will be fine love." I said, hugging him.
Then I went back to looking at Harry. He is so cute. And he must be into that. Baby stuff. Or he just has some mentle issue to were his stuffed animal calms him. I know Female Weasly has it.
"Favorite animal?" he asked.
"Cat," I answered.
So that is our plan. Tomorrow we will go see Voldemort.
"Alright well, I will have to keep this. Just go to your room." He said nodding and looking at the map.
At dinner Draco sat with the Slytherins and the Goblet was on a podium near the staff table. We ate, then Dumbledore stepped up to the Goblet.
I took him up to our room and fell asleep with him cuddled to me.
I kissed the top of his head. "Don't worry Harry. You'll live." I said.
"I'm wanting to be an Auror." Ron said.
"This is your house elf?" I asked.
I am currently in bed trying not to move. If I do, it will hurt.
"You sent that bludger?" We said together.
"Hey it's okay. Don't cry love. I'm just happy that your safe." I said and kissed his forehead.
I found it and almost got it but a bludger almost hit me. Oliver came over and said, "You need to be careful Harry." before he was hit himself.
Ginny p.o.v
"Morning Harry. Come on let's get ready." I said and got up and noticed that Ron and Blaise is not in the room. When Harry went to get up and cride out in pain and fell back down. "What's wrong!" I asked frantically.
"Don't worry. I won't. I love you Harry." He said and kissed my lips.
"Well show you. Come on." I said leading her to the giant.
"But I am comfortable and he smells good." Draco said.
"Okay. But if he tries anything then I will kill him." Draco said looking serious.
"Well, I would like to know," Ron said.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
I shrugged and said, "I don't know. Just thought that it would be nice."
Saturday I woke up and felt tired still and since it's Saturday I went into little space and remember we need to get Draco a present Wich made me happy. It's nice to give people presents and it would be nice to have Draco as a freind. He is cute.
A couple hours later, I'm sitting on the couch near the door. Hermione came over. "Hey Draco." She said. I looked at her, thinking she sounds different. "Hey Hermione." I said and started feeling uncomfortable.
"Neville look he's alive," Ron said turning me around. And as he said Harry is alive.
Draco p.o.v
Though Harry kept asking questions praticly trying to get me to do his hw. "Harry do your homework. I can't do it for you." I said pushing him his paper.
He giggled and kissed my nose. "Hi Dwaco."
"Morning Draco. I don't want to get up." I said.
Inside is a bunch of my favorite candy and a few roses. "Wow. Well whoever this is knows me pretty well." I said.
"Well you all can go to sleep now." Ms Weasly said shooing us up stairs.
I went into the common room and saw Harry laying on the couch, asleep. I laid on the floor and did the same.
"Hey you scared your boyfriend. He will send his godfather at you! I heard he is an animagus!" Blaise yelled.
We went down to breakfast with Pansy and Hermione and fifteen minutes later Blaise and Ron joined us. "Why did you two not wake us?" Ron said.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"Yeah, but still. I was hoping for more." I said.
"Say it more snobby, and mean." Harry encouraged.
Draco huffed and sat down, and I sat in a chair next to him. "Well I wanted to be with Harry. We cannot get a good night's sleep without each other. And Voldemort has not done much since the ministry. " Draco said.
The door opened and Draco growled.
"I don't know." I said.
He leaned down and kissed me and I kissed back eagerly. But he saddly pulled away again and said, "we should get ready."
I took it off. "Christmas." I said.
The weaslys Hermione Sirus Remus and Luciuas came in to see the children.
"I- I lied I've never done any of that," Lockheart stammered.
"Harry what you fall into is called  'little space'. While you are in it you act like a child, and your significant other may act as a what some people call, a mommy or daddy dom. You basically have done all this without knowing it" Remus explained more.
"Want to come over to our house?" I ask.
Ron nodded and we fallowed Hermione.
We all thanked the girls and finished our breakfast.
"Cool. How did you get it?" He asked sitting next to me.
He looked at us frowned and shook his head, "my brother. Making kids do adult work. Why does he need to be so stupid. Fallow me." He said and lead us to the back.
"Harry." I said and ran out.
"Morning girls." We said. We sat down and began eating as Ron and Blaise came in.
"So Harry what did you think when I did not show up?" I asked.
"It was only two weeks." I said hugging her as Ron and Mason bro hugged.
"We are so sorry. We have just been trying to hunt horcroxs and hide from V- he who shall not be named." I said making sure not to say his name.
We then went to class. And this one I don't have with Harry because he is taking some class with Ravenclaws. As I have a class with Hufflepuff.
After working I decided that I want to take Harry out for a picknick. So I slipped away and got dobby to get us a basket with all Harry's favorite foods and had Dobby set it up near the lake. "Come on Harry I have a suprise for you." I said dragging Harry along.
"Let's go to class." Draco said, so we left the great hall.
"Good, good." He handed my wand back to me "Have a nice day." He said.
Next week is the second task and I am scared for Harry. He is going to be in the black lake for an hour. I promised to get Gilly weed for him, so we don't need to worry about that. We just need to worry about what is in the lake.
He pulled off our pants and boxers. He pushed me onto the bed and began sucking me off.
But then Draco got ontop of me and began kissing me ruffly. I kissed back the same pulling him closer.
"I can not belive that we found nothing. I mean we should have at least found a week old scent." Hermione said, sounding upset.
"No. Only Harry." Draco said.
I sighed and said, "he does. Is Mason here?" I asked.
Mom smiled. "No need to call me Mrs Malfoy. Just call me Narcissa." Mum said.
"By Pansy. See you later." I said.
"Oh. Yah you did say that after something that they starting being slightly nicer. Was it the fact that you are a wizard?" He said.
"The Fat Lady  - she's gone!" someone told them.
I smiled at Harry's shocked face. Me, the Weasleys', Hermione, and Sirius set up a suprised party for her, and she seems happy with it. I walked up to her and kissed her. "Happy birthday, love," I said
"Yes?" I said.
I shrugged and got up getting ready for the day.
"Well can you ask Ron why he could not tell me this himself. I mean he is right there!" I said pointing at him.
We all just shrugged as I began kissing Draco's neck and nuzzling him. He would just pat my head and kiss my cheek.
I hugged him to me and he leaned to me. Fleur came up and said, "thank you both for saving my sister even though she was not yours to save." And she hugged the both of us. Then she walked away.
"Not completely sure. We would need to get permission from Dumbledore though." I said, frowning a bit.
"Sounds good." Blaise said.
"I still don't think it's my fault. I don't deserve detention." Harry said. He seems pretty mad.
"So what did you think of that Draco?" I asked him.
But I'll get him. I can promise that.
"I was not sure if you wanted people to know yet. She asked if my parents would be alright with who I am secretly dating. Do you think they will?" I asked Draco.
"Okay. Promise me you are going to be careful," I said.
"Yes." I said taking a ring out of my pocket. It is green with a lion that has a black heart on its side. Harry took it from me and placed it on my left ring finger and smiled. He snuggled into my side and closed his eyes.
When we both made it we argued who will take it. Deciding to do so together we both grabbed it. And we got teleported away.
Draco began going faster and harder, me yelling his name and scratching his back. He began stroking and playing with my dick. We both then came, me all over both of us and Draco inside of me. Draco pulled out of me and collapsed next to me. He pulled me to him, cuddling me. "I love you Harry." He said.
"I'm not saying you are, I just... I mean... What if it was a trap?" I said.
"Fine. But you're mine and no one shall take you." I said, having him sit on my lap.
I looked at him in shock. He is so kind. I wiped the tears away and said, "any one that dates you is truly, lucky."
"Hmm." Was my only reply.
After we began to pack up deciding to move. "Were are we going? Harry asked.
I nodded and he missed my forhead. "Yes we have." Draco said.
"Draco! Either go get a room or stop kissing Harry." I heard Blaise say.
Mad eye was about to say more but Draco got up making me nearly fall off his lap. He began walking to the door talking about how absurd this is.
Me and Pansy looked at him and I said, "No, he should be fine. He's had a rough day, he should sleep."
Then I crawled in next to him closed the curtains. I covered us up and cuddled Harry and fell asleep.
I thought of the reservation thing as a joke. I mean, everyone calls us that so why not?
We then both fell asleep in each others embrace.
"That's it?" I said, pushing away the fact his Godfather is Sirius, the infamous murderer.
Then we all left to go to our beds.
"I don't know. But he is a Death Eater." Harry said and shrugged.
That night we slept restlessly. Draco tried to distract me with kisses. Then he finally stood up and said, "come one Harry."
No potion in the world can help me.
"I will just tell you the short version." Luna started and we were all listening intently. "Harry needs to be underwater for an hour looking for something precious to him."
*Harry's P.O.V.*
Remus looked at her and said, "it's not your fault. I blame Draco."
"It's cold down here Dray." I said and cuddled up to him more.
"Plus normal for us is what has been happening for the past six years." Hermione said.
"Sure boys." Dumbldore said and stood up. He then led us to his office and he sat at his desk as Draco sat down dragging me into his lap. "What do you boys need to talk to me about?" Dumbldore asked.
We went to the room of requirement and I got a TV. We sat down and began waching some shows as we ate candy.
Since those were the last people we all walked out and some people made bets on who will get in.
"Okay, I'll tell them. I'll tell them." He said and fell back asleep.
I shrugged. "I don't know. Possibly. I mean she killed Auror's and escaped." I said.
"I like your owl she is nice," I said to Harry.
"I don't know. I mean he does think of us as freinds." I said.
I looked in a mirror and saw that I still have the ones from the belt.
Then Victor and a few of his friends walked passed us and glared at me. I bared my fangs at them and they kept walking. "And make sure you stay away from them," I said.
"Hey, Harry have you ever worn a bra?" Ginny asked coming over.
We nodded and Draco said, "Harry did not want to get out of bed".
"Aaaaaa! Your smooshing me!" Harry squealed.
I felt some one shaking me awake and when I opened my eyes, Hermione is standing in front of us.
I could feel Malfoy starting at me. Though I ignored it. Maybe he does not want to be with me. Maybe he does. Though. I'll never truly know untill he says something. And I don't want to say anything. Don't want to force him or anything.
Harry nodded and since he says he is feeling better we got up and went to the great Hall. Wich then he ran back out.
"So the first one is that Umbrige has been released and not charged. Though she can not go back to the school and is under house arrest."
We sat down with our friends and began eating. After a few minutes ,however, Harry seemed to be getting hot and his breathing deepening.
"Well Harry I have noticed that you are looking a little different. I want to know if you are okay." I said, making my voice sound as concerned as I can.
Fifty chapters! YAY. Happy fifty chapters every one.
"Oh let's see. I was kissing Harry and you guys showed up." Draco replyed a bit angery.
I moaned as he grabbed me and rubbed his hand there.
Mad Eye went to the jar of spider and took one out. "Crucio!" He yelled and pointed at the spider. It withered in pain. Neville looked like he was about to cry. He was very sensitive about others' pain.
Blaise I notice keeps glancing at Ron. But he is completely oblivious. Mostly because he is staring at Fleur.
The first team had Irish leprechauns dance in the air then explode in coins. Ron and I caught a few and put it in our pocket. The other team had some women go into the field and dance. Most of the men stared at them with lust. One of them including Ron.
Sirius then came down stairs. Ron and Hermione. My two most favorite people. How good to see you." He said and hugged them both.
"He is upset that I got into the tournament," I said and frowned.
We laughed and Ron said, "Do you think that I should feel bad for doing this to my sister?"
"Raise your hand when you wish to speak. And the answer to that is because you don't need them. Do you expect to get attacked in this class?" She asked.
Colin took our picture and missed the bludger.
"Victore is annoying," Draco replied. I was about to turn but Draco said, "don't look."
I froze and watched unsure what to do.  What is he even doing here? "H-harry?" I said slowly stepping forward.
"Oh. but that is the least of your problems." Umbitch said, coming out of nowhere.
I smiled to myself at making Harry shocked and confused.
"Um.... Sure." I said and Draco shook his head, mumbling something.
"Do you think that your dad will know more?" Harry asked.
"And taller without heels," Blaise added for me.
"Good." Both me and Harry said together.
I reached over the table and grabbed Draco's hand. He looked at me and I smiled at him showing that its okay. He grinned back and continued eating.
"Alright enough talking. I want to show Harry I can win." I said, mounting my broom and flying. Every one followed my lead. "Sorry love, but I am going to kick your but." I said.
We ate then went to something that Mr. Weasley called a portkey. And we met a person called Cedric. He is a seventh-year Hufflepuff. We all grabbed onto the boot a.k.a. the portkey and got to the quidditch place.
"He is fine. Every one now knows that Voldemort is back. But you almost died!" Draco said as he got up.
Once we finished we went to the room of requirement and relaxed on a sofa. We cuddled, Harry laying on top of me, his head nuzzled to my neck. "Draco. I am sorry." Harry said and I felt some tears fall down my neck.
"Maybe they wanted to go on one but did not know we're to go." I said putting an arm around Harry's waist.
The rest of the year passed by slowly and we got ready for this being our last year.
I sighed and said, "Because its embarrassing."
After only an hour of sleep I woke up feeling scared. It took me a minute to realise that it was from Harry. I got up and walked out of my room to the common room. One of the good things about being a Slytherin is that you get your own room.
"Of course sir." I said happly.
"Harry, what happened?" I asked looking him over for any injuries.
We went down to the great hall and sat in our usual places with Hermione and Pansy.
"I did but I'm confused," Ron said.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
I'm sure it's not important. So I let it go and we walked in to see my friends and Harry's at the griffendore table eating. I sat next to Harry and hermine winked at me from the other side of him. The rest of our friends sitting across from us.
We all began eating except Harry. "You okay?" I asked him. He nodded and began eating.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"It's okay Harry. We will find him then every thing will be perfect once again." Draco said, hugging me to him.
Harry p.o.v
The lady nodded and said, "it should be ready in two days."
"Hermione has a pet cat. The cat must have put the lizard in his bed." I told Draco.
"But Hermione it's only ten!" Ron whined laying on the couch looking like a drama queen.
"But you don't understand young master. It's not safe for Harry Potter. Do you know how hard it was to try to make him leave today? I even ironed my hands for you, master." He said showing his hands.
"The man is wormtail and the girl Ginny. I found Harry in a river." I explained.
"Leave me." I said, silently thinking he is just stopping me just to leave me. If I die he dies.
•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•
but when we got to the Great Hal,l he bolted to the bathroom and emptied the contents of his stomach.
"Thank you Draco, I love it." He said.
He glanced at Draco. "No come on harry." He said, then got up and dragged me out of the room.
"You left this on the table in the common room. Here is the cloak. I need to go. Have fun." She said, handing Draco my things and walking away. Pansy smirked and also walked away.
"Every one thought he was the heir of slytherin and attacking the muggle born." Draco said, laughing a little.
"Yeah. But I'm sure it will be fine." I said placing it to the side and ignoring it.
"I'm fine." I said.
Does that mean no and when he was reading up on me he knows if he rejects me I will die? And he is not giving me an answer..I bet he won't.
So that night we went to bed. Ron and Blaise sharing one, me and Harry sharing another. We closed the curtains and I straddled his waist.
I slipped out of little space and kissed back sucking on his toung getting a groan from him. Then he pulled away. He grinned and said, "you taste good. And a great kisser."
"There is something pulling the carriages." He said.
"Love you, too, Harry," I replied.
"I know. I can't wait." I said smiling at him.
Once we got onto the express me, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Blaise sat in the same compartment. Pansy is with some other Slytherin girls.
I went over to him and Hermione said, "I know there is something wrong with you. Let me and Ron take him." I nodded as Ron picked him up and the team, me and Hermione followed.
Draco p.o.v
He looked suprised and said, "'bout time you ask. But. Why?"
After we ate and owl came in and gave me another present. I opened it and there was a love letter and more treats. I quickly used a spell to figure out who it is. And it said Blaise. Which makes no sense because he is straight.
"I had to send a letter. I was just on my way." I replied and walked past her.
I sat down and noticed that they're making breakfast. "Did you sleep well, Harry?" Pansy asked.
So we said bye to Tom who happily said bye back and asked for us to come back soon.
"Love you Harry." He said.
"Can't believe Remus quit," Ron said.
Draco's p.o.v
"Yah he is the only one. After I saved him from dementors he started being nicer. We even became friends." I said.
"Good boy. How do you feel?" He said.
When we thought the coast is clear we took off the cloak. And Ron said, "what do you think he meant by following the spiders? I don't see any spiders. So let's go." Ron said.
"We probably should. But we can not just do it. We will have to wait. Maybe I could just catch his scent and it'll be easy." I said.
"Okay... well, will you wear a skirt for me?" he asked smiling.
Hermione handed us our time tables. "We have no classes with Slytherins today." She said.
So I slowly began to eat as I thought of all the things I know about Harry to get him back.
"Hey Harry," I said and kissed his cheek.
I picked it up and Ron and Draco walked over. "Tom Marvalo Riddle." I read on the back.
"Let's not worry about that now and just have some fun." Ron said, smiling.
I'm sitting on the couch in my and Mason's home. Tears are running down my face as I look at the ring Mason gave me.
Draco p.o.v
"Yah, he kept looking at you like you are the love of his life." Ron said.
"Harry blood quill don't just write onto your hand. They will eventually curse you tell you can never lie. And eventually you will then die." Balise said.
All except for me though. I can't because normally Dumbledore will look at me and give me some resource that every thing is going to be okay.
"Harry I am not going to ask you to stop, you are not in trouble. I just want to know if you are aware of what you are doing." Remus said and took another bite of food.
"Alright times up." Slughorn said. Draco got done just in time and it does not look right. He got to me and I'm last. "That is excellent Harry. You are just as good as your mother." I smiled at his praise. "Here is your prize. Use it well." He said and class ended.
"It's too complicated." He said pouting.
"Well I did not need to listen to you snore like a pig." Harry said to him.
We then went to Dumbledore's office and I asked him to give Draco, Pansy, and Blaise protection and he said he will get started on that right away.
"Which is why it's a punishment." He said and got up.
But then I heard a moan from there bed and thought, who cares. Wander who is toping.
Harry took a lantern and pointed at a big line of spiders. We walked out side and Ron said, "why spiders? Why can't it be 'follow the pretty butterflies'?"
We nodded and Harry said, "we are not taking the floo are we?"
After dinner we went to our room and just as we were getting into bed Ron started taking. "Don't forget Harry. Please keep it down and use protection." Ron teased.
I curled up on the couch using Hermione as a pillow as she runs her fingers through my hair, she's okay at comforting, but Draco's better. I looked around and noticed that Ron is gone along with Blaise. "They followed Draco." Hermione said.
Ron nodded. "But still. What if the person is false and has only been acting." Ron said.
So we left giving each other a kiss goodbye.
"Yeah. Ronykins." Blaise said, smirking.
"Hello." He said, seeming nervous.
"Harry what happened?" Dumbledore asked him.
I pushed him onto a wall and bit into his neck. Harry gasped and moaned. He pulled me close as I drank. When I finished I pecked his lips and licked the wound to heal it.
He leaned back and relaxed. "I bet that if Hermione and Ron find out they will kill you and never leave us alone." He said.
I grabbed both our trunks and we walked out.
We danced for a while and a lot of the girls were either awing or fangirling. All the boys, except for the twins, were ignoring us. Fred and George were teasing us.
"Harry, take a look at Hermione's classes," Ron said handing Harry her schedule, disbelief written across his features.
"Draco it's okay. We will find him. Just please don't yell." Hermione said, placing a hand on my shoulder.
I just can't believe they did not know I am working for Voldemort. I mean the only reason why I "almost died" and hid the diary was to cover my tracks. I wanted Harry to be beside me, but no. Then when Draco gave that damn paper to Hermione so he can help Harry I tried to kill him and the basilisk tried to kill Hermione instead.
"You two are so cute together." Hermione said.
"I had a dream about Voldemort." Harry said and kept reading.
"As far as you want." I whispered in his ear and bit it.
I pulled away from his mouth and continued to thrust in and out of him. "Draco. Mm. Draco I'm close." He said and gripped the sheets.
Dumbledore made them all silent again and told us the normal rules and dismissed us. Before Draco went to his room he quickly came over to me and told me good night and gave me a quick kiss.
Hermione smiled and tried to get Ron do his work instead of copying her.  I laughed and done mine.
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall came in and used a spell to make him be put into a chair. They then forced a potion down his throat and he turned into Mr Crouch.
"He is thirteen I'm sure he will be okay without us," Ron said.
"But, Draco, I'm hard. Please!" He said lust in his eyes.
I used my animal talking powers and said, "Hello Hedwig we have not talked in a while how are you?"
"Fine. Only because you asked." Draco said standing up and fixing his shirt.
"Potions won't work nor will spells. So I don't know how she will get Harry to stop loving Draco." Hermione said.
Harry P.O.V
He looked at me and pouted. Dams why does he need to look so adorable. I kissed his cheek.
"How about instead of telling you I will show you." I said. He opened the door and I pushed him to the wall next to the door and closed the door.
Ginny p.o.v
The owls then came in, Ron getting two letters, and Headwig just visiting. "Oh no. I got a howler. Though there is no name." Ron said and opened it.
"Sounds good." He replied.
We went to the living room and I turned into my animagus which is an wolf-dog.
I followed it out and Draco fell off his broom. I hope he's okay.
I waited in my room for a while. Then Harry came in smelling like ash and fire.
"We did not want to get up." Draco said.
"No sweety maybe draco was just scared. Kissing some one takes a lot of courage. How about you go get some rest." I said taking Harry's hand and leading him to the boys room.
"Will you guys stop yelling. It's not helping Harry right now!" Draco yelled, making Harry more scared.
"Every one is so worried about  you kids. " Sirius said.
"We pulled back the curtains and Draco was on top of Harry and they were snogging!" Ron said obviously not happy.
I pulled away and got on top of him straddling his waist. "I will always love you, no matter what." I said and kissed him.
"But I can't be," he protested.
"Mom made cookies." Ginny said.
When it was time, I walked out with the other champions, Draco following close behind glaring at Victor. Though he just looked on blankly. When Mad-Eye told Draco to go back champions Draco hugged me and kissed me then told me that I'll be okay. Then he went to the stands standing next to his mom and dad, our friends, and the Weasleys.
My parents though did not help me because it is my responsibility. The only time they did was when Harry asked. Harry's gourdians though helped no matter what.
I woke up and Dobby is here. Draco woke up next to me. "What are you doing here Dobby?" Draco asked.
But he sadly pulled away. "We need to get to Defense." Draco said.
But all that matters is we are happy. With or without kids. And they are doing good to.
After a little bit, I could feel discomfort from Harry and lots of depression. My ring is burning up. I wanted to go, but Hermione told me there is nothing I could do. It's a part of occlumency. When I though that it was finally over, I ran all they way back. Harry walked out, pale and shaken. "Oh Harry. What happened? Did he hurt you? Do you want me to kill him?  I'll kill him." I said.
Then an arrow ran through her chest and she collapsed on the ground. Two centaurs came over. "She will not be bothering you all now. I hope you all be careful. Dark times are ahead." One of them said and they ran off.
I began filling up my plate and began to eat. "Don't eat to fast or to much Harry. You'll get sick." Hermione said, smiling fondly at me.
"Mm-hm. You ready?" He asked.
He walked over to a door and opened it, leading to a bedroom. He pushed us onto a bed, me on bottom. He took off my shirt and his, then our pants and boxers. He broke the kiss and began biting my neck, leaving bruises and bite marks. I moaned as he began on my chest.
Every one cheered and clapped for her arrest. Me and the Weaslys twins probably the loudest.
"I just woke up." He said and recudled into my chest.
I carefully set him in the bath me getting behind him. I held him to me for a but both of us relaxing in the warm water.
"Fine." I said and allowed him to cuddle to me.
"Your cute when you blush." I said. I bring him to me and kissed him. Then someone walked in.
We took a shower and everything, but when we started getting dressed I realized, I don't feel like either a boy or girl. I frowned and Draco looked at me staring at my cloths. "You okay?" He asked.
"What is normal?" Pansy asked, crossing her legs and placing an elbow on top of them.
The ink disappears and was replaced with, hello Harry I am Tom Marvalo Riddle.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"No." He said, frowning again.
Harry blushed and buried his face in my chest. "Dray stop." He said.
Some ministry peaple then came in and arrested Umbitch. Telling her that she is arrested for illigle use of punishment. Then left.
"Do you know if Sirius can come over to your house?" He asked.
He pulled the curtains shut and put up a silencing charm. "What are you doing Draco?" I asked.
"Well I guess he was the one that has been stealing the things to make polyjuce." Dumbledore said. "Now where is the real mad eye?" Dumbledore asked as Snape gave him a truth potion.
Draco p.o.v
Harry p.o.v
I laughed and said, "I know. It's just awckward to talk about around my freinds."
Harry held onto my arm tight as dad grabbed one of the owl cages and trunks.
We went down stairs and left Ron and Blaise in Ron's bed. "Morning boys. Leaving Ron and Blaise again?" Hermione said.
I see what's going on - Harry just wants me to kiss him and hopes that he won't have to do is homework. I'll not allow him to take advantage of this!
"Something wrong with Harry? Ever since yesterday he has been acting different. I don't know if he loves me anymore." I said, almost in tears.
"Well, you shouldn't procrastinate. Draco say something." Hermione said.
Draco immediately ran up to me and kissed me. "I have missed you so much, Harry." He said hugging me tightly.
She nodded. Are you dating anyone?" She asked.
"I don't either, but if I don't Remus and Sirius may think I am having sex with you." Draco said.
"I don't fall asleep that easy now let's go." We then went down and we continued tell we saw the big skeleton snake. I took out a fang.
"Oh come on Ron. Don't you enjoy bottom?" He asked.
"Aww but it's fun." I said,laughing.
"You okay Harry?" Ron asked.
Harry walked out of the room and the Great Hall. I got up and followed and and his friends did too. I ran up to him and grabbed his elbow. "Hey, are you alright?" I asked.
He then got very close and said. "You shall show respect. You shall eather say sir or Mr." Snape said. He then walked away and said, "now control your emotions. Clear your mind!" Then just as he was going to yell the spell. I did.
"Draco decided that we can skip. I have a lot on my mind." I said.
"Fine I'll just get both." Draco said, not listening to my protests.
Lockhart came over and said, "I can fix broken bones easily." He gently took my arm, Draco glaring at him.
I stopped kissing him. "Okay." I said. I was about to get up and carry Harry, but Hermione stopped us.
I stoped tickling him and just sat on his waist. He is breathing heavily and letting out a few giggles. "Now was that so hard?"
"Love you to." I replied and kissed him again.
"Alright. Let's do it." I said.
I got up and walked down stairs. The table is set and mom and dad are at each end of the table. I sat myself in the middle, on the side from where I can look out the window.
Me and Draco decided to leav early so we can spend time alone together. Our other friends decided to stay.
"But I want to now." I said, before I realized I sounded like a baby and blushed looking down.
"Yes please Draco." He said and I pushed inside of him.
As Draco carried me, I cuddled to him and have my arms around his neck. "Did you have a good sleep Harry?" He asked.
"Harry did I say somthing wrong?" Draco asked.
"He called you beautiful?" Ron asked incredulously.
"No way they still bite," Draco said pointing at the one that bit him and it bit him again. "See." He said.
Then of course fait had to be against me and we ran into Malfoy Parkisin and Zabani as we made it to the great Hall. Draco is looking every were but at me and his friends are just acting as though everything is normal. And we just went our separate ways.
Draco p.o.v
"You can where all the shirts and pants you want." He said.
"I don't wike Umbwige." He answered.
That night Harry woke me, Ron, and Blaise up telling us nothing. We then got Hermione and Pansy. We ran out to that giant Hagrid once told us about.
"What!?" They said, at once.
I thought it over. I think Blaise is hot. In second year I thought a seventh year was hot to. Never really thought of it. "Yes." I answered.
I walked up to her and growled at her. She backed off and went in. "Well aren't you possessive today." Ron said as we walked in.
"Thank Merlin Harry are you okay? Are you hurt? Is there anything you need me to do?" I said.
"Yes why?" I asked.
Draco said that he loves me to.
"We do not." I said.
Harry tiredly ate. "Harry did you sleep at all last night?" I asked, worried.
We all looked to the front and Harry said. "There Threstles. You seem them when you see death."
She just huffed and we began eating. "So what is the plan now?" Ron asked.
And that he (Malfoy) will always love me.
"But why?" I said, leaning against Draco and continued eating.
Time skip to when the fith book starts.
"I had smelt you. Your parents will be here to get you around twelve. You know, it's very dangerous these days to be going around on your own." Remus said, looking at Draco Seriously.
I shrugged as Ron shook his head.
"No. Your just distracting me." Harry said.
So I cuddled more to him and fell back asleep.
Today is the day of the task and still nothing. Hermione and I had to leave Harry and Ron to it because we have been called to Dumbledore's office.
"So what happened?" Mason asked as I made dinner.
"But Harry. You are adorable. You don't need to be as tall as us." Draco said hugging me to him and playing with my still tinged pink hair.
"I promise," Harry replied.
"Yes. Have you never done that before?" He said.
"Lucif tried to kill him." I said, grinning.
When I looked at him he is frowning and has tear tracks down his cheeks.
"Fine mean. Draco help me." Harry whinned.
Pansy sat down and we greeted her. When Blaise and Ron came down Ron seemed pleased with himself and Blaise has hickyes all up and down his neck. "Morning every one." Ron said as they sat down Balise winceing a bit.
"It's fine, Professor. I can just go to the hospital wing," I said.
I smiled. "Yeah. loads." I said.
Then we went back to eating.
"After school is good, we have time. " Draco said.
"Really?" Pansy said.
I woke up naked cuddled to a neked Draco. My butt hurting. I cuddled closer to Draco not wanting to get up. Draco moved and opened his eyes. "Morning my Harry." Draco said nuzzling my neck.
We went to my common room and I said, "would you like to stay with me tonight?"
James grinned and pulled out our dad's map. "Now. Time to make our parents proud. I have the map."
"Not intentionally! Harry please I just want what's best for you," he pleaded.
He opened the door then walked back out. He is crying so I hugged him. "Harry it's okay. Now listen if I did not love you, your mark will burn then go away. Okay? It's alright.  I'm here and not leaving." I said, rubbing his back.
"Nothing." He said.
I nodded and we begin doing our homework, but Harry was not paying attention. So, I took him by the arm and take him to the boys room, which is empty. "Harry, what's wrong?" I asked.
"No. It feels pleasurable to mates." He said and bit into my neck. I sighed at how good it felt. He then pulled away and said, "See it's good. How do you feel?"
"You were there you heard me," he said.
Harry p.o.v
I smirked and said, "but Harry is hot in those positions."
I handed him his potion. "I'm fine. It's you who I should worry about." I said.
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Snape asked.
"No it'll make him less hungry for dinner. He already don't eat enough as it is!" Hermione yelled at Ron and taking the cookies.
"He seems nice," Hermione said.
"Morning my Draco. " I said kidding his lips.
"Yes ma'am we have. We would like the five layered cake alternateing chocolate and vanilla." I replied.
I nodded. "There is something wrong. What do I do?" I asked.
The next morning mom sent Harry's and my dress robes. And Ron opened his. It's frilly and everyone started laughing.
I groaned and sat up. "Just promise you won't get mad or think any different of me." I said and he said, "don't worry I won't.
"I understand sev." Draco said.
We have thirty minutes and Harry needs to be with the other champions soon.
"Well my question is why would they take Remus? Why not harry?" Pansy asked.
"Exactly Dray." He said and began to eat.
"All right." I said and got all the stuff.
So after we ate we flooed to Diagon ally and saw Hermione, Ron, Blaise,and Pansy getting their supplies.
"But Draco I am enjoying this." I said.
Draco nodded as Sirius said, "why are you all here any ways?"
Then there was an opening through the weeds and I see blond hair. Oh, merlin he was what I was looking for! I thought. Hermione, some young girl - Fleur's sister - and Cho is down here too.
"He is my Godfather, I know he has emotions, even if he isn't vocal about them." I scoffed
A first year came over and took a picture of me and Hedwig and said. "Hello Harry, I'm Colin Creevey. Is it true that we can make pictures move? How does it work?" He asked excitedly.
We saw Hermione walk over with Viktor Krum. "She is going with him?" I asked.
Harry laughed. "No it's not. It's painful." Harry said.
"Anything interesting happen Harry?" I said, pulling him onto my lap.
Then Harry ran out crying and me Ron and Hermione followed him. Hermione pulled off the cloak and I sat next to him. "What's wrong my love?" I said pulling him onto my lap.
"You know Harry you are loud." Ron said, smirking.
"Alright. sounds good." Blaise said happily.
I wrapped an arm around him. "Go back to sleep love. You have nothing to worry about." I said.
"What?" I said.
"Them," Ginny said pointing at us.
We finished eating then went to the rest of our classes hoping that Umbrige get what she deserves.
"Don't worry, I won't let you get killed. I'm sure Dumbduck won't let you either." I said.
"They were starving him, Mum! They put bars on his window!" Ron exclaimed.
