Miguela, cool and collected, thanked the staff for their welcomes, and offered nods to both him and Draco. Harry relaxed some. At least he wouldn’t be subjected to someone who hated him—Snape could handle that for everyone.
Alick then said, “Fourth years and new Hufflepuffs, you have each been sponsored by an initiated Hufflepuff. This member will guide you throughout the year in your own personal journey to become your best self, the person who can give something great to the world, the person you are not yet, but can be. Sponsors, please reveal yourselves to your initiates.”
,” said the Prime Minister, retrieving a wand from her pantsuit and giving a little shower of sparks, to the audience’s great delight. Everyone cheered, and the guests on the stage gave appropriately happy claps, though Snape was still as ornery as he’d been in his first life. Living in Atlantis had changed little beyond his skin tone.
Harry nods, grimacing. He swallows, grows a pair, and finally gives voice to the one thought he hasn’t been able to shake since he heard Dean make that comment. “You think that means I’m his Mate?”
The other few Aurors who deigned to attend Malfoy’s going-away party step forward and offer him handshakes or cards or the occasional trinket. Ron’s gift is definitely the most thoughtful, and Harry suddenly feels like a complete pillock because he hasn’t got Malfoy anything at all. He stands in the corner of the break room, a piece of chocolate cake sitting untouched by his elbow, and he scowls. Sometime later, Malfoy comes up to him, bumping his shoulder into Harry’s in that casual way he’s done for five sodding years now.
“Ah,” said Lucius. “And I take it the families of Muggleborns who already know of magic would not be enough?”
Harry smirked. “Whoever said Slytherins were cowards, I wonder? You lot’ll do anything for your name in a book.”
Across the room, Astoria caught Draco’s eye. Even sitting by the fire, she was pale. Her eyes were wide as they locked onto Draco’s.
It didn’t occur until mid-morning that Scorpius could’ve woken up at any time the night before, come looking for him, and found Draco’s cock rubbing against Albus’s dad’s. Fortunately, Draco’s luck held out.
“Helga’s family crest was of a badger, which became our mascot. A badger’s often underestimated, because it lives quietly and doesn’t mess with anyone else... but when it’s provoked, it can fight off animals much larger than itself, even wolves. We’re like that,” Eloise said, dipping an apple slice in caramel. She scraped the extra off before it could drip and popped it into her mouth. “The other houses underestimate us, but we don’t lose when one of our own is attacked. It doesn’t matter how big the enemy is; we are bigger.”
She gave him a confused look. “Boxers cover the same as swim trunks.” And then she was gone, replaced by a bouncing Dennis who had a Polaroid hanging from the strap around his neck and a magicamcorder in one hand.
“Potter!” Snape said, alarmed. He’d moved to the back of his painting as if that would save him if acid exploded onto the canvas. “Are you mad?”
Was this a fantasy, too? It felt like it. It felt too sparkling, too overwhelming to be real. Kissing someone had never made Harry’s whole body went warm like kissing Malfoy did.
Harry looks a little closer and notices something off about the silken dressing gown Malfoy’s modelling. It’s falling open almost indecently. The line isn’t quite right. There’s—
Malfoy yawns again before snuggling deeper into Harry’s warm spot. “Male Veelas don’t have allure, Potter,” he says, and the ‘Obviously’ is understood. “We have to
‘ You are so stupid, Draco! Why can’t you just accept the offer! I’m going to tell Cassiopeia about this, she won’t be pleased!’, she said as she walks away towards the girl dormitory, grunting under her breath.
He actually couldn’t believe it, father gave Harry his blessing marrying him into the Potter’s family, he knows father wants him to uphold the Malfoy name but he rather took Harry’s. Besides, Draco Potter has a little nice touch to it.
‘Wait a minute, I’ll follow you’, said Draco. He stood up with his precious book in his hand and followed Cassie out of the Hall, he have to calm Cassie because an angry Cassiopeia Malfoy is not going to be a good day for him.
Although the Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup, Slytherin was still on the lead on the house points so in that case, Slytherin are going to win the House Cup but fate and luck are never on his side.
When Draco was in the room, he closed the door behind him quietly and addressed his sister,“You know I accidentally found a photo album that mother never addressed it to us, and I wanna see what's in it so let's find the album that has a purple cover. Now servant of mine, SEARCH”, he laughed and started searching.
When Jamie lifted his head up, there were already prickles of tears at the corner of his eyes. Draco brings his hand to stroke his son’s soft black hair, although he still wouldn’t make himself sit in Draco's lap, he let him thread his fingers through his hair.
“Wait, so you really do have the scar?” she asked while jabbing her finger on her forehead. Harry then lifts up his messy fringe and shows it to them. Cassie watched with fascination in her eyes.
Mother was beside him when she whispered softly to his ears, “Don’t listen to him, I just wanna tell you that whatever house you are in, I will be proud,” while caressing his cheek.
The healer approached him, “Well Mr Black, a congratulation should be necessary. Your wife gave birth to a beautiful and healthy boy, weighing around 3.5 kilogram. You could visits your wife but she is asleep from exhaustion.” He held out his hand for the man to shake it.
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of the line, put on the hat which fell down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause-
“Bonjour! Welcome to Les Constellations Sombres, are you all ready to order?” greets Draco while flashing them a polite smile and demeanour, hands are waiting to take their orders.
‘I don’t want to sound like I don’t appreciate living with the Malfoys, Mother loves me as much as she loves her very own daughter, she really could have just treated me like Father did, put a lot of expectations in me and Cassie just to show that the Malfoy’s are better than other Pureblood family’, with his arms stiffed besides his body, he didn’t dare to hug him back because he never hug someone who is Father’s age, especially Father.
He should be sorry for him for disturbing his sleep but he was scared of being in an Uber late at night with a stranger so his fear wins.
“Jamie! Stop!”, said Draco sternly while looking at his son, grabbing his hand before he could chuck some more spaghetti on his poor father.
At this point, Peeves was messing around with them but he’s not going to call for Flich until the wanker, Weasley shouted at him.
“I know you are going after the stone and the person behind it was Quirrell. I know because there’s one time I sneaked out at night, I heard him talking to someone without stuttering, so whenever I spoke to him the next time, I would stuttered and one day he can’t take it anymore, he lectured me without his stutter. So whatever you do Gryffindorks, Good luck”, explained Draco and he turned his back around, without waiting for them, or even looking at their shock expressions.
Harry looked up at her, smiling from the cat’s reluctant purrs. His fringe fell aside, and he knew the moment when she spotted his scar.
It was still early morning here, though it was surely lunchtime back in Scotland. The morning sunlight spread over the Queen’s face and washed her features away until she was just a red-clothed body with a face of light, surrounded by two advisors with concerned faces and voices too low to make out.
“Yes,” said Draco, and neatly ignored the part where Hermione had been angling for him to tell her what it was without her having to ask. Harry hid a smirk behind his not-faux beer. He liked the way Draco’s eyes slid to the side a bit when he was especially pleased with something he’d done; he liked the way the grey of them reflected light from an angle. He liked pretty much everything.
He always likes to finish Draco first, so he can be fully present, hear every sound, taste every inch. After, only after Draco unloads himself in Harry’s mouth will he reach down with trembling hands and touch himself, or so he can flip Draco back and bury himself to the hilt in his body. He’ll decide when he gets there.
The next morning, they’d fought spectacularly, and Draco’d stormed out, and when Harry’d come home from work that night, Draco’s things were gone. He doesn’t have to remember the gutted feeling he had in the moment he realised it; he still feels it.
Luna finally looks back down at him, blinking as her eyes adjust from having stared straight into a row of
“This is outrageous!” said a man with a heavy accent. “First we hear from an actual Muggle. This woman is nearly Muggle herself! And they are telling us not to overreact like—”
Madam Pince appeared aggrieved when he asked where the Potions section was. She pointed wordlessly, and Harry followed the gesture to the north corner of the library where the wall sconces seemed to be struggling against the shadows.
He pushed past him, and tried to push him from his mind as well. He took the back stairs up to the seventh floor in a bit of a panic. Had he really just said he wanted to be a Potions Master? Wasn’t anyone going to remind him that he was rubbish at Potions?
They were called in alphabetical order again, which would have been fine if Harry wasn’t in the same group as Draco and Parkinson. He did his best not to let it affect him, but he could still see the look Draco wore in his mind’s eye, and it made him miss him desperately.
. It almost made the circumstances under which he did so bearable. He felt both jubilant and terrified; thrilled and guilty. This was his life’s dream, but it threatened his whole world.
When he returns to his own desk, Draco’s file is still sitting there untagged and unfiled. He’ll have to activate the sodding translation charm again (why can’t Draco write his fucking reports in English? Harry knows he can; he’s read seven years of the prick’s reports and they were all in English) but even that doesn’t ruin the soft high he has from making a friend and the free beetles he had in lieu of biscotti with his coffee.
Harry scowls, looking down and away at the cruelty-free mousetrap set beneath the window. “I don’t want him to be unhappy.”
—she’s getting it delivered to our terrace every single morning. The Floo transfer fees for a single paper are twice the monthly rate!”
The cat turned to Draco, staring at him dourly through her big, black-rimmed eyes. Harry rubbed her tummy and she made a rumbly noise. “She’s a squib.” And before Draco could comment on that, “And she’s great.”
“This is where Transfigurations comes in,” Draco said. He swished his wand once, and the sludge turned hard as stone, and perfectly spherical. He swished it again, and the clear liquid did the same.
In his tank, Seabiscuit was giving Draco a pleading look. Harry was going to miss the little bastard, but he rather thought Seabiscuit would be glad to see the back of him.
Dudley had exited his own bed and was sitting by Ms Williams’s, holding a low-voiced conversation with her as she took impossibly small bites of her chocolate bar. Ms Lovecraft, who was in Draco’s fifth-year Ancient Cultures and Casting class, and Potter were both out cold. Mr Lao was leaning over Potter, running a number of diagnostics with his wand. He frowned at the readings and retreated to the Matron’s office, presumably to pull Potter’s chart.
That was unfair. Shacklebolt was restrained by international laws; he had to do things by the book or risk trial before the entire world, which would certainly slow down the process. Harry had heard from various Weasleys that Shacklebolt had put good people on the task, including the Department of Mysteries, but that’s all he’d heard. No results yet. Maybe none ever.
“Fuck!” Harry said, at the same time that Draco leapt up from the table and made some sort of half-yip, half-whoop sound that wouldn’t have been out of place at a Cannons match, but definitely would have at Malfoy Manor.
The best part of a volcano wedding theme was that volcanoes spewed out lava, which was red, and sparks, which were gold. Harry was very good at decorating in Gryffindor colours.
Ron didn’t care. “Stick with fish and chips if you like. Meanwhile, Hermione and I will sample all the delicious foods of the world, won’t we, Hermsy?”
Potter gave him a small smile, but it reached his eyes, and that was all that mattered. He reached out, took Draco’s hand in his own, his fingers brushing against Draco’s wrist.
“Watching Peppa upstairs,” Mrs Granger said. “I reckoned it would keep them out of your hair for a few hours.”
“It’s mind over magic,” Draco said. “You have to command your magic to come home. You people can do that right?”
He ended up going back to the dungeons alone, stopping briefly by the kitchens to grab a snack. He was once again thinking about the Ministry when he entered the barrels. The homework Orkney set them after Neville’s article kept him busy, but didn't improve his mood. The UMN was a slow moving beast, made up of ambassadors from over one hundred countries and territories. It often took them months to come to a decision on resolutions put forward. They didn’t have months. The magic keeping magical Britain hidden was likely to start flickering and fading within months. It wouldn’t be enough to completely expose them, but it would certainly put a strain on their Obliviators – assuming the UMN would allow them to Obliviate more than UK's annual quota.
– the druid lore is in there, in an appendix. No one is an expert right now; we’re all having to become ones because this is important. You’re no further behind than anyone else.”
Draco spun him round and pressed him against the door. All the breath rushed from Harry’s lungs. “Potter. You can’t keep doing this to me.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Are you going to be able to do this, Potter?” He set his silverware aside and turned to face Harry more fully on the bench. “Or should we end this now?”
“I’ve always liked Hannah,” said Draco. “She was with Theo for a while, as I recall.” He gave Neville a sly look, to which Neville rolled his eyes. Draco huffed. “I did like her, actually. She was never afraid of Slytherins and she laughed at my Gryffindor jokes. And now look where she is.”
Experimentally, he presses his bum up and Draco slides in deeper. It doesn’t feel especially wonderful in any physical sense, but the feeling of
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, but didn’t shoot him down. Which was why it was so easy for Harry to keep running his mouth and making a fool of himself.
Hermione swore under her breath. Harry was, frankly, impressed with the variety of words and combinations thereof that Hermione could come up with when she put her mind to it. However Hermione wanted to
Harry did know. He wondered if Scorpius was cute...if he was having fun with Malfoy’s secretary, whomever that was, if he was happy...if he needed another parent.
“Not beyond the front page showing the Cannons’ tie with Puddlemere,” said Narcissa. “Which was quite an upset, but not terribly
"Cum terra filiorum, si quid voles." - join with the children of this land, if it pleases you (roughly)
“Bit of a squib, that one is.” She paused to chuckle at her joke. “Full blooded kneazle and not a drop of magical prowess in her whatsoever.”
“It’s my excursion and we’ll go where I want to go,” came her muffled voice. “I need give you no explanation.”
“Well,” Harry agreed. Draco hadn’t made it down to breakfast yet. He wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or disappointed.
It was, Draco thought, a singular representation of Atlantis itself: a beautiful piece of forgotten magic, trapped in time and space. The mechanics of the spell were formed around a metaphorical shield, but the shield itself was just that—a metaphor. It wasn’t a true ward in that it created a barrier between Atlantis and what was outside Atlantis. The barrier was time itself, woven in a net.
To Harry he said: “I have an aristocratic surplus of middle names, Potter. None of which I like, none of which were truly necessary. They’re just thrown in to appease important ancestors, so their portraits don’t make a scene when we have company.”
Harry’s shirt hem bunched around Draco’s fingers and the girls began to tow them up. Padma and Hermione’s feet were kicking slowly, smoothly, to help guide the levitation charm — doing their best to get them to the surface fast without disturbing the weakened Bubblehead Charm they shared.
“What.” Snape was still in one of his bitter-about-having-a-kneazle-named-after-him moods. It almost made Harry wish he’d stayed with Ginny. He would’ve gone one better and named a
“I didn’t have my wand, so I punched the closest one to me and knocked it out cold, then I went for the other but it saw me coming, and it screamed something in this horrible language, and then this horrible green light came straight down and they both just…disappeared!”
She shoved back from the table and ran from the house, so quickly that she’d almost made it to the door before her chair finally hit the floor. A rush of cold wind whirled past them as the door slammed shut. For a beat, silence. Then Ginny ran after, and the cold air sailed over them a second time. Harry tipped his head back, and wondered if he believed in God, and if so, would God give him the strength to bear the things he could not change et cetera et cetera.
“You know, I can actually give you a ride home if you want to,” Harry offers sincerely just by the looks of his eyes, “I came with a bike so yeah. I would love to give you a ride home. Wait wait you know what, I can’t take no for an answer. I have to force you to accept the offer.”
They were walking down the stairs to the dungeon, they came to a stop in front of Potion classroom. Professor McGonagall knocked on the door twice before Severus opened it. When the door was opened, McGonagall greeted him.
So, before the first of April came, he already worked on the object. A bell that had been charmed so that whoever walked under it, their cloak will change it colour. He had the help of a Slytherin 6th year who named was Sarah Himberland, a half-blood to put disillusionment spell on the bell.
“Mama”, called Jamie softly, he couldn’t keep his eyes open but he still adamant about taking his nap.
“Why the fuck you did not wake me up?” gritted his teeth slightly, looking at his husband dead in the eyes. “You are always tired, dragon. I want to give you a little rest,” he explained while patting the empty space next to him.
A moment later, he tilted his son’s face, looking at him, “What’s wrong my baby?” Jamie was silent but his mouth was trembling with fear, “Mama don’t know how to fix it if you didn’t tell me.”
‘ STUPEFY’, as he pointed his wand at the troll, He thanked Merlin because it work. Once the spell hit the troll, he fell to the ground with a loud thunk.
At Halloween night, while he was enjoying the Halloween feast, Quirrell came rushing into the Hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table and gasped, ‘Troll- in the dungeons- thought you ought to know.’ He then sank to the floor and lied there fainting.
Harry Potter, 35 years old DADA professor, desires Draco Malfoy who is 16 years old. He knew it was a huge age gap, he knew it was wrong.
Severus was looking at him with a slight smirked at the corner of his haughty mouth and he was not quite sure if he liked it.
Potter pounded into him hard enough leaving bruises on his waist, where Potter’s arms holds onto him tightly. A few minutes later, Potter cum in him with a grunt, a pure bliss showed on his face. Both of them are sweating, red faced. Potter kissed him soundly and flashes him a bright smile as he pulled out.
“It seems that you are hundred and one percent fucking wrong because his husband IS the boy who lived - twice I might add,” looking at him up and down, eyes intimidating, daring the stranger to challenge him. “And before your children might come from a sperm donor, better get the fuck out of my sight,” challenge Harry.
Severus crossed his arms and asked him, ‘So Draco? What do you think? Do you want to be in the Slytherin Quidditch?’
Draco wound up his arms around Harry when he felt a rough hand squeezing his buttocks that made him whimpered into the kiss.
So, Draco should be a gift from them thanking him for saving them from wasting their miserable life in Azkaban and he’s going to claim it.
People were looking at him with surprise, he too saw some enviousness in some of the girl’s eyes. When he turned his head to look at his boyfriend, Harry was gawking at him with open mouth, eyes filled with lust.
When they finally get to Hagrid, Draco let out a relieved breath as Potter slide down from Firenze’s back. Before the centaur walks away, he turns towards Draco and said, “Blonde haired - you’re a great boy so don’t let vengeance consume you.”
He sat there silent, waiting for a word coming out of his mouth. They stare into each other's eyes when out of nowhere, Harry chuckles.
“Scorpius looks exactly like you when you were born, Draco,” said mother finally after being silent for a long time, she was probably so shocked that Scorpius looks a lot like Draco it reminds her of the time when she gave birth to him.
Why is he trying to bring back the shameful incident in his face? He had throw the memory away at the very back of his brain and forgotten about it for a very long time, never going to recollect the stupid incident that makes him dislike Potter and his friends.
“I did everything I could, it’s not that I was abandoning him,” muffled Draco into his hands, Harry knew that his husband was stressed and tired because Draco slept earlier than usual, he helped where he could, especially with Jamie, trying to replace the void of absent Draco whenever the twins needed Draco.
“Yeah you are the one to talk with having a mighty cock hanging between your legs. Do you know what I have? A vagina and a uterus and you know what they do every month?! Bleed!”
The beast or dog had three heads, six eyes were looking at them Longbottom was quivering besides him.
The healer told him that his baby’s head was already out, few more pushes then he can welcome their third child into the world. He gave all he might and pushed out their third child into the world, he sagged in relief when he heard the sound of their third child wailing.
“You are so beautiful, Draco. Do you even know that you are so fucking perfect? Fuck sometimes I’m afraid that this is all a dream and I’m going to wake up without you by my side.” Murmuring as he kisses him as hard as he could give.
Cassie, who appeared was joining them in listening to their conversation without them realising, crossed her arms and glared at Theo, abandoning her food.
Regulus is running and jumping around trying to catch a blue butterfly that was teasing him and when he failed, he grumbled and went back to Draco, nose nudging him to transform into his wolf form.
“Fuck you, Draco”, murmured Cassie under her breath as she smiled, scared that father heard her using the word of profanity, Draco snickered as he pushed the door opened, the bell that hang on the door clanged indicating that they have a customer.
“Hello, Scorpius. I’m your mama, “ greeted Draco as he did with Adrian minutes before, when he was in his arms. He got the information that the twins were fifteen minutes apart.
“You promise?” she asked in a weak voice, sounding unsure of whatever was going through her mind right now.
“And you know what, I had something on my mind that I have to complete. Good luck on the dragon hatching and hope that you did not get caught by anyone and if you’re lucky enough if I don’t blabber my mouth”, said Draco and with that, he left them there and walked away, satisfied without turning back to look at their expression but he did heard Potter muttering something about him being a prat.
‘Then how in the bloody hell you took the right ingredients’, asked Draco. He was confused since Potter is the one who took the ingredients, how would he not know how the ashwinder egg looks like.
“Don’t be such a dramatic bitch, Draco,” said Pansy as she rolled her eyes at him after a few minutes of him keeping his silence, Blaise nodding his head agreeing to what she said. “You said I was obsessed! With him nonetheless.”
‘Bloody hell, the hat could read my mind, shit shit shit, not just this hat is dirty but it is also a nutter’, he thought to himself and chuckled.
She just wish that she wasn’t as stupid as she was seven years ago just to find comfort in which she thought of him as her mentor, desperate to please others.
“Three deadly hours, I wish I could just storm in there and demand to see my fucking wife! There was no fucking news on her either,” the man answered deadly and anxiously. Before the man could say anything else, the door to the labor room opened and a healer came out, He quietly closed the door behind him.
Looking at him, he has decided to talk to him right now, “Can you call Jamie for me, he doesn’t even look my way whenever I called for him,” begged Draco to help him. Jamie was having a problem with him but not his father. Save to say that he was quite jealous and wanted to be in Harry’s position.
He knows how to use the muggle camera now that he went to the Muggle Studies professor for help discreetly without anyone notice especially his Slytherin’s friends, what would they said if they saw him having a conversation with the professor.
The moment is precious to him. He promised to himself that he will marry Draco one day and have little Potters running around his house. He doesn’t care anymore about their huge age gap.
The thud of a metal went flying pulling him out his thinking, when he looked over, both Mr Weasley and father went tumbling to the ground, they were tussling on the ground, Cassie was holding his hand really tightly that it hurts and she was closing her eyes, afraid to look at them.
Draco turned his head sideways, asking for a kiss, pursing his lips, Harry obliged and deeply kissed him, showing his love toward the 16 years old by the kiss.
Draco’s petite breasts are just in front of his face, milk leaking out of it just for being horny. Without thinking, Harry brought his mouth to his nipple and sucked hard, harder than his babies ever did.
“These things—they’re called crop circles by Muggles—they’ve shown up all over England for years. Sometimes they turn out to be fakes, made by bored Muggle teenagers with some rope and a couple two-by-four planks.”
He hoped they were doing the right thing. A small part of him wanted to un-link his hands and step back from the ritual circle. He was afraid they were incorrect, that they would damn them all to experimentation under Muggle hands. The rest of him knew that they
They were silent. Harry glanced around, seeing thoughtful looks everywhere, finally settling on Draco, who was staring at Harry with an expression he’d never seen before.
The man at the head of the table, still standing and looking unfortunately overrun by his own ICW-issue robes, gave them an overdone smile.
Harry was coming to the same conclusion, and horror-struck by the implications of it. “He was working on sevens when we Obliviated him. You Obliviated his knowledge of
The others settled in around the bonfire with marshmallows and popcorn to wait. It was tenser than any of the other times Harry had ever come out here with Hufflepuff. The school year had been marked by impending disaster, but tonight was different; tonight they would find out what the problem was… and if they could continue with their plan for the landfills.
Next Sunday is Draco’s birthday and a century to the day since Harry first kissed him. He thinks about the Mirror of Erised sometimes and regrets not listening to Dumbledore. He has dwelled on dreams and forgotten how to live. Harry stares into the fire and he aches.
Harry’s guts twist like dud Christmas crackers that just keep pulling and pulling with no resolution.
Harry pulled himself to his feet. Dizzily, he stumbled into Draco, and was immediately crushed within his arms.
The alien was deathly white, unnaturally so. There was no melanin to protect this creature from sunlight, suggesting it hadn’t left its spaceship for more than a few nighttime outings in generations. It was long and thin, lacking almost any musculature, its body more a vehicle for the mind. It wore a top and trousers, both made of the same shiny, unnatural-looking metallic fabric, and its shoes were no more than slippers.
Harry ordered the coconut short-ribs with groundnuts, but Draco ordered the lamb-cassava risotto and when their food came out, he desperately wanted to try some. Fortunately, Hermione also ordered it, so he just took some from her plate. She rolled her eyes and stole one of his groundnuts in return. Neither of them were interested in Ron’s sundried tomato thing.
He glanced out at his sea of students and found, to his satisfaction, that they were listening raptly.
“I’m surprised the Slytherins and Ravenclaws managed to write anything up at all, given how short our trip was cut, but every one of them managed to pull something relevant from the experience and write twelve inches on it. Ms Prance had a number of things to say on the resiliency of feather headdresses during magically-induced sonic booms. I’ve done the initial read through and sent them all up to your office. You think you’ll have time to mark them before their first class?”
“Just rain,” said Harry. He was leant back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. Honestly, the sooner he could get away from this sleazy, sneaky, thievish—
Reluctantly, Harry looked up, finding both Hermione and Ron watching him with ill-disguised concern. “What?”
They watched the papers daily for reaction from the Muggles. Witnesses from Wales were giving interviews, but the atmosphere was still a sceptical one. They were, true to form, playing it off as tricks of the eye and natural phenomena. No one was saying the word ‘magic’ and if they were, it was ironically. The
what a vagina looks like?” Draco asks, leaning up on his elbows to get a closer look. “It’s so odd.”
Harry eyed the mushroom more carefully. He plucked it up and checked the inside of the stem. Cottony, not hollow. He tossed it in his bag. “Good. I don’t want a real morel, I want a false morel.”
“Is no one going to think about how gross as fuck it would be to put that nasty landfill magic in a bunch of innocent kids?” Harry asked. This magic came from the seeping rot of Muggle waste. It was trapped by toxins and chemical waste, muddled with carcinogenic polymers and radioactivity. It was vile. Logically, he knew they were cleaning it; emotionally, he was grossed out.
“Are these bat wings?” said Lee, suddenly more interested. “I haven’t had those in ages. I didn’t think Muggles ate them. Look kinda big, though.”
“Maybe,” said Draco, but then his expression shifted to something like worry. “I think it would really depend on how much he trusted
“And my godson,” Harry quickly added. “Teddy, this is Sergeant Boden. He works for the Obliviators.”
“Oh,” said Harry. They looked at each other, and it was another full thirty seconds before Harry realised what Draco meant. His heart jumped into his throat, and pounded furiously. “What?”
Harry collapsed on top of Draco, breathing heavily. Draco’s hair fluttered against his nose every time he inhaled, which was both annoying and also something Harry could get used to absurdly easily. Draco’s hands slip up from his hips to drape over his back. They lay there atop the old Grimmauld Place dining table cum work table, catching their breaths.
“Nothing I could pinpoint. Nothing really specific in the papers that I saw while I was passing the news agent, nobody saying anything particular. They were just acting…differently. Everyone seemed to be on high alert. No one was at ease.”
He pressed his hips forward helplessly, and Draco smirked at him. It made Harry want to growl. Instead he just resumed the movement of his hand over Draco’s prick, watching his face flush and his hair curl from humidity like when he brewed potions.
He redirected his attention to Draco. “What’s wrong?” he asked again. He looked at the clock. “And shouldn’t you be at work?”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco whispers after a moment. There’s a telltale hitch in his breath. “My hormones are still fucked up. You can’t say shit like that. You have to stop being so amazing.”
He pressed hard, twisted his hand at the tip of his cock. Merlin, he was so close. He fucked his fingers in and out of his slick hole, paying no attention to how tired his forearm was, barely even noticing it. His cock was dribbling, so, so close.
“I know. I think we should just let it go,” said Hermione. “But the ICW’s committed to this path, and I’ve got to help them do it.”
Harry laughed. “You’d be surprised how exhausting unrelenting humiliation can be. Shouldn’t you be scavenging for clues to my heart?”
He forced himself to think about the Forbidden Forest—his preferred method of meditating. The trees grew up Perylene Black all around him. It was dark, but there was enough starlight to see the forest floor. He began to walk, and the leaves crackled beneath his feet. It was soothing and quiet, and he could almost forget about the presence of Draco, following carefully behind him.
Then he remembered Ron had taken a two-month assignment in the Outer Hebrides and wouldn’t be back until Christmas. He was always taking long assignments. As he was thinking this, his self-evaluation survey popped into his inbox. Harry scowled, snatched it up, and ticked ‘Outstanding’ for every question, then popped it into his outbox. It disappeared a moment later.
It was lapses in judgement such as thinking more time with students was a good thing that got people like Malfoy hired on at Hogwarts as Professors of Ancient Cultures and Casting. Who the fuck cared about ancient spells? No one even used them anymore.
And that’s all he needs to say before Ron’s expression goes hard and he says, “Tell me what you need from me, Harry.”
“Mother caught me as I was walking by the Floo and I couldn’t get out of dinner,” Draco says when Harry walks in from a weekend shift to find him tying a cravat in front of the mirror. “I told her I’m bringing a guest. Don’t forget you lost.”
Harry shrugged. Mrs Weasley seemed to do household magic without thinking about it, but he’d always assumed she
Now that the professional Quidditch season had started in earnest, he, Malfoy, and (unfortunately) Boot, listened to the games on the wireless at night. Harry yipped and yelled every time one of his players brought in more points, and he was surprised and delighted at how animated Malfoy was with his own excitement.
Pansy was still, inexplicably, holding her teacup from their interrupted catch-up in the staff room. The tea threatened to spill over with every rushed step they took, only some latent magic in the tea set keeping it all inside.
Quill was not impressed by the shark, though that was perhaps putting it quite nicely. In actuality, Harry was concerned that Quill did, in fact, piss himself when he saw it approaching. He hid himself behind Harry. The water got warmer, and Harry would’ve gagged if he wasn’t underwater with a Bubble-head charm on. He glanced over his shoulder to give the man a disgusted look and swam, slowly, away from the shark, trying not to provoke it with any sudden movements. Ruby and Malfoy were treading water near to one another, keeping a steady eye on the shark and well alert of their surroundings, but, like Hermione, remaining otherwise unphased.
She expertly poured twelve juices into biodegradable disposable cups, taking care not to rouse suspicion as she flicked her wand beneath the counter and raised a light privacy spell around her, him, and Dudley.
His son, who he was seeing less and less now that they he, Draco, and Astoria were all living in the castle. Scorpius had rarely seen his mother during their travels, and he was making up for it by staying with her every night, with no sign of returning to his room in Draco’s suite more than once every other night. Given how frustrated Draco’d been while creating his lesson plans, he supposed he couldn’t blame Scorpius.
Severus was silent for a few moments, only slow, black blinks to show he was still conscious at all. Finally, he said, “Have you looked up recently?”
“I know,” Draco agreed, and his fingers began plucking at the top button of Harry’s shirt, sending tingles all down his torso. “I don’t give those, anyway.”
“Severus, be serious,” McGonagall said. “I know you never cared much for the art, but Transfigurations changes a body at the most basic level. It isn’t just the form that changes, it is also the function. When a witch or wizard has an Animagus form, he or she
Lucius’s smile morphed to a smirk. “Yes. The Muggle Artefacts Department has been so severely understaffed for so long that they’ve never even looked at most of the items they’ve confiscated or had turned in to them. I nearly went to Siberia the first time I came across one. Fortunately, I was wearing the signet ring and it shielded me. After that, I kept an eye out for more. And there
Malfoy rolled onto his back, looking everywhere but at Harry. “It’s not what you think. Not…not exactly.”
“About seven-twelfths blood, I suspect,” said Lee, still trying to figure out the coffee. Harry, uncharitably, said nothing. They all had to learn Muggle life for themselves, and he was still bitter about there not being a kettle.
Harry nodded and wrapped his free hand around Malfoy’s wand hand, their fingers intertwining as they had that first night, when—
All at once, those assembled began to yelp, give low whistles, as they looked at something only they could see. A few took out their mobiles and snapped pictures of the empty air before them, then the rest followed.
He pushes through to the bar, miraculously finds an empty spot to stand, and raises his fingers for the bartender. She comes over, eyebrows up in question. The music’s too loud to even make an attempt at speaking, which works out well for Harry. Occasionally, he does have good luck these days. It’s rare though. He used up most of his during his developmental years.
“Shaad likes it hot, don’t you, buddy?” Ziyad says, as Shaadhon bounds and jumps up Harry’s legs, front feet braced on his thighs and feelers tickling Harry’s face. His mouth is open and panting, rows and rows of sharp gleaming teeth on display. Harry grins at him and scratches him behind the ears. He should take a picture for Hagrid if he makes it out of this damned city alive.
Dudley turned back to Snape, who was currently petting one of Harry’s earliest Scottie attempts. “Anyway, I picked something up for you, Professor Snape.”
Harry noted that, despicable or not, she was still wearing her red swimsuit. She’d also brought a book.
Draco’s eyes flattened. “Spare me your Gryffindor pathos,” he said. “I’m not doing this for random twats. I’m doing this for my family.”
Even with the back seats folded down in the Rover, they were only able to fit twenty in. They were able to fit another four in the front passenger seat. That left eight.
“Not to worry, Nott,” said Harry, who was really hitting his stride after visiting a Muggle bridal show with Hermione that week. He had
Draco turned to stare at him. “You know wizard musicians, too? Just how long have you Muggles been infiltrating our world? Have I really missed that much since I left Britain? Is today’s utter demolition of the Statute of Secrecy—the only thing keeping Muggles from obliterating all of us with their new-clear weapons—really nothing to talk about because wizards and Muggles have just been
Neither of them mentions the fact that Harry already had been able to speak around Draco while under extreme emotional distress or the thralls of passion. It’s none of their fucking business, and really, there are some mysteries Harry can go to his grave without obsessing over. Not many, but a few.
Harry shook his head, still smiling. “Nothing. Nothing’s funny at all. This is the most amazing moment of my life.”
Or the stark look on his face, returning from the school trip with his students. The way his whole body had been tense, strung tight, as he waited for each of them to be seen to. The way he’d spoken to Pansy as a colleague, an equal, when she’d come to check on her students. How his fingers had gripped so tightly to his wand it was a wonder it didn’t sink right into his skin.
There weren’t even any familiar items; his trunk had been destroyed during seventh year and the one he had now was a brand new replacement. The beds looked so different from those in Gryffindor. He’d left Hedwig’s cage in Ron’s bedroom at the Burrow, where it would probably sit forever, gathering dust, until the next set of Weasleys came around and it was time for the eldest to go to Hogwarts and Ron and Hermione – who’d probably be married – would say, “Oh you know, I think there’s a spare cage in Ron’s old bedroom. Let’s use that one instead of buying a new one. Waste not, want not.”
Draco turned from his contemplation of the street outside the window when Harry set his whiskey in front of him. “I asked for a pink umbrella charm and a swizzle wand, but Rosmerta said she’s out of poncey paraphernalia. Sorry.”
“I have been in love with you for eight years, Draco. That’s the secret I’ve kept. But that was well before the flood—before I realised it myself and completely lost it for you. Emotions are heavy to hold, especially alone. I couldn’t fix them.”
“Yeah, got it.” He took Blaise by the arm and started pulling him up, his feet kicking harder to counteract Blaise’s unwillingness to rise without Draco.
Mrs Granger had clear, dark skin and wore her hair in the same small French braids Granger had taken to wearing in recent years. She had a lovely, wide smile with gappy teeth, but it was Mr Granger who’d obviously contributed his blood to Granger’s own…sturdily sized teeth.
She eyes him. Not suspiciously, because he’s been an Auror for seven years and he knows how to not look guilty by now. “You bored, Potter?”
…at least for the brief second between when your skin touches it or breathes in its dust and when your entire nervous system
Suddenly, her eyes lit up. “Harry!” she said, leaning across the table and nearly upsetting the fresh coffee their waitress had brought. “I’ve got it! Let’s start a business!”
A shadow fell over him. Harry blinked open his eyes, squinting against the bright sunlight. Michael and Malfoy stood there, both looking highly amused.
Being with Draco physically had not done anything to reduce his desire for him; it had increased it. Instead of satiating Harry, sex with Draco made him desire it more. He could hardly go a day without wanking off to him twice — and that was if they had a date that day. On days they couldn’t make their schedules fit long enough for a romp, Harry was back up to three to four wanks a day. It was not helping his productivity.
He trailed off, biting his lip and angrily mouthing words as he wrote. Harry couldn’t help smiling at it. He forgot to return to his book, and ended up watching Malfoy write the entire letter to his relatives in Massachusetts. He felt himself studying the sharp point of Malfoy’s jaw, and how his lip went white when he bit it, but immediately filled with colour again when he let go to mutter more disparaging words for his American cousin.
And then, of course, the not-so dark things. Things like this. He’d known it was possible to make this ward permanent. But most wizards would never take on the burden.
Dudley stared at his screen, then said, “Hey, everyone, you’ve probably noticed by now the fire and brimstone raining down from the skies. I hope you’re safe and your families are safe. If you pledged to help my cousin Harry perform a spell that would save the world, now’s the time. We’re doing it today.”
spell. Which, Draco thought, was cutting it a bit close. He had, naturally, not been consulted. For a literal Atlantis expert, he was being ignored quite a lot.
Lee and Malfoy both wore dour looks. Narcissa finally took a cautious, if elegant, bite of her noodles.
“Her Majesty is alive, but injured. I’ve taken her to the caves. They’re safest from the Creators. Come with me, hurry.”
He flipped it over and read the back, detailing the things afforded with said ticket. One hand reached over and gripped Harry’s knee hard. “It’s for pitch-side seating, with the
“When I signed up for this farce of a magicbox programme,” Malfoy said, “I had no idea you’d be the person I was competing for. But when I flew down from that bridge in Sydney and saw you standing there…it felt…right. Like we were always supposed to cross paths again, only this time, we weren’t supposed to diverge.”
“And then you just get a book and wait while a page swims up to see what you want. They’re delightful, really. Adolescent Mers actually look like the Little Mermaid. They have human—er, land human—colored skin when they’re young, and it greens with age, depending on the makeup of their environment, much like flamingos, only it helps for camouflage in this case—”
large. With the old Hufflepuffs joining them, there were almost sixty there in the clearing. He was suddenly overwhelmed by the immensity of Hufflepuff – an easily overlooked collection of people, who’d been hiding something this powerful all along. He’d never
“You’ve come to discuss our sudden reappearance in the world,” the Queen surmised, her voice deep. “This week promises to be an endless parade of visits by dignitaries and militaries. I suspect I’ll become an expert by the end. I am Queen Sostrate—” her voice rolling the name out:
Draco nodded shakily. “The spell works like this,” he began, barely noticing the three camera people coming around to get a better shot of him speaking.
The translator smiled, conversed with the reporter, and then said, “How do the non-magical participants become receptive to the magic? How do they focus?”
Harry nodded, and began to stir. At fifty, Draco’s fingers moved. He only managed to keep count because Draco began counting aloud, ‘
It was nearly eight when they reached Coddler’s. The sign on the door listed that as their closing time, but the man reading the paper at the till smiled – actually smiled – at Draco as he entered. He folded the paper down and Harry couldn’t help seeing the headline, the same one from that morning, which lamented the MUS refusing a vote to allow Britain to temporarily shut down the factories believed to be causing the magic die-off, as it would unduly harm Muggle lives. Harry supposed it didn’t matter what the UMN did at this point; Obliviations weren’t going to save them and neither was closing factories.
When his suite was empty again, Draco fell back onto the sofa, letting out a long sigh. A throat clearing above the fireplace reminded him that he was, in fact, still on display. Draco rolled his head in the direction of the portrait, eyes narrowed.
It didn’t take more than a couple of weeks before Narcissa was able to give them news about the rubbish osmosis ward for the shoreline. An ambitious project, but they were an ambitious group. It was heading into autumn now, and the leaves were beginning to colour and fall in the city. The mornings and nights were chilly, but the days still remained warm.
The dungeon was colder, more oppressive than Draco could ever remember it being. Their footsteps echoed on the flagstones and Draco tried to ignore the fact that if they just turned left towards the Potions lab instead of right towards the dormitories and Severus’s old quarters, the alien would be there.
“It may,” Jones said, nodding. “Can’t hurt.” She glanced at Harry. “Just NoMaj Chemistry? Why’d they send you?”
Merlin, he could come from this, probably. Hands shaking, he raised the burner to high. Draco’s fingers continued ghosting over his ribs, barely touching, leaving Harry in shambles. His wand buzzed, and even the tiny vibrations it made against his thigh set his skin afire, as
“I’ve got a 1910 High-Magic Scotch or a 1983 Basilisk’s Gaze Brandy, or even a Merlyn Welsh Cream Liqueur if you’re in the mood for it,” he called over his shoulder. “And there’s still the Old Lusty Centaur, too.”
Draco cleared his throat. Harry turned to to find him holding out a pair of top quality glass goggles.
Draco beamed at him. Their friends cheered. Through it all, Harry managed to make out Rosie’s, “You’ll let Mum and me coordinate it, right Uncle Harry?”
Draco shared a look of relief with Potter. Potter reached out, his fingers touching Draco’s wrist, and that one gesture did more to reassure him than anything else could have.
The first week of December, Draco was still a pathetic mess. It was a heady combination of late nights doing ridiculous experiments and equations, trying to add a wand variable into the Queen’s spell, combined with the most blowjobs he’d had in literal ages.
And so, all through the month of November, Harry was in high spirits. At one point, Hermione stopped by to ask him to lunch and caught him whistling while he was completing paperwork — a singularly suspicious occurrence. She had narrowed her eyes, but let it go when he refused to give her any details.
“Do the Muggles not have government authorities already in place surveilling the island?” asked one reasonable witch. “It’s a matter of time before they see it’s inhabited.”
“Just-fucked executive,” Harry corrects absently. He considers Malfoy in the three-piece watered-silk suit. “Basically the same thing, though. And Veelas can look swampy and just-fucked. Take off the jacket. I want him in just the trousers and waistcoat.”
“The first Snitch I’m going to give is to Ruby,” he said. Ruby manoeuvered his way down to the front to accept his Snitch. Harry handed it to him, smiling shyly. He said, “I think we had a good time today and yesterday.”
Harry followed the motion with his eyes, and was momentarily overcome by the memory of Draco’s sharp gaze focusing on him whenever he did wandless magic. He hadn’t done any since then. He hadn’t been able to.
Hermione and Lee seemed to both growl, low in their throats. “That slimy fucker,” Lee said. “How did he get elected? His entire campaign was ridiculous! Lies, sentences that didn’t make sense, contradictions, and the most obnoxiously bombastic attitude I’ve ever seen!”
Ruby smiled back, though it was a bit hard to see under his bright red beard. Harry imagined that beard against his bollocks as Ruby sucked him off, three fingers in his arse, and shuddered at the sensations it brought.
“Nope,” said Hermione. “I was just really frustrated that I couldn’t fit everything I needed in here, and when I opened it again, it was bigger.”
The wardrobe rattled again, and this time he could tell that it was definitely not a rat. “What do you suppose that is?” Hermione asked. She was already reaching for her wand up her sleeve.
Parker gave him a withering look. She turned back to Eloise and added, faux-whispering, “These bros ain’t loyal.” Eloise patted her head.
Malfoy scowled, but there wasn’t any heat behind it. “Well just so you know, I’m taking Hermes Kilgore for chaser this year and I
“Next time, follow the unspoken rules and wait for me to open the other end before you start shoving your face in my arse,” Draco muttered, and proceeded to step out the other end of the barrel with full dignity.
“Excuse me, excuse me,” about a dozen people said, passively annoyed, as they worked their way around Harry and Malfoy, stood stock still in the middle of the fucking pavement.
Harry looks at him askance, momentarily baffled. They usually don’t go six months between shag fests. More like two. Lately, it’s been closer to a few days apart, here and there. Harry’s never been sure if that means anything or if their mutual dwindling of ‘serious’ romantic partners has just pushed them closer together more frequently because they’re fucking lonely.
“Yeah, did pretty well for himself with the markets, you know?” said Dudley. “Got his pilot’s license a few years back, now he flies all around the bloody planet, posting obnoxiously idealistic pics to his Instagram.”
There’s another long, heavy pause, and a warning beep from the fireplace alerting Draco that his recording time is nearly up. He sighs and says,
?” asked Hermione. “That cruise ship has to be over 40,000 tonnes and a thousand feet long! There aren’t enough Mers in all of Britain to be able to move such a thing!”
Draco chokes and Harry gives him an imperious look. Harry snatches the black deck from him and lays down the top card: ‘What will I bring back in time to convince people I am a powerful wizard?’
For a long moment, none of the reporters or officials said a word. Then one of their mobiles chimed and he dropped it on the grass, his fingers clumsy with the same sort of adrenaline Harry knew all too well by now. But it broke the spell, and people started shouting questions out, not even bothering to raise their hands first.
“Your family is so weird, Gem,” Nikita Williams replied. “Muggles are just people without magic. As Professor Potter has been teaching us for, like, five years.”
It was like it had been made just for him. A sign that it was time to return home and begin to use what he’d gained to actually pull his family from ruin. To ensure Scorpius didn’t suffer for his father’s and grandfather’s mistakes.
“But could we just—I’ll stop,” Harry promised. “I won’t be…in love with you anymore. You were fine with it before, when I just wanted to shag you. Look, I’m already not in love with you. See? It’s me, Harry, not in love. It was just a momentary
Harry sipped his wine. He was starting to feel rather warm, with or without the winter cloak. “Oh? You seem remarkably invested in my wellbeing.”
“Even the Americans,” Draco said with satisfaction, but Harry could sense the unease hidden beneath his skin. Draco didn’t want to be exposed any more than Zach did. And really, neither did Harry. He wracked his brain, desperate for another solution. He wished he could think of anything at all that they could tether the magic to that would renew like people did, and thus keep it safe. He drew blank after blank after blank. And the rest of the Hufflepuffs were intrigued with the idea.
Draco studied him, and for once, Harry didn’t go hot under the scrutiny. He felt calmer now, having said all that. It was something Hermione and Ron knew, but Harry still didn’t like to vocalise.
Albus’s opinion of the situation immediately flipped, and not for the first time, Harry regretted his Muggle cousin moving into a magical community. Gin and Luna lived in Hogsmeade, too, but they certainly didn’t let Albus into Honeydukes as much as Dudley sneaked him treats from there.
He shook his head. “I’ve got to go. Good luck.”  He popped off, leaving the three of them to wait for Padma.
, but his heart’s not into it and he gives it up to stare at his ceiling. His stomach still feels weird, but only, strangely, when he’s thinking about the Partner-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
They looked up. A mass of Slytherins in Ravenclaw clothing, Lavender and Dean, were waiting. Justin was with them; he winked at Harry. He would never admit it aloud, but Pansy Parkinson looked markedly better in blue. “Are you ready to go?” she said. “We’re meeting in the library to look at Thomas’ diagrams. We might have something with the flowers.”
, Harry says, trying to figure out how to get a second finger in at this angle. He’s not sure, but he suspects one won’t be sufficient.
And then Dudley said, forcefully jovial, “God, I hope I don’t have some half-alien children out there somewhere.”
Harry shrugged. There was an illicit sort of thrill to leaving Hogsmeade during school. Students weren’t allowed to do that, but technically, they were of age and could do whatever they wanted. So long as McGonagall never found out.
The Queen, a woman of exemplary patience, turned and favoured Severus with a tight look, but no orders for execution. Perhaps she remembered his knowledge of relevant calendars. “Yes?”
Draco made a pained sound. Harry took his hand, and squeezed hard. Had the stone Conjuncted again? It should’ve made a sound like glass cracking under pressure, but it was hard to hear it over the screaming. They took a couple of steps closer, legs trembling from adrenaline.
Rees made an ‘ugh’ sound. “Really? No one’s going to follow? None of you are decent Hufflepuffs. I can’t believe you left your fellow badger to go through alone. We have our work cut out for us.”
There was a redoubtable meow. Draco retreated to instruct her at a remove, leaving Harry tensed from the threat of fresh claws sinking through his wool trousers. Millicent sipped Harry’s tea and he rather wished he’d put a shirt on at some point prior.
he then thought, dejected. And of course he would. He wouldn’t let even Malfoy get eaten by a shark.
“I kept one for Blaise and Pansy, mostly,” Draco explained. “They live on the continent now, and the magical societies are much more integrated there, like here.”
Malfoy is even graceful unlocking a door. Harry is amazed. He would be fumbling around, fingers trembling, legs shaking—but no, Malfoy is slick and suave and other adjectives that Harry’s forgotten in the haze of lust brought on by Veela hormones.
Harry, for his part, was on the verge of tears. “We have magic?” he said again, just to hear the words.
“I’m interested in the answer to this as well,” Draco said. His hair was mussed again. It reminded Harry of that one night, when he’d sprawled on Neville’s bed and made Harry choose him.
Harry thinks. But whatever. Playing secretary for the Embassy means he’ll be playing secretary for Malfoy. And
Others in the class nodded, and Orkney said, “I think that’s a fine idea. We’ve taken a different approach to magical defence this term, so let’s look at the proposal the Ministry’s put forth to solve the problem Mr Longbottom brought to their attention earlier this month.”
“It’s Australia,” said Harry. “And February. And we’re in a desert, basically.” It was easily 28C. Why anyone would wear a suit to a rock was beyond Harry.
Malfoy shrugged. “Being asked to solve an international crisis because I’m the only Potions Master qualified for it? It’s quite an honour.”
So the spell wasn’t useable in its current form. Queen Sostrate had been right about that. But it was a place to start. A plan to work from. They needed something different.
“Alright then. I’d be happy to do the breeding for you,” said Quincy. “Hermione, have your friend ship the animals to the Addams Mansion in Sundown, Lower Catskills, New York. My auntie will let me use her dungeon to do the breeding. It’s much better setup for any dangerous results than we have at home.”
They all turned to look at him. He’d gone white, and his mouth had fallen open as he listened to the person on the other end. Suddenly he pushed back from the dining table, knocking his chair over in the process, and grabbed the notebook stuck to the fridge by a magnet. He ripped it off, grabbed a pencil, and started furiously taking notes.
And something else strange about them – they were communal. The first morning Harry walked in one end of the bathrooms and ran into Sally-Anne Perks coming in the other, they’d both yelped and run back out again.
“Positive,” Harry said, with feeling. He clenched Draco’s hand in his. “Draco,” he said. “I stayed in the Auror force for you. Just to see you every day, to work with you and laugh with you and eat shit pub lunches with you. Work was my escape when we were good together. And then afterwards, it was my penance. Because I’m sorry. I didn’t realise you would’ve wanted more, and I know it was stupid of me to leave it this long, but when am I not stupid? And also, I want to point out that you left it this long, too.”
Potter followed Draco to his rooms, having released the alien into Hogwarts’ care—they’d secured it in the dungeon away from windows in case any of its comrades returned for it before Millicent had had a chance to take it on the telly. The whole staff had added layers of protection to the room, and while they’d left its legs under
Millicent rolled her eyes. “Leave it to the Jewish girl, of course. It’s like a cultural password. It comes from Hebrew scripture. We killed some arseholes we’d been at war with because they couldn’t pronounce the word the right way and we knew, therefore, they weren’t one of us.”
Draco looked down at Libby, and for the first time in days, Harry saw the Christmas spirit light up his face. “This smells like Draught of Terrified Death,” he said.
Draco nodded, but all it served to do was muss his hair against Neville’s pillow. “He was going to give me a chance. Before the war started. But I got him killed instead.”
“Merlin help you all,” Severus said, his eyes glittering. “The spell only worked on people currently on the island. And those it did—there have already been reported neurological damage: brain swelling, loss of hearing and other senses. The rest of the world just went mad—mass shootings all over, especially the US, that all started within minutes of the spell. Some people, instead of forgetting Atlantis, have forgotten their own names, their families, their careers.”
A series of memories flashed before him. He saw himself using the map to sneak down to Hogsmeade, a dozen instances of tip-toeing past Snape in his cloak, burning the planner Hermione got him for Christmas one year and telling her he must’ve lost it in Herbology, making Polyjuice Potion.
. It saves families from heartbreak by siphoning unnecessary love into something productive. It’s just that the unnecessary love used to come from dead partners and families. It gives that love to the survivors so that they can build something new. So that magic doesn’t die.”
“Probably not,” Hermione said, not without an apologetic look. “Potions-making isn’t just a science, it’s an art. There are rules, but the rules are so vast and detailed and bendy that it would take a lifetime just to learn the ones involved in a simple Pepper-Up Potion. Potions Masters understand the theory and use their instincts for the rest.”
Harry cleared his throat. “So, Transfigurations.” Malfoy made an agreeable noise, which was a good sign. “Why? I didn’t even know you were good at Transfigurations. I thought you were good at Potions.”
One thing was certain: there wasn’t a drop of clean water in the Chesapeake Bay. It was worse than the Thames.
And that was all that was said on the matter. Ron cleared his throat. “I suppose this is a good time to bring up Lavender,” he said.
Granger nodded, as though this were the end of it. “British Liaison Officers will have this sorted with our own government by the end of the day, I’m sure. They won’t be alerting the media. I don’t believe this is yet a breach of the Statute. We must simply ensure that going forward, the island is properly warded, that Muggle flight paths don’t—“
“That gets us closer,” Harry said. “If we can put a million in the Bay, and if we could entice them to breed themselves, it would only take about two years to filter the entire Bay. That’s not terrible, considering how long it took humans to fuck it up.”
“Good morning, Ms Pollen,” said Harry. “Friendly reminder that our magically-binding contract stipulated a ten Galleon penalty for every fifteen minutes late the flower arrangements were. I do hope we can continue to do business with one another in the future. How can my godson and I help you ensure it’s not another ten?”
“He’s serious,” said Malfoy, his voice strained. “There was…some kind of blood. The Demiguise mutt attacked it and scared it off. Potter was covered in this sour, stinking, black blood. Theo and Fleur Delacour-Weasley are testing it now.”
“Need you two to check out an identity theft at Gringotts. Somehow, someone managed to fool the anti-Polyjuice wards they put up after Potter’s tour through the countryside of ‘98. Goblins are furious, of course. Try not to piss them off even more, Potter.”
Harry takes a long drink of his water before the rage burning inside him quiets enough to speak. “Hermione, I think Ron could tell you that just because it isn’t a magical bond doesn’t mean it’s any easier to fix. I love you, but this is asking—a lot. It’s a lot.”
Draco couldn’t help snorting at that. It released some of the wound up tension in his gut and shoulders. He felt simultaneously keyed-up and drained, and his magic was off, wonky feeling, like it was still seeping out of his body, or like Potter’s was still seeping into his own, which was—frankly—terrifying and impossible. Improbable. Deeply inconvenient.
Narcissa’s hands were shaking. She was good at directing attention away from them, but Harry had known to look. He saw the tiny shivers she masked in straightening her hair, the larger tremble she hid by putting her hands on her hips when Draco said something opportunely controversial.
Harry laughed, though it felt brittle in his throat. “Malfoy’s really good at ignoring uncomfortable things. It’s all that pure-blood upbringing.”
“She isn’t much for rhyming verse,” Malfoy added. “Or, really, good prose at all. I suppose you’ve read the
Eloise slipped her arm into the crook of his elbow and led him to the centre of the circle. The fourth years stood in the innermost part, as they would go first. Around them, the seventh and eighth years waited.
Malfoy threw his head back, sighing at the ceiling. But he stood back and let the door open wider. Poseidon glared at them both. “Fine. Come in.”
The sound alerted the rest of the household, and suddenly there were a dozen or more people crowding into the tiny room. Millicent and Hermione were first to arrive, and then Ron, and Lavender, Ginny and Luna, who called down the stairs that he was awake. Harry heard Mrs Weasley yelling something into the floo, and then McGonagall was rushing up the stairs, and Snape was back in his frame, and it was, in short, a clusterfuck of Weasleys et al.
Draco glanced up at him. He looked like he could use a bar of chocolate himself, but Draco doubted he’d eaten one. Eschewing sugar and carbohydrates was all well and good, but Draco really didn’t think this was the time.
She was forthcoming in responses, surprisingly well-versed in magical theory and spell-crafting, but Draco supposed she would be. She had helped develop the spell they would use to save themselves. The last spell she had ever cast.
Draco lets out a small cry, his face in his hands. “Or I can choose to love a woman who loves someone else, for the rest of my life,
Draco shook his head. “No you’re overlooking the most important thing. Money is only as valuable as people let it be. Spiritually, it’s worthless. I was wrong about the galleon being the spirit. It’s the catalyst. The spirit of the transformation is what’s
Boot took up a conversation with Susan then; Millicent’s eyes followed their discourse for a moment, judging, then returned her gaze to him. “You think you’ll get an O?” she asked.
All three of them were silent. The absolute horror that information instilled in him…Harry could barely imagine it. Petunia slumped against him and Millicent and for a moment, Harry was afraid she was going to faint again.
“No, it was really quiet!” Yasmin Ghraib replied. To Harry, she added, “Even quieter than my mum gets when she’s about to yell at me.”
“The best we can do is keep showing you, letting you touch our hands and arms while we cast, check us for strings or hidden items. Perform magic on you, if you’ll let us. That might be easier to believe. Anyone?”
“Maybe they’re pretending to be Muggles?” Malfoy suggested, echoing Harry’s thoughts. He sounded as if the idea horrified him as much as it did Harry.
“Whoever it is,” Draco said tightly, “stop looking for them. It’s always better to not let on that you know you’re being watched.”
Malfoy stood and nodded his thanks at the welcome, then returned stiffly to his seat. Harry watched his hands stiffen by his plate. First-week nerves. Harry had had those, too. But he wasn’t convinced that was what made Malfoy nervous.
She was always so bloody cheerful, as if losing her magic had taken with it all her stress and worry. But then again, she’d been able to quit the Ministry fully without regret, work on her children’s novels full time. Harry was grateful he could still co-teach with Dudley, though Dudley now took the lead on the magical side.
“Not yours anymore,” Harry said. “In fact, it’s not even your lab. It’s just a manky, old classroom. Miguela’s got your lab, or have you forgotten?”
“The Old Ones! The Old Ones!” she cried, her voice so primal and utterly terrified that Harry nearly pissed himself.
It was New Years Eve when Draco woke up. He and Narcissa had kept a constant vigil over his bed in Bill’s old room the whole time. She was downstairs now, having tea with Mrs Weasley, and Harry was staring out the window, counting constellations, and remembering that one night when Draco’s touch had change the meaning of the number 88 for him.
The distinct, horrifying sound of a modem began from Lee’s computer. Harry stared at him. Was he trying to use dial-up?
“Fake news reporting is regarded as slightly more uncultured in the Muggle world than here. They aren’t keen to publish something that turns out to not be true and risk looking like the
“If I’d failed, I would’ve landed on the Hufflepuff. It would’ve been fine. But I didn’t fail, and Slytherin won the game. It was a
He opens the file and quickly reads the report, familiar enough with Draco’s handwriting and shorthand that he’s able to clear the first twenty pages in under ten minutes. Then he gets up and rifles through all of Draco’s reports from September until he finds the one that looks like it could be the one Draco had referenced. He reads that one, feeling his stomach tighten with each new revelation on their situation with a group in Turkey. Someone comes in, the door creaking as they swing it open, and Harry slams the file shut and slides it into the desk drawer. He puts on a bored face as Fievel rounds the corner.
Harry shrugged, suddenly uncomfortable. “Yeah, of course. I may not’ve yelled it from the head table, but I had to make a decision when choosing wank mags, didn’t I?”
One of the fifth year Hufflepuffs discreetly rolled his eyes at Harry and then took a rhubarb yoghurt with a side of turkey bacon for himself. Harry sighed and grabbed four pieces of turkey bacon and a ham-and-spinach quiche. Then after reflection, took a peanut butter and jam yoghurt as well.
The sacrifice was different for every blood ritual, but the price was always an objectively proportional trade. To protect an entire nation’s coastline from losing its property, Harry would have to be unprotected and vulnerable for four times the length of time it had taken to establish the protection. He would be without control of his magic and without strength of his body for thirty-six hours.
Petunia had been fine, Harry thought, since Vernon’s cardiac arrest and subsequent death some years ago, but he imagined she must be pretty lonely. She’d sold the house in Little Whinging and bought a lovely little thing in Solihull with the life insurance payout. She’d never liked southerners, she told him over dinner the one and only time she invited him.
He laughed humourlessly. “Of course.” He turned around. “Draco, go out. I’ll get you when it’s over.”
“And besides, you lot are just as bad as I am,” Draco added. “Potter’s the only one left who’s yet to succumb to sarcastic witticisms, and that’s only because he probably doesn’t know how. Even Lovegood says things that make me wonder how long she’s been mocking every last one of us.”
‘I didn’t mean to be rude professor but I was mildly curious. I wanted to be a healer when I grow up’, he grinned widely as he added the piece of information which is a lie obviously, he wouldn’t want to be a healer, a job to tend someone is not his cup of tea.
She’s getting sick with having long hair now and added to the wildness of the hair. She’s not good at maintaining her untamed hair, it’s better if she just could it short.
“The Malfoy - their first born child is always a male but what a frightening news he got when the private Healer who helped Mother to give birth announced that it was a girl instead. I heard - Mother and Father always fought about it.”
‘Stop stop, if someone finds out, we would all get in trouble,’ said Granger as she stepped forward.
The twin on Draco’s arms suddenly cry, so Draco pushed his labor gown open and groped his breast, moving slowly to his son’s tiny mouth, his fragile moved around trying to find his mama’s milk and when he found it, he quickly latched onto Draco’s nipples, draining the milk into his mouth.
They were quiet for a while. But then Mother looked at him and spoke, “Why can’t just for once you listen to him.”
“What in Mother’s bloody right mind is she thinking, buying supplies in early August, it’s so freaking hot out here, I think I might have sunburn,” Draco walks beside Cassie, he complains silently because he doesn't want Mother to hear.
Quirrell open his mouth to speak up but Draco was not finish, ‘ But the horror looked on your face mentioning the troll to Professor Dumbledore several minutes ago didn’t quite made the trick because why can a first year could tackle a troll but not a DADA teacher?’
Draco who was confused as to why the grown up was speechless, he held his father’s hand with his little fingers. He was bumbling and suddenly, his first word came out of his tiny pink lips, “Da-da”, he called for his fathers attention and tilted his head to make a confused look.
‘Five points to Ravenclaw’, said Slughorn as he lays the Amortentia on his table. He then continues, ‘What did you smell if you don’t mind telling the class?’
He was confused, of course the hat should put him in Slytherin because he was born into a Slytherin family.
“Daddy -,” shouted Draco in pain but pleasure. Hands pulling Harry by his thigh to fall on top of him. He wanted to be close to his Daddy, through everything.
‘Quite a pussy aren’t you, Draco?’, dared Pansy as she crossed her arms together and quirked one eyebrow up.
Hermione’s face turned confused from her statement, she stopped whatever she was doing and looked into her eyes. Trying very hard to tell her something that she’s oblivious to.
He took both of the things and stormed towards the dining room where he knew there would only be Mother and Cassie.
Harry could feel Draco’s legs trembling with cold so without asking, he took another spare blanket he had prepared and covered Draco’s milky legs.
“Now, Mother, can we go home and because my skin is getting redder,” murmured Draco to her mother so that only she could hear him complain.
“No, your daddy had a lot of things to do last night. Let’s give him some time, okay? In the meantime, you want to go for a morning run with your dear mummy?”
He rolled his eyes at Harry’s words and then lost to the lust. Harry knew his body too well, he knew what to do and he knew what Draco liked.
“Jamie thought that Mama-,” his words were cut off when they heard a shouts from Mrs Weasley, notifying Draco that Adrien was crying and wanted his fill, followed by his twin brother, Scorpius.
Narcissa was speechless for a moment but she gathered her thoughts and carefully asked him, “And where are you going and why can’t you let Remus take care of him?”
‘Well, first of all I know if I used you for the trend, it will blow up because you have a body of a china doll, it’s delicate and it makes guys swoon and girls jealous over you. Second of all, a lot of guys on the app want you again in my account since you don’t have one. Third of all, showing off your skin with less clothes will make mans go savage over you. Is the reason enough or I have to add more ?’ asked Pansy as she tucked away her phone into her pocket.
He wanted to continue with the sex but he knows Draco is sleepy and tired. Besides it’s only midnight, they still have a lot of time until morning comes.
‘I-’, but was cut off from the sound of teacher’s footsteps barging in the room. Oh no he knows they all are going to be in trouble just by the furious look on Professor McGonagall with Severus and Quirrell behind her.
They were now fighting about duelling, whether or not they should be dueling or just get out of the empty classroom. Until Blaise shushed them all and held out his finger to his mouth.
And at the same time, Draco was gathering information and reading on how to cast the Disillusion Charm. He have to know the basic knowledge first before he tried to cast on a small object for practice, truth to be told, he failed miserably on the concept of the charm but he’s not giving up.
“Fuck-baby. I need to stretch you open for my cock, ready for me”, said Harry as he moved his fingers furiously inside of him, Draco brought his hand to Harry’s thick and long cock, massaging the crown with his thumb, precum leaking out of it.
“Such a happy kid your son is,” said Draco as he walked up to them, one hand supporting his belly while his other hand grabbing Harry’s free hand and together they walked to the shop.
“Maybe my Potter’s sperm is so powerful that both of our sons look like me,” he chuckled softly in the quiet room. Draco agreed to what he said until he recalled that Harry said ‘both of their sons’ and not ‘all of their sons’.
When she finally knocks the door, she gets a demand reply from the inside, the high authority type of voice, it was Lucius who answered. Before she opens the door, Iris slides her hand around her waist, deeply kissing her.
He sighed and gave in to her demand, “Fine but are you alright?” She gave him a half smile that couldn’t quite reach her eyes, gave him an apologetic but thankful nod, walking away seconds later.
He handed the Potion book for Potter as they were having a conversation,Potter read it for him while he could brew the Amortentia instead. Potter took the book without question.
They make small talk on the way to the salon with just two of them. It was awkward at first because they haven’t been talking for a while, a quarter of it is her fault. When they arrive at the hair salon, the hairdresser steers them to empty chairs while asking them about what they want to do with their hair.
‘I’m warning you, Malfoy -one more word-’, he was cut off when Granger pointed out to Potter, he was gone into a dive, a spectacular dive might Draco add. He himself was surprised at Potter’s talent, not that he was going to admit to anyone.
Dumbledore gave a speech after all of the first year was sorted into their respective houses. He announced that the third-floor corridor was one of the ways to die if you want to die at a young age, not in the same sentence that he told the students, of course. He looked over the Gryffindor table and saw that Potter whispered something in Weasley’s face, probably about the third-floor corridor and saw a light of mischief gleaming in their eyes.
He moved his arms closer to Draco and gave him a view of his third son’s face, “Maybe you should take a look for yourself,” said Harry as he showed him their third newborn.
He seized the parcel from Potter’s grip and felt it. ‘ That’s a broomstick’, said Draco as he tossed it back to Potter but Weasley replied it for him.
“One more, dragon. I know you can do it, if you can give me three sons, you can definitely push the placenta out of you, I love you Draco, love you so much,” murmured in a low voice, he peeked his eyes open and looked at his husband and inclined.
Before Draco gets to pocket it so he could give it back to Longbottom, Potter speaks up. ‘Give that here, Malfoy,’ said Potter quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Draco who has the brilliant idea says hastily, ‘It’s none of your business, Potter. I’m just going to give it back to Longbottom.’
He gave back the helmet to Harry and Harry rested it on the seat while he climbed down too. He doesn’t know why.
“So I heard that you are trying to get your first kiss this year?”, asked Draco as he looked behind Blaise, at Potter and the Weasley’s. His leaned his body, his elbows are laid on top of the counter as he was talking to Blaise while Pansy are helping Cassie with whatever she needs.
For a week, no red robes are on sight, only blue, green and yellow. They have to endure this type of torture for a week and the best part is, there was no points given to the Gryffindor for a week since the points will be given to the house colour they wore.
‘Who is it from?’, asked Draco as they were walking to the 8th year table. Draco noticed that they got a look from the lower year looking at their intertwined hand, he looked at Harry and saw that he was not bothered by the staring.
He was in his college library, thick books scattered around him on the table, his stomach had been churning for the past two hours for skipping breakfast and lunch. He only took a small break to eat a piece of bread and banana.
At night, they would meet secretly at the tower. There’s no need for a conversation because they are comfortable with just each other’s present.
“No Mrs Malfoy, I respect you and I am grateful that you lied to Voldemort,” she got a protest noise from Lucius but she continued, “because you are a mother who is trying to save their child, who is trying to protect their family. My mother did the same for me. I know I’m not a mom so I don’t know what you are feeling right now but trust me, Celestia is in good hands, I will always treat her very well and she would do the same for me too.”
The next morning after he was caught, McGonagall delivered a note to him at his breakfast table telling him that he was having a detention tonight at eleven o’clock and told him to wait for Filch in the Great Hall.
“You shouldn’t have bite me until leaving hickey, you know my skin is sensitive and it’s going to bruise,” complained as he looked into the mirror, seeing the fresh new bruises that are going to form next morning. Harry came to his side and slid his arm around his waist, leaned down and kissed his temple.
Harry stopped for a second and took a deep breath before continuing with the encouraging look from Draco.
“Like I give a damn about their opinion, I just care about you and only you and if they really are my fans, they would be happy for me.” convinced Harry while stroking Draco’s white blonde hair.
“Let me carry him, you are pregnant, Draco. Don’t put too much pressure on your body.”, said Harry as he bend down to pick his exhausted son, walking to his room with Draco trailing behind him, walking slowly.
Harry’s huge palm spanked his arse brought him back out of the memory. Draco looked into Harry’s emerald eyes, the eyes that seem to always caught his attention since the first time he laid his eyes on it.
“Okay then. Let me call my driver to let him know,” he called his driver to inform him while Harry walked a little bit down the street, where he parked to start his motorbike, followed by Draco closely behind him.
Draco sits far back against the window with Blaise besides him and Pansy in front of him. Since young, Draco was always close to both of them besides Cassie whenever they visited the manor for special events.
His eyes quickly went back up to meet his emerald eyes, “Harry- he looks just exactly like you and Jamie.”
“You don’t have to flatten me to get into my pants, you know, in case you forgot, we are already married.”, chuckled Draco with his eyes rolling to the back of his head. The fingers inside him jabbed his prostate that make him moaned louder but he quickly clamped his mouth.
“Can I see our sons, please?”, asked Draco, peeking his head up and looking towards the cribs, Harry moved towards the cribs and carried their sons in each arm. Draco held out his hand and Harry put one of the twins down to his arms, telling him that this is their first born twin, Draco pushed the blanket off his face that wrapped around his son's fragile body, he looked down at his son on his arms and gasped softly.
He swears that whoever petrified him, he was going to hunt their body down but when he looked out of the corner of his eyes, the only person who was holding his wand out was Cassie so he was not going to hunt her body down.
Draco’s mouth are moving as he reciprocate the action of the lips against his, Draco slowly opened his eyes, his vision are blurry so he had to blink a few times. When his eyes is on focus, a pair of emerald green eyes are looking at him intently.
She detached herself slowly from Harry who sleeps like there was no tomorrow, a mumbling protest from his boyfriend as she walks to the bathroom to clean herself.
“I mean- have you look at him? He has grow quite a few inches for a twelve year old, while you are still short, you are even shorter than Cassie,”
The spell was hard to cast but he was grateful for the time he spent at the library because it was worth it. He’s fascination and curiosity with everything had won him over.
‘It’s not any old broomstick,’ he said with a proud look on his face. ‘It’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?’ He grinned at Potter. ‘Comets looks flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.’
A tiny part of him wanted Potter to get in trouble, well a big part of him actually but he do want to roam the castle instead of trailing for Potter and friends, get them in trouble.
Potter taken a step further and that when Draco realized that he was a reckless Gryffindor because if he had a brain, he would stop dead in his track but no - Potter got to be the saviour and filled his curiosity.
When Blaise realized it was Draco, he wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders and pointed at the Gryffindors table with his other hand.
When he walked inside the room, Draco was already aware that his husband was not in bed with him so when he walked in with their son in his arms, he was confused but didn’t ask for explanation as his son jumped on him once Harry put him down on the bed.
It was their little secret until Draco will reach the age of adulthood. Then he would tell the world that this boy held his heart in his palm.
‘Hello Goldstein’, said Draco with no enthusiasms in his voice. Goldstein was focusing his eyes on his face. ‘Uhm Malfoy, there some sauce on the corner of your mouth’, said Goldstein as he brought his hand to his face, pointed at the corner of his mouth.
She knew the blonde head too well. It was her former rival turned crush. Celestial Malfoy is the woman who makes her realize she is not as straight as she thinks she is.
Once he was done, he gave the phone back, stepped back a few steps to watch him go after scanning his keycard for the lift to work and a simple hesitation kiss on the older man’s cheek, he has to stand by the tip of his toes to give him the kiss and it was worth it because he felt his lips tingling afterwards.
Draco nodded again and Father walked off to Cassie to give her advice, maybe the same one. When he thought of it, he rolled his eyes because he knew that Cassie would listen to Father since Father doted on her more.
He looked at her with disgust and turned his head towards Harry, he then explained to Harry, “They are the Malfoy’s, their family are the followers of You-Know-Who, they were loyal to him.”
‘No, ask someone else or better ask Blaise, he would do it because he loves attention’, he said looking up from Pansy’s phone and turned his attention back to his food.
He unbuckled the seat belt and carried Jamie out of the car while Draco’s slowly moving his feet out touching the even concrete ground. Harry put Jamie down and holds his tiny hand with his, “Yayy- yay”, chanted Jamie excited looking around with big grin on his face.
While they were eating, Draco confessed he kind of had a tiny crush on Harry when they were in secondary school just because he was his senior and he was the captain on the school football team. Harry never noticed him anyways so he just forgot about his crush on him.
“Fuck- baby.. “, grumbled Harry under his breathe as his hips meets his thrust. The only sound that could be heard echo through the room is their moaning and the sound of skin slapping against skin.
When he arrived at his room. He search for his phone since he never bring his phone with near except going to Muggle Studies. He actually forgot where he put his phone at so he crouch down to search under his bed, on top of his drawer but find nothing.
While waiting, his finger scrolling through Instagram, he checked that there’s some account request to follow him. Usually he would deny or just ignore it but when he checked the user, it was Harry fucking Potter.
“I hate it too,” cupping his mouth to his son’s ear and whispered it playfully so Draco couldn’t hear their conversation and Draco was busy trying to pick the most freshest on display. He heard them snickered and looked up from his concentration, “What are you laughing at?” asked Draco curiously, eyes searching for any mischief.
Weasley was about to protest when Draco raised his hand as if to stop him from speaking and when he heard no word come out from his mouth, he continues.
He was with Crabbe and Goyle, since they decided to follow him today and not Cassie, when he saw Potter holding the large parcel with Weasley followed by so he decided to mess around or rather, bothering them.
“What has Dahlia been up to?” asked Draco about his favourite family member of Harry’s. He and Dahlia get on quite well when Draco and Harry started dating, she's a part time youtuber who would post videos in her free time.
Draco’s eyes scan through the dark forest they just got out from, the rustling of the tree giving him goosebumps, the unfamiliar scent giving him the feeling of threat. Regulus was barking behind him, trying to help Draco to fence off the stranger.
“Scorpius - Scorpius Hyperion Potter,” announced Harry as he hiccuped with fat tears rolling down his face. Seconds later, Scorpius cries his eyes out, and Harry hands him to him and takes Adrian in his arms as he is breastfed from him.
Two hours later, as quickly as they were wasting their time together without them realising, Draco led Regulus to a river for a drink.
At this point he even think why has he agreed with his mother to continue his study and he felt annoyed to Professor McGonagall that she made Muggle Studies a mandatory subject, he was annoyed at Professor Chillburg, his Muggle Studies’s professor on giving them a bloody mobile phone but most importantly, he felt annoyed and irritated towards whoever created the damn application in the first place that he could set the Forbidden Forest on fire.
“Sometimes, we don’t choose who our family is, family is not determine by blood but by heart , but because of my one wrong move, we were betrayed by a family who we thought was loyal and it was all my fault, I gave them the idea to change the Secret Keeper and now I'm having my revenge,” Sirius Black answered seriously, although he was never a serious person growing up.
To say that Draco was late for his part-time job (well basically he would call it his quarter time job since he can choose what time he felt like working) is acceptable and understandable since it was her mother’s restaurant he was working at.
‘Harryy-’, he moaned Potter’s name even though Potter’s mouth was on his. Potter then broke off the kiss to look at him, ‘Yes baby, what do you want? I’m right here baby’, said Potter as he kiss his forehead and down to this face until he came to his mouth again.
They were told that the boat could only hold four people, so Pansy, Blaise and him rode the same boat with an additional boy who they didn’t recognize.
They are 5 years apart so right now Harry is 28 years old who is a famous football player like his dad while Draco is only 23 years old.
‘Okay I’ll prove it to you that I can take you on any time on my own’, said Draco. ‘Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only - no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, Potter? I suppose.’
“I’m sorry for your pain and I wish I could understand it better but if you open the door, I will do everything to make you feel better.”
Harry plunged his tongue inside Draco’s, fighting with his tongue for dominance but in the end, Draco gave in because he knows he’s a slut for his Daddy and only his.
Draco folded his arms together and told him that he left a lot of hickey on him and Harry had this smug look on his face that he wish he could punch it without ruining the beautiful face.
One night in the middle of December, Draco was strolling through the Hogwarts corridor, he had a lot in his mind to think of, therefore he doesn’t heard Peeves came roaming to him.
As he close his eyes and resting his body beside Dobby, Draco asked Dobby one question he’d never did before because he was afraid of the answer but not anymore.
All thoughts flew out of his mind when he saw Cassie was moving far behind, where no one could see them if they were at the counter. This is a perfect opportunity so he took one of the skull carefully from the shelf as he held his breath.
They looked into each other’s eyes and moments later, their lips connected as Harry bent his head down since he was still taller than him although both of them were sitting.
“Draco,” Mother spoke calmly, Draco who doesn't have the time for this waits impatiently for words to come out of her mouth.
He stood beside the leg of the bed and waited patiently for Madam Pomfrey to walk away, she was watching them curiously but didn’t comment on it.
But happiness can never last forever. On a stormy night a month after Draco’s first birthday, Sirius was hit with bad news that Amelia had died in the hand of two Death Eaters seeking information on the Potters. He and Draco were having father and son bonding time while Amelia was out. She was outnumbered and died on the spot. Before she died, they tortured her with the Cruciatus Curse before using the Killing Curse.
Cassie saw the trouble on his face and seized the skull out of his hand and hid it behind her back with one hand, composed themselves as they stood side by side, so father couldn’t assume anything.
When the situation has calmed down, their pack is stronger and protected, forming allies from every pack they can. He won’t forget the look Harry gave him when Draco told Harry that he was ready to have children of their own.
Writing the caption for his post, as he is attaching more various posts of sleeping Draco on his page.
With him, over six month heavily pregnant with two Potter’s spawn ; yes, two! He was heavily pregnant with twins this time and he was going to have such a hard time if his twin sons are going to behave like his big brother, Jamie in the future.
Harry told him that his sister, Dahlia- who is two years younger than Harry, helped him pick the ring. Well, he knows how to catch people’s hearts. Draco hasn't visited the Potter’s for two weeks now, he’d been busy with his university and working part time as a waiter for his Mother’s restaurant.
‘How do you know I want it?’, asked Draco as he examining his new book, finding the page about Disillusionment Charm and quickly read it through without absorbing the information.
Pansy and Blaise were confused but they didn’t question him because McGonagall's voice was calling out to him. ‘I’m not going to kill Mr Malfoy and stop being dramatic, now come before I drag you by your ears’
He guided his hand to Draco’s cheek to his dark circles, tenderly stroking the puffy blackish eye bags.
He then turned to Potter and said,”You soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, I can help you there,” he then extends his hand for Potter to shake it.
She blurted out the first thing in her mind to not further out her embarrassment at getting caught admiring Celestial's face.
“About Blaise? He could do whatever he wants and whoever he wants but leave my sister out of it, she won’t be getting any kiss until she at least reach the age of fifteen or even better twenty.”, answered Draco honestly.
Pansy went to get her phone in thrilled that she started clapping her hand after she was satisfied with the end result. The crowd all clapped their hands for their performances.
“Just go get Hagrid”, said Potter as he screamed louder. He was so against that idea, what if Potter died, will he be the caused?
The Parkinson family was invited, same goes to Blaise and his mother, his mother just got married for the fourth time while Blaise was at Hogwarts. He doesn't even know how the woman did it but it was impressive.
Harry then trailed his hands down to Draco’s arse, peeling the arse cheeks apart and shoved two fingers in, maneuvered his fingers around his tight arsehole.
Draco was curious, he wanted to know what did Potter smell from the Amortentia, he got a flushed cheeked Potter instead of the answer. Potter throw the question back to him, he sniffed the air around him that was covered with the smell of the potion and he answered him truthfully.
Well at least father didn’t disowned him, he was just disappointed and disagreed with his lifestyle.
He then walks back to the living room, looks at his surroundings, walls full of photographs. Of his family and his friends. He went inside his least favourite room, where it held the family tapestry.
They have been going from one compartment to another, but most of the compartments are full of people.
“Lucius,” said Mr Weasley, nodding coldly. Draco was looking over at Cassie for help in any way that she could, he mouthed ‘help me’ and regrets his decision to torment Potter, maybe for once if he listen to Cassie, he won’t be in this situation.
And how does he know all those types of dresses? It’s because he’s trying to be a fashion designer. A successful and well- known fashion designer without using his last name.
Before he walked out of the door, - yes he said walk because Malfoy does not run nor scramble, he clasped on a bra and he realised that Harry already changed their babies into a suitable night clothes - onesie while they were still asleep like a log.
“She’s a lady, a lady shouldn’t play a gentlemen’s game, it’s improper. I let Cassiopeia learned how to play quidditch, that does not mean I will let her join the team. You will join the Slytherin quidditch team this year, end of discussion.”
Harry’s arm being his pillow and him buried his head on the crook of Harry’s neck, kissing the soft skin tenderly.
They apparate him and Cassie back to the manor, Draco rushed to his room, missing the warm feeling of his bed, he quickly jumped and his whole body landed on the soft material of blanket.
“I do have a record of the Potter arms,” came Coddler’s voice from just outside the room. They stepped quickly apart just as he entered. “I apologise for the delay, I wanted to be certain I still had the template, and I do.” He held up a sheet of parchment with a crest, verdant, with a golden stag over two crossed wands.
“Why don’t you just write the book? Twenty thousand galleons is a lot of dosh. You could buy a flat, travel, whatever.”
He waits until she leaves and then points his wand into the desk drawer, shrinking the file. He slips it into his pocket and then slips out of the Embassy. He does go home, but only to get his invisibility cloak. He doesn’t care if Draco wants to see him. He’s
Harry was pouring his second cup of brewed life when their final travelling companion strode in. Malfoy was impeccably dressed in a set of European-style robes: black shirt, fitted black wool trousers, and an indigo jacquard short-robe reminiscent of a military frock coat. Harry preferred that style himself when he was forced into robes (which was rare), as it allowed for more movement at the legs and arms, but he’d not seen Malfoy in full robes since his arrival. And now he felt a bit annoyed that someone like Malfoy could find it in himself to move beyond standard British conservatism enough to wear modern robes.
Hermione beamed at him. “This will be good for us,” she said, nodding. “A good distraction from… from all the other
Harry grinned despite himself as he dumped tea into the cups. “Yes, Kreacher, my house-elf, had this kitchen very well organised, but he... died a few months back. So I’ve had to learn how to be an adult again.”
Around three, Fievel comes in and it occurs to Harry that this is the first he’s seen of her all day. She walks by without acknowledging him, her hair a mess and her face harassed. She’s got the file in her hand.
Harry thought about that. “I really miss the convenience of telephones,” he said. “Being able to walk around with them instead of kneeling the whole time.”
Closing his eyes, Harry concentrated, and forced himself to change. It was easier this time, quicker. His arms turned to wings and he pumped them forcefully, taking off for the trees even as his feet were growing talons.
Harry frowns, waits for something (anything) from Malfoy, but Malfoy’s blank expression doesn’t change. With a completely silent sigh, Harry goes.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. He went dizzy with fear before he even realised how big the danger was.
. So he flapped his wings and pulled, with his claws still digging into Draco’s barely-there flesh. Draco resisted at first, but Harry was a collector of the dead, and he’d be damned if Draco sodding Malfoy escaped him. He cawed furiously, and Draco scrunched his nose, but did stumble along a few steps when Harry tried to take off again with him still attached.
Well Draco didn’t like that at all. But he didn’t have much say in it. It was too late for second thoughts now.
She frowned. “I don’t get what they’re so upset about. So the Queen wouldn’t go back into hiding, so what? It apparently isn’t even necessary. Pansy and I’ve been following the
“Harry Potter,” he said, grinning. Oh, he couldn’t wait to text Ron about this. He was going to have to get a picture of the two of them together to send to him, too.
Maybe it was his imagination, but he would’ve sworn that Draco smiled, for the briefest of seconds. “All right, Potter. What did you have in mind for the project?”
Herbert Kurzschluss rubbed his hands together like one of Hermione’s volunteer mice, smiling a bit at the over one hundred witches and wizards gathered again for this ridiculous task force.
She narrowed her eyes, and Draco leaned back, arms crossed over his chest, smirking. His legs stretched out beneath the table and tangled with Harry’s.
Immediately, he felt himself changing. His skin tingled all over. His hair grew, his nose straightened, his teeth changed, his shoulders narrowed, and his waist, too, and then—
Malfoy takes the sunglasses off, to both Harry’s relief and distress, and gives him a pointed look. “What’s wrong?” he says again.
But then Draco replaced it with his own free hand, curling his fingers loosely around Harry’s shaft and barely wanking him. Every nerve in Harry’s body was soaked with sensation, he was trembling with the need to come. He wrapped his hand back around Draco’s neck and pulled him in for a kiss, trying to tell Draco everything he couldn't say under water—that he was close, that he needed desperately to come right this minute, that he still loved him and would forever.
Grudgingly, Draco agrees that they can each name their own heir. They look just alike—both with blonde hair and indeterminate eye colour—so there’s no point in picking based on familial resemblance. Draco claims the one that came out first, but he can’t stop staring at either of them. Neither can Harry, really.
Severus was unimpressed. “Once one has lived through a decade of Dumbledore and the Dark Lord’s service, very little terrifies.”
“You have to let me lean in,” Harry advises him. “I’ll get better.” He nips at Draco’s bottom lip and says, “I’m surprised your mother is so copacetic with our relationship.”
“No, really,” Harry said. “I had trouble with visualisation, too, until I realised what I was doing wrong. If you help me catch up on Potions, I’ll show you how to transform.”
Harry shrugged, and the movement caused his elbow to brush against Draco’s. He could think of a thousand things. “The Killing Curse.” Draco tensed. “Fire. Decay. Disease.”
Mrs Black slid into the painting of the Washington Monument that Harry’d purchased on one of their recent dates from a street artist and cleared her throat.
“This is really strange,” said Harry. He’d not even noticed the table filling up around him so quickly. And normally, he’d be supremely weirded out by people who weren’t Ron or Hermione getting so close to him.
More vigorous nodding. Draco frowned at them for good measure, then, when he was satisfied they were absolutely taking this seriously, he spelled the instructions onto the board.
“I think we don’t want to have every Muggle government in the world teamed up against us, and we’re incredibly stupid to destroy a chance to work with those governments and their magical liaisons to keep the existence of magic under wraps.”
Snape turned to him, lifted an eyebrow. “And I need a body that feels inebriation, but life—and death—remain unfair, a lesson I regret I never managed to instil in you.”
Considerably less dignified, Harry stumbled out after him – after taking a moment to adjust himself. The thought of his face in Draco’s arse had been more appealing than he would’ve liked. Crushes were one thing – a thing Harry could deal with. But it had to stay there, a crush. This one still wasn't cooperating.
He was happy for Ron, happy he would be first of the three of them to be an Auror. The early start would give him a chance to make friends and prove himself without being in Harry’s shadow, which was all to the good in Harry’s opinion. Let Ron have his gushing. It was just that…he’d never been apart from Ron for so long. And Ron was doing well in the program. Really well. Without Harry. Without Hermione, even.
“Good enough,” Harry decided. He finished off his tea. “Fancy another round upstairs before we turn in? On a bed this time?”
Draco shared a glance with Potter. Neither of them agreed with that—but...surely there was another way?
Draco threw the paper forcefully onto the desktop and glared around the room, as if daring anyone to say something he wouldn’t like. “Now I won’t force you all to sit through the rest of their subpar paper, but I will say that I of course took a look at their finance and national politics sections, and they have quite enough of their own problems to worry about, and yet here they are, sticking their poorly-bred noses into our business! Let them deal with vanishing magic in
.” He turned abruptly, stared wide-eyed at his oil-painted Master. “Change. You’ve had me studying concepts of change.”
She shook her head. “I could not let my people die. We hid in the caves, and my counsel and I created a spell—one that would let us truly escape. But as with any magic in the fourth dimension, escape could only be had for a time. We would have to return eventually, and the reprieve would not come for free. The spell we created took Atlantis out of time and space entirely; for nearly twelve thousand years, we were frozen on another plane all alone, our lives suspended, while our creators saw only the tsunamis coming to drown our land beneath the sea.
They went to dinner and to see a few local wizarding bands play at seedy pubs, and at weekends, they’d go flying low over London with only Disillusionments over them, in another of Draco’s tiny rebellions.
“Christ and Merlin,” came an annoyed voice above them. “Listening to you two is the true sacrifice in this whole thing. Give up my magic, sure, but for fuck’s sake, must I really listen to you putting your dicks down one another’s throats the whole time?”
“Draco,” he said. “We were supposed to have something. It was supposed to happen. It can still happen. I think of no one but you. For four years, you’ve been the only person I could think about. I want to try again. I want to do it right.”
Ron shrugs. Hermione comes into the living room with a tray full of safe-to-eat foodstuffs and a pot of tea, looking as bright-eyed and bushy-haired as she ever does.
They set Teddy up at the worktable in their office, where he immediately started in on his homework. Harry and Draco shared a look of dismay.
know—but life still existed without that hand, and so, therefore, must he. But if he chose to avoid Slug Clubs in the meantime, well, that was his perogative.
Harry kicked hard, swimming the distance between them. He grabbed Draco’s shoulders and carefully pulled him in, angling his pointy nose and chin just so. Harry’s Bubblehead Charm parted for Draco to enter and reformed around them without a leak. Just like soapy dishes in the sink.
After some time, the light and the laughter died down, and everyone’s smiles turned inward, towards contemplation. They closed the circle all together, with even Harry and the other uninitiated Hufflepuffs getting to be part of it. The vivid light from before had softened into a warm glow around their joined hands. He’d never felt closer to so many people before in his life.
“Erm,” said Harry. When nothing came to mind, except the obvious for Hermione, it occurred to Harry that—he really didn’t know much about his dates at all. “I couldn’t even guess.”
“But please include some coffee,” Draco said. He was not willing to rough it until he was convicted and well behind the unforgiving stone walls of Azkaban.
Dawlish’s eyes narrow. He looks at Harry for a long time, long enough that Harry starts to wonder if something’s wrong. Finally, he opens his mouth. “I’m benching you, Potter. You’re on leave until you get your head sorted.”
“And you!” Pomfrey said, turning on the man now occupying the watercolour seascape behind Harry’s bed. He’d never seen the professor look quite so
of them. The newer ones were more likely to have the really nasty stuff in them, so that was where they would start – even though those were also the most likely to be noticed as missing.
Goyle shrugged. “Who cares?” he said around a mouthful of quiche. He was having an extended breakfast this morning. “If our magic’s working again, we can always hide if we have to.”
Harry looked up, seeking his house’s reaction. At Hufflepuff, only Draco had yet opened his paper. His eyes met Harry’s, and right then, Harry knew he saw the path they were on as clearly as Harry did.
Narcissa’s laugh tinkled through the room. “I didn’t realise until I’d weaved down to their knees. I’ll unravel it and start again, but your father found it such a laugh when he came in, I had to save it to show you.”
Draco came over and looked down. He stared at the litmus strips for a long time, then he pulled out a stool opposite Harry and sat. “You know, I developed a spell to give the exact pH of a liquid.”
Harry briefly considered the horror it would be to accidentally Polyjuice into a crocodile. But, well—Gryffindor. In answer, Harry uncapped Flask 1, and tipped it back.
Dennis beams at him. “Harry’s New Line of Mens’ Ready-to-Fuck Unveiled,” he says. “Get it? Like ready-to-wear, but fuck instead. That’s what I’m titling my article for
“He’s a missing person now,” Harry said. “You said you had a detective looking for him. He’ll be stopped immediately at airport security.”
Jones picked up the phone and dialled a few numbers. She smiled at them, holding a finger up while she waited. “Just a moment.”
He tossed the wand to the nightstand. It rolled off the side, clattering to the floor. Neither of them bothered to pick it up. They didn’t need it anymore. They just needed one another.
For some reason, that hit Harry hard. It struck his chest like a blow and settled into the flesh there. It gave him the confidence and the determination to return to work that afternoon with a letter of resignation for Dawlish. He didn’t see or speak to Draco while he was there.
If Luna were here, instead of West Wherever, she would’ve reminded him that he didn’t owe anyone his guilt and, even if he did, it didn’t help them. She would have told him to plant a garden instead, and pay it forward, and a bunch of other shit that would’ve helped his heart, even if it didn’t help the world.
“Potter beating you, is he?” Millicent said. “You’d really be in for a buggering if I were playing, too, wouldn’t you?”
“It’s so lovely to see gaps being bridged,” said Mr Weasley. He smiled beatifically at Millicent and Draco. Perhaps he’d got into the wine somewhat earlier. “Really captures the spirit of Christmas.”
“If you ever need anything, just to talk, or… you know, watch Manchester on telly with me, you can come over anytime. Anytime, Hermione.”
Harry completes the AIR (a total of sixty-two fucking pages) and sets it on the table beside his bed for Demelza to turn in to Dawlish. She seems to have been napping during the two hours it took him, but when the pages flop onto the table, her eyes crack open and stare at him darkly.
He came within seconds, and lay staring up at the white ceiling with his hand still loosely fisted around his cock, come drying on his stomach. He felt, vaguely, disappointed in himself. Not for wanking to Malfoy, per se, but for wanking to Malfoy
Harry summoned a vial from his bedside table and uncorked it over his hand. Oil poured out, coating his fingers, and he reached down to coat Draco’s prick with it. Merlin, he had no idea what he was doing, and he was terrified of fucking it all up.
Draco slides in and his breath rushes from his lungs, ghosting over Harry’s back. There’s pressure, a full feeling, but it’s not painful. He feels like this is how things are supposed to be and maybe that eliminates some of what pain there might’ve been. And he’s never been more turned on in his life.
He turned around again. Malfoy was focused on his buttery potion, the steam making his hair fall around his face. An alarm buzzed on his Hawthorn wand, and the potion turned a shimmery bronze. Malfoy looked up at him, the corner of his mouth pulled up in something that wasn’t quite a smirk.
There was a knock at the door. Draco sighed, shot Severus a glare, and stomped over to the door. He swung it open, already scowling, and then blinked when he realised who was on the other side.
They really didn’t, he realised. They wouldn’t allow themselves to fail. For anything important, Hufflepuff would always be there to solve the problem, to save the whole and the individual.
they govern, Malfoy,” Harry said, exasperated. “I stopped following politics eight or nine years ago.”
Dudley was quiet for a moment, only the sound of his elevated breathing to show he was still on the line.
“Yes,” Harry muttered. Next to him, Ron huffed. The other students quietly echoed Harry, their yesses falling soft and staggered like little raindrops against the dining tables.
“We need to destroy the impurity, and then reconjoin the quartz with the calcined ash. What destroys things?”
Hermione and Neville turned to him, mouths parted. And, too surprised by the veiled compliment to remember he didn’t do so well looking at Malfoy, Harry followed. Next to him, Zabini had his head leant back against the bricks, an expression of exasperation on his face. Harry could well understand that. He was waiting for the punch line himself. It didn’t come.
place Atlantis under that spell again. It was a desperate act that ruined the lives, lineages, and histories of many of my people. And as I said, the magic knows best; now is when Atlantis is needed.”
“Help whom?” Draco muttered, but he was ignored. Several of the reporters were peering at them curiously, trying to figure out how they had appeared.
“They went sprawling across the floor when the last of his magic came back,” said Ron. “It was pretty forceful.”
Draco held tight to the armrest as the aeroplane’s machines slowed down and they began a slow, gliding fall to the sea. His stomach flipped, and he was reminded of that time he’d tried a Wronski feint and thought his insides were going to fall straight through his gullet.
Astoria covered her mouth, stared at Draco with sparkling eyes. He shrugged, having no idea what he was supposed to say. She was the free-spirited art teacher, after all. He was fine being the conservative historian.
He’d died already, and it wasn’t so bad. Just boring. A lot like life would be if it never ended, he supposed. Same old train station, same old emptiness. He thought of the lost spirits in the woods that his crow-self watched, and hoped to Merlin that he was never like that, eternal and
Hermione’s sobs reached new levels. “Mill!” she wailed, half-laughing, half-crying. Her fingers curled into the fabric of the other woman’s robes and kneaded, catlike. “They wrote me a letter!”
Kaylen popped away, leaving Harry standing on a shivering-cold beach with only Malfoy’s mum for company. They strode towards the leypoint in silence, no one speaking. The wind was harsh now, and bitterly cold. October nights were not comfortable this far north.
Draco and Potter wasted no time going for seats—although Draco maintained a more dignified approach, carefully orchestrating it to look like chance that he’d made it to a good chair first.
“I…desire you. Still,” Harry finally said. “I’ve never wanted anyone before. I waited to see if it was just a crush, to see if it would fade. It hasn’t. I want you as much as I ever did. And I won’t delude myself this time into thinking that I’ll be able to stop…feeling. You were right. Not even I can do that bit. But—this is what I can do,” and here, he looked up, and stared hard until Draco was forced to meet his gaze.
Millicent immediately had everyone’s attention. She stood, bent down and heaved an invisible alien up, plopped it in the chair. Then she dismissed the Disillusionment.
But it was just Draco, leaning back against a disused pylon. The last point was at an airport in North Bend. Draco unfolded and came towards him.
Harry looked away, took a deep breath. “No. I mean, what if I let you inside my mind, and you watched from there?”
“Mine,” Harry’d said as he fell on top of him. He kissed down Draco’s jaw, growling when Draco laughed at him. Draco’s arms had come up to pull his body flush and Harry had melted into him and known that they’d always be like this. They argued and fought and argued again, but it always came back to this, to Harry falling in love with Draco every day, each time just as hard as the last, unable to help himself.
Draco’s eyes gleamed, something unidentifiable in them. “A total of two months, spread apart, and you’re
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know who to pick,” he admitted to them. His eyes caught Malfoy, looking down and away, even though Harry didn’t want to look at him. He didn’t want to be drawn to Malfoy or to think of him constantly. But he did anyway, and he
“Atlantis is not a member nation,” said the Queen. “We are a sovereign state with no affiliations whatsoever, and your federation did not exist when we hid.”
Padma smiled. “And you’ve met Theo Nott, my fiancé,” she said. He and Nott nodded, which caused Padma to smile even more. “Wonderful! So! I’m really excited about all of this. When Hermione told me she was starting a wedding planning business, I was all over it. I’d already started worrying about how Theo and I were going to plan all those damned Struggles with our caseloads, and the wedding on top of that! Shiva help me, I thought! And look, he did!”
Professor Sprout found them in the morning, just as the first rays of daylight were peeking over the horizon. She had a wheelbarrow of garden supplies and chocolate with her. Harry was Ennervated by Addolgar Rees, who was still covered in morning dew and snow when he spelled Harry awake.
He drank his beer to give his mouth something else to do besides talk, but when he set the glass down again, it seemed that it still wanted to have a go. “Look, Draco,” he said. “It was a one-off for you. I get it. It’s shitty for me, but I get it. I won’t spend the rest of my life pining after you, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
Draco ignored the catch in his voice. He said, “Shame Cadwallader fumbled that quaffle last night. Looks like I’m in the lead again.”
A moment later, a man and woman of similar colouring to the Queen, wearing white togas, entered the room from the outside-leading glass-paned door. The guards Conjured two elegant chairs for them, placed in a half-circle around the Queen. Then the guards stepped back to a respectable distance again.
They returned to DC feeling invigorated and energised. One part of the problem was on its way to being solved: getting the physical rubbish out of the water so the Mers and other creatures wouldn’t choke on it.
“Yes,” said Harry, peering closely at the web of wards he’d erected around his cauldron. He scooped up Severia and put her in the corner, behind another set of wards. She meowed loudly, in annoyance, but he figured if she had a problem with it, she shouldn’t be letting Peep into his rooms when he was away.
Draco huffed at the intrusion, closed the door and followed Potter back in. “The Muggles?” he asked.
It was Harry’s imagination that his voice sounded that panicked. There was no reason to panic, surely. Everything was pretty perfect in Harry’s life right now. How could anything bad be happening?
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Ernie Macmillan, Eloise Midgen, and Megan Jones – all Gryffindors, née Hufflepuff – look at one another at once, and their eyes said many things Harry couldn’t translate. Then all three of them looked to Neville, and he glanced at them and nodded once. He half-turned to Malfoy, then changed his mind and pulled the drawstring on his bag, slung it over his shoulder, and left the classroom. The Gryffindors filed out of the room. Ron scooped the last of his parchment into his book bag and let out a long sigh.
“Sorry, Sevsy,” Harry murmured to her, and she was fine again, rolling about on the floor and offering her tummy for his inspection. “There’s my girl.”
“Ginny and Luna have the boys,” Potter said. He gave Draco a keen look. “I went by to see Albus. You didn’t want to say—?”
He hears Draco huff out a tiny laugh and then the finger’s gone. He feels the blunt head of Draco’s prick pressing against him and he exhales shakily, relaxing into the heady feeling of them combining in such an intimate way. It feels like he’s waited eight years for this moment where Draco’s body completes his body.
“Good,” said Jones. “Public relations will come in handy with our situation, I’m sure. We have plenty of Magical Beings experts, but they all charge exorbitant consulting fees and Britain owes us for this shitshow, anyway.”
His other two cauldrons should have been simmering now, but the lead one wasn’t. He checked his wand timer. Twelve minutes, still no rumbling simmer. Beneath the cauldron, the flame looked fine. He touched the side of the cauldron, and it felt warm, too.
She gives him a haughty look and then smiles at Malfoy. “I’ll miss you, Malfoy. You’re an annoying, conceited dick, but you’re nice to look at. Much better than my partner, anyway.”
He took a moment to send a quick owl off to Dudley, reminding him to bring Harry’s favourite quill back for class tomorrow, and
It’s not his usual thing, but he’s been fully cocked for five hours and he’s afraid his bollocks might fall off if he doesn’t empty them. So he does—in great quantity, on his kitchen table, just inside the door to his flat.
Draco jumps out of the bed, taking the sheet with him and wrapping himself up tight. “You should go.”
Harry recoiled. “You want me to be a wedding planner?” he said, incredulously. “Are you trying to stereotype me?”
“I think being free is when you don’t force yourself not to do something because you’re afraid that doing it would put your heart at risk.”
Suddenly, Draco grabbed the front of his new cloak and jerked him forward. He pressed their lips together in a bruising kiss that Harry couldn’t help but melt into.
“I’ll take care of it,” Draco says without looking up more than necessary to quickly read the words. “Don’t worry about it. It’ll be handled and I won’t…I won’t tell them you stole the files. Unless you want credit? But no, you don’t,” he adds to himself. “You never do. I’ll take care of it,” he repeats firmly.
Lucius murmured something about getting out his collection of cameras and photo journalling his time at the Ministry, and Draco’s mother talked of her walks around the grounds, visiting their tenant farmers, the endless upkeep required for the Westbury White Horse, and her recent litter of pedigree Fancy Colour Dalmatians.
The Queen herself stood by one of the floor-to-ceiling windows, draped in a burgundy toga with golden torc, bangles, and laurel leaf-stamped belt. Her hair was tied back in a braid that fell to her hips. Four guards stood nearby, watching, unimpressed, as the foreigners entered.
They all turned to look at him. He crossed his arms, gingerly, and stared them down. Finally, Pomfrey exhaled in a rush of air, and removed her hands from her hips long enough to set his wrist. It snapped, literally, back into place, and Harry managed to withhold everything but his initial yelp of surprise, but
Madam Pomfrey moved down to his ankle and prodded about much more than was necessary, before she repaired the ligament and siphoned off the bruising. Harry bit his lip the whole time, but refused to let any of these people hear him make one noise of pain. He had his pride after all.
Harry had never in his life felt so ridiculous as he did the moment he yelled, “Goldfish-telephone!” at a firework, but his voice was drowned out by a cacophony of other very Muggle words and the resulting explosion was a sight to behold. The sky lit up with a rainbow of colours and sounds. The fireworks themselves were stopped by the walls of Sprout’s spells, but the light escaped and it was beautiful.
Harry stood, scooped his rucksack up in one hand, and walked around Draco. He forced whatever tiny Occlumency walls he could muster to come up and shield him enough to put one foot in front of the other without losing his mind.
There was a middle-aged man already in the cafe when they came in; his eyes swept up and down Harry’s female-looking body before doing the same to Millicent’s. Then he gave himself a little smile and turned back to his book and tea. Harry would’ve punched him if he weren’t trying to stay away from law enforcement.
Hermione exhaled heavily. “Yeah,” she said. “That sounds nice. I don’t think I can handle going into the office just yet anyway.”
She ran from the room, and Harry shared a look with Ron. They grinned. It was almost like old times. It was almost as good as sharing a joke with—
Eventually, the whiz-bangs tapered off. The sky echoed with their absence. It seemed to Harry that the Hufflepuffs released a collective breath, as if they were trying to fill the void themselves.
And that, inevitably kept leading them back to the same conclusion Draco had had yesterday: They couldn’t do this without Muggles and their technology. But he had no idea how to do it
He looked to Ron for support, and Ron shrugged. “I suppose. If you like having bollocks near your face and stuff. I don’t really think I would, though. I’m grossed out enough by my own after a day in Auror training, and I know where they’ve been, you know? Can you imagine what Loupe’s would be like after a three hour Quidditch game?”
He looked down, through the invisible dog on his lap to his naked chest beneath, where there was a huge, smeared streak of black, black blood. He swallowed.
“I’m sure,” Snape said, bored. Harry craned his neck to look up at the painting. Even upside down, he could see the arch look Snape was shooting Draco.
Harry rolled his eyes. “The kids are being so weird,” he said. “Can’t help but get one of those spine-shivery feelings that they’ve got some sort of sixth sense. Like earthworms coming out everywhere before an earthquake.”
“We still don’t know how to create that change, though,” said Draco. “And I don’t fancy the idea of you drinking Poison in order to find out.”
Whatever the reason, it’s getting late, and he should probably pack some things. Maybe lots of things. He doesn’t know how long he’ll be there. His travel visa allows for six months. Will it take six months to convince Malfoy he needs Harry like Harry needs him? Malfoy’s stubborn sometimes. Maybe he should pack up his whole house.
turn out all bad, after all. Millicent’s raised eyebrow across the table reminded him that it would not, of course, turn out
Harry can’t help smiling. Ron is amazing. For a moment, Malfoy had really thought he’d got him a huge basket of fruit.
“Won’t all the magic disperse?” asked Harry. “It could go anywhere. It might leave Britain altogether.”
“I suppose,” said Teddy. He gathered his things into a tidy little pile, shuffling to make sure his maths worksheet was on top. Harry supposed he could see the banker in him already. Remus would probably be delighted, he thought with a sigh.
“Not yet,” said Padma. “We need to get some chickens first. It’s auspicious that we marry on a day that rains,” she added, “so we have to divine it.”
Harry groaned, and flopped back against the bed. Whatever happened to holiday spirit and all that rot? “Dexter Loupe is fit as fuck,” he said, in his own defence.
Here in the Brussels Airport, even hidden behind the wards that separated magical from Muggle travel, Harry felt exposed. Snape could always be counted on to keep Harry rooted to reality. Even if that reality, frankly, sucked.
“Yeah.” Malfoy’s reply is punctuated by a hard thrust that sends a spark of oh-fuck-god-yes pleasure through Harry’s entire body. It’s never been so good like this. Never felt so right, so fucking
Kyle frowned. “That’s gonna be tough. The NoMajes over here don’t like being told what to do. Even when it would help them out.”
“How are you feeling?” Dennis asked him, camera only feet from Harry’s face. The glare from the light never really seemed to fade.
Unlike Dudley, Petunia had never made an effort to reconcile with Harry after the War ended and the Dursleys were released from their safe house. Neither had Vernon, of course, but a heart attack had taken him in 2000. Harry had gone to the funeral, stood in the very back, and said nothing to anyone except Dudley.
Harry eyed him narrowly. He was well-past being in the mood for this. “Back off, Draco. And put up a bloody shield charm.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Please, I would’ve Stunned Scorpius two hours ago. You do use the child-approved version, right?”
Harry grabbed his bar shampoo and scrubbed it into his hair, dragging it harder over his scalp than he really needed to. What was Chieftess Undine’s niece’s name? What games did she play? What watery books did she read? Did she want to be chieftess when she grew up?
Being one of the few early risers on staff, Harry was left alone at the breakfast table in the Great Hall, save for Flitwick, who was squinting at the morning
Potter grinned at him. “You allowed it. Plus, did you see how many sweets they got through last night? They’d
“Hermione?!” He huffed in exasperation. Of course. His humiliation just wouldn’t be complete without one of his besties here to chaperone. No doubt Ron set this all up, the fucking wanker.
Their voices were unnaturally quiet, as if the beings on the ship above could pick them out from ten-thousand or more feet away.
Harry made an effort to be engaged. This was his life after all. “Finishing school or getting all Trolls?”
Harry got his broom out and hung it above his bed, for something to remind him that this was where he slept now.
“Mrs Malfoy would’ve already known that,” said Harry. “She’s rather sharp.” Oh, how well he knew that by now.
He lounged back against the painted stone wall to wait. The yellow-white paint was chipping in places. There were names scratched into it in some places. Not a legacy Harry was keen to join. Around midnight, UK time, he clocked that no one was going to do anything about him until morning. He pulled the thin blanket loose from its hospital tucks and got in.
It didn’t work, as when Potter dropped his hands and looked at Draco, he could obviously see him. “Which hell am I in right now? Do you know? Did you study it in Greece?”
“I knew it would be bad,” Petunia said. “But knowing it and living it are two different things. Tea?”
Mrs Black, Slytherin as she had once been, noticed the wound immediately. Given the industrial strength Cheering Charm that had been applied to her canvas twelve years ago, she only prodded at it a bit.
Harry finished off his ale, staring down into the empty bottom of the glass like some whinging love song. “You read Ginny’s report in the paper, right? What if Queen Sostrate is right, and we need them for some reason?”
Harry’s eyes widened. “That’s right! They did! How did they have fire? I still can’t figure that out!”
Harry clicked the banner thirty times, trying to force it to open quicker, but his laptop model was a few years old and not as fast as the newer ones. Painfully slowly, his Mail application opened to Hermione’s email. Beyond hers, there were 3,412 unread ones from people asking him to wire them money. He always ignored those, amazed by the sheer gall some people had to ask strangers for large sums of money, but he got the same sort in his owl post, so he reckoned it was a universal problem.
Harry cleared his throat. “Er, what would you say this represents about yourself?” he asked, fearing the answer.
“Oh, shut the fuck up,” Draco said at the same time Weasley huffed and added, “Here we fucking go again.”
He would never know, and Hermione would think it gruesome that he still used the Forest to meditate, but she couldn’t understand how much he appreciated having it that night, when it had come time for him to walk it for real. That night, during the battle, it’d felt like he was only meditating, and calmness had settled over the explosive terror, and he’d been able to walk to his death, one foot in front of the other.
The reached the Three Broomsticks and kept going. To Harry’s surprise, they also passed the post office, the Quidditch supply shop, Madam Puddifoot’s, and Honeydukes. They were quickly approaching the Shrieking Shack, and soon they were past that, too. “Where are we going?” Harry asked again.
“Quite serious,” said Minerva, and Harry really should’ve taken note of the rolled ‘r’ in her tone, which would have indicated to any reasonable person that she was nearing the end of her rope, but Harry was quite adamant. He had enough Slytherins to deal with at meals and staff meetings. They weren’t terrible people, but they glared a lot and seemed to find everything amusing, even when they were just discussing the roster for the house Quidditch teams, and Harry didn’t want to be out-numbered.
“Any guesses on what your contenders will build?” Dennis asked, appearing out of nowhere in front of Harry. “What do you think is most important to the Seekers of your heart?”
“No one wants Diagon Alley to lose its ability to fit into wizarding space either. Can you imagine what would happen if it sprang out to its equivalent physical size? It would demolish the city of London. A lot of people would die, wizarding and Muggle.”
Jones slid her glasses up her nose to the top of her head and regarded them seriously. At this distance, Harry could clearly see it: she was exhausted.
“I like this dude,” Kyle said to Draco, hooking his thumb in Harry’s direction. “He goes with the flow. You’d do great here in the MUS, Harry. Way less stuffy than England.”
The cobbled pathway leading to the front door was crowded with the press and other gawkers, but Millicent got through with a stern glare while Harry led Malfoy around the crowd through the neighbour’s drive, taking care to step only on the pavers that lined the flower beds, so their footprints wouldn’t show.
Narcissa looks pained. She’s probably imagining all the semi-lethal Manticore kittens running around and pissing on ancient Malfoy rugs. “Draco tells me that he’s taking a sabbatical, to reassess.”
They read through the first two chapters before Ms Danger was snoring softly on his lap and he was nodding off himself. He glanced at the mantel. The portrait with the half-finished Scotties was still empty.
Harry looped his tether around a jutting rock to keep from floating away. He unhooked his collection kit from his waist and gently scooped a little planula of jellies into his jar. He screwed the lid on, sealed it with a spell, and stuffed it in his kit.
“Please what?” he whispered into Harry’s ear. He licked a trail around the rim and Harry shuddered, shoving his arse back on Malfoy’s cock like a cat in heat. “Please fuck you?”
,” Harry said, spinning around and grabbing at his hair with both hands. He paced over to the door and then back, too restless to stand still, to stand next to Malfoy. “I know,” he said again. “But I didn’t see it. Not until—not until I watched. It’s like a Pensieve, these magicboxes. Have you realised? It gives you distance, lets you see things you don’t want to let yourself see when you’re there. Things you’re afraid of seeing.”
When Hermione realised she’d have to Side-Along Harry along with four boxes of oysters, the frown deepened to Mariana Trench levels. She held her free hand out stiffly and he grabbed on.
They were near to nuclear war, which even Malfoy seemed to understand was bad. They were near to the Statute falling to shit. They were near to a fucking alien invasion. And Harry would take Voldemort over this any day of any week.
There was a shaky photograph, too-far zoomed in, of an island, with a huge, circular harbour, with concentric rings leading in.
Harry bites his lip, considers. After tonight, they can do whatever, but now, the first time, Harry wants to be
“Harry!” Hermione whispered as he was walking back from the written examination that evening. She tugged him into the girls’ loo, where, fortunately, Myrtle was nowhere to be seen. “It’s all up and down the castle that your Patronus is a dog now. I thought you were over Sirius by now. Are you not? If you’re not then—”
He knew he was stupid for thinking this, but: he really hoped Draco didn’t want to end this too soon. Maybe Harry was just a glutton for punishment.
Harry supposed it marked his transition to Real Hufflepuff if he was beginning to appreciate the finer points of dry humour, of which there was an abundance in his new House. Merlin, they were all
Draco shrugs. “We should probably think about it for a week or so. Baby Malfoy’s good for now.” He looks between the two of them and then shrugs. “Actually, we’ll probably get them confused before we even leave the hospital so we could just stick to One of Two Daughters for the both of them until we work out and identification method.”
But the best part was that his hair was shaved on the sides and long on top, stylishly coiffed to the side. He also had a full, dark blond beard and moustache. And he was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Harry desperately wanted to see Draco in the same, now.
works on Muggles,” the MACUSA rep said, rolling his eyes. “Just because it didn’t work on mice doesn’t mean it won’t work on Muggles, who are a completely different species. The spell is MFDA-approved, so it’s perfectly safe.”
It had been his fault, too. He’d allowed it. He’d jumped Draco at work on Bring Your Child to Work Day. He’d been the first to suggest Obliviation.
Harry can still see Draco’s face in front of him. The hallucinations linger now. In the early days of the curse, they were just flashes—so quick and gone that Harry’d wondered if he was losing his mind before they found the curse. He still doesn’t know who cast it, who sneaked past his defenses so cleverly, so quietly, so effectively. He can’t even pinpoint the exact day it hit him—that is the genius of this curse. After all, even Harry at the top of his Auror work didn’t need to use offensive spells and curses each day at work. There were weekends when all he did was light the kettle, and a quick flash of Mrs Weasley’s face as he
Harry’s not good at sitting around doing nothing, evidenced by the fact that only ten minutes after Demelza’s exit, he’s already trying to figure out how to wordlessly
Harry, too creeped out by potential caterpillars, did not sit down again. Instead, he wandered through the ruins, brushing his hands along the old stones and feeling very small indeed. Hermione found him not long later as he was standing before the bigger of the two giant penises, imagining the horror of having his cock snapped off. He couldn’t look away from the carnage; it was like a broom wreck.
Millicent narrowed her eyes. “You’re saying you’ll believe in magic, but you won’t believe in alien abductions when I’ve got one right here in front of you, living and breathing?”
She flicked her tail in annoyance, and turned to leave him again. “Oh no you don’t,” he said, scooping her up. “It’s Bring Your Naughty Kneazle to Work Day, my dear. You’re coming with me since you
There was no time for messing about, so he sent a strongly-worded thought at Draco’s clothing, and they vanished themselves from his body and reappeared folded neatly in the chair by the bed. Draco’s lips parted, his teeth gleamed in the candlelight, as he grinned.
Harry laughed, but it was still a good idea. “Brill. You get her that, and I’ll get her one of those Easy-Edit writing journals.”
They cast and parry, and elongated battle in reality as every strong memory Harry’s ever had washes over him in his head. But he’s not there, it’s not enough.
Harry tried to slide by without making much of it, but he knew Draco, so he wasn’t surprised when Malfoy stopped abruptly before the tapestry. Harry paused at the icebox, and looked back at him. He was staring at the tapestry, so close to the threads that his nose nearly touched, and one hand hovered above his mother’s name as if he’d touch it.
She turned her nose up. Across the table, Lee was watching the both of them, his eyebrows raised, saying nothing. His mobile vibrated. Harry caught a glimpse of a woman’s face on the screen before he picked it up and quickly started texting.
He shrugs, and flips the paper over, pointing to the note requesting one clam stick and one scorpion stick. The vendor turns to retrieve them, and the Manticore takes that moment to bound back over to them, curling through Harry’s legs like a cat and yipping like a Basenji.
He grabbed Malfoy, who grabbed Millicent, who grabbed the alien, and they spun away, back to Hogsmeade, on their Portkey.
“Yes, exactly. That’s why I told Potter and his merry band to come over,” Draco said, rolling his own eyes. “Granger, pop those beers open and Potter, I will smother you in your sleep if you don’t put food on this table right now. We had a hell of a Portkey. It’s hurricane season in the Atlantic, apparently.”
Draco’s fingers slid from Harry’s. No one in the circle stepped back. Narcissa’s hands were shivering again.
in the water. Blue and bloated and dispersed between floating detritus like Lego in a child’s bedroom. A helicopter hovered into a corner of the photograph and two rescue divers rappelled down, but there was no life to find there. It had all gone down with the
The United States (Magical or not) wasn’t any worse on the environment than Britain, but it was larger with more
Ron gives him a smile, and it’s almost not a sad one. “So now that Sybil has spoken through me, what are we going to do about all this?”
. And it was really, really great because Malfoy was really, really great, and fun and smart and didn’t support a Quidditch team whose colours kept Harry awake at night. Their increasing closeness made him confident in their friendship, and it also made him want to be the only person Malfoy was this close to.
He wanted a man so badly right now. One who’d fuck his slick hole open, make him feel like such a dirty slag, his cock dripping over the bedsheets as someone pounded into him from behind. Someone with dark hair, and dark skin, and striking eyes that grabbed you and wouldn’t let you go, no matter how hard you tried to look away first.
“Look, I’m not going to let them destroy our work,” Harry said forcefully. He stood up and began to pace. Seabiscuit watched him amid a palette of pink gravel. And that was the story Harry felt in himself.
Harry almost did a double-take. It was so weird to hear someone his own age call the Headmistress by her name. But before he could fully process the strangeness, McGonagall’s green eyes settled on the rest of them. “Mr Yaxley, Mr Weasley. I’m glad to see you’re both doing well. And Mr Potter…” Her eyes narrowed for a moment, and she shook her head. “I would dearly like to see you, just once, when you weren’t causing mischief.”
Draco slowly closed his eyes, pulled his reading glasses from his face, and stared up at the painting above his fireplace. The specially painted library and lab combination he’d had made for Severus was finally occupied.
“That pet shop in Hogsmeade,” Harry said. He pulled on his dragonhide gloves, having no wish at all to paralyse one of his limbs. “Malfoy named her.”
His magic wasn’t entirely gone, it was just… not controllable. He could still access his accidental magic if he needed it. He was getting bored, so he suspected he needed it.
“Is there anything you need Mistress?” Galene said, hovering as close as she could without intruding on the spell space.
“He shifts his weight, reaches down, takes hold of both of us at once. I can’t stop myself from moaning at the feel of another man touching me, wanting me. He bites his lip. His face is flushed and glistening from the heat. He bends his mouth to my ear and nips at the lobe. I arch my neck up, aching for more. I can hear his rasping breaths against my neck.
Mitchell grimaces. “We’re having a bit of trouble getting the spell to stick, and if we can’t get it to stick, we can’t replicate the results, and if we can’t replicate the results, then we can’t help people who—”
“Uncle Harry!” Rosie said, slamming into him. He huffed as all the breath left him in one moment, and then picked her up and spun her around.
The door to Hermione and Millicent’s room swung open and Millicent’s white cat sped out, yowling. It had something red wrapped all around its face. Hermione made a pained noise.
Cassiopeia Malfoy as most people can say is the most perfect pureblood witch when everyone is looking. She has straight blonde hair that fell to her shoulders. Her eyes are silver grey, her features are soft, defined cheekbones and a heart shaped lips. Most boys would definitely have a crush on her.
Draco rolls his eyes because he doesn't like when someone orders him and says, “Why should we, he’s just the boy who lived,” while Cassie just nodded her head to his father’s order.
Draco walked towards them and sat at his father's left hand side, he then greeted his family members.
Draco’s face is red from the intense sex they had moments ago. Harry quickly crawled to him, he was on his knees, massaging the pale soft flesh of Draco’s arse, slipping back his massive cock where it belonged.
They were silent for a second until Draco suddenly jumped into Harry’s lap, legs wrapped around his waist, lifting his skirt up a bit that could almost see his knickers but fortunately, no one was around - beside he wouldn’t care anyways if someone saw him like this.
He shook his head slightly, trying very hard to hide his smile. “It’s okay. I find it quite amusing when people just assumed my sexuality without asking. I mean do I really screamed, ‘I’m gay and I loves strong man’?”
From the look that the Weasley gave him, he would thought that Potter never told him about the proposition. It was his turn to look smug.
Although Draco kept his silence, he still could hear the conversation between Firenze and Potter flowing over him.
‘Blaise’, he said while nodding his head towards him. ‘Midnight all right?’ We’ll meet you in the trophy room, that’s always unlocked and empty of people since nobody wants to wander there and if you lose, there will be consequences, you’ll have to do what I said, understand?’
“The Mediwitches are cleaning and checking them up right now. You should sleep dragon and I’m going to sent a Patronus to our family members telling them you have safely gave birthed, you will see our children when you wake up but right now, please rest okay, Draco?” said Harry, brushing his hair away from his face, lingering at his pink tinted cheeks, Draco bobbed his head up and down and closes his eyes again.
Mother came into his room when he didn’t go down for dinner. He told her that he was not hungry but Mother could see right through his lies, so she called for Dobby, she kisses his temple and walked out of his room, giving one last look at him as she sighed softly under her breath.
“Harry,” Draco panted, his fingers digging into the flesh at Harry’s shoulder blades. “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
that,” Malfoy says, speeding up his thrusts. He’s got a wicked gleam in his eye as he reaches up to drag his fingers through the come on Harry’s belly. Harry lets him fuck him. He’d thought Malfoy might finish quickly after that, but no, it seems he’s planning to take his time. By the time his thrusts start becoming erratic, Harry’s half-hard again and he notices it.
“Our samples from the magical depletion sites came in this morning,” said Professor Sprout. “And since we’ve just seventh and eighth year Hufflepuffs in this class, I’d like to change the curriculum for the day. We were going to work on harvesting techniques for the mint family, but I think we’d all be better served with a return to third year’s lesson on soil analysis. Shall we?”
But then someone stepped out of the crowd of cloaks and smiled up at him. Eloise Midgen. She said, “Hello, Harry. Welcome to the Golden Cup.” She reached out for his hand, and on automatic, he took it. Hers was warm despite the chill of the night. Her brown eyes were soft like Hermione’s; it helped settle Harry’s nerves.
The pop of her Disapparition left a vacuum feeling in the room, empty and drawing in. They were mostly packed but neither was ready to go. Potter looked at him and then wouldn’t stop—just kept on staring at Draco as if Draco were the only solid thing in the room. He rather felt like he wasn’t.
Harry sighed, and continued his tour through the wing, carefully letting Mrs Black peek out from his summer jacket. It was too hot even with just the linen, but he hadn’t been able to hide her sufficiently otherwise. They travelled through several more rooms before Mrs Black hissed, “Stop!”
He found the Alchemy section and scanned the shelves for titles that looked relevant enough to what he was looking for and modern enough that he’d be able to understand the text. Despite his enthusiasm, this was not Harry’s forte, and he felt adrift amid the sea of books and unfamiliar terminology. This dedication was not spurred from some long-lost, innate sense of studiousness, but from something much more primal and raw. Where Voldemort had been a monstrous, nightmarish fear, it was something physical he could fight. The prospect of losing his magic was so much more; it was feral, icy, and it stole his breath when he thought on it too long. His determination to help was about survival, about keeping him and his community alive.
Their Airbnb was a terrace—very similar to all the other houses they’d so far seen in DC. It was the third in a line of six or seven and painted a very unassuming greige with white trim. The inside was recently updated—an open layout that looked straight to the back door, with a narrow living room in front, a dining table next, and then a large, airy kitchen in the back, hopefully with a loo tucked beneath the stairs. They headed up the stairs and found two tidy bedrooms and a single bath in the hall, with another set of stairs continuing up to the top.
Why couldn’t the Ministry see that he had no interest in their politics and games? He didn’t want to take over the Ministry. He wanted to
Which it very well might. But fuck it, he’d love Draco as a Muggle if he had to. He’d love him as whatever he had to.
The Potions section was unsurprisingly always one of the least crowded. Professor Snape’s legacy lived on in the fear, even under a year of Slughorn and now Professor Decant, of Potions. It was kind of sad, actually, because Decant was a right nice bloke – and young and handsome, too, if Harry were asked. It almost got him to take Potions this year. 'Almost' being the key word.
Addolgar sighed, the very picture of long-sufferance. “Harry, what is the point of learning something half-arsedly? That’s a complete waste of time. Now, I know this is difficult for you, having spent your formative years in Gryffindor, but can you please stay with me here?”
Dudley rolled his eyes at the hearth above Harry’s sitting room fireplace. “Says the talking painting.”
“Not at all,” Draco said. “They were one of only three advanced civilisations in existence at the time—the Mayans, the Celtics, and the Atlanteans. The Greeks didn’t develop control over magic for another three thousand years. And Atlantis had a much closer relationship with the foundations of the Universe than later civilisations did. Or do. Their magic was more elemental, and they had a connection to Time Magic that no civilisation has yet to rediscover.”
“Morning,” Harry said, his voice catching. He flushed, looked down to hide his eyes, and made the mistake of taking in Ruby’s swim trunks. Red tartan.
Harry blushed again. Ruby wasn’t much of a talker, but Merlin, his arms were even bigger up close than Harry’d thought. He ran his eyes over the one nearest him, laid out against the edge of the heated pool. “Having a good time in Barcelona?”
“Wise,” said Severus. He conjured a patio chair in the painting and sat down. “Have you been able to see any of the Muggles’ reactions?”
“Mate, how’d Malfoy talk you into this?” Lee was asking, a laugh in his voice. “I thought for sure I’d never see you set foot outside Christendom.”
At one-hundred, he paused, and attempted to steady his breathing. “What are you doing?” he whispered.
“Harry! And Draco! What an absolutely outstanding bit of luck,” Slughorn said as he came upon them. He slapped them both heartily on the shoulder and then stepped back to do the same to the companion he’d brought along.
He grabs his wand and coats his fingers with conjured lube. It drips between them and onto their cocks. Harry slicks Draco’s up, feels him trembling with each stroke, and then reaches behind himself to do himself. He doesn’t hesitate, but he’ll admit that he has no idea what he’s doing. One finger slides in and he tentatively moves it in and out, to no particular effect or sensation.
Draco shrugged miserably. “We can try,” he said. “My contact said there’s a fifty percent chance he’ll recover any use of his sevens. And even if he does, it’ll never be a number that comes naturally to him. He’ll always have to count that number out on fingers, or write it out in tallies.”
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” said Draco, who now had a determined glint to his eye that Harry, for one, could appreciate. “Potter’s not a complete idiot.”
As he half-expects, Malfoy tenses. Their eyes meet and hold, and then Malfoy looks away, saying nothing, like a good model. He isn’t here for his opinion, after all.
“He won’t,” Snape said, in case anyone had any doubts about it. “Perhaps Mr Potter should stop by Twilfit’s for a new set of press robes this Hogsmeade.”
And they all listened to him. The voices trailed off in perfect harmony. As one, the Hufflepuffs left the den, their footsteps measured and confident. Harry was swept along with them, in perfect synchrony without even having to try.
“Yes,” Harry said, having no idea how, exactly he would. Lee and Hermione gave him annoyed looks. Harry ignored them. “I study water as my job. I’ll figure out what’s causing the… what’s stealing the air from the water and we’ll fix it.”
“There are plenty of hazards besides,” Harry says, thinking of the final-final fitting he’s going to have to do on Malfoy before the show. He just has to be
Draco he’d rekindled his love of Atlantis after the War, hoping at first to escape from the monotony of house-arrest. Where Narcissa had obsessively taken up and mastered useless hobby after useless hobby, Draco had thrown himself back into his childhood, escaping into nostalgia. Into times before the War, before they were all trapped in a home that terrified them. For years, Draco and Narcissa had struggled not to resent Lucius his community service; humiliating as it was meant to be, at least he got to leave the Manor.
“True, yeah,” said Kyle. “But the difference here is, we’ve got so many people spread so far out that we can never come to an agreement on anything. MACUSA’s been thinking of dividing itself up among the MUS… it’s just too big to govern, with too many regions wanting different things. I wish the US would do the same, to be honest. They’d all be happier if they were five or six different countries instead of one, but try telling them that.”
quite Gryffindor,” Nott observed, staring round the spa and the gold-and-red decor he and Hermione had installed that afternoon.
“The problem of magic, of course,” said the Queen. She reached for a small shell-shaped bell on the table next to her and rang it. Immediately, a house-elf appeared, though this one was strange: brown-skinned, delicate of feature, much more like the elves of lore than the ungainly house-elves of modern day.
Harry took a healthy sip of his brandy and sat down, his stomach suddenly remembering how hungry he was now that food was in front of him. It was steak and ale pie, steam still coming off it in waves, the crust golden brown and buttery. They set in without fanfare, and for once, the silence wasn’t oppressive. There was tension in the air, but it was tension from the thoughts swirling around in their own heads, not from one another.
Harry sighed. He didn’t know if Draco was doing it on purpose, but he’d pretty much just ensured Ron would ask Pansy on a date and then he’d ask her to marry him and then he’d ask her for three to four kids just to prove a point. Which was just great because if Draco never forgave Harry for the stupid blood spell, Harry would still have to see him regularly when Ron and Pansy came around.
“Your Majesty,” Millicent said, “we thought we’d use the alien instead. Weasley here reminded us of a spell we could use to make it a willing sacrifice. We can’t keep it alive and we’d rather not have to take your life.”
“Mischief?” Harry repeated. He was beginning to wonder about the Wizarding World’s use of words, but perhaps he’d just been out of Britain too long. “Er, good to see you, too, Headmistress.”
“What are you two giggling about?” Harry asked, maybe a bit grumpily. He had almost used the Time-Turner the Ministry had issued him for school trips, but felt a bit like that would make him a failure as an adult, and had decided to be a martyr to the day instead.
He took the downtime to try cleaning up what he could. He thought he could rig up a spell to reduce objects to their base parts, based on the same research he and Draco had been doing for a water-cleaning potions. It was just a matter of convincing his brain, and thus his magical core, that it was an emergency.
“Do you refer to Merlin’s affinity with both?” Malfoy asked. “Or do you mean that both are imprecise arts?”
It wasn’t easy keeping up this facade for Andromeda and Teddy’s sakes. It wasn’t easy working with Draco day by day, missing him night by night, and having to fake something that should’ve been real once a month. They used to be so good together. They used to have the highest solve rate in the Auror Department.
Which reminded him of Hermione’s email. He wanted to call her, but he couldn’t implicate her in this...every time they passed a phone box, he nearly did it, but he always changed his mind at the last minute. It was too much to ask. He wouldn’t see her end up magicless in Azkaban with them. Albus needed a godmother, and her own kids needed a mum. That being said, she was probably having several litters of Kneazle kittens by now.
the sticking spells keeping his IV tube in his skin and him, therefore, attached to the hospital bed. He can’t stay here overnight; he really will go Lockhart.
It’s been eighty-nine years since he’s had sex and sixty-five since he wanted it. Nineteen years celibate had all come crashing down on him one night and he’d thought, maybe, intimacy with anyone would’ve been preferable to emptiness. He’d been wrong. He’d nearly kissed him, some anonymous man, but then he’d seen his wedding ring as his hand cradled the man’s face, and he’d been horrified.
“I’m sure you understand,” Luna said gravely. She still had silver tinsel in her hair, which Harry was certain had not been brushed yet, despite them all sitting down to breakfast. He said nothing, as he hadn’t brushed his all summer.
Harry considered not touching the Portkey, letting it activate without him there. He’d miss his connection to Sydney and then maybe he could go home and just…Nope. Magical binding contract.
But here, he just stepped into water the perfect temperature, pressure, and smell, and couldn’t help the little flush of contentment it sent through him. Draco hardly knew what to do with himself without a seven-year-old running around. Scorpius had been—predominantly—his domain for so long he felt a little adrift without him singing to himself in the next room. He wondered if this was how Astoria had always felt when they’d been in Greece and she’d been here.
Maybe they would’ve thought fast with a strong Levitation charm or a propulsion spell to get them to the surface, but the likelihood they were unconscious when they hit it would have been high. And then they would’ve just drowned up there instead.
This only served to set Boot off on another round of laughter, as Ron’s questionable judgement in regards to Quidditch teams was well-documented throughout Hogwarts.
“Vaguely nauseated,” he said, which was true. He’d drank way too much. “I should’ve never confessed to Ron that I was—um. Lonely.”
good. Whatever. He finished off his coffee and pushed back from the table. “Well, since I’ve got to wait until Malfoy’s cousin gets in, I’m going to take Mrs Black to the Smithsonian. Malfoy? Coming?”
He blinks at her several times, trying to make sense of the words. They do make sense, in a strange, disconnected sort of way, but when he tries to process them on a deeper level, that disconnect doesn’t go away. He’s not quite all there, he’ll give them that (who
“You said you’ve been having…visions. Did those visions tell you how to get Dudley back? Or has anyone contacted you? Anyone who’s been abducted before? We don’t know what to do,” he finished, feeling his throat constrict.
Draco slowly approached, coming round behind Potter to glance over his shoulder. The being came into view and Draco gasped, grabbing hold of Potter’s biceps to steady himself and not remembering to let go until Potter made a note of pain, low in his throat. Draco loosened his fingers, but held on.
“Tonight, at Mentors Meeting,” Addolgar suggested. “All the initiated Hufflepuffs are supposed to come anyway, to help with the whiz-bang experiments.”
“Do it, Scarhead,” Draco panted. His head was thrown back, his lip caught between his teeth. Harry could live off this view.
Hermione froze. Harry reached beneath the table and clenched her hand in what he hoped was a comforting manner. Of course this topic would come up, it was just that neither of them had expected it to come up at the dinner table only thirty minutes after their arrival. In hindsight, they should’ve known better.
Given the fact that they were already in public together, Harry reckoned the odds weren’t as bad as all that. In fact—
A lot of the time, Harry just sits in his hotel room, trying to comprehend Lebanese soap operas on telly and waiting for the owl that may or may not come from the Embassy. Inevitably, his thoughts return to Malfoy, to the three years they were partners in Auror Academy and the four that they were partners on the actual force.
Harry’s eyes widened. “And when the plastics degrade in the sun, it gets in the soil, and makes the soil a trap for it. The flowers can’t grow because it’s sucking the magic from them, too.”
He’d woken up the next morning assured he was taking leave of his senses. He’d gone through the stages of grief. He’d accepted it. What else was he going to do for the next five years, after all?
He pointed to the centre of the cauldron, where their red stone sat on a pile of something like sludgy sand. Both the stone and the sand looked sickly and dull. “It’s combined with the Poison and the impurities.”
“I think so, yeah,” she said, shrugging, but her smile said it all. “We’ll see how it goes.” She glanced down to Harry’s arms. “Are you going to release Seabiscuit?”
Lucius and Narcissa exchanged a speaking glance. Lucius cleared his throat and said, “We don’t know. Your mother found it this afternoon, during her walk around the grounds.”
Much posher than Harry’s plain black ones. Since Snape didn’t have family colours, he got to choose Harry’s robes, and he’d chosen…black.
The bedclothes were a disaster. A faint imprint where Dudley had been lying was still evident. Across the way, the telly was showing a dark-skinned detective, the show’s dark atmosphere very much something Severus would’ve preferred all his paintings to be in.
“We aren’t really family,” Harry had to say, because he was definitely a little confused. Maybe it was an American thing.
Draco kicked at the new snow as he walked. He said, “Do you really think we’ll survive it if Muggles figure us out?"
In truth, Harry was fairly well versed, too. His mother had used one for him, after all, and there had been a time, some years back, when he’d wanted to know all he could about that.
Definitely Draco. No one does inappropriate portmanteaus quite like him. And then the rest of it hits him:
, for fuck’s sake. He can easily still be a dick if she’s a good partner, but he much prefers to have a nominal excuse.
“Ron,” Harry says sternly. “You need to dislike her. You need to find it in yourself to dislike her enough that you would make her miserable if you had a chance. Miserable like she’s made you, yeah? Remember? Miserable enough that you’re a clear danger, and the two of you would cause instability between not just yourselves but your whole family. It’s bigger than you. And when you’ve got that,
. It’s not as if you’ve bound my eternal soul, or whatever this piece of me is, to an eternity at the beck-and-call of Hogwarts itself, is it? Except that is exactly what it is. Let me live, for Merlin’s sake. Without the whinging living to whinge at me.”
, he thought. His body was on fire with want for Draco, even after their uncomfortable interruption. He’d never be able to kiss anyone else again after this. He was utterly ruined.
Malfoy steadies. Harry stares at his cock, hidden beneath the loose fit of his silk trousers. It isn’t like he’s never seen the bulge of Malfoy’s package before—he’s been dressing him for seven years, after all. It’s just that he’s never seen it so close to his mouth; he’s never seen it beneath thin, watery silk; he’s never seen it after learning that Malfoy is a Veela. If there’s ever a time for Malfoy to declare his intention to Veela bond with him or whatever, now’s it.
For a while, he and Malfoy allowed themselves to sit in that strange silence that was lingering between them since their abrupt reconnection in DC, but by the time they hit the bridge, Harry was bored and unwilling to suffer it any longer. He turned to Malfoy.
Harry nodded, and he and Hermione picked up their carry-with bags and followed Lee somewhat sluggishly towards the three-tailed Starbucks. Lee’s posture screamed exhaustion, but he gave them both a smile when they caught up.
Eyes still closed, head still in his hands, Malfoy continued: “I know what we need to do. There’s a spell, an old one. It used Muggles,” Malfoy explained.
Harry very much would, but he really shouldn’t. What’s he going to do with a Manticore in England? Dawlish will definitely never let him back to work if he brings home one of those. That’s assuming he isn’t arrested at Customs for trafficking.
Draco leaned in and nosed his neck, very briefly. When he raised his head again, his cheeks were pink. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“I know,” Harry said, almost numbly. It was really working, and he had no idea how he’d come to deserve this, or when he’d become good enough to do it at all. When he’d approached Draco with the idea of working on Alchemy together, he’d never really thought they’d succeed. He’d never thought they’d even get to the first operation. It was, he could admit, just a desperate measure used to spend time with him.
“Hermione said Minister Shacklebolt is punishing the Americans,” Harry offered. It was a new year, so technically Britain had a fresh quota of 600 Obliviations they could use, but the Ministry reported that they were electing to use none of them, in ‘deference to the wishes of the MUS.’ What a load of bollocks that was.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Harry snarled, feeling his face heat with anger… and maybe some humiliation, too. “You knew I wanted you all this time, didn’t you?”
Harry’s fingers clench on the fragile pages, but no one notices. He doesn’t look up. Carefully, he says, “I’m getting to the point. The background is for Hermione, who no doubt cares.”
Harry pulled his timetable from his bag and nearly jumped for joy upon seeing that most of his classes were now with Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, until he realized that Malfoy was now in his house, Goyle was in Gryffindor, and Parkinson and Bulstrode were in Ravenclaw. There really was no escape, was there? His life was a constant series of attacks on all fronts.
“What a lovely feline, Harry,” said Professor Sprout, to his right. He caught Hermione giving him a very pointed look. It said,
The common room was circular, with lots of gold and yellow in the upholstery and landscape paintings. The upper walls were lined in circular windows with plants stuffed into every corner, niche, and sill. A multitude of vine varieties were crawling up the walls. There were two fireplaces on either end, presumably because the den would tend towards coolness, being underground.
, a Quik Quotes Quill, and a dragon scale. This, Dune interpreted to mean that Harry was fond of Dumbledore, liked efficiency (the quill) and adventure (the dragon scale). All in all, not bad. Titus was less successful, and Harry was, frankly, disturbed with his guess that the book represented unfulfilled Greek love between Harry and Dumbledore.
Harry stiffened. He looked around the Great Hall to see if anything looked amiss, anything that would signal that this was a dream. Everything looked normal. Hesitantly, he lifted his eyes to the person now sitting next to him, poshly buttering toast.
