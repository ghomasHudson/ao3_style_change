“Is that a threat?” Malfoy cuts his eyes at him. “Anyway, I’m sure I’ll see you soon, I’ll give you back your clothes then. And watch out for a call from Blaise,” he says before stepping into the Floo.
“Adam,” the stranger replies. He’s rather cute, tall with dusty brown hair and lots of freckles splashed across his nose and cheeks.
Harry nods. “No problem. Er, I’ll go grab something for you to wear. The bathroom is just next to the kitchen.”
She glances at the clock. “Already? I guess we began this excursion rather early. Alright, we’re off,” she announces to Blaise, standing up and slinging her bag over her shoulder.
“Big Austen fan?” he asks, plunking down his own coffee cup and taking the comfy armchair next to Malfoy’s.
“Weaselette is quite the pushy one, isn’t she,” comments Malfoy, blowing smoke out of the corner of his mouth. Harry starts to tell him off, but Malfoy beats him to it. “Calm down, Potter, it wasn’t an insult. She’s lovely, but you can’t deny that she likes to get her way.”
Ron leaps to his feet and goes to find Dean and Seamus. Harry thinks Ginny says something, but all he can think about is waffles with cream and strawberries, the perfect meal for his inebriated state. The next few moments are a blur as they finally leave the club and walk down the street in search of a diner that’s still open. Harry’s vision is a bit fuzzy and he thinks he’s telling Pansy how much he loves everyone, but recognizes that he’s not making much sense and she probably thinks he’s an idiot.
Malfoy looks down at his shirt, clinging to his chest and dripping water on the hardwood floor. He sighs. “I guess I’d better. Thanks,” he adds.
“She is,” agrees Malfoy. He pauses. “I have to ask, why did you invite me for Quidditch? Didn’t have anyone else to play with?”
Pulling out the book, Malfoy opens to the page he’s currently on, but then stops. “Do you fancy a smoke?” he asks lightly.
Harry does just that, and parks the motorcycle in the alley out back when he gets home, admiring just how gorgeous it is, polished metal shining in the moonlight.
Turning on the coffee pot, he opens the junk drawer in his kitchen and rummages around for a pen. After finding two that don’t work he finally finds one that does, barely, and scribbles a note to Malfoy on a paper towel.
Just as Harry exits the last place he’s looked at, he receives an owl from Ginny. It’s just one line and the slip of paper contains a time and address that’s not too far from where he currently is. He has barely enough time to grab a tea from a shop nearby and make it to his appointment on time.
She nods and shortly returns with two enormous shot glasses. “Cheers,” Malfoy says, picking up his whiskey. Harry does the same, and after clinking it against Malfoy’s, throws his head back and downs the whole thing. He winces as it sears the back of his throat, but the warm feeling that it leaves in his stomach is most welcome. He’ll need it, if he’s to face the rest of the night with a smile on his face.
“I dunno,” Ginny answers. “But I like...want to hang out with her all the time. Like even when I’m with Blaise I just want to be spending time with Luna instead. Does that make me a terrible person?”
made horrible fucking choices that hurt everyone around me. I wish I could go back and slap some sense into myself. I’ve spent this whole year trying to distance myself from who I used to be but it still doesn’t feel like enough. It feels wrong — I
“Oh, yes please,” she sighs. “As I was saying, it’s your fault. This started at your stupid housewarming party that you weren’t even there for, because you invited Luna and I hadn’t seen her since school. We used to be so close, I don’t know what happened, and we just were talking the whole time, and we’ve been seeing each other a lot since then.”
Malfoy nods and pats him on the arm. “Quite right. Glad we are on the same page about this, Potter,” he says softly. His sunglasses have slipped to the end of his nose and his grey eyes, visible over the rim of his glasses, burn into Harry. “It’s important to know your history.”
Malfoy finishes the poem and reaches for Harry’s glass of water. Harry passes it to him silently, still absorbing Mary Oliver’s words. They sit for a minute, quietly reveling in her genius, before Malfoy turns over to lie on his back and look at the ceiling, just as Harry is doing.
“Wouldn’t miss it,” replies Harry. Grimacing, he adds, “Thank you both so much for coming, again. Sorry I was missing for most of it. D’you think people minded?”
Harry’s throat closes up. He manages to croak out a response before fleeing the bathroom, leaving Malfoy to shower in peace. The image of the crisscrossing scars, Dark Mark on his forearm, septum piercing, rings piled on the edge of the sink will probably be burned into the back of Harry’s mind for the rest of his days.
Not bothering to knock on the door, he steps inside and encounters a still-empty home. Rounding the corner, he glimpses Molly standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot of chili and humming to herself.
They reach Ginny’s flat and she unlocks the door and lets them in. Ron dives for the sofa and so Harry is relegated to the floor, where Ginny throws him a couple blankets. Malfoy joins him on the ground and Harry spreads the blanket over his legs as well, leaning his head back against the couch as Ginny turns on Pride (2014) dir. Matthew Warchus. It’s a fantastic film, but Harry’s exhausted and finds himself nodding off in the middle of it. He thinks he might be leaning on Malfoy’s shoulder, but he’s drifting off into sleep and can’t be sure of anything at the moment.
The month of May passes with little fanfare. Harry spends it cleaning Grimmauld Place, to Kreacher’s immense distaste, sleeping, and learning to cook things other than eggs. But mostly, he goes to bed early and wakes up late, eats very little, and tries to get out of the house a couple times a week to see his friends. Now that NEWT results have arrived, most of them are busy applying for jobs and internships. Ron has started Auror training, and Hermione has been welcomed to St. Mungo’s as an intern in the Spell Damage ward. Both of their hours are long and whenever Harry sees the pair, they’re exhausted. Ginny has received her official welcome to the Holyhead Harpies, so now even she’s wrapped up with practice and constant travel. Harry’s tired too, all the time, though he doesn’t have a reason for it. Sure, his sleep has been interrupted by nightmares practically every night, but he feels like it’s not really an excuse.
In times like this, he wished he had his dad, or Sirius, or Remus, or anyone to help him figure things out.
-"Hi. I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy. Are you going to buy your robes as well?"- He asked, turning to face Harry.
-"Why did you left yesterday?"- Harry asked. Draco sat in a chair near Harry's bed and was relieved to feel that Harry felt better.
One time, Harry and his friends were walking to Potions and Harry was feeling specially happy because he shared it with Draco when he heard him.
Harry shook his head. Draco traced his scar gently with his index finger and Harry closed his eyes, leaning in.
He knew that he could've studied at Beauxbatons but it just didn't seem right to him. Hogwarts was his home.
-“He’s doing surprisingly well.”- Bill told him with a small, encouraging smile. Harry nodded and went to see Draco.
Harry wondered when and why exactly it had happened, but the only answer he received was his breaths becoming shorter and shorter with every passing moment he thought about it.
-“I want to kill them all.”- Harry grunted, pulling himself away from Draco to grab a breath. He could hear Draco’s ragged breaths underneath him.
The memories, the touches, the faces...they were all too much. Draco shifted into a fetal position and starting rocking himself back and forth, tears falling down freely.
It was desperate and angry. As if Harry was pouring everything he couldn't say through words in the kiss.
-"Just go to breakfast. You said you were starving. I'll be there in a minute."- Draco told them, hoping that Blaise would simply shut up. He was going to murder him if he didn't.
Harry stared at Draco for the longest time until Draco looked down, automatically rubbing the arm on which his new tattoo rested gracefully.
-“Mother, did you made tea?”- He asked, the small shake in his voice subtly hidden by his serious tone.
Harry had been the last one to leave Transfiguration and found that Draco was outside, apparently searching for something.
-"Mother grabbed me immediately and we Apparated at the Manor. Death Eaters were waiting for us. One of them casted an Incendio towards me."- Harry wanted to vomit. Draco sighed,
-"Draco I.."- Draco had shook his head repeatedly, interrupting Harry by hugging him. Harry hugged him back tightly.
-"Aren't you supposed to be at Beauxbatons?"- Draco asked, but relaxed in Harry's arms. Harry kissed his neck, earning a groan from Draco.
He was only teasing Harry when he said those things about Ron. Deep inside, Draco knew that Ron was a good wizard and that he had the heart of a lion.
-"Woah, slow down Potter. Your food isn't going anywhere."- He joked. Harry stuck out his tongue and kept eating.
-"S-surrounding Mr. Potter won't help him. Dr. Rivers and I will examine him. Everyone else get back to work."- Draco said as firmly as he could.
After the war, Draco finished his studies at Hogwarts and trained to be a Mind Healer. At the beginning, people distrusted him...some still do. But with Potter's testimony, people knew better than to gossip in his face. He didn't care about the rumours because he was pleasantly surprised when Potter testified for him.
-"Because if you're not, you're gonna need it. Potter is coming right this way."- Blaise announced in between laughs.
Draco wouldn’t let anyone touch him. No one knew why or what had happened after the war, but Draco came back to his eighth year completely changed.
-“You like me!”- Draco stated, laughing brightly. Harry wanted to deny it, but he was drowning in Draco’s laugh. He had never heard the blonde laugh so brightly and carefree before.
-“Mental! Absolutely mental! What were you thinking?”- Harry simply shrugged with his eyes glued to Draco, not wanting to deal with Ron.
He wasn't really dancing, of course. He was gracefully balancing, and every now and then, he would dare to let a foot on the other side of the edge. Where there was nothing but the cold night air and a small abysm waiting for him, calling him to wherever place his mother and father now where in.
-"No one should take away your food."- Harry whispered, looking down. He dared to glance at Draco, who was looking at him with a expression that Harry couldn't figure out.
-“Go on, Granger. I can handle it.”- Draco whispered. Hermione closed her eyes and took the dagger out.
-"Make what stop, Draco?"- Harry asked, frantically. He didn't knew what to do and he couldn't see Blaise or Pansy. Draco sobbed harder and Harry couldn't help pulling him into a hug.
-"Oh, it's nothing. I just..I told Pansy and Blaise to go without me to the Great Hall. I could go by myself, but if Headmistress McGonagall sees me, I'll never hear the end of it."- Draco groaned.
-"Um..no, thank you. I'm here with my friends, actually. I just wanted to say hi."- Harry explained a bit embarrassed.
-"You really don't have to do all of this for someone like me."- Harry could feel his anger rising and all he wanted to do was to go back and hex that student.
-"I'm assuming mother already told you, but in case she didn't, my name's Draco."- He introduced softly before walking away.
-“Listen to me, Harry. You could never disappoint me, okay? Relapse happens and it doesn’t make your feelings or your progress invalid. Only next time you’re thinking about it, please talk to me, okay?”- Draco said. Harry pulled away and nodded, wiping his tears away.
-“You know exactly what I’m talking about. Who was that? Why did she held you like that?”- Harry asked. Draco sighed and stopped. The hall was empty.
Someone used the Cruciatus Curse on Draco, but instead of screaming, Draco’s hands emitted a silver glow with purple specks.
Draco tried to glance at his direction and Harry wanted to face-palm himself for not noticing before.
-"I have a mark and a lot of people that would suggest otherwise."- Draco was starting to feel it again. The need to jump out of the Astronomy Tower.
-"Are you absolutely sure about this?"- McGonagall asked. Draco nodded firmly. Despite his heart beating loudly and quickly, he knew perfectly well what his boggart would be.
-"Thank you for listening."- Harry said. He realised that Draco would act awkward whenever Harry thanked him and Harry liked that.
-"You can stop this now, Harry. Go back to sleep."- Draco said tiredly before walking away. But Harry wasn't taking none of it, so he quickly grabbed Draco's arm and spun him around so that Draco was now facing him.
-"I'm sure Granger is very capable of keeping a secret and not betraying people's trust, unlike you."- Draco said and left Harry's office.
-“I understand.”- Harry told him. Draco looked away and frowned, remembering the time Harry had protected him from those students.
Christmas holidays came sooner than he expected, and Harry was surprised to find out that Draco was staying at Hogwarts.
He was now in pyjamas that were a bit too big for him and he was watching the ocean through the window.
This year, McGonagall was giving the class. She wanted to teach the students how to defeat Boggarts, but she gave them the benefit of volunteering because of everything that had happened.
Harry had never been good at dealing with his emotions, so when that numbness suddenly took over him, it felt like a relief.
Draco’s mind stopped working and didn’t even notice that Harry was dragging him to the carriage until he was already sitting down.
Harry pulled up the hood and made his way to the Slytherin common room. Giving the password impatiently, he was allowed in and because he was invisible and his mind was on autopilot, he crashed right against Draco who was about to head out of the common room.
Giving him a moment, Harry stayed a bit longer. Then, he too stood up and silently made his way back to his room.
-“I just needed a moment.”- He shrugged. Harry stopped petting the thestral and stared at Draco instead.
-"I'm sure you'll be a good Auror, Ron."- Harry was now watching them both and nodded in agreement at Hermione's statement.
Harry headed towards the Astronomy Tower and was actually surprised when he saw Draco dancing in the edge.
-“Specially at this age, when you’re growing and changing and your emotions are out of control, attracting the nargles.”-
-"I-I'm sorry. I..I was curious. Pardon me if I made you uncomfortable."- Draco told him. Harry was trying so hard to stifle his laughter but he couldn't hold it any longer. He laughed big and brightly and Draco
-"Suit yourself."- Harry stood up and started walking with Draco following him. As soon as Harry walked out, Draco passed out.
the brightest witch of her age."- Lucius commented, eyes posing on Draco. Draco let go of Harry's hand.
Draco had now heterochromia iridum as a result of the hex. His right eye was still stormy grey, but his left iris was now tinted with a pretty shade of violet.
Three months in, he found out the Lucius had actually been a death eater before, but no one had known about it. Dolohov had been one too and Harry couldn't be happier.
Draco was broken out of his trance and helped Harry to pick up his books, much to the latter's surprise.
-"You do know that I don't hate you, right? Sure, you're irritable, and an arsehole, and an absolute pain.."-
-“Uh, if you say so...”- Harry shrugged, his sight never leaving Draco’s. After some painful minutes in silence, Harry turned to Luna.
Draco's sight went from Harry to the moon and then back at Harry. He bit his lip before stepping towards Harry and Harry caught him.
Harry stood in his room slightly confused. One minute Draco was a nightmare and the next he was being civil.
He looked youthful, but at the same time grown up. Harry had definitely seen him before at Hogwarts, but never really talked to him.
-"If you think that Draco's going to listen to us, Potter, then you're wrong. And he's not a child. Nights are always hard for him; he prefers it this way and we respect his choices."- Pansy shrugged solemnly.
Draco and Harry kept on seeing each other a bit more often. Now they greeted each other in public and whenever they did, Harry would smile brightly and Draco would swing his arms back and forth, back and forth, back and forth happily.
Then, Draco guided him to his room and Harry quietly slid into Draco's bed. Draco closed the curtains and casted a Silencing Spell.
Draco barely mumbled something and the papers that Harry had went flying directly into Malfoy's hands.
people's emotions. It got worse when my mother died. I don't know how to tune people's emotions out, but I do know how to focus on just one person's emotions and feel those deeper and stronger for a bit, which is why I can work effectively with my patients."- Draco left out the fact that he could feel Harry's emotions more intensely because that just seemed a bit too much to reveal.
-“Brilliant! Thank you, Draco!”- Hermione said when they were done, unconsciously touching Draco’s hand. Draco froze.
-“It’s a reminder. He’s always there with you.”- Two other names appeared above other two butterflies,
-"He proved himself to be better than his family, he had no choice, and ultimately sided with us during the war!"- Harry fumed, interrupting Hermione.
Slowly (painfully slowly) but surely, Draco acknowledged Harry with a brief nod. It was almost imperceptible.
-“Obviously, you can glamour them as I’m sure you’ve done in the past; however, I suggest you keep the bandages at least for three days, otherwise they might get infected.”-
-“Oh, focus on your chicken Ron.”- Hermione told him, effectively shutting him up but not without him grimacing.
-"Holidays will be hard for Draco from now on, Potter. Specially Christmas. Have you tried searching in the Shrieking Shack though?"- Harry basically ran to the Shrieking Shack and found Draco inside.
Harry wanted to scream. At Hogwarts, Draco acted as if he didn't know the boy. It was the obvious choice, since Harry was in Gryffindor and Draco in Slytherin, but Harry
-"So, this is the famous Draco I keep hearing about."- Sirius greeted mischievously, making Harry blush. Draco cleared his throat.
Rivers levitated Harry to the ICU, set him on the nearest bed, and started examining him from head to toe as gently as he could.
-“Who’s there?”- Harry took off his invisibility cloak and smiled shyly at him. Draco visibly relaxed and proceeded to sit back again at the edge.
His hand travelled to Draco's knee and he felt Draco stiffen. Harry frowned when Draco gently removed his hand but shrugged it off when Draco didn't let go of said hand and instead, intertwined their fingers together.
-"What's the deal with them?"- he asked Hermione once they had finished their breakfast and were walking to their respective class.
-"If I must."- Draco shrugged nonchalantly but on the inside, he was dying to know what the bet was.
Neither of them had spoken about what had happened, but found themselves meeting the next night. And the next.
-“Harry, do you want more pumpkin juice?”- Hermione asked in a knowing tone that broke Harry out of his trance.
-“What do you mean?”- Harry asked confusedly. This time, Draco looked down and fidgeted with his hands.
Draco entered despite Myrtle’s warning and found Harry on the floor, blood dripping down his wrist and pained sobs fulfilling the air.
Harry wasn't allowed to see Draco either and that just pissed him off even more. Draco was only allowed to come downstairs to eat after both Narcissa and Harry had finished their business downstairs.
The problem was that something had changed in Draco. He was meaner, always sticking up to those bloody stupid pureblood ideals.
Maintaining his distance, Harry sat in the grass simply staring at Draco while Draco kept moving his hands.
-“Alright then, if you’re absolutely sure about it.”- Draco told him. Harry nodded solemnly and stood up.
-“Alright, but if he makes any sign of harm or sudden movement, I’ll hex the life out of the git.”- Ron threatened.
Draco was surprised by Blaise and Pansy on his birthday. They brought him a small, chocolate cake to his room and sang to him. Draco quietly thanked them. He felt so happy already and it was only the beginning of the day.
Apparating took more strength than he had at the moment. Harry gently carried him to his room and tucked him in his bed.
Realising that he was spacing out, Draco quickly grabbed his things and walked out of the hospital. The sun was setting and Draco was surprised about how much time he had been unconscious.
."- Zabini chose his words carefully, but Harry realised that there was more to it. Giving him a stiff nod, he went back to his table.
-"He was a bit mad for a few hours, but Ron understands. He said that he loved us both and that if it wasn't working, it simply wasn't. He said we both deserved to be happy."- Harry smiled fondly.
-“Harry?”- Draco called, bringing him back from his trance. Draco was wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt with ruffles at the front, a silky black ribbon tied in a pretty bow around the collar of his shirt, and black pants. Most importantly, his hair was messy.
-"I can show you how to do it in your room, if you'd like."- Draco said quietly behind him, startling Harry a bit. Harry nodded and handed him the tray. Draco raised a brow but took the tray nevertheless. Harry shrugged in response.
-“Aren’t you going to be late? Defence Against the Dark Arts is on the other side of the castle.”- Draco pointed out softly. Harry’s eyes widened and he flushed.
-"I'll be looking forward to it."- Draco said graciously. He bowed and, much to Harry's surprise, he grabbed Harry's hand gently and kissed it, making Harry gasp audibly.
be the one asking you that?"- Harry shot. Draco laughed, something Harry hadn't heard from him in quite some time.
-"Mr. Jones, we do not condone any type of bullying here at Hogwarts. Professor Flitwick will arrange your detentions and Ravenclaw will lose 70 points. Go now, and you better hope I don't find out that you did this again to Mr. Malfoy or any other student or I won't be so nice. Flitwick."- Draco couldn't see it, but he could imagine Headmistress McGonagall nodding at professor Flitwick.
people's emotions, allowing him to make deeper connections with them and making his treatments more successful. And Harry Bloody Potter was in a hella ton of pain.
After having a nightmare including Sirius' death, Harry took his Invisibility Cloak and walked through the castle. He ended up in the Astronomy Tower, and found himself being pleasantly surprised when he saw Draco was there too.
-“It’s called Vem Kan Segla Förutan Vind. It’s a Swedish folk song. I don’t know Swedish but I know Norwegian so..close enough. Mother used to sing it to me when I was a kid.”- Draco said.
-"I apologise for my lack of manners and for the way I wrote to you."- Draco said with a raspy voice. Harry had to let go of his fork, afraid that he might break it because of his grip.
He found himself in the prefect’s bathroom alone, fighting not to do with his skin what he did when he lived with the Dursley’s.
Draco took his chance and hexed the werewolves and smugglers that were restraining Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
-“I haven’t finished packing. Go ahead, I’ll join you in a bit.”- Ron glanced at Draco but nodded nevertheless, running to the Great Hall.
Draco, Harry realised, was a quiet person by nature. Everything he said was said softly or whispered. That is when he wasn't sneering or looking for a fight with Lucius, of course. This was the
And then, it had all become slightly better. Though Harry was still suspicious, he gave Draco the benefit of the doubt.
-“You know, golden trio with ex-death eater.”- He said gesturing at Harry and then at himself with his hands.
-“Follow me and be quiet.”- Harry nodded, -“Someone used an unforgivable on him, causing him to lose control of his magic. He blasted off the boy’s bathroom on the second floor wandless.”- She explained.
-"So yeah. No one but Blaise and Pansy know, so I'd appreciate if you could keep this to yourself."- Draco said. Harry nodded understandingly.
-“It’s part of his probation. He’s not allowed to use his wand neither outside of Hogwarts, nor inside of it. Only during class and he has to be supervised.”- Luna explained,
Everyone's emotions were too much for him to deal with all at once. They all felt blurry and it made Draco dizzy.
Harry discovered that Draco was at the Astronomy Tower every night. Harry went there at least three times a week because of his nightmares, and Draco always held him quietly, comforting Harry as best as he could. Draco didn't treat him differently in the mornings or even mentioned it, but he stopped ignoring Harry.
Never in his years of being a Mind Healer had he ever felt this way. At most, he felt a sadness that made him incapable of double-shifting, but never something that physically hurt him.
-“He forced himself in me. A few older Slytherins started doing it as well, and since I was so tired of everything and didn’t really stop them, they did as they pleased. Blaise and Pansy discovered it once and went bollocks! You should’ve seen them hexing the life out of everyone who got too close to me.”- Draco chuckled, but then frowned,
-"Fine then."- He grabbed Draco's mechanical hand and guided him to the Slytherin table, much to everyone's surprise.
Harry was getting dangerously close and Draco couldn't think properly. He was feeling too much. Both, Harry's emotions and his own.
Draco didn’t flinched or moved away. No more words were exchanged, nor were they needed. They simply enjoyed each other’s company in silence, watching the moonlight.
"I know, I'm sorry", he said, he was later than usual today and although Draco rarely made a fuss about it, it put him in a bad mood when he promised up and down to be home at a certain time and was terribly late though. He came over to him and pecked his lips, "Paperwork and I got carried away in a conversation with Ron."
His little brother Sirius Neville sat on Scorpius’ trunks and hit the heels of his feet against them, Draco was holding Lily Luna on his arm.
Harry found Draco in the living room. He noticed that the furniture was rearranged yet again, the walls were lighter and cleaner, and the carpet was white and looked very fluffy. Perfect for sex in front of the fireplace.
Harry smiled and lay down on the dusty ground as well, he pulled Draco in his arms, where he could calm down while listening to Harry's steady, ongoing heartbeat, never to be stopped by evil.
"You really do look sad for months now. And before that, you were almost unusually happy and barely had any time for us... don’t you think it's time to tell us what's going on?"
Harry forgot how to breathe for a second. The first two times they hooked up he was pissed, now they were both stone-cold sober and Malfoy still wanted to bang? He only came here for that, even?
"Better not let the Prophet hear that one, they're gonna quote it for ages.", Harry mumbled and snatched the baby back from his best friend.
"See, and I'm not going through 9 months of this hellish pregnancy just for our son to die out of recklessness, because he feels like killing a giant snake when he is 12."
"Just let me talk to him. Pansy, please, I didn't know he was being serious, okay? I didn't know it was possible!"
Draco wasn't Harry's boyfriend in any official way. They behaved like boyfriends, they were exclusive, as far as Harry knew. He would consider them being in a relationship, but he had never gotten around to actually asking Draco whether they were a couple. He figured, if they weren't a couple, Draco wouldn't take the liberty to take over the design of the house and Harry wouldn't only not mind it but also appreciate it. Harry even made space for Draco’s things in his closet, Draco had reacted rather surprised at this and then kissed him happily and gave him a blowjob in the middle of the room - he had never done this before.
Harry was busy trying to match the letters Pansy had written down for him with the names of the streets they were passing. Finally, he stopped his two friends, they stood in front of a house in a cream colour that fit neatly into the row of townhouses.
"It's tradition, Potter. Our baby will be the last male descent of the houses Malfoy and Black. You already ruined the pureblood status of these houses with your stupid sperm, don't take the naming traditions away from us too."
"Trixie!", she called, and the house-elf appeared next to her, "Show Mr Potter upstairs and ask Draco if he wants to see them. The other two will accompany me to the drawing-room for tea."
“What?”, Harry asked confused and then already heard several sounds of people falling and crashing into each other, cursing and complaining.
Hermione couldn't help herself and started snickering when she saw Harry's face, she had to legit laugh out loud. The rest of the Weasleys got the reference too and even Draco chuckled.
There also was Lucius' face, stiff and strict. Since he received the news of his passing, Draco felt relieved. But he still wasn't free.
"That that's your bogart.", Harry cleared his throat, "I thought it would be your dad, to be honest."
Draco smiled, "Though the 'feeling' I had for you was primarily horniness after seeing you defeating that dragon."
"That he's depressed because of some girl. Heartbroken. Now they start saying he was maybe hexed. That he looks like a dementor took all of his happiness."
"I want to be in a proper relationship with you and be a family with our baby. Don't you want that, too?"
Ron, who just took a sip from his butterbeer, was suddenly spitting his beer back out in a mix of shock and amusement.
“Sometimes I worry about you, dear”, Draco said but smiled, he kissed Harry’s cheek, “Do you want to hold Lilly for comfort?”
Draco shrugged, "You almost landed Slytherin yourself. Also, it's not a bad house, it's the house of the ambitious and cunning. While Gryffindors just throw themselves into every danger they see as if Death just wasn't an option."
Draco didn't mind it as much as Harry had suspected a Malfoy Slytherin to mind. He was free to enter and leave Grimmauld place and he took the time to rearrange Harry's furniture and discuss the ugly interior of the house with Kreacher, who wouldn't let him change anything (and changed it back when Draco was gone) because it was as his dear Mistress had wanted it.
When Draco unpacked his green sweater with the letter D on it, he tried to play his happiness down just a bit, but the big smile on his face and the look on his eyes when he thanked her told very obviously how much he loved it.
Draco started smiling down at him, "When I'm not busy cursing you and your entire bloodline, I'm in love with you, too."
Since Harry had to work long and hard hours, this was taking ages. Draco wished he would hurry up, but Hermoine had explained long and in-depth that this was about emotions and feelings deeper and sadder than Harry would ever be able to explain to him. He was saying goodbye to one part of his life and starting the next and it was hard for him. So Draco let him take his time.
"I love you too", Draco said and kissed him softly, "But we let Kreacher here, right? I don't want him to keep hiding my things."
Harry nodded, "I'm in love with you and I miss you like crazy. Please come back to England with me."
But soon after he had come to hate it. It all screamed pure-blood culture. The family tree was like a mirror for his inherited bigotry and madness.
Harry held Dracos hand, while they were listening to the lost HIM record. Harry had forced Kreacher to hand it back.
Ron and Hermione insisted on coming with Harry to France. Just in case, Narcissa really tried to hex Harry.
Harry stepped back and almost stumbled over something, Narcissa was boring the tip of her wand into his chest.
"I love you", Harry said and ran his finger along Draco's cheekbone, "And it will get better. Soon we move out of this place and I promise the new house will be bogart and memory free."
But things have changed since then. The war was won. Harry was an Auror. He had since then started and ended a proper relationship with Ginny Weasley (they ended things on a happy note, agreeing that Harry was more like a brother to her like he was to all her brothers, and a son to Molly and Arthur).
"It's the laugh", Draco said quietly, "The words were horrible, then and today, still. But it's the laugh... from all my bad memories, and I have plenty, him announcing your death is the worst. Worst moment of my life and he just laughed so... triumphantly, wicked."
Draco smiled and decided, he could very well just tell him the truth about what used to be a secret he sp desperately had tried to keep.
Harry wanted to move back to Godric's Hollow, into his parents' old house. He had expected Draco to be against it, but Draco felt increasingly uncomfortable in the house at Grimmauld Place.
Harry looked at her. She was right. Also, they had a good, solid relationship, maybe they had advice.
"Be fair, I made them before your first task. Afterwards, I had to keep up appearances. Also, back then I just wanted to snog you, not marry you, so why would I give up on the badges, they were fun."
One evening, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat together in a pub after a long day at the ministry. Ron and Hermione eventually left, and Harry stayed behind to finish his drink and pay their bill. When he eventually got up from the table to leave, he bumped right into another person - Malfoy.
"And he's sorry for that. Really, genuinely sorry. He reflected a lot about pure-blood values since then, he took his NEWTs in Muggle Studies for Merlin's sake. Also, he was 12."
There was his mother, holding her chin high, glancing down at him. It instilled guilt deep within him. He hadn't spoken to her in two years, answered none of her letters that she had been sending since his father's death.
Harry scoffed, shook his head and then simply opened the door and went in. Trixie yelped in her high voice and tried to pull him back out of the room, but Harry simply picked her up, put her in front of the door with a "Sorry" and the closed the door from inside.
Harry has never been to Paris. He was sure, it was a beautiful city, he could see that from just the few streets they walked through, but he had no mind for the beauty now. Hermione was giving out random information about the history and architecture of the place.
He could remember how Lucius hat hit him with his snake walking stick, for coming out as gay in his 4th year, for not killing Dumbledore, for not telling him the disfigured boy at the manor was Harry although he knew it for sure. Even after their trial, after they've been pardoned (with not only a little help from Harry) Lucius had hit him for throwing his wand to Potter in the last battle.
Harry bit his lip "I get to that part later... anyway, everything was going great. Until... six months ago we had a fight and since then he refuses to talk to me. Doesn't answer my letter, sends them back unopened even, doesn’t want to see me or even talk to me at the door...", he sighed, "It's horrible. And I miss him terribly."
“But cheering your team on in also very important. Well, you always loved helping your papa with his potions since you were a baby, so if that’s your passion I’m sure you gonna go at it with the same determination and fun we put into Quidditch.”
"Okay. I told you I'm bi a while ago, so... there's this guy.", he started, his friends looked at him encouraging, "We kinda hooked up a couple of times and then... I don’t know, I'd say we were together, but no one knew about it. So, it wasn't official... maybe we weren't really together at all, it's hard to tell, we never talked about this stuff", Harry scratched the back of his head.
While Ron was chuckling about himself, Harry stared at both of them and then gulped down the rest of his drink.
He was in love with Draco Malfoy and the git refused to talk to him even when he wrote a letter begging him for forgiveness. Another letter that just came back unopened.
"Could you help me out of this chair?", Draco mumbled when Harry pulled back from the kiss. He took Draco's hands and pulled him up and against him.
"I didn’t know you had a house-elf", Malfoys voice appeared in the living room a minute later. Harry sat up surprised.
It turned out that Draco didn't work any regular work, he sometimes brewed potions for people but mostly he was at the flat he shared with Pansy and tried new potion recipes and studied dark artefacts. This gave him a great deal of flexibility timewise, which Harry appreciated a lot since his job sometimes called him away at ungodly hours and made him be constantly late.
“And if someone bothers you, just owl us their full name, and we’ll give their parents a visit. Also, you are the son of the man who saved the wizarding world, use it to your advantage If you can.”, Draco said.
If possible, Draco paled even more. He looked away nervously, shoved a hand in his pocket and quickly pulled out his wand.
Hermione and Ginny shared a curious glance, before Hermione sat down on the carpet as well, lending comfort. Even Ron gave Harry a worried look.
He turned to Potter and grabbed his arm suddenly. "Do you also think my father is still working for the Dark Lord?"
Once again, they were having breakfast in the library and once again, Harry couldn't keep his eyes off Draco and how the sunlight bounced off his hair.
A vein above Ron’s eyebrow twitched as he walked towards Hartsman’s cubicle. “I’m going with Malfoy, Hartsman, because I’ve never heard of Harry having a cat.” Also, because it gave him an excuse to pick a fight with Malfoy.
but they were really just scratches. If he was in any other relatives’ place, he’d have made a big scene and cried his heart out, if only to get the adults to buy him whatever he wanted so that he wouldn’t tattle to his parents that they hadn’t taken care of him well.
And that’s how they spend the rest of the morning. When Draco’s gone, Harry writes a letter for Hermione. He tells her that she’ll be proud of the fact that he’s been studying. He also tells her, for the first time, that Draco Malfoy is out of Azkaban and that Harry’s been looking after him.
It hurts, to see Draco Malfoy so defeated. Once upon a time, Harry thinks he would have relished seeing Draco like this, atoning for everything that he did.
"You should tell them you like blokes," Ginny said helpfully. "I think the blokes are less likely to molest you."
“You did nothing wrong,” he says firmly. He thinks of Draco, Narcissa, and Severus Snape. “Slytherins are some of the bravest people I know.”
In one of the many rooms in Grimmauld Place, Harry found a pencil. It was a peculiar thing to find in a magical household. Ever since he left the Dursleys, all he had been writing with were quills that required re-inking every few scratches. Finding a pencil was very strange indeed.
"– You'd still owe me and I can still blackmail you into doing whatever I see fit. It's a win-win situation."
Did he finally go berserk at the sight of human blood? Finally realized he couldn't stop his vampiric urges, never mind that Draco had just been bitten by a huge-ass snake? And where was Potter anyway?
And tonight he's cooking Draco's favorites: slow cooked roast beef and gamberi e olio d'oliva, pasta tossed in a blend of sun-dried tomatoes and sauteed shrimps. It’s a bit heavy for breakfast, but Harry has a feeling they’ll get out of bed pretty late in the morning anyway.
A few feet away, Ron muttered sulkily to his girlfriend. "So you two've been planning this all along?"
“To the Minister’s Office,” he muttered once he entered the lift, which dutifully and swiftly moved into action even before he had finished speaking.
Madame Pomfrey regarded him carefully. "Would you have wanted us to take it from you while you were asleep?"
Fleur Delacour was the one overflowing with cavity-inducing sweetness. She had taken it upon herself to croon over him, saying how it must be hard on him to take part in such a dangerous tournament at his age and at how terribly unfair everyone was being, treating him like a monster. "They've made up all zorts of stories about vampires and Veelas, it's terrible! Vhy, my Auntie Fres was a Veela who married a vampire, and their romance is one of the zweetest I have ever known! Vampires are very loyal, you know, if not a wee bit uptight." She flashed him a sweet smile.
Beside him were the other Champions, illuminated by lights and the shine of the moon. They were all looking at Bagman, listening intently with firm determination and hard resolve. Harry looked behind him.
The dragon crashed into the bridge with a deafening howl. Harry quickly rounded the castle, weaving through towers and courtyards to find the shortest way back to the arena.
Harry didn't know how he managed to break free from the ropes, he just knew that he was running towards Draco –
Harry wanted to say, but Severus waved his response away with a hand. "I am furious at Albus and Minerva for putting me to sleep without my consent. And I
There were two sets of memories in his head, one Before the Time Turner, one After, both of them attacking him all at once and it was like having had two minds in one body, but that wasn't how it was supposed to be, it wasn't natural, so his body decided to rip them apart,
Another week later, they went to the Room of Requirement, but The Room of Hidden Things was no more. They tried, multiple times, to get it to appear. If not the room itself in its former glory, then at least its charred remains. But either the doors didn’t appear or the room itself was a totally different room from what they had asked.
Harry recalls what it feels like. The sinking feeling of dread and death, all the warmth seeping out from his fingertips, as if the blood in his veins is slowly turning to ice. He holds his breath, scared to ask. “Did they…”
Harry frowned. Sighing, he told himself to abandon caution and gingerly took the seat next to Draco.
Draco closed his eyes and let his exhaustion and Potter’s even breathing lull him to sleep once again.
Harry scrunched his nose up, but a laugh was on his lips even when he raised a hand to wipe at his forehead.
He made it. He was in front of the Triwizard Cup with Cedric Diggory, ready to hold it together for a Hogwarts win. It had been a grueling hour. Or was it two hours now? In that span of time, Harry had entered an odd mist, been hanged upside down, heard Fleur scream, shot an Impediment Jinx on a Blast-Ended Skrewt, answered a Sphinx's riddle, Stupefied Viktor Krum who had horrifyingly cast an Unforgivable on Cedric (They were going to have to talk to Professor Dumbledore about this one.), and defeated a giant spider.
“No, it doesn’t,” Draco agreed with a dejected sigh. Then, he immediately perked up again. “Well? What vampire abilities do you have?”
“You always come for the pancakes,” Draco replies, getting his fork and reaching over the table towards the serving plate. His nose scrunches up at the sight of the puddle of syrup on Harry’s plate.
And it’s getting heavier now, as his surroundings were starting to become more and more familiar with each step he took. He hadn’t been in the Forest of Dean since they destroyed the locket, but he still knew that tree. And that clearing. That had been where they had made camp. Where the locket slowly ate at them and their fears, where Ron, with bloodshot eyes and an unfamiliar snarl on his lips, had stormed away after accusing them of things best forgotten.
The words, coupled with the casual mention of Severus, sent claws of shame down Draco’s heart. It dampened his mood immediately, to see the caricature of the man he had done so wrongly look upon him with joy.
Harry recited in the middle of the common room as the fourth years huddled together in front of the fireplace.
“Well, well, I’m impressed, Harry,” Draco said two more hours later as they landed on the balcony of Harry’s room. Both of their hairs were windblown and their cheeks were flushed, bitten by the wind. Draco collapsed on one of the chairs and leaned his broomstick on the edge of the balcony. A smug smirk was on his lips. “I’ve never met anyone who could match my speed.”
Harry's throat constricted painfully. He wasn't sure if it was at the thought of Pansy and Draco being
The name startled Harry enough for him to give a smile. “Are you sure you want those to be your last words?”
Harry smiled sadly to himself. He was aware that Remus knew, out of anyone else, what 'a lot of people out there' were capable of when faced with something they couldn't comprehend. In this case, a werewolf or a… vampire.
Lupin’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion, no doubt wondering about specificity of Snape’s instructions. “Why…?”
Ron only brought him food during breakfast and dinner so when lunch rolled around, Harry found himself sitting quietly in the library, a Potions book in front of him, listening to Draco's soft breathing beside him and just reveling in that feeling of simple contentment.
Remus released the breath that he hadn’t realized he was holding. Relief flooded through his whole system so unexpectedly that his eyes started to get warm. He had long since forgotten what acceptance felt like. He only ever got it from Sirius now but it was different to get it from someone whom you haven’t known for decades.
“I’m not going to do it,” he said, the words slipping easily off his tongue, but Malfoy’s glare intensified.
“Something that Astoria said disturbs me. She said she thought I might not have wanted to talk to her, just because she’s a Slytherin,” he starts, re-imagining that particular memory.
"Are you sure you didn't put your name in the Goblet of Fire, Harry?" At least Dumbledore was being nice about it.
It was awkward. They weren't the hugging type of family. Draco couldn't remember the last time he hugged his father, but he hugged him now, still terrified at the what ifs and the what could have beens.
As soon as she left, Draco turned to his father. He glanced back at Severus and Dumbledore, not sure about the things that he was allowed to ask in their presence. He opted for the safest one: "What happened?"
“No, I mean—” Potter shook his head, closing his eyes. “I’m not sure… if we’ll be able to destroy the magic.”
Theodore made a face. "Well, it's a good thing you didn't. I'm not really interested in death defying games."
"But Fudge will just also turn on you. He might even use it against Dumbledore, say that he's brainwashing his students in Hogwarts," Draco finished for him.
And so, Draco found himself quite unready for the uncomfortable memories that were bringing themselves up to the surface the longer they stood in front of the bathroom door.
“I don’t use it to look for him!” Harry defends, blushing furiously, but he immediately knows that it’s a pathetic lie. Ron and Hermione’s eyebrows are both raised. “Not
One glance over his shoulder has him looking into Narcissa Malfoy's blank expression. She shakes her head, a minute tilt to the side, before returning her gaze to her son.
And it’s easy to think that, isn’t it? It’s easy to close that chapter. When you weren’t one of those horcruxes. Or aren’t.
It makes him uncomfortable, the way Potter makes sure to greet him every time they pass by each other in the halls.
And so they continued, trading hisses back and forth, until they found the exact step, the exact spot.
Harry dissolved into chuckles again before a certain bit of detail caught his attention. “Draco’s mother is your
During Potions, Harry sat next to Draco. It may have been because he liked being close to Draco or because it was the only seat left.
Harry climbed up towards his dorm room soon after, wishing he could talk to Severus to calm himself down. Or maybe sleep in the same room. Just like when he was younger, whenever he would have nightmares about going back to the Dursleys. But he was older now, and he knew that the man would never allow a student to sleep in his quarters, not even if that student was his charge.
With a sigh, Draco stepped off the lift and into the quiet hallway that led into the Minister’s Office. Right before the double doors, Rosmerta Burke greeted him with a smile from behind her desk and behind the numerous pieces of parchment floating around her.
Convinced that the two boys were going to be just fine for the next few hours, Snape left for his laboratory with a light heart.
And, speak of the devil, the doors to the Minister’s Office burst open, magic just barely keeping it from bouncing off the wall on one side and off Rosmerta’s desk on the other. Harry Potter, still in his Auror’s robes, stomped out, eyebrows furrowed, and lips curled down into an obviously dissatisfied line.
The figure was heaving now, taking in ragged gasps of breath in between sobs, and then Harry heard footsteps… Coming closer…
Harry almost squinted against how bright she was glowing. People like her still do exist in this wizarding world. He wished Fleur wouldn't get herself badly hurt out there.
Hermione's eyebrow remained lifted, a reminder that the only reason why she has stopped nagging him about forgoing his manly pride and going on his hands and knees to beg Ginny for mercy was his assurance that his grades would not suffer because of his condition.
“Head-Healing Draught for Victims of Crucio,” Draco repeated patiently. “The normal draughts don’t work as fast as I want them to.”
Harry’s nose had scrunched up. “That’d be weird,” he had replied, to which Sirius – who had been sitting in on their ‘class’ that day – guffawed loudly at.
At this, Dumbledore sobered. “Yes, I expected as much, and I believe there’s a lot more things that he doesn’t know.”
Before Harry could say anything, Malfoy had already shifted his wand to his left hand, swung it, and said, “
"You passed out. Harry drank your blood and was righted in no time." Severus paused, making sure that Draco turned to look at him in question, before saying, "You did a very brave thing, Draco."
Harry laughed shortly. “Thanks, Sirius, Remus. For all my new stuff and I had a really, really great time,” he said earnestly, hoping that his smile was big enough to convey his gratitude.
, Harry forgot himself and dashed forward to throw his arms around Severus’ waist, bury his face in Severus’ robes, and
The man in black had fetched Harry from his room – His room. His own room! He didn’t have to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs anymore! – the next morning and walked with him towards a big, dining hall that was so tall and so wide that Harry thought it was funny that the long table in the middle of the room only occupied such a small space.
Theodore just smirked smugly at the side every time. "If we'd have known that it would only take defeating a dragon to get these idiots to suck up to you, I'd have arranged for it a long time ago."
Just like that, Harry felt embarrassment washing over him again. He grabbed a jar and scrubbed it with gusto. "I'm not interested."
Does anyone even survive after fighting the Dark Lord? Potter did. They didn't really fight, but that was something, right? There was a chance…
Seeming to understand that he’s not going to get a straight answer, Draco looks away. “Dreadful. My back hurts.”
Ron, out of the habit that he had grown to have the past few days, looked around for Malfoy but was confused when he didn't find him.
, was Harry's first thought two minutes later as he lay sprawled on the ground of the Quidditch pitch. His second thought was
The crowd erupted in cheer. A few boos came from the Slytherins, which was more obligatory than because of their actual dislike for the Hufflepuff.
Two minutes later, an ecstatic bundle of ginger hair bounced down the stairs to the Girls' Dormitories and shot straight for Harry, enveloping him in his second big hug.
“Mm-hmm. Yes, you did,” Draco replied helpfully, looking down at Harry with amusement on his face. He raised his arms up above him to stretch them, and Harry sat still, unable to resist being awed by the grace of Draco’s movements.
He wasn't even aware that a tear had fallen down his cheek unsuspectingly until he tasted it and he summoned all his strength and frustration and punched Harry –
The rest of the summer passed by. They celebrated Potter's birthday at the end of July, and went for a quick shopping spree with Severus in Diagon Alley for new supplies in the middle of August to avoid the rush. They took the chance to go to the Post Office and Owl long overdue letters to their friends.
. Without being talked to first! And he was actually going back to his former self, insults and all! Well, he still talked below his normal volume, but it was still an improvement.
Harry slams his fist on the railing. The clang of metal rings loudly in the valley, and the bridge shakes with the force of his fist. There is the sound of blood rushing in his ears and he is light-headed with anger, at Draco for being such a dick, and at himself for still being so affected by him.
"No more, I believe. His blood levels seem to be normal, but I will need to monitor it for the next three days. Too much of the Potion is also dangerous."
And he knows, with the way Potter’s tense shoulders slowly relax and the furrow in his eyebrows ease, that Potter understands the trust and humility that he’s giving in that single act of telling.
wondered why his skill to talk to serpents hadn’t disappeared with Voldemort, but he supposed now he had his answer.
And it was in Lucius' hesitation and Narcissa's thinly-pressed lips that Draco realized. Why Draco was staying in that Unplottable place. Why they had to meet in Hogwarts and not in Malfoy Manor instead.
Draco Malfoy was a smart man. Harry could see the moment when the confusion gave way to realization and then—
They were older now—still young, but older. And there was a certain maturity that survivors of the war learned and could only share with each other. A maturity that came heavy after being forced to face the knowledge of your mortality.
Draco was confused. He was all-out staring at Potter now, at the way he was stubbornly keeping his eyes on the table. It was a peculiar sight. Harry Potter usually stood tall and confident, even when he was trying to be goofy. This Potter was… shrinking in on himself.
Snape valiantly tried to keep his lip from curling in disgust lest he send the wrong message to the boy. The drawings were very nice for a seven-year-old though. They were rather realistic, only a bit rough on the edges, and one can see the parts in the drawing when Harry had pressed the pencil too deeply. However, they all looked suspiciously like…
He had apparated to Little Whinging shortly after that, livid and fingers cold with fury. He had planned to stalk right up to the front door, knock, and launch into a ten-minute speech as to why they should hand over the accursed boy to him, but when Petunia Dursley opened the door, all he could do was stare.
Nervously, he walked nearer and saw that Draco had a book open in front of him. He reckoned that the blond wasn't actually reading though. When he got closer, Draco's shoulders visibly tensed.
Often times, Draco would still hear loud thumps upstairs. He never did see the dog that Severus had talked about, but he hated animals anyway, so he didn't really look for it.
"Yes, and for the best. You were in a dire state when Lucius brought you here," Dumbledore said gravely. "The students have all gone home for their summer holidays. You will also be able to leave in a few days, when Poppy will allow it."
Madame Pomfrey made a loud, disapproving sound. She looked so very upset and angry. "Merlin, children these days – I ought to –" she quickly cut herself off, taking a deep breath. "Sit down, Draco. I'll get a potion for you in a bit."
It was probably his crying – a big man crying and sobbing his heart out – that prevented Harry from flinching away from the sudden touch.
He chanced a look at the man and saw the shocked face quickly followed by the scary face, but when the man didn’t clock him or even raise a finger, he slowly put his hands down.
Harry looked at Draco's unblemished skin a little bit smugly, a little bit longingly. He caressed it gently with his thumb. 'It's gone,' he mouthed.
“Just one more thing. How are you, Draco?” Kingsley asked, slipping into a more casual tone. He looked genuinely concerned, which Draco honestly felt was more than he deserved. “No ill and lasting effects?”
He thought about Snape, too. He thought about Snape being the most cold-hearted professor that Hogwarts has ever seen and about Snape not being so cold-hearted after all. He thought about all the times he had been angry at the man, and all the times that he had been saved by him. They weren't the best of friends, that was for sure, but…
"No," Potter shook his head, still chuckling. "No, sorry. I just… Deja vu." Then, he looked down, smiled a small smile, before shaking his head again. He looked back at Draco. "Severus says you saved me."
"Gorgeous, isn't he?" Harry murmured, a soft grin curling his lips upwards in spite of himself as he tilted the picture towards the cat.
had Draco alarmed. He didn’t just spend the past few weeks using up all of his physical, cognitive, and emotional reserves for this, only to be cast off the mission. “What do you mean?”
had expected Draco to ask for a way out. “We are grateful, Draco. I understand this is not an easy mission, nor will it get easier.” He sighed again, and looked at Draco earnestly. “Thank you.”
"I'll stop them. Go and get that blasted Jinx off you, Potter!" she yelled over the wind, and then she was gone and Harry flew for his life.
Draco frowned at him right back. He understood the stress on his body part, he really didn’t need Mrs. Pomfrey to know that, but couldn’t quite wrap his head around the thought of the Ministry being concerned for his well-being. Or when Potter said
Kreacher called him for lunch. Lunch was roast beef, mashed potatoes, and steak-and-kidney pies. Kreacher did everything for him: pulled up his chair, served him food, filled his goblet. Much like his House Elves back in Malfoy Manor.
As quickly and as quietly as he could, Draco scrambled up to his feet and followed him, making sure to stay at least ten footsteps behind him. He was right to have cast muffling charms on his shoes earlier.
Draco looks at the trunk, and then at him in exasperation. “Well, don’t start getting shy on my things now, Potter. Go on. Merlin knows you need all the help you can get.”
He doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know if Malfoy remembers he’s there, doesn’t think that Malfoy will welcome a hug. Not from him.
It occurred to him to run after Draco, but the boy had already turned the corner and was nowhere to be seen and Harry thought that he really needed his Self-Erasing Parchment.
The cat gave a high-pitched meow and quickly leaped away to run for cover as the top drawer was pulled open and slid off its loose hinges, ultimately ending up clattering to the floor along with its contents.
In that situation, why would he…" He trailed off, frustrated. He racked his brain for everything he knew about vampires. "Was it because he couldn't help it? I mean, I was… I was bleeding a lot…" He stopped, not wanting to imagine it again.
But he wipes the syrup off of Draco’s mouth anyway, and his arm, and then searches for his wand in his pocket to charm Draco’s clothes clean.
Harry’s eyes widens, waving his hands, the denial immediately on his lips. “Oh, no! No, no, no. It’s fine, Gin, I’m not avoiding you, if that’s what you’re thinking. That’s not it at all.”
Severus saw that Draco understood. "If he wanted to kill you, he already would have. But he used Nagini instead, whose venom petrifies its enemies."
"My father told me about it when I visited Hogwarts. That Fudge's probably pretending that he's got everything under control." Then, a certain detail caught his attention. "You've been reading the Daily Prophet? How does the Daily Prophet get delivered here?"
After his parents had left, he had rushed to the dorms, burst into Potter's room, and opened his chest. As he expected, the Invisibility Cloak lay inside all folded and pretty.
Harry rolled his eyes and ignored the memories of scrubbing the garden tools clean under the heat of the sun and his burning skin. "You're a prat, you know that?" he said, but his words carried no heat. In fact, he even found himself smiling in exasperated amusement.
As for him, he spent the hours away in front of the fireplace, biting his nails, pacing, keeping his hands from trembling. He was
to know everything. Whether because that was just how these missions went or because he was still a Death Eater, no matter what his records might say, he didn’t know, but he accepted that.
Potter actually had the nerve to skip their flying time together. Just had Kreacher pop up in Draco's room to tell him without even having the courage to say it himself. Kreacher had muttered something about filthy blood, but Draco waved it off as those moments that Kreacher would go into those fits of his and start sounding like Walburga Black.
Draco carried on as if it was a normal occurrence for Harry Potter to choke on his own saliva. "Drinks. You. Me. We need to have a heart to heart talk."
Draco realized, as he looked at Potter's hunched shoulders and wounded expression. Now it all made sense. Potter was surprisingly sensitive about this. Draco didn't know what to do with this information.
At that moment, the Floo blared to life with green flames and out came Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.
When Harry turned back, gone were the anger and fury that once held Draco's shoulders stiff. What replaced them were shock and bewilderment.
He was thrown against the floor, and he yelped in pain as he made contact with the wood, but could only stare in shock at Severus' panting figure standing over him.
He accelerated into the air, towards the castle, ignoring the screeching cries of rage from behind him. The dragon was fast, Harry realized with his heart thumping in his chest. Fast for a 15-foot and some thousand pounds dragon.
Snape had prepared for it, cakes and gifts and balloons and all. In fact, he may have overdone it. He didn’t know how children’s birthdays went. His own last one had been filled with fake smiles and strangers who either pinched his cheeks or looked disapprovingly at him.
Harry motioned towards the wand and tried to smile, to show that he was giving it back with no hard feelings and no strings attached.
“Of course,” Draco replied, before a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes and he smirked at Harry. “Among other things.”
Draco’s mind is still befuddled, and he thinks it shows on his face, because Potter’s smile becomes fond, and it’s
“You’re… trying,” Draco echoed. Potter’s words were confusing. Granted, this was the first time Potter had been forthright about the mission’s details that Draco didn’t urgently need at the moment, but his words seemed like he was going about this… on his own. “Have you perhaps talked to Weasley and Granger about this?”
with Theodore, the one where he admitted that his godfather was suspected murderer and Death Eater Sirius Black, who lived with werewolf Remus Lupin. Theodore may be his best friend, but it was still a lot to risk.
Maybe it was the incredulity of spending time alone with him again like before, Before the Time Turner. Like… like friends.
Draco clears his throat loudly. He hopes the dark is doing its job covering his burning face. “Alright, so you didn’t see me in the Map, and assumed that I was in the Forest?”
The only ones left to inherit the house now was his mother and… him. Unless Bellatrix Lestrange and Sirius Black miraculously escaped Azkaban.
He found himself in the Slytherin Common Room, desperate for some familiarity and comfort. He half hoped that Potter would be there, but to his disappointment, only the empty couches greeted him when he entered.
Potter didn’t reply, and the lack of fight extinguished all of Draco’s willpower to continue the argument. “Sod off it, Potter. It happened. It’s done. I’m alive, and we learned something valuable that you can report to your merry team.”
Six-year-old Harry Potter figured there was something weird about the man in black. He didn’t make Harry weed the garden or sleep in the cupboard or wash the dishes or clean the floor. He gave Harry
Draco flashed him a mischievous smile. "I exist to make your life harder, Potter, don't you know that?"
Theodore’s lip curled up in disgust. “This is the library, for Merlin’s sake. Can’t they keep it down?”
He had a lot of questions for his father. His parents dropped by every day to check on him and his health, but often had to go to the Headmaster's Office for whatever
However, their subjects, which were endlessly fascinating, did rather well in distracting him from morose thoughts. Harry managed to levitate a feather on the first try easily due to Remus’ teachings but struggled a bit with Transfiguration. Potions was a weird affair, with Harry trying to reconcile his image of Severus at home with the image of ‘Professor Snape’. On a few occasions, he almost called him
Severus nodded slowly at that. "The blood banks do very little," he started, carefully. "Vampires, when they reach 18, they start to… thirst for human blood, and most usually are caught unaware when this first urge occurs in them. They usually end up biting the person nearest to them at the time. I believe this started the rumors that vampires are violent creatures, which was fueled even more when Voldemort himself became one in his search for immortality."
Harry was surprised at that. He didn't think Severus and Remus were the type to frequently Owl each other, even if it was to make sure that Harry's keeping himself out of trouble. "I'm sorry I can't be of much help," he said, frowning.
“What’s for breakfast today?” Harry asks as he pushes Draco’s wheelchair up the ramp that leads into the balcony.
“I’m glad.” There’s a crinkle at the corner of Potter’s eyes when he smiles, and Draco hates it, as much as he hates the way Potter’s thumb is slowly tracing circles against his palm. There is pink colouring Potter’s cheeks and he hates that, too. “I, err, I suppose this is a good time to tell you that I don’t have exactly innocent intentions in, uhm, being friends with you.”
“You…” Potter stared at him for a few moments longer, before shaking his head with a short laugh of disbelief. “You’re supposed to be a Slytherin. What ever happened to self-preservation?”
Narcissa sighs, slow and heavy. “Summer is the host of many occasions between families and organizations of power. I have tried to be present in each and every one of them, but it’s been… difficult since Draco returned.”
"Which means that you should be thinking of what's best for your son right now, instead of being deluded that you of all people will be enough to keep Voldemort from him," Severus hit back, venom dripping from his voice.
The kiss slows down, and the movements of their tongues become lazy until they’re just repeatedly kissing each others lips, soft sighs coming out in small breaths.
"What's the first line again?" Blaise asked, elbow propped on his thigh, and his chin on his open palm. He tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully.
Draco fulfilled it without preamble, thinking of just how it was possible that Harry did not know that Draco did when Harry's the one that's basically occupied Draco's mind since first year.
“It was his fault, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly. “You and I can talk all we want about what a funny, charming person he was, but the Fiendfyre was his fault and he died because of it. Did he know better? Of course not. Did his parents teach him better?” He shoved his fork in his mouth with a frown and a dark look towards the other side of the room. As if seeing the specters of something. His own parents, perhaps?
"Harry," she said with a serious voice that made Harry dread. "Have you been doing well in your studies?"
one day during lunch when an unfamiliar owl drops an unsuspecting letter on his lap. It’s not his first time receiving hate mail, and so he’s not really surprised when he opens it and sees one line:
that Malfoy was the most practical choice for the job. Even Ron and Hermione had to begrudgingly admit that.
A sudden splash and a sharply-uttered curse behind him told him that Malfoy had tripped. Harry tried to hide his laugh.
Ron and Hermione were still sitting on the bed, having a Deep Conversation when he entered but Harry simply ran past them, grabbed his Self-Erasing Parchment, his Self-Inking Quill, and the Marauders' Map from his trunk.
Something burst out from the hedges and Harry pointed his wand, ready to attack – but it was only Cedric, frazzled and out of breath and burnt slightly at the sleeves, yammering about Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts, but he was gone as soon as he came.
“Occasions?” Harry asks, thinking of the many fancy invitations that he’s thrown in the trash in the past three months. “You mean parties?”
There is a wry, almost challenging smile on his lips, one that looks so out of place on his thin, wan face that Harry in his frustration almost wants to punch.
Viktor Krum and his shark head was the first to swim away, back in the direction they had come. Hermione Granger was safely tucked in his arms. Cedric Diggory was next, trying to swim properly while carrying Cho Chang. And Harry looked behind him, and saw the little figure of Gabrielle Delacour. Her innocent face was turned bravely upwards, believing that her sister would come for her.
In Harry's part, he didn't really have much choice in the matter since he was currently rendered mute.
"When is Potter going to show up?" Draco asked irritably during dinner. "He's going to have to stop this farce at one point, or does he plan on avoiding me for the rest of the summer?"
It was unnerving how all eyes were riveted to him then. At the Head table, he caught the eye of Severus, who nodded at him approvingly. It was a slight movement, but Harry had been with him long enough to notice it and he told himself to relax.
to spread them anymore. Harry Potter was so tight-lipped! (No pun intended.) After a quick plan-making session in the girls' bathroom, she took almost half the female student population of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with her to get to the bottom of things.
Catcalls and hoots resounded from their friends and colleagues around the room. People from the kitchen, the second floor, and the terrace outside popped their heads inside the living room, expectant grins on their faces.
He stood up from his crouching position and brushed his knees although they hardly touched the ground at all. When he took a step forward though, his foot got caught on a wayward vine and he lost his balance.
After devouring that disgustingly sweet treacle tart, Draco marched up to Severus' room. It was more of a laboratory than a room, with all the scattered parchment and bottles of dubious animal body parts lying around the room. An area of the room was even cleared to make way for a boiling cauldron.
back of his mind, there is a small voice whispering to him that it almost seems like Draco’s… jealous.
He wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment, before shoving it right under Draco's nose, above the book that he was reading.
"So the Second Task is under the Lake?" Pansy asked, pursing her lips. "And they've taken something from you."
He wasn't sure if Potter heard him from that height, but Potter slowly hovered downwards, until he jumped off his broom a few feet away from Draco.
Whatever snide thought that Harry was about to conjure in reply to that did not come to fruition as Ron replied for him, quite confusedly. "Uhm. Harry can't talk, remember?"
when Potter smiles back. He’s not supposed to say good morning to Potter, or Weasley, or Granger, or to anyone else for that matter.
Harry stumbled into his flat later well after midnight with his head hurting all over. It didn’t matter though because he was still pretty much floating in the clouds after everything that happened that day.
He quickly evaded Ginny as soon as he could by running away, which wasn't very Gryffindor but was very necessary, He didn't think he was ready to be mobbed again quite yet.
On cue, a House Elf popped up in the corner near the dresser. He looked gnarly and sour, and his nose was longer than Severus', which Draco didn't think was possible. As he saw them, his mood seemed to perk up considerably, eyes becoming round. "Young master Malfoy!" he exclaimed, breathless.
“Sorry,” Remus said, still focused on Harry’s hand that was hidden behind his back. Then, he looked at the trunk beside the boy and flushed slightly. “Oh, dear, you’ve gone and found my old school trunk, have you?”
Draco really was flirting with him, it wouldn’t do to respond in kind since he had no idea how flirting worked and would probably just embarrass himself if he tried to attempt it. If Draco wasn’t, then the same reasoning applied.
He goes about his every day, studying for tests, avoiding photographs, and laughing with friends, resolutely pretending that it doesn’t hurt.
Harry shoves pancakes in his mouth. He’s learned that Draco tries to be difficult on purpose, and the best way to deal with him when he’s being a slimy sod is to ignore that he’s being a slimy sod. He thinks he should be awarded for his discovery and canonized for his patience. “Did you have a good fucking sleep?”
It all started to catch up to him ten seconds after he realized that mermaids were chasing him. He was underwater, hauling two bodies (one was a small child,
It’s Christmas, and Harry feels the pent-up emotions well up in his chest: the guilt for being away, the longing and
Her eyes softened, the wrinkles on her face showing both her age and the concern that she still held for them. When they reached the staircase, she handed Harry an empty ink bottle. “This should lead you straight to Pomfrey. She has also already been briefed.”
Harry called for the fifth time, his voice muffled by the fact that he had his nose and lips pressed against the door to Draco’s room. He pulled back and pressed his ear next.
She leaned back, hands on her hips, and Harry finally managed to take in her appearance. Her black hair were cropped neatly just above her shoulders and she was thin and small, just like him. Her face looked… well, Harry didn’t want to be mean, but she looked like Aunt Marge’s dog.
He resolutely pushed down his self-persecution complex that reminded him that Harry was just saying that because he hasn’t been outside – doesn’t know what the Wizarding World thought of werewolves – because what else mattered but Harry accepting him?
, kiddo,” Sirius said after he had hauled all off Harry’s new things to the side of the room. He slapped Harry heartily on the back and nearly knocked his glasses off.
Harry grins. He missed this—this light, easy banter. He pulls up Draco’s chair and sits himself down comfortably.
Draco’s smiling, and the sun is bright and his hair is bright, and there’s more colour to his face now than there has been for weeks.
The Lip-Lock Jinx was a jinx that rendered the victim mute, until he or she kissed the person they desired. It was a common prank in parties, if one was desperate for either a snogging show or a slapping one. It had recently grown to be quite popular in Hogwarts, as started by the eight years. Seamus Finnigan, in particular. The professors had tried to stop it by forcing the casters to take off the spells, but most of the time, the victims themselves refused to tell who cast it on them for the sake of pride.
"If by fun, you mean I really can't wait for the Tournament to be over, then yes," Harry said, deadpan. Then, he thought about finally flying a broomstick in Hogwarts, besting a dragon, diving in the Great Lake, swimming with mermaids, dancing in the Yule Ball, having people come up to him and give him high fives… so different from the past years that he would spend trying not to stand out and others pretending that he wasn't.
“As I was saying, Draco practically sent all of us all over the train looking for you.” She looked pointedly at Harry and huffed indignantly at Draco. “Can you
Draco looked as immaculate as ever, sitting under that arched window with a book open in his hands. The sunlight bounced off white-blond hair and Harry didn't think that it was possible to fall in love again.
It was Theodore's turn to raise an eyebrow at him, but a grin played at his lips. He knew how good Harry was at Quidditch, although Merlin knows why he didn't want anyone else in Hogwarts to know. The sod didn't even try out for the Quidditch Team once, no matter how much Theodore begged him because everybody (even the Slytherins) knew that their Quidditch Team only kept on winning because of their cheap tricks.
Draco wasn't a Gryffindor. He didn't go around saving people or helping people for free. Nor did he go around giving out his blood. Twice. Most especially to vampires. But this was Potter. Vampire or not, Potter was… dare he say, his
Draco opened his eyes to Potter’s worried ones. Potter was sitting on a stool next to his bed, leaning over him. Belatedly, he took note of the night sky outside the window behind Potter’s head. “How long was I out?”
