“Sorry,” Harry says gently, standing and moving out of sight again. “Rain check?”
Draco is startled silent. That new title is going to take some getting used to.
“Me too, honestly,” Harry laughs.
“I think we’re doing a pretty good job,”
Harry softened at the sight of her terrified expression. "It's okay. Put your wand away, Drake. What is it?"
Draco shut his eyes tight. "Jenkins?"
"Draco, darling! What a lovely surprise!"
"Wow," Ron commented when they landed on the porch.
"He wouldn't."
Which Draco knows means that he absolutely won’t be cooking anything for himself. He pulls a face back. “I’m making pasta and a salad for dinner, I’ll send some through the Floo for you tonight.”
They sat in silence for a few minutes before Harry perked up, suddenly remembering.
, Harry and I aren’t anything, we haven’t ever—“
"How do you handle that?" Harry asked gently.
" Draco snaps back. "He adores me!"
“You don’t speak to your family?”
"Well, I've been reading up on them quite a lot, since—"
"My father. If I didn't marry the Greengrass girl. He threatened to...to send someone to hurt you. I spat in his face. I didn't believe he really had the resources to make that happen from Azkaban. But then you were attacked in Diagon Alley a few days later, and even though you were fine, I just couldn't...everything I said that day, when I left, it was all a lie. I was trying to protect you. But when the time came I couldn't go through with it. I couldn't marry her."

Hermione had wrapped her arms around him and let him cry.
Draco has been watching his expression throughout, quietly observing so as not to throw Harry off. The way his brow has been creased in concentration has been fascinating, but Draco decides he prefers Harry’s grin, a slight blush rising in his cheeks, pride evident in his bright eyes.
"Shut up," Harry laughs, gently knocking his hand away and hooking two fingers in Draco's waistband to tug him closer. He looks expectantly up at him. "Your turn?"
“I....”
"You're welcome. Owl us and we'll sort out all the details."
She moved sofas and took Harry's seat beside him, looking concerned. "Is he always so tired?"
Draco rolls his eyes at him and turns back to the two Ministry employees in front of them.
“Hm?”
Teddy folds his arms and sulks for the rest of the day, leaving Harry confused when he comes back with their food.
The other wolves were watching nervously from their confined enclosures, barking and whining and howling as the two wolves lunged at one another again and again.
Draco kisses him again, and Harry leans into it the second time, dropping his bag and bringing his hands up to wrap around Draco's waist as Draco slides his hands up into Harry's curls, loving, like always, the way they feel trailing through his fingers.
Ron stopped talking when he caught sight of the look on Harry's face. His stomach had dropped almost painfully at the realization:
“You’re not stepping back inside this house again for the rest of your life if I can help it,” Draco whispers back.
Time to go.
Draco read the letter again, briefly closing his eyes against the tide of emotions that threatened to overwhelm him.

"You really did it?" Draco breathed.
"Harry,

"I don't know, but we're all out. You used it all after taking that Bludger in the last Quidditch game."
Draco sobs and pulls him into a tight hug. "I love you, too."

“Oh. Er, yeah. Fine.” His hands are shaking, and Draco finds himself wanting to grab them and hold them.
"Oh yes, I read something about that in the paper. How

“Hi. Paul and Spencer invited us over for dinner, Sunday after next,” Harry says, kissing Draco in greeting before sitting beside him on the sofa.

Harry kissed him gently, still a bit hesitant even as Draco shifted to straddle him and rolled his hips down against him.

"I know," Harry had sighed, holding him close. "I know."
The Floo call ends, and Draco turns around to glare at his boyfriend. “What the hell was
"It's alright, Draco. It was the full moon last night, wasn't it? How's Harry?"
The two men Apparated away to their separate locations and were gone.
"Perfect," Draco kisses Harry's cheek. "Go change out of your robes and you can help."
As the other Eighth Year students return from dinner, Draco and Harry get a few odd looks, but no one comments until Ron Weasley enters the room and feigns utter shock and horror, clutching at his chest.

“Harry,” he stops unbuttoning his shirt to pull me into another kiss. “You didn’t do anything wrong. We weren’t together, and you were hurting...”
Harry's body went limp as he fell unconscious in Draco's arms again, his head dropping onto his shoulder.
“So it’s on his back instead,” she says brightly. “And it’s stunning. I think Harry somehow managed to lose

Andromeda stood and made her way over, stopping a few feet away. "I'm so sorry, Cissy," she said, and Narcissa's eyes widened.

Draco laughs and pulls him closer, slinging an arm over his waist. “Not even close. Goodnight, darling.”
Exhausted by the first duel, neither of them lasted long against the second onslaught.
“I know,” Ron’s sympathetic expression is back. “Just go in there and see him, alright?”
"Of course I can!" Andromeda responded equally tearfully. "You saved Harry, didn't you? Lied to Voldemort? Oh Cissy, I can't even imagine what that was like. You were so
As if on command, said blond entered the room, followed by the twins: Laith and Mathias.

another person in the room.
“Already took care of that while you were getting the bottle. Hermione is coming by in—“ Harry squints at the clock on the mantle, “—about five minutes. To pick Teddy up for a ‘surprise sleepover.’”
Half-an-hour later, Harry fucked Draco hard and fast against the wall, their fingers laced together over their heads.
Godric, George and Harry had had fun making these—Harry going on about Rita Skeeter's Animagus form and Muggle listening devices, while George tried dozens of different Spells trying to recreate the effect until they'd found one that actually worked.
Harry swallows hard. "Is that as close as you can get to saying you're sorry?"
Harry turned and glared at him. "Excuse me?"
Draco glared at him. "That's not why I'm here, Harry, and you know it. I thought we were
Harry chuckles softly and stands up to kiss him and slide the ring onto his finger. "Does that mean you have a ring for me, too?"
Draco shook his head. "No one could have talked him out of fighting Lorcan tonight, Weasley," he sighed, "you know how Harry is—he's as stubborn as a hippogriff, especially when there's a wrong to be righted."
"YEAH!" Teddy raced up the stairs.
The three of them head for the stairs and don't stop until they're outside Draco's room.
Draco.”
“Mumblemumps outbreak at the Primary School where Teddy used to go,” Harry mutters against his skin. “They flooded the clinic today.”
Slowly, he makes his way downstairs...
"Sure you were," Harry laughed, standing up and taking him by the hand. "Dance with me one more time, and then we'll go."

There was a low rumbling, and the whole building shook as if there had been an earthquake. Robards and McDougal both looked fearfully at the door, but nothing happened.

Hermione's voice echoed in Draco's mind.
"And Harry dismissed us to spend time with his pet human last night," Sofia sniffed.

Draco kisses my shoulder, running a hand down my left arm, where an elaborate sleeve depicts the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. A full moon is visible between the trees on my bicep, and a stag, a dog, and a wolf can be seen frolicking together on my forearm. “I can keep a secret. Explain this one.”
“Everyone deserves a second chance, love,” Harry says softly, turning to brush his fingers over his cheek before leaning in for a chaste, mollifying kiss. “Especially when they’ve changed.”
"Dray-co," He repeated.
What are you
"I'm not interested in your pity friendship, or whatever this is, Draco. I just want to be left alone."
Kasper sighed heavily. "I know it doesn't make sense, but that wasn't her. She wasn't in her right mind."
Harry shook his head. "No, it's alright. I'm tired, I'm going to Apparate home. I'll see you later."
Harry pulled Draco by the hand, face flushed with excitement.
Please."
"Potter," Draco says coolly, eyeing up the 'Savior of the Wizarding World' with intense dislike. Dislike that's only intensified by the vague recognition that he's extremely attractive now. Draco had seen him from a distance at the funeral, of course, and in the years since the War, and in the paper what feels like every bloody day, but this is the first time up close, and Potter is—well, he's gorgeous, and Draco hates admitting it to himself.
"Cheating bastard," Draco muttered under his breath, passing the baby over to her mother so she could buckle her into her high chair.
"So what you're saying is, you
Hermione walked over to the bed and awkwardly hugged him. "I'm sorry, Draco."
"More comfortable."
Had Harry just...? Draco resists the urge to pinch himself. "
“The dragons on the reserve reminded me of you, actually.” I force a smile. “I needed to get away, and then I didn’t want to come back, and I…I only got back a few weeks ago, and I just assumed…”
"HARRY!" Thomas ran into the room, waving a piece of parchment in the air. "Look! Mum said if I practiced writing all my letters and wrote my name properly we could go for a walk and pick raspberries on the bushes by the pond! Wanna come?"

"And I'm expected to move back into the Manor."
“You didn’t have to do all the cleaning up alone, I could have helped.”
Ron Apparated away, and Draco stepped into the room. "Are you okay?"
"Do you have any idea how hot you are? What you do to me? The
Draco’s eyes widen as they drop to the sparkling diamond ring on her finger, and she laughs.
Draco gasped, kneeling beside him.

"And that information is necessary for your report?"
to us—"
All the tension leaves Harry's body as he relaxes against Draco, and it's not long before he's drifting off again, his breathing slowing. Draco doesn't stop massaging his scalp, even after it registers that Harry has fallen asleep.

," the sound of my name snaps me back. Harry's eyes are surprisingly kind, and a little concerned. He knows where I went—his brief relationship with Charlie Weasley before me has always been a sore spot. "It wasn't like that. We didn't...nothing happened."
“Draco Malfoy.”
•••••
Exhausted, he makes his way through the crowded hallways, hoping Harry's exams went well and wondering where he might be. Too tired to think, he heads for his bed.
•••••
Robards snapped Ron's wand in half, and Ron winced before setting his face again. He didn't know what was taking Hermione so long, but if she needed more time, he would try to give it to her.
Draco gasped, lifting his head to stare at Harry. "How? With the Wolfsbane in your system you were barely coherent."
"I had good motivation," Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry again. "I couldn't do another six months away from you."
"Let me know as soon as you know anything, okay?"
"Oh! And Harry," she fetches a few more vials and holds them out. "Hydration Potions. Once a day for the next three days. They won't help with symptoms, but they should help him feel better faster."
He closed the door behind him and set the plates of food and pastries and Teddy's letter on the dining table. He caught Draco's scent even before he opened the door to the Potions Lab, and sure enough, Draco was still inside, adding what appeared to be the last ingredient to his potion. He picked up a bronze spoon and began to stir, counting turns under his breath and glancing at the hand-written notes next to the cauldron.
"Who? Ron will be busy with his new job, I don't think he—"
* * *
"Welcome," Harry smiled at them both and extended a hand, "to the Lupin-Black Werewolf Sanctuary.
"What? Really?"
, and Draco never has been one to deny him, so he starts working him open, relishing the look on his face as he comes undone beneath him.
Draco pulled her into his arms. Partly to comfort her, and partly so she wouldn't see his own expression as he asked, "how is he doing?"
"How are your Healing Spells?" Ron asked as he knelt beside him. "They teach us the basics in Auror training, but this looks bad."
"They took Harry. They took him to
Thomas shrugged again. "I dunno. Probably in her room."
Draco jerks his head up to glare at him as George laughs heartily at him. Heat rises in his cheeks and Draco knows his pale complexion has probably gone as crimson as an atrocious Gryffindor tie.
Draco's head was spinning.
"They're just flowers, Draco. It's stupid. I don't even
"No need to call me sir, son. It's Kasper. You his Mate, then?"
"Did you forget?" She'd asked softly. "What today is for Harry?"
flowers. Throw them away."
Ron flinched, then looked at her and shook his head. "Nothing, sweetheart. Sorry. Try the next one."
"Well, Christine is a healer, and Lewis is a teacher. If we could convince them... And if Nadine and the other wolves are on board we'd have even more help."
"Alright, alright," Draco concedes, a pink flush climbing his pale cheeks. "I didn't think anyone noticed those things."
"And give up the honor of dueling our precious Savior
"Mm. I fucking love you. You're the absolute
"I didn't mean it like that!" Harry protested quickly. "I just thought... I want to meet your friends, I guess. Or re-meet them. Can we invite her over?"
"I know, I'm really sorry Ron. That was completely my fault, though. Don't blame Draco because I messed up."
"No wonder your nightmares have improved," Draco teases.
“Merlin,
"Good. Let's get you some food then."

Hermione took him by the arms. "Okay, okay, breathe, Draco."
Malfoy winked and neatly dodged Harry's next nonverbal spell. "I would never."
“So then Draco says, ‘Teddy, if you don’t go to sleep now, I’m taking away your broomstick for a week.’” Harry is biting back a laugh as he finishes the story. “And Teddy says, ‘if

"Oh Harry, that's fantastic! He was so excited to have his very own room at Grimmauld Place before—" She cut herself off abruptly in horror. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean—I just know how excited he was."
Harry felt his face get even warmer. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "Well, we, er, sort of already did that. But I want to give Draco everything he's ever wanted. A Wizard's wedding, and all that. Big, fancy parties aren't really my thing, but they
Violet looks contemplative. “Well, maybe…”
Harry smiles at the words and names and initials written and carved into the wood, running his fingers over some of them.
Potter gives him another heart-stopping grin. Draco catches himself at the thought.
The Junior Aurors stared in astonishment as the cups flew to each desk, while Auror Weasley just shook his head, his amusement written across his face.
"Hello!" Ron's freckled face came into view. He kissed a bewildered looking Hermione. "Where have you two been, then?"
Draco blushed furiously. "Well, I mean, you have to know by now that I have feelings for you, Harry. It wasn't really very casual for me...you know, before."
"Far worse, I'm sure. The fact that he waited until we were vigorously snogging in bed and I was quite literally begging him to fuck me certainly didn't help."
"It's okay," Draco pulled his hood off again and took a moment to look around curiously. The room was surprisingly tidy, and there were a few personal photos and knick knacks on display that caught his attention. "Thank you for bringing me here, and um, for the chocolates the other day, too."
“It’s not like that.”
Draco kissed him again. "You're perfect. I'm getting hungry. Let's go see if those cooking lessons paid off, yeah?"
“DAD!” Teddy laughs and holds up his hands defensively as droplets of water hit him.
He stirred, opening his eyes to blink up at her.
"Yeah," Harry gave his best friend a warm smile. "Happier than I've ever been, happier than I ever thought I would get to be—and I don't just mean since I was bitten, Ron. Happier than I ever imagined I could be even before."
Draco shook his head.
Harry’s eyes are unbelievably warm as he asks. “Now?”
“Maybe,” Harry shrugs. “Teddy’s yours for a whole month in a couple weeks. You could plan a few outings for the three of you while he’s with you? Start with something easy, like a trip to the park, and go from there. Have Brandon suggest you go get ice cream after, he’ll win him over in no time.”
Harry closed his eyes tightly and fought the desire to drift back into unconsciousness again. "I don't know. I can picture it, if you can help me Apparate. Please, Drake."
And as Harry follows, hands bracketing his hips, lips pressed to the back of his neck, Draco thinks about how weird it is to be grateful for that night when Harry found him on the floor, broken more than just physically, and took him to the Hospital Wing, starting everything that has happened between them, but he is.
Harry swallows hard in response and whispers back, “thanks, Draco.” Then louder: “Thanks for these, Dudley. Bye Lottie, it was nice to meet you,” he glances up at the child peeking around the corner at the top of the staircase, “and you, Violet.”
"Da-da!" Rose shrieked happily.
"That's the idea. I'm pretty sure I spent a good portion of my last letter detailing all the things I wanted to do to you when I got home."
The older woman's eyes softened as she listened to him, her motherly expression reminding Harry of a younger Molly Weasley.
"Come in!" Healer Gordon called.
"Not without good reason, I assure you," Pansy grinned.
Draco Apparates them upstairs, abruptly cutting off Harry’s laughter at his enthusiasm.
Harry tugged on his arm. "Get back here, please."
Draco looked up at the guards again, with an expression of fury that sent a chill through each of them, although they tried not to show it. "The Wolfsbane makes him, erm, hallucinate," Curly said, "He imagines you're here a lot."
“Yeah.”
"Draco."
Harry rolled out of bed and wandlessly summoned his glasses, putting them on and padding out into the hallway and down the stairs, dodging piles of moving boxes as he went.
“Go put your broom away,” Harry tells Teddy. “And then go take a shower while I place the order. What do you want for dinner?”
"What's taking so long?" Draco complained, pacing the kitchen. "This was a bad idea. I should have gone with him. I don't trust Kasper for shit. That bastard
He breaks up with Draco the next day, and Draco feels nothing.
"You and I have nothing to discuss, Potter," Draco snaps, cutting him off.

should, I suppose," Draco conceded.
Teddy is on his own broom, beaming and looking at Harry with admiration, basking in his praise and gentle coaching. Draco’s heart warms at the sight. He leans against the door frame and watches them, unnoticed, until Harry tells Teddy they’d better get some water and go inside.
did."
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” Draco continues quickly before Harry can say anything. “It’s not my place to judge who you date, and I didn’t mean to make you feel like—”
She gave Laith's hand a squeeze before letting go and walked up the stairs, shaking her head in amusement.
They eat in companionable silence. Harry seems different this year. Still grieving, still missing the family he never had, but he also seems strangely tense.
Harry smiled gently at her. "'Mione, it's okay. I'm...I can't stay in denial about this forever. And I
“Just like every summer,” Draco winks, and Harry gives him a warm smile as he wandlessly Summons his own wand to his hand. “Only takes a few awkward moments like this to get back in the habit.”
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” Harry says when he finally pulls back. He smiles and turns away, quickly disappearing down the front steps into the dark. Draco hears the soft

Harry turns his head and quite literally drops Derek when he sees Draco. Derek is forced to throw an arm out and to catch himself awkwardly against the wall as Harry lets go of him, complaining, “

Draco sank gratefully down onto the sofa once he got home to his own flat. In some ways, his heart felt better; in others, it hurt much
"Right. Okay. I'll just. See you later, then."
"We knew nothing of the Sanctuary until we arrived here, we just knew that if anyone could protect us, it would be you."
Harry swallows. "No, I guess I was just—"
“Hi,” Harry says softly.
Well. She'd had a long day at work, then made dinner and put the baby to bed on her own. Hermione didn't begrudge her husband wanting to spend time with his best friend, especially given recent events, but
"Alright. I think it's time we all got some rest. Everyone out, please," Harry commanded blithely, eyes still locked on Draco's, "we can talk more tomorrow."
Paul is the kindest, most understanding person Draco has ever been with, and it just makes him feel worse.
"I don't care. I'll talk to Ollivander about making a house call or something. He's a...friend. Sort of."
"So, I've been thinking..."
," his human had said. The words didn't make any sense to him now as the memory surfaced, but the sentiment behind them did, and his resolve strengthened.
Harry stands and wipes at his mouth with a napkin. “Right. Well, that’s going to need sorting, isn’t it? Sorry, I’m supposed to be off on weekends, but when there’s an emergency—”
"Of course I do. I love you more than anything in this world. If you love Harry, I'm sure that I could come to love him, too."
“My hair is
“You’ve been inventing your own potions?” Hermione leans forward in her seat, eyes bright with interest. “That’s incredible! What’ve you done?”
There’s movement inside the house, and then the door creaks open and a pair of wide blue eyes peer up at them. “Hello?”
“A customer has a question, and I don’t know the answer. Can you help him?”
“Oh, good for you.” Marc couldn’t sound any less interested.
"Oh, shit."
Harry reaches out to tilt Draco's chin up,  examining his bleeding lip and blackened eye. His pained expression makes it clear that he's already surmised what has happened.
dressed for him, in the white button-down Draco gave him last year for Christmas and fitted black trousers. He has the sleeves rolled up, softening the look.
But when Draco tried to tug Harry's shirt up over his head, Harry suddenly scrambled away, clear off of the other side of bed, gasping and shaking.
Harry must have caught the expression on Draco’s face. Draco feels a rush of gratitude toward him. He sends him a smile across the room and mouths the words ‘my hero’ at him. Harry grins and winks back.
I shouldn’t be here. I just want to go home; unpack some boxes, order takeaway curry and chips, maybe listen to tonight’s Quidditch match on the radio... Anything sounds better than
"Yes," Draco widened his eyes innocently and leaned forward for another kiss. "And I'm
"Ready to go?" Ron asked.
Draco's answering smile could light up the entire Great Hall on its own as he runs the tips of his fingers down the center of Harry's chest, circling his scar from the severed horcrux. "So are you."
"Fucking hell." Harry drops his head back down.
“Fine,” Draco can’t look over at her, and he knows she can see through the lie.
She walked closer and summoned one of the chairs by the fireplace to sit in beside the bed. "I'm really sorry about Ron yesterday," she murmured.
“Oh Merlin, no, I don’t mean
Harry's answering grin had a hint of mischief in it, and Draco laughed again. "Walked into that one, didn't I?"
Harry opens his eyes and peers at him for a second. “I’m sorry,” he says softly. “I wasn’t thinking, I just acted without thinking.”
"It's shit, is what it is!" Draco interrupts, "We have N.E.W.T.s in
Harry rolled his eyes. "Feeling warmer now?"
"Gross," Ron mutters. "If you let that git distract you like that, Harry—"
"I can't do this anymore, Harry."
Harry gave her a weak smile and huffed out a laugh. "We were hoping
Rose's screaming intensified, and Harry missed most of what Hermione had said, even with his enhanced werewolf hearing.
Draco's devious smile widened. "Weasley doesn't really have plans on Saturday, does he?"
“I’m here. Weasley and Granger will be here soon, too. They’re picking up Teddy from school and taking him to the Burrow with Rose and Hugo.”
“I don’t feel much like celebrating tonight, Gin,” I sigh.

Draco nodded thoughtfully. "Okay. What if we just tried actually dating and we decide from there? I want to be with
Draco nodded again, guilt coiling painfully in his stomach. He'd held those beliefs, once. That werewolves were lesser. Abhorrent, even. But that version of himself was long gone.
“It’s not. I’m so sorry, Paul. I didn’t mean to use you, or take advantage—“
A red wolf with hazel eyes snapped at the bars of her cell, howling in fury, desperate to help.
"So this is the only classroom currently in use," Harry pointed into the classroom and Hermione and Ron peeked inside. "But we have two more prepared if we need them. At the moment Lewis is teaching the older students in the morning and younger students in the afternoon, and an adult magic class in the evenings one night a week. I'd like to get a second teacher by the end of the year, but for now Lewis claims he doesn't mind."
“Rarely,” Draco says warily. “I’m usually told I’m the spitting image of my father.”
"So, what do you...?"
to make it stop.
He laughs for the first time all evening, rolling his eyes a bit, but agreeing anyway. “I should have.”
Harry doesn't even try to hide his scowl as he shakes 'Antonio's' hand.
"I didn't know about the coup, but I could have prevented it if I hadn't fueled it. I'm very sorry."
Harry started pulling him toward the stairs. His jeans were discarded halfway up. Boxers were dropped in the hallway, and...that was as far as they got.
“No one said there were
After he'd left Harry and Draco's room, closing his eyes against the image of Draco Malfoy, of all people, looking completely shattered at the thought of losing Harry Potter, he'd found Hermione in the kitchen and collapsed into her lap to break down and cry a bit himself.
“Me too.” Harry kisses Draco’s neck once, softly, then dips his head and presses an open-mouthed kiss to his collarbone, then another, and another.

"MUM! HARRY! I got my shoes on, let's go!"
should?"
Draco stared at him for a long moment. "Alright, so we find this guard and offer him a job... What else?"
Harry frowned. "If it was just about me I'd say 'fuck it,' but I'm afraid I'm not the one under attack by the media at the moment."
"People think my wife died of Dragon Pox five years ago," Robards said slowly, his voice steady as he spoke, "that was a cover story. She went outside on the full moon, just to take the rubbish out mind you, and was attacked by a werewolf. She didn't recover from the encounter. I'll rid this world of werewolves if it's the last thing I do, Weasley." He dropped the two halves of Ron's wand on the floor.
He remembers carrying on studying even as his eyelids grew heavy, until... Harry came to fetch him and helped get him to bed.
"That isn't—" Harry sucks in a breath, closes his eyes for a moment. "That isn't what I was saying at
Draco sat beside him on the bed. "You alright?"
But Harry has barely come into contact with Draco’s mother since the trials, and he’s nervously adjusting the sleeves of his robes as they approach the impressive doors of Malfoy Manor.
"Hermione said you wanted to talk."

Harry shook his head. "So there we were, thinking you two hated us, when you really just wanted..."
"What are we talking about?" Ginny Weasley asks, as she and Luna come over. They're not an unusual sight in the Eighth Year Common Room, and no one bats an eye when they plop down on the rug and join the circle.
"I'm not sure, but challenges are complicated. If I could challenge Fenrir Greyback as a human without realizing it, I don't see why Nadine couldn't challenge Lorcan as a wolf. But I guess we'll have to see what—"
Draco glances at him, and Harry looks mortified, his mouth hanging open. He chokes out a horrified, "
They both freeze at the sound of a loud knock on the front door downstairs, then turn to look at each other with matching bewildered expressions.
“Very!”
Ron, at least, not anymore. They had been in an uneasy truce since he became friends with Hermione while she and Ron were dating. Draco just didn't think they would ever be friends. They were too different, and there was just too much history and mutual dislike there.

"'Kay." The little boy let his mother carry him from the room without any more fuss.
“Alright, that’s enough,” Draco shoots him a quelling look.
to come over, at least for dinner.
"Let's go."
"I know," Harry replies, and then he gets a hint of mischief in his eyes. He takes Draco's hand and kisses each finger, returning to and lingering on his ring finger. "Maybe they'd give me a little space if I got married."
“No, it’s fine. I just didn’t expect…I don’t want to take anything away from Remus, you know. But if it’s what he wants…”
At Draco’s birthday party Harry seems fine and normal, except that he never comes within five feet of him. He moves so much, making sure everything is perfect and everyone is having a good time, that no one else seems to notice, but his physical absence beside Draco sends a painfully clear message to him.
"It might have been their first
Draco pouted, and for a moment Harry forgot anyone else even existed. He leaned over for a sweet, lingering kiss, which Draco returned enthusiastically, despite being fully aware that there
Draco glanced back at Harry, who was still sleeping peacefully on the bed.
Draco gave his hand another squeeze.
"No, we have to get to Kingsley first," Hermione shook her head. "I can cast the Counter-Curse for the Imperius. I'm going to put on the cloak," she patted her bag, where Harry's invisibility cloak, borrowed on their way to the Ministry, was stowed. "I need you to cause a disturbance. Run at the door. Get it open if you can, so I can slip in unnoticed. But if you can't, hopefully they'll be too distracted to notice me slipping in."
"So, what're you doing in Teddy's room?" Ron asked, joining the conversation for the first time.
•••••
She gave him a shaky smile. "Alright then, back in bed with you. We'll give walking another go in a few hours, okay?"
“That was
Paul leans over and kisses his temple. “Can’t, I’m afraid. I’ve got an early morning meeting at Gringotts.”
Harry hugs him back and chokes out a surprised, “I love you too, Teddy.”
Draco’s mouth goes dry in an instant. “His
"Look at you, making jokes," She teased, "Draco's already been a good influence. You're awake. You're talking to me about your feelings like a normal person... Let him help you, Harry. He
"You—" Draco attempted to snark back, but Harry trailed his hands over his arse and pulled their hips flush again, thrusting up against him, and Draco cut himself off with a loud moan as a wave of pleasure crashed over him, "oh, fuck it. Mm—
Draco changes into his own pajamas and crawls in after him.
He doesn’t look at me. He doubles over, covering his mouth with a hand to muffle a choked sob. My heart aches in my chest. He draws himself upright as I step closer, until we’re facing each other again. I have to ask.
Changed by the war, Draco had apologized for his treatment of her, and he was eternally grateful that she'd forgiven him. Amazed, really.
The three adults turned to the doorway.
"Extremely. Come stir this while I drain the pasta, would you?"
Harry's face falls, and Draco registers what he's just said. "I, um, I mean—"
She turns and wraps her arms around Draco’s waist, surprising him with a hug, too. He smiles and hugs back. When she lets go, he asks, “What are you most excited for?”
Harry nodded. It was a question he'd wanted to ask, but he hadn't been sure how to bring it up.
Harry crumpled in the entryway. He arched his back, and let out a blood-curdling scream, his body convulsing violently on the floor.
"Yeah?"
"Jenkins will make you some breakfast and I'll be back soon, I promise."
Harry beamed at him, then pulled him into another kiss. "Thank you."
"How long do you think it's been?"
"Let's get you some help, yeah?" Draco cut him off by kissing him gently—and quickly—even Harry's lips were burning hot. Draco helped Harry to his feet, letting him lean heavily against him again, and they made their way to the front door, knocking hard when they reached it.
Harry has a surprisingly apologetic look on his face and an expensive-looking bottle of red wine in his hand. He holds it out with a tentative smile. “For later?”
“Wait here. We’ll just be a few minutes,” Harry says, handing the driver a wad of paper Muggle money.
“More than,” Harry’s grins. “Should we…?” He gestures at the layers of clothes between them.
"I know. I really have to go now."
"Don't watch, Drake." Harry pleaded, looking up at him from the floor as his body twitched and cracked with sickening crunching sounds. "
Harry stares blankly at me. "I'm an
When he kisses him, Draco responds enthusiastically, but he pulls away after a few minutes, as things start to heat up and Harry's hands start to wander.
Harry trails a warm hand over his flank, still kissing his neck.
Harry felt a wave of fury crash over him. "That's
, of all people. And I didn't even know it was happening."
"I don't know," Hermione whispered back. "You're probably right, though. Kingsley is strong, very few witches or wizards would be able to keep him under their control for this long."
Finally,
Harry sang and danced along to the music with the confidence of someone who didn't know they were being watched, swinging his hips in a way that made Draco's mouth run dry, a surge of desire running through his entire body.
he didn't expect her to wait up for him?
“Ron!” Multiple family members exclaim, his wife loudest of all.
Harry stared wide-eyed at his best friends as he struggled to come up with an explanation for the naked Draco Malfoy on top of him, whom they'd, presumably, just heard him profess his love to.
"Harry?"
A week later, Harry lets his cousin into their house. Draco watches from the other doorway that leads to the kitchen, arms folded and eyes narrowed, as Harry invites him into the sitting room. Dudley shoots him a nervous look, eyes widening in recognition. His eyes dart to the ring on his left hand, then back to Harry.
Harry finally stops talking and glances back, looking positively mortified with himself, and there's nothing for it—Draco grabs his face and leans down.
"I'd like to send Thomas to stay with Draco at Grimmauld Place for the night, if that's okay with you," he said, "I have some other friends that will be there, too. My friend Hermione agreed to watch Thomas there for you. And if...if I don't make it, I don't want Thomas to see the aftermath, okay? Don't let him come down until...until it's cleaned up. I don't want him to be traumatized by seeing what happened."
Draco glanced apprehensively at the charred newspaper in the bin. "What...er, what did it say?"
“I was happily married? Off making little Pureblood babies?” He looks disgusted at the idea.
The Weasley’s clear a path for him from the doorway when he opens the door, and Harry beams at the sight of him. It makes the tightness in Draco’s chest ease a bit. He’s lying on the bed, but otherwise he looks fine.
Harry inclined his head and folded his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling awkward. "I could never have asked you and Thomas to leave, Nadine. You're not Greyback. You're not responsible for the choices he made, especially after he left the pack."
"Come on, Harry. We didn't mean it like that, we're just concerned, you know it wasn't—come back in the house, don't leave, it wasn't—"
"Sorry!" Draco apologized quickly, a jolt of fear running down his spine as Harry glared at him, a betrayed, accusatory look in his bright viridian eyes, a low growl rumbling in his throat. "It should feel better now though."
Draco flushes, biting his lip over a smile. "Stop bringing that up. It's embarrassing."
Draco smiles and takes it, and they whirl away.
"What time did he take the Dreamless Sleep potion?"
“Close up the shop and go home early,” Draco barks at Marie, who is watching them, wide-eyed. “
"I'm just so
The man slipped an arm around her waist, regarding them curiously.
"Merlin, you're burning up. Are you sick?"
, but it’ll still be fun!
"Mhm, wanna ride you in a minute," Draco swirled his tongue over the head. "The Chosen One is
“2001, I think,” Draco smiles. “You got drunk and told me you refused to call me Malfoy for another second because we were friends and it was stupid.”
"Mathias, what can I do for you?" Harry was engrossed in his search, and didn't look up.
Draco finds Harry in their room, tugging a soft t-shirt over his head. He's already tossed his robes aside and changed into his favorite pair of joggers. He beams when he sees him. "Hey! How did Arithmancy go?"
Harry stood abruptly, his chair scraping across the floor. The bar owner flinched away from him, but he just dropped a few Sickles on the table and looked at Ron.
She tilted her head and appraised him for a moment before turning around and scooping green mush off of Rose's chin with the spoon and popping it back into the baby's mouth.
"Will there be cake?"
Harry catches another glint of gold out of the corner of his eye and he knows that this time, it isn't Zabini's watch. Unfortunately, Draco has spotted it too, and he's closer.
By the time Monday morning rolls around, Draco almost feels like himself again. He takes his N.E.W.T.s over the course of the next three days, and feels like he's been holding his breath for the entire time until he walks out of his last exam and lets out a heavy sigh.
He wraps his arms and legs around me like a koala, shivering and holding on tight.
Draco turns it and pulls the door open. "Then I guess we're done here."
The Glamour lifts, and one by one the stars that make up the Draco constellation reappear, twinkling softly against his dark skin.
"Hey!"
"He smirked at me. He's an arsehole."
"Just go, Potter," Draco pleaded, heat rising in his cheeks and up the back of his neck. He turned away again. "
He kisses me and tugs at the hem of my shirt and I obediently lift my arms and let him pull it over my head.
"I want to come, too!"
“Once,” Harry answers, his upward thrusts getting sloppy. A bead of sweat trails down the side of his forehead. “You can—tell me again—if you want—“
"How did you...?" Harry was blushing furiously. He set Draco on his feet and ran a nervous hand through his already-messy hair.

“What exactly
Harry was stunned. With a flick of her long blonde hair, Sofia disappeared through the door.
“I love you,” Harry says, and Draco feels his heart expand in his chest, warm and full. He wants to live in this moment forever.
“I love you,” Draco says, kissing him again.
After a moment, Kasper spoke again. "To answer your question, Draco, you're in what was once Fenrir Greyback's house. He called it Wolf's Hollow, back in the day...you know, before he lost his mind. There were more of us back then."
"Who would do that though? And
like you.”
not the one who ended things! I'm not the one who said that I didn't need you, or that I was better off without you! Or that I wouldn't be thinking about you! Or that I hated you!
. "Er,
As the others around them relax and start moving again, the threat clearly nonexistent, Harry slowly stands and tucks his wand into its leather holster on his thigh, the way the Aurors all tend to wear them, his movements oddly rigid.
The house elf appeared with another small popping noise. "Yes, sir?"
Draco groaned when Harry rolled over for what must have been the hundredth time. He shifted closer, draping an arm over Harry's waist and tucking his head under his chin.
“Let me guess, he did it again.”
Neither of them were in a hurry to get out of bed the next morning. They lay together, speaking softly. Draco had filled Harry in on the events at Wolf's Hollow the previous night, but they hadn't had time for Harry to tell Draco what had happened at Azkaban and outside the Minister's office.
Hermione looked Draco in the eye. "Yes, Draco. I do."
"Never mind," Harry said too quickly, defensively.
“I am. I heard what your Healer said, and I promised your mum I’d take care of you.”
"What do you want, Hermione?" He growled.
“Right.”
Draco licks his bloody lip and looks up at him, a storm raging behind those clear grey eyes "Don't I, Potter?"
Harry recognized the deep voice from his visions, and he felt a wave of calm wash over him.
"What happened?"
what this is? I hate it!"
He leaned down for a salty kiss, running his hands over Harry's chest, then down to his flies. Draco knew how close to the edge he was, and how he wanted this first round to go if Harry wouldn't specify. He tugged Harry's trousers open and yanked his pants down just enough to free his cock. Harry clenched his hands in the sheets and arched off the bed when Draco took him into his skilled mouth. It wasn't long before he was coming down his throat with a cry that was half relief, half pleasure.
* * *
“I came over to meet your son and found you sleeping with Harry Potter!” Brandon practically shrieks. He looks justifiably upset, Draco’s borrowed shirt already dry cleaned and hanging over one arm as he motions at them with the other.
The next time they see the Snitch, Harry and Draco both bend forward over their brooms in the race to capture it. They dive low to the ground, neck and neck the whole way. Draco throws a hand out and shoves him, laughing when Harry adjusts his course to slam into his side in retaliation.
“I know,” Ginny sighs, forcing me back to the present. “Don’t think about that right now. We’re having fun! Twirl me!”
,” Draco says, and, catching the dubious look on Harry’s face, adds, “scars and all. Every part of you.”
And then Draco is alone with a slightly-drunk Harry Potter, who offers him the bottle and a shoulder to cry on. He takes him up on it, curling against his side to bury his face in the soft black t-shirt he’s wearing. He’s also wearing the cologne Draco gave him for his birthday last year, and
Draco laughs and kisses his forehead. "Don't worry, I'll take care of you."
Harry has pushed Draco back against the counter, one hand buried in Draco’s hair, the other holding a spatula. It’s more controlled and chaste than most of their kisses of the day, both of them fully aware that Teddy would be coming through the Floo at any time, but unable to keep their hands off each other anyway.
"The Healer wasn't helping him!" Draco protested.
“Yes, Dad,” Teddy sighs just as exaggeratedly and Apparates away with a sharp
"I'll be back tomorrow." Harry tipped his chin up to kiss him again.
"Well, I
Harry. Well, you probably know he's quit the Auror Department, right?"
he told himself as silent tears welled up in his eyes and soaked his pillow.
"Screaming," Potter repeated. "Er, okay...
The surge of arousal that floods through Draco is nearly overwhelming. “Merlin,
Draco nods, his gaze dropping to the table in front of him. “Thank you. You’re very kind.”
“Hello,” he says carefully. “Brandon, right?”
anyone
Harry didn't need telling twice.
Draco loved this side of Harry; his hands pulling his hips flush against him, low growls of pleasure emanating from his chest as he kisses him in that way he always has, like kissing Draco is the only thing that matters, and nothing else even exists.
Draco tries not to overthink it as he goes back to the Apothecary.
Harry drifted in and out of consciousness as Draco carried him for over half an hour, waking to give direction occasionally, then slipping back into a feverish sleep.
Hermione glanced at the clock and yawned. She'd expected Ron home at least an hour ago. But he
"Er, okay. How are things with you? Been working on the house at all?"
Slowly, Draco pulled one of the vials out of its slot and examined the shimmering blue liquid inside. He'd drunk one of these vials every week since he was two years old; when people had begun to notice. His skin was too smooth, even for a toddler, his eyes too bright, his hair too shiny, his pleading for whatever he wanted in the moment perhaps a little
scarier, but Mother is by far the more formidable of the two."
“I’m sorry for interrupting your, um, your date.”
"I couldn't get rid of it," Harry says softly as I reach out to touch. He turns his head and brushes his lips over my wrist. "I wanted to, but I could never bring myself to do it."
"Oh thank Merlin," she leapt forward to steady her friend as he swayed on his feet. "Kingsley, you've been under the Imperius Curse. We need to set things right, can you stand?"
"I love you, too," Harry responded with equal fervor.
, Potter!" Draco shrieked a second later, "tickling is
"Everything's okay!" Draco spoke quickly, hoping to assuage their fears, "Harry's fine. We found them—his werewolf pack. He's with them now, and he's doing much better. His fever broke some time in the night and he's been feeling pretty normal today. Better than normal for a full moon, actually. He's going to transform over there tonight. I'll Side-Along him home tomorrow after he's had a few hours to recover."

Harry’s whole demeanor softens at the sight of the child, and he crouches down to her level. “Hello, I’m Harry. I’m here to see your dad. Is he home?”
" Harry's eyes gleamed, and he leaned forward to kiss his fiancé again, more passionately this time.
Draco pulls him into another tender kiss. "And I love
Draco smiled and tipped his head, conceding. "Okay, so it did change you physically. But not inside. You're still you, Harry. I'm still..." This was entering forbidden topic number one territory, but Draco forced himself to continue. "I'm still...attracted to you."
"Oh. Well that's... Oh."
After a moment, he turned and Apparated home.
"Listen, Malfoy," Potter says quickly. "Teddy's been having a really hard time, and there are a couple of things I wanted to talk to you about, before—"
Yes, he
“Both of us?”
“I just...I really liked him,” Draco ends up hiccuping against Harry’s chest, lying on top of him on the sofa.
"At school it was just a silly crush. He was handsome, and a hero, and frustratingly good at Quidditch, but now..."

Paul sighs heavily. “Teddy is going to Hogwarts in a few months. You’ve protected him long enough. Think about how great it could be for the three of you if it goes well. I think it will.”
Across the room, a large grey wolf stood, hackles raised, and advanced toward him.
"Fine."
Ron and Hermione were talking quietly in the kitchen, enormous mugs of coffee in their hands. Hermione held a third mug out to him.
Unlike Draco, Harry is fully dressed, strangely
IT TO BE HIM!” David screams, face twisting in pain. “Admit it! Every time, you’ve wanted it to be him.”
“What about the media?”
Her attempt to quiet him only made him angrier, and he turned that ire on the man beside her. "Tell me
"Excellent," Harry grinned. "I'll owl over all the details and you'll have a chance to make any adjustments to the employment contract as needed. We'll work it all out and make sure everyone is happy with the arrangement. I'm looking forward to working with you."
to be good."
He traced a finger over Draco's still-clothed erection, and Draco moaned softly against his ear. "Please."
Harry stepped forward and clapped a hand on his shoulder. "No harm done, mate."
Harry laughs and turns his head to catch Draco’s mouth in a soft kiss, a hand coming up to cup his cheek.
Harry stares at him, fists clenched. "Draco—"
"Fucking
"I'm alright," he told Hermione when she gave him a concerned look. "Let's go."
If looks could kill, the St. Mungo's Healer would be dead.
Victoire Weasley comes running up to greet her best friend with a hug, and Teddy blushes. “We have Prefect and Head Boy duties,” she says. “Come on!”
Harry cupped his cheek. "I should never have agreed to let you do this, it's been horrible."
“Draco,” Harry sets his drink down and moves closer, setting his hand on his shoulder. “Hey, we’re past this already, yeah? I made mistakes too, and we both apologized a long time ago.”
Harry told her everything. All about the werewolves, and how different he felt around them, and more about the house and the library, and about the challenge, and about Thomas, and the attempted seductions the two single werewolves had attempted the night before. She listened and nodded along as he spoke, acknowledging but not interrupting.
She giggled in a very un-Hermione-ish way. "I figured I'd let Harry tell you. Was he as awkward as I've imagined?"
He indicated the pile of letters beside him, then tossed the book to Draco, who caught it and turned it over in his hands to read the title. Harry watched as his face turned crimson and contorted into a scowl.
A HERO NO MORE: HARRY POTTER TURNED WEREWOLF IN GREYBACK'S REVENGE
He crosses his arms over his chest. "What do you want, Malfoy?"

to kiss him. So he leaned over the side of the bed and kissed him.
An official form was flashed at her, bearing the Minister's signature and official seal. Hermione stared calculatingly at the two men in front of her, then glanced at her boss, who looked as furious as she felt. The Aurors shouldn't be interfering in other departments, or targeting magical creatures as threats instead of working to coexist peacefully...
"You know, the guy from those Muggle spaceship films you made me watch last week. When the princess tells him she loves him and all he says is,

Draco shoves that line of thought away as Dave’s pained expression flashes in his mind.

Draco had dug around in his bag and found a Pain-Relief Potion and offered it to him, offering to hold him too, if Harry needed that. Harry did.
Harry was just as Draco had left him, but he roused quickly when the scents of breakfast reached him. He rubbed at his eyes and blinked blearily up at Draco from the bed.
Harry leaves the room for a minute, coming back in casual clothes, his school robes discarded. He conjures a stool and sits down beside the tub, running a hand through Draco's wet hair.

"Alright, alright," Draco griped, "your little sob story worked, I won't steal your emotional-support owl. Happy?"
He leapt out of bed, threw on some clothes, and ran down the stairs.

Harry sat down on the end of the sofa and pulled him back between his legs, Draco's back pressed firmly against his chest. After settling the quilt back down over them both, Harry finally relaxed. He loosely held his shivering boyfriend around the waist, watching him sip the scalding hot cocoa, eyes red-rimmed and hands shaking.
"Can't be

"Harry, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. Kasper says it was something to do with the full moon and a young new Alpha. I've never done anything like that before, and I—"
“Lie down,” he orders, and Harry obeys with a raised brow and a cheeky smile.
This time Draco couldn't resist kissing him back; Harry's enthusiasm was infectious.
•••••
what you did, is it?”
An older, familiar-looking man standing beside the bed tentatively reached out and touched his shoulder. Harry flinched away, and the hand was withdrawn.
"For what?" Draco breathed, closing his eyes as Harry kissed the pads of each finger, then pressed a kiss to his palm, then another to the inside of his wrist. "What are you doing?" He bit his lip as Harry gently tugged him closer.
“It is. It’s in the past, we’ve moved on.”
Harry laughed when Malfoy's next spell, another Stunner, deflected off Harry's shield, hitting one of his own men and knocking him unconscious.
She hugged them each in turn. "I haven't forgotten my promise to bring Marie to meet everyone," Harry said. "When things are calmer, we'll plan a night to have the three of you for dinner."
* * *
After two hours of polite conversation, Draco thought he might explode.
Lottie and Violet both scream when a fox-shaped Patronus bursts into the room. “Healer Potter! There’s been an incident with one of your patients, accidental underage magic of a sibling, the patient has antlers, unresponsive to traditional removal Spells. Patient’s name is Dorian Dalton-Tracy, three years of age.”
Harry smiled and sat in the chair on the right, gazing outside at the sunset and the secluded forest and beautifully landscaped grounds surrounding the Manor.
"Tell me everything later."

" Draco came running into the entryway and threw his arms around him. "How are you here? Merlin, so much has happened—Mm." Harry kissed him hard, running his hands over Draco's back, and Draco melted into his embrace, kissing him back just as fervently.
Harry went home disappointed that evening, having not discovered anything that would help recover Ron's memories after several hours of searching. He promised to come back with Draco and help Hermione with her research another day.
Draco stood. "Can I go see him?"
"HERMIONE!" He shrieked.
Harry sat up and licked his face affectionately, nuzzling his nose against Draco's cheek before settling back down in his lap.
Harry cups his cheek with a hand and leans in for another kiss. “I do. I really
"We're here to question you about—"
"I think it's about time for us to get going anyway," Harry laughed. "International Portkey to catch and all."
The molds the chocolatier used to form the sweets had intricate dragons carved into them, so that each one had a different dragon on top, indicating the flavor inside. When he was young, his mother had jokingly told him they were made just for him, because of his name, and he had loved them all the more for it.
“Lying
After alerting the pack of his plans to leave for the night, he asked Kasper where he could find more information about werewolves.

Draco cringes, then lets out a shaky, tearful laugh. “You’re too good, Paul.”
“I shouldn’t have snapped at you, or been cold to you before Ginny’s party. I’m sorry. Our friendship is important to me,” Harry pauses to brush his hair out of his face, huffing in frustration when the dark curls fall right back in his eyes. “I shouldn’t have pushed you away, no matter how angry I was—”
"Don't throw too many clothes on Harry," she teased, "You need a check-up the moment I get in there!"
“I’ve got you, love,” I whisper, pushing inside and watching him wince a bit at the pressure as I slide in, inch by inch, until I’m fully seated inside him. “I’ve got you.”
* * *
•••••
Draco found himself feeling slightly less irked by this Healer than he had been by the others. He sat back in his chair and let her work and chatter away with Harry, observing quietly.
But the intense, nearly-blinding pain in his shoulder made him wonder if he would soon wish he hadn't.
“No,” Harry shakes his head. “You were right. I didn’t want to admit it, because I don’t like being told what to do, but that isn’t...that kind of relationship isn’t really what I want. I know that. I thought maybe it would, but...anyway, I shouldn’t have gotten so defensive. The whole world has their eyes on my dating life, and sometimes I just wish…” He swallows. “I was tired of feeling like anyone I dated had to be vetted for the entire wizarding world’s approval. Maybe I wanted to shock them a bit, I don’t know.”
"Maybe Hermione can Obliviate you," Seamus teases, clapping him on the back.
Lorcan appeared to be in his late-forties. He had long, matted, dark-blond hair and piercing blue eyes. His skin was weathered and tanned, his eyes cold. His expression had darkened even further as he watched Thomas's response to Harry.
"You're warm."
As the hour grew late and the conversation began to wind down, Draco felt an overwhelming wave of exhaustion and leaned against Harry's shoulder. Harry looked down into his face and, seeing the weariness in Draco's eyes, reacted immediately.
"I promise."
And from the way he looks down at him, Draco knows that Harry would sooner die than break a promise to their little boy.

for the poor dear.
to Draco in any sense of the word, and he hadn't known Draco would come over...
“He shouldn’t,” Draco mutters. “Did he say why…the attacker, I mean...why did he…?”
They land, reaching for the water bottles next to the case of Quidditch balls, tossing their brooms aside. Harry puts away the Quaffle, ignoring the Bludgers fighting against their restraints, and the innocent-looking golden Snitch. He closes the case and opens his water bottle, tugging his sweaty tee shirt over his head to wipe at his face, squirting water into his mouth and then unscrewing the top and pouring the rest over his head, shaking his black curls out like a dog, aiming for his godson.
She looks up when Draco and Ron walk in. "How bad was it?"

There were potted plants everywhere, and the small rooftop was lit by strands of fairy lights strung above them. It was beautiful, and Draco just knew Harry had been working on this place for weeks, the soppy git.

Draco ran a hand through his damp, freshly-washed hair as he made his way up the stairs. "Harry?"

and go talk to that hot guy who has been staring at you all night, or I’ll hit you with a Bat-Bogey Hex.”
Draco was rolling his eyes, Harry didn't even have to look at him to know. "Oh, please. I cast a bloody Patronus at him. No one could convict me for that and have it stick."
The front door opened and closed behind him, interrupting his thoughts, and Harry sensed Nadine's presence before she sat down beside him.
"Hmm?"
"Wha...oh. I fell asleep. What time is it?"
Draco doesn’t mean for it to sound as accusatory as it does.
That was five years ago.
Now, several years later, they still met for lunch at least once a week. Lately it was always like this, with Hermione stealing bites off her plate between shoveling spoonfuls of baby food into Rose's mouth, but Draco didn't mind. He adored that little girl and usually showed up with a new teething toy, board book, or rattle of some sort for her. Hermione accused him of trying to compete with the child's godfather with all of his doting, but he denied any such thing. It
of us being there. I can’t just…”
"I can't do that."
"You didn't have to do this Harry, but thank you."
He nods, and she grins. Ginny tugs at the hem of his shirt, and Harry gives her an exasperated look. After a few seconds of nonverbal arguing, Harry pulls his shirt over his head and hands it to her, pointedly rolling his eyes.
"That doesn't seem like something that would make Harry happy?" Draco asks with a wry smile.
"So do I," Harry laughs, "we'll get to that, but first I just want to—"
"Harry? What's—? What the fuck are you
Harry nodded. "Yes. If it doesn't, I'll continue of course, but since an official abdication has been stated, it should work."
Draco nodded and Apparated directly to Grimmauld Place.
She went up on tip-toes to kiss his cheek. "Thank you, Harry."
Harry winces exaggeratedly, bringing a hand up to protect himself from further attacks. “Alright, alright. I surrender!”
Draco kissed him hard, not caring a whit about the paint.
Harry smiled, looking around at them all. "I'm sorry I'm late. Let's talk about this challenge process. I've been reading up on it, but I'd appreciate any more insight you can give so we're all prepared. Does the next full moon suit you, Lorcan?"
“Ginny,
“More free time,” I smile, leaning forward to kiss him as he undoes the button and zip on my jeans and stepping out of them after he shoves them down my legs. “More sexual frustration to work out.”
"I know, but I'm nothing like her, I can assure you."
“No,” Harry stands up, “I’m headed over to Ron and Hermione’s tonight. Thanks, though.”
"It's because Harry's injured, and things with the pack are in upheaval. Normally they can be separated for extended periods of time, but not right now. Not until Harry's back on his feet. Help me get him back to the hospital, will you?"
He likes Paul. He genuinely does. He’s thoughtful, and interesting, and attractive, and he’s not Harry, but…
“Better?”
“He talks about you, too,” Draco concedes. “Although that’s not surprising, seeing that he never
“What do you even talk about?”
Draco grins wickedly.
Draco slipped his free hand into Harry's, lacing their fingers together. Harry gave his hand a light squeeze and Draco smiled, squeezing back. He was
Ron screamed and dropped to his knees, clutching his head in his hands. Hermione gasped and knelt beside him. "Ron! Are you okay? Did the spell hurt you?"
It's messy, and intense, and Harry still kisses with his entire
Draco climbed under the covers, and Harry curled up next to him. Soon they were both sleeping soundly.
Draco looks stunning, and the hot Italian man on his arm is as stylish as his new dress robes. Draco is a tactile person, so it's not surprising that he doesn't keep his hands to himself, but the way he hangs all over the other man still makes Harry want to vomit. Or break something. Or both.
“You beat Harry Potter to the Snitch?”
"I just needed to get my wand."
"Our Alpha is currently incapacitated, Lorcan, as you can see. He's in transition," Kasper spoke calmly, "This isn't the way, and you know it. We talked about this. Mathias, Laith, take him downstairs."
"Dating
"I—I don't know."
"Only about an hour. I used a Lightening Charm, but it wore off just before we got here. Where is here, anyway?"
"I'd like to say no," Hermione answered carefully, "but we're talking about the man who walked into the forest to sacrifice himself to Voldemort without telling anyone, so...it's possible."
Draco wishes that he'd just explained
"It was," the man says. "This is Margo Leavitt, from the department of Child Welfare at the Ministry. She has been reviewing Andromeda Tonks' wishes for the guardianship of one Edward Tonks, and it involves both of you. You see, she has expressed a wish for his guardianship and custody to be split equally between you."
"He also hasn't been himself lately, and he's sensitive about the anti-werewolf shit, you know that, and he's been having more of those strange visions and sometimes they make him—"
Harry asked through gritted teeth. "Draco. How can you want this? Want
Draco was pulling on another jumper, and then he grabbed an extra pair of thick socks to put on over the ones he already had on.
"...so once I got the basics I started going over about once a week, until I could make quite a few things on my own. And, as you know, Molly
“What do you have in mind?”
Draco can’t help it, he smiles.
When Draco was starting to feel like he couldn't take another step, he used his shoulder to press through a thick patch of branches, and suddenly an enormous, decrepit house loomed in front of them. The blond sank to his knees, gently setting his unconscious boyfriend on the ground.
” Draco is struck by the realization that he really doesn’t know much about the Muggles who raised Harry, or anything, really.
"I love you," Draco repeats, when they break for a moment for air.
The kiss lasted longer than either of them intended, and, after a long moment, Draco propped himself up on a hand to get a better angle as he aggressively shoved his tongue into Harry's mouth and rolled his hips down against him.
Something about the way he says it feels off, but Draco is too relieved that he’s leaving to really notice or care. “Fine,” Draco echoes. “That’s fine.”
“I guess we should put some clothes on and go get that?” Harry asks as the knocking continues, getting louder.
Draco catches Harry’s wrist, and the rage in his eyes when he turns to look at him actually makes him flinch back. He hasn’t seen Harry this angry in years, he’d forgotten how intimidating it is, even when it’s directed at someone else. “Don’t,” Draco whispers. “He’s not worth it.”
investigating
"Ugh. Can't we just stay home?"
people, 'Mione! I invented a better version of the Anti-Nausea potion, for Merlin's sake!
"I understand," Kasper said sadly. "We won't return to this country for as long as we live, you have my word."
"I didn't get married, Harry," I manage to croak out.
This is a perfectly friendly thing to do, Draco tells himself, as Harry relaxes against him.
“Yes! We’re...well, we
"We are," Draco responded, glancing over at Harry with a smile. "Will you come?"
talked. About their hard days, and what they needed from each other on those days, and as difficult as talking about it all was for them both, their relationship had been that much stronger for it.
A nod.
"You can. Just breathe. We'll figure this out. I'll go into work and speak with McDougal in a moment. But first, you need to breathe."
Harry shifts uncomfortably. “Oh, er…”
“Why didn’t you tell her? Your cousin's wife? They lied to her.”
“Oh,” Harry sighs, turning his face into the pillow, “
He jumped at her forceful tone. "I swear, Hermione! I won't tell anyone!"
"What are you reading?"
Draco started. "I didn't tell you my last name."
"Yeah. I just feel..." Harry took a swallow of water and pulled a face. "I feel feverish. And my head hurts."
“How do they still fit? Didn’t your head, you know...grow? As you got older?”
Draco smiled when they reached the door to Harry's bedroom. "Thank you. I can go in alone."
Hermione swatted at his arm, but there was no heat behind the gesture. "Come on, before everyone gets hungry."
She smiled at him again . "Then you have it."
Draco slowly climbed out of the bed, careful not to wake his sleeping boyfriend, and made his way into the kitchen. The sight of his discarded clothes and potions texts littering the table made him smile.
The St. Mungo's Healer tried one final time. "Mr. Malfoy, for the last time, I cannot allow you to—"
Harry gave him a weak smile. "I don't know."
“Nothing! I just wanted to get out of there, and correcting her when she was lecturing seemed like a bad idea.”
Draco is trying not to let his eyes linger on the other man too long. Hermione was obviously involved in preparing him for the outing; he has what can only be Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion in his hair, transforming his unruly raven curls into something softer and shinier, falling over his forehead in a way that looks intentional. He’s also dressed extremely formally in dark grey slacks, shiny shoes, and a wool coat that does nothing to hide the fit body Draco knows is underneath. He wonders idly if Harry, with his leather gloves and dark green scarf topping off the look, has any earthly idea just how good he looks. From the way he’s fidgeting as they stop in front of the door, Draco doesn’t think he does.
thought?
The dragon wakes and blinks at him with yellow eyes, stretching her wings and settling into an upright position.
"Okay."
"Harry Potter?"
"I love you."
"I love you."
"I'm sweaty," Draco protested as Harry nuzzled along his neck, flicking his tongue out to taste the skin.
and so bloody
"Since always, you prat," Draco huffed, smacking the other man's chest before abruptly changing the subject. "How did it go today? With Lorcan?"
. So he channeled his crush into, well. You were there, you know."
“Stop sulking!” Ginny presses a shot of Firewhisky into my hand. “Drink that. We’re celebrating!”
Draco held Rose while Hermione called The Burrow.
"We're really doing this."
Draco makes note of where he is in the brewing process for when he comes back, and then he goes out to help this mystery customer.
"You were over forty-five minutes late!"
Harry and Draco exchange shell-shocked looks as Draco passes him a glass of wine and they go to sit on the sofa, both taking large gulps.
"Thank you," Harry murmured, his gaze traveling around the room again, "All of you."

I hate myself for the pang of longing that jolts through my entire body, but I can’t help it. He’s staring at me, and he looks exactly as I remember: same slender frame, same haircut, same high cheekbones, slender, upturned nose, and full lips that taste so,

The boy nodded and hugged him back. "Okay."
"Draco! What happened? Where's Harry? Why isn't he with you?"
"And I, um, I like you."
He gave her a sad smile. "Thanks, Nadine. You're a good friend."
Draco sat up too, their knees brushing as he turned to face him. "What don't I know?"
He pulled his head out of the fire and slammed a fist on the stone hearth.
“Alright. Well,” Draco gestures at the books he’d brought over. “I brought that book series Teddy left at my house that he apparently can’t live without.”
“Well, she only met with me and Teddy once, but he seemed to really like her. I owled her with questions a few times and the answers she sent back were really helpful. I thought I’d take him to see her again next time he’s with me, but you can take him, too. That would probably be good, so she can get to know both of us.”
"I'll walk up to the house with you," he offered.

Harry shook his head, wide-eyed but smiling awkwardly.
"Hey, how are things with Weasley? I thought I heard him come through the kitchen Floo?"
for paperwork." Ron rolled his eyes. "I don't understand why you quit, anyway. I mean, I know you would have to take time off around the full moon, but it seems to me like your enhanced senses would be an asset more than anything... What?"
"Gladly," Draco smirked.
“What?”
"Yes," he whispers. "I did tell some of the other Aurors that. I was just bragging."
•••••
They reached the old cellar door in the kitchen, and Draco hesitated, a memory of Harry telling him it was full of spiders surfacing.
"I imagine werewolves haven't been lining up to be interviewed by wizards about the intimacies of their culture and magic," Draco commented, "especially with bastards like Emerett Picardy spewing lies and hate every chance they get. The distrust of wizards is perfectly understandable, even though most of them were wizards or witches before they were turned."
Draco turned his attention back to his fiancé and found himself fighting back tears again. He was
"Mm, still a bloody furnace though," Draco teased, sliding his hands up the back of Harry's shirt.
" Lorcan asked mockingly.
"I guess my body is finally adjusting to this whole lycanthropy thing," Harry murmured. "If only..."
"Really?"
Draco's eyes glittered. "Did I complain yesterday?"
"None of us have jobs, Harry. We survive out here in the forest with minimal contact with the outside world, and we can take care of ourselves very well, but we certainly can't afford the luxury of the Wolfsbane potion."
"Well done, McDougal," the Head of the DMLE smiled. "Take him to Azkaban."
"He hasn't technically done anything wrong!"
Draco sobered. "Well, no amount of treats can top that, can they?" Louis hooted dolefully in response. "I didn't know you rescued him."

, it's hard to believe—"
With a longing look at his bed, he attempted to push himself up off the ground, but his limbs wouldn't listen. He closed his eyes for a moment, took a deep breath, and tried again. He made it up onto his hands and knees before his strength gave out and his face collided painfully with the hard floor.
"Don't care," Harry muttered, squeezing him tighter.
“So Harry,” Narcissa draws Draco’s attention back to the conversation. Teddy has fallen asleep on the sofa with his head in her lap, stuffed full of good food and a full day of Christmas cheer. “Have
You don't need to apologize. You're—"
"I wasn't sure, you know."
Harry pulls him down the street, their hands still clasped firmly together. When Draco stumbles, Harry catches him against his chest, a hand going to his elbow to steady him, and as he looks up into his face Draco thinks explicitly about kissing him, right there on the street.
, or something…”
"Apparate us up to bed, Harry," he murmured, kissing him again. "I want you."
“Lovely.” Narcissa gently wakes up the sleeping boy and helps him up, guiding him toward the door. “I’ll just take him up to bed, then. Happy Christmas, Harry. It was wonderful to see you.”
. Whatever that meant.
"He seems genuinely kind," Nadine added, "I've never seen Thomas take to someone like that. And I was watching his eyes when he realized who Thomas's father was. He didn't even
“I only have one:
—something on your mind, darling?”
But it was the soft feminine voice that called her back that got her to stop and turn. "Cissy?"
"Not yet. At least, not that we can agree on." Nadine grinned. "Any ideas?"
Teddy makes a brief appearance for introductions before disappearing back into his bedroom, apparently woken by the loud knocking and unfamiliar voices downstairs, and then they get Lottie and Violet settled into the guest suite to get ready for bed.
“Fine.”
"Hey," Harry tries to pull him into a hug, but Draco keeps him at arm's length. "It's not like that."
Harry steps through the Floo a few short minutes later dressed in pajama pants and a comfortable-looking Weird Sisters tee.
Slowly over the next couple of hours, the room fills with Weasleys and Draco lets George field their questions, his eyes on the floor. Despite George’s reassurances, guilt is still roiling in his stomach, hot and twisting.
Draco sat up. "No...should we have?"
"Right. I guess that makes sense. I'll take a cell tonight, too, then."
Draco passes the bottle over and Harry takes a sip and gives it back. They drink in silence for a few minutes, until—
nice," Draco murmured back, "as
After a horrific night of transformation, his third in total, Harry woke up at sunrise the next morning on the cold wood floor of his bedroom, face down. His clothes were a tangled, shredded mess of fabric beside him. Light tremors were racking through his body, and he shivered involuntarily in remembered pain. He still ached, still felt nauseated and clammy and weak, but the worst of it was over now.
At the top, his shoe caught on a loose floorboard and he fell, the bag full of books spilling and tumbling down with him, his wand flying out of his hand.
"You took that news rather well."
“Wow,” Harry murmurs.
It had been entirely Robards idea, of course.
"I think so," Harry smiled. "I guess we'll have to see."
"Harry Potter?"
Ginny has her head in her hands when they walk in the kitchen, a concerned-looking Dean hovering beside her.
"Erm... Yes?"
Every Halloween, Draco's boyfriend goes missing for several hours. He doesn't panic anymore, and he doesn't ask him where he goes, he simply...waits.
"Hi. How are you feeling?"
“It’s alright. Come here.”
“Yes, right, Diagon Alley. Going there later this summer should be interesting. Thank you both so much for taking us in too, I know it wasn’t fair of me to ask—”
She had my attention at ‘blond,’ and the guy
"Euch," Ron groans, "I think I preferred you two when you were holding hands under the table and the rest of us were pretending not to notice."
We'd shucked our clothes off with alarming speed, laughing at ourselves as we did, and clambered into his bed, frotting to a spectacular finish, then exchanging blow jobs and bringing each other off a second time before curling up together and falling asleep.
"I'm sorry," Harry says softly, and Draco turns to look at him, eyes glistening.
Harry loosened his hold and brushed Draco's hair out of his face. "I love you. Welcome home."
“I tried,” Draco laughs weakly. “Merlin, I tried. But you’re…” He shakes his head and forces himself to look Harry in the eye, “
Hermione looked up and grinned. "And you wanted no part of that, I'm guessing?"
Harry laughs and lets the door swing shut behind him without answering.
Kasper met his friend's eyes again. "You're too volatile this close to the full moon, Lor. I'm sorry. You tried to attack the Alpha outside of an official challenge. That's a punishable offense, I'm afraid. You are therefore stripped of your Beta title. I sentence you to 48 hours in the dungeon—"
“Yeah. I mean, no, but it’s not an emergency. Can I come through? I need to talk to you.”
"The addition of muscle relaxing ingredients was genius. I did feel better, although it did give me horrifically bad breath for two solid days. Nothing could get rid of it until it went away on its own, and Draco wouldn't come anywhere near me, not that I blame him. We're both hoping this batch won't come with that particular side effect again." Harry shot her a wry smile.
"I know."
"Good. Because I'll die without you!" Harry teased, still squeezing Draco tight. "I can't do it!"
“Thanks, Draco,” He murmurs. His eyes are closed again, the lines of pain in his face slowly softening into a more peaceful expression. After a few minutes his breathing slows, and Draco realizes he’s fallen asleep.
Outside, I run around the side of the building into the dark alley and lean against the wall, gulping down the chilly air and wiping hot, angry tears away from my face.
"Well, that was new for us," Draco laughed.
, that Harry actually
"Let's get you warmed up properly. Come on."
. I'm so in love with you I don't even know what to do with it half the time, and I— I would choose love over fear every time. Wouldn't you?"
Hermione's plan worked perfectly. Ron barreled at the door, shooting off Stunning Spells and screaming nonsensically at anyone who tried to stop him. He wrenched the door open before he was subdued. The Minister's Secretary, Imperiused herself Hermione noticed as she crept through the open doorway, closed the door behind her, leaving Hermione alone with Kingsley Shacklebolt for the first time since he was put under the Imperius Curse over six months prior.
After a long moment, he abruptly stands and walks around the sofa to pull him into a tight embrace.
Harry looks like he wants to say something else, but his dragon tattoo decides to show her face, shattering the tense moment by appearing on his shoulder, seemingly peeking over at Draco, and he’s delighted. He reaches out to stroke his fingers over Harry’s skin, over her head, and the dragon preens under his touch.
He'd let Draco lay in his lap while they talked, absently running his fingers through the blond strands while he patiently listened to Draco rant about potions ingredients and rare plants for hours, even asking intermittent questions to show he was listening, even though Draco was pretty sure he only understood about half of what he said. Harry was terrible at potions, after all, but Draco appreciated the effort.
Draco stared incredulously at the man beside him who, until very recently had openly hated him, as he stepped forward and grabbed the Head Healer by the front of his auspicious lime green robes, flashing his Auror badge in his face.
She shook her head. "They haven't come back yet. Nadine is trying to get Thomas to take a bath. Grace and Sofia are preparing the stew for dinner. I volunteered to bring the tray up to escape chopping carrots and onions. I should have gone instead of Laith, he prefers cooking to hunting anyway, but he wanted to spend time with Mathias this afternoon."
"Draco, I've been thinking about the hors d'oeuvres we selected for the reception, and I think we should revisit—oh." Narcissa froze, staring at her sister in shock. "I'm so sorry, you have guests, I'll go."
you know that?"
Thomas whined and began to cry when Nadine picked him up off the bed, and Harry broke away from staring at Draco for a moment to address the upset child. "Hey, hey. It's alright. I'll see you in the morning. Go to bed for your mum, okay?"
“Won’t you miss it?”
wrong.
"Harry..."
"Oh, does the Weasel feel bad?" Draco taunted with his patented sneer, "imagine how Harry is feeling, you git."
"I was so worried," Harry choked out, appalled that he's suddenly dangerously close to crying. "I couldn't—"
"I guess that's true."
turn of events.
"Hm. Yeah. We should probably do something about that."
be your pet, if you like."
Draco laughed in delight. "Merlin, you should see your face, Potter. Not your kink then, hm?"
"Thank you," Harry answered, sounding both relieved and exhausted.
"Ten. I thought I'd have him meet us in the Parlor in the East Wing? That way they can just Floo over directly."
The Sectumsempra scars are like a strike to the face for Harry, and Draco can only watch as he grapples with his reaction to them; horror and devastation at the results of his own actions years ago.
"He was
Three days after Harry learned about his werewolf pack, Ron and Hermione sat in Harry's bedroom with them, discussing the situation.
." Draco shuddered bodily at the very idea. "Go on, I know you're dying to tell me everything, so spill."
Harry stood up slowly and shook out his body like a dog, yelping in pain when he tried to take a step on his front left paw. He limped over to the side of the bed.
"You don't have to do this, you know. You don't have to...be with me."
Harry  nodded, his face pale. "This is a bit different, but it's still—oh,
Harry comes back around the sofa to sit, smiling happily. “I’m just glad I’m getting the hang of it wandless. I think I’ll be able to do it nonverbally soon, too.”
"Kasper. Trust me."
Draco tilts his head back and sighs. Harry runs his hands through Draco's hair again, over his neck, down his shoulders, over his collarbone, then back up into his hair.
Which left the three men alone to clean up in tense silence.
"Come in, sir. I'll announce your arrival."
"My leg feels
Draco felt his own mouth curve up involuntarily. "Hello. Do you need any help with those?"
Harry sighed. "I really wish you and Ron would try and get along. I care about you both, and I don't want to have to choose between you. Please don't put me in that situation."
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Weasley chides. “That’s what the Stasis Charms are for. Besides, it’s not
Draco and Hermione exchanged a nervous look.
Draco looked right into her eyes as he answered, wanting her to know exactly how serious he was. "One of the books used the word 'bond.' And
Draco comes through the Floo and freezes in shock.
“I don’t think that had anything to do with introducing him to people,” Narcissa points out. “He wasn’t exactly…”
Harry laughed. "You really do have a bit of a power kink, don't you?"
"Miserable," Draco sniffs. "A little sleepy."
"Mhm."
A middle-aged man with sandy blond hair pushed the door open a crack and poked his head inside. "Is it alright if we come in, Christine?"
There’s a new toothbrush, still in it’s package, waiting on the counter for him. Draco uses it, trying very hard not to picture Harry sleeping naked and cursing himself when he can’t. It’s a visual he would very much like to see, and soon.
And in turn, Draco is startled by the pure fury in Harry's eyes, the crackle of his magic in the air, and even
"He's...I think he's fine. He's sleeping. But I..."
Draco Apparated to Wolf's Hollow the morning after he visited Harry, and immediately wished he'd come sooner.
"I didn't do anything to him! And he was being a complete arse! I've done nothing but care about and help Harry since things started between us. I've already apologized to Weasley for my past behavior, I've been polite to him all these years when we've come in contact through my friendship with you, yet somehow I'm

"So..." Hermione began awkwardly. "How are things?"
Draco lays Harry's hand on his stomach, gently extricating his own fingers, and pulls the covers up over both Harry and Teddy.
breathes out incredulously. "I'm not going to fuck either of them!"
Harry watched him closely, curious where this conversation was going.
Harry had explained, sitting at the end of Draco's bed, shaking and clutching his knees to his chest, about how he knew, he
“Violet is already asleep,” she says softly, “she must be so tired. It’s been a long day.”
"Blaise and Pansy too," Draco adds softly. "I don't begrudge them for it, nauseating as it is. But there's no one else—no one to talk to when they're off...doing whatever they do. "
"Then you'll

was so powerful it knocked both men off their feet, ropes binding them from their necks all the way to their ankles, their wands flying through the air into Harry's outstretched hand.
"That Potter fucked him," The other Auror says impatiently. "
"Harry—"
"Gentlemen, this is my daughter Marie and my husband, Lewis."
And Draco was still shocked at just how quickly 'Potter' had become 'Harry.'
Harry storms into their flat after work. Eyes flashing behind his glasses, ornate crimson robes billowing behind him, looking as imposing as Draco has ever seen him. He's not entirely pleased by the physical reaction his body has to the sight.
Harry pulled Draco close and kissed him gently. He shuddered as he fought back tears, burying his face in Harry's neck.
Draco rolled over and reached out and his hand ran over cold sheets. His fiancé wasn't in the bed with him. Yawning, he climbed out of bed and threw on a discarded shirt from the floor. Harry's shirt, by the smell of it.
“Draco!”
“What happened?” Draco asks, dropping into the chair nearest Harry’s bed.
"Draco?"
“How are you holding up?” He asks, in a surprisingly kind voice.
“And they’d like it to stay that way,” I murmur, tracing his collarbone with a finger.
"Salazar, you're killing me," he finally managed between kisses. "Let's go upstairs."
with me
“Right,” Draco sighs. “Sorry, I should have listened to you. I’d appreciate the help. And I
Paul shrugs and shakes his head. “I’m not. I just think we both deserve to be happy. And for you, that’s with Harry. Watching the two of you, the way you are with each other…Draco, you
“You didn’t have to agree so readily!”
"Much of my personal beliefs have been suppressed throughout the years, Draco. First by fear of my family, with their hatefulness and severity...I saw what they did to Andromeda when she broke the mould. Then in fear of how your father would react if I ever revealed myself to be anything less than the perfect Pureblood wife. We loved each other deeply, you must understand, especially in the beginning. I never feared his wrath, but I desperately feared his rejection. I loved him too much.
Harry chuckles softly. “I used Protective Spells before any of them came near me, and multiple Cleansing Spells before coming home. The problem happens when no one knows there’s an outbreak yet, and it spreads like mad. You’re safe.”
"Come to finish the job, Potter?" Draco asks, a hint of challenge in his eyes.
“Paul,” the man says by way of introduction. “Paul Dalton.”
“I know,” Draco says as gently as he can. “Harry, it’s okay.”
Harry nodded, looking at the floor. "I panicked. I'm sorry."
Ron was still staring intently at Draco, his fists clenched and his face pale, making his freckles even more prominent than usual.
"Will do."
“‘We’re
Harry softened, reaching out to put a hand on Ron's arm. "It's okay. I didn't either, until he told me. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped at you."
"I was unhappy with the results of the challenge," Kasper said. "You were aware of that, I'm sure."
•••••
“I’ll get you some water,” Draco says, unsure what else to do.
Somehow, intuitively, Harry knew the child was Greyback's. It made sense—he already knew that Nadine had been Greyback's mate. He also knew that, as the Alpha, he could expel them both from the pack and no one would question his decision for a second. The pleading in Nadine's eyes was heartbreaking, her fear of him almost palpable, hanging heavy in the air as he looked at them.
“It’s okay, Draco, it’s okay, I’m okay.”
Draco grinned and stepped forward to hug her. "Pansy! It's so good to see you."
“Remember the first time we met here?” Harry asks, as Madam Malkin measures Teddy for his school robes.
"You're mine until wedding time tomorrow!" Pansy grabbed him by the arm. "Say goodbye to your handsome future husband until then!"
They lay there in silence for a little while, catching their breath and smiling softly at each other. Draco rolls over and drapes himself over Harry, kissing his shoulder.
Harry nods and smiles shakily. “I will.”
"But...he was going to come here after work," Hermione said desperately, "he was going to check on you, I thought he just lost track of time here, but then he didn't come home at all last night."
Draco remembers the piece of parchment Potter had been holding when he dropped Teddy off, and immediately feels a rush of guilt and annoyance, both at Potter and himself. “What did the Mind Healer
He steps closer and cups my face in his palms again, and I feel the slightest glimmer of hope fluttering desperately in my chest. "You tried to tell me. To explain."
Draco raises a skeptical eyebrow. “Are you joking? You’ll do fine. You’ve been an Auror for the past few years. A relatively competent one, as far as I know,” he teases, and Harry rolls his eyes at him. “Which subjects do the exams cover?”
Harry sighed and nodded. "Don't move, I'll be right back."
Harry was barely containing his temper now. "Let me go. I need to get out of here."
Draco adapted quickly and began running his hands in soothing circles over Harry's back instead.
“Fuck ‘em,” Harry says, immediately and emphatically, and Draco laughs. “We can just live our life and let them speculate wildly, like they’ve always done. We can set things straight if necessary, but they’re used to seeing us together by now, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
"Gross. Release me this instant, you brute. I need a shower!"
Draco shuddered. He was familiar with the pain of Cruciatus, and it was excruciating, so for Transformation to be even
She laughed, but let up on the physical assault in the name of safety. "Evan asked if we could meet tomorrow morning. Does that work for you? I don't want to meet with him without your support."
“How are the classes at the hospital?” Draco sits down with a groan and sets his glass on the coffee table, bringing a hand up to rub his neck.
." He held up a brightly-colored ball that had seemingly appeared inside his pocket. It rattled noisily when he moved it.
"Harry's awake!" Thomas shouted excitedly in the kitchen. "Can I go tell him breakfast is ready?"
"But... The Daily Prophet said that Harry killed Greyback?"
Draco's heart aches again, but he shoves the feeling away.
Draco bit back a laugh as he watched the warring expressions on Harry's face. He

"Yes," Draco smirked. "Why?"
"If I

He gave up and curled onto his side in the fetal position, a pitiful whimper escaping his lips without permission.
"Now say Dray-co."

“He threatened you,” he blurts.
to help. Then see how you feel. Can you at least do that?"
Harry staggered back, his hands gripping tightly onto Draco's arms as he looked into his face. "What are you saying?"
At this, Harry doubles over, laughing so hard he starts to wheeze, while Draco folds his arms and glares at him until he regains control of himself.
"Is this how you dress...all the time?" He asked.
"Promise. Just the thought of being apart for a few weeks after we get off the train is torture."
when he Apparates away in the distance.
"You were," she agreed, attempting to keep a straight face, "I'm glad he was able to convince you."
“Sure.”
“You sure you don’t want to Hex him?” Harry asks, watching as Draco considers for a moment before shaking his head. He turns his glare back on Brandon. “Then get out.”
“So letting her think we’re a couple is a
Let them wonder and mutter to each other that he was losing his mind. What other explanation could there be for their Senior Auror to transform, seemingly without reason, from generally cheerful and personable to querulous and sullen in the short course of six months?
Both Draco and Hermione had turned to gape at him.
“Spoken like a true Slytherin,” Harry snickers, sliding an arm around Draco’s waist and leaning against his shoulder.
"What?"
to fall asleep like that, still fully-dressed in his school robes...but he does.
Leading him by the hand, Harry guides him over to the nearby church, through the kissing gate, and into the cemetery that stretches out behind it. He confidently takes him to the place where his parents are buried, and Draco swallows nervously, glancing over at Harry's face.
"Mum, wait!"
She took a deep breath. "Alright, then. So... You know Harry?"
And I lie down against his shoulder, wrapping an arm over his chest, pulling the covers back over us, and letting warm contentment settle over me.
Teddy nods and leaves, glancing back nervously only once before disappearing up the stairs.
“You’ve been together for a while,” Draco presses, morbidly curious.
Harry’s eyes are wet when he looks at Draco again. “They took me in as a baby, but they didn’t...they
Draco leans over to kiss him. "You were adorable."
They heard a knock at the front door, and Harry lit up. "They're here!"
"Don't think about that," Draco chided softly. "It won't do any good. Come on, come back to bed, darling. You're exhausted."

With a resigned sigh, she stepped forward and gently shook Harry's shoulder.
“Draco is going to make sure I get home alright, don’t worry.”
“I’m ten now, Dad. I’m not blind, you know, I’ve seen how you look at him. I’ve seen how he looks at you. He hasn’t dated anyone seriously in
Draco knelt and took the young boy's hands, trying to explain. "Ron and I will be back soon. Hermione and Jenkins will take care of you, okay?"
Ginny reaches out to set a hand over his. “I think Paul is right,” she says gently, “it’s time to tell Harry how you feel. Knowing your history, I'm even more convinced that it will go well. You and Harry belong together, everyone can see that. I'm pretty sure Mum would throw the party of the century if you finally got together."
Harry closes the album and shrinks and tucks it back into his coat pocket, getting to his feet and pulling Draco up after him.
Harry shrugs. “You okay, kid?”

Draco flung his arms around him, fully expecting to be pushed away, but instead Harry broke down, sobbing into Draco's shoulder. Draco held him and cried with him, rubbing his back and carding his fingers through his hair, murmuring soothing words as his own heart broke over and over.
Harry shrugged. "Doesn't matter. I have a boyfriend, I'm not interested in anyone else."
being presumptuous and rude—"
A thrill runs down his spine at the thought as he opens a cupboard and finds the glasses. He fills one with an Aguamenti Charm and walks back over to Harry.
•••••
Harry carries him to the Floo and obediently takes them through. Harry shifts his grip on Draco's arse and walks them down the hallway toward their bedroom, gasping when Draco bites his ear sharply. "Fuck, Harry. You're so fucking hot."
a voice in Draco’s head screams,

"I mean, several werewolves have tried, and they've all—"
She kept her gaze locked on the ground.
,” I whine.
“Pretend I’m not in love with you.”
He’s cast a Cleansing Charm over himself while he was gone, Draco notices, all evidence of eyeliner and body glitter neatly removed.
Harry stares at him, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging slightly open.
After an hour of browsing, Harry had gathered a couple of books on werewolf bonding, culture and etiquette, history, and was searching for one that detailed the challenge ritual when he sensed another werewolf entering the room.
," Harry muttered.
Harry has been avoiding him. In fact, he hasn’t seen Harry once since Ginny’s birthday. He’d owled over the last two Sundays, excusing himself from Sunday dinners with Draco and Teddy without explanation. He showed up in the papers with Derek the next day each time, however, so it wasn’t hard to figure out where he’d been. If Harry had been out to make a point, he’d made it.
Draco found him an hour later, putting the finishing touches on the meal and singing along with the wireless. He was still wearing just his joggers, his tattoos moving across his skin.
“Ginny,
"Hi Nadine."
Ron knocked softly on the door and pushed it open. "Malfoy?"
“It was no problem,” Harry smiles. “You did a great job with the party—everyone had a fantastic time. Especially Teddy.”
Draco groaned and pulled him down into another searing kiss.
"Right," Harry frowns. "I guess I'll just see you out on the pitch, then."
him." Draco sniffled, fighting back an angry sob.
"No, we never moved past fully-clothed snogging," Harry brushes his lips against Draco's temple. "This is all new to me, too."
Draco pulls them down, then wraps a hand around Harry's cock, feeling a surge of pride at the truly rapturous expression this act elicits.
"Harry, wait." Draco pulls back. "Aren't you mad at me?"
“I’ll go with you,” Draco hears himself offer without thinking. “I mean, if you want.”
She moved to the edge of the bed. "Do you need anything? Food? Water?"
bloody
"Heartbreak again."
Healer Gordon sighed. "Well, your skin is healed. That's a good sign. How does it feel?"
"If you could bring your children here for school?"
He snapped his fingers and a Tempus Charm flashed the time— Red numbers and letters in the dark: 2:37 AM.

Draco
"No, I mean—I do. Like you, I mean. But I also—" Harry sucks in a breath, pushes his glasses up to rub his face, then blurts. "
. How is he supposed to survive working in the same building when the very sight of him makes Draco want to break down?
Twenty minutes later, they were all seated around the table, preparing to eat when an unexpected guest came breezing into the kitchen.
“You’re going to depress me with some horrible new piece of information about your childhood, aren’t you?” Draco says before he can continue.
"Mad at you?" Harry looks incredulous. "Why would I be mad at you? That was the hottest thing I've ever seen!"
•••••
spell was used, it's hard to tell. It's not a standard Obliviate, I know that much, it's something more complex than that. Where's Draco? I thought he'd be with you, and I was hoping to get his advice about this—"
"Nightmare, or the wolves again?"
Draco chuckled softly and leaned back in, brushing his lips against Harrys. "What can I say? I didn't handle my crush well. You already know that."
“Chinese!” Teddy takes his broom upstairs with him and after a few seconds they hear the shower turn on.
Kasper had moved to block both Harry and Draco in an undeniably protective stance. Draco walked around him, his wand raised.
Harry rolls his eyes and gives his hand a squeeze. “You still need something for Teddy, right? Let’s try Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, you know they’ll have something for him.”
"Will you just go see what that blasted owl wants so we can get back to it?"
I mentally slap myself and drop my Shield, putting my wand away.
"What do
"That's ridiculous! Does he really think that I'd feel any different... It wasn't his fault! And it's not like he's a completely different person, right?"

"Morning," Harry murmured, rubbing at his eyes and stifling a yawn.
After a few long, perfect moments, Harry brought the kiss to a close, drawing back and smiling at Draco in a way that made him go a bit weak in the knees.
, Mr. Potter. Then up to bed with you," Madam Pomfrey says sternly before disappearing into her office.
Harry laughed. "Thanks, Lewis."
it was too soon—and now he's been burned and it's
Harry scoffs, looking amused.
"I can't tell you that. It's not my—"
Harry returns with breakfast and Pain-Relief and Hydration Potions, and he barely leaves Draco's side all weekend. He brings endless bowls of chicken noodle soup from the kitchen, and forces Draco to rest, reading his notes to him and quizzing him when he insists on studying in spite of his illness.
His hair has been nothing but turquoise-colored since he came under his care, and Draco suddenly wants to strangle Harry Potter with his bare hands, ice cream shop full of witnesses be damned.
." Hermione muttered into her wine glass before taking a sip, her mouth curving into an amused smile.
Harry kissed him softly, slowly, letting their lips brush over and over– warm, familiar, perfect. Harry caught Draco's lower lip between his teeth and tugged, drawing a low moan out of him that thrilled him to his core. Draco still liked that, then.
They opened a bottle of red wine after dinner, Pansy's contribution to the meal, and moved to the sitting room where three of them relaxed on the sofas with their glasses.
Harry chatted easily with anyone who sat nearby, and happily drank cocoa, his arm slung over the back of Draco's chair. He held Draco's hand, and turned to smile at him every once in a while, as if just checking to make sure he was still there, and looking absolutely thrilled every time that he was.
Harry swallowed and nodded. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
"Romania?" I ask in a small voice, as my thoughts immediately begin to spiral out of control. Of

Harry ignores him. “I have to say, I was a little surprised, though. You never mentioned he was so…”
“Maybe not right now, but you might go back to Hogwarts in a few months and start seeing someone you’ve always known in a different way, or maybe you’ll focus on your studies and meet someone new after Hogwarts. You never know how things can change.”
Hours later, the four of them were still in Harry's hospital room. Draco had climbed up onto the bed between Harry and the wall and promptly fallen asleep, his head on Harry's shoulder, an arm draped over his waist.
what it felt like?"
"It's only for when you have to be on your feet for a long time," the Healer said gently. "If you take it, I can discharge you today."
A wave of nausea crashes over me. Words are tumbling out of my mouth before I even fully realize what I’m saying. “I couldn’t stand to be here, Draco. I left a few days before your wedding. I—I went to—Godric, anywhere I could think of—Romania. Bulgaria. France. Australia to stay with Ron and Hermione for a few months, and then I volunteered to go take a training course at MACUSA for ten months that Robards wants to try and implement here for new trainees...”
But guilt coils, hot and twisting in my gut, as I remind myself that Draco isn’t mine to kiss like this, not anymore. I shouldn’t be kissing him. He’s married, for fuck’s sake. I
He sighed. "How do you even
He stayed there, listening to Harry's agonized cries as they turned into wolfish whines and low, distressed howls, hot tears trailing down his cheeks.
oblivious...”
Draco relaxes slightly, but he’s still annoyed. “I still don’t understand why you felt you had to keep it from me.”
He looks guilty and awkward and Draco absolutely hates it.
Before Draco can fully process what he means, Harry has rolled out of bed, pulled on his trainers, and slipped from the room.
This hurts more than I could possibly put into words.
"Hawwy!"
"It's okay, Harry. I understand." Draco turns away again, heart pounding painfully against his chest.
my mother’s method though.”
The door opens, and several Aurors enter the large bathroom and make their way over to the urinals.
“I can watch him,” Marc offers, looking put out at not getting to finish his finance lecture.
The force of that realization hit him like a ton of bricks.
Draco smiled, stroking his cheek. "You didn't. You
Draco smiled softly at him, "I love it. I'm never taking it off."
Draco retorted, lying back down against him, "I'm not leaving for
Ron shot an adoring smile at his wife. "That's genius!"
Harry nods. “Yeah, and a Locking Charm too, just to be safe. We’re going to be using those a lot this summer, I imagine.”

"When he was alive I would have visions that were, erm, a lot like this. I could feel his emotions then, too."
"What are you going to tell the wolf pack when you go see them tomorrow?" Draco asked.
No answer.
"Maybe."

"Not exactly. I just realized I hadn't seen you in hours and I missed you. I wanted to do
stay for dinner and a drink!” Potter begs immediately, widening his eyes and exaggerating his desperation just a bit.
Draco stares at him for a second. “Are you alright?”
"What's going on?" Ron had come up behind the man, two tumblers of firewhisky in his hands.
"It's not like you pushed me—I tripped! It was just an accident!"
while you went on to shag anything that moved for the next year and a half before you, what? Finally landed on
The next morning, Healer Gordon watched with her arms folded as Harry swung his legs over the side of the bed and attempted to stand. He was successful for a few seconds, but his injured leg gave out and he caught himself on the edge of the bed, carefully putting all his weight on his other leg. He cursed and flushed crimson.
Draco laughed aloud, remembering how he'd teased Harry that morning.
One Sunday evening at Grimmauld Place, they’re joined for dinner by the Granger-Weasley family.
Harry's brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of the conversation, and Draco noticed.
"Oh, don't get jealous, Malfoy. I'm with
Draco feels his heart swell, tears threatening to fall again. "I do trust you, Harry. I know you wouldn't be unfaithful, I know you better than that. But it's still really hard sometimes, the way people act around you. Like they think they have some claim on you, as their Savior."
Draco swallows before answering. “When I’m ready. When I feel that Teddy is ready. I’m not going to rush anything.”
He chuckled. "Nothing gets past you, does it?"
"Yeah," McDougal chuckled darkly. "I think we'll have to find you a nice cell in Azkaban for this. Maybe you can room next to your friend Potter, I hear his Wolfsbane hallucinations have been rather
Everyone else is outside, eating the picnic lunch that Molly prepared, watching the children run and play. Draco had just needed a moment away from it all, so he ventured inside and found himself here in the kitchen, watching from a distance.
"We need a Chief of Security at the Werewolf Sanctuary we're opening in a few weeks. I'm prepared to pay you more for your services, offer you more time off, better hours, whatever you want. Is that...something you'd be interested in?"
Draco reaches out and picks up the two vials of Hangover Potion waiting on the coffee table, passing one over.
"That bad?"
"I'm flattered Sofia, really I am, but I'm not interested. Sorry."
"Impossibly good looking, you mean," Draco retorts. His attempt at flirting dampened slightly by another sneeze.
“Good morning, Teddy,” Harry says mildly. “Would you like some pancakes?”
With a nervous glance at each other and a reassuring squeeze of the hand from Harry to Draco, they entered the Granger-Weasley residence.
"I don't know why," Harry said. "But I pretended to be weak until I knew I was strong enough to break through the wall and Apparate to the Ministry, and then I just...did."
"Hm. Guess you'll never know."
They'll be fine, because Draco will make sure they're fine.
Distantly, he registers Harry’s own cry of pleasure, the pulse of his cock inside him as he releases. After a long moment, Draco slides off of him and drops onto the pillow beside him.
He fought a smile as he rolled a train across the floor and pretended to crash it into another, making loud explosion noises, much to Thomas's delight.
Draco and Ron had finally found him several hours later, holed up in a corner at the Hogs Head, apparently attempting to drown himself in firewhisky. Draco had taken him home, his expression a carefully blank mask. As someone who had (albeit reluctantly) become his friend, Ron had found it disconcerting.
Draco hums in agreement, brushing a kiss over his jaw. “Are you coming back up to bed with me now, or do you need to brood in front of the fire for a while longer?”
you can’t stay for tea?” Lottie says, “we were just getting to know each other.”
," the elf said sympathetically, seemingly completely unfazed by Harry's appearance, "you is needing help into bed?"
“This isn’t about us, or what we want,” Harry says, giving Draco a longing look that makes his chest ache. “We have to put Teddy first.”
Draco is a perfectly competent caregiver, Teddy has stayed with him dozens of times before, and the last thing he wants is to hear Potter prattle on with
Draco can’t help wondering if Harry takes after his mother. If maybe, just maybe, he might be able to love someone he’d once hated, too.
Disappointment flashes over Harry's face, and something shutters in his eyes. "Oh. Right. Well, that's fine." Harry forces a weak smile. "Okay."
Harry chuckled softly. "Come on, you possessive, masochistic,
"Excellent," Potter answered with a cheeky grin, and for the briefest of seconds the Glamour hiding the numerous love bites on his neck fell away before snapping back into place. Weasley laughed. Potter grinned and winked at the gawking Juniors. "Let's get back to work, shall we?"
Draco nodded.
"Oh for Godric's sake," Hermione muttered. And conjured a teething biscuit and pressed it into the baby's hands, quieting her immediately. "I'm sorry darling, daddy will be back with more food for you," she cooed, as Rose sniffled and nibbled on her biscuit, looking mollified.
Harry froze. "I'm not sure that's a good idea. I mean, I haven't—"
An hour after the previous nerve-wracking meeting, Harry found himself mentally preparing for another one. He stood outside the small house and forced himself to knock on the cheery yellow front door.

"How are you feeling?" Harry asked.
"Harry and
Harry rolled his eyes but complied, only pulling on pants and soft joggers while Draco got fully dressed.
“It’s okay, Harry.”
Harry stroked a hand through his hair and cast a Cleaning Charm over them both with a snap of his fingers. "I love you, too."
"They'll do some training first," Ron said. "And he's already an accomplished Occlumens, so—"
“I’m alright, Draco. Actually, I feel pretty great. Were you up all night perfecting that new potion again?” Harry gives him a knowing smile and sets his hands on Draco’s waist, swaying them gently back and forth.
Harry watched Evan and his Pack members as they stood awkwardly in front of the fireplace.
, yes,” Draco responds curtly, pulling Harry up by the hand. He knows exactly how the situation is being interpreted, but he can’t bring himself to care. “Grab a box, Harry. The car is waiting.”
,” Harry glances over at Draco, who smiles weakly and shrugs, before focusing on Teddy again.
"Warmer," Draco murmured.
“Paul! Erm, hi, this is a pleasant surprise.”
Harry slowly opened his eyes to meet Draco's concerned gaze.
you. You shouldn't be here." Harry turned his face into his pillow, his stomach churning at the thought.
Harry walked up the path, looking up at the enormous house as he approached. It looked much the same as it had the last time he'd been there—when Voldemort had lived inside its walls—but the gardens were brighter, better kept.
"So you
"Are you ready to try standing again?" The Healer said gently. "I brought a dose of Muscle Strengthening Potion that should help. Why don't I leave it here on the table for you and come back in ten minutes? Give you a moment to wake up?"
Harry walked into the Granger-Weasleys the next day to find Hermione huddled over their kitchen table, several books spread out in front of her. Ron was sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace, playing with Rose, both of them focused intently on a large wooden puzzle.
Harry shook his head and flipped the bacon in the pan. "Not really. This is what the laws are for, right? To prevent wizards from interfering in the lives of magical creatures? Hermione and Kingsley aren't going to let them mess about with that, it would undo over a hundred years of progress."
•••••
Draco looks down at his half-full container. “How in Merlin’s...you eat really fast.”
“Okay,” Teddy bolts up the stairs, giving Draco a trusting smile over his shoulder at the top of the staircase.
Draco tells him about Paul, about what he’d said when he left. Harry talks about how much he hated seeing Draco with anyone else, about how sure he was that he’d moved on, about how he’d tried to be satisfied with their close friendship, sure that that was all that could ever be between them. Draco eases the jealousy on Harry’s face by telling him about David, his face burning.
Harry comes back with clean pajamas and boxers and helps Draco into them, then leads him over to the bed and under the covers.
, darling. I mean, he was nice and all, but he was really very—”
"You mean you're too proud."
Draco inhales sharply, leaning back to examine his expression. "How do you know?"
Draco had been startled when Harry had rolled on top of him and crushed their mouths together, but he quickly leaned into it, tasting the salt from Harry's tears and the desperation in his kiss. Eager to provide whatever comfort he could, Draco responded with fervor. They were soon kissing ferociously, hands roaming freely, both moaning breathlessly, the motions and physical responses pleasantly familiar.
Draco smiled and kissed his forehead. "First food, then sleep. Okay?"
"What do you mean?"
"Hermione? What's wrong?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay." Harry's eyes drift closed for a moment before he forces them open again, lightly squeezing Draco's fingers. "Draco?"
Harry nodded, not at all surprised by this response. "I'll agree to a Fight to the Death. I have just one request."
"Do you want something to drink? Tea, Butterbeer, Firewhisky?"
Harry swallowed, struggling to speak, shaking his head slightly in response before he forced the words out. "Need to Apparate. Wolf Pack."
Ron tells Draco about the raid of an underground goblin fighting ring. Wizards, forcing the goblins to fight for their entertainment. The duel was one of the worst he had ever seen, with some of the darkest magic. One of the younger Aurors miscast his Shield Charm and Harry, bloody

"Hey, Rosie," Hermione cut in with a teasing grin, "Say Harry."
Ron visibly shuddered at this. "She saved your life."
"I'm just teasing. I don't mind."
“No, no. It’s okay. I just don’t know. I know he couldn’t tell us about the magic, the secrecy statute and all, but I wish—he let his parents tell so many lies about you, about how you were treated, and he could have told me the truth any time, but he chose not to. I don’t...I still love him. He’s my husband, and we have—had—such a good relationship, before—”
A week later, Ron and Harry made plans to have a drink together at Grimmauld Place, "like the good old days," Ron had said.
"Nadine. And Thomas." Nadine had thick, curly red hair, hazel eyes, and freckled skin. She looked like she was in her late thirties. Tight curls aside, she almost looked like a Weasley.
"I don't know," Harry sighed. "I'm sure he's guessed that I'm seeing someone, but we don't talk about it because—"
Draco smiles at the door as it closes behind him and he can hear Harry saying goodbye to Marie on his way out.
"I know you are," Draco cut her off, "I know. But Rosie needs you. Weasley, too. I won't risk it, Hermione. Not a chance. I'll be in contact as soon as possible, I promise."
The elf glanced at Draco, who shook his head.

that look. With their family resemblance and same warm brown eyes, it’s almost exactly like the look Charlie continually gave me while I was in Romania last year, except Ginny’s eyes don’t have the hope and longing in them that Charlie’s had, and I don’t have to worry about being an arse and crushing her heart. Charlie had tried to kiss me before I left, and I’d burned him with some accidental wandless magic to prevent it from happening. Burns don’t really faze Charlie, but the pain and rejection in his eyes still haunt me and the memory makes my stomach twist.
Kingsley pronounced them married, and Harry

So why does Draco’s heart feel like it’s shattering into a million pieces?

. Draco has had a crush on you for a very long time. Since we were children, in fact. It was always 'Harry Potter this, and Harry Potter that. What do you think he looks like, Pansy? I bet he's handsome. I bet he's powerful since he defeated the Dark Lord as a baby, he probably knows every spell already. Blah blah blah.' And then when you rejected his handshake on the train, oh
Harry nodded and followed Kasper into the Library.

"Here, I can help." Draco slowly pulled out his wand.
“What the
"Why is it always you three?" Kingsley asked when he finally got a moment to breath. "You've saved the day, as usual."
“I couldn’t get rid of it,” I say softly as he reaches out to touch, turning my head and brushing my lips over his wrist. “I wanted to, but I could never bring myself to do it.”
win that bet. I should have picked something embarrassing, but I couldn’t resist making him get the Horntail.”
Ginny points at someone across the room, and Harry follows her finger with his gaze, then looks down at her with a skeptical expression and shakes his head.
"You might if your Aurors Stun me."
Draco moves to wrap his arms around him, and Harry squeezes him tight. “It’ll be okay, Draco.”
“Just needs to simmer for a few minutes, but I think it’s done,” he says with a smile.
"I need to go, love," Harry chided softly.
After a few minutes, Harry looks over at him and gives him a smile that can only be described as breathtaking. “Thanks, Draco.”
"I'm afraid with the Aconite in your system your presence would incense all of the other wolves. You'd better stay in your room."
"Does sir need anything else? Food? Water?"
Harry mulled over the words he'd said as he Apparated home, smiling to himself.
"I do care. I'm sorry," Harry repeats, squeezing him tightly. "I love you. I'm sorry."
"Sorry. But it's a decent size. I thought maybe if I cleaned it up, added some new lighting, maybe some magical windows to brighten things, It might make a pretty good potions lab..."
“Babe, where do you keep your sugar? Oh. Hello, you must be Harry.”
"Well, no. But Draco and I have been researching—"
•••••
“Fuck you.”
"Erm. Help. With a case. Robards is insisting we need help from your department, because the magic is really old or something, and—"
Harry shook his head. "No, I'm not coming back."
"Your impressions are fantastic. You had everyone in the Common Room laughing the other night doing impressions of the teachers. Even Ron couldn't stop talking about how funny it was."
Hesitantly, Draco turned the handle and pushed the door open. The dark green curtains had been drawn, and the fireplace was empty, making the room dark and ice-cold. He could make out Harry's sleeping form tucked under the covers of the large bed, an untouched tray of food on the bedside table. He was unusually still, and shivering slightly under the covers.
“Always knew you were smart,” Harry laughs. “Although maybe that makes you a Ravenclaw...”
"I know."
Draco shifted and kissed Harry's cheek, then the back of his neck, trailing his hands down his sides and then slipping them up his shirt to trace over his stomach.
Harry steps back to look into Draco's eyes. "Do you? Want more with me?"
is how you treat the Savior of the Wizarding World?" He spat at the guards. "
“I don’t intend to let you kiss anyone else ever again.” He attempts an intimidating growl, but the soft smile on his face makes it clear he’s teasing.
Harry takes a shaky breath and gives Draco’s hand a squeeze before letting go. “Thanks, but I’m okay. Let’s go in.”
Before leaving for the afternoon, Healer Gordon paused at the door. "Harry?"
Hypocritical words, coming from him, and the look Harry gives him makes it clear he’s thinking it too, even if he doesn’t disagree with what Draco said.
She broke down, crying quietly into her hands.
Draco looks up from his careful brewing after casting a hasty Stasis Spell. “Yes?”
"I'm sorry," Harry had whispered when he saw that Draco was awake.
Narcissa pulled out her wand and gave it a wave, and a pile of colorful parchments appeared in her hand.
he tells himself. Teddy is undoubtedly having fun with his grandmother, and Draco himself has been in a foul mood for days. Being alone for a few hours is definitely a good thing for him. Unfortunately, that also means being alone with his tumultuous thoughts, with no distractions to numb the pain.
Draco swallowed. "Azkaban. Pumped full of Wolfsbane."
"I wanted to tear him apart," Harry growls. "Take your clothes off and claim you right there in front of everyone. Mark your skin with my teeth so everyone would know you're
She'd been the person he'd first come out to, during that eighth year, and her support had meant everything to him. It still did.
The boy was curled up in a corner of one of the cells, sobbing softly and watching in terror as Grace attempted to murder his mother.
Draco levitated Grace into one of the cells and closed and locked the door with the key, then reinforced the locks with magic, just to be safe. Situation defused, he turned toward the other wolves. Laith was kneeling beside Sofia in the stairwell, while Nadine and Thomas clutched each other tightly in the center of the room.
sweetheart. This isn't your fault."
Nadine smiled encouragingly.
"Thank you," Harry murmured as he closed his eyes, the exhaustion of the last few weeks taking over. "Love you."
. He's unstable, he could
George blushed when Harry held out a hand for him to shake. "Thank you, Mr. Potter."
But the sight of Charlie Weasley approaching Harry in the kitchen where Harry was cleaning up some dishes to help Hermione, the redhead touching his shoulder and giving him a bright smile and asking how he was doing,
"Marry me, Draco."
Harry’s fault,” Draco wipes at his own eyes with the back of his hand. “He was worried about hurting you, and he’s impossibly noble, you know.
He takes a half day and goes home, exhausted and brokenhearted.
Draco whispers.

Draco nods. “Good luck.”
"No. He doesn't call me Harry, I don't call him Parker. Hell, I forgot his first name even
Draco reminds himself, considers for a moment. “Sometimes I have to work late on Fridays. What about Sundays?”
The words are familiar. My memory flicks back to our first time, just over four years ago. Has it really been that long?
Hermione smiled weakly, wiping at her eyes.
, now that he's off the Suppressant Potions that hid his Veela blood
"Draco!" Hermione screeched, her voice rising an entire octave as she stared at him in horror.
"Because they're your friends and they haven't seen you in six months and they missed you?" Harry laughed, pulling on a pair of jeans.
“It was even better,” Harry grins and opens his own container to eat with him. “So, how did it go last night?”
Draco tries to shake off his unease.
“This,” Draco waves a hand. “Us. I mean...we’re
much. I couldn't live with myself if something happened to you because of me."
Draco nipped at his ear as Harry cast hasty Stasis Charms on the food and spun around in his arms.
Davis lets himself into Harry's office the next day, and Harry has to resist the urge to throw something at him.
Harry didn't answer, as his mouth had run dry at the sight of Draco stretching unabashedly on the bed, all long limbs and smooth pale skin. He swallowed hard. Draco smiled even wider when he caught him looking. He quickly adopted an innocent expression, but there was no masking the mischievous glint in his eyes.
He opened his eyes, and the forest spun around him. Squeezing them tightly shut, he took a deep breath and tried again.
Harry closes his eyes for a moment, as if steeling himself, and then he opens them and leans in. “Me too, Draco.”
“It wasn’t.”
"Hello, ma'am. I'm Draco. This is—"
Draco watches as the families around them say goodbye to their children.
"You've never had a fever before?"
Harry nodded.
The executor clears his throat. "Right. So now we just need to decide who he's going home with for the coming month."
Draco took them from her and tucked in gratefully, the discomfort in his stomach easing with each bite.
Draco sighed again, then shook his head. "No, I'm not."
"That would be a shame. Surviving the Dark Lord only to die at the hands of
to find the right spell to undo it. And Dorian was beside himself the whole time, poor kid.”
kicking us out. Lorcan would force us to leave, if given the chance."
Draco glanced over at him. From the tinge of red rising on Weasley's ears and spreading over his face, Draco knew he was about to witness his famous temper again, and he was infinitely grateful it wasn't directed at him, for once.
He poked his head into the room and froze in shock. Harry had just finished painting the walls a light grey, it looked like. A roller was set haphazardly on a nearby tray, and he was hammering the lid down on the half-full paint can, his clothes and dark hair spattered with the same shade.
Draco realized he was shaking, and suddenly he desperately needed to get out of there. He took a deep breath, spun on his heel, and walked towards the front door. "Regardless, it's the truth."
“Do you want to stay over?” Draco asks when they’re finished cleaning up after dinner.
Lorcan was smug and obnoxious, grinning and strutting around like it was all a big joke. This wasn't his first challenge, and he had yet to lose. He was completely confident he'd win again.
"Have you seen him? Since the change?"
Kasper nodded solemnly.
•••••
Harry’s eyes light up and he looks over at Draco. “What do you think?”
"That sounds amazing. And the Potions Mastery course? Was it as bad as you said?"
The group behind him nodded, and a baby in a woman's arms began to cry.

“So, when we met…”
"He didn't...he didn't come here last night?"
you?” Draco asks pointedly, inclining his head.
"I love you too," Harry answered without hesitation, even though the words were new, his eyes filled with so much warmth and devotion that it made Draco's heart beat faster. "So much, Draco."
"He's currently sedated, but the potion should be wearing off soon," the man said nervously as they walked, "The Healers have been working on his injured leg. It's not...we can fix the broken bones and heal the open wounds in a few days, but there's a chance it won't ever be quite...he

"Yes, sir," Jenkins repeated before Apparating away.
Harry gave his fingers another squeeze, suddenly grinning. "I'll go see my goddaughter and give her
"Shut up, you tosser," Draco snickered.
“I guess,” Teddy huffs, taking a seat at the table. He props his face on his hand and sullenly kicks at the table leg.

I'm hurtled painfully back to the present by Harry loudly clearing his throat. "
“He pushed me. That Spell, whatever it was, was meant for me.”
"Harry," Harry corrected him gently. "Anyone who saves my life can definitely call me Harry."
"Erm—"
"Hello Harry!"
wrong,” she turns to look at Harry again, tears glistening in her eyes. “Being back in that house must have been absolutely horrible for you. I don’t know how you managed to cross the threshold at all.”
. He's dating one of his teammates now. You know, it's okay to be on friendly terms with your exes, Draco."
"Well,
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry whispers back, and he seems just as reluctant to let go, but he finally does. “See you next week?”
On Monday morning, Draco consults with the Aurors about their case, as promised. The Aurors on the case are older, highly experienced, and surprisingly kind. Nothing like Jeffords and Davis. Draco can't help wondering if Harry purposely selected them because he knew they'd be easier for him to be around. Part of him hopes he did, that he still cares about Draco, even just a little bit.
Draco helped Harry up the stairs after the solemn funeral they held that evening. He filled the large bathtub in the Alpha suite with hot water and followed him in. Harry let Draco shampoo his hair and wash his body until the filth of the past two weeks was gone, dissipating into the magic-infused water.
The words come out sharper than Draco intended, but Harry doesn’t react other than to sigh and sink further into the sofa cushions, getting comfortable.
She shook her head. "I don't remember much, and it's fuzzy, but I remember watching you fight...you were so brave Harry, and you tried so hard, but he was going to kill you. I remember wanting desperately to help you, to protect you and to protect Thomas. But I don't know
When Harry slipped a thigh between his legs and pressed forward, Draco groaned and pulled him into a deeper kiss.
. They're probably back together now, and they'll get married so he can be part of his stupid surrogate family of gingers for real, and they'll adopt a dozen freckly ginger babies to raise together, and I'll be miserable and alone in my stupid fucking mansion and nothing will ever be good again...
, Draco thinks uncharitably, taking a sip of his wine. “How so?”
Ron could
Harry grinned. "Remember how I told you I'd make you a potions lab in this cellar?"
He cringes at the unmistakable sounds of kissing when they reach him: lips smacking, a low, muffled groan, a gasp, a sucking noise, a breathy, feminine giggle that sounds like Harry’s name. More kissing.
Harry tries to cover another laugh with his fist, snorting inelegantly into his hand. "Alright, let's get you in the tub."
He's clutching the window frame behind his desk, knuckles white, breathing shakily.
Draco swished his wand, and Harry became significantly lighter. He wrapped an arm around Harry's waist and let him lean heavily against him as they walked.
"Take another nap," Harry murmurs, "I'm going to get dinner from the kitchen for us, and you can eat whenever you wake up, okay?"
The fluffy ending you've been waiting for. Just the epilogue left now. Thanks for reading!
him he's yours, Harry. That no one else can come along and take his place. It'll drive him mad if you don't."
"Okay. That doesn't mean you suddenly want to go look at broomsticks."
"Hm?"
"Ah," Ron answers for him, to Draco's relief. "Apparently you and I aren't the only ones to criticize Harry's current relationship and end up on his bad side."
"So, what's our next stop?"
Draco arched a brow. "I expect a proper proposal before I answer that. With a ring and a sufficiently soppy speech about how much you love me and can't live without me."
Harry stared into the Draco's eyes, barely hearing anything Kingsley was saying as he focused on the man he loved. Harry marveled at how much one small event could have changed his life, at how much one person had changed his life, even when he'd thought his life was over. Draco had changed everything, and Harry would forever be grateful that he did.
They spend most of the day in bed. Harry insists on getting up to make them a very late breakfast, but concedes when Draco insists on Apparating back upstairs with a tray as soon as the food is ready.
“You can still ask Ron and Hermione to go with you, if you’re more comfortable—“
"I think so," Draco found himself answering, grateful to have someone,
Harry was saved from answering by the new Head of Security tapping him urgently on the shoulder.
"I— " Pain spasms through my chest, as if the shards of my broken heart have lodged in my insides like shrapnel.
"I have," Harry said seriously. "I've got a whole pack, and most of them are really nice. Would you like to meet them, too?"
"Yes! I mean, no. Ron didn't come home last night. Could you...?"
Harry's
Draco knocks on the door to Grimmauld Place before promptly letting himself in. “Harry? Teddy?”
"Repeat what you just said, Malfoy," Weasley spat.
A large staircase near the front door leads up to what Draco can only imagine is Harry’s bedroom, probably a guest bedroom or two, and maybe a study. He hopes he’ll find out soon enough.
"Well I
, I actually thought…”
," Ron snapped, his voice low and furious. "By werewolf law, they're essentially married. By wizarding standards, they're engaged. Nothing will help Harry heal more than being in direct contact with Draco."
It wasn't that he
“You’re
“I surprised you with it,” I smile at the memory, “Got it during my lunch hour and came home with it after Auror training...”
She smiled. "Of course, Harry. We'll see you soon."
each other, but my grandmother made them share custody of me after she died and they
Harry looked around at the gathered werewolf pack, who were all staring at him with rapt attention.
Draco turns to look at Harry and Ron. "Harry, what—?"
Harry beams at that. Their friend groups have been slowly merging over the last few years, what with Blaise and Ginny getting married, and Draco and Hermione working together at the Ministry. It was really only a matter of time before they all started getting along.
"Alright."
"I am," Sofia smiled at Christine. "Thanks to you."
"Jenkins will go light a fire upstairs for you," the elf said softly before Apparating upstairs, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts.
Potter is standing next to a pretty young woman, clearly at the end of a date and on their way out. He smiles and introduces her to them as a ‘friend.’
Kasper glanced over his shoulder to give him a scrutinizing look.
“It’s...complicated,” Draco sighs. “I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”
Harry and Andromeda burst out laughing beside the stove where they had taken over cooking.
“I don’t know. I
Draco wakes to the sound of someone rustling around in the room, and the faint smell of eucalyptus that accompanies his husband’s healing magic and clings to his hair and robes lingers in the air.
"You're welcome." Harry bounced on the balls of his feet, still smiling wide, when his expression changed unexpectedly, and he caught himself on the door frame, breathing heavily. He turned fearful eyes on Draco, who stepped forward to catch him as another vision of the werewolves hit.
She tries again, this time landing on a sandy-haired blond who is eyeing Harry up from a seat at the bar.
Harry found the rest of the Pack in the communal kitchen later that afternoon, just starting to prepare dinner.
The healer jumped to her feet, wiping at her eyes. "Thank you. It just feels so nice to tell someone."
"Forest...."
. Draco pushes the thought away.
•••••
Harry gives him a grateful smile. “Thanks, Draco.”
He threw himself dramatically into a chair at the table beside her and ran a hand through his platinum blond hair.
Harry held his wine glass out for Pansy to clink hers against conspiratorially, and they drank in unison, eyes twinkling merrily.
Harry leaned down and whispered in her ear, and her eyes widened.
Nadine looked up at them and nodded. "The younger ones—Sofia and the twins, they joined the pack as children and never got them to begin with. They've never been trained to use magic. But Kasper, Grace, Lorcan, and I were all adult wizards and witches who had graduated from Hogwarts before we turned."
Draco pulled him into a tight embrace, and Harry buried his nose against his neck, breathing deeply. "I love you."
He sighed. "You've witnessed every other low point in my life, Potter, why not this one, too? Come in."
, Draco." She whispered the words, as if saying them quietly would make them any less horrible.
"I want to be here for you. Talk to me, Harry. Come on."
That strangely caustic person who lashed out, then panicked and broke down, was not the Harry Potter that he'd come to know. That he'd come to... Love. Oh
He gave her a startled look. "It's not that I don't
,” Draco says, but he inclines his head in acquiescence anyway.
The black man stepped aside with an exaggerated bow and a flourish of his hand. "As you wish, my liege. Your loss."
"You miss him."
"I can take care of myself. They just caught me unawares this time. It won't happen again."
Harry gaped at him for a moment. "I... It's not the full moon, you don't need to worry about..."
“You look good, Dudley.”
Draco takes in the sight of him. Harry’s face and chest are flushed, his lips swollen, his glasses askew and hair mussed. There’s a purple bruise blooming on his collarbone, and an obvious bulge in Harry’s jeans…
"Old Mrs. Kalinsky upstairs thought I was being murdered, yes," Draco laughed. "I spoke to her and explained as best I could. She's actually very nice, she lets me borrow her owl sometimes."
"Oh. I just invited him to dinner. He... I mean, I didn't expect him to accept, not
"Well, except maybe Auror Weasley. They're close, you know."
They talk about Quidditch for a long time, and Draco is horrified to realize that at some point he actually drifted off and leaned against Harry’s shoulder. He jerks away from him, his face heating. Harry gives him a kind smile, completely oblivious to Draco’s inner turmoil.
“So help me Harry, if you’re secretly…”
The backlash to Draco's transformation was as bad as he'd expected, if not worse. The Daily Prophet had a heyday. He was receiving daily Howlers from his father that screamed of his failure and the shame brought on the Malfoy name. His coworkers, who had never been inclined to like him much anyway, took to mocking him at every turn.
Harry reached out to brush his fingers over Draco's, and he took the invitation and intertwined their fingers together.
Draco clambers through the portrait hole, leaving a blustering Sir Cadogan to shout after him as the portrait swings closed, and looks around. "Harry?"
"He's resented me for years, but he's been pushing me to sleep with him ever since we learned that Fenrir was dead. He's never forgiven me for choosing Fenrir over him when we were younger. We were friends at Hogwarts, even before we were both bitten, but I just never felt the same way about him as he did for me.
Draco nods slowly, taking a sip of his wine. “I suppose that makes sense.”
"Good," Harry growled. "Because I don't share well."
Harry reached out and patted the bed beside him. The sheets were cold.
"Let me go change out of my work robes, and I will."
Harry raised his eyebrows.
a somewhat important occasion."
Draco makes a pot of tea, and Harry finds him in the kitchen, gratefully accepting a cup. Draco curls a protective arm around his waist as they drink, turning them both to face her when Lottie joins them.
Ron sent the beetle scuttling under the door with a flick of his wand, then tucked the earpiece in his ear, casually leaning against the wall as the beetle breached the edge of the Silencing Spell.
"Worse," Draco sighed. "I've also never been so stressed. It has a fifty percent pass rate—
"Hm. I
," she groaned.
“What?” Harry asks, turning away from watching Violet’s anxious parents help her lift her trunk onto the train. Ron and Hermione are fussing over Rose and Hugo behind them, waiting to send them up after so they can all find a compartment together.
They're neck and neck now, hands outstretched when the Snitch suddenly drops and darts away below them. Instead of attempting to turn his broom like Harry, Draco drops into a barrel roll, hand still reaching out, and when he comes back up he has the golden ball clutched in his fist and a triumphant look on his face.
“I’m starting to think it’s just not...it’s not meant to be,” Draco says softly. “Maybe he doesn’t feel the same way anymore. It’s been a long time.”
"Straight to bed with you."
"Dray?"
Nadine looked sad, and slightly ashamed. "We're used to more...
for me,” Draco drawls, rolling his eyes.
Draco's eyes get a wicked glint in them and Harry groans internally, but all Draco does is touch an index finger to his cheek and tap it expectantly.
With a running jump, he pounced on top of Draco, bracing himself on his hands and knees above him, who grinned triumphantly up at him.
"I hated him, Andy. Voldemort, I mean. I wanted him dead. But I wasn't brave, I just wanted to get to Draco. I just wanted my baby, and you lost yours that day, your Nymphadora. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Chest heaving, Draco let out one last scream before sinking to the floor, shaking a bit in the face of the magnitude of what he'd just done. He let out a hysterical sob and began to laugh.
“I just
‘Why?”
He closes the door behind himself, presumably to let Draco change, and also hyperventilate, in peace.
Well, this got away from me. It's much longer than I originally planned, but hopefully no one minds.
Draco stepped toward him. "Why not?"
"Now that you're here, we'll be going," Evan indicated the six other unfamiliar werewolves behind him, "but if you ever need anything—"
looking in person. Merlin, the photos in the papers certainly don't do him justice."
"And you know that
Draco had paced their flat, Floo-called Harry's office and got no response, and then finally, beginning to panic, he'd Floo-called Ginny and Luna's house, where he knew all their friends would be.
," Harry sighs.
"But—"
Harry pretended to wretch and force the food and water down like any other day, as if it
doesn’t know how to react when she pulls him aside before they leave and tells him that, ‘If he wanted to date Harry, she would approve.’
Harry smiled and shook her hand. "It's okay, Parkinson. I understand."
The rest of them say goodbye and clear off, and then Draco and Harry are alone again.
"Before we settle the terms of the challenge, maybe you should tell us what happened with Greyback, Harry." Kasper interjected calmly.
good," Draco murmured, stepping close again and pressing a kiss to Harry's jaw, then another behind his ear. He backed him against the counter and Harry tilted his head back with a moan.
Draco lamented as he watched them.
." Harry walked over to the closet and pulled out a pair of boxers and Draco's favorite pair of trousers and tossed them at his head. "Get dressed!"
“Oh, no. Everything is fine. It’s just, Brandon’s mum invited us over for dinner, and he’s been really wanting me to…”
Draco nodded, running a nervous hand through his hair. "It's certainly big enough, and secluded, and the grounds are enormous too, and I know that Mum doesn't like living there alone..."
But even worse was a week later when Draco came home from work on Halloween and got ready for the party, and Harry
Harry pressed his forehead to Draco's. "I love you, Draco. I'll always love you. I need you to know that, to remember that, in case I don't..."
"What excuse did you give for cancelling today?" Draco asked curiously.
Narcissa nodded sagely and took a sip of her tea. "I see."
"Home? But I...nevermind. Thank you, Molly. I'll go check on him."
The blond at the bar clearly likes what he sees, too. He licks his lips and gives Harry,
"I'm, ah, I'm going to go. Get home to Hermione, you know?"
"Mhm. Too sleepy to move."
be," Draco said suggestively, sliding his hands down Harry's back in a change of mood so rapid it took a second to register.
He slumped forward, resting his head on Harry's chest for a moment. He felt a sweltering hand come up to rest on his cheek. Harry was awake again. "Drake... 'm so sorry. I—"
Harry groaned. "Fine. If it means we can go home today, I'll take the cane."
Soon, Potter was inviting him in to eat dinner with him after it got too dark for Quidditch, and Draco realized the loneliness that had seeped into every corner of his life had lessened significantly.
fix things. But he's older than me, he's more experienced, and he's probably stronger than me, too. I don't know if I can. Kasper told me he's fought in Challenges before, for the Beta position after Greyback left, and none of them survived."
“I’m not heartbroken or pining after you or anything,” Draco lies, “I don’t need your guilt-assuaging gift from your new boyfriend to make me feel better. In fact, I’m dating someone now, too.”
"What? And you don't care if handsome men talk to me?
"Hi Ron, Hi Rosie," he smiled at them before turning to Hermione. "How's the research going?"
“Hm.” Draco continues playing with Harry’s hair until he drifts off.
” Harry moans noisily, clapping a hand over his mouth to muffle the sound. “
"I, um, I'll talk to him," Hermione cleaned up the mess from the soup with a swish of her wand. "Sorry, Harry."
He set his wand and his leather jacket in a nearby cell, locking them in, and sat down on the dusty ground outside the cell to wait.
"I haven't been able to sleep without you," Draco answered, a shy confession murmured into Harry's bare shoulder.
"I hate admitting when you're right," Ginny sniffles, wiping at her eyes with a hand. "But you were right."
“Draco—” Harry ignores Derek and spins around, taking a step toward him. He looks like he wants to reach out for Draco, but he doesn’t, he just stands there several feet away, a mortified expression on his face.
Quidditch, Mum."
“You don’t have to talk to him, Harry,” Ginny says in my ear, squeezing my arm. Because Draco is moving closer, and clearly I’m going to have to attempt to say...
“I’m alright now. Thank you for going with me.”
"How is Harry? After everything? I couldn't help but notice the cane."
"I'm afraid this is all my fault," the older man sighed.
For the first time, Harry caught a glimpse of a brief visual before regaining consciousness, the exterior of an enormous old house.
"You did," Harry laughed softly, "it was torture to read and not have you here, you bastard."
"Oh. Erm. Pansy. Pansy Parkinson."
Draco swipes at the tears on his cheeks. “You
Draco had owled, tried to floo-call, had even apparated to Grimmauld Place and knocked, but he got no response.
Two familiar freckled faces appear next to him, and Draco feels a hand on his arm.
He set his wand next to Harry's and followed him under the covers, sliding right up against Harry's side and burying his face against his neck.
"Alone," he rasped, barely able to force out the one word without falling apart again.
like to go on a date with you."
Draco smiled and pulled back to gently trail his fingers over the other man's cheek. "What do you want to do today?"
"Draco..."
“It should be obvious, but in case you don’t already know, he’s in love with you, too.”
Draco looked up when his mother cleared her throat pointedly. He'd joined her for breakfast the next morning, as planned, despite the nagging feeling that he needed to get back to Grimmauld Place.
An older man who looked vaguely familiar stepped forward, offering a hand in greeting. "Pierson Parkinson."
"Harry Potter doesn't listen to anyone," Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry and Ron sat on the sofa, listening to Hermione's exclamations of amazement and jealousy.
Draco tightened his hold around him, burying his face in his shirt. He was still recovering from their separation the day before. "No. Warm. Sleepy."
Harry shut him up by kissing him firmly. "I know. I'm not going to let him do this. You can stay here, you know, you don't have to watch whatever is about to happen—"
"Right, so—"
"Harry? Are you with me, darling?"
moan that came out instead as Draco took him deep in his throat again.
Draco breathed. "And then you met up with Ron and Hermione?"
Harry appears in front of the Floo a few seconds later. He’s dressed in a nice button-down shirt and trousers, hair sticking up and lips slightly swollen. He fixes his crooked glasses as he kneels down. “Hey, what’s going on?”
"Harry, Harry, oh fuck, oh, oh,
She threw her arms around him and hugged him tight. "Thank you."
"I...don't know...exactly...but I...I miss you. I miss the way..." Harry's brow creases, and he swallows hard. "We're still friends, right?"
“He’s like a Muggle doctor,” Teddy explains. “But for kids with magic.”
The headmistress nods. “Of course, but as Edward’s fathers, I hope the two of you will make the effort as a couple to ensure this issue is addressed at home as well.”
"I promise to listen next time you have concerns about someone, even if it doesn't seem like it to me, and to make my lack of interest clear to them from the start, even if it makes me come off a bit rude," Harry says softly.
Hermione gave a wave of her wand, casting a quick Muffliato Charm. "I think he's had his memory modified."
Christine smiled and nodded back, before turning back to Sofia.
"Harry,
“Thanks, Draco.”
“I think you and Dad, I mean, my other dad, I mean
Harry collapsed.
, Drake. It's not fair."
Draco shuddered. His mother had reluctantly shown him her memories of that night. The look on Harry's face as he stared down his would-be killer, the sheer determination and resignation in his eyes as he faced certain death...yes, lying to someone to protect them is

"Come to bed, love."
right, and you know it," Draco sniffed. "What do you want to do about Weasley's suspicion?"
Draco shuddered and pulled his knees up to his chest. "You were here last time?"
sorry for teasing."
"I..." Harry looked like he might want to say something else, but then he changed his mind. "Alright, love."
Draco laughed, pulling back to look at him.
“Harry, I—”
•••••
"I, er, fell down the stairs."
Harry marvels at how easy it is, slipping back into their childhood antagonistic roles. His heart hardens to stone when Draco puts a hand on the doorknob.
“Happy to help then, I guess,” Draco chuckles softly.
Harry summons his Healer’s robes from upstairs, catching them and pulling them on over his jeans and t-shirt.
Harry picked up the burnt toast first and took a huge bite, chewing and swallowing before announcing with a grin: "Perfect."
tonight?”
. Two of them were actual relationships. And I apologized to her! Gin and I are fine now, I don't understand why
“Thank you,” Harry says, eyes still shining from the pain.
"Draco," he gasps, breathless, "
Harry slides out of his lap and they kneel facing each other, reluctantly breaking kisses to remove items of clothing. Draco drags Harry’s shirt over his head and congratulates himself on his correct assumption that Harry is incredibly fit. He runs a hand down his chest as they kiss again, bracing himself for the moment his own shirt comes off.
Harry was sitting up, a tray loaded with food and sweets sitting across his lap. "Yeah, I do. But first—Chocolate frog?"
I run a hand through his hair as he presses a kiss to the Snitch on the left side of my neck. It comes to life at his touch, whizzing away from him, across my chest. “And this one?”
fine. “I need to run into work for a few hours today before we go to my mum’s. I’ll be back at six and we can Apparate over together from here.”
Draco groaned and covered his face with his hands.
Draco was healing a deep gash on Harry's right hip when he finally began to stir. "Draco?"
Harry put up a hand, cutting him off. "
"Not for long," Harry quipped, and he was right. There
The abrupt disconnection hurt more than he cared to admit. Draco couldn't deny that he'd developed feelings for Harry. Maybe he'd scared him off. But... he'd felt like Harry had felt something for him, too. That was what stung the most: The hope Draco had begun to feel that this thing between them was developing into something more, something real, was dashed without any sort of explanation or closure.
Harry sat up and abruptly tugged his own shirt up and over his head, cutting Draco off. He gasped involuntarily at the sight that greeted him.
Harry smiled weakly, immensely pleased with himself for having successfully drawn a smile and a laugh out of his anxious boyfriend.

"I'm perfectly capable of—"
"HARRY!" Thomas ran to him and leapt into his arms. Harry caught him and lifted him onto his hip, turning to appraise the man who had spoken.
"Like it? Harry, it's perfect!"
“Draco, if we were to do this, and then it went sideways, the effects on Teddy would be…”
Mathias rolled his eyes. "I didn't expect him to, Sofe. Not that I would have minded if he
"You alright?"
Harry had approached him with the information that he and Draco Malfoy were planning on going public with their relationship, hoping to prepare him for the inevitable backlash that such a shocking revelation was likely to incur. Invasive press, reports that Harry was being Imperiused, etc.
heard that part of the ceremony and drew Draco close for an enthusiastic kiss, both of them positively beaming at each other when they pulled back.
Harry cocked his head to one side. "Ah. And... How is she?"
not looking much better than the last time I saw you," Ron teased.
On the plus side, it keeps anyone who might have approached him or spat the words ‘Death Eater’ at him under their breath away, so part of Draco is grateful.
I say things I don't mean when I'm upset!
"That's not what I asked."
"Brilliant idea! I have eaten since..." Ron looked confused for a second, then his expression cleared and he beamed, passing the now-slightly hysterical baby back over to his wife. "I'll be right back."
She threw herself at the bars that prevented her from helping her friend, growling angrily as she bounced off of them again and again.
Harry tips his head back against the sofa and sighs. “He was weird about the fame thing.”
"So did you," Harry gasped, tearing at Draco's belt and his fly until his trousers dropped, "if you knew what those bloody trousers do to me, the way they hug your perfect arse...it's indecent, honestly."
Evan swallowed and wrung his hands. "We've heard a lot of rumors about this place and what you're trying to do here, and we're in full support..."
"Thank you, Harry. But...I don't understand. You barely know us. Shouldn't your money go to Draco? Or your godchildren?"
Draco sinks down onto the sofa and buries his head in his hands. “Merlin. What a disaster.”
He actually

, but I'd hoped... Rose misses him. We all do."
“Thanks.” Draco turns to go. “You have ink on your face, by the way. I would have helped you with that, but since you mocked my cooking I don’t think I will.”
•••••
Draco feels his stomach flutter as he unconsciously steps closer. "Me too, Harry."
"Oops," Malfoy shrugged. "Good thing I have plenty more. You're outnumbered, Potter."
Harry smiles and pulls him into another kiss, and this time Draco leans into it, hands coming up to wrap around Harry's back and pull him close.
"Alright. So. Werewolves have no resources, right? Nowhere safe to go. We hide in the shadows, cut off from everything. Many just die, because they have no money, no food, no shelter. So I was wondering... What if we could provide a...a
Curious, he climbs out of bed and pulls on the discarded pyjamas he’d slept in. He hesitates at the top of the stairs to listen.
Harry was flooded with relief when his friends returned, Ron carrying Draco. He set him on the bed next to Harry, who reached out to touch him immediately, running his hands over Draco's arm and shoulder. "What happened?"
Draco followed him, brow creased with concern. "Are you okay? What do you need?"
"What's his name?" Harry asks.
Harry comes back in a t-shirt and jeans and follows Draco's instructions until dinner is on the table.
Harry pulled back to look at him. "Seriously? You irritated me on purpose just because you find it hot when I'm mad?"
Harry looks over at him like Draco has just understood something very important about him and he gives him a fleeting smile before continuing. “The first time he used my name to get a table at the Black Sphinx I let it slide, but I asked him not to do anything like that again…”
"Harder, damnit Harry, fuck me, fuck me,
Draco propped himself up on an elbow and looked down at him, pouting prettily. "If you

Draco threw his hood back up over his head. Potter must have seen the panic in his eyes, because he reached out and grabbed him by the arm, Side-Along Apparating him away instantly. Draco stumbled as they landed in an unfamiliar sitting room.

She nodded slowly. "That might be best."
The baby just continued to stare at him as she shoved a chubby hand in her mouth.
Harry forces his face into a solemn expression. “I’m
Harry laughed and continued his ministrations on Draco's neck, kissing and licking and sucking as his newly-bonded mate made little noises of pleasure.
She’ll do it, too. I know she will. So, rolling my eyes at her, I tug the shirt over my head.
“It was great to see you, too.” Harry murmurs, walking over to kiss Teddy’s forehead. “Happy Christmas, Narcissa. Happy Christmas, kid. I’ll see you on Sunday, alright?”
"I'm a Death Eater." Draco drags his left sleeve up to brandish his Dark Mark. "I may be a bit more pleasant to be around now, but I still have
Draco brushed his fingers over his cheek. "I wanted to pretend too, love. That everything was okay, that we would really be getting married next year, that I would get a lifetime with you instead of just a few weeks. It's not enough. We need more time. I...I can't lose you like this."
"Oh." Ron looked guilty. "I'm so sorry, mate. I didn't know. I still don't understand
"Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?" Draco asked when he was finished explaining.
“What do
“Teddy!”
They had been sprawled comfortably on the bed, having finished with the benefits side of things, when Draco reached out and lightly traced his fingers over Harry's bare chest.
Teddy stares at him and stays silent, lips pressed together. Harry nudges him, looking embarrassed. “Teddy!”
He pushes the door open and greets them with a cheerful, “hello!”
Harry had been declared fully-recovered and released from St. Mungo’s nearly a month previously, but they’re just now gathering at the Weasleys to finally celebrate properly.
"Do what?"
“Thanks,” Brandon kisses his cheek from behind and walks away.
Why, Draco? I want to ask. Why would you want to see me? You left me, you left and you got married, and there’s no reason for us to even speak anymore. I know I should hate him. I’ve tried, Merlin knows I’ve tried, but I just
“Yes I can,” Draco pretends to grouse in spite of the warm contentment that is spreading through him with every second Harry holds his hand. “They should be prepared for last-minute shoppers. I’m not the only one, clearly.”
“Your
Harry rolls his eyes at him. “Yes,
Draco shrugged. "Well, you haven't been interested lately, so..."
"Both," Harry bit his lower lip. "It's pretty." He coughed and looked away, his blush deepening. "So, is there anything else that changed? Other than your appearance?"
"I appreciate the sentiment, but I couldn't live with myself if I hurt you. I don't want you anywhere near this house tonight. Apparate home this afternoon. You can come back in the morning when it's safe. Please, Draco. Promise me."

I have good news! I'm going to be able to up my posting schedule for this story to Mondays and Thursdays starting this week. (:
As he came into view, Draco couldn't help thinking that Harry made a beautiful wolf. His eyes were different in shape, but they retained their familiar, vibrant shade of green. He was slightly larger than the average wolf, but otherwise the differences were minute. His fur was shiny and thick, and inky black like his hair.
Draco snorted in amusement, casting a wordless Protego Charm to keep his wand firmly in his hand. "Is that all you've got, Potter? It's a wonder you lasted thirty seconds against the Dark Lord."
"He didn't mean it! He was just upset!"
"What if he wants you?" She murmured.
“Yes, you,” he traces his hands over the tattoo on my left pectoral, a beautifully rendered pair of lilies I’d had done while visiting Ron and Hermione in Australia. “For your mum?” he asks, and I nod. He kisses the right side, brushing his fingers over the stag I’d gotten in France when I stayed with Bill and Fleur. “And for your dad?”
It felt surreal, having him home after so many months apart. Harry grinned to himself. Surreal, but absolutely perfect.
"Yeah. An old house, surrounded by trees. I don't know where it is, but I saw it."
A dresser drawer pulls open and shut, and he hears the bathroom door open and close, then the sound of the shower turning on. He listens to the water running for a few long minutes, and then it turns back off.
Hermione smiled at the memory. Despite his protests that he'd "already been working on it," and "just happened to finish testing for side effects while she was pregnant and sick all day every day —
"Yeah, I guess I just..." Harry sighs. "I'm so busy now, I haven't been interested in looking for anything...it's just easier this way, isn't it?"
As much as I hate to admit it Malfoy, you've given him something to fight for. And Harry
Harry doesn't look nearly upset enough, Draco thinks, considering the situation.
The grey wolf lunged at the black wolf's throat, but was thrown off course when the red wolf launched herself at him, knocking him to the side.
His father's note had felt like a challenge, and Draco had taken it. For better or worse, there was no going back.
Parker! I don't know why he wrote it like that in the note."
“There was so much blood,” Ron finishes his story. “I got him here as fast as I could, and then they gave him that potion and took him back, and then I came to get you, and…bloody hell, I forgot to tell Hermione! And Teddy, doesn’t he get out of school soon?”
Ron was hit by the spell from behind, through the open doorway, and slowly crumpled to the ground.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Come on, Harry. Just put your Glamour on, and let's go."
THE ONE WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS PACK? LEAD US?" Grace screamed, slashing at Nadine with the knife as the other woman nimbly dodged the blow. "YOU? Greyback's

Lottie smiles again, and Draco wants to scream at her about just how wrong she is, but the shattered look in Harry’s eyes, the only evidence in his expression that anything is amiss, forces Draco to hold his tongue.
Draco looks away. "Why does it matter?"
“You’d do that?” Harry sounds incredulous.
"Mother, I don't know what to...
room now, given that Harry only returns to his own quarters to shower and change and sleep, and he smiles at the memory, wondering briefly if Harry will even go back to his own room for those things now. He hopes not.
Kasper swallowed. "I...well, then. As long as you understand what you're doing."
“You can’t do...what?”
"We can't solve all our problems with sex, darling."
The next time a panic attack had happened, they had known exactly what to do. After a while, Harry had started laying on Draco anytime they were alone, no panic necessary. And Draco always pretended to sigh, pretended to feel put upon—greatly inconvenienced, he'd say—even though he secretly loved the closeness, too. He must have let some of it show on his face, because Harry just laughed at his antics, and then he'd lay on him anyway. And Draco would touch his hair, every time.
"Merde," Pierson swore. "Terrible timing. I'm so sorry, Mr. Potter. We had no idea."
Potter lowers his voice as they both notice Teddy coming back from the bathroom. “I was actually really glad you did. She’d just invited me back to her place to meet her fifteen
"For...
Draco stared them down, nicknaming them in his head. One was shorter and had curly brown hair, and so, he got the nickname, 'curly.' The other man was enormous, with a wide forehead and a blank expression. Draco's newly-cleared brain dubbed him 'troll.'

A long silence, filled only by Quidditch on the wireless. "
"Excuse me, I am a
“We could do more things together,” Harry offers, smiling tentatively. “When he’s with me, so you don’t miss him so much.”
“I’ve missed you, too, kid,” Potter murmurs, stroking Teddy’s midnight-black hair, hair that had changed color the instant he’d laid eyes on his godfather.
"You're welcome."
Harry shook his head. "He's not...not good. Take care of him tonight, okay?"
He turns around to see Draco holding his schoolbag up by the strap, a teasing smirk on his face.
It was over. Ron and his other colleagues would find him soon. He'd survived.
"Ma-ma."
"I love it," Harry continued pressing open-mouthed kisses over his throat, and despite his token protest, Draco angled his head to give him better access. "Godric, you taste good."

“I don’t think I need to repeat it,” Brandon sneers, drawing his own wand.
The Headmistress ushers them in, and they sit behind the severe-looking woman’s desk. Her sharp exterior softens slightly when she smiles at them.
Their lips brush softly, awkwardly at first, and then with more confidence for a few long, perfect seconds. Harry pulls away with a soft gasp. "So, you...?"

"So, tell us about your life. How are things with Astoria?"
wants something."
"It seems we have a lot to catch each other up on," Draco said soberly. "I called a friend here, a Healer from St. Mungo's to come help."
He pulls the book from Harry's hand and gingerly takes off his glasses, carefully setting them on Teddy's nightstand. He goes to pull the covers up over them when a hand catches his wrist, holding it loosely.
"Stop them?" Ron laughed. "Good luck."
"Right. Sorry, Head Auror Potter," the other man looks slightly cowed by Harry's cold demeanor. "I was just wondering if you'd want to join Jeffords and me for lunch today."
“You don’t get to be...jealous...like this…” Draco gasps as Harry trails biting kisses over his jaw, then down the side of his neck, “when I had to

There was a streak of paint across his forehead where he must have wiped at his brow with a messy hand.
"Where's Draco?"
This time, he gets an answer. “Draco?”
"I mean, it's not that I didn't...I just...I
He probably would, unfortunately. After running his fingers over the owl's feathers on the top of his head, the bird let out a satisfied coo and flew out the open window.
"Oh, er, thanks." Harry grinned at her and left, quickly navigating the large house and heading for the edge of the grounds to Apparate home.

"Give it to her yourself at The Burrow next Sunday," Ron said gruffly, pulling away.
