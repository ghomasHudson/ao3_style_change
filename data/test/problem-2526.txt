My eyes finally opened as he released me with a pop his silver, lust-filled eyes looking into mine as I pulled him up to kiss him before he even thought about licking anything away from his lips. Lucius easily pinned me down under him as we kissed and he reached to test if his thumb would slip into me with ease. I felt his smirk against my lips "One day." Lucius whispered. I could do nothing but nod, yes one day I will let him push more than just his thumb into my tight, virgin arse.
drama as if
"I'm not tried I promise." He rolled his eyes and patted my head, before accioing something in his hands.
"Why in the name of Merlin is Potter, trying to console the mudblood girl and Weasel, they were late of their own accord, it's their fault no point in making them feel better" Although I would never voice my opinions to Harry, directly it felt nice hearing Pansy laugh.
Mya - 14
There were only two people that I recognised, my own twin sister Citrus and my cousin Leviathan. The rest I have no idea, I might have heard of them but that's a low chance. I had planned to pay attention instead of just pay attention to them, the way they looked and dress. I could tell who their parents were by looking at them. Of course, I already knew Leviathan, he wasn't Andromeda's son, father had also spoken about him a few times.
Oh. I forgot to mention that, the voice, yes. He's called Tom, and he says a lot of sarcastic and morbid things. But I don't mind, he's never left me on my own, he's never left me to cry. He's never insulted me. Draco doesn't do those things either, at least not anymore. Back in school, we used to hate each other.
"Why? He doesn't need to have Ministry tracking, he has committed no crimes, he hasn't broken our law." Allison shrugged, before sighing. I could tell that the order wasn't on our end, Auror Tonks was on loan to us by the Minister of Magic for two years, she was halfway through her first.
Luckily today of all days was the day that writing on the wall cause the whole school to go up in flames. I think I will pretend to care. It was probably someone trying to make a scene. Enemies of the heir beware? Who in the name of Merlin and Morgana was the heir! I stayed as clear to any drama as possible.
Laughing, giggling, running. Sounds of children, young children I know because the others do it, but me, I know better than to run around at home. The sounds seem ghostly, fainted but yet very, very clear. Too clear to me.
Since I felt better we continued having an in-depth conversation and learned a lot about one another. "Do you want to just stay here for the night?" I offered, I wasn't going to make Draco walk back to his uncle so late. To my absolute surprise, he nodded.
A chapter that is important to the story, just not very well written I got writer's block halfway through.
"With your sister, Dragon." Right, I didn't know who that was, Draco was holding my hand, tightly. Because of me, Draco and his family were forced to take muggle transport. "Don't worry, Dragon all of our important things will be with us. You will be fine." we had gotten through security easily. No doubt magic was involved.
The last fifteen minutes back...home.
"Sir, I didn't know that he'd left our dorm, although in Transfiguration yesterday he, Pansy and Theo were being cruel to Hermione, because she and Ron were late in class. And Draco called her a m-mudblood." Snape looked at me, questionably I blinked "Sir? What does that word mean?" I asked Ron had been the one to console her when he found her.
I shrugged a little "I'm not the best, to be honest." I didn't say much else on it but did take my cup of tea, offering Hermione a thankful smile, Draco did the same when he was offered some. I sat quietly and sipped at my drink "I just feel sleepy." He smiled and took a sip of his tea, I think peppermint, from the colour and the smell.
I'm not traveling far, our home was always close to the City. But I can't get what I saw out of my head, it's going to plague me. I don't think I'll be able to step into The Hall of Everlasting Happiness for a while. Is this why we don't leave often? So we forget the hardships of common life. I don't know how to feel about that, I trust the Emperor with my life. I had heard of poverty and inequality, it took up a whole year of my later education. But that's normal isn't it, there is always going to be the rich and the poor, but it's a basic right to have a home, to have happiness, that shouldn't be taken away from people.
Walking out he took me downstairs to the small wooden hut, in the back garden, with a swing and some other thing that I couldn't see from where we were. "Ooo Mat has one of these, although his is made of glass!" I said instantly, "Who's Mat?" I was asked by all three, my face red and looked at my plate
I couldn't help but think that Ron meant You-Know-Who. Tom Marvolo Riddle, looking over at the Slytherin Table. "Well, his son lives in America, if that's any consolation."
Sitting down next to Draco, he grabbed my hand and smiled nervously "Is something wrong? If it's what Ginny did, she can't take a hint-" He shook his head and kissed my cheek.
I turned around when I heard fast-paced footsteps behind me, smiling when I was Harry, walking towards him so he could slow down "When did you get a haircut? Is that even allowed?" He asked, standing beside me, not looking impressed when I shook my head, looping my arm in his as I started walking again. Walking both of us towards the lake.
"No, it's not that, not at all, I promise, Ginny, doesn't bother me not yet anyway." I sighed resting my head on his shoulder.
I wrapped my arms around him and ran my hand through his hair trying to calm him down, from crying. It didn't take a genius to figure out what Draco was afraid of, he pushed himself up off my chest and sniffed, I passed him a strawberry scented tissue, he muttered thank you, and laid his head on my shoulder. Softly crying as I continued to run my hand through his hair, "Why aren't you..." I sighed quietly and thought about my answer "I know what being used like a tug of war rope, and generally being abused feels like, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, even someone I hate." Draco looked at me, "Even the Dark Lord?" I nodded after a while. Brushing off the odd detached feeling that came with Lord Voldemort I smiled "That's what you call him?" Draco nodded and fiddled with his hands, "I can stop if you don't like it!" he rushed cutely, I smiled and lifted up his head, slightly "Draco, I honestly don't mind what you call him as long as it doesn't kill you, personally I don't see why people don't just call him Lord Voldemort, I seem to be the only one who does."
Harry Potter, finally arrives at the Forbidden City, however he is ill with something and Draco is still at home.
"It was on the desk, I got curious." He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my cheek. "It belongs to Ginny, so maybe give it back to her, when you can." I nodded and smiled.
I gently pulled Draco next to me and gave him the best reassuring smile I possibly could, "It's fine, but you might want to cover yourself with this." I pull out my invisibility cloak as Draco eyes seem to light up at the sight of it "I'm not sure how my housemates would react if I brought a Slytherin into the tower." He nodded and I draped it over him, He coughed a bit them nuzzled closer to me before. When we got into my dorm room I had been given this year Draco shook his head lightly and pat down with impossible sort hair before shuffling on his feet "Something wrong?" I asked, sitting on one of the beds in the well-lit room, Draco putting on the other "Not really it's just, I'm kind of scared." He said, my face softened and I went to get up, Draco watching my every move I sat down next to him, slowly "Of what?" I asked softly letting him think, my hand were on my lap Draco looked at me "You can keep a secret right?"
"I waved and smiled, politely and he just smiled back, not a hello, not a how are Harry!" I heard him sigh, he has heard this a thousand times. I wonder if he's spoken to either Narccisa or Lucius. I know Draco talking to them won't work, we've tried that for three years.
That was the Draco Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter ended up dating after the war. The Draco who had achieved his goals, the Draco who had indeed continued on the Dark Lord's legacy, and the Draco who had paid dearly for everything.
He laughed and kissed my hair "No not, really I want to buried with my parents regardless of whether I'm married or not, but I do like the idea, because it would mean that depending on what I chose to do around the time of my birthday next year means that I wouldn't be completely trapped in a 40cm by 15cm dome with a doll stand inside, Also it gives Cygnus and Aliette something to remember me by, as well as anyone else I care about." I smiled and laid back down on his lap, my History Of Magic book lay forgotten on the bed.
Now I could hear the beating of the rain and the rattle of wildlife, yet it was distant. Had I possibly been twisting the sounds of rain on glass for Harry's screams? The squeaks of animals for Bella's voice? Whipping of trees for the cracks of twigs. "It seems I experienced a stress dream." My tone was plain but I was forced to change my answer a few seconds later "Fine, a nightmare, I was having a nightmare." Lucius smiled at my newfound honestly and waves his hand as a bath began to run for me. "But I can't tell what it was about, to be honest."
One-hundred and fifty-six days until the end of the year. Dammit! It's my birthday and I can't stop thinking about him? Draco would laugh at me. Talking of my everloving and an endearing boyfriend who is making so much noise downstairs, he's either fighting a lion, baking or decorating. I hope it's baking.
Harry leaned over to dip his hand in the water, giggling childishly over the ripples he made. His laugh, much like talking about his cares made him sound free and healthy. "Draco! Draco look!" I turned my head at his hushed whisper to see a fish bobble up to surface and swim near us for a few meters "I love fish, they're so calm and pretty." I didn't have the heart to tell Harry that he was eating fish or breakfast almost every day or that his soup broth was made from fish bones, I would do anything to keep that smile and giggle on his face an alive.
I looked up, Draco was blinking. He has zoned out resting on his father's shoulder. I continued to hold his hand, as we were being fed information.
My mother placed a charm on me that would enable me to voice my thoughts "You actually did that?" I turned to my uncle and smiled, he patted me and kissed the crown of my head, "Draco, I did try to not replace anything, honestly but I just had to-" I smiled and shook my head "Sev, it's fine I don't mind, really." I nuzzled his hand as he carefully picked me up and carried me to the get to outside to which Stephine was laying out lunch for all of us.
"Blaise are you okay?" Draco said running toward his friend and sat on his bed, and probably did the first thing that came to his head, as he rested his hand on his forehead. He stayed in that position for a few hours, but I didn't think he actually knew what he was doing, or neither did he. Draco leant in and gently pressed his lips to Blaise's forehead before he jumped back in shock as he hid his face with his robe "Blaise, I didn't mean to do that! I swear!" Said boy smiled and laughed, hitting Draco lightly with a pillow.
"You will answer any question I ask you, and you will say nothing more." Just because she was so much lower than her dear sister meant nothing. They still had the same parents and they were raised in the same house, they share the same blood. Just because Bells was the Emperor's untouched wife meant nothing to her. She was a Black regardless, this little brat would suffer for her crimes. Even if the Emperor tried to claim that she had been too harsh.
"Harry, as much as it seems like it, my uncle doesn't want to kill you." I nodded and watched as Cygnus and Aliette, slept and gently whacking each other in their sleep, Draco, patted down their hair and brushed back their hair over their ears. Soon I find myself going to sleep, seduced by a soft lullaby.
After a while, I told them that I wouldn't mind either way They smiled and Draco had fallen asleep reading and had laid his head on my chest.
Daffodil was simply reading, sitting her room, she had spent the night with him and walked back to the palace with Draco after breakfast this morning. She hadn't noticed that someone else was in the room with her. If she had, maybe this would have turned out so differently and Alice might not ever see her Mistress again. Daffodil's eunuch was her own cousin, she fought to have him here and to not have him become infertile, there were only two male Blacks left. Besides, she loved Reggie.
Chapter four: August 8th > Keeping with Harry's pov he and Draco share a look at breakfast while Tom looks between the two of them; Harry gets him to stop and coops up in his room for most of the day trying to read. In the evening Draco comes over and he and Harry have dinner together. Harry has thought about his place here and Sirius. Draco and Harry fall asleep together.
Opening the door I smiled at the unchanged furniture. My first place that most definitely didn't run through; my parents' bedroom, they looked so ill it made me cry as I sat beside their bed watching them slowly wake and breath. My mother, who wasn't as ill held my hand, calling me sweet and Prince, trying to stop my tears.
I've never felt cold water before, well I have just in small amounts like when washing my hands, but never like this. I held my breath not that I could for very long as something, someone brushed against my back. I stopped myself from screaming for my parents they weren't going to hear me, although if they were back then they might, I have no way of knowing that. "P-please leave me alone" I whispered to what seemed like no-one. I was losing my mind surely, no-one had replied. I felt it again.
"Please-" Alice begged her wrists chained and pulled tightly, the second after she spoke the twigs slashed at her palms again, making her cry out and sob. Snot fell from her nose, tears from her eyes, her hand was raw, red and bleeding. Yet the woman in front of her was restless. "I beg-" Speaking was useless, she was kicked to the floor by Daffodil's heel, her legs spread out wide. Alice whimpered and looked up at her torturer. Her clothes were damp and soiled. Daffodil had made her wash her hands with raw soap and water for the past one and a half hours, draining her arms of energy. She had answered all she could, even ratted out her own mistress when Daffodil had beat her with the twigged whip. Yet this wasn't enough.
"Harry, don't feel bad, honestly money is no problem for us, to us 36 galleons is nothing." I nodded but still looked sorry, he stroked my hair and smiled "Why don't we go buy your shoes while Draco places the clothes in the car and gets lunch for us, how does that sound." I smiled and nodded, taking hold of his sleeve.
I sat up, biting my lip I looked down.  "I'm fine Mrs Malfoy, I was just wondering if tomorrow I could go out to buy Christmas presents? I haven't got any yet..." I went silent, I knew at least they called Christmas something else. I felt my chin get lifted up.
I put the phone back on Professor Snape's desk and walk away, I never wanted to make that phone call, I almost never told Harry how I felt. No one else needs to know about anything I've been through and done, just Harry no one else, no other person, no other outsider. They won't understand, they never will. I need to stop acting, I'm not the person I'm being. I'm not nice. I'm not kind. I'm not fixed. I'm not okay. I'm not brash. I'm not dominant.
"It means dirty blood, it's a slur that purist witches and wizards call muggle-borns by. Lucius, his mother and I have tried to get the word out of Draco's vocabulary to no avail; I'm by no means excusing him but you ought to listen to him, knowing him he's probably thinking the worst." I nodded and laced my hands together.
"Hey, Harry do you want to come over the holidays?" Draco asked in his usual child-like mannor
Apple - 22
"Your father will recognise, me within seconds, he won't trust me." I smiled tightly, the duel had lasting effects on my father, the stress from it had caused my baby brother to be born prematurely by one month. That and uncles privet wing had been shot with muggle artillery.
"You can always get off Draco, I haven't chained you to the chair," He whispered against my ear, his hands resting at my hips. I knew he wasn't lying and that I could just move away from him, but somehow I didn't move. When he noticed I was most likely going to stay he leaned back; I let out a breath I didn't notice I was holding. Only then did he continue speaking "I can't dispose of her, I just can't, however correct you are. But that is not why I assume you came in?" I must admit that he can read me like an open book, maybe that's why he likes to test and push boundaries with me. "It's about the Minister isn't it?" Tom's tone suddenly shifts, his body slums and his eyes grow heavy, his hair is turning grey. I can't let this continue.
Another round of nods, I felt Draco pull me closer, his parents wrapping their arms around us I had no idea why but didn't question it. Draco brushed down my hair rhythmically, I don't know who he was trying to calm down, but it was helping me relax. I looked at the desk closest to me.
"That might be wise Mr Potter." Damm it I said that out loud.
Our teacher had left us halfway through the double to check something in his quarters, he still hasn't returned. Through this, I had learned that each class had a head, a selected student that would 'head' the class in the case of the Professor's temporary absence during class time. The class had ended up talking about the old Potions Master/Chemistry Teacher, rumour had it that he could have rivalled Severus Snape and had won multiple awards for his work and skill. The teacher we had before, the cover, is his nephew and he had been raised in school by him. 'Eric Riddle."
Reaching for my wand I wave it around slightly, some sparks shoot out of the end. Then form a little image, it's clear and translucent but I can just about see it. I wave it away as quickly as I conjured it. I keep hearing this little melody in my head, along with a male voice humming. I pay it little mind and let him continue.
Hogwarts had been shut down temporarily, all students were to move to different schools; me, Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Hermione and Ron had moved to Ilvernmory. It was a terrible event, we were to start our fourth year in another country. The ICW had heard about the actions of older years in Hogwarts and had released an inquiry into the school. It meant that Draco and others had to provide statements and show in the Wizarding Government.
"Nothing sweetheart, I'm just proud of you." I cock my head to the side in confusion, why would she be proud of me? I haven't done anything too grand or good. Glancing down I didn't notice that she had moved until she wrapped an arm around me "You've been so resilient over the past few months Draco, and you've always kept a part of yourself, not many people would or have done that when in your position." I looked up at her gradually as she spoke, leaning into her hand as it braided my hair and smiled "How about we give this a cut hmm? You've wanted that for a while."  I nod happily and smile widely for the first time today.
Oh, Merlin, it's been 12 chapters, this story is officially one year old! I can' believe I began this on OneNote last year if you have been following this since the start or just binge read it all, thank you. It means so much to see the hit number go up and the kudos as well!
I woke up to the same sight as always, the same green walls and ceiling. Nothing ever changes here. I know why I'm here, they know I know why I am here. It doesn't change what they do.
This took me forever and was unedited so there are so many mistakes I'm sorry.
"Yes, I was wondering if you could explain why I found him in the common room late last night asleep on a chair; not the most comfortable place for a child don't you think?" I blinked, I hadn't known that Draco had left our dorm. Although I did wake up multiple times so maybe I just didn't realise.
"You think I'm done?" She spat at Alice, forcing the girl to the floor, using her magic to chain her blood-soaked arms to the ground. "Oh please, I'm only just beginning."  Alice choked and coughed, her hair was stuck to her face from tears and sweat. She felt her clothes, once white and pristine was now being torn from her body, there was no chance of her ever returning to the Empress without shame.
"Harry, Harry!" The words seem to fade into nothing
"But father! Please can't you try?" Draco begged to his father, he looked so sad that he was leaving his son, but Draco's chin quivered and his mother wiped the tears falling down his face like a thunder storm with her hand and pressed him to her side "Lucius, please can you just try to talk to Dumbledore about staying, nither of us like to to Draco cry and I don't feel like leaving him in Hogwarts, with just Harry, no offense dear." I was surprised that I had been mentioned let alone called 'dear' by his mother. Lucius semed to think it through "I'll try, but I can't promise that he'll say yes." It was enough to make him smile.
Okay, so I'm playing a game called Pou, and I randomly got this idea, no clue what to do with it. So I'll just roll with it. Also, this is somehow set in a similar universe to my Happy Birthday Harry one-shot thing.
"Your father smiled at me."
Our teacher was pushed into the wall, spluttering helplessly, I've seen people act better when under Crucio. He smiled and brushed a lock of curled hair away from his left eye, the potions teacher gasped and his eyes widened in fear or shock.
It was soon afternoon, and I was sat in a chair reading, in the comfort of my chambers. I was left alone through the day, luckily. From what I had been told concubines were known to be ruthless and cutthroat depending on what they wanted. I was unsure if this was supposed to bring me comfort or fear, so I decided to take it as neither and let it simply be a statement. I wouldn't worry unless Remus or Sriuis said that I needed to, in which case I would follow what advice they give me. Although this currently wasn't no my mind, but rather the orange glow that was spilling across my book page, illumining the parchment on which my Shakespeare was printed. I'm told by Hermione that the setting sun makes my green eyes sparkle and glow. I smiled, thankful for the compliment but also shook my head, I certainly never thought so since I always try to avoid the sun whenever possible, which is rather difficult living here and seeing the metaphorical 'Sun' the Emperor, the Son of Heaven.
two of them! Why they would assume
"What takes up too much of your time?" I thought about it, before smiling, Maybe this could be fun "I'd say homework, I spend normally about two hours on one pice of homework.", she smiled and most likely made a mental note of my answer, "Okay, what’s your favourite drink?" I spent a long time thinking, before answering with mint tea. About twenty minuets later, she began to ask more personal questions "What are three of the most significant numbers in your life?"
"Yes, Mistress?" Alice was a woman, she had a son who was snatched away from her. Her eyes were wide and almost mad, just like the Empress. Her body was small and beaten, she was used for the Empress' entertainment and pleasure.
I haven't told Draco about the voice in my head, mainly because it doesn't do much and when it does it makes me feel happy. Like humming to me currently or telling me that everything will be okay when I was five. Why would I worry anyone with that?
In the next hour, I had regained myself to following Draco, he didn't seem to mind, so I clutched his sleeve as we walked back to his room and I assume he meant to place them in their cot, but he stayed holding them, while they slept, "You know, what are their names?" I whispered, careful to wake the two sleeping children they held each other tightly. Draco looked up and smiled.
I had a feeling that something bad had happened or was going to happen, to Draco I didn't realise that he was holding my hand until I felt something warm on my neck. "My father told me to stay with you! Oh and your neck's bleeding." Draco said timidly and whispered the last part, it was then that I saw the shattered pattern in his eyes and the cracks in his wrist
After dinner, they all retired to the living room. Draco played a few songs on the piano before cutting Narcissa’s birthday cake.
“Come on Harry, you know how this works; you’ve been to the champions dance and all,” Draco teased, and Harry blushed beet red.
“Possible? It is! Polyamorous relationships exist, darling,” Harry said earnestly.

I enclosed your official invite for Teddy’s graduation with this letter. It might seem superfluous but I liked the idea of sending invites to every guest, even those who happen to have organized said party. I thought that you might want to keep it as a memento… But of course, feel free to use it as a coaster or to do whatever you wish with it.
Which reminds me, do you know where I could get the recipe for these burgers? I’d quite like to try my hand at them — and I’ll need your expert knowledge to attest to their quality, of course.
Apologies. I get weird and defensive when I’m
“Please, it’s on the house. I can’t charge my little taste tester and critic here!” Harry grinned. “So what can I get for y’all today?”
“Oh,” Harry smiled sheepishly and ran a hand through his hair.
PPS. Seeing as I intend to Apparate in and out of my flat as quickly as possible (I just need to find a change of clothes, I can’t steal your clothes forever), I should be back by the time you’ve finished reading. If not, assume that Pansy has broken in and kidnapped me for an impromptu brunch x.
“Happy Anniversary, baby,” Harry whispered and Draco smiled sleepily.
Draco was stunned but quickly recovered.
“Well, you were amazing today. I think half of the kids here were excited for a chance to dance with the handsome instructor,” Harry teased, his green eyes twinkling.
“I’m sorry, Papa,” the five-year-old pouted before resuming munching on a chocolate éclair.
“No!” Harry shouted. “I mean, it's okay… I liked it,” he continued shyly.
“Is the balance alright? Do you think the strawberries overpower the champagne? I obviously can’t give it to my regular taste tester, Scorp, so you’ll have to do,” he rambled, then saw Draco staring at him intently and blushed. “Sorry, I get carried away sometimes.”
Regarding Arthur’s birthday, it might be better if you’re the one asking Molly. It would be a bit awkward for me to ask about it, seeing as I haven’t been invited.
Harry stared at him with an indecipherable expression, then raised his hand to wipe off a smear of cream from the corner of Draco’s lips.

In other words, the tooth-rotting fluff is only beginning, my friends!
“I wanted to ask you something… Would you like to go to the ball with me?”
“Can cousin Teddy read me a bedtime story? He does the best impressions!” Scorpius asked cheerfully.
“Please also welcome Professor Potter, who has kindly agreed to help me with this class.” He gestured towards Harry who mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like ‘more like forced’. “Alright students, let's begin, shall we?”
Harry flushed. “I meant what I said, by the way. You can come by Grimmauld Place whenever and I can show you the wine cellar. I’m sure you’d appreciate it more than me!”
“Hush Potter! Merlin, you’re such a disaster,” Draco laughed. “Yes, I said yes.”
Draco cleared his throat and looked straight ahead at the pitch. Harry also turned towards the game, but he kept touching his lips, unable to concentrate.
“So...will you teach me?”

Scorpius cheered as Draco gave him the time and Floo details before leaving the store.
And, don't worry Malfoy, you sound the usual amount of resentful. Plus, in case you’ve forgotten, you were invited to that Puddlemere match but couldn’t attend due to the Noctem potion conference. It was a brilliant match, though, and I suppose you’re allowed to be salty, what with Teddy gushing —

Harry wasn’t so bad when no one was watching. They glided across the room in tune with the beats. Their bodies fit perfectly against each other. Draco placed his head in the crook of Harry’s neck and Harry rested his chin on Draco’s head.
Draco smiled, then snarked, “Of course, I’m an oenophile. But only if you promise to feed me some sweets as well!”
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, I’ve never heard of those ‘cupcakes’ before. In any case, you’re welcome to add them to the menu for tonight, I might be tempted to try one

“Not to forget, he’s also scorching hot,” Harry added and Draco stared at him. “What? I have eyes!” he teased.
It was past 6 pm on Saturday when Draco stepped out of the Floo at Grimmauld Place as instructed by Harry in his letter.
“Oh,” Draco replied.
“Do you like him as well?” Draco asked softly.
Draco shyly got up and retrieved a lumpy-looking package. He dropped it on the sofa and ran into their bedroom.
“That’s not polite, Scorp,” he sputtered.
Draco’s eyes widened for a second before he smiled and accepted.

Draco nodded as Scorpius piped up, “We’re having a party for Grandma tonight, you should come, Harry!”
Harry brought out a beautiful cake frosted in baby pink and pistachio green, topped with beautiful piped roses. “I just finished piping these before you arrived,” he proudly displayed his creation as Draco looked at it in awe while Scorpius eyed it hungrily. He had evidently inherited his sweet tooth from his dad.
Once they’d settled in, Harry went and bought some popcorn, and a few bars of Honeydukes chocolates - Draco’s favourites. When he got back, he found Draco and Pansy engrossed in watching the commercials on the

(of course, this first draft was never sent and spent the rest of its life comfortably held inside Professor Potter's robe pocket - against his heart)
“Mine is ‘Floral Pistachio’, it most certainly is ‘the love cake’."
The house looked cheerful and airy, with large windows, light walls and comfortable furniture. It looked homey and inviting, unlike the house he had visited as a child with his mother. Harry had definitely worked on it.
She waved and walked over to a cameraman standing in a corner. “Thank you, my good sir.” she smirked, handing him a bag of galleons.
Draco’s cheeks were on fire. He looked up at Harry to deny it. Tell him he was crazy. But instead, he turned his face away. He couldn't lie to the man he loved. And love Harry, he did! They had been together for almost three years after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Teddy and Andy were already there and Narcissa greeted him warmly. They made small talk, drank, ate and laughed. Harry was seated next to Draco during dinner and they chatted about Scorpius and Teddy, Draco’s job, and Harry's bakery. It was an unsurprisingly comfortable evening.
Draco grinned. “It’s cute… You’re cute… I mean, uh, your enthusiasm...” he petered off.
By the way, yesterday I caught two students studying Professor Potter’s latest picture in the Daily Prophet instead of their copy of

dating? What would you call all these dinners and lunches we’ve been sharing these past few weeks, then?
Before you complain about the amount of food, keep in mind that we have invited all of the Weasley brothers (and Ginny eats enough to put them all to shame).
He enveloped his boyfriend in a hug. “Can I ask you something?” Draco nodded, “Have you ever thought about adding another person to our relationship? Not just for sex but as a partner… Someone like Neville?”
fine. Malfoys handle parties beautifully if Mother is to be believed—and she’s always, always right.
Speaking of your family, do you mind if we Apparate together at the Burrow? I’ll even let you act as my knight in shining armour (don’t pretend, you know you love it), as long as you save me from certain death at the hands of a Weasley. (I’m not yet sure which one will get to me first. Maybe they will all join in. Malfoy-hexing might be a family bonding activity over there, who knows?)
There was Scorpius, seated on a table top chattering away with none other than Harry Potter himself.
Draco huffed and made a mental note to have a word about all of this with his mother. But not today. Today was her birthday and they needed to get back on task, which was buying her favourite cake from her favourite bakery as per Scorpius.
Draco smiled at the kind witch in front of him, took a deep breath and explained the reason for his visit.
A few minutes later, still avoiding Harry’s gaze, Draco took a deep breath and spoke, “I’m sorry if-”
Hey Malfoy,
A couple of commercials later, the kiss cam was back on them and Draco huffed exasperatedly, “Oh for Merlin’s sake!”
After a few beats of awkward silence, Harry spoke. “Thanks for inviting me, Draco, I had a lovely time.”
“Sure,” Harry said, and Draco turned to leave. “Uh, wait!” He blurted out, and Draco halted, puzzled.
Harry,
"Where..?!" Harry spluttered.
“Will that be all?” Harry asked.
The Falcon’s Seeker had caught the snitch. There was an air of euphoria throughout the stadium as Harry leapt from his seat and hugged Draco, though at that moment he really didn’t care who had won the game.
Draco: "Teddy? What's a Teddy?" *runs away to bake a cake for Harry*
Once Scorpius had finished his second slice of cake, Draco decided it was time for bed. “Come on darling, you’ve had a long day, it’s time for bed,” Draco cooed and gently lifted his son off the sofa.
“I’m glad; dancing should be fun. I used to take ballet when I was younger.” Draco said, grabbing a towel to wipe his face.
“Mmmm,” they both moaned. “This is gooood! Potter, cut me another piece.”
I was thinking we could meet this Saturday afternoon in my quarters to discuss preparations. Off the top of my head, I can think of:
Harry stood in a corner, watching the scene unfold. He couldn't take his eyes off the man in front of him. So different from the teen he knew. Draco had grown and evolved now that he wasn’t being squashed under the weight of the pureblood nonsense his father spouted. He even had a muggle coffee maker in his room!
Harry,
“You came!” Harry cried as he pushed himself off the wall he was leaning on.
P.P.S. I expect you bright and early on that Quidditch pitch tomorrow, Potter. I’m confident I’ll beat you, even while sleep-deprived.
“Yes, they have Floos in Madrid, Harry,” Draco sassed. “Anyway, enough about Pansy, let's eat, I'm starving!”
“Well, for one thing, whenever I look at him, he's already staring at one of us. I've felt an electric energy when we accidentally brushed fingers. And we’re all adults, we can always have an amicable, mature conversation. I just… I think it's worth a chance.” Harry, ever the Gryffindor, declared.
Harry,
They enjoyed a leisurely breakfast followed by cuddles in bed. Harry gave Draco his gift- a pair of beautiful pearl cufflinks Draco had been eyeing.
Various students kept coming up to Draco and he graciously helped them out.

Hello, we're back after a couple of busy weeks with the last installment of fluff.
I still mourn the fact that I won’t be allowed to tease you about your growing resemblance to our dear Professor Lockhart. I mean, take your ever-growing collection of valentines for one. (Although, isn’t the entire concept of a ‘valentine’ lost when one sends it in the middle of June? I’ll let you answer that one, you’re the expert after all).
“I think we missed dinner. Why don’t you join me in my quarters? I’ll ask the elves to send us some food,” Draco asked with a hopeful glimmer in his eyes.
“Dance with me?” Harry asked.
“Thanks for coming, and for the lovely wine. Oh and that
It wasn't hard to spot Draco. He was seated under a huge tree by the frozen Black Lake. Harry plopped down next to his boyfriend, entwining their fingers together. The snow was falling softly around them.
“Oh who am I kidding, I’m sure-”
Harry nodded.
I’ll just have to find other topics, hmm?
“Pansy,” Draco replied, nonchalant.

Harry hoped he’d read the situation right and whispered, “I’d like to kiss you.”
“How do you know he even likes us like that or that he’d be ok with this?” Draco asked.
“Chocolate éclair,” he mumbled, cream and chocolate smeared around his little mouth. “Harry always lets me try the specials of the day.”
Shall we say next Friday, 7 pm? I’ll be sure to bring my latest baking delicacy (Firewhisky cupcakes) along with my wonderful self. I look forward to these margaritas you promised
Luna had a huge falcon head hat placed precariously on her hair and was serenely looking at the teams warming up on the pitch. Harry smiled fondly before reclaiming his seat next to Draco.

Harry smiled. “I doubt I was of much use, but I can speak for everyone when I say it was fun.”

. I would have punished them but I could understand the appeal — the photograph seemed to have captured your good profile, for once. For some unknown reason, instead of being Vanished immediately, the article ended up on my desk. Think I could get an autograph, oh Chosen One?
“Uh yeah,” he replied, still in shock. After a few beats, he mused, “Wonder why the camera kept coming back to us?”
Harry knew where to find Draco, but he decided to give him some time to collect himself. He finished his breakfast in silence, his eyes drifting over to Neville a few times. He grabbed a muffin and an apple for Draco. He nodded to Neville and was rewarded with a tentative smile in return.
I hid Arthur’s gift in my desk’s drawer — thank you again for helping me find it. I admit that I may have
“Um, not quite, Peony, may I show you the step?” he asked the Ravenclaw student and then proceeded to guide them.
P.S. That owl of yours is a menace! I tried to appease her with treats but she seemed to take this as an invitation to nest in my hair! Teach her some manners, for the love of Circe (and of my pristine hair)!
I’m not complaining, mind you. Not everyone can be as forgiving as you.
Molly Weasley was a gem. When she'd found out that Harry and Draco had begun dating in Eighth year, she'd insisted Harry bring Draco over for Sunday brunch and had welcomed him wholeheartedly.
After a few minutes, the camera zoomed in on them again. Harry groaned and shook his head as Draco covered his face.
“I insist! And please wish Narcissa a happy birthday from me.”

Draco’s not sure what made him do this, but he added, “You should come. I’m sure Mother would like that. Andy and Teddy will be there, too.”
P.P.S. Yeah, I’m meeting with the House later today. Leah is quite torn and the rest of her peers quite irked. It’s going to be a long evening. Wish me luck!
After a series of
While Harry packed up the cake, Scorpius dragged Draco to the display case and showed him all his favourite confections.
“What? But… How is that even...”
“Would you like to go to dinner with me after this?” Harry asked, channeling his inner Gryffindor.
On another note, Molly also mentioned she was planning Arthur’s 65th birthday celebration in June once the kids were all back home from Hogwarts. So we should check the date with her, lest we clash. Two big parties in one month, phew! Though I think Ted and the kids, especially a certain blonde will love it, any excuse to meet up during the hols, eh? He really is quite gone for Vic, it's adorable to watch (except when he doesn't concentrate in class like that time he cast
All my heart,
to go there, Papa. It's grandma and my favourite,” Scorpius cried excitedly, dragging Draco by the hand. “That’s the shop right there,” he squealed and made a dash for it.
PS. They say that in order to remember a new word, one should use it immediately in a sentence. So, um, I ‘ship’ us too. There. Done.
“Our conversation the other night gave me an idea and I began working on it this morning,” Harry said as he piped the cake with concentration. “It’s a champagne cream and fresh strawberry cake. Perfect for a sweet toothed oenophile!” he declared.
Cheers,
Harry let out a contented sigh, and Draco stirred, looking up at him with wide eyes and a soft smile.
me to take over the planning for the party, and she mentioned you would be amenable to help. Something about it being our duty as Godfather and favourite uncle. I think she was trying to guilt trip me — but it’s not necessary. Everyone knows how important Teddy is to us! So, it's not due to any hero complex, it's just my unconditional love for my Godchild.

Teddy is-
“Neville. I see how you look at him, Draco.” Harry stated, his face relaxed and voice breezy, as if he were discussing the weather or something equally mundane.
An hour of rigorous dancing later, the class came to an end and the last of the students left. Draco was flushed and a bit sweaty from all the movement but he looked happy and bright. The evening sunlight glinted off his face, softening his features. Harry thought he looked like a graceful angel.
“Isn't she in Madrid with Luna?”
Harry laughed and gently wiped the boy’s face with a napkin as Draco gaped at them.
“Oh, I like this song,” Draco said wistfully as a new melody started playing on the gramophone.
“Another time, Pans, I have a hot date tonight,” Draco drawled, winking at Harry.
Thank you once again!
“We’re looking for the ‘Floral Pistachio?’” Draco fumbled glancing at Scorpius who nodded effusively.
Please come back. What am I supposed to do, greet all the guests on my own? Shall we also scream ‘surprise’ without you when Teddy arrives or are you planning on being there by then?
“Hi, make yourself comfortable. I’m just finishing this up.”
Yours,
Draco snorted. “No, most purebloods are already trained in the art of ballroom dancing. He just ensured we practised, so we didn’t bring shame to the name of Salazar Slytherin with our bad dance moves.”
“It’s grandma’s birthday and she likes pistachios.”
pray tell, are you? I’ve been at Grimmauld Place for twenty minutes already! Kreacher tells me you’ve gone out to buy some additions for the party… Are you aware of the fact that the party starts in four minutes and a few seconds? (And that’s a loose estimate, you know how Hermione always gets there early!)
The cameraman took pity on them and moved on to another high-profile couple. Cho Chang, Seeker for the Wimbourne Wasps, was here with Fleur Delacour. Cho placed a sweet kiss on her wife’s cheek and the crowd went crazy.
Around 40 minutes into the game, the Captain of the Falmouth Falcons called for a timeout.
After the war, Draco had apologised to Neville along with the other Gryffindors and they were on cordial terms. Once they became professors, Draco and Neville had grown closer. Neville had once discovered a rare plant that would help make a strong and long-lasting nutrition potion. He had excitedly shared this with Draco who had been as enthusiastic as him. They now frequently met for lunch or even dinner sometimes, when Harry had Duelling Club. What had started off as academic bonding had soon turned into a fast friendship and maybe something more.
Harry looks back at Ginny, “I love you, Ginny, you’re one of my best friends, but I’m not going to stop dating Draco,” he says, “You can get onboard, or there’s the door.”
Draco smiles, “Blaise, isn’t my boyfriend,” he says, looking over his shoulder at Blaise, “he’s single.”
“And if it’s human-borne?” he asks frowning slightly.
“So, why’s that so bad?” Cami asks.
Harry smiles, thinking that he may have tormented Draco enough for the moment, “Okay,” he says, leaning over, kissing Draco’s cheek.
“I started with my brother four years ago, and when I saw how I helped him, I wanted to help other vampires, I’m a feeder three times a week,” she explains, “and a lot of the new vampires choose me, so I’m used to a bit of hesitation with the bites, but you’ll get it eventually,” she smiles.
I meant to have this up yesterday, but life sort of happened. Sorry about that guys, but I hope you enjoy this chapter anyway!
Draco nods quickly, “I want you to,” he says quietly.
“It’s more common than people are willing to admit,” Harry murmurs.
Draco rolls his eyes, and smiles, “we’re not friends,” he says looking at Harry, letting silence fall between them as they walk to the living room, “yet.”
Draco is sitting at the table, finishing a bowl of what looks like pink porridge, when Harry walks into the dining room.
“You’ve been avoiding me for an entire week, and now you’re offering me coffee and biscuits?” Harry says.
Harry nods, sitting down beside the bed once more. Harry looks up watching as the matron returns a moment later, setting a second bag on the counter, “for when you’re ready dear,” she says softly, before leaving them to talk.
Harry smiles, looking back at Draco, leaning in kissing him gently on the lips.
Zella smiles happily, “I’ll make more for you Master Malfoy,” she promises.
“We broke up?” he asks.
Draco steps out of the fireplace in his living room and walks into his bedroom. Before Draco can even think about undressing, he hears the fireplace whir.
Harry finishes his breakfast setting his bowl on the table, as Ginny comes out of the kitchen, “What do you guys want?” he asks curiously.
It was only after her son had spilled his own tears that Narcissa hugged her son, so tight Draco thought she might break his ribs.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anthony looks at Draco, “Nothing,” he says, taking the wine from Draco taking a sip.
“Sometimes you just need a hug,” he says.
“And what if the carrier human is turned into a vampire?” Harry asks.
“I told you what would happen if people found out,” Draco murmurs.
Draco swears he stops breathing, watching Harry talk listening to the sound of Harry’s voice, and his heart is beating loud in his ears, he’s sure his heart is going to jump right out of his chest. He can’t speak.
“Being awake during the day, not drinking blood from other humans-“
“I’m sorry, I’m just finding it hard to concentrate on this conversation, because I’m so fucking thirsty,” he says.
“I came to check on you, you were very upset earlier,” he says.
Draco finishes his breakfast, pondering the question for another moment, “Not terrible.”
“Noted,” Harry smirks, “No romance.”
No sooner than she finished saying that, did Draco’s fangs begin to recede.
Draco grimaces, “too noisy.”
“He is my date for this evening,” Draco confirms, “I don’t know if I would go as far as to say we’re dating.”
“I know when something is going on with my best mate,” Ron says, “so what is it?”
“Draco and I have been dating for nine months,” Harry says, “and he’s a vampire, which means he drinks blood, and sometimes if I’m lucky it’s mine,” he says staring back at her.
“Very,” Draco confirms, looking back at Harry, “which is why I need you to talk quicker, otherwise we revisit this conversation later.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says.
Draco notices what Harry was doing, and can’t help but laugh, “If you think you’re going to get me on that sofa, you’ve got another thing coming,” he says, “I need proper back support for what I plan on doing with you,” he smirks.
Harry actually scoffed, and Draco can’t say that he blamed Harry for that, he probably would have done the same.
“You’re the one who wants to get laid,” Draco says.
“You just said you were having a guest over,” Harry said.
“It’s not a big deal,” Harry says.
Draco kneels down, “ready?” he asks, gently guiding Jamie’s hips closer to him.
Draco goes almost an entire month denying himself any opportunity to talk to Harry, he’s not sure why he does it, but he’s been fucking miserable.
THANK YOU VERRY VERRY MUCH FOR READING THIS ENTIRE THING, I know it was very long, but I do hope you enjoyed it! if you're interested there may be additional short stories that follow this one that takes place during the unseen times of this fic. if not, this is the very end of Vampire!Draco and I do hope you liked what you read.
“If you were snogging, then I’m sure he already knows,” Harry mutters.
“It’s alright,” Jamie says, “I don’t mind.”
“Draco was never nice to you Harry,” Ron insists.
Draco nods, his chest heaving gently as he tries to regain his breath.
“Malfoy,” Harry says stepping out of the fireplace, “What’s going on?”
“You weren’t surprised?” Harry asks.
“How can you be with someone like me, and not want to drink from them?” Anthony asks.
Draco smiles, “maybe you should let the blokes talk to you then,” he says, “they’re very nice.”
Harry nods, “It was maybe five when we got back here,” he says, “I gave you a glass of water, and then told you it was time for bed,” he says, “You were such a snob,” Harry laughs, “saying you needed your pajamas, but you didn’t want to wear any of mine, so you pouted and got into bed naked,” he smiles.
Draco gets up, flushing the toilet, before stepping out of the loo, “Oh,” he says, when Harry was standing there, holding out a dressing gown for him. Draco puts on the dressing gown looking back at Harry.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Harry asks.
Draco gently brings his hand up, stroking Harry’s hair, “You were so good for me,” he whispers, and Draco can feel Harry’s lips curl into a smile against his shoulder, “my good boy.”
Harry’s body is so sore, his muscles can barely support himself, as he moves sitting up looking over at Draco whose body was just as sweaty as his, if not more.
Draco closes his eyes, as he feels his top fangs pierce her skin, Camilla gasps softly as she feels Draco’s fangs find her vein on the first attempt.
Draco was lucky enough to own the ground floor unit, he had a large chef’s kitchen, a moderately sized study, grand master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, bathtub large enough to fit four, walk-in shower where Draco could see himself spending hours of his day, two large walk-in closets, and two separate sitting areas. The penthouse also had a smaller princess suite, and one guest bedroom, and off of the main living area, a large guest bathroom. Each penthouse came with their very own house-elf, and Draco had never felt more at home.
“What are you doing here?” he asks.
Draco gets up from the table, holding his hand out for Harry.
Luna smiles, “I’m a Niffler,” she smiles, turning around showing her Niffler tail, “I made it myself,” she grins.
This snaps Draco out of his thoughts, as he turns to Neil, a look of curiosity on his face. Neil raises an eyebrow, and gestures to his left, when Draco looks over Neil’s shoulder, he saw a blonde woman, sinking her fangs into a very handsome wizard’s neck, and his jaw drops slightly, as he realizes he’s surrounded by vampires feeding.
“How do you know Neil?” Harry asks after a moment.
Harry frowns, he didn’t want to get into this with Ron, “You wouldn’t understand,” he says plainly.
“If you ever tell anyone, I’ll murder you,” Draco murmurs.
Harry nods, “Yes” he answers, before reaching over, for Draco’s trousers, quickly working them open, as Draco shrugs his shirt off his shoulders, letting it fall onto the floor. His trousers soon follow, and Harry swears he feels his hands tremble the slightest bit in pure anticipation.
“I know it’s not the highlight of your life or anything, and I’m so sorry it’s happened to you, but I think that becoming a vampire has changed you, and changed the way you see the world, and I like that part of you,” Harry says looking back at Draco.
A moment later, but which felt like minutes, Harry Potter appears in Draco’s fireplace.
Ten minutes later Tracey comes into the kitchen talking to Neville Longbottom, as they get themselves some drinks. Neville tells Draco Happy Birthday, as he gets himself a glass of firewhiskey. Draco says thank you and continues talking to Imogen and Blaise.
“Oh, hi,” Harry says, only a little surprised to see Blaise.
“Put your hands on my hips,” he insists.
“We’re just having a conversation Draco,” Harry says.
Draco nods, “I also need to get some Flitterbloom tomorrow.”
Draco runs over every single bad thing that could happen by saying anything right now, and then he meets Harry’s eyes for a brief moment, “I’m gay.”
Draco watches Harry standing awkwardly outside of the room, he closes his eyes trying to think about how this could have happened to him. How he got this way, he was so lost right now.
Draco shrugs, “You were having fun, I wish I did more stuff like that.”
“I’m interested in trying that out properly,” Draco says, meeting Harry’s eyes, “with you.”
Harry shakes his head, “it’s just something that happens,” he says, “sometimes you drink blood.”
“Thank you,” Toby says, leaning up slightly, “Was that guy your boyfriend?” he asks.
Draco honestly doesn’t know what to say to Harry, he’s never felt that personally. When Draco decided he was gay, he just sort of accepted that he liked boys, and that’s how it was going to be. He didn’t have that internal struggle that so many people do, so he has no advice for Harry.
Harry smiles, “Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me.”
Draco can’t help himself, he pulls Harry close against his body, kissing him hard on the mouth, holding Harry by his waist.
Harry looks solemnly at Draco, “I could never imagine what it’s like to be you, Draco,” Harry says softly, “but I understand why you feel the way you do,” he says, “I understand why you’re so hurt by what’s happened, and I understand that because of what’s happened your whole life has changed, and that you’ve been discriminated against simply because of
“Are you having a good time?” he asks.
Draco nods, “Okay,” he says again, “but later,” he says.
Draco stares back at Harry trying to go over every single thing he ever said to him, and he was sure he had never said that.
Draco smiles, “girls like watching two guys together,” he says into Blaise’s ear, “and girls like guys who are comfortable in their own sexuality,” he says, placing his free hand on Blaise’s hip, pressing his body flush against Blaise’s, “now loosen up,” Draco says.
“I don’t hate it,” Draco says after a moment.
“I don’t remember,” Draco says looking over at Harry, he can’t help but notice the way Harry’s heartbeat seems to grow louder in his ear, he watches Harry shift in the chair, but all Draco can focus on is the vein in Harry’s neck, he can hear the flow of liquid as it runs through his veins, and the next thing Draco knows, he has a pair of long sharp fangs, protruding from his mouth, with a very audible click.
“You did?” Draco asks.
“We’ll get you another drink,” Blaise says against Draco’s ear.
“It’s okay,” he says softly, “we don’t have to get up.”
Glaring at Harry, Draco stands up from his seat, he couldn’t believe Harry had just said that, and in front of his friends, Draco couldn’t be more embarrassed if he tried.
Draco is exceptionally quiet, and it makes Harry wonder if he’s not quite getting it right. Harry was enjoying himself more than he’d willingly admit out loud, but he wasn’t sure if Draco was, he feels Draco’s body go rigid as he reluctantly pulls back to check in with him.
“I know,” Draco murmurs, “I’m just not ready to show them, I need more time.”
Harry looks back at Draco, with a small smile.
“Well what do you want?” he asks.
Draco rolls his eyes, “You also didn’t know I broke up with Astoria, because it’s not relevant.”
“Ginny,” Hermione hisses a moment later.
“Oh,” Harry says staring with wide eyes at Draco, “you’re going to,” he pauses.
Draco is quiet as he watches Harry, he’s still rather sleepy, and he’s not sure he heard Harry correctly, but that look on Harry’s face, says all that Draco needs to know. Draco had been thinking about this recently, but he hadn’t thought it would be this way, but then he thinks what would have been a better way? Draco wasn’t even sure he was ready to be someone’s boyfriend, he surely was never any good at being a boyfriend, actually, he thought of himself as a rather bad boyfriend. But here he was in bed with Harry Potter and, “Harry Potter, do you want to be my boyfriend?”
Draco starts to feel sad for Harry, he doesn’t wish that upon anyone, “Well” he starts, before he clears his throat, “um, if you want to talk another time, we can do that just the two of us” he mutters.
“What?” Ron asks, looking at Harry confused.
“I’m here to help you find out who did this to you,” Harry says, “who attacked you.”
“It’s the only reason you would suddenly care,” Harry says.
Draco nods, “Blaise was just talking to me about it.”
“You can’t tell me,” Harry says again, “You can’t tell me something that might allow me to help you find out who attacked you and turned you into a vampire, something that you say ruined your life, by the way.”
“No,” Harry says firmly, reaching for Draco’s hand, “Just get on the bed,” he says, “and face the other way.”
husband, all those other concubines were just whores and children thieves. It wasn't anything political that she was concerning her pretty head about. But rather than a blonde boy, she was worried about what was happening to him. Not because of his parents, of course, she hated this how this many days of Mourning that was required across the city. It was pointless to her, so what they died. A teenager is now an orphan. Bo ho, go cry me a river, Draco needs to learn to grow up, Lucius too, they're both weak and cowardly. What the Empress was worried about was quite simply that he was being too liked too quickly. He's a spoilt brat and so is that Potter boy.
"Stephaine, you know how I look like one of those dolls that everyone loves and wants, or like anime girls that many people wish were real." I nodded and stayed holding his hand, he didn't seem to mind so I didn't move "Well, it's because I'm a GlassDoll, I'm like a veela, but I can crack, break, and snap as well as shatter, if people look closely enough, they can see a literal layer of glass on my skin and eyes, but I can also bleed, cry, bruise an follow normal human biological process, but because Dolls and Glass in magical world are submissive creatures, yes they are two different magical creatures, the Blacks were Dolls and the Malfoy's were Glass. Their bodies work a lot like betas, well you can imagine what I could get put through at school, I'm practically a toy for people to use at there own will, not caring how I feel about it, because I'll just react accordingly to what's begin done to me. Sometimes, I'm even afraid of my own family, or my friends." He finished, I was shocked and sat next to him, running my hand through his hair "Draco, you're better than that, your better than to let people use you, I've only know you for today, but I can already see that Draco, don't be so scared and if anything helps, you can be assured that I'll never do anything to you." He looked at me and wrapped his arms around me, "Steph? C-can I stay with you tonight?" He whispered looking at me, his eyes shorn with fear and something else, something I couldn't place, but it looked raw, bear completely out, exposed, I nodded immediately, it was then that I could have sworn that I saw red marks on his skin, and handprints on his neck.
"Oh she bothers me, she won't leave me alone, she's had this wired thought that she'll be the next Lady Potter." I paused, what would happen to Potter line if I was to marry Draco? What would I be expected to do? I really don't like the idea of simply ignoring my family and their history.
Our carriages stopped by a village. For breakfast we were told, Susan and Regulus the two eunuchs that joined us had no idea of what just happened as they knocked on our door, although for Regulus it wouldn't have been hard to guess. The Village had a temple and that's where we would be eating this morning and of course taking our prayers. Seeing Daffodil made me smiled and I immediately hugged her as she and my uncle shared a kiss, "How are you felling Draco?" She asked me, kneeling expertly to be eye level with me. Her delicate hand ran through my hair and tucked a blonde lock behind my ear. I felt like shrugging, or combusting into tears and begging to go back.
He would get his rewards eventually. He would be praised for the pain he braved. And he would be remembered for what it helped him achieve.
Getting off the train we walk towards Draco's parents, we smiled and Draco hugged them both, "I hope you two are well, Draco, who?" He fublmed with his robe and faced his worried pearnts "Niel Tracer fifth year, Alarick Brakeson seventh year." His parents looked at each other and held him close "Draco, when we get home, you are following what Healer Marianne gave you." He nodded and we apprrated to the lobby and was left with Lucius. "Harry, we don't blame you for what happened, and if you want to go to sleep for a while just go up to the thrid floor and down two doors to the left." I nodded and tols him that it was fine and went the way he said.
"Hermione if anyone gets hurt, no matter what year, blood status or house, Hogwarts won't be a school it'll just a castle with no standing to its name..." Ron held his head in his hands "You know, we need the founders they'd save Hogwarts, they'd know what to do."
The Dark Lord wanted Draco to be one of the best wizards to ever live, he wanted Draco to continue on his legacy. To make sure that Draco would stand all he had in mind for a teen, it was only fair to have Draco kill the beloved Headmaster. Yes it did particularly break the poor boy, but his determination to succeed was evident to the Dark Lord all the same.
Two weeks later and I was packing my trunk for staying at Malfoy Manor, they'll probably want me out as soon as they see my clothes Draco skipped in and sat joyfully on the bed "You look happy." I remarked as he looked at me and grinned "We're going shopping, they're going to buy you stuff too, no buts and I get out of Hogwarts!!" I smiled and closed my trunk "and wrapped my arm around him "I'm going to see Hermione and Ron okay, I'll be back soon, promise." he nodded and laid back down'
I bet that he'll have chosen Lady Parkinson. How she got through all the tests was unknown to me, as I was sure that her parents tried to marry her off to some older man before the Imperial Chariage got to Parkinson Manor. This plan failed as she is now the second concubine to the Emperor, and is properly reciting lines to parrot to him, his worst annoyance. People just memorising things and being so bland and dull. It's why he doesn't send for concubines because it's all they do. For those who say that our Emperor plays favourites, they are correct. Tom has favourites with all of us.
to August 8th > Draco meets Harry properly as they find each other in the Hall of Preserving Harmony, they go on a walk while talking. Severus turns up and Draco admits he makes him uncomfortable while Harry is awkwardly sat down. By August 7th Draco’s relationship with Tom is established as being odd and special, Tom invites Draco over for tea and they have a heartfelt discussion, Harry comes up at some point in it, Tom gives Draco an important position. Late into the same night Draco wakes up in Tom's bed but falls asleep again after they have a small talk. In the morning (August 8th) Tom pleads with Draco to stay while sounding scared and they have tea together. The POV changes to Harry's as his concubine Hermione wakes him up, he has some worries about how people view him.
But I saw a female girl with long brown hair, with bright honey brown eyes, wearing a fnaf themed green shirt and black trousers  watching them while ironing clothes "She's my maid, you can ask her as many questions as you want about now." We heard a soft thud, turning around I saw that one of the children had hit the nose of the bear it was on, I don't think I've seen Draco, run to anyone so quickly.
Once Harry prorests at the cup I move it. Immediately the smaller teen nuzzles against me, holding onto me tightly and safely. I allow him and rub his back. Our thin white night shirts leave no protection aganist the harsh cold, hence why most of us sleep next to someone else if we can. They also provide no shelter from other's stares. Which truefully, no one really has to deal with. Unless one is sleeping with the Emperor or any of his Eilte, although they would have to find you interesting enough. "Thank you." I nod but wave my hand, he doesn't need to thank me. I feel cold so pull the duvet to cover both of us now that we're no longer lying down on Harry's soft, heavenly mattresses. It takes a while but I realise that Harry's Palace is next to Remus', realistically I should have guessed. They are very close.
Father and mother had been asked to stay at the orphanage along with uncle Severus and Professor Lupin. Meaning that Harry and I had to stay with Neptune, we had a personal driver collect us. I pulled up the barrier between us and the driver.
I saw Draco's wide eyes blink at me, "I-Could I tell you something later?" I nodded and patted down his hair, as he leaned into me, smiling wildly, I could tell that Ron and Hermione were nervous as hell, but what they didn't know was that Draco  was more afraid of them, I ran my hand through his pale hair, attempting to calm him down, at least enough to talk. It worked, for about fifteen minutes. Soon we were making the same path we had been since the start of the year, as we were doing our respective bedtime routines, and got into the bed, the second one not really begin used very often. We slid back into our usual sleeping arrangement, with Draco, curled into me as I wrap my arms around him.
A few minutes later the large double door opened Neptune came in. She was currently ignoring anyone she could, going directly for the little drink table "Good morning-." The male person in the same uniform as the two Aurors we just met look like he had been paralysed
"It depends on the secret." Draco looked down and sniffed, "Do your parents know, whatever you're going to tell me?" He nodded, I sighed and smiled "Hit me." I said, needless to say, Draco looked utterly mortified "NO!" I blinked and covered a laugh, "Not literally, it's an idiom, it means tell me, I probably should have realised that you wouldn't know what it meant." I said sheepishly. Draco blushed and told me everything, about how he kept going to Dumbledore, how he needed to see multiple healers, how his parents had reacted, how his friends had been dealing with similar problems, just not nearly a much as he had 'Becuase he had purer blood, he was more appealing begin what he was'.
"Draco, what's wrong?" I caught his shoulder as he went into the bathroom, He turns his head, tears falling from his face like a waterfall, I kneeled down and wiped his cascading tears as he sobbed and sobbed into my shoulder "It hurts so much, I can't take it anymore." I rocked him back and forth as I saw a perfect crack in the side of his face, I ran my finger down it, as Draco shut his eyes and bit down into my robe "Does everything about you have to be perfect?" I asked myself, but he heard me anyway "Y-you think I'm perfect?" He sobbbed, frightned,"Draco, to me you'll always be perfect, there's nothing you could ever do that would upset me, to the point of me leaving you, there s nothing you could do that will do that." I told him and kissed his forehead "Harry, you don't know the weight of your words." He warned, still crying, I cupped his cheek "Yes I do, Draco I mean them, I promise you I do." I wiped away his tears as we just stayed there, holding each other We lost track of time when Snape came in, to find us "Come with me the both of you, there won't be any point in either of you going to class." We Looked at each other and followed him.
I completely forgot to update this on Tuesday, very sorry!
Alice was made to look like a slut and whore, chained to the floor, legs folded and spread out. After reach answer that displeased Daffodil the whip of twigs beat her thighs and legs, inching close to her inactive reproductive organ, regardless it would be nice to beat. This continued until she admitted to being ordered to snoop around by Bellatrix.
Keeping his eyes open he watched as Lord Voldemort pressed the clean knife to where his tongue met his jaw. He felt his heat beat pick up, it was no longer steady, rapid and efficient. His core had tied itself into a knot at his center. Oh Lords no! He saw Lord Voldemort smirk growing. This wasn't what he would imagine this planning out.
I felt someone soft breathing, by my neck carefully moving to face whoever was beside me, I saw a small ball of navy blue. I carefully tried to sit up, but Cygnus was glued to my side, I gave up trying and just laid back down, only to feel the bed move and a sniffle "Where's Papa?" I looked up to see Cygnus' lip quiver, I immediately held him "Hey, hey, Draco will be here soon, no need to cry." I carefully rocked him in my arms, I was sure it was only a matter of time before his sister woke up, but Draco would be back soon, I hoped.
My uncle nods and I let her sit on the bed, almost on my lap. Slowly I run a hand through their hair; Susan's sobs died down and eventually they were calm enough to start talking properly, they explained that they overheard a conversation between the Emperor and The Minister, it seemed to be a heated argument and Tom broke something in his room, an ornament that the Empress had gifted him.
Blair - 18
"Harry I care a lot about you, and I never want to see you hurt, terrified, or anything else like it, I want to be the person you go to when you feel like that, I want to be the one you care about in the same way. I want to be the person you can always come to for help, and eventually, I want to be the person you trust, with everything and the person you spend the rest of your life with."
"What do you mean
"You can't be serious. Think of the competition, the fun, the air in the face! You cannot just abandon all of it! It's Quidditch!" Harry kept repeating his words because there was no way for him to explain it differently. It was plainly obvious for him how much of a life priority Quidditch was. And he
Please, no.
Both of them were lying in their respective beds, staring at the ceiling in complete silence, their faces not friendly-looking at all.
So that's what he did. He went out of the room and immediately spelled the lights off.
What surrounded them was, for the moment, their new shared bedroom. Neither of them had been able to start believing that it was real. They really were being forced to go through such nonsense. It was crazy, and since they entered the room, they hadn't been able to open their mouths. Probably because the moment they did, they would scream.
Harry had not slept much that night, and when he decided that it was enough rolling in bed, the sun had still not risen. He really did not want to wake up Malfoy so early, considering how little he usually slept, so he stayed in bed, with the crimson curtains opened just enough to see the green bed. All his senses were focused on what happened in the room. He knew Malfoy was able to sneak in and out of rooms like a snake, with no one (not even him) noticing, but he figured that if he really concentrated on the task, he would catch him before he left again to do whatever he was doing.
And the relief spread through his chest like a wonderful ointment.
"No, Potter. You are fine," Draco said, and Potter chuckled. It was embarrassing. But it was more embarrassing the way the chuckle made Draco's stomach react.
Pansy laughed ironically.
Harry gave him a sarcastic look but decided not to make the obvious joke.
"I cannot! I want to wash my face!"
"Stop it! I did not-"
"Malfoy's big mouth. He shouted some shit, and I broke his nose again."
"What the fuck do you know?" exploded Draco at last, forgetting about the mask. "Merlin, you still believe that you are a wonderful person and you only mix up with the most wonderful people in the Wizarding World. It's pathetic! Wake up, Potter! You gave
Really, stop it already. Go back to sleep. I am
Gladly, the topic changed after that. There was a lot to catch up on in the field of Quidditch.
Harry glared at her, and Hermione felt like she deserved it. When she didn't know what to do, her coping mechanism was to ask questions. Why. How. Anything that could give her more information. More information and fewer feelings. That was her preference. But Harry was on the verge of exploding with emotion, and her questions were not helping.
Fuck.
"I brought food from the kitchens," said Harry. "You want some?"
"What is the lesson you learnt, Mr Potter?" asked McGonagall. "Why have you not fought?"
"Because you have never in your life been able not to satisfy your every need."
Maybe Potter was not going to accept the dare after all. Draco had considered that possibility straight away, but he didn't want to accept it. He knew that it was a pretty insane thing, to have sex with Potter, but Draco was, well, not excited, but optimistic about it. He needed Potter to dive into the dare and couldn't have him back down. It was a really great plan to distract him, and Draco didn't feel like rethinking the whole thing just because Potter didn't know how to keep his promises. Who did he think he was anyways? Accepting with all that enthusiasm, kissing him as if he had been born for it, passing on contagious diseases that made Draco all jittery and warm inside, and then ignoring the hell out of him the next morning? He could not do that! Not that Draco didn't know how infuriating and outrageous Potter always was, but waking up before him just so that they would not talk in the morning? Avoiding his gaze just because? And was he ever going to finish that bloody toast?
Draco punched him in the shoulder and turned his head away from him in a weak attempt of getting his dignity back. But Potter, the moron, continued laughing and casually punched him back. It was a painfully friendly punch and Draco felt like crying. How dared he.
"Why not?" he said, shrugging it off. "Haaaaarry, are you there? Did you kiss the ferret or can I stop having nightmares about it?"
"Don't you get it? I owe you nothing-"
"Yes, Professor."
And Harry
Malfoy swallowed and his lips parted slightly.
"The only person you would lower yourself to be with would be Potter, which obviously-"
"What the-," shrieked Malfoy as he opened the door and found his arm trapped in Harry's hands. He was wearing just a bathrobe. And he had not brushed his hair. Which was kind of wet.
But she could have been.
"I don't know, Hermione! Maybe because I know that he didn't want to hurt her- he truly didn't want to hurt Katie. And he cannot be that bad if he is losing his sanity over whatever it is that he is doing."
Harry, obviously, did not know what the hell Snape was talking about. He alarmingly looked for Hermione for a quick summary of the class, but she was in the other corner of the class, partnered with Pansy Parkinson.
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"This is supposed to be just sex."
"That's right!" said Harry. "Maybe Malfoy does not scream in dreams, but he keeps speaking in unbearable shrieks that piss off everyone in a four-mile radius. And he might like to pretend that nothing affects him, but when he losses control, he can be extremely loud- Ouch."
But then Malfoy's pale face turned red. Red. Like a fucking red light. Like an apple. A red apple. Something in Harry's insides rejoiced. Like what the hell. Malfoy was brilliant red. Shiny red. Harry
He was asking for it. Fucking twat. Harry hated Malfoy for being able to get inside his head, but he hated himself because the Slytherin had been right. Cedric and Sirius, they were both his fault, and for that he hated himself far more than he hated fucking Malfoy.
Draco was too conscious that he was talking too much, and that what he was saying made no sense. But there was no way he would show Potter how nervous he was.
Draco did not answer to that. It was bad enough that it had definitely counted for him in a sickening, horrible way. He was not planning on ever discussing it with Potter.
Malfoy's fucking mouth.
"That's splendid. So why exactly did you tell everything to the weasel and the mudblood?"
"You are so stupid. You know what? Okay. The counter spell is
"NO!"
Potter stayed quiet for a couple of never-ending seconds, which did not help to ease the tension in Draco's body. And then Draco saw him standing up with the corner of his eyes, and walking towards his bed. It was not a very long way, but it took him forever and Draco was ready to jump out of bed and punch Potter in the face just so that he would walk faster and end his agony.
, he probably didn't understand the consequences of using a map like that one. And that's when he realised.
. Like in what universe. Then again, Harry was visually impaired.
That was something Harry really did not want to discuss with his teachers.
It was not very clever of the Dark Lord to initiate his young Death Eaters in the job with impossible missions. But then again, one of His characteristic personality traits was that he did not care at all about people, Death Eaters or not. And He was obviously seeking revenge for Lucius' failure, not trying to teach Draco anything. The serpent wanted followers, blindly loyal followers like Aunt Bella or terrified fools like Pettigrew. Followers instead of supporters with minds of their own. Draco's Father had pretended to be above that, had pretended to be respected by the Dark Lord. And he had failed miserably because the Dark Lord's respect was not something one could achieve.
Draco could not talk properly. He was breathing heavily. He started shaking his head, as if he wanted to get rid of something.
Harry rolled his eyes but shrugged his shoulders to accept the reprimand.
Malfoy opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but then turned and hid under his blankets. Harry also wanted to say something else -ask him, try to understand what was going on with him-, but he didn't know how to, so he stayed quiet.
They fell asleep like that, in the comfy shelter they found in each other's arms.
"And what about the matters of the bedroom? How are you and Mr. Malfoy holding on?" he questioned in a serious tone but, Harry was terrifyingly sure, amused eyes.
thanks for reading :) hope you liked it, tell me what you think!!!
"You don't get to arrive at this time of the night to a room you share with me looking like shit and expect me not to ask!"
"So what are you suggesting?" asked Ron.
"FUCK, FUCK, NO. Why?! CEDRIC, NO!
He sat on the floor, near his bed, so that he could rest his back once in a while. He liked sitting there.
"But it's not the same!"
Come on, it could not be that hard to make Ron and Hermione believe that there was nothing between him and Malfoy.
"Watch me. If they want to give us detention, they should be here, and it is not my fault that I have a busy schedule. Already fifteen minutes passed, Potter, and that is definitely too much."
Draco could feel the noisy presence of Potter walking slightly after him. It had been two weeks already, and they had become used to the other's presence. They were used to the silence now.
. He was getting worked up, and Snape would not have it.
"I'm eating, Potter. I don't need you watching me, by the way. And no need to talk either. You are allowed to go to sleep."
They both walked silently through Hogwarts endless corridors.
"You are gross and smelly and if you don't move right now, I'll push you."
"See?" Harry dropped his arm at last but kept making fun of him. He once again contorted his face into his best posh expression. "
"Pity that your hygiene will have to wait until I finish my breakfast."
in his green irises. It was sexual. It was bloody criminal. And it was destroying Draco. His body was divided between flight or fight responses. Running away was his most used strategy. It had always been. Flight was the safest option, the most reasonable. And Draco's legs were ready to
"Shut up. You don't know shit.
Draco was wide awake now, and all he could think about was how had Potter
. As if he had something in the back of his throat. It was gorgeous. "I'm done, anyway. It is always an absolute loss of time to share air with you."
"And your plan is to keep them apart? How do you think you are going to do that?"
And Draco was still standing there, now face to face with a sleepy and sweaty Potter. Which was an image that he was never going to forget and that would haunt him forever after.
"To the point, Parkinson."
"Why?" she asked, interrupting his nervous talk before it could start.
"Talk naked?" he asked weakly.
Ron covered her mouth with his hand, and dragged her through Hogwart's corridors until they found an empty classroom. He closed the door loudly and pushed her against it, still covering her mouth. Hermione glared at him furiously, and neither of them would ever mention how red Ron's ears and Hermione's cheeks were.
Harry blushed furiously as he returned to their shared room. Furiously as in "with fury". As in "fuck off, Dumbledore".
"We are in a class, Potter. Do you not care about your hero standards anymore?"
“Anthony,” Draco says.
Harry looks back at Draco and feels he should apologize for immediately jumping to the conclusion that Draco might want revenge for what’s happened to him, “What are ‘vampire plans?’” he asks curiously.
Draco smirks, “Are you attracted to me?”
“I asked why you think I had reason to be there that night,” Draco says.
Draco furrows his brows, trying to remember why he would have gone there, was he planning on meeting someone? Why would he choose to meet someone there? More importantly, why would he have wanted to go there?
Draco stares back at her, “Why is this happening?” he asks.
“Whatever,” Draco says again, pouring his blood into a mug, before he frowns, “Zella,” he calls, “I have no idea what I’m doing, can you warm this for me?” he asks when she appears.
“Never,” Toby says, looking back at Draco.
Forcing his eyes back open, Draco looks down at Harry on his knees. Harry’s hand has disappeared into his own trousers, and a visible wet spot has formed on the front of his trousers.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I wasn’t doing anything.”
Izzie nods, looking back at Draco.
“Just let me do this properly,” Draco says with a voice so gentle, if Harry didn’t know Draco so well, he wouldn’t know it was Draco Malfoy speaking these words.
Draco’s eyes flutter as Harry places his hand gently against Draco’s waist, causing him to wake up.
Harry sighs, “He’s not so bad,” he says, “he can actually be kind of nice.”
Harry sits down across from Draco, letting the quiet sit between them, he’s not sure how to comfort Draco, but he can at least be here if Draco decides he wants to talk.
“What?” Draco asks.
Draco pulls on his dressing gown as he gets out of bed, after nearly an hour.
“Fuck” Harry moans, arching his back.  Draco’s movements are not slow, as he thrusts into Harry, and Harry wants to fucking beg him to make him come. Draco has complete control over his body and the way it moves, and he knows exactly what Harry needs, and he gives Harry exactly what he needs.
“Please, now,” Harry murmurs, “Please, Draco.”
Until this moment Draco hadn’t even thought about how he might navigate a romantic relationship with his new condition. He was still figuring out the whole vampire thing, sure he enjoyed dating, but he wasn’t looking for anything serious or long term, but how would that work? Would Draco only ever be compatible with another vampire? How many gay vampires were there out there? Could he sustain a romantic relationship with a human? Draco feels stupid that, that thought never crossed his mind before Anthony pointed it out to him.
Draco looks back at Harry, “I don’t know how to make coffee,” he says.
Harry looks back at Draco, “Serious?” this was the one thing that actually shocked him.
“The last thing I want is to live in a tiny one bedroom flat, with horrible neighbors, with noisy children and barking animals,” Draco says rolling his eyes.
Harry moans as he squeezes his eyes shut, as Draco’s finger enters him. God, it’s so good, the stretch is almost painful, but Draco’s finger moves in a fluid motion, keeping the uncomfortable stretch from burning. Draco slides in another finger, with another lubrication charm, and Harry’s back is arching off the bench, his hips meeting Draco’s hand, and he’s moaning loudly without having any time to register what’s actually happening to him. White hot pleasure flows through Harry’s core as Draco’s fingers find his prostate, and Harry actually screams.
Draco smiles, kissing Harry’s neck again sucking gently, rubbing his thumb over the slit of Harry’s cock, “You’ve been so good for me,” Draco whispers against Harry’s ear, nibbling at his earlobe.
Neil grins, “come let me introduce you.”
Harry nods, “I’ll probably be inclined to agree with them on certain occasions,” Harry says with a smile, “but this Draco Malfoy, is someone I like a lot,” he says, “someone I want to spend a lot more time with, getting to know your secrets, and letting you know mine,” Harry says watching Draco, “I want this, Draco, I want you.”
Draco smiles, looking over at his friends dancing with each other, “Go join them,” he smiles.
“It’s hard to explain,” Draco says, “but it’s sort of like if you look through a telescope, and you focus in on something farther away, and the far away thing jumps to the front of your vision, and it’s the only thing your vision focuses on.”
Draco can’t actually believe this is happening to him, but he refuses to let himself feel sorry for himself, he was Draco Malfoy, and vampire or not he had pride in himself.
“Are you alright?” Harry asks turning off the shower, reaching for a towel.
“Can I get you anything else Master Malfoy?” she asks pleasantly.
Harry steps inside the room and Draco closes the door behind him, “sit anywhere I guess,” he says walking back to his glass.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist, deciding to let him have whatever he wanted, “Come on.”
“Because it’s food,” Harry says.
Harry’s eyes slip shut, as Draco’s lips meet his, Harry melts into the kiss, Draco’s lips are soft, and gentle against Harry’s. Draco’s tongue slips past Harry’s lips, and Harry moans softly, as Draco kisses him. Draco pulls back a moment later, letting their lips linger, just out of reach of the other’s, for just one silent moment.
“Okay,” Draco says unbuttoning the blazer, while Blaise sorts through his shoes.
Draco leans in slightly, as he kisses Harry back, his hand finding its way into Harry’s soft dark hair, and he’s sure he’s developed an erection that wouldn’t go unnoticed, though he really hopes Harry doesn’t notice. Harry’s tongue breaches Draco’s lips, and Draco’s lips part, a tiny whimper getting caught in the back of his throat, and it takes everything in him not to roll his hips right then and there.
Draco looks back at Harry, “going once, going twice…”
“The Aurors,” she says, “They waited for you to regain consciousness, but when you were still unconscious the following day they left, but there is one who has been coming in the evenings to check on you, I can call them now if you’d like.”
“Did it not go well?” he asks.
Draco pulls back in the opposite direction, “No,” he says, he was absolutely done with the cuddling for the day, he wanted his space now. He liked Harry, but this was too much for Draco in such a short period of time.
“Well if you insist,” Neil smiles, before going off to dance with Luna.
“Ah, Mister Malfoy, you’re awake,” Draco looks over to his left, finally taking in his surroundings, and the uncomfortable bed.
“She’s a dancer,” Harry says, “She graduated two years before us, she was a Ravenclaw.”
Draco shakes his head, “It’s fine, it’ll heal,” he says, looking back at Harry, “This is your flat?” he asks.
Draco had heard of Winsworth’s Bridge, it was an upscale wizarding establishment, that catered to the wealthier wizarding community, his parents had his sixteenth birthday party there, invited everyone they knew, and spent a lot of money on it.
“Let go,” Draco says looking down at Harry.
“I need to shower,” Draco says, “you’re going to have to let me up eventually.”
“Draco,” Anthony says setting his glass down, “Don’t do that.”
“I’m not ready to go yet,” that smile would make Harry say yes to just about anything.
“Just give me a minute,” Draco says, reaching behind him, “Just need to get this off-“
Draco watches Harry, “How did I get here?” he asks.
“We went to the Gargoyle’s Hideout, I figured you were going to need a drink after talking to Astoria,” Blaise explains, “You said it had to be that night, you couldn’t wait anymore to tell her, and you made me promise to make you do it, you don’t remember that?”
“I hope no one ever describes me as ‘alright, I guess’” Harry says looking at Draco.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I do still enjoy tea, I haven’t suddenly stopped eating,” he says, before calling Zella in to make some tea for Harry. Draco takes a slow drink from his mug, managing to keep it in his mouth this time around. “Thank you, Zella,” he says, when she sets the second tray on the table, tea, milk, sugar, and biscuits.
“Ah,” Ron smiles, “Want her to yourself, eh,” he says, “fine, I’ll find my own.”
Draco watches Harry for a second longer before he leans down, grasping the side of Harry’s face, kissing him hard on the mouth. This Harry had not expected, he feels Draco’s thumb gently stroking his cheek before breaking the kiss, and Harry just blinks back at Draco, waiting for an explanation.
Harry smiles, watching Draco help Izzie put her shirt back on.
“Please Harry?” she tries again.
“Oh,” Mandy smiles, “Blaise?” she asks.
Harry nods, “We did, and he told us that you were talking to Astoria and that the two of you went to talk alone, and he said that Astoria came back maybe twenty minutes later, saying that she was going to leave,” Harry explains.
“Do you mind if I touch you?” Draco asks.
“Well I don’t think it’s that weird, and I won’t bother you while you do what you need to,” Harry says.
Before he could do or say anything else, Harry can feel Draco coming in his mouth. Harry whimpers softly as he pulls back slightly, so he doesn’t choke himself, sucking slightly harder as Draco’s cock twitches ever so slightly as he orgasms. Harry quickly rubs the head of his cock, his own orgasm was near.
“Well I sort of had plans,” he says glancing down at his watch.
Blaise looks at Draco for a moment, before giving in putting his hands on Draco’s waist, letting himself move against Draco with the music.
“What can I do for you?” Draco asks.
Harry looks over at Ron, “What?”
Harry frowns, he didn’t like Ginny his best friend calling him insane, “I told him it was alright,” he repeats himself, “I even asked him to do it.”
“How did you know we were in here?” Draco asks, he had put a charm on the bedroom, so anyone in here would have privacy from the rest of the party.
Draco shrugs, “It was bound to happen, I suppose,” he says, “I’m sorry about the things they’re saying about you.”
Harry leans back on the marble bench, his back arching slightly, as he watches Draco perform a protection spell. Harry’s belly buzzes with excitement, as Draco moves between his legs with a lubrication charm. Draco watches Harry shudder, and he performs an additional lubrication charm, before kneeling down pressing his index finger against Harry’s entrance.
“That’s not how being angry works Draco,” Harry murmurs.
“I don’t know, I’m not a vampire healer,” Draco says, “I only know what I’ve been told, and I don’t even know any vampires with immunity to ask.”
Harry watches Luna for a long moment before he reaches over, giving her a hug, “congratulations,” he says, “I’m really happy for you and Luna,” he says, starting to wonder if he could ever have that with Draco, then he tosses the thought from his head, this was not the time for that, “and I swear I won’t say anything to anyone,” he says forcing a smile as he releases her.
“I insist,” she says, “It’s alright.”
“Ah,” Draco nods, “Alright, I’ll see you later then.”
“It was rude of me,” Harry agrees, “I’m sorry.”
“You think it could be the real thing then,” she says softly, taking the sweater from him, sliding it off the hanger.
Draco nods, “It’s not even that I mind the watching, but maybe be a bit more subtle with it.”
“Don’t you have a list of vampires somewhere?” Draco asks.
Draco rolls his eyes, “whatever.”
“What about him?” Harry says smiling slightly.
“Fine, do it if you want,” he says, “but there will be consequences.”
Ten minutes later Draco is finally ready to go, he slips his wand into the inside of his blazer pocket, “let’s go then,” he says.
Draco’s cock, was pressed against the back of Harry’s throat, and Harry’s lips were red and swollen, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he was going to be able to last, but he knew he wanted this to last all night.
“Lucius please!” Narcissa snarls at her husband.
“And when you and Little Miss Pretend Potter, were living together?”
Ginny watches Harry pull down the red sweater, inspecting it before he hands it over to her.
Draco is quiet for a full minute before he speaks, “I probably wouldn’t have nicer personality traits had this not happened to me,” Draco says agreeing with Harry, “It is something that I’m learning to live with, I don’t think I’m quite to the point where I’m exactly happy with the way things are, but I think that I could get to that point eventually.”
“Classy,” Meghan grins.
“He’s a Slytherin,” Ron points out, “they’re all scary.”
“Okay,” Draco says before leaving the bedroom, going to find Zella to make him breakfast.
“You talk to him?” Ron asks dumbly.
“What woman?” Draco asks.
Neil nods, “there is, but it’s different for everyone,” he says, “I like to get a steady flow going before I swallow, others like Meghan,” he says gesturing to the tiny vampire, with long dark hair, feeding on a woman dressed as a Jarvey, “she likes a slow drip.”
Harry looks back at Draco, “This is my day off,” he says taking a sip of his tea.
A few moments later, Zella enters the room, “It’s an Auror sir, Harry Potter.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, looking up to see who was standing in front of him.
“I bet I would,” he presses.
“Great, so you want to go to the cinema or something?” he asks.
Harry swallows around Draco’s cock before he pulls off. Draco breathing heavily as his head fills with orgasmic fog, he opens his eyes a moment later, glancing down at Harry before he says, “Shall I take care of that for you?”
Draco senses he knows what Harry wants to say, “I didn’t realize you had such a praise kink,” Draco says, but it’s not in a malicious way, more curiosity than anything, but Draco couldn’t say that it didn’t interest him at all.
“What do you want?” Draco asks next.
“Dancing with Blaise,” Draco says after a moment.
“And if he hadn’t been, he would still be that pompous asshole,” Ginny says.
It’s a Saturday afternoon, and Draco is sitting alone at the three broomsticks in a booth with his textbook sat on the table, having a butterbeer when Astoria Greengrass walks in and spots Draco from across the room, and she strides right over to him.
“I’m used to that, I don’t need you protecting me,” Draco says.
Draco shrugs, “That’s father.”
“Hello Astoria,” he says, looking up at her.
Draco’s eyes widen in shock.
“Suck my cock,” Draco says barely above a whisper, “I want you to suck my cock,” Draco says looking down at Harry, meeting his eyes.
Draco’s interest peaked, “Then be a good boy for me.” Draco watches the way Harry’s body visibly shudders at his words, and Harry quickly pulls off his undershirt, and slips his pants off, kneeling naked on the bed.
“Sometimes I get a bit jealous,” Harry says, looking back at Draco.
“Well we could definitely get you drunk enough to make some bad decisions if that’s really what you want,” Harry says laughing, “nice little thing like you won’t have any problems finding a bloke to take you up on any offer you propose.”
Harry nods.
“Draco, it’s okay,” he says, “be vulnerable, be sad, be angry, but don’t pretend this is nothing.”
“Draco,” Harry says quietly, looking back at him.
“Zella can do it,” Draco says, starting to walk into his bedroom.
“Perfect,” Harry mumbles.
Neil smiles, walking them to an empty spot on one of the sofas, “Cami is great with beginners,” Neil says, “She’s got good veins.”
Draco watches Harry for another moment, before bringing the glass to his lips, letting the blood pass his lips, with minimal mess, before setting the glass back on the table.
Draco had feelings about what he had said earlier, that Draco just wasn’t addressing.
Draco smiles, “All I want is a party,” he insists.
Harry watches Draco, they had such different upbringings, he starts to wonder if they could really be together in a relationship. They were so opposite.
“So what do you say?” Harry asks.
“Okay,” Jamie agrees, pulling his shirt back on before Draco helps him up from the couch.
Blaise rolls his eyes, “whatever, I’m not the one taking two hours to get dressed.”
Harry looks at Draco for a moment before nodding, this was what Draco wanted, and Harry wanted to give Draco exactly what he wanted. Harry bites his lip, but he is unable to stop himself from moaning as Draco’s fingers thrust into him.
“You’re so quiet,” Harry whispers, his eyes turning down for a brief moment.
Draco looks at Harry, “Well I’d like if you didn’t watch me like a sideshow.”
“I’ve been there before,” Draco confirms, “Not in a few years though.”
“Well it’s going to be kind of hard to hide the fangs, and the aversion to light,” Draco snaps, “What’s left for people to do or say about us that they haven’t already, huh father? What?” Draco says.
Harry shakes his head quickly, “I mean, I do want this” he says eagerly.
Draco spends the next week avoiding Harry in every capacity. Disapparating whenever Harry would arrive via Floo, and purposefully staying away from his house, staying with Blaise for two days, but Harry was determined to see Draco Malfoy.
“Must you be so indecisive,” Draco says walking out of his closet, to chastise Blaise.
Harry could not stop himself, as he leaned down toward Draco’s lap, the head of Draco’s cock glistening with pre-come, taking his cock into his mouth. Harry's lips stretch slightly as he takes Draco’s cock into his mouth, and he moans letting his eyes slip shut. Harry tastes Draco on his tongue as he takes him further into his mouth.
Harry nods, watching after Draco watching for a minute before sighing heavily, slumping down in his seat. Five minutes later Harry gets up clearing the table. Harry starts to wonder about Draco when he doesn’t see him after two hours.
Harry feels himself visibly blush this time, “er-no,” he says, reaching into his cloak pocket pulling out a notepad, “Uh, have you ever heard of Winsworth’s Bridge?” Harry asks.
“You don’t get off that easily,” Harry says, holding tighter to Draco’s hand.
Draco laughs, “Fine,” he agrees, before walking back to his bedroom, making his way to the bathroom.
Draco nods, letting himself lean into Harry, “This is great,” he smiles.
“Punishment,” Draco says, “a vampire who is caught hurting someone on purpose, will be defanged and when a fang is pulled out, it takes a hundred years for it to grow back,” he says.
“Potter, I cannot decode whatever it is you’re trying to say right now, you’re going to have to use complete sentences,” Draco says.
“It’s not like that,” Draco says.
Harry looks at Draco, “Yes you did,” Harry says softly.
“Is it true?” Lucius asks when Draco arrives back home.
“No,” Draco corrects him, “I said I had plans.”
“Because,” she snaps back at him, “you honestly thought that you being anything but straight would make us love you any less,” she says harshly, “Harry,” she says regaining control over her voice, “if anyone deserves to be happy, it’s you, and if you’ve found someone who makes you happy, whether that person is a girl or a boy, it doesn’t change the way we see you,” Hermione says softly.
“Yes, love?” A silky voice that makes Harry feel like he’s dreaming.
“Ah,” he mutters, “I would like a glass of B negative, hot.”
“He should,” Draco says, “He’s too good, people wouldn’t think that anymore if they knew about me.”
“You know her?” Harry asks.
Draco smiles, “If I had a thing for women, you would be my first choice,” he says.
“No Draco,” she says softly after a moment, wiping his tears with her gentle fingers, “I’m only sad you felt you couldn’t say anything sooner.”
“I refuse, to let you feel that for me,” Draco snarls, “because of me,” he says, “I want you to be happy, with all the people in your life, every person you choose to be in your life, even if I don’t get on with that person, it shouldn’t feel like there’s a split in the room, because that doesn’t feel good for anyone involved.”
“Okay,” Draco says, going to answer the door.
“Want a firewhiskey?” Anthony asks.
“I don’t remember any of that,” Draco says.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Really.”
“Accio bottle,” Draco calls, reaching his hand toward the bathroom, and a bottle of lubricant flies into his hand.
“Oh, I don’t know, probably self-control, yeah,” Draco snarls.
“It’s your birthday party, why would you want my friends to come?” he asks curiously.
Neil smiles, “Thanks Luna,” he says, “I’m glad you’re having fun.”
Harry smiles, watching Draco. His blonde hair is a mess, and his eyes are so gentle, it makes Harry want to sweep him into his arms and kiss him. Draco looks so different in the privacy of his own bedroom, in his own bed, and Harry thinks he might love this man.
Draco hates the way he’s actually scared of his body right now. He watches Harry exit the room, and he can’t help but drag his fingers across the long fang, he gasps, feeling the fang pierce the tip of his finger.
Harry’s heart is racing, he’d only been thinking about doing that all night. Harry wasn’t sure he could though, Draco was already taller than him without the extra four inches his heels were giving him, and as much as Harry wanted, he wasn’t sure he could reach those beautiful lips which were begging to be kissed.
“I think I know who attacked you,” he says looking back at Draco.
Harry nods in agreement, “I think you’re right,” he says, getting up.
A few days later Draco crawls into bed late at night, Blaise was still awake, so it couldn’t have been that late.
“What?” Ginny says shocked, “How could you- Why would you- I mean, what?!”
“Whatever,” Draco says, walking back into his closet, pulling out a pair of black trousers, before hanging them back up.
Draco ponders this for another moment, “What else do you know about her?” Draco asks hoping that something would help jog his memory of that night.
Harry can’t help but laugh, Draco had described his flat, minus the children. His neighbors had two dogs though, and they went at it all the time.
