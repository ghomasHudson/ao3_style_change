“Yeah, just, she’s teething,” Harry responded, and both she and Narcissa winced. “She’s fine most of the time,” he added, “but she was having a particularly rough day and he was kind of overwhelmed.”
“Earlier, I might have gotten a tiny bit irritated at Blaise for having gone out with you and not told me about it. Which may or may not have been rooted in latent jealousy.”
Latching on to the opportunity to escape what had to be one of the most embarrassing moments of Harry’s life, he quickly began talking to her about the things they needed to do to clean up the house, driving logistics, and portkey times.
Harry wasn’t the only one who had noticed; Draco and Hermione were looking in the same direction as Harry, expressions concerned. The rustling was coming closer, and it was moving fast. By now, everyone was watching in various states of unease. Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and cast a hasty shield charm over them all, and several of the others followed suit just before a huge wildcat broke through the brush into the clearing and bounced off of the bubble of charms. It recovered quickly, shaking off its disorientation, and began to prowl a circle around them.
“Fuck me,” Draco answered immediately, the words slipping from him unbidden. Now that they were out, though, he decided that he very much stood by them.
short shorts belonging to Ginny—but he’d eventually conceded to practicality when Draco had begrudgingly offered a pair of extremely slim-cut jeans and Ginny had traded out her shorts for what was, on her, an oversized flannel shirt. On Blaise, it fitted in a way that read more “lumberjack stripper” than anything else, which seemed to please him immensely.
“I tried,” Harry said, looking down at his hands but not pulling away from Draco. “Unfortunately, that didn’t stop strangers from stopping me in the street to comment on things that they never should have known in the first place. The press doesn't bother me as much now, but it’s only because I make an effort to be as boring as possible.” He finally looked up, his eyes crinkling slightly in the corners as the beginnings of a smile returned to his face. “Also, Hermione threatened to sue them for so much money the paper would fold if they invaded Teddy’s privacy, so they won’t risk coming near me when we’re together anymore. I may be a public figure, but he sure as hell isn’t.”
“This,” he said, gesturing between their naked bodies with his cigarette before taking another drag. “Us. Obviously. What else would I be talking about?”
It had been too much to hope, he supposed, that his mother would make it a full week before she began pestering him about his love life. “That won’t be necessary.”
The silence, broken only by the clinking of silverware against porcelain, lasted just long enough for Draco to begin to think that maybe he could get away from this dinner without wanting to stab himself in the hand with his fork. Of course, as soon as the thought crossed his mind, Lucius had to open his mouth.
I’M SO SORRY!! I know this is an awful place to leave things, but I swear I’ll make it up to you tomorrow! I hope you enjoyed the party, other than that final bit 😬
“No, it’s fine!” Perry laughed, bumping his shoulder against Harry’s. “Relax, Harry. I just mean it’s not
“Stop apologizing. You’re obviously preoccupied.” Perry studied him for a moment and then seemed to come to a decision. “Alright, fuck it. Tell you what. I’m going to kiss you right now, okay?”
He wrote a letter to take to the Owl Post Office in the village when it opened in the morning. Setting it on a small table in the front hall, he turned and headed toward the parlour, where he knew his mother and Andromeda were ostensibly reading but were, in all likelihood, just as preoccupied as he was.
Sadiyah sighed, stopped walking, and looked at him. “Okay, fine. But you’re not allowed to hold this against me, alright?”
“Oh.” The wind went out of Draco’s sails abruptly. He’d psyched himself up, flying high on the delight of his family at his announcement, and now he felt a bit lost. He had no idea where to find Harry if he wasn’t here; he somehow didn’t think that he’d have gone home.
The next day, Harry and Sadiyah were treated to a day at the beach, one of Harry’s favorite ways to spend his free time. It was another gorgeous, sunny day, and they had a wonderful time splashing around in the chilly waves. Sadiyah’s grace on land, Harry discovered, apparently extended into the water as well, making her excellent at knocking Harry’s legs out from under him when he least expected it. By the time they headed for shore, his hair hung in lank strands around his face and he was completely exhausted.
Hilde danced with the same confidence with which she’d licked his hand; something about her body language clearly said ‘I know what I want, and I know that I can get it.’ Harry let himself be drawn in, let her undulate sensually around him, pulling him in her wake. Colored lights flashed above them, highlighting her hair in green and red and blue, and her skin was warm under his hands. Harry’s head was spinning; he thought hazily that maybe he shouldn’t have taken that shot after all.
“I’d like that,” Draco answered. As he followed Harry around the space, listening to him explain his processes and the uses of various tools and spells, Draco felt a warm sense of contentment settle over him. He was
“If they’re drunk, I’m sure they’ll like you just fine,” Andromeda said dismissively, turning her attention back to her book.
“I should be asking you that,” Harry responded, stretching languorously. “You’re my guest, technically.”
Draco grinned. “Just trust me. Now, get your hair wet.” He guided Harry under the spray, watching as the water soaked his curls, pulling them straighter until his hair hung almost to his shoulders in the back. “Okay, now come here.” Harry turned obediently so that his back was to Draco, and Draco popped the shampoo open, squeezing a generous dollop into his palm before beginning to carefully massage it into Harry’s hair and scalp.
“No!” Harry wasn’t sure when he’d stood up, but Sullivan was scrambling to his feet to meet him, his eyes pleading. “Of course not!”
Lucius continued as though neither of them had spoken. “I had given up hope on finding a suitable match for you, given past… miscalculations—”
Harry laughed. “The idea of you sneaking out of your mother’s house for a shag at our age is actually pretty hilarious.”
Harry shrugged slightly, smiling. “I can be pretty sneaky when I want to be. I did spend the majority of our school years getting into basically every corner of the castle and grounds that I wasn’t supposed to.”
“Come on.” He guided Harry to his room and helped him get undressed and into a pair of soft pajama bottoms.
fairly excessive for one person). Sliding glass doors opened onto a private deck overlooking the lake, and another door led to an en suite bathroom almost the size of the bedroom, complete with a huge jacuzzi bath and a shower with four different shower heads mounted on the ceiling and walls. It was the most relaxing space that Harry could imagine.
I lie down next to him. I don’t say anything. I know, by now, that he’ll tell me what’s on his mind if or when he wants to. He doesn’t wait long, this time.
“Weren’t you at that new spa last week?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow, reclaimed fork in hand. Harry tried to use his moment of distraction to steal it once more, but Draco tightened his fingers and jabbed the tines at him until he held his hands up in surrender.
Despite his plans, however, Draco could not keep his mind on gift-giving. It kept drifting back to Chris and the job offer she’d made him—the chance to not only advance in his career, but also to stay in the UK.
Harry found himself pleasantly surprised by the casual physicality of the moment, as well as by Perry’s cheerful, calm presence. “So you like kids, then?”
“Please don’t. I—” He scrubbed his hands over his eyes again. “Look, it’s not your fault, you were up front from the beginning; you didn’t even want to do this in the first place. And I should have known better, I know that I— but I didn’t expect to get invested this fast, honestly, and I just can’t—” his voice caught and he turned away, tilting his head up toward the ceiling. “Fuck. This is so embarrassing.”
Having eight hours to kill between dates was, Harry thought, possibly worse than heading from one right into the next. He contemplated taking a nap, just to kill a little time, but he and Leela had turned in so early the night before that he wasn’t remotely tired. After dithering around for a bit, he ended up taking what felt like an extremely long shower. Afterwards, when he looked at his clock only to see that he still had more than seven hours to go, he decided to work a bit more on his gigantic puzzle, which was still only about two-thirds done.
Draco wiped his hands on his apron and looked around. Now that the bread rolls were in the oven, all that was left to do was put the salad together, a task which Andromeda was already halfway through. “Would you like any help?” he asked.
Draco sighed theatrically, spinning his chair back toward his desk and replacing his quill in its holder. “Fine, suit yourself.” He tried his best to look indifferent, but it was difficult to hold back a smirk. He hadn’t expected an immediate capitulation, after all. But the idea was in Potter’s head, now. It was just a matter of time.
They had just parted ways with a disturbingly realistic mummy that had turned out to be Dean Thomas wrapped in artfully-done papier-mâché when Ron’s eyes went wide. “Oh, come
When the two eventually parted ways, Draco was surprised to see that they had passed more than an hour together—and that, once they’d been seated, it hadn’t been awkward at all. He was already on his way back to the house when he realized, with some chagrin, that he’d forgotten to go into a single store.
Draco smiled at him. “I’m fine, you dramatic sod. Just a little sore,” he reassured, the fondness in his tone belying any attempt at exasperation.
William gave Harry a disdainful look. “These shoes are new. I’m not going to roll around in the dirt and destroy them over a silly game.”
Harry smiled at the group, hoping that his nerves didn’t show through his cheerful facade. “Hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining me on this journey. I have to admit, it took a bit of convincing to get me here—” more laughter— “but I’m very excited to get to know you all and see if one of you might be the person to get me off the cover of
Sadiyah was in another skinny-strapped dress, but this one was red and ended less than halfway down her thighs, clinging to her lithe frame like a second skin. On first glance, Gabrielle’s long sleeved, sequined, black number looked more modest, but when she turned he could see that the low back of it dipped almost to the base of her spine. Leela wore tight black leggings and boots with a loose sort of shirt-dress that draped suggestively off one shoulder, and Hilde sported a cobalt blue halter top that laced up the middle of the front leaving a stretch of skin exposed with a pair of extremely short shorts.
an apology.” He almost admitted that he was afraid he might have let something truly embarrassing slip, but decided that some thoughts were better kept to oneself—especially ones that might lead to immensely awkward questions.
To his surprise, he found Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn chatting near the fireplace in the library, each with a glass of scotch in hand. “Draco, my boy!” Slughorn greeted him rather tipsily, and Draco gave an internal roll of his eyes as he put on a pleasant smile and went to join them. Apparently his status as
“Yeah.” She bit her lip. “I’m sorry. We know it’s not fair to you. So we wanted to talk to you before eliminations tonight. We think it’s probably time that we go home and let you concentrate on the people whose hearts are still in it.” She looked a bit like she was going to cry, and without thinking, Harry pulled her into a hug. She was so tiny, she barely reached his collarbones.
They opened their gifts from Teddy, oohing and ahhing appropriately, and then the ones they’d all gotten each other. In addition to the hideous dragon-printed tie from Teddy, Draco received a lovely stationery set from his mother and a hand knitted scarf from Andromeda, which he thanked them each graciously for. Once those were opened, he was left with a rectangular box about the size of a novel from Harry. Carefully sliding a finger under a flap of the paper to unwrap it, he found—
Blaise smiled back at him. “Well. It’s been a few months since I’ve seen you, but for our audience, it was only last week that you gallantly put your own feelings aside to help Harry follow his heart. Can you share with us a bit what that felt like?”
“Hi, Harry,” she greeted him, slipping her hand around his bicep and looking up at him through her lashes. She was sporting one of the tiniest bikinis Harry had ever seen, and he wondered briefly if it was held in place by magic, because he couldn’t fathom how else it stayed on. “We didn’t really get any time together earlier. Come take a walk with me?”
“Yeah. I mean,” he went on, equivocating, “I don’t want to promise anything. But I like you, and I want you to stay. Maybe we can just… I dunno, talk about what it would look like, if we were together?”
“I do not wish to spread tales. I should not have said anything, I apologize. The dates have been lovely, and the house is very nice.”
“What on earth would I be plotting?” Harry asked, both amused and dismayed at how his expression had apparently given him away.
Harry smirked before rolling his hips forward, grinding against Draco so that he could feel his hardness. “Not even close.”
“I dunno; I had it easier than some Muggleborns, I think. At least I had someone I knew and trusted to explain everything to me. I can’t imagine what it’s like for the kids who just have a stranger show up one day and tell them they’re going to wizard school in Scotland and they can’t see their parents until Christmas.”
“Ah yes, the ones that have already shed glitter over half the house.” Draco was more than happy to accept the change of subject, and the two returned to the living room.
When Harry arrived a couple hours later, he greeted Draco with a squeeze to the shoulder as he passed his desk. “Any food allergies or aversions I should know about?” he asked as he settled into his chair.
“They changed it,” Harry explained. He was oddly moved by the gesture. The fresh setting made it easier to separate the space from the rollercoaster of the past two evenings.
All of the lights in the club shut off abruptly, the music cutting off, leaving Harry’s ears ringing. He broke the kiss, turning around in confusion. “What…?”
Harry took a deep breath as he mounted his broom, listening to the announcer as she introduced the teams.
“I thought that might be it, given where we are right now.” Harry grinned again and shook his head. “Which is pretty funny in retrospect, since apparently neither of us would have minded.”
Hermione, who had been pointedly ignoring the pair after her defeat, looked up, her injured pride taking a backseat to her curiosity. “Really? That’s quite a tricky bit of magic.”
The next morning, it was raining, breaking their uncharacteristic streak of good weather. Determined not to wallow, and deprived of the exercise that would usually distract him from a mood like this, Harry managed to convince Pansy to let him go see a movie in the nearby Muggle town. She agreed, reluctantly, but insisted on sending Draco with him. “I don’t trust you not to try to disappear on me,” she told him with a scowl. Harry rolled his eyes at her but agreed; it wasn’t like he minded the company, after all.
Harry blinked at the irritated tone, realizing that Draco had probably been trying to get his attention for a while. Blushing, he attempted to excuse his momentary distraction, hoping his wandering thoughts weren’t visible in his expression. “Sorry, I’m just really tired. I was heading to take a nap when I saw you in here.”
Cormac glared up at him before swimming toward the side of the boat where Harry knew there was a ladder that could be pulled down. He snickered a bit, enjoying the moment now that he knew that Cormac hadn’t been hurt. “Thanks for that,” he murmured, hoping that his invisible savior could hear him.
“Good. The crew will be disillusioned once we’re inside to avoid distracting you and the contestants, but if you need anything, cross your fingers behind your back and someone will help you out.”
“Are you going to stop calling me old?” Harry asked, pausing, clearly holding his godson loosely enough that he could get away if he really wanted to.
The final contestant to arrive did not come from one of the limos; instead, they roared up the long drive on a motorcycle, parking it directly in front of Harry and pulling off their heavy black helmet, shaking loose a luxurious fall of thick, wavy black hair that reached their shoulders. They were sporting a well-fitted leather jacket, dark jeans, and black leather boots, and their low-cut white tee shirt revealed hints of stark black ink across their clavicles. They reminded Harry a bit of Sirius, although their eyes were dark instead of grey. They were also very,
“You don’t get a rest day today, though,” she added as she headed for the door. “We already booked this class and we wasted enough money on yesterday as it is.”
Teddy’s face split into a mischievous grin. “Bet you can’t keep up!” He was off like a shot, and Draco swore as he was quickly left behind. As he picked up speed to catch up with his cousin, he could hear Harry laughing behind him.
“Really.” Harry grinned down at him. “He was planning to bargain with Montague to get me, but I suspect after, erm, this—” he gestured broadly, indicating the room in its entirety, “he’ll be well pleased to be rid of me. I was already on thin ice, and my contract wasn’t binding past this season anyway. So, yeah.”
When the rest of their friends returned, Harry and Draco were chopping vegetables in preparation for dinner. The house was immediately filled with chatter and laughter as they wandered in, heading toward bathrooms and bedrooms to shower and change. The rest of the day passed pleasantly, with everyone coming together for food before splitting off for reading or talking or cards. Quite a few bottles of wine made the rounds, and Harry felt pleasantly buzzed when he finally headed to bed, knowing that he would be asleep within moments.
“I knew you looked familiar,” piped up Hilde from nearby. “Didn’t you open for the Manic Mandrakes last year?”
Harry eased Draco off his lap and onto his side before curling up behind him, his thighs pressed against Draco’s, one arm looped under his neck. His hard cock slipped between Draco’s cheeks and he gave a few slow thrusts, brushing over Draco’s sensitive hole and making him whimper, before using his other hand to line himself up.
The thing was, though, that Draco wasn’t used to rejection anymore. Sure, there had been a few rough years right after the war ended, but that was all ancient history now—at least when it came to finding potential bed partners. Draco knew he was hot; it was simply fact. With his ice blond hair and sharp cheekbones, his height and lithely muscular build, and his elegant, expensive wardrobe, everything about him screamed ‘you should be so lucky.’ It had been a long time since someone hadn’t jumped at the chance to be seen on his arm.
When one of the elves brought Harry breakfast the next morning, he noted that the tray was only set for one—so the staff, at least, were clearly aware of what had happened the night before.
Harry and Perry looked at each other, dripping wet and freezing, and, once again, burst into laughter, leaning against one another for support.
if you were with me. But the idea of living here at all was...” He shrugs again, bites his lip, and then looks back up.
Harry grinned. “It’s part of the fun! Anyway, when I went before I didn’t fall in. At least the water here is clean; I learned on the Thames. If I was brave enough to risk it there, it would be pretty embarrassing for you not to be up to trying here, don’t you think?”
“Right? No one in the house could figure out a damned thing. And believe me, we tried.” She grinned. “Things got a bit boring on the off days, with nothing to distract ourselves with. We had to make our own fun.”
Draco had been to Christmas markets before; New York had several, and he found them pleasant to wander through when he was feeling lonely around the holidays. He’d even taken a date once or twice. Attending with Harry and Teddy, however, was a new experience entirely. Teddy darted from stall to stall, pointing out everything from baubles to candy to gaudy jewelry that Draco desperately hoped he wouldn’t try to gift to anyone.
William didn’t look at all surprised to hear his name; if anything, he appeared to be slightly bored by the whole ordeal. He stepped up to Harry, and Harry held out his hand. “It’s been a pleasure, but I don’t think that you’d particularly enjoy my lifestyle,” he said apologetically.
Harry stared at him. “What on earth are you talking about? Perry’s been nothing but lovely since he got here.”
Draco sighed again, knowing that he owed his aunt at least some sort of explanation for his behavior. He sat up and waved his wand, undoing his locking charms. “Come in.”
“Well! It’s been a hell of a day. You must all be exhausted.” He beamed down at everyone. “But, sadly, we have one more thing to do before I can send you all off to slumberland. As you know, although all of you are here for a chance to win Harry Potter’s heart, only one of you will make it to the very end. Tonight, I’m sorry to tell you that two of you will be leaving our ranks. Harry?”
“Oh, I am Muggleborn, but my dad’s sister is a witch. He didn’t tell my mum until I started having weird ‘accidents’ like shrinking my leotard to doll size when I didn’t feel like going to dance class. Once he realized what was going on, he invited Auntie Amani over to explain everything to me and mum. After what was apparently a
Speaking of which, Harry couldn’t help but burst out laughing when he saw Perry’s paper. It was covered in oddly proportioned sketches that had been scribbled out, culminating in a stick man with a frowny face standing in one corner.
“I still have to go back to New York tomorrow,” he said, sniffing a bit as he wiped his face with the cuff of his coat. “I’ve got to sort out my flat, pack up, do some handover things for work. The paperwork to change jobs probably won’t even go through until the new year. But after that, yes. I’m coming back.” He kissed Harry again, lingering, sweet, a promise. “I’m coming home.”
“I can side-along you,” Harry assured him. “Guys,” he called out over the water, “Draco’s a bit seasick, so I’m going to take him back to the house.”
I haven’t attempted waterskiing since I was 13, when I went all of once and suuuuuper sucked at it. I did some research to try to frame it realistically, but if it’s completely incorrect, it’s because I have always been more of an indoor kid than anything. I tried!
“Sorry, what?” Harry shook his head. “Sorry, I’m sorry. My brain’s all over the place. You were talking about, um…” He trailed off helplessly.
She shrieked in surprise. “What the— HELP!” She ducked the first moth, but another promptly joined it, bouncing off of the side of her head as she straightened. “EW!”
“He does,” Harry said, just tipsy enough not to bother trying to lie about where he’d been looking. There was never any point in lying to Luna, anyway.
It was immensely satisfying to witness the effect he could have with just one short sentence. Harry’s eyes darkened almost immediately, and he licked his lips. “You know your mum and aunt are right downstairs, yeah?” His expression told Draco that he very much did not want to be reminding Draco of that fact, but he seemed unable to help himself.
Finally, Narcissa put down her quill and looked up at him. Her eyes were twinkling, and suddenly he was very sure that she and Andromeda had discussed what had happened yesterday morning. “You seem awfully interested in Harry’s love life, dear. Why don’t you ask him, if you’re so curious?”
Harry was taking a break from the water, wrapped in a towel and sipping at a fresh glass of wine, when Romilda appeared at his side.
Draco, who had just taken a sip of his drink, promptly choked. “For fuck’s sake,” he spluttered as Pansy thumped him on the back while Blaise snorted with laughter. “Have you no sense of propriety
Draco’s jitters from the night before immediately returned, bringing along some friends for good measure. He penned back a quick response accepting Harry’s invitation before beginning his morning routine, getting through it rather faster than usual and heading to the office much earlier than necessary to give his mind something to do.
“Hey, Harry!” came a call from the patio. Making his way out, he found Ron and Greg looking interestedly out toward the lake. “There’s another building down there; is that ours, too?” Ron asked.
The amount of fun I had writing this chapter was, frankly, obscene. George/Pansy might be my favorite completely bonkers pairing of all time.
Ron followed shortly thereafter, Hermione having rolled her eyes fondly before helping him squash his unevenly roasted marshmallow between the biscuits and chocolate. “Bloody hell,” he managed to mumble around a mouthful. “That’s amazing.”
“How disappointing. If only you weren’t an Arrow,” Malfoy sighed dramatically. “I’d like to see what a Harry Potter seduction looked like. Have you gotten any smoother since school?”
Greg looked doubtfully at Ginny, ignoring Harry and Draco. “That thing didn’t look very big; I wouldn’t think it could fit more than two people.”
“About that.” Ron was smiling in a decidedly pleased-with-himself sort of way. “You should give Oliver Wood a call. Get a drink with him. We’ve been chatting, and he has an idea that I think you’ll like.” Pushing his chair back, he grabbed his plate and moved it to the sink. “Right. I have to head to work. Here’s Oliver’s floo address; you can’t show up at the game today, anyway, so you need a distraction. See you later, okay?”
Harry laughed as they entered the shop. “Never thought I’d hear that from you.” His gaze traveled up and down Draco’s body thoughtfully, and Draco did his best not to squirm. “Can’t say it doesn’t suit you, though.” His eyes widened as he realized what he’d said and he gave an awkward cough. “I mean. Right. Anyway. What would you like?”
“I could be persuaded to go for a soak,” Blaise commented from one of the sofas, where he was stretched out, empty plate on the floor next to him. “It’s been ages.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, feeling himself blush a little. It was rare that Draco was this genuine; usually any thanks he gave were couched in insults to hide any hint of vulnerability. “Ready to get up?”
Fucking hell, this was not good. “What?” he said again, trying to buy time by feigning ignorance. “What are you even talking about? I don’t—”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I don’t know that I think much of whatever her screening process was, at this point. So far, I’ve had to cut a woman who once tried to assault me, a man so posh he made
Fire, Draco decided over the following week as he and Harry barely left each other’s company outside of their office, came in a great many forms. Sometimes it was the licking, teasing flame of new and interesting places where chocolate could end up on a person’s body. Sometimes it was the red hot blaze of pinning your new boyfriend face down against his own mattress and fucking him torturously slowly until he begged for release. Sometimes it was the warm glow of going flying with your young cousin that you hardly knew, staying close to the ground and watching his godfather pretend to be distracted so that he could catch the practice snitch they’d been chasing, or the bright spark of watching someone else’s excitement as they introduced you to something Muggle that you were unexpectedly delighted by.
“I’ll think about it,” Harry told her, positive that he would not, and kissed the top of her head before going to change back into his clothes. “It was great to see you, Luna.”
“Well then.” Draco grinned and leaned back down, murmuring into Harry’s mouth as his hand returned to its former position. “Let’s just do this and go from there, shall we?”
Pansy rolled her eyes, but pulled Ginny close and kissed the side of her head affectionately. “Fine. But if I can’t fit into my clothes because of vacation weight after this, I’m blaming you.”
“You should consider visiting at some point, anyway,” Leela told him. “Not to track down your fifth cousins seven times removed or whatever, but just to see a bit of it. It’s interesting to see where your family came from—or at least it was for me.”
“You could, but then you’d be on your own the next time you needed to corral them,” Sadiyah told him, raising a challenging eyebrow.
Harry startled slightly, looking quickly over at Draco. “Oh! Hi.” Then, processing his words, he glanced up. “Ah. Who was responsible for that, do you think?”
“Right. No problem.” Harry cleared his throat. Ginny snorted. Awkwardly, Draco stepped out of the tub, grabbing a fluffy towel from a stack that had been left nearby and heading inside. Once the door had closed behind him, Harry took a deep breath, gathering himself. “I should probably head in, too,” he said. “Pretty sure you’re not supposed to fall asleep in these things.”
“Not exactly.” Sadiyah looked at him for a long moment and then sighed. “It’s just that… Harry, you’ve already made up your mind. I’m not completely oblivious, you know. I’m not sure why you’re going through the motions at this point. Why not just tell him?”
Eventually, Teddy and his friend tired themselves out, and Harry convinced Teddy that it was time to go home. He whinged a bit at first, claiming that he was fine, but by the time Draco had returned their rental skates and come back to the bench where he’d left them, he was slumped against Harry’s side, fast asleep.
Pansy held up a hand. “We’re not judging you. Sexual compatibility is an important part of a relationship.”
Draco waved him off. “It’s no bother. I hadn’t made any particular plans for the day. Pansy had to go meet with some of the network executives, and one of us needed to be around in case anything went wrong.”
“You’re going to be even more distracted by each other than usual,” Ron had pointed out, and their protestations had been in vain.
Several other contestants followed who were also vaguely familiar—Nathalie, a redheaded Ravenclaw who reminded Harry a bit of Ginny and a short but muscular man named Peregrine Derrick (“call me Perry”) that Harry remembered playing Beater on the Slytherin team before Crabbe and Goyle took over, as well as two Hufflepuffs named Rose and Owen who were three and four years behind him, respectively. Owen had a round, friendly face and soft grey eyes that gave Harry an unexpected urge to hug him, while Rose—who was sporting a pink pixie cut and radiated a mischievous charm—reminded Harry, with a bittersweet pang, of Tonks. Another woman, Harry initially mistook for one of the Patil twins; his confusion must have shown on his face as she approached, because she laughed and introduced herself as their younger cousin, Leela.
Despite his assurances to Hermione at the time, Harry’s last-minute babysitting gig had indeed been a problem, in that it had lost him a full day of pre-Christmas working time. He was behind on several orders that he’d promised he’d have done in time for Christmas, he’d admitted to Draco on a brief Floo call the night before. He was going to have to spend the entire day (and most likely a not-insignificant part of the night) in his workshop, eliminating any chance they’d had to go on a final date before Draco left. They were due to spend tomorrow evening making Christmas biscuits with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Teddy, and then the next day would be dedicated to party preparations. Then came the party, and then Christmas, and then… then, Draco would be gone.
And here we go! If you’ve watched much of the Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise, you might notice that there are several deviations from their formula. This is because 1) the idea of coming up with more than 14 contestants was overwhelming, 2) some things would have gotten extremely repetitive, and 3) I just don’t have that kind of attention span. This has been your warning!
They shed their layers quickly and inelegantly, and soon Draco found himself with his chest and forearms pressed against the wall and Harry’s fingers, slick with conjured lube, pushing inside of him.
heard such a thing, I’d have to say you’re one to talk. Not doing too badly for yourself, are you? Now that you’re not competing against me, I mean.” He grinned mischievously, and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
He was just putting the finishing touches on Pansy’s sleek black bob when Harry looked over at him and laughed. “You’ve got a bit of blue, uh—” He gestured at Draco’s hair, and Draco’s hand flew up instinctively, making Harry snort. “Yeah, that definitely made it worse.”
Harry looked equally confused. “My cousin?” When Draco continued to look at him in bewilderment, realization crossed Harry’s face, and he laughed unhappily. “Shit, you don’t know any of this, do you? I just sort of assume people know my entire life story because of how fucking nosy the papers are.” He cringed. “I must sound so self-involved right now.” He began fidgeting restlessly with a napkin, his cheerful, open mood gone, and Draco impulsively reached out and put a hand over his, desperately wanting it back.
“Right. Of course.” Harry paused. “So now what?” He felt oddly calm about the whole thing, now that he was past the initial shock.
Leaning over, he pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple before sitting up completely with a groan. “I should shower.”
Harry stayed where he was, kissing Draco again as he stretched him open, twisting his fingers to press against his prostate and make him moan into the kiss, arching his back. “Fuck. I’m ready.”
On Wednesday, in order to dodge another lecture from his mother on his love life and locale (“I’m only saying, Draco, Kashburn and Costleigh have a London office as well. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t—”), Draco made the possibly-slightly-dramatic decision to flee the house.
“I mean, you aren’t getting paid for the rest of the season, I presume, so you may as well capitalize on the incident.”
“Make us a drink while you’re up there, will you, darling?” Pansy directed from under a wide-brimmed sun hat and a pair of dark sunglasses.
“No offense, but I don’t trust a single person in this room to point a wand at my head. I’ll be back in a moment.” From behind him, he could hear Andromeda laugh and his mother let out an offended huff. Ignoring them, he wiped his hands on the front of his borrowed apron, removed it, and headed up to the loo.
“I mean, I do have a chess set around here somewhere, if you’d prefer,” Harry countered, calling his bluff.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment in abject mortification before taking a deep breath and reaching for the tie around his waist. He’d fought a dragon, he reminded himself. Surely he could handle being naked for a couple of hours.
“I mean, a bit, at first.” Harry looked down at his hands, picking at a fingernail. “But… I don’t know. It’s sort of… nice, I guess? I haven’t historically been
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” Draco said loftily, trying to lift the mood. “I, personally, made
“Clicked,” Rose finished, giving Owen a small smile. “And then, you know, being in the house together, we’ve had time to catch up and it just… feels right? I don’t know. But we’ve talked and we…”
Harry laughed. “I have no idea. Draco’s been in charge of most of the staging sort of stuff, but I can
“I see that,” Draco mumbled, still trying to get his bearings. Why on earth was Harry Potter standing in his bedroom doorway? “Hello, Edward.” Draco’s head dropped back onto his pillow in resignation as he decided that attempting to understand his current situation was a lost cause. “What time is it?”
Luna’s plan worked perfectly. Over the course of the next two months, Harry and Draco spent their days practicing with their respective teams and split their evenings between their loved ones and each other, carefully balancing their time so that there was never any cause for raised eyebrows. They took advantage of the last long days of summer, wandering the moors and woods near Luna’s cottage, talking about everything and nothing. They brought picnics out with them and basked in the golden afternoon sun, or stayed out late, alternating between stargazing and snogging.
Harry thought idly as his heart, stomach, and everything else inside of him floated right up to the ceiling. Embarrassingly, he could feel his eyes welling up again, even as he felt his face stretch into what felt like an impossibly wide smile. Hands moving again to the back of Draco’s neck, he tugged him forward and kissed him once more, deeper and wilder, instinctually, wanting to pull the words right from Draco’s mouth and into himself and keep them there.
We do talk about other things, sometimes, now. Lyrics will trigger memories, and one or the other of us will share a tiny bit of ourselves, slowly putting together an enormous jigsaw puzzle made up of the moments that made us who we are.
than I expected so far, being back here. Spending time with my family; even spending time with all our schoolmates the other night. And you’re a part of that—a rather integral part, if I’m being honest—and I don’t want to mess that up. I’m not going to be here for much longer, so anything we started wouldn’t last. It
“Alright,” Hermione said determinedly, getting up and stepping out of her shorts, leaving herself in a sensible one-piece swimsuit. “I have to swim at least once while I’m here.”
“Fair point.” Harry grinned. He seemed extremely happy to let the subject drop, so Draco followed his lead and they moved on to less fraught topics.
“I’m going to bed,” Draco sniffed. He stood abruptly, in what was probably intended to be a dignified manner. The effect was ruined by his immediately wobbling rather worryingly.
‘How it went’ was extremely well, in Draco’s opinion. It seemed that once Harry Potter made a decision, he fully committed. Draco supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised. The man’s single-mindedness was one of the things that had driven his most impressive feats—first as the Savior, and then as one of the most successful investigative reporters the
After a few tense moments, Blaise stood up and made his way cautiously over. “Would you like to introduce us?” he asked Luna. Harry couldn’t help but admire his bravery and trust in his friend’s judgment, no matter how questionable it seemed. Luna had never steered any of them wrong, but Harry still wasn’t keen to try his luck befriending a two hundred pound predator.
Taking a final pull from the cigarette, he stubbed it out and eased himself from the bed, retreating to the en suite, where a hot, soothingly-scented bath was already waiting for him. Clossy was old hat at Draco’s post-sex routines, as well as the variations thereon when ‘post-sex’ was also ‘post-breakup’: the water was perfect, there was a glass of red wine waiting, and he knew that the sheets would have been changed and the room straightened before he emerged. It would be as though Max had never been there.
“She Flooed back to the city late last night,” Draco told him. “She’ll probably be there doing damage control most of the day.” He wrinkled his nose in distaste. “I’d rather be on babysitting duty, frankly. I can’t imagine how she’s going to explain Nathalie making it through her screening process.”
“You’re Mister Harry’s friend?” a little girl with her hair pulled into two curly puff balls on either side of her head asked, looking skeptical. “How come we haven’t met you, then?”
He laughed, momentary melancholy driven away by that final desperate rush and the subsequent burst of endorphins, and buried his face in Harry’s neck for a moment before lifting himself off and rolling onto his side, settling his cheek against Harry’s chest. One of Harry’s hands rose to stroke his hair absently. Draco turned slightly to press a kiss to his clavicle before stretching and grimacing at the feeling of liquid seeping from him. “Shower?” he asked hopefully.
we knew,” Ron said, as if that made perfect sense. “And, I mean, you could have found someone a bit less… complicated. It was worth a shot.” He shrugged, and Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry nodded. “His school’s mostly Muggle but there are a couple other magical kids there. Jane’s dad runs Scrivenshaft’s.”
The rest of the group, at least, seemed to be enjoying themselves. As he’d suspected, Cormac, Romilda, Perry, and Sullivan were all in top form, with Cormac blocking every shot that the red team got near the goal hoops, Perry hitting Bludgers at people with brutal efficiency, and Romilda and Sullivan trading passes like they’d been playing together for years. Several other players took him by surprise, however: Sadiyah was lightning fast as she dashed across the field, Quaffle in hand; Leela, despite her petite stature, was sending Bludgers soaring with deadly accuracy, and Nathalie was reminding Harry of Ginny more and more by the second as her red ponytail flew out behind her as she stayed determinedly at the heart of the action.
As they’d talked, Harry had led Draco down a side street, and they now stood in front of a small shop with a simple wood-burned sign reading “The Bean and Leaf” that resembled many of the small, independent Muggle coffee shops scattered around Manhattan. When Draco said as much, Harry grinned. “There’s a lot of cultural integration happening these days,” he said. “Muggle-style things are all the rage.”
The biggest surprise, however, came from Dermot. He and Blaise started out by talking about a new album he would be dropping soon, with Dermot in full media-charm mode, but when Blaise asked how he felt about his time on the show, he turned serious.
fucking hot. Harry took him roughly, fucking into him mercilessly while his nails dug into his hips, and it was such a contrast from the mellow, friendly Harry that people saw most of the time that it made Draco’s head spin. He groaned as he felt Harry empty himself inside of him and quickly pull out and had only a moment to bemoan the loss before Harry spun him around and sunk to his knees.
“Yes, I’ve been working with them for... seven years, now? I was lucky enough to be recruited while they were on quite a hiring streak, and I turned out to have a knack for it, so here I am.”
“Hmm?” Harry glanced down at himself and groaned as he realized he’d just answered the door in nothing but his boxers. “Sorry. Gimme a sec.” He left the door open behind himself as he went to grab a dressing gown from the wardrobe. “Sorry,” he said again, turning back to Malfoy, who had followed him in.
“A bit,” Luna answered as though this was a completely unremarkable fact. “It’s not very strong, but we can understand each other.”
been seeking Draco’s company out more and more, he knew. Had been turning to him for comfort, depending on him—but also just enjoying spending time together. Their banter, their easy silences. That warm, tingly feeling Sadiyah had described that he’d completely failed to recognize because he was, apparently, an idiot. But that didn’t necessarily mean he was in
The bank they’d chosen to end their race hadn’t seemed unreasonably far when they’d started, but as they rowed on, Harry began to feel like he might have overestimated the stamina of two people who weren’t used to this sort of exercise. The shore didn’t appear to be getting any closer, but Harry’s arms were tiring, and each pull against the water felt increasingly difficult. He felt himself slowing as the muscles of his back and shoulders started to burn and his hands began to cramp.
The course wasn’t terribly crowded, so they’d had their pick of sleds. They had started on a series of concave disks about a meter in diameter, careening down one of the easier hills. Harry had opted for non-magical sleds, saying that he’d never gotten to go sledding as a child and wanted to try it the “old fashioned way” first. Draco had immediately loved the feeling of it—like flying, the cold air stinging his cheeks and nose, but wilder, less controllable. His jubilant laughter had whipped away with the wind, joining Harry’s whoops and Teddy’s shrieking joy.
Most Eligible Bachelor for the tenth year running. In the early days, it had mostly just been funny. Harry’d had no interest in settling down, then, content just to be allowed to live his life after so many years of having to fulfill the expectations of others. He’d found it baffling that, despite being neither employed nor what he would consider anything like conventionally attractive—with his thick glasses, many scars, untameable hair, and still-gangly build—so many witches apparently found him desirable. His friends had found how confused he was about the whole thing hilarious and had teased him endlessly.
“Perfectly,” Draco answered, offering nothing more as he freed a tangled garland from a box of decorations.
Draco smiled a little and answered, “I can push around basically everyone in the Auror-Department. Well… almost.”
“Draco, you are a disappointment,” Lucius said. “You betrayed me, your mother and, worst of all, the Dark Lord. But you even betrayed yourself.”
Draco appeared in front of Teddy’s school. No one was here any more. He hurried inside and to Teddy’s classroom. There sat the boy at his table and wrote in a workbook of his. Draco sighed relieved. On a chair next to him sat a young woman. She was around Draco’s age, but most likely younger.
So Harry decided to change the subject and maybe cheer Draco up, “Hermione invited us to a family brunch on Sunday. You wanna go? I heard she had some big news.”
She put down her papers and sat down across Draco, “A lot of stuff. In this folder is everything the watchers have found about the maniac. This is about the tests of the
Teddy and Harry were amazed seeing the new tattoo. And they both laughed when Draco told them about the misunderstanding about Teddy’s parents.
Hermione was surprised and put her cup down as well, “I understand. Why do you want to do it now? You could wait for Harry to come back.”
“Yes,” she answered, “it is nice, isn’t it? I bought it at an adorable little shop in Diagon Alley just last week. The shop just opened. But the two of you, tell me about yourself. What happened lately?”
The tattoo artist noticed Teddy and chuckled. The boy looked exactly like Harry, except for his golden eyes.
Having just bitten into his bun with jam Harry was caught off guard and it took him a moment to actually answer, “Well… erm… I… like both.”
“Erm…” made Teddy and reminisced. “I think she does. I came here when the others watched the Quidditch office. I was bored. I was there so often already, so I came to see you instead.”
Draco confused looked over to the young woman. She was a tad smaller than him, her short hair tied back to a ponytail similar to the way he had it. Her ripped jeans, the expensive white sneakers and the washed out tank top she wore under her bomber-jacket made her perfectly blend in with the young muggles on the streets of New York, but she didn’t really look like an authority figure.
The evening went on like that—easy, natural, their conversation witty and biting and immensely satisfying. By their second glass of wine, Draco had all but forgotten that he’d initially been pursuing Harry mostly to assuage his own injured ego. Their banter felt electric, and the air between them fairly sizzled. As the drinks flowed, Draco found himself getting more and more physical, unable to keep himself from laying a hand on Harry’s arm or shoulder or leaning a bit closer than necessary to murmur a snarky observation into his ear. Harry did not seem to mind one bit, if his own hand lingering on Draco’s knee was anything to go by.
Jane removed three muffins from their tin and placed them on a cutting board, where Kevin cut them into quarters. They crumbled a bit as the knife went through, making the pair look nervous.
“I wish I could disagree. And I’ve had Polyjuice Potion a few times, so that’s really saying something.”
“What about me?” Harry turned to look at Luna, who was rolling her beer bottle against her lower lip consideringly.
“Right, well, I’ll make sure to keep someone near them just in case they get up to anything nefarious.” He stood as though to leave, but instead of heading toward the door, he rested a hand on the back of his chair and gave Harry a calculating look. “Can I ask one last question?”
Narcissa sighed and looked at him in the same way she had when he’d threatened tantrums as a child. “Don’t be difficult, darling. You’re nearly thirty, and you’ve yet to indicate a serious interest in anyone; it’s not unreasonable for us to pursue a suitable match for you.”
“Definitely not, you must be hearing things.” Malfoy took a calm sip from the tumbler he was holding, and Harry snorted.
“Love you,” Teddy echoed, snuggling down in under his covers, and Harry backed out through the door, closing it softly behind him.
It was near closing when they finally decided to call it a night. Despite having had quite a few rounds, Draco didn’t feel drunk, just pleasantly buzzed. When they exited the bar, Harry took his hand once more—not even pausing their conversation—like it was the most natural thing in the world, walking Draco toward the nearest Apparition point. It felt oddly intimate. Draco’s previous partners hadn’t generally been hand-holding types. He thought he might like it. As they approached their destination, Harry tugged lightly at their entwined fingers, pulling Draco to a stop.
“What sorts of things would be deal breakers at this point, do you think, when it comes to beliefs and values?”
“I don’t mind the heat,” they said. It was an innocuous answer, but they way they said it did funny things to Harry’s stomach.
When the first car finally pulled up in front of them, the door opened of its own accord and an extremely handsome man with pale brown skin, hazel eyes, and a profusion of gold-streaked brown curls climbed out, slinging a guitar over his back before walking up to Harry and Blaise.
“Well, I’ve been back for years, haven’t I? I had to learn eventually. Especially since a lot of the staff at the restaurant I work at play on an intramural team. I would have been well out of their social circle if I hadn’t at least tried. I’m perfectly comfortable flying these days.”
He spent a leisurely morning lounging on the balcony’s comfy chaise, sipping espresso and munching on pastries while rereading his favorite novel, an odd but hilarious story about an angel and a demon trying to prevent the apocalypse. He’d found out the night before that the contestants were not allowed to bring any sort of entertainment with them, but the same rule thankfully did not apply to Harry. If he’d had nothing to do but obsess over his many suitors, he thought he might lose his mind.
Harry shook his head and gave a huff of amused exasperation. He couldn’t help but smile, however, as he landed a final blow. “You’re sharing a room with Greg,” he said, pushing off the counter where he’d been leaning.
Draco sighed and flopped backwards onto his bed. Maybe, by Tuesday, Potter would forget their almost-kiss?
With a pat on the shoulder, she left him alone in the dim room. He took a deep breath; his heart was pounding like he’d been running. Feeling decidedly more sober than he had a few minutes ago, Harry decided to skip the beer run and head up to his room. He needed to think.
“Good evening!” Blaise greeted when everyone was once again gathered at the bottom of the staircase. “On behalf of the crew, I want to apologize for the little snag we hit this morning. Since we were unable to repair the room in time to let you complete the challenge and earn your reward, we’ve decided that you should have it anyway. If you’ll all join me in the back garden, therefore, we have a bit of a show for you.”
“Sounds delightful. Well, I’ll be happy to jailbreak you for a few hours. A group of us do a regular drinks night, and we were already planning to go to the Three Broomsticks this month for nostalgia’s sake, so you won’t even have to Apparate after.”
“Harder,” he begged, unable to bear the ecstatic intimacy any longer. Harry made a desperate sort of sound and obeyed, straightening and anchoring himself by gripping Draco’s thighs before taking up a fast, pounding rhythm that had heat building deep inside him as Harry hammered at his prostate with every thrust. It rose like wildfire, and finally, in a burst of overwhelming pleasure, consumed him.
“And even if there were, perhaps, some… mutual interest… it wouldn’t mean anything. It would just be... a nice thing to have. For a little while.”
came an irritated voice from behind them. Draco gave Harry a look that very clearly said ‘so there’, and Harry stifled a laugh and went back to watching the film. Despite his petulant grumbling, when Harry had to wipe yet more tears from his face moments later, Draco took his other hand from where it sat on the armrest separating them and squeezed it comfortingly. It felt oddly natural, so Harry squeezed back, not letting go until the plot moved on and introduced an over-enthusiastic dog that liked to talk about squirrels.
“I quite like it,” Draco replied, sipping from a glass of rosé, his other arm resting along the side of the boat and his legs stretched long in front of him, crossed at the ankle. He was wearing a pair of pristine coral twill shorts and a white polo shirt, and Harry couldn’t decide if he was amused by the Connecticut country club look or distressed at how well he pulled it off. He settled on taking a long swig of his beer and trying not to stare.
Sometimes, it was the joyous bonfire rush of showing up at a garden party gala celebration and watching as someone braved the flashing cameras and nosy questions of the press for you with a weird sort of fluttering sensation in your chest, and then taking him back to your place and expressing your thanks on your knees while his hands clenched in your hair and he swore like a sailor in a storm.
Hesitantly, she added, “I don’t really think your heart is in it, either, is it? At least not tonight.”
The pair parted and Pansy raised an eyebrow at him. “I’m surprised you noticed. Your attention seemed… otherwise occupied.” She smirked, and Harry thought Draco went a bit red—although that could have been from the hot water.
“It’s fine for now, Teddy’s up in his room and I’m unfortunately quite sure that my mother and aunt know there’s something going on, even if they aren’t sure of the details.”
The next morning dawned bright and clear, which Harry decided to take as a good omen for the day ahead. Now that he’d had a night to adjust, he was coming to appreciate the luxury of his temporary home: the bed was huge and pillow-soft; the loo included a giant soaking tub that he was very much looking forward to using; and wide, plate glass windows looked out over the rolling green grounds, as did a wide, elegant balcony, which was outfitted with a suite of lounge furniture much more comfortable than the chairs inside had been before Draco had gotten to them.
Draco’s mouth opened and closed several times without making any sound. After a panicked moment, he gulped and managed to croak out a desperate “Please, you can’t tell anyone.”
The heated looks Harry kept shooting at Draco for the (short) remainder of their meal meant that by the time they’d gotten outside, Draco was about ready to pull him into an alleyway and just strip him down right there. Harry, thankfully, had a better idea. “Come back to mine?” he asked, reeling Draco in by the waist and kissing him, voice hopeful and promising at once.
“Not really. But I’m sure I’ll have someone by then. It’s not hard to find takers.” He gestured up and down his body and raised an eyebrow in an unspoken
Harry laughed, and Draco moved his hands to the lapels of Harry’s blazer, stroking the fabric gently. “Do I get a goodnight kiss, then?” he asked coyly.
“I said that it wasn’t that bad,” came Luna’s dreamy voice, and Harry’s head shot up, finally registering that they weren’t alone. He looked around, wide-eyed, at the gaping bystanders and flushed an extremely endearing shade of pink.
When they parted again, Harry let out a breath, toying with the loose strands of silky hair at the nape of Draco’s neck that had escaped from his bun. “This is going to be all over the press tomorrow. There’s no way I’ll be able to go to your game without getting mobbed.”
Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes at this. “Yeah, we’ve known each other for almost twenty years now. We were at school together.
“I’ll miss you,” Harry insisted with a pout, his eyes still closed, but he loosened his grip and allowed Draco to slip free.
Harry realized with a start that he had no idea what Perry did for a living; they’d only talked Quidditch. He said as much, and Perry smiled.
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” Once he had his breakfast in hand, Draco joined them at the table, glancing in interest at the papers in front of them. “What are you two up to, then?”
Draco made an incoherent sound in response, dropping his hands from his legs and linking them over Harry’s shoulders to keep them in place so that he could wrap his arms around Harry’s neck. He clung to Harry as he began to slowly thrust. They rolled against each other, panting, gazes locked. Draco’s mind was blank of anything but pleasure and heat and Harry. He wanted more. He wanted everything.
He had no idea how much later it was when he was startled awake by the sound of his door opening. “What?” he said groggily, trying valiantly to focus his eyes despite his lack of glasses and the almost-complete darkness of the room.
Looking down at Draco’s now-bare chest, Harry ran his hands slowly, reverently, over pale, perfect skin. Despite his sun charms, Draco’s shoulders were sprinkled with a barely-visible smattering of freckles. The thinnest of scars from a long-ago encounter in a flooded bathroom crisscrossed his chest. He wasn’t by any means muscular, but there was a slight definition to him that Harry found irresistible. He’d seen Draco shirtless before, many times, and he’d touched him, too—but never like this, with permission and intent.
close to Harry’s face—and, suddenly, Harry was feeling rather dizzy himself. He pulled his hands back, embarrassed.  “Sorry.”
“Oh god,” Harry squeaked and, using his Seeker’s agility for the first time that day, ducked quickly out from under her arm and around, backing away from the hedges. “Um, that’s… pretty intense? We haven’t actually spoken in, like, a decade.”
. It’s bad enough when we aren’t all in close quarters, but this week has been truly unbearable. Make. A fucking.
that was inexplicably told by a combination of puppets and humans. Draco expected it to be awful but found himself immediately engrossed, and by the time the spirit of Christmas past departed, he was blinking back tears. He tried to wipe his eyes surreptitiously, but Harry noticed and looked up at him.
She patted him on the shoulder. “Nothing for you to worry about, Potter. We’ll see you in the morning.”
“If you make fun of me I will murder you in your sleep,” Draco told him, voice less level that he would have liked.
Draco’s body was firm beneath his, his hands urging Harry closer, deeper, and Harry could feel himself starting to harden. He wanted to be nearer; he wanted to erase all of the boundaries between them; he
Once the idea of them watching “Love, Actually” came to me, I couldn’t resist. I have such a love/hate relationship with that movie. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this little scene of domestic fluffiness!
“You never beat me at anything and you often have something I want,” Draco said dismissively as he ducked past Harry, closing the bathroom door before Harry could point out that he did, in fact, beat Draco at many things, quite regularly.
Trying to distract himself, he commented blithely to his mother, “There are rather a lot of Weasleys on this list, aren’t there?”
Draco had to fight hard not to grin triumphantly when Potter finally snapped. It was barely past lunchtime when the man spun his chair around to address Draco. Draco feigned interest in his work, studiously not acknowledging the sudden movement.
Ron, as Deputy Head of his department, had dragged a reluctantly-tuxedoed Harry around for the first hour or so, introducing him to the who’s who of the British Quidditch world before finally letting him loose. “But you’d better not disappear completely,” he had warned, pointing at Harry with a knowing look, before diving into conversation with someone-or-other whose name Harry hadn’t bothered to make note of. Harry had given him a sarcastic little salute before grabbing a drink off a passing tray and making his way to his current spot, which he figured was about as out of the way as Ron would let him get without arguing with him about it.
“Oh, erm, about that. I have, ah… a new assignment! That I’ll have to go… research for… so, yeah, I won’t be able to make it. Sorry.” Potter sounded intensely awkward, and Draco had to bite back a smirk. The man was an awful liar.
“That’s what Pansy said, too,” he said, trying to keep his voice steady. “Actually, she said we both were.”
They stand in the center of a large, rectangular space dotted with piles of ash. The scorched remains of brick foundations surround them. On either side, townhouses rise, solid and confident and completely unaware that there had once been another house between them, but that—as of about twelve seconds ago—it has ceased to be.
Harry made a sound somewhere between a groan and a laugh. “No. I planned for a lot of things on this trip, but definitely not this.”
He could feel Harry grin. “Interesting. We’ll come back to that.” He kept moving, easing back on his knees, mouth and hands traveling down Draco’s stomach, causing him to inhale sharply. “Ticklish?” Harry asked, sounding delighted.
Now that it was safe to look, Harry glanced over at him, his brow wrinkling in confusion. “But you put your bag into our boot when we were arranging everything; I saw you.”
“I seem to remember you saying something about that, yeah,” Harry grinned, letting his hand travel downward again, this time skimming lower, along the outer curve of his thigh and then inward and upward, grazing along the crease of Draco’s groin and over his currently-flaccid and probably oversensitive cock, startling a gasp and a half-hearted glare out of him. “What did you have in mind?”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Is that really what you’re calling them? It sounds like a room that rents by the hour.”
Can you have a meet-cute when you’ve known each other for 15 years and literally hung out two days ago? Asking for a friend.
They ended up flying for three hours, exploring the grounds, racing from one randomly chosen landmark to another, trying to show one another up with increasingly ridiculous stunts. By the time Malfoy had finally called it, insisting that he should have been back ages ago, Harry’s mood had improved greatly. They were both sweaty and winded by then; Draco’s usually-sleek hair was a windswept mess, with curls sticking damply to his forehead, and his skin was flushed with exertion. Harry decided he liked it. Seeing Malfoy as anything other than pristine was a rare treat.
Y’all, writing this fic has been a fucking ride, start to finish. Thank you SO MUCH to all of you that read along; your comments kept me going as my buffer of completed chapters got shorter and shorter and I started to wonder if I would finish on time. I hope that the ending is as disgustingly cheesy as you hoped! Personally, my teeth almost fell out writing so much pure sugary sweetness (especially that last line), but I committed to full Hallmark from the outset, and I just couldn’t end it any other way. I wish all of you who celebrate, religiously or secularly, the merriest of Christmasses—and if you, like me, can’t be physically home this year and are hurting, I hope that this absurdly fluffy nonsense could bring you a little bit of joy. Cheers to 2021 and a fresh start! 🥂
He’d spent quite a bit of time during his holiday trying not to think about the things he was going to miss when he went back to New York. His family and the cozy home they’d made together, so different from the Manor with its strict rules and cold elegance. Pansy, Blaise, and Greg, whom he’d slid back into an easy friendship with since his return, seeing them when he could between family obligations, work, and dates with Harry. And, of course, Harry himself.
Next to him, Draco lets out a wheezing sort of cough. It shakes Harry out of his stupor just enough to realize that he should probably say something, at this point. They did, after all, just destroy his house…their house? Draco hadn’t technically moved in yet, which is probably for the best, as he would likely be less stunned and more hysterical had all of his worldly possessions been inside when it had burned down.
It’s weird to think back, now, to those first weeks, when I had to think about my answer when he asked if I even liked him. My response is still slow, now, but it’s not because I don’t
“No! Well, yes. Maybe?” Draco rubbed his hands over his face. “It wouldn’t be a good idea, that’s all.”
Sure enough, as the bridge came into view, Harry could see Malfoy’s white blond hair catching in the sunlight. He was leaning against the bridge’s side, looking down at the water below him. He must have felt Harry approaching, but he didn’t move, even when he stopped next to him. Harry didn’t bother to mince words, not even greeting him before asking, “Did you set off the sprinklers yesterday?”
He had just finished his second beer and was thinking of ordering a third when his eyes caught on an unexpected face across the crowd: a very pissed off looking Pansy Parkinson gesturing in a way that very clearly meant
Harry flipped him off over his shoulder but smiled. Once the door clicked shut, he stripped and fell into bed without bothering to put on pajamas or follow any of his usual evening rituals. He was asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Hilde looked down at Harry in disbelief. “You don’t need to coddle her, Harry, honestly. I was only—” But what she was ‘only’, Harry didn’t find out, because at that moment, Hilde stepped square on a scattered pile of Legos that he could swear hadn’t been there a second ago. Her eyes went wide as she yelped in pain. “MotherFU—”
Harry was feeling restless the next morning, itching to do something that wasn’t just killing time until another pre-arranged, carefully staged date. He didn’t feel like swimming after a full day at a beach, flying didn’t sound appealing, and he’d read everything he had brought with him. Eventually, he called one of the elves and asked if they could bring him anything at all to do, which is how he ended up sitting on the floor in the middle of a 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzle when Pansy and Draco came to brief him for the next day’s date.
“He’ll be okay,” he said. “He just…” He trailed off, as though trying to find the words. “He doesn’t have that much family,” he finally said. “And he really likes you. So he got attached quickly. But... he’ll adjust. He’ll be fine.” He paused, and then repeated it, quietly, as though to himself. “We’ll be fine.”
Harry gave a rueful laugh. “Yeah, well. It was far from the worst thing to happen in my life, sadly. Kinda faded into the background at some point.”
“That’s all the stylists,” Perry told him, smiling charmingly. “If it weren’t for them, I’d probably still be in my Healer’s robes.”
I feel really bad about it, but he says it’s fine; he wants me to have things that are just mine, still. It’s the closest we’ve come to talking about this, about us. About the fact that most things that were ‘mine’ or ‘his’ have become ‘ours’.
They bickered good-naturedly for a bit as they flopped inelegantly on their backs in the sand before deciding to call it a draw. Harry closed his eyes and let the breeze soothe his sweat-damp skin. Every muscle along his back and arms felt hot and tingly, and the skin of his hands felt raw.
Harry laughed a little sadly and turned his head back toward the window. “I’m not worried.” He straightened his back slightly, and his tone was lighter when he went on. “It turned out really well, didn’t it? The party.”
Harry gave her a fond smile, remembering her childhood crush on him. Although he knew she was 23 now, it was hard for him to think of her as an adult—let alone a potential romantic partner—especially because he’d only really met her a handful of times over the years. Still, she was a sweet girl, and it would be nice to have at least one friendly face around.
“Harry.” The voice was closer now, right behind him. A hesitant hand slid up his arm, elbow to shoulder, before grasping gently to turn him. Harry kept his head down, but, once again, those damnably gentle fingers lifted his chin, forcing him to look.
“No, I expect not,” Pansy said, giving him a knowing look which Harry chose to ignore. “Goodnight, then.”
or anything. He just really enjoyed Draco’s company, that was all. Once they’d gotten past their initial awkwardness and requisite apologies, they’d fallen into a familiar pattern of snark and rivalry that had become rather… well, fun.
The rest of the sentence was lost as Harry turned to Draco and, in the absence of the adrenaline that had flooded him at the idea of danger, became suddenly, horrifyingly, aware of just how very naked the man was. Naked and
Harry groaned in embarrassment. Draco snickered behind him. “Shut up,” Harry whispered, elbowing him. “You were worse than I was.”
“Ten minutes for the bread, and we’ll be done.” Andromeda transferred the rest of the tomatoes she’d been slicing into the salad bowl and accepted a glass of wine from Harry. “Cheers.”
They had Christmas music playing in the background again, and every so often Harry or Andromeda would begin singing along, making Teddy groan and cover his ears, getting more sugar in his hair as he did so. Harry, of course, only took this as encouragement to sing even louder, much to Draco’s entertainment.
The less time they were able to spend together, the more they found that they wanted to. Soon, they both came to the same conclusion—they wanted this. They
Draco puffed out a laugh. “Indeed. My father may have been hated by quite a lot of people, but the goblins were never among them. Having obscene amounts of centuries-old wealth probably worked in his favor.” He turned his paper coffee cup in his hands, thinking. He hadn’t honestly ever considered repatriating to be an option, but he knew that a large portion of that had been rooted in the fears he’d been harboring as to the reception he would receive when he returned. Now that those fears had proven to be unfounded— “I’ll have to give it some thought,” he told Chris decisively. “I’m very flattered at the offer, but it’s too big of a decision to make on a whim.”
She pursed her lips, but beside her, Draco nodded. “Good,” he said approvingly. “The wardrobe wizard chose well.”
Draco smiled. It made him feel a little fluttery that Harry still wanted his company, even though he was obviously beyond tired.  “I’d be glad to, if you’re sure.”
This last thought briefly threw Harry into a different sort of panic as he realized that this might mean that Draco had heard their theory, if Sadiyah’s stories of their gossipiness were true. He quickly dismissed the idea, however; surely, Draco would have distanced himself by now if he had heard and believed the rumors. He wouldn’t want anything to do with Harry if he thought he was in love with him.
Luckily, Pansy and Blaise were easy to spot in the crowd, Blaise being a good few inches taller than most of the people around them.
’s side on this one. We’re not old at all.” He kept his focus on the squirming Teddy, but out of the corner of his eye, he caught Harry’s surprised grin.
“Oof!” Draco’s eyes were bleary with sleep as he attempted to understand just what was happening whilst simultaneously getting his breath back.
“Should’ve asked Nev for some Gillyweed before we left; the Great Lake was almost balmy when I used that during the Triwizard Tournament.”
Harry felt himself flush. Blaise cleared his throat pointedly. “Let’s leave that to the audience’s imaginations, shall we? Now.” He clasped his hands in front of him. “On the Muggle programme on which your experience was based, the season ends with a proposal. Due to the shortened timeline, Witch Weekly opted not to include a ring in their plans. However, we’d all love to know—is there an eleventh Most Eligible title in your future, or should we keep an eye out for a different sort of announcement?”
“That depends. Was it a dreadfully boring repetition of the same three moves you use every time we fuck?”
Suddenly, Greg’s rumbling voice rose above the others. “I’m sorry, but… how are any of you surprised by this?”
“Fine.” Draco scuffed his toe against the bridge and sighed again. “I need to get back. I have things to get in place for tomorrow.” Turning, he walked away, not looking back once as he returned to the house. Harry watched him go, something odd happening in his chest, until he was out of sight.
Harry laughed. “Good to have you back.” He pushed himself to his feet and extended a hand down to Draco. “Oh, I got the larger bottle so that you can use it before anything else we do that might trigger, you know—” He glanced pointedly at the toilet as he pulled Draco to standing and steadied him.
When they all met to head out, Harry couldn’t help but ogle his companions. He’d seen them in formalwear, athletic wear, everyday casual clothes, and even swimwear, but there was something more sensual about their clubbing clothes that he hadn’t quite anticipated.
“Our third empty seat, however, I am delighted to tell you, will not be remaining empty,” Blaise went on, interrupting Harry’s musings. “Friends, it is my pleasure to welcome next season’s Bachelor: Peregrine Derrick!”
“We call the Master Suite,” Pansy piped in from where she was perched on Ginny’s lap, running her fingers through the shaved sides of her hair.
“I wanted to give you a chance to veto the current plan,” Draco explained, perching on a nearby chair. “It’s not something you’ve done before, at least that I’m aware of, and after, ah—” He paused, so Harry finished the sentence for him.
They clinked glasses and Draco took a sip, pleasantly surprised by the mellow flavor. “So are dinners like this a frequent event?” he asked. He’d been curious ever since the matter-of-fact way that Harry had told Andromeda ‘see you on Tuesday’ over the weekend.
With the exception of his brief trip through on his way to his mother and Andromeda’s house, Draco had not set foot in Hogsmeade since his Hogwarts days. As the main street came into view, he could see why Pansy had chosen it as a nostalgia-fueled destination. Everything about it looked almost exactly the same as it had ten years ago—the last time he’d seen it before it had been completely boarded up and shut down as the war hit its stride. Zonko’s had been taken over by Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes (not much of a surprise, considering how well their flagship location had done even at the peak of the war), and the Ollivander’s outpost had been replaced by a different wandmaker that Draco was unfamiliar with—Ollivander having passed some years ago, according to his mother—but otherwise, overall, everything looked just as he remembered.
She ran out after him and on the hallway she asked if they could test it. Draco asked her to go ahead.
“Gotcha,” Harry agreed and changed the subject. “Is Ron gonna ask for a promotion now? He sure won’t go on Auror-missions any more, now that you’re pregnant.”
Draco nodded affirmatively as if Hermione could hear it, “Ms Ackles is Commissioner of the Aurors and we just came across a complicated missing person case that could be at least partially solved with your Mirror-stone-potion. I have not the authority to give out the recipe so I called you.”
, he thought. He heard Harry’s keys falling in the bowl on the small table in the hallway and the black haired man entered. In his hand he held a big bouquet of flowers. White and red roses with green fern and small white and yellows flowers.
Draco pushed himself up and yawned. A little confused, he gazed out of the window and wondered why it was open. He looked on both night stands. On Harry’s stood the clock showing five past ten. On his own laid his wand and a hairband as well as a cup of tea. With a big smile he picked up the cup and took a sip.
So she had eavesdropped on his conversation. Great. He took the bag from her, fished a single hair out and dropped it into the clear and silent liquid. The potion started bubbling wildly and a green cloud exploded out of it.
It was Ron that opened the door and he immediately realized something extraordinary, “Mate? Why are you so happy?”
“What do you think about tomato crème soup as a starter, then pasta with pesto rosso and crème brûlée,” he suggested.
Teddy nodded excited and quickly packed all his stuff in his bag. Meanwhile the young woman stood up and walked towards the parent.
“No problem,” she agreed, laughing wholeheartedly, opened the cage and gently petted the owl. “Has Harry told you how the weekend will go, yet?”
Confused, she turned to him and had a look down herself. She dressed the exactly same way she usually did in her time off work. The exact same style she had ever since her teenage years.
Narcissa sighed but in the end she led them into the winter-garden. It was still beautiful like Draco remembered it. At the small, round coffee table sat Lucius, reading the daily prophet and sipping tea.
The Aurors had done an excellent job. From the outside the barrier covered up the destroyed House of Parliament, the countless witches and wizards and most important the dragon. Everything looked normal. Everywhere were Aurors dressed like policeman, taking every statement to account and obliviating all the muggle witnesses.
With a smile, he eyed the ball-point pen and wrote down his house-telephone’s number. It was rather clear that Ms Grindal was a muggle-born and the way she behaved made it seem likely that she was also married to a muggle.
“Yes!” the boy shouldered his bag and stepped next to his uncle. “Bye, Ms Malewood, see you tomorrow.”
The woman with the wild golden locks nodded, “Yes, Absody Grindal that’s me. M-may I?” she asked gesturing to his arm.
Draco looked up, “They’re doing fine. I think I’m going to cut a nice bouquet for Sunday morning. The narcissus’ will wither soon anyway. So we have to enjoy them as long as they’re still blooming.”
The week went by quite quickly. Teddy’s seventh birthday was a lot of fun and Andromeda had had the greatest present for her grandchild. At least that’s what Teddy said.
“You said asap,” she defended herself. “Come on, Malfoy. You have the strongest witch of our generation by your side. What can worst possibly go wrong?” Her overly joyful tone changed to a caring one, “And besides, your mother is here as well, isn’t she?”
Harry just nodded and his fiancé got up, “Well, Blaise, it was a pleasure to meet you again, but I’m afraid we have to leave now. We should repeat this soon.”
“Mainly about you,” Draco answered. “You were her longest relationship. Ever since than nothing held more than two to six months.”
She laughed, “No, no. But I researched a little about you and this whole wizarding war and the name Harry Potter was all over it. He’s important to you, do I get this right?”
Harry nodded and quickly checked his looks in the mirror one last time. The white suit fitted him perfectly, being, like Draco’s, tailed onto him. The golden bow-tie was thanks to the blond also done and his hair was no mess. He quickly fixed the red and white Amaryllis in his chest pocket, then grabbed Draco’s hand and they left the room.
She nodded and handed it to him upon request. Quickly Draco tipped in a number and pressed the speaker button.
But a detective? Did he really look like one of those wannabe Sherlock Holmes cops from Scotland Yard? It seemed that way, though he wasn’t even wearing a trench coat.
“I want to find a nice meal for next Monday,” Draco replied. “You remember, Valentine’s Day? I’ve already organized that Andromeda joins me while picking Teddy up from school and brings him to school again on Tuesday.”
As the school bell rang, all the kids came running outside. Teddy was spotted quite easily today. His hair had the brightest blue Harry had ever seen on the boy.
The times in my life that I’ve known a relationship had staying power have been the ones where the mornings after were just as pleasant as the nights before. Just saying, Draco.
“We are embarrassing?” he asked jokingly. “Just be happy that Hogwarts has no teacher-parent-days like your primary school. That would be embarrassing.”
“Sure,” she replied. “My grandfather got kicked out of the Malfoy family and came to the US. We’re technically cousins.”
“You’re looking for this?” asked Lucius smiling. In his hand he waved Draco’s hawthorn wand. “This wand of yours is really good, but not quite fitting for the dark wizard you’re supposed to be. Unicorn hair in the core. I should have seen that when we first bought this wand. You’re a good-for-nothing brat.” He swung his wand with a cutting gesture, shouting, “Sectumsempra!”
Ron shrugged. His sister maybe was happy without Harry but she still hated Malfoy and missed her ex-boyfriend from time to time.
They walked over to a black haired woman in a long red coat. An Auror had just finished her memory erasure. As she spotted Draco and her daughter she ran towards them and pressed the girl to her chest.
He smiled at Josephine who just grinned back at him, petting Spike, who as always sat on her shoulder.
Confused the dark haired looked up from the memorial. Draco’s eyes were soft and loving. Looking at his love the first time for real today, he noticed that his hair was down.
Draco was honestly surprised to hear about this and he glanced thoughtfully over to Harry. His life probably would have played out a lot differently if it hadn’t been for that letter.
By the mentioning of his last name, Teddy knew he had screwed up and stuttered, “I-I should not ran away from you be-because I could get… I could get lost and then… then you would worry about me… and people could steal me away.” His voice became thinner and thinner with every word.
It was true. They used to exchange letters now and then but ever since Draco had started meeting Harry and became more occupied with his work basically every year, their contact had stopped.
“I thought a lot about it,” he replied and his thumb stroke over the engagement ring. “What house were you in. Ilvermorny, right?”
“I know!” Draco quickly threw in. “Mr Robards just wants the Beast Division to help the Aurors with the dragon as fast as possible.”
Not a second later she found herself again in the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic. Wizards and witches hurried around in the great hall, entered and exited phone-boxes and chimneys and in the middle stood a giant, beautiful fountain.
“An ultrasonic scan?” he asked and recognised Hermione’s name in the upper right corner, “You’re pregnant?”
He sighed loud and looked around. The day had been a little stressful but the thought of coming home to Draco and a beautiful dinner were enough to make him pull through it. He put the bouquet on the kitchen island, looked if Draco was coming and than sunk his hand in his pocket. He pulled out a small black box, covered in velvet. His heart beat sped up as he opened the box. An elegant silver ring laid in the box with small engravings. He heard steps on the stairs and quickly put the ring back into his pocket. ‘
“Uhm… I’m free in half an hour. You want me to take Teddy home? He can stay with me until you finish working. I know this is an urgent matter for you from the Auror-Department, sooo… if I can help…”
“I’ll come up in five minutes for a good night kiss,” Harry called after him. His gaze sunk down to Draco who had buried his head in the cookbook. Gently he grabbed Draco’s wrist and stroked over the back of his hand with the thumb. “It’s almost been three years. You should finally talk to your father.”
Draco nodded and with a swing of the wand they apparated to Godric’s Hollow in the west country of England. They landed in front of the small church, near towns square. There in the centre stood a great obelisk. As the family stepped closer, it changed, becoming the memorial to the Potter’s. It showed James and Lily, sitting on a block, with an infant Harry on his mother’s lap.
Draco run his hand through Teddy’s hair and stroked over his back, “Now you know how I would feel, if I’d ever loose you.”
“So, I made those three sketches for now. It wasn’t easy to find the perfect balance with those different kinds of flowers but I hope at least one of these suits you,” she repeated herself. “If not I can do some more.”
“Mr Malfoy, I’m terribly sorry,” she apologised immediately. “I’m so sorry. I have absolutely no idea how this could have happened. I’m really sorry. So sorry. Edward…”
Ms Grindal exhaled relieved, “I’m glad you like it. The last one is my favourite too, actually. But in the beginning I thought the first one would be the best. Guess I was wrong. Or not.” She met Draco’s gaze and chuckled awkwardly, “I’m rambling again, aren’t I?”
Draco felt his left eye twitching and had a hard time refraining himself from just shouting at this imbecile. He let out all his anger with a loud sigh and closed his eyes. The clerk opened the cage and put a small silver ring around the owls leg. Engraved on it were the names ‘
Ms Ackles led Draco to a small café in the back of the lobby. The Jarvey stayed calmly on her shoulder all the time. They sat down and ordered an extra strong double coffee black and an Earl Gray with a sip of milk and a scone.
A little later Ms Lopez appeared, giving the luggage to their owners and handing them a portkey. While Robards activated it, Draco held close onto the cage and smiled a last time at Josephine.
“Yup, I was in the Horned Serpent house,” she said. “There were also Wampus, Thunderbird and Pukwudgie.”
“I gave her to a friend to take care of her,” Draco explained. “My fiancés birthday is only on Sunday and I want it to be a surprise.”
Draco didn’t answer. Kelly put her paws on his lap and purred. He took another piece of cheese and gave it to her.
“Samuel G. Quahog,” the president said and pointed to the black woman next to him, “this is my personal assistant Ms Anna Lopez and this” he pointed to the woman with the ferret, “is Auror Commissioner Josephine Ackles.”
He decided that she would at least deserve to know that little about him, “At school, during fourth year, a teacher transformed me into a ferret. He wanted to teach me a lesson, because I had been a prick towards some classmates.”
Harry tried to listen, he really did, but he couldn’t seem to keep his mind from wandering. He found himself thinking what it would be like to be having this conversation with Draco, instead—what it would be like to be curled up on a couch with him with a glass of wine, talking about their future.
“No, that’s fine, I’ll only be a minute.” Ron seemed to be having some sort of internal debate before he sighed. “Alright. Look. You can’t tell Harry I was here, okay?”
Stooping down, Harry pulled as many as he could fit in his arms into a huge group hug. “Hey there! I missed you all. Would you like to meet my friend, Miss Hilde? She’s come to play with you today, too.” Harry looked up at Hilde, hoping that her initial shock had worn off enough for her to enjoy herself.
“Sanctimonious man who died to save everyone and then came back to life only to be sanctimonious at them some more? Tell me you don’t see the resemblance.”
“I don’t know if I can tell you that without getting him in trouble,” he answered, “but it’s been very much appreciated.”
Greg settled the peel on the table and turned to give Pansy a disapproving look. She looked studiously away from him. “Pansy Parkinson, I pulled your head back from that fire myself. You apologize to Ron.”
Harry rolled his eyes and got up to serve himself some of the snacks, now that the ever-ravenous Weasleys were out of the way. “Draco, do you want anything while I’m up?” he asked. When he got no response, he turned back, only to see Draco looking distinctly green. “You okay?”
“Harry forgetting doesn’t really surprise me, actually; we all know he hasn’t gotten laid in years,” Pansy opined. Harry gave an inadvertent squawk of protest, but she continued without pause. “Draco, however, is a filthy hypocrite.” She smirked, and he scowled. “Just how many times
Sullivan was grinning as he took Harry’s skis from him and helped him climb back on board for the umpteenth time. Their spotter stood to the side with her arms crossed, looking vaguely amused. She’d insisted on taking the lead on getting Harry out of the water the first few times he fell, but had eventually decided that Sullivan was up for the task and let them handle it themselves. “I think you almost had it that time,” he said, and Harry laughed, pushing his sopping hair out of his face.
“Fair enough.” They fell into a companionable silence, their arms close enough to feel each other’s warmth. After a while, Harry spoke again. “Joking aside, I’m not particularly interested in a sports rivalry dictating who I spend my time with. You?”
Draco hummed, kissing him back before retreating so that he could see Harry’s face. “No regrets, then?” he asked, voice teasing but gaze serious. Harry ran a hand through his tousled hair.
CW for a scene with someone coming on too strong that probably falls under attempted non-consensual contact. It’s brief and over the top in a way that is intended to be comedic, but if you’re uncomfortable, you can skip from “Great! There’s a path to the gardens out this way” to the next section break and should be able to get the gist of what happened from the next bit!
The two groups split off, half in red jerseys, the others in blue, and argued amongst themselves for several minutes. Harry stood back, observing how they all interacted with each other. Cormac seemed, unsurprisingly, to have declared himself Captain of the blue team and was shouting over everyone in an attempt to assign roles while Romilda glared daggers at him, apparently more invested now that there was a prize on the line. Meanwhile, most of the red team seemed more confused than anything, and Perry appeared to be patiently trying to explain the different roles to them all. Harry winced in sympathy. He’d sort of assumed that everyone knew the rules of Quidditch, but he was beginning to think that his group of friends was not a representative sample.
. “I suppose they aren’t the only people to make an unexpected match in recent years. Did you hear that Mrs. Nott seems to have struck up an acquaintance with Xenophilius Lovegood?”
She blushed and grinned. “My first figure drawing instructor said that the models could just be used as references once you had enough practice. But I don’t think it looks
Soon, all of them were roasting their marshmallows to various degrees of success. Draco was following Hermione’s exacting standards, brow furrowed as he aimed for the perfect shade of brown. Ginny lit several on fire in turn, crusting them in a layer of crunchy carbon before blowing them out and eating them plain, grinning as Pansy rolled her eyes at her. Ron started out trying to emulate his girlfriend, but evidently got impatient, because soon he was blowing out flames on a marshmallow that was half toasty brown, half black and burned.
In response, Harry sank to the floor next to him and handed him the brown paper bag he was clutching. Draco opened it curiously and let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a moan of relief. “You are my hero. I adore you. You are my best friend, and Pansy can go fuck herself.”
“You can creep on my stuff later, Draco,” Harry called over his shoulder as Draco fell behind, a smile evident in his voice.
When they returned to the cabin, they were greeted by an empty house. Ron poked around as Harry and Greg unloaded the groceries, trying to figure out where everyone had gone, and eventually found a note in Hermione’s handwriting on the table indicating that they’d all gone down to the pier. Once everything was put away, the trio wandered down the path to join them all.
From there, it turned urgent and sloppy, Draco grabbing his cock with one hand while he braced himself next to Harry’s head with the other, kissing him with what would have been an embarrassing lack of finesse if he’d had enough sensibility left for embarrassment. Harry came suddenly, with a startled jerk of his hips and a moan muffled by Draco’s lips. Draco kept moving, pulling himself harder until he finally spilled over Harry’s sweat-glistening stomach.
Harry’s eyes twinkled good-humoredly in the low light and began, his voice taking on the cadence of a storyteller. “So, I was still kind of panicking even after we’d talked, because I didn’t know who else might have heard and I was afraid something might get back to you. Ron was a total arse about it at first—kept refusing to tell me and laughing when I’d get mad about it—but he finally gave in when I threatened to stop babysitting.”
“Draco Malfoy, you absolute bloody coward, get your arse to this bar before I show up and drag you here myself!”
In response, Harry stepped closer and leaned up, kissing him. Draco smiled into it, hands finding their way to Harry’s hips as he responded. He felt Harry’s tongue brush against his lower lip and met it for a moment before pulling back.
When Blaise was successfully petting Reginald, Harry decided it was safe to let his shield down, and the others slowly followed suit. Luna had each of them ‘meet’ Reginald separately, holding their hands out so that she could familiarize herself with each of their scents. The whole thing was surreal, Harry thought. Obviously-magical creatures were one thing, but the Wampus Cat looked so much like a run-of-the-mill mountain lion that it seemed extraordinarily uncanny to be interacting with it like this.
would never hurt anyone on purpose. You’re just… a bit clueless. Which I am apparently into, because I like you a lot, unfortunately for me.” He sighed. “But I’ll get over it. Besides,” he added, “Sadiyah told me that in the Muggle version of this show, the runner-up usually gets to be the next Bachelor or Bachelorette or whatever. So who knows. Maybe someone will be sabotaging my shitty dates this time next year.”
Draco spent the rest of the afternoon learning just how T-Rex was expected to swing the battle in favor of Team Dinosaur.
Draco opened his mouth, shut it, and then moved in a way that suggested he was about to make a run for it. Harry’s hand shot out to grab him by the wrist. “Don’t you fucking dare,” he hissed.
The thing was that every time he looked at Harry, so obviously happy and in his element, Draco felt unmoored. His tousled hair, his sparkling eyes, the way he seemed at ease in his body—they added up to more than just physical appeal. They highlighted who he was as a person: his easygoing, friendly way of existing, living so much in the moment. Draco couldn’t imagine living that way, the open vulnerability of it, and he envied it. He
“Right. So, the thing is, he’d never ask you.” Draco still didn’t understand what he was saying, and Ron sighed again. “To stay,” he clarified. “He’d never ask you to stay.” Draco could feel his eyes go wide, and Ron rushed on. “Look, I know you didn’t want people to know about the two of you, but he didn’t tell us, Hermione figured it out, so you can’t be mad at him.”
“Impossible is just a state of mind, Draco.” Luna chided gently, squeezing his fingers. “As it happens, I can help you with both, if you’d like.”
It was too much for Teddy and Kelly so they sneaked away, just to see how Ginny dropped her empty glass and her jaw. The glass broke into a thousand pieces. Teddy noticed Crookshanks walking towards the shards. He ordered Kelly to wait, ran to the other cat and picked it up so it wouldn’t step into a shard. Then he stepped to Ginny and looked up to her startled face.
While the desk-clerk checked her documents, Jared grabbed his sisters shoulder, “Are you serious? Have you not noticed how much you have changed ever since last year?”
There was a great success with it in Germany. Also, we maybe have to organize a mass-obliviation in case we can’t stop that terrorist.”
“No,” Draco said clearly. “You wouldn't see Kelly a much longer time if you get kidnapped. Kelly stays with Hermione over the weekend.”
“No dog,” Draco said. “We have Teddy and Kelly and as long as Teddy still lets his toys lay around everywhere, we’re not getting a puppy.”
Curious he opened the small box and found a silver tie pin. On its end was an elegant owl with tiny green emerald eyes.
Draco smiled, gently stroking over the head of a rose, “Technically, it’s thanks to your mother that you are still here. I guess I can wear a flower on my skin, resembling Lily Potter.”
Blaise stared at Draco for awhile, trying to figure it out. The ring hinted to a simple guy, maybe wealthy like the Malfoy’s themselves.
Teddy nodded and they stepped inside the house. While Teddy dropped himself on the couch, Draco walked upstairs. He thought about Harry’s words and tried to imagine roses, narcissus’ and lilies around and over the dark mark. The skull and snake made bad memories return. As if to make sure that it had lost its power he stroked over it with his wand.
“I can manage that.” He collected the ingredients he would need—olive oil, lemon, white wine vinegar, some spices—and got to work.
“Congratulations, Perry, Sadiyah, and Leela!” Blaise announced jovially as a floating silver tray holding five glasses of champagne popped into existence next to him. “You’ve made it to the very end. This week, each of you will have a chance to spend an entire evening and night alone with Harry—
He leaned in to kiss Harry once more. Despite their conversation, there was no urgency behind it, just enjoyment of the fact that this was something they could do now. Harry didn’t think he would ever get sick of it—Draco’s mouth against his, his tongue slipping past his lips, his teeth occasionally nipping at his bottom lip. Harry’s hand caressed up Draco’s chest, around his side, down his back, over the smooth skin of his buttocks. He hitched Draco’s leg, pulling it over his own hip so that he could tease his fingers up the long, firm thigh. Draco smiled into Harry’s mouth, pulling him closer with his foot, long fingers tracing patterns over Harry’s back and shoulders.
Harry had his mouth open to reply when Leela jumped up with a startled yelp, followed by a pained “ow, fuck!”
“Harry,” Draco sighed in fond exasperation. “I’m just going to the loo; I’ll be right back. You won’t even have time to miss me.”
Draco looked rueful. “How could I forget? You punched me in the stomach and sicced the Weasley twins on me and my friends. Not that we didn’t deserve it, in retrospect.” He paused, understanding dawning. “Ah.”
“Practice, I suppose. You did a very good job for your first time, though. I’d be happy to have you model for my usual class any time you’d like.”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Perry said from where he was holding one of her arms, “but Hilde’s telling the truth.”
“Oh, nothing interesting,” Hilde demurred. “I’m more interested in what I do outside of work, to be honest. I love art, theater, and music, and I adore traveling. I’d spend all my time jetting around the world if I could. But for now, I work in a shop.”
“At least it’s not front page news?” Hermione’s attempt at an optimistic voice wasn’t all that convincing, but Harry appreciated that she was trying. She wasn’t wrong; the small article—titled
Draco’s hand released immediately and his eyes opened. “What’s wrong?” His breathing was rough, but his eyes were concerned.
He shook his head in amusement. Apparently everybody had their own idea of what made for a good vacation.
Soon, the pile on the table was significant enough that it was time to move on. “Where are my fellow puzzlers?” Leela called, and Dermot, Rose, Sadiyah, and Gabrielle joined her. They bent their heads together and started moving things around, speaking rapidly, so Harry left them to it, moving back into the maze.
Harry whimpered as Draco’s hand began to move again, which he hoped Draco would interpret as the “yes please” that it was. The sense of urgency had begun to subside during their brief break, but it didn’t take long before he found himself back on the edge, hopelessly aroused by the feel of Draco’s fingers tight around them, the smell of the crook of his neck, the small sounds he was making. “Fuck, I’m— oh fuck.” His fingers clenched into the skin of Draco’s sweat-damp back, and Draco took this as encouragement to speed up his strokes. Harry had only seconds before his orgasm shot from him, his entire body tensing as he failed to stifle a resoundingly loud groan.
“I don’t know, really.” Harry paused, knowing that he wouldn’t be let off the hook with only that for an answer. “Everyone who’s still here is someone that I could potentially see myself with, but they’re all really different from one another. I think… I think that sometimes, you don’t really know what you’re looking for until you find it. You know? So I can’t really predict where I’ll end up. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to the solo dates. It will be great to get to really know them all a bit better to see how we might fit.”
“Great.” As Dermot arranged the instrument and his hands, he explained, “This isn’t an original, because I thought that might be a bit intense— writing you a song before we even met. But I think it captures how I feel about being here pretty well.”
“Well, Harry and I have been friends for a long while, now. It wouldn’t be at all suspect if I were to write to him or visit him. And as I’ll be there for all of your practices, I could easily pass along letters or messages for you.”
still floating, just differently,” Blaise pointed out, and Draco shot him a glare that was much less effective than usual, tinged with nausea as it was.
Harry obediently lifted his salt-covered skin toward his mouth. Before it got there, though, Hilde caught it and brought it back towards herself, holding her own hand out to him. Gulping, he listened to her count down from three and then licked the salt off her hand, chasing it with the burning liquor and then quickly biting into his lime slice. He was acutely aware of her tongue against his skin as she did the same. When they dropped what was left of their limes into their glasses, she grinned at him. “Well done, you. Come dance?”
“Alright then. I’ll floo you.” Giving in to temptation, he leaned down and kissed Harry once more, feather-light and lingering. “Good night, Harry.”
Their conversation was interrupted by the line reaching the ride platform, after which they had no time to speak at all, their breath being completely occupied with screaming whoops as they flew uncontrollably around the alarmingly spiraling track.
“Do you really? Well that’s disturbing to hear. And no tea, thank you, I can’t stay for long. I just wanted to say hello and invite you out for drinks on Thursday.”
“I appreciate that,” Draco said, and meant it. “But it doesn’t change the fact that I’m not seeing anyone.”
“Yeah, of course.” Slughorn had been the same way, at first, Harry remembered. Half the reason he’d agreed to come back to Hogwarts was to avoid being forcibly recruited. Still, he’d come around in the end. “Do you regret not coming back to help?”
“Don’t be silly, Draco, go along! You haven’t left the house since you’ve been here,” Narcissa urged.
They dragged the sled back up the hill and repeated the run twice more. Draco was starting to feel the ache of it in his muscles, and knew he wouldn’t be able to go for much longer. Harry seemed to be wearing down as well, his movements clumsier as he tried to right himself after their last descent. “Can we do the highest one?” Teddy begged when they’d all finally scrambled to their feet.
Harry closed the door behind himself, looking down at the floor where the puzzle lay. “You finished it,” he said dumbly. Walking over, he took the final piece from Draco’s hand, looking at it and then up at him.
Harry looked at him, confused. “I mean, it probably is, but does that really make a difference? You said you didn’t want to be a consolation prize.”
It didn’t actually take them long, once they were actively looking; the button was on the wall next to the table, clearly labeled. “Well. There goes my Seeker cred,” Harry grimaced.
“Harry,” Pansy said, her expression both determined and quite visibly done with his shit. “I have known Draco Malfoy since we were five years old. I have watched him watching you since we were eleven. He spends more time with you than he does with literally anyone else in his life. His fucking face lights up when you come into a room. He touches you constantly, you have about nine thousand inside jokes, and he hasn’t gone out with anyone else in like two years. Salazar, Potter, he
Blaise tapped a fork against his glass, getting everyone’s attention. Harry spared a moment to wonder where he’d even gotten it; there was no food, so surely there shouldn’t be forks.
“Good night, Draco.” Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets, grinning giddily at Draco as he took a few backwards steps before finally turning to walk away. Draco watched him go, wondering just how badly this was going to hurt, in the end, but thinking that it would probably be worth it.
Harry was already standing at the bar when Draco entered, and the smile he shared thawed Draco more than the warm air that enveloped him as he closed the door behind himself. “First round is on me,” he said, and Draco accepted gratefully.
Harry grinned. “Never ventured off 9 3/4 at Christmas?” Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry laughed. “Right. Nevermind. King’s Cross has one of the best Christmas Markets in London; some of the Muggleborn kids at school used to talk about it. I always wanted to go, but I never went home for the holidays. Not that my relatives would have let me, anyway. So, I go every year now, just because I can—this is Teddy’s first time, though.”
“He’s been cool a couple times,” Harry argued. “There was that whole thing with the bomb in the basement. That was pretty cool.”
Harry huffed a surprised laugh. “That’s true.” He wrinkled his nose at the memory of Cormac’s slobbery attack. “Merlin. If Hermione’s accounts are anything to go by, his kissing skills have stayed pretty consistent since fifth year. That was bloody awful.”
Stepping up to Hilde’s, he looked at it a bit more closely. It was an impressively realistic charcoal drawing, but the person it portrayed looked more like Sullivan than Harry, with its stark muscles and chiseled jaw.
“Even Gryffindors know better than to try to have a conversation with the parent of someone they fucked, like, ten minutes before,” Harry said wryly.
He let out a slow breath. “One. Night,” he capitulated through gritted teeth. “But understand me, Father—I am not a token in your ridiculous game of politics and power. Plot to your heart’s content, but leave me out of it.” Looking down at his half-full plate, he sighed. “I’ve lost my appetite. I’m going up to bed.”
