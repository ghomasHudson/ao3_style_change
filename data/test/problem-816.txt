‘I notice you too,’ he said, his breath leaving him in a rush.
He chuckles. It’s a flat kind of laugh, but it’s still a laugh. Somewhat careless. But his eyes are on me. I have his whole attention.
Harry’s eyes lingered on his hands over his belt, then on his hips, and when Draco was expecting them to lower still, they climbed up again. As if he wasn’t sure he could keep still if he did look where he
There was once a time when coming here made you think of tumbling down. Easy, you lean forward, feel the wind, wish for it.
‘I could try for you…’ he said, lifting his eyes, his lips parted slightly. ‘I just want to please you, Malfoy...’
I whisper
Green eyes looked up at him.
Harry let his head fall on the crook of his neck and inhaled, not wanting to acknowledge the presence of anyone else in the room just yet. He wanted Draco’s scent on him forever. He wished he didn’t have to let go. He closed his eyes.
‘Attack him in a corridor before class tomorrow?’ He asks quietly. ‘Save me again?’
Like the best kind of drug, Potter finds me at my weakest. He says this as he moves right into my personal space, body warm & wired from dancing. I can almost taste the heat of his chosen hookup for the night on him. But I don’t miss the fact that he’s left the bloke he’d been pinning against a wall for hours, to walk all the way across the club and stand this close to me.
There’s a second of silence where I let myself panic. But I didn’t dye my hair pink for nothing. It’s a bold statement. Like what I just said. My hand climbs an inch up his leg.
He nods.
I’m thoroughly drunk and drenched to the bone. I’m only wearing a thin white shirt and a grey wool jumper, with my tightest black trousers. Pansy says I look even hotter in Muggle clothes. A part of me is intent on testing her theory tonight, just not in the way she intended me to.
‘These are hideous.’ He mutters, brushing his fingers on the sweater.
He realised he couldn’t feel Draco’s hand on his leg anymore… did he leave? Did he not like it? Wasn’t he happy with Harry? Wasn’t Harry good enough? Maybe he’d had better… a man like him, he could have anyone. Harry did not want to cry but he couldn’t reel it in, his whole body was stretched beyond belief, his emotions wrecked.
‘I want to be it, Draco,’ Harry said, turning his head and placing a kiss over his shaft. His tongue darted out lightly, and Draco hissed. ‘Want to be your fucking place to relax.’ The words huffed over his cock, warm, wet and for a second he lost their meaning, only to find it next. Harry swallowed him down.
me when we get horizontal. His hands fall on my hips, no doubt in them about where this is going. I can’t fucking think straight.
He rubs his face against the hard line of your cock. It’s maddening, even with your pants still on. His hands rest on your thighs. You fight back a half-moan, half-scream. The sight of him, all formal and upright on his knees and, at the same time, his face, so focused, so pretty, lodges itself on your mind. You like him like this.
‘Hey Parkinson,’ he says in a tight voice, his hand still on mine.
‘And quite mouthy too.’
He turns his face against my hand and kisses my palm. I practically melt against him. His hands climb up my arms. His eyes take a peek at the room around us, encompassing the open trunk, clothes everywhere, scattered books.
He kisses the other side of your neck and you melt, your hands drop down to his arse, it’s perfect, Malfoy is so gorgeous, in fact, he’s the most gorgeous man you ever made out with, because that’s what you’re both doing. Making out. On his living room. It’s the slow build-up of it all that surprises you the most. He’s taking his time with you, he isn’t in a rush to remove more of your clothes even if you’re slowly starting to feel trapped inside your trousers.
‘Just ask.’ He speaks these words nearly into my mouth. He says them in that way that’s so very him: warm and like he couldn’t care less. And I love the fact that I’m the only one who knows just how much he cares.
Draco’s other hand trailed up Harry’s thigh. He leaned over and forced Harry to bend his knees, lifting his legs up. Harry groaned at the feel of Draco’s cock finally rubbing against his own. He wasn’t hard, but he would be, sooner than later. He already felt his cock responding to the contact, swelling slowly. Draco pressed his palm against both their cocks and Harry fought to not arch back into the touch. Malfoy had forbidden him to move. He trembled when Malfoy’s teeth bit on his nipple. They were so close, still not close enough.
‘What are you on about?’
Draco felt his own body burning up. Like he was the one kissing Harry, that mouth opening up under his, allowing him in, that hand gripping at his clothes, feverish and needy, fingers searching under the fabric, pulling him close. Like Harry had done when they’d kissed.
Of course he’d heard it before from other Doms, but it was nothing like it. The word
You suck his nipple into your mouth. You try to do it as thoroughly as you would his cock. He arches off the bed, his thighs wrapping around you. He bites on his lip. His skin starts to feel damp under your hands and your tongue, his scent more acute now, like elderflowers and something else you can’t identify — only, that it’s driving you
Shit. How hard are you?
Something in Harry shattered, he looked down, avoiding the grey eyes, fighting the words out.
He already knows what I think of him. We’re not doing
‘You’re more than an addiction. You’re- I had a taste of you seven months ago and that was it for me.’
So do the trees, and the leaves, and the dust, and the stars, and the moon, and the night bugs.
He actually bites his lip, a flash of insane hope on his eyes.
‘Of all the things, what you want is for me to kiss you?’ Draco’s voice was hoarse, Harry felt a tingle of irony in it, but the irony was drowning in surprise and want. And Draco wasn’t able to hide it. His body flared up again, drawn to Malfoy’s.
‘No, please, I don’t want it to be over, I can take it, please… I’ll be good, I’ll be so good for you Malfoy… please, let me show you.’
The little gasp he makes, the muffled surprise, the taste of his lips, his mouth opening up to yours and the moment he surrenders. His hands fist your hair, yours go everywhere on him. You kiss him not realising you’re moving, until his back hits a wall and you pin him there and keep kissing him, drunk on his taste — whisky, vanilla, but mostly
Potter smiles at him, looks down at the sign, like it could answer the question for him. He looks shy. It shouldn’t fit him. But it does.
‘On Christmas Eve?’
Her touch brings me back to Hogwarts, to those horrible nights, in which Pansy was the only person reminding me I was still human. That I was still lovable, no matter how low I sunk, no matter what horrible things I had to do. I feel her take a deep breath.
His hands are on my pants again, he pushes them all the way down. I remember the wandless hex. I can use it. This is why I learned it. To get away when all else failed. I have to use it. I have to- his hands are on my throat, his cock between my legs, but he’s not quite there yet, where he wants to be, he’s trying to force me into a position- I try to summon it, my magic-
‘Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy and I’ve been Potter-free for 2 weeks.’
‘And here I thought I had seen it all this night,’ she says, her eyes drifting to our hands on his thigh. It’s so fucking intimate, so good, that I smile like an idiot and say nothing in return.
‘And here I thought I had seen it all this night,’ she says, her eyes going from his hand to me and back again.
I never want anything as much as I want to hurt him. To get some sort of reaction out of him. We duel fast and furious. If I still cared for it, I’d say we’re top of the class. But I no longer give a fuck about grades, I just want Hogwarts to be done. To check that off the list.
‘I’m falling for you.’
It’s all that matters.
‘I want him too,’ he found himself saying.
In which Draco made some changes, Harry has run out of words and happiness is a thing.
‘You’re right,’ he says, without moving. Quite suddenly there’s not enough space between us, my pulse beating wildly still trapped in his hands. ‘I want it so badly... it almost kills me.’
Draco released his grip on Harry and stepped back. With an impressive control, Harry managed to stay upright, gasping, wild-eyed.
Then Josh was there, hard body against Harry’s back, his unmistakable scent, his beard brushing against his neck, his hands tightening over his arse. Negotiation and talking and getting to know were over. Harry was going to be left in Malfoy’s hands.
damned good at it. Right up until Harry Potter - green eyes a man could lose himself in; sweet fucked-out voice saying
Harry’s hands climbed up his thighs, pulling at the hem of his trousers and pants, pushing them further down. He was careful and purposeful and every bit the teaser he looked as he bent down his head and let his breath huff over Draco’s thighs.
I don’t answer, don’t even nod. I just let him take my hand and drag me to the back door.
Draco bent his head down and his tongue flicked over Harry’s hard nipple. He was tasting Harry. Then he turned around, walked two steps to the side table where his instruments were displayed, and he picked up the cane. Harry sucked in a breath.
‘You’re close,’ he said. He’d never been able to read anyone this easily.
if you really wanted to. The problem was… you had to mean it. He didn’t want to resist Potter.
‘I’m going to eat you out. I don’t need to tell you you’re not allowed to come, do I?’
I did not know I was about to tell him this, but it’s not untrue. He’s practically seething with quiet anger.
‘I get to be your fucktoy, Draco.’
His fingers curl on the table.
‘I want you… Want you to fuck me. Use me. When Josh hands me over I want to be a hole…’ his throat was dry.
You both finish the cigarettes in the same loaded silence. You wait for him to reach for his silver case again, but he doesn’t. He also doesn’t leave.
‘Open your mouth, Harry.’
‘Please, Malfoy.’
‘Tell me,’ his mouth twisted in a smile and his voice rose, hoarse and unrecognizable. ‘I want you begging for my cock in your mouth like it’s the only fucking thing you want in life.’
‘I noticed the flask…’ He says quietly. ‘I just didn’t think that—’
‘Is that it?’
‘I came here to kindly ask you to fuck me,’ I say, my voice in its usual drawl. I set the bowl on the counter. It clinks brightly between us. ‘Since I can’t seem to get you out of my system, I might as well get you in. Deep.’
I stare at my neatly socked feet. Seven months. Two weeks. 3 days. Whatever hours are right about now. Give or take.
‘Look, I haven’t seen him for weeks- he’s probably avoiding-’
‘Oh.’
In the hallway, you manage to get his shirt open. Your hands stop on the stark-white scars you made all those years ago.
Merlin, he was so beautifully submissive, all thank yous and sorrys when needed. So fucking obedient. It made Draco eager to make him lose all coherent speech and thought. He’d play the game until Harry was beyond crazy with need. Ready to beg and do anything for a simple pat of Draco’s hand.
Enough for him to witness the sudden change in Harry’s face.
It’s like lifting a heavy weight from my chest. I’m not sentimental, but I swear his smile rivals the sun. You know, if you could look at the sun. Which you can, but you shouldn’t. Salazar, that’s fucking cheesy and I need to
You stand there, too close to him to be proper, the drink burning down your throat and you finally wonder what you’re doing at 2 am in Draco Malfoy’s apartment.
Tonight, he takes his time. He likes to leave me hanging. Maybe that’s what tells him I’m real. Desserts come and go. People go out to smoke, come back with laughs. Someone asks me something and I answer it. He watches me. No one looks at me like he does. Like he can take all of me.
. I add a warming spell and light my cigarette. Inhale. Exhale. In all this, my wand never left my pocket. I've been practicing wandless, non-verbal magic. Sometimes, I think it’s the only thing that still has any meaning. The only thing I have left. Inhale, exhale.
I learn to cook more than scrambled eggs. I cook all our meals with the help of the elves. They felt hurt when I told them I wanted to do it all by myself, so we do it together. He comes to the kitchen to watch us. He sits at the table and we eat together. I bake cakes. He invites his friends. I don’t talk much, but they’re always nice to me. I know they’re worried about him, but he’s gained weight in the last weeks.
The way Harry responded to his voice was overwhelming. He swayed on the spot, his shoulders trembled. Wild traces of magic emanated from him, raw. Draco fucking loved this brand of uncontrolled magic.
Draco held his breath as that word unleashed something inside him.
He takes my hand in his, kisses it in an almost gentlemanly way. The gesture is so at odds with what we’re doing, with what we are, that I hate him all the more for it. Love him all the more for it. I suppress a shiver.
and people think they’ll be dating a hero. Random shags are tiresome after a while.
‘We look good together,’ he says.
We start to sleep together, me and the ghosts and him.
‘Say it again,’ he urges, eyes intent on my face.
But he keeps speaking over me
‘God.’ This time, he’s the one to wax religious. ‘You have to admit this is the weirdest shit—’
‘She’s fine,’ Pansy’s fingernails caress my hair. ‘A bit worried about her best friend going all suicidal saviour again.’
Since that night, we started sleeping together. We don’t ever talk about it, or about what it means, but he comes over to my room around the same time every night. He brings his toothbrush and one day I notice he doesn’t bother to put it back in his bag. It stays there, right next to mine. Like the array of his hair products, three or four different bottles, placed in an ordered row, supposedly all destined for a different purpose that I know nothing about. Like his pyjamas, folded neatly on a chair, and the heavy books he brings from the library (which look exactly like the sort of light-reading Hermione fancies) and that he places on our nightstand, after perusing through them a bit before sleeping. And Draco Malfoy wears glasses, which when I first noticed it, nearly shocked me. He uses them only to read, they’re thin and modern and even though I never imagined him wearing glasses, now I can’t imagine him any other way. There’s something so weirdly comforting about his silence as he reads, his head tipped slightly down, a strand of his white-blonde hair falling over one side of his face, the concentrated stare. I have to force myself to look away and open the Seeker Weekly magazine Ron lent to me, staring at the flying picture of some famous American Seeker like it’s the most interesting thing in the world. But I feel him taking a peek at me here and there. I don’t react to it. I pretend to read on and feel his eyes on me.
It’s very late when I finally find him in our spot. No rain, no stars, only a slice of moon in the sky.
He unbolts the door & leaves.
Harry waited for the negotiations. On his knees, cock already hard, hands placed behind his back, the way Josh appreciated. He wasn’t allowed to listen in to the conversation, but he knew what Josh was doing. He gave out the rules to use Harry. Aside from Harry’s hard limits, there weren’t many. Josh only had two: he was the one to decide if and when Harry was allowed to come and he was the one to take Harry home and fuck him last. He’d never changed these rules.
‘Lick.’
She’s about to leave, but turns again on her heels to give me a once over.
We’re anonymous bodies, drunk on alcohol & bad blasting music. Except there’s nothing anonymous about us. He knows exactly who I am when he grinds against me. I know exactly who he is when he feels me up. That doesn’t stop us from playing the game every lonely stranger plays in clubs like this. We let the crowd & the flashing lights render us unknown. We dance the night away, bodies pressed up to each other, closer than we’ve ever been. He feels both familiar & strange, his scent addictive, his body pliant & strong, hands intent on committing every hard ridge & every soft spot of my body to physical memory. That’s how I become another one of the pretty boys he likes to pin to a wall. He kisses up my neck, but when I try to reach for his mouth, he denies me, turning his face away. I’ve seen him kiss enough blokes on this same dancefloor to notice the difference in treatment. I feel dirty & wrong, but even that feels strangely right. He smiles at me, a secret smile, meant for my eyes only, everything about it so unsettling. His lips brush the corner of my mouth, then part on a sweet exhale that makes my head spin.
‘Take them,’ he said.
Malfoy tilted his head in interest, his hair falling to the side. Harry saw arousal in the deep grey eyes.
Oh. He did. He wanted Malfoy crazy with want for him. And he fucking wanted those fingers to move over his cock. He would give anything for a few seconds of that hand wanking him. It would be the perfect torture. A sweet resounding moan came out of his mouth at the thought.
Harry knew he had heard him. He just wanted Harry to say it again. Out loud. Now that he wasn’t blindfolded, he couldn’t admit he wanted to be fucked by Draco Malfoy. Everything felt more real like this, like he couldn’t hide from his own deepest desires, like Malfoy could see through him.
I know better than to make a joke. So I nod, then ask mildly.
‘I thought I was the only one…’ Harry said, but he didn’t even finish that sentence, because Draco was taking his mouth again and he was letting Harry inside, his fingers catching on Harry’s hair, hurting, easing.
There’s no point in denying it. Pansy knows me better than anyone. She’s known me since forever. Trying to lie to her is a waste of everyone’s time. If there’s one thing we Slytherins hate is wasting time. And bad coffee. And Golden Boys who fuck with our heads. But mostly that last one. There, I said it. Or thought it, whatever.
‘You don’t need to feel awkward about this, Harry. We know he’s changed. It’s okay.’
He’s looking at me with a ton of purpose and the greenest eyes ever. He sets his coffee on the table.
I hex him on the spot, he blocks me, then curses me. I double over, pain shooting down my spine. I love that he’s officially dropped the good boy act. He curses viciously, albeit far from
I’m his.
There’s still no tongue in our kiss. We’ve been so many things, but this is unlike anything I imagined us to be. He drags his lips over mine. I do the same, and it’s slow and a bit maddening because I know he’s holding back. I can sense it in the way he tenses against me, in the undercurrent of his magic going all over the place in a way that I kind of love.
‘What do you want?’ I ask.
happened, that is.
to the wise.’
His tongue swirled around Malfoy’s fingers. He thought of Malfoy’s cock. How it would feel on his mouth, the weight of it on his tongue, fucking him so deep he would happily gag on it. He wanted it down his throat, like those fingers. His scalp was hurting, Malfoy’s other hand gripping his hair so tightly and Harry’s body was on fucking fire. A low pleading sound came out of his mouth and Malfoy’s fingers were suddenly gone, as was his hand on Harry’s hair.
‘I’ll have none of that. I want to
Harry drew in a sharp breath, his eyes losing their dazed quality.
Before, you had counted the nights, one after another, thinking there was some hope at the end of it. Now you know that darkness is about losing all references. There’s no time when you’re in the dark. No space, only depth.
Life is supposed to be a certain way. It’s not supposed to be like… this.
My fingers twist in the air. The door locks, his body jerks against mine. My magic is a turn-on for him, I realise. My wrist moves again, the silencing spell building up a wall around us.
‘Is it?...’
‘This isn’t me rejecting you,’ he said, his fingers on Harry’s cheek. ‘But I need to ask you something very important and then, if you want, I’ll bring you down again, safely.’ Draco paused, and his voice shook. ‘I promise I’ll keep you safe, Harry.’
‘You’re a sight being stuffed both ways,’ he said, the words hitting him like a storm.
I look at her, and for a moment none of us say a word. This is by far the longest conversation I’ve had with Parkinson. And it’s all about the one person I never discuss with any of my closest friends. Not even Hermione. Now her wife is in on the only secret I’ve been keeping. The irony is not lost on me.
Harry climbs on the bed next to me.
other than friends. I knew we were over the moment I saw Ginny after the Battle, covered in ashes and wreck. Alive, breathing, a fighter. I never loved her as much as I did in that moment. I also knew it wouldn’t be enough. We broke up a week after the War. I don’t know who said it first. But we were over. We were also having sex. And kept doing it. We’re still doing it.
‘No, Malfoy,’ he shook his head, lost in the feeling of Malfoy around him, hands restless over his thighs, skimming, twisting. He did not deem himself worthy of that cock, hard, long, pressing through Malfoy’s perfectly tailored trousers, right against his arse.
He tells me I can use his library. I sit there for hours, looking at the shelves still silently standing. I remember I burned all my books. I’m unable to read a word. I never pick up a book anymore, much less open one. I can’t dream. But I like the quiet of his books.
‘He threatened me- if I didn’t- So I… sucked him off. But it wasn’t enough to stop him-’
I close my mouth. She gives an exaggerated sigh. Ever the drama queen. One of the reasons I love her.
Saying it out loud is more difficult than I thought it would be. I finally dare to take a peek at him. I’m surprised to find how familiar Harry’s eyes are to me. I know them. I know him. And he does not look at me with pity. I realise that he never did.
Pansy lifts up her well-manicured hand, palm up towards me.
I swear my mouth hangs open for a full 20 seconds. Nothing comes out of it.
Josh smiled. He clearly knew how to play this game.
I’m his dirty secret.
‘During the War, me, Hermione and Ron were hiding. We were hunting for the Horcruxes. It drew us apart… one day, Ron left us. He came back guided by a light, much like the one I conjured up for you. The light told him where we were. It got him back to where he belonged, and back to the love of his life.’
pleading. ‘When you come home from work, I want to be kneeling right there at the door, waiting for you.’
Josh’s voice reached his ears from very far away.
Inside, the lights look dimmer, the ballroom nearly empty.
‘Say it, Harry. Look at Draco and repeat what you told me.’
At some point during that night, you manage to have some actual fun. Everyone ends up drinking way too much, but you keep to two beers. You’d rather be sober, just in case… Guernsey is in the middle of recounting a joke involving Kingsley and although you’ve listened to it three times already, it never ceases to make you laugh. You turn around, to see if he’s finding it funny too. But he’s gone, nowhere to be seen.
‘Please Draco…’
‘It’d be a torture if I didn’t touch you…’ he whispered, placing a barely-there kiss over Harry’s jaw that had the desired effect of making Harry search his mouth for more only to find nothing.
All his scenes had always been so simple. One-time only, uncomplicated, no feelings beyond a hard-on and a good time. His rules were crystal clear: there would be no dating afterwards and no repeat performances. When aftercare was done, so was Draco. Some of them had wanted more, of course. But he’d never returned the feelings. For him, there was nothing romantic about any of it.
He looks all calm and collected as he waves his wand around, setting the table neatly, like we’re a loving couple having a late night snack. It’s when he sets a plate with cookies on the table - mentioning something about Mrs Weasley having sent them - that I go crazy.
Draco turned from him. He purposely and slowly pulled Josh closer.
Draco tries to follow the logic, but gets lost. Potter brushes his hair back with one hand, the way he does when he doesn’t know what to say. It’s something he does quite a lot around Draco, now that he thinks of it.
‘You should probably tell your best friend to stop enjoying the chase. He gets off on it. He always did.’
He tugged at the leash and Harry walked in. He immediately dropped down to his knees, kneeling before the couch on the left, head bent, arms tucked behind him. Draco looked back at Josh.
He turns around and we’re so close I feel his breath on my lips. His hand curls around my neck, sweet, strong, his fingers trailing up to brush over my shaved hair.
‘What was that?’ Malfoy pinched Harry’s arse, sending sparks of pain rippling through his skin.
‘It’s not,’ Draco said very fast, over the staccato rhythm of his heart. His fingers brushed gently over the bruise. He had made that mark. He had placed it there and Harry hadn’t want to get rid of it.
‘But you don’t want them.’ He says softly. ‘You think you’re behind this wall… that no one sees you. But I see the way you look at me. There’s no wall, sometimes. I like it. I like it when there’s no wall.’
All his shyness was gone, replaced by sheer nerve.
It was only a whisper. Draco revelled in it, his lips parted in a gasp, his eyes on fire. For this hint of nearly uncontrolled fire, Harry would beg all night.
‘You think he’s in love with me?’ My question ends on a rather deranged laugh.
‘The second seems out of character. You’re not really the type to wait.’
. The War did fuck us up. It did take something from us that can’t be retrieved. But it also brought us here. It made us come back to each other all through this hellish year. The worst year… and the best one, too.
I'll shut up now. Welcome to Draco's POV.
Of course that’s what he thinks.
‘I’ve known you almost all my life,’ Draco said. ‘I can’t look away. I just can’t look away… from you. There’s no one else, because…’ Fucking hell, he was having trouble breathing. Why was this so hard? ‘There is no one else
And he’s done talking. He’s done waiting.
Harry cried out, pain shooting through him in a wonderful wave.
‘Are we doing this?’
‘I think he wants to watch us making out,’ Draco said, words hovering along Josh’s jaw.
‘Have a sit, Draco.’
I look at her, at a loss.
Draco placed the lube on his back pocket and lowered his trousers to a more comfortable position. Everything he was doing was simple and natural, but it was all building up for the moment when his cock would be opening Harry up and tearing him apart. Harry lifted his head to be able to watch the movement of Draco’s hand over his shaft. Draco looked so good like this, so in control of his own pleasure, so assured. His chest heaving, his hand slow on his cock, his eyes on Harry. God, Harry wanted to sink down on that cock, he wanted to be fucked into the leather - and he was going to be.
I open & close my mouth, then open it again.
‘Let me,’ he said, breathing hard. ‘Let me have- let me, let me suck you.’
I love this Muggle pop song,
‘Potter has gone back to his…’ She tilts her head to the side. ‘How shall I put it? Reckless Fucker Who Lived ways. Hermione’s been worried sick. He’s been to St. Mungos 3 times in the last week. And before that-’
or from those beautiful memories we once shared in a bathroom. I still have the scars to show for it, they give off a dull ache in especially cold weather. At that time, his magic felt more raw, intense, but kind of all over the place. It lacked the searing focus it has now. Like a blade made for battle, he’s been polishing it. But so have I.
I moan. My hands fall down to his hips.
You just didn’t think he was within reach and now his hands are on you. You clear your throat.
The double
Hovering, right in his line of sight. Golden-white. He lifts his wand up, stares at it. Waits for it to disappear. It’s probably just a haywire trace of magic left behind. It happens sometimes.
He seems to be searching for this word we don’t say, this word filled with impossible things. I’m here hoping and dreading that he might find it.
It starts slowly, a soft swaying, it climbs up my legs, my chest, it catches me aware of everything. Of the cold night air, of his moving body behind me, warm, of his intoxicating scent, of his breath huffing on my neck. Time falls away. There’s only dance, slow beat, Draco moving with me, not pushing, not wanting more than I’m ready to give. I take his hands and pull them around me, over the front of my jeans. That’s when I dare to open my eyes and watch his arms around me like they belong there, his tattoos stark, his fingers cupping me.
He leans over, his elbows on his knees. I get lost watching his tattoos. There it is, under the flowers. The white-stark scars of his Dark Mark. Instead of finding it repulsive, I find it brave. The way he wears it. Like it doesn’t define him anymore. I wish mine didn’t. I glance at him. He tilts his head, the strand of hair moves with it.
Wonderful freedom, don’t you think?
Harry let his head fall back against the leather, not fighting it, sinking into it. Fuck. Josh had really been thorough in telling Draco his every kink. He was going to drown in those grey eyes.
Draco?
Speaking of, I tune in just in time to hear what she came here to tell me:
‘I saw you watching. Again.’
You take some time to adjust.
The single word snaps you out of your misery.
‘You’re going with her-’ I hear myself say it, but it can’t be my voice, hollow, empty.
But that’s when he breaks eye contact, sets his glass on the counter. I recognize the finality of the gesture from watching it time and time again. He leaves right before that last drink that might tip his scale. Like he’s afraid of what he might do.
Draco felt his throat burning. He gripped the base of his cock to keep himself from coming.
‘More. Please.’
They went up the stairs to the private rooms. Josh had gotten them one of the bigger, more comfortable ones. Perks of being a regular customer, Draco mused. He seldom used the rooms these clubs offered, for he was a shameless exhibitionist. But last time with Harry he had forgotten all about the show. Time had completely lost its meaning, the world narrowing down to the point of contact between them. He wanted all that and more.
He noticed Josh was leaning over Harry, kissing his jaw, speaking to him, and Harry was murmuring something back. Draco let them say goodbye, his heart hammering somewhere on his navel, and on his fingers, and on is throat.
‘He ripped my robes. I didn’t have my wand, but I had that hex, you know, the one I used on you, but I couldn’t, I just- I felt so helpless. I couldn’t get it out. I ran, like a fucking coward-’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I want… please, come on my face. Can we do that?’
I stop dreaming of lakes.
Malfoy’s eyes changed again, becoming grey like steel, burning through him, pressing him down on the leather, his mouth twisting again into that smirk that just made Harry want to comply.
‘A cockslut like him, refusing cock so freely given?’  he asked. A sadistic laugh bubbled in his chest. It got out a second later.  ‘I don’t buy it.’
‘Say my name.’ You whisper.
Your heart feels dislodged from your chest. He gives a wry laugh.
You know he’s ready, but you keep stretching him with your tongue and again with your fingers. He arches off the bed, bites off a scream, you think of swallowing his cock like this, making him spill in your mouth, but you know what he wants and it’s not that. Your fingers slip in and out of him, there’s no resistance anymore. He’s quivering, loose, so soft, it’s like you could break him if you wanted to, but you also know you might still cut yourself on his edges. Your fingers slip out of him, he whimpers. The room is spinning around you and your movements seem slow. Your cock rubs against his hole. You slick it with another wandless spell. It’s a slow slide into him. He grabs your arms and you sink deeper. It’s maddening, the way he adjusts minutely to you. He looks up. He doesn’t say it, but you grab his wrists and press them to the bed and with that  you push deeper inside him. His mouth drops open, his breath warm on your face. He can’t touch you, but he’s spread open, like he was made to be fucked by you.
He couldn’t believe he was fucking begging for a kiss from Draco Malfoy and he couldn’t believe how hot that was, nor could he believe the effect that was having on Draco. They were teasing each other over a fucking kiss, after Harry had been cropped, caned, rimmed and sucked, and it seemed like this was
Like everything else in the world, he looks very far away. Unreal to you.
He rested his back against the couch, hoping to blend in with the background. He felt torn between wanting to remain invisible, watching everything unnoticed, and
‘He’s not wrong.’ I say, because I can.
‘I love to watch you beg, Potter,’ he said, his cock fucking his own hand, and Harry’s eager eyes on it, as Josh fucked him steadily.
‘No, not really.’ There’s surprise, but also warmth.
I'm heartwarmed from all your wonderful comments throughout this story. Thank you again for supporting my writing and enjoying this story so much!
I’m holding my head up high when I say it. I can feel the tension in my shoulders.
His smile is blinding. He laughs, I can’t breathe. I take his hand and place it there where I want it.
‘I want to taste you.’
Draco had to close his eyes abruptly. He was on freefall. Harry was moaning, helplessly now, and those broken little sounds were turning Draco on beyond reason. His hand gripped the side of the couch, his whole body tensing up with the effort to keep some sort of composure. He breathed in deeply, shutting down the sounds of the club, the slow beat of the background music, the whispers from the men commenting on the scene, the noises from other couple’s plays, but he couldn’t shut Harry out. The sounds coming out of Harry’s mouth were pure fantasy material, twisted into a reality he would never have again.
I swear
His words from before settled in a heavy, horrible knot in my chest. All I can think of is that someone hurt him, someone who’s still here, a student perhaps, someone he’s going to have to see tomorrow and everyday until the end of the year. Someone that got away with it. I have no idea what to say, all I know is that I feel sick to my stomach and angry, so angry.
It felt like walking in a dream, that moment when you know it can’t be real, but everything still looks more real than your actual life when you wake up. Draco was unaware of the people surrounding them, of the flashes of lights. His vision was tunneling down to the only thing that mattered.
. With words,’ Malfoy’s hand gripped hard at his hair, yanking his head back.
‘I don’t want to hurt you again. But they say that happens in every romantic relationship, anyway.’
Harry’s desire was a thing of evidence between them, something beyond his hard cock, jutting before him. He lowered his eyelashes and tilted his head down. His eyes levelled with Draco’s crotch. Harry bit his lip, hard, and let out a deep breath, falling down into it, surrendering.
‘Whatever you think I deserve,’ he whispered.
I have a second to realise I just made him snap. He pushes me hard against the table, and his erection presses against mine, real and warm. I lose my breath.
Draco sat up too.
‘That was fucking, Harry. Do you want me to really kiss you?’ he asked softly.
He tastes Potter’s question on his lips already.
A strangled cry went inside his mouth, Harry clutched at his shirt. From there to a kiss it was only gravity. They swapped the come between their mouths, slowly, teasingly. Draco had never wanted to do something like this before. It felt strangely right.
Long formal functions stretching into long hours of you waiting for his sign to follow him, waiting to know where he wants to have you next. Bathrooms, cloakrooms, anywhere you both can have a bit of privacy. The danger of getting caught, the secrecy of it all, the fact that no else knows you’re having him… some nights, you can’t quite believe it’s real.
As it turns out, you were wrong. That’s not the end of it. It’s more of a beginning.
His cock twitched. Harry captured it with his mouth and pulled back again.
‘Thank you, Josh,’ Harry said, voice a rasp.
‘Hi,’ he said back.
‘I’m not counting.’ I say.
‘You were made to take my cock,’ he said in wonder.
‘Like this?’ he asked. His tongue darted out and licked over the fabric, then he placed little kisses and licks along the bulge, down Josh’s bollocks.
‘You’re also waiting for something,’ he says.
I cross the room and drop down to my knees in front of him. He’s saying something but I stop listening. I take his cock in my hand. He’s hard and leaking already. I try not to think, not to cry. I’m afraid that if I dare to breathe, I’ll throw up all over his perfect shoes. There’s no telling what he would do to me then.
Your eyes dart over to his left arm. Of course, it’s still there. An ugly scar of cold-white. He doesn’t try to hide it from you. You care nothing for what’s left of the Mark. It says nothing about him anymore. But those scars on his chest, the scars you left there…
I’m never as lonely as I walk through the dark corridors of Hogwarts. I get to wander freely all over the castle; no need for my cloak anymore. Everything feels out of turn, out of place. This used to be home. It’s more of a graveyard now. All the ghosts — the real ones — are gone since the Battle. No one knows why. I didn’t know I’d miss them this much. It’s as if they left a hole.
‘I’m going to, I can’t-’
It’s too good. The way he speaks your name. The way it all feels impossible. You fuck him with slow, deep thrusts. You end up kissing him again, his hands still pressed to the mattress. He pushes up against you. You’ve never been this long inside anyone, never so aware of the slow climb towards release, never so intent on making someone lose it. You love the way he looks at you. Like he sees into you.
‘Yeah. Reckon I can.’
Harry’s eyes lit up with something akin to a challenge. There it was again. That smile, half teasing, half shy.
I know what he means.
He’s still there the next morning, lying in your rumpled sheets. He didn’t mean to, of course. You’ve seen how many extra hours he puts in at work, and you doubt he ever sleeps much. He’s as exhausted as you feel. You don’t dare to move for fear of waking him, of making him aware. Of what, you don’t even know.
‘It’s a start,’ Draco uncrossed his legs, his cock straining, trapped in his trousers.
He moans against my throat and then his cock replaces his fingers.
‘What’s the problem? You want this?’ he asked, tongue lose.
notice that before. He had just chosen to ignore it. Josh had been right. Malfoy was his type. Everything in him made Harry want to succumb. The grey eyes surveyed Harry.
‘God. Please,’ Harry groaned. He struggled to keep speaking. ‘I’ll be ready, my mouth open for you to put your cock in.’
I also realised that I was needed. He needed me. As I found my place again in the world of the living, I found out he wasn’t the only one needing me. My hands could make things. My words were enough. My mistakes did not define me. There was healing in others, if I looked closely. And I did look.
She stares back at me.
Draco never rushed his scenes. He was known to be a very patient Dom, one who quite liked to take his time. He never overlooked details, like properly hydrating his submissives. Harry looked up at him, a drop of water trailing down his jaw.
‘I’ll be right back.’
His tongue darts out to lick over your pants. You try to rub against him, to get some more friction, but his sweet hands keep you in place, pinned to the wall, and of course you already knew he would be like this.
I kiss you, two lips on two lips, two tongues and a dark openness, yours and mine. There’s the world, the space of your mouth. Two halves. My world fits there, around your tongue.
He caught the words but took longer to catch their meaning. It seemed different from any praise he’d had. This was Malfoy, calling him good and beautiful. This was his ex-childhood nemesis, holding him like a lover, taking him down to an underworld of pain and shameless pleasure and he had never known he wanted this so much. His body was throbbing in every point of connection with Malfoy’s. He realised just then that Malfoy was still hard too. He pressed back into Malfoy and this time Malfoy let him. They stood like that for some time, Harry feeling the pressure from Malfoy’s cock against his arse. He wished that Malfoy was naked, that he could feel his cock properly, his whole body, that he would be allowed to touch.
I’m feeling so vulnerable right now. I try to remove my hand, but his fingers hang on tighter. And it feels good. All this touching, in broad daylight, it’s so different from everything we’ve done before.
Heat spread on Harry’s face, but he shook his head.
‘I asked Josh to torture me for you.’
That voice… that voice was doing something to him. It was cold, demanding with a hint of care underneath. Harry felt so vulnerable, tied and naked in front of this man he had hated once, a man he’d known for years. Since the end of the War, they had been nothing but civil, passing each other several times a day in the halls at the Ministry, and talking politely. Harry knew Malfoy was a changed man. At least, he knew enough to be sure Malfoy wouldn’t go to the press with this.
You nod your yes. His hands are on your hips. He sinks deep into you.
The kiss goes on longer than the rest of the exchange.
At least, we finally have something in common.
Under his other hand, Draco felt Harry’s pulse beating wildly. This plain collar would have to do. For now, at least.
He takes a sit across me and pours the tea for us. He takes the flask and tips some drops on my tea.
You don’t exactly know what you’re doing, but your hand brushes his cheek. You pull that strand of startling blonde hair behind his ear.
‘You don’t mean that.’ He says.
‘I mean it.’
Which is buttoning down my trousers.
He lets his shirt drop on a chair. He sits, unties his shoes, takes off his socks, his trousers and his pants. He’s intent, unashamed.
‘But since you’re mine…’ Draco let the word linger between them. ‘You’d behave no matter what, wouldn’t you?’
‘What does that say about your taste in men?’ He asks.
Draco closed his fingers over the buckle, feeling the cold metal against his skin. His whole body felt on fire, except for that point of contact.
Harry did moan then, loud and desperate. The next second, Malfoy’s hands left him. Harry sobbed. The crop went down on his skin again, the leather biting oh so wonderfully down his thighs. Harry lost track of time. His whole being was on overdrive. He wanted more, more pain, more Malfoy. He felt wild with agony and want. God, he wished he could see Malfoy standing there, crop in hand, eyes demanding, the movement of his arm as he hit Harry. The pain was spreading, so that he no longer knew which parts of his body were hurting and which were aroused. Everything was pleasure and pain.
‘Such an elaborate game, Potter. Yet, you let Draco believe you're still fucking everything that moves.’
‘You’re my type too,’ Draco said, that slow smile still on his face. Harry got lost in it. ‘You’ve always been my type.’
He had Draco’s marks all over him, on his neck, and back, and thighs and he wanted them there. He wanted to see the bruises there on the next day. He didn’t want to be healed. He wanted to feel Draco on him. When he moved, every time he walked, he wanted to feel him. On his skin, inside him.
It’s as if I’ve flipped a switch. His hands come up to my hips, he grinds up & insane pleasure flares up inside me. I start to come the second he kisses me, fucking me hard & good. The kiss is endless, his mouth no longer leaves mine, I’m shaking, my orgasm ripping through me, shattering me, I stop listening, stop seeing, but his mouth is still on mine. I come up for air.
‘Fuck, Draco.’ He sighs. ‘Just hear me out. I haven’t fucked anyone else in months. Only you.’
‘He said I was shit.’
‘You. Inside my head. All the fucking time.’
He didn’t look up, eyes fixed on Draco’s silver cuff buttons, glittering under the lights of the club. He refused to be aware of his surroundings - because if he did, if he saw the men watching them, if he saw Josh, he would be unable to go on.
He felt — still feels — like liquid fire in my veins. That is why I take him late into the night with copious amounts of alcohol. You know, to ease my descent into hell, where I’m sure to be burning in the afterlife — or so the Muggle lore says.
I hate the power in his voice, the thing that keeps reminding me of exactly who he is, what he means to everyone in our world. What he will always mean to me.
‘I like it. More than like. I want you coming up to me and having me, no questions asked. Like I’m something you own for your pleasure, something you take care of because… because…’ Harry looked from his cock to him. He swallowed, looking unsure.
‘You know I can take it.’ Harry’s eyes were bright and challenging, and he bucked back harshly, impaling himself on the fingers, head dropping on the bed, his fingers curling on the sheets. ‘Him. You. All of it.’
You nearly laugh. Then you notice his hand, there.
Draco eased one of the buttons of his shirt open, and Harry’s eyes shot there, drawn up to his fingers, to the stretch of skin visible there. He let his legs fall open, his free hand coming down to rest against his thigh and sure enough Harry’s eyes darted there, then slowly moved to the visible bulge on Draco’s trousers. Draco felt himself grow harder under that stare.
He’s silent. You pay him no mind.
The cold helps me pretend I don’t want anything from him. I sit on the edge of the pavement and take out a cigarette. No one is watching me, so I light it wandlessly.
‘I always wanted to shut you up like that,’ Draco mused, aware of his cold tone, the hint of teasing just below the surface for Harry to catch on. ‘But you have to work for it, don't you think? All you did tonight was tease me… so why should I let you have my cock?’
‘Fuck. Draco…’ The way Harry said his name was delicious.
Harry made a disconcerting sound with his throat.
When I open my eyes, she’s the first thing I see. There’s a streak of white light that crosses over her face. It flashes once, twice, in tandem with the storm outside. Her red hair spills over my pillow. She sleeps naked under my sheets. Even though we’re no longer dating. No longer together. No longer
‘I’m not ashamed to be seen with you. Are you?’
Pansy laughs. Yeah, I lied. I only do it with her, because she always knows. And Potter. I lie to him too & he always knows.
I don’t think twice about what he means by that. My own hair is plastered to my face, but I know I look good anyway. I play with the seams of my jumper. Harry likes me in Muggle clothes. He likes me better without them.
It will end in heartbreak. That much is certain.
‘So dating it is.’ His hand is back on mine, over the table. ‘It will involve some arguments too. You’re gonna hate me sometimes, I’m gonna hate you too.’
I grab his arm because I can’t think of what to say.
Draco hadn’t been ready for the rush, close to an onslaught to his every emotion, he felt at Potter’s question.
‘You’re so fucking noble, Harry James Potter,’ I bite the words out, throwing them at his face. ‘I don’t want you to keep away, I fucking want you to fight for me, can’t you see it?’
‘Just tell me his name.’
I pull him down so that his lips are right there, finally. I nip slowly at his piercing. Draco gasps. Then we’re kissing. It feels inevitable, just waiting to happen. His mouth simply falls open for my tongue, and then we’re slow and purposeful. I’m struck by insanity or maybe this is the first moment of sanity in months. This is what I want. It doesn’t have to make sense.
‘Fuck,’ he said, when Harry pulled back once again. He had an apologizing look, but Draco was sure he wasn’t in the least bit sorry.
Malfoy had barely pulled back when Harry felt a stab of pain, precise and acute on his arse. His body jerked and he screamed, pain spreading as realisation hit him. The cane wasn’t something he liked every Dom to use on him. If used badly it could go very wrong, very fast. But he didn’t even had to think on it, because Malfoy was perfect… and vicious. The cane hit his arse again, sharp pain breaking over him, sending him against the leather. He cried out, no longer caring for the sounds he made because Malfoy wanted them, wanted them all out.
‘I- I just needed some air.’ He says in a faint voice. His fingers are tracing some random pattern on the dry ground. I realise he’s not smoking. Then I realise I haven’t seen him with those Muggle cigarettes in a very long time.
‘Sounds like a nice farewell,’ Josh said, lips curling in a smile. ‘But what about you?’
‘So sorry to disturb what must surely be an otherworldly shag with Our Saviour. Did he tell you he likes to fuck around with pretty blondes?’
Draco Malfoy.
Instead he drops his forehead to mine, lips sliding soft & sweet over mine. He breathes me in & I’m shaking, his stubble rubbing my cheek & then his mouth covers mine. It isn’t like any other kiss. It is slow, drawn out of me like something I would never let show, but can’t stop. I moan inside his mouth & he answers me with a strangled groan. It is wrong, so wrong, to kiss him like this. My hands are now free to cradle his face. My fingers brush his hair. I wanted sex, I wanted surrender, I wanted him to overpower me, to make me feel like I can’t escape him, like I’m not in control & he has done it, but it’s all wrong. He’s giving me the sort of kiss that drifts into smaller, much more dangerous kisses. It’s the sort of kiss shared between lovers. Every time he eases back he looks at me with those haunted eyes, scared & hopeful.
‘Seven and a half months, give or take.’ I shrug. ‘If you care to know.’
His friends come and go. I know their faces too. They’re paler and sadder and older and still I know them. Somehow, they know mine too. They talk in low voices, put their hands on his arm, ask things that get silent nods in answer.
There are forty five indents carved on the door. It makes no sense that the Golden Boy lives in a house tainted with so much darkness, a house that links him to my family even. Or maybe it does. Few people know this about the Chosen One, but the truth is: there’s something dark about him. Something that makes him all too eager to be hit by curses and hexes. Something that makes him come look for me when he’s battered and bleeding to death. And it’s not just his fucking hero complex. The War left its mark on him, just as it did with me.
Me and the ghosts, we move into his house. We settle on a nice routine. We talk everyday, I never sleep alone. Me and the ghosts, I mean. They got tangled on my hair, plastered on my skin. I’d carry them everywhere if I was going anywhere. As it is, we just settle on sitting for days on his couch.
I go around the table and pick up my jumper from the floor. He’s there in an instant, his hand on my wrist.
It’s the exact word that he uses.
And I want, I want, I want. I rise with it, my whole being drawn out.
Malfoy sucked on his skin, hard and long, and the sounds he made were heaven for Harry, so his mouth kept begging, non-stop now.
He’s wrong. It’s a lot. A whole
‘They’re… old.’ I say. My voice sounds weird.
My hand shoots for his arm. It’s now the only thing between him and the lake.
My days are spent at Hogwarts, helping with the reconstruction. I keep waiting for him to show up there. But he never does. He comes here every night and watches me. I have this feeling I’m the only reason he’s even here. It’s certainly part of what keeps me dancing and turning down all these blokes who can’t keep their hands off of me. Speaking of… There’s this bloke running his hands over my chest, his half-hard cock pressing against my arse. Potter watches us and I notice how his shoulders tense, his back straightens, his hand tightens around the glass. His eyes eat me alive. I don’t look away as I take the stranger’s hands, placing them over the bulge in my jeans. I’m not hard yet, but with Potter looking at me like that, I will be.
I’m about to stand up and make good on it when he says:
means the Manor.
‘Like- fine, forget I said it. The Headmistress would-’
‘Not you, Draco. How long has this been going on?’
(See the end of the chapter for
I stare at them and still I have no words. As we’re walking together to the Great Hall, Hermione leans close to me and whispers:
He’s clearly babbling now. Of course he’d be the type of person who babbles. I just never thought that he would with me.
Draco’s mind was on overdrive. He couldn’t quite believe this. How could someone have Harry and be so willing to let him go? But if that was what Harry wanted, how could anyone care about him and not do it? He knew he would. That was exactly what he had done last time.
‘He had fucking nice hair,’ I repeat. My voice goes up a notch in the quiet kitchen. ‘Tidy, nothing like yours!’
I don’t know if hearts can heal. But I believe they’re patchwork.
‘Did that piece of furniture offend your sensibilities, Potter?’ I ask, trying to catch my breath.
‘She said you’d say that. It’s true, Draco. I’m so fucking in love with you, I don’t want to hide it. I want you to know, I want everyone to know. I should have just said it, not write it on a sign. Will you go on a date with me?’
‘You okay?’ Draco asked.
He smelled the leather first. Then he felt it, cold and thin, against his back. There was silence. The crop hit his arse with sharp precision. The pain took him away from the world. He was brought back by another smack on the same spot, acute on his heated skin. He was used to a quick session of cropping, before the dominant decided on another part of his body to torture. Nothing came for a while, he just felt his skin burning up, his ears straining to know where Malfoy was, his heartbeat loud.
‘I want to,’ he said, heat spreading up his neck. ‘Maybe with lots of lube and… go slow at first, please?’
I notice the flicker of surprise in his eyes.
Draco’s left eyebrow shoots upward of its own accord.
He doesn’t turn to look. You stare at his lonely back, down the long line of his black-cladded legs. Muggle formal clothes. He never wears robes to these things and you find it intriguing, strange. You always thought of him as one to follow proper etiquette.
Harry kissed the tip, then sucked at the head, lips red and wet, all the while his eyes on Draco. His hands cupped Josh’s bollocks. He was so putting on a show for Draco. Draco felt his pulse quicken, his lips stretching more into his Dom smile.
‘I said I’m fine.’ I repeat. ‘I’m fine, I’m fine, I’m fine.’
He takes my hand, puts it over his thigh, makes it climb all the way up. There’s a drum of need underneath, I can feel it beating, wild, wild. But there’s time. We have time.
You feel a sudden calm. You unbutton your collar and sit down on your sofa.
‘You never dance,’ he says with an ease we never had with each other. His voice sounds different too. Rough and sweet. There’s no snark in it. ‘You never pull anyone and turn down everyone that tries to chat you up. You always leave alone.’
You’re both good at keeping away from things that might make this too complicated. You show him to your room.
‘Er- thanks. I- don’t- know- it’s really-’
I think he knows. Because he looks very serious.
There was a heavy weight sitting on Draco’s chest, making it difficult for him to breathe properly. Potter was so fucking beautiful it hurt. Draco felt those eyes piercing him, his whole body heated, throbbing, his cock inevitably half-hard. He gripped the glass like a lifeline, emptied it, and signaled the bartender for a refill, even if he knew the wine would not help him keep a clear head.
A week goes by. Two. I don’t go back to the club. I call in sick & get a leave of absence, so I don’t have to cross paths with him at the Ministry. I don’t answer his calls. Or his Firecalls. I refuse every one of his owls, without even opening the envelopes, simply burning them to ashes. For good measure, I also avoid everyone else. I don’t leave my house. I ignore Pansy & Blaise. They know me far too well, it would only take them one good look at me to know the full truth. I drink. A lot. I start as soon as I wake up & keep going, easing the days away. I take every numbing potion I can get my hands on. I stay as intoxicated as I can, as far away from reality as I can.
‘Harry…’ Draco swallowed, shadows playing across his face. ‘You were… so good. More than. You were everything. The best I’ve ever had,’ his hands were as gentle now as they’d been strong, demanding and cruel before.
‘It’s just sex, Pans.’
‘I'm with Potter. Really, I'm fine.’
‘Romantic relationship.’ I repeat after him, like I have run out of all my previously extensive vocabulary.
No one else notices any of it. Hermione and Ron are already taking their seats beside Draco. His pale face shows nothing at all as he makes an almost imperceptive movement with his wand to clean the mess away. Cool, impassive.
‘There’s something else he wants,’ Potter’s voice is a whisper.
Gravity can’t be defied. Even with magic, it can only be fought off temporarily. In the end, it always wins.
I ring the doorbell and count the idents on his old door. I’m purposefully not thinking of him. It’s 3 a.m. Maybe he has someone warming his bed. He must have. Maybe he’s not even in. Maybe he’s sleeping on another bed. With another. I can still go back to my apartment, take a hungover potion and Sleeping Draught and sleep myself into another day. No one will have to know of this momentary lapse in judgement. No one will have to know that on the first night in  months that I go out to pull, I leave the bar where I’m supposed to be dancing and grinding against nameless men and instead come here. Pansy can’t know. She already thinks I’m a hopeless case.
‘I loved your little show, Harry,’ he said, and knew his voice was warm, but with a stinging bite to it.
So self-assured.
Since we’re back at Hogwarts, we barely said a word to each other. Not that he speaks much to anyone these days. He doesn't seem to have any friends besides his usual two. They always look worried around him and that's probably why he's spending less and less time with them.
‘Kiss me,’ Draco said. He didn’t know where it came from, that tone that was both an order and a request.
It’s why I dance.
‘Buy me a drink and I put out, is that it?’ I say in my best bored tone, even as I pick up the glass and give the golden-bronze liquid a swirl.
There’s no doubt in my mind that she means every word. But something about what she’s just said hits closer to home.
You decide to sit on his bed and take off your clothes. You’re not self-conscious about the way you look, but you’re so thoroughly aware of his eyes on you, you’re shaking a bit.
I let him tug at my hand, drag me through a throng of sweaty bodies, pull me up against a bathroom stall, wandlessly bolt the door & effortlessly go down on his knees. That’s when I sober up fast to find myself standing on a ledge about to leap, free falling into the abyss of deep, deep green eyes.
‘Fuck. You’re gorgeous,’ Draco could not keep the words from spilling out, nor could he keep his hands away from Harry now that he was touching him. His finger curled around the O-ring and he pulled Harry down on his cock.
‘Fuck you, Potter. Fuck everyone. The whole world. Wizard. Muggle. I just want everyone to fuck the hell off.’
I start after him. The night, the cold, the lake and him, walking fast and always alone.
‘If I want to,’ Draco repeated, tasting the words on his mouth. Tasting the possibility. ‘Do you have any idea how you make me feel?’
Draco tugged at his own cock, with slow purpose.
We’ve been mending, me and him, no ghosts. I didn’t leave them that day I found the color back in his eyes. But I did leave them later on.
‘You think insulting me is going to make your case?’
It means more to me than I want you or I think I’m falling for you. I think he gets it.
‘You weren’t in the room,’ I say, unnecessarily.
going for his cock.
Harry’s arms came up freely around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer and he forgot everything. He forgot about the War and the night terrors he still had, he forgot about his daily routine of fighting evil, he forgot about the club, the late nights at bars, the dates gone wrong, the feeling that his life was going nowhere and was always more of the same, day after day, until he was driven under by someone, the only meaningful part of his weeks. But he also forgot about those someones, those other nights. There was only Draco’s taste, mingled with his own. A long moan was coming out of his mouth into Draco’s, he felt drunk on Draco’s taste and scent and his tongue dared out of his mouth, searching Draco’s. He was allowed in.
It’s been years. I thought I’d get used to the feeling. But the ring gets me all the time and he knows it. His hand travels on the table, in a seemingly random motion, but his sleeve rubs against mine for the hundredth time that night and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s deliberate.
‘He wanted to. I said no. We went our separate ways. That’s when I—’
It’s the first time in months I let anyone touch me.
At that moment, Draco knew that sucking cock was the single most important thing in the world for Harry Potter. And it was only because Draco wanted it.
And I simply know what he’s about to say even before he says it. I know it with the same certainty that made me go to him after that horrible night. The same certainty that told me that I was safe with him. That he would never hurt me. That certainty washes over me.
You nod your agreement, quite suddenly thankful to her, even if you don’t exactly know why. Ron gives you a contrary look, but you lose track of the conversation.
He runs to the lake intent on ending his life. It’s not something he’s given much thought to. It feels fitting.
Potter doesn’t have to. He doesn’t even need this, whatever this is. The buying of drinks, the sweet talking me, the questioning touches that really are more on the side of affirmative. And the worst is, he knows. He knows I’m deflecting, playing difficult. He is plainly aware of it & he also knows that I hate him for it.
I nod. I like that he’s not apologising. I don’t know why, but it makes me feel relieved. I feel like I’ve spent all my life apologising for every wrong thing I did. For every mistake, even mistakes that preceded me, even mistakes I wasn’t able to avoid. Somehow, he seems to get that sorry is a loaded word between us.
‘That was nothing.’
That night they’d had together… Draco had been completely sure Potter would say no, once he’d revealed his identity. Any other man would be discouraged at best, disgusted at worse, at the idea of being submitted to his once childhood bully. Draco had entertained the idea of not telling him who he was, of course he did. Part of him had wanted to withhold that information. Take what he wanted, what was
Malfoy’s eyes flickered to his cock, the smirk playing again on his lips.
‘No kidding,’ he grinned and signaled Draco to follow him.
‘What if darkness is where we truly belong?’ he asks.
‘We’re not having sex,’ he says. There’s that stubborn look in his eyes. He’s going for what’s right instead of what’s easy. ‘Not like this. You’re drunk.’
It all stops for a beat.
I thought you liked it up ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
on Malfoy’s lips set his body on fire. He gasped, his body shaking. Malfoy’s fingers wrapped suddenly around his cock. Harry cried out.
. He felt defenseless against it, but the really weird thing was: he didn’t care. You could beat an
Our lips part, his hand climbs up to my face. Everything is warm. He touches that strand of my hair again, like he needs to make sure it’s real.
It’s as if someone has turned up the noise. Around me there’s movement, people, but all of my vision tunnels to Flannagan. I’m seeing red.
Not ten minutes later, you're dropping face down on your own bed.
I give her my best smile, even if smiling is the last thing I feel like doing right now.
just about sums it up.
There’s mischief in the way he smiles. I can’t believe I’m on the other side of that smile, that it's directed to me. The grey does pop. Draco looks so good, my chest hurts. I never liked anything this much.
Harry bit back a curse. If Draco wasn’t so attuned to him, he would have missed it. Draco stared down at him, an eyebrow raised inquiringly. For a moment it seemed like Harry wasn’t going to elaborate further. Then he took a deep breath. His jaw unclenched.
‘I noticed you, noticing me…’ Malfoy went on, his hand moving on Harry’s cock. Stroking him, but so slowly it was downright torture. His fingers smoothed along Harry’s length, silky and soft.
‘He would be a fool to reject you.’
‘I didn’t know-’ He swallows, hard. ‘You fuck with my head too.’
‘What I mean is- We’re over. Like, really over.’
He is so… hard.
What I do next, never even crossed my mind.
Harry opened his mouth and closed it. A whole silent minute passed between them.
You laid on your back and watched him summon his wand and make the cleaning spells on the both of you with his usual efficiency. He then accioed his pack of cigarettes from the living room. He caught it with one hand and you watched him light one cigarette with slow purpose. This time, he didn’t offer you one.
‘Well, yes. He’d be more of one. Plus, he’d make an enemy out of me for the rest of his miserable life.’
Draco gripped the base of Harry’s cock and stood back, his mouth releasing Harry’s cock with a pop. He looked unkempt, his hair a bit disheveled, his breath heaving. Harry wished he could bury his hands in that hair and mess it up properly.
, heart kicking wild against my ribs. The bright spot of light falls over Potter’s face. Black hair a mess, shuttered eyes, the rise and fall of a pyjama covered chest. He is asleep right next to me. I listen to his slow breath, a contrast to the hard grip he has around his wand. He holds it over the covers, ready.
A rush of blood to his cock, his arms, his chest. Trust Potter to say the most pathetic thing right in the middle of a play. Trust Draco to feel on fire just from it.
‘It’s better when I’m here.’
‘You seem to be under the impression that I’m going to take your advice on my sex life-’
‘Go on.’
Somehow my hand has come back to the table and my fingers are mere inches away from his. We don’t move any further.
‘You know I do… but you’re the one with the fancy clothes,’ he said, his fingers on Draco’s shirt buttons. He shuffled closer to Draco, his arms around Draco’s neck. ‘Was just taking care of you.’
His voice is even, soft, it washes over you and for a second you imagine it on your ear, slow and sweet, making you do things.
bucking on the bed, his lips falling open in a gasp. Josh gripped at his hair and lifted his head up, so he would face Draco.
I refuse to look at Potter, but somehow I know he’s smiling at me.
He pulled Harry up and walked them over to the couch, pushing Harry to straddle him. They took some time adjusting, until they were comfortable enough, Harry with his legs around Draco. After a while, Draco had the glasses filled up with water and handed one to Harry. They both drank, Harry looking at him with soft eyes. The glasses were set on the table again.
‘Hey Parkinson,’ I say, my voice dry.
You nod. He takes the glasses off your face, sets them at the coffee table. He feels different tonight. More real. He kisses you first. You’re both fully clothed and it’s still the most erotic thing you ever done. You kiss until you’re both hard and you’re panting on his ear, about to beg him to fuck you. He smiles against your mouth and kisses you hard, deeper, grinding against you. He’s warm, delicious, he lets you touch him everywhere as you kiss. He clings to you and you want to believe that he needs this as much as you do. That he needs you. You break the kiss and search his eyes. They’re soft grey, clearer around the edges, bright in the dimmed lights of your living room. You think he might look away any time now, but he doesn’t. You lift your hand and touch his jaw. You can’t stop yourself from following the lines of his face, letting your hand be scratched by his stubble. You’re about to say something very stupid. You know this thing between you and him is against all odds, against all probability, really. You don’t tell any of your friends because you know what they’d say. It makes no fucking sense.

He set the wand on the table and let his hands drop to his thighs, watching as Josh started working Harry open with his fingers. Draco couldn’t see what he was doing, but he saw exactly what he wanted.
‘You are delirious if you think I’m wearing those,’ I say and pull the covers over my naked body, closing my eyes and letting my head sink into the pillow. The bed smells of him.
‘Hey,’ his voice breaks off, like he hasn’t used it in a while.
He takes one step forward, his fingers flex uncomfortably at his sides. He looks at the lonely cup of tea on the table. Then at you again.
‘I think it’s because you want it so badly. It scares you.’  I say this in a rush. I regret it instantly, but the damage is done.
It begins way before that kiss.
Dear readers, this chapter was very hard to write. It’s one of the heaviest things I’ve wrote. It’s also a very triggering scene, so please check the end notes for content warning and/or notice the tags I added. Take care and keep safe*
‘Nothing,’ he whispered. He couldn’t really say what was on his mind, without sounding like a fucking teenager with a crush. A crush on his Dom for the night. Really, that was ridiculous.
I cross my arms over my chest. I’m not letting his all too innocent look stop me from addressing this.
‘You already think he’s a fool.’
A little light. By the door.
On the streets, he walks coolly and resolutely. He turns left, then left again and you realise he’s going to the Apparition point closest to where you are. Expectation sits in the back of your throat.
Now that you won’t have it, you realise you were only here for the faint chance of going home with him. Your mouth has a bitter taste. The witch he was talking to is deep in conversation with Hermione. Maybe he left with someone else. He didn’t try to catch your eye like usual.
‘Thank you for the tea. It was what I needed.’
The words work like a spell. His eyes turn to a darker grey, your lips part and your hands fall down at your sides. Slowly, methodically, efficiently he unbuttons your shirt all the way down. You have no doubt he’s done this countless times before: undressed helpless, willing men in this same living room, and they probably let him do anything. You can’t quite understand the direction of your thoughts, but then you’re already half naked and he’s dropping your shirt on a nearby chair.
He watched in awe as Malfoy’s lips curled up, his eyes alight, his hand tensing on the cane.
Then he drops to the floor, kneeling there, right in front of you.
Standing under the rain he is like a ghost. A spectral thing.
‘He's the one who needs to be drunk out of his mind to say yes to me- He hates that he wants me for a fuck. I'm just giving him one more reason to.’
- with just one word from Draco.
He considers you for a moment.
‘You think I’ve been with other people? There’s nobody, Draco. There hasn’t been.’
He was coming into Draco Malfoy’s mouth the second those lips latched around his cock. His mouth opened in a deep silent cry. He wasn’t surprised with the fact that his voice was gone. His body jerked violently, his arms shuddered against the restraints. Draco’s fingers gripped him hard and Harry was coming, eyes shot open, his body taut, his cock hitting the back of Draco’s throat, spunk shooting out of him. Draco drank him down, eyes drifting closed, like he was in another world entirely, a world made of Harry’s taste. And Harry’s whole world was Draco and the mouth around his cock, drinking him down to the last drop, taking everything he was.
Then his hands are on each side of my face and he kisses me again, I’m half naked, and I feel tears gather behind my eyes. I don’t let them out, instead I press my body against his, my hands on his waist, I trace his hipbones, I push his pants down. He’s cold, my hands cup his arse. We don’t rush, we’re not even hard yet. I want him with something more than my cock, this was never about the sex, the sex is something that happens because I want to be close to him, and this is the only way I get to have him.
I’m fine. I am fine. I am fucking fine.
Draco Malfoy is standing in the doorway and his hair is dyed a startling, magnetic, deep… blue.
‘Oh, spare me the judgement, Pans,’ I finally manage to sit down on the sofa. I pull a pillow over my lap, hugging it for comfort. I try for a dignified, even if slightly deranged look. ‘It’s not like you don’t enjoy them as much as I do.’
I dare to turn around and face him. He’s slightly taller than me. That means I have to lift my hand up to his neck. I trace it lightly, then my fingers brush his shaved hair.
Josh moved, pushed, sank. Harry clenched his hands on Draco’s, a deafening silence before the plunge and then Josh was coming. Harry lifted his head up to look at Draco as he took it, and he screamed, his body trembling and collapsing on the bed, under Josh.
@ratherbehere, you're going to make an amazing editor for sure. This was a rollercoaster, your help was invaluable. Thank you for all your inputs, your honesty, your difficult questions, your thoroughness, you long emails. You kept me focused and sharp during all this months.
You walk towards him, not knowing what you’ll say or do when you get there.
He knows what’s best for you, Harry… you need rest, and healing, and he’s going to give you that, and hold you all night long, you’ll be safe. You were wonderful tonight. More than I could have hoped for.’
His hands tighten on his lap. They’re scratched everywhere. He fought to get away.
Draco’s hand twitched over his own trapped cock and that was when he knew he’d reached his threshold.
of it. More of Malfoy...
Draco reaches Potter’s desk, bottles up the ink. Then, he straightens the piles of files. A frame is dropped face down on the desk. He lifts it up. The Golden Trio smiles up at him. Granger and Weasley on either side of Potter. They’re all laughing, scarves blowing in the wind. Wide green eyes jump right at him. He puts the frame face down again and steps back.
‘Fucking fantastic,’ he said, angling Harry up just so his cock could sink in deeper. Then he was fully seated inside Harry. They both stopped, awaiting instructions.
‘Tell me what you’re thinking, Harry.’
He looks up and his mouth opens and closes, tight, around the tip of your cock. It’s warm and perfect, the right kind of pressure. His tongue does wonderful things there, finding your sweet spot. Your pants feel damp, you wonder if he’s going to take them off or make you lose it like this. He’s clearly not in a hurry to finish you off. He takes his time sucking you through the fabric, looking up at you, molten silver eyes, that strand of wild hair brushing his face. There’s no warning, no build-up. Your body tenses, your mouth hangs open in a silent scream and you come in your pants.
His face was burning with embarrassment. He usually begged to be fucked, sucked, spanked. But not this. Josh was the only man he usually kissed and inside the club he’d never wanted other men to kiss him. Until now. He was desperate for Draco’s mouth on his, desperate to know what it was like to be kissed by those lips that had been rimming him, sucking him, talking dirty to him, ordering him around, he wanted to know if they were demanding also on his mouth, he wanted that vicious tongue breaching him, leaving no place inside him untouched.
‘All those front covers-’
I find my own voice, or sort of.
He couldn’t stop the smile on his face as Harry preened under his stare, and proceeded to suck gently on Josh’s bollocks. Josh’s pressed his hips up, his breathing clearly altered. Harry reached the hem of his pants and tugged at them with his teeth, careful and slow, pulling them down. It took three gentle pulls and Josh’s willingness lifting his hips and finally Josh’s cock jutted out, smacking Harry on the face. Harry looked from it to Draco, with a shy smile.
Harry could not breathe, could not think, his heart hammering on his throat, his body taut and he was hard again, his cock pressing against Draco’s stomach, needy and properly ignored, as Draco kept drilling into him, fast, hips snapping against his arse, sending jolts of pain and pleasure all over him. Draco Malfoy’s fuck was relentless. Harry screamed, feeling Draco’s cock drag inside him, battering at his prostate.
‘Someone’s been paying attention.’
‘I thought you’d like to watch the Christmas lights with me,’ he gestures to the square.
‘Josh did tell me I’m your type,’ he said slowly. Cautiously.
‘Hand me a collar, Josh,’ Draco said, and lifted his left hand.
You swallow.
It seems we both want to die.
He flexed his fingers over Harry’s neck, easing the pressure just enough to allow Harry to speak.
‘Draco looks better than all of those poor things you drag after you.’ Parkinson swallows her Martini in one go. ‘Mess around with those surrogates and leave the real deal alone.’
I never knew he wanted me like this. We’re on the bed now, kissing among the clothes and the books, a whole mess around us. He’s on top of me, moving, sunlight catching on his throat. His blue hair brushes my cheek. He smells like Summer and impossible things.
The thought eased itself softly into Draco’s mind. The fucking bastard. What the hell was he doing, opening his mind up like that, lowering all defences?
The first time it happens, we don’t kiss. In fact, we don’t even speak to each other.
‘Yes,’ he wanted to scream the answer, but it came out as a gasp.
He stands up, stark naked and so hard.
The irritation he felt was hampered by the spark of adrenaline - more like twisted
‘Polyamory. Blaise’s a big fan. He’d kill me if he heard me right now. Something about the word fan being completely inadequa-’
‘Means you own me,’ Harry said.
. Without him, you can’t sleep.
‘What else?-’
She gives me a smile that could rival the Cheshire cat’s. Wonder if she knows who that is.
I can’t think. There’s this scary depth in him, I want to dive in.
I’m in so deep that I barely notice that he’s stopping, turning me around, coming up above me. He looks like a fucking god. A debauched, gorgeous, gay god, swollen mouth & wet lips, a teasing smile under dark green eyes. A hard cock nudging against my hip. He leans over me. His breath tastes of me.
‘You’re doing so good, Harry,’ Draco said, and he didn’t mean to, it just came out.
Malfoy gives her a wide smile. It lights up the night.
‘Not impossible.’
‘I’m not that cheap, Potter.’ I add, filling in the charged silence.
He has spent half an hour kissing me everywhere. On the nape of my neck. Over my clavicule. On the place where my hips meet my thighs, then on the place my thighs meet my arse. On the inside of my thighs. On the inside of my fucking elbows. Behind my knees. On my armpits, for fucks sake. I never knew anyone who got off on that, but he seems to like it, the same way he seems to like kissing me anywhere. Except on my mouth. He saves that for later.
There’s a swirl, then he’s looking at a street he doesn’t recognize. But the light seems to know where they’re heading. It flickers more excitedly now, then circles around his head. He eyes it suspiciously. But he can’t keep it up for too long. There’s something about this light. Something that does not make sense, something that shouldn’t be happening. Unexpected. He wants to know.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hair, gave it a tug and forced his cock down his throat. Harry’s eyes watered. Draco pulled Harry’s head back and rubbed his cock over Harry’s tongue and then it was so easy, almost like letting go, allowing the inevitable, dropping free from the sky.
to fuck him,’ he said with no preamble.
Harry held his gaze for a moment, breath fast and stuttering, desire climbing up his neck, his face, his mouth. Draco eased the pressure on the collar, and Harry lowered his eyes, bent his head, in waiting.
‘You're still shit in my book. Why would you let him think you don't care?’
Harry looked up, eyes bright.
There was a sharp intake of breath. The green eyes were intent on Draco.
‘You sure?’ she asks.
Draco was speaking over him, his voice uneven, as he thrust again inside Harry, breaking away any resistance he might had. Harry stopped thinking, his hole clenching and releasing around Draco’s cock, and he was being filled up so good he wanted to cry. He let Draco have his way with him, his every thrust taking him apart.
Merlin, he looks so shy but there’s that defiance in there too, that says he’s going to do it. I whirl him around, my chest to his back, my hands setting on his arms to steady him. I close my eyes.
‘So… ground rules,’ he said.
I miss him like he’s already gone.
The three of them walked to the end of the room. Josh paused at the reception desk to lift a key. Draco held the leash in his hand, and didn’t look once at Harry, trailing obediently behind him, naked but for the collar. He knew every eye in that club was on Harry, on his naked body, on his perfect posture, his perfect ruddy cock. Well, too bad they weren’t going to have him. Or it.
‘Clearly it hasn’t. Have you told him?’
‘You look so cute in red,’ he whispers. And then he turns me over and brings his mouth down over mine.
Harry was drowning, so tired, his body on shutdown, and Draco’s touch was everything… Draco was still his whole world… it felt wrong to say goodbye. He closed his eyes just for a minute. When he opened them, he was alone with Josh.
Content Warning: please notice that this chapter deals with the rape events that happened before. There's a description of what happened (not extremely graphic, but actions are named for what they were). It's made in the context of a loving and supportive conversation. Please take care*
Reality will be resuming shortly.
‘Ran out of new boys to fuck?’ My tone is mild. I’m surprised at how cool and composed I sound after all these weeks of losing my shit.
I don’t tell him I already am.
He just starts unzipping my pants. Cold sweat breaks at my temple. My entire body tenses, like I’m in a full body-bind and can’t get rid of it. He’s saying something to me but I can’t make out the words. It’s like my whole mind is foggy, and the only coherent thought is my wand, I need to reach it.
And finally, @chibaken. This story is for you. Your passion for this story got me back to writing it. The fact that you made a rec of it on your Tumblr brought me so many new readers. Since we're apparently drarry soulmates (as in my kink is your kink and your kink is my kink), I really hope you love the conclusion of this story. Million thanks for all your amazing comments and general sweetness.
But there’s a bite to his tone. He’s mad at you for ruining the moment. You’ve been meaning to have this conversation before, you just didn’t know how to start.
‘Why don’t you just leave?’ I’m screaming at him, voice clipping high, shattering too. I can barely see, my face feels all wet. ‘It’s not your fucking problem-’
I beg him. I’m begging him, even though this can’t be my voice, this sobbing, horrible, keening sound, pleading, pleading with him.
I’m staring at my half-finished drink when I recognize the cold cheeky voice, right before my eyes land on a pair of high heels like a red menace.
All the people who commented on the first chapter... Your comments are *the reason* this second and last chapter exists. Without that, I'd have given up and left it as it was. I thought I would be unable to surpass what I did on the first, and you made me press through. Your excitement about this BDSM love story is what kept me believing in myself, is what made me able to get Draco and Harry to the happy ending they deserve.
Moments later, he watched Josh refusing yet another man. This one was even blond, tall, lean, exuding confidence. Harry did not even turn his head to give the man a once-over. Draco lifted the glass to his lips, the dry, white wine sweet and sour on his tongue. The liquid slid down his throat and it reminded him of Harry’s come. He wanted a taste of it again. The best spunk he’d ever had. He wanted to take that cock in his mouth and make Harry forget his perfect obedience, spill every drop, unauthorized. Then he wanted to punish him for it, so, so badly.
‘I fixed it,’ he says, with a brief, shy smile.
Truth was a sweet thing. He breathed in Harry’s slow, tender gasp.
‘You always look so tense… you know… at work,’ Harry said, his eyes intent on Draco’s cock, but still he didn't move to touch it. He licked his lips instead.
I’m hard against him. He feels it too, against his groin. I can almost taste the fight in him. He clenches his jaw, his hand curls at his side.
‘Think you can take it, Harry?’ Draco asked, seeking more of that wild defiance he loved. ‘It’s not too much for you, is it?’
Have I told you're even hotter now that you're a dad?
looking at him, or was Draco
Josh wasn’t implying it, but still Draco felt something tip on his scale.
No, those were the least of his problems. The reality, that surpassed even his imagination, was much worse. Most people were protective of their feelings, most people would bolt them away and only show them to others they deeply trusted. Most people would be too afraid of getting hurt. Harry Potter
Potter is far from stupid, but there is no way in hell he came to this beautiful conclusion without some help from the only other person who actually knows I have feelings.
He didn’t know honesty could be a kink, but it felt much like one. Everything Harry said was like a fucking drug to Draco. Magic thrummed on his skin. A twist of his fingers would tie Harry up. Another would suffocate him. Yet another would have his hole ready and dripping. They just needed the privacy. The time. And he could have both.
‘Someone promised me dinner. I’m wondering if he’s going to keep the promise.’ Draco glances at Potter. They’re very close, their arms touching.
He looks earnest, almost solemn. He knows what I mean. He knows what’s at stake. He’s known it since all of this began.
‘Yes,’ Harry whispered.
And now here I am, wishing my answer had been my first try:
‘It pays to have slayed a Dark Lord.’
‘Leave my family out of this.’ I snap.
‘Please,’ Harry murmured, swaying forward, his lips skimming over Draco’s palm.
Draco was vaguely aware of Josh grabbing the lube from a nearby table, dripping some on two of his fingers and lifting them up to show him. He nodded his agreement, but his focus was on Harry and on his question.
He actually laughs at that. My first instinct is to be mad at him. But I quickly realise it’s a bewildered laugh. Like the thought had never crossed his mind.
Her fancy black-rimmed glasses make her look like a wicked bird of prey, which I find to be a fair warning to anyone crossing her path. Too bad her best friend doesn’t come with the same kind of warnings up front. Not that those would ever work on me. My decades-long addiction to one Draco Malfoy won’t budge either way.
Draco glanced at Josh, who had cleaned himself up and was back next to them, his shirt now hanging loose around his shoulders, his skin bright with sweat and sex.
‘I wasn’t talking about your proclivities for Firewhisky, Draco.’ She eyes the table, the several open flasks. ‘Or your preference for recreational use of potions, although this-’ She waves her hand.
‘How does he feel, Josh?’
You’re not the father of a Hufflepuff?
Harry closed his eyes in bliss, but he was still aware of Draco, of the leash connecting them. It was all in the way he sucked Josh. He was doing it for Draco, his head placed just so Draco could see everything, his legs parted as Draco ordered, his tongue working Josh so perfectly he had him lifting his hips from the couch to sink into his mouth, lips stretching around the girth.
Draco dropped to his knees. He put his hands over the sheets, palms up.
My stomach clenches.
Something personal: I'm 3 years into therapy and my therapist is amazing. So is Mirna, but Harry doesn't know it yet. :)
to my engagement.
‘I might not be your cup of tea. But we both know I'm your 10th shot of Firewhisky.’
Draco grabbed his hair in a tight grip and then he bit so hard at his neck that Harry stopped seeing, he was almost fainting and Draco grunted and came inside him, drilling into him, Harry’s hole clenching hard around his cock, seemingly trying to suck Draco in. His body was pliable and abused and drunk on pain and pleasure, and his hole was dripping with Draco’s come, hot and wet.
Josh knew Harry loved to be handed over to other men - carefully picked by Josh, according to their mutual taste. He went willingly, Josh watched the whole thing and made sure no boundaries were crossed. He knew all of Harry’s hard limits and set them beforehand with the other men. Then Josh watched. He loved to watch Harry being spanked, flogged and fucked. By the end of the night he always brought Harry home and fucked him on his bed, slow and hard. Harry was pretty happy with how everything worked with them. He wasn’t in love with Josh, nor was Josh with him and that was what made it so simple and wonderful, really. They had a D/s relationship, they had sex sometimes, and that was it. Their arrangement had been going on for over a year and it provided the much needed release Harry wanted. Inside the club he wasn’t famous Harry Potter, or an Auror, he was just Josh’s plaything, his fucktoy. And whomever’s Josh chose to spank and fuck him any given night.
He stops suddenly and turns back so fast you almost fall into him. His hand catches your arm.
‘Yeah.’ You say.
He captured Harry’s mouth in a slow, tender kiss.
Potter blushes intensely. I can’t stop my lips from twitching up in a smile.
Harry was trapped under Draco’s body and it felt like heaven and hell all wrapped into one. He lifted his hips up, Draco’s cock sliding deeper inside.
‘I did it.’ I say, savagely. My stomach clenches, something is burning through it, ripping me apart. ‘I’m the only one to blame.’
‘Just one?’
Malfoy is by the counter, speaking to a tall witch with a snake tattoo curling around her wrist. You think she’s an Unspeakable too, but you only saw her once before. They don’t call it the Department of Mysteries for nothing, Ron usually says. The fact that you don’t know what Malfoy does when he’s not fucking you, leaves you in a mist of curiosity and uneasiness. He is good at his work, that much you know from Hermione. You’ve seen him do wandless magic like it’s nothing at all. You love the feeling of his magic on you, but that’s the kind of thinking that doesn’t get you anywhere. Right now, he looks completely enthralled in conversation with that witch. You want to know what interests him so. Out of bed, he never talks to you. It makes you feel like a fucktoy; maybe he doesn’t think you have anything interesting to say. You feel way out of his league, so it’s probably for the best. You force yourself to look away, to focus on something else.
It’s the same.
He’d stood on the edge that night, testing gravity, defying it, daring it.
‘’Gosh, Draco,’ he laughs, but even with my back to him I can tell it’s not a pleasant laugh. ‘You’re such a little prick. Maybe I should shut you up. Bet your mouth just needs to be busy…’
‘I- hate- you.’ He separates each word with a heavy silent pause.
‘Shh… Draco is fine… Harry.’
‘I don’t think there’s anything he likes better than sucking cock,’ Josh said casually. ‘And he’s quite good at it. Dedicated.’
Draco grabbed Harry’s hair harshly, pulling his head back. His eyes were a storm Harry drowned in.
The worst of it was that he was sure Potter, oblivious as he was, had no fucking idea what he was doing. How effortlessly his eyes could break a person, how they could take any walls head on and shatter them. No matter how much time said person had spent building them up. A face like his - that showed every range of emotion and vulnerability - could disarm you, before you even knew what hit you.
See, Harry Potter, right bastard that he is, is also, to put it plainly, quite
‘Have I rendered you speechless? If I knew it would be this easy, I would have done it ages-’
‘Like what you see?’ Draco asked. His tone wasn’t so assured just now, it faltered slightly. It made Harry all the more dizzy and willing to show him just how much he liked everything about him.
‘Fuck.’
So... Draco is a bit unpredictable, right?
‘Harry,’ he lifted Harry’s chin up. Green eyes looked dazedly at him. ‘I need to ask you something and for that I need you to be here with me, fully aware… do you think you can do that?’
Draco was walking over to the bed, cock in hand, about to pop. He didn’t say anything and Harry did not beg anymore. His mouth fell open in offering.
‘You said no fucking,’ I say feebly. His hands wrap around my waist.
Love — love is not something one can spell real.
‘Today?’
‘Go with it,’ I whisper. And he does.
His mouth twists, he presses his lips together. He looks mad at himself.
There was nothing slow about their kiss, nothing submissive about Harry’s mouth this time over, and it was exactly what Draco wanted. Harry was soft and hard, his tongue inside Draco’s mouth like it belonged there, nowhere else. His hands caught on Draco’s arms, shaking badly, not daring to move elsewhere. Draco stopped the kiss, shutting down Harry’s protest when his hands took Harry’s to place them around him, down his back, over his arse. There was a pause, none of them moving, Harry’s hands just there, feeling him, Draco’s fingers still on Harry’s hair.
Pansy ends the staring contest by pressing her fingers to her temple, like I’m giving her an especially atrocious migraine.
I don’t expect anything, definitely not what he says. It’s the truth, in a whisper. I’m shouting before I know it, a bunch of nonsense, not what he needs surely, but it’s out, burning my throat and I’m not even done when he kisses me.
‘You always have been…’ Harry went on. ‘At school, I pretended I didn’t care, but… it’s not just that. I never thought that you… That night… you at this club… I couldn't believe it. It was the best sex of my fucking life.’ Harry looked at him evenly. He bit his lip. ‘But I thought that… since you’ve already had me, you’d move on to more interesting men and-’
There was a rush of magic crackling between them, tugging at him like a leash, his own magic rising to meet it, to yank at it. The kiss was rapidly becoming sex, Josh’s hands reaching for Draco’s cock and Harry’s magic cracked open. A frenzied sob reached his ears.
It was a sound that Draco knew, with crazy certainty, would make him come if only they were alone. Harry was the only one who could bear witness to him losing control like that, so he reeled it in.
‘No,’ I say slowly, my voice trembling. ‘For some fucked-up reason, I only want you, but that’s my fucking problem, isn’t it?’
Draco spoke softly against his length.
He was reduced to a thing that wanted Harry.
‘I want to make you lose all that composure you pretend to have when you’re playing Auror. That control they tried to drill into you. In here, you don’t need any of it. Moan for me.’
‘How many do you have?’ he couldn’t stop the questions.
‘Take me home,’ he said in a quiet rush. It was framed as a request, but there’s was no pleading to it. Draco felt those eyes luring him into a fantasy of their own, away from the club, away from everything, just the two of them.
Heading for the balcony, cigarette already between his fingers, white blond hair falling over his right eye. You drain your drink and set it on a passing tray.
He knew, at that moment, he was screwed. His answer would be too revealing.
But there’s something liberating about it too. I take a deep breath.
A slow devious teasing smile knocked all the breath out of Harry. He couldn’t take it.
‘Oh. Wow.’ Is what Potter says. He looks slightly awestruck. ‘So… er- let me just make sure that we’re on the same page here. You know, for the sake of clear communication. We want to date each other. That means we tell our friends. And we go on dates. Dinner, movies, Quidditch. Not necessarily in this order. Maybe we hold hands in public, that sort of thing. Unless- what’s your take on PDA?’
‘You taste so fucking good,’ he said, his hand coming up behind Harry’s neck and idly rubbing circles there. Harry was shivering. From the touch, from the words. From the fucking mind-blown orgasm he’d just had. Draco liked his taste.
‘Nothing you wouldn’t wholeheartedly agree on.’
‘And what do you get?’
‘The War really fucked us up, didn’t it?’
‘He does have quite the standards,’ Josh said teasingly. He was leaning back on the chair, watching them in amusement. Already he was a willing spectator, leaving the center stage to Draco.
‘A word to the wise is sufficient,’ he said. ‘Or in this case, a
‘Draco, here you are…’ Parkinson’s voice yanks me back to the street, the cold, the low muffled beat of the music coming from the club. She spots me. ‘Well, hello Potter.’
‘You didn’t get a chance to look at it last time,’ he said.
‘You tease…’ Draco growled.
Draco tugged harshly at the ring and the stripe of leather cut into Harry’s throat. He let Harry struggle to breathe. They were so close, Draco’s breath huffed over the stubble on Harry’s cheek. He was hitting that delicious and dangerous spot where truth came with sudden clarity and no shame.
I release him very slowly. We both sway on the spot, dizzy.
noise he’s making into your mouth, half frantic, half demanding. You think of apparating the both of you to his room, but you’ve never been here before and you’re so dizzy. He’s already walking you back, out of the living room.
I know I am. I feel it, too. Every man I ever slept with tells me that. But he’s nothing like them. He says it like a prayer, like a sacred truth.
, more like.
‘I know,’ Malfoy said. The cocky, self-evolved tone would have made a younger Harry want to punch him. Now… he just wanted
Even though those were words he was dying to hear, it wasn’t enough. He didn’t want those hands to leave him. Draco wasn’t telling him everything. He was holding back. After all they had done that night, he was holding back on something.
‘Yes,’ Harry laughed. ‘That’s sappy too, Draco.’
Your kiss is a thing of the dark. It takes you deep and away.
She gives me a long look that says it all. Mainly that if I was to forget him, I would have. Ten fucking years is a long time to want someone. It’s pitiful. Another reason I can’t tell him. Or allow myself to fill in the blanks of that night. Whatever he was about to say. Whatever I felt he might say. It’s probably all in my head.
Potter looks intently at him. There’s some question in the deep green eyes, but Draco doesn’t speak green eyes. It’s a problem, because he feels Potter is trying to tell him something life shattering. He feels dizzy. Then he remembers he didn’t eat anything since lunch.
I have no idea how he managed to convince me, but I start going down to the Great Hall for meals. The first time back there is the worst. There’s too many people at meal times. All of Hogwarts is packed there. I can hear them talking, finding their way to their friends, discussing classes and the latest gossip, carrying glasses of juice, piling up plates and books, cracking up jokes, laughing and it’s as if I’m drowning, something pressing heavy over my chest, all of the noise building up like a wall around me, as I’m sucked down under under under. This was never a problem before, but it is now. It’s one of the reasons I stopped showing up to meals. Draco puts his hand on my arm. I notice I’m shaking. I want to tell him it’s nothing, but I can’t say the words. He pulls me close and starts walking us over to the eight years table, his body working as a sort of shield between me and the wall of noise and people. I can still hear them, see them, it’s still too crowded, too much, but Draco keeps us walking in a straight line towards the table. He finds me a seat on the quietest end of the table and sits right next to me. He gently pushes a plate in my direction. I stare at the stark yellow scrambled eggs and instantly have to fight the urge to throw up. My face must have shown something, because Draco quickly pushes the plate away from me and sets a fuming tea mug in my hands instead. When Hermione and Ron come down for breakfast I’m already sipping my tea and biting on the ends of an already cold toast. But it’s more than I’ve done in months. They look really happy to see me there, but what I’m really awed at is that they speak to Draco all through breakfast. The three of them seem to be getting along, in fact, Ron and Hermione are the only people at the table who actually talk to Draco at all. After that first time, I start to go down to meals with them. I still don’t eat much and most of the food makes me nauseous. But what I do eat doesn’t get stuck like it did before. At least that’s something I can tell Mirna. I think she’ll be happy to know.
Please see the end notes for content warning.
It’s his time to gape at me.
His mouth crashes over yours. You swallow the guilt by letting him kiss you silent. He licks your lower lip, then his teeth sink there, biting. There’s a hunger in him that feeds your own. You nearly lift him off his feet and he pushes you into another room.
My fingers pry open the buttons in my trousers. Harry takes a step closer. I want his hands on me so badly I’m not above begging. But I don’t have to, because suddenly he’s there. His hands cover mine, and then his fingers are trailing over my bulge and my hips snap forward. He leans over, his breath ghosting over my neck.
He opens his eyes.
‘Cut the bulshit, Potter,’ she says in a crisp tone, taking the empty seat next to me.
There are the boys. They’re not the same.
She takes off her fancy glasses and slips a pair of even fancier sunglasses on her nose, imperiously walking out the door.
erases everything else.
‘Well, fuck them.’ He chortles. ‘Draco, you know I’m terrible at non-monogamy. Every one of those blokes is better off without me. It’s not really my thing. Unless- do you want to be non-monogamous? We could try- that Muggle thing-’
Do you want to go somewhere else?
‘I… I really suck at this. Just forget the sign, that was stupid. What I mean is… I’d like to be busy with you.’
‘Kinky.’
She eyes him amusedly, then turns her smile to me. She knows she’s interrupting. She also knows she’s right about me and him. A Pansy who is right is an impossible Pansy.
‘A kiss. From me?’
Nothing really changed, and yet-
‘I’m here Draco. What do you want to ask?’
In a daze, you draw back and drive back in. He moves his hips, meets your thrusts. His eyes are unfocused. The grey in them is nearly blue at the corners of his irises.
Then there’s that fateful Saturday night. Potter has the nerve to walk up to me, leaving his blonde-for-the-night standing there, not ten feet away, waiting for him while he hits on me.
Josh breathed heavily. He pulled at Harry’s hair and yanked his head back. Harry was the perfect picture of a cockslut, his mouth open for cock, his spit dripping down his lips, his jaw, his neck, over Josh’s length.
,’ he said, eyes dark, pupils blown wide.
I’m whole, I’m whole.
‘I bet I can get you hard in a minute, Draco…’ he whispers, licking a path on my neck. I shiver, and not for a good reason.
‘More interesting men? More interesting that Harry fucking Potter? You’re kidding me.’
You follow him out.
It’s my turn to laugh. It comes out loud and slightly crazed, like it doesn’t belong to me.
A stubborn line shows up on his forehead.
Babe?
His eyes are so grey. The only thing left of the boy I knew. But they’re no longer cold. They’re not cold at all. His hand tangled in my hair, his whole body flung into mine. He can’t hide the fact that he’s breathless.
‘Since school. But I think you already know.’
‘It would be so easy to break it, Draco.’
After he blacked out in my arms, I levitated him here. I thought of taking him to the Hospital Wing, but somehow I didn't think he'd want that. He’d have to explain. Whatever happened to him, it's wrong. So wrong. This wasn't a fight like ours. This was something else. Something horrible- something he’s not going to want to explain to a Healer. Or anyone.
You lean into him, kiss the corner of his mouth. You do it softly. Tenderly, even. His fingers dig into your hips. You kiss him with slow purpose, your hands on his face. It’s way too sweet, you know this, but he doesn’t stop you. Your fingers brush his scalp, his hair. He pulls you closer, towards the bed. He lies back, you climb on top of him, kissing the nape of his neck, his hands on your shoulders. Your face rubs over his chest, you lick over his nipple. His hands drag down your skin, press on the small of your back, trying to push you closer, to find the friction he needs. You don’t give it to him. In fact, this isn’t the hard fuck he asked for, this is something else you didn’t know was there.
thing, with Potter waiting at the other end. No one in their right mind would think such a pathetic thing. But he’s played other scenes in his head. Ten years is a long time to dream of someone you’ll never have. But those were just dreams. Castles made of clouds. Beautiful, untouchable. Like Potter.
Potter grins at him. It should be ridiculous, but it’s just fucking attractive in a way it has no right to be. Draco releases his hand and picks up the sign. He turns it and reads the words again. It’s the most pathetic thing.
Here’s what you know thus far:
Draco lifted his fingers to Harry’s lips. The first touch was slow and silent. Josh stopped moving, still inside Harry, his eyes on the both of them. The tip of Draco’s index finger traced Harry’s lower lip, mapping it. Harry wasn’t breathing and Draco felt his heart beating on the tip of his finger. Another finger joined the first one. Harry let his lips part, his body jerking forward.
‘Did I say you could look away, Draco?’
But Draco knew what had hit him, and he’d been hit hard. Hard enough to know he was screwed.
Josh chuckled.
Draco stopped the kiss and stepped back, his breath uneven, his clothes in disarray, his body heated. Harry’s face was wet, his hands curled into fists, his arms trembling. He looked ready to endure anything at all. Draco took a step towards him.
‘Can I?’
Gotta love Pansy. She has great timing. Like that time she suggested we delivered Potter to the Dark Lord. She thought the Dark Lord would stop at that. She didn’t know him like I did. She regrets it now. I wonder if Potter knows.
‘I want
Then, with no warning, Draco pulled him up by his hair, a fierce look on his face and kissed him.
‘We’re heading for his place, unless-’ Potter presses on.
My eyes snap open almost instantly.
‘Your prefered type is famously known, Potter.’ She drawls.
His cock was sliding over Harry’s tongue. Draco trashed on the couch, his hand tight on Harry’s hair, the other pumping his cock. It only took one pull, really. He came with an ear-splitting cry and watched as his come spilled over Harry’s tongue, down Harry’s lips, down his chin. He rubbed his length against Harry’s cheeks, and Harry let him, tongue darting out to lick every trace he could get to. He had a look of total bliss on his face, like he’d waited a lifetime for this.
He sobbed when Malfoy removed them, but then he felt Malfoy’s breath on his skin. He let out a cry when he realised Malfoy had dropped to his knees behind him. Malfoy’s tongue was on his feverish skin, licking over his arse. Then teeth sank on the flesh. His arse was so sensitive that the pain was intense and still he pushed into Malfoy’s mouth, feeling his tongue lash over his skin, wetness and heat spreading all over. His arms shook on the restraints as Malfoy bit into his skin, hands coming up to Harry’s thighs, soothing him as his mouth viciously robbed Harry of any thought. Harry couldn’t fight it anymore, he was screaming, as Malfoy’s mouth alternated between licking, kissing, biting so fast that he couldn’t keep up with it. He was about to lose it. Malfoy’s mouth found his crease, licked a path down towards Harry’s bollocks and the renting yell that went through him made his ears ring. A bright light flashed in front of his eyes.
‘Don’t you fucking say that,’ he bites out. There’s that raw fire in his eyes again, the taint of darkness calling to me. ‘Fuck, Draco. I tried to abide by your rules.
‘Good, ‘cause I’m tired of dreams. Stay the night.’
And of dying.
His hand on my arm tells me more than all the fights we had. My mouth speaks on its own. He answers me, shouting. My mouth does it again. It kisses him without my saying so.
Potter is sitting at a table, in a quiet cozy corner, away from the windows. I get the feeling he chose it on purpose. It feels secluded, hidden from possible prying eyes. So he wants to meet me in public; he just doesn’t want to be seen with me. I have half a mind to turn and leave when he looks up. His eyes meet mine. There’s a livid and slightly pink gash cutting across his left cheek. It’s nearly healed, but clearly recent. It changes his whole expression to one torn between a complete stranger and an older version of this person I knew almost all of my life. He holds my gaze as I walk over, trying my best to pretend this is not a huge mistake.
It is the next day. There is light. It comes in from your window. It nearly blinds you.
The admission is not what you expected.
‘I’m not seeing him again,’ I say in a whisper. I let the truth of it settle over me & it’s too much. It feels like something heavy is sitting on my chest & crushing me.
Malfoy’s hand was wanking him in the most slow, deliberate, delicious way ever, his other hand cupping his bollocks.
‘You didn’t heal them,’ he said, and it wasn’t a question but he willed it to look like one.
I don’t expect him to pull a blanket over us.
‘That's an original one,’ Malfoy says, laugh in his voice. ‘Come over and check my... books.’
‘There’s this girl,’ she says, a dimple forming on her cheek.
I’ve had you.’
I catch his eyes on me from across the room, his face struck in green, white, blue, yellow, purple, pink. I move to the beat, against the pain, the past, the whole wide world. It keeps the war at bay, but I don’t do it to forget. I remember everything I did.
- that shot down his body. Fortunately, he had become quite good at hiding unwanted emotions. His hand shook minutely. Well, at least he
‘You look like shit.’ She sentences.
I open and close my mouth. A single thought: this is impossible.
And then it all happens very fast. Flannagan looks straight ahead, but I watch how he deliberately bumps his shoulder hard against Draco’s. I can tell that Draco doesn’t notice him until it’s already happening. The plate nearly drops from his shaking hand, bright red juice spills over to the floor. Draco flinches, face livid. He looks away from Flannagan, steps back fast without a single word.
‘Look-’ he started, but Josh cut him off.
They moved together, hands twisting over the head, the way Draco liked it.
‘What do you mean?’
He has one foot against the wall, his jaw half hidden by the upturned collar of his long grey jacket. As you reach him, he takes another slow drag of his cigarette, the tip shining red.
