“i hate galas,” harry groans as he pulls off his glasses. he drops them without a care, but a gust of wandless and wordless magic sends them to his bedside table - this particular party trick never failed to make draco marvel silently at harry’s innate power and magical skill. he runs his hands through his hair, releasing the long locks from their modest knot at the base of his neck. “even the ones hosted by my best friend,” his hands go to his tie next, which he struggles with for a moment before draco steps forward, undoing the knot in mere seconds. harry sighs, his eyes fluttering shut. “christ, thank you.”
harry doesn’t respond, but he allows draco to wrap his arms around him and pull him into his chest. he begins to sob loudly, his fingers grappling at draco’s as he trembles in his arms. with each wracking cry, draco’s heart clenches uncomfortably. it was rare and uncomfortable to see harry cry - and he had never cried this hard, for this long.
pansy nodded absently, reaching over and squeezing his thigh comfortingly, but downed her drink in one go. “yes, of course, dear. watch my purse for me, will you?” with that, she was pulled off to the dance floor by a giggling ginny and luna. they quickly carved out a space for themselves and began to dance against each other in a strange tangle.
finally, harry dismounts and walks towards their ensuite on shaky legs. there, he wets a towel and brings it back to their bedroom. he sits beside draco as he wipes away all remnants of their time - making sure to be extra gentle as he cleans his lover. draco lies still and allows himself to be cleaned, his eyes soft and following harry’s movements the entire time.
and so he sat, his head resting on pansy’s shoulder, staring at the clock and waiting for harry to come home and decide that he had had enough of draco. on the other side of the sofa, goyle sat stiffly, seemingly flipping through one of harry’s quidditch magazines, although he hadn’t moved from the second page in about ten minutes. theo had disappeared back upstairs, and blaise had retreated into the kitchen in search of snacks.
he walked to their ensuite bathroom, staring at himself in the mirror and taking deep trembling breaths. a quiet, wandless
draco was decidedly in his element, wrapped in a thick blanket and curled up with some novel. he hadn’t moved in the last few hours, except to push his reading glasses up his nose or tot urn the page. he loved snow days, and was perfectly content to spend the day curled in front of the fireplace like a cat, drinking up the warmth and occasionally padding into the kitchen to nibble at something.
she drops the privacy charm, wrapping an arm around his waist and guiding him gently to the apparition point. if people are looking at them, he doesn’t notice - completely grounded by the solid warmth of pansy against his side.
“you call your cat bitch?” harry laughs, watching as she strolls from the room leisurely, her tail flicking back and forth slowly. draco will have to ply her with treats later to apologize for this slight.
“i’ve been selfish my entire life,” draco sniffs, leaning forward to press his forehead against harry’s. “i don’t want to be selfish anymore. what do you need? i’ll go get it for you right now. i’ll do anything.”
an old, threadbare blanket lies on the ground, and a few boxes and crates are crammed into the further corner of the space. aside from the clutter, the cupboard remains mostly empty, save for a shelf, littered with small, broken action figures - remnants from harry’s childhood. he imagines a young harry, curled inside of this dark, dank space, cold and afraid and feeling as if he would never be loved. suddenly, draco feels heavily nauseous, along with the urge to cry, and to also blow down the entire fucking house.
“draco,” harry groaned as he changed his speed, bouncing on his cock much quicker than before. “fuck, draco.”
“i know, harry,” draco says, springing up. he tried to touch harry, lay a hand on his arm, but he flinched away, making draco wince. “i’m sorry,”
“absolutely not!” draco stood from the couch, affronted. “i was raised in a manor, not a barn, potter. pets are simply unacceptable. merlin knows why you would want some filthy mongrel wandering around your house - tracking dirt and shit all over the place. it’s bad enough you always forget to spell the bottom of your shoes clean after you come inside - how can you expect to keep a clean home with an animal running about? have you gone mad?”
“absolutely,” harry says dryly, before grabbing a handful of floo powder. He coughs loudly as he steps into the fireplace, watching through squinted eyes as pansy fixes him with an unimpressed stare. harry lands roughly, stumbling out of the floo and nearly falling, before being caught by a quietly amused draco.
for so long, potter had been a source of irritance for draco - and now, here he was, calming the rocky sea that had been draco’s like since he had walked out of it two years ago. when the light begins to fade just a bit, they trip inside, giggling and touching each other gently, almost as if they’re both afraid to break the other.
however, draco held no desire to do so. his magic hadn’t been the same since he left london, anyways. it felt like an unwelcome intruder now - unpredictable and unnecessary.
“you haven’t,” draco whispered, his voice as small as he feels. a tear escapes his eye and he quickly wipes it away, looking away from harry.
harry, who stands on his doorstep, claiming to be changed, with his hand outstretched. his hand, the hand that had wrapped around draco’s throat and
harry drops to his knees, perfecting the rhythm of his palm and swallowing draco’s nearly fully-erect cock in one go. draco responds immediately, gasping loudly as his fingers come down to grip harry’s head. he takes draco’s length easily - swallowing to the hilt and pausing for a moment to allow himself to adjust.
“no,” he had muttered, pushing harry away from him as they stood in the dark of the pub. “i will not be your mistress.”
draco didn’t have to turn his head to know who had sidled up to him. he had been watching potter all night from his safe spot in the back of the ballroom. nobody else had made an attempt to try and talk to him, which he was fine with - he had only come to this ball because his mother had pleaded with him, desperate to restart her social climb. potter, on the other hand, had been in high demand all evening, being dragged from table to table by hermione granger, smiling and shaking hands, but mostly standing awkwardly to the side with his hands shoved in his pockets, like the vagabond he truly was.
at that moment, hermione returns to the table, her arms laden with different cocktails. as she sets them down in front of their owners, she looks around.
with each stroke of his hips, he had brushed draco’s prostate. his lips had kissed gently and consistently at the column of draco’s neck and spine, his fingers had ghosted over every inch of his exposed skin, and the loud moans and groans that had poured from his lips had been downright sinful.
at eight, harry stumbles down the steps clumsily, rubbing at his eyes sleepily and yawning quietly. even hungover, harry always rises early. “hey,” he murmurs as he passes draco, pausing for a moment to press a chaste kiss to draco’s forehead. he tries not to cringe away. “good morning. ‘s there any more coffee?”
at some point, ron came down the steps with a babbling rose in his arms. his eyes were red-rimmed, but it’s obvious that he was attempting to hold it together for the sake of his family. he sat rose down on the ground, where she quickly became fascinated by a few wooden blocks. he sat on the couch beside draco, a tentative hand finding his back and rubbing large, comforting circles. when draco is able to calm himself down a bit, hermione pulled away and goes to sit on the other side of ron. she buried her face in his chest, and his arm went around her shoulder automatically and he began pressing gentle kisses to her temple. in a surprising display of intuition, he wrapped an arm around draco and pulls him close as well.
“we should go,” draco murmured, his fingers brushing at the neck of harry’s robes. “not a good look for the minister to be late,”
dudley’s face softens as he listens - he looks almost hopeful now. a wobbly smile spreads across his face and he looks up at draco. “oh, yeah?”
“you must leave, human.” came a deep voice from the clearing behind draco. he looked up through blurry eyes, staring dumbly at the form of a centaur emerging from the woods. his skin was dark, and his chest was well muscled. a long curtain of hair fell around his waist, surprisingly silky and straight. draco stared into his handsome face - unsure of how to feel or react. “your kind does not belong here.”
“it’s going to be okay, draco,” she whispered, her voice trembling. somehow, despite the tremor in her voice, draco found himself wanting desperately to believe her. he clung to her even as she tried to pull away, grabbing her sweater in tight fists and burying his face in her soft stomach, like a child and their mother.
“well,” harry said, flipping their position so that draco was on his back, staring up at harry with wide eyes. “you practically put me through hell over a dream,”
the dursleys crammed in the backseat, with vernon behind draco and dudley behind harry, with skinny petunia squished between them. they stayed nearly completely silent, only speaking when draco asked them a direct question or to whimper quietly with fear. draco didn’t allow this to phase him. as far as he was concerned, this was just he and harry, simply out for another long drive.
when they arrive, pansy dismisses the aurors with a severe nod and then gestures for harry and draco to leave through the floo once more. as per usual, draco went through first, landing in their living room gracefully and quickly positioning himself to catch harry when he inevitably stumbled through the fireplace and nearly landed on his face.
when draco had finally told andrew the story of harry, he saw him angry for the very first time. he had clenched his fists and his jaw, fuming quietly, until he saw the way that draco tensed up beside him. and then he had excused himself from the room, only returning ten minutes later, much calmer and with that familiar, gentle smile on his face. there seemed to be a different air of understanding surrounding them now - an explanation for draco’s hesitation concerning their relationship, a new understanding for why it had taken them almost a year to reach milestones that most couples reached within three months.
“that night… you called me a liar.” harry continues, staring across the table at draco shamelessly. he examines draco carefully with his eyes, drinking in every part of him. it hits draco that this is probably the first time that harry can stare at him for as long as he likes without any guilt or possible judgement from anyone else. draco lets him look. “i never lied. not about anything draco. i couldn’t, not to you.”
“harry,” draco says, his voice breaking. he looks up at harry, who still refuses to meet his eyes. “harry.”
but he can’t do any of these things, because he can’t move. he stands stock still while lucy sniffs at his feet and pants excitedly at the new stranger, while andrew appears behind him, wrapping a familiar arm around his waist.
“a glorious time,” blaise smiled, pouring himself a glass, and then four more. he raised it in the air. “to a lifetime of slytherin debauchery.”
he surreptitiously slipped one of the unopened lube bottles into his pocket, smiling demurely at harry as he did. “potter,” he said as he strolled past harry, nodding jerkily at him. “later, malfoy!”
, he realizes belatedly, flicking hurriedly at his own tears. “how could you say that, harry?” he asks quietly, “i’ve stayed. all this time. i was here, and it was
draco flicks his wrist once more, and a shield snaps into place over them - just as the car explodes and parts go flying. harry flinches - the sound is deafening, and only slightly muffled by the shield charm holding fast around them.
draco falls asleep that night, tucked beneath harry potter's arm. he sleeps better than he has in years, soothed by the presence of harry - the constant warmth of his body. he sleeps with a small smile on his lips - unusual, but understandable. here, now, in his little cottage, so far removed from all he once knew and held dear - draco thinks that he has a real chance at happiness.
“i’m always a prat,” draco said lowly, hoping potter wouldn’t notice the slight tremor in his voice. “it’s my trademark.”
standing before the oversized ornate mirror that leaned in the corner of their room, harry adjusted his robes one final time. he wore a simple yet elegant set of robes, inky black and excellently tailored. he didn’t think he would ever grow accustomed to all of the layers that wizards wore - his normal, scruffy clothes could hardly be seen by all the garb and flowy robes that he seemed to constantly find himself wearing. his days of wearing denim that had gone soft in the knees and arse were long gone everywhere he went were long gone. now, some of his favorite pants remained tucked away in a bureau, waiting for the days when draco would request harry’s help in the garden. he adjusted the wand holster strapped to his thigh, flexing his leg a few times to test the integrity of the leather thong. that, along with his rigorous workout routine, were two things from his auror training that he had sworn to never give up - and had, thus far, maintained.
harry obeyed, taking a sip. almost instantaneously, his shoulders relaxed and he sat back into the couch, sighing contentedly. he took a few more deep pulls from the mug before pulling it away - whipped cream and cinnamon caught on the hairs of his mustache. before draco could say something, he reached up and wiped it away with a finger and stuck it into his mouth, moaning softly around the digit.
as everyone fawns over weasley’s ring and titters over possible details for potter and she-weasel’s impending nuptials, draco gets steadily sloshed, until his usual precaution melts away and he finds himself murmuring into theodore nott’s ear, one hand on his shoulder and the other stroking lightly at his neck.
pansy seems very confused, but reaches forward to touch draco anyways. his entire body trembles beneath her hands, and she suddenly realizes that something is very, very wrong.
there’s a long pause, during which harry pulls his hand back and rakes it through his wild hair, sighing deeply and sitting back in his chair. he watches draco cry silently and wipe furiously at his tears, his mouth curved down into a frown. “what do you want me to do?” he asks quietly, almost sincerely. draco looks up at him, blinking away a new onslaught of tears.
“harry, what are you doing?” draco asked, baffled. it seemed as if the bubble they had been floating in for the past week was preparing to pop. “what’s wrong?”
“right,” harry says, pulling draco onto his lap. he gave him a moment to adjust his position, before reaching up and stroking his face gently, pulling him down into a kiss. draco quickly took charge, pushing his tongue past harry’s lips. he lapped at the inside of harry’s mouth hungrily, pressing his chest flush to harry’s. “woah there, tiger,” harry laughed breathlessly, pushing draco away.
the tears come for what feels like hours, forcing themselves out with each hulking gasp draco takes. a part of draco feels as if he’s dying, as if he’ll hyperventilate and keel over from the force of it. the grief settles around him like a heavy cloak - weighing his body down and making doing anything other than letting it swallow him completely feel impossible. the embarrassment he knows he should feel evades him - giving the illusion that all sense of normalcy and decorum had left draco’s life along with harry.
the colorful swears harry dropped signified that he had injured himself, draco took this as an opportunity to escape.
sitting up, draco pulls off his floppy hat and sunglasses, glancing over the porch railing and down at the beach. only the top of harry’s head is visible, standing in the sand and shuffling back and forth. draco stood slowly, moving towards the banister and glancing down.
he lands in hermione’s living room, stumbling as he does. he looks around - he’s been here a handful of times, but never without harry at his side, a firm grip on his waist. on the sofa, ron dozes lightly, and blinks up at draco, puzzled. he looks like he’s about to say something, likely ask draco to get out and allow him to continue his napping,
draco steps past him, moving down the hall and coming to a rest before the door to the cupboard. he pauses, frozen, staring at it blankly. it’s short - only comes up to about his thigh. he would have to get on the floor and crawl like a child just to fit in the door.
pansy pulled draco into an embrace, continuing to wipe away his never ending flow of tears. they had known that draco was an emotional drunk, but none of the slytherins had expected to have to console a weeping draco for nearly two hours while he listed everything he loved about harry potter.
a part of draco realized that he was acting ridiculously, and that he was heavily projecting onto the innocent centaur. the words he spat with so much venom - they were the same ones he asked himself everyday in the mirror, and as he ate, and as he laid in the dark and attempted to sleep.
on one of the many occasions that they had lain face to face, almost touching - but not quite post-coitus, harry had whispered something to draco.
harry flicks his wand and lucius rises into the air, his body hanging limply. a part of harry wants to play with lucius, to toss him about the room and perhaps smack him into some furniture - but harry hadn’t been joking. draco would need his comfort tonight - it wouldn’t do to spend hours teasing lucius. he sets him onto the bed and checks that he’s immobilised - strengthening the spells just in case, before hopping onto the bed himself, crawling over lucius and straddling him.
“can i kiss you right now?” harry asks, and draco’s knees go weak. harry steps close to him, and draco inhales the familiar earthy scent. he opens his mouth again, and draco smells the peppermints he knows harry has had recently. “i’d like to kiss you.”
“for leaving, i mean. i can’t say that i understand why - i wish you would’ve felt like you could’ve talked to me. or anyone, really. but it’s okay. and i also wanted to say that i’m sorry. for so long, i - i felt like i failed you. you were hurting, and i didn’t do anything to help you… if there was something i could’ve done… i would’ve done it harry, i promise. i would’ve done anything just to have you here with me again. i’m sorry, baby. i love you. i really, really love you. so much. but i have to let you go now, because it’s killing me. but i think that i’ll be okay. i’m finally starting to feel like myself again. it was a bit touch and go last year. especially for the first few months… but you know how it is. or, maybe you don’t.
“draco,” harry says, moving forward quickly. he wraps his arms around him and pulls him to his feet, holding him close. draco trembles in his arms, quick, shallow breaths escaping him rapidly. “love, are you okay?”
“draco,” harry murmurs, pulling away after a few long moments, pressing his forehead to draco’s. “you’re so perfect. i love you, angel.” and then he’s leaning forward again, connecting his lips to draco’s once more.  “you’re so good, draco,” he whispers. one of his hands moves up, gently cupping draco’s face and angling his chin upwards. when harry pulls away again, leaving draco breathing deeply and smiling dumbly, he begins to pepper kisses all over draco’s face - his forehead, his eyes, his nose, his neck, his lips, again and again. “i love you. i want you. i want to choose you. i do. i love you.”
harry’s lips found draco’s neck at some point, pulling his loose sweater down over his shoulder and giving harry full access to the smooth skin there. he bit down lightly as draco fucked himseld on his cock - suddenly more focused on chasing his own orgasm. with each movement of his hips, harry’s cock was brushing his prostate - and he could feel the familiar pressure building in his stomach and balls that told him he wouldn’t last long.
“it shouldn’t be too long now,” she mused, conjuring a calendar. “harry should be back anytime this week. regardless, what are your symptoms?”
draco worries his lip for a moment, breathing deeply and looking away from his friends. they stare at him, attentive.
“you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, harry.” he starts, taking a shaky breath. he stares at the wall - the same way he had early this morning. “i know that i act so sure of myself all the time - so confident… but - i know i don’t deserve you. you’re strong, and beautiful, and kind, and
“draco lucius malfoy, you sick bastard,” came theo’s voice from the living room. a small plastic bottle came sailing in, bouncing off of draco's head and clattering onto the table.
“that’s nice, draco,” she says gently, wrapping an arm around his waist and resting her head against his shoulder. they lean into each other silently, watching the curve of their bodies against each other in the mirror. like this, draco muses to himself, they look a bit like siblings. the same waifish features, the same pale hair. suddenly, a wave of appreciation for luna spreads through him.
they resumed their journey, with harry pulling draco along less than gently. as they passed a balcony, draco darted away - rushing outside and leaning over the edge. harry rushed after him, swearing under his breath.
once the plates had emptied for the final time and they were all pleasantly full, the music grew louder once more and harry and hermione stood from their seats.
draco looks up at him, probably embarrassingly pink and with wet eyes and quivering lips. harry stares back, his expression so painfully open. draco can read him like a book - whether it’s because potter is just that accessible, or because draco knows him inside and out, and better than anyone else. he thinks draco is beautiful - and draco is falling apart right now.
the last few weeks had been hectic and they had barely seen each other, what with the recent increased demand for pepper-up potions and other immune system boosting potions - common for the early summer months, when young witches and wizards came home from hogwarts and shared their curious germs with their older family members. as a result, draco had spent been spending long days in his lab at st. mungo’s, hunched over cauldrons and tweaking his own latest contrivance - a spin on the muggle concept of vaccinations.
“okay?” harry asks first, looking up at draco and gently stroking his hair. his eyes are hazy, as they usually are post-orgasm. he looks delightfully fucked, and soft, and at times like these harry wants nothing more than to hold him close.
he pads to the door, licking the excess chocolate from his fingers as he does. at his feet, lucy, their puppy trots beside him, always pleased with any activity that has to do with opening the door.
“how dare you!” draco shrieked, his finger itching towards his wand. “harry james potter, i swear to merlin if you bring a dog home, i’m leaving. i will pack my bags and you will never see me again. i promise you that much.”
“it’s the hufflepuff’s you have to watch out for,” theo interjected. “they’re a bit too friendly for my liking.”
he wraps his arms around draco and pulls him close, and kisses him like it’s his sole purpose in life. his tongue presses into draco’s mouth, small whimpers escaping his lips every few moments. their bodies slot together like kismet, every one of draco's sharp edges fitting perfectly with harry’s deep canyons. draco feels like he’s dying, or taking his first breath of air. he can’t remember a time before this, before he did anything other than roll around on his duvet and snog potter. he doesn’t want to remember frankly - there’s nothing more important than this, than the press of their bodies together, than potter’s fingers and lips and knees and elbows everywhere, surrounding draco, pulling him in, finally, pulling him from the ledge that he had been balancing precariously on for so long.
“you’re not my bloody mistress,” harry had slurred, his hands still fumbling with draco’s coat. “ginny and i are keeping it casual.”
when pansy comes through the floo with grace equal to draco’s entrance, she does a quick scan of the house using a
draco was already on his fourth glass of wine, his tolerance lowered from almost three months without as much as a sip. he didn’t like to drink when the kids were home from hogwarts, but almost always got completely smashed the first day that the kids returned to hogwarts.
he doesn’t finish the sentence, doesn’t know how to. there are too many variables, too many different things that can fit on the end and still work. so much that he can no longer do - not without harry’s warmth and his smile by draco’s side..
draco doesn’t realize that he’s started crying until he feels the tears splash against his open palms in his lap. “harry,” he chokes, suddenly throwing all caution to the wind. “harry,
privately, draco felt that there was no other way to describe the intimacy of the moment. after four years together, they had long fallen out of their early habit of having sex nearly every day. once or twice a week, they would reach for each other. the sex was good and consistent and enjoyable for both parties.
- and genuine, blazing smiles. harry gives a speech as well, although draco hardly listens, his leg bouncing with anticipation and his fingers drumming impatiently atop the table. at some point, pansy and the rest of harry’s auror detail materialize behind him, waiting patiently for the okay to leave. when harry finally reappears at draco’s side, they make short work of saying their goodbyes. draco and ron share a cordial nod, while he and harry hug and pat each other on the back as if they won’t see each other as soon as next week for drinks at the hog's head. hermione and luna give them both kisses on both cheeks, while a subtly intoxicated ginny grins dopily.
sometime that week, harry had canceled the rest of his appointments. draco hadn’t asked for details, and harry hadn’t offered any.
they end the call as harry finishes completely, jumping once more to stand away from his creation, admiring his work with his hands on his hips and a proud smile on his face.
they don’t immediately obey. instead, their eyes dart somewhere behind draco, growing impossibly wider. draco doesn’t have to turn to know that harry has appeared in the doorway.
“right, then.” he turned on his heel and caught draco’s eye again, that familiar affectionate look immediately softening his features. he reached out and took draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together, before pulling him from the room without another glance behind him.
when he’s finally caught his breath, harry does what only feels natural - crawling off of draco and bending down to place a soft kiss in the crook of his neck, his hands finding draco’s and squeezing gently. draco sighs happily as he does - his free arm coming up to wrap around harry’s neck.
“i mean…” harry starts, but is quickly interrupted by draco, who licks a long stripe up harry’s neck, ending at his jaw. there, he places a gentle kiss, his teeth grazing against the skin of harry’s cheek. “oh,” he ends softly, feeling his resolve deflate.
draco and achilles were still lying on the couch, with draco clutching his paws and screeching his way through a remix of
he doesn’t know how many drinks he had last night, or how many terribly embarrassing things he might’ve whispered on the floor of his foyer.
! i’ve been a good wife, a good mother, a good woman! vernon was right - he was ungrateful! we are good people!”
as he folds, he purposefully doesn’t think. he doesn’t think about his sleeping partner, about the small bag in his pocket, about the addiction that they had been so sure that harry had kicked. he doesn’t think of all of the late nights he had spent in his lab, focused entirely on his own endeavors, or of harry’s evasiveness all the times that draco had asked him about his day. he doesn’t think for hours, he only folds and organizes and washes and sorts, and then sits in the dark, his eyes closed and a finger rubbing at his temple.
“harry, you aren’t listening.” a tear escapes draco’s eye and he quickly wipes it away, keeping eye contact with harry. he places his hands on harry’s cheeks, cupping his face and pulling him close. “you’re the best thing in the entire world. you’re like the sun. i would die for you.”
“yea,” harry rushes out of the door, before backpedaling and moving back to draco’s bedside. he leaned over the bed, gently grasping draco’s chin and pulling him into a light kiss. “love you,”
“harry,” draco’s voice shakes as he speaks, but the quiet intimacy of the moment overshadows the embarrassment he feels. he leans forward, cupping harry’s face in his hands. “i swear, you - you’re... you’re perfect. i love you,”
they had agreed that a wedding could wait until they were both secure. for now, being engaged and infatuated with each other was more than enough. the future seemed bright - complete with the idea of a family, successful careers, and the happy ending that they both felt they deserved.
he sighed, looking down at his mother with a sad smile. “mum, i need something completely new. it’ll be good for me... i’ll be able to move on. beside, it’s not forever. i have to come back home someday.” he doesn’t add the fact that he thinks it’ll be a very long time before he feels
their living room had seen lots of changes over the past few years. there had been different wall paints, and couches, and photographs and paintings. he had liked each version well enough, but now, it felt like home. a memory flashes through draco’s mind as he stares around at the room that he has always loved so dearly. years ago, when things had still been new and exciting and draco had developed a minor obsession with muggle music - they had waltzed in slow circles around this now-replaced shaggy carpet. they had already shared a bottle of wine, and laughed quietly as they leaned into each other, rocking back and forth in a poor imitation of a slow dance. from draco’s record player crooned one of his favorites - an old-timey song about the inevitability of hurting your lover the most. things had been new, and warm, and exciting when draco had leaned close, his face pressed into the crook of harry’s neck, and whispered, “
“you know, malfoy,” potter said, sidling closer to draco, a grin spread across his face. “you’re kind of funny when you’re not being a prat.”
“well, i - i tried my best. i did what i could for the boy!” she nods jerkily, as if trying to convince herself of the words coming out of her mouth. “
“draco, you - ” his voice started in a yell - truly displaying the anger that draco knows is burning in his chest. he pauses for a moment and takes a breath before continuing. “you - i don't understand how you could think that.” his voice broke, “have i made you feel like there’s someone else? that i need somebody else in my life?”
draco nods, pulling the car off to the side of the road and turning it off. he turned in his seat to glance at the dursleys, who all blinked back at him with eyes wide from fear. then, he turned back to harry, who was staring down at his lap. it was unusual for him to stay quiet for this long - car rides had always been punctuated with laughter and lively conversation, not tense silence and an eerie sense of foreboding.
“what do you want to talk about?” draco asked. his voice was embarrassingly soft - he chalked it up to post-orgasmic bliss and pushed away any shame. as long as he was here, with harry, there was no need for any humiliation.
“your ancestors were racist, and would probably be trying to warn you about harry’s ethnicity rather than the status of his fidelity.” blaise commented, “any curry related dreams recently?”
he just starts talking, as if he had been holding it in for a long time and had been waiting until he was before draco to finally let go. he tells draco about losing granger and all of the weasley’s, about feeling hopeless and terribly alone, about volunteering at charities and guest lecturing at hogwarts whenever headmistress mcgonagall asks him to.
occasionally, if they woke up early enough, they would go for a round - leaving draco panting beneath the sheets and harry smiling and whistling for the rest of the day. while harry showered, draco would catch his last bits of sleep, and then join harry in the bathroom while he brushed his teeth and shaved. draco would perch on the toilet seat, wrapped in one of harry’s large sweaters. his eyes, wide and still full of sleep, would train on harry, watching with silent fascination and adoration as harry got ready for work.
knowing that harry was out there somewhere, fighting darkness was never easy. he knew how angry most dark wizards were with harry, for forcing them to go underground or jailing their friends and family. they were ruthless, and wouldn’t hesitate to hurt harry. the idea made draco’s stomach twist. determined to not ruin his day before it could truly begin, he kept flipping through the prophet, and to the funny pages. a cartoon of a wizard accidentally vanishing his head kept replaying, and draco forced himself to laugh weakly.
when harry didn’t move, draco staggered forward, stopping at his bedside. he reached out to touch harry’s face - that warm, tan skin that he had kissed and stroked just a few hours ago - but recoiled at the inhuman chill there. harry had always radiated warmth, even on his worst days, but now there was no trace of it. tears welled in draco’s eyes as he stared down at harry, seemingly dozing beneath the white sheet.
”i felt like i would always belong to you,” draco whispers, leaning into harry. suddenly, he understands the way harry had rambled for so long back in the kitchen. now that harry is here, with him, he wants to tell him everything - wants to talk and talk and never stops talking, if it means keeping harry, keeping his attention. “i dreamed of the day you would walk in and tell me that this was one of my nightmares, and that i was still yours, and you were still mine… i hoped that you would wake me up from the nightmare, just like you did that time. that you would love me, actually love me - ”
when she’s not busy working at the ministry or reading about wizarding laws, granger takes it upon herself to become draco’s mind healer.
“yes,” blaise shouted back at him. draco cringed, wondering when his fellow purebloods had completely abandoned all of their youth training. “draco’s being pathetic.”
when he pushed open the door, he found harry lying in their bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. draco crawled onto the bed beside him, and takes it as a good sign when harry looks at him and doesn’t tell him to fuck off.
last week, after potter had finally come following nearly an hour of consistent fucking, he had buried his face in draco’s shoulder, still trembling and gasping for air, and muttered a soft ‘i love you’. draco had discounted it as momentary insanity caused by the force of his orgasm, until potter had caught his breath and rolled over, grinning stupidly and pressing kisses to draco’s jaw and shoulder. i love you, draco, he had said again, and draco had frozen. his heart had stopped and he had gone stock-still, staring down at harry, just mildly horrified. the following encounter had been awkward, full of harry muttering apologies and tripping over himself to get away from draco, while draco had sat, frozen, and not saying anything in return. harry had disappeared through the door, his cheeks warm and his head ducked, while draco stared after him, mouth slightly ajar.
“how honorable,” draco says. “you’d be good at that. teaching, i mean. you had that club at hogwarts during our fifth year. i heard pretty good things about it from some of the ravenclaws.”
“fuck you zabini, at least i have a relationship to care about. what are you going to do after you sleep your way through wizarding london?” draco sneers, standing from his seat. his fingers stretch towards his hip, where his wand was secured beneath his shirt.
than vernon, but the sound is satisfying nonetheless. with another flick of his wrist, vernon’s body floats into the air, and draco guides him into the front seat of the car. he takes a moment to amuse himself, placing vernon’s meaty hands on the steering wheel and then laughing when they flop off, into his lap. he looks even larger, stuffed into the tight front seat - a bit like an overstuffed turkey. he does the same for petunia, sitting her up in the passenger seat and crossing her hands tightly in her lap. he snorts as her head lolls dangerously to the side.
“draco,” she said under her breath, turning to look him in the eye. “you can do this. i love you, and everything will be fine.” she kissed his forehead before prying his hand from her arm, and tottering towards the floo. as she passed harry, she fixed him with a glare that made him shift uncomfortably.
“a companion?” draco asked, turning around. he scanned harry for a moment before his eyes fell on the lump in his side. “harry james potter,” he said lowly, grabbing his wand from beneath him and pointing it directly at harry. his eyes narrowed dangerously, and his mouth curled down. “i swear to merlin and morganna, both.”
when harry finally pulls out of draco, he whimpers at the loss, reaching for harry and whining for him to stay, if only for a moment longer. harry detangled himself from draco, covering him with a blanket and placing a gentle but lingering kiss to the corner of his mouth.
me to watch you do this to yourself.” tears surface in his eyes, but draco doesn’t bother wiping them away. his voice remains steady, even as the first tears fall to the surface of the table. harry’s eyes follow the path of one down draco’s cheek and chin, and onto a spot on the table beside draco’s spilled coffee. “i love you, harry. so much, that it honestly scares me sometimes. but i live everyday in fear that you might overdose, or take the wrong thing, or do something that’s laced… i don’t even know where you’re getting it from -”
and then he’s sobbing loudly and freely, hanging his head in shame. he leans into potter, burying his face in his hands and allowing his anger to melt away. the utter grief, the sadness that had been edging just below the surface spills over falling over draco in one long, terrible moment.
that night, in the bed that he had never gotten the opportunity to share, draco dreams of ocean breeze and open arms.
when he has has all of the dursleys in a line, whimpering and clutching each other, draco forces them down the steps, pushing them not-quite-delicately. they pause at the front door as harry disappears into the kitchen, before reappearing with a pair of keys on his finger. he tosses them to draco seamlessly as draco turns to address the muggles.
the night that everything falls apart starts like any other - except today, ginny weasley is on harry's arm. draco takes a seat across from potter instead of beside him, nursing a pint and talking absently to pansy about his week. harry doesn’t catch his eye, like he normally does, to cock his eyebrow and smirk or run his tongue over his bottom lip - his way of saying yes i remember last week, no you didn’t hallucinate it, yes i can’t wait to do it again.
when the lift finally opened, a handful of witches and wizards poured out. draco bounced politely to the side until it was empty before bounding in and jabbing the button for level two. the witch who had been waiting with him looked pointedly away and draco rolled his eyes, slamming the grate shut and setting the lift off.
when his legs tire of standing, they simply give out beneath him, and draco crashes to the ground. the smooth tile presses against his cheek, and he finds comfort in it. in a strange way, it feels a bit like being held. like being caressed, with an unforgiving hand. with harry’s cold, dead hands.
“draco, thank merlin you answered. you will not believe this... this absolute shit!” came pansy’s voice - loud with anger and frustration. draco raised an eyebrow and blinked away his sleep. pansy frequently called him in anger, but her reasonings were always entertaining and different.
“yes,” draco said, his voice small. he looked down at the ground like a scolded child, although he glanced at harry out of the corner of his eye. a small smile spread across his lips.
guilt eats at him, scratching at his insides and practically choking him. he should stay - he knows he should. they aren’t married, but in their years together they have formed an unspoken covenant, a promise, to take care of each other. when draco had been ill with dragonpox and practically delirious all those months ago, harry had taken care of him and stroked his hair and fed him molly weasley’s soup until he had finally been able to pull himself from bed. and when harry had fallen into a particularly deep depression following the fifth anniversary of the battle of hogwarts, draco had prodded him into the bath and washed his hair and scrubbed his body when he hadn't been able to find the energy to do so himself. they had seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of each other… how could draco possibly walk out on him now?
when draco enters, he finds that harry is not in the kitchen. their cat curls on the windowsill, lazily grooming herself and basking in the slowly setting afternoon sun. she opens one eye as draco approaches, her tail flicking half heartedly in his direction.
harry’s eyes flutter open slowly as he takes in draco’s presence, his lips curling down into a frown. “draco,” harry says slowly, stumbling over the name as if it’s foreign - as if he hasn’t said it thousands of times over, as if he hasn’t laughed and whispered and cried and screamed his name. “i thought… i thought you had work?”
“you all don’t understand, i - i was practically in shock. i felt like i would be sick, afterwards. at first i thought was sort of erotic, mind you. if that’s what we look like when we’re in the sack, then i’ll stop brewing right now and begin my pornography career. but then it got...emotional. he did the neck thing.” draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. his voice has lost its edge, and he sounds strangely vulnerable. “our neck thing.”
harry doesn’t look at ginny. he stares directly at draco, and if looks could kill, draco would be dead. his jaw jumps and his hands curl and the vein in his neck pops out. he's angry - so angry that his magic is jumping and popping around him, making the air crackle with electricity. draco watches him, absently wishing that he had savored the last time they had fucked. he's never going to come back from this - that much is true. he takes a sip from his drink, partly for confidence and partly for dramatic effect.
as he focuses in on draco’s arse, harry finds himself immediately transfixed. he grabbed at the fleshy globes before him, squeezing and kneading them. since the beginning of their relationship, harry had had a bit of a fixation with draco’s arse - he could (and had) spent hours kisssing, touching, and playing with it, much to the chagrin of his boyfriend.
“we can talk more about that later,” draco says quickly. “for now let’s just,” he pulls harry back down into the bed, their lips only a hair’s breadth away. “do this instead…”
for a moment, neither of them move. then, draco’s hand snakes up to harry’s shoulder and over his neck, burying itself in harry’s scalp. in response, harry’s eyes roll back into his head, a low moan escaping his throat.
“so you think i’m cheating on you?” harry asked quietly, after a moment. he stared blankly ahead towards the floor, his eyes unseeing.
“oh,” harry says quietly. his eyebrows furrow for a second before he continues, speaking directly into his mug and still not meeting draco’s eye. draco lifts his own mug and takes a small draw. “that’s wonderful, darling. i knew you could do it.”
“you know adam, the man i’ve been seeing recently? well, last week we went on an amazing date, and i thought everything was great! we’ve been texting and calling back and forth, so i was under the impression that we were on the same page, right? so yesterday, i decided to show up to his apartment as a sort of surprise. draco, i even wore lingerie under my robes!”
“draco…” he says softly, turning to look down at him. his eyes swim with worry, and draco’s breath catches. there’s love, and the desire to protect in andrew’s eyes. andrew, who draco lives with. andrew, who will only be a few feet away, should draco need him.
as he passes the couch, draco pulls off his glasses and catches harry’s eye, fixing him with a glare so deadly that he stops in his tracks.
he checked the garden next - he had, on more than one occasion,  found harry lying in the soft grass, surrounded by the flowers and with his face towards the sun, letting it warm his skin. the first time draco had found him this way, with his eyes closed and his body eerily still, he had panicked and dropped to his knees, feeling a lump in his throat grow and grief set into his bones as he grasped at harry’s body. the panic had lasted for a mere second, and then harry had opened one eye and cocked an eyebrow and made draco feel very, very stupid.
because he doesn’t hate potter. not at all. he loves him - so much so that he thinks his heart will swell and crush his lungs and suffocate him to death. now, even that would be preferable - a victim of love and passion, rather than heartbreak and lies.
“what did you think had happened?” he had laughed as he pulled draco down for a kiss, his finger pushing a lock of hair behind draco’s ear. draco had kissed back eagerly, willing his pounding heart to slow.
draco roars, shoving harry away and drawing his wand. his voice trembles, but his wand hand remains steady and trained on his father.
, to allow harry to survive the night. he had, and things had gone back to normal, and draco had pretended that he didn’t see that shivering, sickly version of harry each time he looked at him. when he opens his mouth to speak again, the words escape in a broken sob. “i’m so tired, harry. i’m tired, and i’m scared. i’m watching you kill yourself, and it’s killing me.”
“harry, baby, you’re saying so many things right now. and i’m sure they’re wonderful things. but, all i can think about right now is your big d -” harry clapped a hand over draco’s mouth, cringing as the couple hurried down the hallway, and away from them.
it had been about a month prior - harry had requested that draco meet him in some large field, miles away from everything else. there, he had pulled draco onto a broom  with him, with harry steering and draco clutching his torso, his face buried in the crook of harry’s neck. it had been so reminiscent of the first and last time he had been on a broom with harry - fiendfyre licking at the soles of their shoes and terror gripping both of them. this was different in every possible way. harry flew slowly at first, talking gently to draco all the while as he flew them over the countryside. eventually, draco had been able to open his eyes and enjoy the view, and stop chewing on his lip long enough to actually hold a conversation with potter. he had kept his nose buried in harry’s shoulder, though, savouring his scent, and the way that it felt like home.
he was in the kitchen preparing dinner when the phone rang. he rushes over to it, drying his hands and fumbling with the mobile for a moment before putting it to his ear.
it was one of harry’s favorite movies, and he had been particularly adamant that they watched it now. draco hadn’t cared very much - the telly fascinated him despite what was on it.
“pity, that.” draco murmured, putting harry’s mug down on the coffee table before relaxing back into his spot. he takes a draw of his hot chocolate, his eyes fluttering shut as he lost himself in the perfection of the moment.
. draco had seen him before, in real life. he was one of the interns in the auror office, and frequently ran errands for harry. the boy was small, and waifish, and looked distinctly like an elf with his curly brown hair and comically blue eyes. the idea of harry actually seeing, or worse, interacting with simon today made draco gulp painfully, completely abandoning his cold tea and half finished slice of toast.
as draco paced the study, he heard the familiar sounds of harry moving throughout the house as he prepared for the day. a part of draco - the same part that told him that he was being irrational, longed to be beside him. harry treasured his routines, and since draco had moved in, things had always been the same.
after a few moments, he pulls away, obviously having pulled himself together. draco turns and summons his wand into his hand, his face melting into a determined line once more. he begins casting again - this time, spells that harry doesn’t recognize… dark, foreign spells. lucius sobs and writhes with pain on the ground, his body contorting under draco’s ministrations. the spells draco uses are decidedly horrific, and harry makes a mental note to ask draco when and where he learned so many terrible spells. harry hears all of the bones in lucius’ body break with a deafening snap, before healing all at once in an undoubtedly painful second. he chokes on his own tongue, practically going blue as he struggles to breathe, and then begins bleeding from his nose, lips, and eyes uncontrollably.
hermione tuned out the rest of his sentence as she made her way to the front of the crowd once more with ron by her side. the healers who had been working on harry before had stepped to the side - only the old man in white robes remained - both of his hands pressed to harry’s chest as he murmured under his breath. everyone in the room seemed to be holding their breath - and several of the healers were clutching each other.
and then pockets her wand when their home is declared safe. the ensuing transition from stoic deputy head auror to a friend is instantaneous - pansy pulls off her robes, once again displaying her gorgeous gown, and kicks off her strappy heels before sweeping from the sitting room and into the kitchen. they find her sat on one of the stools, sipping from a glass of wine and gesturing with one finger to the two identical glasses sat on the other side of the island.
“draco, darling,” she murmured after a long while. draco was leaning into her side heavily, although his sobs had quieted to gentle sniffles punctuated with hearty swigs. “what’s wrong?”
draco looks up at harry, his heart pounding in his chest. “harry,” he chokes, his fingers curling against the smooth wood of the tabletop. “you destroyed me.”
draco’s almost convinced that if he stands and walks into the bathroom, he’ll find harry floating in the bathtub, slipped just below the surface of the water, his hair floating around his serene face ethereally. he’ll go down the stairs and find harry at the foot of them, passed out in a puddle of his own sick, already having asphyxiated. in the kitchen, harry will slump against the counter, blood pooling around his limp body. and in the garden, he’ll find harry, splayed across the carpet of lush green grass, his face tilted towards the sun, unmoving.
“it’s called best friends club. the lyrics are still a work in progress, but here’s what i’ve got so far.
“your sexual prowess,” draco murmured, pulling harry into another kiss. he reached down and grasped his face gently, his thumbs gently stroking harry’s smooth skin as he kissed his soft lips again and again.
blaise’s eyebrow shoots up at this, and he runs his hands down his front, as if straightening his clothing. “draco, darling,” he practically purred, adopting a tone draco hadn’t had directed at himself in years, “forget about boy-wonder. let’s go away together. i can take you anywhere you’d like. milan, greece, new york city…” he reaches out to take draco’s hand, and was rewarded with a pert slap on the wrist.
he’s angry, so angry with himself and with harry. he shouldn’t be able to get through the wards - shouldn’t know how to unlock draco’s door. these are small, intimate gestures, reserved only for those closest to an individual. a wizards’ home is practically an extension of themselves - it’s the place where a person is most vulnerable. giving someone uninhibited access to your home is on par with a serious relationship, or marriage in pureblood culture.
draco was overly excited about it, and was quietly very pleased with himself. harry had mentioned missing vaccines as a young child offhandedly months ago, and the idea had taken hold of draco and refused to let go. the potion worked, in a way, similairlly to polyjuice potion, by analysing the genetic composition of the drinker and creating antibodies from traces of any illness or allergy.
he’s beautiful, in an effortless kind of way - a way that takes draco‘s breath away and makes his heart pound recklessly in his chest. his expression is open, and trusting - and it’s not because of the alcohol. his eyes shine clear and bright towards draco, not at all inhibited or hidden away by those clunky frames that he refused to get rid of. his hair is wild, as per usual, but in the artfully tousled way that he has mastered a few years back. his soft pink lips are turned up into a playful smile, because he already knows exactly what draco is about to say.
draco took a deep drag from his blunt as he leaned back in his chair, watching as the smoke curled into the air and dissipated. his eyes closed slowly, the familiar burn in his chest soothing rather than upsetting him. when the pain faded, he took another pull, this one smaller than the first. this time, he held the smoke in for a bit, releasing it in a steady stream of smoke that made him smile.
“whenever you’re ready, minister,” pansy said lowly, making eye contact with harry and nodding seriously. it’s almost funny to draco, the way that pansy effortlessly transformed from his best friend into a stoic, austere deputy auror who wouldn’t hesitate to put a man flat on his back. this pansy, with her red lipstick and her narrowed eyes, is nothing like the pansy who spends weekends curled on their couch, hogging a bottle of wine and snorting with laughter.
“stop,” harry says forcefully, whirling around. he grabs draco's wrists, restraining him. “stop this, malfoy.”
a singular tear fell from draco’s eye and he reached up to wipe it away. with a sniff, he continued, his voice significantly weaker.
there was harry, wearing his red auror robes and looking absolutely kissable. all of draco’s prior negative thoughts melted away as he stared up at harry, wanting him,
they stand in the garden for a long while - holding each other close and occasionally kissing but mostly standing in silence, leaning into each other. draco drinks in the novelty of the moment - belatedly realizing that he hasn’t felt this happy, or this at peace in ages.
draco had read a book by dostoevsky at some point during the war - when he hadn't been trembling in fear in the dining room, he had spent a fair amount of time curled in his bed, slowly making his way through piles of old books that he had pilfered from the manor library. the brothers karamasov had been, by far, one of his favorites - he had filled the book with annotations and highlights over all of his favorite quotes, and to this day, still had the same copy in his study at home, tucked away but never forgotten. there had been a particular quote that had stuck with him for weeks after reading it - a paragraph on the difference between active love and the love of dreams. active love, according to fyodor (as draco liked to call him in his head. privately, he liked to think of fyodor as a friend - even if he was a long-dead muggle russian writer.), was a labor and something all-encompassing, incorrigible, and almost harsh in nature. love in the dreams was whimsical and gentle, and tender - it was a mother’s hand on a bassinet, gently rocking her baby to sleep. when draco sees harry - sees the scars that litter his body, the grey streaking his thick hair, the determination in his eyes after a long day of arguing or campaigning for some cause or the other. he thinks about harry’s hand against his cheek, always gentle, of the soft, playful smile on his lips when he listens to teddy’s long-winded stories about his days at hogwarts and his adventures with the other hufflepuffs, of his eyes, striking and familiar but never unkind - and he marvels at the walking paradox that is harry potter. no man, especially not one that had been through so much at such a young age, should have the capacity to hold that much love - to have been wronged so many times by the world yet still wake every morning with the passion to save it. but harry does. he cares deeply, limitlessly, for everyone he comes into contact with, and has been hurt time and time again by those tasked with the easiest thing of all - loving him, and caring for him. yet, he remains soft and open, and able to love.
“you’ve got sweets?” pansy asked, glancing at him from over her phone. “don’t be a twat, give one here. i’m watching my figure, but i’m sure one little candy won’t hurt.” it is then that pansy looks up at his face, and notices the abject horror crossing it. his lip trembles as he stares down at the peppermint, suddenly feeling increasingly nauseous. “draco,” pansy says, pocketing her cellphone. draco wants to push her away, to warn her that his muffin is soon to make a reappearance based on the way his stomach turns at the sight of the candy. instead, he stands stock still, staring down at his shaking hand. “what’s wrong?”
“drink,” harry pressed, cupping his hands around draco’s and pushing the mug to his lips. draco obeyed, inhaling the strong aroma of the tea before taking a deep sip. he cringed at the taste - he had never liked peppermint as much as harry seemed to, and only enjoyed the taste when he picked it up from harry’s own mouth with a swipe of his tongue. harry watched eagerly as draco finished the mug, grinning proudly all the while. “good?” he asked as draco finished, taking the mug from him and setting it on the coffee table.
“oh, isn’t this just beautiful?” he was crowing to an elderly witch with sagging jowls and heavily lidded eyes. “hermione is a dear friend of mine - she’s always had a passion for magical creatures, even when we were back at hogwarts. gryffindor house, of course,” draco snorted softly, and harry nudged him with the toe of his shoe. “what house was it that you were in, mrs. higgs?”
“the cottage,” harry breathes, leaning forward and resting his head on draco’s shoulder. “our cottage,” he repeats again, even softer.
“i made sure to pay attention, mr.malfoy. you can review my memories whenever necessary.” he said as soon as they were out of earshot of the room. “i saw your eyes glaze over when he started to talk about fruit and vegetable exports.”
as she held up her hands in a shrug, draco felt himself drawn to his feet. absently, he obeyed his subconscious and stood.
“i’m fine,” draco said, standing. his vision doubled, and he lurched as he lost his balance. “nevermind,” he sunk down into his seat again, brushing off the worrying hands of both jackson and hermione.
he tells draco about his first weasley family dinner since that night, about the forgiveness they’ve shown him, and about how he’s still not sure if he deserves it.
for a second, potter didn’t say anything, and draco froze, fearing that he had gone too far. draco bit the inside of his check, cursing himself silently. draco was a marked ex-death eater, and potter was the darling of the ministry and an auror, and full within his rights to arrest draco under the suspicion of his involvement with dark magic. and draco had just, stupidly, basically confessed to still practicing dark magic, which he
he laughs through his tears at the implication - at the idea of harry ever needing to psych himself up to propose to draco. even now, draco loved harry completely, with every ounce of his being. he would’ve had to have been a fool to do anything other than immediately say yes - and draco was no fool.
draco stood at the sink, manually cracking eggs into a bowl, while harry had leaned heavily onto the counter and tried not to fall back asleep. draco hummed to himself softly as he vanished the egg shells until something outside of the window caught his eye. he squinted as the owl came closer, his eyebrows furrowed curiously. draco opened the window just as the large bird came to a rest on the sill, blinking patiently at them. its body was covered in black and grey feathers, and it’s beak was a bright yellow.
harry unlocked the door with a wave of his hand, and paused once more in the doorway, peering into the darkness. draco stands beside him, uncharacteristically patient. after a moment, harry moves forward slowly,  stopping once again at the foot of the stairs. he places a shaky hand on the rail, seemingly leaning on it.
he spread draco apart, drinking in the sight of his tight, furled hole - small, pink, and perfect. even now, after almost three years of dating, harry still wasn’t sure if or how draco kept himself so pristine - he had never once mentioned a shaving charm, yet his arse remained unblemished and perfect.
“this isn’t your fault, draco,” harry murmured, pulling draco into his lap. he went easily, burying his face in harry’s shoulder and wrapping his arms around his neck. “you haven’t done anything wrong.”
told draco that harry would be waking up within the next few minutes. his stomach had yet to settle, and he felt as if he would either throw up or cry.
“so you woke me up at seven in the morning to… swing?” draco had asked, his eye already twitching. “harry, i don’t have time for this.”
she immediately doubles over, wrapping her arms around a wheezing draco and entangling their fingers, her grip on his waist so severe that it makes him wince. she’s afraid, that much is obvious in her shaking voice and fingers. draco’s not sure if she fears for her own life or for his, and the thought makes him want to cry again.
as harry finishes with irma higgs and sets his sights on another, equally old, equally boring, and equally loaded donor, draco pulls away.
he sleeps on their couch, covered with a warm blanket that molly had knit them a few years ago. he watches rose as she crawls around their living room and holds her to his chest when she seems to have exhausted ron and hermione with her crying. he spends a large majority of his time drifting between sleep and wakefulness, yet is unable to escape the exhaustion that weighs on his shoulders.
there’s a pause, and draco runs his eyes over his friends - blaise and goyle slumped in their chairs disinterestedly, and pansy with both of her elbows propped on the table, staring across at draco. his eyes stray to the overturned lube bottle, and he reaches out, picking it up and turning it about.
“no! no, i would never! this is just… it’s just a fear of mine. i don’t want to lose him.” he bit out, ignoring the flush rising in his neck. “and i’m afraid of him finding someone better than me.”
“wait, adam, just - wait a moment. i’ll call you back.” hermione quickly hung up, rushing after the wizards in lime robes. “excuse me!” she shouted, breaking into a run. one of the healers turned around, her eyes scanning hermione’s face as realization dawned over her.
“it’s just a kiss,” harry said resolutely, pulling away. he began to undo the remaining buttons on draco’s top - getting almost to the bottom before draco distracted him with another kiss.
potter was rooting through his robe pockets, patting at his chest and thighs before seemingly finding what he was looking for. he pulled out a small peppermint candy, encased in a clear plastic wrapper.
“well, maybe i can still go.” harry said suddenly, effectively destroying draco’s peace. “a little bit of snow never hurt anyone. would just soften the ground if anything.” suddenly much happier than he had been all morning, harry turned away from the window, practically skipping towards the stairs.
it had been fairly easy to find the spot. there were wildflowers growing in one lone circle, as if the forest spirits had enchanted it. other gifts of nature were also in the pile - polished rocks and sparkling leafs and smooth sticks. the sunlight seemed to filter through the tall trees and shine directly on the small patch, dancing across the grass and creating strange shapes.
harry’s cock. lost in the sensation, harry buried his hands in draco’s hair - whimpering all the while.
draco had packed all of his meager possessions and taken the first portkey he could, thanking granger and weasley profusely and promising to be back.
the garden is by far draco’s favorite place in his house - large, spacious, and bursting with life. the grass is soft and lush, and even now draco stands in it, barefoot and at peace. there are tear stains down his cheeks, but the sun warms his face and allows him to forget about his troubles for just a few moments. he walks around the garden slowly, staring blankly at his plants, his mind, and his heart, a few feet away, sitting at his kitchen table. this is how harry finds him, a few minutes later - barefoot and staring up at the sky.
draco pushes open their bedroom door, a faint smile already spreading across his lips. he’s missed harry, so much, and can’t wait for this uncomfortable, dry spell to finally be over with -
“oh,” draco says, looking down. “how did you find me?” it had been a fear of his for a long time - the idea that harry would show up to wherever he was, tearing down wards or breaking through doors, just to get through to draco. and here he was, standing on draco’s doorstep as if he had a right to be there.
it takes mere moments for the goal to be reached - the scale is tipped by a young donor that leans in just a bit too close and laughs just a bit too hard when harry makes the same half-hearted joke that he had told nearly half of the donors in attendance. nonetheless, the goal is met - a shower of golden sparks fall over the crowd, who clap and laugh jovially. in the midst of it all, hermione beams impossibly harder than before, her hands clasped in harry’s. draco doesn’t see ron leave the table, but he does see him take hermione into his arms and twirl her around, and he hears her shrill giggle from all the way across the room.
it was one of draco’s favorite parts of harry’s body, the line of his jaw. he had spent what felt like centuries watching harry from across the table at the pub, fantasizing about what it would be like to press his lips to the skin there, to cup his face gently and not be shoved away. it had taken years for draco to get his chance - but he had held tight to harry and refused to let him go after that first fateful kiss. he had been privately infatuated with harry for almost three years before the opportunity had revealed itself - harry had taken advantage of his social and political influence for the first time and publicly pushed for the end of non-death eater slytherin persecution following a particularly weighty conversation between he and draco about the fact that almost all of the slytherins had fled the country post-war to escape retribution. weeks later, a bill had been passed, pardoning non-death eater slytherins and officially redeeming them, accompanied by a stirring anonymous letter in the prophet from the point of view of a persecuted slytherin, detailing their harrowing experiences after the war despite having had family members from different houses who fought valiantly on the side of the order. soon thereafter, pansy parkinson had returned to london from france - and after draco had finally stopped sniveling into her blouse, he had apparated directly into harry’s flat and kissed him full on the lips. it had been almost ten years since that night, full of tears and heated kisses and adolescent groping  - and draco still constantly found himself marveling at how far they had come. as hermione finally wrapped up her speech with a profound tagline that draco knew would be in the papers come tomorrow morning - “
and then he was gone, rushing down the stairs and through the floo, while draco readjusted in bed and pulled harry’s still-warm pillow to his face. draco’s sleep-addled brain made it easy to not think about where harry was going, or worry about the possibility of danger for very long.  he fell asleep quickly, lulled back into unconsciousness by the comfortable and welcoming warmth of the duvet.
without another word, harry pulls apart draco’s legs, squeezing at his arse cheeks playfully before lowering himself between them. he places a soft kiss at the base of draco’s spine, leaving a trail down, down, down, all the way to the crease of his thigh. his cock hangs heavily between his legs, it’s rosy head glistening with arousal.
a few of the aurors giggled at that, but harry quickly fixed the room with a glare that silenced everyone.
he hadn’t smelled amortentia in years - the last time had been when he was a teenager, and nursing a heavy crush on blaise. the potion had smelled of musky cologne, cigars, aftershave, and leather, as well as carrying hints of more familiar scents, like the smell of his fresh linen and home. he waits for the potion to finish with shaky hands and a rebellious stomach, anxiety gripping him and almost sending him over the edge.
as with ginny, harry doesn’t respond. he does however, look down at his lap, his fingers curling and uncurling menacingly. hermione gasps wetly and stands as well, her chair dragging equally loudly against the floor. she hurries away, her head down and her steps quick. ron follows her, but not before shooting harry, a truly murderous glare.
“so, naturally i pushed inside and went to the bedroom… there were five people in the bed. five! and adam just smiled up at me like a complete arsehole, and asked if i wanted to join in. imagine that. me, participating in his freaky little sex party. ugh, i swear to merlin, i’m taking a break from dating. how does this shit always happen to me?”
“tea?” draco asks, because he doesn’t know what else to say. even after all this time, his pureblood manners remained steadfast, pushing him to be the perfect host. even if it is to harry potter.
“do you think you can duel me, boy?” lucius goads, finishing off his drink and rising from his seat slowly, also drawing his wand. “and win? i guess you’ve taken more than one thing from potter… this gryffindorian recklessness. you’ll soon realize that not everyone has the same astronomical luck as your
draco envied harry of the way that he wasn’t selfish or shy with his love. he both told and showed draco constantly how much he loved him, and also made sure that their kids knew how much they were adored and treasured. it extended past their immediate family as well - harry didn’t hesitate to pull hermione into his arms and press a kiss to the top of her head whenever they saw each other, nor to clap ron on the back or ruffle his hair.
a howl ripped from draco’s mouth before he could stop himself - a loud, angry sound that perfectly encapsulated all of the fury, frustration, and grief that he felt. a wave of emotion washed over draco at that moment, brining him to his knees with the force of it.
“hermione,” he whispers, his eyes wide with fear. harry could step back in at any second, pretending to ask how much sugar draco would like in his tea, but really just checking in to make sure that draco hasn’t tried to escape or tell hermione something. if he did, harry would probably throw all caution to the wind and kill draco right on the spot, and then obliviate hermione.
the person at the door laughs - a soft, familiar laugh that sends a chill down draco’s spine and leaves him frozen in shock.
“harry!” she shouts, rushing forward and shoving him away from draco. draco doubles over, attempting to catch his breath in deep, heart wrenching sobs. “harry, what are you doing?”
around him, their loved ones all seem to be grieving in their own way. the few group gatherings that draco had attended since harry’s death had been downright depressing - with a different person ducking away from the table every few moments and coming back with damp eyes, or with everyone getting just a bit too drunk. connections fortified by the war seemed to waver in the face of loss - which draco thought was terribly ironic. death and destruction had bought them all closer than ever - yet it was that same force that seemed to be tearing at each of them individually.
draco taps a gentle rhythm against the rim of his mug, his eyes dampening. he curses himself silently. the last thing he wants to do is cry in front of harry again, to let him know just how much control he has over draco and his emotions.
he could imagine it now - the creatures of the forbidden forest all coming to visit harry potter on his death bed - using their nature magic to ensure that he passed without pain. in a strange way, it comforted draco. the healers had explained to him that the painkillers had rendered him unable to feel anything - but muggle medicine was foreign and confusing to draco. he understood magic - the way a simple touch could go so far in making someone feel better.
the looks they shared now were familiar and good, and lacking in passion but never warmth. surprising harry - whether it involved sneaking up behind him and covering his eyes, or peeling off his robes to reveal inches of lacy fabric and miles of soft skin - always made that original awe return, if only for a second. today had already been wonderful - having harry look at him like he had hung the sun for just a few moments would only be the frosting on the cake.
“alright, pans,” he says, reaching over and taking harry’s hand. “‘ve got to get him to bed before he keels over.” harry smiles gratefully over at him, and nods bashfully at pansy. she takes the dismissal in stride, standing and grabbing her shoes before leaning over the island to press a kiss to both of their cheeks. the floo roars mere moments after she leaves the kitchen - and then they are alone. “come,” he murmurs quietly to harry, pulling him gently towards the stairs.
he can’t believe that he’s doing this, hurting harry this way. he doesn’t think that he’s ever wanted to hex himself more than right now, as he watched harry’s shoulders knit together with tension, and his hands slowly ball into fists at his sides. more than anything, draco wished he had just brushed aside the stupid, fucking dream.
harry sighed softly as draco settled into place beside him, their bodies curving around each other instinctively, as they did every night.
but today, draco had gone before a review board, and finally been approved to begin his first round of experimental trials. he had immediately shut down his lab for the day and rushed home, eager to finally share the secret he had been keeping for months now.
“it’s amazing,” ron mused quietly - draco turned to him with an arched eyebrow. he was still watching hermione, although his eyes flickered over to harry, at her side. “they both knew nothing about this world, or magic, twenty years ago… and now they navigate it like they’ve been doing it their entire lives. harry’s the bloody minister - still can’t believe that, by the way, and ‘mione… she’s amazing.”
“you horny bastard,” draco grins, not even attempting to hide his blush. he can feel harry’s erection beneath him - he had felt it when it first started grow, seconds after draco had straddled him. his own cock begins to harden between them, and harry’s grin grows as he notices.
“no, you tosser!” draco snapped, glaring at blaise. “i wasn’t involved in the situation, at all. and if we were going to have a threesome, why not do it in our own bed? they were in his office, in the dark, fully clothed. it was obviously a quickie.”
“drew,” draco says softly, touching the small of his back. he stops abruptly and sighs before turning and moving out of the way. he fixes draco with a long, hard look, and draco tips his chin up so that drew can catch him in a gentle kiss.
for a while, draco sat on the ground in the garden, staring up at the sky. the sun had begun to set, and it was steadily growing colder, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. as the sky melted into beautiful shades of blue and pink, draco stared up, drinking in the sight and committing it to memory.
he tells draco about writing a lot of sincere letters and weathering a handful of hexes before being pulled in for a long hug and kiss on the cheek from ginny. he tells draco about coming out to ron and hermione, about hermione tearfully telling him that she loves him and accepts him, but hates what he did to ginny, and about ron telling harry that he doesn’t forgive him but that he does love him. he tells draco about crying to them for a long time, about falling asleep in their bed with them like a child, about them letting him because they know that he needs it.
what he does know is that last night, he ruined both his and harry's lives - and that there’s absolutely nothing he can do to fix it.
except, harry can’t hurt hermione. she’s a powerful witch, she’s his friend, and she’s not his to hurt. besides, the only person he hates enough to do what he does is draco. he knows that if he refuses, she’ll be suspicious. and so he nods and smiles tightly, shooting draco a look that very clearly means,
harry laughed into his mouth, wrapping his arms around draco and pulling him closer. “well, that was easy.“
lucius stills as draco stops, gasping for breath and glaring over at both of them, the disgust and hatred clear on his face.
“i don’t expect anything from you.'' harry says, and this wraps around draco tight, and squeezes him. it’s so similar to what harry had said that night ‘i don’t want anything with you’, but then it had been laced with malice and practically cruel. now, draco resists the temptation to purr as harry speaks to him, his words soft and sweet as satin. now, harry wants with dracom this much is obvious. but he doesn’t demand it. draco has the power - the ability to break both of their hearts. “but my god, it was so real. every moment. it was never fake, i was never fake with you.”
when harry would stand before the mirror and don his auror robes, draco would watch from the bed, his tongue running over his lips as he admired the way harry’s wand holster gripped his muscular thighs, and the way his t-shirt stretched across his wide shoulders. in the kitchen, draco would always prop himself up on the counter, nursing a mug of coffee and a slice of toast, while harry bit into a bagel and spooned eggs into his mouth.
harry stares up at him, shaking his head slowly. “if,” he begins, his brow furrowing. “if you loved me -”
“i'm here,” harry murmurs, pulling away and pressing his forehead to draco’s. “i’m here, i’m real. i’m yours.”
draco swallows and moves a bit closer to harry, their fingers brushing in the small space between them.
“malfoy,” harry says, rough and cruel. he's glaring at draco now, as if they’re back at hogwarts and ready to kill each other.
“does harry know that she knows everything?” asked goyle, who had apparently taken up the role of president of the harry potter fan club today.
“thank you, all,” he whispers, his voice hoarse and weak. he can feel his body beginning to give out completely, and inhales shakily as he attempts to gather enough strength to finish his thought. “for loving me. i -” he trails off, a sudden dampness gathering in his eyes. he’s too weak to blink them away, so they fall. “i love you.” it’s specific, but he sees as it passes over each and every person in the room. and then, they’re all talking over each other, as disorganized and chaotic as always, making jokes and crying and touching him. he drinks it in, their love and affection and care, and savors it as his eyes flutter shut for the last time.
a voice in the back of his head, one that sounded suspiciously like harry, gently prodded at him until he turned around and walked away slowly and steadily, without a backwards glance.
“as you know and loathe,” harry continues, leaning over lucius and dropping his voice to a whisper. “i
“goodnight, draco,” harry murmured, already half asleep and drowsy. he wrapped an arm around draco’s waist and pulled him even closer, breathing deeply into his neck. “mmm, love you so much.”
“not important,” he breathes, pulling harry down onto the bed with him. they bounce a bit and roll, but draco keeps his arm around harry's waist, close to him. “kiss me,”
“i haven’t spoken to hermione in years. says she hates me, won’t forgive me for what i did to you.” he continues. draco had already known this - granger had said as much in their letters and phone calls over the years. her grandfather had been terribly abusive to her grandmother, hitting and disrespecting her constantly, both in front her her mother and behind closed doors. she had told him about the way her mother had always been a bit standoffish and proved to be difficult to love at times, a left-over side-effect of witnessing terrible abuse as a child. she wouldn’t forgive harry, ever, and would always feel guilty for not noticing something in draco earlier. “i haven’t been allowed to see teddy. the weasley’s have only just started to speak to me again. ron, not so much.” he had expected this - he had never been too close with any of them, and they had probably been more abhorred at the idea of harry being so upset than they had been at the idea of harry beating draco. “don’t think i’ll be invited to the burrow for dinner any time soon. it’s been hard -” suddenly, draco wishes that pansy were here with him. she would swear harry within an inch of his life, in both english and french, and then probably hex him for daring to make this situation about himself. “but i know i deserve it,”
ginny stands from the table, her chair scraping loudly against the floor. she glares down at both of them, her lip quivering minutely. she’s about to cry, that much is obvious - but seems to not want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they’ve upset her. draco takes it anyways. when she reaches across the table and slaps him, he’s half expecting it. he doesn’t flinch, simply stares up at her with a blank expression. he looks stupid, he knows, with the bright pink handprint that must be on the side of his face. but, his pride trumps all. draco reaches forward and grabs a full shot from the table, knocking it back and settling into his seat, looking every inch the cocky bastard they all think he is.
draco doesn’t respond - instead, he flinches backwards and hangs his head, obviously overcome with emotion. unwilling to resist the temptation anymore, harry moved forward to place a gentle hand on the small of his back, glaring at lucius over his shoulder. lucius stares back at him, a terrible smirk on his face.
he had said it so easily, and his fingers had been so tempting - pulling at draco’s clothes. his mouth had been so warm, all over draco’s throat and jaw. so he had pushed the idea aside, comforted by the idea that ginny weasley was also out and about, flirting and hooking up with strangers. they didn’t talk much about her after that - she didn’t often attend pub nights, and when she did she and harry acted deceptively casual. they didn’t kiss, or touch, or even really talk to each other very much.
“i’ll be back,” he said gruffly, turning on his heel and marching for the door. draco chased him - slowed by the blanket wrapped around his legs. as harry disappeared through the front door, draco shouted in frustration - grabbing at a plate from the dining table and chucking it at the front door. as it shattered, draco turned away, stomping back into the living room.
“it’s quite loud in here,” neville called over the music. he looked extremely out of place among the short dresses and spilling drinks, and it was obvious that given the opportunity, he would leave as soon as possible.
he grins at harry indulgently as he presses the wand to his lips again, before loudly calling out, “it is my honor to introduce your minister for magic, mister harry james potter, order of merlin, first-class - accompanied by senior international magical liaison, mister draco lucius malfoy-potter,”
“oh, can he hear me? that must mean... oh, draco! things must be okay, then.” she pauses, and draco can hear her shit-eating grin through the phone. “things must be
at first, they had ignored each other's presence. it had been fairly easy - with people like luna and lavender and seamus at the table, forgetting potter’s existence was a simple task. and then potter had begun talking directly to him - making stupid jokes and daring draco to try whatever disgusting drink he could convince the barkeep to throw together. they became tentative friends - smiling and laughing together and doing their very best to not think about the fact that they had almost killed each other a handful of times.
she spun on her heel, practically running back to the lift. there was a couple standing there already waiting, and they glanced at her with concern in their eyes. hermione looked away, wiping away a tear from her cheek. throughout the journey back to the pediatric floor, hermione continued to replay the image of harry lying in the hospital bed, and the sight of his lifeless arm hanging from the bed.
“so what then, boy!” vernon spat, glaring over at harry. “you and your boyfriend here bought us all the way out here, for what? to mess with us… to show us a freaky magic trick?”
and now, potter was standing beside draco, trying to make small talk. wonders never ceased. draco turned to look at him, arching an eyebrow and donning a polite smile. it simply wouldn’t do to spar with potter tonight, whether that be verbally or physically.
“the house-elves like her quite a bit more now that she’s stopped trying to free them and instead focuses on their quality of life,” harry responds. it had taken hermione a while to understand some of the intricacies of wizarding culture, such as the existence of house-elves. of course, the abuse that they experience, mostly at the hands of wealthy purebloods, was inexcusable and immoral. what she hadn’t realized was that many families treated their house-elves with respect and fair treatment, or that house-elves required a human or ancestral home to tether their magic and life force to. upon learning this, she had reshaped her passion for equality to focus on the just treatment of all creatures. thus, the society for the protection of underprivileged magical creatures or, alternatively,
draco listed them off, punctuating his sentence with a customary glare at jackson, which meant that anything said in his presence was to be repeated only under the strongest of crucios. the more people that knew about their maturing bond, the more dangerous things were for draco, but especially harry. if the word were to get out that he wasn’t at 100% magical capability… draco shuddered at the implications.
touching, for them, had always been something mutually treasured. it wasn’t uncommon to find them wrapped around each other - whether that be curled together in an armchair at the burrow during a sunday dinner, or in their own kitchen, with harry leaning over draco’s shoulder as he stirred the contents of a pot. however, public events often called for them to limit their touching to nothing more than occasional hand-holding if the moment called for it. rarely, they even got the opportunity to share a kiss outside of the confines of their own home. it’s a special kind of torture, harry thought, designed specifically to make him hate holding office even more.
in place of actual words. slowly, he had come out of his shell and grown in confidence in both himself and what he was saying. now, his speeches flowed naturally and it was often draco that had to pull him away from conversations, rather than the other way around. however, his newfound confidence wasn’t necessary most of the time. a great deal of harry’s conversations were naturally carried by the other party - he need only nod along and respond reflexively in order to keep any sort of dialogue going. when he was just harry potter, and even more so now that he was minister, people seem desperate for his time or attention, even when they have nothing of consequence to say for themselves. and yet, harry indulges them - listening carefully and smiling politely and shaking hands and doing a decent job of pretending to not be irritated or exhausted. privately, draco didn't blame the public for the way they responded to harry. draco himself had clamored for harry’s attention since the first time they had met - there was something about having those bottle-green eyes on you that made your heart skip a beat, and caused your breath to catch for just a moment. even now, years later, draco still found himself thrown off-kilter when harry stared at him for too long - often blushing and looking away with a murmured,
today, harry had done all of these things alone - while draco had trembled in the safety of his study, practically wearing a hole in the carpeting.
“just a bit,” hermione said leaning forward with a slight smile. “we’re so close to our goal!” and then, she grabbed harry’s arm and whisked away. draco glanced up at the board - sure enough, they were less than a thousand galleons away from the goal - which was set at a whopping one million galleons. harry had balked at the number when hermione had mentioned it, while draco had questioned why she hadn’t asked for even more - he had grown up seeing his parents donate massive amounts of gold to different organizations, throwing their weight and bank account around to get in good with some of the most powerful politicians in the wizarding world.
the man was ridiculously predictable - it wasn’t feasible that he’d randomly pick up a mistress. it would disrupt his entire daily routine. however, he was also wealthy, powerful, and bloody attractive... it was entirely possible for someone to have wormed their way into his heart (and pants), the same way draco had.
draco appears in the doorway of the bathroom, watching harry carefully. he twirls his wand deftly between his fingers, occasionally thwacking the end against his thigh. he looks deceptively casual, as if he’s simply waiting for harry so that they can go pick up a few groceries, or go visit their friends.
his hair is longer now, tied back in a messy bun that is much more attractive than it should be. his shoulders are broader, and he looks a bit taller, somehow. he looks fit, and happy, and draco hates him for it.
“slut,” goyle repeated, looking out the corner of his eye. blaise looked somewhat offended, but said nothing. “we’re malfoy’s friends.”
he had slumped one day, defeated, outside of a bakery, tearing at a chocolate muffin when the idea had struck. he asked the young till worker for the manager, a friendly old wizard with a shiny bald head - and had left two hours later with an apron and a new job.
“right,” harry laughed again, and draco decided that it was his new favorite sound. “want a peppermint?”
harry laughed loudly at something on the telly, and draco couldn’t hold back his annoyed exhale. harry noticed, and flicked his wand again, muting the television. draco’s headache slightened marginally, and he suddenly felt guilty about releasing his frustration.
harry stares down at draco, his body still trembling with the force of his orgasm. he takes in his lover - debauched and covered in his essence. draco looks messy and used - and harry doesn’t think he’s ever loved him more. he’ll have to clean him up, before everything dries and becomes annoyingly sticky. but for now, he savours the image.
“what are you thinking about?” harry asked, lying on his back and turning his head to look at draco.
“tomorrow,” he choked, his nails digging painfully into harry’s arms as he leaned heavily into him, staggering under the weight of his own grief. “tomorrow, we’ll go.”
draco turns and takes one last long at his father, before glancing up at harry. his eyes are still  damp, swimming with unshed tears, and his nose and lips are a soft pink. harry pulls him in for a gentle kiss, his palm coming to rest on his cheek. then, draco pulls away and sweeps from the room, pulling the door shut behind him.
“That’s not what I meant!” Harry blurted. “It’s just—it was fine, Draco. I didn’t hate it. I just wanted you to have a good time, and so maybe I’m not, I don’t know, comfortable with
“I love you,” Harry said, because it was true and he wanted Draco to know, and because the witch and wizard in the book hadn’t said it and had broken up over it  and it was stupid. “I love you.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, not really wanting to get into this debate, with someone like Malfoy—landed gentry, that was, and pureblood, all of it tied up in old money and imperialism. After the War, Harry had learned more about the intricacies of the social and societal structures of the wizarding world and how they differed from (and aligned with) the Muggle world. He and Hermione had looked at one another, and while Harry had retreated from the public eye Hermione had marched into politics, quills blazing and parchment smoking with determination.
Draco shrugged. “My parents are my parents. Love me unconditionally and all that, so they…it was never an issue that I’m gay. I think mum hopes I’ll find me a nice boyfr—” He stiffened, horror writ across his face. “Merlin’s tits. I haven’t told her about you and she’ll have seen the paper.”
Harry looked up from the book he was inspecting to find a member of staff beaming at him. “Uh—maybe?” He’d been in the store for half an hour already, wandering between the SFF section and the romance section, unable to make a choice. He just didn’t know what Draco had read already and what he hadn’t, and also he wasn’t sure whether to get him something with a romance or something about science, or something completely different. “I’m trying to find something for my boyfriend,” Harry explained. “It’s, uh, an apology gift.”
“Yeah. The silver lining, I guess, is that my old name is still everywhere, so that’s how you found me.” Peony smiled ruefully. “Depending on how you look at it.”
. PCD manifests as one or more of the following: deep sadness, anger, aggression, not wanting to be touched, depression, feeling emotionless, anxiety, agitation, irritability, a desire to be left alone. When an individual experiences symptoms of PCD they typically do not feel any contentment, closeness or other positive feelings towards their sexual partner(s), that usually occur after sex (regardless of whether orgasm was achieved or not).
Little League Quidditch was going to be…interesting, if it took off the ground. There were two age brackets, five to six and seven to eight, and so far, there were four teams registered to the lower bracket while the upper bracket had ten teams. Harry trusted the seven and eight-year-olds to be able to play Quidditch semi-competently, but if the other four teams were anything like his kids…
“I saw it! But it got away from me,” Alice yelled, almost falling off her broom as she landed. Harry helped her up. “It’s so fast!”
Draco kissed him. “For luck,” he said and left, going to sit with Ron and Hermione. They were wearing badges, too, Harry realised. Hermione was showing by now and had put on robes that emphasised the growing baby bump.
Seamus was explaining the breeding program to Padma when Blaise turned up. He’d brought a date, a guy that looked vaguely familiar (so Heather was no more, apparently) but that Harry couldn’t place at all.
They should talk about it, sometime, eventually—before…well, before. Just before. Talk about it properly, that is. After he’d talked to Gladys, maybe—she hadn’t been able to do Monday evening appointments anymore, but they’d set up a biweekly schedule, Thursday afternoons every other week. His next appointment was the following day. She’d been confident they didn’t need to meet more often than that.
“Hey,” Draco said, and something in his voice made Harry look at him. The breeze was ruffling his hair (his hat—another new pointy one—was hanging on his back by a long cord, tied by his throat with a neat bow) and his eyes were as deeply grey as the clouds. “I love you,” he said. “And I know you’ve got this.”
person in the entire world who felt it. Harry put down the article and choked back a sob; the release of all the anxiety and fear that he had carried around for so long, and which he hadn’t been entirely aware of carrying in the first place, was overwhelming.
“No, it’s not that. I think I just didn’t…believe it.” Harry’s eyes weren’t leaking anymore, but he still had a lot of unruly emotions he didn’t know how to interpret or handle. One was definitely relief. Another was also definitely love. But there was all the rest, all the fear and insecurity and hope and want and confusion.
“So what happened just now was that Alice had a Big Fright, and it turned into magic. So the maple tree caught fire. She didn’t explode it, that’s something that happened because maple trees are full of sap, and maple sap is very sweet, like sugar, and sugar likes to burn. Can you smell it?”
Ginny, who’d been chatting with Faulkner and some reporters, came over, the reporters following, so Harry wound up giving the press some statements.
“It was the double-crossing double agents. It was all too confusing, and the more I thought about it, the less I believed in the truth we were presented with at the end,” Draco explained. “The parallel timelines, the unreliable narrator—I think she was lying about everything.”
“The important thing isn’t winning,” Harry muttered to himself, watching his kids take their positions on the field. “The important thing is the kids having fun.”
“Draco,” Harry continued, closing the distance between them. “I don’t know how to make you understand that you deserve good things—”
“Magic in England,” Malfoy said, smiling delightedly. “It’s the most extraordinary thing, really, the way Muggles write about magic. They keep coming up with new and ingenious ways to do magic that have no basis in actual reality, but are compelling all the same.”
Harry Potter, Vanquisher of Evil, The Boy Who Lived, all that bullshit—and everyone expected me to continue down that path. Be some kind of…Arbiter of Justice.”
“But?” Seamus prompted. He was grinning, and Harry couldn’t quite determine whether he was teasing or not, so he opted for drinking his ale instead of answering the question.
Harry cracked a smile. “Sure, Lee.” He shrugged with one shoulder. “I still don’t have a team so don’t get your hopes up.”
“It had all grown back!” Harry grinned. “Just as messy as before!” He tugged at his hair, demonstrating just how messy and how much of it there had been. As hoped, the kids burst into giggles at this punchline. He didn’t tell them how the story really ended, about how mad Petunia had been, about how she’d locked him in the cupboard as punishment, about how she’d never touched his hair again after that.
“Anything else?” Ginny loosened the towel, letting half of it fall away to reveal a pert breast and a pink nipple. Her eyes sought Harry’s, and then she let the other end of the towel fall.
Draco was nodding, but the wild look in his eyes was still there. “So…” he closed his eyes, rubbing his face. “Let me get this straight. George, Lee, and Angelina. They’re…in a three-way relationship? And have kids?”
“Good grief,” Ms Baxter said, hiding her amused chuckle behind her hand. “You’re putting together a team for this?”
“You did,” Harry confirmed. He was crouching in front of her and could see plainly the wobble of her lip and the fear still in her eyes. This wasn’t the first time she’d accidentally set something on fire and she’d been so frightened the first time that she’d refused to participate in any activity for weeks afterwards. “Sometimes big emotions turn into big magic,” he said, trying to explain.
“So…you don’t want a hand with that?” Harry asked, thinking he could do that. If Draco wanted to, he could deal with it.
“Those books you lent me,” Harry started, shoving his hands into his pockets so he wouldn’t be tempted to fiddle. Then he found he couldn’t continue, because Malfoy was looking at him, open interest and worry on his face.
“What’s the matter? I’ve said it before,” Harry said. He grabbed onto Draco’s feet, previously wedged under his thigh, and pulled them into his lap. Draco let him.
For the first time in Little League’s brief history, Oliver paused the game to assign both teams penalty shots.
The collection turned out to be a lifetime of correspondence from the late 18th century, belonging to a poet. There were all kinds of interesting letters in there, some of them containing whole poems and critiques and some containing nothing but snarky complaints about other poets. Some contained recipes, even, not all of them appealing. Apparently, pigeons had been popular fare once.
Harry was sorting through the stack of mail the owls had brought when the clock chimed one and Malfoy walked in. He entered cautiously, as if he wasn’t quite certain he was allowed into the building, but then he caught sight of Harry and straightened up, coming toward the desk at a brisk pace. Harry put the mail aside.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe. I—” A whistle sounded. “I should find my seat. Let’s talk later? Enjoy the game.”
Malfoy pulled the string shortly before closing hours—for the first time since settling in with his reports—and Harry found that Malfoy just wanted reassurance that he could really keep the documents he was looking at in the room without having to return them.
And Draco had come home with Harry instead of Apparating to his own home, and the bathroom had been quiet in a kind of magical way as they’d stood there, tiredly brushing their teeth and washing their faces and not talking. Draco had looked contemplative and Harry had looked at him in the mirror, at the damp strand of hair falling over Draco’s forehead, and thought that it wasn’t possible to be more in love than he was, right at that point in time.
“Right. Your course? I’ll walk you.” Malfoy put his bag into a well-charmed concealed pocket, where it disappeared out of sight and didn’t cause any unnecessary break in Malfoy’s silhouette.
, according to Ron. But Harry didn’t know where Draco lived, which was a pretty weird thing not to know about one’s boyfriend.
“Our usual one decided to get busy all of sudden,” Angelina said, looking at Harry pointedly, but there was no malice behind it. “Not that we’re complaining… but Fred has been asking for you, Harry.”
“I guess. Look, what’s important to them is that they’re a family, and though it’s unconventional, they’re happy. It works for them. They haven’t told us who the biological father of each child is, though looking at them you could probably guess. But don’t bring it up?” Harry took Draco’s hands. “Are you okay? You’re not really having a freak-out over George, Lee and Angelina, are you?”
Trying to be friends? Harry stared at Malfoy’s overflowing trolley, all the differently coloured binders and folders containing meticulously written coroner reports. He stood up, deciding to just get on with it and take it back to the strongroom.
“Okay,” Harry said, not understanding what she was going on about. “Do you mean like…” he trailed off, not sure what he was asking.
“No, no, that’s all right. I’ll come back later. I wouldn’t want to hold you up.” Harry left the store and Apparated home, conscious of the fact he was late. Flourish and Blotts closed at seven on Wednesdays. It was Wednesday. Harry had just spent almost two hours in there, unable to make a simple decision about what to buy, not least read.
He was with the student for so long that he missed Malfoy coming in, and half feared he’d shown up only to leave again when Harry’d been nowhere to be found, but it turned out Malfoy had gone straight to his study.
“Right,” Harry said, remembering exactly why he was wearing these clothes. To intimidate his cousin. To feel powerful—to feel like whatever was going to happen in that café, he would walk out again whole and hale.
“Well, we have coroner reports going back to the 12th century, though they weren’t called that, then, and,” Harry paused, examining the ledger, “they are tagged by natural causes, accidents, homicide, and unexplained. They are also sorted by region, so say you wanted to look at homicides in Leeds in the 17th century, I could fetch those for you.”
(being sexually attracted to another person or persons), because this is a common misconception about asexuality.
“Yeah.” Malfoy sipped his tea. “Well, when I completed my sentence, I decided…to continue. More or less. Both sides of my family are old blood, old money, but I think you’ve actually got what’s left of the Black properties? Sole male heir and all. Anyway, my Dad’s family had a lot of land and estates, and a lot of it had been sitting empty and abandoned for a long time. I found out many of the properties had only been abandoned during the First War…many of the tenants had been Muggleborns, Half-bloods, blood traitors, what will you, enemies of the Dark Lord. Some of our tenants were actual Muggles. They were murdered.”
“It tastes even better, and that’s a fact,” Draco said and gave Harry another kiss. “Eat. You’ll feel better. I know I will.” He went back to his chair.
He put the pamphlet on Gladys’ desk and pushed it towards her. “Can we—I need to know more about this. Please.”
“Zoë Hopper? Last I heard Juniper was dating her,” Millicent said. “I think they’re engaged, actually.”
“What truth is that?” Harry liked this Malfoy—the one that talked with him about things like this. He hadn’t known him for long, but he desperately wanted to keep him, so he allowed the hope to grow bolder. He could use some.
Ron stopped eating, scrutinising Harry instead. He looked like he wanted to say something, but thought better of it and went back to his sandwich.
Harry wasn’t ready for this to be the end, not so soon, not ever. He wanted to…get to know Draco, he wanted to still be getting to know him years from now, he wanted to see his woodworking business take off, he wanted to be there when he submitted his dissertation, he wanted to talk about the book he was reading, he wanted—he wanted so many things.
By all accounts it was normal to have unpacked boxes for a long time—George used to joke that he dealt with so many boxes at work that he just couldn’t be arsed to deal with those at home—but the boxes made Harry uneasy. Like they hadn’t finished moving in together, like the process could be interrupted, reversed, made undone.
to begin with (that is to say, the freedom to say no). An interesting article (Danish) from the 60s suggested that in men orgasms and ejaculation aren’t the one and the same, and that men can ejaculate without an orgasm at all. Another recent article (Danish) suggested this was linked with both a high pressure to perform and the societal expectation there is of men to always want sex, and thus always be ready to have it.
“You’re you,” Draco huffed, giving up. His robes were all dishevelled now. “If you’d asked me ten years ago—if you’d asked me just three months ago—whether I thought it possible that you’d love me, I’d have asked you which potion was messing you up. I’m still not entirely certain this all is real. I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
“And saw them at work? Yeah, they’re sneaky, tricky creatures. They can make themselves completely invisible, and they have magic we can only dream of. What did you think was behind the moving staircases?”
Wiltshire was sunnier than London, and breezier, and didn’t look like the Wiltshire in Harry’s memories at all. Malfoy Manor was an imposing, pale building, but it loomed darkly, with shuttered windows and an unkempt lawn. A forest seemed to be encroaching on the Manor from two sides and there wasn’t a single white peacock in sight.
The kids nodded uncertainly. Harry wished Ginny—he wished he had an assistant coach, so he could demonstrate the exercise accurately.
“Well…you can do it anyway?” Draco shrugged. “It’ll be neat either way. But I’m rooting for you to win, you know.”
Emma’s mum split, and shortly after Harry had filled her in on the exercise. She played Chaser for the Tutshill Tornadoes, if Harry wasn’t mistaken, and would actually be playing the Harpies in two weeks’ time. They demonstrated the exercise, and Harry thankfully did not embarrass himself by dropping the Quaffle.
“I read the one with the spaceship! Uhm, I mean, I haven’t read the others yet, but I read that one.”
“That’s great news!” He got out of his chair to give them hugs, pushing down the sudden bout of jealousy and hurt. “That’s wonderful.” Ron was tearing up, so Harry thumped him on the back. Hermione he gave a tight hug and a kiss on the temple. He could be—he
Outside, the sun was shining and it was an unseasonably warm day—it was only March, but it almost felt like summer. Aside from the wind, which nipped at Harry’s cheeks and ruffled Draco’s hair. It was almost sparkly in the sun, fine and pale as it was.
He went through several boxes, systematically finding places for his and Ginny’s shared stuff, throwing out things that were either broken or that they’d clearly not been missing (including several of Uncle Vernon’s cast-off socks that Harry was mystified as to why they were still around—he took great pleasure in setting them on fire) and moving onwards with the process.
“Yeah.” Harry’s throat tightened. “He really does. I like the ones best where they just fall in love and that’s it, but he likes the ones where they fuck up and have to grovel. And, uh, I guess—I mean, we had a fight and all—it’s probably stupid, but if I get him some books he likes, that can be my kind of grovelling?” he rambled, not sure why he was telling this stranger all this, but she had smiled at him and seemed nice, and Harry wasn’t at all sure if this was a great idea.
“Of course.” Harry copied Malfoy’s meticulous notes with a routine flick of his wand. “I’m really getting curious, you know. What are you researching these for?”
“Harry,” Malfoy said. “Harry. Potter.” His voice was unsteady, a bit shaky, as if he was trying to deliberately keep it calm. One hand was hovering just an inch from Harry’s arm, as if Malfoy wasn’t sure whether to touch him or not, as if he was afraid Harry would bolt if he did. As if Harry had turned into a skittish animal.
Harry rubbed his face. All his conflicted emotions were gathering in his belly and threatening to turn into rage.
Harry threaded his fingers through her damp hair. “Can’t we go to the pub first? We can leave early.” He put his nose into her hair, partially to hide his face and partially because he knew Ginny liked when he did that. Her hair smelled lovely, floral and sweet.
Harry wanted to ask about the peacocks at Malfoy Manor, or talk about the science fiction novel Malfoy had lent him, or come up with any other excuse to talk to him some more, but Malfoy looked settled to work, and Harry had to go help Janie with a collection of letters.
“Wednesday,” Malfoy said. “That’s still your schedule, isn’t it?” His cheeks were a delicate shade of pink, a colour that had Harry wondering if the colour of his cheeks could serve as some kind of embarrassometer. If so, then this was maybe lightly embarrassed? And the red he’d sported when he’d come in was…a different kind of embarrassed. Probably. Maybe.
He certainly wasn’t getting any less weird, Harry thought, and took the trolley downstairs to the strongroom.
“Mmhmmmaybe.” Draco, as usual, set all the plates to levitate smoothly ahead of them as they made their way to the garden. “The part about dying, at least. I’m not sure what to do about the rest. I don’t suppose you have birth records?”
The only option for the location of the house, presumably, was somewhere behind the Manor, so Harry started walking.
“Didn’t ask him,” Harry said, snappish. His heart beat painfully against his throat, pressing tears into his eyes. He’d never got around to asking Draco if he wanted to live together and now…it was too late. Harry had missed his shot, his one chance at doing something right.
“Mate!” Ron rose to greet him, thumping him on the back. “I heard about the Little League! That’s brilliant.”
?” Before Harry could respond, Malfoy had crossed the room and was studying a blue, rocket-shaped bath bomb. “It is!”
“To be truthful, Harry, I don’t know. I don’t know enough about it. I don’t think so.” She gave him a reassuring smile. “However, I do think your asexuality may have been a contributing factor to the trauma,” she added. “In that it is where your lack of interest in sex originates.”
“Because I pretended I couldn’t get a date so you’d go with me,” Seamus said. “It didn’t really work, but I think my lack of seduction skills can be excused. I was fourteen.”
Was this about Draco’s belief that happy endings had no place for him? That he didn’t deserve a happy ending?
“Well, think about it? You can pick which charity to support, the kids would love it, and everyone would love you. And give me a heads up, I’ll do a spot for you on the wireless.” Lee winked.
something, to not just sit there like an idiot and let his life fall apart. He pushed the blanket aside and stood up from the sofa, and for a moment everything went white and he nearly tumbled over the coffee table.
“I usually go on Fridays, just get a couple of pints and catch up. It’s fun, you should come. Some of your friends might even be there, too.” Malfoy had never come to the pub with them, Harry realised. Pansy was usually there, Blaise came every once in a while, Goyle had come once, accompanying Blaise.
“Yeah, yeah let’s do that. Reconvene. Later.” Harry had had enough embarrassment for the day. “I’ll, uh, think of something?”
“I know what you meant.” Malfoy was looking at him. “Metaphorically, I guess it was about the power of human connection to stop evil. But on a basic level…it was about overcoming centuries of prejudice and rage and hate—on both sides—and…working on building bridges.” The left side of his mouth tugged upwards. “Or to put it crassly, bone the enemy for world peace.”
Dean took the card. “The Jamaican Kitchen? That place is really difficult to get into!” He looked at Gilliam. “Your
You knew it was only a matter of time, he thought to himself, shivering and alone. This was never going to work out—you knew it would all go to down the drain the moment you had sex with him. You can’t do sex right, you can’t do relationships right, you knew that, you knew this would happen, you were just delaying the inevitable.
“That’s why I brought Ron along,” Hermione said, her smile brightening up the room. Ron was looking at her like she’d hung the moon. “We thought we’d wait until some more time had passed, but…”
“Yeah,” Harry said, rubbing his face. “It’s about sex,” he said, slowly, forcing the words out. “It’s about—I don’t—I mean—” He drew in a deep breath, grateful for Gladys’ patience and lack of judgement, and the way she always gave him space to find the words he needed.
“It means Live Action Role Playing, it’s an acronym. LARP, see?” Malfoy said. “It’s a Muggle game about dressing up as something and then pretending to be that character and doing things like solving quests and fighting and things like that. I read about it in class.” Malfoy gestured at the store. “She thinks we’re roleplaying wizards.”
“Oh! Yes. Last night, after practice. Finally. What’d you think of it?” Harry balanced his plate on his lap and speared a roast potato. “I mean, aside from the dreadful capitalist technocracy.”
“I expect we’ll know by Friday. This weekend’s donation box is still open.” Oliver clapped Harry’s shoulder. “It’s looking good, I can tell you that much.”
Ginny came over to sit beside Harry. “We don’t have any books.” She touched the half-finished bookcase. “Why do we need it?”
Harry stood in the middle of the empty living room, staring at the bookcase in the corner—still empty—and felt utterly and completely dejected. He went to bed.
“I suppose,” Draco said eventually. He opened his mouth to say something more, but seemingly changed his mind and instead went for more tea. When he finally spoke again, his tone was different. “You said it was boring. Tell me about that.”
Harry groaned. “Nothing I’m willing to share,” he said. He speared a dumpling of his own. “I’d like to say that you’d like him.”
It was quite possible that Harry was falling even deeper, if such a thing was possible. He resisted sneaking a kiss and instead summoned their plates, which bobbed over happily, and put a refreshment charm on them. Soon enough their food was hot and inviting again.
“You…look more like a wizard than you used to,” Peony then said. “What with the…” she gestured at him. “And the hat.”
They filtered out with the crowd, and Harry went to wait for Ginny outside the changing rooms while the others went to the pub to hog tables.
,” Harry said, glad that Draco noticed. “It just came out. I thought we could read it together maybe.”
Not much later all six of them were trotting to the field, brooms in hand (no bats and no Bludgers), Harry carrying a small cage of fluttering practice Snitches. His thoughts kept straying to everything he’d discussed with Gladys the evening before, but he tried valiantly to keep focused on the present until he would have the time to properly process them; he had kids to look after.
The Butterfly Bumpkins had been twenty points short, and had thus lost the game to the Fishes, but neither team had managed to score very many goals to begin with; the Quaffle slipping through wet hands and aims being off at fault all around. The kids had done their best, but it’d been a thoroughly shitty game.
“Oh? Yeah. I wanted something floral—it feels stupid now, but I wanted to keep part of my family with me, you know? Despite…well. So I looked at floral names. Nearly went with Lily, but that was your mum’s name, right, and I didn’t think you’d approve, so Peony it was. It suits me better anyway, I think. It means healing, did you know that? I like that.”
“When it comes to teasing, it’s very important to apologise,” Harry said, looking at each of them. “Teasing isn’t a very nice thing to do, now is it?” He waited for the kids to acknowledge this, then continued. “Who wants to go first?”
Draco weighed the two against each other. “The vanilla, I think. I’m not in the mood for peppermint.” He put the galaxy bomb back and handed the other one to Harry. “I’ve got to go check on the scones.”
Of course, the most likely scenario was the Potter was lying, or too scared to determine what the actual aggressor was. They were only eleven after all. What concerned him though, was if Potter was telling the truth.
Through a window that nobody knew actually existed in the Wizengamot chamber, an eagle owl flew down, homing in on its target. "Furthermore, these regulations will increase the affordability of cauldrons to—" He proclaimed, before Draco Malfoy's owl slammed into Lucius, knocking him onto the floor.
Any plans to have a quiet meal were dashed when Draco's owl practically flew straight into him. Lucius Malfoy never though that it could be possible, but the eagle owl somehow flew with even more urgency than usual. He considered that to be impossible, considering how important the letters were to his son.
"Certainly, perhaps I shall try the salmon next time. If the steak was anything to go by, then the venison could potentially be extremely appetizing."
Lucius Malfoy was a very busy man. You had to be busy to maintain the position in wizarding society that the Malfoys occupied. Despite not officially working, one couldn't afford to rest too often with the sheer number of meetings, appointments, and events his schedule entailed. So whenever Lucius Malfoy got a chance to relax, he made sure to take advantage of it.
Narcissa Malfoy nodded in agreement. "Yes, the food is simply divine. We should make an effort to dine here more often."
Thankfully, that was the final letter Lucius Malfoy would receive that day. The key phrase being 'that day'. After all, tomorrow was another day.
Narcissa had an incomprehensible fondness of the boy, she could deal with him for the summer. Maybe they should even invite Harry Potter to stay for a bit. His son obviously had a great deal of interest towards him.
he hadn’t had any reason to grab the box. in fact, he had originally brushed it aside, reaching for his usual chamomile. peppermint tea usually helped more with his headaches, but at the moment he hadn’t been able to stomach the idea of making the tea for himself. harry had known how to make it perfectly, and had purposefully never told draco exactly how he made it, stating that -
they do, and draco hustles them together into the hallway, one hand dragging petunia and the other using his wand to poke vernon’s large backside. they bustle along, complaining and whining and being generally annoying. harry stands to the side, watching silently with his arms crossed in front of his chest. he instructs petunia and vernon to stand still, shoving his wand into each of their faces as he kicks in dudley’s door and gathers him up in much of the same manner he had used for his parents.
“granger, i’m not sure how much more of this i can take,” draco moaned, sinking into a chair and burying his face in his hands. “my core is a mess and my magic has taken on the temperament of a small child.”
as hermione cast spells over him and examined his magical core, draco closed his eyes, attempting to do the breathing exercises he had heard about in attempt to soothe his headache. his efforts were proving to be fruitless, seeing as the pressure in his head was only growing.
thus far, he had managed to keep the potion a secret - except from hermione, who’s parents he had consulted with frequently concerning muggle vaccination techniques, despite being dentists and not allergists or doctors. he was beyond excited to finally be able to share his creation with harry - eager for the moment he would be able to brandish a vial of the potion and flap his hands excitedly, and see harry’s grin as he realized that draco had immersed himself in muggle culture on his own accord, and had even created something tangible from it.
“that would be brilliant, mother,” draco pressed a kiss to her cheek and held her for a moment longer before letting go. she turns her face away, wiping at the tears in her eyes before he can see them. draco turned towards his father, suddenly unsure of how to proceed. his father had never been one for physical affection towards anyone besides narcissa - but the idea of not seeing his father again for years made him crave something more than a stiff handshake.
“harry,” draco breathed, his eyes darting around as he took everything in. “it’’s… this is perfect,”
he doesn’t immediately recognize the scents that overwhelm him, but he does remember clearly where he’s smelled them before.
“oh, draco, darling,” she says as the connection establishes, and then they fall into conversation as easily as they had all those years ago, back at hogwarts.
“i’m yours, harry,” he murmurs, his voice beautifully hoarse from harry’s intrusion. he drives his fingers all the way in, applying much-needed pressure to his prostate. “come for me, baby,”
harry looped an arm around draco’s waist as he half-carried him down the hall - pausing every few seconds to readjust his grip. draco was entirely useless, only using his strength to press sloppy kisses to harry’s cheek and neck.
“now who doesn’t sound enthusiastic,” harry teased. he grabbed the lube bottle, pouring some on his fingers and leaning forward to reach draco’s hole again. he pushed two fingers in easily, scissoring them slowly. draco opened around him easily, his hips bearing down subtly into harry’s fingers.
“on a lighter note; like i said, i’ve moved to new york. been here for a little under a year now. i work in a bookstore, and i’ve been making friends. slowly, but i am. i’ve met a few wizards, but i haven’t really started doing magic again. i haven’t been back to london, either, since - yeah. but i try to talk to everyone at least once a month. ron and hermione are doing okay. they miss you, terribly. they don’t say it, but i can tell. i suppose they’d say the same about me. but, as i was saying, ‘mione is pregnant! she should be due sometime next august. they’re ecstatic. i think ron was made to be a dad.
at night, they curled into the bed and slept, wrapped around each other. draco would tuck himself into harry’s side, his face pressed into harry’s chest and his arm around his waist. throughout the night they would often drift apart but would wake in the morning and find their way back to each other.
“oh, draco,” pansy stood and rushed around the table, wrapping draco in a hug. for all that she was a slytherin, she had never quite mastered subtlety when it came to her affection for her loved ones. “you won’t lose him. i promise. he worships the ground you walk on. he would never do something to hurt you.”
“petunia,” he says sweetly, tipping her chin up with the end of his wand. “is there anything you’d like to say to harry?”
pansy breaks away from the group first, her eyes already watering. “oh, draco, i’ll miss you terribly! i’ll come to visit you in new york as soon as i can,” as per usual, pansy is dramatic and demands attention - several muggles turn to peer at her as she throws her arms around draco’s neck, crying loudly. nonetheless, draco appreciates his oldest friend, and wraps his arms around her waist as she sobs into his shoulder.
draco slashes his wand through the air, and vernon’s eyes flutter back into his head as he slumps forward, unconscious. petunia’s sobs and dudley’s terrified screams fill the air, and draco scoffs. they both tremble visibly, spouting nonsense and pleading with draco for mercy. he revels in this for a moment, satisfaction blooming in his chest as the grim reality of their situation settles over the remaining dursleys.
he sits at the kitchen table alone for breakfast, nursing a mug of chamomile tea and nibbling at a slice of toast while he flips through the prophet. he glazes over the sports section and the society pages, and puts it aside for harry to glance at later. he does, however, focus on the international news segment. apparently, there was some sort of tension growing between the korean and american magical communities, and reports of a possible war brewing. he shivers at the idea of war - of mass casualty and loss and hatred running rampant anywhere in the world, even if he would never see it. a short spike of worry for harry shot through him, causing draco to put down the prophet and take a long drag of tea.
“with a green kitchen and a vegetable garden,” draco had said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to the crown of harry’s head.
there is no warning before harry delivers the first slap - just a swish of air and then the sound of his hand coming into contact with the flesh of draco’s arse. he yelps in surprise, but finds himself leaning into the contact, his eyes watering with arousal. harry lands several more slaps on his arse, draco moaning softly with each one. this isn’t new, but it had been so long that draco forgot exactly how much he loved being put in his place by harry.
“no!” draco says loudly, slamming his mug down. coffee spills over the rim, forming small puddles on the table. “you’re going to listen to me, harry. i know that you’re struggling, and i can’t begin to understand what this must be like for you… but, harry - it’s
“of course, draco,” harry interrupts. he’s willing to give draco anything he needs, whether that means carrying him home bridal style right now, or slaughtering every other pureblood in a hundred mile radius. “take anything you need.”
“look at me,” harry murmured, using his free hand to gently grasp his chin. draco obeys, opening his eyes slowly and staring up at harry with a slightly dazed expression. harry stared down at him hard, pausing for a moment before beginning. “i love you. i love you so much. i don’t want anyone else.”
and then a triumphant grin crosses lucius’ face, and he flicks his wand at draco with hardly a whisper. draco sinks to the floor, dropping his own wand as his hands claw at his throat, gasping desperately for breath. horrified, harry steps forward and sends lucius flying backward, into a bookshelf, before binding and stunning him on the ground. he turns to draco, who is already struggling to his feet, still breathing heavily.
narcissa’s death had turned up inconclusive - and the magical examiners hadn’t detected any signs of foul play, even when harry had requested that they run all of the scans multiple times. her cause of death had been classified as natural causes, despite being a generally healthy woman, and her case had been closed. the department, and the rest of the world, had moved on to the next interesting thing.
and then draco was home, staring blankly at his empty living room and wondering where he was supposed to go from that point. he hadn’t eaten yet, and his steak and kidney pie remained on the kitchen counter beneath a hasty warming charm. there was so much of it - more than he would ever be able to eat on his own.
“draco,” harry says softly, but his voice carries. draco turns around, forcing himself to stay calm. he knows he must look crazed, and that his magic is crackling around him wildly. harry’s voice serves as an anchor, grounding him and reminding him to remain in control.
pansy allowed draco a few more moments of drama, during which he buried his face in the fabric of her robes and horribly ruined them with tears and snot and other unthinkable fluids. then, she gently pried him off and forced him to look her in the eyes. she cupped his face with her hands, peering into his damp, bloodshot eyes and frowning. overall, this draco looked completely divorced from the polished and stoic draco that she was used to, with his tear-stained cheeks and puffy lips and a red nose.
“harry must be using the store,” hermione murmured, rubbing a comforting hand in circles on draco’s back. “i wonder if he’s experiencing any difficulties as well,”
“remind me to bring you one of those blueberry muffins harry makes,” draco says to jackson with a sigh. “you’ve certainly earned it.”
“i’m sure you do,” draco says, quiet and bashful. he’s already slowly returning to his snarky self - the idea makes harry laugh to himself. draco crawls away, grabbing for the rest of his clothes and throwing harry his own. they dress quickly and silently, before returning to the couch. the scent of sex lingers over them, but they both ignore it as draco pulls the blanket over the both of their bodies. he returns to his former position, with his head on harry’s shoulder and their fingers laced together.
“do you think this is far enough?” draco asks after many long minutes. they hadn’t passed another car in what felt like ages, and there was no civilization anywhere in sight. harry startles, suddenly coming out of his trance.
“harry,” draco sobs, his entire body trembling. harry is loose and pliant in his arms. “harry, please -”
draco ripped the sheet away, a sudden urge of anger flaring in his stomach. harry’s hands - which had always been strong but gentle, were limp at his side. his silver engagement ring was still on his finger, and when draco reached down and laced their fingers together their rings clinked together gently.
and then, draco had caught his father’s eye, and his lip had curled in disapproval. draco had dropped harry’s hand, and harry made a silent vow fuck draco in one of the rooms of the manor as soon as he got the chance, just to spite him. draco had remained stubbornly impassive for the rest of the ceremony, a grim smile on his face up until the moment he had disappeared through the floo. harry stepped through after him once more, sticking the landing only marginally better than he had that morning.
harry flinches slightly as draco’s words land, and he tries not to revel in it. the idea that he might be able to hold some sort of power over harry, can make him feel afraid and sad and small and insignificant, the way he had done to draco so many times, for so long, grips him and almost makes him smile.
“pot, kettle.” he murmurs, catching draco’s lips in another kiss. he reaches down between them, cupping draco and giving his cock a slight squeeze through the fabric. the angle is awkward, but even the smallest amount of pressure is enough to make draco hiss quietly, his hips bucking into harry’s hand.
a hush falls over the room as harry and draco step up to the staircase - he doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the way that people seem to momentarily forget how to speak around him. harry can feel every eye in the building trained on himself and draco - draco smiles graciously and looks around the room slowly, while harry awkwardly purses his lips and nods stiffly at the herald.
the change is instantaneous, watching andrew transform from his familiar, light hearted self to the person draco knows he is at work: demanding, authoritative, and forceful. he drops his hand and steps in front of draco, puffing up his shoulders and sneering at harry.
“mr. malfoy, i don’t usually do house calls, but i felt this situation deserved an exception.” kingsley says solemnly, his hands folding over his robes. draco’s mouth goes dry as his mind begins to race - each avenue of thought leading him to the same conclusion each time. he wants to slam the door shut, to find a time turner and go back, to change the order of what he already knows has happened. instead, he stands in the doorway, his eyes wide and his shoulders tense. “is there somewhere we can sit and talk?”
and then draco’s crying again, soft, delicate tears that are far more happy in origin than their predecessors. harry wraps his arms around draco again, and he’s whispering i’m sorry, draco, i’m sorry, much like that night, so long ago. but this, this doesn’t feel like heartbreak  - it feels like restoration, like the pieces of the puzzle are finally sliding into the right places. the memory of the pub night slowly begins to shrink, vanishing and being slowly replaced with this - the warm press of harry's body against his own, his lips on the crown of draco’s head.
she looked beautiful and non-threatening - but both draco and harry knew that she could probably take them both down without chipping a perfectly manicured nail. her wand was strapped to her thigh in a holster similar to harry’s, accessible through a tall slit in her dress.
“are we supposed to know the significance of this neck thing?” blaise asked quietly, shattering the tension.
draco sleeps fitfully that night - spending much of the night on his side, watching the rise and fall of harry’s chest. as the night stretches on, he quietly rolls from bed and spends the next few hours pacing and attempting to fill the time until the sun comes up and he’s able to speak to harry, or at least do something productive. he wanders throughout the house, doing menial chores and tidying up, opting to fold and wipe things by hand, rather than with magic. early in their relationship, he had resented the idea of cleaning by hand, and had openly regarded it as work fit for house-elves. harry, however, had once explained to draco the strange tranquility and peace that he found while washing dishes or folding laundry, and draco had soon adopted the same mindset.
through it all, draco’s love remained steadfast and unwavering, ready for harry to reach out once more and reconnect with him again.
“i’ll stay in contact,” he said gently, forcing himself to remain composed. his mother smells of vanilla and lavender, and he feels safe in her grip. “i’ll write to you, and pansy offered to pass along messages for me until i can get my floo set up.”
disappearing into his kitchen isn’t an option, seeing as he had opted for an open-plan cottage with a distinct lack of interior walls. potter watches him as he strides over to the kitchen area to fiddle with the kettle and tea leaves. the only saving grace is that draco keeps his back to potter, which allows him to take a few steadying breaths and blink away his shock. he doesn’t know what potter could possibly want from him - they hadn’t spoken or seen each other since that night.
“do you like it? it’s just something i came up with today - there’s still room for improvement, of course.”
“i just needed a little bit, draco,” he murmurs, shaking his head. he raises an arm half-heartedly as if attempting to push draco away, but aborts the movement halfway through. his arm flops bonelessly back down at his side, and draco looks away. “just a bit to tide me over.”
“well, i didn’t exactly … speak to him.” draco admitted, straightening his posture. “my feelings were - are - hurt.”
“harry,” draco chokes out. he opens his mouth, as if to say something else - but the only thing that emerges is a loud whimper as he comes once more. harry swallows his release readily, pulling away and lapping at the head of draco’s sensitive cock as he milks him if every last drop. his lips are swollen and wet, and his hair is irreparably mussed from draco’s fingers - yet he still craves more.
“fuck,” draco chokes, pressing his palms to his eyes in an attempt to stop the flow of tears. instead, they come harder than ever - the grief pulling at him until he’s bending in two with the force of it, clutching himself as he cries his eyes out, right in the middle of diagon alley. pansy rubs his back gently, tutting affectionately and saying quietly, again and again,
he’s talking in slightly confusing circles now, his hands fluttering through the air as he speaks rapidly. the metaphorical plug that had been stopping him up for however long had been pulled, and now harry was spilling out every part of him, right here at draco’s small kitchen table.
potter wraps his arms around draco’s body. for a second, draco thinks that he’s hugging him - that potter is attempting to comfort him. instead, potter turns on his heel and disapparates, tugging draco along with him.
was the official diagnosis from the pathologist. they had rendered him unconscious before they had stopped his heart, apparently. so there hadn’t been any pain. he had been peaceful and had looked like a sleeping boy, according to the centaurs.
,” the chase reaches a culmination as they arrive in the living room, before the same fireplace draco had walked through just a few hours ago, unwittingly into heartbreak. harry crumbles to his knees on the carpet before draco, reaching for him but not quite touching him. his entire body trembles with the force of his cries. draco can’t seem to bring himself to stop staring at harry’s pocket, where a corner of the small green plastic bag sticks out. he swallows. “i can’t believe you’re doing this,” harry cries, “you’re so
“right,” he says, nodding stiffly. “i suppose that’s about right, then.” draco wants to get up in arms, to shout in harry’s face about how draco doesn’t need his approval before getting into another relationship, and that six long years of feeling unlovable is long enough of a punishment, that he deserves real, true love, finally. he wants to rage at harry, now that he’s able to. he could scream in his face, could probably even reach forward and slap him - andrew is just a few feet away and he might actually stab harry if he dares to lay a finger on draco. but, before draco can get a word in, harry continues. “draco, i’m sorry. there’s no excuse for what i did to you… what i put you through. i was so fucked up, and i took it out on you… it wasn’t right. but i’ve gone to therapy, gotten help. i’ve changed now.”
the cellphone slipped from his fingers - crashing to the ground and shattering into a thousand tiny pieces.
“besides,” lucius continues, an evil smile spreading across his face. “your aunt bellatrix was wrong about many things… but she was very, very right about the importance of unity in a family. personally, i’d rather have no family than a disloyal one. surely you’ve learned that by now, draco? or must i continue to teach you the same lesson - the one that i’ve been trying to teach you since you were a child?
“she’s right you know.” draco says, staring hard at harry. “leading a war so young… it’s not normal. you should find someone to talk to. it’d be good for you.”
“how about you and i have a little talk?” draco kneels before dudley, so that they are face-to-face. he sets his wand down on the ground beside him, and watches as dudley relaxes a bit. “so,
“his hair smells nice. you wouldn’t think so, because it looks like a birds nest, but it smells like… fruits, and vanilla, and fresh cleaning charms. and pretty much every nice thing in the world. i think he’s the best thing in the entire world,” draco gulped deeply, feeling a new onslaught of tears. “he’s very kind. he likes to feed the ducks and also he lets me put my feet on him when they’re cold even though he hates it. he also eats my arse on occasion. it’s very polite of him.”
“shut the fuck up, you filthy muggle,”  draco sneers, spinning in his seat. harry had flinched as vernon had started spewing his drivel, and draco suddenly wanted his head on a stick. he pulls out his wand and shoves it towards vernon, savouring the way he flinches. “get out of the car. all of you. now.”
he stands and walks over the large mirror hanging on the wall, turning to the side to examine his new artwork. tears immediately spring to spring to his eyes as he runs his fingers over the ink. the tattoo is long - curving up from his hip and ending in a spiral under the crease of his arm. dozens of light green leaves cover a thin vine, dotted with small springs of wildflowers in lights pinks and purples. other flowers dot the vine as well - narcissus flowers, lilies of the valley, but the obvious main focus remains on the peppermint plant. the contrasting plants shouldn’t fit together - what with their vastly different origins, colors, and patterns - but luna had truly worked her magic, and blended it all together seamlessly. “thank you, luna,” he says softly, blinking away the dampness in the corners of his eyes. he’s not sad - in fact, he’s overwhelmed with joy, and a bittersweet feeling that tugs at his heart, but he won’t cry. not here. “i love it.”
“you said… you said you loved me,” draco cries, faintly aware of how pathetic he sounds but not caring very much. “you just said it. you love me, but you choose her - you’re marrying her…you didn’t even tell me. you didn’t say anything! you just showed up with her and that fucking ring!” he moves back now, still close but able to truly look into harry’s eyes. he manages to calm his sobs for a moment, sniffling furiously but mostly intact. “why would you do that? how could you do this to me?”
they arrived in front of number four fairly quickly, and harry hesitated on the street before the house. draco took charge now, half leading and half pulling harry up the park before either could lose their nerve. or rather, harry would take the moral high ground and guilt draco into returning home with him to drink warm mugs of tea and pretend that they had never thought of this - had never tried to go through with it.
“harry,” she says, her lips curling into a slight frown as she says his name. she suddenly seems far away - and sad. and then, like it never happened, she’s back. “it’s for him, right? the lily flowers, for his mother of course. and narcissus for yours. i just don’t understand -”
at one point, he had loved this house. every inch of it was covered in memories of his and harry’s time together - a chaste kiss here, a quick hook up there. they had lived and laughed and fought and fucked over nearly every surface - and now, even looking at a certain corner or room made draco’s stomach twist painfully.
having pansy here, badmouthing harry and promising to never let draco see him ever again, was comforting in a way that bought tears to draco’s eyes. she wiped them away with her sharp nails, murmuring to draco that he was safe here, in france, and that harry potter would never lay a finger or an eye on him, ever again.
and so he distracts himself - throwing himself into his glasses and conversing with anyone at the table that he can, anyone that’s not potter or the she-weasel.
there were a great many things that harry did not understand about the wizarding world, like  where food came from when it was summoned, why the money system was so bloody confusing, where things went when they were banished. he didn’t understand why wizards insisted on wearing horribly old-fashioned robes, even in the dead of summer, and why there wasn’t some sort of support system for muggle-borns being integrated into wizarding culture.
“is this true, draco?” she catches his eye, her own brown eyes wild and damp. her lips trembles and her hand, still in draco’s, shakes.
for the next few long moments, harry eats draco’s arse with abandon, savoring his moans and gasps. when draco begins to fuck himself back on harry’s tongue - whimpering loudly and very obviously mere moments away from orgasm - harry pulls away. he replaces his tongue with the flat of his thumb, rubbing slow circles around the quivering muscle.
“pansy!” draco protests, and then pulls the phone down to his lips. “i’ll call you later,” he adds quietly.
he finishes off pansy’s gin and grabs for another drink, raising it to his lips when he’s very rudely interrupted.
the second the floo roared, draco emerged from his study. he ate breakfast alone, not tasting his slice of toast as he forced himself to swallow. one part of draco, the rational and sensible part, reminded him that he was being petulant, and that it had just been a dream. the other part of draco, which was currently dictating his actions, simply reminded him of the way harry’s hands had run over the twinks -
“mmm,” theo hummed, standing up from the table again. he dropped harry’s robes on the ground and draco cringed. “tell us more sex stories. that was fun.”
harry was indeed lying on the bed, his eyes shut and his head lolled to the side. one of his arms hung from the bed, palm outwards. his fingers were slack and slightly blue. there were a team of healers surrounding him, murmuring to each other quietly and casting spells over his limp body. hermione looked away, her lip trembling.
it's been two years, but draco is still intimately familiar with every inch of potter's body. he traces each scar delicately with the pad of his fingers, following his trails with tender kisses all the while. under his ministrations, potter trembles and whimpers quietly, his fingers tangling in draco’s hair. it’s practically reverent, the way he reintroduces himself to potter’s body. beneath him, harry whispers quietly, again and again, “draco, draco, draco -”, his name sounding like the most beautiful of songs or poems in harry's mouth. he relishes in this - the way his name rolls off of harry’s tongue like silk, or honey. he’s missed this so very much - so much so that it almost hurts him. he had carefully rebuilt his life post-potter, burying himself in his studies and tending to his garden and keeping himself generally busy so that he wouldn’t have to examine the gaping hole in his life left by none other than harry potter.
“he’s not getting away with this,” draco snapped, although it’s intensity was lost with the force of his cry. “he won’t.”
“what’s this?” draco asked, sitting up and throwing the blanket off of his body. harry settled into the couch beside him and pushed the mug into his hand, nodding his head encouragingly.
” he blinks hard, his chest heaving and his voice wavering. draco opens his arms and harry goes into them easily, pressing his ear into draco’s chest, searching for his heartbeat. he finds it, and he relaxes marginally. “it was so -
“draco,” harry says lowly, his voice serious but gentle. “you won’t lose me, baby. i have zero intentions of ever looking for or at anyone else. i only want you, draco. i swear it.”
“i cannot believe you.” draco murmured, staring at harry incredulously. “you actually went out and got a fucking puppy. did you even get the milk i asked you for?”
harry had fallen asleep in draco’s embrace that night, a departure from their normal position. draco had lain awake for long afterward, his mind racing and the love of his life in his arms.
“fuck, hermione,” harry says running his hands through his air. he sounds distressed and apologetic, nothing like the psychopathic mannerisms he had been portraying just a few moments ago. “you caught us at a bad time - we had just gotten into an argument. i got out of control.” he turns to draco now, also bending in half so that their eyes meet. his voice is deceptively doting, so much so that draco finds himself almost believing him anyway.  “i’m sorry, draco. i love you.”
. she sobs and shakes visibly as she casts, but draco can still feel the strength of her magic going up around the house, warding it to the gills. this helps him to relax marginally, but he can still faintly feel the press of harry’s fist around his throat.
“oh,” harry says, raising an eyebrow and looking cautious, as if draco was a crazy person. “are you feeling okay, draco?”
“nothing,” draco had murmured, collapsing onto the ground beside harry, ignoring the fact that he was going to end up with grass stains all over his trousers and expensive dress robes. he had laced his fingers through harry’s and bought them to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to his bruised knuckles. “never mind that, now.”
“we all have magical hands, we’re wizards” draco returns, a smirk playing on his lips. harry opened one of his eyes and squinted at draco through it. “but i love you too, harry.”
