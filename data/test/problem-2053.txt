"Is that answer enough for you?" he panted (sexily?) after wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Personally, Harry’d feel much better as soon as they were doing something—anything—he was actually good at. Navigating uncomfortable topics had never been his strong suit.
Draco took a full step back and raised himself to his full height in an effort to looked more intimidating.

When he could, he traced his finger tips along Draco's crack and circled his furrowed pucker, giving him a chance to get used to the feeling of his fingers before gingerly pressing one inside.
He was also relieved (not really, though) that Malfoy had put his abandoned shirt back on. He could still see every contour of the man's trim torso, but at least he wasn't being tempted by the creamy expanse of skin any longer.
Granger leaned forward to peer at his gestures. "You switched first and last?" He nodded, yipping excitedly.

"Merlin, Mordred, and Morgana!" Harry exclaimed, jumping up from the sofa (causing his unopened package to tumble to the floor). "What

Draco rubbed his face with one gloved hand. Eventually, he turned back toward Harry with a regretful smile.

"For the record, you should be," he continued, as if there hadn't been a pause. "She sends me the most thoughtful gifts. And she knows the key to my heart is through my stomach."
Malfoy rolled his eyes but moved to comply all the same. He stood with some difficulty and stepped to the side so Harry could lift the settee and whisk the rug out from under it. He turned toward the door but halted mid-step to spear Harry with a stern finger and even more sternly worded, “No snooping.”
Was it too soon to mention that? He hoped not. He wanted Potter--Harry; he'd always been Harry in the secret recesses of his mind--with every fiber of his being. Had for years. But hearing the man so unsure left him wanting to share in the hope it could be a comfort.

With one last suck across the dip, he set the spoon down into his empty ramekin and grabbed his napkin to dab fastidiously around his mouth.
Draco chuckled as he walked around Potter with a certain sway in his hips on his way back to the couch. He didn't deny or accept the Auror's silent questioning, satisfied enough to know Potter was a fan. He sat back down with a little more dignity than usual and laid his elbows over the back of the piece of furniture.
"Do we have reservations? I'll need to transfigure my clothes into something more... Appropriate."
"Fuck--! Ah..." Draco jerked his head aside and planted his feet firmly into Harry's shoulders. Not to knock him off but for stability. He bit his lip and hissed as the pucker was nipped.
Maybe it just wants to give you a break for once?
"What if I mind Rosie for you one of these nights?" he suggested, spreading his hands like an offering. "A couple of hours, you and Hermione could get out just the two of you..." he drew the words out, practically singing them in an effort to make them more enticing.
With a victorious shout, Harry finally popped the lock. He stumbled heavily through the doorway, pinning Draco to the wall to rut against him. Holding his arms above his head and shoving a thigh between his legs, he sucked a vibrant lovebite into the thin skin of Draco's neck.
Luckily (or unluckily?) for Harry, the notion of staying indefinitely seemed to slip right over his head. Instead, he blew little bubbles as he breathed another long sigh out and closed his eyes.
The reporter--a protégé of Skeeter's--had dogged his steps for years, suspecting (rightly) that Harry wasn't the unhinged wealthy shut-in most people believed him to be. Until now, he'd never managed to prove his pet theory but he must have gotten the scoop of his career to be at Harry's muggle workplace that day.

"Hmm... Not bad, I suppose. Yes, I guess I do like it."
Harry pushed and pulled and squeezed his prick, not wanking properly since his hand was dry, but driving himself mad all the same. His mouth hung open, his shallow, rapid breaths doing a piss poor job of delivering oxygen to his lungs.
******
Malfoy's smug countenance was all the confirmation he needed. No wonder he had taken such a keen interest in the man--he'd been fantasizing about him for more than a year without even realizing it.
"Yes, I am," Draco removed his hands as Harry reached full chub and stood, carefully making his way back to his seat and settling back down--just in time for the girl to push back the curtain and enter with their desserts.

The criticism had fangs as hot as an ashwinder's and the burn was just as sharp.
His smirk turned into a feral grin as a hint of possessive jealousy crept into his words. "How many other blokes have done this for you, I wonder."

I have included with this letter a bottle of my proprietary calamine and dittany blend. It should help with both concerns. (
Draco looked so comically sad over the mess he'd made of his clothes that Harry couldn't help but laugh--the man had (quite literally) brought it on himself, after all.
He leaned forward with sparkling eyes and spoke as if he were discussing a lively new play.
Malfoy's posture stiffened, this time for something other than his faulty synapses. Seconds passed in which he stared unblinkingly, chest rising and falling with his own laboured breathing (a combination of exertion and dismay the most likely cause).
"I'll give in, just this once," he acquiesced. "But only because you're so convincing."
"I am going to worship your beautiful body," he murmured into Harry's ear. "Even if you come before I'm done, unless you tell me to stop, I won't quit until I've tasted every inch of you."
Draco chuckled, despite the seriousness of his words.
Forget the damn Seeker! Godrick. I shouldn't be allowed near a quill when I'm doped up on potions. Let's just pretend I didn't say anything about him at all, yeah?
Draco shuddered, gooseflesh erupting across his skin, his nipples tightening almost painfully. If Potter asked, he'd blame it on the sudden change of temperature--it had been stuffy under the dress--not the very real effect his brash, domineering swagger had on him. (It was impressive how Potter could channel such raw masculinity in that ridiculous getup, but then that had always been his way.)
Harry had an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu.
"How do you want me now?"
With the matter as settled as it was going to be, he curled up and prepared to sleep.
Dare.
*****
Enclosed is a picture of myself with a pose you may find rather familiar so that you might not pine away unto death without me.
He stomped over to where Draco stood in the relative privacy of a copse of trees and pointed his wand at his own neck to cast a broad glamour over the whole thing since the prat refused to do it for him. He then planted himself in the grass with his back against a broad trunk and looked challenge up at Draco.
Draco's legs fell open and he spread them farther still with a hand hooked under his knee. He increased the pace of his thrusting and added a second finger, grunting and groaning, clenching and moaning as he fucked himself on his hand. His hair fanned out around him like a halo, his cheeks and chest (and gripping hole) were pink.
Draco practically cackled under his breath when Harry groaned. A triumphant smirk played about his lips as he settled into his seat just in time for dinner to arrive. The server girl bustled about professionally enough, but there was light pink on her cheeks--possibly from observing his thumb sucking. He quirked a brow as her breasts came too close to hitting him in the face (they were quite large. How did she not fall under the weight?), but soon she was gone and in her busty place their starters. Draco's mouth, much to his own surprise, watered from the smell of pea soup laced with--he sniffed more closely--mint and panna cotta.
Harry hummed against Draco's skin. He hadn't put much thought into the words before saying them--they were just supposed to sound sexy, dammit. The fact Draco even had the mental capacity to be overanalyzing them meant Harry was dropping the ball in the handjob department.
Draco chuckled and slipped his hand away with one last teasing tug. He leaned forward until he stood on all fours over Harry, cock hanging heavy between his legs. Draco's lube hand, still plenty sticky, slid over his own hip (never losing eye contact), over the curve of his arse, and slipped between his cheeks with a quiet groan.

Ordinarily Harry wouldn't mess with someone's hair--even if, for some strange reason, he thought he could improve on the style--but he'd been given express permission. He gleefully ran his fingers through Draco's gelled locks, shaking them out until the strands fell loose about his face.
"I think this confirms that I am more than slightly bent," he mused aloud.

plans," Draco retorted, as if the entendre were clever, but Harry knew it was just to make him laugh. Draco actually was quite witty when he wanted to be; his humour skillfully disarming.
Draco replied, chest puffed up with smug self-congratulation. He curled himself around Potter's fingers, nipping at them playfully.
Fortunately, his voice of reason cut through the burgeoning anxiety to remind him that a prick was a simple thing (unlike, say, a vagina).
******
He fisted one hand in Draco's jumper, knotted the other in his long hair, slotted their legs together, and crashed his mouth onto Draco's.
Too much, he realized with a frown. He hadn't expected company. Especially not such questionable company. There were all manner of sensitive and/or embarrassing things lying around in the general state of disorderly chaos in which he existed (dirty clothes, empty take away containers, scribbled case notes). But he lived alone and hadn't had a steady girlfriend in years--the mess didn't bother him so he saw no point in cleaning. Kreacher picked up a bit when he stopped by on the weekends, but otherwise spent his days at Hogwarts and Harry did a good job of undermining his efforts when he was gone.
He made his way to the nearest Apparation point, footsteps forceful—and ever-so-slightly off-tempo—against warm pavement.
It didn't take you long to go after the hair, did it?

he chirped, temporarily forgetting Potter couldn't understand a word he said.

Malfoy,
It happened so quickly, it would have been easy to dismiss. A spark of wild magic careered from the soles of his feet, up the backs of his legs and through his spine, down his left arm and out his fingertips, travelling from his hand to Malfoy’s as a momentary flash of blue, leaving Harry goose pimpled and tingling in its wake. All this took place in less than the blink of an eye. In fact, Harry would have dismissed it entirely for a flight of fancy (“I swear, Ron, his touch is totally electrifying,” what a load of rubbish) were it not for the fact that Malfoy seemed to have felt it, as well.
They'd experimented in the kitchen, as well, and determined that Harry should be the one to make dinner that evening, which was fine by him. He smiled to remember Draco's disastrous attempt at grilling steaks.
Harry indulged Draco for a few minutes (it was hardly an imposition), but the hardwood floor was unforgiving and Draco was made out of a great many pointy parts so it wasn't long before his discomfort won out over his enjoyment of what was otherwise a brilliant snog.
******
"What are you waiting for?"
The next was how pleasant the summer evening had shaped up to be--a good omen, he hoped.
for good measure. He was irritated enough that it was no trouble summoning the magic to do so wandlessly. The expulsion of energy helped him get a handle on his anger. (It wouldn't do to lash out now, Ron would think he was being defensive.)
Malfoy tossed back his hair, the fine strands falling back into place almost immediately. A small but genuine smile graced his features, softening the hard edges into something altogether too exquisite. "It has been some time since I've put brush to canvas," he said quietly, almost shyly, "but I was trained in all the classical arts. Sketching, painting, duelling, dressage, music..." His expression twisted. "I doubt I would be much good at any of them now, though."
Draco gave Harry's stomach a final nip; despite his words, he placed himself between Harry's legs and leaned down to lick a thick, wet stripe up the length of the Gryffindor's cock--from base to tip, where his tongue flicked off.
My point is, I didn't see this as anything other than normal and acceptable, though now I realize differently. But I still have difficulty recognizing...shall we say, problematic parenting choices.
******
Draco grabbed what was left of the drought from the desk and downed it like a professional. He dropped the bottle back onto the Auror's work space and took a few slow steps back.
Malfoy let out an annoyed huff and amended his statement—
He looked Draco up and down, not bothering to keep the leer to himself.
The A-word pushed him over the edge.

"I am going for a quick walk about the garden before dinner to build up my appetite... And distract myself so I don't jump you," he winked. "I'll be back."
"Feel free," he breathed, almost dismayed, as his gaze locked upon the sight. He noted a slight hesitation in the normally confident man and smiled at the reminder that Harry hadn't done this before.
Draco had left for one simple reason: he felt like he was rushing Harry by being around all the time. That, and by now his already far too independent barn owl might have decided to just live in the woods and then where would he be? A shut-in with no owl was asking for trouble. He arrived late that evening after Apparating from Harry's and immediately walked into his empty apartment, locking the door thoroughly behind him. The whole place felt very foreign now, even though he had only been gone about a week.
That's rubbish. They may as well have sentenced you to live among muggles stripping you of all your magic like that! I'm glad your sentence is nearly at an end.

Harry glanced quickly at the Malfoy by his side--he'd closed his eyes. He turned back to the dance floor in time to see the disguised assailant swing with the syringe, but past-Malfoy was quick enough to spot and sidestep the clumsy attempt. He disarmed the attacker with the same fluid grace he'd displayed at the wedding and stared, wide-eyed and shaken, at the unfamiliar weapon. That was when the would-be assassin made his escape, easily lost in the press of bodies.
He was genuinely excited for a change.
Harry waited patiently, having learned that Malfoy preferred when he pretended not to notice such things. He busied himself with checking the gear in his backpack (even though he already knew what was inside). Malfoy scowled behind his hand, pressed ineffectually to the renegade muscle in an effort to stop its fluttering.

The blonde vaguely indicated the small crowd gathering and whispering along the edge of the walk with a careful wave of his hand. He took his cone back and sucked on the cool tip.
Thus accomplished, he preheated the oven and gathered what he'd need for dessert: butter, sugar, eggs, flour and, of course,
But Malfoy'd found him, hadn't he? Though he didn't seem to have meant to, what if the Healer who'd referred him knew somehow? Malfoy claimed he was sent to Henry Collins on the basis of his exceptional reviews. It was true that Harry had made a bit of a name for himself in his field (rather literally, given his alias), but was his reputation so good that it would be apparent even to a wizard?
Harry listened for the telltale crunch of gravel that meant they were well and truly alone before relaxing. That could have gone much worse, he decided. They were lucky it was Ron who found them and not his brother. Though the rest of the Weasleys had warmed up to Draco, George still kept a frosty distance.

Sarah tutted sympathetically. Megan and Jenny pretended to do the same, smothering greedy smiles at the quality gossip fodder. Eric excused himself with a jaunty, "That's my cue!" (He had a strict 'No Office Drama' policy that Harry kept hoping would catch on with the rest of their colleagues.)
"Also," Harry continued, straightening, "I owe you an apology."

Draco observed Harry closely after taking a seat. He tilted his head and bit his lip in thought before nodding to himself and standing back up.
Malfoy wore a thin-lipped frown and fetching ice-blue robes. The edges, Harry noted (for no reason in particular), were finely trimmed with silver embroidery.
...So he did.
your first time, though. Does he know you're a blushing virgin?"

Draco sighed, knowing that meant he was expected to move again. He lifted himself up and carefully climbed back down from the table to the floor, grabbing Harry's hands and pulling him up with him.
******
...Which made two of them. Maybe that's part of his charm.
"Draco, stop," Harry urged, taking him by the hand. "That's exactly what you shouldn't be doing right now." He coaxed the man to sit back down (and continued holding on in case he tried to bolt again).
Draco chuckled as he slipped a hand between them and placed it over Harry's stomach. He leaned forward to nuzzle his lover's ear and whispered hotly, "You should eat first. You'll need your strength."
"Does that mean I might have a chance after all?" There was a little hope and playfulness (and a lot of indication) in his tone. He crossed his legs, prominently displaying one of his bare feet again as it hung just above the coffee table between them, and tilted his head. "Ask away. Before you jump me, I mean."
"You're gorgeous, you know that?" he said sincerely, raking his eyes over the feast before him. "I know I've made some jokes, but I mean it."
Finding himself somewhat preoccupied by the fact Malfoy, for all his proper Pureblood training, was speaking with his mouth full, Harry was slow to reply.
Draco jumped back and looked around the kitchen as the glasses suddenly began to shake and clatter. He thought for certain he felt the house itself shake as Harry grew suddenly angry. Draco tensed and watched Harry wide-eyed as he dashed from the room--and watched in both terror and fascination as Harry conjured a huge ball of intense, swirling fire. Draco didn't dare move until that light was distinguished, staring unblinking at the display. Once it was done Draco shakily moved to stand on his feet and walk into the living room, choosing to stand by the edge of the kitchen floor instead of approach too quickly.
*****
“Mm,” Malfoy hummed by way of reply. Gingerly he picked himself up, ineffectually smoothing the creases in his robe and tugging his sleeves down to his wrists, concerned with appearances even here.
There had been some murmuring amongst the crowd as they made their way through: some were commenting on the state of their tightly joined hands while many others, especially among the older ladies, whispered comments about two hansom young men cruising through. Draco smirked at the attention they garnished, practically preening under it, until they reached the balcony. Everything was far more impressive than Draco had imagined. The seats were tilted a little too far forward (it felt like he would drop just from trying to sit down), and a little too close to the edge, but considering what he had thought he'd find instead he was none-the-less pleased.
"Harry," Draco whimpered as he bit his lip. "Harry, fuuck... Fuck...!"
Draco's back arched from the chair and his head fell back, mouth open on a shuddering cry. His whole body stiffened and shook as he came, spurting white flecks between their torsos.
"Well, if you can handle it I certainly can," Draco said with mock pompousness. He tugged Harry's hand over gently and kissed the back of his hand, then bit his thumb--just before slipping the digit into his mouth. He suckled on it until it was nearly numb before releasing it and settling their hands back down on Harry's thigh.

I haven't completely grown out of my reckless impulsiveness. I'm trying to be better, but it's everything I can do to keep from apparating to your doorstep right now. Has been since you told me you were gay (which was a revelation to me, as well, though I had wondered in school). That's why I said what I did. I was testing the waters and you surprised me by responding, but you've been surprising me since your first letter so at some point I should probably just expect it, shouldn't I?

"I was starting to wonder if you ever would, you bastard," Draco whined between hot pants as he gripped the back of his knees tight. "I love you so much..."
Malfoy looked like he intended for Harry to go alone. That wasn't going to happen, at least not without Ron in the office. Harry didn't think Malfoy would try to hurt him while he was occupied with the memory (which was rather surprising to realize), but the Slytherin couldn't be given the opportunity to snoop with so much confidential and classified information laying around.
He held up the whisk so that rich ribbons of dark chocolate flowed back into the pan, showing Draco just what he would be missing out on if he decided to act like a picky child.
"And if we're both sick at the same time? Colds hit me quick and hard, you inconsiderate oaf," Draco didn't try to struggle away, but he did turn his head as Potter tried to kiss him. "Snuggling unprotected is one thing, but I am not kissing your germy mouth! On top of everything else, I detest the taste of medicine."
Draco,
'Boring' was the last word Harry would use to describe Draco, in bed or otherwise. And if this was new for him, he was certainly game. (But then, Harry had always appreciated Draco's competitive spirit.)
"As for my favourite..." he tucked his hands into his front pockets, leaving his thumbs hanging out. "It's hard to choose." He scrunched his face in thought, staring up at the rafters as if they might have the answer. Some of Malfoy's books had more interesting plots than others, some characters he resonated with more. They were all fast-paced and funny. And hot.

He cast his gaze to the far wall, unwilling to face whatever calculating, condescending expression Lucius was certainly wearing, and chewed the inside of his cheek.

Bixby took the hint and disapparated with an unnecessarily loud crack that echoed for seconds in the cavernous space. “Prick,” Harry muttered...then instantly felt guilty.
"Something about you when you're acting so protective and heroic just gets my blood flowing," he replied, voice like whiskey. "Then again, much of what you do has that effect on me," he chuckled, deep and dark.
Ron merely raised a ginger brow.
"I'd offer to be gentle," Harry smirked over his shoulder, taking the stairs two at a time, "but you always call me a Hufflepuff when I do."
Draco
...Was there?
"You can put this into the oven for me. I don't do lifting," Draco smirked as he walked around Harry, quickly spanking him. "The sauce is what I'm most proud of, actually."
"You're absolutely right you could," Harry replied, placating. "But I don't think you will."
I guarantee that my solicitors are quite talented and far more likely to win any disputes of this nature than whomever you might hire, so I would propose a counteroffer:
"This is a conversation we can have later," he said firmly, hoping that if he didn't shut the topic down completely, Malfoy might be more likely to comply. "
Harry laughed, dropping his arse onto the tub floor and stretching his legs out in front of him with Draco between them. Maybe it had been the world's greatest blowjob after all.
And this just proves my point! Nothing can happen between us that wouldn't lead to disaster considering our pasts and personalities. It was a nice thought, and physical attraction is certainly not an issue (you are unquestionably fit), but we can't even have a conversation without conflict via

Harry wished he punched him harder.
He shifted uncomfortably in his chair and barely had enough time to catch the wooden case Malfoy chucked at him.
He grabbed Draco by his sharp hip bones and jerked him forward, eliciting a gasp from the blonde that had Harry grinning like a maniac. "And this doesn't have to be a one-time-only event. I'm sure I'll screw up again soon. Maybe tomorrow. You can use that as an excuse to get me out of my clothes a second time."
How about that! I was planning on adopting someday, as well. Or asking one of my friends to be a surrogate mother. Hermione and Ginny both offered, actually, but I told them I wanted to wait until I have a stable partner. Teddy is a handful as a crazy toddler, I can't imagine how hard a
Not long after, Draco felt it was finally appropriate to leave. Apparently Potter had felt the same, as he was no longer in attendance when Draco turned to look one final time (once his cake had been consumed.) The blonde left with a sad smile as he silently wondered (doubted) if he'd ever run into the Auror again.
Harry wanted to keep snogging but he couldn't support himself on one arm and continue doing what he was doing with the other (and that job took precedence at the moment).
Potter continued to hesitate so Draco rolled onto his back and presented his belly (electing to think of the degrading act as a perfectly Slytherin tactic to achieve his goals).
"Fine, jump down my throat for being kind!" she huffed, standing as well and crossing her arms over her bright purple top (obscuring the phrase 'Cardio is Hardio'). "I was only trying to help, but that was obviously my mistake."
The blonde turned away to peer around the office, which was practically bare beyond a calendar on the wall and a poster of the Chudley Canons. Potter's desk had a few trinkets, but nothing spectacular. The other desk just a foot or so away, had a signed snitch, a number of strange little objects (toys from Weasley Wizard Wheezes?), and the chair had a Chudley Canons colored cover. He smirked to himself as he already knew who Potter's partner was. Apparently becoming a husband and father hadn't totally matured Weasley.
*****
Draco quirked a brow and frowned as he was greeted so... Well, so far from what he had expected. Once instructed to sit, he did so with trepidation--though not enough to offer Harry any space, despite knowing it could be nothing but bad news from the tense expression the Auror wore. One arm stretched across the back of the sofa as the other settle on his lap. His legs were crossed, ankle over knee, as he listened to Harry's short explanation.

Janine considered him for a long minute. Harry fidgeted uncomfortably under her scrutiny.
, for Godrick's sake, so what was it about Malfoy's snide tone that froze his feet to the ground as if spelled and made him turn back around, degree by begrudging degree, almost against his will?
He took another bite to give his lagging synapses time to catch up.
"Figures," Malfoy muttered, shaking his head in exasperation (at whom, Harry wasn't sure). "You're a Gryffindor, after all."

Draco tensed a moment when he felt a hand descend on his head--he considered it the height of impropriety when someone tried to direct him with pressure on his skull. But the hand was light and still; Potter simply wanted to touch him more, it seemed, which was agreeable.
. Draco was so bloody into it, like he was the one about to get off. And there was an undercurrent of naughtiness to the whole affair--because it was a bloke with Harry's prick in his mouth--that made it more exciting. But even that paled in comparison to the sight of his slick, pink prick sliding in and out of the tight ring of Draco's lips as the blond's pale, pale hair brushed Harry's thighs and stormy, mercurial eyes held his--shimmering, smirking, and
Since Draco was engaging Hermione in a conversation Ron wouldn't appreciate anyway, Harry took the opportunity to pull him aside with a nod at the door and a tightly spoken, "Ron, a word?"
Harry hemmed and hawed. He was privy to several facts about Draco the man himself wasn't even aware of but none of them were appropriate for the current (or rather hoped-to-be-rekindled) mood. They hadn't spoken since school and their acquaintance back then was hardly made up of sunshine and roses.
Good Godrick, Draco was going to kill him. At least Harry would die a happy man.

Harry was more than ready to put the day behind him by the time he left work to prepare for his date. Left over adrenalin from the case--and a bit of nervousness, if he was being honest--had him feeling twitchy. He poured himself two fingers of Ogden's, changed, tried doing something--anything--with his hair (and gave it up for a bad job five minutes later), and checked himself over in the mirror one last time before apparating to Draco's. He looked good. He smiled at the certainty Draco would look
A familiar husky drawl and caress to the back of his neck sent his thoughts scattering. "You work too hard," Draco declared, having slunk silently up behind him like the serpent he was named for. He removed Harry's glasses and placed them on the desk before rolling his chair out to straddle his lap.
Harry sighed. "Fine," he relented, tugging at his fringe. "I did. But I had good reason to!" His leg ached something fierce from the excitement of the afternoon.
He panted, gripping Harry's shoulders tight. The hand on his hip was near crushing and prevented him from thrusting with abandon (though he still tried).
And then it was just the two of them once again.

Draco peppered kisses all over Harry's neck and the side of his face as he was led away. Nothing heated or lustful, just little pecks and gentle nudges of his nose and lips.
Draco's French sounded fluent and effortless. Harry'd always been rubbish at foreign languages.
Harry’s heart swooped in his chest. His body made a valiant attempt to respond to the tempting sight but he simply had nothing left. Even his libido gave it up for a bad job. Which was all for the best, he was sure. He would need both time and distance to process the surreal intimacy of what had just happened between them.
The answer was a resounding yes.

"You're going to come on me soon," he rumbled. "I can feel it. Your prick is so hard for me and your pretty body is going tense. It won't be long now."
He crawled around Draco so he could reach into his nightstand drawer and hand him the tube of lubricant therein. He actually had his wand in his back pocket, but real lube was better than the conjured stuff.
"I know what my form is, actually."
"Whatever you want," he said to Draco, somewhat gruffly. "I don't think I'll have much."

When they arrived, they were greeted formally by the maître d' standing tall at a dark podium and immediately led to their table by a fancy-robed hostess. She tittered a bit at the idea of seating 'the Harry Potter' but at least she wasn't rude to Draco (whether because she didn't recognize him or because she was more professional than that, Harry didn't know).
He stepped back and appraised Draco thoughtfully, giving him a long minute to fret over the devious ideas that might be running through his mind. While it would be a fitting and delightful punishment to make Draco parade about in something scandalous, Harry had put a lot of time and effort into this date and he didn't want to spoil it just for a lark.
The moment Harry went for another bite (this time with more cake than raspberry), Draco caught his wrist and stole the piece right off his fork. He made a hum of approval.
"I know I may as well get naked at this point, and I will--not to worry, but it's the damn taste... At least eat a mint before you snog me. If you do as you're told I may put a special show on for you."
Potter,
But he could resonate with the impulse to just stay inside and avoid the public. He did that often enough himself. How Malfoy spoke so flippantly about such matters was disconcerting, though.
*****
"It's just music tonight," Harry answered, hoping that didn't dampen Draco's enthusiasm. "Mozart. You've probably heard of him. He is considered one of the greatest muggle composers of all time." (Hermione had given Harry an art historical lecture when they settled on the plan for the evening.)
In his opinion, Gryffindors as a whole were too quick to give up quality blackmail material, but he didn't mind benefiting from their vaunted honour when he could. He walked to the edge of the table and reached for Potter, unwilling to make the jump in his current state. Potter obediently set his plate aside and helped him across. Once on the sofa, Draco climbed into his lap and curled up to sleep his overindulgence off.
Harry's wand!"
"You good?" he asked solicitously, holding Draco's hip with one hand and rubbing his flank with the other.

"Now, gentlemen," Arthur said, making eye contact with the both of them, "if you'd like us all to leave, we can. I understand that you weren't...expecting company." A muscle in his jaw jumped when he said that bit and Harry wondered if he was speaking through gritted teeth. "It seems as though you might have more to say, however." With a pointed look at his sons, who were the most likely to dispute the claim, he asserted, "We are ready to listen."

," Draco's lip curled in disgust. "I wanted to be fearsome."
"Rather like being caught with your trousers down, isn't it?" Potter retorted archly, one raised eyebrow matching his tone.
Harry was right; it took Draco nearly thirty more minutes before he was walking down the steps from his bedroom at least. His face was clean, his hair was slicked back, and he wore that backless piece he mentioned before (tall collar and no sleeves, but tight around the waist and hips) under a leather waist coat. His trousers squeezed his ass and thighs without restricting his gait (possibly enchanted). He turned around the corner of his couch and stood before Harry with his hands on his hips.
Harry
Harry repeated internally, incredulous. Just because Ron coincidentally happened to be one hundred percent correct didn't give him the right to make comments like that.
Draco sniffed the air as Harry assessed his dessert. At once, his mouth began to water in anticipation.
Draco's body was opposite to his in almost every way. Where Harry was short and broad, Draco was long and slender; almost skinny, but with enough lean muscle to lend him some masculine definition. Harry's tongue itched to taste those peaks and valleys.
Harry the therapist was a confident man. He knew what he was doing. He didn't second guess himself when pompous prats raised their eyebrows at him.
So far, it wasn't their most enjoyable date, but then, Harry never went to Diagon unless he had to. The folks in Hogsmead were better about treating him like a regular person and not some kind of deity or infamous arsehole. Shopping by owl post was even better.
******
Ron blinked at Harry's unexpected outburst--there was a bit of wild magic playing about his figure, as well as a telltale glint of anger in his eyes. He frowned at the sudden change in atmosphere.
But he just sat there. Blinking.
He arched wantonly against Draco's cock, spreading his legs even wider, and groaned, "Like that. Just like that."
Well, safety of the public be damned.
"All right. I'll extract the memory and you can just stand there looking pretty. Okay, Potter?" he said with a cheesy wink.
Or at all, apparently. The last of his control left him when Harry decided to look up and lock eyes, which was an impossibly erotic sight with those shockingly green irises of his (the stuff of many years' worth of fantasies). His mouth opened to speak a warning but nothing more than an odd whine escaped as he came.

Malfoy,

How much longer until you are cleared for duty? I will probably regret saying this, but the office is duller without you.
In point of fact, that...hadn't occurred to him.
Unfortunately, much as he'd like to laze the day away in bed with the sexy Slytherin, Harry had a job to go to. And a case that was now more important than ever to solve.
He continued working his fingers through Draco's hair, feeling the bumps and ridges of his skull and listening to his contented hums and sighs. Eventually, he brought his soapy thumbs down the back of Draco's neck to press into the tight knots of muscle there.
******
I am sick and tired of his moping. You're single and apparently bi-curious. He's hot and irrevocably (and unfortunately for me) gay. You should do something about this situation. Like writing to him. Or, better yet, shagging him senseless.
It was so bloody tight. Harry had expected that--he'd experienced it with his fingers just minutes ago and other times besides--but he hadn't been prepared for how it would feel on his prick. He wanted to thrust forward, to drive himself into that exquisite channel, but he held back for Draco's sake.
I've lived a good life. I'm willing to take that chance.

"It's gonna be ok," he said comfortingly, putting an arm around Draco's waist and holding tight. "I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."
"Malfoy," he said gruffly.

Harry scooted the heavy chair away from the table, noting the intricate scroll work of the wood and delicate embroidery in the upholstered seat. He surmised there was virtually nothing in the Manor he could afford with his paltry therapist’s salary. Even the Potter vaults would take a substantial hit if he were to try. Not that he would. Such extravagance wasn’t his style at all. For the first time, he wondered if it was Malfoy‘s.
I think I would like that. How are you as a teacher, though? I don't respond well to criticism and belittling. Not that you've done any of that lately, I just want to make sure.
*****
Draco's expression softened. "You really are a hopeless sap," he replied fondly, releasing Harry's hand to wrap both arms around his neck.
"Every time I saw you in Quidditch leathers, Auror robes, in those ridiculous muggle jeans... All I ever thought about was what it would take to get you naked and have you for all mine for a night. Longer if I could, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Harry was floored. It must be worse than he realized for Malfoy to stop even carrying his wand. After having had it taken against his will (ahem...thanks to Harry) and been so overjoyed at its return (also thanks to Harry), he couldn’t imagine that Malfoy would ever willingly part with it again.

He squeezed Draco's hand once and withdrew his arm.

His fingers itched to card through Malfoy’s hair, the strands of which, he remembered, had flown freely when the force of their magic had created noticeable breezes in the living room they now occupied. The sun was still well above the tops of the imposing trees that staked the perimeter of the Malfoy lands. It shone brightly through the many windows Harry had requested be opened to banish the pervasive gloom and stale air of disuse from the space. He could feel the light and warmth of it on his face but it was nothing compared to the heat radiating from the six-foot-plus furnace that had chosen a muggy July afternoon to reveal himself as a Hufflepuff in Slytherin’s clothing.
Potter,
Harry felt his face flame and resolutely refused to let Malfoy see it. He wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.

Harry rocked on his toes when Draco spanked him and snorted. He swiped a taste of the sauce out of the pot. It was quite good, actually. Nice consistency, flavourful blend of seasonings. He voiced his opinion and earned a pleased little smile from Draco.
Malfoy chuckled. It was almost toneless. A warm, dry puff of air Harry could imagine brushing against his skin.
"So... Still want me to ride you until your dick falls off?"
******
Harry gasped into Malfoy's mouth when his nipple was pinched. The sensation shot directly to his prick, which strained against his trousers. He widened his legs as much as he could (which wasn't much, sadly) so he could rock forward and rut against Malfoy's stomach.
He sat up and lifted Draco's rebellious hands, pressing his fingers around the slats of the headboard once again. "Do. Not. Move. Unless. I. Tell. You. To." He enunciated each word carefully, fixing Draco with his most authoritative stare.
He cast a

Malfoy licked his lips before answering, a stalling tactic Harry found far too distracting. "I have reached the limit of what a traditional Healer can do for me," he said. "Mine recommended you as someone who might help me retain the functionality I currently possess and hopefully stave off further deterioration. I was skeptical, of course, but my options are few." He cleared his throat before adding, "A man in my position can't afford to be as... discerning as I would typically prefer."
. Harry made a mental note to be cautious about introducing Draco to takeaway curry.

Bully for you.
As he disengaged the cables on the IFC machine following Adrian's session (performing the complicated task by muscle memory alone since his mind was otherwise engaged), he imagined Malfoy holed up in the Manor with no one but house-elves for company, gradually losing the strength and control he'd worked so hard to gain. Harry knew firsthand what that experience was like and he wouldn't wish it on anyone. Not even the blighter who'd ratted him out to the Press.
"Whatever," Malfoy muttered with a shrug, as if he couldn't care less about Harry or his wants.
Draco replied sweetly, the words translating to a collection of chirps and purrs.
I'm glad to see the slinky on your desk. Here is something to keep it company: a miniature Flutterby bush. It would do best with partial sun and watering twice a week, but I have been assured it is quite hardy.
Draco gasped, lurching forward as his body reshaped itself--muscle, sinew, and skin stretching, tearing, and reforming; bones grinding into new alignment.
I really have to think about it first. It is tempting, though.
******
Harry snorted. "Just remember what happened to your clothes the last time you ruined mine," he warned, ruffling Draco's hair for the fun of it (and because he could). "I'll be home by half five unless something comes up at work, which I'll firecall to warn you about if I can."
He broke away to draw his wand. "I should let Hermione know I'm safe," he prudently explained, "otherwise she really will come banging down the door. This'll be but a moment."
Draco groaned deep from within his chest as Harry spoke and forced (well, not really
Having his desire satisfied left him feeling energized and needy for more (versus Harry's post-orgasm languor, which apparently left him tired and lazy). He was already licking his way into the Auror's partly open mouth.
"Hi Gladys," he said perfunctorily, trying to convey busyness and polite disinterest. "Can I please have the restitution records from the Malfoy vaults?"
Next update same as last: I can only promise before next year.
It wasn't even that he was trying to change Malfoy's mind; the sound was simply the natural product of his violent arousal smashing against the iron wall of his integrity. He rested his forehead against Malfoy's--slick with perspiration--and tried to catch his breath a moment before climbing off with shaking legs.
Can you believe how we've been talking these past two weeks? I've told you things even Ron doesn't know and we both admitted to laughing at something the other person said. I am enjoying this a great deal more than I thought I would when you proposed it.
It was another long day at the Ministry ("long" because there hadn't been an interesting case in ages, which was a good thing for the citizenry but dreadfully boring for Aurors. The most excitement happening that week involved a flasher, one robbery, and the Weasley Wizard Wheezes shop having another explosion due to experimentation gone wrong.) He had been watching Harry mull over a large number of files for the past hour.
Draco held Potter's electric stare a moment before solicitously inquiring, "Do you require assistance with your shoes?"
When he could do no more, he gave Draco's ring a parting kiss, sat back on his heels, and took his shaft in one hand, stroking his glistening entrance with the thumb of the other.
"In that case," he replied easily, "I'm tempted to read the last chapter first."
Harry's smile was all teeth.
It was something of a novel experience for him. Usually he knew what he wanted--and what he didn't--with a high degree of certainty. But at the moment he was woefully uncertain.

"There's a park about a half mile that way," he pointed down the street. "You up for a longer walk?"
It cut an impressive figure in the skyline.
"Shit, Draco, slow down!" Harry exclaimed, slightly panicked by the unexpected turn the one-sided conversation had taken. He was processing as quickly as his adrenalin-and-anger fueled brain could manage. So far he was sticking on the fact Draco had somehow gotten it into his head that Harry might want to break up with him and his strong desire to apparate back to the restaurant to kick Zabini square in the balls. (Apparently resorting to violence was a Gryffindor trait, after all.)

"I want you to fuck me with your fingers, Harry," he purred. "I want you to finish me off. I'll do you after if you're good."
walk, especially for his small legs. ...And he rather liked being carried.
Draco smirked. "Just last Thursday I came thirteen times... In an hour," he boasted falsely. "The tingly sensation from an orgasm always leaves me stimulated enough for a few more rounds. I don't know how many I can handle when my entire body is involved, but remembering how you were in the shower has me wanting to try."
He peeled back Draco's top and kissed and stroked each new inch of uncovered skin, setting to work on his trousers when the task was accomplished. Once Draco was fully nude, he helped him step into the deep, claw-foot tub and sink down into the water until it covered everything but the peaks of his bent knees, the tops of his shoulders, and his head and neck. Petals swirled and bubbles popped, almost inaudible over the piano chords unobtrusively filling the room. The scent of lavender and candle smoke filled his nostrils, but his focus was on Draco alone.
Feeling no small measure of consternation, he attempted moving the conversation into safe, familiar territory.
So, what was wrong with Draco? Potter didn't seem to recognize him so it couldn't be their past... Was he too tall? His cologne too rich? ... Did he walk crooked and not notice?
Harry's eager grin softened. "You really didn't need to," he protested weakly, pulling Draco against him for an embrace. His mood was already much improved just by being home with him, the trials of the day fading to the background of his mind.
He wasn't even sure how to untangle his feelings--offended, irritated, hurt, angry, infatuated--but they were all on his face. He could feel it.
Draco was hardly a blushing virgin: he'd had his fair share of sexual escapades. But even in the most intimate of contexts, never had he heard the wet, urgent, panting, gasping, slapping, squelching sounds of sex with such vivid clarity and lurid detail. (He could tell without looking that Potter was using both hands to pleasure himself, which was rather more adventurous than he would have given the unsophisticated Gryffindor credit for.) It made his fur stand on end.
Remind away. I stand by it.

That was as much of a personal admission as Malfoy would get from him. Tit for tat. Hopefully it would be enough for him to retract his claws.

Draco chuckled at Harry's annoyed tone, just before moaning deep into his throat. He tried to buck forward, but Harry's free hand had him pinned.
...Not that he couldn't have made the colour work for him. But he was grateful to look the part of a proper Malfoy once again.
Which was irrational, he knew. Even with his perfect knowledge of the steps to brew the volatile potion and the process of reversal, it would probably be a full twenty-four hours before he had a working antidote if he were the one executing the task. Reason dictated he give Granger at least twice as long. And that wasn't accounting for translation time.
He didn't speak up for a long time. It took a while for him to gather the courage to find his voice. In the mean time, he had allowed himself to enjoy the feeling of flight through sudden, happy calm.
He turned to face Draco and found him huddled by the doorway, obviously frightened. He was impossibly torn between wanting to comfort him and wanting to shake some sense into his thick bloody skull. Ultimately, he could do neither.

Blaise stepped just a little closer, hand slipping around Draco's arm as quick as a snake strike to keep him from backing away too far.

Be careful with an offer like that. I'm liable to want to keep you.

Harry took in the sights of the high-end shopping district while Draco spoke. It had only been developed in the years since the war, a haven for snobs who didn't want to sully their feet with the common folk in Diagon. He'd been to a couple of the restaurants for Ministry functions and had made some owl orders from the shops but he wasn't overly familiar with the place, otherwise. He didn't care for the 'refined' atmosphere. But he understood the appeal of a private dining experience. Especially for Draco. (And differently for him; he probably wouldn't have agreed to the date if their privacy hadn't been assured.)
If you need someone to fix your paperwork just come to me after you've done them. I can correct them and have you to myself at the same time. Unlike most, I actually enjoy paperwork.
Draco licked his lips with anticipation as Potter eagerly positioned himself without assistance from Draco. There had barely been a second of time for thought before the Auror was ready and raring to go--and then nearly demanding lubrication. Draco knew the man was hard, but it was both surprising and erotic to see Harry Potter--former rival, co-worker, dream man--without hesitation for the Unspeakable.
"Off, you great ape," he ordered, shoving Potter sideways. "You'll wrinkle the robes."
"These are too short for me," he complained, indicating his bare ankles (above his equally bare feet) and the sliver of skin across his belly below the shirt Harry'd left for him. "I appreciate that they are green, but your shoulders and neck are so wide I feel like I'm swimming in the top and it's far too breezy below."
"You'll learn to love me," Draco replied playfully.
Merlin, he was fucking a bloke.
Harry didn't want to come in his trousers--and he would if Draco kept that up--so he shifted up onto his knees to cast his own shirt aside and begin tugging Draco's borrowed trousers down. The task was made easier by the fact they were considerably looser than what Draco typically wore.
Draco quirked a brow as Harry's worked. It almost looked like the rune for incarcerous but there was a subtle variation in the pattern that he couldn't place. It was definitely very complicated, and he hoped the man knew what he was doing (as he recalled, Harry was not exactly a decent student in runes. It was further proof of how he had grown).
Draco pulled most of the way out and thrust deeply once more, rocking Harry's whole body with the force of it. They groaned in unison. Beneath the hot sting was a blooming pleasure Harry knew would only intensify with time. He focused on that, on the feeling of his body stretching, opening to accommodate Draco's cock. That sensation was his favourite part of sex and the reason he bottomed more often than not; there was nothing else quite like it.
He pulled out to his first knuckles and paused to wait a few seconds for Harry to take the lube and begin properly slicking himself before adding a third finger and shoving back inside roughly, smashing directly onto his prostate with his fingertips. The moan that followed was loud and unbridled, it came from deep in his belly. His orgasm was beginning to bubble and caused his hand to move more frantically.
*****
The ginger terror was his second favourite tiny person, right behind Teddy. It was a pity to think of her unwell.
Harry chewed the edge of his thumbnail to a ragged mess as he pondered the unpleasant possibility, Adrian's file left forgotten before him.
Harry nodded and walked around his desk to retrieve the potion out of a locked and warded drawer underneath. He didn't think less of Malfoy for requesting it. The memory would be hard on him, he knew. He also knew how unsettling the whole experience was for him. (And it would be a bit of the pot calling the kettle black, given that Harry kept the draught in his office for his own personal use; Auror work could be…unpleasant, at times.)
That is exactly what I am doing.
"And since when do you have a Floo?" Pansy interrupted, attempting to look past Draco and into the room. "You're at his house already?" she gasped. "Why didn't you tell me immediately, and why am I not allowed to know who he is?"
Draco,
It was far too early in the morning for Draco's taste when he first woke up to the sound of beak tapping on glass. He blinked his eyes open and slowly moved to stare at the window where his dark-green curtains shielded his sensitive gaze from the harsh light of day. The tapping came again, obviously insistent. Draco yawned as he carefully unwrapped himself from his cocoon of blankets--just before he jumped with a cry and fell. A loud, wall shaking "Boom!" indicated another insane storm. As the blonde grunted and rubbed his bruised backside (forgetting the sheets he had pulled off the bed in his surprise for now), he wondered how he had been sleeping at all with so much noise.
******
"I'll prove it."
The reason, when it came to him, was obvious, and he relaxed somewhat to have reckoned it.
Panting slightly, Harry pressed his middle finger inside.
However, his attention was instantly caught by the sudden darkening of the entire theater. A sharp, sudden playing of notes caught his ears and nearly deafened him. He turned wide eyes on Harry, who was wisely quick to comfort him before panic began to set in. He breathed a long sigh of relief and turned back to the stage.
"As for your appearance--" he took his time appraising Potter from head to toe, even going so far as to remove Potter's spectacles and attempt straightening his unruly hair (a lost cause). "Between your heavy jaw, broad shoulders, and visible chest hair, you make a frightfully ugly woman. But as a man in a dress?" he smiled broadly. "The prettiest I've ever seen, I think. Though it is a bit strange to be looking up at you."
Draco sat up in a panic. There was a crash downstairs as what he assumed was one of his prized vases was smashed against the wall. With wide-eyes and a tight grasp on the blanket, he turned to Harry.
*****
"You're right," he said earnestly, setting his food aside and taking up Draco's hand. "I've been a prick. I'm sorry I dismissed your good news and was careless about Zabini and teased you about the chips and pushed you out of the way." (He was probably most sorry about the loss of 'sexy time' but he thought better than to say so.) "Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?" he beseeched.
What Harry said out loud was: I'll think on it.
Godrick. That was an understatement. Harry couldn't get enough of the man.
It was also untrue.
"With your progressive attitude and so much, uh, opportunity around you, what stopped you from sleeping with anyone before now?"
I doubt you would accept a nice pair of shoes (something leather and bespoke, for example), so instead here is a new pair of trainers to replace the threadbare ones you sport outside of work.
The door remained unlocked. He didn't think for one second about securing his home while he was so thoroughly and delightfully occupied. Voldemort himself could trapeze through fully nude and he'd not have noticed or cared.
"I know it doesn't look pretty, but it's good," he asserted. "Just give it a chance yeah?" He popped a chip into his mouth to show Draco it wasn't poison. Unfortunately, it was hot enough to burn. He tried to surreptitiously suck in air to cool his scorched mouth.
be boring," he replied.
Well, I am so eager for your arrival that I already got the party started, so to speak. I haven't let myself come, but I am loose and wet and aching for you. I don't think we'll make it to the bed. Not for the first round, anyway.
Feeling slightly better about the affair, Harry thanked her sincerely and walked with Draco to the umbrella tables outside.
It's driving me mad thinking about you every moment and with no way to reach you in person, my sweet, noble, snuggly Gryffindor!
"I'm sorry, honestly. It just sort came out! There's a lot I have wanted to yell at him about for years, and you did too until you started shagging him. My brother is dead because of him, but I'm still here! I'm trying, really, but you've always been better at letting go of grudges," which wasn't saying a lot, considering how stubborn Harry was. "I'll do my best to just ignore the g--Malfoy. Draco. Tonight. Just be patient with me, eh? And you have permission to hex me senseless if I fuck up again. You know 'Mione won't stop you, though I am surprised Malfoy tried..."
His mind raced. That was why Malfoy had warned him. And why he'd been acting strangely. Two years ago someone had tricked him into dropping his guard by looking like Harry and offering a friendly smile. Malfoy had reacted to that simple gesture as if it was sunlight after a long winter storm. And that had nearly gotten him killed.
