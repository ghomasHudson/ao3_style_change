home.  He turned his head to look at Harry’s pleading eyes, knowing there was only one thing to say.
“Yeah, mate, that was really good, even if it was muggle food.”
He leaned over to the other two, whispering back and forth for a moment.  He finally nodded, and leaned back in his chair.  “Er, Minister, my clients would like to amend their pleas.”
Harry, left arm still wrapped around Draco’s back, reached over with his right, picked up the blocks of cheese, placed them on the platter, picked up the knife he was using to cut them up, stabbed it into one of the blocks, and then thrust it out for Hermione to come get.
“It’s not like this is going to be the one and only time, Potter!  Get the fuck on with it!”
Harry groaned as he reread a paragraph.  “You know, I think you’re right.”  He stood to go get the plate of toast he had made for Draco, setting it down on the table and moving to sit on Draco’s lap, who scooted back from the table to accommodate him.
“So grown up! And look at your beautiful grown-up dress!”  He stepped farther into the room, spinning her around so her dress skirt flowed out from her body a little. She giggled, holding onto his neck as he asked, “And where’s your brother?”
“Harry! There you are!” Ron shouted at him, waving.
Harry wrote the last few words on his assignment, and then said out-loud to no one in particular, “Finished!  I’m going to go put my things away.”
“Potter, table for two,” Harry said, glancing over at Draco.
“Well, first, I wanted to thank you for coming up with such a brilliant way to get around our families.”
Soon, the men were up and dressed, and walked out to the common room: they noticed Seamus and Dean sitting on the couch, eating breakfast.
“I know.  I don’t know what I was thinking.”  He sifted his hands through Harry’s hair, causing Harry to moan lightly and tilt his head as if to follow Draco’s hand.
over the tabletop.
Smiling sheepily, Harry nodded.
“Yours are in my bedroom,” Harry said as he gripped Draco’s hand and pulled him up the stairs.
Teddy perked up at the mention of Christmas.  “Uh huh!  I can’t wait to give Nana the gift that we bought at Diagon Alley!  And I made you both something at school!”
1. I'm sorry!
A tear slipped down his right cheek, Draco swiping at it instantaneously.  “I just— Then the worst year of my life happened: sixth year.  I was trying to protect my family and do what I was told, but I just wanted it all to end.  And then you showed up in that bathroom.
Harry found himself mesmerised.
“Absolutely.  A great adventure with two of my favourite people,” Draco said with a sigh, leaning over to kiss Harry.
“I…my parents weren’t…”  He sighed again.  “I knew they loved me, but I was never shown it through hugs or kisses.  My mother would hug me, of course, but only when father wasn’t around.  He was always working when I was younger, so I only saw him when I peeked through the door to his study.
Harry gave Teddy a quick bath, and then put him to bed.  Deciding to call it an early night as well, he trudged upstairs and quickly took off his clothes.  Crawling into bed, he found his mind drifting back to his and Draco’s conversation earlier in the day, and the consequent talk with Hermione and Ron.  Harry’s mind flooded with ideas of what to say to Draco, but nothing really conveyed what he wanted to say and how he felt.  With words floating through his head, he fell asleep.
“Draco’s thought of that.  Come on.”  She opened the door to the back garden, motioning for them to follow her as she buttoned up her cloak.  Stepping outside, Harry saw that there was a clear path through the snow, towards the back fence.  They walked over to just behind the shed.  As they stepped around the corner, Harry felt a change in the wards.
“You’re brilliant.  I knew there was a reason I kept you around,” Draco teased, moving to straddle the bar.
He had just about finished removing the paper from the largest wall, when he got that tell-tell prickle at the back of his neck.
“I just need to go down to the kitchen to get my money bag, and then I’ll be ready.  Would you like to see it?  I finished it the other day.”
Harry could tell that Draco was nervous about something.  He pushed his foot under the table, touching Draco’s.  The blond looked up at him, a slight smile appearing on his face.
They walked into the room, stepping over to the fireplace.  Harry pulled down the bowl of powder, holding it out to Draco.  Draco took a small handful, kissed Harry once more, said goodnight, and then disappeared in a flash of green flames.
“Good afternoon, sir,” she squeaked.  “Mitsy will help you.”  She walked around Harry, snapping her fingers and causing the fabric to shrink in certain areas and lengthen in others.  She changed the colours several times, until becoming satisfied and stepping back.  “How does sir like it?”
They hadn’t even gotten two thirds of the way to the door before they saw it spring open, and a small body came sprinting towards them.
.  “I don’t believe it,” he whispered, wide eyed.
“Er, about that,” Harry said, scratching the back of his head.
Draco landed on the edge of the Burrow’s property line.  He paused a moment to let his anger die down and was immediately swept up in sadness.  He didn’t know what was going on with Harry, and didn’t know how to even broach the subject.
“I’ll take him to lunch tomorrow and slap him around a bit then, how about that?”
Teddy went over to look for his name on the presents, giving Harry and Draco a moment.  “I can’t believe that little boy,” Harry said, looking at the stag.
“Godric, yes.  We fell asleep still in our wedding clothes.  Thank Merlin for Hermione and Pansy, though, who made sure that we got room service the next morning.”
She shooed him out of the door before he could see the tears start falling from her eyes.
“Nah, how would you?  We’ve managed to keep it out of the papers, thankfully.  My life is always the talk of the nation, so we tried to keep it silent.”
Harry wished to kiss those soft lips again, but knew it would not be a good thing out on the street; who knew who might be around the corner.
“Tea?” Kingsley asked, motioning to the kettle sat on the corner of the desk.
It was Draco’s turn to say, “Wait.  What?!”
Blaise groaned, waving a hand at them.  “You even use the same phrases!  Just get on with it, already!”
“Together,” Draco whispered, snuggling into Harry’s back and drifting off to sleep.
Draco sighed as he thought back over the last six months.  Harry had been so distant as of late.  He hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d said that Harry hadn’t touched him in months.  Not even a kiss good morning, now that he really thought about it.
“What do you want me to do, hmm?”
Harry could have sworn he heard a muffled “Merlin knows why” coming from across the circle.
“What did he say?”
Harry stood, stretching and popping his back, sighing in relief.  He motioned for Hermione to go on as he made his way up to his room and the en suite.  His clothes were lain out on the bed, and Harry smiled at how much Hermione was taking care of him.
“I’m so happy for you, Harry,” Luna said, causing Harry to snap out of staring at his boyfriend.  “I always thought you and Draco would make a lovey couple.”
Harry gave Draco another kiss, and then started out the door.  “Oh, one more thing.  Who are we telling first?  Your parents?”
He pulled back, cupping Harry’s face.  “Go.  You’re going to be late.”
At this part, Draco cut in.  “It truly felt as if Fiendfyre was burning me.  Harry was still gripping my wand, but after he was able to release it, the pain diminished.  I then tried doing an array of spells, and it was working fine; it was mine again.  I haven’t had any issues with it, since.”
“You didn’t disturb, we were wanting to talk to you, anyway,” Seamus said.
“Come on, let’s watch some more telly, and then get some sleep.”
Harry moaned as he felt the delicious slide of Draco inside of him.
“So, that was the portrait of my great aunt, you said?  Seems like a lovely woman,” he added, sarcastically.
Thank you for the reviews and kudos!  Makes me very happy!  :)
Harry paused in the middle of the sidewalk and emitted a mock gasp, placing his palm over his heart, as he said, “Oi! I think I have it far worse! I'm going to be stuck with
Draco took a breath and said, “I was a complete tit about it, I'll admit.” Harry heard a snort coming from one of the chairs, and saw Pansy roll her eyes at Draco.  That made him chuckle.  Draco flipped her two fingers, and continued as if he hadn't been interrupted, “But to answer your question, yes, I actually did get hurt.  I have a scar on my shoulder, actually.  When it gets really cold, it, along with my other one, ache something awful.”
Draco’s eyebrows creased as he looked at the concerned look on Harry’s face.  “What am I promising?”
Draco turned and ran up the stairs.
Narcissa gave them an innocent look.  “To what do you mean, darling?”
“I’ll try and rearrange my schedule and see if I can get the rest of the day off.”
The 8
Harry’s eyes widened.  “Oh, no.  What did she do?  What did she say?”
~*~*~
As they walked towards the main part of the city, hand-in-hand, Draco asked Harry, “How are you feeling?”
Harry walked them into the room, showing them all of the additions they had done to it with the extension charms, the bath, and closets.
Harry growled as he forced Draco away from himself.  He turned and pulled open a drawer, taking out a pair of muggle denims and a jumper.
Harry rushed around the cot to the other side, to help raise Draco’s bed so that he could drink the potion.  Just as he finished gulping it, Professor McGonagall walked through the doors, followed immediately by Narcissa.
Walking into his kitchen, he saw that Hermione was not alone.  Ron, Ginny, and Neville were all seated at the table, which had a breakfast feast sitting atop it.
“He cast a charm on both of our wands, sifting through the spells that had been cast on that evening.  I honestly have no idea how he narrowed it down to that specific time, but he and McGonagall seemed to understand it.  Ollivander wrote a statement of his own, which McGonagall says we can use when we have to testify at the trial.”
Draco was jostled along, getting more and more agitated.  Finally, Harry stopped them.  He manoeuvred Draco around, finally releasing him.
“I am.  Very happy.”
“Are you serious?!”  Teddy jumped up and hugged Harry around his waist before moving over to Draco and doing the same.  He walked back over to where he had been sitting near the tree and read the scrap of parchment over and over.  He was still grinning as he made his way up towards his room an hour later, to get ready to go to the Burrow.
I appreciate any comments and Kudos!  Makes my day!
“You really think that’ll actually happen?”  Harry sighed as he sat up in the bed.
“I do, actually.  We’re friends, right?  Maybe more?  I’d like to know about your life before Hogwarts.”
He stood with his back up against the door, watching his fiancé move hangers and pull out different slacks, then look at himself in the mirror. From this vantage point, he could see the sharp lines of his lover’s shoulder blades and spine. Dragging his eyes south, he admired the pert swell of that beautiful arse as Draco pulled the fabric up.
Harry watched as Draco started towards the stairs back down to the floo.  He felt his stomach clench as he watched Draco walk away from hm, again.  Surprising himself, he suddenly lurched off the wall and quickly walked towards Draco.
Stepping out, he quickly took in the empty room.  He walked towards the kitchen, where he heard voices.
They walked across the hall, Ron and Hermione sitting on the couch, with Harry sitting in one of the chairs.  Leaning forward so his elbows were on his knees, he nodded towards Hermione to speak.
“Too early,” Harry said as he turned over and blearily looked at Teddy.  “Are your nan and auntie awake, too?”
“We have been over this and over this, Ron!  I don’t want to fight anymore!  Too many people have died!  No more!”
“I—um, yes.  After I apologized to him, we had a nice long conversation.  I found that I could tell him things I'd never told anyone before.  I had time the following week, so I went back down to visit.  It soon became a weekly thing.  This week has only been the second time I've missed, and I—”
“It’s ready!”  He put the bread in a basket, and sat it on the table as well.  He picked up Teddy and sat him in the chair at the end of the table, and Harry took the seat across from Draco.
They went through their nightly routine, and then crawled into bed, facing each other.
Weasley? You? Wait, what?”
They were standing in the middle of the kitchen, unloading their pockets of their shopping, unshrinking the packages and appliances.  The large appliances had easily been magicked into their correct spots.  Harry was pleased to see that the kitchen was already starting to come together.
“In third year, did you
“Very well, actually.  We’re in the middle of doing the kitchen, but that won't take very long to finish.  We haven't done much with the other bedrooms, but I'm hoping to get a few done over hols.”
“Seems to be my wand again,” Malfoy said with a slight smile.
After receiving several more presents from the others, it was Harry’s turn to present his.  He stood up, handing Teddy to Andromeda, and then went to stand in front of the tree.
Harry waved back at them, and then turned back to Draco.  “You were going to say something?”
“Oh, no. I'm going to need a whole lot more alcohol in me to play that game!”
Sorry it's been so long since I have updated, but this chapter just didn't want to be nice to me.  There is a bit of a time jump (which I think will happen more often than not, now.)
Inside the box lay a beautiful glass dragon that curved along its body.  It sat upon two hind legs, and one front, the other in the air.  “It’s gorgeous,” Draco said.  “Wherever did you find it?”
Seamus leaned forward and asked, “Like what?”
“Yes, Mr Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall said, “Can you please tell us what happened?”
“There’s one over there, too,” Harry pointed out.
Harry felt a rush of something he couldn’t quite place as he said, “It truly is.  You definitely know how to choose a mattress.  You could always come and join me.  Find out for yourself just how comfortable?”  He looked over at Draco, giving him a smug look.
Harry felt as though his insides were coming undone.   He didn’t want to even think of how many lives were lost because of him.  He was the cause of all of this, and suddenly he couldn’t stand up any longer.  He moved so he could sit in a chair, but before he could actually press himself into it, Ron and Hermione were beside him, holding him up.
“I’m sor—”
Harry blushed as he realised he’d been found out.  “I—I have to leave soon…” he whispered into the darkness.
“That won’t be necessary, no.  What’s brought this on so suddenly though, if I may ask?  You’re still quite young, and in your prime.”
“Oh, you know, the usual: eat lots of sweets, fly brooms around the city, buy out Weasley Wheezes.  That sort of thing,” Harry said with a smile and a wink at Teddy.
“Oh, really?” Harry asked, leaning on the table.  “How did that happen?”
“Fine,” he pouted, but immediately perked up.  “Can you open your present from me, though?”  He looked back and forth between them.
Draco rolled over so they were laying nose to nose.  “For everything.  For taking me back.  For being my friend, for being my boyfriend, for going with me today, for—”
“Touch yourself, babe.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other and started laughing.  Draco came over and ruffled his hair, which was turning half black and half platinum blond.  "You can call me whatever you want to, okay kiddo?"
I thought I would get to Christmas in this chapter, but as I reached ~11.5k, I figured I'd better hold off.
This chapter was going to cover the entirety of the holidays, but with this already being nearly 11,000 words, I figured I would cut it into two, maybe three parts.  It depends on how well I can fit everything in that I want to do.
Before Draco could say anything else, Kreacher had popped out of the room.  Draco turned to the women, saying, “I will just go get Harry.”  He smiled slightly at them, turning and walking quickly out of the room.
He heard Ron groan from across the room, and then he heard a gasp and sigh coming from his bed; Draco had given him a Hangover Potion, as well.  It appeared he was making the rounds in their dorm, as he heard Neville next.  He smiled to himself, then got out of bed.
“Harry?”
Stepping out into the hall, Harry flicked his wand, sending the many bags that Andromeda had brought up to Teddy’s room as he walked across to the lounge.  He pulled the soft blanket that Andromeda had given him for Christmas off of the back of the couch, sitting down in the recliner.
Harry leaned his head out of the dining room to look up at Draco, who was standing at the top of the first floor landing, and said, “Happy Birthday!  Can you come help me with something?  I want to get this done, and then we can go to dinner.”
As he was speaking, Draco began pacing up and down the hall, his hands sliding through his hair in a continuous manner.
“Sir, all due respect, but I am quite serious.”
Ron rolled his eyes before saying, “Seriously, though, why not?”
Taking a breath, he looked up at Draco and said with a smirk, “That is definitely more than one question. But, well, er, it was Umbridge.”
“Wait, you mean to tell me you didn’t have a bedroom?  With a bed?”
“Don’t say I never gave you anything,” Draco smirked from across the room, delivering Blaise his potion, then walking out of their room to deliver potions to the rest of their classmates.
Draco turned away from Ron, who was stepping into the fireplace, and walked across the hall towards the lounge. He paused in the doorway and just watched Harry sleep. He felt as if he could stand there and watch the man sleep all day, but at the same time, he wanted to be able to spend time with a lucid Harry, so he smoothly crossed the room, carefully manuevering himself until he was sat across Harry’s form, causing him to awake.
Smiling shyly up at Arthur, Harry picked up a broken torch sitting on a shelf.  “I flooed in a couple of hours ago…” Harry spoke the last words in an elongated way.
Draco nodded, standing up and walking with Harry towards the bar.
“I honestly don’t know.  There’s no way.  Right?”  He looked back at Draco, who just shrugged.
“Thank you, Harry, for the wonderful meal.  And thank you, too, for taking care of Teddy today.  I did not expect to see Narcissa this morning, but I am so glad I did.”
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said.  He still wasn’t sure how, but they had managed to keep their engagement out of the press, but he had a sick feeling in his gut that that photograph showed Draco’s ring, front and center.  “I think we’ve just been outed.”
“I…I wasn’t sure if you’d want me to be there.”
“‘Ello you lot. I havn’ seen yeh’s all in a while. And yeh, Draco. Missed yeh for tea, this week.”
They sat there in silence for a few moments before Narcissa said, “Well, it is just about the time I said I would be here.  Is it fine if I go up to attic?”
“To be such a bloody tease.”
“Oh, he definitely has.  Anyway, we started out with breakfast in Piccadilly.  I’ll have to take you there soon; it is delicious.  While we were eating, I kept asking him what he wanted to do.  At first, he kept asking if we could go see you.  It broke my heart to tell him we couldn’t, and he just couldn’t understand why not.”  Draco gave Harry a sad smile, who returned it, genuinely.
To answer your question, though, I’ve got nothing on for today.  Do you?”
“As am I,” Narcissa said.  “Wandlore is a fascinating subject.”
They walked down the street, glancing in the stores, people watching and just enjoying their evening.  They ended up stopping at a little diner, where they ordered a hearty stew and the most delicious roll.
He pulled back, leaning their foreheads together.  “You’re not so bad yourself,” Draco whispered back.
“I like the way you think, Mione!  Ron, go get some blankets out of the closet, and I’ll go get the cocoa.”
Made of white gold, it was an outline of an open book, but the outline wasn’t completely closed.  It was slanted, so the top left corner of the design was where the chain attached.  Also in the corner was a small sapphire, and a larger heart-shaped diamond just underneath that.  In all, Harry thought it looked exquisite, and he was even more sure that Hermione was going to love it.
He suddenly was ready for the day to be over, so that he could drink himself into a stupor.
“Potter, you’re killing me!”
Draco sighed, quickly wiping his face.  He walked back through the house, making sure everything was turned off and put away, and casting stasis charms on the rooms.  Stepping into the hearth, he took a long look at the room, cast a stasis charm, and then called out, “Malfoy Manor!” before disappearing in a twist of green flames.
Looking around the room, again, he decided to start on the wallpaper that lined all of the walls.  He used a spell that he had found in one of the books that he had bought at the beginning of term which caused the glue to dissolve, letting the paper fall off in large chunks.  The paper was still in decent shape, so he figured he would put some of it back up in Kreacher’s new nest: he hadn’t forgotten the promise he had made on his birthday.
Harry went into the en-suite and brushed his teeth.  Swiping a brush through his locks, he quickly gave up and went back out to stand in front of Draco.
“Yeah, and actually, I was going to ask if you would want to go with me.  I have something I need to get in muggle London, and was hoping you’d be able to help me, mate,” Ron said.
Eh? Any good?
When Harry didn’t speak again, Draco finally looked up at him.  “Sorry, what?”
Harry looked back over at the owl, which was helping himself to the rest of the contents of Harry’s plate.  He hadn’t even thought about Sirius’s middle name.  Of course, that was absolutely fitting.  How had Draco—.
“Well, this is just perfection!  Delicious food, and the decorations are great, Ted!”
“Cold!  We made five snowmans, and mummy taught us about snow angels, and and!  Snow is cold!”  She sounded winded when she explained it all, as if she had been running.
As per his word to Professor McGonagall, Harry had helped with the restoration of Hogwarts.  He had donated quite a bit of money, and when he could, he would go and help with the clean-up.  He didn’t go very often, though, because seeing the castle in disarray was too depressing; too many memories from the night of the battle.
When they next woke up, it was to the sun shining through the curtains, and the normal sounds of the rest of their dorm mates getting ready for the day.  Harry slid open the curtains, blearily reaching for his glasses.
He took a big, gulping breath.  Harry waited for him to continue, and after a few moments, he did.
“Don’t you dare finish that sentence, Potter, or I’ll leave.”
“We’ve had a nice chat, is all,” Ron said as he stood up and walked over to Hermione, giving her a kiss on the cheek.
“I hoped you saved room for dessert, though.”  Harry winked at Draco as he gave him a questioning look.
“Show off.”  Hearing Draco’s muttering beside him made Harry laugh and lose his hold on the objects; the book fell onto the table, with the feather floating down beside it.  Harry grabbed the book and put it on top of his bag, and then focused on the feather again.
Harry had gone up to his room to put his things away, and then slowly made his way down stairs, stopping in front of one of the bedrooms on the second floor.  He opened the door, and looking around, got an idea.  He
year students had been getting on very well the past few weeks, thanks to the wonderful invention of Firewhiskey.  Seamus had somehow been able to smuggle in several bottles, and so they partook of the spirits on Thursday evenings.  This was because the only class the group had on Friday’s was Potions, and since that didn’t begin until after lunch, they had ample time to overcome their hangovers before facing a professor.
alive!  I was beginning to wonder…”  Harry grinned up at him.
“You mean…” Harry looked over at Draco, who just nodded, before turning back to her.  “You’re going to be doing the ceremony?”
“The diamond was your grandfather’s.”
“To you, my love.”
Harry did not fail to notice Draco’s relaxed posture.
Merlin, this is really happening.  They had only been engaged for just over four weeks, but this made perfect sense.  Of course they both wished that they could have all of their families and friends there, but this was about the two of them, at the end of the day.
“Well, some of the aurors had said that according to Mr Malfoy’s—sorry, Draco’s—story, he disappeared from the second floor of the Knight Bus in a circle of bright, white light.  When I heard that, I knew it couldn’t have been apparition, as we would have been notified here at the Ministry, per your probation.”
“Eh, I’ve had a few days off, and have gotten to spend some time with Draco, so we thought we would have a party, so I could see everyone else!  I’m missed y—”
“Okay, Ted.  We’re getting up.  Go down to the sitting room, but do not touch anything until we get there, alright?”
“Because…”
Day 6 Prompt:
Pulling everything out of one of the bags that Andy had brought, Harry quickly repacked it with several nappies, Teddy’s dinner, a bottle, a toy, and a change of clothes.
“Maybe thirty minutes.  Might as well shower.”
Draco smiled, and pulled him in for another kiss.  “Me, too.  Me, too.”
Draco nodded.
Merry Christmas!
Harry made sure the angle was right, and then started short, fast drives, pounding against Draco’s prostate.  He glanced down and saw Draco’s purple cock was thumping against his stomach, leaking an abundance of pre-come out of the tip.
“Sure I do.  Neither of us had more than a few chips to eat last night.  I know I’m starving, so I can only imagine how you’re feeling.”
you can just fuck me here and now, and
“He always looks good, mother,” he replied quietly, looking over at his husband.
“What’s going on?”
Another part had cases of jewelry, both for men and for women.
“Oh hush.  I’m staying with Pansy tonight, and I will see you tomorrow morning.  You’ll survive, I promise!”
The both went down to the kitchen to see what all Kreacher had done, but were stopped by the old elf as they passed the dining room.
Harry smiled as he watched Draco saunter up the staircase.  Godric, he loved that man.  He turned and went down to the kitchen.  He plated the sandwiches Molly had given him, and then found some grapes and cheese in the fridge.  He opened a bottle of wine, and grabbed two glasses.
“When aren’t you, mate?”
Draco looked over at his mother, who looked as if she had seen a ghost.  “Dr—Dromeda?”
“Of course!  I put up a tree in the lounge and have all of the presents for everyone under there, anyway.”
Draco twisted on the couch and lifted up the book.  “This is a first edition of Most Potente Potions and is signed by the author!  Seriously, HOW?!”
“I’d love to.  They’re closed until after the new year, but how about the first week in January?”
He looked around at the people, trying to find the unmistakeable head of his (hopefully still) boyfriend.  As his eyes swept the room, they didn't land on green; they locked on the brown of Hermione’s.  He grimaced slightly, glancing down at the floor as she stared at him; there was no doubt in his mind that Harry had spoken to his best friends about all that had happened.
to you… And you had that… Oh, bloody hell.  That is so fucking hot!”
I hope you like the interactions between the characters.  This is my first fic, so it is difficult getting their mannerisms right.
His breathing was stuttered, and his dick was harder than it had ever been.
“Where? Who?”
“Because I know it’s the truth, and everyone needs to hear it.  I trust you.  It may seem mad, but I do.”
Harry laughed as he pulled some bread out of the pantry.  “With garlic bread.”
Harry followed Draco down the stairs, where they began discussing ideas.
This had begun the Slytherin’s Apology Tour.  Malfoy apologized to the rest of the 8
Harry continued.  “I used that wand to eventually kill Voldemort.”
“Yeah, he came round for Sunday lunch every week without fail.  His mum even came with him a couple of times.”
“Good plan,” Draco chuckled.  “Speaking of, our portkey is scheduled to leave in about 10 minutes.  We should probably get to reception and pick it up.”
“Alright.”  He put the cloak back and pulled out his wool coat.  He helped Draco slip it on and picked up his bag.  Draco picked up his own and pulled out the hangar that was their portkey.  Harry looked up at the clock on the mantle and touched the hangar as well.  “Five, four, three, two, one…”
Harry pulled back after several moments, grabbing the sides of Draco’s face, saying, “Gods, it’s good to see you.  I’ve missed you something terrible.”
“I've changed my mind, again.”
“I’m fine!  Promise.”  Harry didn’t feel like getting into it with his friends, so quickly moved forward, leaving them to look at each other, shrugging.
They said their goodbye’s and floo’d back to Grimmauld Place.
He was interrupted by Kreacher apparating into the room.
Draco gripped Harry’s bicep, and they walked toward the restaurant.  Harry opened the door for Draco as they stepped through, stomping the snow off of their shoes.
McGonagall nodded.  “That is what I assumed.  Is this a new wand?  Or is it…”
Draco was awoken by a rush of ecstasy wracking his body.  He moaned as he blinked his eyes open.  His hand automatically fell to the back of Harry’s head, as he took the full length of Draco’s cock into his mouth, the tip hitting the back of his throat.
He took a breath before whispering, “I am just so glad you’re home safe.  I was so scared while you were gone, and I didn’t really have anyone to talk to about it.”
“Oh, those pancakes," Draco moaned.  "Please tell me we are going to get pancakes for breakfast.”
“When I received Draco’s letter a few days ago, asking if it would be possible for me to marry them, here at Hogwarts, I was beyond thrilled.  But, as I read more, I realized what it was they were doing.  I apologize if I overstepped my boundaries, but I immediately wrote to Hermione, and we started hatching a plan.
“Well, you two are—” Ron was interrupted by Hermione jabbing her elbow into his stomach.  “Oh, I mean, er…”
Draco lifted his head, and while sniffing, chuckled to himself.
He couldn’t believe they were here.  Draco had chosen the spot where their feud had begun; the place where they had hated each other for seven long years.  But, this was also the place where they let bygones be bygones, and became friends.  This was the place where they had spent many an hour sitting next to each other in the common room, talking about anything and everything.  Talking of their hopes; of their fears.
He looked at himself in the mirror as he brushed his teeth and cast a shaving charm on his face.  He studied the scars that covered his torso, old and new.  He traced the lines of the scar that crossed from his right shoulder down to just above his left hip.  The one
“Much, much better, yes.  It’s still day to day, but…”
Harry couldn’t believe what Draco was saying, but knew he was defeated for the moment.  Looking at his watch, he said, “What about this afternoon?  We can go to a few stores that are a couple of roads over.”
“Fuck, you’re beautiful.  Are you ready?”
“Back to Potter, are we?”
Harry took it in his mouth as far as he could, gripping the rest when he began to gag.  He stroked it a few times, moving his tongue around, sucking on it, when suddenly Draco shuddered underneath him, screaming, “Harry!”
Once his orgasm had completely subsided, and his breathing became regular once again, he cleaned up his mess, pulled up his pajamas, and released the spells around his bed.  Pulling the curtains back, he pulled on his glasses as he got out to grab some clothes and his shower things, coming face to face with the star of his wet dream.
Ron nodded as he left the room, shutting the door behind him.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it.  I hope you were able to clear your head some.”
Draco stood there stunned for a few moments, before saying loud enough that Harry could hear him through the closed closet door, “Didn't know you had it in you.”
“My sentiments, exactly.  I just didn’t know if you wanted me to walk behind you, or how—”
Teddy looked up into Harry’s eyes.  Draco couldn’t see what he did, but the grin on Harry’s face meant something important had happened.  Harry pecked several kisses on his godson’s head and cheeks.  This caused Teddy to squeal again, wiggling in Harry’s arms.
“No worries, Nev! You’re always invited! It’s that girlfriend of yours that I’ve got a problem with,” Harry said with a shite-eating grin.
There was a light tap on his shoulder, and when he turned around, there was Draco, looking far more gorgeous than Harry had ever seen him.
“They will likely flip, but I’m okay with that.  Our wedding is supposed to be about us.  Not your mother, not Molly, not anyone else but you and me.”  Toss.
Harry paled a bit at that information; he wanted Ginny to be happy.  He looked over at Ron and said, “I saw Malfoy, and decided that it was high time for him to get his wand back.  We are meeting on Friday, and I am giving it back.”
~*~*~*~*~
Draco “Harry, I—”
“Draco?”  Harry looked confused, blinking several times.
The man at the end of the table, who had been nearly silent the entire time he had been sitting there, suddenly stood up, knocking his chair over.  “Draco, may I speak to you?”  Draco raised his brow.  “In private.”
, I can do.  Come on.”  He spun on his heel, pulling them towards their bedroom.
“He came to me before the end of term with this idea,” Ron said with a grin. “I told him we had tried taking it down when we were here during 5th Year, with no luck.”
The room was so dark and dank.  The deep blue wall paper made it seem like it was so much smaller than it actually was.  The furniture that was still intact was definitely old Black heirlooms.  He could see that Black family crest on the arms of the couch and chairs, and engraved in the legs of the tables.  He didn’t know what he would do with the furniture, but he knew that he wanted up-to-date furnishings.
Harry pulled the note out of his pocket, saying, “She was asking if it would be alright if Goyle and Nott came to the party on Thursday.”
Draco choked on his bite of eggs, peering over at Harry.  “What?”
“Uh oh,” Ginny said, as she glanced at Hermione.  “This can’t be good.”
“Well… I, um… needed Ron’s help in finding something.”
“I know.  Isn’t it great?  He has an eye for the design of things.  Like I said before, he designed the en-suite in my room.  I had an idea, but then he came up, told me I was a blithering idiot, and re-did it all.  It’s brilliant.”  He didn’t speak aloud the words
“Do you realize that this will be our first Christmas, together?” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear.
Trying to get another reaction, Harry did it again, but slower.  He watched his fingers start at Draco’s neck, slowly descending down.  He noticed a few small scars near Draco’s collarbone, but didn’t think much of it, until he got to the large one that criss-crossed across Draco’s front.
“Don’t think I didn’t see you and Ron playing chess the other day, too.  Just keep doing what you’re doing, and you’ll be amazed what comes out of it.”
“You…you made this?  After only a few months of lessons?  How… how?!”
Snapping back to reality, he saw that Draco had a tie on, and was buttoning up his jacket.
Harry had finally sat up on the couch.  He sighed, setting the biscuit down on the table and ran his hand through his hair and down his face.  “I don’t feel like dealing with a family party tonight, Draco.  I don’t want to go.”
“Hmmm… Want to share a shower,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear.  They held hands as they walked into the en suite.
“That is it, entirely.  I am so sick of the fighting and antagonizing.  I don’t think I would enjoy doing that every day.”
“Brilliant!  We’re going to go robe shopping,” he said with a smile.
“No, I believe he said ‘appeased,’”
As he made it to the landing of the first floor, the voices became clearer and recognizable.
“As it is, I will see you tomorrow when Mother comes over to get the furniture.”
He saw a sweater that he could see Draco wearing, and was able to purchase it without him knowing.
“That’s easy.”  Harry discreetly shifted his wand down his sleeve and cast a spell to keep the bike upright.  “We just have to make sure that one of us is holding onto it the entire time, so it looks like we’re keeping it upright.”
Harry asks Draco a very special question.
Their photo was of them walking down Diagon Alley.  If Harry had to guess, it was taken sometime during the summer that Fleur had worked at Gringott’s.
Taken aback from the offhanded compliment, Draco replied with a cheeky grin, “This is true.  However, she could be worse.  I mean, really, the old Gryffindor seeker was as bad as it could get.”
Kingsley sat still for a moment, eyes wide, before he jumped up with far more agility than Harry had seen any other man of his size do.  He swiftly moved around his desk before gripping Harry’s hand in a firm handshake, and then pulled him to his feet in order to give him a hug, hand clapping hard onto Harry’s back.
As soon as they had gotten into Grimmauld, Draco had floo’d to the Manor to drop off his things and visit with his mother, but promised to be back soon to lend a hand with the kitchen.
“Good,” he said in between kisses.  “I can’t wait until it’s just you and me.  Hmm… I love you.”
He thought he heard Hermione ‘hmm’ at him, but he wasn’t sure.  He walked quickly to their room, and caught Draco just as he was walking back out with his chess pieces.
“You looked like you were far away.”
“So, what did Teddy do?” Molly asked while pouring tea into three cups.
“Oh, Harry, I’m so glad you’re home.  What is with the party?  I figured you would be so exhausted, you wouldn’t want to see anyone for a while.”
Harry turned beet red.  “Wha—what?”
Harry’s eyes met Draco’s.  He hesitated a few seconds more before he said, “Okay, I’ll tell you.  Just, promise me something before you do?”
“Hello, everyone!  I’m so glad you all could come to this spur-of-the-moment party!  I’m so glad to be home, and wanted to see everyone and catch up!  But, that isn’t the only reason why we planned this party.”
He looked up at Draco as he reached for the biscuit, again.  Draco gaped at him for a few moments, mouth opening to say something, but snapped shut as he looked up at the clock on the wall.
“No, you don’t!”  Draco screamed as he crossed the room, causing Harry to jump, tears pooling in his eyes.  “You don’t know me!  You don’t know anything about me!  This could never work!  I’m tainted.  You’re Harry Potter, Saviour, and I’m Draco Malfoy, Death eater.  That’s all you need to know about me!”
“Yes?”
“Sounds good.  Does your nan know you’re staying a while longer?”
Harry sighed as he opened one of the letters on top.  He quickly read it, passing it over to Draco with a smile.  “They’re not all bad.”
“Why must you still call him that?  We’re all friends now,” Hermione huffed at the two men.
Teddy had just turned four when they started dating.  At first, he was terrified of getting to know the little boy, as his mother and aunt had still been on tentative terms at that point.  But, one afternoon with him, and he was head-over-heels in love with the little tyke.
Harry was completely confused.  What in the hell was going on?  He desperately wanted to follow Draco downstairs so that he could get some answers, but he stayed sitting up in his bed, waiting on the blond to get back.
“Drac—”
“Oh, Harry.”  Molly sat, gripping the frame in her hands, eyes wide as she took in the photo.  “Thank you.”  Arthur looked up at Harry with wide, watery eyes and a sad smile.
“Yeah, she did.  One of the things we talked about, though, was a spell that she had heard of, that uses transfiguration spells and charm work to create a likeness to electricity.”
“Hmmm.  Morning.  I’m so glad you’re back.  I get regular sex at night, a delicious meal in the morning, and a gorgeous fiancé to wait on me.”
Draco huffed, but closed his eyes.  Harry grabbed his hand, disapparating.  They popped into another alley.
“Harry!  What are you doing here?”
Harry and Draco go out on a date.
“What time is it?”
Draco stopped dead in his tracks as Harry made his way through the crowd, eyes searching.  When Harry saw him, Draco was shocked to see a large smile grace Harry’s face.  He stood still as Harry made his way towards him.
He had transfigured the table longer, in order to fit everyone, too.  If he was being honest, Harry was really excited and proud to be able to host everyone.
gorgeous husband.”  They smiled at each other, leaning in for another kiss before turning to watch Teddy open his gifts.
“Shut up! I have been able to keep that out of the news for a while now!  I’d like to keep it that way, if possible?”
“No, that’s the other part,” Ron said. “We’re going to open it up and make another door into the dining room!”
“Harry, I’m sorry, but I have to get back to work.  We only have three hours before the foreign ministers get here for the final inspection, and it opens just an hour later.  Can we please finish this later?”
“Not possible!” Draco called out as he, too, came undone, spilling all over Harry’s hand, stomach, and chest.  “I love you so damn much!”
They didn’t have to wait very long before their food arrived, and both rarely spoke to the other as they ate; they were too busy moaning over the multitude of flavours that blossomed on their tongues.  Marcella’s truly was the best.
Before Draco could respond, their waiter walked up to the table.  Draco ordered a bottle of wine, and Harry ordered their dinner:  After their first date, every time they came to Marcella’s, they always got the same thing.  Draco would always get the stuffed calamari, which Harry was always disgusted by, and Harry would always get the chicken parmesan, to which Draco would call him a plebeian.  It was tradition.
Kreacher popped back in with a large bed tray filled with their breakfast.
“So, Millie and I went and checked it out.  Didn’t find anything suspicious, which relieved the shopkeeper, but did find some amazing books.  Saw that one and thought of you, and then found several for Hermione.”
Harry gripped his waist, turning on the spot and apparated them to his bedroom.  He pushed Draco onto the bed, who scrambled up towards the pillows.
best mate, and will inevitably have to be in his company more oft because of it, may or may not have something to do with it, as well.”
Harry gave Draco a blank look.  Draco didn’t say anything, but just kept looking at him expectantly.
“No, of course not.  I don't mind at all!  I'm glad, actually.  I haven't needed to send anything lately, and I hate that he has to be cooped up.  I should be thanking you, really.  Use him whenever you need.”
As they stepped in front of the floo, Draco paused and looked at Harry.
Harry and Draco had called a truce and had started to become friends during that time, as well.  And it was because they were friends that Harry knew something wasn’t entirely right with the relationship between Draco and Nott.
He took a deep breath once outside, enjoying the cold air as it hit his nostrils.  “I can’t believe London has gotten so much snow this early.  It’s so beautiful.”
“Indeed.  So, if you don’t mind…”  He waved his hand in the general direction of their coupling.
Harry smiled as he thought of all the fights that his best friends had had.
Draco smiled.  “That’ll be fine.  Come on, I can’t wait for Hugo to open his gift!”
“Thanks, Malfoy.  I can do this side of things, it’s the actual decorating bit that gets me flustered.  I mean, it took me forever to narrow it down to those three colours, but deciding on just one?  Forget it.  And I knew that rug was perfect, but trying to find everything else to go with it?  That’s why I’ve been putting off going furniture shopping for so long.  It’s too bad I can’t convince you to help me with that part.”
“Yes.  Thank you.”
He made his way back to his office, being stopped several more times.  Beverly looked up as he walked past her, and he gave her a questioning look.
Draco was suddenly filled with dread.
Draco looked down at the ball, and then tossed it to Harry.  He threw it back.  Draco was silent for several minutes, but then the dam broke, and he started talking about anything and everything that had happened to him since the war.  They stood there in the common room for hours, Draco talking, Harry throwing in a comment here and there, but mostly just listening.
“A letter from the Owl Post came in, saying there were too many letters to deliver, so Kreacher went and got them for Masters.”
They encountered few people as they made their way towards the large oak front doors.  Stepping outside, they each pulled their winter cloaks, scarves, and gloves tighter around themselves.  The wind had picked up, and snow flurries were beginning to fall.
“Open it!  Open it!”
“Who?  Neville?”
Harry didn’t have much patience though, as he was still half-hard from Draco’s earlier teasing, so he decided to save himself a couple of steps and strip out of his clothes as he went.  As he got to 50, he was already on the landing, taking his shirt off, and headed up the stairs.  He counted 100 as he made it to the next landing, and had removed his jeans.
Hermione grabbed from his hands, tossing it towards the head of the bed as she asked, “What?”
“What the hell happened?”
“Why would I know his daily plans?”  He hoped his voice didn’t express his anger, but from the looks on both his friends’ faces, he knew that it did.
One weekend, after close to 1.5 years of getting to know them, Harry had asked Draco round for dinner.  Draco had thought that everyone was going to be there, so readily agreed, but was completely thrown off when he walked in, expecting to see his friends, and only found Harry, in a button-up shirt and slacks, standing in front of a candle lit dinner.
Ron followed him over to the till, speaking to the man as if they were old friends.  Once he had paid, Ron shook the man’s hand and walked back over to Harry, smile still large on his face.
“Th—thank you.”  Draco’s mind was a mess of emotions as he looked at Harry.  What was going on?
“Let’s go down to the kitchen, then,” Harry said, turning around and walking out of the room.  He stopped on the landing, making sure Malfoy was following him.  Seeing that he was behind him, Harry continued down the stairs into the front hallway.  “Mind the last step,” he said quietly, avoiding hitting the umbrella stand that was sitting just beside the stairs.  Why Harry hadn’t destroyed that thing yet, he didn’t know.
“I know there's a saying that whoever you spend New Year’s with, are the people who will be in your life throughout the year.  If that's the case,” he said gripping Draco’s hand harder, “then I’m glad I'll be with all of you, and I can't wait to see what kind of mischief we’ll be able to get into in the next 12 months!”
Draco nearly melted when Harry touched him.  He didn’t want to think about how touch-starved he was, but he knew that no one would ever make him feel as
McGonagall stopped and turned to face Harry.  “Yes, Monday is agreeable to me.  I will meet you there, say, 9:00?”
“Such a happy baby,” Harry said, leaning out to kiss the top of Teddy’s head.  He looked up at Draco, and with a quick side-eye look at Narcissa, shrugged and leaned up to kiss Draco on the cheek.
The group followed the headmistress up to the third floor.  As she turned right, Harry instantly knew where they were going: Fluffy’s corridor.  The door in which the trio had walked through to come face-to-face with the three headed dog was the door in which McGonagall stopped.  She said the password (Albus) and walked inside.  The group followed, stepping into a wide common room.
“Harry—”
The trio made their way down the stairs, entering the kitchen.  Looking around, it looked a complete mess.  There was no cabinets and holes where the appliances should be.
“Was that you?”  Dean caught up to them, laughing along.
Harry nodded as he sent another package towards George.  George caught it swiftly, glancing up at Harry’s sad smile.  Harry could see that George took a deep breath before he quickly unwrapped it.  George let out a sound that sounded half laugh, half sob.  Angelina was smiling as she took in the photo in George’s hands.
“It’s probably for the best, though, babe.”
knew I would need this when you put it in.  You knew I’d tease you, and you knew that I would do it in my own time.  Didn’t you?”
“Go away, Ginny!”
“Too right, my love.”  They put their rings back on, looking down at their hands, both smiling.
“Well then, I definitely want it!”
Harry smiled as he once again took in the large family that he had acquired.  He felt beyond blessed as he watched as Molly took it upon herself to feed Teddy in between her own bites.  He caught her eye, and she just winked at him with a smile as she turned to give Teddy another spoonful.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sandwiches are fine with me,” Narcissa said, getting a nod from everyone else.
“Just wanted to let me know that she had found the florist and had discussed arrangements, booking them for October.”
Draco looked back into the box, pulling out a green shoe, with silver buckle and emeralds around the edges.
Harry looked over at Ron, cheekily saying, “Sorry mate.  You know you love me for it.”
“Let’s just say, I really wish that we didn't have to go to this thing, so that I could rip that suit off of your body.”
“Can I call for Nipsy?”
“Hey, babe!  I’m making your fav—”  Harry had turned around with a spatula in one hand, but when he saw Draco’s face, he tossed it onto the counter and was instantly beside Draco.  “Love?  What’s wrong?”
did this,” Draco whispered with a scratchy voice.  “You are Harry.  I need Harry.  Please.  Don’t.”
It had taken him a long time to get used to the sound of dozens of people in one place, but now he relished in it.  He had had such a lonely, quiet childhood; it was thrilling to be a part of such a large family, now.
“Where is Draco?  I thought he’d be here,” Hermione asked as they ascended the stairs to the top floor.
Harry turned away and walked up the stairs, pausing at the top of the landing to look back down at the two men. He couldn’t help the smile that lit up his face as he watched Draco flick his wand, casting a silencing charm, turn back towards Ron and picked up the painting again. He shook his head as he walked into the lounge.
Draco made a stack of the letters, setting them on the table.  He picked up a few grapes, popping one into his mouth, and held the other up for Harry.
.  There was a difference, and he knew it.
your fault,” Hermione said as she tugged at his arm.
Harry smiled as he said, “Well, to begin with, we have dinner reservations at Marcella’s.”
Telling his friends that he'd catch them up in a moment, he made his way toward the stacks in the back. Finding the aisle he was looking for, Harry started looking through the books about magical home renovations.  After finding five books that looked like they could be of some help, Harry began walking towards the front of the store, passing by the Transfiguration aisle.  He stopped and walked back into it, looking for a book about furniture transfiguring.
“Merlin, I can’t wait to find out what Father Christmas puts in that for me.”  He gave Draco a heated look.
Harry quickly raised his head to look at Draco.  “What?!”
“Oh. But, what are you doing here, Ron?”
Kreacher was already at the stove, when he walked in.  As Harry sat down at the table, Kreacher turned around and slid a plate of bacon, eggs, and toast in front of Harry.
“What is going on, Potter?  What is—  Oh, my God!  What happened?”
“Will yo—”
“Mhmm.  That doesn’t go down here; that will be hung in the bedroom.”  He wiggled his eyebrows.
Teddy sighed and pouted as he made his way back towards his chair at the table.  Harry winked at Draco as he waved his wand and a small box zoomed into his hand.
“Ron, mate, you’re always hungry,” Harry said, slapping Ron on the back.  “What do we want?”
Harry went to go pick it up, sitting down on the coffee table next to Draco, so they were sitting in front of Teddy.
Draco stood dumbfounded for a split second before he yelled, “Yes!”
Harry stood up, walking over to the desk in the corner.  Draco saw him pull out a sheet of parchment, dipping his quill in the ink and writing a short note to whom he assumed was Mr Ollivander.  Once he finished, he called for Kreacher.  The elf popped into the room, bowing to Harry.
Thank you for reading!  And I'm sorry!
“I told her the more, the merrier.  I never had any issue with Nott, as he basically kept to himself.  Goyle is a different story, but I don’t think it will be a problem.”
Draco snorted and said, “Seriously, Potter?  Are you a wizard, or what? It’s called a warming charm.”
He cleaned up their mess, moving around Kreacher, who was bustling about the kitchen, mumbling under his breath.
“I got off early.  What the here is going on?”
large photos that were on the front page of the paper, and said, “Well, fork.”  One was of him and Harry, swinging Teddy between their clasped hands, opposite hands full of bags and packages standing in line for skates.  Another was of them sitting at a table, talking with Ron and Hermione.  The third was the photo the man had taken while they stood on the edge of the rink.  Harry had Draco’s hand in his, pulling it up to kiss, loving smile on his face.
“On second thought, maybe we should just go on home.  I’d like to live to see the new year.”
“I don’t, actually,” Harry said with another sigh.  “I’ve had a long, exhausting day, and all I want to do is sit in front of the telly and relax.  Why don’t you join me?  It won’t be the end of the world if we don’t show up to one party.”  He patted the couch seat beside him.  “Come on, we can get take-out, watch a movie, and just enjoy a quiet evening in.”
“Harry, how in Merlin’s name are we supposed to get on this thing?”
“Sorry, love.  We’re only 24; we have many more years of working before we can retire and live out our days on the seaside.”
Before long, they had made their way to the door that led out to the owlery.  Professor McGongall turned to Harry and said, “I'm glad the renovations are going well.  I'll let you get on with your letter sending.”  She slightly bowed her head at him and turned to walk the other way.
“What about ordering in, and watching the telly?”
“Like what you see, Potter?”
Before Harry could respond, Draco said, “Because she is not as lovely as you once remember her.”
They had stayed up late the night before, talking and crying and listening to each other.  They hadn’t even eaten the dinner that Harry had made, instead asking Kreacher to put it away for later, and collapsing into bed in emotional exhaustion, well past midnight.
“When I saw you that day in Diagon, I knew I needed to give you back your wand back.  And I’m so glad I did, because if I hadn’t, we wouldn’t have gotten to this point.  I’m glad we became friends.  I’ve really gotten to know the real Draco, and not that pompous arsehole I thought I’d knew since I was eleven.
“You have to believe me!  I love you!  I know I’ve been a shirt husband recently, but you have to let me explain.  Please!
“That sounds like a lot of fun!  You’ll have to show me your snowmen later, huh?”
After thanking the man, Harry and Draco left and walked around the building.  “How exactly are we going to ‘pick it up’ when we don’t have anything to put them in?” Harry asked, concernedly.
“Of course you would wrap it in Gryffindor colors, Potter.  Why did I expect anything less?”  Despite his rude comments, Malfoy’s eyes deceived him; he seemed very pleased to be reunited with his wand.
When he had clothes on, Draco looked far too skinny, with his bones jutting out; nothing but pointy edges.  Without clothes, though, he was a sight of perfection.  The hair on his chest was so pale that it was hardly there; one had to really look for it in order to see it.  Harry could definitely tell that Quidditch had done the man good, too.  His stomach muscles were well defined, as were his pecks.  Harry’s breath stuttered as he took a hard look at the body before him.  He moaned quietly as Draco took his hands and brought them up his chest.
“Harry took me there awhile back.”
Draco huffed a laugh.  “No.”
he thought.
“Because of what Harry said.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he gasped slightly.  “The link,” he whispered to himself, looking down at the floor.
“I had no idea,” Draco whispered, looking at the ground.  “My mother and her haven’t spoken since long before I was born.  I’ve never met her, but I have heard a few stories of her.  I knew I had a cousin, but was never allowed to speak about her when I was younger, and she had already graduated from Hogwarts before we started.”
“Put Bill on, would you?”
Thanks for reading!
,” he said with a smirk that would rival any Malfoy smirk.
“We should be able to all fit; come along.”
Harry was just about to turn and apparate away, when a thought hit him square in his chest.   He said goodbye to his bewildered friends, and sprinted back up the street.
“What are you all talking about,” Harry asked, sitting down and leaning back into the front of the couch.
“Ready?” Hermione asked Ron and Harry.  Receiving nods of confirmation, she said, “One, two, three.” The trio raised their wands together, and the pieces of marble came back and fit into place.  Ron and Harry put their wands down, but Hermione cast another spell.  A bright white light emitted from her wand and fell across the stone.
Draco, shocked but pleased, couldn't help the smile that adorned his face.  “Thanks, Potter.”
Harry woke with a start.
“Hmmm, yes!  I’ll see you later.  Love you!” Draco smiled as he stepped into the fireplace in the kitchen and was gone in a flash of green flames.
McGonagall walked into the hall, followed by Flitwick, Slughorn, Sprout, and several other professors.  They all sat down at the staff table and started talking amongst themselves.  McGonagall stepped over to the students’ table and cleared her throat.
He walked into his en suite, deciding to take a shower.  He quickly cleaned himself, completely waking up underneath the spray of the water.  Stepping out of the tub, he wrapped himself in his favourite fluffy towel.
“If I told you, it would give away the surprise.  McGonagall is in on it, so you know it's nothing bad, ‘Mione.  I've got to go, or I'll be late!” He gave her a side hug, and then quickly walked out of the hall, through the entry, and out into the beautiful September weather.
Harry smiled wide as he looked at Draco.  “Okay then, so what do you want to do?  Because the point of eloping is that it’s just us.”  Toss.
“We’ll be there, mate,” Ron said with a smile.
“It’s 5:35. My ring is in my pocket, ready for me to slip it on when we are ready.  And, I’m sure some people with start arriving in the next few minutes.”
His imagination began to run wild with thoughts of the things he wanted to do with and to Draco.
“Hey.  That was fast,” he said out-loud.
“You are forgiven.  Let’s just keep the flying to a minimum until you go to Hogwart’s, okay?”
“What— How— You— Blimey!  You all are incredible!  I would never have expected this!”
“Great! Once I find out the details, I will let you know.”
Fair warning: this chapter contains slight sexy times. :D   No likey?  Then why are you reading a story that is rated Explicit??  ;D
“What now?” he asked, slowly.
Draco hummed, watching Harry finish up the eggs.  He let his eyes wander the expanse of Harry’s back as he stretched to open cabinets and retrieve the plates.
Harry leant in to Draco’s ear, though, and whispered, “Besides, I’d much rather continue this in a nice comfortable bed, such as mine at Grimmauld.  Just think, in 12 days, we will have more than a fortnight to do whatever we please…”
It was Saturday evening, and everyone was ready for exams to be over and the holidays to begin.  They had been studying every day the entire week.
“What have you heard, Kingsley?”  McGonagall had leaned forward in her chair.
“Won’t you stay here while I’m gone?”
Harry gave a pout, and cried, “But whyyyy?”
The pair took the bags up to the top floor bedroom: when Harry had moved back into Grimmauld, he decided that he was going to make Sirius’s old room into his.  It was truly the largest bedroom in the house, and he had many ideas of how he could make it even better once he started remodeling.
“Did you talk to mum about going tomorrow,” Harry asked, as they changed their clothes.
“Okay, then, I’ll be beside you the whole way.”
Receiving inquiring looks from those around him, Harry turned and quickly went back up to the dorm.  Coming back down the stairs holding three wands, the others quickly understood what he meant.
The lights came back on.  “Wicked!  It’s just like my deluminator!”
“Not if I can help it.”
THAT BEING SAID, I'm really excited to be doing this fest again this year!  I kept telling myself that I was going to write the story in its entirety, and then I'd only have to post it!  Yeah, well, that definitely didn't happen... So, I may be late, and I may have to double up on pics, but IT WILL GET DONE, I PROMISE!
“That would be great.  I will send an owl to Mr Ollivander, letting him know.  Thank you.”
“Happy New Years!”  Harry grinned at his friends.
He braced himself for the ridicule he was afraid was about to come, but it never did.  Draco grinned even wider than he had earlier that evening, and before Harry could even think about what was happening, Draco had pushed their bodies together and they were kissing.
“Brilliant.  What are you—”
They spent the next hour discussing what everyone was going to bring and do.  When Harry went to bed that night, not only was he excited for Christmas, but now he was excited for all of his friends to be together to ring in the new year.
They stepped into the bedroom, and Harry walked over to the closet.  He shucked his cloak off, followed by his trousers and button up shirt and tie.
“Do you mean that?”
, he thought.
He then picked up a handful of powder and prepared to toss it onto the hearth.
“Today’s the day, eh?”  Harry looked up to see Ron standing at the end of his bed, looking past Harry to Draco.
Harry dropped the quaffle onto the sofa, and walked over to wrap his arms around Draco.  “I don’t either, but it’s going to have to happen.  But, we’re going to have to deal with it
Harry smiled at Ron, saying, “Business seems to be booming!”
Harry smiled as he tried to remember some of the more ridiculous ones.  “I remember there was one called Sex On The Beach.  It sounded pretty good, too.”
“You really do think loudly, you know that?  What was just going through your head?”
“I saw Draco in Diagon Alley a few days before we went back to Hogwarts, and we made plans to meet so that I could give him his wand back.  We did the ritual, just as Ollivander said to, but apparently our magic is just too powerful, because we both felt as if our entire arms were being burnt off.”
He lifted his head and issued a quiet, “Yes, ma’am.  I’m sorry, Nana.”
“Yeah, Draco, don’t worry about it.  You’ve just to tell the Wizengamot what happened, and then you’ll be done,” Neville said.
They made their way down towards the lobby and stepped back out into the cold air.  They held hands as they turned and walked down the snowy road.  Fairy lights lit up the trees in the park and were placed on the eaves of the buildings, but when they turned a corner onto the main street, they both stopped and gasped.
After supper, they decided to head back to their room.  As they walked back through town, Draco couldn’t wait to really get to explore.  During their honeymoon, they didn’t really leave the room but just a couple of times; they would finally get to visit the area, and see what was on offer.
He gripped Harry’s shoulders, letting him know to stay put, and then said, as he walked backwards towards to doorway, “Count to 150.  Then come upstairs.”
“The Elder wand,” Malfoy cut in.  “I understand.”
Draco gave him a questioning look, pulling his hand out of Harry’s, taking the ring off and looking at the etching on the inside: “I love you more.”  He started laughing, causing Harry to return the questioning look.  “Look at yours,” he said, wiping his eyes.
He was right.  He was woken up by two knobby knees in the stomach, as Teddy tried to crawl over him to get in the middle of the bed.
He walked down to check on Molly.  “Do you need any help with anything?”
“Great!”
“At the same time, a wedding is supposed to be a celebration with your families and friends.”  Toss.
While they were wandering, they came across this tiny little café that had the greatest pastries Draco had ever eaten—and he’d had some wonderful pasties in his lifetime.  They had bought several to take home and had eaten them all before supper.  It had become a tradition for them to stop by.
Harry stepped back through his floo at a quarter after one.  The paperwork hadn’t been too bad, considering, and he just decided to head back to Grimmauld once he finished.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well…”
“I know you didn’t do it, but at the time, I thought you had.  I’ll be honest—I was hoping that something terrible would happen to you.  Then you came back out of the maze with Diggory’s body, and I knew something terrible had indeed happened.  I didn’t know what to make of it, though.  Then, I received a letter from my mother the next day telling me that the Dark Lord was back.”
“But, what?”
“Bye.”
“But, how do you know?  He hasn’t touched me, let alone really looked at me in months.  It makes perfect sense.  He’s gone before I get out of the shower in the mornings and goes on his ‘walks’ right after supper.  I just— Where are you going?”
“No, Father Christmas,” Draco said with a huff.  “Yes, it’s me.  Go back to sleep.”
Draco shook his head, gripping Harry’s biceps.
“That would be lovely, Kreacher.  Let’s put these up,” Draco said, gesturing to the box, “and then we will let you finish.”
Harry leant in, but before he could reach Draco’s lips, the blond moved so that he was straddling Harry.  He bent over, taking Harry’s face into his hands.  He moved the curly hair off of Harry’s face, putting it behind his ears.  As he leant in, he whispered, “Thank you,” before placing a tender kiss on Harry’s nose.
“Guilty, Minister,” both men said at the same time.
She waved him off.  “Oh, pish.  Congratulations, by the way.  I’m very happy for you both.”
Death Eater.  Do you, Ron?”
Harry could not believe how fast this morning had flipped.  Just a few hours ago, Harry had stood staring at a sleeping Draco, pure joy coursing through his body.  Not even fifteen minutes, he’d had Draco’s cock in his mouth, and now…  Well, he didn’t want to think about it.
“Well, give it a go.  Is it working alright?”
Taken aback, Harry glanced at Draco, who gave him a small smile.  “Well, thank you.  I’d like that.  But, please, call me Harry.”
That same evening, after they had returned Teddy to Andromeda, Harry and Draco stood in the middle of their sitting room, tossing a quaffle.
“Perfect.  We’ll see you on Wednesday, then.  Well, goodnight.”  Hermione leaned over and pecked a kiss on Harry’s cheek, then walked over to where Draco was standing, and gave him a quick hug.  Ron shook hands with both men, and then tossing in floo powder, they were swept away in a flash of green flames.
“I agree,” said Harry.  “I like it.”  He turned back to Teddy.  “Where’s your nan?”
Harry’s head was throbbing, his extremities felt like lead, and his mouth felt as if it was full of cotton.  He blearily opened one eye, and found that he was indeed in his own bed, but how he got there, he had no idea.
He sat up and pulled the top off the top.  Shifting aside the tissue paper, he gasped and then cackled.  He pulled out a red man’s thong with the saying, “When I think of you, I touch my elf.”
“Every time I go out, yes.  I’m getting used to it.  No big deal.”
Chuckling, Harry turned around and gestured for Draco to follow him.  “Remind me to always be in her good graces, would you?”
He looked between them, hoping they had some answers for what was going on with Harry.
All eyes from their table were swinging back and forth between the two men standing and Harry, who had slid his wand out of his holster and was gripping it in his hand under the table, just waiting for something to happen.
Bowing, he said, “Master Harry, Master Draco.  Would sirs like tea?”
“Sirius put those up when he was a teenager to hack off his parents.  We’ve tried everything, but he used one hell of a strong permanent sticking charm.  I’m just going to have to take the whole wall out, I think.”
“I may not be a parent myself, but I know that a parent only wants what is best for their child, and deserves to be a part of the most precious moments of their children’s lives.”
Harry picked up the wand, and with one last look into his room, set off down the stairs.
Draco could feel his cheeks getting warmer, as he had the perfect view of both his mother and his aunt as they gave him looks.  He rolled his eyes, though, straightening the harness a bit, and said, “Well, let’s go.”
Harry could feel his eyes start to prick behind his lids.  He blearily opened his eyes, turning back to look at the blond, mouthing an
we could elope.”
“Professor, wait.”  Harry had stood, walking towards her.  “Would you be willing to accompany me to Ollivander’s on Monday?  You know more about what the ministry said.”
Harry had sped out of the Common Room in order to get away from everyone staring at him.  He had to come up with some way for his friends to understand what he was trying to do.  His ‘new beginning’ wasn’t going as he had planned.  As he walked into the Great Hall, he noticed that he was not the first one to enter.  Draco was sitting at the end of the table, with his head in his hands.  Harry walked up to the table.
Harry chuckled.  “It’s an unending cycle, isn’t it?”
“What’s got you so happy?”
Flourish & Blotts was their next stop. The store owners were very good about keeping the Hogwarts texts right at the front, so it was very easy for the group to collect the needed books.  An idea occurred to Harry, though.
“Ron was telling me about what you told him earlier.”
Draco paused, turning back to Harry.  “Thursday?”
“Why is your mother writing to me?”
“It’s okay. He’s forgiven you. We all have. It’s in the past, all of it; time to live in the present, yeah?”
with his thumb.
“I love you, too.  You have just made me the happiest man.”  He couldn’t resist leaning back in for another languid kiss.  When they finally pulled apart, Draco automatically looked down at his hand.
Hermione and, surprising all but the former Slytherin's, Pansy had already laid out their reviewing schedules for the next two weeks.  Group study sessions for all classes were being planned, and everyone was staying at Hogwarts the next weekend to study.
Day 2 Prompt:
“—I thought you said your mother was making plans for October!”
Hermione and Pansy had stepped away, and were whispering to each other, nodding and gesturing.  Hermione turned and told Harry to turn around and face the stairwell.
The letter was from Draco, he discovered, saying that he would be round at 10, but had to go do some things for his mother later that afternoon.
They had kissed on New Year’s, as all of their other friends were paired off and it just seemed the logical thing to do.  It had started out as just a chaste peck on the lips.  They both pulled back almost instantly, and just stared at each other.  It took several moments, but then Harry had gathered his Gryffindor courage, and slid his hand into the hair on the back of Draco’s neck.  Gently, he pulled Draco towards him, and again their lips met.
“We’ll always be here for you, mate, even when we all have grey hair and get hard of hearing and have to walk around with an ear horn like my great uncle Boris.”
“You know, this is actually really fun.  It’s like flying, but staying on the ground.”
Harry smiled up at him, kissing Draco’s hip.  “I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
Harry could not wait to have his weekends free.  He was hoping to be able to get a few rooms done in Grimmauld before Christmas; he was determined to have Christmas at his home this year, in order to give Molly a break.
Thanks for reading!
“I know you are excited to see your godfather, but this is no way to act, young man.  You could have been hurt if Harry hadn’t have caught you.” She descended the stairs until she stood over Teddy.
A lot on his mind was an understatement.  Harry had been so upset over what Draco had done, that after leaving McGonagall to take the wand—and the information they had learned—back to the Manor, Harry had gone home and ripped apart the room across from the sitting room.
Pulling out his drawing pad, he looked again at his plans for the layout of the appliances.  He was excited that he had found a spell that he could use that would enable muggle appliances to work in the house.  When he had spoken with Professor McGonagall at the beginning of the term, she had told him about the possibility of using a combination of transfiguration spells and charms to create a likeness to electricity.  After some research, he was able to figure out the technicalities of it.  He had used it in all of the rooms that he had finished, and it was working brilliantly.
It didn’t take long after that for Harry to learn what was really going on, and it was just a short time after that, that Harry and their friends convinced Draco to leave Nott; that he didn’t deserve to be treated that way.  Draco moved in with Blaise, and they thought they all were through with Nott.  Until tonight.
“You—you haven’t looked at nor touched me in months.  You haven’t really spoken to me in months.  You leave for hours at a time, and then come back even more quiet than before.  You don’t want to go with me to events.  Are you cheating on me?”  His throat felt tight as he looked up at the emerald eyes he had loved since they were in school.
Gathering the needed ingredients, they all made their way down to the stationary store.  They each got parchment, and after looking around a bit, Harry decided on a couple of new quills that were a deep ebony color, with a hint of emerald when the light hit it just so.
“Uh, yeah, we’ve talked about it, of course, it’s just…” Harry said, looking at Draco out of the corner of his eye.  Draco could only nod as he looked back at Harry.
“And what is this project, may I ask?”
Year living quarters.  Because you all are a special circumstance, it was decided to take a part of the castle and form your own quarters, instead of trying to make extra space in the houses.”
When they finished, Harry decided now was as good as any, and started down to the Great Hall; McGonagall went ahead and readied the press.  As Harry walked in, he was assaulted by flashbulbs and his name being called from a dozen different directions.  A
It was still a decent time, so they decided to take a walk around London.  They walked along the Thames, walking past the London Bridge.  It was absolutely breathtaking, lit up at night, with Christmas decorations on either side of the river.
Draco gently reached his hand out, moving a piece of hair from Harry’s eye.  He lightly cupped Harry’s cheek, rubbing it with his thumb.  Harry’s eyes flickered, but then went still.
Before he could speak, his mother had grabbed her sister’s hand, moving over to the couch.  As the two women sat down, Harry walked over to Draco’s side.
When Teddy got tired of skating, frustrated that he couldn’t do the spins like Draco, they went and got some food.  Teddy decided he wanted a kabob, so Harry went to order while Draco and Teddy went to find seats.
“So, what are we shopping for?”
move his head rather quickly.
“You’re not so bad—oh!—bad yourself.”
“Oh, Harry!  I’m so sorry we’ve taken over your sitting room!”  Andromeda jumped up as the two men walked into the room.
Harry gave him a wide smile before leaning over and giving him a kiss.  “Come on, let’s go figure out what else we need for the kitchen.”
Draco, who worked in the Department of International Magical Cooperation, had been working tirelessly to put together an initiative for a Fair, with multiple shops, food, and an ice-skating rink, for a start, for the European Wizarding public.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked.
“Remind me why, again?”
Harry flicked his wrist, sending a jinx towards the man.  What he wasn’t expecting was the see Nott go flying into the wall.  His confusion ebbed as he saw Blaise jump up at the same time he did, Harry out of his seat and next to Draco, Blaise with his wand drawn and pointed at Nott before he had even hit the ground.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Harry said, beginning to rub small circles along Draco’s back.  “I could get used to this.”
“Eh, I’ll take it!” Harry grinned.  “Kreacher, I’m glad you’re here.  We are having a party this evening, and will need your help.”
“We were, but then I decided to move this evening along to the next step.”
“What are we going to say?”
“We need to come here more often.  That was delicious.”  Draco wiped his mouth again, laying his napkin on top of his empty plate.
“I honestly tried to get rid of him, but he… he refused to let me pass by him,” he whispered.  “I was hoping that tonight, we could… but I guess…” He sighed.
“London.”
Harry gave them a wave, and left.  Walking into the library, he was pleased to see it was nearly empty.  All of the younger students were in class, and it seemed those that had a free period were not inclined to do work.
He didn’t have to wait but just a few seconds before he received a response.
“I love you more.”
Draco looked around the room, not looking at Harry.  He spoke to the wall, saying.  “I can’t do this.”
Harry continued to thrust quickly in and out, as Draco’s legs squeezed his waist.
Harry sat straight up in bed, heart pounding and breath coming out in quick pants.  “Fuck!” he exclaimed, willing his body to calm down.  If he was being honest, it'd been a while since he had had a nightmare as bad as that.
“Listen, I may never get to talk to you alone, again, so I just wanted to say—
“Babe, we can’t!”  Harry had sat up, reaching for Draco’s arm.
monster
“I’d nearly forgotten about that.  Yeah, that’ll be fine.”
“Nex—aaagghhh!  Next time.  Can’t.  Stop.”  Harry panted each word as he rubbed himself against the other man.
“Yeah, it is.  Oh, wow, look at that!”  Draco pointed to the front of a store front, that had a miniature version of the same angel hanging inside the glass.
They lay there for several long moments, just looking at each other, Harry lightly scratching Draco’s back.
“Isn’t this unbelievably comfortable?  It reminds me of the couch in front of the fire.”
“We’ve had some decent conversations the past couple of months, and I finally have a chess opponent that can beat me!  He has a wicked sense of humour, too.  As does Blaise.  You know, the Slytherin’s aren’t half bad.”
“Yeah. Actually Draco and I were thinking of having a party this weekend. Celebrate my homecoming and what not.  Don’t know full details yet, but be expecting an owl.”
Draco quickly turned his head towards her, willing his cheeks not to flush even more.
Teddy pulled back, and Draco helped him wipe his cheeks of the tears.  “I just really missed him,” he sniffed.
Draco moved so that he was kneeling on the bed.  He couldn’t resist leaning over and softly kissing Harry’s temple.  He then moved and placed a soft kiss on his cheek.  He placed another on the corner of his mouth.  This caused Harry to move again, and Draco watched as two emerald orbs slowly blinked open.
They ate their breakfast is easy silence, reading that morning’s edition of the
He carefully placed them on the tree, and then went back to the box and picked up the bulbs with a big dog, and the two that were wolves; one for Remus, the other for Tonks.
“I love you.  Text me when you’ve gotten there, so I know you haven’t been mauled on your way in.”
“Short, sweet, and to the point.  Anything else?”
“Yeah.”
worth it.”
“Well…” Hermione looked at Ron, who shrugged and then nodded his head, gesturing towards the hallway.
“Hey, you’re marrying him.”
Draco turned back to look at his mother, who gave him a watery smile.  He returned it, turning back to Harry, who had been looking at Molly, who was wiping her eyes.
“Yes.”
Harry could not remember the last time he had smiled that big.  As he looked around at his friends, he realized how truly blessed he was to have such amazing people in his life.
Draco ripped the paper off of the frame, and turned the photo over. His eyes got as big as saucers when he took in the photo of Greg, Vince, and himself walking through one of the courtyards, in what appeared to be third year. He apparently said something snarky, according to the look on his face, and delighted in himself when Vince and Greg guffawed.
“No, I finished another room this week.  I’ve had a lot on my mind the past couple of days, so working on it gave me something to focus on.  I couldn’t sleep, so I finished it really quickly.”
Draco sat next to Harry on the floor as everyone started piling food on their plates. He took another look around the table at these people, and smiled.
As Harry pulled back up to answer him, Draco pulled him back down for another lingering kiss.
“Oh, I didn't think you meant me, as well,” Draco said, shocked look on his face.
“Watch it, Scarhead,” Draco said with a sarcastic smirk, and not an ounce of vitriol. He grinned at Harry, which made Harry’s heart skip a beat.  “Seriously, though, lean away. I don't mind,” he added with a wink.
“Oh, yes, because I can wear fancy dresses while studying down in the bowels of the ministry.  But, thank you, both of you.”
“Are you sure?  We’re not public, yet, and I don’t want to push you or anything.”
“Well, I am.  And, won’t be going on any more missions for the foreseeable future, thankfully.”
“Ronald, we've been over this…”
While he and Hermione had been talking, Draco and Ron had snuck out.  They didn’t even know they had gone until they walked back into the room.
They stood staring at them for several moments before Ron said, “Blimey, mate.  Really?”
“Think you can go back to sleep, or do you want to go down to the common room and talk?”
Ginny informed Hermione what the new addition to Harry’s party was as Harry continued to toss holey shirts out of the closet.  Hermione seemed to be just as excited about the prospect, and after drinking her tea, she started stuffing the clothes into a magically expanded rubbish bin.  As soon as they had put the new clothes onto the now emptied hangers, and carefully put into the closet, the girls headed off to their respective homes to change for dinner.
“Well, that’s too bad, mate, because you know ‘Mione won’t stop nagging you until you answer her.”  Ron received another light slap on the arm and a scowl from his girlfriend, but Harry swallowed the snort he was about to emit when she turned her attention back to him.
“Draco, I—”
“Trust me, I have no idea.  I didn’t know what to think when he first apologized to me.  When I followed him into the dorm, and I saw his face, I knew that he meant it.  Just the fact that I was the first one that he said sorry to, made me realise that I should give him a chance.
Draco lay there, quietly pondering for a moment, before deciding: “Let’s go into town.”
“Think he’ll be alright?” Harry turned to see Neville looking at him.
“Hmmmm.  I can’t wait.”
He wasn’t prepared for the group hug that assaulted him.  Both Ron and Hermione had reached for him at the same time, enveloping him in their arms.  Harry looked behind Ron, seeing Draco looking at him.  Draco rolled his eyes, shook his head slightly, and then mouthed what looked to be the word ‘Gryffindors.’
“It was incredible,” Draco said as they made their way to the sitting room where a dinner buffet was spread along a table.  “Just like how I remembered it from our honeymoon, but also so completely different, as well.”
They walked up the stairs to the front door.  Draco stopped, turned, and gave Harry a chaste kiss.  “I can't get over that I am allowed to do that,” he said with a smile.
“What’s wrong?”
Draco nodded, looking down at Nott, who was trying to sit up.  Blaise still had his wand pointed at him, but was squat beside him, talking quietly.  He stood back up, taking a step back as Nott picked himself up, glared at the three men, and then stalked out.
“Oh, Harry!  Happy Christmas, dear!”  She walked over and gave him a hug.
Draco nodded, and Harry turned him to face the floo.  He ran back to the table to retrieve their cloaks, saying a quick goodbye to everyone, and then ran back to where Draco still stood.  He looked over at Blaise, who was still standing a couple of steps behind them, mouthing ‘Thank you’.
“He should be set.  He knows the way and will take you around the trail.  If you wish to stop and get off at any point, just say ‘sluta’ for stop and ‘gå’ for go.  He’ll do the rest.”
Harry lifted Draco’s hand to his mouth and kissed it.  “I know, me too.  I had to go to Mungo’s for my quarterly checkup back in August and saw a flier while waiting on the healer.  I pocketed it and kept it in my desk drawer for about three weeks before I read it.”
“Harry! I can't find anything to wear!”
Apparently his awe shone on his face, because when Harry looked back at him, he received a questioning look.
“Of course, of course.  Understood,” he said with a nod and a smile.
“Lounge?  You mean the sitting room?”
McGonagall turned and saw that Madam Pomfrey was standing in the doorway.
“Why are you awake?” Draco mumbled.
“Then, I was awoken in the middle of the night, when he crawled into my bed.”
“Merry Christmas, everyone!” He smiled at the group sitting around on the couches as he walked over to the tree, carefully placing the gifts down on the ground.
Harry laughed again, and Draco thought once again that he’d love to be able to hear that sound for the rest of his days.
“I love you,” Harry said suddenly.
“Yes!  I’m due some time off, and I’ve only been down to the Market a handful of times, and that included our date the other night.  I’ll have to double check with Cloudfoot and Drumpkin, but I don’t see why I couldn’t!  When were you thinking?  Where are we going?  What’s the weather like?  Is it tropical?  I have so much to do!”
Draco could tell his voice was beginning to wobble.  “Oh, Ted.  Come here.”  He put his arms out and watched as Teddy scrambled around the bench to slide in beside him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s middle.  He heard a quiet sob, and just held him, sliding his fingers through his hair.
Draco nodded and he stepped past Harry.
"Potter, I swear..." He faded off with a moan.
“And, so, I picked up a few things.  This summer, since I was alone for a while, I had time to try some new recipes.  I’m decent.”
“Everything okay, dear?” Molly asked as she sat a bowl of potatoes on the table.
“Finished it Tuesday night.  I decided the sitting room can be the formal room for guests, and this one can be for when I just need to relax.  I see you all have figured out the telly?”  He looked over at George, who had the remote, randomly pushing buttons.
Harry stood and watched him for a bit, then closed the window and returned to the couch.
Draco groaned as he turned over.  “What time is it,” he groggily asked.
“Brilliant!”
“You may use the floo in my office, if you wish,” Minerva said, stepping up to them.  “May be a bit easier with…” she nodded at Teddy, who had fallen asleep in Harry’s arms.
“I know.  Being back is delving up memories for me, as well.  We’ve just got to push forward.”
“I did have to go to Norfolk!  Just, for my mother, and not work,” Draco defended, sheepishly.
“You mean he hasn’t done that before?”
Their memories were still coming back, but they had bought a new home and were learning new things about their lives before the war on a now daily basis.  Harry was so glad that Hermione had introduced Ron to them, and they were getting to know their (probable) future son-in-law.
The dreams from the Room of Requirement was always the worst.  He could deal with the dreams of walking into the forest, seeing all the bodies lying around the Great Hall, and even the final battle, but the Room of Requirement and the fiendfyre was always the worst.  He could feel the flames licking his skin, smell the smoke as it infiltrated his lungs.  He could even sometimes feel the weight of Malfoy against his back as they made their way out.  The thought of strong arms wrapped around his waist sent blood flowing straight to his groin.
That statement made Harry sit up, now wide awake.  “Come again?”
They stepped into the alley where they usually disapparated from.  Harry turned so they were facing each other.  He wrapped his other arm around Draco, too, turning on the spot.  They landed in another alley on the other side of London, which was about a block away from Marcella’s.
Seamus just laughed, and pointed to one of the tables near the window; it was covered in a buffet of foods.
“What the fuck?” he whispered.  Or, so he thought.  Apparently, though, he was loud enough for half the table to hear him, because they all turned around and saw who was walking towards them, elbowing anyone that hadn’t heard.  Harry felt like falling into a hole.
“Yes.  I was sitting in my study, reading, when Jissy came in and said there was someone in the floo that was looking for me.  I went into the parlor, and there was Ms Granger.  She told me what she knew, and said that Harry had asked her to bring me here.  I quickly went and retrieved my cloak, and we disapparated.”
Harry smiled at him as they walked out of the dorm.  Waving towards their classmates, they made their way out into the corridor.  The got as far as the first floor, when they heard a “Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy,” coming from behind them.  Stopping, they turned and saw Professor McGonagall coming towards them.
Jumping up, Harry quickly stepped back into the room.
“Well, we can just stay in, get some room service, and watch the wizarding telly, or we can go into town, find someplace to eat, and look at the Christmas lights.  It’s up to you.”
“There’s no ‘if’ about it.  And should the need arise, and you need a break, we have a spare bed,” she said with a smile.
“I just figured you would want to stop,” he said, motioning towards the monument.
Harry huffed, causing Draco to let out a quiet chuckle.  Draco slid his hand down the outside of Harry’s right arm, before gripping it and tugging Harry’s wand out of its holder and flicked it at the door, letting it swing open.  Harry reached around Draco’s waist to where his wand was sitting in its holder on his belt.  Pulling it out, and with a swish of his arm, the refrigerator door opened, and the several cases of champagne came flying out.
He plugged in the lights, showing Teddy the different coloured bulbs.  “Muggles hand these around their house, and put them on their Christmas trees, since they don’t have real fairies, like we do.”
“I want this, too.  I’m sorry about everything.  I’ve written my father back.  I—I don’t want to talk about that right now, though.  I’ll fill you in later.  Just, can we…”
Andromeda and Narcissa were both standing in the doorway, smiling at them.
With that, Harry pulled Draco’s head around in order to kiss him. Draco melted into his embrace.
He fell into his recliner, pulling the blanket around him, turned on the Telly, and began eating his breakfast.
Teddy giggled as he slid under the covers.
“Hurry!  I need you to—!  Ahhhh!”
As the years passed, he sometimes wished Harry would smile at him like that.  All he ever received were glares and hatefully spewed words, though.  Which, to be fair, he delivered back with equal gusto.  That was just the way it was until one day, just a few months ago, all of his dreams came true; he and Harry had started a friendship.  And then, more.  Now, however…
“But, then I remembered you taking down the walls between bedrooms upstairs, and I thought why couldn’t that work? They had just tried to take the painting off, not the entire wall.”
The rope tightened even more, and became even brighter, making everyone squint, before it seemingly soaked into their skins, leaving a light circle around their wrists before fading away completely.
Teddy looked really serious for a moment before he shrugged and said, "Okay!  I'll think about it!" and then wiggled out of Harry's arms and ran off with Victoire.  They just smiled after him.
Draco stood stunned for a moment, eyes wide and mouth gaping.  “
They had been back for about four weeks when Seamus came back from the weekend sporting a huge grin.  Receiving several curious looks and inquisitions, he pulled out a bottle of Ogden’s finest, and declared that Thursday night, they were going to have a party.  Hermione was adamantly against it to start with, but she was worn down quickly.  They didn't know how they had gotten away with it for so long, but no one was complaining.
