Warmth burst up his forearm, all the way to his shoulder. The wand – less stylized than his own and quite unassuming – knew him. It knew him very well. He hadn’t even needed to cast the spell before it went to him.
Right. He should know his way around. “Here.” He pushed open the nearest door. A classroom, looked like. Disused and dusty. One narrow, glass-less window let in a whistling, groaning sound as wind blew past. Somehow it wasn’t cold.
“You can’t use magic on mum’s sweaters. Whoever sells her this yarn must really hate our family personally, because you can
The base of it was etched into the shape of a tree trunk, blending into honey-colored wood. When he adjusted his grip, a miniscule shower of red sparks shot from the end. Ron smiled a lopsided smile.
Harry paused, moving back to the doorway cautiously. Draco beckoned him in, working on the second potion.
“Draco,” he muttered, sitting up on an elbow. His glasses were nowhere to be found and the pillows he’d fallen asleep on top of were squished flat. “The watch.”
Harry looked up. With annoyed concession, Draco reached out his hand and wrapped it briefly around Harry’s forearm.
“Yeah…I dunno. I think George is starting to rely on me to be his guinea pig while – “ He bit his tongue. He’d been about to say
It was a semi-focused muggle photo of Harry standing at a table with a tall, pale man. They both had shears in their hands. The caption read:
“I’ll read it later,” Ron said, less irritable than Harry would have expected. “At first glance, it looks like Horcrux – “
“Got it,” Harry sighed. It was hard to stop himself asking questions that he already should know the answers to.
Friday was spent at the Archives. Half the team was away collecting on an ignored fine subpoena from the Wizengamot, leaving Harry, Ron and Dean to trudge into the Camden Catacombs.
She pointed her wand at the wall, and a roll of parchment unrolled itself from thin air, a quill appearing in Harry’s hand. Throwing her a doubtful look, he stepped toward it, squinting in the low light.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but threw a leg over the broom. Ginny did the same, and they kicked off together.
He got pointedly louder at the end, met with an equally pointed silence from the other room. “Anyway, it’ll be a blast. Werewolf for the Weekend are playing the halftime, and Ilkley Stadium was approved for the first ever firework-replay. At the very least, that’ll be a laugh if it goes bad.”
Everything he knew still wasn’t enough to prepare him for arriving at the Ministry. He managed not to trip this time, but people still stared. It was reflexive, like their necks turned automatically when he entered the room. He met eyes with one short, squirrely man who visibly jumped and scurried away.
“I think so,” Ron hedged, scratching his jaw. She glanced over to him with a raised eyebrow. “We’ll know more after Monday. I’ll owl.”
The line of shops ended at an empty train station. A thin trail of smoke rose from one chimney, wafting past a large black owl sat on a gutter. Ron said the students got off here, canoeing across a lake or riding carriages up to the castle. There did seem to be a path behind the station, but their group walked on toward the trees.
The brusqueness wasn’t entirely unexpected, after their last encounter, but Harry thought question fairly innocent. “I just asked if you – “
So what did it say, he wondered, that she didn’t ask him about the secret Draco had alluded to? Furthermore, why had she failed to inform him of the Floo connecting to Harry’s? She also hadn’t questioned his decision to let Draco stay at Grimmauld Place. Not once.
Harry ignored their continued startled looks. Even Élise’s eyes were wide. “But you said he was a Death Eater.”
Harry leaned away as Victoire grabbed for his glasses – her favorite game, it seemed. George rifled through his cabinets without preamble, making a happy noise when he found the loose-leaf containers Harry had pushed to the back.
“Here.” Ron lifted his sweater and pulled a wand from the two stuck in his waistband. Harry took it eagerly. Strong, familiar heat spread under his skin.
me ever since the Celestina Caramels dropped.” He stood at a giant calendar stuck to the wall, using a pen to write
But Teddy’s hair was purple again and he made a sound of joy at the boy hurrying across the room to meet them. He had a blue and gray striped scarf around his neck, clearly just in from outdoors. Short blonde curls bounced around chubby cheeks and blue eyes.
“I’ve connected it to your house. I hope that’s okay.” Her hair tufted around her ears as she sat up, one streak of soot across her nose.
“And as far as the trial goes.” Draco turned suddenly, bracing his hands on the back of the other sofa. “To be honest, Potter, I have no idea why you did it. I never asked for your pity, and I certainly didn’t deserve it. You gave me no warning you were going to be there and you never spoke to me afterward.”
“She laughed in my face when I offered to babysit.” George strode off to the kitchen, tearing his orange robes off and tossing them onto the couch. “But the brain-damaged, not-even-blood-relative bugger is her first choice. Fantastic. I need your tea.”
The man was almost the height of the door, with heavy muscle that seemed hulking on his large frame. It was his face that stood out, though. Scars. All over, and less delicate than George’s. It made Harry think of an animal attack.
“That will keep it warm,” she said, then crossed her arms. “I assume from the color it’s at least half.”
“I don’t really think poisoning is her style,” Harry said. “Anyone who wanted to do you in would just leave you alone here. Let you starve yourself to death.”
“Alright, Ted?” Dean asked on his way out, patting his shoulder. Teddy grinned at him and shook hands with Seamus.
“So that’s why we got to be Aurors without our N.E.W.T.S.. And that’s why you basically do whatever you want. No one in their right mind would tell you otherwise.”
It started out soft and gentle, a ripple over still waters. A gasp of pleasure turned pain; perfect and sour. A hand, a flame, and someone weeping from the bottom of their stomach. Confrontation that ends in blood and a misplaced spell.
“I know.” Harry thought he could smell alcohol on Draco’s breath, and something deep down inside of him felt…excited. “I understand why you did it.”
Harry said again. George stopped at the door that led to his flat. “I was really scared. I would have sent a Patronus to the Aurors if I could – “
“Seed.” Draco Summoned a small glass vial, like the one he’d taken Veritaserum from. This one was full of a swirling blue almost-liquid. Memory. “Here.” He looked highly uncomfortable as he handed it over to Hermione’s waiting palm. “It’s not pleasant, Granger, I warn you.”
It started snowing around ten, building against the windowpanes in powdery, sifting piles. The first of the year, though according to Teddy Hogwarts had been covered in it for almost a week. Harry took a break to write him about it, wondering how to broach the news that Castor wasn’t a house pest, but a long term resident.
When it was clear he wasn’t about to be reprimanded for running off, his smile returned. Harry let him step away, still blushing. “Sorry – this is Reena!”
“I’m married to a fucking Unspeakable, that’s what,” he snapped. Harry froze. “One who thinks it’s okay to just – “
“We aren’t schoolchildren anymore,” Draco said. He held out the bottle, frowning when Harry shook his head. “I don’t need homecooked meals and friendship to get me by.”
They were acquainted enough by now for Harry to know that the only questions Hermione didn’t ask were the ones she already knew the answers to.
Ron laughed, falling to his knees. The dog threw itself against his chest, straining up on its bag legs to lick at his chin. Two tails – one light brown, one pure white – wagged wildly as Ron lifted him into his arms. “He was just a cruppy when we saw him last.”
Its was suddenly very hard to swallow. This would have been a lot easier before he’d read that letter. “How much do you know about my work?”
“House Elves are citizens now, Potter. Or wasn’t that the first thing Granger drilled into your head?”
The next room over very clearly belonged to a young boy. The walls were plastered with posters of smiling faces or dancing cartoons. One had a flame-haired woman, posing confidently and spinning a broomstick over her shoulder. She winked at him cockily, pointing to the words over her head.
“Here,” he said a few minutes later. Harry turned left, into the narrow alleyway. Something invisible brushed against his hand.
The concrete wound in an arc, swooping left and ending with a wide turnabout that housed a massive stone fountain just in front of the doors.
The sink was lined with hair product, toothpaste, face wash, and other miscellanea. He picked up a stray elastic and used it to tie his hair back.
The unmarked door opened soundlessly, to a room so cluttered and personal it could have only been vacated minutes ago. The bed and walls were adorned in what he now knew were Gryffindor colors – red and gold that gleamed in the low torchlight from the landing. Like Teddy’s room, there were scattered news clippings and periodical pages stuck to the walls. Unlike Teddy – thankfully – those clippings were mainly arranged in teenage ode to the female form.
One of them was sitting on a nearby table. The candle set itself down next to it, providing some light while Harry searched his pockets for the cell phone.
“And keeps them on the Malfoy estate,” Hermione finished, realizing something with a frown. “Like Hogwarts. They’d be destroyed if they were removed.” Draco nodded, and she teetered forward on her toes, visibly drawn to the new well of information. “Why keep it off the registry?”
It was…funny, Draco’s refusal to believe Harry was telling him the truth. Sort of sweet. He’d been smiling as he slipped the hood over his head, and then Harry couldn’t see him at all. Another strange feeling – Harry never knew when Draco was looking at him.
“Lovely music to sleep by,” a voice called. Harry took a step backward, looking in on Draco sitting up and downing one of the flasks.
Harry took note of that. Hermione kept her role in the Ministry very vague – Unspeakables as a rule did not communicate with other departments, but Hermione was often in the Auror office on business Harry knew nothing about. He’d even seen her walking out of the Beast Division on Level Four. About a fourth of the reports in his home office were written by her, and her name was all over the Ministry, so to speak. She had her own section in the Archives, filled with drafts and legislation concerning Magical Creatures and International Cooperation. And now, he thought, glancing at the fireplace, she evidently held some sway with the Floo Network Authority.
That seemed unlikely. What information he could see already meant very little. “What exactly is the plan, here, Ron? I can’t be Head Auror. Not like this.”
They were very high up – glances through the keyhole windows showed more sprawling castle and what may have been a proper Quidditch pitch (he’d seen pictures in his books). The portraits here seemed too bored to stare, except for one. A huge Rococo of a very fat woman, spilling out of a pale pink dress and fanning herself.
“Yeah,” Ron said, tucking his hand into his pocket in a casual gesture that Harry noticed Greenbaum mirroring. Checking for the shape of their wands in their waistbands. Always on the offensive. “Hermione looked into an education – sorry, that’s my wife – “
“Him?” Harry followed his gaze, up to the shockingly cavernous ceiling. It was magicked to stretch up, accommodating shelves and hanging, vaguely fowl-like shapes, all at oblique, lopsided angles. Harry saw more books, a glowing bonsai tree with white flowers, a pale lilac scarf wrapped around an enclosed jar with a rose inside.
He only got out of pub night by making up a complete lie about George needing him. It was a spur of the moment thing, but Ron and Dean had accepted it without even a blink.
“Hello,” he said. She harrumphed and turned back to the paper. Probably still cross from the Howler situation.
‘Castle’ almost seemed like an understatement. It might have been a hundred castles, all mashed together and existing simultaneously against all laws of physics. A majestic gathering of soaring turrets and barbicans of pale, worn gray. Smoke drifted up from several towers. Not a ruin of some old stronghold, as he had expected.
The fire was little more than embers, and Harry extremities were numb with cold. The sound continued, high and rattling.
“It kills,” he said uncertainly. It was more a guess than a fact. But Hermione nodded, and she didn’t tell him what it was.
It swelled to its proper size before bursting. The snake writhed and hissed, flaring its hood and rearing back.
Potter yelled, frustrated. The stranger looked down at him, then for the first time noticed his stomach. Potter looked down, too, pulling his hands out from under him and gasping with pain. It was worse than he would have even guessed. Blood pulsed through his fingers, soaking into the torn fabric of a sweater.
He took a step toward it, then stopped. It was closed again. Hermione had moved – she now stood closer to him, in the process of sticking her wand in her robes.
are,” Ron said in an undertone, reminding him. “I haven’t been to a Hogwarts game since Ginny’s eighth year.” Then, louder, “How’s the shop, Nev?”
It was like a small explosion had gone off – the cacophony ascended to something almost inhuman, and now the
He picked up the flasks and moved them over, glancing at Draco. His cheeks remained wet. “What’s all that about?”
“Fleur said no cursing,” Harry chided, fixing the nappy adhesive despite Victoire’s squirming. “And I believe she said ‘no George’, as well.”
Élise gave Debra a reproachful look, but Harry decided he liked her deadpan. It didn’t necessitate a response.
Ron’s quill came to a stop as he read the memo. He snorted. “Some moron tried to get a photo of you and Ted on King’s Cross – that’s, erm, where kids get on the train to Hogwarts.”
“I – I could ask you the same thing,” Harry replied, stowing his wand. “Is this really an emergency?” He muttered in a lower tone, already surmising that it very much was not.
The inner chamber was massive. Two glowing chandeliers, inset with thousands of individual flames, hung heavily from a ceiling so high it was hidden in shadow. Golden, staring engravings of goblin faces hung from the buttresses, lit in stark relief near high oval windows.
“Yes,” Harry hissed. Ron clenched his jaw. “He was so shocked to see me. It just doesn’t make sense.”
The snaps clicked open and he peered down into the cavernous inside of the case. “A Pensieve, then. I’ll require Marcomannic, is that a problem?”
“You always underestimate,” she tutted right away, pulling her robes open to reveal a little bag on her hip. She pulled another red hat from it and squashed it down over his ears, along with a scarf. “How’s that?”
She nodded. “Not our jurisdiction, anyhow. I’ll try and get a better look near the entrance – be back.”
Harry looked up from her hand on his arm, realizing Hermione had just asked him a question. “I’m sorry, what was that?”
Suddenly, the Slytherin Seeker fell into a nosedive, there was a burst of noise all around as everyone jostled to get a view of the grass. If this wasn’t a Feint, they may just crash straight into the ground. The Gryffindor Seeker was right on her tail, and a collision seemed imminent. Harry sucked in a breath, the wooden bar hard against his stomach. In the corner of his eye, he saw Minerva brace her hand on her wand.
Harry followed him up to the potion room. It smelled strongly of burning tar and cinnamon. More of tar. There was a pile of throw pillows on the floor. Books and stray bits of notes everywhere. Draco threw himself down just as his little stopwatch went off, setting the wine carefully aside and unscrewing a large jar of (Harry took a big step back) angry-looking insects.
“No!” Lou said, taking off his hat and holding it to his chest. “I had no – I didn’t realize. Of course, we can reschedule this, erm, meeting.”
“And what about the risk you took?” Harry had been significantly limiting his time spent outdoors. He wasn’t scared, exactly, but it was a little creepy knowing anyone on the street could be the person that killed Teddy’s father. Seeing Draco so shaken over it made him feel more inclined to take the threat seriously.
Ron and Hermione’s was already very clean. He had just noticed the odd speck of dust or wayward sock under the couch. The dust was always places too high for Hermione to see and the socks were always Ron’s. He also did their dishes, and vacuumed the carpets. Hermione was extremely disturbed by this.
“But you like the darkness,” Harry had teased. Castor’s favorite hiding spot was beneath the armchair.
He nodded. They watched the tide of the crowd, and as soon as there was a break Draco’s hand tightened and the word squeezed to a pinpoint.
Draco shook his head, laughed, and then got serious. The wistfulness returned, and then deepened into what looked like genuine sadness. “Do you promise, Potter?”
“Details, details,” George dismissed, sipping his tea while he wrote. Harry continued parsing out anything explosive – intestinal or otherwise – until only the relatively inane candies and games remained.
“Really?” They were in the shop proper, now. Squeals of delight emanated from the floor below, followed by mechanical laughter and pinball dings. “Are you sure?”
“Babe?” A voice called, along with the scuffling of someone kicking their shoes off. Harry relaxed. George didn’t.
“Harry could get an owl in Diagon Alley,” Hermione started to argue. A high-pitched yapping interrupted her. From the depths of the trees, a white and brown ball of hair bounded toward them, hopping easily over a pile of timber near the little garden in the shadow of the cabin.
Harry stepped around a pile of binders and sat in the rolling chair. Beyond the papers and quills – one half-chewed – were three photo frames hung on the wooden desk. One was of him and Teddy, sitting in his living room. Teddy stretched a roll of parchment, brandishing it toward the camera proudly. The text was blurry, but Harry saw the word
He didn’t sleep well. Not because of Draco. At least, not entirely because of Draco. He hadn’t been sleeping well for several nights now, tossing and turning and waking up feeling drained. Nightmares. They were impossible to remember. The feeling was usually helped by a few cups of tea, but he wasn’t sure it would last.
The first light of dawn forced his eyes open and brought to attention his aching neck. He and Hermione had slumped toward Ron like dominoes. He sat up and rubbed his forehead. They had been talking, trying to stay awake. Hermione regaled him with stories from their Third Year  - time-turners and hippogriffs.
“Don’t mind him,” she said again. “Buck only really likes Teddy and George.” She set a mug down in front of him. Black coffee. “Eggs?”
The shelves thinned out, became more colorful. Draco walked unerringly to the last shelf on a row, just before it ended at a brick wall and a hanging coat of arms that, after a double take, Harry realized was an exact replica of one hanging in the front hall of Grimmauld Place. The Black family crest.
“If you like. Food might get cold.” Harry turned down the alley he always Apparated to and from. “We can walk past the shops at Westminster, they’ve really gone all out – “
Hermione came up the stairs at a jog, clutching her purse against her chest, hair in disarray. “Where is he?”
“Candy. Out next month.” Lee showed him how to fold along the perforations, and how the finished product shaped into a block-bottom container with a film window. “Sort of like muggle wine gums?”
Frustrated, Harry set the parchment down again. “I don’t follow. You think he has the first edition at the Manor?”
It was an office, Harry saw over his shoulder. Full to the brim with Wheezes merchandize in varying states of packaging. And a man - wearing official looking robes and a towering hat. Not quite as towering as his thunderous expression, which quickly melted into shock as he saw Harry.
She exhaled and looked down. “Nothing. I looked into the citation, and…the page numbers he cited had nothing to do with what he was talking about in the prospectus. A certain aspect of the Binding process…or Unbinding, I should say. I looked it up, and a first edition of the text was taken off the market forty-five years ago. I have a good idea of where it must have ended up.”
hadn’t been alone, either. “And maybe I’ve been ghosting someone who thought things were going well.”
Draco shrugged off her directness, strolling a few steps and setting his briefcase on a writing chair. “There’s a copy in the Manor library. Only known print still in one piece.”
When they got to the end of the war, and Harry’s extremely heroic defeat of Voldemort, he almost couldn’t take in any more information. He got the gist – he wasn’t
Harry wondered over that statement, breathing a little hard at the exertion. Too hard, perhaps. Some of his stomach muscles were noticeably faded already at the lack of exercise. “You can’t Apparate into the school?”
There were new names thrown in here and there. A Neville, a Luna, a Michael. Dean and Seamus and Cho. And Malfoy, too. He was
Floo,” Harry said, and a small container floated out from behind a photograph. Ron snatched it out of the air and lit a fire, his nervous energy infectious.
It was nearing nine o’clock, and pouring rain, and Harry would much rather have been in bed. “What did you mean, earlier? About me egging her on?”
He glanced through every shop window on his way. Another menagerie that just sold owls, a boutique, a tailor. A store that sold muggle clothes, its sign depicting a man with a pointed hat walking through a crowd in high-waist pants and a cardigan.
“Work to do," Draco intoned. He had the stopwatch in his hand, clutched next to his wand. There were tiny, empty vials on the cushion next to him, rolled toward the dip of his weight. Probably a keep awake potion, but far too many to be good. And it clearly didn’t contain Rejuvenating properties because Draco looked utterly exhausted.
Harry frowned, remembering the panicked way Draco had looked around. Suspicious. On his guard. Only Harry’s injury had distracted him from it.
George slipped off to the kitchen. It sounded like he was cooking, which Harry wasn’t entirely sure he trusted. He shed his robes and sat across from Lee. At least
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry left him to it. It was French dip tonight, or at least an attempt. One of Molly’s recipe cards was propped against the loaf of bread. It was a bit wonky, trying to figure out the right spells for mincing thyme. Severing spells were too wide and aimless. The same Trimming charm he used on his beard worked much better.
And, just like that, everyone snapped out of it, filling the empty seats and running full-speed into their own conversations. Hermione and Molly kept sending him worried glances, but they were the only ones.
“Moon set is at 10 a.m.. Draco’s in it now.” She held up her hands. “But I brought DVDs and popcorn, so maybe we can wait it out together.”
Several minutes later, the darkness let up. Just slightly. The thick cloud cover revealed, briefly, a full moon. He saw with gasping relief that there was a structure rising up in the near distance. Indistinct, but it definitely man-made. People. There’d be people in there.
“Adventure, eh? No, I don’t think she would. Still, with Harry Potter as a dad you expect him to be able to run with things.”
, still finding a bit of silliness to it that no one else seemed to. “You might have some insight as to what happened to me.”
The rug was hideous, and very obviously ancient. Dark, aged spots discolored the oriental patterns. The other furnishings were nicer. A couch, a few comfortable-looking chairs, and a television set. It looked less lived in than he would have hoped. There was no glaring, blinking neon sign that told him anything significant about the person he was.
He left his letter on a corner of the table, plenty of blank space at the bottom to directly answer whatever Teddy said in his next correspondence. An owl flew into his window almost the moment he thought it, making him jump. It wasn’t Todrick.
Hermione elbowed him in the ribs. “He means…It’s not your fault, Harry. The papers have terrorized you for years. You don’t like the attention, and it shows. Outside of us, your image is sort of…standoffish.”
The inside was even more chaotic than he expected. Every package burst with color. Every package seemed to have its own display. Every
“So what’s bothering you? It’s not the papers, is it? The last article on you was, what, a week ago?”
Mahmoud seemed marginally more flustered now that he was no longer teaching. “At the moment, nothing comes to mind.”
“Snake language.” Ron’s nose wrinkled. “You and Voldemort could both speak to snakes. It’s a Horcrux thing.”
“I understand,” Harry whispered. Little Hermione, being tortured. It was so horribly wrong. “And this is… I mean, it’s common knowledge?”
Harry drew closer, confused at his interest. He tried handing Draco the third container, but got waved off.
“I don’t like it,” he finally answered. Ron looked away from him. “I suppose that’s not the first time I’ve said that to you.”
It wasn’t Sunday, so they must have gathered here just for him. For the first time, he started to hope he wasn’t a lost cause, after all. If the Weasleys liked him, he
With his feet kicked up, his damp hair twisted into a bun while the television played cannily in the background, he felt truly at home.
The weather dropped into cold, wet sludge and rain. Patrons of Diagon Alley cast large Umbrella Charms over their heads and bags, turning the mist into shimmering rivulets as it ran over the charm and to the ground. The goblins strode around in beautifully patterned coats and long ear jewelry that shone even in the downpour, and every now and then there were House Elves out running errands in thick knit sweaters and scarves.
He stepped into the grate and vanished. Harry took another pinch and tossed it in. As the colors turned, he briefly considered just putting it out and going to bed.
Ron Apparated them to a place that looked remarkably like Diagon Alley. The buildings were all gray or white, but their windows burst with color. Warmth emanated from the protruding glass displays in the lower levels, and the lit candles in the upper ones. A very tame Diagon Alley.
Draco painted a convincing picture. Flying above the raised stands in the largest stadium in the continent. He
“It’s yellow curry,” she said, nodding to the bowl. The sudden change in subject was the first tactless thing he’d seen her do. “Your favorite.”
Harry chuckled and rifled through the pile of mail with his free hand. “Sent this around six this morning. Right when Fleur showed up.”
A hand slid down his arm, depositing glasses into the palm of his hand. He put them on gratefully, locating his wand stuck against the couch leg. Draco resumed his position on the floor.
It was the first night he didn’t feel awkward in this house. So far he’d pictured himself as a guest, but that couldn’t last forever. The gradual settling part of all of this had to include accepting that this was his house, and so he allowed himself to relax a bit as late night programming played in full force. The Darjeeling was light and sweet, fogging his glasses with every sip.
The ornate iron knocker – some winged, fanged beast – glinted at them. Hermione tapped her wand to its nose and the chipped black door swung inward. “After the Fidelus fell apart, we had to get a fair bit of Ministry sign-off to put up new protections. Just your signature, really, and
It was a kitchen. The table was long, the room as overwhelming as the other had been. Every surface – walls, tables, counters – was lined and dripping with trinkets. Food, photos, books, newspapers, works of child-like art. One had a brown and black scribble that he guessed was meant to be a chocolate pie.
“Well, if you need someone to watch Victoire…” he hesitated, unsure why he was offering. “I mean, I suppose my schedule is quite empty until my memories are back.”
It was meant to be the day before, but there had been some sort of Bowtruckle infestation across the Great Lawn, courtesy of a Care of Magical Creatures class gone awry. Apparently some third years had fed one of the insects an unidentified Weasley product that had triggered mass reproduction. Mooning, indeed.
It was dark. Near pitch-black, but the sounds around him were vaguely…forest-like. The sound of rain was muted and echoed, like a barrier of canopy gently broke its fall. Standing up straight made it too hard to breath. He bent forward, sucking in air against the agony.
She feinted toward him, laughing harder when he moved away. “But you’ve forgotten all my weak points, haven’t you?”
She turned on the top step, laughing at his expression. “I’m joking, Harry. You know…” the laughter fell away, remaining only in her eyes. “We broke up a
“You garden,” Ron said, lunging across the table to spin one of the small ceramic plant bowls around. Harry had stuck them in the window to catch the sunlight. “That’s a change. What are they?”
“Oh,” Hermione sounded surprised, and interested. “That’s…specific. But it can be done. I’ll need a – “
Back in the bedroom, he dug through the chest of drawers. Everything looked the same. All the underwear was black, and the most colorful socks were pushed beneath the rest. In that same drawer were a number of medals. He picked one up, turning the gold medallion so it caught the light. Order of Merlin, First Class.
“Harry,” Ron breathed, rubbing a hand over his neck. “That’s not…I mean, I s’pose I appreciate the gesture, but that’s not what want.”
“Make yourself at home,” Hermione encouraged, shrugging out of her blazer and throwing it over a kitchen chair. Harry took his boots off as she started the kettle. Pictures hung on the wall in a nicely arranged collage of bold frames. Her and Ron. Ron and Harry. The three of them. Ron and four other men that were clearly family members. Only some of them moved. The rest were muggle pictures, still and staring.
She flinched, arm tightening in his. “I wouldn’t recommend re-introducing your memories like that. It might do more harm than good.”
Harry stared at the fireplace. Draco had been quite drunk during their conversation, so there was no way of knowing if it was the moon or the alcohol talking then, either. “We talked about Quidditch.”
He weighed the broom in his hands, then looked up at the sky. “Fairly good at this, am I? I’m not going to fall?”
She didn’t look at his scar, but he was suddenly very aware of it. “I’m, erm, fine. It’s everyone else who seems to…”
“Something brilliant!” Teddy suggested helpfully. Harry thought that was an absurd request, but the crowd was chanting his name, still, and the wand was in his hand. When had he taken it?
Harry almost wasn’t prepared for such a long answer, even though it really wasn’t that much. Draco had been talkative these past twenty-four hours. “Cursebreaking must be a lonely job.”
“Find me before you go, Harry,” Hagrid said, giving him a meaningful look. “I, er, need yer help with summat’ at me cabin.”
to get the muggle governments to let them at the museum collections, but they won’t allow it. S’pose there’s no real explanation for the Mona Lisa turning up brand new.”
“I knew you,” he said after a few moments of silence. Draco finally met his eyes, warily and almost unwillingly. “Enough to testify at your trial.
He sighed and pulled his legs up, slumping down against the pillows. Harry dropped the cover over him and cast a warming charm.
“You think a Death Eater’ll formally ask you to duel?” Ron cast another curse. Harry blocked it, managing to get in a Sponge-Knee curse. Ron blocked that as well, but he too was knocked back a step. “No. They’ll do whatever it takes to kill you.”
that I know her day was more than just eight hours. She’ll admit to a few hours, ‘to make ends meet’, she’ll say. On days like today, though, it’s so obvious I can’t pretend to not notice.”
The snake never really spoke unless Harry asked him a direct question, happy enough to sit on his rock or near the fire. It wasn’t the most stimulating of conversation, but he figured it went above and beyond expectations as far as any animal was concerned.
Todrick flapped his wings once, making a friendly sound, then Harry was leaning away from the rush of feathers as he swooped outside. Relief was short lived. That was just one problem out of his way, and hardly the last. There was the matter of the forgotten…person. Less than a boyfriend, it seemed. Serious enough that he’d told George.
“No,” Ron snorted. “C’mon. We’ll be back,” he said to the team, and Harry turned away from their curious glances to follow Ron toward the lifts. They stepped inside, and Ron prodded Two. The level they were already on.
Mahmoud didn’t even have to think about it. “I cannot think of anyone with a vendetta against me, if that’s what you’re asking.”
Hermione had been to Grimmauld Place twice. He didn’t know what they did over there, but the curiosity was killing him. Draco wanted nothing to do with him, though, so he tried to forget it.
One phrase got thrown around more often than ever before. “The twins”. They were at the center of every story, in one way or another. Always together, always in matching clothes and equally shaggy hairstyles. Always together, so there was nearly no need to utter Fred’s name at all. Just ‘the twins’.
“Well, erm.” That was sad. At least George wasn’t entirely alone. “I’m sorry it has to be that way. How long have you been together?”
“Whenever you’re there next is…is fine.” She slumped back, lifeless, like her work was finally done. “It’ll all be fine.”
“This Tesco’s?” Harry asked, in the middle of writing a letter to Teddy. He set the parchment and pad on the coffee table, pulling the closest paper edge down to look at the piles of crap food inside. “They have a sale on?”
The owl just clicked its beak impatiently. Harry sighed, giving him a few more cubes. He had a feeling who this letter was from, and he was both extremely eager and dreading to read it. He would have to reply, and then the jig was up, wasn’t it?
Harry stared down at the odd peace offering, then dug through his own pockets. These were the same robes from Tuesday, weren’t they?
“It’s not only that.” He raised his wand again, looking up at the topmost row of his ancestors. “Those that pass their lives in houses like this leave something of themselves behind. Even with a House Elf, this kind of repair is…exceptional.”
“Trouble in paradise,” he said, tone growing scathing as Hermione glowered. “Potter’s been keeping secrets from you.”
Harry had wondered over that a lot - how it would be when Teddy wasn’t at school. When Harry got to wake up and see him every morning and feed him and put him to bed at night. Even if eleven year olds were too old to be put to bed, they could still stay up late together, or fall asleep on the couch the way he and Ron did. Or was that too chummy? Should he be firm and disciplinarian about it?
The carpet was visible for the first time in…what looked like a very long time. Harry dragged his toes through it, pushing up the gray fibers where they had been pushed flat for so long. Pointing his wand at tea stains. He even got down on hand and knees to really thoroughly fluff, picking up stray bits of paper as he went. Hole punches, receipts, sugar quill wrappers, several aluminium bottle caps. It was worse near the bottom of the desk.
“And we have wanted posters all over,” Ron said. “Everyone knows what Dolohov and Macnair look like.”
Ron shoved all the unchewed food in his mouth to one cheek so he could speak. “Binding magic. Not very well known, but then again our Archive doesn’t have a huge selection of Dark books. I spent two hours going through a book called
“And the team owners. Ours is Melody Zeyad, and the Kestrels’ is…his name is Darragh Ryan. And the Irish President of Magic, perhaps. I’m sure you’ve met all of them at least once before. If Ron’s with you, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“So I’m told.” Harry leaned back against the granite. “I…we’ve been getting on. I think. Working together.”
Draco looked around, face blank. His eyes seemed to halt on Harry for a second longer than anyone else. He looked in the region of Harry’s tie, and Harry hoped – irrationally – that Draco hadn’t seen the paper that morning. He also wished he’d taken some tidying charms to himself after the dueling.
Draco tore the meat off a chicken bone, no visible chewing involved before he swallowed and took the next bite. Not unlike how Ron usually ate, but that was Ron. This was prim, proper Draco. A blue-blood in the most Dickensian way.
Draco fell to his side and turned onto his back, staring at the ceiling. Every few seconds a near-silent burst of laughter disturbed the air. He moved an arm up under his head, the lean stretch of muscles drying up the laughter in Harry’s throat.
The snake’s tongue flickered in and out for a few moments. Harry’s back hurt, but he didn’t dare move. Somehow, he knew he shouldn’t. Someone (Ron) was breathing very hard, and he bet there were at least two wands trained on the snake.
“One time thing,” George assured, squeezing his shoulder. “Promise. It’s not every day you have a Harry Potter at your disposal, though. I had to give it a try. Breakfast?”
The deep pink ones looked like pansies, but he didn’t recognize the others; tiny red flowers all clustered together in a single stalk.
Ron unscrolled a long, crowded document with about a hundred small drawings arranged in two columns. Some were clearly Egyptian in origin, but the others were more minimalistic. “Can you think of anyone who would want access to this information?”
“I have a lot of responsibility. You understand that.” The way she said that clearly referred to the
Grimmauld Place’s parlor was silent. Harry went straight to the door, listening intently before pulling it open and standing in the hall. The torches flickered with their usual ennui.
Ron didn’t notice Reena tagging along until they were descending one of the staircases. “Oi, who’s this?”
“You knew me.” Harry thought of Hogwarts. Draco was always there, in Ron’s stories. “Enough to recognize me with
A slurry of emotions flashed through her eyes. Hermione was sort of like a hummingbird; any time he felt like they had settled in the same place she was already gone, moving ahead where he could never catch up. Ron was so different – steady and slow to change. But there were two clear things they had in common; their steadfast loyalty to Harry, and…
“What…?” Harry looked down at the newspaper slid in his direction. On the front page was a photo of him. A photo of him – not
The Briticism fell awkwardly through her accent. She and Ron alone shared the main table, with, shockingly, paperwork spread between them.
“Ron just stormed in all upset about something, and a few minutes later Hermione came in, and now they’re having a row in Harry’s office.”
“Do be patient,” Draco admonished, a hint of real irritation behind his words. “Every Death Eater that’s died will stay dead. The Dark Lord wasn’t so interested in binding us as he was in the control.”
George sat, letting his tea steep. Again, something had changed. He was more drawn into himself up here. Or just sober. “Weasley products are officially banned. Then again, Flitwick ordered thirty Headless Hats for his class just last week, so…” He shrugged. “Foot in the door, and all that.”
“Luna.” Ron rolled his eyes. “She had her face half-covered with a scarf. Even if I hadn’t known who it was, the papers are
“Yep.” Seamus cast his eyes up, thinking. “That would have been his…fourteenth? It’s a big help, actually, as it’ll be one less place for them to hide. We think Dolohov must have Apparated there, with you, but got spooked before he could…well.”
He felt George looking at him. “This store is what kept Diagon Alley alive after the war. I’m literally the
Choosing to shop muggle was the right decision - the lack of a robe left him a bit bare, but the eyes that passed over him were disinterested and on their way to something else. His face (scar) was a scenic stop, not a destination.
Ginny had on a heavy cap identical to the one Luna had stolen, only black instead of red. Rosy cheeks and deep red lipstick made her look like a painted doll. A rather horrified doll, at least.
“Carys is with him now. We prepared oolong for Mistress but he prefers mint. Do we have fresh mint?”
on him, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t change his mind. Draco didn’t look worried about it, though. A slow, thin smile spread over his face.
“Was it? I did make an effort.” He smiled wryly, nails digging into his palms. “What are you thinking?”
There it was. The slightest break in his voice that matched a sharp pain in Harry’s chest. “I didn’t,” he admitted in a hushed tone. Teddy looked away, shoulders tense. “I have gotten to know you…a bit. Through your letters. And Ron and Hermione told me so much…”
“Then it doesn’t matter if he knows you’re here or not. He can’t get inside.” He sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Outside is where we need to be alert. Constant vigilance.”
“I know I’ve lost – er, forgotten things. But with everything I’ve learned…it seemed an oversight to ignore him. Since he was a Death Eater, and all.”
There was some more muttered, hungover conversation. Harry looked around, charmed. The town was settled into the bottom of a hill. Pine, birch and alder trees spanned every direction in a wide spectrum of oranges and yellows, bleeding out into foggy mountains and hills.
He gave Harry a weird look, then shook his head. “Dolohov is the one who did this to you…we think. He escaped, after the war. Another Death Eater. We’ve been tracking him for months, and we finally found him in one of their old safehouses. I lost you for a second, a
“But it wasn’t - “ Ron looked away, gazing at the pumpkin pots. “You didn’t actually get better, I don’t think. You were pretending. But you fooled us for a long time, up until Christmas...five years ago? The
The room had gone quiet, save for Debra’s quill scratches – though even those were getting slower. Ron had an openly bored expression, but he was listening as intently as the rest of them. The posh accent was quite good for storytelling, Harry had to admit.
Harry wound his fingers together in his lap so he wouldn’t tap them against the wood. He understood that the war had been bad, but did it really need so much ceremony? It had been ten
He stopped himself from calling out her name, blinking at the picture in front of him. Hermione was on the couch, slumped sideways with her eyes shut. A blanket had been half-pulled over her shoulders and a book sat open in her lap, moments away from falling to the floor.
“Nothing,” he said. “Just – I think they must be having a party in the common room right now. They were decorating this morning.”
.” The man said, clearly noting Harry’s lack of tea. “Don’t have too much fun. I’m gonna go shower the pitch off me.”
“You could be right, Harry,” Hermione cut in, wedging between them. “Though it’s much easier to believe he’s had help.”
It lowered its head, dropping to the floor and twisting around closer to the fire. Hermione released a massive breath as Harry got to his feet.
“I can tell you made these,” he said, in wonder at the complexity. More than that, though, he sensed the same faint buzz he had when he held her wand. Hermione nodded, waiting for something.
“I think about a thousand women would come forward claiming you as the father of their kids. No, really,” she giggled at his face, stopping the sink and squeezing some excess water from the collar. “It happens all the time, as it is.”
public space in wizarding London has wards out for Dark Marks. They trip alarms, trigger Floo and Apparition closures. Even private homes have heightened protections – like the Burrow. There’s no way he could walk into Diagon Alley without someone noticing.”
Harry was the last person to ask. He pulled over a chair and they worked it out together, spending quite a bit of time bickering about grammar. Ron didn’t hesitate to point out Harry’s lack of memories. After they had tracked down a grammar guide in Élise’s desk, Ron ordered lunch.
“It’s not your fault.” He looked very on edge, all of a sudden. “You don’t remember doing any of it, so I don’t know why I’m - “
Any strength the possibility of help had given him seeped away. Walking this far had taken all he had. He wasn’t going to make it. He was going to die alone and injured, with no idea of how he’d come to be here, or who he even was.
Ron rubbed his face again, thinking in that scrambled, mostly efficient way he had. “It doesn’t explain how - “
When nothing revealed itself, he walked backwards and shut the door. Draco was looking around the floor almost frantically. Trying to help, Harry opened his mouth to
“Aye,” Hagrid said. Harry swallowed. “Mayhaps you oughta try talkin’ to it. I think he’s used to me, but since yer new and all…”
He left Grimmauld Place in a daze – avoiding the parlor and strolling out to the street. Draco had agreed to dinner with him. Well, dinner
bar inside, buzzing with people while the low-lit booths were left empty. Rain pattered the window, an undeniable chill creeping in.
Lee laughed and shook his head, “No, but we’ve got plenty of that, if you like. Eat a few of these, and you’ll sound like a specialist. I just had three.”
“Need back up, Harry?” A goateed man with a Chudley Cannons tie called out. Horrifically, it looked like he meant it. One of the onlookers had poked their head into the office, drawing more witnesses.
The simple quiet of his home made the next feel quite chaotic. He had only just stepped out of the network when he was set upon by a squat older woman with extremely curly white and ginger hair.
Ron had a hard look to his face, but not an angry one. Hermione was trying to examine Harry from the corner of her eye, which he was of course growing used to.
“I have no idea. But we’re very lucky she doesn’t know just who my guest is. Then you’d really never escape.”
“I...dunno. I hope not. I don’t think I’ve said anything too terrible.” He smiled, looking a little like George.
“Of course we did. He’s my only nephew. And you needed us, because hard as you tried you were a nineteen year old bloke with an entire baby to keep alive… but I think the three of us put together did an alright job.”
“You’ll walk straight up the central staircase and to the left,” he said in a low voice, frowning at a button. “The library is past the Beryl Conservatory. Large mahogany door. All you need to do is say the name of the book you’re after. Understood?”
“Simple logic. You know there must be a spell because I asked you to do it. It’s not a real memory, is it?”
“I’ll start on it,” Greenbaum said, stopping to shake their hands at the base of the stairs. “A pleasure, Potter.”
It took an entire afternoon Vanishing what wasn’t needed. Some files seemed unrelated to office goings-on – he stuck those in an empty desk drawer. Finally, there was just a single tower of files to be passed by Ron again – just in case. They looked unfinished and still had quilled scribbles in the margins. As little as Harry wanted to be in the office, he was quite worried about getting rid of something important and his coworkers suffering for it.
George sobered, then relented, shifting the baby around to cradle her in one arm. “I was at that card game, is all. Knew Albne would try to run off without paying.”
The shower was stocked with the basics – he even thought he recognized some of the labels from his own place. So he started the water and took his clothes off. He was clean already, but it was the false clean of charms and magic. Not water and soap.
“Later.” He fell back with a grimace, pulling the duvet up around his neck and shuddering. “Girding Potion. Quite foul.”
The second was him, Ron and Hermione. Their wedding day, it looked like. Ron tried to coax a shorter-haired Harry into the frame. It looked like he was politely refusing. Hermione gestured, too, but still he tried to ease himself away.
Dean started resetting the wards, muttering to Seamus about caverns and Warming Charm dead-zones. Ron hurriedly wrote down some directions.
“He’s also a professor,” she corrected, which was some news to Harry. “And when we were first years, he hatched a dragon egg in his house
Hermione was in his chair, head bent forward onto one hand. Ron was leaning over the desk, in the middle of saying something that sounded really cutting. Harry couldn’t quite catch it, because as soon as the door opened he stopped.
caught the snitch, a Cockney penalty resets position. Broft should’ve gone for it instead of hedging on a tackle.”
“This room is spotless,” he said, with a touch of incredulity, walking behind a couch. The fabric was ancient and colorless before. Now it sparkled in powder-blue jacquard. The rug no longer frayed at the edges. “I bet all the others are, as well.”
Nothing. The Cloak was too powerful for that. He squeezed his eyes shut, hearing voices approaching the blast site. Probably police, soon.
A good amount of people were there. A pair of young men boisterously played a game of pinball. Every time one of them lost the ball, they were squirted with a spray that Harry could smell all the way across the room. Three boys none older than ten ran around pointing, followed by a harried looking older woman. A man around Harry’s age tried to decide between Amortentia or Beguiling Bubbles-scented perfumes.
voices. Harry didn’t call out, just moved silently toward the back wall of displays. There was a door there, ajar, with a plaque that read
“You look very nice today,” she said, apropos of nothing. He instinctively looked down at his plain black robes and dress shoes.
Alone again, Harry looked around. The papers were mostly reports from subsections of the Auror office. He swiveled, sighing at the mass of information. Most piles must have had balancing charms attached. It felt like he’d been trying to brick himself in.
She gave him a strangely irritated look. “Oh, you must spend more time with her instead of getting an impression through Ron and Hermione.”
Ron smiled weakly. “It’s…Teddy, you know? It’s always been about Teddy. You brought him here when he was two. That’s when things started to get better. You...had someone to take care of, and I think that took your mind off the worst things. Mum camped out here for about a week to help you adjust, and I thought that would really drive you mad, but you took it like a champ. George called you Diaper Man until Teddy was old enough to tell him to stop.”
Harry dropped from the pull-up bar, arms crying out in exhaustion. “You said it was fifteen, before.”
“I love you, too,” he promised, beyond pleased Teddy could still say that to him. The hug ended, and something in his chest broke a little. Ron and Hermione insinuated that Teddy going to school had been hard on him, and it was easy to imagine this was how he felt watching him get on that train. Fear and apprehension and guilt.
own most of our shares, Harry, mate. A rising tide lifts all boats, and I need to buy time to make a formal complaint against the Ministry.”
Harry didn’t want that. As scared as he was after that Howler, he wouldn’t feel any better sitting here while Ron dealt with everything. “Close with them, am I?”
Up in the Owlery – an isolated tower that smelled exactly as he expected – Todrick flew down and perched on Teddy’s shoulder, nibbling affectionately at his ear until he fed him a treat.
“Oh,” Harry said, and left it at that. They turned onto the drive, walked past some trees, and there it all was.
“Oh. Well, long story short, their hieroglyph programs were falsely accredited. She never told anyone, though.”
They went back and forth with their arguments, Draco continuously alluding to plays and history and Harry relying only on his gut and limited experience. It was engaging, like talking about Quidditch always was, but Harry couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to Draco about it. And how clearly Draco
“’Bout time,” he grumbled, sitting at the center table gracelessly and dragging a folder his way. “What’s this?”
Seamus took a sugar quill from his mouth, Vanishing it and giving Harry a reassuring smile. Everyone filed into a seat, leaving the end empty.
Where to go…? He had money. A lot of money. The bookshops looked inviting, but there were so many at his flat he was no longer acquainted with…He didn’t need a broom. There was one at his house, leant against the wall near the sofa gathering dust. He’d take it to the Weasley’s on Sunday.
It was smaller than Harry thought a crup should be, but the long hair suggested some cross breeding. It jumped from Ron’s arms to Hermione’s, who looked begrudgingly charmed as it sniffed wildly in her hair.
For the first time, she looked at him. Abruptly, he understood. It was very, very scary. He made a concerted effort not to shrink away from her gaze. It wasn’t angry, he hoped, but her features didn’t seem like they’d allow for much else. Ginny’s description had been bang-on:
“It’s…there’s a barrier. In your mind. Your memories are there –  I broke through it. I even tested…giving one back to you. Remember?”
“So I take it we’re not on the best terms?” He asked, thinking back to that night, recalculating. No. It still didn’t quite add up.
His face was kind, if irritated, but that expression melted into a smile as he looked over. “George’s trying to make me test another one of his dissolving contact lenses. Will you
Debra sounded even more stoic after Élise’s quick, Belgian accent. “She makes it sound easier than it was. One spell alone took everything out of you, and then you had to do it again. For
Ron laughed shortly, dropping his head to his hand. “You lost him, too. He was your friend. You – “ He stopped, breathing unevenly. Harry didn’t know what to do. He just sat, knotting his fingers together.
“The bird won’t…” he sighed, dropping the sweater and pulling his hair free. “Doesn’t matter. Don’t bite anyone, okay?”
Harry wasn’t at all eager for that. He put the box in his pocket and stood, regretful he hadn’t gotten to spend any money. “You haven’t told him?”
Again, he said it like the idea was absolutely ludicrous. Everyone else made brave attempts at poker faces.
Ron raised his wand up, holding it like a microphone. “Code Demiguise at Euro-Glyphs. Respond immediately.” A silvery shape shot out the window. “Doctor, would you tell the front desk? You’ll have more Ministry on the way.”
, evidently – was asleep on top of a bookshelf. Harry left him to it, shedding his robes and running up the steps to his office. A quick look through the desk drawers produced an envelope, quill, and string.
had a Jack-O-Lantern wreath stuck to its door. As he walked past, a pumpkin pasty shot out of the crooked mouth, hitting him in the chest. He picked it up, moving past
They watched sparks shoot through the air, illuminating darting figures. Harry joined in the laughter as Ron and George almost came to blows over a misplaced
“It’s plenty warm down here. I don’t need to die a slow, painful death because I rolled on top of you and you bit me.”
The Gothic Revival building currently blocking the sun marked the beginning of campus. It was tall and proud, presiding over Chancery Lane like a librarian over a rowdy student. It was a muggle university, but he knew Euro-Glyphs was somewhere inside.
“Well, that’s a bloody first!” Ron yelled. Harry bristled, clenching his fists. There was a short, tense silence while they glared at each other. No sound came from the kitchen.
Another world where Draco hadn’t been… a child nazi. An instrument in the hands of adult, more capable nazis. Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was talking about anymore.
” Hermione asked. “I mean, the materials we’ve pulled for you could be tracked through library logs, but no institution would allow him to view – “
“What do you all think?” He asked. They exchanged glances. Dean crossed his arms, glancing between Harry and Ron.
– had him half-believing it should be looming over the city like a bad omen. And maybe it was, but the cloud cover was in full London fashion. Thick and creeping.
Hermione took a deep breath, gripping the clipboard. “It’s quite a lot to explain, Harry, but we need to keep you out of the public eye right now.”
The woman that appeared the oldest went first. Dark hair was pulled back into a severe bun, making her sharp features all the more intimidating. She said her name was Debra. The other woman, Élise, wore a black hijab. A good looking black guy was named Dean, and the man next to him was Seamus. He remembered those names.
The pitch loomed high above, the raised stands billowing behind maroon and green banners. It was a cloudy morning without too much sunlight, contrasting as sharply against the colors as they did against each other. They couldn’t see inside from this vantage point but it was clearly a full house. Not even the railing wind could cover the sound of that many voices.
That was surprising to hear. And mildly devastating. Ron hesitated before saying, “Of course he doesn’t.”
She caught it, staring at the cover in blank shock. Giving him a wary look, she opened the front cover and two seconds later closed it, breathing hard.
Harry moved closer, drawn in by the softness of Draco’s voice and captivated by his expression. Somber and contemplative. Torchlit, he looked quite Byronic.
Draco nodded to the window, his reflection faint and wispy. “I always thought you were a prat. You got away with everything, and I hated it. I hated you.” His head bowed down. “Is that what you wanted to hear?”
still sat on the coffee table, marked halfway through with a receipt from the corner store. “Trying to.”
Harry went to his office and shut the door, rubbing his arm and reciting the seven uses for unicorn hair under his breath. Then he started on the thirty five variations of holly, looking through the stacks of paper for anything interesting. Departmental reports, mission debriefings…it looked like they’d busted a major illicit potion ring just a few months earlier. That sounded exciting.
“Now you’re sounding like yourself,” Dean winked, starting on his own set. “Got any plans this weekend? We miss you at pub nights.”
After several hours of looking at indistinguishable ginger children in old photographs – Molly getting quite tipsy, along with Arthur – Harry started to wonder why they hadn’t done this before. Everyone present was overly eager to tell Harry an old story, only for everyone else to but in with their own recollection of the same event. The stories varied wildly, arms and hands smacking Harry on the arms as the maelstrom around him pointed and gestured toward the photobook Molly had placed over their laps.
, never Draco, and Ron only ever spat his name like it was something dirty. To hear him tell it, Draco had…bullied them? Antagonized, anyway. It sounded like Harry had given as good as he’d gotten.
“Where are you from?” Harry asked, trying to be gentle and keeping his wand in his hand. He didn’t know if the ability to communicate would make the snake any less inclined to lunge at him. The voices behind him went silent.
Ron started laughing again, and after that the mood stayed light. They seemed to actually enjoy telling him about the nice, normal things. Every now and again, though, something innocuous would make them both clam up. Harry’s dating life, or lack of one, made them sad. He guessed it had something do to with his prolonged depression.
“But I’ve been with Hermione for hours! Why wasn’t I pulled in for questioning? Wouldn’t that have saved some time?”
Charlie’s voice floated through the door, then out to them as he pulled it open. “It’s bloody freezing out here. What the hell are you two doing?”
was lit up and blinking words in his direction. Rows and rows of them, each name more ridiculous and intriguing than the last. The second level looked less garish, but it was quite a ways to get to the steps.
“He’s fine, physically. It’s just…” Ron faltered, and Harry could see why. The concern in the room was palpable. No one moved. Harry was so tense he was nearly shaking.
“Alright.” Ron smiled at the waiter as he picked up the money. “Blimey, I could use a cigarette. Hey! If you’re on the wagon, now, we could at
Harry had stopped listening, ice cold terror shooting down his back. “What do you mean, not permanent?”
“She always thought you hated her,” Bill remarked, sidling up next to Harry in the garden. Harry had just spent an hour Transfiguring rocks for Victoire’s amusement. Now George had her, and was dancing to the Celestina Warbeck that drifted through the open window. Fleur and Charlie hovered nearby.
The other two felt much more concrete as people. Ron seemed very opinionated. Harry liked him just fine, though, he decided. Hermione was harder to read. He’d seen glimpses of someone clinical, calculating. Not at all like a person who broke down crying all the time. It must just be the situation at hand.
His accent was posh, aloof. Everyone sat up a little straighter at that, their faces just as blank. Except Ron, who looked distinctly miffed.
The stairway had switched. Not moved, like at Hogwarts, but…they had been climbing down, and now they were going up. Large windows on either side showed the library courtyard far below. The last of the dizziness faded as he reoriented. He lowered his arms where they were held out for balance.
“Enough,” he said quickly. He didn’t want to talk about the war. Not here, not with these people so clearly effected by it. “I think they wanted to make sure my head was nice and swollen.”
Weasley, that there are still at least fifteen safehouses scattered across Europe. Dolohov knew I was there, and he left Potter behind to see if I’d
“Yes, but not through theft. I offer all of my work to any student affiliated with a university – even a Hogwarts student, several years back. The man I worked on this with has his own copies, which he also distributes.”
“What do you think of – “ George stopped as the door opened in the other room. The way he snapped his head up sent apprehension through Harry’s chest. Was this a break-in? In a
He felt his mouth fall open a bit as he scrambled to cope with this subject. The simple fact that he was unbalanced only unbalanced him
“Karkaroff came by quite frequently to make use of the…older texts,” he said meaningfully. Hermione looked a little less outraged, but whatever the context was went right over Harry’s head. “He brought a student, once or twice, when I was young. Their curriculum is much stronger on history than Hogwarts', though. Especially the Persecution.”
“We haven’t fought like that since…” he laughed to himself, shaking his head. “What’s ‘Mione told you? Anything?”
She shook her head. “You don’t get it. Catching Dolohov is all you have cared about for the past ten years.”
“Is he staying for dinner?” The robed one’s voice was deep and accented. Welsh. “We always alert the kitchens and he ends up leaving before tea.”
Draco glared at the candle, for lack of eye contact, and swiveled on his heel. Harry followed him around a few tight bends. He had grown up in this place, with access to this library. He knew exactly where this children’s book was without invoking the naming spell. Had he read it before?
Seamus come to him? Ron and Hermione were married. It was a mite inappropriate to be doing this at work, but it didn’t seem too bad.
When he returned, she had the blanket wrapped around her, almost comically heavy-lidded. “I didn’t mean to doze off. Ron should have woken me on his way out.”
In a wordless jilt, Harry lifted the tip of his wand, peeling the layers apart and sussing out the differences. “There’s someone else, isn’t there?”
“Oh, look. This page is only a list of names. Do you know any of them? Lupin, Tonks, Fred, Sirius, Colin, Lavender – “
Harry sat back, his chest tight. Every scribbled out mistake – every violently underlined word. The small, bashful
The Great Lake, as they called it, was probably gorgeous in the summers. On a day like this, it reflected the gray sky and some mist hung around the far off shores. That area offered the best view of the castle. Something massive shifted out in the center – a movement in the corner of his eye that left ripples curling outward. He found himself gripping Teddy’s arm in alarm.
“Harry,” she grunted, attempting to help in the half-carrying of her husband. “You know you’re welcome at ours.”
It was overwhelming, sending the darkness spiraling deeper into his lungs. Something was about to burst, and he wouldn’t survive it. Not as he was now. The voices persisted, growing in volume and speed. Stones whipping against glass that was slowly cracking. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t answer them, he couldn’t –
under November Third. “Apparently I’ve committed copyright infringement or some such shite. Though Celestina Warbeck doesn’t
With absolutely no warning whatsoever, Hermione burst into tears. Quite violently. Her chair screeched back and she fled the room. Ron’s eyes went very wide.
“Aurors,” she said in a thick, stern brogue. Her face was severe – all thin lips and arched eyebrows. Telling her age was difficult. Clearly, she was elderly, but there was a steely set to her back and a sharp intelligence in her clear brown eyes. “I’m certain your presence here will rile my students.”
to protect himself from the worst of it, jumping to his feet before the dust settled and whipping his wand around in a circle, searching for the attacker. Not a soul. He heard screams from the buildings, and down the street. Car alarms were going off nearby. His ears rang.
It was fairly weathered, pale beige like the building below, but there was a mark that stood out. Just on the corner, three small scrapes, dark and slippery under his touch. Varnish.
It was late when he made it back from the pub. The neighbor’s windows were dark, the streetlights keening in the quiet. He showered the smoke and grime away and lounged on the couch with a book about Quidditch. It was only one of many, and he needed to recover a lot of knowledge before Sunday and his inevitable rematch with Ginny.
,” George yawned, sticking a mug under the tap and heating it with a spell. “Drink it, and someone nearby will moon over you for an hour. Nothing too morbid – the fun’s in running around trying to figure out who it is.”
“You liked Molly Weasley’s cooking well enough. I suppose I’ll have to keep bringing it by,” Harry challenged, raising an eyebrow. Draco’s lips parted, smiling wide enough to show his teeth. The inner parts of his mouth were stained red.
“Er, I suppose? Like I said, I don’t know if you’ve been there or not. Maybe you used it for storage or something.”
Harry looked at Draco, at the long lines of his arms and the turn of his nose and the circles beneath his eyes. He looked at this borderline stranger and could suddenly put it to words. The sleepless nights. The curiosity. He wanted Draco. Quite badly. It was such a strong certainty Harry could only assume it had always been there, regardless of their animosity.
Penning a letter to Hagrid took a while. Harry filled him in on Castor’s settling in and left an open invite for him to drop by whenever. Hopefully that wouldn’t seem too out of place; Ron and Hermione made it seem like they were fairly close. And Harry’s initial reaction to the snake must have seemed terribly out of sorts to him.
George gave him a look for his polite tone. “Officially? Two years. I think. We were best mates in school, the three of – erm, but he moved abroad after the war.” He glanced away, crossing his arms. “I actually wanted to tell you something…but I didn’t know exactly how.”
He had changed clothes. The plain black shirt had been swapped for an identical one in deep olive, tucked into trousers that tapered at the ankles. Checkered socks and strange, flat shoes with dull finish. The grandeur of it made his face appear all the more ghostly, and the snug fabrics drew out his thinness.
Ron glanced up at one of the stopped clocks. “Insurance wards stopped the clocks… Doctor,” he raised his voice a bit. Mahmoud perked up. “There would be a Duplication of what was stolen, correct?”
The ghost blinked, and then floated back up, straightening his waistcoat importantly. “Of course. Carry on, good sirs!”
He wondered why she wouldn’t want to help. Maybe George had used Hermione’s vast knowledge for evil too many times. “You couldn’t stop yourself from suggesting it, could you?”
Teddy looked up, and then behind them, where the others lagged. Luna was still lecturing Hermione about her horoscope, and Ron was making some acrobatically boggled expressions at Neville. “
He was relieved. He’d testified for Draco – that had to count for something. Defending him now wasn’t
He smiled when he himself was younger, too. The second album appeared to be his Hogwarts days. Before the
“Granger,” Draco said flatly, raindrops shining on his shoulders. At odds with his tone, there was a wary set to his jaw.
A snake was a snake, though. After a leisurely few hours of hot chocolate and chips in the warm confines of the Three Broomsticks, which Hermione sulked through, he stopped at Diagon Alley, risking the Saturday crowds to duck into Magical Menagerie for some supplies. Then, on complete whim, he stopped in at Twilfit and Tattings.
They hadn’t gone past the second floor on Harry’s first visit. Hermione would have to show him which one belonged to Sirius. “I’ll do that.”
“Yeah,” she breathed. “That’s just it. Passing thoughts, like I think about anyone else. It used to just be worry.” She exhaled a cloud of fog that diffused the glow of scattered pumpkins and gourds, charmed to illuminate the path. “Have you been to see Luna? Or anyone?”
Harry did. The eggs were hot, and crunched between his teeth in an interesting way. It wasn’t at all perfect; the middle was liquid, like they’d been cooked too fast over a very high temperature. Better luck next time, house.
George walked with him down the staircase, lowering his voice where it would echo. “Ron swore us to secrecy.”
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was still open, but Mel was beginning to usher people out. She gave Harry a half-eyeroll that he took to mean
“By all means.” Mahmoud stood. Ron’s shoulder brushed Harry’s once as they both got to their feet, then again with purpose. Harry cleared his throat.
“Dr. Mahmoud is the Director of Euro-Glyphs, London. You can find him on the third floor. Office number thirty-one.”
“The first was…simpler. In theory. One’s soul remains intact, but they are joined to another. Bonded.”
He shrugged, the scars on his face twisting as he laughed. “You’ve never babysat, or really talked to her at all. Until now. I told her that was just how you were. I didn’t know any different. Just what Ron and Fr – and George always told me. Now, I think I get it.”
Harry glanced at the Floo canister. He was used to her talking nonsense, but maybe a trip to St. Mungo’s was needed.
She covered her face with her hands for a minute, breathing heavily. “As much as I wish it could be, this isn’t permanent. I only let it go on to – to hopefully give you a bit of perspective. After.”
“The Burrow,” she took a sip. “Helping Arthur with the garden. I should be getting over there, but…”
The woman stood out for the opposite reason. She was beyond just beautiful. Beautiful felt like an insult. Though she wore understated clothes, her long hair and smooth white skin seemed to glow, emanating a halo of absolute perfection. The baby balanced on her hip was just as perfect, its large cheeks flushed pink from the wind. A ruffled silver dress complimented a tuft of bright red hair.
And this. She was standing so close to him, hand turning to clasp the underside of his upper arm. It was a delicate, intimate kind of touch. Just the other day, after dinner, she’d fallen asleep heavy against his side while he and Ron played video games.
It was quite startling. In robes of black with silver lining – clearly much more expensive than Harry’s – Draco could have been a Hogwarts ghost, such was the pallor to his skin. There was a faint, irritated sort of flush to his cheeks, but even that leached away as he saw who was in the lift.
Draco thought for a still second, staring at the cover.  “A Pegasus wanders into a garden, and eats an apple off the ground. The garden belongs to a centaur, who scolds the Pegasus for stealing. Of course, the Pegasus has no concept of property and asks the centaur why he would begrudge a fellow beast this fallen fruit. The centaur claims he is no beast, that he is a fellow to man, and that he has a small fortune of man’s coin that he uses to trade in the nearby town.
“Yes. As was being born a squib.” He tapped lightly over the black mark between Cassiopeia and Dorea, moving closer to Harry to point to another. “Cedrella. Married a Weasley.”
The words were mechanical, emotionless. When he was done, Draco blinked like he was coming back to himself, and cleared his throat almost nervously. Dean frowned.
They went on like that for a while, spouting utter nonsense about the flowers until the words stopped coming, and they were down to
Ron laughed, easily slipping into a story about their first day in Transfiguration. It was laden with warmth and familiarity, like he’d told it a thousand times. Maybe to Teddy. They’d been late – a concept he now found horrifying, after meeting her.
“He means the Dark Mark,” Ron said in an undertone. Harry looked him over for any such thing, but the robes did a good job of covering his skin.
Once, he went to her and Ron’s place and cleaned while they were at work. He was frustrated at the ancient rug in his living room and how it resisted any form of upholstery charm. He half wondered what would happen if he stuck it back in Grimmauld Place, where it had come from. Would it miraculously become good as new?
He grunted in surprise as Ginny slammed herself straight into him, gripping his broom as to not topple right off and realizing too late that he’d dropped the Quaffle. She was already racing off with it.
I did ask him, when I was delivering supplies yesterday. And he…he said it won’t work, because after he’s drunk the potion, their link will be forever broken.”
“Don’t you think it’s a bit strange, Harry, that Dolohov somehow sent you straight to another safehouse? One that Malfoy just happened to be cursebreaking?”
“You okay?” Harry asked him, when they stopped at the gateway door. Teddy looked up, eyes flashing to Ron.
“Get down,” Harry said. Draco’s eyes flicked to him for less than a second before carefully tracking the snake’s movements as it wound around Harry’s bare feet. Harry wasn’t wearing a shirt. Not that it mattered. Not that it
“…Alright. I think I can manage that.” He’d been expecting a flat out refusal of his offer, now he found himself tasked with going all the way to West End. “When do you have to start up with the potion again? Tonight?”
He followed, tugging the collar of his cloak a bit looser. Questions buzzed through his head as they walked. Maybe he just wanted to fill the silence. Soon enough, he was sufficiently distracted by hundreds of eyes turned in his direction.
“They’re mates. At least, they were all through school. Zabini endorsed his job at the Ministry, so parents were furious when he got his position here, but McGonagall doesn’t much care about that sort of thing.”
want to go into that house. Something in the air seemed wrong. Evil. There was no way for him to know that, but his gut advised strongly in walking the exact opposite direction.
“Is that how you thought of me?” Harry asked, keeping his voice low. He didn’t want to startle Draco by speaking so close so suddenly. “The Pegasus?”
“Receptionist was able to help me,” Greenbaum said softly, on their way out. “The wards have some additional protection at the statue, but no one considered other points of entry as vulnerable.”
That explained some of the staring at the hospital, at least. It also explained why Hermione hadn’t wanted him out and about. This wouldn’t be easy to hide…especially from Ron’s mum, who already knew something was wrong.
“The Auror department had been all but eliminated, or replaced by Death Eaters. Unspeakables weren’t talking about anything. Everyone else was coming out of a months-long
“Too bad.” Harry bent and let Castor wind up his arm, helping the main bulk of his body curl around his shoulders. Draco’s eyes narrowed and he stepped more fully out of the hearth. So the big Slytherin himself was scared of snakes. “You can go now, or you can wait for me to finish dinner and I’ll go with you. Have you eaten.”
, he found he wasn’t hungry anymore. He paced around the sitting room, trying and failing to catch any conversation from behind the formerly open door.
Harry looked around, dumbstruck. They’d never bothered to ask Draco to help, instead searching out Death Eaters on their own for
If she fixed him tomorrow, would he thank himself for wasting this time? Time where he could recklessly follow his impulses without the years of baggage holding him back. Time to
“What? Can’t even say ‘hi’, now?” He called. Harry opened his mouth, shutting it again as a heavy hand landed on his shoulder.
There really was nothing for it – he went to the Leaky Cauldron, declining the barkeep’s offer of a pint on the house. And that wasn’t the only offer; three other tables shouted his name. Maybe people he knew, or just people who knew him, but all the calls were sufficiently slurred that he felt fine just ducking his head and hurrying into the alley. They’d probably forget he was ever there.
“I think he does,” Hermione said eagerly. “I think a first edition may have information that was taken out of the later copies. After the rise of You-Know-Who, so much information about soul magic was hidden away so people wouldn’t go looking for it. Why not this? The author could have just pulled a few pages from the manuscript so he could keep it on the shelves. I think Draco may have…fudged.”
“Thanks.” He went in and turned on the light, shutting the door softly behind himself. This was his bedroom. This was where he slept every night. Of course, he didn’t recognize it, but the state of things didn’t make him feel any better.
“This cloak. I drove myself mad as a second year trying to figure out how you were always out after curfew and never getting caught. I just assumed the staff allowed you to break the rules out of adoration.”
None of it explained how he could have so much money. He asked Fleur about it when she returned, bringing more of the lavender scent with her. She conjured her own tea pensively, switching the needle over to a livelier track. Her robes were white and seemingly imbued with a glowing charm, but maybe just had that effect on things. Even her mug seemed whiter than it should be.
Harry rolled his eyes. It was disconcerting, walking down a city street knowing he wasn’t alone. His instinct wanted him to slow down and keep Draco on his left, like he would if he were walking with anyone. But he couldn’t see so much as a shoe tip.
“Well…I wouldn’t guess that it would be an easy wand to work with, with someone else having mastered it. Unless you allowed him to win it back from you. But clearly, you think you’re still the master?”
Harry stared at a photo of Ron and Bill with Victoire sitting near the window. It had been the most draining day yet. First Hogwarts, which made him feel better and worse, then a blundering meeting with Neville. Nice enough guy, but he wasn’t in on the secret. Harry had tried his best to be surly, and sure enough Neville hadn’t caught on to anything amiss.
“I wonder how good their Chaser is,” Ron wondered about the team as they walked. Hermione had nestled under his arm, arms crossed and her scarf over her nose. “What did Ted call her? Pinciotti? But it’s also on the Keeper, you know? And the Beaters…”
A half-eaten breakfast sat on the sitting room table. The coffee was still warm. Harry checked the rooms before moving down the spiral steps toward the main store. He’d sent Pig, so the letter must have come from here.
And the flashiest. Nearly entirely covering the second story windows was a massive, neon sign that read
“It’s your house, now. Sirius left it to you. I don’t remember the last time you actually went over there – after Kreacher passed away, you and Hermione warded it to bollocks and that’s pretty much been that.”
“Aren’t you freezing?” Hermione cried over the volume. Luna plucked the hat from Harry’s head and fixed it over her own. One of the flowers fell out of her hair and onto the wooden floor.
Below the green of anti-Apparition magic was something equally complex but less familiar. Higher energy – mauve and lilac. Anti-intruder, certainly. “What does that do?”
it read. He looked around, hoping to see some sort of…doorbell. Or something. His knock echoed ominously along the walls.
George shook his head. “Please, Lou, it’s only Harry. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind being the one to reschedule. Though he is
No answer. Draco’s quill scratched jerkily around, his shoulders hunched forward. Harry wondered if his presence had helped at all, or if it would have been like this anyway.
He levitated some of Victoire’s toys. She would laugh and reach up for them, toppling over and rolling around until he or Fleur set her back up.
Harry looked up as they approached a high wall. Teddy was in there, somewhere. Harry hadn’t told him an exact time. Was he waiting?
“Don’t be silly. I asked you to,” she muttered, rubbing the spot. “You stung me. That was an…odd choice.”
The staff box was more of a mixture, but only barely. Harry saw Zabini at the far end, talking to a blonde woman. The other professors he couldn’t name, except for Minerva at the front, next to two students. One was in plain black robes, the other all in red with matching, firetruck colored hair. Harry made a move towards them.
They ate their toast in silence. Hermione watched him. He didn’t see the clipboard, but she was clearly taking notes in her head.
Ron was looking through the old Christmas photos with a half-smile. “Well, the Black family – historically – hates muggles and anything to do with them. And so does the house.”
“Told me she’s an exchange student, which might explain things. Sure, she could be a suspect – her and every other student who might know.”
Draco, laying prone on the other side of the cauldron, didn’t move. Harry leaned over and shook his socked foot, repeating his name. He refused to be the one to tell Ron they’d lost three months of work because Harry had gotten Draco too drunk to stir.
“SLYTHERIN!” The green half exploded, matching her volume impressively. The green team circled the pitch once, fists raised. The audience was a bit hard to control after that, until a fifteenth figure kicked off from the ground. The announcer – Emma, Teddy informed him – introduced him as Gregory Dickson the Flying Instructor, and referee. The teams flew to meet him, getting into positions. Then someone on the ground opened a large trunk, and the balls were released.
Ron stared at him. Hermione sighed and took the bags from his arms, leaving them to go rustle around in the kitchen. Harry stood there, tense and uncomfortable.
“You’re leaving this early in the day?” Harry looked back. His office door slammed shut with a spell from Ron.
Harry froze, pressing the end of his pen into the parchment. She didn’t sound surprised or disgusted or anything like that, so he didn’t find it necessary to refute or agree with her claim. She must have seen his cauldron set up across from Draco’s at Grimmauld Place. While not exactly friendship, that he would voluntarily spend time over there was probably sign enough that things were very different than how they had been before.
Ron’s face was turning red. The woman patted his arm consolingly. “He’s here. They’re holding him for questioning, but he’s…fine.”
He stepped under the water, letting the steam fill his lungs and force his body to relax. It was a relief to be by himself, but it was also uncomfortable. Well and truly alone, without even the company of his memories or a good sense of personality.
“Granger mentioned…” Harry looked up. Draco willingly speaking to him was new, and welcome. Even if he seemed unable to look Harry in the eye. “You attended the Hogwarts game this weekend.”
“It’s fine,” she called, leaning over the hearth and into the firepit. There was a burst of green light that made her hair frizz. “It should work now.”
The first place he looked was in the bread box. There was a white loaf inside, fresh despite the lack of packaging.
The woman looked between the two of them with increasing concern. Ron’s face was nearing purple, and Harry was really getting tired of this.
The doors opened on their own as Draco approached. There was a House Elf just inside, wearing a beautiful tweed suit. They bowed low. “Master Draco. How lovely to see you.”
Draco put his attention back to the books, pulling out a narrow thing, more cover than pages. It looked ancient, too old to be touched by gloveless hands. He set it down and started waving his wand over it in even, straight lines. A Duplication charm.
“I’ll get us a booth,” Neville said. As they walked off he tried giving Luna his outer robe again. She refused.
She stared at him for a long moment, cheeks darkening. He looked away guiltily. Oh, God, this must be horrible for her. Clearly, they were
“It’s a pain in the arse. Pick up the wrong book and have your eyebrows singed off. Gallahey almost got us kicked out for throwing one against the wall. It called her mum a cu – uh. A rude word.”
No answer. His heart jumped to his throat. Draco had been hit. He was unconscious somewhere and completely invisible. “
Draco was right beside him. Together they tried to pull the curtains closed – which was impossibly difficult to do – while taking ear-splitting abuse from the old hag.
They both turned. Harry’s heart jumped to his throat. All this time to think on it, and he still wasn’t prepared.
She held out her hand, and the pen flew into it. Wandless, wordless magic. He knew that should impress him. Brandishing it like a wand, she asked him again to disarm her.
Harry couldn’t explain it. Confidence, that’s what it was. He was confident – bone-deep – that he could defend himself just fine. “I bet I’ll win.”
Reena was shy at first, but Teddy’s bubbly personality brought out laughter and even giggles bordering on hysterical. Harry learned that she was a half-blood, from the wizarding village of Barnton, and that she was the first Gryffindor in her family. Her and Teddy showed off their newfound mastery of
Harry joined him there. It was still early, but the sun was climbing higher, casting long shadows down the empty square. “It’s London. He can hide in plain sight.”
“I visited her this past week,” Ginny said. “Just tea, didn’t make it up to the school. She asked after you.”
Harry stood next to him, getting a closer look as dark lines filled themselves in, words curling across with nary an inch of space to spare. It was a massive, ever-changing diagram of the inner workings of the Ministry. Ron tapped his wand to their division, and it as well as a third of the board turned red.
Their goodbyes were bare bones. Draco just waved them off, opening his briefcase and leaning in up to the shoulder to dig for something. Harry held the umbrella as they strolled down the street instead of Apparating, headed for the nearest decent-looking restaurant.
“Bought it off some muggles in town,” he said. The embers lit up as he inhaled. Not a cigarette, Harry realized as he smelled the acrid smoke.
Hands. Tendons and skin pulled taut with the effort of what they held. Veins struck out too prominently. When they twisted, straining to break the thing between them, joints groaned like a moored ship. Knuckles broke through the tender wrapping of flesh, spraying blood. Then, a clock in reverse, the hands were healed. This time, the ear of corn cracked with a neat, dry rasp. A thousand breaths in the darkness rushed toward him.
Harry had yet to see the mysterious, muggle-hating portrait of Sirius’ mother, but he wasn’t at all curious. The heavy black curtains could stay eternally drawn over the frame, for all he was concerned.
Harry, startled, patted her back. The walls of the room caught his eye first. Every blank space had a framed photo stuck to it, creating the rather dizzying effect of a whole lot of ginger heads smiling at him. He didn’t have time to take it all in before the woman was holding him at arm’s length with a frown.
Draco sighed again, fixing his eyes on the middle distance. “The International Statute of Secrecy,” he began. “Ratified in 1689, three hundred years after the Persecution began. I won’t bore you with basic History of Magic tripe – you all know it was long before even the trials that magic users were being sought out by the Church. If they weren’t paid to prophesize or heal, they were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.”
“Those extra two pages you photographed,” she finally said, with moderate reluctance. Not much, to be honest, just a bit of history…I told you the original citation was wrong.
Draco smiled at him. “How wonderfully honest of you.” He tilted the bottle back. Harry watched his pale throat work in a swallow. “I’m afraid it’s not going to get any better.”
Harry didn’t expect it to be flipped like that, but Hermione only rolled her eyes. “We’re not here to argue, Malfoy. Have you everything you need?”
“What?” He asked defensively. Harry raised his eyebrows. “I’m allowed to be concerned! If it’s as bad as the two of you say he’s essentially at death’s
“No. Just lie to him.” And he wasn’t even sure he had Draco’s trust, to begin with. It was more of a begrudging partnership.
“Right.” Harry snatched the note of directions away. He wasn’t sure where his eagerness to get away was coming from. Or his particular curiosity about going out in public…but surely they couldn’t run
Draco was walking so fast it seemed he was purposefully trying to leave Harry behind. He clearly didn’t want to be here. Harry wondered why he had agreed to this at all, and why he had agreed on bringing Harry.
Harry swiveled on his heels. Draco stood in the doorway, and Harry was further unsettled because he, too, looked different. Instead of the dark draping robes, he wore plain trousers and a large mocha jumper, shoddy yet obviously expensive. His white-blonde hair was only sort-of pushed back, some of it falling over his forehead.
After some tossing and turning, he flopped to his back and sighed again. With trepidation, and – ridiculously –
There was a hush over the unrelated squabbles in the room. Ginny pursed her lips, pausing in her movement for a refill of whisky. In the corner of his eye, Harry saw Hermione reach over the back of the couch to take Ron’s hand.
“I should be thanking you,” Draco said, just on this side of too wry to be sincere. His mouth twisted in another empty smile. “This is perhaps the only wizarding home in London that would welcome me.”
“Just a bit of Spatial Switching,” she comforted. “You hung onto each other, didn’t you? That always makes it worse.”
“Merlin,” the kid breathed, scrambling over the back of a chair to run up a staircase. “I’ll get my broom!”
Harry looked down at the rug. Old, perhaps once beautiful but now rotting at the edges. “Why’s that?”
by myself? All that we’ve worked for – it’s all in jeopardy right now, and I – “ She dropped her hands to her sides. “I don’t know what to do. I need you. This is – it’s bigger than you or me. Can you understand that? You don’t know what you want, and…and neither do I. Not anymore. So you need to come back.”
“No,” Harry blinked, astonished. He looked down at himself. Nothing had changed…but then, he wouldn’t exactly know if he was missing epithelial cells, would he? “What did we do?”
All he knew about himself was what he’d been told. He played Quidditch. He’d fought in a war. He was an Auror. He was quite bad at Potions. Repeating those facts to himself didn’t make them feel any more real.
Harry pondered that. He didn’t know much about Legilimency. Maybe he would look for a book the next time he went to Diagon Alley.
“You’re not,” Draco said, which seemed a strange thing to argue about. Harry threw the empty air next to him an eye roll.
“Well, regardless.” He took one of his new sweaters out, holding it against his chest and hoping it would accentuate what muscle he’d accumulated in the gym. “Have you ever bitten anyone?”
“I already told her I can’t stay,” Draco went on. “You’re not her messenger, Friga. Just ignore her if you wish.”
Harry huffed and got to his feet. Hagrid handed him a small, wire cage. Hermione immediately took it away, shaking her head.
“What if there was something you really didn’t know about me? Something I could never seem to tell you for some reason? Because I was too sad and alone and scared.”
“We did,” Debra said. “We do. But Shacklebolt put the kibosh on any magical interrogation, so…we wait. We watch.”
Hermione seemed to subconsciously realize he was looming over her like a ghoul, and snapped awake with a startled
“Before,” Debra folded her hands on the table. “You said you had no knowledge of what could have been done to erase all of Harry’s memories.”
Harry laughed, which nearly made him choke on the last of the candy as he swallowed.  “What do you do for a living?”
Harry exhaled a laugh. ‘Unsuccessful’ biting aimed at a rough handler was less worrisome than the alternative. “Are you trying to strangle me?”
“You’re the eldest son,” Harry said. That’s what primogeniture meant. But wizarding society didn’t work that way anymore.
Too late. The nerve was lost. “You know, I think you should talk to someone else about this. Someone with a firmer grasp on the situation.”
“I could use some fresh air,” Harry said. Draco frowned at the insult, glancing over to the potion. It smelled like sour milk. “And I think you could, as well. So I have a proposition for you.”
She looked nonplussed. There was a short, jaunty saxophone solo from the sink, comically out of place. “Don’t do this, Harry. Don’t assume…”
“I’ve got to get to the Burrow. I’m late, and I still need to get dressed.” She stood up and stretched, walking off.
He laughed again, listening in on Percy and Bill’s conversation about Gringotts and cursebreaking, Fleur joining in every now and again. Seemed contentious, but he noticed that Percy inevitably ended up agreeing with whatever she said. Something about her felt oddly familiar. He couldn’t pin it down.
Still listening, Harry walked to the kitchen. The beaver scurried after him, earning distrustful looks from the owl perched on the back of a chair.
He hadn’t even considered that. Minerva hadn't said anything of the sort, and if there was a child services division of the Ministry, he doubted they knew of his condition. Teddy, at least, looked relieved. He wound his fingers together in his lap and stared down for a long while. Silently.
“Remember this, love?” Molly asked Arthur, pointing out a photo of two young identical boys sat at the kitchen table, one toddler between them. “Boxing day, ’85.”
Harry pulled on a jumper, coaxing Castor over his shoulders and starting the morning with tea and signing his name on a tall pile of papers Ron must have dropped off while he was sleeping.
Ron nodded. Harry shifted his weight, aware that it sounded like he’d been giving him false hope. “She’s trying.”
Harry set the heavy tote on the table, ears ringing. “I didn’t think. I was just knocking to be polite.”
He hadn’t seen her since that one came out, and anticipated her cheeky wink as he walked into the office. “Hello, Harry, me lover.”
Potter looked up at him through heavy eyes. His last moments on Earth might be with this person. This person who knew him. “Who are you?” He asked. The words didn’t sound right. They were warbled, thick.
Harry grinned as the dog scrambled into his arms. It was surprisingly heavy, or just well-fed underneath all that fur. Underneath a heavy white fringe he could see dark eyes, and a pink tongue swiped against his nose when he didn’t pull back quickly enough. He laughed and scratched behind it’s ears.
That was the truth of it, but Harry shook his head. “I suppose it’s selfish. There’s only so much other people can tell me about myself…and the life I lived. I could be missing something important and not know it at all.”
galleons. Three weeks previous he’d also taken out a larger than usual, but still relatively small, amount.
“It will pass,” Draco said, pulling his jumper over his nose and mouth. Harry summoned a small, empty vial and shut the door back, coughing. That couldn’t be good for the wallpaper.
But Draco reached forward, his hand reaching out and sliding up Harry’s arm to grip his shoulder. Harry couldn’t move, his instinct to retreat turning into something else, watching in wild anticipation as Draco’s other hand came up toward his head to pull the hood down. It was suddenly very hot under the Cloak, and he was eager to get it off, to breathe in Draco’s wonderful scent and –
The sudden absence of sound was jarring. Ambient city noise was cut out, replaced by chirping birds. The dim alleyway was now a meandering country lane. Browning grass swayed at the edge of a line of tall trees, in an autumn mix of orange and brown and green. The clouds were thinner there, sunbeams falling over an open field on the other side of the road. There was one house in the center of it, but Harry knew that wasn’t where they were going.
“Which part?” Her expression had closed off, shoulders slumping in like her mind was already back at the office.
“Let’s see,” Ron was saying, half-sat on the one spot of paper-less desk. “Dean and Seamus are our mates from school. We do pub nights most weekends. Élise will tag alone every now and then, but she’s a lightweight so it’s touch and go. And Gallahey – that’s Debra – she thinks were all idiots, I expect. Not you, so much. At least, I’ve never heard her call
Then it was gone. Draco flicked his wrist and flung it into the cauldron. Despite the thick viscosity of the pure black potion, it sank right under. Draco clicked the watch off and spun it.
, so he popped into an alley off Langely Street, enjoying the short walk to the restaurant that he had also had to search up in the directory closest to his house. His thoughts turned to the night ahead, trying to shake off the fight and how uneasy it had made him.
It was a sick irony that being Harry Potter could open every door except the one he most wanted to see behind.
Belatedly, she chuckled, pointing to the checkered v-neck. “Wear this one tonight. The cardigan’ll go with it.” She made a show of looking at his bum. “Are those trousers new or old?”
By the time he'd read the thing front to cover, the light in the room had changed and his ankles were loudly protesting his crouched position.
The room was sparse. There was a rather hideous painting of a unicorn hanging over the bed, made up of garishly bright blues and greens. A peek at the flourish of a signature in the lower corner showed the name ‘Fleur’, which he knew he’d heard that night but couldn’t remember when.
“Oh, it is,” Draco pulled his hands behind his back, taking slow steps as he browsed the dusty bookshelves set into the wall. The look he shot over his shoulder was overly-innocent. “To Durmstrang students.”
“You look like shit,” he said as she tilted onto the couch. Buck hopped up onto her lap, nosing at her hands for a pat.
“I can’t think of anything that wouldn’t be charmed against enemy eyes…” Ron sat back and popped a jelly bean into his mouth, staring blankly at the pile of paperwork in front of him. “Though if you ‘n ‘Mione aren’t calling him the enemy, guess I should stop, too.”
On the way back down, he wondered where Draco was sleeping. The only remotely welcoming rooms were Sirius’ and, he assumed, Regulus’. The rest had barely more than a couple of mattresses on a bedframe, clearly converted to sleeping quarters during their stay here during the war.
“Not this stuff – just think! We’re ubiquitous around campus. You know it’s being passed around – what if you could send your special tyke the
Ron nodded absently, already on the last page. It looked like an expense report. “This is quite a lot.”
He thought again about Draco. It was clear he wouldn’t be seeing him tonight. Ron was dead set against it – he
“I….” He took a breath. “He’s got some stuff going on, I suppose, and I don’t think I’m the person he should be talking to…at present. Or ever. So I just…suggested he talk to you. Or whoever.”
At least, not until he stepped into the kitchen. It wasn’t a pleasant picture – the sink was full of dishes, and take out containers littered the countertops. Half empty mugs of tea sat on the little brunch table by the dark window. Among them were two large, empty bottles of firewhisky.
“How,” Harry said, interrupting her rapid flow of words. “Will I carry on a conversation with anyone without them realizing something’s not on?”
“I can handle it,” Harry said absently, ordering a tea as Ron ordered a beer. He kept looking out the window every few seconds, like he was waiting for someone. Harry finally asked him about it, after the third time.
Ron’s face fell slightly. “Oh. Well, I’d rather you…” he stood up, pacing in what small space allowed it. “There are Death Eaters after us. You, specifically. What if you can’t defend yourself? What if you forget to be on your guard, just for a second?”
Harry took in as much as he could, noticing the names Neville and Luna coming up quite often. Every now and then, though, he would catch George frowning at him. Not glaring, or gazing sadly, like Molly. Just frowning. The rest of the time he just looked at the grass, rarely joining in on a story.
jinx flew past his ear, slamming ineffectively against the portrait. It only seemed to enrage the occupant.
“It’s undisturbed,” Hermione announced, echoing Harry’s ward inspection from the night before. He had interrupted them getting ready for work, so she was in house shoes and a satiny headwrap. “I doubt he would be reckless enough to have tried it, anyway.”
. It wasn’t too much of a leap, in his opinion, to put it together: he must have wanted a pet snake for a while, and waited for Teddy to go away to try and…train one? If they could even be trained, that was. Why he needed an illegal, cross-bred cobra was a little tougher to answer.
tell me anything. Fine. I knew that’s how it would be, with her work and all. A few years in, I realized
“I…” Teddy wanted him back. Did that mean Harry hadn’t completely ruined everything? “Whenever you want. You’ll still write, won’t you?”
. We might as well have him working in there, if it’s all semi-temporary. I certainly don’t need it.”
He thought he could escape when everyone began shuffling to the Floo or outside to Apparate. Only Percy remained, finishing off the bottle with Arthur.
A glimmer, to his left. Harry fell to his knees, feeling around the ground until he found something soft. Draco. The Cloak yanked away easily, caught only beneath his body and not a wayward block of cement, as he feared.
The words came slowly, long pauses in between. Hermione was no longer teary-eyed, but clearly still out of it.
“Yes, well.” Draco stopped smiling, and stopped waving his wand. He picked up the children’s book, only it remained on the table. There were two copies now, seemingly identical in every way. “This should last her five days,” he said, dragging his thumb along the rough edge of the cover.
to groom you up to it. You could have been the next Minister if you didn’t openly despise politics. Not to say you still
“Not Macnair or Dolohov. That’s two.” He held up two fingers to match, ticking off as he went. “Malfoy’s dad is in Azkaban, as are Rookwood, Rowle, and Crouch Jr.” He put down his index finger, leaving only five. “Who doesn’t count. So, the way I see it, we need to ease off the search.”
“Professor, may we have the room?” She asked pointedly, hanging her cloak on a hook. The space was small and warm. Four armchairs, some artwork, and a large wardrobe adorned the walls. One of them housed a thin man, deep green robes draped over his crossed legs. He was rather handsome, though his curious expression turned sour as he met Harry’s eyes. With a snap, he closed his book and strode off through another door. All without a word.
“But. In the meantime…” She chewed her lip. “In the meantime, you need to show up. Be seen. People will start to talk if you just disappear. The amnesia story is contained.” She ticked off with her fingers. “The Healers know. They won’t talk. The other Unspeakables obviously won’t.”
“Oh.” She shifted just slightly, the corner of the blanket falling over the book cover. The wireless clicked on when she pointed her wand, a disembodied voice bringing them up to date on the latest banking trends. "Just something for work.
“Yes.” He dug in his long sash, producing a single scroll of parchment and handing it over. “One of my old projects. Translating architectural hieroglyphs for a counterpart in Giza.”
Draco snorted, and then hid his face in his hands. It wasn’t until his shoulders started shaking and he snorted again that Harry realized he had well and truly made Draco
“With a snappy title, no doubt,” Harry muttered, looking up as Ron stepped through the portrait hole. “Hey!”
He un-relaxed. Suddenly crowds of fans didn’t seem half as bad as causing an international incident because he’d forgotten the name of the Irish President’s wife or something.
“I remember that,” Ron said at Harry’s ear, crowding in like the rest around the back of the couch. “I’m still crying in this photo because they’d Stuck a mousetrap to my foot that morning – “
“She’s not.” In the time it took Harry to go bring Ron and Hermione back through both his fireplace and this one, Draco had donned robes. They swished impressively as he uncrossed his arms. “None of them are. There’s no trust left between the families after they sold each other out to the Ministry.”
Draco tensed, meeting his eyes for the first time. They seemed, in flickering torchlight, paler than usual. The irises nearly white, rimmed in red from the strange weeping that was going on.
His voice was loud, friendlier than it had been last night. Harry let his eyes go wide, stepping in and speaking in a hushed tone.
“I’ll let him know. And I’ll tell him...you’re doing good. Which is a relief, by the way. You were properly devastated about him being gone.”
The pain was gone. That was relief. He was comfortable, warm and dry instead of freezing, muddy, and wet. There was light beyond his eyelids. It didn’t seem too incredibly bright, so he tried opening them.
If he was friendly with his neighbors, it didn’t come up. The shine of his celebrity must have worn off with these people. A very old wizard nodded politely to him, busy supervising the unmanned rakes moving over his lawn. Directly to the left was a married couple with an excitable basset-hound that barked in the mornings. Any children on the block must have been away, at Hogwarts with Teddy.
