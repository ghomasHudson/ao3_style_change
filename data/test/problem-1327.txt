He had spent 5 entire days looking into the life of a person through other people’s eyes. There was no journal of hers, no written notes or secret love letters, no engraving on the ring or a lover to recite her woes.
Two weeks would mark 2 months since he woke up and forgot everything from the past 5 years. He didn’t realise he spent so long in St Mungo’s. Time there didn’t feel real. But it was expected. Tina said sometimes he slept for days in between counter-obliviate sessions.
Harry looked up at him, and watched as Malfoy began to slowly pull up his walls. He wasn’t looking at Harry, in fact, he was looking intensely at the half-eaten plate of breakfast in front of him. It even looked as if Malfoy hadn’t slept at all, despite knowing for a fact that he did.
“You’re Harry bleeding Potter, have you ever made sense?” Malfoy threw back. His voice was calm, annoyingly so, and it irked Harry to no end.
After about half an hour, give or take, Harry and Isolt walked down the stairs into the dining room only to find the picture frames still all over the floor. He looked at Isolt’s corner, but she didn’t move off his head. Before he could tell her to go, Malfoy’s voice rang out.
It never seemed like the right time to go to Teddy, so he hung around the dinner table. He ate the treacle tart that was put out a few moments ago, savouring the taste. Then Luna popped up next to him.
“Yeah, you’re right…” Harry trailed off, and guilt grew back again, realising that he didn’t really know that, not completely.
His fear of walking through that floo into a place he couldn’t call home. The dread that the kitchen would look like the one etched into his childhood. Scared of walking through the house and seeing things that just weren't Harry James Potter. All of that, he didn’t realise it.
Malfoy thought for a bit, then sat next to Harry on the floor. They weren’t facing each other, and somehow, that made it easier to talk. Just like when they talked about Harry’s desk job.
As he began to walk away from his desk, Isolt flew out the door. Harry realised that he didn’t worry about Isolt anymore. That he either didn’t feel the need to, or the want to, and that when he got home, she’ll be there.
The small idea that planted in his brain had finally taken root as he waved at Lara. Lara smiled and waved back, then continued doing her duties.
The wooden stairs were beautiful. The third step had a creak that sounded like a cry from the Whomping Willow, and it scared Harry half to death. The handrails were simple yet elegant. The best thing was there was no cupboard underneath the stairs. It seemed to be taken off and destroyed.
Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry, waiting for him to come along. Harry looked at Lara waving off customers as they left. The idea started to come back.
But when it came to the reception, that’s when it got hectic. Ginny would recall someone setting off fireworks early, only for Luna to say they actually went off late. It was getting a little confusing.
“Wait, I don’t have keys for the house.” Harry said, feeling his pockets as if it would somehow appear. He didn’t even know what they looked like.
Just as he walked through the gate, the shiver of strong magic ran through him. The wards really were strong. It felt so much like Malfoy, as if he appeared for a split second just then. It was comforting in a way, to feel Malfoy’s magic around him. He spared a moment and wondered how Malfoy was doing.
Nott didn’t reply, but thankfully Neville did. “He does that when he has a ‘spark of inspiration,’ he says.”
There was that darkness though. It sat there in his chest, small, but patiently waiting. For Harry, despite loving the sight, was jealous of the old Harry. The Harry that could see a vision and let it come to life as wonderfully as this. Harry now felt like if he tried, he’d fail over and over again.
Luna smiled gratefully at him, and moved over to Ginny. Harry started walking around the house. He checked the kitchens, the bathrooms, all the rooms inside but Ron wasn’t there.
The scene replayed over and over again. Harry picked out new things here and there through the graininess of the photos. Like the snitch that flew behind them all just before the flash, or how Luna’s drink sloshed out of her cup, the way Nott and Neville were holding hands, and how Goyle had his arm around Neville. Harry didn’t know how long he stared at it, watching this memory over and over again.
The wards wouldn’t let any strangers in, and Harry knew, or at least trusted, his currently unknown friends not to show up unannounced when Malfoy wasn’t here. So when he walked into the living room and saw Ron and Hermione waiting patiently for him, he had half a mind to walk right back to his office.
Harry grabbed his wallet and paid while his friends got their food. They decided not to walk back to Malfoy’s shop yet when they saw two more overly energetic kids enter.
“It is! Don’t get us wrong, we’re so happy for you and the rate of your recovery since but…” Hermione trailed off, and glanced at Ron for support.
As he enters the Great Hall, a wave of memories hit him. It wasn’t new memories, no, it was memories of a battle, of a body falling on the other side of his wand, of bodies covered and grieving people over them. But it was also laughter, and friends at a table, food between them, it was staring contests across the hall with a blonde with grey eyes, and a hint of uncertainty and suspicion.
He looked around and saw Ron and Hermione sitting together, looking over the room. It didn’t seem like they were speaking. Then Ron’s eyes landed on Harry, and he beckoned him over.
Through and through there were inconsistencies and confusion. The only definite was that she was missing, and to this day, no traces, magical or not, have been found to close the case.
Harry hugged Hace tightly, trying not to scare him off or make him regret accepting him, but he put his entire heart into the hug. Hoping that Hace could understand the amount of sadness Harry had in his heart for this creature.
“Harry, Molly came today. They’ve heard you’re back from St Mungo’s. She planned a celebration in two weeks.” Malfoy sighed and rubbed his face tiredly. “Actually, she wanted to make it Friday but I told her you’re still recovering.”
It’s no wonder that Harry is still there in the office, right now, reading the journal of newspaper clippings that he could probably recite word for word perfectly. Window open as usual, and the old inkwells, quills, and broken muggle pens kept in his desk drawer for safe-keeping.
“It’s lunch time. Just thought we should all go out since our free time synced up for longer than an hour.” Hermione said with a smile.
After all, Harry decided he wasn’t going to pretend to be other Harry to Malfoy at this point, right?
Despite not caring, he walked through the kitchen and the living room just to be sure. He almost decided to check the rooms upstairs until a note on the kitchen counter caught his attention. Harry picked it up and read it.
Harry looked down at his shirt, and saw the deep dried stains of the inkwell he exploded earlier. He cursed internally, but left it. He’d spell it clean later. Harry didn’t notice the shared glance between Pansy and Blaise.
He just shook his head, and sat down on the free seat beside Neville. Neville greeted him with a smile that Harry returned.
“Harry,” Malfoy says, stepping closer to Harry. The first movement from him for a long time. “It’s still you.”
Harry went through the floo first. The flames of international floo smelt slightly more like woodfire than usual, and it had a darker tinge to their colour. But Harry didn’t care to notice, because Malfoy was still waving at him, a bright smile on his face.
Harry would’ve elbowed him for that, but he was too in shock. The image of the unknown Harry was fading away to something more real, more tangible. It looked more like him now.
His hands were shaking. In fact, his whole body was. He’d said it. Overcome by so much, too much, he’d told one of the very few people he didn’t want to.
Harry turned to face the voice, and almost jumped at the surprise. Lavender Brown was smiling up at him welcomingly.
it’s used.” She pointed to another drawn insect pair of wings. “Why can’t we use the lacewing fly in a laughing potion? Why does it have to be billywig? What is the main component, structure or chemical wise, that is so crucial? Why the entire insect instead of that one piece? Don’t even get me started on the theoretical ideas for potion improvements.”
Harry then looked at the backyard door, and went to it. He was about to open it when he heard Malfoy’s voice.
Despite the shop being within arms reach, he stopped. Slowly, he walked into the shadows beside the store and just sat there, hidden from the crowds walking along the street.
“You hid these from me? When were you gonna tell me? There’s three whole boxes filled with photos and you didn’t bother telling me? What the FUCK is wrong with you?” Harry’s voice boomed, and even seconds after he finished the house still shook.
The spell didn’t last more than a minute which Harry was eternally grateful for. He watched as Tina wrote studiously on the papers in her clipboard. When she finished, she looked back to Harry and sat down on the spare seat.
He didn’t miss the pair of twins that started a whisper of a betting pool. It was so jarringly similar to a pair of redheaded twins that were no more. But he watched as the twin girls, one wearing green robes, the other wearing red, discussed their own bets.
“Anyway, I’ve been thinking,” Harry started. “I should take Teddy back to the park near my house, maybe he’ll see his friends there again. I think he’d appreciate it, it’s been a while since we all went there.”
She finally smiled properly this time, and looked up at the lake. “I think I’m doing quite well in the other subjects, like herbology. Professor Longbottom is kind enough to give extra credit lessons whenever he’s free, and Defense is such a fun subject…”
and ran for the door. Harry caught him by the wrist and pulled him back. “Why are you lying? Why won’t you let yourself be loved?”
Realization struck like lightning. Peeves had magically glued Malfoy to Harry and they were conjoined at the hip all the way down to their knees. All thoughts about quidditch left as quickly as they had come as Harry tried to get up from the ground. He struggled for a moment before glaring at Malfoy who thankfully got the idea and scrambled to get up with him. The anger they felt transferred onto its new victim who was still cackling madly as he hopped around them.
”Please, you wish you had a fabulous arse like mine.” Harry retorted simply and the hall erupted into laughter. Harry heard two Hufflepuff girls whisper that Malfoy did, in fact, have a nice bum and therefore Harry Potter was wrong about that.
, he asked and a third finger joined the others, spreading him wider and fucking him deeper. It was too much. It was too good. His fingers scraped at the wall in front of him and he faintly heard the sound of voices though the shower’s privacy charms.
”Malfoy?” His voice was tired and because his cheek magically bound to someone else’s, it sounded muffled.
When they woke up the next morning, it was still early for a Sunday morning. They were wrapped in each other’s arms on the cold tile floor of the eighth year lavatory. The spell must had worn off in the hours prior while they slept. Harry dragged Draco by the arm to one of the private shower stalls and turned on the water. They were still both butt naked since the night before.
Something Harry didn’t know. Harry knew almost all there was to know about Draco Malfoy and he couldn’t help but be annoyed that there was something unknown to him.
“Malfoy. I want-mmm. I want you to fuck me.” It was all he’d thought of since the blond had mentioned it earlier and he wanted, no needed, to know what it felt like.
Malfoy shifted beneath him and rolled back onto his back. When he realized the situation he was in, he let out a strange yell and cursed under his breath. The rest of the boys in the dorm had waken up now and were looking at them curiously.
Neville ended up helping to get the pair back to the infirmary while the others went on about their day. When they walked by the girls in the common room, Harry felt his cheek and the one stuck to his heat from embarrassment. This time, when they managed to find Peeves, he had been hiding in a dungeon wall. He cackled at the two boys, still dressed in their pyjamas and thankfully removed them from each other.
”Your friends are a pain, Potter.” Malfoy had said as he purposely moved to forwards towards his work, pulling Harry back and away from his own.
Soon both boys were knocking into each other trying to get the snitch, hands stretched out towards it and trying desperately to reach it before the other. The stands wizzes passed them faster than ever and bludgers trailed behind them.
Harry’s hand was moving swiftly up and down his length and his thumb was sliding over the tip. It felt
“This is your fault. If you hadn’t took the snitch away from me, we would never have been in this situation.” Malfoy pulled his top half away from Harry in the water and crossed his arms over his chest, glaring.
Word had travelled fast and soon most of school were getting bundled up on a cold November evening to go witness the legendary battle that was to take place on the quidditch pitch. Even Peeves, the school poltergeist had made an appearance to cheer on whoever would lose. Harry stood at the foot of the stands with Malfoy at his side. Both were holding their brooms and dressed in their best quidditch robes, determined
“Now, Peeves.” Professor Flitwick’s high pitched voice cut in. Peeves grumbled but did as told and the two eighth year boys were detached with another orange flare of magic. Harry didn’t move right away but, as soon as the orange glow dimmed, Malfoy scrambled up and to the other side of the now large bed, away from Harry. Harry shivered at the loss of the warm body beside him, suddenly feeling very cold.
”Did you feel his dong, Harry? Was it teeny? Or was it big like his ego?” They giggled at each other before Harry replied that he simply did not know. Their smiles wiped off their pace, they pouted, “You're no fun.”
”Oh, but I would!” He cackled and sent them floating across the bath toward each other glueing them together by their hips. Their very naked hips. Peeves popped out of the room after one last cackle and left the two boys to fend for themselves.
the way Draco moved his hips. He knew now why things with Ginny hadn’t worked out. Why they couldn’t ever work out.
“Is that a rhetorical question?” Malfoy answered the red-head in Harry’s place. He then proceeded to try and get up from the awkward position on the floor. He successfully managed, with the help of Harry of course, but not before complaining about the situation and that his neck was hurting.
”Merlin, Potter, you’re so tight.” He whispered. His fingers had breached the tight ring muscle and into Harry’s warmth. This was so wrong, but the brunet groaned into his shoulder and all thoughts of right or wrong vanished. He didn’t give a shit. All he knew was that this was
“You’re a disgrace!” The former patriarch of the Malfoy family shouted, “You bring shame to this family. You soil our name!” Harry shot a stinging hex that sent him tumbling slightly, but the seething voice continued, “How dare you associate the Malfoy lineage with such perversions?”
With his momentary distraction over with, Harry turned back to his tedious work. After about another thirty essays about the uses and counters of a simple knockback jinx, he abandoned his corrections and made his way down for lunch where Neville was waiting for him.
It was perfectly normal to have a morning wood but it was another thing entirely to have it pressed up against someone else. Harry wanted to tell Malfoy to just ignore it and that whether he liked it or not they still had to make it up the stairs but his mouth had stopped working.
The spell didn’t have the desired effect. Malfoy was far from laughing and he couldn’t harm the boggart even if he tried in his current state of mind. Harry cast his own spell from where he stood behind him.
”The giant squid.” Harry cut in from his spot in the room. He was desperately trying to force his facial muscle to
The spell hadn’t worn off yet when Neville was rushed in covered in what looked like giant hickeys. Madam Pomfrey practically ran to greet him and started casting analysis spells.
He could here someone calling after him from across the hall as he speed-walked to his classroom. Already late for his next lesson, he could spare no time for the young girl who was most likely going to ask him about an upcoming homework or exam or quidditch match. He called over his shoulder, asking her to come after class when he wasn’t running around the school. Her calls just got more frantic, however, sounding more like the red phoenix he’d known in his earlier years than a student resident of Hogwarts.
“She’s not my girlfriend!” He bit back, defensively. Harry blew hot air onto his ear, enjoying the uncomfortable squirm he got in response from the blond who refused to pull back and admit defeat.
Harry pulled back and wiped the tears off Draco’s face with both his hand before pulling him back into a kiss by his hair, “I love you, Malfoy.” He mumbled into the kiss. Draco didn’t respond, he deepened the kiss and for now that was enough for Harry.
”Harry! Oh, Merlin... so good. Don’t..ah..stop!” Draco bit down on his shoulder, hard, and shuddered violently against him. Harry joined him barely seconds later, spilling into his pants as he dug his hands into Draco’s pants to put him close and squeezing his bare bottom.
Needless to say, Harry went to bed in a grumpy mood that evening. Hermione had been trying to set him up with a few witches, but he just wasn’t interested in any of them. Sure they were nice, but Harry wanted what she and Ron had. “Bonds like the one Ron and I have didn’t form on the first date, Harry.” She’d told him countless times that if he just put in the effort and the time, he would find someone. He just didn’t have the time. He was fine, he was happy, even.
Malfoy lunged at Peeves with a loud growl, dragging himself and Harry back down to the ground. Harry let out an undignified yelp as he fell face first into the grass. He used the arm farthest from the blond to pull himself off the ground and smacked him on the back of the head with the other. Draco turned to glare at him and stuck him with a half-assed stinging hex.
Nobody could find Peeves that day and so the pair had to wait in the infirmary for four hours before the spell faded away. Hermione, the bright witch that she was, conjured two backless chaired so they could still manage to do their school work during this time.
Draco was still half asleep and barely registered what was happening over the painful throbbing of his head. Harry handed him a small vial of blue liquid.
”I shouldn’t... this isn’t right.” The pale boy said, but his body contradicted his words as he leaned into the touch. They couldn’t do much but push against each other in this position but it was all that was necessary to bring the two over the edge a little more than five minutes later, rutting frantically against each other beneath the surface of the water. Both too drunk to care what consequences there could be afterwards.
Of course, if they kept going, Harry would practically be frotting against him and any teenage boy knew that it was every harder to ignore
“Ms. Jordan, if you don’t mind, I would like to speak to you sometime after class. I think I may have found something for you.” She nodded and said she would come by his classroom before lunch.
“By the looks of you, they didn’t find Peeves last night. Am I right?” Luna asked. Draco just nodded and made his way up the stairs to get dressed. When he got down, Harry was being questioned by the twins.
“What’s in it for me?” Draco said with defiance before he turned to sneer in Harry’s general direction, “Potter wouldn’t stand a chance anyhow.”
Lucius Malfoy was standing in front of his son, wand out and casting killing curses left and right. The youngest Malfoy was curled in a ball on the floor, crying but very much alive despite the lethal spells hitting his side. Harry tried to disarm the man, first, knowing it probably wouldn’t do much to help the situation. Lucius Malfoy had been dead for the last seven years. Dead dead, not Tom Riddle dead.
He decided to stop thinking of such things. He turned onto his side and faced the warm flames of the fire across the room. He wondered what the boggart would have shown him had he stepped in front of Draco earlier. Voldemort, death, small cupboards, maybe. Loneliness? His thoughts all swirled back to his previous problem. With a start he sat up in bed and summoned a sleeping draught he’d gotten from George. The speed at which his brain was spewing ideas about dying alone and never finding someone to share a home with was enough to make him dizzy and he quickly downed the potion. He felt his fingers tingle and his thoughts trickled to a stop.
“Party tonight guys, don’t forget!” It had become a new tradition of sorts that every so often, the eighth years all got together to have a hot tub party in the eighth year lavatory. Alcohol was snuck in through the newly functional room of requirement and games were to be had in the giant tub. They’d played a competitive game of pool volleyball on night with loads and loads of foam filling the space.
“Well, I think there is a certain kind of healer that you may have overlooked.” He stood and went to rummage through his desk, “I’ve read an article about a new decision of healer that specializes in emergency cases like in the muggle world. I can’t seem to find it. Regardless, these healers go to different places to help aurors bring gravely injured people into their care. You would get a lot of field work, like an auror, without working with criminals and helping those in need. I think it would be a good fit for you, Ms. Jordan.” He looked at her and smirked, “If I’d known you could be so good at handling emergency situations like before, I would have thought of this earlier.”
Draco, who had taken dance lessons since he’d been very young, would normally have no difficulty following a simple movement but everything about the boy in front of him was unpredictable and whereas that usually brought him a thrill, it was currently nothing short of infuriating. All his energy was devoted to following Harry’s mouvements and willing his breathing to stay even as the boy’s decidedly impressive (almost as impressive as his own) length pressed up against his. Infuriating. Every time their legs moved, pleasure coursed through his body and they were far from reaching their destination, meaning he would have to endure the endless rubbing for at least another five minutes.
“The fight wasn’t between Malfoy and I.” Even though he spoke the truth, his tone was defensive. He sighed, “Rumours sure do get twisted around here.”
”Harry you look like you spent the night with a Vampire” Padma said, gesturing at the hickeys on his neck, “Who’s the girl?” Harry had avoided the question every time it had arose that night and he did once more.
”This is your fault, Malfoy. Don’t even try to deny it.” Harry said before he received a well-aimed snowball to the side of the head. The familiar thrill of fighting with Draco rushed through him and soon they were shoving snow down their coats and running down the road towards the shrieking shack. When they collapsed in the snow to catch their breath, Harry revealed that it had been him who had traumatized him in third year and they’d talked for a while about their adventures in their past school years.
The students had stopped shouting after the arrival of their professor and Harry could now clearly make out the shouting behind the closed door of the potions professor’s office. A green light flashed through the crack of the door for a moment and Harry didn’t hesitate to cast.
”No.” Harry repeated more firmly. He pulled Draco close by his robes and planted a kiss on his lips. He felt Draco relax a little for a second before he was pushed away.
“I’m jealous of that squid, to be honest.” One Ravenclaw boy had said during one of the following meals, “If I had a chance to get a piece of
They decided not to go to the infirmary. They were drunk, naked, and glued together. The headmistress would have a fit if she saw them like that. Instead the party people officially retired. It was late and no one wanted to stay and help the two unfortunate victims of the poltergeist. They all left the two to fend for themselves. Even Ron and Hermione left for the dormitory.
They got stuck together quite a few times more by Peeves. Once during a potions lesson when Draco had been insulting Harry’s work behind him, a Harry had turned around and slapped him across the face.
Unfortunately, something did happen. The boys barely had time to register Peeves’ approaching laughter before an orange light flashed. Malfoy, who did not seem at all phased by the poltergeist’s gleeful giggles, tried to roll over and straddle Harry to throw a punch. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for Harry, the blond boy couldn’t move from where he was lying next to him, long pale fingers practically cutting through his forearm as he held it down on the ground.
The large oak door that lead to the common room was at the far end of the school near the lake. The spell work that had gone into making the new dorms was rather impressive and every detail of the place had been carefully thought about in order to make the place feel like home to all it’s students. There weren’t any walls in the common room, strange as that may seem, however, the floor was a pale polished wood that contrasted nicely with the dark cabinets and couches in the lounge area. Where the walls should have been, there were powerful architectural charms (that could be compared to large windows) that one could put a hand through without disturbing the magic or meeting any resistance. This made for a truly amazing sight, for on the three walls other than the door’s, you could see straight out onto the grounds of the castle. The first floor was partly below ground level and at this particular spot, the lake reached the edges of the castle and surrounded their common room. The magical barriers prevented the lake’s water from coming through. Half of the view was split horizontally by the waters surface and at such a depth, the water looked a wonderful shade of turquoise. For the first time in most of the young student’s lives, they could see the giant squid look at them as well as many other magical lake creatures and plants.
He motioned for Alyssa to stay behind and crossed the threshold into the small office. It took a few moments for his mind to comprehend what exactly he was facing. Even after closing the door behind him to stop the curious gaze of the horde of students on the other side, he couldn’t comprehend just what he was looking at.
He didn’t wait for a reply before climbing up the stairs to his dormitory and sitting down on his bed to get his towel and pjs. He went back down the stairs toward the common room, not failing to notice that the conversation had died down, and out into the hallway. The eighth year lavatory was just across the hall and it was practically an exact replica of the prefects’ bathroom. Showers were on the far wall and had privacy charms surrounding them and the center of the room was dedicated to a huge bath much like the one he’d visited in his fourth year.
"So when will Professor Snape be meeting with me? Will be come get me or will I go to his office?" Harry asked, before flinching at a low voice behind him.
He was a freak, and freaks didn't deserve anything. Sighing, Harry couldn't help but think the reason being gay was such a bad thing for him is because of the wizarding world.
That shrugging was so frustrating! This wasn't something Harry could just brush off, and Snape knew that better than anyone. He forced his anger to lessen at those wretched Dursleys. Sighing, Snape knew he had to ask the question he was required to ask for every abused student. He already had a feeling he wouldn't like the response. "Were you ever sexually abused?"
As Snape was walking over to the couch, he noticed Harry's wince and his eyes widened just a fraction. Nope, Potter wasn't injured. The boy was probably doing it for attention. Mentally Snape went over the points he would have to bring up in the conversation before sitting down.
Harry sighed, unsure of how to explain his eating habits. He shrugged before grabbing a serving of chicken and mashed potatoes. He only managed to finish about a fourth of it before everyone was dismissed.
Harry didn't want Draco to (just) kiss him silly, every time he saw Draco he wanted more. He wanted to make breakfast together in the morning. He wanted to lay with him as a lover. He wanted to be greeted with a sloppy morning breath kiss.
Harry heard gasps all over the great hall, and took this as a sign to start walking towards the Slytherin table. Dumbledore hurried the next student up, probably in hopes to cover up his failed plan, whatever it was.
Of course, good things never stay, and the weight of the whole world came crashing down onto Harry's shoulders. The smile he had on his face was wiped off, thoughts already running through his head about what Voldemorts next move could be. Surrendering to the lethargic feeling, Harry got up and got ready as quietly as possible so not to disturb his room mate.
"Well Mr.Potter, it would appear you are meeting with me right now. Follow me to the hospital wing for your mandatory physical. Hopefully you can follow me better than you can follow directions." Snape said with a grim smile on his face.
"Stupid Potter! I bet even if your parents were alive they would still leave you with that muggle family!"
Draco's gonna be a mother hen like literally and then Drarry will hit you in the face like it always does
"What should we do? On the one hand now that Severus knows he could not give me detention, but on the other hand if the potion hurts a student and I don't get detention for that then Severus will be seen as incompetent. And a lot of people trust Dumbledore." Mulling over Draco's words for a few minutes, Theo came up with an idea.
Since Harry was sat next to Draco, he asked if Draco could help him with the potions assignment. As Draco was explaining to him the properties and uses of lacewing flies and angel trumpet, Harry couldn't help but examine Draco's face. He had very strong facial features, and his eyes were a piercing color.
Let it be said that Hermione had very good self preservation instincts. Although she viewed everyone as neutrally as she could, she trusted her gut feeling. She knew for a fact that her gut had never been wrong. She had that feeling with Quirrel, then with Lockhart, the tournament, and Ron's rat, now known as Pettigrew.
Hey guys I'm back from the trip! A lot happens in this chapter so sorry if it's too much plot in one chapter but... yeah
And Hermione...was pretty great. She's extremely smart, and kind and charismatic. But Harry knew that she valued academics over everything else. Not to say she isn't a good friend, because she is. But, as soon as Harry does better than her in school, Harry knows he'll become competition instead of friend. Harry couldn't blame her, one couldn't let personal relationships get in the way of achieving a goal.
As they entered the great hall, Harry immediately started walking in the direction of the Slytherin table before remembering he was in Slytherin. Taking a seat between Draco and Blaise, Harry looked around, ignoring the glares the Gryffindor table sent him. He was not looking forward to mail today. Harry was willing to bet all the money in his vault that the headline in the Daily Prophet will be "The boy who live is the next dark lord!"
Harry decided not to mention the dreams about Draco leaving. He figured if Draco reacted badly to the torture, then his reaction to that would be really bad. "Something has been bothering ever since Hermione told of what she heard. What is it?" Snape questioned, using his keen observation skills.
Harry grinned when Draco (finally, it had taken forever) sat up and got out of bed. It was so nice to have someone to talk to, and especially nice to have someone who didn't care about who Harry was. To Draco, he was just Harry, not the boy who lived.
They couldn't know that he was dirty, that he was filthy, that he didn't deserve to be touched, or enjoy pleasure.
As soon as they got back to their room, Draco started questioning Harry, and vice versa. "Why did you say yes to the dinner? Do you know what you're getting into?" If Harry was put off by the questions being thrown towards him, he didn't show it.
After everything had been clarified and everyone had been clued in on their role in the plan, everyone parted ways except for Harry and Draco, obviously, and Snape, who chose to stay behind.
Yes, he was gay. Even though Harry heard that it wasn't a bad thing to be different, all he associated with that word was bad connotations. During the summer of third year, he had his first crush, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had happened to pass by them kissing. When he got home, the Dursleys made sure he knew that he was a freak. Harry shivered, that was the first sexual experience he ever had. Uncle Vernon decided that if he liked taking it up the ass so much then...Harry felt bile rise up in his throat, and managed to make it to the toilet before throwing up.
Of course, everything had changed so much since then. Quickly, she splashed water on her face and tried to control her breathing. Running really was not her strong suit. After she dried her face, she took a few deep breaths before walking out of the loo. The hallways were now flooded with people going to their first class. She absolutely had to find Draco and Harry before potions, but that wouldn't be too difficult.
After they got ready, Harry took a deep breath, before walking out and taking the floo with Blaise and Draco.
Harry grinned. "Draco is such a mom it is unbelievable!" Letting out a small giggle, Harry continued, taking on a more serious tone. "Yes, I was sorted into Slytherin. Originally I thought everyone would dislike me and follow the dark lord, but I was proven wrong and have since then changed my views. I couldn't ask for a better room mate or for better friends."
Patting his back, Blaise responded to Draco, "You already know my answer. Your parents are always a pleasure to talk to." Nodding, Draco quickly shoveled another bite of food into his mouth. He was thankful that Blaise was always there to support him.
When they arrived at the common room, Harry led the way to him and Draco's room. It was very cramped, but everyone managed to find a place to sit. Pansy looked around the room and felt like they were forgetting something. "Should I go get Professor Snape? You said you also wanted to tell him right?" Nodding, Hermione smiled at her.
People died because of him. He was weak, worthless, just a weapon. If his feeling didn't matter, then no one should care about him either.
"Harry, the belongings and clothes I saw in your room, are those all you have?" Snape asked, bringing up something that had gone to the back of his mind until now. Snape saw Harry nod his head in response, and resolved to do something.
Wrapping a towel around his (thin) waist, Harry started searching for his robes. He was not looking forward to breakfast.
When Draco opened his eyes again, it was because Harry was poking him and telling him to wake up. Lightly pushing Harry away, Draco sat up grumbling and groaning about how it was too early.
Harry walked over to the common room that had become his home in the last few days, and waited for everyone else to get ready. Even though it was the beginning of the year, Harry was already thinking about what would happen this summer. Would he get sent back to the Dursleys? If not, where would he go? He just seemed to attract danger everywhere he went, and in the process hurt the people he cared about.
His father wanted him to join the inner circle of the man who wanted to kill his roommate. Draco personally didn't want to join the mans circle, or even fight in the war. He sighed, he would figure it out.
"Guys, I just want to hear what she has to say. I know you are all here to protect me, which I appreciate, but I am capable of protecting myself. I just want to hear her out, and I'll be right where you can see me."
"Well alright, but I better see that potion vial empty by the time we go back to the common room." Draco said, leaving no room for suggestion.
His eyes rolled just at the thought, but he flinched back when food appeared in front of him. No matter how long he had been at Hogwarts, he would never get used to the amount of food in front of him. Going from one meal every few days to platters upon platters of food for every meal was always rough.
Theo shook his head. "Only you Pansy. You forget socks almost daily but somehow remember Snape isn't here." Everyone in the room could hear the affection in his voice that only a best friend could have. Getting up, Pansy ran to Snape's office. Fortunately Snape was sitting in his office.
Draco was shocked. Did Potter just joke so casually about his life situation? And what was so horrible about his muggle relatives (besides the fact that they were muggles)? The flinch did not go unnoticed by Draco,  and he was a little impressed by how quickly Potter schooled his expression.
Leading Harry inside, Draco closed the door and sat down on the ground. Harry buried his head in Draco's shoulder, his tears soaking up Draco's shirt. "Shh, just let it out. It's okay to cry, that Gryffindor was lying anyways. Shh." Harry just sat there sobbing. He tried to stop crying, but once he started it was impossible to stop. It was like a weight was slowly lifting off his chest. Once he was done, he muttered a quiet "Sorry" at Draco, who just shook his head and kept on petting his head.
Yawning, Harry turned around to get his clothes on. In the middle of picking his outfit, Draco decided to give Harry his two cents. "You should really go to Snape about your nightmares you know, you haven't slept well in a while."
"Well before, like I said, Aunt Petunia would hit me with a frying pan, and Uncle Vernon would occasionally slap me across the face every once in a while, but other than that and missing meals I was fine. After I got the letter...if I did even the smallest thing wrong Aunt Petunia would turn the heat up high and hold my hand on the frying pan. Most of the time Uncle Vernon will just beat me, but if I'm especially bad he'll get out the belt." Harry said, shrugging again.
Immediately scooching forward Harry wiped his sweaty palms on his pants and started tapping his foot, his eyes darting around the room. Living your whole life with a mass murderer trying to kill you made you a bit paranoid. Harry felt his heartbeat speed up as Snape sat down in front of him.
He supposed he would have to account for that now. For all the bullshit he preached about the power of love, he didn't think about how blinding it actually was. Dumbledore faintly remembered what love felt like.
"Yes." Harry muttered quietly, but Snape could hear it if he strained his ears. He sighed before looking at Harry with respect. No one could go through something like that without earning Snapes utmost respect.
They started working on the essay together, and about halfway through Harry yawned, and by habit leaned his head on Draco's shoulder. He realized what he did, and was going to jump up, run to his room, and hide forever but then Draco pushed his head back down.
hullo -for clarification im making this story around the beginning of 6th year, but Harry never did the whole occlumency thing in 5th year and also draco isnt supposed to kill dumbledore and obviously snape isnt going to kill dumbledore
"Yeah, it was my room until I was eleven." Harry said nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. He didn't see what the big deal was. "Anyways, it wasn't that bad until I got my Hogwarts letter. When I found out I was a wizard they started giving me an excessive amount of chores, and the punishments got worse."
Silently, Snape gave Harry the potions to drink, and applied salve onto his back. "These scars won't go away, but they will fade over time. I want you to continue taking these potions with every meal, and ask someone to help you apply the salve onto your back once a day. I understand you may be feeling overwhelmed, so I will allow you to go back to your room, but we will talk about this at one point. Dismissed."
"It seems you got an O in defense against the dark arts, transfiguration, care of magical creatures, and" Snape's eyebrows rose up to his head when he saw what other class Harry got an O in. He was the only student besides Granger to get an O in this class. "history of magic. Very commendable Mr. Potter, perhaps you have some brains after all. You got an E.E in divination and potions. I hope you will keep up the good work. If you have any trouble feel free to ask any of the 7th years and me. You have one of the greatest O.W.L scores I have ever seen."
When Harry was washing his hair, he thought about his relationship with Draco. Every time Harry saw Draco, his heart beat faster and butterflies flew around his stomach. Was this what having a real friend felt like? Or was this what having a crush felt like?
In this chapter people find out about the abuse. (Also I have no idea what I'm doing with the chapter titles)
As he was getting dressed, Harry was hit with a deep tiredness. It slammed into him so fast that he stumbled. He was overwhelmed with the feeling that he couldn't move. Everything felt so heavy that he just wanted to lay in bed and never get up. He was worthless, no one cared about him, it wouldn't make a difference if he just fell asleep and never woke up.
Frowning, Harry corrected her. "Harry. If we are going to be in the same house we should at least call each other by our names." Blaise smiled. "Okay then Harry, why are you not eating anything?"
The two had definitely drifted after Harry got sorted into Slytherin. Although she didn't like Ron because of his rudeness towards her and Harry, they were still somewhat friends. As a friend of Ron, she knew that he was one of the most naive people on the planet. Ron was someone who had utmost trust in authority, which made him easy to manipulate. Being manipulated was an uncomfortable experience, and Dumbledore was a master at it.
"Erm..Hello?" Harry said, very confused. In fact, when Harry had taken his seat at the Slytherin table he fully expected everyone to ignore him. Why would they want to talk to him anyways?
"It's been absolutely brilliant Hermione!" Harry said, a genuine smile appearing on his face. "And they treat you well? You're happy?" Harry nodded enthusiastically. "They are like my family Hermione. I hope you can understand that?"
Of course Draco, being the mother hen that he is, noticed. Grabbing a little bit of everything, Draco put in on Harry's plate, unaware of the amused glances everyone else at the table were sending him. "You will finish what is on this plate, alright Harry?" Draco said, with his patented mom glare. Blaise grinned at them, eyes glittering with silent laughter. "I think you managed the impossible feat of rendering Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy speechless."
Draco nodded at her, giving her a rare smile. Harry watched this exchange with a fondness he could not explain. The fact that two of his closest precious people were getting along made his heart warm. As soon as Harry looked at Hermione he frowned. She looked really shaken up by what she heard, which he knew was not an easy thing to do. They started walking together to the Slytherin common room in comfortable silence.
Something was wrong. Call it a sixth sense or something, but today felt like a day where something big was going to happen. Draco just shrugged, and made a note to keep an eye on his room mate.
Draco moved to stand up, but was stopped by a hand grabbing his shirt. "Please don't leave. I-I'm scared." Draco felt his heart shatter into pieces.
Who hated the Slytherins more than the Gryffindors. Especially because young Ron has shown to have been harboring some anger towards mister Potter.
Theo nodded, before moving forward to talk with Daphne Greengrass. (Harry had the sneaking suspicion that they did more than just 'talk' after class). Draco started talking with Harry. It was just about some stupid potions assignment, but Harry couldn't take his eyes off Draco's face. It was so angular and handsome. Unbeknownst to them, Blaise and Pansy noticed the love struck look on both the boys faces, and shared a knowing glance with each other.
While they were eating, a certain Gryffindor had started making her way towards the Slytherin table, and tapped Harry's back once. Harry flinched and immediately turned around to see Hermione. Draco and Blaise glared, but Hermione just wasn't affected. "Harry, can I talk to you?" Immediately, she was met with a chorus of "no's" which Harry soon silenced.
Snape barged in to get Harry, and treat his injuries. But as soon as Snape saw the sight in front of him, the ice around his heart melted a little bit, and he felt his lips curl up in an imitation of a smile.
When Harry woke up again, it was to Draco concernedly shaking his shoulder. Blearily opening his eyes, Harry waited until his vision focused before responding. "I'm up, I'm up!" Draco rolled his eyes before pulling Harry out of his bed.
After he was done, Harry looked up just in time to catch Draco putting more food on his plate. "Draco, I-that's too much food to waste on me."
Now though, she felt that feeling every time she looked at Dumbledore. He had always rubbed her the wrong way. The way his face would change when he thought no one was looking just reinforced that Dumbledore could not be trusted. You can always tell when someone has something to hide, and Dumbledore was a man of many secrets. She was also concerned, not for herself, but for Harry.
Meanwhile, Harry arrived at potions, taking a seat next to Draco. Sadly, it was double potions with the Gryffindors, so of course there were many insults being thrown. All of which stopped when Snape walked in.
Hermione frowned. "I don't like this anymore than you do Draco. I don't want to see Harry get hurt, but like you said Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards. We can't just go accusing people of things without any evidence at all. " Harry smiled thankfully at Hermione.
Peeking her head a little bit around the wall, she focused in on their conversation and blocked out the white noise of the castle.
There were bruises flowering along Harry's front, and Snape also caught sight of what looked to be third degree burns and some thin shallow slices, that looked like they came from a knife. Snape was disturbed by how thin the boy was, and if he didn't know any better he would have thought the boy was in first year. Harry's ribs were protruding out, and his collarbones were sharply sticking out. Potters back was just...Snape shuddered. Along with bruises and burns, there were many deep welts that quite obviously came from a whip and a belt. What was the most disturbing though, were the words FREAK carved into Harry's back.
Looking confused, Harry questioned Snape. "Draco?" Snape shook his head and snorted. "You will soon learn that boy is more of a mother hen than Molly Weasley."
After his breathing evened out, Harry took a hesitant seat on the stool that was set in front of Snape. "You are aware of why you are here, correct? I need to treat your injuries, so if you could please take off your shirt it would make my job much easier."
Harry snorted, and his fellow Gryffindor housemates asked him why he was still a virgin. He wasn't but they couldn't know that.
Taking a sip of her drink, Narcissa continued the discussion. "Draco, I never knew you were such a mother hen. Harry, I heard you were sorted into Slytherin?" She said, raising her eyebrows.
The walk to Snape's office was totally silent. Snape was walking with his normal confidence, and Harry was freaking out. He was having trouble breathing, it felt like there was a weight stuck in his chest that never moved. If Snape noticed anything wrong, he didn't show it. Harry envied him, how could he keep such a straight face? It wasn't fair, just like the rest of his fucking life.
And Harry had seen first hand what kind of house Slytherin was. No matter how much of a bad reputation they had, Slytherins stuck up for each other, which is more than Harry could say about Gryffindor. In Gryffindor, the way they treated Harry all was dependent on whatever the Daily Prophet said that year. He was also starting to get why Snape never took points away from Slytherin, although he still thought it was a little unfair, he understood the logic behind it.
"Mr. Potter, let us first talk about your grades. Keep in mind that in here I am not your professor, think of me more like a parent. My goal is not to scare or patronize you, I just want to make sure you are doing well academically." He said, before using all of his occlumecy training to clear his mind. This wasn't Potter, just another one of his snakes. Taking a deep breath, Snape resumed the conversation.
Dinner continued in a pleasant manner, with the occasional small talk here and there. Soon, it came to an end. Harry never thought he would be sad to have to leave a dinner with the Malfoy family, but he was. They treated him like he was part of their family, and Harry found himself actually enjoying the conversation he had with them. He was brought out of his stupor by Lucius. "Harry, tonight has shown that you are an intelligent, thoughtful and kind friend. You are always welcome here."
After that, breakfast went on without further incident. As they were leaving, Snape stopped by Harry's seat before they left. "Potter, I expect you to be at my quarters at noon sharp, understand?" Muttering a quiet yes, Harry avoided eye contact and moved to stand next to Draco.
Yes, Dumbledore had many issues with the resorting. Firstly, Harry was not supposed to be in Slytherin in the first place, when he heard that Harry was he almost wanted to burn that blasted hat. Secondly, he did not expect Harry to become friends with the Slytherins, much less fall in love with one.
Sighing, Hermione frowned. "How has Slytherin been?" She didn't like Slytherin, but recently she came to realize that if not all Gryffindors are arrogant then obviously not all Slytherins are evil. It seemed like Harry was happier.
Sighing, Harry frowned. He trusted Draco, but he didn't know how to explain that over the summer he got one meal every three days (if he was lucky) and a normal serving was too much to finish.
Startled, Harry twisted himself around so he could glare at Draco. "You were awake? Why didn't you tell me they were bothering you sooner. I would have put up a silencing charm."
Following Draco, Harry questioned him. "Why are you acting nice towards me?" Draco sighed, realizing he would have to teach Harry the art of subtlety.
Okay so literally finals have taken over my life so sorry for not updating, can someone suggest some plot because I have no idea where to go with this story??
Harry was going to say more, but was interrupted by Draco standing in the doorway. "Not that I don't appreciate you showing Harry your room, but he kind of needs to unpack and meet with Professor Snape." Draco said, smirking. "I'm assuming I am sharing the room with you? Lead the way roomie! Thanks Theo!" Harry said quickly, before rushing to meet up with Draco.
Pansy shook her head. "Dumbledore has enough power in this school that he can pull a student out of detention."
Harry had been walking and talking with Blaise and Pansy, and Theo had joined in too. They were actually having a decent conversation. Pansy had asked what Professor Snape said, and Harry just mentioned vague details. Enough for them to figure out why Harry was with Snape for so long, but not enough that they knew everything.
Rolling his eyes, Draco continued eating as if nothing had happened, while Harry hesitantly started to dig into his meal.
Gaping at his room, Harry slowly walked in. It was so much bigger than his room at the Dursleys, but that wasn't saying much. Harry unpacked what little belongings he had, before trying to talk with Draco.
To say Harry was struggling was an understatement. He had spent his whole life living like this, and it was just so foreign to have someone concerned for him. To Harry this was a normal routine at the Dursleys, but apparently it wasn't normal to be beaten within an inch of your life every time you go home.
Knocking, Pansy was let in. "What do you need?" To most students Snape's voice would have sounded cold and unconcerning, but his snakes knew different. "Could you come to Draco and Harry's room. Its extremely important."
Gasping, Harry woke up from his nightmare. He looked over to see if Draco was awake, and said person was snoring and sprawled across the bed. Harry had never been more thankful for silencing charms in his life.
"Guys!" Immediately, there was silence. Everyone stared at Harry, having never heard him raise voice that loud ever. "Although Hermione has given us some information, thank you Hermione, we still don't know a lot. If there's one thing i've learned over my years of adventure, it's that the worst thing you could do is going into a situation without knowing all the details. Right now we have a good was to get information. If we let this plan happen and I go with Dumbledore then..."
Sighing, Harry slowly took off his shirt, glaring at Snape all the while. He didn't want to show these injuries to anyone. They were just another sign of how weak he was. The amazing boy who lived, who couldn't even stand up to a group of stupid muggles that sat in front of the TV all day. That heavy feeling from earlier started coming back, and Harry used all his strength to push away that feeling.
Hermione took a deep breath before starting to tell her story. "You guys noticed how during breakfast professor Dumbledore took Ron out of the great hall?" She waited until she saw nods from everyone before continuing. "I decided to follow them out, because to be honest i've always been suspicious of Dumbledore."
While they had started eating, Draco brought up something quite important that involved the people at the table. Yesterday, he had gotten the letter from his parents that served as an invitation. It was the same thing he got every year, but this year was a little different. Every year his parents invited whoever his roommate was, along with Blaise to a dinner at the manor. "So yesterday I got a letter inviting my roommate and Blaise to dinner with my parents." He brought it up very suddenly, and Draco silently berated himself when Harry choked on his food.
Of course, part of that feeling had to do with his friends. He loved them dearly, and that would never go away, but it felt like they were straying away. Ron, bless his naive soul, was jealous of Harry's fame. On the one hand, Harry was quite sad and disappointed that Ron thought Harry would trade anything for fame, as that was just untrue. On the other hand, Harry was grateful that Ron didn't yet realize what special kind of hell hole Harry's life was.
She noticed how Dumbledore would always stare at Harry during meal times, and if it made her uncomfortable she could only imagine how Harry must feel. Not only was she worried about Harry, she was also concerned about Ron.
Eyes widening, Harry quickly got his stuff together and ran out the door. He had totally forgotten about his meeting with Snape! Rushing through the halls, he found his way to Snape's office, sprinting in and throwing a quick slew of apologies to the Professor, much to the latters amusement.
I'm sorry if some people get frustrated with the lack of plot in this chapter, but I felt it was necessary and would further the story in its own way.
Ever since he had gotten sorted into Slytherin, the other Gryffindors have been glaring at him and insulting every chance they get.
Dumbledore was right about one thing, Harry and Draco loved each other, and nothing was going to change that.
Of course, Ron and Hermione got sorted into Gryffindor. Everyone expected that one, considering the fact that they both let the Gryffindor arrogance get to their head. Harry shook his head and let it drop. Sure, Harry expected it, but they had changed so much from the people he met on the train.
In a way, he sort of deserved to go to the Dursleys, considering how many people were hurt because of him. Hearing foot steps, Harry pasted a fake smile onto his face and gave a half-hearted wave towards Draco and Theo, with Blaise and Pansy right behind them. Theo, being the first one to get to Harry, started talking with him. "Thank you for helping me with my snake a few days ago." Harry smiled back at him. "No problem! Hey, we are in the same Charms class right? Could we talk about what we've been learning later?"
The silence went on for a few long minutes, and Draco started tapping his foot. The tension was so thick it couldn't be cut with even the sharpest of knives. Eventually Lucius spoke up, obviously frustrated with the lack of explanation or greeting. "Draco, you never told us this was your new room mate. I would say nice to meet you, but I do believe we have already had the chance to exchange pleasantries. Blaise, a pleasure to see you, as always. Draco," Lucius hesitated before risking a glance at Narcissa, "We are happy you're home. Let us go to the dining hall."
Grinning, Harry walked with his hand in Draco's. He wasn't really sure what they were, but he did know that whatever it was, it was working. Nothing could really put a damper in the glow of happiness surrounding Harry. Once they entered the great hall Harry took a seat at the Slytherin table, greeted by small waves and glances. He really felt like this was his family-his
Startled back to reality, Harry was greeted with platters of food in front of him and Malfoy, Zabini, and Parkinson surrounding him. Zabini and Parkinson were sitting in front of him, and Malfoy had moved to his left.
It was only when Dumbledore walked by that the mood was sobered. Putting a 'fatherly' hand on Harry shoulder (who immediately flinched) Dumbledore whispered a few words into Harry's ear, and much to his chagrin, Draco couldn't hear what Dumbledore was saying. When Dumbledore left Harry with a hard pat on his back, Harry tried his hardest to hold back his wince. He wasn't too sure he succeeded, judging by the murderous expression on the other three Slytherins faces.
They all jumped up in surprise when Harry spoke quietly. "I want to go." Looking at him in shock, Draco just nodded, knowing better than to question him in a place where anyone could overhear their conversation.
"Correct." "So what do you want me to do about it?"    "Although Snape favors his snakes, if one of them were to say...mess up a potion so badly that it would hurt another student, he would have to give them detention."
"Well I dunno, I used to trust Harry now that he's made friends with the slimy snakes, he shouldn't be trusted-at least that's what my mum told me."
Gasping, Hermione quickly ran into the loo before Dumbledore, who was about to turn the corner, could see her. She absolutely had to tell Harry, Draco, and Professor Snape what Dumbledore was planning to do. Shaking her head, she couldn't help but marvel at how blind Ron was. It saddened her, in a way. He was not the same boy she had met on the train. He had changed so much since then.
"This might be stupid, but what if Harry sacrifices Draco's potion before Ron gets to. Then Professor Snape could assign Harry detention with him and could assign Draco detention with Professor Mcgonagall. Then Dumbledore won't have chance to talk with Harry. Of course it's just a short term solution, but it should work."
"Look at me Harry." Slowly, Harry raised his eyes up to Draco's. "Dumbledore's an old fool who doesn't know what he's talking about. You are in love with me, just like I am in love with you. Of course we rely on each other. Even though we rely on each other, I am perfectly capable of surviving on my own, and so are you. That doesn't mean you have to survive on your own. You've had to do that for far too long. I don't care if you rely on me too much, because I rely on you too much also. I love you so much, and I won't let Dumbledore get in the way of that."
Nodding, Hermione drew Harry into a tight hug. She whispered "I am so happy for you, but just know that if they even touch one hair on your head.." Giving out a light giggle, Harry whispered "I know" back to her.
Smiling, Harry finished getting dressed and grabbed Draco's hand before heading to breakfast. They met up with Blaise, Pansy, Theo, and Millicent, who was a new addition to their little group. After talking to her, they realized she wasn't nearly as bad as she seemed.
Harry found himself on the receiving end of what he would soon deem Draco's mom glare. "Harry, I swear, no amount of food is too much for someone as skinny as you. Eat. It. All." Harry shrinked back, and glared at Pansy and Blaise who were laughing so hard they couldn't even eat.
Madam Pomfrey looked at the parchment with a growing sense of dread. This was the longest a diagnostic scan had ever taken, and that was saying something. She exchanged a glance with Snape, who just mouthed 'relatives' and Madam Pomfrey felt anger blossom in her chest.
Harry couldn't remember ever having the ability to stand still. Whenever he was nervous or anxious that would manifest itself into some sort of movement. But it seemed as if right now was an exception. Wanting to lower his head to avoid the cold glares bearing into his head, Harry stood still as a statue, worried that some sort of movement would end in injury (or something worse).
Grinning, Pansy took a sip of her pumpkin juice. Surprisingly it was quite entertaining to converse with Potter. "Oh come on Potter, Dumbledore would never approach the Slytherin table with a ten foot stick." Pansy said, before frowning when she noticed nothing was on Potter's plate. Was Potter not hungry? She came up with a better question, was she really worried about Potter?
While everyone was discussing what to do, Harry frowned. They didn't know much about the situation, and they were being given a very easy way to get more information. Trying to talk, Harry 's voice was immediately drowned out by everyone else's.
Draco saw how little Harry put on his plate, and frowned. While Harry was focused on eating, Draco put a large serving of everything onto Harry's plate, noting the approving glance Snape sent him.
"Harry, please tell him." Draco whispered, worried. "Well um, I've been having a lot of nightmares." Nodding, Snape motioned for him to continue. "Every night, I have to watch someone being tortured. Sometimes it's Draco, sometimes it's Pansy, Theo, Hermione, Cedric, even though he's already dead, and you." If Snape was surprised by Harry's words, he didn't show it. Draco on the other hand, clenched his teeth and gripped Harry's hand tighter.
"Today, you will be working with partners to brew a healing draught. It is a very hard potion to mess up, but knowing you someone in this class will manage to do so. Begin."
Slowly running his fingers through Harry's head, Draco gave a light kiss onto his forehead before joining Theo and Daphne's conversation.
"But I don't understand, how will that help Harry." "While Draco is in detention, I will stop by the Slytherin common room to talk with young Harry." "Oh ok. If anyone is able to help Harry it would be you professor."
Snape let out a small sigh, "Come on Harry, let us go back to the dorms. I will tend to your injuries, but you will go to dinner first. I expect you to finish at least half of what Draco puts on your plate."
"Hello new snakes. This is your house, Slytherin. I know things can be scary, especially if you don't know where thing are. There are older students called prefects, who will be wearing a badge on their robes. You can ask them for help with any minor problems, but if anything major happens come straight to me. As you may have noticed, Slytherin has a bad reputation. Sadly, people judge our house based on ignorance. Yes, there have been bad wizards who've come out of Slytherin. But there have been bad wizards who have come out of every house. One of the first rules is do not judge someone based on first glance. Due to the bias against Slytherin, in house unity is important. This brings me to the most important rule. Slytherin is family. I will not tolerate fights or hate against other snakes. I will be meeting with new students regarding classes and your schedules. We may not be Ravenclaws, but we value academics. I will not tolerate sneaking around the castle late at night," At this he gave a pointed glance to Harry. "And you will have a bedtime, which will be posted on the board here. There are also mandatory physicals and consultations. I expect you will make me proud. Good night."
It was unavoidable, and Harry figured that no matter where he was sorted there was a good reason for it.
They got to the common room, and everyone dispersed except for Theo, Pansy, Blaise, Draco, and him. All five of them went to the couches and cushions to get their assignments done.
They arrived at the common room, and Harry learned the password, which was Salazar. As they all gathered together, Snape walked up to the front and everyone quieted down.
Okay so 1st of all thanks for all the comments and support! Second of all I read the last chapter and realized (with some help from the comments) that maybe things moved a bit quickly, so this chapter is basically going to be a character study.
"Can I take you to Diagon Alley on Saturday? It is unacceptable to be a part of the Slytherin house while wearing those rags you call clothing." The professor said, his tone firm and leaving no room for argument.
Harrys reaction shot off all red flags in Snapes eyes. Something was definitely wrong, no matter how much he didn't want to admit it. Snape purposefully made sure he had no angry or annoyed tone when he talked and lowered his voice, taking on a soothing quality.
uhm its been like 8 months yall i did not mean to keep u waiting this long 0.0 chile anyways enjoy the chapter
Quickly, Draco got ready for breakfast without speaking a word to Harry besides good morning. They walked towards the common room, and Harry's face lit up and he waved when he saw Pansy and Blaise. Blaise couldn't help but smile when he saw Harry, because the positivity the boy exuded was like a disease. Pansy whispered to him "I'm not normally a morning person, but he's just so bright and happy. How the hell?"
Harry was supposed to be the perfect weapon. He was meant to stay in Gryffindor, defeat Voldemort, and hopefully die in the process.
They had exchanged a few words, but every time they talked Harry just wanted Cedric to kiss him silly. But Cedric had been with Cho, and Harry couldn't do that to Cho. He knew if he had done anything with Cedric word would have gotten around the school fast. He would have become Harry the Whore, a slut, a fag.
Once the scan was finished, Madam Pomfrey silently got a stock of nutrition potions and gave them to Snape. She also grabbed some bruise salve and a pain relief potion.
Harry grimaced, but downed the vial, washing it down with many sips of pumpkin juice. He patted his stomach, that was more than he had eaten in a long time.
Breakfast went by without incident, well, that's a lie. The Gryffindors (not all of them) were consistently insulting Harry, but soon stopped when the saw the look Draco had on his face. It was probably enough to make the Dark Lord run away (which is saying something). Harry just remained oblivious, trying to finish the heaps of food Draco put on his plate.
When they got to the Great Hall, Harry felt someone's eyes on him. He couldn't help but squirm a little bit, extremely uncomfortable. No matter how many people stared at him, he would never be able to get used to the feeling.
Smiling softly, Draco pulled Harry over to where everyone else was seated, taking a spot next to Harry. Narcissa, being the composed woman she was, took it upon herself to start conversation. "Mr. Potter, I will start by addressing the elephant in the room. Yes, we both
Halfway through breakfast, Harry noticed Ron leave the same time Dumbledore did, and frowned. He knew Draco had noticed, as he gripped Harry's hand a little tighter than before. Immediately, Harry notified Blaise and Pansy of it, and they resolved to speak about it in the privacy of their common room.
Flinching and lowering his head to the point where Snape thought he would fall off the couch, Harry sighed.
Harry startled awake in bed, sweaty and tight chested. A nightmare, again. Sighing, Harry looked to see if he woke Draco up, which he didn't. Draco was still sleeping soundly, and Harry fondly smiled when he snored a little bit.
Blaise couldn't help but agree. Both of them joined Draco and Harry, and started chatting on their way to breakfast. "So Harry, did you find out how much of a morning person Draco is?" Pansy asked, knowing full well how impossible Draco was to deal with during the early hours of the day. Instead of laughing, Harry just smiled brighter and nodded his head. "It took me around half an hour just to get him to sit up!"
Without another word, both of Draco's parents got up and the three students followed them. They were lead through a series of hallways, with so many beautiful accessories that Harry wanted to stop and admire all the riches. As soon as they entered the dining hall, Harry felt his eyes widen and his jaw drop open. It was giant! A beautiful chandelier hung from the ceiling, which was beautifully painted with a finesse that only professionals could achieve. The table before him was covered in any type of food a person could wish for, and Harry had to pinch his arm because
"Harry, thank you for being completely honest with me. I do not know if this matters to you, but you have earned my respect. You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, and you will always have my support. Now comes the part that neither of us like. We have to go to the hospital wing so you can get your physical. It will not take very long, and I will inform Madam Pomfrey that you will need a nutrition potion every day with breakfast until you get up to the recommended weight for a child your age. Come, lets walk together."
Draco sighed. "I know you can Harry, but this is Dumbledore we're talking about. He is one of the most powerful wizards of the generation. Whatever the information is, it isn't worth you getting hurt. Right guys?" Draco looked around, only to see faces of consideration. "You guys can't seriously be thinking about this!"
Draco frowned, that wasn't his goal at all. "That's not my point Harry. My point is I'm worried. I'll even go with you if you want, but something has felt not right for a while, and we both know it."
to work for the dark lord. No, we will not sacrifice you to him, or lead him to you. For the time being, you are Draco's friend, which means you are now our friend." Nodding dumbly, Harry worked to keep the surprise off his face. That was not what he expected at all. "Erm," Harry muttered, a bright blush overtaking his face, "thank you for hosting me tonight. I hope you won't regret it."
"Hey Potter, you can talk to snakes right?" Theo asked, a little nervous because he didn't really know what Harry's views of Slytherin was. "Yeah?" Harry responded, thoroughly confused.
Looking up to see who was staring, he caught the eyes of Dumbledore, and immediately looked away.  He didn't want Dumbledore getting into his mind. Draco, noticing his obvious discomfort, brought him to the Slytherin table to sit down and eat.
His chest was covered in bruises of all shades, with scars that where obviously from a knife surrounding them. He had many burns on his hand from Aunt Petunia, but kept a glamour on them. Harry didn't even want to look at his back. He knew it was probably covered in welts from the belt that Uncle Vernon favored.
When Harry woke up, there was one second where he was just a school boy laying in bed. Where he had the same responsibilities as everyone else, he had the same stupid worries like everyone else, and he had a
Harry knew he could never call the Dursleys his family. As Snape said it, they are "Horrible muggles who have zero kindness and have sticks so high up their arses that..." That definitely caused a small laughing fit when Harry heard it. Blaise, Pansy, and Theo were proving to be an amazing group of friends and an amazing support group. Harry wasn't sure how, but they became part of his precious people. And Draco.. was breathtaking. He always made sure to stay next to Harry and comfort him if something happened. He still acted like an arrogant Slytherin prince, but he was really a giant softie.
It was quite fun riling up students, but Severus sobered up once he saw Harry's chest and back, and couldn't stop a gasp from escaping. It was horrific, and it took all of Snapes training not to throw up.
The way Harry said it, it sounded like they were starving him. Glancing again at Harry, he realized the shirt Harry was wearing (which was an extra small kids shirt) hung off his frame. He sucked in a breath, that wasn't just skinny, that was dangerous.
When Draco had woken up a little early that morning, he saw Harry climb back into bed with a lethargic and tired look on his face. Draco wasn't able to stop the small flower of worry that started growing in his heart.
"I um live with my muggle relatives. Aunt Petunia, her husband Uncle Vernon, and their son Dudley. They treat me the way guardians are supposed to treat someone." Harry said in a monotone voice, and the line sounded like it was drilled (or maybe beaten) into him.
As Harry was doing that, Snape walked around to grab the necessary potions and salves, ignoring Harry's spiteful glare. At one point he even decided to start humming, just t annoy the boy in his room even more.
"We can set up safety measures in advance to make sure Potter doesn't get hurt. I can put a protection spell on Potter so that I'm alerted when someone tries to put a spell on him. As much as I dislike the situation, Granger has a point." Snape said, allowing everyone to process his words. They talked a little bit longer, fully forming a plan in case things went awry.
"Did you say your cupboard?" He asked, already frowning even though the explanation had just started. The way Harry talked made it sound like he thought getting hit with a frying pan at a young age was normal, which it wasn't by any means.
"I will cast a diagnostic spell, which will tell me the injuries you have gotten, and when you got them. The quill I'm holding will automatically write them down onto enchanted parchment. The parchment is spelled to keep anyone but me or your head of house from seeing it. If someone else wants to see it, both me and Snape have to give consent. Could you just lay down for me and stay as still as possible?"
It felt like everyone focused on Harry swimming, but no one noticed when the water became higher and higher to the point where Harry couldn't breathe.
He wanted to talk with Harry about the plan and the concerns Draco brought to him earlier. Draco stayed seated on the bed, and grabbed Harry's hand and squeezed it. Feeling slightly comforted, Harry smiled, ignoring the uneasy feeling settling in his stomach.
As soon as Harry heard about the resorting, he wanted to throw himself off a cliff. Morbid? Sure, but that was sort of what Harry did best considering the environment he grew up in. Back to the resorting though, Harry figured he was going to be in Slytherin.
Unable to stay silent, Harry let his response slip. "Why yes Mr.Zabini, between my dead parents and my horrific muggle relatives there were so many people available to teach me about manners." All three of them frowned.
Tilting his head in confusion, Harry used his puppy eyes on Draco. Sighing, Draco tried his hardest not to, but eventually caved. "You can borrow something, but just for tonight." Harry smiled, "Who knew Draco Malfoy was such a softie?" He questioned, earning a half hearted glare from Draco. In retaliation, Draco grinned and checked his watch. "Mr. Potter," Draco said in his best imitation of his snarky potions professor, "I believe there are five minutes until noon. Cutting it quite close, aren't we?"
His voice cracking a bit, Harry asked if he really had to tell Snape, who nodded his head and kept those obsidian black eyes on him.
His brain was screaming all these things at him, and Harry couldn't do anything but listen. He tried to think of positive memories, but none came to mind. The closest thing to a positive memory was when Uncle Vernon locked him into his cupboard and left him alone. Wrapping his arms around his now clothed self, Harry wished someone else was hugging him. He wanted to be touched, hugged, kissed, cared for.
Hurrying out of her third class, Hermione practically sprinted towards the Slytherin common rooms. On the way there, she bumped into Draco, Harry, Theo, and Pansy. "Why in such a hurry Hermione?" Harry asked curiously, after barely escaping Hermione hitting him.
So when Dumbledore took Ron out of the Great Hall, she just had to follow. Standing up from the table, she was stopped by Seamus asking her where she was going. "The loo, girl problems you know?" She said while mustering up her best blush and gesturing to her stomach area. Seamus was now red faced, and had taken to shoving his face with food. Walking out of the Great Hall, she immediately spotted Dumbledore and Ron, standing in a dark corner of a hallway. Hermione quickly walked behind a wall before casting a silencio spell on herself.
”Stop. Don’t do this. I can’t do that.” Draco eyes were filling with tears, “Merlin, my father must be rolling around in his grave.”
”Ladies and Gentlemen of the eighth cohort! Tonight, we face the game that will determine if you posses balls or if you are seriously lacking in that department. Of course, even the women of the house are welcome to possess these jewels. Let the games begin!” Hermione announced from where she stood at the edge of the water, before she jumped and tucked in her legs, canon-balling into the center of the large bath.
“Yeah, it would be,” Harry said as he started to card his fingers through Teddy’s hair. “But it doesn’t have to be. We can be our own person.”
Minerva simply smiled at him. “Hagrid told you one day that certain magical animals were becoming endangered, in particular, the hippogriffs. So you worked hard, you educated yourself.”
“No, I didn’t! I was very picky that night,” George chimed in, then went back to his conversation with Arthur.
Goyle sighed. “I saw the article, honestly. You’d think the reporters would stop hammering about with you.”
Nott suddenly jumped and scrambled for his pockets, mumbling a jumbled mess of Harry’s words back to himself. After about 3 seconds, Nott had a muggle pen and notepad in his hand, scribbling messily onto the pages.
All of Harry’s life, he’s been asked this question. For some reason, this particular time irritated him just that little bit more.
When Harry’s mouth didn’t feel like it was turning inside out, he realised it was the first truly pure thing he said. No hint of deceit or hesitation. He was genuinely concerned about Malfoy’s wellbeing.
“You notice me?” Malfoy whispered it so quietly that Harry would have dismissed it as part of the gusts of wind outside.
“Are you cooking? What time is it?” Harry didn’t think he could’ve held in his questions even if he wanted to.
Harry didn’t know the dance, but he definitely knew the song. He couldn’t imagine Ron singing it at all, let alone at a wedding reception with his parents beside him.
Pansy Parkinson was there with him along the way, though she branched off into the muggle world a lot sooner than Blaise had. In fact, it was her that encouraged Blaise to try it out.
Hermione and Ron told him the night before that they couldn’t be there when Harry was released. They were truthful and honest when they told Harry that they didn’t want to be in the middle of whatever happens when he gets to his house. To be fair, Harry didn’t really put up a fight.
“Yeah, but I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.” She shrugged. “I just have to live with an Acceptable if I’m lucky.”
His throat felt like sandpaper, and his vision blurred with tears. Was he crying? There was too much happening to tell. Harry’s wand was outstretched, pointing at Malfoy who didn’t stop looking at him.
True to his word, the walk was no longer than 15 minutes. But the path was convoluted as all hell. Twists and turns, lefts and rights, and somehow they passed the same tree twice. Malfoy just looked at him weirdly when Harry commented on it.
Malfoy just shook his head. “No. Besides, this is the first time I’ve come home from work and you weren’t in your office. You must’ve gone out, right?”
“Can I just cast one more diagnostic charm on your head? It’ll be quick, I’ll just check for any residual magic that isn’t your own.”
But Lavender’s hand was still on his shoulder. It felt like it was burning through his clothes and onto his skin. He hated it.
Harry didn’t realise that the sun had gone down until the floo roared behind him while he was still putting his books in.
He skimmed through the cases, trying to choose which one he’d focus on. The second one was most interesting. It was focused on the disappearance of a young woman.
“Yeah, well. You know him, doesn’t let many people in when he’s very stressed,” Nott murmured into his shot of firewhiskey before swigging it.
“They’re okay. Well, as okay as they can be.” Ron sat at the foot of Harry’s bed. “You have to understand that we’ve told them about your memory loss. And it’s been really hard.”
Teddy huffed in annoyance. “You were lying to her while we were eating sandwiches!” He whispered loudly. “She might not have noticed, but I did.”
It was begging for his memory to return. It was pleading and praying, and no answers. It was denial at the situation because how could he
She spoke of how drabby and old wizarding fashion was. How there was such a strong sense of how a wizard should dress, and that anything out of that image would cause strange looks. Pansy noted that she had enough strange looks in 8th year to last a lifetime.
“I think you should go home for the day, Harry. You’ve been at this case for weeks. You need a proper break.”
“All of my friends are like this,” Teddy said as he pulled away. “Most adults don’t think we listen but we do.”
Truthfully, it truly a miracle that he didn’t splinch himself. He tripped over himself as the street lined with stores came into view.
For some reason, the idea of Malfoy knowing, or hoping, that Harry’s memories were coming back made him feel like he was going to dry heave. The same went for Hermione and Ron too.
There was silence over the table. The sounds of the restaurant’s livelihood still bouncing off the walls, the bells still rang, and orders were still given, but Harry felt like everything was buffering in this silence.
Harry continued resting on the chair, waiting for the pain in his stomach to subside. Whilst he waited, he took note of the room. There were shelves on the corner overflowing with books, he noticed some were muggle stories, the others were magical textbooks. The books were all over the place, but for some reason, he knew there was an order to this mess. Organised chaos.
Thinking took too much energy. The hammering in his skull only grew louder whenever he had enough time to think about everything that could’ve changed, everything that he had missed. Were the glasses beside him the same ones? Is his favourite mug still there at home, waiting to be used? Hell, is it even his favourite mug anymore? These thoughts, once entered, never left until he slept, too exhausted by it all.
As if Harry’s thoughts weren’t enough, both Neville and Goyle swooped in and kissed Nott on both cheeks. Nott just swatted them both away and said, “Later, you gits, I gotta get this down.”
He looked back at the photos. It was him, but at the same time, it wasn’t. There was still so much to rediscover about himself and who he hung out with.
Malfoy’s voice was laced with sorrow. Harry was amazed that Malfoy could remember, or notice something like that. In a way, he could understand why it was hard for him.
“All charms have an essence of magic,” Lavender explained. “Too much magic, and it ruins the evidence. Sometimes it mixes with the lingering bits of magic and nullifies it, other times it makes it stronger and difficult to analyse. Plastics are the best things we can do for now to avoid that.”
The silence grew, but it was bearable with his friends here. Soon, Ron asked, “How old do you feel?”
There was so much movement. The trees danced with the wind. It was like a farm, but it wasn’t cows or horses that resided on the fields. It was thestrals and hippogriffs, blast ended skrewts and flobberworms. There were animals of all different kinds.
“It was at Draco’s surprise birthday party. We, uh, all decided he needed one after everything that happened…”
God, how many more differences could he find about him and the one that was lost from that auror raid?
It didn’t even occur to him until he was riding up the elevator that his name was the headline. Again. He didn’t remember it word for word but he knew it was something to do with his ministry visit a few days ago. Why his face was still in the news, he didn’t want to know.
He stared at the ceiling, its blurred nothingness. The covers clung to his body like a second skin. But he didn’t reach for his glasses, nor his watch. He just laid there, and breathed.
“Oh, you usually keep it unlocked. The wards are strong, and this part of London has a low theft rate.” Ron smiles at Harry. “Besides, there is the usual
“For not asking about your mother sooner. I’ve asked everyone about their life in the past 5 years except you. So I am sorry for doing that, and I’m ready to listen if you’d like to tell me?”
Then he grabbed the new journal he bought. The new quills, and inkwells, the new muggle pens too. He rearranged them on his desk the way that felt right, even if it was different from before.
“Wait, what was the dancing?” Harry asked, amazed at how pretty much everyone looked like they wanted to forget.
Harry buried his head into his hands after he maneuvered to sit on the floor. He couldn’t bare to look at Malfoy as he told him everything.
“I shouldn’t’ve said that,” Hagrid said. But Harry looked at him with pleading eyes. Finally, Hagrid softened. “Yeah, ye chose Tatus. Ye usually go wif Hace o’er there.”
The conversation continued on about a range of things. Ranging from the past, to the party. Harry took the subtle clues of how events went, and stored them in his memory in case he needed them in future pretendings. It was difficult though, because sometimes people simply weren’t there.
Malfoy looked tired and broken all over again. Harry’s heart pulled towards him, but he stayed where he was. Whoever this Malfoy is, he didn’t love him. Not like unknown Harry did, and not the way unknown Malfoy wanted him to.
The Ministry entrance hadn’t changed at all from the last time he could remember being there. The same boring large doors, same blank faced people going in and out of those doors. Maybe in another life he would’ve loved entering those doors at least once.
He got up, and walked into the bathroom. Begrudgingly, he began to get ready for the day. Finding clothes somewhere amongst the wardrobes, guessing his toothbrush was the strikingly deep Gryffindor red that bordered on obnoxious, he finally got there.
But his idea had to work, it had to. So he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, avoiding the eyes that seemed to intent on more.
He gave her a questioning glance but continued on. He waited for her to get her food too, which was also takeaway.
Goyle laughed. It was hearty and booming. “Yeah, he did. But I guess we were all too knackered to care, we let him in and celebrate with us.”
On the desk were an array of ink bottles and pens that looked like they were from a 2 dollar muggle shop. He had shelves with stacks of folders shoved hastily on top of each other. There were a few books, a mix of muggle and magical. On the window sill was a potted plant, not dead yet, but seemed to be in need of a lot of care.
“Nothing, just watch, and relax. We thought you’d need a little break.” Ron smiled at him, then looked back.
Malfoy’s face showed way too much. For one, Harry knew he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep. Heavy bags under his sunken eyes, and his usually flawless skin had spots. Along with that, Malfoy’s cheekbones had sharpened immensely, his jawline jutting out. He looked sick, thin, and much too tired.
Before Ron could continue, Harry’s questions flew out of his mouth. “Do I have a partner? Why haven’t they seen me yet? Are they okay? Who is it? Are they okay?” His chest ached and he rubbed his fist against it, trying to relieve some of the pain.
The trio walked in, an aura of confidence and importance seemed to grow with their every step. It made Harry feel powerful, but also hide because it would only attract people.
Harry listened in awe and Neville continued on about his relationship. How they’d meet up at least once a week. They’re schedules weren’t usually synced, but with Hogsmeade trips and Nott’s organisation skills, they made it work. It was lovely to hear, and he was happy for Neville. Really. Everything was going great for him.
When Draco was seven, he accidentally incinerated his mother’s rose garden. Since then, she became very particular about teaching him self-control.
Draco’s first memory was a plume of blue fire. With it came the brush of a warm, leathery wing, and the sound of his mother’s voice in his ears, a low, maternal rumble. Her breath was a whiff of brimstone and ash. Her underbelly was a pale cerulean shade that matched the jewel-bright radiance of her large, unblinking eyes, eyes that watched over him with both sternness and tenderness.
The dusky valley beyond the cave’s entrance lightened, as though the valley was a cup into which light was flowing, gradually gathering at the bottom in a pool of shimmering green. It was beautiful, even glimpsed through the rain’s semi-transparent veil. This land was beautiful, and it called to Draco like the summons of a faraway song, heard too long ago to remember its exact words.
Then he got used to it, and he wasn’t sure if that was worse. Sometimes, after moving into Malfoy Manor, he had nightmares in which he was a boy who only dreamed he was a dragon, and was not in fact a real dragon. His mother had cast a spell on him to keep him stuck in his human form until he matured enough to control his transformations. Draco knew it was for his own good, but he despised it. It felt like being trapped in the world’s softest cage. And with every year that passed, the walls of the cage closed in on him even more, too narrow to accommodate his nonexistent wings.
The world was perfect in that instant—just him, his mother and his full belly. He wanted for nothing.
It was just… He fantasised about being open about himself, sometimes. He indulged in the occasional daydream of soaring above the spires of Hogwarts, his wings unfurled majestically against the backdrop of a suitably fiery sunset, filling the tiny onlookers beneath him with awe.
What followed was a series of gruelling years in which Narcissa did her utmost to prepare her fledgling dragon-boy for a world populated by humans that would, upon uncovering the truth, be petrified of him.
“Your template for flying must be that of a dragon’s,” Narcissa emphasised. “It should lay the foundation for your body’s memory of flight. Human flying is easy, as it is done using the broom as a crutch, but if you become too dependent on that crutch, your learning of dragon-flight will suffer. Hence, we will begin with dragon-flight, and you can learn how to fly with a broom after you have mastered the basic principles of independent flight.”
It was this advice of his mother’s that would stay with Draco, always, even after he learned that she was also a woman named Narcissa, and that he was also a boy named Draco—a boy with a body that felt oddly… soft-boiled, not hard enough or armoured enough but fragile and helpless, a snail without its shell.
“B-but,” Draco asked, gaining the gift of speech with the rapidity that only weredragons could achieve at such a young age, “wh-what if the fire burns? What if it comes from somewhere else? What if it isn’t
“I am looking,” she answered dryly, but with a measure of pride that had Draco preening. He swooped like she did, whirled and ducked and dipped and rolled, following her every move. Before long, they were soaring together, higher and higher, until the Quidditch pitch disappeared beneath them only to replaced by clouds.
flow, dampening Draco’s shirt, and Draco experienced a surge of protectiveness. Draco’s mother clearly did not need protection, but this man did, impoverished as he was despite being dressed like a prince; he was starved for affection, for the sight of his own child. This man, who could not sprout wings and talons at will, who could not breathe fire, who was even weaker as an adult than Draco had been as a hatchling.
Draco listened with half an ear as he beheld the sunrise through the mouth of the cave. Maybe it was only so arresting because it was his first sunrise; he would later associate it with the colour of his mother’s frost-white, nigh-golden hair—or her human form’s hair, rather.
Draco dreamt of fighting off evildoers, of being a noble-yet-intimidating creature, of having tales sung about him by the Weird Sisters of the future. (And possibly the present.) He dreamt of fame and power. He dreamt of making men’s knees tremble with fear… or reverence. Or both. Both was good.
Dragon mothers were notoriously fierce, after all. And to Draco, who was then only a mewling, snivelling, sticky mess, she seemed the epitome of all power and grace. Her very shape was an immensity, as though the entire universe had poured itself into the mold of her form—stars, planets and all. Her scales certainly glittered like stars in the dim, pre-dawn light, and she had a strange gravity to her, as though any creature foolish enough to look her in the eye would be drawn in helplessly for the devouring. She was beautiful, and terrifying, and Draco adored her with all the blind, animal devotion of a newborn.
Draco blinked. The blink was slower than his human blink, and double-lidded, besides. Like having not one, but two veils lifted from his vision.
“Leave them,” Narcissa said grimly, and it shocked Draco, though he could see the sorrow in her eyes as she said it. “Hatchling… You cannot risk yourself, myself, and what remains of the Drakoi line for the lives of a handful of humans.”
As it was, Draco decided to enjoy being small instead of resenting it. Being small did have its perks. He nestled closer under his mother’s wing, soaking in her heat and letting out a short, high-pitched, pleased rumble of his own… except that it was more a chirp than a rumble. Embarrassed, he distracted himself by snapping up the raw minced meat that he had been offered on an ornate brass platter. As he grew sated, his eyes became heavy again.
Just before they left, Ron turned around. “Oh, Harry. Kingsley wants to talk to you at some point. Send him a message whenever you’re free. Don’t leave him too long though, you know how he is.”
would he’d his bullocks. In truth, Draco had been the only person he’d ever gotten that close with other than Ginny, and she wasn’t in the room.
“See, Malfoy? You didn’t even argue the fact that I’m better.” With that Harry backed away and turned to the rest of the students who were still loudly arguing about the outcome of the match and their money, “Guys! No one lost and no one won! Cancel all the bets because I doubt any of you bet it would come out a tie and get on with your day.”
”Obviously screwing me will only ever happen in your dreams. I do not get screwed, I screw. That’s not going to change no matter how good of a fuck you are.” He uncrossed his arms and placed them at his sides and felt Harry’s cock twitch at his thigh.
I would take it too.” Most of the girls around had agreed and rumours of Neville’s love affaire with the lake creature lasted months after that.
was better than anything he’d ever done with any girl, despite de uncomfortable feeling. He turned around, Draco’s hand following him, and pushed back again onto the long finger inching it’s way into his arse.
That something revealed himself rather quickly when Harry tried to pull away. He raised his arm in front of his face and heard a hiss coming from behind him. His entire arm was stuck to a pale one and his cheek was also glued to someone else’s. That someone had rolled over in their sleep and pulled Harry back with him so his neck was strained.
Harry was still grinning when he turned to Hermione, who had a clear look of disapproval spread across her face. “What?”
The lot of eighth years went own to the great Hall for breakfast not long after, their booming voices echoing through the empty halls that lead to the more common areas of the school. after that most went to the library to finish up some work before going to the village before lunch. Hogsmead was better in the afternoon anyhow.
”Quit it, Malfoy! I need to work more than you do. Just sit straight.” Malfoy didn’t cause any trouble after that but he did point out that Harry had just called him smart.
“Well, after everything, they had to fight over a bloody snitch! They couldn’t accept that they both caught it and get on with it?”
The conversation twisted into one about lessons and upcoming events. Harry stared across the hall at a young couple at the Ravenclaw table. The two were holding hands beneath the table and smiling at each other, reminding him what he’d missed out on in his youth.
”Alright, who in this room,” he looked around and gave pointed looks at the Patil twins and Cho who sat near Hermione, “have you shagged? That’s for the truth. If you don’t answer this, you have to take off your bathing suit.”
After that, it was soon known around the school that Harry Potter had called a truce with Draco Malfoy. Nobody knew how long it would last but no one knew that it would last as long as it did. In fact it lasted more than a month before it turned into a real friendship and not a cessez-le-feu.
Most of them felt quite happy to have been given the newest dorms instead of their old. Most. There was of course the stubborn few who refused to admit that they like the new ones better and therefore always rose to the when the opportunity of complaining arrose. A few Ravenclaws complained about having to share a study area with the other houses, but it was otherwise mostly Slytherins that did the complaining.
The potion’s professor had stilled in the corner. He looked up at his father with tears rolling down his sharp cheekbones with his eyes red and puffy, “Anything perversions I decide to partake in will be nothing compared to the shame you put our family through. You are dead! You have no more control over me.” He paused and looked at Harry before picking up his wand from the floor and whispering a soft
What happened next was a surprise to everyone in the stands as well as the two competitions. Draco’s left hand swung toward the snitch flying between his and Harry’s extended hands on his right side, just as Harry’s right hand swiped at it. It resulted in a sort of high five with the snitch clamped between their palms.
Madam Pomfrey did as was asked and Malfoy, who had been awfully tense, relaxed a little. He was glad he wouldn’t be permanently attached to the smelly hit next to him and the bed had been very uncomfortable for him too. Minutes passed by and felt like hours before the professor returned with a poltergeist contained in a magical barrier. The boys glared daggers at the floating figure, who just stuck out his tongue and giggled.
the one who left love bites down my neck.” He smacked his arms against the surface of the water and foam flew and landed on the blond head in front of him. He bit back a grin. Draco looked so cute like this, even if he was angry, “Look, I really wouldn’t mind being your friend, Mal-Draco. To call a truce? To be honest you’re the one of the few who sees me for me. I need someone like that. Of course, if you want to pretend that you still hate me and that you don’t deserve friendship well screw you.”
“We believe you, Neville. Malfoy’s just being a prick.” Harry had replied. He turned to look over Draco’s shoulder as he read the letter he’d received.
To be perfectly fair, the last time someone had entered the castle had resulted in many deaths and severe injuries and though he tried to rationalize, a small part of him refused to believe it could be a coincidence that all this commotion was happening in the potions classroom. The better part of him kept calm and hoped this was all a misunderstanding. Draco Malfoy wasn’t the same scared manipulable boy he had been ten years ago. This
”I... I’ve never” Draco couldn’t bring himself to finish. It was too embarrassing. His first had been Harry. His enemy. Probably the only one who would ever consent to doing such acts with him, a former death eater, despite the fact that students were treating him with enough civility in order to not feel guilty. He would forever he alone. That wouldn’t change.
Clearly, Peeves had started enjoying his new hobby because over the course of the next month, the two boys had gotten glued together another eight times. At one point, they’d been eating in the Great Hall when they had been levitated above the tables and stuck together back to back before being dropped down onto the floor on their bums, to the great amusement of everyone in the hall(although the teachers tried to hide their giggles). When they’d tried to get up, they failed miserably and landed back down with a thud.
They wasted no time. Harry sent a patronus to his class on the third floor to dismiss his class early and tumbled down the stairs after his student, Alyssa Jordan, who studying at Hogwarts for her seventh year. She was a kind-hearted young witch who, normally, treated everyone with politeness, respect, and fairness. Had the situation been any different, Harry probably would have chuckled at the site of the Hufflepuff bustling down the hall, pushing and shoving everyone in her way without the smallest of apologies, shouting at anyone who refused to cooperate and stomping down the stairs to the dungeons with an impregnable determined pace.
They stood there for a few minutes, catching their breath and when Harry cast a silent cleaning charm over the two of them Draco tried to pull back suddenly. The reality of the situation hit him and he realized this was real. He’d just done that. He’d just jizzed his pants while grinding onto the saviour of the wizarding world. He was filled with a heavy sense of shame as he thought of what had just happened.
“You can’t possibly be disappointed, ‘Mione. It’s Malfoy and Harry! It’s to be expected.” Dean replied, grinning.
“What was the boggart talking about?” Harry knew he shouldn’t have asked. Malfoy was going to kick him out.
Harry walked over to where Draco stood fuming and pressed himself to his side, what could have been considered an inappropriate gesture had he not leaned in to whisper into the blond’s ear,
Seamus was all too proud of his position in from of the voice amplifier, started passionately describing the fight as Hermione rushed towards the field to stop them before anything happened.
”I don’t care what people think. I want you. I don’t want Ginny. I don’t care if we make the front page of the P
Draco and Harry hadn’t spoken since that morning and now they were sat at opposite sides of the tub pretending that nothing had ever happened that morning.
“I’m sorry boys,” Madam Pomfrey said to the two, who were now crammed into a single hospital bed about a half hour after the incident, “you may have to stay this way for a few more hours. The spell that bound you together was cast by Peeves, whose magic is bound to the school’s. It is much more powerful than that of a wizard and unfortunately I cannot risk detaching you myself. It would most likely only complicate your situation.” She ignored their discouraged looks and continued, “However, I have asked Professor Flitwick to track down our poltergeist so he may detach you himself. The spell should only last a couple hours at most, anyway.”
”Shove off, Malfoy. I’ve been trying to call a bloody truce and be your friend since September. Don’t tell me this is my fault. You’re the one who’s too stubborn to let go of our last differences. Even the school is trying to tell you to give me a chance. Merlin!” He gestured at their glued body parts.
The tub was filled to the brim with steaming hot water and there was at least a foot of foam on the surface. Everyone was sitting around the bath drinking and chatting. It was eight thirty.
They moved together with a steady growing rhythm. Draco was biting and sucking on the dark skin of Harry’s sweaty back, water was streaming down his face, but he paid it no mind. His own pleasure, forgotten, mind set on the task at hand. Soon Harry was begging him for another finger and he complied, pushing another in to join the first, curling and twisting them in the slick warmth that was Harry’s hole. He pumped them in and out as the boy moaned and groaned.
As they walked, it seemed like the room got bigger. More desks filled with people showed up, and Harry began to wonder when the area really started, and where it really ended.
“You’ve said it before. But it won’t change what I think, what I’ve felt.” Malfoy slowed down, and took a deep breath. “Just give this desk job a try, yeah?”
“Oh, uh,” Harry looked at the food, then faced the person serving food. “I’ll just get a ham, cheese, tomato and lettuce sandwich, and a mac and cheese.”
“Time? I just lost 5 years of it, does it look like I need to lose some more of it? I should be doing something more. But I’m here, at a party with some people I don’t even remember befriending…” Harry trailed off, feeling the back of his eyes sting, and the slow closing off of his throat.
Despite the words, Harry had a feeling the status title drop was a joke, so he let it slide. “Malfoy, she hasn’t moved has she?”
The faint noise of something sizzling from what Harry assumed was the kitchen, started to grow a little louder. He realised that a hint of raw ginger and garlic surrounded Malfoy thinly. His eyes widened as his thoughts continued on. Draco Malfoy was cooking food, and it smelled, so far, amazing.
Harry decided not to push with the questions though. He’d learnt a decent amount today, there was no need to push Malfoy and end up with another duel.
. Not minutes, not hours. If there is an alternative to saving yourself that does not expose what you are, then you must choose it, regardless of how difficult it may be. I do not want you transforming at every threat, or because you get into an immature hormonal fight with some adolescent rival of yours. You are only permitted to transform if your very existence is in clear and present danger.”
“Harder. With all the force you have in you, or your wings will not lift you off the ground.” Narcissa demonstrated, stretching out her own wings and giving a mighty
with the sight of that mouse. His stomach grumbled, and he was unexpectedly hungry. Those sandwiches he’d had for lunch mustn’t have been filling enough… Ham sandwich… Cheese sandwich… Mouse sandwich…
“He was even softer to the touch as an infant,” Narcissa said, and Lucius’s features clouded over with regret.
As his mother led him downwards again, circling around the Malfoy estate and spiralling down towards the lake behind the manor, Draco strained to speed up, eager to see his own reflection in the lake. To truly
His mother chastised him for his foolishness. So Draco learned to hide it, as he’d learned to hide so much.
The sound etched itself into Draco’s mind, which grabbed onto it greedily, as if onto a new addition to a hoard. He had made his mother laugh. Granted, she was laughing
“For no more than a week, yes.” Lucius glanced at Draco, as if unable to stop his eyes from straying to his son. “Come here,” he said roughly, and Draco noted with startlement that his father’s eyelashes were damp. He was on the verge of crying. A grown man! Draco had never even seen his own mother cry. “I am no stranger, son of mine. You are a Malfoy
“Here, at home,” she instructed him, “you may transform into a dragon and fly on occasion, but only after asking my permission and ensuring that I have erected the appropriate barriers, such as this Disillusionment charm, to conceal you. In Hogwarts, however, when you do go there…” Her expression became severe. “There will be no transforming. There will be no flying.”
At least, that was what Narcissa had taught him. Except that now, with her neck curving around him like an embrace, she seemed to be indulging in sentiment, too. “Go on, child. Transform. I have removed the magical collar I had placed on you, a collar you must have hated as much as I once hated my own. Show me the form you showed me when you hatched. Show it to me proudly.”
Draco could not imagine nesting with a spouse so cool towards him. Beneath Draco’s moon-pale skin burned an ever-present craving for his other half, a half he was convinced existed within reach. For him, undying love was a necessity. It wasn’t an option.
, and only fifteen attempts later, panting and miserable, did his relatively smaller body rise up. He felt the rise like butterflies in his belly, a presaging of ecstasy, and abruptly, all his misery was replaced by excitement. He flapped harder, and harder, and there! The ground began to drop away beneath him!
“You have missed me, my hatchling,” she said quietly, the brimstone-and-ash rumble of her voice so longed-for, a memory brought to life. The most precious memory of all.
Naturally, conditions became trying very quickly. Reality had a way of rising to meet one’s expectations.
“Employer?” Narcissa sneered. “That monster would have killed Draco and myself for our hearts had he ever discovered us. If you had continued working for him, we wouldn’t ever have been safe.”
His mother shrugged, serene, her gigantic wings moving with her shoulders. Had Draco not been tucked within their shadow, he would have been knocked aside. “The world is full of fire, my love. It is up to you whether you let it light your path, or whether you let it burn you to ashes.”
Blue. All blue, her scales glinting like sapphires. She bowed her strong, graceful neck until her snout was right in front of him. Her nostrils were huge, each nostril the size of his face.
Not that Draco knew what a ‘mating’ was, precisely, except that it seemed exceedingly dangerous and not worth the effort. He was already four. He was wise in such matters.
Lucius grimaced. “The Aurors know as of today. As soon as I escaped from the Death Eaters, I visited the Aurors and testified in exchange for immunity from prosecution. I have come here directly from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The Death Eaters should be captured and tried within the next twenty-four hours, as the Aurors dare not delay the raid lest the Death Eaters move their current headquarters. Only when they are all rotting in Azkaban can I be assured of your safety, and Draco’s. Until they are incarcerated, I suggest we remain within the manor’s wards.”
Narcissa did not need to teach him how to do it; it was natural, like taking a breath after being underwater, both sweet and desperate, and he gulped and gulped and gulped. When he opened his eyes after shutting them (when had he shut them?), he found the ground farther beneath him, and his nose flooded by an excess of smells. His eyes were able to see so far and with such crystal clarity that he could see beyond the Malfoy estate into the township beyond. There was a cockerel-shaped weathervane on the steeple of the tallest roof.
Breakfast was new territory, as Harry was usually never awake before Malfoy left for work. So when Harry said a sleepy good morning to Malfoy, he wasn’t really surprised that he ended up with Malfoy’s wand pointed at his face.
Before Harry fell into a deep sleep, lying on his bed a few hours later, Malfoy in the spare room next to him, he thought of what to do. There was one more day before Hogwarts.
Harry was filled with anticipation and nervousness. There was every single way this could go wrong, but also every opportunity for this to go so right. He was ready.
“Harry, I’m going to ask you a few questions okay? Answer as honestly as you can, and if you’re not sure about anything just tell me. Will that be okay?”
Pansy nodded then put down her food. Blaise was silent, watching. “They told me it didn’t have my signature flair. Said it was more like…” Pansy looked right into Harry’s eyes. There was no malice, or hatred, or accusation, she just looked. “A lie.”
He knew he was being rude. But it still irked him how it’s been so long and no memories have returned yet. He is still Harry, he knows, but that Harry had just about
“Y’know Harry, I was so worried about it at first. How could I have such intense feelings for both of them? How could it work? But it did, and it is, and I love it.”
“What would-” Malfoy cleared his throat as his voice cracked ever so slightly. “What would you like to know?”
. We still remember the past 5 years even if you don’t.” She scoffed. “We know it’s not you anymore but did you really think we wouldn’t try again?”
“Send me a message if you need me,” Lavender said. “You don’t need to start any cases today if you don’t think you’re up for it. But you’ll be expected to be in top shape tomorrow.”
“You’re not him.” Malfoy cut him off. His voice was so gentle, so caring. “What are you doing, Harry? What have you done?”
When he looked up to the counter, Malfoy was there, smiling apologetically at him. Harry didn’t realise why until his eyes glanced over at the people beside him.
The next day was torture. The moment he sat down, a stack of folders appeared on his desk. There were only three cases, but the details made it seem like a thousand. Harry almost wanted to cry.
They walked out the doors, and the sun shone brightly. It couldn’t have been a minute past 10am, but the sun’s heat felt like noon. Harry blinked his eyes slowly, trying to adjust to the brightness of the outside.
“I’ll go find your healer. Stay here, don’t move.” Malfoy walked to the door, giving a glare that felt the same, but very very different.
But those two words were enough for Malfoy to understand. As if he could read Harry’s thoughts without even thinking them.
But the idea was all he had, so he kept to it. At least this way, he felt like he was actually moving instead of the sad stagnancy from before.
And with that and a hot cup of tea, he started walking out. He didn’t miss the chorus of ‘bye’ and ‘come back soon’ from all of the workers. He waved at them before going through the door.
