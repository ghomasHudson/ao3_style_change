Harry could see Draco going through the memories of the last three days and cross-referencing them with everything he believed about Harry beforehand. The blonde seemed to deflate at the realization that he was, in fact, being manipulated by Jashua.
"What do you want for a meal?" Harry asked, standing up and already making his way to the kitchen, but stopped abruptly when hearing no response. He turned around to find Draco sitting in the same position and looking at the floor. He wished he could give Draco some truth serum as well and start his own line of questioning, but he still had the third day for that. At least he had earned the blonde's trust.
Don't own the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
"I didn't know you were such a dog person." Harry teased, intending for a light-hearted conversation. He failed miserably.
"Scruffie." Harry answered, still in awe of the situation, and not wanting to say anything to upset Draco who was finally, finally, smiling, "his owner is on a long vacation and asked for someone to look after him."
Harry held both the blonde's arms, his hands disappearing under the glamour.
Suddenly, dark, quiet chuckling filled the room and Harry was afraid he had somehow tapped into Draco's thoughts and was hearing them once more.
"What?" Harry asked in awe of Draco finally speaking.
Big Mistake.
“R-right away, sir,” the blonde stuttered out, then quickly walked to the guy’s table.
Suddenly, a jealous rage tore itself through Draco and he needed reassurance that Harry was his and his alone, even if only for tonight. He put a hand on harry's, the one holding the wand, and the brunette caught the message and flicked the light off. As soon as he set it down, Draco attacked, Straddling him and taking off his shirt to let his hands roam all over Harry's toned muscles. Auror training had done his Harry well, not that he needed it. He was perfect eitherway. But it was nice not to see him starved like he was at the start of every hogwarts year.
“Uhh...specials?” the blonde asked, fidgeting with his apron a bit. The guy glared daggers at him.
"Where are you going?" Harry asked, afraid of the answer and the abrupt change in Draco's demeanor.
"w-what?" Harry snapped, enraged. Draco wasn't afraid this time. He was still and confident. Harry loved it. Harry hated it.
He simply didn't want draco to leave. He opened his mouth to say as much only to have draco cast a silencing spell on him. Upon realizing he couldn't speak, Harry started to sob silently, trying to understand what he had done wrong, what he could do to make draco listen to him. But it was too late. Draco had left the chambers, left Harry on the floor a sobbing mess.
"He'll kill me."
"Yes." he said instantly.
"Draco, there might be permenant injuries if you don't let me heal you." Harry told him softly, trying to avoid the same frightened look he received minutes earlier. The blonde only shook his head frantically, looking panicked.
"take off your clothes this instant and let me heal you." Harry had told him softly but firmly.
“It won’t. I can do this. I’m sure it won’t be this draining after the twins are born,” the blonde said firmly, keeping his eyes on his food and away from Harry’s pleading ones. He wouldn't let the brunette talk him out of this. He needed a reason to leave the house every day, or else he’d never step foot outside.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked him, praying he would give an honest answer. He eyed the vial of vertiserum that he hadn't taken yet and, for the first time, wished their situations were reversed. Apparently, he didn't need it though, because Draco started talking instantly.
Draco looked at him confused, then whispered.
Wanting Harry's forgiveness, Draco looked at what he had left. His breath caught. It was the journal Harry got him in third year to replace the one his father had destroyed. Draco had been so excited about it, he had shushed Harry completely and began to write in it right away. The brunette had stayed by his side, smiling and just staring at Draco lovingly like he couldn't believe they were together.
"Thank you, Harry. I really appreciate what you've done for me, tonight." Draco whispered, then began heading down the stairs that lead to the sitting room, with Scruffie in toe.
Only then he Harry realize his mistake. He needed to work on that if he didn't want to be caught. He didn't want to risk losing whatever trust Draco still had in him, even though it felt nonexistent.
"Y-you don't have to, Harry." the blonde informed him, but Harry didn't think twice before gulping the contents down.
The blonde sighed and let his hand linger over hers for a second then sat on the ground crossed legged. She joined him and listened intently.
“What are you up to, Malfoy?” Harry asked, ready to pull out his wand in case the blonde had a trick or two up his sleeve.
"It's not my choice. I've been chosen. I can't get out of it!" Harry told him frantically, pulling at his hair.
"Because I wouldn't agree if I didn't know about your feelings and, after today, I can't know about them."
"I'm so sorry." his older self whispered before darkness takes over.
"I'll see you next week."
“Oi, what the hell are you holding hands with Malfoy for anyway?” Ron asked, narrowing his eyes at Harry. The brunette froze on the spot. This wasn’t how he wanted his friends to find out he was gay. He also didn’t want the conversation to divert from its main focus; they needed to find a way to help Draco. This wasn’t the time for any revelations.
"please.." Harry whispered, letting go of Draco's arm, not really knowing what he was asking for but being filled with dread at the direction the conversation was heading towards.
"Listen to me, potter." Harry flinched at the use of his last name, but draco continued, horrified at the idea of Harry finding out about his tasks and the mark and how the dark lord was threatening to kill his mother if he doesn't succeed. "You will let me leave and you will leave me alone afterwards. You will not talk to me or look at me and you will pretend none of this ever happened."
"I don't need this, Draco. I don't need anything. Having you is enough."
" Show them to me!" he demanded.
"Hey.." harry said softly, putting a hand on Draco's knee. "It's going to be alright."
"I'm sorry-"
“I can’t do anything for him, Harry, at least, not directly,” the witch said, but continued quickly when Harry slumped against the wall in defeat and seemed ready to leave the room, “
"You know what? Sod that." Harry said, suddenly getting an idea he hoped he wouldnt regret, "Let's go out. I'll glamor both of us. You pick the place. How does that sound?"
No. He could no longer be burden on anyone, especially Harry after the war. He knew that's what Harry wanted just by looking at him. He was yelling at Draco, but the blonde knew he was just trying to get him to stay with him. He couldn't have that. It was his time to go, so he could no longer be a burden, so he could truly and physically be nothing. So, with one last look at his eyes, Draco walked away, thinking he would never see them again.
"P-please don't leave me." he suddenly started to cry, "I didn't mean to do that. I take it back."
"Harry, if he's already been to a hospital, they would've detected anything physical. This is the disease, man. If they say it, it's because they have exhausted all other options. I don't think any healer or muggle doctor in the world wants to tell their patient this kind of news. It's like 'we don't know what caused it, we sometimes know how to treat it. All treatments need a tremendous amount of effort and patience which you clearly do not have, and you will very likely get worse before you get better. But, hey, at least you know what's wrong with you, now, even if no one else in the world will understand it.' it's horrible, mate."
“B-but!!”
Harry eyed him with a puzzled expression then pointed at the door right behind where Draco stood. Draco looked at it for a moment, then thought of another way to get out of the awkward explanation Harry no doubt expected.
"so what, pray tell, would be your reason for conversing with him."
He slowly flipped open to the first page and was met with the catscratch writing that he saw the first time he opened the notebook.
"I-I w-wanted t-to s-see you, Harry. I-I swear it. Y-you have to b-believe me. Th-the p-prophet ph-photos of y-you. E-everyone th-thought y-you were h-happy, but I-I knew you w-were sad. Then, y-you were f-finally h-happy w-when y-you saw m-me for s-some r-reason and I-I thought m-maybe I was w-wrong, th-that y-you s-still c-cared a-about m-me even though I-I w-was w-worthless. B-but he-he was upset that you were there and he slipped me ver-vertiserum and I-I couldn't n-not t-tell him! I tried s-so hard, but I-I am W-weak and I-I c-couldn't and th-then he g-gave me th-the other p-potions and then h-he.. He.. I-I c-couldn't w-walk, b-but I-I w-would've c-crawled t-there, Harry. A-anything to s-see you h-happy again. I-I th-thought w-would N-never s-see y-you again a-at all and I h-had to get to y-you bef-before you left f-forever, b-but th-then your l-letter c-came and I-I should've known it wasn't from y-you. I should've, but I w-was exhausted and s-so s-sad t-that y-you ch-changed your mind s-so I started t-to cry. H-he hates I-it when I c-cry so h-he beat m-me up and l-locked the doors and l-left me w-with my l-legs broken. I-it w-was l-like m-my soul b-broke t-too. I s-still w-would've f-found a w-way to c-come I-if I h-had k-known y-you still w-wanted me to."
Draco looked away from Harry.
No. Draco spent too much of his pathetic life being a burden on people. On his father, who wouldn't look him in the eye after he failed countless times on death eater missions. On his friends, who didn't really understand why he felt down all the time. On everyone else, who had to tolerate his stupid comments that he only needed to say to feel like he was superior. It never worked. He only ever felt weak and useless. He was even a burden on harry, too needy and clingy all the time. It's funny. Draco malfoy was never needy, but he wasn't Draco Malfoy with Harry. He was simply himself. He always wanted his full attention. He resented his other friends for getting to spend more time with Harry than Draco did. He resented the whole Wizarding world for supporting a 17 year old on a suicide mission. Although, he somehow managed to make that last one even harder on Harry. It would've been much too easy to convince himself that Harry didn't even like him and that he would rather be doing anything than spending his time in the chamber of secrets with Draco. But Harry would never have that. He always reassured Draco and held him while he cried about another one of his father's discipline sessions. So understanding, his Harry.
After the dementor attack on the quidditch field and him fainting yet again after hearing his mother's screams, Harry just wanted to be alone. And where was he about to achieve that if not in moaning Myrtle's bathroom? Apparently, someone else had had the same idea, but by the time Harry had calmed his breathing and exited the stall, this other person was gone.
This wasn't the case now, he reminded himself. Draco was a murderer, a villan, and worse. A lot of things in the world mattered more than Harry's obsession with his cooking. Even if Draco didn't feel that way.
Draco let out a breathe he didn't even know he was holding, then continued.
"Are you daft?" he yelled. He didn't mean to. He was just too upset and frantic and would've done anything to prevent the blonde from walking away from him again. He was too much in thought to notice Draco flinching at his words. "They've emptied out your vaults. They've taken the manor. Your parents were sentenced to the kiss. They took away your wand. You have nothing!"
There it was. Not 'potter'. Not 'harry'. But 'the great Harry potter'. This wasn't his draco talking to him. This is the cold, distant, hurtful malfoy he'd seen outside the trials. Could drugs affect someone even after they were out of their system?
“I feel like going into the muggle world for some pastries. Care to join me? Or is it too early for a second date?” the brunette asked with the same wide smile. Draco nodded happily, forgetting all about the long speech of apologies he had prepared. The creature inside him was jumping up and down in pure joy. The blonde sighed in relief, somehow knowing that his inner veela would not bother him in the near future. If Harry just kept doing things like this...Draco might just be alright. The blonde couldn’t be sure, though. He didn’t know what was wrong with his inner veela, after all.
No job.
Pure and utter dread and hatred filled Harry as the potion's effects seemed to wear off with the blonde's consciousness. He looked... Terrible. His eyes had bags underneath them that looked to have been permanent. His robes hanging off of him held up solely by his shoulders. His trousers only held up by a very tight belt that Harry was sure Draco had somehow fixed so it would encompass his small hips. Harry was right. This had been a terrible idea and his Draco looked dead within his arms.
He had only managed one glance at the magazine before his blood grew cold. There, on the cover of the Daily Prophet, was a moving picture of Harry’s bloody body being brought into St. Mungo’s, a frantic Ron screaming at the healers, with the title reading “Harry Potter: The Boy Who Died Defending a Friend?”
"we hardly made a good couple, potter." Draco said, trying to reel in his emotions, and Harry was frightened by how much Draco seemed to believe his twisted version of the story. There was only one thing to do right then. Afterall , if the blonde doesn't believe Harry's words, he can hardly deny his own memories.
Draco felt very guilty about his threat, even if it was true. He knew the only way Harry would help him is if he thought he was saving him. But still, this was Harry and he had done nothing wrong to be manipulated like this.
Suddenly, Harry understood. At least, he hoped he had. The last thing he wanted was to make things worse.
Suddenly, Draco's eyes snapped open on the realization of what was happening. He was developing feelings for Harry. It was both a blessing, because now he could at least feel for Harry what Harry wants him to feel, and a curse, because Harry will eventually realize Draco is worthless and will throw him away. Then, Draco would be heartbroken.
Harry's eyes shot to the two empty vials on the kitchen counter. One was a severe sedation potion and the other....
Determination and compassion suddenly filled the older Draco as he watched his younger self jerk out of his thoughts at the sound of approaching footsteps.
Harry was frantic.
Harry's heart sunk further down if possible.
"Draco..." he starts again, but is cut off by the blonde, himself, this time.
"He. Never. Loved. You!" he continued, punctuating every word with a kick to his side. It's at times like these that Draco wishes he had a happy place to go to. At first, it was harry. Now, it's nothing and he embraces the nothingness as tight as he can as Jashua continues his assault.
So the brunette cast the best glamour he could given his limited experience and allowed the blonde to be taken away without a single word. He knew this was the only thing he could do with the older Malfoy standing a couple of feet away, but it hurt no less.
Before he could utter Harry’s name, the blonde felt a dark presence inside of him and somehow just knew that the veela would wreak havoc on him if he so much as said a single word about Harry’s behavior or disrupted their second date. But...that couldn’t be, right? His inner veela loved Harry more than anyone else in the world. The veela was supposed to put his mate’s needs ahead of everyone else’s, even its own. Was his veela somehow defective?
"No. You don't! How many times do I have to tell you that I want you around? I want you here."
"Killed by an angel" Harry continued to whisper, unable to stop the words from leaving his lips. Draco's overreaction, his embrace, the kiss, everything about the situation was so... Like Draco. Like his old Draco. "My Draco, my angel, back to me, finally. I missed you."
Frightened that he would lose control of his tongue, spill a secret to a wrong person , and regret it forever.
"I've seen it done to people in my chambers and did nothing to intervene." the blonde said. Harry couldn't tell if he wasn't trying to get Harry to let him leave or seeking out Harry's comfort. Harry went with his gut.
"because I can't leave here without being obliviated." he whispered calmly, though there were tears running down his eyes. Harry couldn't take it anymore. He recast all the locking and silencing charms and locked his eyes on the blonde, who seemed frightened of him for a second.
3. Make love
Draco smiled as he reached Harry’s table and took his order, a simple black coffee.
Harry knew he was talking to Draco as if he were a child, but he didn't know what else to do to get his lover to tell him wanted the bloody hell he needed from Harry to get better.
"Morning, mate." Ron said awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck "Hermione said you weren't looking too good last night. I thought she was exaggerating, but I can see she was downplaying it."
Warning: This is a very sad chapter.
Harry smiled at him, but it didn't reach his eyes. When the brunette started rubbing his back for comfort, Draco tensed. He hadn't been touched by another human being for so long. And this was his Harry. He shouldn't be feeling good about this…
He felt as though he couldn't breathe and he couldn't, for the life of him, move or say anything, even though he knew Harry was frantically pacing around him, trying to speak with him.
"Why are you doing this?" he asked the invisible brunette a yard away from the house. He didn't dare wait until they arrived at the house and risk Jashua seeing either of them. He would kill Harry. And Draco couldn't step foot back into Jashua's house without finishing the Sterilization Potion. He couldn't risk another pregnancy, and he needed to do this now before he talks himself out of it again.
"This is you happy?"
Draco sighed and looked at the floor, then mumbled something incoherent.
He was snapped out of his thoughts when he felt pure and utter helplessness and desperation. That sounded about right. Those feelings he knew well. Those were the feelings he associated with his memories. Only, they weren't his emotions. He continued to watch as Harry tried to speak to and comfort a crying draco, who was frantically tying his shoes to leave the comfort of the conjured bed and the chambers for good.
No standing in the muggle or Wizarding world.
Even when they were minutes away from the game, Harry only found himself to be more anxious, having jumped to steady the blonde after Draco had stumbled for no reason on the field. The blonde's eyes instantly snapped to where his father was watching the scene intently.
Harry was hurt by Draco's blatant dishonesty. Even in the wake of the blonde's accident. When Draco wakes up, Harry needed to have a serious discussion with him. If Draco wakes up…
"No-"
Harry groaned loudly and massaged his temples. He didn't want to listen to Draco's thoughts anymore, didn't want to know his feelings. He wanted everything to stop and for Draco to be alright. No matter how selfish that sounds. And if Draco couldn't be alright....
"You don't even know what I was going to suggest." the blonde grits out, impatient, and angry at Harry for refusing him every possible course of action.
"y-you were on my balcony dead today." he whispered, then sobbed harder, "You showed up one day out of the blue a year ago and took me by force after being so nice for some reason. You said you'd protect me, then you disappeared. Y-you y-you sent all those ho-horrible letters."
"M'sorry" Draco whispers faintly.
"If he kills you again, I won't be able to handle it. Please be careful. Please, for me. I'll die if something happens to you b-because of me."
"I am a lot to deal with..." Draco continued, ignoring Harry's words and looking at the floor once again.
Suddenly, Harry looked hurt. Very hurt. And Draco didn't understand why. Unless...
"Harry, I don't think-"
Harry gave Draco a sad smile then closed his eyes. The blonde was abruptly assaulted by weird emotions. He knew they weren't his own. Harry was showing him how he feels. There were no ill intentions or thoughts of taking back the offers. All there was was geniunesness and a strong want, no *need*, for draco not to pick obliviation, and then a weaker one for him not to lose the ability of having children. Not because of any twisted plans, but because Harry knew how much Draco had wanted kids and didn't want him to be upset if he decides that he wants them again and can't have them.
Harry told himself it would be fine, that Draco would be fine. He had a good day, despite it all. This could be enough for Harry for now.
“Magical documentations of bonds don’t lie, Mr. Pott-”
Suddenly, the blonde felt a sharp, burning pain in his hands and turned to see that his fingertips were morphing into talons. He held in a gasp and shoved both of them under his thighs in an effort to hide them from Harry, who was still sniffling sadly next to the blonde. Draco looked up and saw that Harry didn’t seem to be convinced that the blonde cared about him. Draco’s whole body shook with a different kind of pain. He felt a strange prickling sensation flood everywhere within him, poking him under his skin. His entire body was begging him to do something, but he didn’t know what that was. Not knowing what else to do, he surrendered his body completely to his instincts, surprised when they caused him to lunge forward and wrap his arms around Harry, who thrashed in resistance. The blonde gasped again as he felt his skin radiate an odd kind of magic. Suddenly, his mate seemed to calm down considerably and stopped thrashing. Seconds later, Harry broke down, his entire body shaking wildly as he cried his eyes out, wetting Draco’s shoulder.
" It's alright." Draco whispered in a more steady voice, "Only today left."
“D-do you know where Purge and Dowse is? It’s an old clothing store. Looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years?” he asked, trying not to give his desperation away. No muggle would understand why he needed to arrive at the location so badly.
Humiliation and Shane suddenly flowed through Harry and he was very tempted to take the spell off but he didn't. He had to know.
Afterward, Harry didn't know what to think or how to feel. Ron had abandoned him, just like eleven year-old Draco had once warned Harry, and Harry felt like he was breaking down. Everything was too much and he needed to see Draco so the blonde could make it all better. He had wandered into the bathroom and waited, leaning against the walls, far away from the sinks. Draco showed up seconds later and he looked infuriated but sad.
"I-I am so sorry, Draco." he whispered, reaching out to embrace the blonde, needing to reassure him that whatever he was afraid of wouldn't get to him, that he was safe, that Harry was there.
You said you'd had fun! W-why do you want to leave? I don't understand! Please explain it to me so I can convince you to stay."
"Draco, wha-" Harry started, but stopped upon Draco shooting him a pleading look. Harry cleared his throat and asked "What could I do to help."
Draco looked up at him with wide sad eyes and Harry just wanted the conversation to be over.
" I know that here." he said steadily pointing at his head, then moved his hand to his chest." But in here, I feel like a monster."
Harry stared at Draco, gaping, not knowing what to do, so he did the first thing that came to mind, and grabbed the blonde's shoulders, shaking them wildly, begging him to look at Harry.
"Are you hungry?" he asks calmly. Draco looks surprised by the question and slowly shakes his head, looking at the floor the entire time. Harry sighs, calls for kreacher, and moments later is sitting at the table with many meal options. He hopes the smell alone will get Draco to eat something. He secretly had Kreacher run out to get the blonde's favorite honeydukes chocolates in case the smell of freshly made food isn't enough.
But Harry had heard and he had a horrifying thought of what Draco was planning to do. He reached out his hand only to have the blonde step back.
Harry's chest felt like it was about to explode. He was desperate for any way of proving to Draco that he was really himself.
Harry nodded slowly, even though he didn't really understand. There were too many things he didn't understand.
“Er...well, what if he doesn’t want to speak to you? Could you still figure out what’s wrong with him then?” Harry asked, fidgeting with his hands nervously, sure that Hermione was just about to explode at him. To his surprise, she didn’t.
He expected it. He knew it would happen. So he wasn't too surprised when he found Harry apparting into their alley on the next Friday. He felt relieved. He felt awful.
"Can I ask you something?" he asked suddenly in a hushed tone. "And promise you won't lie."
He couldn't even get Harry a birthday present or send him letters or surprise him with treacle tarts on Halloween like he used to.
"You were speaking as though the world stopped when I left. Like you just couldn't move forward even though everyone else could."
Harry gaped at him, not having anything else to say. Those numbers sounded scary, but his Draco was different. He had to be!
He had hurt Harry. He hadn't even been there a full day, not even a full 12 hours and Harry was already yelling at him in frustration. Draco wonders how him and Harry used to spend days in each other's company and remained happy. Then he remembers: Harry wasn't happy, only draco was. He clears his throat then starts to speak quietly.
He grabbed the pencil and notepad that the boss held out for him and smiled at the guy, then turned around. There were a lot of waiters, trays, customers, people... Where was he supposed to go? What was he supposed to say? What if they ask him about things he doesn’t know? What would he do then?
And, there he was, a week later, approaching the same neighborhood. Draco had to suppress a growl. His Harry was too stubborn for his own good.
As he went through his stuff, he kept racking his brain, thinking about every single event of the past few days, wondering if anybody had been acting differently around him because they
Then, suddenly, harry's lips were on his own, whispering "don't you dare."
"You-you don't understand. You have to get out of it!"
Harry came out of his thoughts to see that Draco was openly sobbing. He seemed to be trying to hold it back given how quiet he was being. He felt awful.
“No. That won’t work, either,” Harry murmured to himself, looking at the ground. Hermione’s loud words snapped him out of his thoughts.
"No. These were the rules. We have to go."
"because I want to protect you!" Harry yelled, then realized this was the last thing that Draco wanted to hear when a triumphant but sad smile plastered across the blonde's face.
But no. They couldn't look past his broken attitude or him suspiciously disappearing or not wanting to hang out with them. He had four people who deemed him tolerable: Pansy, Blaise, Goyle, and Crabbe. Even they don't understand why Draco couldn't always just have fun and go to parties or meet girls or do anything normal really. Draco was always afraid.
"Do you really not remember anything?" he asked Draco softly, trying his best not to somehow scare the blonde off. He needed to get help.
The worst memories were that of the bathroom incident and the chambers incident before that. They had been blurred. Harry almost couldn't find them and he didn't understand at first. He figured that the memories were so painful, that his Draco had blocked them out, somehow. How could he not have noticed? Was he that horrible of a boyfriend? How could he not see Draco's pain that year? He did see it, but he didn't do enough, convinced Draco wanted nothing to do with him.
So basically, after the day at the supermarket, Jashua slipped Draco a fertility position without Draco's knowledge and Draco had only found out a day ago. It works and he knows that he could never allow his child to live in such a horrible household.
"I am NOT hiding. I am... Waiting for a friend." draco told him, looking away and blushing more at the use of his first name by his nemisis.
There it was! An opening. Now, he just had to tread carefully and not upset the blonde.
"Just... Keep going. I'll get there." he reassured the brunette with what he hoped was a steady voice. But Harry wasn't convinced and Draco could see he was reaching out for his wand, no doubt to cast a lumos. Then, Draco would be caught and he'd be on display, all faults and everything. He couldn't have that.
" I would NEVER send something like that!" he shouted and Draco flinched, then shook his head and began to sob harder.
" Not the same." he whispered," The Dursleys did that to you. I brought this on myself. "
“Is there something else you wanted to talk about without insulting my mate?” Draco asked, still a bit annoyed by the elf’s earlier remark. Emmyl just shifted his feet and looked at the ground biting his lip.
Draco silently walked back to the kitchen, with his head down in shame. He didn’t want to look up and see that everyone was staring at him. This was humiliating enough. He quickly came back and told the customer the specials, wanting him to order, eat, and leave as soon as possible.
“Draco, it takes time to work through these things-” the brunette started slowly.
"what?" he asks, although Draco am certain he heard.
The man threw off his cloak and beamed at Draco, then grabbed his hand and started dragging him away, blabbering on about some fantastic coffeehouse he had found near the supermarket. Draco opened his mouth to protest, but then noticed that Harry was dragging him away from Jashua's neighborhood, and could only sigh in relief.
"He loves me, Harry. I could never be a burden on him." Draco winds up saying, but Harry looks sad enough to have heard his while internal monologue.
" Thank you for saying that." the blonde told him, smiling. "Anyways we need to get some food for you Pronto. And I won't take no for an answer. Kreacher!"
“I need to investigate this. Thank you for your input,” Harry said, using the indifferent tone they were taught to use during investigations, “There’s nothing I can say to prevent you from going to the prophet with-”
"Liar!" Harry shouted. Draco's eyes widened further and his tears finally started falling. "You could just fix it here! No. You're lying, like you did when you said you'd back out if things got too much. You're just trying to get away from me and sodding die from hunger somewhere and you're using a fucking letter as an excuse. Well, I've had enough of your lies, Malfoy! You're not leaving until you eat!"
It was always one step forward and ten thousands steps behind with that guy. Now that he was feeling better, he would have never let his guard down again, especially with him.
His head was spinning fast, he couldn’t catch his own thoughts. He lifted his head and opened his mouth in order to tell him something, but he jerked towards instead, throwing up on the floor - on Harry’s pants, mostly.
‘An answer to my question.’
He got up and left the room as fast as he could.
For just a second, he felt grateful, only to be abruptly brought back to the reality of what was about to happen, and be consequently overwhelmed by deep, sheer humiliation.
When he finally emerged from the bucket, Draco was a mess: his cheeks were red because of the exertion, in sharp contrast to his almost ashen-like complexion. His eyes were bright and filled with tears of fatigue. He couldn’t stop shivering.
‘I-I-I had to… I had to change them.’
‘All this assuming that Harry-the-bloody-saviour-Potter is gay. A fact that has never even been suggested. Never. Your strategy is flawless, Granger!’
He sighed loudly, relieved now that the worst was behind him. He almost smiled. Almost.
The next several minutes went on agonizingly slow, but then he finally dry heaved a couple of times and stopped.
Harry was observing him for quite some time now, and even though Potter’s awful perspicacity was commonly known, Draco was sure even
‘Can you at least stop being so uncooperative and help me out?’ he asked annoyed.
Draco answered with a gag, followed by a retch, and another one again.
Suddenly, the unhuman gurgling of Draco’s stomach echoed around the room. Draco started to panic, the colour drained from his face as he fumbled to undo his pants.
He hated being sick, he hated feeling vulnerable. Most of all, he hated to be in need of help. Truth to be told, what he loathed the most was that, of all people, Harry “The Golden Boy” Potter was the one witnessing it all. Merlin, he would have preferred the Weasel instead, at least he wasn’t attracted by that loud ginger.
‘Go away’ he said as firmly as possible.
‘Let’s just say, it wasn’t pleasant for both of us.’ He answered, taking out the coffee powder from the cupboard and filling the machine with water.
‘I’m sorry…’
‘Oh, yeah…’
Hermione looked down, nervous.
‘For now, maybe he will.’
Under Harry’s supervision, he slowly sipped his tea and took two bites from a single biscuit.
Draco sighed, dropping his head on the pillow. ‘Shit’
But then, again, it was better leaving things as they were. A closer relationship – or at least an attempt at it – would have led to catastrophic consequences.
‘Eat? I hope you're joking ...’ The thought of food made him shiver.
Now was Harry’s turn to blush violently. Yeah, that conversation happened. He remembered attacking her, swearing it was all in her head, that he “absolutely didn’t like that prick”. He was a lousy liar.
Harry’s heart skipped a bit. He was torn apart: on one side he was praying the fever had erased all the terrible memories, on the other hand… He honestly couldn’t stop thinking about the way Draco asked him to stay. He wanted him to remember that part.
The mere thought of ingesting something painted a disgusted expression on his face, and the nausea promptly resurfaced. No, he wasn’t ready for food.
Harry couldn’t imagine how Draco was feeling, as he helped him strip down and climb into the bathtub full of hot water.
Harry was startled awake that morning by the loud thunder that ripped apart the dark sky of London. It was only November, but the cold, damp weather had already become unbearable. He found the strength to undress only ten minutes later and stayed under the hot water so long that when he got out, he was the same colour of a boiled lobster.
‘Yes.’ He croaked.
‘Ouch!’
Harry could see that saying those words was costing him so much effort, and he knew that was a big win already, but he decided to push his luck a little. Maybe,
The sudden heave made Draco lose control of his bowels. The following unmistakable sound made Harry cringe.
A roaring sound, some screams, the blast of hot air. He wasn’t just in the Requirement Room.
‘You have a few lines of fever. It will most likely increase in the next few hours, because of the stress that your body will have to endure and the unavoidable dehydration you will experience.’ She explained in a calm, reassuring voice.
And Draco knew Harry was sincerely sad about him and how he was feeling. He knew, that bloody guy was genuinely worried about his health. After all he’d done to him, after all the mocking, the insults and the trouble he put him through, Harry Potter was ready to put all aside and behave like a friend would have.
‘Hermione, I can’t go home!’ He said, his voice higher than before.
Harry sat up, ready to move if necessary.
‘I told you to leave.’
‘You fell asleep on the couch before.’ Harry explained, startling Malfoy, who was still a little bit out of it and didn’t realise he was looking at another.
‘Oh my, did I hurt you?’
Hermione stood there quietly, waiting for Harry to open up and explain to her what happened. Harry didn’t say a word until she had a steaming mug of tea in her hands. He finally took a deep breath and began to tell her the rollercoaster of emotions he had been on for the last 5 hours.
‘I know.’
‘Hermione doesn’t want to scare me, Potter. The short version is that a couple of hours ago I was attacked by a Sylphis.’
‘No, thanks.’
‘He what? You what?’
‘Yes. I was dreaming about that night, in the Room of Requirements. Only… This time you weren’t there to save me, and I fell into Hellfyre.’
He didn’t sound like an order, though Draco suspected it was supposed to be one. Instead, Potter’s request sounded firm but somehow gentle.
The two Gryffindor spent the next two hours drinking tea, eating cookies and chatting in a low voice, until Harry apologized and asked Hermione to leave and come back next morning, because he had some work to do and he needed to finish by that night.
He knew it was because of the fever, and the fact that he hadn’t eaten or slept properly in the last 24 hours, but he felt tears threaten to escape at the corner of his eyes. He kept them shut.
‘What the hell, Hermione?’ he snapped, after figuring out whose was the mysterious hand that just kidnapped him.
‘Please - he interrupted him - please... don't ask... Cause I don't –‘
He tossed away the covers and took a few steps, but he ended stumbling on his feet, almost dropping on the ground. Someone caught him, helped him towards the bathroom, which is only ten steps ahead, but it seemed a never-ending journey to him.
Harry stood there looking at him for what they seemed like hours, not knowing what to do. Something had snapped in him, seeing Malfoy so ... vulnerable. He realised the inconvenience of being there: Malfoy didn’t like him, he was probably the last person on earth he would have wanted to be helped by in that moment. The best thing Harry could do, was leave the room, giving Draco space, the privacy of puking his guts out without having someone watching him. Harry knew all that, yet he found he was stuck there, petrified. He wanted to leave but he couldn’t.
‘Expelled how?’ he asked, on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
‘So…. I’m sorry for yelling at you?’
‘Fancy a cup?’ he asked.
Harry turned his back and left without saying a word.
Harry didn’t answer.
he thought, slightly smiling.
‘I really mean it. You’ve been amazing.’ He moved away from the hug, because he wanted – he needed – to look at him. ‘Couldn’t ask for more, to be honest. The way you took care of me… I mean, I thought you couldn’t even stand me, so… And then you smile because I’m fine, and call me your friend and… But then again, the last few day, what you’ve seen, what I felt… What I’m trying to say is that… I’m glad it was you. I’m glad that you care.’
He wanted to socialize with him. Get to know him.
He regretted it as soon as he heard his own voice. He felt guilty, he didn’t want to sound like a jerk. That was the last thing Malfoy needed, being verbally attacked while he was having trouble standing.
Hermione nodded. He felt his stomach churning.
He was growing tired of being totally powerless in that situation. Malfoy was hurt and he had another 16 hours of throwing up, at least. He needed help but was too proud to ask or even accept it. Harry was doing his best, trying to keep his feelings away, behaving like he was expected to, like he didn’t really care. But he wasn’t sure he could maintain that fake nonchalance much longer.
“Aren’t you afraid someone might see us?” he asked before they exited their office, then smiled when Harry shook his head with a blush.
"Oh, so you think my fear over you and your impending death is cute?" Draco screeched and Harry couldn't suppress a laugh at how ironic the question was. Draco instantly turned red and started to sob.
"Myrtle!" Draco yelled, storming into the ghosts bathroom without so much as knocking.
Harry eyed the small space incrediously. Draco had always been tiny enough to fit in places like these. Harry, after Auror training, however...
"It's not like that, Ron. There was a reason I didn't tell you about him. But I will. As soon as he's better, I'll tell you all of it. I'll introduce you. You'd love him if you get to know him. I am sure you would. You will."
Harry didn't think twice about answering, knowing something serious had caused Draco to question whether Harry was really himself. Had Joshua polyjuiced himself to look like Harry somehow? Had he tricked Draco into saying something? Was that why his Draco was hurt? Guilt suddenly flooded all of Harry's senses as he quickly answered the frightened blonde's questions.
"I-I don't have it." the blonde murmured, shaking his head lightly, "Why do you need it?"
"No. It wasn't."
Draco said nothing, staring down at his left sleeve, reminding himself why he had to do this, why he had to be so harsh with his perfect Harry.
"You do, don't you?" he nudged gently, trying to get the blonde to eat guilt-free, "Then you also remember that I couldn't get you anything, right? I wanted to. I wanted to get you everything you wanted but I simply didn't have the means. A-are you mad at me for that? Did you think *I* was some sort of burden?"
"Do you feel like I am a burden on you now?" he asked, his eyes wide and searching Harry's.
“I know you’re doing this to get out of your shell and I am very proud of you for it, but...I’m worried it might get too much for you to handle-” the brunette started, but was cut off by Draco.
"Are you alright? Has he been denying you sleep or something?" Harry asked soothingly, but his rage was radiating off his body. Draco had to stiffle a laugh because Harry was never good at hiding his feeling, then a sigh of relief because the brunette was no where near the truth. He had always asked the wrong questions. Always assumed the wrong things. He thought Draco had gone back to Jashua.
"why would I do that?" he grit out through his teeth as they moved through the hall.
Harry was growing increasingly frustrated. Draco was always doubting him and it made him very angry at the blonde, even though he knew it wasn't Draco's fault. He prayed he'd be able to fight the potion enough not to let his negative emotions towards Draco's attitude show,
He looked down at Draco: he was retching forcibly on the floor while Harry was holding him up, in order to prevent him to face plant on his own vomit, and he was also shitting himself, every retch making him soil himself more.
Maybe the Gryffindor was starting to like him, or at least tolerate him. Maybe he was just worried he would have died under his watch, and Hermione would have killed him. Maybe he was overthinking it a little.
‘No. You woke up again around four, still agonizing. You could barely stand.’
‘What?’ he asked.
As always, a huge thank you to all the people that leave a kudo or a review!
‘You woke up in the middle of the night, screaming, in pain. I tried to help you to the bathroom. You said you couldn’t move. I insisted, and you ended throwing up on me.’
Harry interceded, taking Draco’s trembling hands away and lowering his pants. He did it as fast as he could, trying to avoid another “tragedy”. He sat on the toilet just in time.
Next morning, Harry woke up with Draco curled up in his arm, one hand lying on Malfoy’s stomach, the other one on his scruffy blonde hair. The first thing he noticed was the heat the Slytherin was irradiating, his fever already rising before even waking up. Then he focused on his pale, almost greyish face, his hair stuck on his sweaty forehead. He was still sleeping –
He moved closer to the toilet again, both hands now tightly grasping the white porcelain border.
As I said at the beginning of this story, I like to see my characters suffering. Which means, this is only the beginning for Draco.
As soon as he felt his feet take off the ground, the nausea got worse and a second later, when familiar walls materialized around him, swallowing became impossible.
‘Dream? What dre-‘ Oh. Oh my. The nightmare. The bathtub. Bits and pieces of information puzzled together came back. He had removed those memories.
Draco blushed. He was grateful Harry treated him so nicely, but the things he had seen… He wasn’t sure he could endure the possible humiliation, now that his memories were back and, sadly, not clouded by the fever.
be sure you can keep an eye on him.’
, Harry thought, looking at the scene in disbelief.
‘Malfoy?’
‘I think you should go to the-‘
‘When’- Harry was interrupted before he could ask the question.
Harry frowned, disgusted. ‘Is that the problem? You’re a human incubator?’
Harry’s hands caressing him, wiping away the tears.
Draco, who had silently followed the conversation, slowly got up from the bed. He glanced at the window: his reflection was blurry, but he could clearly see his flushed cheeks in contrast with the pale, greenish complexion. He took a deep breath, hoping it would help him feel better, but he got the exact opposite reaction, and a wave of nausea washed over him. He decided to lock his eyes on the blue tiles of the floor and started to swallow more than a healthy person would have.
‘What, for Merlin’s beard, was so urgent to be kidnapped in the middle of the day?’  He asked, placing his breakfast on a trolley full of coloured bottles - antidotes and ointments, most likely.
‘I don’t need your help’ Draco stated, sitting up slowly. Every movement was worsening the nausea, but he needed to reach the bathroom soon enough. He had felt sick for quite some time now, but he was waiting for Hermione to leave. Thank Merlin she just left, he was doubting he could resist any…
‘There’s some tea, if you want.’
Struggling, he tried to sit up, but just shifting on his side upset his stomach so much that from his lips escaped a long, painful moan.
He kissed Harry on his cheek. ‘Bye, Harry.’
‘You told me to put him under the cold water to bring down the temperature, so as soon as our call ended, I dragged him to the bathroom. That’s when he screamed the first time.’
‘We gave Draco a potion that acts as an antiparasitic. - Hermione explained - We can’t be sure about the contamination, because the kiss lasted only a few seconds.’
He felt the panic rising, the mouth of his stomach clenching. He kept running desperately, looking for a way to escape that nightmare.
‘No, you need help. I’m not leaving.’
What to say... I'm not completely satisfied with this chapter's outcome. Mainly because it is a transitional chapter, and I'm not a fan of chapter where nothing happens. But I thought Draco needed a rest. ;)
Anyway, thanks to all of you who kept leaving kudos even if this story was almost abandoned. And thanks to all who waited patiently for me to come back.
‘I don’t need a bloody help, Potter.’
Draco jumped out of his skin: he didn’t realise that Harry had left the armchair and was now standing on his side.
‘That’s not what-’ but she got interrupted.
‘No…’ Malfoy said, after thinking about it another moment.
Draco was now looking at him, puzzled.
‘You bitchy witch!’
‘You'd better sleep a little, if you can, because I highly doubt you'll have a chance tonight.’
‘I would stop worrying about the implications these two days might have on our cohabitation, and I would start thinking about the possible public humiliation you’ll have to face if you stay here.’ Harry interrupted him.
- because while doing that, you lost control of your body. You –‘
‘We made it to the bathroom’ Harry reassured him ‘though it was another nasty scene.’
‘Yes, of course! I can totally see that conversation going well.’ He replied bitterly.
‘So?’
‘He should be out of the woods now. Just let him rest, and don’t let him eat solid food right away. I think his stomach will be pretty pissed off for a while. If he feels sick tonight, call me immediately. But I don’t think he’ll wake up before tomorrow afternoon.’
‘Go away’
She hit his hip with her wand.
And the face Potter made just after he finished speaking was definitely worth it: his smile widened, and his whole face lit up. He didn’t add anything, leaving both of them lost in their thoughts.
Harry was gathering all his papers and quills, ready to leave his own room. Draco mentally slapped himself multiple times.
‘Leave it here.’ He said, blushing as much as his current condition could let him. When he closed the door behind him, Harry could have sworn Draco was on the verge of tears.
And there it was again, good old Malfoy. Always keeping anyone at distance, pushing people away because he didn’t want to look weak. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle: he spent so many years studying him, watching every move, that now he felt like he could actually understand the Slytherin. He knew what he was feeling, he knew what Malfoy was doing, replying that bitterly.
The Slytherin was practically on the other side, and he was turn on by a naked body. Like it was the first time he had ever seen a guy naked . It was the first time he was looking at Draco, though. So, he was partially excused.
Harry evanesced the vomit on the floor with a simple gesture – he left the wand somewhere, he honestly couldn’t remember in that moment. Draco murmured something that Harry couldn’t catch.
Draco gasped loudly and opened his eyes. It took him a couple of seconds to understand where he was, and then the pain was back, stabbing his guts, twisting a knife back and forth inside him. He knew where this was going. Harry knew it too.
‘Hermione, I’m not the person you should ask about last night.’ The intense aroma of coffee hovered in the kitchen.
‘You were sick. You needed to change. I won’t add anythi-‘ He tried once more, hoping he would remember by himself, dodging the story-telling moment.
Draco tried to move away, but he gave into the embrace after a couple of seconds. He was still too tired to fight and pretend he didn’t want any of that.
She faked a shocked expression, dramatically moving her hands on her chest.
Cry? Who was crying? What was he saying? But those sniffles he was hearing were his. He was crying. In front of Harry. Again. What was happening? He wasn’t running a fever anymore, he had nothing he could blame now. Harry had dropped all his belongings on the floor and was now sitting in front of him.
Both of them were brought back to reality by the unmistakably sound of retching.
PS. I think this story will have one or two more chapters, and than... "That's all Folks!"
He wanted to add something sarcastic, but the pain was overcoming even his attitude.
‘Jesus, Malfoy!’
Draco let him move him around like a lifeless doll. He was trapped in a nightmare and couldn’t wake himself up. The scorching feeling of shame was devouring him. He tried to remember when the last time was he ever experienced something like this, but not even when You Know Who was torturing him he ever felt so exposed. He prayed with every fibre of his being to be swallowed by the ground and fall into oblivion.
‘Of course I am. Now please eat something, otherwise Hermione will exe me.’
‘Hold on... Hold on...’
Harry bit his tongue: this was Malfoy’s self-defence mechanism, provoking him would have been totally useless. The guy was sick and
His day got bad as soon as he reached the kitchen and found the fridge empty as his stomach.
Harry took out two cups and poured the fresh batch of coffee. She took one cup with both hands, slowly moving it closer to her lips and blowing. The two of them just sat in the kitchen in silence, sipping coffee and listening to the rain that was relentlessly pouring down.
Harry winced: he didn’t notice the boy lying on the bed.
‘Why?’ The threatening way Malfoy pronounced that simple word made him shiver, both scared of telling the truth and
Meanwhile, Malfoy was avoiding his gaze, keeping his eyes fixed on his toes. Harry could sense the repulsion about what was going on irradiating from his roommate, however Draco never complained and let Harry easily turn him around. Harry couldn’t decide if it was because he was finally accepting the aid he needed, or if he was simply too sick to fight. Not that that mattered, he just wanted to clean him up before he felt sick again.
Then again, if Malfoy recalled what happened, he would have probably lost all the possibilities he never had with him. Hell, he doubted Malfoy would have shared the same country, let alone the same apartment, after what Harry had witnessed. He would have probably lost his roommate, too.
Harry waited a few seconds, then took the bucket he usually used to clean the floor and placed it next to the couch. He remembered Malfoy criticizing him, one of the few times they spoke together, about his cleaning habits.
‘Hi’ she said, sweetly. ‘How are you feeling? You sounded…’ she was unsure how to end the sentence.
He opened his mouth to thank him – yes, he was somewhat aware that he would have sound weird, but screw that, he was sick and he could always blame the fever.
Hermione got back to the kitchen soon after. He was washing the cups, his back towards the hall, his room, his roommate.
‘Potter, I don’t think I cannot force myself to eat any more than this.’
‘Let's go shower.’ He repeated, wrapping his arm around his waist and helping him get up.
‘As I was climbing into the bathtub with him, he screamed my name again. It was agonizing. And then when I put him under the cold jet he completely lost his mind. It was like someone was cruciating him. He was wailing. He was fucking wailing and I was…’
He spitted out, raising his voice, working himself up. His stomach dangerously rolled over, but he was too busy discussing with Hermione.
He hissed through his teeth ‘I need a toilet.’
Draco nodded. Harry’s tone had changed completely after his cold remark. And Draco was many things - a complete asshole, for instance - but he definitely wasn’t stupid. It took him a couple of seconds more than usual, but he realized it was because of something he had said.
‘I don’t think it’s enough. I stayed by your side for two days. And let me tell you, it wasn’t pleasant. And now you just wake up and go back treating me like shit.’
Cursing that never-ending storm that London was that week, he went out to buy something to eat.
‘If I threw up on you, why am I the one with different clothes?’
Harry was speechless. Draco wasn’t desperately crying like the day before, but huge tears kept strolling down his cheeks, and he didn’t know why. He did the first thing it came to his mind: he hugged him.
I hope you'll love reading this chapter as much as I loved writing it.
Harry hates himself for two reasons 1) his cock twitching at the idea of getting to touch his Draco again, despite the state the blonde was in, 2) he should've found him sooner and fixed him before it got this bad.
"I asked if you were alright."
The blonde stepped forward, placed his hand on Harry's shoulder and looked into his eyes.
Harry eyes instantly filled with tears. He wasn't even a bit afraid of draco's hold or his wand.
"what?"
"Draco.. Do you remember how many things you bought and made me during school?"
"I understand you, Draco. I always have." he said and Draco actually smiled, but it disappeared within the second.
He knew the question was coming but he didn't want to answer it. It made him feel stupid to have trusted anyone other than Jashua and let them break him. He mumbles something intelligible.
"of course" Harry replied, trying to reel in his anger. The last thing he needed was to have the blonde afraid of him. Holding his breathe, he cast the spell twice and let out a sigh.
He always used to cast an invisibility charm on the pile before Draco arrives, but in the haste of this occasion, he had completely forgotten. Harry saw the realization dawn on Draco's face and knew he had been caught. Draco knew about the locator spell, about the detection spell, about the thought and emotions spell. Draco knew everything Harry had done and was now looking at him with fear and hatred.
He cringed, recalling what happened. He was pretty sure he was going to die of embarrassment before the end of the 24 hours.
Harry realized Malfoy was still leaning on his hands, completely unable to move.
Next time he opened his eyes, Draco was feeling a lot better.
He often wondered if the amount of shifts they made him do was normal, orlegal, to say the least . Sometimes, he was positive he specifically asked for so many shifts because he wanted to avoid him.
Hermione's gaze fall on Draco, who was currently laying in bed, inexpressive. She was just about to talk, when Draco broke the uncomfortable silence that was filling the room.
The scene went on for a few minutes, and when Draco finally stopped, he rested his head on the edge of the toilet trying to catch his breath.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Go-‘ He was interrupted by a hiccup.
would have been the nicest way to put it.
He reached the door first, but he stood in front of it, leaving it closed. He realized, he had no idea how Draco could react at his sight. The experiences they shared the night before were too embarrassing for him, let alone the proud Slytherin.
He growled. He was angry, furious at the other man. He wanted to be alone. Alone. But the pain was growing every second, becoming unbearable, clouding his already much confused mind. He wanted to kick him out of the room, but let’s be serious, he was in no condition to do so.
‘In that case, the ejection can last up until 48 hours, and it can… – she took a few moments to find the least embarrassing term she could use –
He had to stop, because a lump formed in his throat. Hermione lowered the mug and moved closer, wrapping her arms around him. They stood there, in silence, for some time.
He sighed loudly.
‘Why?’ Draco asked, forcing the content of his stomach to stay put. To his surprise, he succeeded.
‘You are?’, Draco asked sarcastically.
Harry carefully moved his legs over the edge of the bed.
He was lost in his thought, when Draco decided to get up from the couch, bucket still in his hands.
Most of the times, though, he didn’t think he deserved it.
Draco woke up in the middle of the night. At first, he wondered why he was awake, but then a sharp pain in the abdomen took away his breath.
‘What… What happen?’ Draco asked at some point, almost asleep.
What could possibly go wrong?
Did he talk out loud or was she reading his mind?
‘Of course.’
Hermione walked past him, opening the door without even bothering to knock.
had notice, he was far from okay.
‘Why so happy?’ he asked, defensive. Now that he was lucid again, his defence mechanisms were already operative.
‘You don’t think I can take care of you?’
‘Yes, we should.’ The Gryffindor answered, trying to sound as casual as possible. But Draco knew he was faking it.
Draco had slept for almost a couple of hours, when he finally opened his eyes and looked at him with a blank, disoriented look.
Let me know what you think! Hope you enjoy!
‘I've already explained everything to Harry.’
‘Just those moments.’
‘How are you-‘
Draco looked up at the table where his roommate sat, and for a moment their eyes met. Draco immediately lowered them, embarrassed about the whole situation.
‘How reassuring, ‘Mione. I bet you are the most sensitive Healer of the hospital.’
Harry’s smiled faded away. ‘Don’t worry about the biscuit, but if it stays down, can you at least finish it later?’
Harry sighed, running his hand through his hair. What happened during the night wasn’t something he wanted to talk about. Merlin, he wasn’t even his story to tell.
Meanwhile, Harry flushed and filled a glass of water.
‘Because… -
Hermione sighed ‘A small incident happened, this morning. Draco will spend the next few days at home and I
‘Are you okay?’ Harry asked, his voice still drowsy, standing backlit in between his room and the corridor. Draco could only guess his outline wrapped by the dim light of the hall.
His voice was croaked and barely audible, and every word was costing him a giant effort. His throat was on fire – his cheeks would have been too, if it wasn’t for the nausea draining away all the colour from his face.
Harry regretted that sentence soon after: he hadn’t meant to say it out loud. He needed a coffee. Or two.
‘A Sylphis – began to explain Hermione - is a semi-human creature. It has humanly features and usually lives among his peers in small communities, which leaves only when it has to lay its eggs. It attacks only if threatened."
‘Yeah, of course. Why didn’t I think about it before? Talk!
‘Keep talking to me like that, and I’ll
‘I suggest you drink a lot and eat something, every once in a while.’
He looked at Harry, realizing the real reason why he asked Hermione to leave.
‘No one is telling anyone what happened.’
‘Yes, of course.’ Potter answered, and Draco saw how hurt the Gryffindor was. He felt guilty. After all, all Potter did was helping him, he didn’t deserve this ingratitude. But he couldn’t bare looking at him any longer.
‘Maybe you won’t tell. Potter, however…’
lucky. However, Malfoy was determined to ignore it as long as possible: no vomit before the three hours expired meant he wasn’t infected. What could he say? He was a dreamer.
‘Tell you later. Now you need to sleep.’ He answered softly.
‘Harry.’
‘So?’
‘I shook him a little, he opened his eyes but he was looking right through me. I shook him harder, but nothing happened.  I got scared and I called you.’
He was exhausted, he didn’t really have the strength to get up and reach the bathroom, but he knew he had to move soon, because that pain was only the foretaste of what was yet to come, that night.
Harry smiled. He knew where she was going.
Can't wait to finally give this story a proper ending!
Finally.
Next chapter is already work in progress, hope I'll be able to update soon!
When he left the room an hour later, Draco was still sound asleep. It was already dark outside. What time was it? It must have been almost dinner time because he was starving. Well, his body was claiming some food, but after the last two days spent witnessing streams of puke, he was less inclined to eat. He had to, though. Maybe just a cup of tea and some biscuits. He was halfway through his rich dinner when Hermione knocked at the door.
‘Do you remember being sick late in the afternoon?’
‘I think it was bec-‘
‘Yeah…’
‘Your fever is already high, and I’m not too happy about it.’ She said at the end of her inspection. ‘I’ll tell Harry to check every other hour, the last thing we need is to fry your brain.’
Let's just make Draco suffer a little bit more...
‘I’m an asshole.’
God, his name sounded so much better when was Harry saying it.
Harry was about to leave the room when Draco finally spoke.
Sorry it took me so much updating. Life happened.
‘Come on, I'll help you...’ Harry said softly, moving away the covers.
He tried to go back to sleep, but another cramp hit him, stronger and longer than the previous one: he was wide awake now.
‘Listen, you need to recover and I don’t want to bother you more than it is necessary. Just answer this question’ and Harry’s eyes saddened, all of a sudden ‘What were you dreaming yesterday? You were terrified, you screamed. What were you seeing?’
‘Yes, sorry ... Come on, lean on me.’
‘I’m grateful it was you, that helped me these last few days.’
Again, there will be mistakes. Just tell me and I'll correct them.
‘Can you try and focus?’ Her voice sounded like velvet. Harry never heard her use that voice. It seemed the same Molly Weasley used with her sons, sometimes. It was a mother voice. Hermione really cared for him, and Malfoy was letting her do whatever she needed, was letting her be gentle, was letting her take care of him.  The Mudblood he once couldn’t stand, the girl he wished to be killed by the Basilisk, was now one of his best friends – though he would probably never admit it.
‘Yesterday. When you screamed my name.’
He forced him to drink some more water, before heading back to the bedroom.
Draco was breathing heavily and there was a strained sound coming out at the end of every breath.
‘Fuck. Draco, I’m sorry. Shit. Don’t cry.’
He couldn’t be there. It was not possible. He needed to breath. Why couldn’t he fucking breathe? And was that just a feeling or was the temperature inside the room rising? He could feel his shirt sticking to his back, his forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat.
‘Don’t get mad, Harry. He was just embarrassed.’ Hermione tried to comfort him.
The saliva started to flood his mouth and he felt suddenly warm. Too warm.
‘Terrified’
Harry moved away from the trajectory but kept his hands on Draco.
He nodded, too busy not to scream in pain to answer properly. He was about to ask another question, when Draco’s stomach gave out a sound that almost seemed inhuman.
Not only he was about to spend the whole day hugging the toilet, but Potter would have been there to assist him. Bloody Potter. The guy he had try to avoid in every way for the last three months. The guy who saved his life more than once, in more than one way. The reason why he was living in London and practising Mediwizardry, not rotting away at Azkaban.
‘Was he that bad?’ Hermione asked, her eyes looked… sad.
A wet belch escaped his lips, while the little colour on his face vanished.
Harry shrugged. It was useless: even if Malfoy remembered, it would have probably meant nothing to him.
It took him a few moments to realize where exactly Potter had brought them, but as soon as he did, he obeyed at the request, grimacing: they had apparated in his bathroom, in front of the toilet, to be precise.
‘Can’t remember much…’
Draco just shrugged, too busy trying to find out a way to avoid moving to their apartment. He knew from experience – a really nasty one - that Apparating wasn’t a pleasant experience while being sick. He didn’t have a way out, though. His perfect plan was far from perfect.
Hermione huffed softly. ‘You care for him. He is one of the most important people in your life, even if you don’t want to admit it. What you felt today was absolutely justified. That panic, that punch in the gut you experienced in the last few days… That, my dear Harry, is called love.’
‘You two go ahead – Hermione said, leaving the room -I need to update a couple of folders and then I’ll leave.’
‘It’s surprising, though.’ She added, after a few quiet moments.
Draco rolled his eyes. What the hell was he talking about? Old habits, trust, keep telling him sorry…
He hadn’t considered Apparating.
‘Do you need help going back to the living room?’
‘I don’t know. I can’t… why can’t I stop?’ Draco was looking at Harry incredulous, like he had cast a spell on him.
– risk death.’
‘There’s no need to go to the bathroom,’ he said, trying to push him back down – ‘you can finish here. I'll take you to the bathroom as soon as you stop, and most importantly when I’ll be sure you won’t faint becau-
‘And you were right. As always.’
‘Kneel’ Potter ordered.
‘Do you need a hand to get to the bathroom?’ Harry asked, trying to be as kind as possible.
He felt like he was drowning, he was breathing but the air couldn’t make it to his lungs. Not enough, anyway.
To hell with denying what was feeling – let’s be honest, what he always felt - for Draco. He leaned forward, kissing his forehead as gently as possible, worried he could hurt him more than he already was.
‘A small accident, Herm? Can you be more evasive?’
I wanted to thank all the people that left a kudo for my story, I really appreciate it!
He led him to the door, and he was about to take the bucket away when Malfoy stopped him.
Harry glanced at his watch: time was about to run out.
‘You don’t need to apologise, Draco, I understand.’
‘Yes, but-‘
‘He doesn’t remember.’
She chuckled.
He didn’t want to make him feel guilty, but he was tired of his behaviour. He was aware he kept his distances because he was afraid of getting hurt. He understood the Slytherin. But he wasn’t willing to accept it anymore.
Hermione raised and eyebrow, silently questioning him. Harry ignored her: it was too early, plus the coffee hadn’t kick in yet.
Last time Harry came to save him. Where the hell was he? He tried screaming his name, but no one appeared on a broom, ready to save the Slytherin in distress. Oh my God. He was a dead man.
He was… He seemed extremely happy. Draco froze. What did he do? What had happened that night?
Draco knew where this conversation was headed. Merlin’s beard, he was not ready to have this conversation. Not today. Not never.
‘Are you okay?’
Too many to hope that he could just overlook them, ignore years of verbal abuse and physical collisions. Too many to even dream that something more than a respectfully detached coexistence could ever happen. Sometimes he just felt incredibly lucky to have had this second chance, both at life and at Potter. A chance he only had Potter to thank for.
Now that he came to think about it, he hadn’t seen him for the last 3 days.
God, this was
‘You scared the shit out of me.’
His voice sounded muffled, wrecked, like his throat was covered in broken shards of glass.
‘What?’
‘In that case, within one hour you will begin to feel a strong nausea, and in the following 24 to 48 hours your body will expel the dead eggs. The ejection usually takes place in maximum 24 hours and it’s exclusively oral. This, at least, in the best-case scenario.’
to be working there and Harry had to pity him enough to just ask for the potions, even if it was embarrassing.
"Why would you think that?" he asked in an instant. Draco merely shook his head and looked to the floor. Harry sighed and continued.
"be careful over there. Don't drink anything he offers you. Try not to upset him too much. Be convincing with the story. Please don't get hurt." Harry said in one breathe. Draco looked at him, then laughed and shook his head.
‘Let's go take a shower.’ He hushed. The words seem to bounce around the silent room.
‘Let's go to bed, okay?’
Harry gently lifted his chin, meeting his eyes filled with tears of exhaustion and embarrassment. He felt like he just received a punch in his stomach: seeing him like literally broke his heart.
Trying his best not to make a sound, he clutched his arms around his waist and waited helplessly for the whole thing to be gone.
‘Sure, as The Saviour wishes.’ He agreed, with a condescending tone.
‘That’s all, he slept until morning?’ Hermione asked. Harry had forgotten she was still there, too busy analysing all the reactions Malfoy was having while he was going on with his summary.
‘Don’t worry’ Harry replied, uncomfortable. But the Slytherin didn’t seem to listen.
The room was filled with the pungent smell of vomit, mixed with what resembled rotten eggs.
Don't get used to a daily update, I just happen to have some free time before the new semester starts. Enjoy it, while it lasts... ;)
Harry sighed. ‘I know. You already told me. Multiple times.’
Seriously, for being the two best magicians of their age, they were both trying to make the conversation as twisted and omissive as possible. His belly growled.
I won't keep you any longer.... Have fun!
Hermione patiently waited for him to finish, then cleaned up all and left him while he was drifting to sleep.
‘He screamed my name.’
‘Something else happened?’ She could read him like a book.
‘I forgive you, I swear’
Harry thought almost desperately. He couldn’t bear it another whole day. Seeing Draco like that was physically hurting him. Hermione was already running towards Malfoy’s room, when Harry reached and stopped her.
When Draco was done drinking, he took away the cup and helped him under the covers. He didn’t speak a single word, but before leaving the room he gently squeezed Draco’s arm, his hand lingering a little bit longer than it should have.
‘Calm down, Draco’ Hermione said, waving her wand around. ‘Come one, breathe in … and out. With me. In and out.’
‘Harry, shouldn’t you two head home?’
Draco was lying on the couch, his legs were drawn towards his chest and his arms were wrapped around his stomach. He had to be exhausted, because he was already asleep. Harry stood up and carefully covered him with a woollen blanket. He couldn’t help but notice, Draco’s forehead was dampened by a thin layer of sweat and, judging by his furrowed brow and uneven breathing, he was definitely still in pain.
‘Talk to him.’
‘No but. I do understand why you keep doing this. I really do. I did the same thing after the end of the war. Pushing people away because I was scared they would see… They would see me. All my scars, my fears, my weaknesses. My friends showed me I had nothing to hide from them. And I believe I showed you many times that I’m your friend.’ Another big breath. ‘That I care for you.’
‘Tha-thanks.’ He blushed. Hard.
‘But Hermione needs to know. And right now, I want to know too.’ Malfoy struggled to keep his voice steady.
‘Rinse your mouth.’
Draco kept pushing and pushing, unable to regain control over his own body, feeling the disgusting warmth running down his legs and up to his lower back, as he was simultaneously expelling everything he had inside – vital organs included.
‘He’s not there. We moved in my bedroom.’
‘Listen, I don’t have time now and honestly, I don’t know what to tell you anymore. I think that all the information I gave you tonight are more than enough to draw your conclusions.’
‘And?’
He was burning up now, too, but he believed it was only the shame eating him up.
‘Took me a little to bring him there, cause he was still moving, still squirming away and at the same time clenching desperately to my clothes. I don’t think I’ve ever seen something like that.’
‘I said there are biscuits. If you’re up for them. Hermione told me you should eat something.’
‘And the worst?’ Harry asked, well aware that he was a human magnet for this kind of bad luck. With him around, if something could go bad, it would have gone worse. Far worse.
Draco’s eyes opened wide. What the hell happened? Did Harry Potter kiss him? On the forehead, yes, but still a kiss. That felt so…
He kneeled in front of him.
Harry was still standing there, probably waiting for him to accept the suggestion he so cleverly gave him.
Hermione moved away the covers and chuckled.
He had to get up, he had to get up NOW.
Hope you like it <3
‘You threw up while… You know.’
If you really like my story, leave me a comment!
There was a voice, a husky warm voice that soothed him. There were hands, steady, strong hands, that dragged him in front of the toilet as gently as possible.
Harry just took the bucket from Malfoy’s hands and laid it on the ground. Draco wanted to say something, in order to break the uncomfortable quietness of the room, but he didn’t trust himself to talk right now. He wasn’t lucid enough, and he wasn’t sure he was finished.
He was a Malfoy. He was a Slytherin. He was strong, he was… He was stupid. He was agonizing. He needed help, whether he want it or not. Besides,Potter really seemed to be worried about him.
something was indeed changing between them.
Draco woke up again around midday. Even with his eyes closed, he knew Potter was there: he could hear the delicate rustling of pages and the faint scraping of his quill on the parchment. Knowing he was still there, after all he had witness, was both comforting and embarrassing.
Harry obviously entered the room and reached his bed.
Hoping that the worst was over, for now, he left the other man alone and went to clean the bucket. When he came back to the living room, Malfoy was sitting on the edge of the couch, bent over himself and with his arms wrapped around his stomach.
It turned out, staying was indeed the right decision. Around 4 am Draco started to shift restlessly into bed, waking Harry up. He wasn't actually sleeping. He tried to sleep, but every time he was finally drifting off, his brain rebooted, keeping him alert. It wasn't a problem, thought, cause he was used to the endless Auror's stakeouts he had to do for a living.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘The eggs are obviously poisonous for our bodies, Potter. If they aren’t expelled within a short period of time, we –
‘Listen… About this morning…’ Draco said hesitantly, but Harry cut him off, handing a cup of hot ginger tea. Draco took it with both hands, slightly shaking.
Harry watched him motionless, not knowing what to do.
‘What did-‘
‘Yes. Terrified at the phone, before.’
he was doing
‘After that, you…’ Harry stopped.
‘Leave me alone.’  He hissed.
‘What do you think you're doing?’ Harry asked, exasperated and annoyed by the fact that the Slytherin wouldn’t say anything about how he was feeling, or where he was going, or what the hell he was doing!
‘He won’t.’
‘Good.’
Harry had shrugged. ‘Habit, I think.’ And he kept cleaning.
‘You have no idea.’
‘Shh, don’t worry. I forgive you, okay?’ he told, still caressing his cheeks ‘I forgive you, I swear.’
Draco's face was almost completely hidden in the bucket and by his arms, that were wrapped around it, but Harry could saw he was in pain by the violence of the spasms that preceded each heave, and the white knuckles gripped tightly around the plastic edge of the bin.
‘Do what you want. I was only an idea.’ She puffed, glancing at her watch.
‘Drink.’
‘Don't worry, I'll clean up later. Let it all out.’
‘Nothing happened. He just… He asked me to stay. He was feverish, and exhausted, and probably confused. But he asked me to stay. I woke up this morning hugging him. And now… Now it just hurt.’
‘Call me Harry. After… After these last two days, I think I deserve to be called by my name.’
Which, of course, he did. He throwed up again while dressing up. One moment he was sitting on the closed toilet - big mistake - and Harry was helping him wear a hideous red and gold shirt, the moment after he hunched over the bathtub, spilling out acid bile and... frog – like eggs. He didn’t even have the strength to ask Harry to leave. But then again, after what he witnessed less than 30 minutes before, he figured there was no use sending him away.
Draco silently cursed the situation he was in, his stupid pride that made him refuse the help and Harry “The Golden Boy” Potter, that was just annoyingly kind-hearted, even with him. Now he had to find the strength to get up and reach the couch.
‘I know.’
He felt the urge to apologise, although he wasn’t even sure what for. Merlin only knew, how many items where on the “Things I should say sorry for to Potter”.
‘’Morning Sleeping Beauty.’
‘Why the hell am I wearing these clothes, Potter’
Hermione used her famous
In that moment, he couldn’t care about concealing his emotions. He couldn’t even care for Malfoy’s pride, which was the root of the self-destructive behaviour of the last 12 hours. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t been able to leave the room, leave Draco like that. Well-aware that what was about to say would have led to Malfoy changing house, maybe even country, he evanesced the vomit on the ground and on the sheets, although he knew he needed to change them afterwards - a spell can only do so much.
Draco didn’t answer: she was right, as always. Plus, he could recognize a hint of concern in her voice. Since the end of the war and the eighth year they spent together at Hogwarts, they’ve became friends. They often had lunch together, they shared notes, books, and most importantly, they shared life experiences. Ron and Harry knew Hermione and Draco were friends, and although they didn’t openly disapprove, they weren’t thrilled about this relationship. With time, however, they both buried the hatch and started to tolerate him around. At the beginning, it all seemed too awkward, but they found a way to move on and now they kind of enjoyed spending time together. Not too much time, though. Anyway, he and Hermione were friends, and for this reason he was aware that beneath that façade, Hermione was truly worried about him.
‘I mean… I could use the company.’
It was all he could think about. He turned towards Harry, that was uncomfortably staring at him. Was he expecting an answer? Did he asked him something?
Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes trying to pierce through his skull, as he wanted to see what Harry was hiding. He had to tell the truth, as much as it bothered him to admit it, he recognised Malfoy deserved the whole version of the story.
Harry went back writing the report he had to finish yesterday, but he soon decided to move to the sofa, in order to keep an eye on his stubborn roommate. He tried to fix his attention on the sheets in front of him, in vain. He gently stroked Draco’s cheek, hoping he wouldn’t wake up, because he had no convincing explanation about
She was much more qualified. He didn’t know shit about what you are supposed to do in this kind of situation. He couldn’t even remember when was the last time he was sick.
He was just dreaming. He had to calm down, that was only a dream and he would have probably woken up any minute now.
Draco nodded, his eyes halfway closed. He tried to collaborate, but he had no energy left. His body was completely drained. Keeping his eyes open was a gigantic effort. With the help of some enchantments, Harry took him out of the tub and dried him.
‘W- what?’ Harry’s eyes open widely.
Taking a deep breath, he went back inside the room. He was angry, he was disappointed and, most of all, he was hurt by Draco’s behaviour.
‘I c-c... I don't....’
He was afraid to fuck it up. He was sure, he was going to fuck all up.
Harry took a couple of steps towards the door, well intended to give Malfoy some privacy – even if it was clearly a tiny little bit late for that - but Draco had other plans. He leaned forward and retched that little water he had managed to drink before. He tried to avoid the inevitable by covering his mouth with a hand, but Harry moved it away, knowing it was absolutely useless and gross,and started to gently rub Draco’s back.
‘You’ll be done with this nightmarish situation this afternoon.’ She reassured him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘S-s-sorry…’
Several answers came up in his mind.
‘Get out.’
The nightmare's aftermat.
‘When I came back, he was tossing and turning. His breath was raggedy, and I could see that he was burning up. I tried to wake him gently, but he was… he was gone. I thought it was just a dream, but I couldn’t wake him up. I think it was something more powerful that just a dream. I think he was reliving some sort of traumatic experience.’
‘Then why are you so…’ she struggled finding the right adjective.
‘How are you feeling?’ Potter asked, trying to only sound polite, but there’s was an ill-concealed hint of worry that made Draco’s heart flutter.
Struggling a bit, Harry finally managed to bring him to bed and tuck him under the cover. Draco was already sleeping before his head was touching the pillow, but Harry stayed there for some time, stroking his hair, watching him sleep properly for the first time since the beginning of this dreadful ordeal.
The next 5 seconds seemed never ending. At the stroke of the sixth second Draco's body was shaken by a violent retch, followed by the revolting noise of the liquid that hit the toilet.
‘God Hermione, he sounded so scared…’ He swallowed, shaking his head a little.
His voice was lower than before. Saying those words out loud was a breach in his armor – because yes, he had one too. He waited for an answer, but Draco wasn’t even looking at him, he had his eyes fixed on his hands. He seemed indifferent to what Harry just said.
She walked towards the door, while Harry followed her speechless. She gave him a quick kiss on his cheek.
‘You honestly don’t remember anything at all about last night?’
situation. Living with Malfoy. Not even Professor Trelawney could have foreseen it.
He wasn’t running anymore. He was climbing a pile of randomly placed objects: some cages, tons of chairs and armchairs, books and tables. The pile was becoming bigger and less steady as he climbed his way to the top. He was surrounded by raging flames of Hellfyre, and he could feel the cursed flames brush over his arms, at the back of his neck. He was still climbing, but he was stuck in the middle of that damned pyre. He was going to die. He was going to burn alive.
Harry finally tucked Draco in around two in the morning. Harry couldn’t change the sheets – he didn’t even know where to find them – so they both moved in Harry’s room. Harry almost thought to go sleeping on the couch, but then he thought leaving the guy alone wasn’t the greatest choice he could make. Hermione would have probably slapped him for even considering it. He settled himself on the really-cool-but-definitely-not-so-comfortable armchair, doubting he would sleep at all.
He shrugged as if he was trying to send away an annoying insect. A totally ineffective method for what anyone –
exe you.’
‘Come on, let’s g-’ He doesn’t finish the sentence.
‘Yes, of course.’ Harry answered, leaving the room.
'Why the hell do you spend your day cleaning, when all you need is a wand?'
Harry was a bit hurt.
‘Please tell me that-‘
‘I really am sorry.’
He couldn’t blame his roommate, as he spent the last few days at St. Mungo’s and therefore the only one who used the food at home - and totally forgot to go grocery shopping the night before - was him.
‘I know that, too.’
He was halfway through the door when he unexpectedly heard Draco raising his voice. ‘Wait, Harry.’
‘Screw you, Mione…’
‘Good morning Harry!’
– would have classified as jealousy, but which he insisted on categorizing as nothing.
The chapter wasn't supposed to be that long. It wasn't even supposed to be that "fluffly". Apparently, I have no control over my brain... Anyway, I'm not 100% satisfied with the outcome, but I couldn't change it. So here it is.
‘Get out.’ Malfoy’s voice cracked at the end, like he was about to cry.
‘Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no. I thought that was just a nightmare. No. No way.’ He was shaking his head, as he could erase everything just by doing that.
Draco lifted his head and looked directly into Harry’s eyes. Tears were copiously running down his cheeks, his grey eyes were now flecked with red shards of ache and weariness.
you remember?’ Harry couldn’t stop himself from saying it out loud. Malfoy looked away.
A very uncomfortable silence fell in the room. Hermione was still moving her wand up and down, scanning Draco’s body.
‘I was petrified.’ Harry resumed, after a while. ‘I saw many things in my life, but seeing him like that was… I don’t know how to explain it. I simply couldn’t bear hearing his screams.’
It was like someone was pressing both hands on his chest, preventing him from taking a long deep breath. Was he having a panic attack? No. He was running. He could hear his steps echoing, reverberating through the pitch-black darkness that was surrounding him.
Draco was sitting on the floor, one arm was resting on the toilet seat and the other was on the knee. His head was being held up by the wall behind him. Despite still being worn out and breathless, he somehow found the strength to protest about the invasion of privacy.
A strange, gurgling sound followed his words, and Harry finally understood.
This time Harry didn’t follow him. However, ten minutes later he began to worry.
Draco said weakly, almost begging.
‘Give me–‘ he moaned, eyes glued to the ground. Harry placed the bucket in front of him.
But Malfoy got up again, ignoring him, and looked directly into his eyes for the first time since they had arrived at home.
‘And I decided to ignore you’, he replied, getting up from the floor and stopping at the bathroom door.
‘Yes. Worst case scenario. I went to bed. My bed. This isn’t my bed.’ He just realized. The already high temperature was clouding his mind.
Draco turned pale, only to rapidly blushing, as his brain elaborated all the information.
Draco turned away, unable to look at Harry, and shook his head, but the Gryffindor ignored him.
‘I c-c-can't move.’
He blushed, his eyes opened wide, still fixed on Harry.
‘You know, Draco...’ Hermione was tucking him under the covers. ‘I don’t think you should be worried about Harry. He’s a Gryffindor, after all.’ She joked.
‘What is?’ Harry asked, totally clueless.
‘By what? Hermione, please… I’m in no mood for these games.’
‘Rough night?’ she asked, starting her examination. Malfoy closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, curling up his lips.
He gasped for air when the icy-cold water hit him. He screamed like he was being tortured. Hermione told him it would happen, but Harry was shocked nonetheless. He held Draco tight, his back pressed into his chest, his arms blocked into his embrace. After what felt like an eternity, Draco stopped fighting and screaming, but tears were still streaming down his pale wet face.
‘Nice pyjama!’
could have worked as well.
She wasn’t serious. Not completely. But Draco knew he was playing with fire, so he let the whole thing drop. He enjoyed the quietness of the room and the growing numbness of his mind, which was helping him dealing with – or, better say, ignoring – the memories that were flooding back.
‘Time to go! I’ll stop by after my shift…’
Already feeling extremely tired, he decided to lay on the couch and try to get some sleep, while he could.
Malfoy nodded reluctantly, and he and Harry vanished from the room.
‘Yes, you keep telling me. But then you go back to your old habits. After the last 48 hours I think it’s safe to say that you can trust me, don’t you agree?’
Things start to get bad for Draco
Harry firmly grabbed his arms and lifted him up slowly.
But he never got to say a word, as he sat up suddenly and put a hand to his mouth, while his eyes wandered desperately around the room.
. He wasn’t annoyed, he was simply afraid. He was about to spend the next days close to him, holding his head up while he was being sick, helping him to bed, cooking him lunch and dinner. He was supposed to take care of him. Of Malfoy. Of the goddamn guy he had a huge crush since they started to live together.
, I helped you taking a shower. You threw up again in the bathtub, then went back to bed.’
There it was. The cause of his bitchy remark: the thin layer of shame that was covering his whole body.
Draco silently accepted the water: with the first two sips he rinsed away from his mouth that metallic, almost chemical taste. Then, in small drops, he drank the rest of it, hoping it would soothe his throat.
For a second, he cowardly considered pretending to still be asleep, in order to avoid any kind of conversation or further humiliation. But something, in the back of his mind – his conscience, maybe, or his almost non-existent pride – changed his mind.
Both Harry and Draco stared at her.
‘I can't move you if you don't cooperate. I just need you to try and sit...’
‘Sure he loves you back?’ Hermione interrupted him, rolling her eyes. ‘Harry. He was scared, he was in pain, and he called out for you. Why, for Merlin’s sake,  do you think he called out your name?’
The bloody Gryffindor he had once admitted to Hermione – Merlin, was he drunk that night – having a tiny little crush on. The same guy he was now NOT leaving the bathroom nor giving him any privacy. He was feeling so bad, he didn’t care to sound polite anymore.
, it was written all over his face.
‘Yes, please.’
‘What-‘ Malfoy wasn’t sure he wanted to know, but it had happened anyway.
In any case, he didn’t want Potter there. He wanted to be miserable all alone, he didn’t need a bloody baby sitter. Why the hell wouldn’t he leave him? He knew he wasn’t finished yet, his stomach was still rolling and twisting inside him like a Flobberworm.
He finished the sentence half a second before starting to heave. Hermione put the bucket under his chin, helping him up a little bit, and after a couple of dry heaves, he spilled out more eggs and bile.
He almost rolled his eyes: he stopped just in time, well remembering the last time he did that, the day before, led to an unpleasant outcome.
He freezed, praying Harry was already asleep and couldn’t hear a thing, but after less than one minute the door of his room opened slowly. Screw him and his endless luck.
‘Guess yours was a busy night.’
Harry didn’t say that out loud, but he thought it anyway. Taking care of Malfoy would have been problematic. Stubborn as he was, he wasn’t likely to accept any help, let alone from 'Potter'.
The truth was, he couldn’t care less: the damage was already done. What happened that night, it wasn’t something neither he nor Potter could simply forget.
He needed to drink something, he was already dehydrated.
He opened the door: Hermione, that’s who.
He noticed Potter had moved from the table and he felt a warm feeling that had nothing to do with his body temperature. Potter was still working, but the sofa was clearly less comfortable than the table. That meant, he moved because of him.
Hermione waited a couple of minutes before running a quick check on him.
The kiss. Harry's stomach twisted, and this time he wasn’t hungry.
Draco didn’t know where he found the strength of asking Potter to leave. His memories were coming back confused, bits and pieces hovering around his head, adding unwanted details. Now he clearly remembered the first time he had woken up: the stabbing pain, Harry’s hands on his shoulders, his clothes sticking disgustingly to his body, the fresh water caressing his feverish body.
‘Stay, please…’ Draco asked him, after lying down. A simple request, that made Harry’s stomach flutter.
‘Easy there! You need to eat something before even thinking about leaving this bed.’ Harry reached his side, couple of biscuits in one hand and a cup of ginger tea in the other one.
Yet he couldn't stop the words from flowing out of his mouth at the look of hurt on Harry's face.
“Huh?” Harry asked, confused. Malfoy furrowed his brows, still saying nothing about the nature of the purchase.
"Draco please!" he cried, "I'm sorry. Please, stop hiding from me!"
Draco said nothing, continuing to stare at his left sleeve, the mark underwhich the only thing that gave him enough strength to do this to his Harry.
The emotions hit him fast, too complicated and contradicting to understand at once. Draco was scared, relieved, worried, ashamed, and sad. But the guilt was the greatest. He felt like clawing his eyes out and shredding his face in shame of the terrible crime he was committing, but he was certain he would never regret this decision. Carefully, he placed a hand on his stomach and started to think of ways to explain himself before his child disappears.
"I haven't seen your diary, Draco."
At this thought, Harry only cried harder. He couldn't stand it. He couldn't bear to hear draco's mind being so cruel to his beautiful ex-lover who was frantically trying to comfort him, saying things that didn't reach harry's ears from around the clapping noises and vicious thoughts.
“It’s kind of complicated, Harry,” the blonde said, looking down at his plate. He hadn’t looked Harry in the eye since after their ‘date.’ He continued, “Do we have to talk about it right now?”
"Harry, you can tell me the truth. Do you have some kind of fatal muggle disease that's taken over your appetite?" he choked out, his horribly sad, wet eyes never leaving Harry's. Harry got so lost in them, he forgot to answer the question entirely and the blonde seemed to take that as confirmation as he tried and failed to hide the horrified look in his eyes.
"Harry, come on. I am not a complete invalid. I do eat. I just don't do it here."
"No!"
" I tried to kill myself again." he whispers.
"When did I hurt you, Draco?"
He cleared his throught, then spat "Potter".
And, sure enough, the red-head’s eyes instantly snapped towards the blonde, giving him a knowing look, but, to Draco’s surprise, he did nothing, merely looking away and shutting his eyes.
He doesn't know why he said it and he doesn't care about harry's hurt expression. Harry was threatening to keep him there moments before and he needed to jump at any chance to leave. He could never come back here. Harry was bad and dangerous.
"W-what?" he asked frantically, not knowing how to phrase his question, too confused by the blonde's behavior and words. All he wanted was to get back to sixth year and stop Draco from breaking up with him. All he wanted was to turn back time for a second so he could change everything, but he couldn't. The ministry destroyed all time turners and it's too late eitherway. He could feel his Draco slipping through his fingertips and he was once again powerless to stop it.
Draco didn't even move from where Harry had thrown him, too petrified to do anything. The memories were still playing in his mind and, no matter how hard he wanted to apologize to Harry, not a single muscle in his body would bloody work. He couldn't even move his hands to stifle the sobs that were escaping his mouth. He was barely aware of his surroundings, of Harry rushing over to him the second he shoved him away, whispering 'its going to be alright' in his ear.
Without waiting for permission, Draco flipped Harry over and swallowed him whole in one go, trying his best not to gag around Harry's thick and long cock. Harry arched up and groaned, but Draco placed his hands on either side of Harry's hips to keep him steady. He tried his best to keep Harry distracted from the tears landing on his groin and cupped his balls, squeezing and massaging them. It seemed to have worked, since Harry put both his hands on draco's head and gently pulled his hair.
Draco's letters were the only light spot in his summer and he was glad he hadn't yet been caught sending Hedwig off from Dudley's unbarred window. It felt like the most wonderful freedom he could have in that prison. He had carefully avoided answering any questions the blonde had about his home life and if Draco had noticed, he didn't say anything.
It had been two weeks since draco stood Harry up. Even Ron wasn't finding it funny anymore that he keeps showing up to work 'hung over'. Him and Hermione kept obessesing over him like some child whose puppy just died. They never found out about him and draco and he couldn't bring himself to tell them how stupid he was to think it would last.
“I’m fine. Let’s go before our lunch break ends,” Draco said, then grabbed Harry’s hand and quickly dragged him into the nearest pastry shop.
Harry’s chest clenched at the blonde’s words and at the look of sheer despair on Draco’s face. He wanted to help Draco like Draco had been helping him. He wanted to take his pain away, but none of the blonde’s words made any sense to Harry. How could he help fix a problem when he didn’t even know what it was?! Then, it hit him.
“Plenty of parents have agoraphobia. They work around it. You can take care of them from in here until you’re able to take them outside-” Harry started, still trying to convince the blonde. Draco immediately shook his head at the suggestion, his eyes burning with unshed tears. He didn’t want to talk about this anymore. He needed to convince the brunette that this was for the best and get him to drop it forever.
Still, Harry's words just broke Draco's heart.
Draco was stunned. Was Harry serious? He was really giving Draco control? This couldn't be...there had to be some kind of catch. Or maybe he'd give the blonde everything then take it away just to torture him. Yeah. That sounds right. Harry wants Draco here. The blonde didn't need to enjoy being there so that Harry can be satisfied. He just needed to stay with Harry and then Harry could do whatever he was planning to.
"Look, Harry, whatever it is, I am sure it will be fine. Please calm down. I-I am just going to go down to the dungeons for one second to fix this and I'll be right back. Please don't leave. I meant what I said. We'll talk about everything. I just need to fix this, alright?"
"Myrtle?"
“You could do nothing but apologize to Draco immediately!” Harry yelled, interrupting him.
Harry's heart broke at his words. Not what he was saying, but the way he spoke, as if Harry was any other person, as if he needed to thank him, as if they had never been together before that fateful event in Myrtle's bathroom.
The blonde seemed frantic, pulling at his sleeves and looking all over Harry's body again. Then, he took Harry’s hands and placed them on his own chest, sitting the brunette down against the wall again, just the opposite of how they had been sat before leaving for the summer. Draco smiled at Harry and started to whisper shakily.
"Now I know you're my Harry!" Draco squeaked between laughs, "Y-you're positively seething with rage, yet you're trying to make it sound like you're casual just to respect my wishes even though you're bloody gritting your teeth. Do you even realize what a horrible liar you are? This is so bloody funny!"
"Harry?" Draco asked softly. Harry immediately looked up with a forced smile, trying to pretend that he hadn't horribly violated draco's privacy the day before and wasn't horrified at what he had found. "could you do me a favor?"
"No!" he had yelled.
3) harry's thoughts are in bold italics and draco's are in italics.
Only that statement could've snapped Draco out of his thoughts about harry's dishonesty. He had started to shake his head wildly at the thought of hurting Jashua who had been nothing but honest with him since he told Draco he knew who he was and didn't want to scare him off by telling him so soon after an attempt.
Draco covered back at the wall, frightened, before he saw that it was Harry and became calmer. Suddenly, Harry was being engulfed in an extremely tight hug by the blonde, who kept whispering apologies in Harry's ear.
Then, he cast another spell, hating himself for it but knowing this was yet another emergency.
"I am sorry I scared you, baby. I didn't mean to. I was just angry. But I would never hurt you. You know that, right?"
"I-I" the blonde starts and lifts his head. Upon seeing the look in Harry's eyes, however, he suddenly straightens up, and all emotions leave his face. Harry barely suppresses a growl of frustration.
The scene shifted, and suddenly, he was seeing himself mortified after having kissed a crying Harry at the beginning of fourth year, after his so-called best friend abandoned him, and Harry looking at the blonde, astonished.
“I know,” the blonde said quietly, then continued when he noticed that the brunette only looked more confused, “I-I mean, I know, but I don’t really know. It’s complicated, Harry. I-I think my illness has taken a turn for the worse.”
“Yes, thank you! I’ve been looking forever!” the blonde cheered. The guy nodded, then leaned in slightly and whispered.
Harry couldn't help but smile as Draco proceeded to feed him. Actually feed him! Like he used to do after Harry came back from yet another summer with the Dursleys. Only this time, it was forced and demanding, it was soothing and gentle. He couldn't help but notice that the blonde hadn't touched his own plate and frowned deeply. Draco followed his gaze then threw Harry's fork down with a huff.
“Those damn Dursleys!” Ron yelled as Harry sat in front of him fidgeting with his hands and looking at the ground. He hadn’t said anything, hadn’t wanted to say anything and was sure Ron would only make him feel worse. He loved his best friends dearly, but some things just aren’t for some people’s ears.
“Calm down, mate.” Draco whispered, then started stroking Harry’s muscular arm in a comforting gesture. He didn’t know what made him say it; it just came out instinctively and it seemed to be helping Harry somehow. The brunette stopped shaking so badly and obliged when the blonde asked him to sit on the couch.
" Draco!"
Apparently, Harry’s devastation showed on his face, because Hermione’s face had softened and her words had a more gentle tone when she started to speak again.
Harry knew Ron's family wasn't big among traditional purebloods and nothing good could've come from the writer's father finding out. He had to know what happened next, so he kept reading well past bed time, but there was another thought at the back of his mind that he couldn't get rid of.
"I am not a liar, Harry! I've never lied to you. I did plan on eating and I still am-"
Draco immediately stiffened upon hearing Jashua's voice and words in his mind. He tried to continue his work, but he could feel Harry's hands on his shoulders, trying to push him away.
"I'll kill him!" he snapped, unable to hold back. He stood up and started pacing around the sitting room, oblivious to the frightened expression on the blonde's face. "who does this guy think he is? Fucking jackass, monster rapist who beats up his partners? That's just weak. He's... He's... Gods, I don't even know a curse strong enough to describe him. I'll go back there then grab him by his pretty hair and smile when he screams no, then I'll drag him all the way to the aurors office. I'll fill in the report and watch him and his reputation be destroyed in front of the entire Wizarding world. He won't feel so powerful then. I'll spit on his face, I will and I'll tell the guards to keep his clothes from him for a while, just so he can feel what it's like to be on display. I'll love every minute of it!"
"do you want anything?"
“So, if there is no problem with...physical arousal, just with being attracted enough to my partner for the physical arousal to happen, this potion should work, right?” The brunette whispered, looking down at the ground in shame and shifting from one foot to another.
I don't own the characters or anything. Rowling does. Enjoy!
I was planning the last ten chapters to center around Draco's recovery, but these two just came to me and I felt like Harry wouldn't really be alright after everything and just be convinced that Draco was back and fine. I think the story makes more sense with these insights into Harry's mind. Anyway, it's going to be about both of them from now on. Hope you liked the chapter!
