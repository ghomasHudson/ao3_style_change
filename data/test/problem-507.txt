“He’s coming back.” Harry tells them. He clears his throat when his voice comes out weak and crackly. “I swear it, even if I have to break him out of prison myself.”
For now, I think I'll be posting what I have written so far in ~5K chapters, but we'll see how long that lasts lol. I try to avoid breaking things into two chapters but some of these scenes are looong...
“Seriously?” Harry asks in surprise. He’d assumed Malfoy’s confidence came from the ease of everything, but he should’ve known better. Things haven’t been easy for Malfoy in a long time.
“I’m not saying you’re wrong, but can you imagine how jealous you’ll be when you’re not the centre of attention?” Astoria says with a growing smile. Draco grins.
“I’m so sorry, Draco.” Narcissa says, hands fluttering for a moment before she decides against touching him anywhere but his hair.
Draco only scowls at the table. He waits a moment, then pulls out his notebook, writing in it for a moment before putting it away and scowling some more.
Draco joins Harry in the bedroom some time later, fresh ink on his fingers. He sets his new wand, notebook, flattened ankle band and fountain pen beneath his pillow.
As Blaise continues to pet Draco, he has a very difficult time coming up at all, and instead decides to just fall asleep until someone needs him.
“Okay…” Ashe opens her book and finds a chart, dragging her finger across to find the proper dosage for Draco.
“If you open them, you can smell what they’re flavoured with. Take the lid off and give them a sniff.”
Madam Pomfrey, a bandage wound tightly around her own shoulder, was hurrying around and assessing damage, making sure the most injured were treated first.
“Don’t be, it’s one of your best qualities.” Draco says with a haughty air betrayed by the fond look he's giving Harry.
“Are you alright?” Malfoy asked, looking over his shoulder. Harry could only stare at the ugly yellow mark on his cheek.
Harry suggests a few when they find the chocolate section, and Draco grabs a few of each that Harry’s pointed out.
“Potter said that to me a bit ago. He said he reckons you’d be good at security given you kept me alive through school.”
“I’m 100% certain he’d still post stuff like this whether or not he’s being regularly shagged.” Harry says. “In fact, I would be surprised if he
Draco shoves aside the wrappings on the floor already to make room and pulls the first gift off the top.
“That will depend on Draco. I believe the amount of time will vary depending on the rule, how frequently he interacts with that subject. As he typically doesn’t feel the need to use glamours, he likely won’t even notice this one is gone for some time.”
Draco says this just as they’re passing by the Great Hall, so Harry faces him, putting his hands on Draco’s hips and walks him backward until Draco’s back hits the doorway of the Hall.
“I’m going to tell Ron.” Harry says as they leave the kitchen with full stomachs, hands intertwined.
. Or hear about someone finding it. And know that I lost another person because of a war. One I could’ve saved.” Harry whispers, swiping at his cheeks. Draco’s face doesn’t move, even as his eyes track the tears rolling down Harry’s face.
"You've been through much scarier things, a meal with Potter isn't something you need to worry about. It'll be just fine."
“Maybe it’s the Durmstrangs arriving. I didn’t think they’d be here so soon, though. We’ve only just returned today.”
Draco tosses his suitcase aside and puts his case on the counter, clicking it open as he turns to examine the curse victim.
Greg and Astoria’s conversation is a distant murmur to Draco like this, and the only thing he’s focused on is Greg’s big warm hand moving along Draco’s torso and arms, gentle but firm.
“Did you?” Harry asks curiously. Draco has never wanted to talk about his nightmares, so Harry thinks this must be a good dream. “Would you like to tell me about it?”
Vase after vase of red tulips covered nearly every surface. Harry wondered where all of them came from, as he hasn’t seen them in the gardens before, and surely he would’ve noticed this quantity growing somewhere.
“Okay okay, fair enough. But isn’t it less tiring to be here with me than flirting with some businessman?” Harry asks.
It takes a second for the sound to reach Harry’s ears, but he realises Malfoy’s singing about a minute after he hears it.
“Will you tell me what they mean?” Harry asks, sitting on the ground on the other side of the hedge Draco was crouched behind. He takes the offered lemon blossom branch. It is indeed fragrant.
They go home, arriving well after midnight. Draco is exhausted and Harry isn’t much better, so he’s grateful to Hermione for Apparating them there with Ron.
Harry cringes when he sees the moving picture of himself dancing with Meredith’s head on his shoulder. He can’t help but note how… content both of their faces look. Meredith has her eyes closed and is smiling faintly.
“You didn’t take advantage of me. Like I told you then, I was conscious and clear-headed enough to make decisions. Took a lot for me to get drunk.” Malfoy says, then smirks. “And I did enjoy it. Violent though it was.”
“You haven’t made time for it.” Shannon says plainly. “Let’s talk more about ‘nice breakfasts.’ Did you cook things for yourself before Draco started living with you? Like scones or waffles?”
Draco winks up at Harry, and whilst he’s distracted by that shocking-and-arousing bit of information, takes them to find drinks.
He acted differently, as well. He hadn’t spoken a word out loud that anyone had heard since his arrival. His face was still, no expression, eyes darting around while his face stayed looking directly ahead. He didn’t react if anyone tried taunting him, just acted as if he hadn’t heard.
“Fuck!” Potter swears, snatching his broom out of the air and kicking off even before he gets his other leg over it.
Draco glares at Ashe for a second as he adjusts his suede Greg jacket to sit properly on his shoulders.
“You’re a good man for doing this, Harry. I don’t think he would’ve, if it had been the other way around.” Hermione frowns.
Draco squints through one of the sheer curtains. There’s a young man, probably a bit older than Draco but not by much, leaning on the end of the bar, his body angled toward the significantly older man on the barstool.
Draco wonders if everyone is going to try to get him talking about his sex life now, just for the accompanying embarrassing anecdote.
“It’s a good angle for me too.” Harry says with a grin, running his hands along Draco’s sides, hips and thighs.
Harry received an owl from Hermione telling him and Draco to be present in the morning at the Ministry for the club trials.
“You were pretty rotten at paying attention to the Snitch.” Harry says. “It buzzed right by your head once and you didn’t notice because you were focused on me.”
“We’ll put Fred back in it, I suppose. We were going to just try the way we used to do it, and hope for the best.” George says.
I Will not apologise for this extremely long chapter, I could not break it up in a way that flowed well so read it in shifts ig lol
“Nope.” Malfoy says, making a triumphant noise as he pulls a long sleeved shirt from the depths of his trunk. He pulls off his jumper to put the shirt on underneath. “Pansy’s going to France.”
“Bloody hell.” Ron mumbles, leaning against the sink. “I came because we’ve got a briefing this evening for the club raid later this week. Thought you might have some information for us.”
has certainly gotten the hang of it, he can dance just as easily in heels as in any other sort of shoe. Harry certainly isn’t jealous.
Draco waves his wand at them, and the items fly from their bags and into the kitchen, where Harry can hear cupboards and the refrigerator door opening and closing.
“Right, it’s a good thing you’re better with duels than potions or the lot of us would be in trouble.” Draco teased. Harry grinned.
for Harry to finally reach his cock itself, and he grabs it in one hand, rubbing up and down the shaft with his thumb. Draco whines.
Ron runs through the case specifics, though from the looks of things, not for the first time. When he gets to some more detailed parts of the plan, some of the aurors start chipping in their ideas.
“It’s a Furby, I gave it to him but with all the magic, it’s become sentient. Probably came to get out of the storm.” Harry explains.
“Knew it.” Malfoy smirks, groping around for his wand, which he uses to clean Harry’s hands for him.
“Harry, what in Merlin’s beard are you doing?” Neville asks, surveying the chaos of their shared kitchen.
“I’ve got a chicken in the oven.” Astoria says, spooning potatoes and green beans out onto a plate. “Greg will be home any minute.”
He has vague memories of his childhood, of playing in a garden or spending time with his friends. Not strong enough.
“Being talked about… or treated like he’s… I don’t know, incapable. Or like he’s not listening. He’s always listening, by the way, anytime he’s in earshot. Might not seem like it, but he is.”
With a smirk, Potter pours some onto his fingers whilst Draco shimmies his trousers and pants down and off one leg.
“You don’t know what rimming is, do you.” Harry says with a small smile. Draco flushes and pulls his hands away.
“I did not want you to read my notebook because I was writing all the things to tell Shannon so I would not have to talk so much.” Draco begins.
When the trip comes to an end, he’s feeling warm and fuzzy, and Draco seems to agree, curling up on Harry’s shoulders and purring contentedly while they journey back home.
the founder and benefactor. He wrote me asking me to run things, his letter said it was because I had a good track record and was muggleborn myself."
It goes fairly well, all things considered. Draco sucks as much as he can, Harry warns him briefly before spilling into his mouth with a gasp and a moan, and Draco pulls back smiling, wiping at his lips in success.
“It was beautiful.” Ron sobs, swiping at his cheeks. Harry laughs and pulls his best friend into a bone-crushing hug.
The haze fades from his eyes, and he looks down at Harry like he’s surprised to see him, as if he’s not aware he was conversing with Harry just seconds ago. Harry pushes him off his lap again, helping him stand, then getting up himself.
“That’s when there’s one thing that happens, not when you’ve already lost nearly 22 years of memories already!”
Harry goes to get the door, but as it turns out, they’d planned in vain. It’s only the postman with a parcel, which Harry signs for.
Harry crawls over to Draco slowly, and Draco watches without moving. Harry pulls him close, crushing him to his own body.
“Oh yeah, we started inviting other years, and once, we invited the Ravenclaws so all the Slytherins could do a chorus of
“I’ve soundproofed your room, no one could hear you. Got the idea after your screaming was disturbing the employees. As it seems, there’s more than one use for it.”
“No, she was just leaving.” Malfoy says, looking at his mother, who gazes back at him with equal strength.
“So whenever you want to go over, Draco, we can call or owl Zabini to let him know, and he’ll let us inside. Right?” Harry asks Zabini, who looks a bit confused but agrees easily enough.
"Well then, let's get things started for yours." She nods her head at Harry, who follows her to a chair.
“Absolutely not, I’m sorry. I’m just surprised to see you here. Come in, please.” He steps aside. Neville enters, looking around a bit. He’s fiddling with his hands in his pockets, and Draco wonders why he’s so uncomfortable.
“It depended on what kind of mood he was in. If he was in a good mood, he would sit while I prepared myself, fuck me, then leave for the night.”
Malfoy evidently knows his way around the city very well now. They navigate the streets efficiently and step into a shop that smells very funny.
Harry explains how Draco had become suddenly touch-averse, how they’d talked about it and how Draco had started getting physically ill as the night wore on. Marion casts diagnostics as he speaks. Draco sits very still, looking like a corpse.
“Spells don’t work on muggle things.” Draco states as if it’s obvious. Maybe it is. “I opened it up. There were lots of things in the wrong spot inside.”
Draco’s booted foot finds Harry’s under the table, hooking around Harry’s ankle. He winks when Harry looks up.
Draco lifts his finger to the flower the bee is buzzing around, and Harry contains his sound of surprise when the bee lands on Draco’s finger.
Ginny hoisted him up, waved her wand at his things, which packed themselves into his bag, and slung it over her shoulder.
“You can start. Eat slowly, please. You don’t need to wait for permission to eat.” Harry says, pouring them both a cup of tea.
He’d been sleeping in a staff room for a few hours whenever there was a good breaking point, and he’s ready for a real bed and maybe some breakfast.
“Yeah?” Harry asks, biting his lip. Despite being a little disappointed Malfoy had already come, he does feel very proud of himself for being responsible for it.
“I avoided you because it seemed best. I sought to make up for some of my behaviour with your friends, but avoided you because it seemed that it would only make things worse between us.”
Harry blinks a couple times, opening his mouth. Draco bows his head, pulling his hands away to rest on his thighs.
“It was me and a girl from university, and she was new to sleeping with women. Which is fine, I don’t mind a bit of uncertainty. But erm. She thought I looked like Angelina Jolie, which obviously, I don’t-”
“Get these off.” He demands, touching Draco’s trousers. “Knowing how things go, someone’ll be in here very soon, so we don’t have a lot of time.”
“When we’d gotten enough, he helped me thread a big needle and strung them onto a bit of string… hung it over the fireplace. Except for a few. He froze them with magic and we made a game - he’d throw them to me and told me it would be just like catching a Snitch when I’m on the school team. And we ate them in front of the fire with Mum. They were so sour, I can still taste how sour they were… but it was nice, you know?”
Draco looks rather put-out, and rearranges himself on the sofa to monopolise Harry’s non-Hugo-holding right arm.
Narcissa sticks around as they go through each person, though everyone pretends Fred’s not there, as she’s not aware he’s still alive. She doesn’t seem to think it odd that ‘George’ always gives two wildly different answers.
Everyone is talking except the people from the club, who are obediently giving or taking whatever is wanted.
Harry follows Malfoy round the back of the stage and down underneath it, where they’re inexplicably able to stand upright despite Harry knowing the stage is only a few feet off the ground.
“Come with me.” Harry said, sitting down next to Draco on the side of the lake. Draco started to move, but looked confused at Harry, who was still sitting.
“You mean I haven’t fucked you? Or touched your cock?” Harry asks. Draco nods, not meeting his eyes. “Do you want me to?”
Yesterday had been much of the same, and Draco had tapped out before the timer was out, which means that he hasn’t come in nearly a week.
“I don’t like being friends with any sort of bullies whether or not they’re bullying me!” Potter protests.
Snape was ruthlessly shooting off spells, but there just seemed to be more appearing out of nowhere no matter how many fell. Harry wondered if some were Inferi or just random people who’d been Imperius’d.
“I didn’t see my father much when I was a child.” Draco continues, not knowing what to say about Potter’s statement. “He was always out or busy working in his study. I asked him why we picked them and strung them up ourselves instead of having the elves do it, and he said ‘well, the Ministry says you’re too big to bring with me to work now, so I’ve got to find some other way to spend time with you, don’t I?’”
Draco stares at his arm for several minutes, and Harry grows increasingly concerned that something’s wrong.
“Well you didn’t tell me, how was I supposed to know?” Harry asks. "Sorry, I misunderstood your note. It was very ambiguous."
“The Durmstrangs will only be here till about May, when the Quidditch season is over.” He says in what Harry guesses is meant to be a reassuring voice.
“Damn, still not enough Veritaserum!” Inkwood says, leaning back against the sofa rather petulantly.
Draco startles at the sound of Potter’s voice, and he puts down the vials of revitalising potions just in case.
“Oh.” Zabini says, taken aback. “Well you were rude because he’d refused your friendship in favor of Weasley’s, that’s not really a secret.”
Harry decides to let it go. Malfoy’s hair is plaited again today, and therefore today is the perfect day to go out.
Harry lays him on the bed, and Draco manages to kick off his own clothes. Harry sets them aside on the bench.
“You know, your hair’s very pretty. Even if you have to wash it with milk.” Harry says. Malfoy opens his huge eyes, blinking rapidly.
“He apologised.” Draco says, taking the letter out and passing it to Potter, who skims through it quickly.
He wakes up with an awful hangover, and he ventures a guess that he’s not the only one. The lights from the night before still seem to flash in his eyes, and he has to drink a gallon of water to get the cottony feeling out of his mouth.
It’s difficult to remember what things they’d done before the notebook, and a lot of things, like their first bath together, ended with Draco essentially kicking Harry out of the room so he could process things.
Harry wraps his arms around Malfoy’s back, squeezing him gently, walking him backward to the sofa, where he cradles a too-long, regularly-proportioned Malfoy against his side.
He leaves it in the front room, deciding to wait until after breakfast to tell Draco about the delivery.
Potter draws the next slip, a grin slowly growing on his face. He leans over to Willows, shows him and whispers something in his ear.
But he’d failed to turn something in for Charms, and Flitwick’s eyes met his with a gentle nod of understanding, and Harry hasn’t turned anything in since then.
“Not entirely. Just the ones I don’t love.” He says around his wand. Harry leans forward to take it from his teeth. “Just in case everything goes to shit and I somehow end up in prison, I don’t want all of these.”
"No, put your hands-" He lifts them so one is behind his own neck and the other is at the base of Harry’s head. "Don't move your hands."
“I’m your first?” Malfoy asks, sitting up on his elbows. “This is very exciting, I’m so flattered you’ve deemed my arse worthy of your Saviour cock.”
“And if this is what you want… well, we’ve never been very good about keeping you from what you want, have we?”
“No, dramatic.” Draco says. “Like the slightest upset and it will go about trying to ruin anyone’s day just to feel less miserably alone.”
-” Draco whines when Potter kneels over him on the bed, one hand on the back of Draco’s thigh, pinning it down, and the other slipping a third finger inside Draco. “
“Sorry to run off on you, I’ve been neglecting my flowers and wanted to bring some inside for you.” Draco says before Harry sees him.
“I don’t want anyone else to own it.” Draco says quietly, then clears his throat and stands up straighter. “I know you will do a good job. I want you to fix it, make it good, and run it.”
I don't care how long it's been, he's fucking intimidating sometimes. He's scared the absolute shit out of you before, I know you know what I'm talking about."
When Harry comes back in, Draco is back, sitting on the sofa and looking fairly relaxed - as relaxed as Draco is when sitting alone.
“I’m sure you do.” Harry shrugs. “I’ve got… a magical map. Of school. Everyone’s on it, it’ll show where he is.”
“Obviously, why else would he come find you when he’s got more important things to do. You know he’s running the whole thing, right? When we all got here, he had the stage up and was charming the lights and all.”
“Draco?” Harry prompts, taking Draco’s hands in his. It barely stills their violent tremors. “What’s wrong?”
Draco pulls out the parchment-wrapped parcel, taking the paper off and folding it up neatly, setting it on the table. Eventually, he holds up a second cardboard box with pictures of its contents.
“You’re eighty.” He complains, pulling them up. “You’re somehow eighty and I’m still twenty-five, this is dreadful.”
“Yes. His rewards were sometimes nice. I sometimes liked them. His cock felt like how yours is now. Against my arse.”
“You thought I was good. You trusted me. I couldn’t let you blindly trust me without knowing what I did to you.”
“Alright, I have a spare toothbrush in the bathroom you can use.” He offers, opening the loo door and switching on the light.
“If it makes you feel better, it’s very common for someone to start fancying their medical personnel. It’s like teachers or other non-parental figures of authority.”
“The crying one, it’s okay for you to cry. Crying is good. I was just surprised when you started crying, but I shouldn’t have asked you to stop. I’m sorry.”
“So quiet you might not notice him but impossible to not love once you do, we have Mister Alex Crane!”
Potter looks… a lot of things. He looks a little bit annoyed. Also curious. A bit like he might laugh. But he also looks… well, his eyes have darkened from their usual green to mostly black.
Though to be fair, Draco’s scarring wouldn’t stand out here at all - burns and cuts are common among dragon tamers.
Harry snaps out of his shocked daze then, as Malfoy takes a huge, shuddering breath, his bottom lip trembling.
Harry leaves, pausing outside the door to catch his breath. This has been an intensely confusing night for endless reasons.
and you wrote a presentation script, and I can’t imagine how much time that took, and how frustrating it must’ve been. The notes alone must’ve taken hours, I can’t think how much time the gifts themselves took. Just to see your friends happy.”
“I’m sorry, that was unprofessional. Nevermind, I’ll let you get back to your husband, he’ll be woken soon.”
“No, nothing quite so bad. Still, I’m mostly unresponsive when I write, so I’ll be locked in the study until I’m done.”
Draco’s favourite is after he sucks the handsome man’s cock. He’ll stroke Draco’s hair, pull him up to sit on his lap and pet Draco’s hips and legs. Draco doesn’t even have to get hurt to earn those things, sucking cock is not painful.
Draco was already awake by the time Harry opened his eyes. He lay on his side, head turned to stare up at the ceiling.
He’s wearing a grey silk shirt and well-tailored black trousers along with the black boots Harry recognises. They make him significantly taller than Harry, and his legs seem to go on for days. He snaps himself out of his admiration and focuses on the situation.
Draco feels the attempted invasion of his mind, not particularly surprised by the power behind it. He knows firsthand, after being on the receiving end of Potter’s magic many times, that Potter packs quite a punch.
not sure what to make of that statement, but before he has a chance to say anything, he hears footsteps running down the hall. His adrenaline spikes instantly, and he notices Malfoy stiffen as well.
Greyback is easy to find, as he’s shouting and snarling at the three aurors who have him bound hand and foot.
So when the person sets their hand on his shoulder, Draco’s already standing up with his wand poked into their side and his right hand on their chest.
Malfoy is moving again, making more noise. He must know what he’s doing, he must know Harry's not asleep-
“Lovely to meet you, Draco, Molly’s told me you’re such a delight.” Mr. Weasley says, and Draco blushes a bit, glancing over at where Molly is smiling into a large pot on the stove.
“Stop it, Potter. Don’t treat me like spun glass.” Draco growls. Wrestling Harry had been the first time he’d finally been able to feel
“I’m going to be very unhusbandly for the next three days, I hope you can forgive me. I have a deadline to meet with my publisher and I’ve already extended it once when you showed up here the first day.”
“Okay. So… when I want to show you that you’re not in trouble, what’s something I can do besides fuck you?” Harry asks. He strokes his thumb across the back of Draco’s hand gently.
“I don’t know. Never got around to it, I guess. I had people to talk to after the war, so I guess I didn’t think I needed one.”
Ron laughs, pulling back and wiping more tears from his face. He’s shoved out of the way by Ginny, who throws her arms around Harry.
“You can’t conjure up some of that massage oil?” Potter asks, even as he holds his hand out toward the door.
“Oh, this’ll probably short-circuit the Furby.” Harry says dryly as they move to a window to watch rain pour down.
Harry rushes over, checking Malfoy's wrist for a pulse, though he's not really sure how, and can't find it.
He’s not that surprised when Draco doesn’t respond, just lays there with his eyes open, staring at the ceiling.
Draco leads them through the corridors to the different bedrooms, all mostly empty still, and back down the spiral staircase.
“I didn’t get that idea from his mind.” Rebecca assures Harry. “I just assumed, with the kissing and all… I’m sorry, I should go.”
Laughing, Harry follows Malfoy into the bathroom, sitting on the edge of the tub as Malfoy hops onto the vanity.
He leads them into his bedroom, shutting the door behind them and clutching the doorknob tightly in both hands behind his back, like it can keep him from falling apart.
“He- he defended himself. By trying to kill himself.” Harry says. The relief he’d felt when Draco didn’t allow their spells to land had disappeared immediately when the knife appeared. “He’s tried before.”
"No, Wrackspurts." She says, her head snapping toward him abruptly. "Weren't we talking of Wrackspurts?"
“They love their family and friends unabashedly, and that’s beautiful. If everyone loved each other like they do, the world would be a much brighter place, I think.”
“The night you took him… I had no idea who you were, but I didn’t think anything could be worse than where he was. I got in trouble for stunning a couple bouncers. I got out of it by saying I was aiming at you. I guess they bought it since I wasn’t fired.”
Draco snorts in rather an unsexy way, but a very early sexual experience of his comes to mind, and he decides not to mention it. Potter is giving him a far too knowing look anyway.
Goyle pulls up his sleeve to reveal a scar like Draco’s on his left forearm. Mrs. Malfoy lifts her sleeve to show unmarred pale skin.
“That’s alright. I can show you, I think you’ll like it.” Harry offers, releasing Draco’s cock again.
“Right, sorry. Anyway, Pierson especially said the whole thing would’ve been a wash if you hadn’t been involved. We only got all four because of you, he didn’t think we’d get more than two, if that.”
“Boyfriends.” Malfoy says, his eyes flicking up to Harry’s face as his cheeks pinken and he bites his lower lip.
After that, Harry orders himself a fancy fruity beverage which he’s decided not to feel strange about, and has a dish of crepes with fruit, which he’s sharing with Draco.
“I did, though I didn’t read the paper, my friend Greg mentioned it to me. He was aware I disliked my previous position.” Draco says, knowing either the name or the mention of his past employment would distract Potter from the lie.
“Just let it be. Like you said, he knows where you stand, and if he wants something, it’s his task to make that clear.”
The bedrooms upstairs would be remodelled into comfortable dormitories, with warded doors so only those meant to be there could access the upper floors. Anyone younger than 20 in need of housing would be welcome, from squibs to muggleborns to purebloods.
“I did.” Draco cuts in quietly. He stops eating while Harry smiles at him softly. He starts again when Harry continues.
Malfoy’s face hardens, and Harry feels like he’s gotten something very wrong again, upset or offended him somehow. In a fluid motion, Malfoy’s swung his crossed legs off the table and hopped down, stalking off toward the double doors leading out from the suite.
"Fine then, heal my tits for me and I'll keep your sweet, sleep-softened words to myself." Harry says. Malfoy mutters curses under his breath, but at least they're not the magical kind.
“Not to notice what?” Malfoy presses, sitting up a little and leaning into Harry’s space. Harry takes a step closer.
Blaise is very noisily reading a book in view of the front door whilst Draco hovered in the doorway of his house.
“Yes she is, but her husband is a man with a large cock and a very dominant personality, so I make an exception for her.”
“I rather like my eyebrows, thanks.” Draco says, covering them with a twinge of concern. He’s seen Finnigan burn his own and others’ off enough to know eyebrows are an integral part of a face and shouldn’t be arbitrarily removed just to ‘change things up.’
“Why do you talk like that?” An annoying, familiar voice speaks from the back of the room, and Harry’s head snaps toward it.
The bench on Draco’s side of the bed opens up, but Harry doesn’t usually store anything more than a few old jumpers and other random things that he doesn’t want just lying about in his room.
Harry is drifting to sleep as the door opens again, and he jerks his head back upright. Malfoy is backing out, waving his wand at something else and shutting the door without noticing Harry there. He leans against the wall with a heavy sigh and closes his eyes.
Sirius doesn’t answer, only keeping Harry against himself, though there was no warmth from either of their bodies.
“Oh Draco Draco Draco, I hope you know what you’re getting into.” She says knowingly. “Gryffindors are a clingy lot.”
“Bet you he’s just going to propose or something sappy.” Ron says under his breath, and Harry feels his ears grow quite warm.
In doing so, Potter also brushes his hand deliberately against Draco’s flushed and leaking cock, but not enough that Draco could come from it.
“I’m here to bring you a Furby.” Harry says, pulling his rucksack from his shoulder. “What are you doing?”
“I like that you’re so responsive.” He whispers, encouraging Draco to open his mouth, which he does. Harry slips his thumb inside briefly, and Draco licks at it hesitantly. Harry’s lips twitch up. “You’re incredibly sexy.” He growls, and Draco feels a shiver run down his spine.
“Not unless he had a lot of power in the transformations, like McGonagall. But it doesn't seem worth the risk just for a joke. He never leaves the house without you anyway.”
He curls himself up, sitting at the opposite end of the tub. Facing Harry. His eyes are wide. The water sloshes around them.
Harry grabs the four containers, then carries the lot up to the bathroom, setting Draco down on the toilet.
“I’m torn.” He finally says. “I just got this really striking silver dress that I’m itching to wear, but it’s a bit flashy for covert operations.”
a brave man, you know that.” Narcissa says fondly. “We had a cake for his birthday shortly after, and the elves had frosted a snake on top. Oh, he was so very close to firing them, but the cake itself was so delicious he
By the time they’re walking up to Madame Puddifoot’s with Malfoy’s Honeydukes bags, Harry had almost forgotten Malfoy wanted to go.
“I- I don’t… I don’t understand.” Draco says again, quieter. Harry waits quietly, unsure if Draco’s done talking. He goes back to rubbing his head, staring down like he’s looking for something inside his own mind.
“Ah, Harry. Thought I’d see you today.” Gawain says blandly. He rubs his hands over his face. “I take it you’ve heard of your new partnership?”
“Yeah, we didn’t think Bishop and Adams would be here, to be honest. Draco said there were only two here.”
“I don’t like this.” Draco says quietly, taking his notebook back, tucking the scrap of letter inside and pocketing it.
“I’m not a squirrel.” Malfoy mutters. “I happen to stock up on supplies so that, during winter when everything is snowy, I have what I need.”
St. Mungo’s? Certainly not Hogwarts, but likely some hospital. It’s too white and plain to be anything else.
With one stubby nail, Harry tries scratching from the waistband of Malfoy’s pants up to his shoulder, drawing out a high-pitched, needy whine that does nothing to calm the situation in Harry’s own trousers.
“He’s just weird about sex sometimes.” Draco shrugs. “Anyway, it’s very rude of him to send a Patronus when I can’t reply. He should know that.”
“Don’t cover yourself, please? I want to see.” He whispers, looking at Draco’s face. Draco is long past saving face, so he nods faintly. Harry redirects his attention down.
“What I’m saying.” Draco continues. “Is that those two have been by your side through thick and thin.”
Even in his neat slacks and button up shirt, Draco moves with grace and ease. It looks effortless for him to lift his legs from the floor and turn with the pole, feet moving like he’s walking on air.
“Yes. You can join me.” Draco leans forward to shut off the tap, and Harry looks away from his arse on display.
“Of course. His grades suffered, his health suffered, he often disappeared for hours on end, and he seemed to be constantly looking over his shoulder. We know why, now, but at the time I did not know the extent of his condition.”
“I just... well I didn’t know if you got on with George. He… he lost his twin, you know.” Harry says, but wishes he didn’t because now it sounds like Harry blames Draco. “Not that it was your fault, or anything. But he’s been understandably upset over it.”
“What, you can initiate foreplay mid-game and we can’t?” Drake snaps, gesturing at Draco and Potter.
“Make your hair long. Nothing else, just the hair.” Harry says before he reaches the closet. Malfoy looks over his shoulder.
"Mine is fixed now, and I thought you might want yours back. Happened upon it the other day, I sort of forgot I had it."
“I thought it was obvious. You like him.” Ron shrugs. “I have to admit, it’s sort of weird to see you without him now. He’d been around so much I was starting to like him myself.”
“Well, he was brought to things along with some of the other lads that had the same job, though I’m fairly certain they chose to be there. But one night, a whole load of guards were brought from the club out to the house where he was, I don’t know what happened or anything. I was afraid they’d killed him, I didn’t see him for ages. When he came back out, he was different.”
“Er, did Malfoy ask you, you know, when you were a kid, not to mention him to me? Or did your grandmother?”
Even though he’s sleeping through the night for the first time in months, Draco’s exhausted from maintaining his narrative to each person.
Harry recognised where they were, and they slipped behind the tapestry before the Carrows turned the corner.
there and I could’ve fixed a lot of lives if I got my goddamn arse outside and tried doing something. I’ve been hiding for four years, Ron.”
“I know he needs me. He needs to figure things out for himself, I’m no good for him.” Malfoy snaps. “He should make new friends and stay far away from me.”
“What if I’m not helping him, Ron? What if I’m only replacing them, a different kind but still an abuser?”
“Wake up, prat.” Harry says, sounding far too affectionate about it. He pokes Malfoy’s thigh. “Do you shave your legs?”
“No, but I read about it once. You can probably find a book about it somewhere if you want to understand it better.”
“Morgana, Potter, you couldn’t approach me from the front like a normal person?” Draco huffs, releasing his wand and dropping his hand. Potter laughs.
“Yes. A little.” Draco whispers. He hasn’t had to use the rubbish bin since they got home, and was able to drink some water when Harry pushed. “My head hurts.”
What if Draco’s body remembers the times Harry had punched and hit him? Or when he would hex him in the halls of school? What if Draco’s body remembers Harry almost killing him?
Harry tries to picture the regal Chatterly Apparating into the bathroom to splash Draco to wake him up. It’s a funny image, certainly.
Moving very quickly, Harry manages to pin Malfoy’s un-lotioned wrists to the bed, panting and staring with what he imagines is a rather manic expression.
Harry feels the breath whoosh out of him as he meets Draco’s eyes, finding the relief mirrored in them.
“Depends on how it’s handled.” He says lightly, then continues. “You told me you shagged Ernie MacMillan because he reminds you of me.”
“I don’t understand. I don’t know. It bothers me.” He says, calmer but still with an edge of frustration. “I like when you’re happy. I don’t like when you’re not happy. I like when you like me.”
“Yeah, I just. I think I may have fucked everything up. I mean, I think that almost every day with him, but I really fucked up.”
Narcissa huffs, apparently deciding Harry’s not going to be helpful, and turns down a different hall.
While this is certainly easier than talking him through the process, Harry hopes that he’ll soon be rested enough to talk again. He had enjoyed the cheekiness earlier.
“Oh my god, how did I not think of this sooner?” Harry exclaims, startling Draco out of his midday snooze on Harry’s lap. He chirps in annoyance, but Harry soothes him with extra pets.
Harry was smiling as he set Draco’s letter on the desk, grabbing a page and his new muggle sparkly gel pen.
extremely curious, and though he gets another weird look from Zabini, he doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand.
Fortunately, the Slytherins were a self-contained ecosystem and chatted among themselves without causing any trouble. They were joined by Rolf Scamander, Luna’s gent, who seemed perfectly happy flitting about the room and talking to everyone all at once.
Draco swallowed. He did steal sometimes, occasionally a paper to read what was happening outside, he once swiped a book, then acted as if he'd just picked it off the floor and gave it back to start a conversation.
Still, Potter’s shirt is sweat-soaked and clinging to him obscenely, and as he’s catching his breath, Draco gives him an unsubtle once-over.
Hermione flops back against the sofa once Hugo is safely passed over, and Harry catches Draco making a face.
“Mm. Taking a female appearance has been really eye opening for me. There’s shit you’d never know about as a man.” He says.
“You don’t have to. You’re always welcome to live with me or Blaise, and if you want to live alone, you could get yourself a flat or a house or something.” Harry says.
It barely lasts a second, though, as they get to the door and she pulls her wand from the front of her dress, nodding at the door as Harry draws his own and kicks it in.
Post-tea, Greg and Astoria shoo Blaise and Draco from the kitchen, so they wander into the conservatory in the garden.
“It’s already weird, I’m on your lap.” Draco points out. Neville laughs a bit too loudly. “Are you okay?”
Occasionally, Draco fed a line to Pierson through the earpiece - a specific answer or sometimes a reaction. Every line made Harry mad, knowing they likely had been things Draco had said before. But he kept touching Draco gently, reassuringly.
“No punishment, I asked you to try not using those answers, I didn’t say you couldn’t.” Harry explains, sort of proud of himself for having spoken carefully earlier. Draco gives him a funny look, but moves his wrist away.
“No. It’s like I’m choking.” Draco whispers, passing each article to Harry as he removes it. Harry tosses them onto the bench beneath the window.
Then, Harry’s mouth drops as Malfoy mutters another incantation and his body regains his usual height and the long hair disappears, his face becomes more angular and masculine and the makeup vanishes. Seconds later, and Malfoy looks like himself again.
The odd walls and ceiling were seamless, uninterrupted plaster. The door even blended into the walls.
“Draco Malfoy, you really ought to be more careful when you address the Great Harry Potter.” He said, twisting onto his knees in front of Draco and letting his work fall to the floor.
Harry nods as he considers it - granted, he’s unfamiliar with New York as a whole, but George is adaptable and
“Did you like being tickled?” Harry asks in surprise. He’d assumed Draco was agreeing because he wasn’t comfortable saying he didn’t like it.
“Malfoy, I dare you to reveal one embarrassing thing about yourself for every time you talk about your sex life for the duration of the game.”
Draco takes Harry’s hand again as Jeanette leads them on a path around the cottage toward the back, telling them about the plants in the garden she’d gotten from Neville.
“I have determined to allow my son the privilege of informing me himself of the nature of his shop. Until then, I will respect his privacy.”
“Alright.” Draco says, shrugging. “I’m fully capable of keeping it in my pants. I’ve wanted to shag Greg since we were thirteen and still haven’t.”
“He added me to the wards, it screwed up one of his potions to let me in so he said just come straight through the gate. Sorry.” Harry says, hoping it’ll explain how he’s inexplicably in the Manor without a reason.
He’s up there for a very long time, and Harry starts to wonder if he’s having trouble deciding what to do next. When Harry doesn’t give him instructions, Draco gets stuck not knowing what he’s supposed to do.
Harry puts his arm around Malfoy’s waist, letting it slip a bit lower than usual, resting on his hip just to be a little territorial and hopefully drive the message home with Theodosii.
It has always rankled when people make assumptions about Harry based on his scar and his public history.
“Are you completely ignoring the wings?” Malfoy asks, twisting a bit to show off the little leather angel wings attached to the back of the harness he’s got on.
When the handsome man had first said he was going to put his cock in Draco, he knew better than to say no.
“No, it’s okay. I’m sure you need the rest.” Harry says, rubbing Draco’s knuckles. It’s a reflexive action now, and he doesn’t need to verbalise its purpose anymore, as Draco relaxes with the touch.
, overwhelmingly so, and Draco can only take so much of it before his head falls back onto the wood. He cries as his entire body trembles with his orgasm.
“Yes, I know. But I came out of it alright, I suppose. When you’ve already got anxiety and depression and PTSD, what’s a little more?” Draco shrugs, taking a hasty drink of his beer.
“Thank you, I’ll be here all week.” Scarrow says as he falls back into his seat, taking off the heels and scowling at Drake. “Can I have my shoes back now?”
“It’s not tight enough.” Malfoy mutters, moving his arms around experimentally. “And the fabric is too rough on my wings.”
Harry went back out, rapping again, with no response. Harry opened it with a spell, finding Draco sitting on the floor with a knife in his right hand. It had blood on it, although drying. He almost looked dazed and didn’t seem to notice Harry come in.
“I will take it all off again if this was just some joke to get me into muggle clothes.” Malfoy warns.
“It’s cute!” Astoria wheezes, clutching Greg’s arm for support. “It’s cute, you only say stupid things when you like someone.”
Draco, you look so good like this.” Harry whispers, and his free hand grabs Draco’s arse and squeezes it. Draco’s altogether fairly glad Harry had arranged him like this as it means Harry doesn’t see the red flush that seems to be permanent on his face now.
“I’m asking for your consent. It’s your choice. If you said no, I wouldn’t pick you up even if I wanted to. It’s your choice whether or not you want to be carried.”
Flashes of his failed relationship with Cho Chang - who seemed to communicate in an entirely different dialect - run through Harry’s mind. He’s suddenly grateful Draco is willing to simply state what he wants plainly.
As predicted, the boys working there poked fun at Malfoy for his done up attire, but stopped after Harry glared at them hard enough.
It’s the first time someone’s ever called Draco evil and he didn’t want to immediately pitch himself off a bridge.
Right after Harry finishes making dinner, he sends Draco a Patronus letting him know. He can hear Draco’s footsteps on the stairs a moment later.
Harry smiles fondly as Draco works, and despite what he said, may possibly drift to sleep just for a moment.
The man moves Draco to the desk, to lean against it. He lowers Draco’s trousers and underwear. Draco is a little glad for the potion keeping him hard all night, as he’s not sure he’d otherwise be able to.
“Yeah, we think so. Lucius’s is still in Evidence somewhere. That one would’ve been too, but I made a duplicate so you could have it back. It’s about time you get something of yours back.”
The man only gives him one last scathing look and leaves the room. Draco hears the wobble of wards keeping the door shut when he’s gone.
“Why?” Malfoy asks, frowning deeply at the paint chips, holding them very close to his face to read the tiny font the colour names are written in.
George arrives next, speaking briefly with Harry and Molly before he goes out to join his dad and Draco.
“And you’ll need your hair done, it’s due for a trim. And your nails, and are you set on this look? The hair? The eyebrows? I could change things up.”
“Probably not. As I said, he doesn’t leave these woods. Something about them agrees with him. I think he likes to hunt the smaller creatures.”
Draco takes it from the oven and sets it on a cutting board, using magic to slice some, and drops it into the toaster.
“Mm, that came before the transfiguration.” Malfoy says, and Harry freezes, taking in the implication.
“Doesn’t look like these books will be of much help, we’ve tried nearly everything so far. This situation is highly unprecedented.” Malfoy says, taking a large drink of dark red juice.
“The other one was always breaking the rules, he fucked patrons in the private rooms when they didn’t pay. I- I didn’t know why they gave me one, I didn’t break any rules. I’m good.” Malfoy continues.
He can’t hear what they’re saying, but Jack doesn’t react outwardly, even as he focuses his attention on Draco. Draco returns to Harry only a few minutes later.
“What are you talking about? Cho and I didn’t work out because she wanted me to replace Cedric… or… or something, I’m still not clear what was wrong.”
“Of course.” Ginny says gently. “I hope you two find your way back soon. You could both use something good right about now.”
“If I, or anyone else, touches you, or talks to you in a way that hurts or upsets you, or that you just don’t like, or want, just say ‘I don’t like this.’ Can you do that?”
After that, Draco found plenty of reasons to escape before being expected to leave with someone. He found it almost fun, working his charm and finding new ways to interact.
Harry can only watch as they walk him off the property, then Apparate from outside the gates. Once they’re gone, he closes the door and turns to see the elves standing in the hallway. Most of them are crying.
“Both of you.” Draco says, voice breaking, pulling himself up from the wall and plastering something neutral on his face. Maybe. He’s getting worse at faking it.
"I know.” Draco says with a frown. “I don't want you to know. That is why... that is the point of lying."
Harry snorts, patting Malfoy’s lower back, where his hand has been since he woke up, just slightly under his shirt.
Draco may be a bit new to sex, but he’s a quick study, and soon he’s riding Harry with abandon, biting his lips to keep the noise to a minimum.
“Hey hey hey, why are you crying?” Harry asks as gently as he can, feeling like he wildly fucked up again somehow.
"I was more meaning the fishnets, but alright. At least this is better than a sundress or something." Harry acknowledges. Malfoy's black shorts and tshirt tucked only into the front is more conservative than usual.
“Marion?” Harry calls out. Marion steps back inside the room. Draco doesn’t say anything, so Harry asks her instead. “What were you thinking about Draco’s body when you were looking a minute ago?” Harry asks. She frowns.
After a few seconds of adjustment, Draco has moved his thong string aside and is sinking down on the cock. He’s slick from someone coming inside him earlier, and it helps ease the pain.
“Like if we’re playing a game and you think it’ll be too embarrassing, you have to do it anyway. Part of the rules for the night. But we do allow for Obliviation afterward if you’re forced to reveal something too personal. Oh, and we use a bit of Veritaserum, but no one’s ever overdosed on it, we’re very careful.”
“And I thought I could- I- with Pansy, Pansy knows about us, and Greg didn’t, but Greg knew about Vince and Pansy didn’t- Theo knows about us but doesn't know that Greg doesn't, Blaise doesn't know anyth- it’s so- so
“It’s so cute when you were knitting with Mrs. Weasley. You get really focused, and you have a little line between your eyebrows.”
“Well, you look lovely.” Harry beams at her. “You both do, grey is a good colour for you, Ron. And pink on you, ‘Mione.”
“Yeah, I’m still friends with the Weasleys and Hermione. I see George a lot more too now, since he’s around the shop sometimes.” Harry says, deciding not to acknowledge her entirely unsubtle curiosity. “Ginny and I broke up at the end of Sixth year, though. I haven’t dated since.”
“How could I possibly have thought this a good idea?” Draco asks a bit frantically. “I shouldn’t be here, I’ll be at home, go without me.”
of all things. He is still a wanted man, having not served his sentence, but as he was one of the least threatening Death Eaters to have escaped, was not a high priority. He still presumably could access his family’s wealth, could’ve lived in the Manor in luxury even while on probation.
A few minutes later, the man reappears, and Harry wonders if he’s imagining the man looking pale and frightened.
Everyone knows better than to use Draco’s name as he’s coming back up, so the onslaught of petnames makes him feel very warm and agreeable.
Honestly, he tried to think of as many disgusting things as he could, but when Draco’s nose tickled the spot under Harry’s ear, everything flew out the window and he felt himself stir.
Harry starts massaging his scalp like he’s done for Harry in the shower, gently at first, then adds a bit more pressure when Draco hms his approval. He eventually seems to give up reading altogether, shutting his book and setting it on the table.
They’re in pain, they’re scared, they’re grieving. But they choose to take their grief out on the only person still around to blame: Draco. They’re not
"No, it was the summer after First year. They don't like wizards. The Weasleys came and brought me to the Burr- er, their house- for the the rest of the summer. Oh, and Dobby visited me there, at my relatives’ house. That was the first time I met him."
Malfoy stands, closes his eyes, and his skin seems to get clearer. He looks thinner than a moment ago, and his skin tone is pallid, nearly grey. Harry looks at his face, finding the constellation of freckles along his jaw that he remembered from school. Shadows under his eyes formed, along with a bruise on his left cheek faded into sickly yellow.
Narcissa went with him, walking a step behind and giving her son a conspiratorial look as she left, miming a peacock spreading its feathers across her husband's back. Draco snickered quietly.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think about it. How about I make you a nice coffee that’s sweet and tastes good? You can try that.” Harry offers.
“If I’m upset, Harry hugs me. Would you like a hug?” Draco offers Marion. Marion smiles in an unfamiliar way.
“Okay.” He kisses Draco’s wrist again, then taps it. “I understand why you wanted to hide it. Would you like to change the rule to allow that?” Harry offers. Draco shakes his head.
“Are you sleeping with me tonight?” Draco asks casually while they eat. Harry chokes on his potatoes.
Half an hour in, Malfoy was complaining, wiggling around again until he’s sitting sideways, shoulder against the seatback, facing away from Harry.
“Alright, Harry. I’ll humor you.” She sighs. Harry huffs. “What paperwork do you need, I’ll put in a request for it.”
He squirmed his way out from underneath Harry to regain his position on top, straddling Harry’s hips now, freeing his legs. He dropped forward to pin Harry’s wrists near his head, finding himself panting into Harry’s flushed face.
“Dessert?” He asks again, mouth set in a thin line, blinking up at his mother like he’s daring her to object.
“I’ve got to go now. I won’t be checking any means of message, so assume you won’t be able to get ahold of me.”
“Potter, have you considered working for the Ministry?” Narcissa asks politely. “Lucius has had great success in doing so, and I imagine with your fame-”
"So you do care about me, then. Enough to not want me to crash and burn during my first year of teaching." Malfoy says casually.
“Aw, does it hurt? Your itty bitty hole too tight? Is my cock too big for you, baby? You’re such a tiny little thing, of course it’s too big. Is my cock
“Of course not. Let’s go, we have interrogations to conduct.” Malfoy says. Harry fishes the portkey from his pocket on autopilot and still hasn’t recovered when they arrive in their office at the Ministry.
“I’ll be honest, I’m happy for an excuse to wear this dress. Fleur got it for me ages ago and I’ve never known what to do with it. I rarely wear dresses, it’s nearly always dress
“It did the trick.” Harry says with a smirk. She lifts an eyebrow, but there’s a smile twitching at her mouth.
“I don’t feel okay.” Draco rasped, and despite how he cringed away from the touch, he let Harry help him to the bed.
Draco always turns them down with a wink and a vague promise he has no intention of keeping. They don't even care about that. It’s all part of the game.
“Malfoy. Hello, Harry, I didn’t know you’d still be here. I’m afraid we won’t be entering, we come here with a summons.” Robards states gruffly. He hands a parchment to Draco. “You’re under arrest.”
“How did you even reach the ceiling for this?” Harry teases, showing Malfoy his screen. “You couldn’t even if you jumped.”
“You don’t think I went through the same thoughts after the war? Putting my friends and my family in danger? For leading the fight to them? You think I’ve never blamed myself for people’s deaths? Because I
Hey, at least he’s mostly covered by the sheets. The dark grey contrasts with his very pale skin. His hair blends into the shadows where it's fanned out, flopping back from his forehead.
"I'm not sure if I don't prefer when your dad was picking fights with me. He's sort of creepy now." Harry says.
"It is hotter than hell in here." Harry complains, looking up at his flatmate. Malfoy rolls his eyes.
Harry hears the light thumps of Draco’s footsteps upstairs, but he’s running. He’d spent the morning in the study writing things - Harry would give almost anything to know what he writes about all the time - and he has his notebook with him, so Harry doesn’t know why he’d be running.
Also for someone who actually hates Christmas and all holidays, I certainly have been putting a ton of Christmas into my fics.....
“She’ll love it.” Hermione says softly, kneeling down on the floor to pick up Rose, showing her the book.
It doesn’t hurt, not anymore, and healed very well considering how severe the burns had been. But it still looks bad, Draco knows that. Everyone he sleeps with is aware of them now, and if he shags someone new, he covers them.
After the initial shock, he looks around to see the inside of the white room again, where Draco is laying on the bed on his side against the wall, looking at Harry, who lies facing him.
“So it’s really just humiliation. You’ve got a major humiliation kink.” Harry says, barely able to contain his mirth. “And I bet me talking about it is only making you harder, isn’t it.”
With his wife and several other healers and mediwix present, Draco put Devoe back to sleep while he worked at mending the damage as completely and efficiently as possible.
Jumping up and stacking his papers hastily, Harry’s mind races with what Malfoy might need help with. He throws his cloak on just before leaving and rushes through the mostly empty corridors.
“Okay. Let’s put the towel around it just in case. If it gets wet, your writing may get blurry and it will be harder to read.”
“Okay.” Draco says. He drinks the water Harry leaves in his hand, and Harry passes him a slice of bread.
“Find me a jumper that goes with this, then we’ll talk.” Draco sniffs. “And no, I’ll be fine. Gives me an excuse to sit very close to you on the sofa.”
talk about. Not to your friends, not to strangers in a bar… You act as if it never happened, only pausing to remember it at night when no one’s around.
Harry, not having had a chance to take his broom out since the previous year, leapt at the opportunity, and soon he and Malfoy were on the empty Quidditch pitch pulling their brooms from their storage.
“He’s usually worse, actually. I never thought he’d leave.” Draco says, smiling back. “How have you put up with him while he was single?”
Draco has sort of latched onto the few things specially labelled as ‘his,’ which gives Harry an idea.
Malfoy jumps down from the counter and reaches back around it, pulling out a large grey quill and a page of parchment.
“Hey, what are you doing here?” Potter asks, jumping off his broom before it’s fully stopped and jogging the last few steps to where Draco stands.
Draco seems to have hit a wall, stammering for a moment and rubbing his temples. Harry sets down the stack of shirts in his arms and takes Draco's hands gently.
“It’s almost time to get up.” Draco says softly, though getting up is the last thing he wants to do.
Draco raises an eyebrow, lifting his hand from Harry’s shoulder to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
As far as strange goes, Luna is at the top, but even she seems to have reached a breaking point after the death of her father.
And so it was settled. The next evening, they’d arrive together but enter the venue separately. They’d meet up an hour after their arrival and dance to exchange information discreetly. Several plan options were laid depending on the outcome of the first hour.
“I’m sort of glad you did. I feel very special for being responsible for it.” He says tenderly, and Draco looks up at him.
“Yes.” Draco sighs, looking a bit pouty now that Harry’s not giving him more. “When will you not stop?”
He silenced outgoing noise from his and his partner’s earpieces and started barking orders at the aurors to get into their positions.
Harry doesn't see him often, but anytime he does, Malfoy seems to be avoiding him just as much as he avoids Goyle, Zabini, Nott and Parkinson.
The entire court knows by now - a year into their arrangement - not to bother the Royal Pet. They know to treat him with respect. If the luxurious fabrics and jewelry were not indicator enough, then Draco’s fine leather and gold collar proclaim it.
Now, he’s holding back tears, standing in front of the handsome man while he’s scolded all over again.
“I like to surround myself with things that make me happy. I’m a spoiled brat, Potter, you know that.”
“Made this for you.” Harry says, plopping the crown onto Malfoy’s head. It slips down to cover his eyebrows.
Draco grins, watching as Potter sets the little dragon down on the table and it crawls around, poking at their plates.
Harry stands too, stepping around the table. He doesn’t see the blanket fall in front of Draco’s foot, only sees him falling.
He’s not really sure what he’s dressed as, no one had explained his costume. But from the amount of people touching him, feeling him, it must be something sexy. It’s a very short skirt, anyway, and connects to a lot of straps around his chest.
“Oh, that’s not true.” Draco says with a thrill of excitement at the memory. “Every man has at least two holes and usually one prick. I’m thrilled to report that I was accepting three simultaneously, the fourth was delivering to the gent at my mouth.”
Neville is a creature of habit, and back when Harry was working, he’d watch sleepily from the kitchen table as Neville performed the exact same routine every morning, starting by drawing a large X over the previous day’s date and ending with washing out his coffee mug. Neither would speak as Neville’s ability to talk didn’t come until he was leaving for work, and Harry was always crabby in the mornings.
“I’m resigning effective immediately,” Harry says, passing the letter over before Gawain can get a greeting out.
"No, you're not a cat. Look, whether or not this cat is actually Malfoy, I know Malfoy’s birthday is today, alright? I never got to celebrate my birthday until after Hogwarts, and it feels shitty to be forgotten. I wanted to make sure he got to celebrate even if he’s a cat now and it’s only you and me here.” Harry explains. Neville smiles widely.
Maybe Potter would have somehow prevented Draco from being drafted into the wrong side altogether. Instead of scars on his forearm, his skin would be unmarred by hatred.
Draco’s shirt is wrinkled and sweaty, but a cleaning charm solves that, and he pulls his pants and trousers back on.
“Oh, that’s right, you want news of dear old dad, don’t you? Well, he’ll be Kissed. But even if he wasn’t, I told him where you’d be. But has he come to get you? No. He doesn’t want such a pathetic excuse for an heir. Who would?”
“Yes. You said I probably would not like it since it is not sweet.” He says unhappily. Harry gives him a sympathetic face.
Harry still sleeps in sweats and a tshirt, more for his own constitution than his modesty as before Draco came to live here, Harry would sleep in the nude as well. Maybe if…
Withdrawing the horrid purple and yellow creature from his bag, Harry grins at Malfoy’s bewilderment.
“Hey hey, you’re okay, sweetheart. Merlin, you were so brave, I couldn’t believe how amazing that was. I’m so proud of you. That was
Harry wraps his arms around Draco, who tips his head back to lean on his shoulder. It’s… it’s really sweet.
“Hello Hermione. It’s not so bad if you stand very close to Ron. Harry is warm, Ron must be too.” Draco advises, arm in arm with Harry, who shrugs sheepishly as Ron gives him a smug look.
She asks. Robards nods, walking back to his table to drink water. Harry’s skin crawled with how casual he was with Draco’s life.
“Yes. He said I should move in with him to make sure I am okay without you.” Draco says with a frown.
“I will not speak on your behalf. I refuse to help you in any way.” Draco says, so formally that Harry wonders where the line came from.
Right as Harry’s lips made contact with Draco’s skin, the doors opened to reveal a stately, reserved Narcissa, whose eyes widened slightly.
Harry sits patiently while Zabini and Draco converse in French again for a while, and Zabini says something which makes Draco blush a lot, leaning into Harry in embarrassment.
"You could've told me. You could've told me a long time ago, before the two-ears body went offline."
“Okay, alright, okay, you’ll be alright,” Harry murmured as he laid Draco down. He passed a conjured glass of water to Draco, who spilled half of it as he tried to drink it. “Do you know what’s wrong?”
here, with his hands behind his back and standing in a line of others in front of a wall. Draco makes a beeline toward him, dropping Harry’s hand on the way.
“No, I don’t think so.” Harry pauses. “I… never thought that you did anyway. I didn’t know you like men, though. And I thought you were dating Pansy.”
“Constantly.” Draco says bitterly, drinking half his beer in one go. “I’m surprised none of you have asked why I’m always armed.”
Besides that, Potter would be disappointed. He does enjoy Draco’s skirts for the ease of access they provide. It’s the least Draco can do considering he can’t give him
“I suppose some shopping is in order then. I’ll have to leave you here, and remember not to mess with any of Neville’s things or you’ll be sleeping in the yard.” He says, pointing at Draco’s face. Draco meows blandly.
Draco rolls them over so he’s on top, and takes each of Harry’s hands in turn, kissing his palms and returning them to his own chest.
Malfoy’s concentration doesn’t waver as the elf reappears and Narcissa carefully Levitates Eduard’s body into it, burying him in the rice.
Finally, he and the man arrive at the group, and Draco recognises some more people from the club, sitting on laps, squeezed into chairs with patrons - one is even on his knees, mouth full of cock. He’s not moving, though. His mouth is full and drooling but he’s just sitting there. Like cockwarming but with his mouth.
True to his ever-honest word, Potter does get injured often. Despite the fact that he works with nearly two dozen of some of the world’s most dangerous beasts, the greatest threat to Potter’s health is apparently himself.
“She used to, but she hasn’t as much recently. Well, not me anyway, who knows if she tells Ron. But we don’t think they’re very interesting.”
changed, dammit! He’s far more witty and put together and it’s very rare that he backs down from any sort of challenge.
To ensure everyone has ingested an appropriate amount of veritaserum, everyone has to answer the same question.
Harry finds a blank page of letterhead, writing a note to Hermione about making her think he doesn’t care for her because he’s always refused to listen to her rant about things she’s read about. He adds a post script that requests she write back to Draco soon.
“Hermione, it’s fine, we’ll finish up here and get to bed then. It’s no use lying there if we can’t sleep anyway.”
Pierson keeps murmuring apologies in a very convincing frightened Draco impression, though the voice is really messing with Harry’s head. He squeezes the real Draco, the one here in his lap.
The yellow ‘daisies’ were adonis vernalis, which represent painful memories. Draco was actually present when Fred was killed and most likely watched it happen - almost immediately after he'd watched one of his two best friends die while unarmed and unable to do anything about it. :/
Harry huffed out a laugh, shocked at what had just happened. His cock was harder than he could ever remember it being, including during
Harry realises that his hands have been stroking up and down Malfoy’s sides since he woke up, and he stills them abruptly, setting them on Malfoy’s thighs. It’s not much better.
Outside his wards, Draco’s chest is filled with pounding music. There are flashing lights up ahead - familiar, but not. As they walk, they come upon several transparent curtains leading out to small stages.
Harry leans against the door frame of the bathroom, watching with concern as Malfoy carefully sterilises a needle.
One of them lunges for Draco, and he automatically flinches away. Hands shove him from behind, and Draco stumbles into someone else.
tell me my cat is not Malfoy.” Harry cuts her off firmly. “I’m tired of hearing it, and even if I’m wrong, which I’m
So Harry runs his fingers through the white-blond locks, seeing Draco’s fingers tense where they hold the book. He smirks to himself, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair.
To be honest, spoiling Draco has sort of led to himself being spoiled as well. He takes baths now, with bubble bath and salts which… weirdly have made his skin less rough and far softer. He cooks more than he did, eats nicer meals and not just what’s convenient or easy. He likes touching Draco just as much as Draco likes being touched. He’s even started reading more in his down time, and sleeps better with Draco there.
“Stupefy!” He shouts, one by one knocking the bouncers back. “Come on!” He grabs Malfoy’s hand again, pulling him back up the hallway as more staff members draw their wands.
“Merlin! Your feet are like ice blocks.” He complains, resettling in front of Harry, keeping his feet away. He’s warm, and Harry falls asleep quickly.
With a well-aimed elbow, Harry managed to catch Greyback in the nose, but the wand had fallen too far and no Summoning spell was working.
Malfoy seems to have no trouble casting protection and stunning spells, though anytime Harry glances at him, he’s staring at the wand like he’s forgotten what to do with it.
Narcissa Malfoy guides them up a set of stairs to a more familiar part of the house, depositing Malfoy in front of his suite, though he follows behind Harry and Narcissa to the guest suite anyway, chattering about how he used to borrow the bedroom for when his friends would visit him.
Draco closes Harry out after that, and Harry’s blinking back at Draco with an unreadable expression before Harry realises the memory’s over.
Devoe starts talking, speaking very quickly and not saying anything of consequence. Draco waits him out.
And Harry would finally give in, slamming the last couple inches inside in one swift thrust. A cry of pained pleasure would spur him on, drawing out halfway before shoving back in even deeper.
“Stuff it, Potter.” Malfoy smirks, sitting back to watch as Harry nearly chokes on the unexpected bite.
“Now I know my sex life is endlessly interesting, but if no one else has pressing questions, I think it’s time we move on.”
The tapping increases in speed, so Harry reaches over and puts his hand on Malfoy’s leg to still it.
A knock at the door startled Draco enough that he jumped up immediately, knocked Harry’s glasses back to him with his foot, and rushed to see who it was. He heard Harry stand up behind him as well.
Inkwood Apparates from the kitchen table to the back of a sofa, clutching the nearest bookcase to stay upright.
He’s gone again before Harry can respond, and it’s difficult to tell if he’d just run off or if he had Apparated away.
But Lucius’ insanity post-Azkaban, his mood swings, the haunted look in his eyes makes Draco shudder even now.
Draco realises someone’s holding his arms by his sides about the same time he notices the deafening crashes around them.
“Yes, you did.” Shannon says, folding her hands across one knee. “I have a new assignment for you, but first let’s hear what you’ve written.”
“I don’t know how you can say no to that face.” Astoria says, helping Greg pull Draco to his feet. Draco whines in protest.
He’s reminded both of Draco going into shock after his inquest, and of Draco shutting down at the clothes shop.
Cursing and using a hasty Scourgify, he manages to get himself looking properly again, but when he looks up, Potter’s gone.
“True.” Draco says, deciding to move on from the subject rather than continue to talk his way around Potter’s questions. “So you miss your friends and family? Have you spoken with them about naming Ginevra godmother?”
The man is warm and his hands are gentle. Draco wants them there, he likes how they feel. The man cups Draco’s cheek, looking at his face.
“Because you’re an insufferable teacher’s pet and you’ve proved very good at landing me in trouble over the years.” Harry says.
Willows moves around Potter to join Draco, putting one knee on the outside of Draco’s hip closest to the circle, the other leg between Draco’s. He grabs both of Draco’s wrists and pushes them above his head.
“I… no I don’t, I haven’t seen any of them in years. I ran into Nott at some point on Diagon, but we didn’t speak.”
I'm gonna be honest, I was intending to cover a Lot more in this chapter, but what is here ended up being way longer than I'd planned on haha..
“Auburn? I guess.” Harry says, trying to picture it. “I think you’d look good with any hair colour.”
“‘S sa secret.” Draco whispered. Archie’s eyebrows lifted. “‘M not ‘susposed’a tell. I think. Maybe.”
“Well, we were having a lovely dinner with the in-laws, and Hera made some comment about us not having any children. Of course, Greg immediately told her to leave off, and
“Oh, that’s tonight? Sure.” Draco says, fishing a handful of coins from his robe pocket and passing over a Galleon. “What do I need to know beforehand?”
“What about your mum? She hasn’t written you or anything? I mean, she didn’t cut out off from her vaults, and she did send those biscuits.”
Right arm lifted in front of his face, where the burn begins at his elbow and runs up the back of his arm. It covers his entire right side down inside the waist of his trousers.
Grinning, Ginny clutches her arm and mimics Draco’s ‘oh yes, if I’d waited any longer before getting patched up, I could’ve lost the arm’ from his encounter with Buckbeak third year.
For once, Harry doesn’t bother putting on fresh pants before bed, just lays with his towel around his waist hoping sleep takes him quickly.
Even in the dark, Harry gets a thrill of excitement deep in his blood at the feeling of being exposed in the room with Malfoy only a few feet away.
Here we have two idiot boys not knowing how BDSM works and figuring things out,, ugh someone give them a pamphlet..
“You didn’t compliment his performance, I guess. Who knows why he ever talks about you, but go shower him with praise for a few minutes so we can get a move-on.” She says, nudging him toward the curtain.
“Th-thank you.” Draco says weakly. He blinks away tears. He knows he’s lucky, knows that he’s not the only one who lost people. He watched one of the Weasley twins die not ten minutes after in the very same hallway.
Finally, they make it out to the street, and Harry Apparates them to Grimmauld as fast as possible. He falls onto his hands and knees, panting.
“Come on.” An auror near the back snaps, and Draco’s eyes dart toward him. He’s pretty obviously frightened, and he just stares. “Well, out with it!”
“Well, it was Vince. Crabbe, I mean.” Malfoy finally says. “We had… sort of a friends-with-benefits thing.”
“That tasted disgusting.” He says, although Harry doesn’t seem to have heard. He lays back down, resting his cheek on Harry’s thigh while Harry comes back to himself.
I cut out a few chunks of action from the battle itself, as I didn't really want it spanning more than one chapter and it was already getting so long. I know it's a bit fast, but the war really isn't the main plot of this story (Deadpool voice: this is a
“Aw, sweetheart.” Millie coos, taking Draco from Theo and arranging him to straddle her lap, gently patting his bum.
“I told him I’d like to come home first and make sure you’re settled before I decide.” Harry explains.
“No. Before I told him, I asked why I’m different from where he was before. He said ‘Harry Potter. Good, trust, safe.’ I don’t really know why he says it like that. Afterward, when I asked again, he said ‘Harry Potter. Good, trust, safe now, different.’”
One, whose name Harry doesn’t know, casually reminds Malfoy that the Slytherin common room is meant to be secret, and that non-Slytherins hadn’t been let inside for seven hundred years.
“It’s not like you’ve taken me out to a fancy restaurant, Potter." Malfoy says coldly. "We are friends, we do things friends do, and we also, recently, have added sex. Friends with benefits.”
“I’m going to show Harry around whilst you decide if I’m more important to you than tradition.” Draco announces, standing up.
The stoat lifts its head, looking around the room, and it jumps up onto its feet, spell light fading from its eyes.
“As you get more things, you may run out of space in there, so you can put things wherever you want to.” Harry says.
“That certainly brings back some memories.” Neville jokes, and Ron and Harry laugh. Draco rolls his eyes.
“I must’ve gotten it right, it smells exactly the same as you.” He winks, and before Draco has a chance to respond, bloody Slughorn is there accepting the sample vial.
FAIR WARNING - past non-con and other assault is depicted in this chapter. If that's not something you want to read, skip from when Harry casts Legilimens and you can pick up at the end of the italicized section.
Draco gasps softly as they enter a much warmer bubble and come in view of the lavender field. Harry watches his eyes move over the different varieties of lavender in various corners.
“Y- A-Alright.” Draco says uncomfortably. Harry nods encouragingly. Draco pulls out his notebook, flipping through the pages. “I was scared at first. That she wouldn’t like me or wouldn’t follow the rules. She sat with me and knitted, told me about spending holidays with you, or funny stories about Ron and Hermione.”
“You’re the first.” Draco whines, unsure why he’s answering honestly when he’s supposed to be a professional. If he was, this man wouldn’t be his first.
“That’s like the fourth time you’ve said that, but it’s not an answer to my question.” Harry points out, and Draco drops his eyes.
“And ladies are supposed to wait to be asked to dance, Harry, but it seems we’re flying in the face of propriety now.” She says, her low, silky voice veering dangerously toward Malfoy’s.
So the game goes, and despite being a tad concerned that he would be picked first, Draco starts to get bored when several more turns pass and the bottle doesn’t land on him.
“Why- why- if- why-” Draco frowns. He squeezes his eyes shut. “Harry Potter. Good. Trust. Safe.” He repeats.
Harry shoves the rubbish bin under Draco’s face as he throws up again, getting teary-eyed and shaky like before.
“I- I don’t know. Maybe we could sit down and talk about this with Blaise. Oh, and everyone I’ve talked to has said it would be good for you to meet a mind healer.”
“Of course I would be.” Malfoy says, then sighs. “I don’t know. It’s taxing, but it’s fun to put on a costume for an evening. I get to wear beautiful clothes without anyone thinking it’s strange. I can do or say anything and it doesn’t matter because it’s not me. I can flirt with anyone and it’s chalked up to that strange Meredith Appleby who just vanished from society at the end of the season.”
Alpha looks up then, opening his mouth, but Draco’s hand darts out, his fingers pressing down on the man’s tongue in a way that had to be uncomfortable.
Three of the four frown, and in quick succession, fire three different curses. Draco blocks them all.
So thank you, to everyone who's ever commented on my stories, you mean the world to me and I adore you. I hope you enjoyed this chapter, which (for this story, at least) was not
“Knox, you’re the most responsible person here, I need you to keep everyone from dying while I’m gone. I know there are healers somewhere in this country, so call on one of them if anyone gets broken.”
“To compensate for his betrayal at Christmas, Blaise took me to get my tits pierced. So now they’re sore and the left one hurts when I poke it.”
“If I really think about it, it looks like purple. But everything looks purple, so it sort of translates to grey.”
“Yeah, that was really shitty of you to go after an orphan’s parents.” Harry agrees, still grinning.
Meals were sombre, with sparse attendees and rather sad food. Harry dunked some bread into his soup listlessly, wondering when he’d decided soup to be a food for mourning.
Meredith finally wakes up silently from the floor off to the side, and Harry subtly holds out a hand to indicate she should stay down. She slumps back quietly.
It’s sort of a disappointment, as everything is stored in shoeboxes and garment bags, but it’s easy to see that there are a
Draco explains the dance, guiding Harry through it as they step, his feet moving out of Harry’s way just in time before Harry trods on them.
“Amazing, Potter, you’re an inspiration to us all.” Malfoy drawls, flying very close to Harry and nearly upsetting his delicate balance again.
Malfoy continues his job, unbuttoning his shirt and slipping it over his shoulders to hang on his elbows. Harry slips his hands inside to rest on Malfoy’s pale skin. His chest looks a bit blurry, and running his fingers down it, it
“A gauntlet?” Ron asks, holding it up to his arm. Draco tilts his head. Harry guesses he doesn’t know what a gauntlet is.
“Yeah it did, you’re talking differently now. Do you fake your accent? Have you been faking your accent since I met you?”
“Yes. The bartender is Jack. He’s nice. I only remember once. I was punished for trying to talk to you.” Draco says unhappily.
Unable to help himself, Harry touches his cock. Pulls at it as he waits for Malfoy to keep going. He almost always talks for a few minutes, and with how worked up he is, Harry could use a few minutes.
“You can’t sue Greg’s father for being a prick, Blaise, we’ve been over this.” Astoria says mildly, sharing a look with Draco of fond exasperation.
Considering what Malfoy had said the night before, Harry Apparates to the Manor and lets himself in again just before lunch.
Draco watches as one of the club boys is passed from one cock to another, but he almost looks like he enjoys it. He’s certainly getting paid, too.
Harry follows Draco into the attached bedroom, and watches in confusion as Draco lounges naked on the bed.
stubborn for once, we could’ve had this all worked out sooner. Aren’t you supposed to be good at solving mysteries?”
“Control yourself, I’ve barely started.” He teases, resting a hand on Harry’s thigh. Harry doesn’t answer before Draco leans back in to hesitantly wrap his lips around the tip. It’s a strange sensation, but one he feels he could get used to.
With a flick of his wand, the shoeboxes all fly off the shelves and open so their contents are visible. Malfoy seems to favour very tall, very strappy high heels.
After pouring the potion down the man’s throat, Draco sets about checking his vitals. Stubbins watches closely.
“Like earlier, in the Hall. We should’ve set up a signal so you could’ve tapped out if you didn’t want me to do that then or there, or whatever.”
It’s an easy opening line, and Meredith prods the conversation along with the skill of someone raised in this environment.
“The operation is complete, and I am confident Mr. Devoe will make a full recovery.” Draco told her with a tired smile. She let out a relieved breath.
“I- I’m fine.” Harry stammered uncertainly. “I mean, I’m okay, yeah. I’m just- I’m not used to it anymore, I guess. Caught me off-guard.”
“I’m just checking…” Harry says, reaching out to give it a tug. It takes a minute, but he finally wriggles it back to function properly and unzips the skirt down to the waist. The fabric pulls away from the flawless pale skin. Harry tries not to look.
“I didn’t know about the last bit, about me.” Draco says with a frown. “I wanted the article to be about Sirius.”
“Still in Hufflepuff. McGonagall’s giving them a lecture on tomorrow’s orders. Hermione’s sorting things out with the other Prefects.”
“It’s a shorter list to say what isn’t wrong. I can’t see everything because he won’t undress, but he was fine with a diagnostic spell. He’s covered in bruises, there are old scars on his chest that didn’t heal properly, welts all over his back, two cracked ribs, he has half a dozen different drugs in his system along with three, maybe four STDs, there’s a lot of scar tissue and recent tears lining his anus, his stomach is half the size it should be which suggests he’s been fed by either liquids or a serum injection, his kneecaps are bruised and one of his toes is broken.
“It is. At any rate, Neville’s gran lent him money to start his business with the plants, so he asked me to help. That’s why I work for him now, I didn’t have anything else to do so I just sort of… stuck around. But he told me about how he’d met Jeanette at a market where he was buying some of his starting plants, and she’d noticed his wand fall from his pocket and gave it back to him.”
“Well, the whole point of therapy is for you to be able to make your own decisions, isn’t it?” Harry asks a bit hoarsely. “Shannon helps you understand your feelings, but she doesn’t need to if you already know. The whole thing about you being free now is that you don’t have to let other people decide for you.”
"My father would be mortified if he saw me here." Malfoy says mildly as he drags his fingers along the finish of a dresser.
the chapter the day I post it, but I've been occupied so I'm only now writing up a storm to replenish my queue.
Would he roll Harry over, straddle his hips and lean down… would he grab Harry’s wrists and pin them above Harry’s head, the glinting metal in Harry’s nipples catching his eye… would he take one in his mouth, biting just a little too hard and lick the nipple to soothe the sting… would he press his arse down to grind against Harry’s cock…
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have talked so much. I will be quiet. Tell me what you want me to do.” He said, his eyes widening where they stare at the floor. He looks… scared.
Smith scrambles away toward the fireplace, jumping in with the man already in the flames and disappearing with a whoosh.
He takes Draco’s other hand, folds down all but two of his fingers and uses it to tap himself on the wrist.
“Shut up.” Harry grumbles. “Anyway, everything he knows of me is from after he saw me at the club, so he only knows me as someone who helps him and doesn’t hurt him. So the idea that I nearly killed him doesn’t fit my profile.”
"What-" Draco cries. He searches through his memories frantically, trying to find what was missing, what had been taken. Why was he happy, just now?
“You’re a wizard, I’m sure you know some scary Dark magic spell to fix it.” Harry says, taking his hands off and dropping into the chair.
“Draco! You made it!” Pansy shouts to be heard over the deafening music. “Incredible dress choice, you’ll have to change before you upstage me at my own party. Hi Potter, you look nice.”
“Very well, enjoy your evening, and do call if there’s anything else we can do to ensure you have a pleasurable experience.” The man says, bowing out of the room and closing the door with Malfoy on the inside.
“Yeah. It doesn’t have to be a big deal or anything. You don’t even have to ‘come out’ if you don’t want to.”
Malfoy eats the entire thing save for a single piece of toast Harry eats as slowly as he can at Malfoy’s insistence that Harry has to help him eat it all.
“Okay, am I reading this totally wrong? Did you fuck that year?” Prott asks, completely ignoring the tension.
His magic too evidently had suffered. He received poor marks in every class, just high enough to pass. His teachers had all looked disappointed in him, clearly expecting more of a Malfoy. He’d just shrug and clean up his workspace.
“If you like her now, you’ll adore her when you try the roast.” Ayla says, already halfway through the portion Blaise served her.
Harry feels gleeful, knowing this. Knowing he can make good on his agreement to Malfoy and still get to tease him whilst Malfoy plays nice.
So he takes a shirtless mirror selfie - something he’d ordinarily never do - including all the absurd notes Malfoy’s left himself.
“Well that’s a dumb line to draw, but alright. ‘Hey Malfoy, over the holiday, I really missed you, and I’d like to spend some time with you now that we’re back. Outside school.’ Maybe something like that.”
“No, you’re right, I should be.” Harry says casually, sitting up. Draco is still naked. He tries not to dwell on that fact. “I’ll make us some food.”
“No, I’m named after the constellation, Draco. It’s that one, there.” He says, leaning close for Harry to follow the line of his arm. “Draco was a dragon named Ladon. He guarded Hera’s golden apple tree in her garden, but when Hercules was tasked with stealing an apple, he killed Ladon. Hera put him in the sky and named his stars Draco to remember him by.”
This was a particularly heavy chapter, but things will start to lighten up soon and this is sort of the lowest Draco gets before he accepts help and starts genuinely recovering.
"He's stopping by before he goes to his family's dinner. He'll be tired but I sort of wanted to give him his present straight away."
Draco could believe him. There’s something about the way Potter talks that reminds him of the teenager who inspired people to join him in the war.
“Overbearing is like… like too much attention. Bothering you with too much attention. I think you got upset last weekend when I was spoiling you because I was being overbearing.”
“That’s absurd.” Draco says. “You start conversations all the time, you don’t need to ask who I’m shagging or how or when in order to ask one of your ridiculous questions.”
“No.” Greg says warmly, pulling Draco against his chest and resting his temple against the top of Draco’s head. “Just busy with the holidays.”
Harry opens the room’s door with Malfoy’s hand gripped tightly in his own. The same man from earlier is already walking up the hallway.
“Sorry. It’s just a bit funny to me that it’s you here with me after all this time. You could sleep on the bed if you wanted to, I can’t imagine the window seat is very comfortable or warm.” Harry offers. Draco doesn’t respond, but lays his head back down and starts purring again.
He finally drags Draco over to the bed, pushing him face-down so his bum hangs off the mattress, and Draco has to grab at the sheets to not slip to the floor.
Up a spiral staircase, the largest bedroom opens onto a balcony overlooking the backyard, where the garden extends, already filled with various flowers, fruit trees and vegetable patches, with stone benches scattered throughout.
With no small amount of confusion, Harry watches as Malfoy dumps the paintbrushes onto a stone, fills the glass with water and opens the paint box.
“Absolutely.” Harry says, slipping his free hand into his pocket and pulling out three new glittering gel pens. “I brought these for you.”
“No it doesn’t, it starts to break.” Harry says with a frown. “That’s why wizards can’t use muggle tech, it doesn’t work right around magic.”
“Yeah. They put it on him to make the Imperius stronger. Or maybe so Adams didn't have to cast on him directly, because Adams could use it from the back room while he was out here. I uh. I spent some time reading and found a charm that was specific. It wouldn’t react while he wore it, but anytime he touched it with his hand, it would… I don’t really know how to explain it.”
"Emphasis on past tense." Malfoy says with such unease that both Harry and the girl don't ask anything else about it.
hurt you though. Several times. We’ve fist fought more than once. I gave you those scars on your chest.”
He quickly walks Malfoy through the spells Mad-Eye always uses before touching strange objects, and they stare at the tin when nothing is revealed.
“Blaise said he thinks you like me.” Draco mumbles into his shoulder. Harry’s foot falters on the step, but he’s careful to not startle Draco.
“I think Marion is really nice to be around.” Harry says. “She doesn’t ask questions I don’t want to answer.”
“You don’t. Not anymore.” Harry tells him. Malfoy doesn’t react. “Do you think you can eat something? Maybe some bread and milk?”
“I need something saying Draco’s registered as my emotional support animal.” Harry says, which makes Hermione laugh softly.
“I hope she didn’t tell you anything embarrassing about me.” Harry jokes, and Draco shakes his head.
Draco scowls, but clears the expression away quickly. He wants to seduce the man, not make him think Draco is about to hex his balls off.
Harry was woken up mid-scream, and panting, he realised Draco was stepping on his forehead repeatedly, meowing in concern.
They trudge up to the fourth floor and dig around for a bit until they find the Morning Glory, slightly dented, in the closet. Draco murmurs a spell and the dent disappears.
“Yeah, probably. But I have gotten loads of work with aura mending and tweaking, so that’s something.”
Harry and Draco’s relationship was sort of a secret still, which of course meant everyone in the school knew.
“It seems you’ve missed me.” Draco says cockily, pressing against Harry. Harry only growls, biting his neck and making Draco gasp. He can tell Harry’s leaving marks, but can’t bring himself to care. If he feels differently later, he can easily heal them before going out.
“Anytime I go on a date, I have to give a disclaimer about my past or risk them hexing me when they catch a glimpse of my arm. Even after I got it tattooed over.”
“Did you know pink was originally a little boy’s colour, as it was considered ‘young red?’ And that blue was a demure colour for little girls? It’s almost like gender associations with colour are a social construct.” Harry says tersely. He turns to Draco, who is now glowering spectacularly at the woman. “I swear, more earwax than brains.” Harry mutters.
With a disappointed breath, Draco blinks his eyes open. He sees Greg’s face, familiar and comforting. Astoria is there too, holding one of his hands and patting the back.
“Peacock.” She says about Lucius, with a smirk that looks very much like her son’s. She refuses to elaborate.
"Do you struggle with the dragons because you can't Expelliarmus them?" Draco teases, and Potter laughs.
“It’s not that I’m careless, exactly. I work so fast that shit happens sometimes. It’s not like there’s much lasting damage from it.”
Harry smiles at the thought of Malfoy buzzing in circles around his parents speaking every idea that popped into his head. Maybe it’s how he was as a child, he was certainly energetic enough at eleven.
Malfoy’s twisted so he can see his back in the mirror, and he's attempting to heal himself like that. His shorts are pulled down low on his hips, and he's not wearing a shirt. His pointy face is screwed up in concentration.
“You were what? Full sentences, Potter, I know you can do it if you really try.” Malfoy says tersely.
Draco is very warm and soft, and his skin smells lovely. Harry holds him against his chest, feeling Draco’s steady heartbeat.
He spends most of his time in the dorm, staring out his window, because at least no one but his friends can find him here.
“What brings you here tonight, Meredith?” Harry asks, mostly sure but still wary of blowing his cover if this is not who he thinks.
Draco shakes his head, dropping the glass as he sags against the headboard. Water splashes over his chest before Harry can catch it. He whimpers softly.
“The last one wasn’t too over-the-top. It was almost tame compared to the one she published last winter.” Draco says, having read everything Pansy’s written from her published works to the salacious short stories she’d written when they were in school.
“Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Erm. For Wednesday, I put Ron and Hermione. They’ve been with me forever, they’ve had my back when no one else did. And I’m Rose’s godfather of course - Rose is their daughter. And Hermione’s pregnant again, they told us on Saturday.” Harry ends with an excited grin.
“You’re not in trouble, you didn’t break the rule. We’re changing the rule now. Is that okay?” Harry asks again.
I did not die! A bit of a short chapter, but we're back on schedule again! If anyone was wondering why I dipped off this weekend and didn't update anything, I was moving and didn't get time to write. Usually I'd have enough chapters queued that I wouldn't have had to actually
How could you not, with such a strange face? The features are bewitching, literally. And besides, Harry’s never seen Malfoy so excited about something that wasn't a prank or some nefarious scheme.
She goes on, talking of the levels of pressure the poor elves are under with so many students on top of the repairs at the school, and they’re still uncompensated for their efforts.
if Malfoy came up behind Harry in Potions and whispered in his ear about how hard he came last night on his big glass cock… truly
Scarrow is asked who present has the best arse, and confidently says his own name, claiming it was a valid answer since he
“That’s very sweet of you, thanks.” Harry grins when his hand isn’t immediately burned by the scalding water. “You can put it back when I get out.”
Draco pulls the cloak off his head. It bunches in his hands and covers his crotch mostly, but Ron still looks away.
Potter. Despite what you apparently think of me, they're not just my lackeys, they have personalities and opinions."
"Yes, like a trance. Imperius-like, but it's technically not illegal. George and Fred - you know I'm friends with them, right? They've been helping me find out how to avoid setting people into trances."
“I know I’ve said I don’t think it’s Malfoy, but on the off chance that you’re right… well, if he tried shifting back with the collar on, it would strangle him before he can take it off.” Neville explains.
When Draco releases him, Harry is about to say goodbye for the fifth time when Draco leans in and pecks Harry’s cheek.
“Well, you had a lot going for you. You’re a pureblood wizard, you’re the only son of the Malfoys, which means you’ve inherited your parents’ money, the Manor and everything in it now that they’re gone-”
“Subtle.” Malfoy remarks as Harry passes him in the doorway. “To the left, the drawing room. I have tea ready.”
“Yes.” He fishes bubble wrap out of the box, looking at it curiously. “Muggle gift? I don’t understand.” He asks. Harry laughs.
They don’t speak after that, just dance easily, though it’s not nearly as fun as dancing with Malfoy.
I look forward to your comments! Keep in mind, we still have trials for the Bosses, their fates are not sealed just yet...
“Yes, it was.” Harry says with a smile. “He sort of freaked out because she’s muggle, but she told him her sister is a witch and she knows a wand when she sees one. So they sort of became friends after that, and Neville sent me here when I wasn’t feeling well so I could relax away from everything. No one but Neville and Jeanette would know I was here, so I wouldn’t be bothered by people.”
“I would’ve agreed with you before Seventh year. But now, I think he probably would’ve gotten me out in a much smarter way, I’m sure he wouldn’t have left me there. He’s not as evil as we thought he was.” Harry answers. “I don’t get him, but I’m starting to.”
The truth is no, Harry doesn’t work out, but he’s still rather thin and muscular from flying so much for Quidditch this year.
Malfoy shifts to face away from her, and she gathers his long hair to run down his back, his hands holding his shirt taut against his skin so his wings are mostly flat and out of the way.
“Of course he will. He really likes taking care of you, you know. He’d never bring it up, but he knows he wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you. And I wouldn’t, either.”
In the morning, Draco is quiet. Well, quieter than usual. Harry is extra gentle with him, not sure of what may set him off.
"Sure I do, it's near Christmas." Harry says with a frown. "We don't celebrate it here because you're gone for the hols with your family for a week and a half every year."
“Your first time, you nervous?” He teases, taking a large drink straight from a firewhiskey bottle. Draco grimaces.
“I want to try something, if it’s alright. To start off with.” Harry says, shifting off Draco to lay on his side. His hand reaches over but hovers over Draco’s chest while he waits for Draco’s permission.
“He works for me. A bar would never do well unless it was widely known to have attractive people to look at.”
After dinner, Draco is folding the record player back into its box, and Harry leans against the wall to watch.
After them, Hermione et al performed a magical animation of the story of the Deathly Hallows and the brothers Peverell using a black silk cloth, four hairpins and a bit of moldable clay. It was spectacular, and both Harry and Neville whooped loudly for them.
“Alright. I swear, if I find out later that Ron’s chosen to snog you experimentally and not me, I’m going to be peeved.”
“You know I don’t allow company in the exam room, especially with victims. I trust you, Potter, but victims are always less honest when whoever they’ve latched onto is present, even if it’s not their abuser.”
He’s no longer under the impression that this is a hospital. After all, no one has tried to heal him in any way, despite the cuts and bruises lingering from… wherever he’d been before this. He can’t remember right before, but it’s a small gap in his memory. It was bad, he knows. He doesn’t care to examine further.
Would he whisper between bites, about how he’s wanted Harry to make a move since he’d first let himself be caught wanking at night… would he say he’s still slick and open from his time in the shower… would he say he wants Harry’s cock inside him, wants to bounce on Harry’s cock and hear Harry’s cries and groans and feel Harry’s cum fill him…
“Considering he’d been beaten and assaulted, I’d say being with you at all is already better. What did he say about everything, does he want to leave?”
“Alright. You can go to bed anytime you’d like to, even if I haven’t. And you can ask me to go with you if you’d like. Okay?”
He rereads it, the parts about Draco thinking Harry was ‘better’ than he imagined, the bit about Draco getting off to Harry’s skill in magic and flying.
“Okay, after this, let’s get rid of the rule. The only reason for it was so you didn’t get in trouble with the Ministry, but now they’ve pardoned you so it’s okay.”
Still laughing, Malfoy tries to catch Harry's hands, though weakly, and eventually gives himself up to the assault.
Harry shrugs, tugging the tie from his mussed knot of hair. He drags his fingers through it but decides it’s not worth the effort now. Maybe after the adrenaline fades.
As he walks, led by hand by this new man, someone walks alongside Draco and slips their hand up his thigh and onto his naked arse cheek.
Thank you all so very much for reading, I hope you enjoyed this little epilogue along with the rest of this story. Special thanks to everyone who commented - you kept me motivated to see this story through!
“It was. And er… yeah, Ginny’s dating one of her teammates, so they were both there for Christmas Eve. Erm. Mr. Weasley got a promotion at work, Percy’s back in town.”
He tries to think of the various blokes he’s seen nude at this point. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, all of his dormmates at some point or other, and a few other lads in his year who share the dorm bathroom.
to bear children - which she doesn’t, by the way, not that you care - The entire internet and most of the wizarding world is aware of my sexuality and my relationship to Harry.” Draco says all in one breath. “He’s a bit of a celebrity, you know. I am too, now.”
"Yeah. I mean. I was a little curious about the place George had mentioned, he's said he's come here a lot and I couldn't imagine why he would, but I guess-"
"Alright well if you're poisoned, I'll bring your corpse to the Quidditch pitch for the birds to eat."
Draco Malfoy taking a cab is a bit of a funny image to Harry, but he passes an address to the driver and sits back, taking Harry’s hand.
if Malfoy sat down in the Great Hall and wriggled around like he did at breakfast, hole stuffed full by a plug that only he and Harry know about…
Harry starts untangling his limbs from the broken lights trying to get up and see his friend quickly.
Draco squeezes his hand around the foreign wand. He's not sure if this memory is real or not. He can't be sure of most of his memory these days.
This chapter is a bit longer than the usual, but I think the length works better with the more action-y stuff like leaving the flat.
“What if those were part of a set?” Harry protests, standing up and brushing crust crumbs off his clothes.
“Does it feel nice to have those things written down so you don’t have to worry about forgetting them?”
The examiner seems to be thrown off by Draco’s command, but he glances down at his notes before evidently deciding to go off-script.
Once Harry and Draco had made their way back home with full stomachs and arms full of gifts, Draco topples immediately onto the sofa. Harry sat down on the unoccupied end, and leaned his head back, smiling widely at the happiness and warmth left over.
“No, but once you dry off, your skin is dry. Can I show you? I’m going to scratch you very lightly.”
Harry can’t imagine not knowing his own name except for an offhand comment made by a person he didn’t recognise anymore. Especially not when he was being called all sorts of other things by people who hurt him.
After trying to get his morning tea going and accidentally ripping open a tea bag in his haste, Draco forgoes routine and heads out early.
He gets a few glares, but no protests. Some of the Slytherins are noticing Malfoy’s odd behaviour, and he brushes them off. He jumps in his seat when Pansy Parkinson puts what’s likely meant to be a comforting hand on his shoulder, only to withdraw it just as suddenly.
“He was acquitted, and therefore is in good standing with the law. They only see that aspect, not the details.”
When he goes back downstairs, Draco hasn’t moved, he’s just staring at the wall across from him. Harry frowns, but leaves him, putting together some tea and sandwiches.
“He came to work with me two days last week, and he saw Neville making a potions order and mentioned that Neville should slice the leaves once instead of chopping them up, so Neville just let him do the whole thing. Draco did a great job.” Harry explains.
.” Draco huffs, then laughs. “But anyway, getting a wand helped me control it, and being taught to use my brain more than pure magic to solve things.”
“I’m awake, what’s wrong?” Harry asks, blinking his eyes open. It’s barely morning, blue-tinged light coming through the window.
“Why don’t you wear stuff like this all the time?” Harry asks. “You own enough to wear a different set every day for at least a month.”
have become pointier, and Harry’s glad the Change had only left him slightly more pointy than he already was, at least in the face.
“What the hell, Robards, is this some kind of joke?” Harry asks angrily, waving the parchment in indignation.
Draco manages to catch him, lowering him slowly to the floor on his back. But that means he can’t block other spells.
Finally, with a nod across the floor, they move in toward the back room. Malfoy is in front, leading the way, and Harry follows as discreetly as he can.
“The scars?” Draco asks, cursing himself for not remembering to cover them before undressing. “About seven years.”
“Draco, Ron would never hurt you. I know he can get mad, but, honestly, he wouldn’t hurt you no matter how angry he is.”
“Secretaries. A couple aurors. But no one would listen to a criminal, even if it’s been fifteen years. If I’d only know his name...” Jack sighs. “Everyone used his fake name, only the main bosses knew. I tried everything I could think of.”
The man rolls his eyes, and gets closer still. He sits on the cot. Far too close. His hand rests on Draco’s thigh.
“I did for a bit. But I started feeling a bit grubby in them, and I felt stupid when aurors would come by and I looked like I’d just gotten out of bed at three in the afternoon on a Tuesday.”
Then again, it was his father’s doing, having Draco Marked, and he’d locked Draco out of the wards once he caught word of Draco slicing the Mark from his arm. He still has a huge scar where it had been - and nearly died in the process.
“Maybe eight years ago.” Draco says with a little smirk, which Potter rolls his eyes at. “But no, what can I say? I do love meat.”
Pansy squeals, and sets off on a story about Blaise’s most recent pet project, who had been at the house for Pansy to babysit whilst he did some toy training as Blaise attended product meetings.
“Draco, Draco, wait please.” Harry says, pulling away. Draco ignores him, shifting to grind their cocks together with a small moan.
Harry’s irritation ebbed away almost as quickly as it had risen, and the tension had seeped from his shoulders by the time Malfoy pulled away.
“Huh?” Harry asks, realising after a second that his face is nuzzled into Draco’s neck and his erection is pressed into Draco’s thigh. He feels incredible. “Oh, sorry.” He mumbles, rolling back over to his side. His body is cold without Draco beneath him.
Potter snorts, stacking up his bacon and biting off at least half of the strips. Ashe makes a little whimpering noise as she downs half her coffee.
