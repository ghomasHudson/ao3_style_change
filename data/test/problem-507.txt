Draco brushed his nose against Harry’s. He could close the minute distance, take a chance, kiss Harry. He thought Harry might want him to. But he wasn’t brave enough, wasn’t brave at all.
Potter smiled tentatively; Draco returned Potter’s smile with the one he’d been reliably told was
Harry’s face was bright red, or Draco assumed it was bright. It was too hard to see to be sure.
Harry also rose to shake hands and knocked over the table’s golden reindeer centerpiece. He fumbled to right it and thought, “Solicitor, huh? You look more like a cover of a romance novel.”
He applied the salve, wished he could put some on his emotions, decided the entire letter writing could also fuck off, and left for the stadium. He needed to finish the Hogwarts t-shirt design and doing something would be better than agonizing over whether he should
“Okay if I—” Harry didn’t finish with words. Instead, he dropped his hands to Draco’s button and fly.
I suck at the long slow burn.  I really do.
The title of this chapter comes from
therapy session had been intense. She’d let him rant about That Twat who somehow had taken over
“I don’t need time to know that he hasn’t changed one bit since Hogwarts. He’s still an entitled brat doing nothing while the rest of us work our arses off.” Draco huffed and removed Blaise’s hand from his head. “And don’t touch my hair.”
For a moment, he saw the dark lines of a tattoo—or thought he did—but again, it was gone. Maybe they needed a break.
“Nothing,” Draco laughed. “It’s just—tall, dark, and—”
He doesn’t know about Harry, but Draco is too wobbly to move, too deliciously relaxed. But the tub floor is a bitch on his knees, and the hot water is running out.
“Hey Dyl, it’s me,” Harry said hoping he kept the dread out of his voice. The cardinal had returned to the bush in front of the window. For a moment, Harry wished he were a bird and could just not have fingers to hold a phone.
Potter looks up, and his voice sounds as fragile as I feel. “I was—I—couldn’t just let you die. I knew you’d changed. That when the war was over, you’d do good things.”
money came from. He’d gone to Gringott’s in Manhattan and they’d given him something called an ATM card linked to his account and showed him how the Muggle machines would give him cash. He also met with their No-Maj specialist, who gave him a phone and wouldn’t let him leave til he knew the right lingo.
He stepped out of his trousers and removed his pants without Harry asking.
Harry moved in even closer, and his nose skimmed Malfoy’s. “Luckily, I don’t pay you,” he whispered. He moved quickly, angled away from Malfoy, and called, “Dimplethwait. What are the Cannons worth to you?” He barely kept the laughter from his voice, because he'd tricked Malfoy. Made him look stupid.
“What? She said she’d get the team here at 11. I figured that was a good way to keep the first meeting short.”
Harry shrugged and carefully laid Puck onto the bed, but she was up and out of the room before her feet hit the bed. He looked at the jumble of sheets and blankets for another moment and allowed himself to feel the emptiness of the bed.
“I’ll see what Kreacher’s cooking?” Harry felt light-headed, giddy with the idea of Draco in his house again. He thought Draco might not hate being with him. Maybe, he might even like Harry a little. Of course, it had only been two days. But Harry had spent 7 years at Hogwarts ignoring his crush on Draco, pretending it was anger or spying or a dozen other things. The time they’d spent together brought Harry’s feeling back to the surface.
“Malfoy! Hey! You’re a surprise!”
Harry waited and listened. Fear and sadness passed over Draco’s face, but he didn’t say anything else.
When he Floo’d home, he scrounged for a decent piece of parchment and a working quill. He scratched out,
Ok, they weren’t really
“All of that, yeah. But I meant today.” Draco waggled the turkey drumstick he’d grabbed from the platter of leftovers. He brought it to his mouth but laid it on a plate instead. “It was definitely a good.”
Brought to you by this prompt:
In between one heartbeat and the next, Draco’s lying on the bed. Harry kneels over him, straddling his torso, and there’s no mistaking that Harry’s into this.
“It is, because otherwise it would be bad for business,” Harry said. “But…”
spoke with adults and children about the event, asked the players their opinions on the new ownership and all of the gimmicks to increase attendance. She spoke with Harry and Draco in their office and used a proper quill rather than a
“Asked him, did you? Had a mature, frank discussion about your friendship, and what you would hope to see it become?“
“They’re not even good,” I say, and if I had any heat in my body, I’d blush.
And the amazing thing was that she wanted him. He was nothing. Just Harry, famous for something he hadn’t even done. Being with her had been passionate and electrifying, but it had also been easy, comfortable, like slipping on his Hogwarts robes after a long summer with the Dursleys.
“And?”
“One interesting thing about Number 12 is that it’s located in the heart of a Muggle neighborhood. Considering what we just heard from my great aunt, it’s surprising she chose to live here. The house is unplottable and is under a Fidelus Charm, so no Muggle ever bothered them.”
So, the quill wasn't supposed to send the wrong letter.  But I have a strict Advent policy that I do what my brain says to. But That wasn't the fic I set out to write 25 chapters about, as you can probably tell by the title. I'm going to end this fic at chapter 12, and start a new one with the rest of the prompts. I hope you'll follow that one, too.
Harry looked over, and to him, Draco seemed wistful. Sad. Not his face, which showed no emotion, but his shoulders had dropped, and he’d shoved his hands a little deeper into his coat pockets.
Draco smiled.
Malfoy whispered
“Uh, yeah,” Harry said, wondering where Malfoy wanted to sit. When Malfoy put his dinner next to Harry’s, Harry was speechless. “Brilliant. That’s—yeah that’s good.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t—what was so important?”
Harry nodded. “We need a plan. And help.”
Draco thought he felt the house sigh and settle. When Draco left the closet, the house felt less gloomy and more like a home.
and when he looked back, Potter was watching Draco. His eyes, so green before, seem to be mostly pupil, dark and deep, and Draco felt overwhelmed, like he had no idea what to do when Potter looked at him like that.
Malfoy turned to Potter, surprise written on his face. “That’s—incredible,” he said quietly. “It’s brilliant. When did you—”
Draco found a Muggle phone booth around the corner from Grimmauld and ducked inside. When he was certain no one was around, he tapped his wand on the phone and waited for the dial tone before dialing.
prompt:
Draco shivered and pushed the thought out of his mind.  As he backed out of the room, his hip knocked into a small end table; a crystal stag wobbled and almost fell from the table. “Thank Merlin no one lives here,” he said as he steadied the statue.
“Did you hear—”
Draco snorted at his ignorance. “Really? That’s what you think?”
“Harry?” Draco said, as if he were rolling the word around in his mouth. “Nope. Seems suspicious.” Potter laughed and Malfoy added, “And you can call me Draco.”
“I’m glad you’re awake,” Harry answered, his voice raspy from disuse. “Whatever you were dreaming, it must have been a hell of a nightmare.”
There was no bro-space.
“Thanks for coming on short notice.” Draco jumped up from the bench and gave him a quick hug and a back pat.
“You arse! Why did you do that,” Pansy whispered harshly. “This is great. The audience is gonna love it.”
“I don’t care.”
He could almost hear Dyl’s voice pitching up as he worked himself into a self-righteous rage. Harry picked up his phone, meant to dial but opened Twitter instead. He scrolled through his

“Of course.”
“What?” Draco asked, looking from Pansy to Blaise and back again. “What was a possibility?”
based on this pic;
“I don’t usually sleep over because it’s too much like a proper relationship. But when I got home, I knew I’d fucked up, because all I wanted was to be back with you.” Draco’s lips brushed Harry’s forehead. “If I haven’t done irreparable damage, could we try again?”
“Alright, Blaise?” Potter asked, coming up behind them. He nodded at Draco and smiled tentatively.
As Draco unrolled the paper, his heart fell. It was his own letter, the one he’d sent to Potter.
also, this chapter, in which I did THE. THING.  (i used the title in the chapter. I love when writers do that)
Draco woke slowly, unwilling to shake off the gorgeous night’s sleep; he hadn’t moved all night, just fell into a deep slumber, waking rested and refreshed. The comforter felt heavy but pleasant over him. But then the comforter moved, adjusted itself, and snuffled.

“Sorry I scared you; it’s just—I knew it had to be you. No one believed Weasley was the baker; she’s all thumbs. It was either you or the hot dragon brother.”
which I had no idea was the name of this song.
Harry was careful—almost to the point that Draco wanted to make him hurry, but when he was fully naked, he knew it was worth it. Harry crawled up Draco, stopping to kiss his calves, the inside of his thighs, to mouth at his balls.
the prompt:
“I’ll add in an insulation spell so that the cold won’t come through. This way you can enjoy the park view year-round.”
“Why don’t you date?” He speaks slowly and the gaps between words is getting long. It’s the thousand cuts from the knife.
Draco sat in his chair again and took Harry’s hand. “I get it, Potter. I get that you couldn’t tell me. But I don’t think I can live like that, never knowing if you’re coming home.”
Malfoy did as he was told, which was shocking on its own. But then he said, “He was right, you know.”
to carry them like a Muggle, but Draco’s face did this funny thing, which made Harry’s heart do this funny thing. He should be cranky, but he couldn’t remember the last time he had this much energy at 7 pm.
“What does it
Draco bit his lip. The house had locked every bedroom except Harry’s, which was warm and bathed in soft light, different than it had been.
“I’ll be there,” Potter said with a smile. “I had something new called a
Dylan sounded bright and excited. “Hey, babe. You almost here? I made reservations at—no, I want to surprise you. But I will say it’s in Disney Springs. The reservations are for 1:30, but if you’re almost home we’ll make it no problem.”
They had to clean the room before Draco could propose any renovations and cleaning was slow going.
Draco tossed and turned in bed thinking about the letter. It wasn’t much, more like an opening gambit to find a way to tell Potter how he felt.
anything!” Harry grabbed the Kevin Kiermaier bobblehead back from Malfoy and carefully slid it back in its place on the shelf between his Mike Trout and Noah Syndergaard-en Gnome. “It’s just—it’s just nice.”
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “Maybe we can use the Confessional camera—”
Draco guided Harry’s joggers and pants down his hips, careful not to catch Harry’s cock. He slid his finger over the slick tip, and Harry gasped. “Fuck yeah,” he said, needing Draco’s fingers, his hand, his mouth. Any of them. All of them.
Their Healer training kicked in. Gown on. Hair covered. Scrub up. Listen to report. Assess the patient. Granger took the patient to the right, the one without Dark Magic damage.
He formed a tight circle with his lips and held his breath as Draco pushed through, slowly, slowly. If Harry hadn’t been fully hard, his cock lying heavy against his thigh, the sweet, graveled sound Draco made would have done it.
in the middle of Diagon Alley, or at the bookstore. Maybe he could duck into Eyelops, buy some treats for post owls. Did they sell crups or even dogs?
Before he opened the door to leave, Malfoy turned back to Ginny. “I don’t understand the name of your shop. Rolling Scones? It makes no sense.”
“Can I deliver them and head home?” she asked, checking the clock. “I’m supposed to meet Luna at 5 at the Burrow for dinner, and you know how my parents are when they’re with her alone for too long…”
“Alone or with you?”
would be taken away from him. He’d lived more in the past week and a half than he had in ten years. He’d woken with a purpose, cleaned-scrubbed-painted on a mission to meet their re-opening, and he’d fallen in love. Earlier he’d wished Ginny had never asked him to buy the Cannons. That had been a big, fat lie.
“Alright. Let me hear it.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. He was frowning, but Harry saw that he was having difficulty holding off his laughter.
“Yeah, I know. No one plays Quidditch indoors. But we can configure the extension charm so that no matter where the players fly, the stadium will accommodate it. And, the best part is, we can regulate the temperature. It can be a constant 24 degrees inside. No more freezing your bollocks off.”
He shook his head and walked out.
He laughs but I can tell he doesn’t think it’s funny.
Through his Auror work, Ron knew a bloke who had a mate whose cousin’s wife was top notch with magical renovation and environmental spells. And since the cousin’s wife had several times been found a hairsbreadth on the right side of the law, she was in no position to blab secrets.
ask him,” Harry admitted, folding the blanket and draping it over the back of the couch. “It’s just easier to be angry.”
“Merlin, Potter! Can you please just make a freaking decision?” Draco yelled in Tickles’ Fine Furnishings and Rug Emporium.
“Muggle songs, huh?” was all Harry asked.
Harry nodded and tried to frown. “Because when the Caerphilly Catapults saw the indoor stadium, they refused to take the field.” He bit his lips not to smile, not because that part had been great, because it hadn’t. But the 1999 Cannons. They were legendary to Cannons fans. Harry’d read tons of articles about them, and he’d met them, shook their hands, had his picture taken with them.
It made no sense to Harry. But he loved it. Skipped out of cold, grey London the minute his Healer training ended to whatever far away vacation destination needed a Concierge Healer.
This was a sin. Harry’s anger rose, hot fierce on behalf of the Cannons’ employees. Why would he own a Quidditch team and let it rot like this? Didn’t Dimplethwait know what an honor it was, how lucky he was, to own the Cannons?
Harry pushed him toward the Hogwarts team, and his heart didn’t skip a beat when Draco flipped him off.
As a child, Draco had been a picky sleeper much like
He spelled the light on, using the dimmest setting and was surprised to find that at some point, Malfoy had migrated to Scorpius’ bed. Scorpius was snuggled into a ball with one hand out reaching for his dad as he slept.
Okay, so what. He and Potter went to the cinema when they could
No Potter. No owl.
My heart pounds trying to beat out of my chest; I’ve never told anyone that, nothing close to how they used to come at me in the dark. I think my honesty shocks him because he doesn’t respond, so I forge ahead, afraid that in the quiet, my mind will respond with some obscene Shakespeare paraphrase: to die or not to die. “Do you even have any feeling in your fingers? I’m numb.”
First off, this chapter has no right to be a chapter. But I think this is how it's gonna be, guys. Some days I just won't get a chance to write. I'm committed to this, so hang with me.
Harry fought not to say. Instead of answering, he waved to Sixten and plastered on a fake smile.
Just as he pointed, the door to Number 12 Grimmauld Place opened. Draco squinted, unable to see more than a blurry figure wearing trousers who might possibly be crossing the street. Or waiting for a cab. Also, it could possibly have been a tree.
Ginny.
“Was looking forward 2 movies 2morrow nite—text when U R okay.”
Dyl’s smile was back. “I’ll pack for us, but not too many clothes.” He winked and blew Harry a kiss as he headed out the door.

“Jesus, fuck, Draco—”
Draco had heard about Muggle telly shows like this, where they trick some poor sucker and make him look stupid.
“It’s really okay,” Draco said and covered Harry’s hand with his.
Draco realizes he's the chosen one.
Merlin, that was—too close to the truth.

Harry reached for the soap, but Draco stopped him. “Let me.” He washed Harry’s shoulders, his chest, his stomach and listened to Harry’s breath for when it hitched. At the nipples and when Draco’s hand came close to Harry’s hard cock but didn’t touch it.
I flinch because I was also trained that Father was never wrong. I thought it would be hard to break that belief, but once you see your father allow Pure Evil to live in your home and close his eyes to anything that’s happening to his own family—no. It wasn’t hard to break at all.
Harry tried to shake it off as he nudged them awake. But they looked so alike—their eyes thick with sleep, their hair wonky and messy—he thought he was beyond this desire for a family. He’d moved past it when he’d left England. Come to terms with being a bachelor.
200 people if we’re lucky and don’t count the tickets we gave away.”
“Astoria and I began casually dating out of Hogwarts, mostly to make our parents happy. A party here, a party there. A little champagne, a lovely evening. Nine months later, Scorpius was born. We were too young and too little in love to make our marriage work, not to mention too scarred from the War.
“Yeah, he told me all about the show, and I signed on right there.” Potter looked at Blaise like he hung the moon, the stars, and created magic all at the same time.
He brushed his nose against Draco’s, and this was the world: their lips close but not touching, their shaky breaths matching, Harry’s thighs pressed against his, and the bed.
He never did figure out where

room. Get your own room. There are, like, 100 bedrooms here. Pick another one.”
“One sneeze and you’re gonna fall off the bed,” Potter said standing at Draco’s bedside. He had wrapped a towel around his waist and held it with his right hand.
“You really think we can get away with indoor Quidditch?” Draco asked, pouring tea for both of them. “What about the twat who owns Puddlemere? He complains about everything.”
“No, he really said it,” Potter said, and Draco was thankful that he hadn’t questioned what the fuck Draco was saying.
Malfoy hadn’t spoken, hadn’t tried to butt in. But he was watching Harry with a weird look on his face.
“Stop laughing at me.”
I know this chapter is short, but it said everything it needed to say!
With a huff that was supposed to mean
“I’m sorry about this morning. It must have been awkward for Blaise to find you in bed with me.”
Draco sat back in the kitchen chair and smirked.
Vanishing the glass and potion ingredient took no time, so Harry moved on to the contents of the corner cabinet.
Harry nodded. He had way too much experience with Kreacher.
folded and tucked under his arm so the title was hidden and performed a discreet spell so the people in the photographs didn’t move.
Harry buried his face in Puck’s neck and allowed himself to feel the emptiness, the loneliness he’d pushed away that morning. “I’ve fucked this up pretty good, Puck. I don’t know. He had his reasons, and I could’ve listened.”
“Fucking Merlin, Potter. There’s not enough bleach to clean that image out of my head, and I swear to God, you better have bleach scrubbed every surface you
Just the person Harry was looking to hire for some secretive but completely legal work on the stadium. Someone who’d do what they were told and not ask any questions. And absolutely not go to the
Draco forgot everything except ‘Dark Magic damage.’ It was his specialty, but he worried each time that something new would come through that he couldn’t solve, couldn’t reverse.
“You say that a lot,” Draco said with a raised eye brow. “Much too often for my comfort.”
The next morning, Harry woke to the tap tap tap of an owl at his window. He nudged Draco to roll over so he could slip out of bed. The great barn owl hopped on the windowsill, one foot to the other as if it were too cold to stay in one place for long. “Sorry, mate.” Harry shivered as he traded the message for an owl nut. “Off you go.”
Harry huffed out in frustration. “What? I told you I’d owl her, and I did.”
The bed.
After dinner, which Draco was surprised was (a) not poisoned and (b) pretty good, he took his suitcase out of his trouser pocket and set it on the floor. Within seconds, it was regular size. “Time to find you a new room, Potter,” Draco said, wheeling his suitcase out of the kitchen, then levitating it up the stairs.
He takes Harry into his mouth, and he’s the biggest Draco’s ever been with (because, of course he is). Harry’s loud and totally into it, calling Draco
“Ginevra.”
“I’m not ignoring you. It’s nowhere near Christmas.”
Draco dragged his eyes away from-- “Was that a compliment? I almost recognized it as such.”
“If you sleep like that, you’re going to be stiff all over.”
Christmas still made him homesick for Hogwarts. Having Malfoy here with his British accent and his posh ways, and his stupid face and shared history made the longing worse.
“That’s quite enough, Scorpius. Quite enough. It’s time for you to rest now.”
“The Quidditch subcommittee of the International Quidditch Association finds in favor of the Chudley Cannons—”
I push my thoughts of death to the side, stuff them into the back of my mind and try wandless magic again.
“Who lives in a pineapple under the sea—” Potter and Granger sang off key, or Merlin-forbid, those were the actual notes.
“Doesn’t that make it incredibly difficult to live with someone? Why would you do that to yourself?” Malfoy asked, without any purebred snobbery Harry expected.
“You’re right.”
“You too, Potter.”
Malfoy stepped off the hearth, and with a flick of his wand the rubbish was gone. “Doesn’t Kreacher take care of that?” he asked, slowly taking in the room.
Harry pulled his jacket tighter against the cold, morning temperature and stalked off through the car park to the building where Dimplethwait’s office is. Was. Had been. Malfoy could do whatever the fuck he wanted. Harry was going to sweep out every last bit of the previous owner and remodel the office the way he wanted. He needed to think of this as theirs now.
“Nope. Nope. Hard Nope.” Potter ripped the parchment from Draco’s hand and slammed it down onto the pile. “Next.”
Wizard Scabies: a dermatologic condition caused by an eight-legged microscopic mite. They’re highly contagious and spread easily from person to person through close physical contact.
Draco knew that, right? Because as Harry watched him, he wasn’t sure Draco did. He looked shocked, eyes wide and mouth open.
Harry and Draco jumped apart as bowls and plates appeared on the table. Hot soup splashed onto Harry’s hand.
Draco laughed, but he knew it was true. He’d been pecked more times than he could count. He looked at the Manor with a critical eye, as if he were a stranger. “This place could use a good coat of paint and to have most of this overgrown landscaping dug up.”
“I do!” Scorpius raised his hand high in the air. “Me!”
“Sure it is.” Ginny took a warm chocolate chip cookie that Harry handed her. “Imagine everyone is a hot croissant, and you’re butter. Everyone will be better for being with you, and you’ll be part of something better. Okay, okay,” she laughed when Harry snorted. “The example fell apart, and now I just want a croissant.”
Malfoy looked wary. “A numbing spell?”
“Since I moved here three years ago, I live more like a Muggle. It makes things easier.” Before Malfoy could say anything nasty, Harry added, “Yes Mr. Sunshine is a Muggle.”
He took Draco’s hand and led him up the stairs toward his bedroom.
He didn’t have to fake it. Life had found him, grabbed him by the wrist and yelled
“Potter, don’t be a lazy git. Start cleaning something. I think you can use a spell to get rid of the glass and uh—potion ingredient.”
happy that Harry had shown up.
Over an everything pizza (“Absolutely no anchovies, Potter. I told you that last time!”), Draco read the letters to Potter, who put them in
“Not that you idiot,” Draco said. He pointed to the garish red apron and said, “That.”
Draco sighed and closed his eyes. A little more sleep couldn’t hurt.
“Just—do your paperwork,” he said, pointing to the giant pile of folders on Harry’s desk. How Potter was allowed to bring official Auror folders out of the office, Draco would never understand. “Blokes think it’s dead sexy, you know, when—”
“That’s not fair,” Potter said as he headed into the bathroom. “I don’t daydream.”
Harry squirreled that information away for the moment, but made a mental note to ask again later.
“Nothing if you don’t know the diagnostic spells. Give it back.” Harry shook his head at Malfoy, as if to say
This love/hate relationship he had with a woman who was old enough to be his grandmother.
“No—no, I’m not.” Harry’s shoulders fell as he closed his eyes.
It was easy for Harry to think of a good memory to conjure his Patronus; he remembered the feeling of Draco straddling him the night before, their bodies pressed together. He couldn’t dwell on the memory or he’d embarrass himself. He sent the message to Kreacher and then decided to move on to cleaning the closet. Merlin only knew what he’d find in there. Probably another dozen Niffler statues, knowing Dimplethwait.
Pretty much exactly like that.
He had no idea why he was still going out with Dylan, who at 22, was 6 years younger than Harry. With an ass and abs so beautiful they belonged in a museum.
Harry frowned as Malfoy slid an envelope across the scratched table. It seemed kind of thin for the contract, or anything about the Cannons. He flipped the envelope and immediately recognized the wax seal.
Harry has no idea why he doesn’t want to smash Draco’s face in so much any more.
“But—”
Hermione looked confused. “Harry said the same thing. With your weekly dates and all the time you spend together, I assumed he was lying.”
“Doesn’t that hurt?” I force the words out, hoping focusing on Potter instead of dizziness will settle my head.
Draco laughed. “I don’t know how to tell you this, Potter, but it’s not early.” He tried to roll over to check the time, but Harry held him tighter.
Dinner was a chance to start over.
Harry thought, gripping his mug.
“Before I begin, I always ask permission from the house,” Draco explained to the camera. “Especially houses that have been in families for centuries. We find that the house becomes a protector and will actively fight against anything it perceives will hurt the family.”
“You really
“Fuck this,” Draco growled, shutting the window. He gave his owl a treat before Flooing to the party. There were plenty of fish in the sea. He wasn’t the only prize in the box of Cracker Jacks. Or whatever the saying was. There were plenty of hot blokes who worked at the hospital.
Harry jumped at the surprise of Draco’s hand on his shoulder and voice in Harry’s ear. His heart raced from the shock. Probably from the shock.
“I’m sure it wasn’t. And were you the only two to take that Portkey?”
“Mr. Potter. Welcome, welcome.” Mr. Dimplethwait stood behind his desk which was packed with potted orchids. “Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to talk to me.” He smiled wide, and it seemed genuine. Kindly. With his close-cut white hair and his little paunch, he reminded Harry of someone’s granddad. “Please. Have a seat.”
“I don’t want to be mean, but look, Harry. You’ve turned into some old man. A 29-year-old shouldn’t have—routines!” Ginny waved her hand at him, as if he didn’t know she was talking about him. “Like, sure. You’re getting up to go to work and grab a coffee at the same place, or you have lunch with the same people every day. That’s normal. But you don’t even have a job. You sit around all day, waiting for the next appointment on your list so you can check it off.”
But all he saw was Pansy Parkinson behind the camera that she had jammed in his face. And Harry Potter.
Draco ground his teeth to hold his words back. He’d think of a slow, incredibly painful death for Zabini. And one day, when Blaise had forgotten about this spectacle, he’d kill him. And not one Wizengamot member would convict him, once Draco told his story.
and telling him how good he is at this,
“Bite your tongue, Arthur Weasley,” Molly gasped. “It will be at our home until I’m too feeble to lift a wand.”
Malfoy stared before looking away at the rest of the shop.
Malfoy put the empty water bottle on the table, moving slowly. “This is weird. You and me, in the same room. Chatting cordially with each other.”
“The minute I laid eyes on Scorpius, he was everything to me. Astoria never wanted to be a mum. She wanted to be a wealthy debutant and believed the War had robbed her of the chance. We both got what we wanted.”  Malfoy stared at Harry, almost daring him to disagree.
Kreacher appeared in the doorway to the living room, wearing a bath towel as a toga. “You have returned. The rightful heir of the House of Black has returned to restore us to our former glory.” He attempted to bow at the waist, but Harry was certain by the gurgles of pain, that Kreacher was stuck.
Draco watched her walk away and said, “That one was. It’s a crap knock off. Shame she doesn’t know.”
Draco kissed Harry, kissed until they couldn’t breathe, until the room spun, until the world spun.
“Maybe she’s just busy,” Harry offered, nibbling the gingerbread cookie he’d picked up.
Potter was out the door, but Draco called him back. “Hey, Potter. Thanks. For that.”
Sixten sighed. “You probably won’t be called to speak, but if you are, remember: be obsequious, but not too obsequious. Be straight forward and answer their questions, but not too forward—”
“You said so, Papa! Whenever you tell me that story at bedtime, you say
Which launched Potter and Granger into a loud discussion about which Muggle devices—like this iPhone—needed to be introduced into wizard society. Draco listened and didn’t understand a single word. But he didn’t mind listening to Potter’s voice, deep and soothing with a nice laugh.
“Jesus, Malfoy, your mother’s a menace.” Harry said, holding the thong up by one of the side strings.
“Fuck, yes,” he says through gritted teeth.
The title of the chapter comes from the Simon and Garfunkel song,
He sends me a return owl, to meet him at 6 the next night inside King’s Cross by Platform 9 ¾. I shrug, and again. Why not. I have nothing better to do.
Draco snorted, but his derision missed the mark and landed into something Harry thought sounded fond. “As if you would know how to comport yourself at tea in Harrods.”
Harry flipped him off. “Just go talk to your boyfriend so he can save the world.” He fell back against the wall and looked away from Malfoy.
“What now?” Potter asked, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jeans which were so tight that frankly, Draco was amazed they fit.
Dimplethwait shook his head and shrugged again, as if things were beyond his control. “I know. I know. I’ve brought in a specialist to help, and we’ve cut corners everywhere we could.”
Draco laughed, a good, rich belly laugh until he leaned against the edge of Travis & Boyle’s Harpischord Haven.
“Making sure we know who’s in charge?” Harry asked, nodding toward the seating in front of them.
“Holy—fuck.”
“You two know each other?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded annoyed at the interruption, but he was pretty sure he sounded whiny and surprised.
“Potter, I’m back.”
“Brilliant!” Harry took back the wand. “As we go through your examination, I’ll ask you for a color. You just answer the best you can, ok?”
“Take your clothes off.”
Ginny chatted with the security wizard a moment, and with his permission, she led Harry down the damp hallways toward the owner’s office. “Wait,” was all she said as she wiped the perspiration from her forehead. “You’ll enjoy Mr. Dimplethwait.”
Harry forced his chair away from the table. He stood, leaning threateningly close to her. He pulled the collar of his jumper away, exposing his neck, pointing at the vein that throbbed with anger. “Just ask for the jugular next time. It’ll be easier.”
When Draco wedged his thigh in between Harry’s legs, it left no doubt what he was thinking, either.
“When he tells me he hasn’t seen his Aunt Pansy or Auntie Daphne in months, that’s a real red flag because Pansy and Astoria are like sisters, and Daphne is her actual sister. Not seeing them for a week is unusual; not seeing them for months is alarming.”
They got dinner beforehand
“I thought you had to spend every minute of every day inside the house,” Potter snarked, and Draco could feel every word flipping him off.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco said, standing in the doorway between Jasmine’s office and theirs.
With his coffee still in hand, Draco sent Blaise and Pansy outside to film exterior shots of the house, garden, and neighborhood. Potter had disappeared, and Draco wanted to find him, maybe talk about that morning.
He clapped his hands, and Harry did as he was told.
“My pleasure,” Potter said, and his smile was beautiful, warm enough to melt the snow outside.
Draco waved him off, hoping that his own pale skin didn’t look as ridiculous.
The only thing it wouldn’t give up (besides the portrait of Walburga) was a painting of London Bridge that was stuck to a wall at the top of the third floor landing.
Photo prompt:
“Here’s what we’ll do—” Draco said, taking control of the teeny bag Potter pulled from the front pocket of his jeans. He had zero freaking idea how Potter wedged the bag into that pocket, because his jeans were so tight, he wanted to touch them to see if they were painted on. “We’ll sort them into two piles, first.”
Draco mentally face palmed.
Each time he would eye the shutters as if he might glimpse the person behind them.
There was no getting around it. He needed to man up and call Dylan. Harry wasn’t a coward; it was just that Dylan was going to make a scene, get so angry like he always did when Harry had to change plans.
“Look, it’s whatever.” Dylan dismissed the conversation, leaving Harry feeling guilty and angry. “Just—when will you be home?”
And less Malfoy mouth, for sure.
“Join me.” It wasn’t a question.
Harry dropped onto the sofa and launched into his reasons why the extension charm would be perfect, and Draco refuted each one.
When their laughter died down, Lundberg opened the file, and he and Malfoy began to study the contract. Harry fumed as they excluded him, pointing out details and speaking quietly in financial jargon.
Potter started laughing again which morphed into hiccups, and Draco elbowed him in the gut as a reminder. Draco tried to look threatening or angry or at least maybe stern, but he began to giggle.
“That is the single most ridiculous thing I have ever seen,” Draco said as the sponge sounded like a flute. “And what is this?” He waggled the Muggle device at Potter.
Draco banged his head on the table several times, finally just resting his forehead on the scarred, wooden desk in their office. “Not that bad?” he said into his lap. “—Jasmine and I spent literally all night transfiguring uniforms to look like the ones the team wore. And for what? These—these athletes were so creaky they could barely get one leg over the broom.”
Harry stood and stepped away from the desk as quickly as he could and turned away from Malfoy back to the corner cabinet. “A Niffler statue? Dimplethwait was really weird.”
song.
Harry continued putting his files back in order as if nothing had happened. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “Potter. Tell me what just happened?”
gone native.”
“You don’t like him.” Malfoy’s shoulders slumped as he frowned. “I was hoping you would. It would be so much easier—”
“We could do that, you know,” Harry said, tugging Draco’s arm until his hand pulled out of the pocket. “Go to Harrods. Wander around. Buy stuff we don’t need for our office. Have tea.”
He stands up, and she takes a long look. The light in his eyes that had for too long been dimmed. The smile on his lips. The smooth set of his shoulders, not hiked up in distress. “You look well.”
“He’ll be back in a moment,” Weasel says. “Kingsley wanted to talk, but Harry insisted they had to leave the room so they wouldn’t bother you.”
Dyl scoffed, but didn’t interrupt Harry.
Potter dashed up the steps, two at a time. He wore a
And in some way, it was tied to Potter.
Harry made Draco leave the room first, before he could start again. He heard Draco badmouthing him to Kreacher and all Harry could do was grin. He was filthy and exhausted from digging through Dimplethwait’s garbage and hauling bags to the dumpster—strictly speaking, he didn’t
“Does the room smell like roses?” Draco asked as he slid between the sheets. “It didn’t used to smell like roses.”
“You arse. You better stay awake. You promised me dinner and a movie.” I scrape myself across the floor to get as close to him as I can. It’s just a few centimeters, but it takes years until my forehead almost touches his. My feet are as useless as my hands. They’re beyond numb, and I don’t even care anymore.
Draco tried not to move, but Harry felt his legs shake as if not moving took everything he had. Harry hollowed his cheeks as he backed off Draco’s cock with a slick pop. “S’alright if you move. If it’s too much, I’ll let you know.”
Scorpius’ eyes were the same stormy grey as his father’s, but not quite the same shape. A little rounder, a little closer together.
“Draco! Did you get it? I found the cure! Since we couldn’t leave, I spent the night in the hospital library reading Medieval spell books. Turns out, scabies was a big problem back then—”
Harry pulled the file in front of him, and before he got through the first paragraph, he knew he was in over his head. The words made no sense.
“It’s absolutely a scheme,” Draco nodded wisely to McGonagall. But Harry saw him struggling to hold back a smile.
“She misses you.” Harry took Draco’s hand and held it in his. “She talks about you all the time when I’m there.”
Malfoy stared at it. Closed his eyes and shook his head. When he opened his eyes, he stared at the number again. “We sold that much in concessions?”
since he’d had a blow job, since he’d come from someone else, with someone else.
Malfoy has dinner with Harry.
“No, no. Goodness, no. They’re my
Harry tells Dylan about being quarantined. It doesn't go well.
“I mean, like-like—”
If Tumblr flags it, the pic is of a naked man with his hand strategically placed, and he's draped in multicolor fairy lights. I'm calling them PRIDE lights.
“In the two years we’ve been open, no one has ever asked who the baker is,” Ginny said, wringing her hands. “I’m sorry I froze, Harry. I didn’t know what to say.”
Draco pushed the button to begin recording and sat on the sturdy stool across from the camera. “We did great work today. This is a lovely, old house with great bones and a lot of love to give. I can feel it. And Potter was dead useful, lugging things to the bin without complaint. Hopefully, though, he’ll leave his shirt on tomorrow to make it easier to concentrate.
his mind supplied from medical texts memorized early on.
“Get a room.” Pansy fake-gagged.
“—time honored tradition of playing in extreme conditions—”
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, new owners of the Chudley Cannons, have turned the Quidditch world around. “Quidditch is brilliant, and we want to make it even more fun,” Potter said.
How’d Malfoy know Ginny was waiting? Or—“Wait, which one?”
also, the title of the chapter comes from this
“So we’re 11 again?” Draco teased but Harry didn’t miss that his hand rested lightly on Harry’s back now.
“We need a new head coach, because either he sucks or Dimplethwait tied his hands so tight that he wasn’t allowed to do what he needed to. This team’s defense should be put out of its misery.”
I talk to him like he asked before. I tell them that he’s not
“I’m looking forward to hearing about him—if you would like to tell me.”
“Money. You want us to spend money making one of these for—” Malfoy pulled a folded paper from his back pocket and angrily jabbed his finger at it. “—for Michael Sullivan? The Seeker who caught the Snitch once
Harry looked at Scorpius and winked. To his surprise, Scorpius winked back. “I don’t know, Malfoy. Numbing spells are just for good boys.”
“I’m unable to comment on the suit we brought against the Cannons,” said Nick Cohen, owner of the Caerphily Catapults. “Except to say that the International Quidditch Association ruled in favor of the Cannons and their ridiculous, illegal, mockery of the game.”
“Hate fuck?” Draco’s face drained of any color except the red, high on his cheeks. “There was no hate fucking.”
Dylan was on the floor picking up shards of ceramic plate with his bare fingers.
Doctor Harry examines his two patients, but learns that Draco has told his son all about Harry Potter, the Saviour.
Potter was waiting with a cup of hot, black coffee for Draco. “I told them once more never to do that again,” he whispered.
see I’m just playing devil’s advocate?”
Harry mimicked in his head.
Dylan scraped his breakfast into the sink, bitching under his breath. Harry slid his plate onto the counter and draped himself over Dylan’s back. “I’m sorry,” Harry said quietly, nuzzling behind Dylan’s ear. “I don’t mean to be an idiot. I’m just not that good a Heal--uh, doctor to fix you if you get Covid.”
Draco stepped away, grabbed his wand from his trousers and with a swoop and a few mumbled words, Harry’s joggers and trainers were gone. “Now. I believe you had a plan.”
Sixten smiled again. “Really, no worries. If you want to talk about spills on contracts, Draco should tell you about the time we—”
This was the first time
Jesus. He’s hot. Like, model hot. White blond hair, the whitest I’ve ever seen. Big, shining smile. And really underdressed for ice skating.
“Going on--why do you--nothing’s going on!”
Potter squeaked an
They get inside 12 Grimmauld Place. Thank Merlin no one actually lives here, right?
When Draco turned around, Blaise and Pansy stood in front of the fireplace, red light on the camera telling Draco everything he’d just said had been recorded.
“Look Jason, I’d rather do this in person, but—what? You what? Me? I’m away too much? That’s why you? You know what? Fine. Box up my shit at your flat; on second thought, don’t bother. Just throw it in the bin.” Draco slammed the receiver down.
He and Potter dissolved into laughter again, and Blaise threw up his hands and left.
Mr. Dimplethwait pointed across from his desk; it took Harry several moments to realize that the indoor planter was actually a bench seat, blanketed in even more potted orchids.
when she did that.
The Floo roared to life; Harry scrambled out of his chair as Puck pushed herself from his arms. The  pain from her claws raking across his bare arm would register later—right now, Harry needed to figure out who was accessing his Floo. Only Ron and Hermione were cleared through his wards, and they were on holiday.
Although it was well past lunch, more than half the tables were full. Judging by the packages and bags at their feet, many of the patrons had been Christmas shopping. Muggle holiday songs filtered through the diners’ chatter and the clink clank of utensils on plates. In the center of the tables, delicate vases held sprays of poinsettias and holly.
“Why aren’t the Arrows on the pitch? Why aren’t they warming up?” Draco’s voice rose with a squeak.
Harry released Draco. “Yeah. I’m rich.” It was a slow smile, happy with a sense of peace.
“I’ll judge who grew up and who didn’t,” she said, which made no sense to Draco, but a lot of times, she didn’t.
Harry drew Draco in to his side, pretended to ignore the warmth of his body, and against all of Draco’s “better judgement,” side-along apparated them to the secret site for the reveal of Harry’s next big idea.
“You’d think with all the thousands of years, wizard medicine would have solved scabies by now,” Hermione said, clenching her fist to stop herself from clawing at her arm. “Do we have to do everything ourselves?”
His transfiguration is good, but his skating is shit. I glide away and skate back, and he’s still standing on the snow. “C’mon. Wanna race?”
Draco’s groan was as loud as his stomach rumble had been. But Harry didn’t think he meant it.
“Don’t be stupid,” Blaise laughed. “It’s a house.”
As they walked the few blocks to the cinema, Potter rambled on about the snacks and the plot including that many people now felt the Rudolph story was inherently able-ist.
Ginny scrabbled for her order pad and a pen which were somewhere under a pile of receipts and dirty paper napkins next to the till.
“Well, who does make the rules!” Malfoy squawked, which Harry thought was a show for Scorpius.
“It doesn’t matter.”
He finished warding the Floo and turned to the front door. Before he could begin, Draco heard a timid knock at the front door.
“I know no such thing. That’s ridiculous.” Draco hrumpfed and crossed his arms over his chest; when he swiveled his chair to face Harry, Harry saw the small crinkles at the corner of his eyes.
“The usual, love?” the server asked as Harry seated himself at his usual table in the windowed alcove. He filled the mug with rich, aromatic coffee and studied Harry. “You’re not you today, Harry.”
“Don’t dodge the issue.” Draco returned to Potter’s room, dragging his suitcase through the doorway and dropping it onto the bed.
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy’s energy perked up or if he were imagining it. “Hardly.”
“We’re 3-0 now?” Draco asked, his face bright. “We haven’t been 3-0 since the 19th century!”
“Fuck it,” Harry said as he followed the hallway to his office. “It’s enough that we’re partners.”
Thank you for following this fic. I hope you enjoyed it.
business. And then That Twat had implied,
Despite everything, Harry was okay, too.
Malfoy laughed kindly and said, “That sounds delicious. Maybe next time. Whatever you’ve made for Harry is fine for me.”
Tomorrow was another day. Maybe it wouldn’t suck as much as today had.
“20 million you say? I’ll do it! Yes, of course. I’ll do it.” Mr. Dimplethwait marched over to Harry and grabbed his hand to shake on the deal. “Best wishes, dear boy. Hopefully, the Cannons will be as lucrative for you as it has been for me.”
he thought. He leaned forward and rested his head in his hands; the pain of his elbows digging in to his thighs wasn’t as bad as watching Malfoy drape himself over his boyfriend.
“Oh, nothing, nothing.” Dimplethwait didn’t bother to turn away from his flowers. “Tax write-off, very complicated. The more money the Cannons lose, the better I do financially. Capital gains, et cetera, et cetera.”
“American baseball does this all the time. They bring back old teams. They wear their uniforms. The fans love it. We could do a giveaway—like a bobble head or something.” It was one of the ideas Harry had on his list of things to try. It would be fun, and everyone would love it, and he’d get the Weasleys to come, and—“Oh god, I never told Ron I bought the Cannons.” Harry slapped his forehead, “Christ, I never even told Ginny. We probably should have a team meeting.”
Draco’s excitement waned. If other rooms were available, there was no need for him to stay in Harry’s room.
The Floo’s flames surged emerald green, and Sixten Lundberg emerged, impressive in his bespoke black robes that should have looked drab and instead made him look stately and elegant. And unfairly hot.
“Get closer! Look at that signature! It says Gainsborough! I think it’s a lost Gainsborough. Merlin, what a discovery. Potter, you’re rich.”
Draco pressed against his blazer pocket, felt the outline of his eye glasses. But if he put them on, Blaise would never let him live it down. He’d be relentless with the “Blind from rubbing one out, Malfoy?” jokes.
Ok, so I snicker. I didn’t mean to, but he just looked so stupid.
I’m startled by his voice. He’s alive. Thank you, Merlin. He’s alive.
He’d been wrong.
The waiter placed his warm hand over Harry’s on the table. “If you need someone to talk to—”
“I’m not sleeping in the kitchen, and the house won’t let me into anywhere else. So, suck it up. We’re going to share a bed like mature adults and tomorrow we won’t speak of it.”
“It was probably something important,” Hermione said, her voice unsure. “Harry’s not like that.”
Harry’s words fled—spilled out like the mop water on the floor that was soaking his shoes.
The room was small, but he could work with that. He’d done wonderful things with smaller. But the couches were beyond old, and judging from the rustling he heard,
Harry lifted his head. “Buying the Cannons? Being with you? What?” He yawned loudly and then dropped his head back onto his folded arms on the table.
she always said.
Draco held Harry’s gaze. “You have—dirt—here—” he said, his voice quiet and deep. He cupped Harry’s cheek, brushed his thumb across the hollow. He leaned in closer—
Malfoy’s enthusiasm was contagious, and Harry grinned with him. Some of the old Malfoy was still there: breaking rules, putting Harry down, underestimating him. But Harry liked this new Malfoy.
Just because Malfoy was an old school mate, someone he’d spent 7 years thinking about. Just because his features were softer now, less pointy and more handsome. And fit. Just because his put-downs felt less angry and more like teasing.
At some point, Potter had curled up behind Draco and wrapped his arms around him. Potter had slid a leg over Draco’s until he’d draped himself like a blanket. It was awkward because Potter was naked, but it was comfortable, held firmly in place. It was like Potter was a weighted blanket.
“The cinema. Dinner. Football on the telly.”
Harry didn’t care if what he’d said wasn’t supposed to be funny. To hear Malfoy laugh like that, without holding back, to see the worry lines erased from his face—he’d realized he’d gladly say dumb things to see that again.
“Yeah,” Draco muttered as he stomped off the stoop and strode home. Except for the one light burning on the second floor of the building.
Draco quickly explained everything to his mother. The silent producer who provided the money for the telly show. Renovating Grimmauld Place. How she should come over and see it because she wouldn’t recognize it.
Harry woke slowly, feeling peaceful and happy in a way he hadn’t been since Hogwarts. He stretched and reached to the other side of the bed, wanting to touch Draco again.
“Well, it
“--but it’s not that I won’t get naked for you. It’s that --.” Malfoy’s face flamed as he realized what he’d said. “I mean, I won’t get--I mean, I didn't call you for me. My son is sick.”
Malfoy air-quoted before hauling a pristine copy of the 2000 IQA rules to the center of the desk. “I went through this page by page after your cockamamie suggestion about indoor Quidditch.”
“And Ginevra?” Draco raised his eyebrow, like he didn’t believe Harry had actually contacted her.
Potter’s face turned bright red. “It’s not—that’s not—cream pie?!”
Also. It makes my face blotchy and ugly. And if I am to die, I will at least leave a beautiful corpse.
Draco paused as if what he’d said were self-evident, that Harry would connect the dots. “What does that even mean? You’re a Malfoy? You’re brilliant. You have this great business sense. Most of this was your idea and—” Harry’s frustration welled up, and he shoved his hands into his pockets so he wouldn’t do something stupid like hug Malfoy.
Maybe it was the wind. Probably was. That made sense. It’s not like anyone ever came over.
Harry thought that, if the manual had been thinner, Malfoy probably would have hurled it at him. “It’s not illegal,” he said, sounding more sure than he felt.
Harry waved without looking back, and Draco smiled wanly. He picked up his fork but realized he didn’t feel like eating any more. With a sigh, he gathered his files and headed back to the Spell Damage ward.
The furniture from Tickles’ was magically delivered and put in place on the sanded and varnished original hardwood floors. They hung new paintings on the walls atop fresh paint.
based loosely on this prompt:
Draco slumped in his chair and mumbled what Harry thought might have been
“Fine, but we’re going to the Leaky, and you’re buying lunch,” Harry grumbled, shaking his head. Because he knew that, halfway through lunch, she’d remember an interview that she had to give, and she’d Floo off to Scotland, or Bulgaria, or Norway or some other exotic place.
“I love Quidditch, but I hate to be frozen to the point I can barely draw a breath as I cheer on my team. As a former Seeker, I have played in raging blizzards, torrential downpours, lightning so close it singed my hair. We put our athletes and our attendees in very real danger. It’s time for us to protect our investments and allow my clients to continue using their indoor Quidditch pitch.
“Join me.” It wasn’t a question.
“He speaks!” Malfoy laughed and woke the tiny fluff of fur in his arms. “Sorry about bringing him in here. But when I saw you—” He kissed the poodle’s head.
Maybe Draco was that someone. He’d said Sohrob was musclebound and dull, and he wasn’t wrong. But Merlin, he was handsome. Dark hair, bright smile a little crooked. Nice ass in those tailored trousers. Nice ass. A bloke could have dreams about that ass. Maybe that was enough. Someone who wasn’t as smart as Draco was, who wouldn’t fight all the time, who wouldn’t talk back, wouldn’t leave in the morning.
“Harry—” Draco breathed when they broke apart.
at Blaise.
“Chicken butt!” Scorpius yelled as loud as he could, which wasn’t very loud before he winced in pain.
he thought with embarrassment. With a flick of his wrist, the heavy drapes scooted closed, and Harry could mostly see Malfoy, save for the weird green sun shape in his vision.
I know the
Late in the evening, when Harry had written up every patient chart that he’d been avoiding, when he’d played every match-three game on his phone easily a dozen times, when he’d ordered so many times from Room Service that he was sure the House Elves were shooting him the evil eye, the courier finally dropped the box of Covid tests on the front porch.
“beta tester,” Harry could see other users’ photos and biographies and could match with guys he found interesting.
The cake plate sat on the folder. He’d dropped crumbs on it and in his haste to clean up the sloshed coffee, had pushed the file into the spill. “I’m not usually like this,” Harry explained awkwardly. “The past two days have been—”
“Three. We’ve read three.”
it now, and pumps into his fist until he comes.
if you ask me what Sixten looks like, I'd show you:
“We’ll get it done. What we need is help,” Draco said from behind Harry. He rubbed Harry’s back, and the soft back and forth felt calming, and Harry leaned into the warm pressure.
Without another word, I disapparate as fast as I can, before he changes his mind. I know he’s probably harmless, but I’ve seen too many people pretend they’re kind while hiding a weapon in their jacket.
Potter cracks open his eyelids. “Not dead, you twat. Concentrating. Trying to do wandless magic.”
“Would you want to get coffee or something and I could ask you questions about having a dog?” Harry asked in one breath before he could talk himself out of it.
“Good to know it doesn’t matter to you.”
“I guess I
Potter rescued the spaghetti sauce and tapped the water pot to boil. While they waited, Potter said, “Blaise left us a camera. It’s just for us. We’re supposed to use it—they said for us to pretend it’s another person we’re talking to.” He shrugged, and Draco was glad it made no sense to Potter, either.
As he shut off the camera with a muttered,
They walked out of the changing room, through the stadium to the outside. The public areas of the stadium were just as shabby. It desperately needed paint and repair. “Someone should just tear this shithole down and start over,” Harry said. “I think that would be easier than trying to fix it up.”
No one answered. Potter was doing a great job of avoiding him.
“We were?”
and waved his wand toward the walls.
How could he explain that Draco had made him step outside of his comfort, had been the catalyst for the changes that Beatrice had said he needed to take on.
Potter lifted his head from the papers long enough to glare at Draco. “I didn’t get any sleep last night.”
“He seems like a great kid. Hopefully, when he wakes up he’ll be feeling better.” Harry finished his cookie and water and washed his hands in the kitchen sink. Disinfecting was going to be step two.
“It’s no big deal,” he says, and I know he believes that. That wandless magic for the first time ever, while he’s kidnapped and tied up, is something to apologize for. “I saw it on the table when we came in, with the bowl and syringes. If I can cut the rope, we can get out of here.”
“Fuck you, Granger.“
--use the number two on one cupcake, and the n and the d on separate cupcakes--
Merlin help us, you’ve gone native.”
Professor McGonagall pointed to two chairs opposite her desk. She poured tea for them and sat behind the massive, oak desk. “Tell me your scheme, Mr. Potter,” she said in her clipped Scottish accent.
Draco rolled his eyes again, but the waiter came to take their order.
“Your break-up was extremely public and her subsequent relationship with Zabini is still news. Is this going to become some public relations nightmare? Temper tantrums? Snipes? What can I expect?
When Harry went back down on him, Draco raked his fingers through Harry’s hair, pulled at the curls. That hair—he’d always wanted to touch it, twirl it around his fingers.  Draco felt the coil of orgasm, tightening, growing, until he knew he was too close. He pushed at Harry’s head, but Harry stayed, moved his hand in counterpoint to his mouth.
Because he certainly wasn’t putting any into the Cannons. Harry knew fuck all about reading business ledgers, but he definitely understood the negative signs. The records spanned 1998-2018, and in that time, not once had the Cannons turned a profit. Not a yearly profit, not a monthly profit. Hell, they hadn’t even made money at the home game with Puddlemere, their biggest rival. And that was just in terms of the stadium and upkeep costs.
Malfoy’s cheeks flushed, but he didn’t respond. Instead, he walked to Harry’s desk and perched on the corner. He dropped his head back and sighed; Harry couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think with Draco that close, could only remember the feel of Draco’s skin on his lips, his cock heavy on Harry’s tongue.
There’s only this.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You can do that, too. You have the technology.”
Draco whispered, “You just admitted they’re schemes.”
It seemed good-natured, as did Malfoy’s response. He aimed a plush kneazle directly at Potter’s face and hit the bullseye. Potter laughed as he caught the plush on the rebound off his face.
Draco is an old, old man, ready for bed at 8:30pm--until someone comes knocking on his door.
It was an elegant, intricate dragon.
Harry stared at Draco’s naked body and looked like he was trying hard to keep his hands off Draco.
By dinner time, Pansy complained that her shoulder hurt too much to continue shooting, and that she was leaving, and Blaise could come with her or he could—well, it was un-repeatable. Blaise left with her.
The sheets were cool, except for Puck, who’d stretched out where Draco should have been.
“I’ll check you out too, Malf--Draco, as soon as I’m done with Scorpius.” Harry was surprised when Malfoy nodded in agreement.
“You know, maybe—” Harry said, trying to get his mouth to catch up to the speed of his thoughts. “We could celebrate that team! Have an old-timers’ night. Bring those people back, introduce them to the crowd, let them play for a few minutes—”
Harry eyes were closed, and his lashes fanned dark against his cheeks. Draco wondered how he’d ever thought Harry was a mess because he was the most beautiful person Draco had ever seen.
them to lose money? That’s why the no-trade clauses, the bad salaries, and that shit you call a dressing room?” Harry’s voice rose with each accusation.
“What are you doing?” Draco said on a breath. He slid his arms away from his waist and held them awkwardly as if he were unsure what to do with them. Maybe he wanted to inch Harry closer but wasn’t sure… Harry reached for Draco’s hand, slid his fingers between Draco’s.
Dimplethwait, who’d apparently grown bored of the conversation, had wandered over to the windowsill to resume whispering to his plants, and Harry wasn’t even sure he’d heard the question.
Jasmine nodded as the Patronus dissolved. She held the box of tissues toward Harry. “He prefers people not to perspire when they’re talking to him.” Careful not to disturb her makeup, Jasmine blotted her face with a tissue before asking Harry to follow her.
Harry took the few steps easily and rapped twice on the door. “Doctor,” he called out, knowing from experience that his title made things easier.
Maybe, Draco thought, but he’s afraid that the logic is illogical, and that it’s really because they made a colossal mistake. He had no loo in his room, so he performed rudimentary cleaning spells and hesitated when he got to his chest, like it was the only proof he had of the night before.
“Well, when you say it like that it sounds mad—” Malfoy held Scorpius out to Harry.
“Look,” Hermione began cautiously, as if she already knew he wouldn’t believe her. “I’ve only seen him move like that when he has a work emergency.”
Potter’s face was pale, but his cheek bones were blotchy red, and he sounded furious.
“Stupid git,” Harry grumbled, unable to see anyone with platinum blond hair. The Leaky was packed, people who’d popped in for a quick drink before heading home from the office or meeting friends for dinner and a night out. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been out so late in the day. “That’s just like him, probably swanned off instead of waiting just because I took longer.”
I clear my throat and hope he can’t hear the tears in my voice. “Why’d you become an Auror? You’ve been through so much—Voldemort and being used by Dumbledore. And everyone knew Umbridge abused you. If I were you, I’d have moved away.”
“They did it because you were here. You led by example.”
Ginny scribbled as fast as she could, and Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s tone, which implied that they were going to screw up the order no matter how explicit his directions were.
“D’ya want to come in?” Potter motioned over his shoulder with the wooden spoon that had spaghetti sauce on it, if Draco weren’t mistaken.
bad!” Harry said, sounding offended.
Once I’m sitting up and facing him again, the ache subsides, but sicking up is a real possibility. The room dips and spins, and I beg it to stop. Deep breathing helps, but the air hurts my lungs.
“How are you spending Christmas?” Harry asked as casually as he could one day when Draco was busy crunching numbers or whatever he did when he worked at his desk. Their office was overrun with stacks of rainbow scarves on every flat surface; this would be their best giveaway yet. Pride scarves for their match against The Pride of Portree. Before the match, they were celebrating the LGBTQIAA+ athletes who'd challenged the league and made it safe for everyone to play Quidditch.
This bed was too hard; that pillow was too soft; the wrinkles in the sheets hurt his legs when he pressed against them. Once he entered the Junior Healer program, he learned quickly to sleep wherever and however.
When Kreacher had finally made it out of the room, Harry began apologizing as profusely as he could, but Malfoy was doubled over laughing.
“There’s no
I don’t even know what to say. He was perfect in the letter. Loves the Chudley Cannons and Muggle football and treacle tarts. Was raised by Muggles who treated him like shit.
Harry cut him off. “I bet your mother would.” His excitement was contagious, and Draco nodded enthusiastically.
“But—”
“I have the tests and some food if you think you can eat.”
“It’s part of my investment—” Draco stammered, throwing the end of his Pride scarf over his shoulder.
“Listen, Draco,” she laid her hand on his. “I can help if you want. I can talk to Harry.”
But Harry was asleep. Draco turned down the lights and opened the door to leave. The hallway windows looked out onto the snowy street.
the tiny voice in his mind provided helpfully.
Draco has no idea what to do with Potter in his home. He does know that, if Potter doesn't want him, then he's going to be a great friend and find someone good for Potter.
The house has DEFINITE opinions about DRARRY....
“That’s what he said,” Draco mumbled into something soft. He had trouble pulling himself out of sleep, and the comfortable weight on his head wasn’t helping.
“No, but I think they were ticked off they couldn’t help collect the stuffed animals,” Malfoy added. The officials stopped the match after the Cannons’ first score. All players remained in place while staff members dashed on and off the pitch, their arms filled with stuffed animals.
charm?” Harry asked, leaning against the wall next to Malfoy.
Sixten gathered the documents, duplicated them, and slid the originals back into the folder,  Harry definitely didn’t understand him, because if Malfoy were
“You’re very good with him,” Malfoy said quietly so he wouldn’t wake Scorpius. “He doesn’t open up to a lot of people.”
Potter hiccupped in a last laugh and said, “You know what he wanted? A

had ever assigned a reporter to cover the Cannons.
“Oh, fuck off, Malfoy.” Harry flipped him off and shook his head when Draco cackled again.
A newly-assigned reporter from
“Potter’s lost a lot of—”
“It’s—” Potter continued.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said fondly, storing his glasses and McGonagall’s note on the nightstand before snuggling up behind Draco.
The twisting in Harry’s gut was hunger. It was clearly past his normal dinner time already. Of course, because it wasn’t like he gave a fuck if Malfoy brought all of his boyfriends to his meetings.
It’s hard to wake up.
The rooms went from bad to worse. Loose floorboards that misbehaved, slapping them on their calves. Doors that refused to open. Stairs that randomly disappeared. Dust covered every surface; Draco swore that even the air was covered in dust.
Either Malfoy didn’t hear him or chose not to respond. Harry breathed out in relief. That was something for another time, he guessed.
“Let’s recap, shall we? We’re unarmed in Muggle London, but it wouldn’t matter, would it? Because there’s no place for wands in Muggle clothing.”
“Madam Chairperson and honorable committee members: In 1674, when the British and Irish Quidditch League began, most of us who play would have been poor farmers taking a moment away from our crops, from the worry of feeding our families. We would have flown carefully, well out of the view of Muggles because being burned alive or being drowned was a legitimate fear for witches and wizards.
All Draco knew was that Potter had taken one of the letters and was going to contact the guy’s
Harry struggled to keep his face expressionless, because he did
Ginny swirled the hot cocoa in her mug and then fished out the marshmallow with her spoon. He assumed she was trying to find the right words for whatever she wanted to say. Harry waited, nursing his own cocoa. She’d talk when she was ready, and he knew from experience that rushing her wouldn't do anything. Which was fine, because a group of uni students had just pushed through the front door, laughing and chatting loudly as they shook snowflakes from their bobble hats and scarves.
The Cannons with a winning record for the first time in recorded history? Unbelievable.
TW: talk of past infidelity, discussion of therapy
and he’s down again.
Draco pulled back, slowed them down. “We have all night—”
“I don’t know. You dirtied your jumper, you slept through dinner—I don’t make the rules here,” Harry said, shrugging in a
“Mr. Potter—Harry,” he said, sticking his hand out and making it look elegant and inviting instead of awkwardly knocking something over like Draco would have. “Tyler Thompson.
Draco thought distastefully.
She punches my arm as lightly as she can, but it feels like a fighter’s wallop.
Draco stared blankly over the rim of his cup. “Potter. Use your brain. You’ve been snarling at the Prophet for the last two hours. How could I have read it?”
Harry examines Scorpius and quickly realizes he needs to examine Draco, also.
“My what now?”
Draco entered the red booth and took a deep breath before spelling the phone to work. “Jason? Yeah, I know it’s the middle of the day…yes, I’m okay. No accident…yes, I know how I am, prone to accidents…”
“Hermione, what the hell time is—it’s still dark for Merlin’s sake—Harry?”
Malfoy covered his face with his hands and shook his head.
whatever that meant. “Harry, it’s wonderful to see you. Thank you again for speaking at the trial.”
Harry squirmed on the couch, too cold without the blanket, too hot once he’d wrapped himself in it. It was so stupid to be here, when people had real problems.
“I thought that was bad til I saw the receipt for the bobbleheads. They cost more than we made in ticket sales.
The feelings of dread and despair remained in the study long after it had been scrubbed and redesigned. Something niggled in the back of Draco’s mind, a feeling or a memory from long ago that he couldn’t pluck out.
Draco woke rested and refreshed, ready to start the day. These two nights had been the best sleep since—well, ever.
For a second, he wished he hadn’t agreed to buy the Cannons. That he was back in the safety of his routines, at the café or at Grimmauld Place, where his biggest concern was whether he should stick with his decaf or if he should be adventurous and try one of the flavored coffees (he never did). If Kreacher would serve warm, crusty rolls with the soup or if it would be a pack of Saltines.
“I’m not. I’m just—I mean, earlier today I shouldn’t have—”
“What? Yes, of course.” Malfoy blinked quickly, like he’d forgotten what they’d been talking about. Or maybe he felt intimidated by Harry.
But he was still Malfoy.
He gets to his hands and knees, tries to stand and his feet
“Now!” Malfoy pointed up the stairs. “Clean clothes and modest robes. Let’s.
“Since it’s Friday, and we probably won’t get an owl til Monday—” Harry hesitated and then spoke in a rush. “Maybe we could get something to eat. To celebrate.”
“He left? I can’t believe it.” He couldn’t hold the shards together any longer. He thought maybe, just maybe, he’d meant something to Potter. That he wasn’t just a quick fuck and a ‘Bye, see ya later.’
that he still wanted Ginny.
“Please.” I sniff with as much disdain as I can manage. “My mother would never sleep with you; she has impeccable taste.”
“No, I’m good,” Draco said smiling at Harry. “I’m okay for now.”
.< Dylan said, “That sounds really nice. I’m sorry.  I’m not trying to be an ass, I just—"
To breach the darkness, Draco cast a
Now we're present day.
“I brought an extra pair of skates if you need them,” I say, and almost before I finish my sentence, he’s got his wand out, and I lunge for him. “This is a Muggle skating rink, you idiot. Put your wand away.”
Three years in America, in the south. In Florida, which he found out was kind of the south, but kind of not. It was like Floridians picked and pulled Southern things they liked (sweet tea, and y’all, and grits) and avoided things they didn’t (thick drawling accents, Baptists, and biscuits & gravy) to create a culture all their own.
“Potter. It was my grandmother’s house. I know the address,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes at  Harry. “But, thank you.”
“I was afraid you wouldn’t be back, that the amount of work had scared you off,” Potter said, catching the spaghetti sauce before it dripped off the spoon. “The house won’t let me make any changes.”
that Harry knew from experience would write what it wanted.
“No, no. You can’t do that.” Draco leaned across the table, moving the vase out of the way. “Why did he do that?”
apron and held a wooden spoon that dripped something red.
“Is it my imagination or are more people here tonight? Like, more than just the Hogwarts kids.”
“Plus, it will be nice to see Mother. I think.” Draco frowned for a second. “I haven’t seen her in almost a year. And Christmas Eve is a good day for it, right?”
Harry flipped Draco off before turning to leave.
Dylan pressed a mug of steaming coffee into Harry’s grasp, holding on until he was certain Harry was awake enough to register what it was.
“This is bullshit, Ginny. It’s not right.” Between the cold and the jarring color, Harry’s head ached. And he’d only been in here a few minutes.
Draco tried to stare Harry down.
“I know you are but what am I?” Harry sing-songed until Draco wound a rainbow scarf over Harry’s mouth and Harry tried to kiss him through the scarf.
“Don’t. Just fucking don’t, Potter,” I say, panting from the exertion of trying to break free; no matter what I do, I can’t budge the ropes. We’re going to die alone, frozen like ice lollies—if someone left ice lollies trussed up on the floor of a crack house in February. “Do something or shut the fuck up.” My breath freezes in tiny crystals on my face, and when I scrunch my nose, it stays wrinkled.
Draco rolled his eyes as Potter tapped his foot, waiting. “Oh, do sit down, Potter. We’re in the middle of something, and Granger obviously forgot you had a lunch date.”
Harry’s grin said it all.
ok, so. I know where this is going, but IDK how many chapters it's gonna take. I mean that the fest is long over, so I'm not constrained by photo images, you know?
me. He looks at me like I’m fragile, someone to be protected, and Merlin, if we were somewhere else at some other time, I might even take a step closer to him and hope he’d do the same.
He stepped into the foyer, still inky dark, and sighed.
“—here to talk about our Cannons!”
He reached out for her—tentatively enough that she could pull away—and hugged her tightly. “I’ve missed you.”
“I try,” I say around the knot in my throat. “It’s why I became an Auror.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “It is possible for two men to be mates, Potter. Even if one is gay and the other straight. You could have just asked instead of assuming.”
“Probably want to—” Draco smirked as he waggled his finger at the joggers still at Harry’s ankles.
Harry’s shoulders slumped. “We have so much to do—clean this mess. Make this building fit to work in. Talk to the team. Meet with the staff.” He dropped his head to the desk and felt the acid rise in his stomach. He hadn’t even gone to the coffee shop for breakfast—
Dylan stared in silence. The playfulness of a moment ago was now rigid and cold as snow. "You mean uber wealthy."
“Dude, whatever. I was just gonna transfigure my shoes into skates. You don’t have to, like,  attack me.”
“Don’t answer that, Augustus,” a voice said from the doorway. “Potter, step away.”
I land with a stumble and fall face first onto hard, cold grass. Before I stand, I take a deep breath. I know this place, the honeysuckle aroma of heather and the coconut of Gorse. I jump up. “First, what the fuck? You can’t just kidnap me.”
He threw on clothes that were different from the day’s before but still were paint splattered and stained. “I’m going to make breakfast if you want some.”
The title is from
Draco rattled the paper in Harry’s face. “No! Sales definitely jumped from last week!”
Trying to refind my groove. I used to go to McDonald's every day to write. Now I'm home with 4 online college kids and 1 high school kid also online. Mr. Sun is using our bedroom as his office. So I'm trying to eke out time and space for me. And last night I fell asleep before I could open the computer to write.
“Do you mind? It could be for me!”
“Snuck out.”
“It’s
Draco looked blankly at the two of them.
Of course.
Draco’s anger bubbled over into laughter. He’d laughed more today than he had in all the months with Jason. “Come on. I’ll buy you lunch.”
“My sister just had her first baby.” Thompson pointed in the general direction of the lobby and smiled again.
He slowly turned Harry toward the spray to rinse off as Draco washed his wide back. He teased Harry, dragging the soap along the crease between his arse cheeks but not dipping inside.
Harry stepped back from Dimplethwait and crossed his arms over his chest as he scowled at Malfoy. “You’re the one in charge of this—this—cost cutting?” He tried to drench the word in sarcasm and disgust in addition to anger, but his voice cracked like a teenage boy’s when Malfoy chose that moment to remove his robe and hang it on the coat stand. His Muggle trousers were tight—obscenely tight—
Malfoy and Lundberg stared at Harry.
Merlin help him, he had no idea why he’d agree. He already knew it was going to be bad. Bad with a capital B. And he was going to say yes to whatever she asked because that’s just what he did.
Draco thrust his bare feet into his shoes and disapparated to the empty lobby.
Harry laughed, and from the tone of Molly’s voice, he knew that she wouldn’t consider it a proper Christmas without mince pies and Yorkshire pudding.
Harry waited for the snarky comment, but it didn’t come. Instead, Malfoy’s face looked blank, like he was trying to figure something out.
“Without a Covid test, I can’t be 100% sure. You both could just have a nasty case of the flu. Low grade fever, aches and pain, headache, runny nose. Symptoms of both the flu and Covid. I can’t know.”
I choose desire (for an action), determination (for it to happen), and deliberation (being thoughtful and precise).
Her laugh was so happy, so like when he was young, that Draco couldn’t even be angry with her for her lying and manipulating ways.
“But their magic was so powerful that it leeched into the house in such a short time. Since the only rooms that the house has offered so far are the foyer, the kitchen, and the bedroom—”
Harry tried to wave him off, but Malfoy paid no attention to him. “You did save all of us, but especially Mother and me. You didn’t have to testify on our behalves. You could have taken your hero’s due, gone on a long vacation. Merlin knows you deserved it--”
remember?”
Potter shrugged and lay back against the bed, his face pale. He was breathing heavily, and Draco checked his vitals. They were both too high, dangerously high. He leaned over and murmured quietly to Harry, whispering that it was alright, that Harry was alright now.
“Let’s get rid of the rug and see if that’s it,” Draco said, rolling back the end of the Persian carpet to reveal beautiful hardwood flooring. They quickly rolled it, and even though it was almost room sized, Harry hefted it out back to the construction bin.
“Yeah,” he said out loud in response to no one as he followed Ginny up Diagon Alley toward the Leaky. “That was hell.”
Harry slid the trays of croissants into the oven and set the timer; he moved by muscle memory, his mind still on Ginny’s words. A date might be okay. Not just as a third wheel, watching telly with Ginny and Luna or playing board games with Ron and Hermione. But just him and a bloke who’d want to sit down for a bite to eat and get to know each other.
“Oh ho. Not just shirtless.”
“Oh my God, I’m absolutely going to tell him,” Potter wheezed.
“That’s true. But work, which you really loved when you told me about it last week, is really going to suck, Harry, if you let this lie. But only you can say whether Malfoy is safe to have this conversation with, if he’ll be open to a discussion.”
Potter headed to the kitchen to begin the process of dinner.
“Well, Harry. If you ever want to come to a Catapults’ match, give me a call.” Thompson tapped Harry’s iPhone, and Draco suspected Thompson’s info was now in Harry’s contacts.
Today's prompt:
Draco learned within moments that Harry was incapable of making a decision.
“No. She’s called a psychologist.” This was the first time he’d told anyone, and once he’d said it, he felt the weight of the secret disappear. “Beatrix is a Squib. Mostly she sees Muggles, but occasionally she sees wizards. She knows about the War and the deaths. And me.”
“The owner of the Cannons has to go, and you need to buy them.”
“Thank you and also, what the fuck?” Draco said, holding it at arm’s length.
I kick out my feet again. “Potter. You’re not allowed to die!” Because if he does, I could never tell him how I feel.
“Ok, I guess I deserve that,” Malfoy said, not addressing Harry’s glare. “I just—uh—have this policy about not sleeping over after—you know.”
Harry checked to see if he were joking. “You’ve never had chicken noodle soup?”
your type.”
“Errrr, I owl’d Ron to get help for tomorrow. It’s the Cannons. The Weasleys will be here.”
Harry’s heart raced. Draco pressed against him, and Merlin, Harry wanted this and everything else.
“Wait. Home?” Potter raised the bed’s head. “You said, knowing if you’re coming home—
Harry settled himself between Draco’s legs and lapped his way up Draco’s cock, which twitched each time the tip of Harry’s tongue touched him. Draco worked to keep his hips on the bed, when what he wanted to do was feel the wet and warmth inside Harry’s mouth, to fuck it til he came.
“Can’t the Wizarding lab run it faster?” Malfoy’s voice was sharp, and Harry felt 11 years old again, with Malfoy judging everything he did.
“You absolute knob. Let me go get Granger and the Weasle. They’ve been here for a week.”
spell, Sixten produced a copy for Harry. “Sorry I didn’t think of it,” he said.
“He’s good,” Hermione says, through tears. Her face is red and blotchy, but she’s grinning. “You saved his life.”
“Ha—Harry. Stop. I’m gonna—”
“Yeah, wait! What’s going on?” Harry asked, cutting off Draco.
Draco tried the doorknobs; they were all locked up tight. He raced down to the second floor, followed by Harry. Regulus’ bedroom door was closed and locked, also.
Neither Malfoy nor Potter would comment on the suit. A call to the team’s solicitor, former Quidditch star Sixten Lundberg, received no response.
The waiting room was silent. No ticking clock, no faint voices from behind the thick, closed doors. Only the sound of Malfoy on the bench next to him, breathing out in slow, regulated exhales. Harry watched him out of the corner of his eye; Malfoy had tidied up, used steaming charms on the wrinkles in his clothes and combed his hair. He looked calm, unbothered, but Harry knew enough about anxiety relief techniques, and the way Malfoy was breathing was one of Harry’s favorites when he was stressed.
Harry nudged his hips again, kissed Draco deeper, more intense, grabbed his arse and pulled him closer.
“You never call me that,” Harry said, touching Draco’s lips with his thumb. “Say it again.”
The house even gave up its hold on Walburga’s portrait, which Draco took as a final benediction. One morning she was gone. They never did learn where she went, but Draco suspected it was to another Black family property.
“Hi,” he finally managed, but still didn’t move.
Potter collapsed on the bed next to Draco, kissed his shoulder before snuggling in. “I’ll clean us in a mo. I just have to—”
“Keep filming! It will be perfect for the bloopers episode.”
Jesus Christ, it was Draco Fucking Malfoy.
Malfoy stood and made room for Harry to sit on the bed. “Don’t fuck this up, Potter. And don’t let him down.”
“And even if I agreed, I’m not just going to be some—some—pretty face,” Harry said as Malfoy snorted with laughter. “You know what I mean. I want to be a proper owner. Do proper owner things. I have some great ideas already.”
The Cannons took the pitch for their pre-match warm up, and the crowd cheered when they realized the Cannons wore their Hogwarts House Quidditch robes . Some stretched on the pitch while others, including Ginny and Blaise, were on brooms tossing the Quaffle back and forth.
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes were fine-tuning a new dating device they called WIZRD (We Invented Zany Rapid Dating)—although sometimes George called it SPEL’D (Some People Eventually Love Dating). As a
Draco looked over his shoulder to make sure they couldn’t be overheard. “I’ve spent the last 10 years trying to clean the shit stains off my family name for the fucked up things my father did. Just me being here jeopardizes our chances.”
Also, not beta'd at all. straight from my brain to yours. and I'm so sorry about that. LOL
Although it was a week before Christmas, the air in the house was thick and stuffy. Draco shucked the cashmere sweater after only a few moments of cleaning; Potter stripped off his t-shirt, shoving it into his back pocket for use as a rag. Occasionally, he dragged it down his face, and Draco was fairly certain that it left more dirt behind than it removed.
If this chapter is you too, unite with me and Harry.
“Potter. Are you good? Do you need anything?” Malfoy asked into the pillow, as if he were still the host here.
Harry thought, rolling his eyes.
“Everything okay?” Harry asked, tentatively.
Harry couldn’t think of words. Because Malfoy in his vest and jeans.
a hot co-host. And if something develops between you two, all the better for ratings. You in?”
the work.”
They entered the campus, and Harry felt the magic of the wards ripple around him as they allowed them entrance to the grounds.
“I’m serious. You can go after I do.”
“What do you say?” Harry asked, conspiratorially. “Should we help him out?”
He passed a home with a Christmas tree brightly lit in the front yard, mocking him.
“Here we go,” Draco said to the camera with a forced smile. He focused on the undercurrent of peace and opened the door.
Harry shrugged his shoulders with a smile and changed the subject. “You’re supposed to be asleep.”
In therapy, Beatrix said he needed to take chances, to step outside his comfort zone. Buying the Cannons had worked out okay, right?
They stepped out, one at a time, and Harry toweled Draco until he was dry, then took care of himself.
The chair stood and rapped her gavel once. “At this time, we have no questions. You may expect our decision via owl within the next 7 days, but no later than Saturday noon.” They filed out of the room, arguing softly amongst themselves.
“Compared to last week, is that—”
“That the two of you would hate fuck—”
“Thank you for your time.”
“You’re not being fair,” Harry said, ignoring the fact he’d thought the same thing. “The crowd loved it.”
“—Fuck off, Blaise.” Draco didn’t care whether they edited out that comment or not. “As I was saying, the house has only offered up those 3 rooms, so we’ll start out here with our ritual.”
“I don’t have his schemes. I have well thought out plans,” Harry said, but Draco rolled his eyes.
“What did you just say?” Blaise asked.
What exactly do you have to explain, Potter?” He grinned at his own jibe.
“Well, yes,” Draco said, clueless why Potter stormed over based on his letter. And why he’d kissed Draco. Which, was very nice. “The cinema
“That’s brilliant!” Draco and Harry said in unison. Draco left to make the announcement about refunds and the special event.
“Not today,” Harry said. “Someone has to oversee our investment.” He waved his hand behind him in the general direction of the food and merch stands.
Like the foyer, every useable space was taken up by pots growing orchids. “This isn’t really—livable, is it? This is bonkers,” Harry said, grabbing another tissue. The first one was soaked through.
Harry wiped his wet hands on his apron and gently took the dog into his arms. Scorpius wiggled up to Harry’s shoulder and, probably finding stray icing or flour, licked Harry’s neck.
Kreacher had set their places, placing their food at opposite ends of the long table. “I’m not sure who he’s trying to keep away from the other,” Malfoy said, on the verge of another laugh attack. “Is it okay if—” He grabbed his bowl and plate and stood, waiting.
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
John grabs my arm. “We’re at Hogwarts, the scene of your greatest triumph. Will you walk me through the day you killed He Who Must Not Be Named?”
Since the war, Draco didn’t believe in taking risks. He’d taken too many, way too many in those two years between Voldemort’s return and death. Inside the Manor, away from Voldemort and Greyback’s search for fresh meat. In the Room of Requirement, working on the Vanishing Cabinet. At the trials, praying to every god he knew of to keep him out of Azkaban.
Ginny switched chairs, moving to the one next to him. She wrapped her arm around his shoulders in a half hug. The teasing was gone, replaced by shared pain. “Look, Harry. Not one of those people who died at Hogwarts would want you to live like this, honey. Not one of them would blame you for their death. Not one of
“Nope. You’re not changing the subject,” Ginny said softly. She nudged her chair closer to Harry’s. “You have a Mind Healer?”
“Potter, you’re a mess.”
Malfoy stopped in every few days with no set schedule—a sandwich on a fresh, hot croissant at lunch, a cookie or two before the shop closed for something sweet “before bed.”
Draco rolled his hips, hesitantly at first, then more insistently as he raced toward his orgasm. He stumbled over a warning, pulled at Harry’s hair, but Harry’d known from the beginning he wanted to taste every bit of Draco. He squeezed Draco’s ass harder, pulled Draco so close that he had no choice but to come in Harry’s mouth.
“Are you going to hug Doctor Harry
The blessing for the house comes from
“That’s a foul.” Harry’s skin blazed where Draco touched him. He was so close, and Harry was hypnotized by the pale hair above his lip and the faint aroma of lemon. He wanted to nuzzle his nose against Draco’s hair, to kiss his skin and learn what was lemon scented. He wanted to kiss Draco, kiss and kiss him, to know if his whiskers were as soft as they looked.  “It’s gonna get called. Anyone would tell you that.” When he could speak, his voice was breathy.
“And how many of us have queued to see the popular play,
Yet, here he was.
This is Gabriel Landeskog, who plays for the NHL's Colorado Avalanche as well as Team Sweden.
“I love you,” Dylan said quietly, and Harry’s jaw dropped.
“It’s a plastic statue-thing, of a player,” Harry said between gasps, “the head is big, and—y’know—bobbles.” He waggled his hands in something that was supposed to look like bobbling.
“A really good exhausted. Also, Potter,” Draco added, “Your meat in pushing against me, and it’s wrong.” He raised an eyebrow and looked down.
that echoed through the street like it was a tunnel. “How dare he, when I was going to break up with him?”
“I don’t care what you do or don’t, Potter. We didn’t come to Florida to be stuck in a room with--”
Harry said. “He cooks because he won’t not cook. I gave him clothes, a proper room. I pay him a salary. He still wants to sleep in a corner.”
“And there walls out back really need ivy on them.”
“No one—I mean—uh—just—uh. The baker.”
“You got my fucking bank records?” Harry snapped, slamming the unopened envelope down. “That’s illegal! It’s immoral!”
“Don’t complain about cooking me lunch,” Harry replied, giving up on t-shirt design for the Hogwarts Night. He had a week before that match; it would get done. “You’re the one who said,
“Six days, Draco. It’s in six days. Have you even started shopping?”
Harry tried harder with his smile and nodded his thanks. When the waiter left, Harry searched his pockets for his phone, praying it had some battery left. Beatrix could help him sort this out.
“Knowing him, he probably is,” Draco agreed, but when Harry looked at him in confusion, Draco backpedaled. “I mean, whoever he is, yeah, he’s uh—am I wishful thinking or is this foyer not as dark as it was before?”
Draco vanished each bowl as Harry emptied it, and once the table was clear, he vanished that, also. “Thank Merlin we don’t play again until Friday. I’m exhausted.”
Super loosely based on this prompt:
spell.
Harry threw his arms up in frustration. His heart pounded in frustration and he wanted to throttle Malfoy.
He watched her expression change from concerned to outright angry. She was angry because he didn’t want her pity? That was too rich. "You fucking lost any right to comment on my life when you walked out.”
Ginny takes Harry to meet the quirky owner of the Chudley Cannons, who has a passion--it's just not the Cannons. Luckily, he's hired a financial adviser.
Hermione stared at Draco, and he felt her brain racing, grabbing and discarding information, until she said, “Oh my god, you and Harry were—”
TW: shouty boyfriend
“Be careful, Blaise,” Harry finally said, starry eyed and a bit breathless. “Or one day I’ll think you mean it.”
Potter shifted on his chair and shot Draco looks like he was trying to will him to leave. Finally, he grabbed a patient’s chart—
Malfoy was almost dead on his feet, and Harry reckoned with being sick on top of Portkey Lag, Malfoy would sleep hard, maybe even until tomorrow morning.
Potter snuffled again and shifted until his cock pressed against Draco’s arse, sought out the linen-covered crease and fit itself there.
Everything he was feeling was obvious in the way he looked at Draco; he couldn’t have hidden it even if he’d wanted to. And when Draco looked up from their hands, Harry knew he saw it, because Draco’s eyes were warm and soft, too.
Kreacher shuffled out of the room, barely holding his voice to a mumble. “Almost had a proper Master. Kreacher must continue to try. The house needs a real Black…”
“Stand down, Potter,” Draco Malfoy said. “And don’t ask my client again. If he chooses to set a price for the Cannons, I will contact you.”
“Harry.”
I don’t want to.
Harry cut Draco off. “Our best offer is a buy one-get one free deal, Professor.” Draco squeaked, but Harry ignored him. “And that’s at the student price of 3 Galleons. Of course we’ll provide free tickets to your adult chaperones.”
Like Dimplethwait said. It was business. Nothing personal.
No water running in the loo. No noise from the hallway.
“Yes!“ Draco said defiantly.
based on this picture
“Just get us the fuck out of here.” I deflect. Deflection is good; it’s my oldest friend along with sarcasm. They’ve preserved my secrets for years, including that I love Potter. “Also. Fuck you. I’m not afraid. He’s just—everyone wants to go out with him. Why would he choose me.” It’s not even a question, but a statement of fact.
Blaise grinned, all sparkly-white teeth, looking so pleased with himself for catching Draco off guard. “Your co-host. The unresolved sexual tension will make the ratings go through the roof.”  Blaise chortled.
