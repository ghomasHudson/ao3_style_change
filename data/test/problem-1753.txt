Draco crushed his lips to his, a small, needy whimper emitting from him when Harry pulled his Omega against him completely.
Draco was limp, both of his legs still bent and spread. Some of Harry’s cum had unfortunately seeped from his opening, mixing with the pooled slick beneath his hips. His long ear wasn’t bleeding anymore, the wound sealed off due to Harry’s saliva.
No magical pregnancies meant no witches or wizards. If there were no more witches or wizards, that meant no more magic. It meant the extinction of their kind.
Draco flushed and gave him a shy smile back. “It’s all right, Mr. Potter. Please don’t think you have to accommodate because of us. We’re already putting you out as it is.”
Harry chuckled, low and throaty. “You can lie to yourself all you want, pet. It won’t change the fact that you spread your legs for me for days, only sated when I was sheathed to the hilt in that stretched, wet little opening of yours.”
Draco reared his hand back and slapped Harry across the face. It sounded deafening in the bathroom, accompanying a niggling ringing sound in Draco’s ears even though he wasn’t the one who had been slapped.
He had never had anything like their bond, and he was fine with waiting until they were both ready again.
Harry’s eyes hardened, his hands clenching into fists atop his spread thighs. “Afraid not, Malfoy. You see, no one likes sticking around long enough for me to get them pregnant. A scarred freak isn’t high on the list for even the most mundane looking omega seeking a mate.”
Harry let his hand glide across the air above the plate of food, steam immediately wafting up when he pulled his hand back.
her at St Mungo’s. She had only left his side because of Ron’s urgent message to come back home. He had seemed so small and defenseless in his hospital bed and she had already failed him as a friend by not noticing his silent cries for help over the past few months.
Pansy’s eyes softened and nodded. “I know, Draco, but without an Alpha’s magic and pheromones, your baby won’t grow like they’re supposed to.”
Harry made his way back to his office, entering it and closing the door behind him. He sat behind his desk, pulling a case file from the stack of unreviewed files on his desk. He got out a pen from his drawer, intending to start taking notes.
“You had a busy day. Did you enjoy your visit with Hermione, pet?” Harry asked, his deft hands lulling Draco into dazed state of contentment.
Draco shook his head, his eyes brimming with unshed tears. “I don’t want to be a bother. I just worry with Scorpius being so young. I shouldn’t have come here…”
”Okay, darling, but please hurry. They’ll be here soon and I’m sure they’ll have a plethora of questions.”
He felt unbearably hot, unable to tear his his eyes away from Harry wanking himself, a cruel smile on his full lips.
“Why are you doing security detail anyway?” Draco spat, digging his nails into the sleeves of Harry’s coat. “Shouldn’t the Chosen One be off galivanting across the globe, spreading tales of your
As Scorpius suckled, Draco watched his mother dither about the kitchen, humming softly to herself and cleaning up their lunch.
The Pensieve was shoved in the far corner of the room, a large cabinet of confiscated memories bottled within.
”I don’t belong to anyone!” Draco glanced around and grabbed a candle holder from the windowsill. “L-let me go!”
But what if they missed something? What if Draco and his pup were caught unaware one night, all alone in that large mansion? Without his Alpha there to protect him, Draco would be a sitting duck, a vulnerable Omega, still lactating for his young pup.
Harry smirked and leaned down, pressing his lips to Draco’s forehead. He pulled back and met Draco’s eyes.
“I don’t need to understand anything about you anymore, Draco. You’ve made it clear that you don’t want me as your mate and that you
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, Harry’s touch sending electric tingles over his breast. His prick was already hard, the tip pressing against the rough fabric of Harry’s trousers. “I-It’s just colostrum, Arlen said it’s perfectly normal—”
His offer to house Draco and his son was purely professional, that was all. He couldn't send the boy home alone, no. That would weigh heavily on his conscious if he couldn't see them and know they were safe.
He supposed a normal, healthy relationship between an Alpha and Omega as a couple would react entirely different to the news.
“I don’t want to kiss you! You’re a horrible person and I want to save…” Draco trailed off, not meaning to share that much.
Without his suppressants or potions, Draco would be nothing more than a whimpering whore, spreading his legs to invite any hard, thick cock in the vicinity to fuck the hurt out of him.
Harry smirked and stood, his prick still painfully hard because of the cloying scent of Draco’s slick on his fingers and the floor.
Draco shook his head, eking out a small smile. “No, but I think my baby is running out of room in there. At night, it feels as if there’s a parade inside of my stomach.”
His cum shot up and splattered against Harry’s stomach and chest, the pearly cum catching in Harry’s sparse chest hair.
He didn’t know how much time had passed, but a rather somber looking house-elf named Kreacher would appear every so often and help Draco relieve himself and try to get him to eat.
Draco winced, rubbing his hand over his stomach when he felt his pup nudge from within. “Theo was always the one who set them,” he said softly. “I was never very good at it.”
Draco meandered out of the manor’s sitting room and through the solarium to exit the sliding glass doors that led to the garden. He had Scorpius sitting on his hip, noticing the pup’s eyes were growing heavy.
Draco shook his head and tried to scoot further away, but Harry grabbed his ankle and dragged him underneath of him.
Even though Draco’s prick was stiff beneath his trousers, his heart felt as if it had been lanced by Harry’s mocking words.
“Because of our ability to use magic, we’re able to see things a little more clearly. Muggles have to wait till at least six weeks gestation to see their little ones, but we’re able to see sooner. We can even determine the sex earlier. Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s see if anything is there first, shall we?”
to us right now. With your…emotional connections to Draco’s family, I’m not sure it would be wise to release the boy into your care.”
Harry lowered his head and scented him, nuzzling against the creature’s long ears to calm him. “Shh, now, little one. No one is going to hurt you.”
Harry realized that this whole trust gaining process was going to be more difficult than he had initially thought.
Harry ripped off Draco’s pyjama bottoms, tossing them to the side. He also pulled off his own underwear, carelessly tossing them to the side too.
Harry cleared his throat and sat up straighter as he readjusted Scorpius on his chest, confidence seeming to come off him in waves.
But instead, he averted the man’s eyes and inwardly chastised himself for thinking such inane thoughts.
Draco closed his eyes, trying to get his thoughts under control. He refused to interfere with Harry’s life any more than he already had. He didn’t need some teenage
“You have to hurry, or he’ll be cross that I didn’t bring you quick enough,” she breathed, grabbing his forearm and tugging him towards the door.
“Auror Thorne, could you leave us alone for a couple of minutes? The questions I must ask are questions that Minister Shacklebolt would like to remain unheard by others not currently cooperating in the investigation.”
As an Alpha, he’d considered dating an Omega, but had always been afraid of accidentally getting one pregnant.
Draco looked up at him through wet lashes, his gray eyes shining, and pink lips stretched over his cock. His breasts were now pinkened from Harry’s kneading and sucking, milk droplets still clinging to his irritated nipples.
Theo still had Potter’s horse, the reins clenched tightly in his white-knuckled hands. Pansy’s mobcap was askew on her head, tendrils of her dark hair sticking to her cheeks and lips. Her dark eyes skated over Draco’s torn shirt and hay-covered trousers.
Potter turned to glare at Theo. “I pay you to tend to my horses, not to fraternize with my servants. Don’t let me see you conversing with him again, or I’ll stop the payments to your mother and siblings.”
Without any further preamble, Harry lowered his hips and aimed, slamming his cock into Draco’s wet hole.
He knew he had to get a grip on his self-control, but with each passing day, it seemed as if his grip only loosened.
Draco could feel the influx of Harry’s emotions through their newly formed bond as if they were his own.
He had never been treated as thus and had no one had ever seen him so exposed. He let his head drop to the hay in defeat, cursing his position and the man who held him close.
Even though his father was a successful businessman, he had already squandered away most their fortune away on gambling and other illicit dealings. His mother always made excuses for his father, but Draco knew the truth.
Harry always made sure Draco came first, even transferring his magic to their pup after each orgasm.
Draco nodded, kissing around Harry’s fingers now. “Yeah. Especially d-during my heat. They burn if I don’t rub them...” he murmured between kisses.
“Just wanted your friends to like me,” he murmured, scrunching his brows together when he felt his stomach briefly roil.
He remembered the taste of the boy’s blood, sweet and heady. His reddened hole beckoned him, unable to stop himself from wrapping his hands around the boy’s upper thighs.
Harry stood and slowly walked around the table, stopping directly in front of Draco. His pheromones permeated the air, thick and dominating.
Ever since they had returned from Diagon Alley that day, Draco had sequestered himself in their bedroom.
He cried out, his prick hardening again between them, the painful bite of Harry’s teeth laced with burning pleasure.
doesn’t even begin to cover what I’m currently feeling, Draco. If I had to pick one thing that I am feeling above all else at this current moment, it would be
Draco somehow instinctively knew what Harry was actually asking, the fucked up bond that had been forced upon him making the sinuous words whisper across his mind.
He’d decided to retire five years ago, choosing instead to finally pursue his dreams of becoming an author.
Draco inhaled deeply through his nostrils, trying to be patient with his eight-year-old whose budding magic was on the cusp of adolescence.
Scorpius would occasionally ask about his ‘werewolf’ and each time it would send a pang to Draco’s heart.
Before he could scamper further back, Harry plucked him up with one hand by the scruff of his neck. He pulled out the tiny struggling creature, holding him to his chest with both of his arms.
”I won’t torture us any longer, pet,” he promised, rearranging the boy so that he was on his hands and knees before him.
The darkened room was lit by the dim glow of the strung Christmas lights hanging on the front of the inn. Some of the reddish light spilled into the room through the frosted window and semi-parted drapes, casting a reddish swathe of light across Harry’s handsome features.
But he wasn’t a young, scared teenager anymore. He was now a man, but still haunted by memories that refused to be forgotten.
Had she missed something? Had Draco ever behaved strangely around her when she was at Grimmauld Place? Had she been that
With obvious trepidation, the rabbit slowly hopped back to Harry’s side, obediently rolling to his back.
Harry carefully pulled out of him, staring down at Draco with an unreadable expression. It was like he was trying to tell him something with his eyes again, attempting to convey something through their bond.
After he had cleaned the bowl of oatmeal, he eyed Harry from under his lashes across the table. The food settling in his stomach seemed to give him a jolt of courage. “So, what do you do when you’re not forcing people to have sex with you?”
Arlen conjured a gel-like substance from the tip of his wand, slowly coating Draco’s stomach in the viscous fluid as he let his wand hover back and forth over his stomach.
When he had explained why he was weaning his pup, Harry had felt a surge of anger towards Lucius for even suggesting he quit breastfeeding Scorpius.
Harry wasn’t looking at him, but at his stomach. His jaw was clenched tightly beneath his skin. He was watching Arlen’s wand with an intense look in his green eyes. Almost as if…
His tanned skin was unmarked, a hint of stubble gracing his lean cheek. Long dark lashes framed his eyes, the green even more vibrant than what Draco could remember from their school days. His hair hadn’t been affected, still dark and full, falling over his forehead in careless array.
”Don’t worry, pet. I won’t fuck you yet, but I will show you just how responsive you can be to my touch.”
The people at the inn had barely spared Draco a second glance when they’d rented a room for the night, all of their eyes drawn to Harry.
Harry lifted a hand and pressed the tip of his claw into the boy’s soft cheek. His sweetheart reluctantly turned his eyes, gazing up at him from under his long lashes.
. His aunt had forbidden him from traveling further than the perimeters of their property and she had always been the one to go into the nearby town to get supplies. His life before captivity had been peaceful but had been also blissfully ignorant.
Draco’s breath hitched and Harry barely had time to react before he felt the boy’s graceful hands on either side of his face, yanking him down.
Slick was pouring from his hole, coating them both in the hot, wet fluid. A flush of heat spread from his chest and down, making the flames within him ignite with even more vehemence than before.
And for the first time in eight months, he let loose a scream that he felt he’d been holding in since his capture.
Harry slid his hands upwards, just beneath his aching breasts. He raised his thumbs, pressing them down into the tender flesh beneath his swollen nipples.
Harry groaned and crossed his arms over his chest. “Of course I was bloody following you. It’s my job. You’ve been doing everything in your power to avoid me this week!”
Draco pursed his lips as Blaise pressed his hat back down onto his head, noticing how his fingers lingered against his skin for longer than necessary.
At the behest of Hermione, he’d agreed on taking out a newly divorced Ginny Weasley. She was Ron’s younger sister, and they knew each other from Hogwarts.
. I will be the father of any children you carry, so dispose of any nonsensical dreams you harbor in your heart.”
“So pink and eager,” Harry cooed, shallowly pumping the tips of his fingers in and out at an agonizingly slow pace that had Draco softly mewling. “So wet for me.”
The man stood, towering over Draco and making him feel smaller than he already did under his intense gaze.
Harry stared down at him, his gaze speculative. His dark hair was mussed and Draco wondered if he had Apparated to the restaurant.
His thoughts unconsciously drifted to the hazy, hated memory of Harry fucking him during his heat, speeding up his fingers to match the pace of Harry’s remembered thrusts into his limp body…
“I didn’t mean to scare you, jellybean. Mummy was just anxious,” he whispered, his words drowned out by the sound of the running water.
He dragged the struggling boy facedown back to the makeshift nest, his thoughts solely focused on breeding.
The slowly swirling milk melding into his tea. The way his shirt collar brushed against his nape. Even the dust motes floating through the air in front of the window in Hermione’s home, illuminated by the waning sunshine bleeding through the gap in the drapes and spilling across the hardwood floor.
Draco glared down at him. Harry was staring at Scorpius, a furrow between his dark brows. It looked as if he was trying to work something out in his head.
With a deep groan, Harry buried himself inside of Draco, shooting his cum deep. He pulled away from his throat and took Draco’s mouth in a rough kiss, the tang of his own blood flavoring it and making Draco whimper.
Hermione stepped forward, hiking her bag up higher on her shoulder. “Harry? Did you find him? We’ve been trying to contact him all day! Kreacher alerted me to Draco’s premature labor and told us he didn’t know where Harry had gone.”
“I’m glad, but your werewolf needs more kisses,” Harry mock growled, pressing playful kisses all over Scorpius’ cheeks and nose.
give myself to someone like you. You can hurt me, berate me, and rape me as many times as you want. It won’t change my perception of you.”
”That’s an even bigger concern, Draco! Why would someone take the time to deconstruct our wards and break in, then not take
Narcissa rolled her eyes before shooting him a patient look. “You’re positively smitten, Lucius. Everything Scorpius does, you call it gifted. He toddled into your office last month and floated your quill down and you wouldn’t cease talking about it for three weeks.”
Harry pulled back, arching a brow at his Omega’s sudden need. “We can’t, Draco. Someone might come in if we made love here.”
Draco sat back down in front of the kitchen island, unbuttoning the front of his shirt to let Scorpius latch onto his nipple.
“I didn’t want it to come to this!” she shouted, glaring up at him with hatred now swirling in her eyes. “I wanted to take Draco and get
He stepped forward and swept the boy up into his arms, holding him bridal style. When his sweetheart’s breath hitched, he knew his hole was hurting him.
understand. Why…he did what he did and what compelled him to do it, but above all else, I would understand if you ignored my letter and never came to visit. However, you’re here and I can’t help but wonder…why?”
Scorpius’ nursery had been designed by his mother, her refined taste obvious in every piece of posh furniture in the room. She had chosen to decorate in shades of light gray and black. They had just transitioned Scorpius’ crib into a toddler bed, but most nights his pup still slept with him since he still breastfed.
Once he had emptied himself completely inside of Draco, Harry gently pulled out of him, his cum and Draco’s excess slick gushing out and soaking the sheets beneath his hips.
When he willed it to slowly dissipate, he pathetically tucked his head against his arm, lulling himself to sleep using Harry’s scent again.
The picture he had ripped from the Prophet after his arrest laid at the bottom of the drawer in his nightstand. He would look at it sometimes, but only when he knew his daughter was asleep.
Harry was dressed in black slacks and a dark green button-down that complimented his olive skin. His dark hair looked unkempt, as if he’d been running his fingers through it repeatedly.
As Potter lit the cigarette, nothing but the sound of the rain softly pelting the roof of the stables and Draco’s own labored breathing filled the inside of the stall.
He stormed from his office, making a direct path for the Floo Network with only one destination in mind.
The situation must be more dire than the Ministry was willing to let on if they were enacting such draconian methods to increase the chances of magical conception.
Harry pulled back, a cruel smile on his now wet lips. “Listen to yourself. Begging for that prick. Do you want him, Draco? Could he even make you as wet as I can? Would you spread your legs like a whore—”
McGonagall let out a sharp bark of laughter. “You don’t have to strain yourself, Draco. I’m well aware of how the manor appears. You’ll get used to it, in time.”
He looked like he was on his way to work, a messenger bag slung haphazardly over his shoulder. He hadn’t changed much in the intervening years. His brown eyes were still warm, albeit his hair was now shorter, like his own.
After overhearing gossip from the servants during his meals in kitchen, Draco had learned that Master Potter had no family to speak of.
. The sounds Draco had made that night would probably haunt Harry for the rest of his life. He’d been so—
Draco would wake up in the middle of the night and find himself curled around Harry. He would feel instant revulsion, immediately recoiling from the cruel man.
Harry slowed, bending down to nuzzle at one of Draco’s nipples with his lips. “Missed your tits so much, baby. Missed
for those small, fleeting moments. He wanted his Alpha back, but he was afraid he had ruined whatever connection they had before he had revealed the truth to Harry.
“I am excited. I can’t wait to see…my baby,” he said softly, a warm feeling unfurling inside of him at the thought of his jellybean in his arms.
Draco smiled wistfully. “I wish I could have gotten to experience going to Hogwarts. My mother was sort of protective.”
Harry glanced down in bemusement when Scorpius begin chewing on his fingers, lightly bouncing him on his knee as he did so.
The skittish rabbit pressed his tiny body farther back against the cage, his long ears pressed flat against his head.
“He’s fine, Narcissa. Actually, he’s better than fine.” Harry paused to watch Narcissa’s eyes become alight with relief, relishing in her false hope before he spoke again. “He’s pregnant, Narcissa. Eight months along.”
Harry was his mate and the father of his pup and his body knew that. It eagerly welcomed his touch and his jellybean continued to grow stronger because of his transference of magic. His heart, however, was an entirely different story.
The past few months had been torturous for him. He couldn’t even use the excuse of the investigation anymore. His Aurors had been pulled from watch duty at Malfoy Manor nearly two months ago by order from the Minister himself. The investigation was ongoing, but it seemed that the Malfoys were in no immediate danger.
“We should go to the kitchen. I need to get things ready,” he said gruffly, not looking at Draco anymore.
His mother had let him know as much. His mother had also told him that Omegas were rare, a gift to be treasured by the wizarding community. She had told him that many would vie for his affections, but only a worthy Alpha would be able to persuade him to mate for life.
“I’m not a horse!” he cried out, struggling against Potter and flinching when he heard the material of his shirt tear down the front.
Sometimes she brought her cute daughter, Rose. Draco loved when they came to visit, because it was the only times he actually felt
He paused, the phial in his fingers, ready to let it spill over into the black marble basin below. The shallow basin swirled with wispy vestiges of memories long forgotten, beckoning him.
His face wasn’t visible from where Draco laid on the bed, swathed in shadows in the darkened room. His long legs were spread in front of him, his palms laid flat atop his thighs.
Jack stared at him for a moment, crossing his arms over his chest. “The kid with the baby whose home we had been surveilling. He stopped by today. Gave me something to give to you.”
Draco bit his lower lip between his teeth and Harry was unable to stop himself looking down at the boy’s lap, noticing his small prick hard against the front of his trousers. “I-I want you, Harry.”
“I wondered if you could get a letter to my mother in Azkaban. I just want her to know that I’m not angry with her and that I love her.”
Harry bounced Draco on his cock, groaning each time he would bottom out. He gripped Draco’s hips, supporting him.
Draco pressed a soft kiss on his pup’s forehead and straightened. He turned, noticing that Harry was staring at the slowly deflating balloons floating the corner of Scorpius’ bedroom.
His rabbit startled and let out a small gasp, whipping around to face him. His face was flushed, a slight tremble to his snow-white ears.
Draco snatched his hand away from Arlen’s as if it were on fire. “H-Harry,” he stammered in surprise.
, Draco. I can’t take it sometimes,” his voice dropped lower, rougher, “let’s go back upstairs, sweetheart. I’ll suck your beautiful tits until you come, I’ll take out my cock and give you what we both
Harry’s gaze hardened before he ripped Draco’s arm away from his chest and held his wrist to the side, baring him.
Draco drew his brows together, noticing that Harry’s words sounded slightly slurred. “Are you…are you drunk?”
Harry scooted closer to him on the sofa, his knee brushing against the boy’s once more, but it hadn’t been on accident that time.
Draco abruptly pulled away from Harry’s cock, supporting his stomach with his arm. “Stop it, Harry. I-I can’t take anymore of this.
Sleeping with his dada at night made him feel safe. He hadn’t felt safe in a long time. His dada kept the bad dreams away.
Harry smirked, bemused at the pup’s cute reaction. “Do you think I’m going to take Mummy away, Scorpius?”
Even after his pup was born, he would need his alpha. An alpha was supposed to tend to their omega after giving birth, supplying their magic, pheromones, and...
He hadn’t wanted to lie to Harry all this time, but after that fated night at Hogwarts, everything had happened so
Harry arched one dark brow. “I don’t think you have a grasp on certain words you carelessly throw about.
“Ah, ah,” Harry admonished playfully. “Only werewolves are allowed to use the kitchen utensils, baby.”
Pansy let out a strangled sigh. “Draco, I understand your reluctance, really I do, but you need to do this. If you don’t, your baby will suffer.”
Harry lowered his upper half until his chest was pressed against Draco’s back, their sweat slicked skin sealing them together.
Harry swallowed thickly, remembering the taste of Draco’s sweet breast milk from the night before. “I’m glad,” he said hoarsely.
He regretted his decision to push Harry away and Harry had done nothing but be understanding to Draco’s fear and indecision.
. You were one of our top Aurors at one time, and we would be happy to gift you the boy as a show of good faith.”
Harry smirked, but it disappeared when his eyes dropped to Draco’s hand cupping his swollen stomach.
Draco hooked his feet around Harry’s waist, digging his heels in. His prick was already hard again, the leaking head rubbing against Harry’s hard abdomen, smearing pre-cum against Harry’s tanned skin as he roughly fucked him.
His father had ingrained him from a young age that to rely on others was to be weak. His own fears, anxieties, and self-doubt had always held him back from what he wanted most. Deep down, he knew what he had to do.
(I’m sorry, but I’m in love with the Harry I’ve written in this story. He’s so...ARF ARF BARK BARK. 😏)
Draco moaned softly, the painful stretch and artificial feel of the dildo unpleasant against his sensitive hole. Each ribbed edge caught against his sensitive walls as it sunk deeper, splitting him open.
Harry slowly turned his head, undiluted malice swimming in the green depths of his eyes. He went absolutely still, his mouth a harsh line. His mussed dark hair was slightly damp now, his stubbled jaw clenched.
Draco was distracted, so when he felt a blunt nail scrape against the heel of his hand, he let out a startled gasp at the pinch of pain that followed.
Harry sat in one of the darkened guest bedrooms of his house. He had his elbows resting on the arms of the wingback chair, his fingers steepled beneath his chin.
The first being that he was a bloody fool. He was a fool to think that Draco could love him back. The boy had done nothing but run away every time he thought they were making progress. It seemed the only thing Draco desired from him was his cock. The only use Draco had for Harry, was what he could do sexually for him.
Harry sat down in the chair next to him, pushing Draco’s plate closer to him so that Scorpius could reach his eggs. He even drizzled the syrup over their pancakes for them.
Harry was quiet for a few tense moments before tugging Draco towards the sofa. He sat down, pulling Draco on top of his lap, facing away from him. He placed his large hands on both sides of Draco’s stomach beneath his jumper, gently kneading.
She waved her hand in the air noncommittally. “All right, darling. I didn’t mean to sound pushy. If you ask me, I think you both need a nap. You look completely knackered, Draco.”
Over the past few months, Harry had proved his love to them. He was committed to being a mate and a father for them, and Harry deserved the same love and respect.
Though they shared their bodies, they never shared their minds. Harry was always cryptic and cold, not wanting to divulge more than necessary about his past.
"She's been hiding him," Harry said softly, the malicious thread of anticipation unfurling with sinister quickness inside of him. It wrapped around his heart, deliciously tightening and giving Harry a feeling of delirious happiness.
Draco looked down at his daughter, wrapping his free arm around her shoulders. Her innocent question reminded him of a conversation he had with her father, all those years ago.
Harry winced, disgust and shock washing over him at the apology that echoed throughout his mind. He pushed aside his inexplicable thoughts, turning his attention back to his needy Omega.
“Maybe,” Draco murmured. “I’ll try nursing him before his nap. Maybe that will settle him down some.”
Enchanted wall sconces lit their way down the cavernous corridor, the sound of incoherent babbling and ominous groans filtering through the thick cell doors they passed.
Draco snorted delicately, taking a bite of bacon and chewing angrily before swallowing. “That would make more sense, yeah,” he mumbled before taking a bite of toast.
Harry cut him off with a slow kiss, his tongue meeting his. They lazily kissed, Harry playfully nipping at his lower lip before he pulled back.
“Are you quite done, Blaise?” he asked dryly, smirking up at him. He attempted to snatch the hat back from his hand where he dangled it teasingly.
Harry’s callous words make Draco’s post-orgasm bliss shrivel and wilt, his heart clenching at his Alpha’s deliberate cruelty.
Jealousy scalded him, hot and piercing. A feeling Harry was completely unfamiliar with. He couldn’t let this happen; he
Hermione eyed him curiously. “You’ve always been good with children. Patient, I mean. That’s usually a skill acquired
Draco’s eyes popped open, his arousal quickly dissipating due to Potter’s insulting words. The unknown desire that had been building like a forge within him burned away to ashes, shame and anger quickly replacing it.
He shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers, not trusting himself enough to not run over to them and gather them both into his arms, unwilling to let them go.
“Yes, but you’re only four months along. This is a vital time for the development of your baby, and you shouldn’t push yourself. I still think you should take some time off from the hospital. Just until things are more…in order.”
”Oh, sweetheart, I’m sorry I’ve hurt you. Come on, let’s take a bath together and I’ll make it better, baby.”
He wondered what atrocities or abuse the small creature had been subjected to to under Octavius’ callous care.
When Draco came back out after putting his daughter to bed, he was surprised to find his kitchen clean and the mess from dinner gone.
remember, Draco?” Harry’s long fingers curled around his ribs, dangerously close to one of his nipples.
The house-elf, Kreacher, had given him a thin pair of white pyjama bottoms to wear, but nothing else. After Kreacher would escort him to the loo and try to coax him to eat, he would use his magic to tie him to the bed again.
Harry swiped his thumb across his swollen nipple, hungrily watching as a dribble of semi-opaque liquid beaded on the rosy tip.
Walking was currently helping, so he kept pacing, his thoughts shifting to the letter he had given Hermione.
It was embarrassing to Draco. He didn’t want to rely on some strange alpha for such an intimate thing. He had only been with one man his entire life and couldn’t imagine letting some stranger put their hands on him.
Harry grasped Draco’s upper arms with both hands, tugging him closer. “You know why, sweetheart,” he said softly.
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Potter! I haven’t let him nurse yet today. I was in such a rush to leave the manor this morning and didn’t have time and I’m still trying wean, but I should have let him nurse before we left…”
Harry closed the distance between them in two steps. “It would. Are you worried of what your father will think?”
As if conjured by his thoughts, Harry stepped up next to him, placing a large hand on his shoulder. “Go ahead, Draco. Sit down.”
When Draco had found Harry’s office, he had been surprised it hadn’t been locked to him. It looked as if the room had once been bedroom but had been converted. Floor to ceiling black mahogany bookshelves lined all of the walls, some of the books Draco even recognized.
Hermione giggled and nodded, some of her curls falling from behind her ears. “Believe it or not, there was a time when
Harry reached over Draco’s head and grabbed the top of the headboard with both hands, using the leverage to begin delivering punishing thrusts, the bed banging against the wall as he pounded into him.
Their Alpha mate would have to be around them all times, their pheromones the only thing able to soothe the pregnant Omega and the baby in their womb.
a Death Eater, ‘Mione. Just because she fucked off after the War to play Mummy for sixteen years, doesn’t make her a saint all of the sudden.”
A fresh gush of breast milk exploded across Harry’s tongue, making him moan. He began sucking, drawing out even more of the sweet liquid with strong pulls from his mouth. He dazedly realized that Draco was undulating atop his lap, drenching his thigh with warm slick from his hole.
Draco quickly began cutting up Scorpius’ pancakes, averting Harry’s gaze. “S-sorry, Harry, it just slipped out. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable—”
He climbed over Draco on the bed, placing both his hands on either side of his head, bracketing him. Harry’s heavy erection bobbed between his legs, sliding against Draco’s inner thigh and smearing his pre-cum along his skin.
It was almost too much, the sight of his Omega wet and tight around him, begging to be fucked. Harry let out a low growl and gave a brutal thrust, the small sofa jarring with the harsh movement.
Harry took a napkin from the table and gently wiped some of thrown food from Draco’s cheek, making his chest bloom with warmth at the affectionate gesture.
Harry readied himself, drawing upon his hatred to steel himself for whatever tactics clever Narcissa would undoubtedly use to trick him.
The words that had shamelessly poured from his lips in the memory seemed to blare, forbidden and excruciatingly erotic:
. Threatening the boy’s mother seemed to be the only thing that got through to him, so he would do what he must.
Harry’s hands traveled down to Draco’s hips, rucking up his jumper and digging his thumbs into his hip bones. Draco eagerly pressed his chest to his, slick starting to leak from his hole due to his Alpha’s attention.
After licking and sucking at the boy’s hole for a while, he bit off one of his claws and sank his finger into Draco’s loosened hole.
When they had made love, Draco had been so open, so needful, and so honest. Where had it gone wrong?
Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s ear, his prickly stubble grazing the sensitive skin. “I wouldn’t mind if you called me it, too, sweetheart.”
The fact that Draco refused to take anything to alleviate his heat pains because of his worry over his milk being effected...
“You can come by to see her whenever you want to have a break from the manor,” Theo said. “If you like.”
He didn’t have to say anything. His claim was blatant in his possessive gaze, his heavy hand pressing down as their pup continued to excitedly shuffle around inside of him.
If Roland couldn’t even handle him talking about his daughter’s cute mishaps and his constant need for bathroom breaks during his pregnancy, how were they ever going to actually spend time together?
? So now you’re going to try to use my unborn child to convince me not to touch you? It won’t work, pet. You heard the Healer, you need me,” he let his large hand slide down Draco’s chest until it rested against his lower stomach, “you
Draco had begun having nightmares. He knew it was due to his captivity and concern over his growing pup.
He let his thumb slide over the wax seal on the front of the envelope in his other hand, sorrow crushing his heart. His sorrow felt like a vise that only constricted around his heart even further the closer he got to the end of his pregnancy.
Draco gave him a wan smile. “You don’t know my father. He can be very persuasive when he wants something to go his way…”
Harry knew Draco was hesitant to tell his parents the truth and Harry didn’t want to push him to do it. Their trust in each other had finally been established and he didn’t want to ruin what they had built so far.
The rabbit was trembling, his eyes darting around nervously. His fur looked matted in some places, sporadic smudges of dirt marring the pure white.
When he had finally emptied himself inside of Draco, Harry gingerly slid his cock out of the boy’s hole.
me.” He shook his head, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “When I saw you nursing Scorpius in the kitchen, I felt an overwhelming sense of protectiveness, Draco. You’re still lactating for our young pup and I can’t even—”
With a high-pitched moan, Draco lifted his hips. His small prick was hard, the pink crown seeping pre-cum across his flat stomach.
“Won’t you talk to Dada? I acted out of line. I assumed when I should have talked to you first. Won’t you look at me, baby? Won’t you look at Dada?”
“You also look as if you haven’t shaved in quite some time. You’re beginning to resemble more animal than man.”
”Well, go on then. I saw you eyeing them earlier. Pick it up, little one. Slash into my throat using all of that hate you claim to have for me.”
Blaise smiled, his dark eyes warm. “Sure, Draco. I’ll wait here with Blake. He wants to play Fairy Lights again.”
Draco tipped his head back, keening at the feeling of Harry’s cock ramming against that euphoric spot inside of him.
“Well, I won’t keep you two in suspense any longer. Lean back slightly for me, Draco,” Arlen chirped, raising his wand.
Draco’s knees felt weak, the pain in his back making it hard for him to remain upright. He inhaled Harry’s scent, his eyes closing as the scent of his
“But it’s true,” Draco whispered, letting his thumb caress Harry’s cheekbone, “you are my Alpha, and you are Scorpius’ Alpha. I’m not denying it or trying to hide it anymore.
The girl rolled her eyes. “What better time than now? Anyway, you’ll be busy with your chores for the next week and the master is leaving tomorrow for business.”
I kinda just wanted to write this chapter to give you an insight to Harry’s thoughts regarding Draco.
When his jellybean remained still inside of him, he turned off the water to the shower and pulled back the curtain.
Every inch of his skin had been covered in Harry’s cum and pheromones. It was almost like Harry had left him a humiliating message:
Before Harry could lick it all up, Draco was hard again, more heated slick oozing from his hole and coating Harry’s pumping fingers.
He sat down on one of the spindly iron benches that was in the area, adjusting Scorpius to lay over his lap.
“But…I want you to stay,” Draco said softly, stepping forward until they were only centimeters apart.
While he had been afraid of their relationship becoming public, Harry seemed to have no qualms about publicly showing his affection for Draco.
“Just a sandwich made with some of the leftover chicken I made for Scorpius today. He didn’t eat much of it. I hope you’re hungry.”
Draco’s heartbeat sped up, leaning into his Alpha’s touch. Harry’s natural scent wafted towards him, his pheromones calming Draco’s anxiety. It was so familiar to Draco now and it only made him wish for the closeness they had before his memory had revealed the truth.
He was dressed in a sweat dampened work shirt and frayed suspenders. His hands looked work-hewn and tanned.
Harry stopped in front of the armchair across from the bed. He sets Draco back on his feet, his unbridled expression of anger making Draco shrink back with fear.
He dusted off the front his trousers, already used to wearing soiled clothing from all the cleaning he had been assigned to do.  The smell of soap and other cleaning chemicals seemed to cling to him, even if he washed himself off each evening before bed.
“I’ll take care of it, Pansy,” Draco said curtly, not wanting to continue the conversation. “It’s only been three months since Theo’s disappearance and I’m still trying to get my life back under control while it’s in its current disastrous state.”
Ron halted his pacing, a furrow appearing between his light red brows. “Harry, I need you to come with me to the Ministry. We’ve found Narcissa Malfoy. We bloody found her, Harry!”
A carnivore fucking a herbivore, or vice versa, was considered a perversion of nature. It had happened quite often before the War, but now such things were absolutely forbidden. The pups of such couplings did everything to hide who they biologically were. If they were found out, they were treated as outcasts.
His flat in London was where they had raised their daughter, Juniper, at. It held so many fond memories and Draco wasn’t just going to…
protection until the Ministry finds your darling husband and returns him to you. Then, you’ll be able to go back to your
Draco drank in the sight of Harry’s thick erection straining against the front of his dark trousers, his dry mouth suddenly wet with excess saliva. He made quick work of unzipping Harry and pulling out his cock. His reddened shaft looked almost painfully hard, the head shiny with pre-cum.
Draco moaned and spread his legs as Harry pressed his hips between them. Harry smelled like alcohol, but his pheromones were still potent enough to overpower the scent, fucking with Draco’s head.
He wanted them to be close again. He wanted Harry to look at him like he had that night in Hogsmeade, like he was deeply,
Harry’s filthy words made Draco come with a shocked whimper, his cum shooting up between them and coating both of their chests with the hot fluid.
Harry released his wrist, arching a brow. “The photo of when I was a teenager. Why would that upset you?”
“I’d do it again, Draco. I’d do anything for you…” Harry was already leaning down, his gaze riveted to Draco’s mouth.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he ripped his arm from Harry’s grasp, adjusting his hold on Scorpius. ”None of your business,
Once again, Harry’s Alpha pheromones surrounded him, lulling him into a false sense of security. He sniffled and pressed up to his tiptoes, reluctantly nuzzling up into Harry’s exposed throat, his lips seeking out Harry’s sun-kissed skin.
Draco gave him a small smile, a small plastic container beneath his arm. “Hi, Harry. I hope you’re not too busy. I brought you lunch.”
He didn’t know the reason for his mother’s sudden insistence to send him away, but he knew he had to trust her.
Draco sighed, running a hand through his wayward hair. “I know, Pansy. It’s just been…difficult. Ever since Theo’s…disappearance, I haven’t been able to think about much except taking care of Juniper.”
Draco had pointed to it and then to Harry, his white ears twitching excitedly. In the end, Harry had been unable to deny him. He had bought it for his rabbit and had allowed the boy to pick out his preferred foods from the herbivore market.
That night, Harry had wanked off holding the pillowcase to his nose, inhaling Draco’s scent to push him towards climax.
Harry was on his feet and making his way to the lift before the door to his office had even closed all the way, Draco’s bottled memory clutched tightly in his fist.
Draco’s eyes were slitted, glazed with desire as he watched. He was undulating against Harry, his cute little Omega prick rubbing against his abdomen, covering it with pre-cum.
When he began pumping his finger in and out of his rabbit’s tight hole, the boy’s eyes popped open, meeting Harry’s when he looked down with a gasp.
He lowered his head and began licking up droplets of water from the boy’s velvet ears, letting his tongue occasionally dip inside to taste the warm, delicate membrane on the inside. His fur was sparse on the inside, the peach fuzz rubbing against his rough tongue with each lick.
”I’m right here, sweetheart. Just admiring how beautiful you look. So sweet for Dada. Do you want Dada’s tongue? Tell me.”
“N-n-no!” Draco attempted to scoot away, but Harry stopped him by grabbing his thigh and dragging him back.
”But this is what you wanted, Draco,” Harry taunted, stroking his cock, “you’d rather have anyone else inside of you, anyone except
The sudden light had the creatures scrabbling to the back of their cages, their eyes wide with fear.
The apology was on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn’t get it out. If he apologized to Harry, it would be conceding to something…
Potter dragged him outside by the arm and he struggled to remain upright, his traitorous body still trying to catch up to his mind.
Draco nodded, his lids feeling unbelievably heavy. “I will. I’ll tell them, Harry. Can we go to bed? I’m tired.”
And if one day, their bond did completely vanish, would Draco be able to cope with that and move on with his own life?
He knew that when he would awake, he’d want to be rutted again. An Omega’s heat usually lasted three to five days and Harry was more than happy to give Draco what he would naturally crave. Perhaps he would knot him more than once, until the boy would be
Draco pulled on the loosest jumper he had available from the pile of clothes Harry had bought for him. It was dark green, a sharp contrast to his pale complexion. Underneath the jumper, he wore a black button-down. His blond hair had grown longer, some pale strands having escaped from his half-knot and hanging in front of his eyes.
Draco felt two tears slide down the sides of his face, vacillating between begging for Harry to stop or just doing what he wanted.
Harry nuzzled his nose against Draco’s, still rubbing teasing circles into the skin of his hips with his thumbs. “I want it too, Draco, but not like this. Not while you’re drunk.”
behaved behind closed doors. Afterall, he had his unborn pup to think of now. If he could just make it through his pregnancy unscathed, he would plan an escape.
Draco shook his head, gazing up at Harry from under his lashes. “You didn’t take advantage, Harry,” his cheeks reddened, his voice going soft. “I...
Draco’s vision was blurred from his tears, a shuddering breath escaping his parted lips. He felt as if this was an ultimatum, a confession coaxed despite his desire to remain independent.
Draco stood and gave Roland one last indulgent half-smile before practically sprinting to the restroom.
The sore nipples, being excessively tired, and sporadic bouts of morning sickness were all symptoms he could handle by himself.
Harry pulled up Draco’s long-sleeved shirt, exposing his stomach and chest. His nipples were now permanently swollen, readying to nurse his pup once it was born. He tried to raise his hands to shield the small swell of his stomach, but Harry knocked his hands away.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “An Alpha who loves you, is that it?” he asked wryly. “What, fucking you on your hands and knees each night isn’t enough? You want
It made him whine around Harry’s cock, wanting their connection back with a vehemence that frightened him.
He glanced up at her, studying her profile in the warm sunlight. Her pale cheeks shone with wetness, droplets clinging to her eyelashes.
”Az—“ Draco pressed the back of his trembling hand to his lips. “You must bring me to her. I need to see her!” he shouted.
He was dressed in a black, formfitting equestrian jacket, and matching trousers that molded to his strong legs. Black leather riding boots encased his feet, ending at mid-calf.
Harry growled and smashed his mouth against Draco’s, shoving his tongue into his mouth. Draco dazedly licked against Harry’s tongue, closing his eyes and losing himself in the desperate kiss, his body still tingling with the remnants of his orgasm.
The boy grabbed the hem of his shirt, twisting it in his small hands nervously, shaking his head. His face was flushed, his ears totally flat against the back of his head.
”Hello, lovely,” Harry said, leaning down to be at eye-level with the rabbit cowering in the corner of his cage.
When Draco dropped to his hands and knees on the bed between his legs and began mouthing at Harry’s covered cock, he almost broke.
He thought it might be best to tell his parents at separate times. His father would react the worst, so Draco could only hope his mother’s reaction would be less so.
If anyone would be able to tell that something was amiss with Harry, it would be Hermione. The brilliant witch had a penchant for figuring out unsolvable puzzles, so Harry would have to put on the best performance of his life.
He glanced down at Scorpius who was reaching for the salt and pepper shakers again, his cherubic features arranged into an expression of absolute concentration.
Even in the darkest times of his captivity, when he felt like there was nothing left of himself and he was slowly drowning in his own despair, Hermione had pulled him back to the surface.
Draco keened and pinched his own nipples between his fingers, undulating under Harry’s skilled mouth and fingers.
Draco gritted his teeth, tired of everyone around him treating him as if he were made of glass. His parents had wanted him to move back into Malfoy Manor at first, but he had vehemently refused.
Hermione nodded. “Perhaps a family name? Maybe you could use Harry’s parents’ names. His mother’s name was so pretty.”
The indifferent man wasn’t even mated, and Draco could understand why. If Master Potter went about courting as he did conversing, it would be no surprise to him if any sane omega turned tail and ran as quick as they could.
When Harry felt Draco’s cum spurt hotly on his abdomen, he let out a low snarl and began to desperately fuck into his rabbit. He wanted to shoot his cum deep into the boy’s womb, get him pregnant with his litter, needing to—
Feeling uncharacteristically brave, Draco scooted closer to him on the sofa until he was almost in his lap.
Theo grinned; his long fingers still wrapped around his wrist. “Look at that! She likes you, Draco.”
Draco had been shifting non-stop for the past thirty minutes, presumedly coming out of the sleep potion induced coma.
Harry yanked off his shoes and pulled his shirt off over his head. He threw them in the direction of Draco’s bottoms.
Draco shivered, moaning softly as even more slick oozed between his legs. The scent was enough to make Harry’s cock twitch against Draco’s, feeling the boy’s small prick spurt more pre-cum against his shaft.
“I mean,” Harry fought to control the tone of his voice, “I think you should release the boy into my care. I’m unmated and you can trust me to ensure that the boy behaves outside of his mother’s influence. We don’t know what kind of information Narcissa has been feeding him over the subsequent years. She could have still been active as a Death Eater and any information Draco has in relation to that could be invaluable to the Ministry.”
He was ashamed to feel even more slick trickle from his hole, dripping to the floor between Harry’s feet.
. Almost took my sodding finger off once. No one wants him, probably will sell him off to be sold at the meat market,” Octavius grumbled.
. I work with your master at the Ministry. Perhaps he could loan you out to me during one of your heats.”
After the first time he had barged in while drunk, he had started coming back each night. Draco had fought him at first, but he knew it wasn’t a good idea to try to overexert himself so early in his pregnancy. Each time, Harry would be cold and clinical as he fucked him. He always made sure that Draco was leaking slick and moaning for more before he would take him, but always ended up fucking him from behind. After Harry would finish, he would always be sure to transfer some of his magic to his jellybean, ensuring that Draco’s pup was being taken care of.
He couldn’t just abandon her. There had to be a way to prove her innocence for whatever crime she had been suspected of committing.
He only had meat stored in his fridge and dry storage, the boy’s kibble he’d gotten from the pet store the only plant-based food he currently owned.
He was interrupted when Harry took his chin between his fingers, turning his head to face him. He steeled himself, meeting Harry’s eyes head-on. “I
Draco nodded, averting his gaze. “I just…I’m not feeling that great. Will you hold me and transfer your magic?
Draco remained silent, his eyes downcast. He was trembling, the truth bubbling up in his throat and threatening to spill over as the man bore a hole into him with his eyes from above.
Harry eyes darkened, pulling his fingers from his hole, a thin trail of slick still connecting them. He grabbed one of Draco’s thighs, spreading him almost painfully wide.
He stepped closer to the mantel, clutching the envelope to his chest. This close, he could see the filament cracks in the painting, a map work of aged veins that interspersed throughout Sirius’ dark eyes.
After two weeks of being holed up inside the room where he’d been raped, Kreacher had informed him that Harry was allowing him to roam the house on his own.
Harry was dressed in a dark gray button-down that hugged his muscular arms and chest. His long legs were encased in fitted black trousers, drawing Draco’s gaze between his legs.
Harry had taken away the only way of protecting himself against him. His magic was extension of his very
Harry grabbed the bottom of Draco’s pyjama top and tugged. “Take this off. Let me see,” he demanded.
She had stated that it was imperative he keep his name and identity a secret, lest the consequences be damning to their family.
you away. You lived in that idyllic town, not a care in the world for the crimes you had committed. You’re only saying these things because you were
“Please?” Harry asked, his voice low and thick with things Draco didn’t want to put a name to at that moment.
The tall Alpha was dressed in a black button-down with rolled up sleeves, his corded forearms visible. His hair shone like a raven’s wing under the sunlight, so deep black it almost appeared blue. He was smiling, his white teeth standing out against his tanned skin. There were faint lines next to the skin of his eyes, denoting his age.
to be honest, Harry! I just was afraid of your reaction and I wanted to be strong enough to do things on my own.”
Scorpius giggled wildly and pressed his nose against Harry’s scent gland, shyly scenting him. He had been doing it more and more as he grew more comfortable around Harry during their continued visits.
Harry glanced over at Ginny, who was walking next to him. Snowflakes were interspersed throughout her red hair, her pale cheeks flushed from the cold.
Draco flushed, feeling all eyes on him. “When I had him, the healers couldn’t stop fawning over him…”
Harry viewed Malfoy Manor as a gaudy Gothic tribute to the Malfoy family’s namesake, a stone erection that bespoke Pure-blooded superiority.
“Your manacles had rendered you magically null. The island has an Anti-Apparation jinx on it. Without a wand, escape is almost impossible.”
When it was no longer bleeding, Harry pulled back and ripped off Draco’s pyjama bottoms with his hands. He pressed Draco’s knees back until he was almost folded in half atop the table, cool air against his wet, exposed hole.
One of Harry’s Aurors, Jack Ryker, had teasingly called out to him as they’d left, but a deep growl from Harry had abruptly silenced Jack into amused silence.
Harry had just been barely able to stop himself from lapping at the boy’s reddened wrists, getting a hold of himself just before his tongue could touch the irritated skin.
His nipples had become swollen and had gradually darkened to a deep rose color due to his pregnancy.
His Alpha was exuding anger and he went instinctively pliant to show him that he was completely defenseless if Harry wanted to hurt him. He bared his throat and funneled his fear into their shared bond, trying to convey to his Alpha that he was vulnerable and aching.
He knew that Harry was denying him the attention and worship he needed as Omega to thrive after a mating bite, and it infuriated him while simultaneously making him feel a gaping
”Fine. I’ll knock off some galleons due to to his unfortunate afflictions. I’ll even throw in some kibble that he’ll be able to consume in his current form, all plant-based, of course. I’ll be right back.”
Harry pulled the boy back against him by his hips, his neglected cock pulsing with desire as the boy settled between his legs.
Draco dragged his potted fern from its spot on his small balcony. He had set it out so that it could get some indirect sunlight. It had been looking a bit droopy the past few days.
The endless chores at least kept his mind off of missing his mother and wondering how she was fairing all alone back at Wiltshire.
Harry watched as Arlen helped him to his feet before Draco could object. Harry’s gaze lingered on Arlen’s hand when he platonically pressed it to the small of his back.
“What?” Lucius asked, crossing his legs. “Can I not be curious why you’re traipsing about with Harry Potter? You’re my son, I have a right to know.”
The sound of Draco’s pained cries echoed in his mind, slowly pulling at the already fragile seams of his unraveling sanity.
“Beautiful like his mummy,” Harry rasped softly, nudging his knee against Draco’s under the table, making his breath catch. He turned and looked up at Harry from under his lashes, flushing under his Alpha’s heavy-lidded gaze.
Harry smiled back, trying not to give anything away. “He’s sleeping. He’s about to go through his heat, so he’s been dreadfully tired.”
Draco nuzzled into Pansy’s dark hair, inhaling her familiar scent. “You’re a great friend, you know that, right?” he mumbled.
It was an Alpha’s duty to make sure his Omega was happy and comfortable to be able to care for their young.
Harry took his trembling hand into his own, rubbing his thumb in small circles against his skin. “Why don’t we go lay down for a while, sweetheart? You’re tired. You know what Arlen said about your stress levels.”
The logical part of Draco recoiled in abject horror, wanting to get himself far away from this scary man and his proposed plans for his body.
”Greedy boy,” Harry chided. “Take down your shirt, I see how hard your nipples are. Let me take a look and I’ll think about fulfilling your request.”
Harry smiled cruelly. “That’s amusing to me, Draco. The son of two actual monsters calling me such a thing. You don’t know the meaning of the word, but I will show you just how
Draco sighed, placing the spoon back into the applesauce container. “I know you’re hungry, love. Do you want something else, is that it?”
“I’m sorry we couldn’t find the culprits, Narcissa, but I can confidently say that no harm will come to you or your family while I’m around.” Draco felt Harry’s gaze on him, their bond flaring with a surge of protectiveness. “I promise.”
Draco made a feeble attempt to push his head away but Harry let out a low warning growl, making Draco clasp his hands to his chest in fear.
With a weary sigh, Draco dropped the scouring brush to the floor. He raised his aching hands in front of his face, closely examining them.
In a darkened corner of the cell, Narcissa sat. She was curled up, her thin wrists and ankles magically manacled. Her hair was fully white now, snarled and dirty. Her threadbare uniform hung on her now gaunt frame, her skin ashen. Slowly, she lifted her head up from her bent knees, her blue eyes cold and empty.
The inherent Omega part of Draco keened in approval at the man towering over him. It recognized a worthy mate that could provide protection for him and any babes they would produce together.
Harry seemed relaxed, having already had a few drinks of Firewhisky with Ron. Draco couldn’t stop stealing glances at him, averting his gaze when Harry would catch him staring.
He could have used the Floo, but wanted to check on his Aurors that were stationed outside the home.
Harry followed Ron to the back of the shop, his eyebrows climbing higher on his forehead as the items for sale grew more nefarious the farther they went in.
Jack had been teasing him all week about his changed behavior at work. Jack knew that Harry’s improved attitude was most likely because of his renewed relationship with Draco after working things out.
Without speaking, Draco scooted backwards off his lap and got to his knees between Harry’s spread legs.
Draco felt warmth suffuse his chest at Harry’s considerate question. “Yes, that’s fine. Thank you, Harry. Not just for dinner, but for taking us in on such short notice like this. I really feel like I’m overreacting.”
Even though they had their own lives with their own problems, they didn’t have to carry the burden that had stayed with him for the past eight years.
Draco switched Scorpius around in arms, letting the pup latch onto his other nipple before responding. “I-I don’t know, Mr. Potter. I don’t want to intrude…I feel so silly making such a fuss about this…” Draco let his finger brush across one of Scorpius’ cheeks absentmindedly as the pup suckled.
“I just want to get through this ridiculous meeting, Pansy. I’ll worry about my other problems tomorrow.”
Draco’s father had been disappointed that he had presented as an omega at an early age. He knew his father had wanted an alpha son to carry on their family name and his mother’s inability to give Lucius what he wanted had resulted in their slowly deteriorating marriage.
Harry grabbed Draco’s throat above his collar with one hand, lifting him from his seat. Draco clawed uselessly at the strong fingers around his throat, his airway cut off.
A flicker of what Draco could only assume was pain tightened Harry’s features, but it was quickly erased before he could discern it.
Harry leaned over slightly, the smell of his pheromones overpowering that close up. An errant strand of Harry’s dark hair brushed his cheek. Draco had to smother a whimper that was attempting to claw its way up his throat.
The doors closed with a soft thud, the lift slowly propelling Draco upwards towards the man he vowed he would never set eyes again.
Harry stood from the bed, staring down at Draco as he silently sobbed. “You’re coming downstairs with me. You will eat and you
Jumping to his feet, he yanked up his trousers and spun around, feeling cold and bereft in the wake of the alpha’s wicked embrace.
When he’d emptied himself of his mate, he gently pulled out. Draco was panting beneath him, covered in his own cum. He watched, transfixed as his own cum slowly leaked out of Draco’s hole along with the boy’s clear slick.
The emerald flames of the Floo engulfed them for a moment before completely snuffing out, leaving nothing in their wake but an empty spot in Harry’s fireplace.
Sometimes, it unnerved him how perceptive his daughter was. It was why he was never able to forget what Alpha had fathered her. She showed traits of him every day. From the sly way she could get information out of people without even trying, to the way she seemed to be able to read his own thoughts just by looking at his face.
If only he could banish the erection he had since scenting Draco for the first time. He’d excused himself for a moment to tuck his leaking cock into the waistband of his trousers, but it still hadn’t abated.
Harry leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to Draco’s lips, pulling back to teasingly let his lips slide over Draco’s in a soft caress that had him taking a sharp inhale.
hadn’t erased what Harry had felt in his heart for Draco and now that they were both laid bare to each other, he never wanted to be parted from his family again.
Strong arms caught him from the front mid-fall, pulling him upright. On reflex, he wrapped both of his hands around the man’s arms, steadying himself.
He glanced over at his chaperone, Mrs. McGonagall, who had greeted him at the train station to take him to the manor.
When he had finally emptied himself inside of his Omega, he gingerly pulled the boy up, his cock still inside of him. He laid them both on their sides, grinning when the boy unconsciously scooted closer, turning his head to nuzzle his nose against Harry’s scent gland on his neck, softly purring.
When Hermione had become pregnant with their daughter, Rose, Ron had sequestered Hermione away in their house. He hadn’t allowed her to do anything for herself, waiting on her hand and foot her entire pregnancy.
While taking Draco to the different shops, the boy had picked up a stuffed wolf from one of the display shelves. It had been a child’s toy, but it had obviously excited him.
“There’s something else I should tell you,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair in a gesture that Draco was beginning to recognize as nervousness or anger.
He wished he could tell Hermione everything. He wished she could take him away from all of this. He wished…
His ears still tingled from the boy’s touch. His tail was gently wagging behind him, but Harry grabbed it, digging his claws into his fur to stop it.
Harry’s lips smelled of Draco’s cum and slick and Draco felt a twisted sort of instinctual satisfaction that his Alpha smelled of his juices.
Draco held his tongue, not wanting to get in trouble with the master of the manor on the first day. When he remained silent, the man’s eyes dropped back down the papers he held.
Harry barely restrained a groan, shifting Draco on his lap so that he couldn’t feel his erection prodding his arse. “You mean, you want me to…spit on them?”
Questions plagued him about what would happen to his body if he actually became pregnant. His mother had never liked talking about his father or her pregnancy with him. He knew it had been painful for her to remember those things, so he had never pressed.
“Who will be cross?” Draco asked, trying not to trip over his own feet as the girl dragged him down the long, winding corridors of the manor.
“I’m sorr—” Draco cut himself off, mortification and disgust overtaking him at what he was about to say.
Draco undulated atop the table, his little broken sobs and whimpers the only sounds in the kitchen accompanying the obscene sounds of Harry’s tongue against his slick-covered genitals.
After taking a deep inhale, Potter blew out a plume of smoke, some of it escaping through his nostrils and reminding Draco of the Devil himself.
Draco shifted his sleeping pup in his arms, pulling his shirt back over his bare breast as Harry watched in weighted silence.
His mother, Narcissa, still watched Juniper while he worked long shifts at St. Mungo’s, but he knew when his baby came, he’d have to rely even more on his parents’ help if Theo didn’t…
The entire right portion of his face was warped from the Fiendfyre, the once unblemished, olive skin now scarred over and silvered with age.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh. “It doesn’t matter. He doesn’t want to talk to me, so there’s no use in dwelling on it.”
“You’re so handsome,” Draco murmured, gazing up at Harry with what he was sure was a dopey, love-sick smile.
Without saying anything, Draco walked around his father’s desk and reached out his hand to card through Harry’s raven hair. He let out a sharp gasp when Harry snatched his wrist, stopping him.
It was almost impossible to believe that Narcissa would never mention the Malfoy lineage and all of their illicit involvements.
Draco had asked Kreacher to bring him a book on magical Omega pregnancies and what to expect. He knew the house-elf had requested permission from Harry first. One evening, the book had appeared on the nightstand next to his bed, so he guessed Harry was okay with him learning about his own body.
It was almost as if he wanted to scream, but he didn’t know why. A feeling like he wanted to expel something from his very soul.
Harry leaned back on the sofa with Scorpius in his arms, looking down at Draco under hooded lids. His gaze flicked over Draco’s chest before saying, “Maybe I didn’t take
Maybe this had all been for naught. Would his mother be terribly disappointed in him? What would become of the Malfoy name?
“I love them both, with my entire heart. They are my family, and I don’t want to be parted from them ever again, Narcissa.”
Harry let out an involuntary growl, the fingers of his free hand clenching into a fist atop his thigh.
Harry came inside of him, moaning low, kissing up his breasts and throat. When their lips met, Draco lost himself in it. Harry’s cum, leaked from his hole, dripping down his thighs and reminding him that he was—
Fear was evident in his voice, his glassy eyes wide with terror. He spread his legs submissively and pressed his chest out even more with a small whimper, not looking away from Harry.
Harry’s crude words made Draco’s face suffuse with heat, unused to someone talking so crassly in front of him. He was even more mortified when a fresh gush of slick seeped from his hole, wetting the crotch of his pyjama pants.
Draco awoke with a heavy arm draped over him, his legs entangled with someone else’s under the sheets. He turned his head, his lips parting on a small, surprised exhale.
“Your father is good man, Draco. He just has…things that need to be taken care of and we can’t have you here while we’re taking care of those affairs. It will be safest to send you away. What I need from you right now is your faith and cooperation. You do believe in me, don’t you, Draco?”
Harry just stared down at him, his eyes giving nothing away. “My touch is so abhorrent to you, is it?”
Harry sighed and rested his chin in hand, placing his elbow on the arm of the chair, a look of boredom on his face. “I’m waiting, pet. Hurry up before I change my mind and your punishment will be being locked in this room for three days without my touch.”
“But our bond…” Draco whispered hoarsely, staring at his feet, “if we ignore each other, it will hurt us, Harry.”
His skin felt too tight over his muscles, the cloying scent of the boy wafting to Harry's nostrils and setting his teeth on edge. The smell seemed to permeate the air around him, closing in from all sides in the enclosed space.
Harry was asleep, his dark hair sex-mussed and stark against the white pillowcase. The lines by his eyes were smoothed out, his dark lashes resting against his cheeks as he slumbered.
Pulling back, he leaned forward and sucked Draco’s small prick into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head and playfully dipping it into his slit.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Joke about it all you like, but your husband is still missing if you’ve forgotten
Their bond flared to life between them, like an electrical current. It was as natural as breathing and Draco regretted fighting his instinctual impulses when it came to Harry for so long.
He roughly slammed him back against the wall, glaring down at him with undisguised hatred burning in his eyes.
When he felt the boy’s wet scut press against his hard cock, he groaned low in his throat, exhilarating in the feel of the boy’s wet, downy fur caressing his shaft as he slid down to a sitting position.
Scorpius let out whine, reaching for Draco. Harry lifted the pup and handed him to his mum, watching as Scorpius began nuzzling against Draco’s covered chest.
“Oh,” Draco breathed, his heart thumping heavily in his chest. “Are you still angry with me, Harry?”
Draco turned and spotted a carrier of an eclectic mix of spices on the counter behind him. He grabbed them and scurried over to the girl’s side, setting them on the marble countertop next to her.
I’m having a really fun time writing this fic, but I’m going to take a break from it for a bit to update my other neglected fics. I hope you enjoy this chapter and Happy Holidays!
Harry shrugged him off and walked over to his father’s leather wingback chair behind his large desk, sitting down in it. He slouched forward, resting his elbows on his knees and covering his face with both of his hands.
times? Your rudimentary muffling spell was almost laughable. Your mother’s home schooling was seriously lacking, pet.”
The boy’s face was pressed against his bare chest, a little dribble of saliva trickling from the side of his full, pink lips. His long, light eyelashes tickled Harry’s skin as his eyes moved restlessly beneath his lids. He murmured something and shifted on top of Harry, attempting to bury his small nose into Harry’s armpit.
Draco looked up at him from under his lashes as the Healer was distracted, sorting through his bag of medical supplies.
Draco was openly sobbing now, hugging his arms tight around himself trying to self-soothe without his Alpha’s needed affections.
Magical history books and novels written by long-dead famous witches and wizards lined the black mahogany shelves behind Kingsley, providing him a backdrop of annoyingly implied intelligence and superiority.
“See?” Harry purred. “Our pup knows who Daddy is. I don’t want you letting anyone but me touch you, Draco. If he needs to touch you,
Harry followed Draco through the manor and up the stairs, his looming presence at his back the whole way to their pup’s nursery. He was reluctant to finally be forthcoming with Harry, but he knew he owed it to him to be honest.
”Perhaps Narcissa chose to shield him from that part of her life. As a mother, I could understand. A good parent would want the best for their children. Maybe she thought it would be better if Draco never found out about them being Death Eaters at one time.”
They had barely spoken to each other on the ride through the moors and Draco was quickly realizing she was a no-nonsense type of person, but he supposed she had to be in order to care for such a vast estate and keep things in order.
When he pressed his open mouth to Draco’s leaking hole, he couldn’t hold back a moan. He tasted just like he remembered, sweet with an afterbite of something uniquely
Harry’s trousers were covered in Draco’s dried cum, slick, and breast milk. His cock was throbbing from neglect, pressing painfully against his zipper. Draco had tried tearing it from his trousers several times throughout the night out of sheer desperation, but had finally given in to just rubbing his arse against it to get off.
Harry’s whole body was taut, his full lips clamped shut as. Draco nibbled at his skin. The salt from his tears flavored each kiss, making Draco’s chapped lips burn in a delicious sort of way.
She was staring at Harry with wide eyes, one of the fingers of her free hand innocently hooked in her mouth.
“Good boy, such a good boy for dada,” Harry cooed, giving the rabbit a long lick against one of his ears.
When Draco had mentioned going to stay with Blaise when his home had been broken into, Harry had looked up the boy’s family using his resources at the Ministry. At the time, he had told himself it was part of the investigation, but that hadn’t been the truth.
Harry immediately walked around his desk, closing the distance between them. He stopped directly in front of Draco, staring down at him with concern. “You didn’t barge in. I wasn’t busy, I promise. What’s wrong, Draco?”
When he had found out about his pregnancy, he had so much to think about and plan. He had known that Harry was an Auror for the Ministry, and he hadn’t wanted to interrupt his career and life for an unplanned pregnancy.
As an Omega, Draco would be able to smell and sense Harry’s dominant presence. It was in their nature.
Draco let out a huff of disbelief, his eyes widening. “There’s nothing going on between Arlen and I!”
Jack grinned, a playful glint in his eyes when he looked at Harry. “That would be lovely, Draco. You know, I prefer chocolate chip cookies, so if you could—”
Harry blew a plume of smoke against the front of the Prophet, his insides twisting with pleasure as he watched the wisps of smoke curl around Narcissa’s regal features.
that the Alpha was nearby, his musky pheromones present in the air around him. The Alpha’s pheromones only exacerbated his heat, his hole wet and dripping slick in preparation for Harry’s cock.
Once they were met with the cool night air outside of the posh restaurant, Draco halted, digging his heels into the paved sidewalk to make Harry stop.
Draco tucked in, not caring if the eggs were overdone. In that moment, he felt nothing but happiness. For once in his life, he felt sure of his decision and of himself.
"I'm sorry, Harry," Draco murmured, scooting closer to him on the plush sofa. "I'm just nervous to tell her. I'm afraid she'll be…angry."
“Yes, but you know I like my solitude. Having a pet to care for isn’t high on my list of priorities.”
Harry narrowed his eyes and pulled out his slick-coated finger before lowering his head between Draco’s legs. Without any preamble, he swiped his tongue up Draco’s hole, collecting the leaking slick into his mouth.
“I’m from the Ministry of Magic. I’m Harry Potter. Your mother told me you would be out here. There’s another Auror inside asking her some questions, so I thought I’d come out and speak with you.”
The damage stretched from his hairline and down, disappearing into the collar of his black button-down. The right side of his lips were uneven, making him appear as if he were wearing a permanent scowl.
He wanted nothing more than to see Harry again. The only thing that got him through his unbearable heats was the memory of Harry’s mouth, suckling at his breasts and fingering his wet,
It was like nothing he had ever felt before. There were no more walls between them, no more lies. It was just Harry and Draco, sharing their bodies and their hearts.
Draco had acted like he was sleeping. Harry had stood at the foot of the bed, silently watching him. He had felt Harry’s eyes boring into him from above, his skin prickling with awareness.
He was embarrassed to admit that the tiny swell of Draco’s lactating breast had made his cock stiffen.
“Don’t worry about it, Roland. I’ll just run to the loo to clean up. My daughter spills things all the time, so I’m used to it.” Draco chuckled. “She managed to knock over an entire pitcher of lemonade to the floor the other day.”
Draco frowned. “Mrs. McGonagall instructed me not to leave the manor and that all of my assigned duties were to remain inside. She was very adamant about that when she detailed my job duties.”
Draco shifted Scorpius to his hip, fidgeting with his jumper and trying to come up with a plausible reason for Harry’s current presence. “Harry was just leaving, he,
refreshed and had haphazardly finger-combed his hair, he ambled into the corridor outside of the bedroom and down the stairs towards the kitchen.
His mother placed her hands on her hips. “Maybe you should take him over to visit with Blaise. You haven’t seen him since the festival and Scorpius would probably love to see him. It would do you both some good.”
His Omega pheromones hung thick and heavy in the air, making Harry’s cock almost instantaneously harden in response.
Harry reached over with the hand not supporting Scorpius and placed his fingers on Draco’s chin, turning his head up higher. “As I promised before, I won’t let anyone hurt either of you, Draco, not even your own family.”
Draco could smell his own potent pheromones on Harry, heady and thick. His Alpha smelled of him and was
Draco flushed and let his legs fall open in surrender when Harry went back to kissing down his stomach, nuzzling against his sparse pubic hair before he felt Harry’s wet tongue press against his leaking prick.
His daughter’s remembered words were like a knife to his heart. If only she knew who she was picking the flowers out for.
Harry idly wondered what his and Draco’s offspring would look like. Would they resemble Draco, having pale hair and eyes? Or would his mother’s emerald eyes be passed on to his child?
Harry’s grip on his breasts became painful, his fingertips biting into his sensitive skin. “Do you think I’m an idiot, Draco? Do you think I’m not listening and watching you at
“Come back in here after you give them it. I could use some help plating,” Pansy said, flicking her knife and making droplets of blood fly across the countertop.
It was usually a process reserved for young, but Harry supposed he could make an exception for the vulnerable creature.
“Scorpius, no, darling,” Draco attempted to pull Harry’s fingers from the pup’s mouth, a bolt of desire hitting him when their fingers touched.
Draco’s dada was standing in the entryway of the kitchen. He sniffed the air, his eyes darkening with suspicion. He emitted a low growl, making the short hairs at the nape of Draco’s neck stand on end.
Harry had thought it was his instincts pushing him towards the boy, but he realized it wasn’t that at all.
After a difficult pregnancy and birth, Hermione and Ron had made the decision not to try for another baby.
“That’s fine. It doesn’t have to be consensual, you know. Your heat will be upon you soon, and I think it’s
Harry straightened from his relaxed posture against the wall. He walked over to Narcissa and got to his haunches in front of her.
He was almost bent completely in half, the position not that comfortable, but he couldn’t seem to really care. All his focus was on Draco’s expression and needy gasps.
It was nothing like Malfoy Manor. He suddenly missed his mother’s flourishing garden and the verdant grass of his own manor’s kempt lawn.
The rope painfully tethering his hands to the bed frame didn’t even phase him anymore, his heat overpowering that trivial ache with waves of excruciating heat that seemed to radiate from his groin and hole.
Draco chose not to respond, wrapping his lips around Harry’s shaft and flattening his tongue against his frenulum. He licked up to the slit where Harry’s pre-cum was flowing from, wanting to savor every drop.
Using only his grip on his neck, Harry tossed Draco backwards on the bed and went to sit in the armchair across from the bed. He was still naked, his cock hard and leaking between his legs.
The words hung unsaid in the air between them, but Draco could see the accusation burning in Harry’s emerald gaze.
He was glad Ron had taken his daughter to Diagon Alley so that Hermione and he could have some time alone together to catch up. He didn’t like being away from her, but he didn’t want to bring up certain things about his past in front of his daughter.
Draco grinned, placing his hand overtop Arlen’s on his stomach. “That’s funny. They usually only do that when Harry is touching my stomach. Must be restless today.”
He shook his head and sank his claws into one of his thighs, the needed pain grounding him enough to fight off the shift.
Harry repeated the same process for Draco’s other leaking nipple, taking more time than necessary coating the swollen bud.
Draco set Scorpius on his feet and watched as their pup clumsily rushed over to Harry. Harry immediately stooped and swept Scorpius into his awaiting arms, chuckling.
His best friend, Hermione Granger, stood in front of him with her hands on her hips. She had insisted on paying him a visit and had basically accosted him at his front door that day. He’d forgotten who he was dealing with when he had chosen to ignore her letters for the past month.
Harry dug his claws into his palms, the bite of pain needed to pull him from his primal state of mind.
Draco let his thumb brush against the edge of Harry’s lips, surprised to feel how soft they felt. He let his hand slide lower, his fingers encircling the man’s muscular throat. When Draco’s fingertips brushed against one of Harry’s scent glands, he snatched Draco’s hand away.
Reluctantly, he raised both his hands in front of him and turned them over, showing his blistered palms.
He hadn’t seen Harry Potter in over eleven years. After the accident with the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts and winning the war, Harry Potter had disappeared from the public eye completely.
of our love, Draco. There is only the truth, and that is that we are in love with each other. You are my mate and Scorpius is my son, and that’s never changing. Your father will just have to accept that.”
When Harry added a third finger, he curled them, pressing against his prostate. The suction of Harry’s mouth and pressure from his fingers tipped him over the edge, making him come with high-pitched moan. His vision briefly went white, heat licking up his spine and making his body feel as it were ablaze as his orgasm inexorably ripped through him. Harry swallowed his cum, pulling back to lick up the rest of his release that dribbled down his cock.
His dada stood taller, blocking their view of him behind his back. “What I said, Hermione. He won’t speak and I’m not going to force him into doing it.”
Harry reached forward and grabbed his wrist, yanking him down. Draco fell unceremoniously atop his lap, his breath hitching when Harry slid his hand up the back of his navy jumper.
“I forgive you, Hermione. I forgive you because I want to let go of the past. What happened back then is something I want to move on from. So please, do not blame yourself.”
His mother, Narcissa, had picked up his daughter only moments before to watch her while he worked his morning shift at the hospital.
Draco moaned, arching up from the bed until the hardened bud brushed against his lips, smearing warm milk across them.
“Thank you for having me, Narcissa,” Harry said, rubbing soothing circles onto Scorpius’ back. “They’re going as well as they can be. There’s a been an uptick in my caseload, but that’s to be expected. It’s the warmer months now, and we see an influx of magic misuse the most during that time.”
His cock instinctively reacted, blood swiftly filling his shaft until he was rigid beneath his trousers. His fangs lengthened, erupting from his gums, slicing his lower lip with how fast they slid down.
Time away from Draco and his pup had made him into someone he didn’t recognize. He found himself going through the motions, waking up and going to work, but nothing felt
“I love you, my sweet baby,” Draco whispered, smiling when he felt Scorpius raise his nose to nuzzle against his scent gland in response.
Harry quickly stood, dragging Draco up by his hair. The boy let out a whimper, stumbling as Harry led him over to the bed.
A hot trickle of blood slid down the side of Draco’s throat, becoming trapped under his collar. Harry pulled back and lapped at the droplets of blood, the chemicals in his saliva closing the wound as he laved it with his tongue.
“Do you like your new clothes?” he asked in a gravelly voice, his fingers trailing up Draco’s spine.
Harry smirked. “I suppose you’re right about that. I’m just trying to narrow things down, though. I wouldn’t want to leave you and your pup unprotected by not doing my job thoroughly.”
,” Draco mewled, his hard prick tortuously rubbing against Harry’s hard abdomen each time Harry rammed into him.
When they came to a halt in front of large door, the girl turned around and crossed her arms over her chest, giving him a withering look.
His eyes traveled over to Ginny, whose speculative gaze was on Harry, a small furrow between her red brows. When their eyes met, Draco quickly looked away.
He found a secluded area in the middle of the garden where a short tree provided some shade. His mother’s pale pink Constance Spry roses were in full bloom, threaded throughout the wrought-iron fence that bordered the garden. They emitted a lovely myrrh fragrance, calming Draco’s frayed nerves.
Ron nodded. “Took Pansy nearly two weeks to be comfortable enough to change back. They have to be able to trust you first. Bloody fickle creatures, herbivores.”
“Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger,” he said instead. “You were right to come to me. I can protect you both. You can trust me.”
She was an older woman and a beta. Her grey hair was pulled back in a severe bun, giving her an almost feline-like appearance.  She had sharp dark eyes and thin lips that seemed to be set in a permanent scowl.
Draco moaned when he felt a trickle of milk leak from his nipple, blotting the front of his borrowed shirt.
His mother looked enamored, the obvious affection in her eyes something unfamiliar to him. It was surreal to see his mother in the photo, in a life before having him. She looked happy and young.
Harry idly wondered what they would look like engorged and dripping milk. If Draco became pregnant, Harry knew they would become swollen and sensitive.
Hermione raised a brow. “Unaware of? Ron, whatever this about, can it wait? Draco is at St Mungo’s and he needs us there. He needs
When he would take in the familiar dark décor and soft black sheets beneath him, dread would skitter up his spine, quick and sinister.
the way, stuff that slutty hole,” Harry snapped, widening his legs to let Draco better see his heavy erection.
This was very different from their bath time when the boy was in his rabbit form. If Harry cleaned the boy’s prick with his tongue, he would be risking letting his instincts take over.
As Harry carried him, he could feel his magic gathering inside of him, like a brewing storm because of his growing fear. He quickly tamped it back down, his jellybean’s continued kicks against his stomach reminding him of
A young Auror on his team, Ender Pierce, was slumped against one of the columns bracketing the front doors. He looked bored, tossing his wand in the air above him and watching it let off sparks before catching it in his hand again.
“Oh?” Harry sat at the kitchen table, unfolding the latest copy of the Prophet to peruse. “Well, that sounds lovely, Gin. How long will you be gone?”
Draco’s breathing became shallow, his resolve weakening at Harry’s words. “Because…I just can’t, okay?
“Feel better, pet?” he whispered against his ear before nuzzling against Draco’s marked gland, playfully nipping at it with his teeth.
The most recent memory in Harry’s mind was of Draco on the floor in front of him. He saw himself, a cruel smile on his face as he held Draco’s head up by his hair.
A niggling sort of dread surfaced in the back of Draco’s mind, his own self-doubt and insecurities suddenly swarming his post-sex hazed mind.
The only light being emitted in the room was a small fire that was lit in the fireplace behind the desk, lining the man’s distinguished profile in a reddish glow. He turned slightly, his eyes briefly flickering over Draco before returning to stare across the room at nothing.
Draco shifted on top of his makeshift nest, rolling fully to his back. Still hugging his stuffed wolf to his chest, he whimpered, spread his legs.
Before Draco could rebuke Roland for his callous words, Harry tightened his fingers on his wrist in  warning, his grip firm but gentle.
“I don’t see why we had to come here. Nothing has happened since the break-in and this all seems so unnecessary. Yes, it’s downright
He attempted to bring his magic to the surface, but it quickly fizzled out as another wave of cramping pain seized him, disarming him completely.
Draco dropped his gaze to his feet, uncertain about disobeying orders in the first week of living at the manor. “I don’t know, Pansy…”
Draco gritted his teeth and threw his head back against the mattress, trying to adjust to Harry’s huge cock inside of him.
His sweetheart kept his gaze on the floor before reluctantly glancing up at Harry from under his blond lashes.
Harry sat motionless on the bed, staring at Draco’s naked body with narrowed eyes. “I’m Harry Potter. Your mother, Narcissa, has been taken prisoner by the British Ministry of Magic. She’s being transported to Azkaban as we speak.”
Draco knew his life as an Omega would be a difficult one. His unique ability to bear children would make him desperately desired by Alphas.
Scorpius shifted restlessly and turned over, pressing his nose to Draco’s clothed chest, wrinkling his small nose in his sleep. Draco clumsily tried to take out his breast to nurse his pup, sensing his need to suckle.
He squeezed Scorpius against his chest, breathing in the smell of pancake batter and Harry’s own unique scent from his hair. “I don’t want to interfere with your job, Harry…”
“Well,” Harry said gruffly, “you’re the mother and you know what’s best for you and your pup. If you’re not ready to stop and Scorpius isn’t ready…”
“The Healer from St Mungo’s is stopping by next week. He’ll be checking on your health and will determine if you are pregnant or not. In the meantime, sit tight and be a
Ron cleared his throat, shifting. "That's not just any child, Harry." He turned to look at Harry, wearing a grave expression. "That's the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy."
“I suppose I want some closure. If I told you I was completely healed from what he did to me, it would be a lie, Hermione. I guess…I just want to see if my memories reflect the man who held me captive all those years ago. If he’s still as…”
A contended purr sounded from his chest as Harry’s magic suffused him, losing himself in the dizzying influx of his Alpha’s magic and pheromones suddenly overtaking his body.
The boy was openly moaning now, pressing his thighs together, his hands resting on top of Harry’s raised knees.
Draco nodded and watched as Blaise disappeared back into the throng of people gathered around the game booth.
Harry lightly pressed his palm against Draco’s stomach, shooting him a devilish grin when their pup kicked in reaction to their Alpha’s touch.
Hermione shook her head. “It’s quite all right, Draco. I remember what it was like. Go get some rest and I’ll see you next week, okay?”
progress had been made, however. The rabbit had started to eat his kibble and had stopped trembling every time Harry approached his cage.
Draco felt tears spring to his eyes, his hatred of Potter’s callous treatment of him warring with the unexplained arousal he felt in his presence.
He pulled his fingers out of his mouth, a thin trail of diaphanous saliva still connecting them before he flicked out his tongue to lick it up.
Draco shook his head, gathering up the remnants of crumbled eggs from his tiled kitchen floor. “They’re basically forcing it on me. I can understand their concern, but I really don’t think it’s necessary.”
He filled two separate dishes with water and the plant-based kibble, setting them close to the slumbering rabbit in the cage.
Harry pressed his cheek to the boy’s damp blond hair, caressing his rabbit’s arm with his claws and smiling when he shivered in response.
A feeling of trickling despair was slowly settling in his stomach at the thought of this being his new…
Two weeks later, Harry was walking down one of the corridors at the Ministry, his thoughts once again centered around Draco.
Hermione sighed and sat on the sofa. “I can’t keep up with her anymore. She’s like a bullet, that one.”
“My mother is a good woman!” Draco yelled indignantly. “I don’t know why the Ministry would take her to Azkaban. It doesn’t make sense to me. She always did her best to protect and care for me.”
Before Harry could finish his pleading, Draco leaned forward and grabbed Harry’s cock with one hand, sucking his shaft into the back of his throat in one go.
His rabbit’s eyes were closed, his eyes moving restlessly beneath his lids. Harry watched in avid fascination as a droplet of perspiration slid down the boy’s neck and caught on the back of his collar.
It was already too much that his mother would  accost him with prying questions every time he picked up Juniper from her after work.
Harry let out a strangled sound, stilling Draco with his hands on his hips. “Not tonight. This is one thing I won’t concede to.” He pulled back to look at him fully. “Will you stay the night, sweetheart? I’ll make breakfast for you both in the morning.”
Harry deepened the kiss, tilting his head slightly for better access. Draco didn’t know what to do, so he hesitantly brushed his tongue against Harry’s. The taste of Harry’s saliva against his tongue made him softly moan, sliding his hands up and twining them around Harry’s neck, his eyes sliding shut in surrender.
A line appeared between Pansy’s dark brows, her demeanor softening. “Aw, don’t cry kid. You have to be on guard. Being an Omega herbivore isn’t the going to be the easiest life, you know?”
Draco inwardly flinched, not liking the memory of that terrible day. Harry had been upset after discovering the truth out about Scorpius and sought him out to confront him.
Once he would realize that he was still being held captive, the weight of the collar around his neck would suddenly seem unbearable. It rested against his skin, making his flesh feel hot and itchy.
“I guess so. They’re still investigating the circumstances of Theo’s disappearance and they can’t rule out foul play. It’s just a precaution.”
“My life is not perfect, Potter,” he hissed, lowering his voice to a whisper. “Just because I moved on with my life after the war does not mean you can make me feel bad for…
Draco was pregnant with his pup, mated to him, and his body already defiled by him numerous times since they’d met.
With Harry’s help, Draco got to unsteadily to his feet. He gingerly placed one knee on the cushion of the armchair, then the other, bracketing Harry’s hips. His belly was between them, pressing against Harry’s abdomen.
Draco shook his head again, pushing at Harry’s bare chest with one hand, his other arm still clutching his stuffed wolf.
”Do you imagine doing this to your beloved Healer, Draco?” Harry purred, shoving his length further into his mouth.
Harry cleared his throat, picking at his food with his fork. “I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t mean to overstep. It’s entirely up you, whatever you want to do.”
“N-not for you!” Draco shouted, pressing down in an attempt to impale himself even further on Harry’s fingers. “I-It’s just my heat, it’s always like this.”
Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth for a moment before answering. “P-Pansy,” he croaked, the name sounding foreign on his tongue.
“Go on, I’ll let myself out,” Pansy said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Just try to be civil, Draco. I know this all seems like it so much right now, but we’re all here for you.”
”I’m sure with a little care and grooming, he’ll be a fine pet. Come here, sweetheart,” Harry cooed, offering his fingers to smell.
“That’s not all, Mione,” Ron whispered, his eyes solemn. “When they questioned Harry at the Ministry, he confessed to…mistreating Draco.”
Harry strode across the room, quickly closing the distance between them. “You’re in pain…” he said softly, reaching up to gently tug one of Draco’s arms from his chest.
His rabbit shook his head, the water inside of the tub sloshing as he shifted, pressing his arse against Harry’s prick under the water. Harry hissed in a breath through his gritted teeth, rubbing his cock between the boy’s slippery cheeks.
Harry bobbed his head up and down on Draco’s prick, easily taking him to the hilt. With no warning, he sunk two of his thick fingers into Draco’s leaking hole, scissoring them apart, stretching him painfully wide.
Blaise laughed and gently slid Draco’s hat back onto his head. When the Blaise’s fingers lingered against the spot just under Draco’s ear, Harry clenched his jaw, a dark, possessive feeling boiling forth within him.
He tried to remain hopeful for his pup, but it was becoming increasingly difficult under Harry’s callous care.
After he had decided to show Harry the truth about Scorpius’ conception, he hadn’t been sleeping much. He had been worrying non-stop about Harry’s reaction to his secret memory. He had no doubt in his mind that Harry would hate him after viewing it.
Draco giggled, feeling the soft bed beneath his back as Harry gently laid him down. He turned to his side, seeing Scorpius sleeping soundly next to him.
Potter stepped into the enclosed stall and reached into the inner pocket of his jacket, pulling out a rolled cigarette. He produced a box of matchsticks next, taking one out and striking it against the heel of his posh boot to light it.
Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth, glancing down at his one-year-old son who was clumsily pawing at the neckline of his jumper and softly whining.
Harry let out a strangled growl, repeatedly slamming his cock into Draco’s hole, chasing his own release.
Pansy pulled away and smirked. “Yeah, I know. I’ll see you at the hospital tomorrow. I’ll bring you tea and scones for breakfast.”
Arlen shook his head, his eyes filled with remorse. “No. They transferred me to another floor after…well, you know.”
Question: do you want Draco to address Harry as Dada, Daddy, or Papa? Let me know, I’ll let you guys choose. 😏 For right now, I’ll use Dada.
It was true, what he had said. Hermione had always been an inherently good person. She didn’t feel resentment or anger against Draco as a person because it wasn’t who she was. She had always accepted others without judgement and that was one of the reasons Harry loved her as a friend.
Pansy knelt and began sweeping up the last of the eggs into her open palm, casting him a patient look.
Draco moved lower and nuzzled against Harry’s happy trail, nodding dazedly. “Mmm, yeah. It was just like before,” he murmured.
The intimate act made Draco’s knees weak, his pup kicking a fluttering limbo within his belly that matched his heartbeat.
Harry hadn't been down to the level of the Ministry since he'd retired. He'd forgotten how cold and bleak it was.
Harry looked like he wanted to say something but had decided against it, returning his attention to his food.
Scorpius was perched on Harry’s hip, watching his father in abject fascination as he stirred eggs around on a skillet with a spatula.
Harry’s hips stuttered and he came on the spot, his orgasm triggered by Draco’s confession and his sweet, sexy usage of the word
When Potter suddenly ripped down his trousers, exposing his backside to the cool air in the stable, his lips parted in shock.
Harry scooped Scorpius up and set him on his hip, grinning down at him. “We’re friends now, right, Scorpius?”
At the sound of Harry’s voice, Scorpius roused. He snuffled against Draco’s chest for a moment before realizing his nipple was no longer exposed.
Hermione snorted delicately. “That’s putting it lightly, but that’s not what we’re talking about, Harry. It’s been months and you’ve barely left your home except for work.”
Draco’s heart felt too full at that moment, his adoration for his Alpha spilling over and traveling throughout him. It warmed him from the inside, the Firewhisky he’d consumed only heightening the effect and making him ache for Harry.
Draco had sleepily turned his face towards Harry’s wet tongue, a small furrow appearing between the boy’s pale brows. When a contented sigh had escaped the boy’s parted lips, Harry had felt a swell of pride and arousal.
Guys, I’m so sorry for the late update. I only write new chapters for this fic when I’m in the right mood (depressed🥴) so I’m sorry again for the wait!
Draco could feel his ire rising higher each minute he was forced to be in the presence of his arrogant boyhood nemesis. Harry Potter didn’t know the first thing about him or what he’d gone through.
. He had wanted to tell Draco he wasn’t alone, his Alpha was there and he would protect him no matter the outcome, but—
He shifted on his feet, feeling silly for divulging his most secret thoughts to a barely sentient portrait of someone long gone.
Harry gently tweaked the soft tuft of the boy’s tail and grinned when the boy let out an indignant squeak.
Harry took a step towards them. “I didn’t mean it that way, Draco. I know you can take of yourself, I’m just worried. Leaving you and Scorpius alone—”
Harry carried the boy to his adjoining bathroom. He gently set the boy on his feet and began preparing the tub. Once the large porcelain tub had filled halfway with warm water, he stripped out of his formal clothes.
She parted some of the fern’s leaves with her hands, her heart-shaped face framed by green. It made the flecks of gold in her emerald eyes more apparent, the sunlight gleaming off of her long raven hair. The faint freckles that dotted her nose and cheeks were also made more discernible by the sunlight, like scattered constellations on her olive skin.
Although he had remained hopeful that Draco was just being shy about their relationship, his continued silence in regard to Scorpius’ father was something he didn’t want to push him on. When he had asked Harry to leave when he had tried to broach the subject of Scorpius’ father, Harry had reluctantly left.
Draco shook his head as much as he could with Harry holding him by his hair. “I-I’d never let you be the father of my babies. You’re a—“ he hiccuped softly, “m-monster.”
“Potter?” Roland arched one regal brow. “Odd to see you outside of the bowels of the Ministry like this.”
“Ow,” Harry groused in mock pain. “You’re hurting the werewolf, sweetie,” Harry said, chuckling softly when Scorpius immediately released his hair.
Truthfully, he didn’t have the proverbial green thumb that his mother had. Every plant he touched seemed to wilt and die within a few days, but he still persisted in trying to garden.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “She won’t notice if you’re gone for just a short while. It will be quick, and I’ll cover for you if she comes to check.”
When his lips brushed against the side of Harry’s throat, a soft whine escaped Draco. It was pure instincts controlling him now. He wanted to be held and cared for as an Omega should be by his Alpha.
Harry pulled back, sliding his mouth lower to lick and suck at Draco’s marked gland. Draco’s breath hitched when he felt Harry’s erection prodding between his arse, rubbing against his covered hole. He pressed down on the rigid length, earning a low growl from Harry.
“It’s right here, Mr. Potter. She was put on suicide watch a couple of times, so we had her moved to a cell closer to the guards’ station.”
“Come along now. I’ll show to your room and send Pansy up to go over the details of your assigned duties while you remain here.”
Harry stopped his ministration on his nipple. “Do you think that because you’re pregnant now, I won’t
”Tack,” Harry greeted coldly. “Odd to see you not slithering about the Ministry corridors behind Shacklebolt.”
Harry smirked. “Ha ha, your brilliant humor rivals your powers of perception, Mione,” he said wryly.
He lifted their joined hands and pulled Draco’s hand towards his lips, pressing a chaste kiss to one of his fingers that sent a jolt of heat straight to his heart and traveled throughout his whole body, warming him from within.
Unable to stop himself, Harry leaned down and pressed his nose to Draco’s soft hair, deeply inhaling. When that wasn’t enough, Harry lowered his head and stuck out his tongue, flattening it against Draco’s scent gland on his neck.
Roland’s eyes widened in what looked like horror before he gave a sharp nod. “Of course, Draco. I’ll wait for your return.”
He wanted to tell Draco to take them out and let him see. He wanted to see his perky tits, see those pretty, pink nipples again. He wanted to watch milk dribble from those swollen peaks, almost as if they were begging for Harry’s mouth.
Or maybe it was when he realized that Draco loved their pup unconditionally. Even if it was fathered by a man who was ceaselessly cruel to him.
“Naughty boy,” he hissed. “Attacking your Alpha and then attempting to escape me? There is no escape, Draco. You belong to
He knew that it was a risk, what with him being heavily pregnant, but he didn’t want to wait anymore. His mother would understand. He explained everything in the letter. This was the only way his pup could have a future. The only way that they
The boy was visibly trembling now. He slowly walked over to Harry, his small shoulders hunched. When he stopped in front of him, he wouldn’t look up to meet his eyes.
“But when I caught Harry bringing you and Scorpius home by Floo one evening, that only confirmed it for me.”
It was dark out now, the dregs of London’s magical community giving them insidious looks as they passed.
“Scorpius will probably be asleep for another hour,” Harry whispered against his lips. “Do you think we would have time to—"
When he could finally pull his eyes away from the scars on the right side of his face and over, Draco felt his chest tighten.
He followed them into the drawing room and watched as Draco adjusted his pup in his arms, reaching out with one hand. “My bag, please.”
“Let’s make a deal, then. If I can make you come on my cock, you’ll take back your hurtful words. I am your
Harry scoffed, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re still the same. You haven’t changed at all. Still under Daddy’s thumb. Born into money and
Scorpius was sprawled out on Harry's chest, his thumb wedged firmly in his mouth, sucking on it as he slept. A puddle of dribble had accrued on the front of Harry’s sage green button-down from the corner of Scorpius’ mouth, but Harry didn’t seem to care in the slightest.
He paused, placing his free hand on the top of his stomach, sliding it down slowly over his covered belly.
Harry narrowed his eyes and reached down, wrapping his fingers around Draco’s upper arm and tugging. “Straddle me.”
Draco suddenly remembered the promise he had made to himself all those years ago while he’d been standing in front of Sirius’ portrait.
if you want me or not? Do not mistake this for anything other than it is, Draco. You are nothing but a carrier for any children I want. Do not insult me,” he scoffed, “
After he had been shown to his room, he had to grit his teeth from saying anything that would be untoward.
The boy rolled to his back on the bed, his pert nose wrinkling. The dress shirt had ridden up his thighs, almost revealing the tip of his cock.
He lifted his hand and swiped at his cheeks with two fingers, holding them up in front of him. They glistened with wetness—not his own.
His eyes were light green, the same color as the vines that wrapped around the iron gates of his mother’s garden at Malfoy Manor.
“They’re from his birthday party,” Draco said softly, protectively hugging himself. “My Dad kind of went overboard with the balloons at his party.”
Draco scowled and watched as Harry stepped towards the Floo. His traitorous body was already craving another dose Harry’s pheromones, his nipples and groin aching with hot need that only an alpha could soothe.
He would wait until Harry was asleep. It seemed like the only time his Alpha’s guard was down. If he could just make it down the stairs, he could use his long-dormant magic, he could—
“Even with your husband gone, even being pregnant, you’re still—” Harry scoffed and shook his head, looking off to the side.
While this woman had 16 years to do as she pleased, his most closest friends and family laid dead and buried. They hadn’t been given such time as Narcissa had taken.
“I’m not a whore,” he snapped. “But you are obviously in need of one to stoop to seducing someone such as me with a lowly
“You weren’t acting so shy in front of that fucking Healer today,” he hissed, tipping up Draco’s chin with the fingers of his other hand.
Harry shrugged and released his arms. “Then get off of me. It makes no difference to me. I’ll leave you to wail and cry in this room, craving my touch and regretting your stubborn attitude.”
Harry glanced up from the Prophet, his eyes connecting with Ginny’s. She had moved back to the stove and he hadn’t even noticed.  “Sorry, Gin. Did you say something?”
. When I’m away from you two, all I do is worry. I should have respected your wish for me to stay away, but I couldn’t. For that, I’m sorry.” He smiled, his green gaze intense. “But I won’t apologize for how I feel about you. I realized last night that it’s not my instincts that are drawing me to you, it’s
Perhaps a subtle stiffening of his shoulders or looks that were weighed down with much more than she was able to decipher.
He pulled up his feet, spreading his thighs wide so that his Alpha could see how wet and ready he was. Even though his instincts were controlling most of his actions now, his face suffused with heat under Harry’s intense gaze.
His daughter nodded. “I put it on the kitchen table. Can I go to my room for a bit and read my comics?”
you. Anything I want to do to your body is within my right as your Alpha. There will be no one else for you, only me.”
“You shouldn’t listen to him, Draco. You’re nothing like him. You’re a wonderful mother and a good person.”
His eyes traveled down, stopping on their nursing pup. For a brief moment, Harry’s eyes lost their cruel glint, his shields coming down. All of his emotions were suddenly there, clear and heart-wrenching.
Scorpius began wriggling in his arms, showings signs of wanting to feed. “No plans of marriage?” Draco pressed, instantaneously regretting such a blunt question.
He looked up, his gaze catching on a booth across the street. It looked to be a game of Fairy Lights. He could remember playing it back when he had been going to Hogwarts as a student.
Harry suddenly squeezed his breast, making Draco gasp. “I don’t want you to fucking mention him again. Especially when I’m touching you.”
Pansy stepped forward and gathered Draco into her arms, nodding furiously. “I’ll see to it, Master Potter. I won’t let him out of my sight. Thank you.”
He felt sympathy for the timid creature in the cage, uncomfortable imagining him being sold as food for a carnivore.
“Okay,” Draco mumbled, averting Harry’s eyes to hide how needy he felt. “He’s still sleeping with me at night. I don’t breastfeed him as much now. He seems to be doing okay with it.”
Draco nodded while adjusting Scorpius on his lap. “Yes, he prefers breast milk, but now that he’s getting older, I thought it would be best to try to wean. I don’t
The man set down the papers on his desk and made a clicking sound with his tongue. Draco held completely still, not sure how to react.
The Healer was doing his examination in the drawing room of Harry’s home. Harry stood next to the sofa, watching him with an inscrutable gaze.
Ron sighed. “He said that Draco’s pregnancy was…forced. He admitted that it was rape, Mione. Apparently, he took Draco on as a mate because he wanted revenge for what Draco’s parents participated in during the war.”
, Harry! Don’t you understand?” Draco angrily swiped at his tears with the back of his hand, still holding a now sleeping Scorpius close with his other hand. “I’m done talking. I’m grateful for what you’ve done for us, but please, leave now.”
Harry backed him up against the side of one shop, placing his palms flat on either side of his head, bracketing him in.
“My mother named me,” he murmured, feeling his cheeks warm again under the man’s scrutiny. “And I’m not a
, not getting useless revenge. The French Ministry warned me against allowing you to use your magic inappropriately again until you go to school. Once you’re there, you’ll learn how to control and hone it.”
The door to the exam room suddenly opened and Harry walked in, coming to an abrupt halt. His eyes immediately zeroed in on Arlen’s hand pressed against Draco’s bare stomach.
with him. He kept messing things up and he didn’t know how to stop. Couldn’t he just make one decision for himself that didn’t result in one of his father’s disapproving gazes?
“I’m just worried about you, mate,” Blaise said softly, adjusting the scarf around Draco’s neck with long, nimble fingers.
He knew Harry wasn’t comfortable keeping up the charade for his parents, but he did it for Draco’s sake. Even though Harry was eager to become a permanent part of Scorpius’ life, he wouldn’t push Draco about the issue of telling his parents the truth.
Harry began fingering him, adding one, then another finger, until the boy was speared with four of his pistoning fingers. He lowered his head and sucked one of Draco’s wet nipples into his mouth, drinking the boy’s sweet breast milk as he finger-fucked him.
The Auror straightened, his cheeks flushing. “Auror Thorne, Mr. Potter. It’s an honor to finally meet you.”
His black-clawed fingertips pressed into the boy’s pale skin, red marks blossoming underneath them. It was obscenely erotic to Harry and obscenely
He had owned a stuffed rabbit as a pup that he had christened ‘Nibbles’. Perhaps that’s what she meant? But he had certainly never done anything sexual with it…
Draco shook his head, droplets of water falling from his damp hair with the motion. “Please don’t hurt him, Harry. It was nothing,
Draco tried to look up, but the hand around his mouth tightened. He could scent that the man was an Alpha.
that it would have alerted Hermione to anything out of the ordinary when it came to Draco and their visits over the past few months.
Harry looked younger. His black hair was shaggy and there weren’t any lines creasing the skin next to his eyes. He also had glasses on in the photo, something he no longer wore. What surprised Draco most was the smile turning up Harry’s lips.
Harry felt a growl trying to claw its way up his throat, his hands tightening into fists against his thighs.
Never in his life had he been aroused by breastfeeding, but when he had seen Draco’s dripping nipple, he had to inwardly fight his Alpha instincts that suddenly came roaring to the surface.
him, rutting him deep and soothing the burning hurt wouldn’t abate without his Alpha’s cock to fuck it out of him.
Draco suddenly yanked his and Harry’s fingers from his hole and lurched out of his lap. He staggered forward before whipping around, his legs trembling. “W-who are you? Where am I?” he asked shakily.
Harry knew it was about building trust, but trust between a carnivore and herbivore was laughable to some.
Harry didn’t concern himself with Wizarding politics anymore since he had retired from the Ministry, but it was entertaining to watch Kingsley fall from favor.
His eyes followed the long, white rabbit ears resting against his chest that were attached to a shock of blond hair, the same pale shade as his ears. The angelic face under that blond hair made Harry’s breath catch.
They had been picked out by his daughter. He’d told her he was going to visit a sick friend in the hospital, and she’d insisted on him bringing flowers to the person.
Harry’s question took Draco by surprise. He set his fork down and glanced up, meeting Harry’s hopeful gaze.
Hermione reached across the table, gently placing her hand on his forearm. “Oh, I haven’t overstepped, have I, Draco?”
Scorpius huffed indignantly and pursed his lips, recoiling from the bite of applesauce Draco was currently trying to coax him to eat.
He pulled back, his mouth surely glistening with the boy’s slick. “Touch yourself sweetheart. Wrap your hand around yourself, let Dada see how you touch yourself.”
Draco’s hand was frozen on his stomach, his eyes widening slightly as he waited for Harry to finish his thought.
His heats had always been unbearably intense, so his mother had gone through the trouble of acquiring strong suppressants and home-made potions to get him through the worst of it.
“Well,” his mum finally said, “I deduced that you two were getting serious when you kept disappearing for days on end. Not to mention, the day Harry suddenly showed up at the manor out of the blue. I knew something was going on then.”
A light breeze swept past, making him smile. It cooled the nape of his neck and rustled his sweat-dampened hair. He had cut it short a couple of years back, making it much easier to manage with his busy lifestyle.
Harry placed one of his large hands on Draco’s hip, pulling him closer. He rucked up the hem of Draco’s borrowed shirt, sliding his hand up his flank and ribs until his fingers rested just below his breast.
Harry crushed his mouth to Draco’s, ignoring his futile attempts to push away from him with his hands. Draco’s tears flavored their kiss, a familiar, sickening arousal flaring to life within him when Harry’s tongue met his.
“Hermione,” he whispered, placing a comforting hand on her forearm. “Harry aided in Narcissa’s Malfoy’s escape yesterday. She’s gone.”
Harry stepped back, his back hitting the hard wall. He slid down to a sitting position. He knew that the Ministry would flood the prison with Aurors when they discovered Narcissa missing.
With an aching snap, Harry erected his shields again, denying Draco the pleasure of their mating bond.
Harry pulled away from their kiss, his hips stuttering before halting their assault as he shuddered and came, shooting his load deep inside of Draco.
“Let me,” he said, stepping toward him until they were uncomfortably close again. Harry pulled his wand from a hidden pocket in his jacket and aimed it at Draco’s clothes.
Draco’s long ears were revealed, his velvet fur dampened by perspiration. His blond hair was in disarray, several strands sticking to the side of his plush lips.
Deep down, he was repressing the overwhelming urge to lurch out of that fucking chair and back to Draco.
He angled his thrusts, knowing when he was hitting the boy’s prostate by how loudly he began to moan and writhe beneath him.
Draco found himself unwittingly leaning into the touch, starved for any scrap of affection from his Alpha.
He had hidden the love bites from Draco on his neck with a complexion charm. For some reason, that disappointed Draco.
“I was thinking that after we eat with Ron and Hermione and the kids, we could go back to your place. We could pick up a bottle of wine and just…talk. Nothing serious.”
“My job,” Harry replied icily. “No matter how much you try to run away from me, it won’t change the fact that I’ve been assigned to
, a person who was wholly innocent in all of this would be caught in the middle of some scandal because he wasn’t strong enough to set boundaries when it came to Harry Potter.
The Healer from St Mungo’s was a young man named Arlen. He had dark hair and warm brown eyes. Draco felt an intense urge to break down and tell the nice man everything Harry had been subjecting him to.
protection until his husband is found. Working directly under the Minister, I’m sure he already made you aware of that.”
“Draco, it’s time for us to go home. You haven’t ate since breakfast. Thank you for all you’ve done today, Arlen.”
The boy had eaten the kibble Harry had given him with no qualms. He felt bad that the boy had to have a meal fit for an animal, but it was all he had for the night.
Draco let out a defeated hiccup of frustration, quickly swiping at the tear that slid down his cheek.
. You’re respected in the Wizarding community and you have a good career at the Ministry. You don’t want some unmated eighteen-year-old dropout with a pup messing things up. You don’t
Harry sat next to Draco, making sure there was a sufficient amount of space between them that would be deemed appropriate. He tucked his notepad away and faced him.
Arlen chuckled, his brown eyes warm. “My mate said the same thing when he was pregnant with our daughter. Impatient to make their entrance into the world, hmm?”
Juniper had had difficulty latching when she was a newborn and Theo’s tongue had been the only thing able to soothe his pain after breastfeeding.
He could remember when Draco had first came to his office with their pup, crying and seeking his protection. Even then, he’d unconsciously
"She won't be angry with you, Draco,” Harry said firmly. “Narcissa will understand why you chose not to tell her the truth. And keep in mind that I'm here with you. I'd never let anyone hurt you, not even your own family."
Refusing to quit breastfeeding, his insistence on wanting to take care of Scorpius on his own, and now suffering through his heat without any magical or pharmaceutical alleviation.
“What?” Harry asked, smirking. “Did you think I spent my free time like Vlad the Impaler, staking the heads of petulant Omegas in the ground in front of my home?”
His mother had made him promise not to reveal his true identity to any of the staff or the manor’s master.
Draco came awake suddenly, expecting to feel the aches and pains that always clung to him after his intense heats. Usually after his heats—especially after having Scorpius—he would wake up feeling as if he’d been hit with the Crutiatus Curse.
Harry sat in his office at the Ministry, staring blankly at the unreviewed case files in front of him. When he heard his name, he glanced up.
He suddenly didn’t give a fuck if anyone walked in on them. There was no turning back for him now. All he wanted was his Omega. All he wanted was
Harry propped his shoulder against the doorway and crossed his arms over his chest. “Standard procedure. I’m sorry we had to inconvenience you, Narcissa.”
Harry knew the boy’s body was reacting to him, trying to lure him in using its own naturally made defense mechanism against Alphas: seduction.
Warm fingers brushed against the nape of his neck, making shivers break out over his over-heated skin.
The skin around his wrists was now irritated and hurting, but he’d been given no reprieve from them even after he’d begged Kreacher to loosen the knots.
Draco glanced at Harry, noting his rigid posture and clenched hands. Even though he was scared, he knew Harry wouldn’t hurt him. He was his Omega, and an Alpha was instinctually wired to treat their Omega with care.
When his openness was met by an impenetrable wall that blocked their bond off from one another, Draco sighed in frustration.
His father had gotten a flat somewhere in Muggle London, choosing to live on his own for awhile. He didn’t say it, but Draco knew his father had been disappointed in him for becoming pregnant so young. Even though he silently supported him, he knew that Lucius didn’t approve of him being a single parent.
"Child of..." Harry cast him a dubious look. "Narcissa had no children when she fled after the war. At least not any documented. I would know."
“Not as valued as your husband. He has his own plaque hanging up in the Auror Department, commendation and picture included.”
He shifted Scorpius on his hip and looked up Harry shyly. “You could have woken me up, Harry. I could have helped you make breakfast.”
Harry seemed to lose himself while Draco sucked in bliss, the shields he had been holding strong against their bond coming down and allowing him to feel the brunt of Harry’s hidden feelings.
The boy would need a bath, but with his aversion to water, he didn’t know how he would get him in the tub.
Draco shrugged. “I’m sorry, Blaise. My mind just wandered for a moment thinking about how Scorpius was doing without me.”
“Harry, you’ve been chain smoking and I’m pretty sure you’ve been wearing the same shirt for the past week. You’re my best friend and I can tell when something is troubling you.”
Draco knew Harry was hurt because of his dishonesty. By attending his dinner tonight, he was making an effort to move forward. If Harry wanted Scorpius to be a part of his life, Draco would support that.
Harry reached into the pocket of his black blazer and retrieved a slim collar. He clamped it around Draco’s slender neck, giving it a experimental tug from behind.
His magic flared because of his fear and arousal, making the collar around his throat almost unbearably hot against his skin.
Pansy grinned, her long black ears erect with delight, the torn one drooping slightly lower assumedly from cartilage damage.
Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s nape. “Tell me again in the morning. Tell me you want me, that you want
For good measure, he let some of the waning stream splatter against Draco’s thighs, ensuring his scent and proprietary claim. Draco moaned softly when the hot liquid hit his bare skin, pulling his stuffed wolf back against his chest.
When he realized what he had said, he froze. He glanced up at Harry from under his lashes, his cheeks hot with embarrassment.
His dark hair was wet, errant droplets sliding down from his temples and curving over his sharp cheekbones.
The years had been kind to her. When she smiled back, the skin next to her eyes creased, but her heart-shaped face looked unchanged from when they had first met. The warm sunlight highlighted one or two threads of silver in her chestnut curls, her brown eyes lightened to an almost whiskey color.
mate, after all. I would protect him with my life, and if we’re lucky, he’ll be with child within the next few months.”
After removing his jacket and hanging it in the closet, a sharp knock was the only warning he had before a small girl came barreling in.
After a few moments, he let his tongue trail lower, licking the rabbit’s spine and then back up to his face.
Harry shook his head and picked up the papers he was reading. “You’re joining the Alpha Interim Program?”
Harry had instructed him to conceal the collar and not to mention it to the Healer who was visiting today.
Draco shivered, not liking the strange man’s lips against his ear. It didn’t feel like when his dada touched him. It felt…
all Draco ever wanted. He wanted them to finally be a family—a proper family. If that meant he had to spill his heavily guarded emotions, he would. He would give in.
Harry stood, yanking Draco up with him by his wrist. He grabbed his other wrist, pulling him close until his belly was pressed uncomfortably tight between them.
Harry gestured to the small sofa in the back of his office that he sometimes used to sleep on when he wasn’t able to get away from work. Draco nodded and sat on the sofa, still clutching Scorpius to his chest. Harry sat down next to him, his heart leaping when his knee brushed against Draco’s on accident.
The scent of the boy’s slick and pheromones only ramped up his own instincts, his clawed hand gripping one of the boy’s thighs and hitching it higher, splaying him underneath Harry.
His hat was once again slipped off of his head, Harry’s long fingers burrowing into his hair as they kissed, pulling him closer. When Harry began tugging Draco’s coat down from his shoulders with his other hand, he pulled away.
Draco peeked around his dada’s shoulder, seeing that the strange carnivores had already lost interest in him and were uncorking a bottle of wine. He pulled back to look up into his dada’s eyes, letting out a soft whine.
Draco flushed and twisted his fingers into Harry’s black button-down, his legs trembling. Disgust and shame washed over him in hot, heavy mortifying waves.
Harry clenched his jaw and inhaled slowly through his nostrils in an attempt to quell the incessant questions that seemed to be stuck on a loop within his mind.
”Do you not understand your position here, Omega?” He shook Draco, pulling him closer. “You belong to me. I
He dropped his cigarette to the snow and stepped on it, digging his heel in with more force than necessary to put it out. Muttering a charm to make the cigarette disappear, he made his way across the street.
Before Harry pulled back, he traced the seam of Draco’s lips with his tongue, collecting their shared saliva from their wet kiss.
Every time he was cruel to Draco, it was going against his nature as an Alpha. He was meant to protect and adore his Omega, not abuse and berate him. The only times he could get his mind to quiet was when he was
For real, sorry for taking so long to update this fic. I know many of you have been waiting patiently for me to update and I am sincerely grateful for all my readers and their amazing patience. 🖤
“My mother is a good person! You don’t know her like I do. She’s all I have, and you took me away from her!”
“The young man with the dark hair and eyes. Upstairs, in the child’s bedroom. There was dust covering everything. His portrait was covered, too.”
He regretted his words as soon as they left his lips, seeing the way something shattered in Harry’s green eyes. He composed his face before Draco could apologize, a barrier seeming to slide down between them.
He realized that Harry hadn’t knotted him. He was glad because he didn’t know if he could stand to be connected to him longer than necessary. Reality suddenly came crashing down with that thought, Harry’s cum slowly leaking out of Draco, mixing with his slick and coating the sheets beneath his hips.
Draco cast a panicked look up Harry. Harry was glaring at the closed stall door, his lip pulling back in a sneer.
Harry took a shuddering breath. “Draco, I’m—I’m sorry for how I reacted that day in your home. I shouldn’t have treated you that way. I let my anger take over. I could never hurt you...”
Arlen nodded, putting his wand back in his bag. “That’s a common early pregnancy symptom. I recommend you spend time with your Alpha for the next few weeks. Physical contact with your Alpha can strengthen your pup in the womb.”
Draco shook his head, averting Harry’s gaze. “It’s all right. I’m trying to wean him and he just feeds for comfort rather than hunger. It’s hard on both of us...” he trailed off, realizing that he was babbling.
Draco ignored him, walking over to sit on the edge of the bed. “Just go away, Harry. I’m not in the mood for your capricious moods. I don’t feel well.”
Their faces were mere centimeters apart. He glared up at him, pure hatred burning in his chest for the man looming over him.
He yearned for Harry to give him another chance. He could make things right if given the opportunity.  If he had to spend the rest of his life trying to make it up to Harry, he would.
Without speaking, he took out his wand and cast a barrier spell in front of her cell door. He aimed his wand at her manacles, and one by one, he unlocked them.
Draco sat up, his desire quickly evaporating under Harry’s callous treatment. “Good. Maybe he’ll catch on to what an abusive prick you are,” he murmured.
spot deep inside of him. “Are you sure? Look how loose you’re becoming, so stretched and hot around me.”
Harry slowly slid the bag off of his shoulder and walked over to Draco, handing it to him. He dithered for a moment, searching his mind for any possible excuse to convince them to stay.
within Harry. In any other person, he would have called it guilt, but he discarded that notion as soon as it dissipated.
, Draco. My cock reacted to your desperate little Omega pheromones. I’ve been fucking hard all day, wanting to sink my prick into that wet, sugary smelling hole.”
He smiled fondly at her, watching the blonde halo of her curls fall around her round face as she tilted her head. Her blue eyes were narrowed in concentration, her small tongue poking out of her mouth as she smashed her potatoes into further mush.
,” Harry groaned, placing both of his hands on Draco’s hips to gently tug him forward. Harry’s alpha pheromones enveloped him, an obvious attempt to soothe him.
It was hard to repress his instincts, seeing his Omega around another Alpha. Even though he knew Draco only desired him, their bond was still new, and Harry wouldn’t be able to calm his inner Alpha until he was able to claim Draco again.
“I saw it while I was cleaning up.” Harry cleared his throat and set the papers in a neat pile on Draco’s antique coffee table between them. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have looked.”
The rabbit’s tiny snores and warm breath gusting his skin as he slumbered, had made Harry felt possessive satisfaction.
Blaise put his hands on his hips, casting him a tired look. “You know he’s safe at home with Narcissa, Draco. I wanted to take you to the festival for you to have fun, not worry about Scorpius who is currently being spoiled
Harry gave one brutal thrust, angling his hips to ram against the boy’s prostate. Draco keened with delight and came, spraying hot jets of cum against the sheets beneath him.
He nudged at the rabbit with nose after finishing cleaning his top, wanting to get to his lower half.
The flash of hurt in Ginny’s brown eyes was quickly shuttered, her lips turning up in a defeated smile.
Harry turned off the oven and began rummaging around one of the kitchen cabinets. “She’s a sports editor for the Daily Prophet.”
“Um, if you’ll excuse me, Roland. My pup is becoming impatient.” He gave the man a sheepish smile and pointed to his stomach. “Be right back.”
Had he even brushed his hair that morning? He couldn’t remember. He had been so busy looking for Juni’s other shoe.
Draco shook his head, reaching up with one hand and digging his nails into Harry’s arm. “I don’t care. I don’t want you anywhere near us!”
Draco cut him off by reaching down between them and clumsily trying to undo his belt. When he was successful at that, he unzipped the front of his trousers and yanked down the front of Harry’s briefs, his erection springing out, the flushed head of his cock already leaking pre-cum.
The scent led him to a door at the far end of the corridor to left. He used his magic to unlock the door, turning the handle and entering.
Draco warily eyed the dildo before picking it up with his newly freed hand. His fingers couldn’t even fully wrap around it, the girth too large for his small hand.
“You don’t have to explain anything to me, Draco. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. You can nurse him here, if you like. I promise, I don’t mind.”
Draco quickly got to his feet and tried to leave the room, but was stopped when Harry grabbed his upper arm, pulling him back against his hard chest.
Without any preamble, Harry lowered his head and sank his teeth into Draco’s scent gland on his neck.
Even though he didn’t want to admit it, he was beginning to remember things from his time during his heat. It was just little flashes, brought on by simply touching something or smelling a certain scent.
Harry smirked, his fangs aching in his mouth due to proximity and smell of the vulnerable rabbit. The predator within him sensed its natural prey.
His prick had been hard since his heat had started. The amount of pre-cum that had leaked from his slit and covered his cock had pooled at the base of his shaft, sliding down his bollocks and mixing with the warm slick coating his hole and inner thighs.
He wanted them to move in with him so they could be a true family. It felt wrong that his mate and pup left him each morning. He wanted them in his home, where he could provide for them always.
Harry pulled him closer and shook his head. “No, we’re not, Draco. We’re just here as friends. I promise.”
Harry thought he had known happiness in its purest form at certain points in his life, but nothing compared to
His thighs were still submissively spread, his prick hard and soaked with pre-cum. His pink nipples were stiff, standing out against his fair skin. The rim of opening looked stretched, irritated and drenched with slick.
Harry turned with Scorpius and grinned. “Good morning, sweetheart. We were just about done making breakfast for you.”
“I joined because I want a family of my own one day. Having experience with providing my magic and pheromones will come in handy when I finally meet my true mate.”
before I give you what you want.” Harry let his thumb glide over Draco’s lower lip in a taunting caress. “Only I can give you what your body craves and your stomach will eventually swell with the child only
“Touch yourself, baby,” Harry grunted, his hands busy keeping Draco spread open and to give himself leverage while delivering punishing, precise jabs to Draco’s prostate.
He met Harry’s eyes and reluctantly murmured, ”Thank you for, um, cleaning up. You didn’t have to do that.”
One of his best friends, Hermione, had been urging him to finally settle down. She had married his other best friend, Ron, and already had two pups of their own.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, his vision swimming with tears. “You’re being so cruel to me, Harry. I know that you know how much I need you. You’re our
Hermione had attributed his stoic behavior to growing older, she had never questioned if something was truly bothering him. The war had affected all of them and Hermione had thought that maybe Harry just wanted to lay the past to rest. She never would have thought that he still harbored such ill will towards the Malfoy family.
The right side of the shop must have been the ‘oddities’ section. It had mahogany shelves filled with phials, cursed baubles, and several intricate looking contraptions.
Harry effortlessly deflected the candleholder using his magic and lunged after Draco. He tackled the boy to the ground from behind, grabbing a handful of his blond hair and jerking back his head.
.” Harry released one of his wrists and flicked his fingers, the envelope he had given Hermione appearing between them.
He lifted his hand and sifted through Draco’s sweat-dampened hair with his fingers, smiling as the boy purred contentedly under his touch.
Several moments later, Harry Potter stalked into their kitchen. His face was wiped of all emotion, his usual lambent green eyes, cold.
He had written several bestsellers about his experience during the war and as an Auror for the Ministry. His books had been sold worldwide, and he often traveled to different countries to hold seminars and give speeches at different Wizarding schools throughout the globe.
His heart contracted painfully, flinching inwardly. “What do you mean?” he asked, a little too sharply.
“Why?” Harry asked, his voice achingly absent of any emotion that had been freely shared between them last night.
When Draco pulled back, he could only stare in awe as Draco shucked off his shirt, baring his perfect tits. They were smaller now due to not producing as much milk for their pup, but still
Draco made a sudden dash for the open door of the stall, letting out a small cry when Potter grabbed him by the back of his shirt.
The clever witch smiled brightly at him. “Where is Draco at anyway? I wanted to meet him. If he’s to be your mate, I’d love to speak with him. I could help him through any questions he has about pregnancy or whatnot. I’m sure he’s feeling awfully out of place here and we should try to help get more comfortable.”
Harry tentatively raised his hand and began scratching at the base of one of the boy’s long ears, knowing how he loved it.
He felt excess slick gush out of his pulsating hole around Harry’s pistoning fingers, his channel sucking those thick digits even deeper and earning a low growl from Harry that reverberated around Draco’s cock.
It was unnerving that Arlen probably knew all the humiliating details of his captivity and what was done to him. He knew that Arlen himself had been questioned by the Ministry due to his care of Draco while he’d been pregnant.
