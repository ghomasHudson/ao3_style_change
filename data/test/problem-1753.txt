“What a guy.”
“I heard about Sirius,” Fenrir continued. “I’m very sorry. He was a good man.”
“It’s not that. It’s just—he looks a little like me post-Azkaban. It threw me off.”
“Today I just want to do that,” he tried, hoping they would respect his wishes.
“Not that I’m aware of, but he is still trying to make choices for you. Just like he cannot decide for you, you cannot make choices for Draco, even if you want to avoid his suffering.”
That grabbed everyone’s attention. “How can you be sure?” Remus asked cautiously.
“Nah, that’s alright. I was just curious.”
. “I need something stronger for this conversation, sorry. Why is there a lock on the liquor cabinet: oh right.”
“How could I not with how incredibly loud he’s speaking,” Draco commented, bending his head over his desk as he wrote.
Draco huffed out a strangled laugh. “It sounds like a ridiculous and overly therapeutic thing to do.”
“What are you doing out of bed, Draco?” he asked.
Ron lifted a hand in defense. “Regardless. You’ve been there for him all summer and even though it makes little to no sense to me as to why he’d fall for someone who tormented him for years—even during said tormenting—you’re obviously who he needs to be around right now.”
When the moment finally passed and they had settled into Draco’s room (why they didn’t leave him and go to Harry’s, Draco would never know), Hermione was brave enough to ask Harry why he was still bandaged. Draco had been wondering the same thing. It had been a few weeks; he should be healed by now.
Draco looked down. “Do you think that’s a good idea?”
Ron stood. “Sure, Malfoy.” As he headed to the door, he stopped. “By the way, Hermione said you apologized to her.”
Harry flushed. “Do you think his dad…”
“Don’t you mean had?” he asked. “Kind of not alive, are you,” Harry continued uncomfortably.
“To get into Healer’s Training. You need to earn O’s in Potions, Arithmancy, and Charms, at least an E in Transfiguration and Runes, and Defense couldn’t hurt given our current political climate and knowing who your partner is.”
Severus softened at the name. “He was telling me off about you and it got out of control.”
Draco placed his mug next to him, drawing his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them, resting his head atop his knees. He kept his eyes trained towards the fire rather than making eye contact with the elder Black. “I’m just so angry at him. Not so much as a goodbye was given. It’s so frustrating.”
The malaise was palpable. “Where do you keep getting those?”
“Not even Hogwarts?”
“Okay. I can come by tomorrow for a session and we can talk some mental health potions?”
Everyone was already so busy with Order meetings around the clock, scheduling funerals, trials, memorial events, rebuilding the castle, that Harry couldn’t bring himself to let anyone know he was having a rough time.
“No, Harry,” Remus said. “I believe this is your true inheritance coming through. It would seem that some sort of glamours broke down when you came into your full power.”
“Are you really going to make me say it?”
Harry looked out the window to see rolling hills and a bit of the sea. “Glasgow?” he guessed.
Sirius stood, helping him to an armchair. Remus smiled at him gratefully. “Heard the ruckus?” Sirius asked.
Harry was finally free of the dark magic remnants and he felt so exhilaratingly liberated it astounded him. His magic was stronger and more controlled and he didn’t feel the dark shadow as strongly over him. He didn’t know how heavily dark magic could lay on someone; he wasn’t aware of how much it could alter one’s disposition. No wonder Snape was always such a bully, even if that didn’t excuse him.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Sure. Harry’s not going to fight Blaise or anything.”
“But I have my mother’s eyes. I have Lily’s eyes – everyone tells me that!” Harry was becoming more and more upset by the minute.
Harry took Draco’s hand in his instead of letting it reach his sore arm. “You did brilliant, Draco. It did close for quite awhile, but it reopened when we got here. I’m just really stupid for doing this in the first place. I’m glad you saved me.”
“You’re having visions at night again?”
Remus looked at Draco in realization. “I think you’re on to something. I’m going to have to check if there are any journals left behind. For now, though, we have to carry on.”
“What was he talking about Harry being off limits?” Hermione asked.
Draco nodded curtly, looking at the ground. “We can’t do it though, not without Bill’s help and he’s at Shell Cottage with Fleur. The vampire genes will attack me again, I’m sure of it.”
Maybe it was the pain potion talking, but Draco couldn’t keep his feelings in any longer; Harry’s sad eyes were too much to bear. “I couldn’t bloody let you stay like that, could I? I love you, you dolt.”
He was sure it was obvious.
“I’ll tell you some other time.”
The moon shone brightly on him as he went as far as he could into the Garden to feel as though he were in the thick of it. He didn’t call on anyone and he hoped they weren’t watching. The Garden of Souls should welcome this, shouldn’t it? He was feeding it new life. He wasn’t going to make a fuss.
James held steady. “He’s okay. It’s fine.”
Draco directed him to the fireplace, finagling with his wand and walking stick at the same time, almost tripping. Harry grabbed his elbow in time, though. Draco smiled at him sheepishly. “Thanks,” he said. “You ready for this?”
Draco hugged him back. “I didn’t think you’d be dumb enough to stay in the UK.”
Thanks for reading :)
That night, Harry found himself in the headmaster’s office. He stared around at all of the trinkets, remembering the first time he was in there after defeating Voldemort in First Year. It was odd being here now, with less than cordial feelings towards Albus Dumbledore as of late. Nevertheless, he was interested in what the headmaster had to say, and he wanted some answers himself. He’d have to keep himself together if he was to get anywhere with his professor.
“Blaise Zabini is downstairs, did you know?” she asked.
Sirius nodded in understanding. “I think the dampner doesn’t help with that.”
“I really don’t know much about you. It would help.”
Draco folded the parchment and tucked it in his desk drawer. “Nothing to worry about. Maybe there’s a foreign Patronus that will take you to see the Loch Ness Monster.”
Harry stepped in. The bun was still in place—he wondered if Sirius refused to cut it for him. “It’s your house, too.” He glanced at the parchment. “What’s that?”
Harry met his smile with his own, thinking back to that fatherly embrace. “It was amazing. And I get to see him whenever I want now. Finally a bit of luck.”
Draco looked down at the article in question. “
Harry grimaced. “I’m not, I just need a minute. I’ll be there, we’ve got 15 minutes.”
“I’m not willing to fight for a monster, sir. And if I continue to stay in my home I may have no choice,” the Malfoy heir explained. “I cannot possibly go back home this summer and face him; my father has obviously failed him in some way and I know I will get a death sentence in return. If I don’t have asylum, I’m dead either way. I’m not a fighter, sir, and I am not a monster.” Draco’s cheeks heated. He didn’t mean to say all of those things, but the words just tumbled out.
is a horcrux? You’re kidding,” Draco said.
Sirius frowned at him. “That’s different—we lived in Grimmauld most of the year. It can’t do that.”
The days filled with near unbearable classes coupled with the whispers and stares surrounding him at all times has caused his nights to be reserved for scrounging for alcohol, potions, or other vices that would allow him to forget himself for awhile. He’d wake impossibly hungover and irritable, taking way too long in the showers, and was generally late to breakfast if he showed up at all.
“Of course not!” Harry exclaimed. “Ron, you’re my best friend. I’ve just been having a really hard time.”
Remus nodded. “We all have one now. So, if you do need to talk someone or if you’re bored out of your skull here, you can just say one of our names into the mirror and we can talk to you, Harry included.”
They all shifted uncomfortably at that.
“Me too. Thanks for coming to check in.” Draco couldn’t believe his luck. He was going to live after all. Maybe having two creatures be a part of him wasn’t all bad.
Draco woke up the next morning in his bed and immediately felt ill. Sweat was pouring from his body and he wasn’t sure where he was. He tried to lift his arm to check the time and was met with excruciating pain. He cried out loudly. What had happened to him? He chanced a glance at his arm and saw that it was heavily bandaged from his bicep to a little over the crook of his elbow but blood was oozing through. The night came rushing back to him, causing him to lean over and empty the contents of his stomach on the hardwood floor.
Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty thinking about Regulus lying in wait for the rest of his family to join him. He’ll be waiting for centuries at this rate. “I think I’m in shock—I feel numb.”
Sirius looked up at Draco and grinned a Harry grin, blue eyes bright and alive. “I know,” he said. “Isn’t it odd?”
Remus’s lips formed a thin line. “I’m sure Dumbledore did.”
“It’s not my fault you’re so enthralled with your own visage. Why don’t you just marry yourself?” Harry plopped down on his bed, propping open his beaten up copy of the Odyssey.
“You’ve met Hermione Granger, right? Brightest witch of her age? Has Muggle parents? I don’t think ‘mixing’ is diluting the magic stream.”
Remus rounded on the bespectacled teen. “I don’t understand why you are always looking for trouble. There is a madman out to get you and you just casually stroll out the door like it’s nothing at all?”
Draco sat next to him, gently pulling Harry’s hands away from his face, not letting go of the one nearest his as he got settled. Harry flushed but didn’t let go. “To be fair, you haven’t really cried about your situation. You were headed towards a meltdown, regardless of what set it off.”
Ron quirked an eyebrow, not believing a word coming out of the ex-Malfoy, especially considering their late night conversations. “Mate, that kind of healing magic doesn’t present itself unless you really care about someone.”
“Auror training,” James grinned at him. “No really, he’s okay. Remus has him. It’s not safe to see him right now, I’m afraid. He’s sprouted fur.”
“Oh, Draco,” Hermione sighed in sympathy. Draco’s eyed narrowed. He hated the pity from her and that’s all she’s managed to give him.
“He and your mother were integral in bringing Voldemort down in the end—it doesn’t erase everything he’s done but we probably couldn’t get into Hogwarts without him.”
Meanwhile, at the Gryffindor table, Harry was attempting to keep a low profile to no avail. He schooled his features, but inside he was a nervous wreck. He didn’t particularly feel like being spoken to. Everyone was whispering around him.
“Is Draco okay?” Harry suddenly remembered not seeing him anywhere after the battle had been won. The room began to shake slightly at his realization that Draco might not have made it and he willed himself to remain calm.
"Because of Homer, obviously."
Harry sat up and wrapped his arms around Draco from behind, nodding into his back. “For a few moments, until Voldemort ripped me from him. It was terrifying.”
Sirius just smiled. “It was all you, kid. But, if you must know where the method came from, it was practice with your Dad.” Harry looked up at that in surprise. “His anxiety manifested like that, too. People were downright afraid of it sometimes; his desk was always several feet off the ground when he was studying. Always took someone else to help ground him: sometimes me, sometimes Lily, sometimes Re. Even Peter,” he added begrudgingly. “Anxiety attacks are not fun, especially not when you’re magic and powerful.”
Another nod. “Blaise is okay?”
Sirius’s smile lost a little of its sparkle at the mention of Harry, the light leaving his eyes. “He’s alive, so from a physical standpoint, yes. A bit malnourished, having trouble sleeping, but they’re working on it.” He pulled out a mirror. “If you want to talk to him, you could use this, but Healer Turner seemed adamant about leaving him be for the rest of the week.”
Sirius blinked, realizing he just divulged some secret information. “You didn’t know? I thought you’d know.”
“Did she turn out okay?”
Harry looked up at this in surprise. He assumed Draco was just primping, knowing how vain the ex Malfoy Heir could be. He hadn’t considered insecurity was the reason behind Draco’s scrutiny. “You don’t look much different to me,” Harry offered in response, standing to join him by the mirror.
“Do you still want to…you know.”
Of course Hermione would agree with Dumbledore. Harry was doomed.
Harry’s cheeks flushed at the title. “Why did they call you, though? Wouldn’t they have called the school?”
Harry sighed. “Look. I don’t know what happened between the two of you; frankly, I try very hard not to involve myself in Slytherin business. I think you need to give him his space. He was obviously upset the last time you two spoke.”
“Well yeah but that doesn’t mean I should be running around telling everyone. Not about public displays like that.”
“Hello Uncle Regulus,” Harry said.
Sirius looked at him. “Fucking cheering charms. He was abusing cheering charms—the scan showed about 10 in recent bodily memory. Don’t they teach you in school anymore that overuse can make depression symptoms worse? That people who have felt suicidal should
Harry’s eyes darkened at the thought of it, rather liking that idea. Suddenly his worries were forgotten as the two tangled up in each other for the rest of the night, Dark Lords be damned.
Harry shook his head. “How is that possible? I didn’t even know about this place.”
“How are you feeling?” asked Remus. When Draco looked up at him, he winced.
think some of my being a twat as you so graciously call it had to do with the horcrux. It can apparently possess those who are near to it. Everything about Second Year makes sense now.”
"You're still a child," Remus chided and then softened. "But yes, you can very well die if it gets too severe. Genetic complications like this have been known to kill those afflicted after too many transformations. Lucky for you, however, we aren't living in the dark ages and we have the capacity to protect you. Wolfsbane will keep your wolf from killing you if you stay on it," Remus began to explain, causing Draco to stand up abruptly.
When all was said and done, Sirius brought the 8
“You defected from Voldemort, not the Malfoys. Your Father may be the Lord but that does not mean that he can be a tyrant, changing the traditions the line has stood for for centuries. Each family is inherently neutral – choosing a side does not make you a defector.” Bill pointed at Sirius’s name. “He also chose a side. No matter how much his mother desired to remove him from the Black name, she could not. The Black Family stands on similar pillars as the Malfoys: justice, civility, and, surprisingly considering how we’ve seen them in recent years, friendship and lovingness.”
Draco forced a smile on his face. “How’s your Dad?”
“What?” Draco shook his head. Something wasn’t right. “We need to get you to the Hospital Wing, come on.”
Harry nodded, trying to process that information. The full moon was two weeks away. It felt like too long to wait to see Draco was actually alive. “Can I go see him?”
Sirius grinned. “Excellent.”
Draco took the news pretty well. He had a sneaking suspicion Dumbledore was doing this to protect him, fully aware of what being disowned would do to his reputation with the Slytherins. At least he wouldn’t need to come up with a bogus excuse as to why he was avoiding the dorms.
Jack nodded in realization. “You’ll look a bit healthier if you take care of yourself. Our prey is unfortunately people, so we look a little more attractive than the average wizard.
James looked at Harry in awe. “Harry? I haven’t checked in on you in a little bit. What happened?”
Harry woke up with a start in his room, holding onto his rune. He looked around to make sure Tom hadn’t followed him out of his dream and sighed, rubbing his eyes tiredly.
It had been quite a few weeks since Harry left with his friends to play hero and Draco didn’t feel any less betrayed or hurt. Did he misinterpret their relationship? What did he do to be deemed unworthy of actively fighting for the Light? He wanted to prove he was more than a coward but he didn’t seem to have the confidence of those around him. It was driving him spare.
“You were out cold—so was Draco. I’m glad the two of you are alright.”
Harry sat next to Draco, who was looking down at his mug still resting on the table. “You okay?” he asked softly.
“Sounds abysmal.”
Hermione stared at him for a long minute. “I finally see what he sees in you,” she said, smiling a little.
Theo sighed and rolled his eyes. “Not everything is about you, werewolf.”
Turner pulled out a deep purple potion next. “This is for sleep. You don’t look like you’ve been getting much.”
Snape’s mouth formed a thin line and his eyes narrowed. “You would be wise to not speak about things you know nothing about.” The Potions Master was looking uncomfortable with the subject matter.
He was gone.
“Still, Harry,” Dumbledore replied, “you may be able to get into his good graces yet.” Dumbledore explained how Harry could get into Slughorn’s good graces again in order to get this very important memory. Harry found himself agreeing to help. It was odd, thought Harry, that he was so angry with the headmaster for so long but once given some semblance of a choice he was willing to help the man with this. He chalked it up to the fate of the world being on his shoulders than anything else. He would help him if just to get to the bottom of the horcrux mystery himself.
Draco stood too. “I want to come. I want to help.” Harry blanched at that. “What?”
“You’re brilliant, Draco, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” Blaise was smiling fondly at him now, and it was all Draco could do not to feel regret on not picking things back up with him fully. If he did, maybe they’d be off in America and Harry would be a distant thought in his mind. That moment passed, however, and Draco realized that it had always been and always will be Harry, despite his love for his best mate. He’s been obsessed with the green-eyed wonder since before they met. That didn’t keep him from daydreaming about simpler times, though.
“Go on ahead, I need to use the loo,” Harry said. Hermione’s eyes narrowed.
“Why is everyone that I care for so incredibly stupid?” Draco said, eyes wide. Blaise would be coming here? What was wrong with him?
Draco reached for it and turned it slowly for examination. The back of the mirror had his initials woven into the design. Draco grinned. “Brilliant. It’s connected to everyone’s?”
Sirius’s bright blue eyes welled up a little. “Get used to it, kid.” He released Harry’s hand and stood. “I’m going to make rounds to the other tables. I should really see to getting an 8th Year table: would be much more manageable.”
It was all coming out now, the ex-Malfoy Heir could hold in his rage no longer. “You didn’t even tell me you were plotting to leave—you just left me here alone. All I do is worry and then you tell us how stupid you’ve been and I can’t take it!”
The next morning, Draco began to show small signs of progress. He was able to sit up without much pain but was unfortunately still bed-ridden and in need of pain potions. He really needed to get out for the holidays if he was going to show Harry the Garden. He knew without a doubt that the Black heir would benefit greatly from being able to speak to his parents after all of this. He should have told him about it. Maybe it would have kept him from trying to reach the other side.
Bill nodded. “Understandable. Why don’t I take you home after a Healer sees you, then and you can get cleaned up? There’s plenty of time to greet the masses later.”
"Yes. I'm going to bring you up some soup later, is that alright?"
Harry swallowed nervously. How was Sirius going to take this? “It’s me,” he said. “It’s Harry.”
But Harry gripped on, not letting him escape. “Fine.” He took a deep breath, not ready to speak what he had been dealing with into existence with the living. “I had a vision. A reoccurring vision really. About you.”
Draco tried not to tear up as he thought about his own father’s unwillingness to protect him in the face of adversity, yet this almost complete stranger was willing to freeze an entire battle just to make sure he was okay. It was almost too much. Attempting to remove himself from his thoughts, he wiggled his arm pathetically and said, “I can barely move this thing it hurts so badly.”
“Doubtful,” Draco sniffed. “Feel better?”
“Draco’s not with me, Blaise,” Harry said. “He went home.”
“I’m showing interest because he is my son! Not yours!”
"I think it would be cool," Harry joked. "Blood sucking werewolf – it's like a bad horror film."
"Draco requested asylum and it was granted by Dumbledore." Ron scoffed in disbelief, Hermione's eyes narrowed in suspicion, and Harry just looked on, silent for once. "You are to treat him, and each other, with the respect that young wizards should be exhibiting, and cease this nonsense."
“How did he help you? Why didn’t I know about this?”
Remus looked pained to see his young charge suffering so. He didn’t have a moment to respond, though, as their morning was interrupted by a great flash of light and a crash onto the kitchen table. The two jumped back from their seats, Remus whipping out his wand in a flash. Draco stupidly left his upstairs.
“Draco, that’s all I can ask. Thank you for your graciousness.”
“You saw?”
“You’d find many who’d argue that we are,” Draco commented dryly, sealing up yet another letter.
Draco glared but was fighting back a smile.
“No.”
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“This is war.”
Draco willed the magic away from his fingertips that jumped into action at the mention of his friend being hurt. “Can I help?”
“Why am I here, then?”
Blaise nodded in understanding. “I get it. I’m sorry for pressuring you about it.” He wiped the remaining tears from his eyes. “I do love you, though. That will never change.”
“Kid, I got some time. It’s been utterly boring here.”
“I’m not going to make a scene about your identity, you know. My excitement had more to do with solving the puzzle of the summer rather than drawing attention to you.”
Black.”
Remus seemed to catch on. “I know it’s a lot to deal with,” he replied. “Nobody else is here, though. All of the meetings are taking place at Grimmauld. We can grab a bite and then go see Blaise, if you still want to.”
“How? You’ve just met him. You know nothing of Draco Malfoy.”
abuse this privilege,” he ended with a wink.
Harry nodded. “Surprisingly, I think it’s actually a Black trait.”
Regulus smiled in reassurance. “Yes, in fact I do. Gryffindors take a while to cool off; he might be more willing to deal with this then.”
And that was that.
Fenrir looked taken aback at that, his eyes widening in surprise. “Of course! You’re my kin—I’m not letting you go down on my watch. Nothing is going to harm you if I’m around—not even your own genes.”
“Might be difficult,” Draco commented as Bill pushed the scanning equipment close to Draco’s face, causing him to flinch.
with a wave of his hand. “At least I didn’t wake you up too early,” he said, smiling sheepishly after seeing 7:30 as the time. “Let’s go to Hogsmeade after?”
Draco shrugged. “M’fine. I just don’t understand why he left me here is all.”
The elder wolf frowned. “Is something broken?” he asked.
Bill interrupted the two. "Enough," he said, though there was a hint of a smile in his eyes. "You probably won't crave blood, Draco. At most you might take your meat a little rarer, though I suppose you already do." Draco glared in response. "Your appearance might shift a little but you won't be an actual vampire. You would need to be drained of your blood. Mostly you'll just be able to survive the moon, which is the important thing here. It's pretty standard at St. Mungo's with cases like yours – it happens more often than you'd think."
“Draco that’s so irresponsible and reckless. You are a Gryffindor.”
“Being out of Azkaban means nothing to me if you can’t bring yourself to look at me. Draco, I am so sorry for everything.”
Harry shook his head. “I’m afraid I don’t have an appetite.”
“Healer Turner said he’d work on connecting me with Seeing specialists to help, but I’m already feeling crazy. Draco’s had to heal my arms twice already.”
James blanched at that. “Ugh, no. James—none of this Mr. Potter nonsense.”
“Again?” Sirius frowned as Remus and James emerged from the kitchen.
“Always the freak of nature then, am I?”
When he awoke from his nap, only Ginny remained in the room, reading some sort of novel that Draco couldn’t make out through sleep-filled eyes. “Was I snoring or something?” Draco asked her. “Scare everyone out of the room?”
“Sirius told me that in order to get him settled and immersed in his program Healer Turner is only allowing visits once per week,” Remus replied and Draco frowned. He needed to make sure he was still
“Samhain, Granger,” Pansy replied. She frowned, obviously not familiar. “It’s a night when the Veil is lower and we can commune with our ancestors. It phased out of fashion after the first Voldemort war to be more inclusive with the Muggleborns but the older families still celebrate.”
Remus barked out a laugh. “That’s clever,” he lauded, “guarded by Sirius. Nice.”
To get Harry on the up and up finally, the American specialist had him suffer through a week of lengthy Native American rituals that included steaming himself, smudging around his forehead, and picking up some intense Cherokee spiritual cleansing spells. They had successfully, albeit painfully, forced the remnants out: it was like an exorcism only less head spinning and vomiting—well, without the head spinning at least.
Harry nodded. “Good. I really don’t fancy hearing about my cheering charm mishaps in the Prophet.” Then he suddenly realized: “How am I to attend the trials and funerals if I’m stuck here?”
Draco smiled. “Don’t tell me the ice queen missed us?”
“Have you ever heard of surgery?” Healer Markus asked, startling Draco. He
Harry blearily opened his eyes to see Seamus and Bill standing over him. “You guys are loud enough to wake the dead,” he groaned.
The elder wizard smiled at Harry as he entered. “Harry,” he said, “I am so glad to see you alright. You gave us quite a scare.”
“A what?”
Harry was thrilled to have his father coming back. He wouldn’t let him down this time: he was going to do everything right. He hoped that nobody mentioned anything to him about how he was the past few months. He didn’t want to make Sirius feel bad, especially since he was doing so well lately.
Draco sighed. “Didn’t you already sit your NEWTs?”
Draco rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “I wasn’t sure when you died. I’m a little older than him is all.”
Draco laughed into his drink. “I recall you were the one to break it off, Blaise.” His eyes darted over to check on Harry, glad he ditched the glasses for the night so as not to give anything away.
“Surely, sir,” Draco replied, taking a sip from the mug. He could taste Severus’s brew anywhere. As he felt the familiar light-headedness associated with the truth serum take hold, Draco tried not to take offense to the headmaster drugging him. After all, were he in the same position, he would probably do no different.
Draco shuddered. “Is he okay?”
They made light small talk as they cooked, carefully dancing around the outside world so as to not break the calm spell of the village. Draco felt like Remus needed to build up to it, looking a little worse for wear even considering it was the day after the moon.
“Don’t you usually stay for the Halloween feast? You never go home for Samhain,” Blaise interjected.
Harry, on the other hand, seemed unbothered by the interaction. Though he seemed not to be one who was physically affectionate with his friends, Draco noticed that the orphan in question was not embarrassed or phased by their moment of intimacy. In fact, he just carried on like his normal, very quiet unless enraged, self – bringing Draco food at Remus’s request as he once again found himself bedridden before the moon, this time via a Weasley. It was driving Draco spare.
She led Harry out of the hall and into a small corridor. “How are you doing?” she asked, eyes searching Harry’s for any hint of how he was feeling.
“I never knew that,” Draco mused.
James snorted. “Were your parents able to do that to you?”
“I’d like that.”
“Well what about diluting magic? Mixing magic and non-magic is sure to lessen power.”
“A Black in America?” Blaise wondered aloud. “How odd.”
Ron blinked. “We’re all cousins.”
They were all silent for a few moments after that, understanding the gravity of what Remus was saying. Harry was beginning to feel ire towards his Headmaster: there was always some sort of twist or speedbump that had been hidden from him. It was becoming increasingly obvious that he was more of a pawn to Dumbledore than a person. He couldn’t stand it.
Harry was rendered unable to speak, just staring at the person he’d been so consumed with guilt over for the past seven months. “’Lo, Sirius,” Draco said, standing to greet him.
“We’ll strategize from there. There are ways to keep them out at night but it may not stop them from visiting you during waking hours. I’ll consult with our Seeing specialists if it comes to that, alright?”
Remus glared at Draco, who quieted instantly. “I swear if you took the Cloak again to sneak off to the club I will be beyond disappointed in the both of you.”
"So let me get this straight," Draco cut Bill off. "First I have to poison myself with Wolfsbane potion. The potion is barely working and now I get to be some weird vampire/werewolf hybrid so I don't suddenly die off? Is there even a point to live by then? What kind of life do I get to lead being a total monster like that?"
“It’s not like you already aren’t. Draco, you healed me this morning after a rough full moon and apparently after also setting Remus’s leg for him. You need to take yourself into account. You told me off about my own wellbeing which, granted, is fair. But you’re acting very un-Slytherin with your sacrificial healing acts.”
As Healer Markus left, Draco heaved a sigh of relief. “I cannot stand that man,” he remarked.
Draco swallowed nervously.
Draco was solemn, though. “It’s true. You’ve told me about this terrifying vision and old Draco would agree with you that it’s best to stay here where I’m safe. And I’m not trying to martyr myself, but I will become a martyr if that means saving the people I love. I’m not afraid of splitting my core again. Not if that means you, or Remus, or anyone I love can live.”
His uncle sighed at that. “I think it’s different for them. Jamie and I can interact with the living. We’re still in it in that regard. The others have simply moved on unless they’ve become ghosts. They can’t cross the Veil like we can.” At Harry’s blank expression, Regulus pushed further. “They are fine. Fred is fine. Tonks is fine. They’re at peace. They can relax now.”
Harry agreed, which filled him with both excitement and trepidation. At least he would be able to speak with others like him and potentially reclaim his nights but the thought of letting others in on his new secret was daunting. What if people began to ask favours of him? Spending all of his hours speaking with the dead didn’t sound like the most uplifting career path.
Turner frowned again but nodded in agreement. “Alright then.” He looked to Sirius again. “I’ll look for your owl, yeah?”
“No, honestly, he’s alive and the Garden has been healing him.”
Markus waved his wand over Draco, doing a basic scan. “How is your sight?” he asked, getting more serious in tone than before.
Draco was suddenly suspicious. He turned to Bill with glaring eyes. “Why would you need to check on how I’m doing?”
“Haz, the only thing you have to do right now is focus on healing. There will be a memorial after it’s all over—you can attend that. People will understand.”
“No wonder you’re all Gryffindors.”
The Great Hall was decidedly empty when they arrived, with very few early risers in the mix. They had changed into their day clothes, Harry keeping the green theme going with a long-sleeved pullover and Draco wearing a similar light blue style. They sat at the empty Gryffindor table, drawing some glances and looks from some of the early birds of the other Houses.
“I don’t recall me being the one who’s been throwing tantrums when the wind blows the wrong way,” Draco bit back. Remus aimed a glare his way, as if to tell him to watch himself, lest they witness another Potter meltdown.
Remus thought on that for a moment. “I’m not sure. Honestly, I’d probably sacrifice myself before he could. I care about those people.”
“Fancy seeing you in a robes shop of all places, I thought your look was much more relaxed.”
The two men shook hands and Sirius was finally whisked off to see his son.
“What does he want anyway?” Ron asked.
Harry was sat at a workbench across from his father sorting ingredients out for the upcoming classes this week. “This way, we don’t have a free for all running to the cupboard,” Sirius had explained. “If it’s all measured out, they just need to prep the ingredients and go.”
Just because Draco was taking the high road in the situation didn’t mean he couldn’t complain to Blaise about it. He was sat in an overstuffed armchair that was placed in Blaise’s room for visitors. Much like Draco’s experience with core depletion, Blaise was awake but stuck on bed rest while they monitored him. Still, he was better company than the sterile walls of his own room.
Harry sighed and looked down again. “I didn’t want to make a fuss. I thought the Garden would just—I dunno—
Jack shifted uncomfortably. “On the surface, maybe. He loves Rem too much to truly do that, though.”
Sirius looked to be torn between two responses. He had the strangest feeling that Molly was baiting him. At Remus’s warning glare, he chose kindness. “No, it’s fine: I was just a bit surprised is all, as I’m sure everyone is about me.” He smiled. “I would have gotten everyone presents but I’ve been a bit tied up. Happy Christmas.”
Ron laughed. “I do have quite a few older brothers, all smokers.” Ron handed the smoke back, “Just don’t tell mum.”
Draco nodded. “I barely recognized him.”
Draco sighed, feeling the weight of guilt settle in him. He really did have a way of running his guardians through the ringer with worry. “I understand, but I am fine, just a bit tired is all.”
“A friend,” he said, “I’m so awake right now it’s insane.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “The day I listen to Zabini about anything is the day you commit me to an asylum. We just got through a war; we’re allowed to be touchy.” Harry grinned at him in response, giving him a peck on the cheek.
Harry’s eyes were shining with unshed tears. “It’s not your fault, Draco. I picked up the bottle. I was just so overwhelmed with grief and the expectations to end the war for everyone. I just wanted to be numb. I didn’t want to feel anything anymore.” Tears began to spill. “I still don’t want to feel anything but I’m getting help now.”
Draco turned to him. “Yeah?”
“A little,” Harry pressed. “I don’t want to scare you with my feelings. It’s been a dark time for me with Sirius and Cedric. Draco is experiencing similar feelings. It’s easier to not frighten him. Please don’t be mad – I’m just trying to get by.”
Dressed in the tightest black jeans Draco has ever seen on anyone and a Ramone’s t-shirt, Harry looked dangerously handsome and everyone seemed to be aware of it. He’d move through the crowd as men and women pushed themselves against him, eager to try and grab his attention. Harry would smile easily and dance with some of them, Draco assuming the alcohol was aiding in his ease. It was night and day from his demeanor during the day. He’d go up to the bar to order a drink and someone would get it for him, Harry smiling his thanks and heading back to the floor. Draco found himself unable to look away, enraptured by Harry’s sudden charisma.
“It was strategic. We were trying to keep Harry safe.”
Draco let out a snort, unable to keep it in. He enjoyed when Remus gave it back to Harry, who had been insufferable as of late. The glare was now aimed at Draco, who shrugged at it. “You don’t scare me, Potter, I lived with a Dark Lord for a year.”
Turner frowned. “He’s not too pleased but he understands the situation. I know it makes him feel fuzzy—he likes to have hit wits about him, as would anyone.”
for you.” He went into detail about what topics should be covered and set them off to work. From how prickly Theo was being, Draco just knew it would be a long afternoon and wondered if Harry was faring any better with his Dad.
“Where’s mum? Why are you here? You hate me.” Lucius pressed the glass into Draco’s lips again and he drank. The cool water eased his throat a little. “Tea would be better.”
Harry just chuckled. “Draco, I already get bad press. I’ve stopped caring. That’s what we have Frances for: I barely have to acknowledge it. Besides, people are becoming more accepting. Who’s to say me turning wouldn’t help that along?”
The Healer interjected, “You’ll pass out from the pain if you don’t take something to alleviate it. I think you’re still in a bit of shock.”
“Of course, Draco.” The odd smile was back. “Thanks.”
Harry had drank enough for the entire Quidditch team for the first time in awhile and decided that Draco needed to comfort him. Draco wasn’t having it.
“You must be pretty powerful to have broken an adoption spell from Lily no less.”
Harry. He’s perfectly fine sans a weakened arm for the time being. Fenrir is overly-cautious but I’m sure Draco can only benefit from being with the pack.”
Remus frowned. “That’s why I had to come see you the day after the full.”
use them?”
“So you have.”
he warned himself, feeling the full force of his Aunt Bella’s madness inside of him.
“Well, no not really. Are you sure you want to know about this? It’s kind of dark.”
Regulus shrugged. “Everyone dies. It was their time to go so they went.”
“I know that letting Seamus fill you with as much alcohol and drugs as possible isn’t a healthy coping mechanism for your grief. It’s shite, Harry. You’re barely attending class, you’re on probation from the Quidditch team unless you get your grades up. This isn’t you.”
Harry seemed to light up at that, James too. “I’d really love that, actually.”
The Animagus turned to Remus. “Rem what do you think?”
“Why would they phase something like that out?”
“That’s kind of worse: you guys were trying to get him to pick some poor other kid.”
James snorted at that, happy that Harry hadn’t lost his humour. “He wouldn’t do that. He’s probably just panicking—believe it or not, he can be quite the drama queen when he wants to be.”
“Hermione, are you going to let them bully me like this?”
Harry’s lips formed a thin line. “That’s probably one of them. I’ll tell Dumbledore.”
Harry frowned. “Do you have to go?” It was already Wednesday and Draco and Remus would be taking leave the next morning. Fenrir had set up a Floo point in their apartment to make it more convenient, but Draco wanted to spend the day with the pack before the moon rose. Harry was already beginning to feel wary.
Draco sipped from his mug, pointedly ignoring the paper in his lap. “Where’s mum?”
Harry laughed and wrapped his arms around Draco. “You think they’ll be mad if I’m out of bed tonight?”
Bill squeezed his shoulder gently. “It’s alright. Thank you for asking.” He stepped back. “Stay still, alright?”
I'm onto the dissertation realm of grad school and I also broke my foot this summer--we're nearing the end, though!
Gaining his senses, Draco tried to pull away. “I’m not dying,” he explained, “I’m basically a halfling—healing accident. Let me go, I have to make sure Blaise is alright!” Draco tried to see around Greyback to where Blaise was, feeling the overwhelming urge that time was running out. He felt the healing magic push to his fingers as he struggled in Fenrir’s grip.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “I thought they said you were clear of that when they checked you.”
Harry laughed. “Beats me.” His expression dropped to one of scrutiny as he looked over Draco’s shoulder to the entryway. “Is that Parkinson?” he asked.
McGonagal gave a wry smile. “A Potter and Black in one; I should’ve known with you, Harry.”
“Uh oh, he’s going full Malfoy,” Harry commented dryly. “Next he’ll be demanding to speak to your supervisor, claiming that his father will hear about this.” The Healer couldn’t suppress the snort from coming out of himself.
Remus’s amber eyes crinkled in concern. “Hopefully the Healer has some Dreamless Sleep for you so you can get some actual rest. I’ll send him up.”
Harry tried to push down the guilt he was feeling about everything, to no avail. “Still sorry, though. He was a good friend and an even better brother.”
I guess. I figured you wouldn’t notice that I haven’t been in the house lately until you got used to the idea of me being there.”
He visited his Dad by himself for a little while after dinner, leaving even Sirius behind. He wanted to have quality time with the man he spent his whole life wondering about but never had the chance to figure out. It was therapeutic to sit with his father in the Garden and decompress a bit about his anxious episode. James smiled in understanding as Harry recounted his panic attack, noting how Sirius handled the situation with a practiced ease.
"Sirius was Harry's godfather," Remus responded, voice tight. "And James did have Black blood, even if he was very far removed from the Lord's line. Sirius let the Order use it, Harry let it continue." Remus pushed open the double doors to a screeching portrait and an even louder Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Miss the colony yet?" Remus joked, looking at Draco's surprised face.
As the potion began to subside some of the pain, Draco sighed in relief as he said affectionately, “Fuck off, Potter.”
“Marlene McKinnon, I thought you were long gone!” he exclaimed.
Harry thought, stepping down and out of the shop as quickly as possible. Draco was talking to Blaise outside, looking pinched.
“I hope he doesn’t bother Harry,” Ron said, looking over his shoulder to where they left the other Slytherin. “Wouldn’t want the train to explode from accidental magic.”
Harry could think of nothing he’d like to do less. Thankfully, his father noticed his extreme discomfort at the idea of being stuck in St. Mungo’s again and spoke up. “Send Healer Turner to the Manor—we’ll key him into our wards.”
“Wotcher, Remus,” he said cheekily as his vision cleared to see his parental figure. The glare intensified. “What did I do?”
“Your eye, dear—are you able to see?” Narcissa responded.
Blaise frowned, aware Draco was trying to deflect. “Never said I was – just a bit strange that I don’t recognize this one.”
Harry chose that moment to make himself known. “Draco I’m all done.” The two Slytherins looked up in shock. “Is everything okay?”
Remus nodded more assuredly. “Good.”
Sirius frowned. “I think he was just trying to protect you, honestly.”
“Not your fault.”
“Did he have a vision about me dying?”
Markus’s steady hand continued to weave diagnostic spells as he tutted phrases like “Extremely malnourished,” “Broken arm and a sprained ankle—I dunno how you managed to climb seven flights of stairs,” and Harry’s personal favorite, “That is quite a bit of vampire coming up, how did you manage that one?” Harry supposed his entire medical history wasn’t readily available in a deteriorating castle, otherwise he couldn’t fathom the Healer being so nonchalant about it. Sirius just squeezed his hand as a silent warning not to get sassy with the medical professional but Harry returned a glance at him that clearly meant there would be no promises.
“Can’t forgive you if you don’t tell me.”
Ginny just laughed and looked up from her book. “It’s almost midnight,” she explained.
Draco’s eyes widened. “
Sirius nodded. “Good—we’d like to keep it discreet as possible.”
Harry glanced at Remus and Narcissa, feeling suddenly sheepish with so many prying ears and eyes.
“Not sure who that is.”
Harry flushed. “I didn’t casually stroll out the door, Remus: we were at Black Manor.”
Sirius internally groaned: he really wanted to keep Harry away from the Burrow and Ron and Hermione: it was his only way to keep him safe.
Harry grinned at the honesty. Draco liked how it changed his face from Black stoic poshness to Potter goofy brilliance. “Have a lot of visitors today?” he asked.
“I tried. I got shot down. Can’t fool the magical registry.”
“It means,” McGonagall replied, picking up where Sirius had left off, “that you will be completing an apprenticeship of sorts this school year, open to only 8th Years. For the first half of the year, you will be on rotation, aiding the faculty and staff. You’ll spend about two weeks in each position. Hopefully, by the holidays, you will have a clearer idea as to what you might like to do once you leave Hogwarts. Before Christmas, it is expected that you will send an owl with your top three preferences of continued apprenticeship and rationale. The remainder of the school year will focus on one or two of your choices more specifically where you will work with your mentor to craft a plan.”
James’s face crumpled slightly at being called ‘Dad.’ He looked at Sirius. “You’re going to take good care of him, right?”
He would be going back to Hogwarts, perhaps with Blaise, Harry, Ron, and Hermione in tow. What would it be like, he wondered, to enjoy a year of school without looming threats of war? What would it look like when he didn’t have to hide his relationship with Harry, or his friendship with the Gryffindors?
“You’re okay with it?”
“Oh please, like she’s not always giving you a cuddle,” he replied sitting down. “Did you see Pansy is back?”
“Try being his roommate,” Draco replied. Ron let out a laugh, startling the both of them. “This is too weird.”
He woke up retching.
“Perfectly normal,” Bill replied, “for a werewolf/vampire,” he added with a wink.
"He does that," Remus said, a wry smile tugging at his lips.
“What’s this about werewolves?” Remus asked as he re-emerged, handing Harry his water who took it numbly as this new information washed over him.
“Couldn’t sleep and my arms felt really sore and stiff from being stuck in one place so long today so I fancied a walk,” he replied. He had been subject to the oddest magical variation of an MRI for the better part of the afternoon. Since they couldn’t use magic on him while they were figuring out how to treat him properly it was up to him to keep perfectly still. It really wore down on his already damaged arms.
! Remus!”
“And if you die? And make Harry feel responsible?”
Remus released Harry to hold him at arms length, looking him in the eye. “No. Not cowardly either.”
“Too right you are,” Remus responded as Harry reached for his glasses.
Draco smiled at Harry encouragingly, despite his misgivings about the situation. “Voldemort is a drama queen, he wouldn’t make non-descript items horcruxes: he’s probably created them out of the most ostentatious things. With Dumbledore’s help, batty as he is, I’m sure we can get to the bottom of it.”
“Sure.”
“He’s going to be so cross at me for not telling him sooner.”
“Barely,” Draco sniffed, but he was smiling. “I’m sorry I’ve been on top of you constantly—I just missed you.”
When he reached the safety of his booth, unwilling to abandon Harry entirely, Draco was surprised to find Remus sitting there. Suddenly feeling the tiredness only a fortnight of frequently a loud club could give, Draco sat in the booth with a simple, “Wotcher, Professor Lupin.”
“I think they need to have more sessions with him to figure out the best course of treatment. Right now, we just need to help him.”
“I know—you had a great record going for a bit there. You took your potions last night?”
Draco smiled. “I love you too.”
Draco sighed. “I have a lot of dissonance about that. I feel like I’m betraying my family.”
Harry frowned. “You didn’t visit him.”
Harry rolled his eyes at that. “Harry Potter messes a lot of things up.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll get poked and prodded by a Healer sometime after the war but that’s besides the point. I think it pushed me all the way back to when we were Confunded. My mind is pretty clear on the Harry situation.”
“Not really. Professor McGonagall said you were in a coma.”
Another nod. “Can I go out and see Dad today?”
Sirius nodded. “Okay.”
Harry was staring at the garden, fixated on its curving landscape and eccentric topiary as they walked further into its maze. “Draco,” he said, voice a little high.
Everything was going to be okay.
Sorry it's been awhile! I was trying to decide what I wanted this part of the series to be and now I think I've figured it out.
Draco sighed in relief. “Oh thank Merlin,” he gushed. “I’m fine, I just realized that I might look different now.”
Draco nodded, feeling awkward about Harry leaning on him so heavily when he just tried to kiss him minutes before. “We’ve been found out, it seems.”
Harry grinned. “I’m just down the hall.”
That made sense to Draco. He suddenly got an idea. “If you work with Dumbledore, then you can get in contact with him. I was granted asylum but got intercepted. No offense, your colony seems nice and all, but I would like to go where I was supposed to be in the first place.”
Harry grimaced in response. "I can understand that. Sorry – it's just that you don't expect me to be sunshine and daisies all the time – it's been easier to be around you than with my friends."
He didn’t have very much time to consider what was happening until he found himself in front of Lord Voldemort himself. It was all he could do not to pass out, trembling greatly after a whiplash of an afternoon. Where was Severus? Why wasn’t he faster? He couldn’t help but feel that all was lost. There were no other followers present but his father. A private punishment was rare- he wondered what Lucius had done do garner such an appointment.
Harry nodded in understanding. “It was pretty hard watching him learn to walk again.”
“Right, well, you’ll be returning to Hogwarts, yeah?” Draco nodded. “Wait until the winter hols to bring him ‘round. I’d wait with Remus as well. He’s not a Black anyway, I’m not sure if the Garden will be that responsive to him. Knowing Sirius, though, he’d probably figure it out.”
Regulus sat on one of the nearby benches at that. “Right. That.”
Harry had been allowed to visit every so often and they’d talk about innocuous things: Quidditch scores, what they were planning on getting everyone for Christmas if they were released in time, Draco’s latest read, if Harry was ever going to finish the Odyssey. They carefully avoided horcrux talk or the bandages still firmly wrapped around Harry’s arms. They most definitely avoided talk about how Draco sacrificed himself for Harry and what that meant. Draco was sure the subject would eventually come up, but not here. Not where there wasn’t really an escape from one another if feelings got too complicated.
Sirius suddenly looked around the room frantically. “I don’t see any suitors waiting in the wings to take Draco away, do you?” he quipped. Harry flushed. “Babe, you have more than enough humility—you’re not Odysseus, even if you’re both tragic heroes of some sort.”
“Canines are a bit pointy,” Draco commented, putting bits and pieces together as he continued to size up the newly minted Lord Black. Harry pulled back to get an eye at the teeth too.
“Please don’t touch her.”
Draco squeezed Blaise’s hand tightly, as if telling him he loved him too, just not in that way right now. “And I don’t love Harry, Blaise.”
The Auror Harry was with suddenly approached. He was disguised to look like an older version of Harry. “I got your robes. Let’s go, yeah?”
Harry took another slow drag. “They were in the room,” he commented, letting the smoke billow out of his mouth. “Probably Sirius’s.” Harry looked at his best friend and offered the stick. Ron took it to Harry’s surprise, taking a long practiced drag, sighing as he exhaled. “Look who’s critiquing who - pot kettle much?”
Draco sighed. “I know.” He looked up at Bill who was focusing on setting up the equipment. He looked tired. “How is everyone?”
Sirius nodded. “I’ll be fine—it’s just going to be a long night.” They rounded the corner to meet the rest of the group. Ron was leaning against the wall, looking quite grey.
“We don’t even know if he’ll be released in time for that. For all we know he’ll be in here until the Spring term.”
“It’s past midnight.”
“Did the moon rise yet?” Draco asked groggily, wiping his eyes.
“It’s okay,” he heard Remus say as he kneeled next to him, “I’m going to transform with you. It’ll be alright, Draco. Just breathe.”
“Fantastic,” Sirius grinned. “Thanks so much for coming. I know you lot are very busy right now.”
“It’s just—when done properly, I mean—it’s…freeing,” he finished lamely. This was a big step for Draco: in a few short months he had gone to sticking his nose up at anything different to actually enjoying the weird sides of himself. It was strange having to say goodbye to it so soon, especially since he thought he would be transforming forever.
Sirius circled him in suspicion. “What would you be doing here? And you smell like Rem.” His eyes widened. “
Harry nodded. “I don’t sleep much anymore.”
“This is insane.”
“Your family betrayed you.” Draco didn’t argue with that. “Plus, the moon is coming in about a week and you’re always irritable and sensitive beforehand.”
The four were silent for a moment as the information sunk in. They were on the precipice of something big.
Lucius seemed to notice the inner struggle as he tried to salvage the conversation. “Draco, I will be atoning for the rest of my days, whether it is in an Azkaban cell or locked within the confines of the Manor. I’m not asking for your outright forgiveness—I know I have not made things easy and in fact have made it harder for you. I just want to be able to see you and try to work things out as much as we can. I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t at least try to reconcile with you.”
“I truly thought that if I didn’t, we would all be dead. I was trying to protect you.”
Sirius was the first to shake himself from shock. “Ron and Hermione are at the Burrow: it’s not safe there for you to be there right now and I’m not taking any chances,” he replied nonchalantly, though he was not surprised to hear Harry suddenly speak after weeks of self-imposed silence. Draco jumped at Harry’s voice as though he heard a ghost.
“Go, now, this isn’t a joke!”
Remus smiled at that. “Yeah, I guess it is. I can’t believe the Healers didn’t brief you personally yet about this. They said you’ll still feel the pull of the moon probably, might get more instinctual, and if you were to bite someone during the full they’d probably turn.” Draco’s ears turned red at the prospect of biting someone. “But, as it stands, when you gave Harry part of your core, you gifted some of those traits to him. As your core heals, that half will be brand new—no werewolf bits.”
"Touchy, are we?" Regulus responded with a laugh. "I must have bollocked something up.”
he happens to be your clone.”
“You have to understand that it’s not Sirius in the mirror and that it is you. You were able to reconcile this with James.”
Regulus grimaced. “Can’t really say right now, sorry.” Draco looked ready to pounce. “Look, what month is it?”
Tears began to spill over his cheeks. “How could you know that?” he asked in earnest.
When they arrived at the safe house the next morning, Draco would see why Remus was walking on eggshells about who he was to stay with. "The safe house is Grimmauld, really?" Draco asked in disbelief as he read the address off of a bit of parchment just in front of the London abode.
“I was out of my mind. I thought I was doing what was best for our family—when I realized what I had done I changed allegiances. I helped where I could.”
“I’ll go up with you, Ron, if you want,” Hermione said.
The blonde interrupted him. “I know. I can’t put you through the malaise. Besides, we need Bill.” Draco looked down. “I’ll manage,” he sighed.
Draco nodded. “I think that’s why Regulus told me to wait until the winter holiday to bring Harry: he must have known that Sirius was alive.”
“Why?”
“It’s clearly in your blood, but you need to curtail the rash attitude if you want to make it a profession—our last natural Healer nearly burnt herself out until she figured it out as well.”
“Why didn’t you go to America, anyway?” Draco chanced one day. The two had been rekindling their friendship little by little, but Draco did not want to step on Blaise’s toes about anything—he couldn’t risk losing his only companion these days.
“Oh har-har, very funny,” Draco responded sarcastically, not missing the werewolf joke. Secretly, though, he was a bit relieved. If Harry was joking, he had to be coming to terms, right?
Draco frowned. He was afraid at what Remus might think at his next admittance. “No, it’s more than that…I want to
Draco smiled at that, surprised at Blaise’s reasoning. “We’ve come a long way, haven’t we?”
“Very.”
Fenrir nodded. “He knows you’re here and will be round when he gets the chance. He’s dealing with some tricky aftermath matters, I’m afraid. May be a week or so before he can get away.”
Sirius pulled Harry into a hug, causing him to let go of Draco’s hand. “We’ll see you at the feast, yeah?”
“I dunno mate, I’ve been dead for almost 17 years.”
The source of the crash was a man with long hair, currently making a pained wailing sound—there was blood everywhere. “Shite,” Draco realized, jumping to action. “He’s splinched himself.”
“Please go away,” an agonized voice responded. Remus turned pale, as though he heard a ghost.
Draco suddenly became aware of his parents’ plight now that everything was out in the open. “Were they punished?” he dared to ask.
Draco nodded. “Definitely thinned out a bit. Looking a little too much like your dad post-Azkaban to be honest.”
“Speak for yourself, practically immortal wolf-person,” Sirius quipped, but he winked at Remus in jest.
“It’s not the same. You know that and I know that.”
“Would you like to be addressed that way, or would you prefer Potter or Black?’
“Come again?”
Harry frowned. “I’m not someone with a good sense of humour these days, I’m afraid.” He looked at Regulus, who was now staring back at him. “You’re suffering, then.”
“Not if I kill him first.”
The Unspeakable sat and took their hood down. James let out a shocked laugh.
“Was he sorted, then?”
“Not Reg,” Sirius said.
James grabbed his son’s arm and squeezed it gently in reassurance. “Samhain celebrations really pull on deep, ancestral magic. I guess Remus thought he was too young of a wolf for it to affect him in this way, but with you doing the ceremony it pulled his wolf out. He wants to bring you into the pack.”
Harry nodded. “I guess I never thought that your senses could work in that way.” He had been agonizing over Draco’s immortality as of late and the thought of being marked making that issue go away intrigued him. “How does the mark work?”
“We’re all so young: it’s hard to imagine what any of us would do in the same situation.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron frowned at that. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Harry. Hermione and I aren’t fragile, you know, we can handle your darkness. Please don’t shut us out to protect us.”
At the mention of damage, Draco felt his magic rush to his fingers. He clenched his fists, willing the magic back into him. He’d probably die if he tried to heal Harry again. “Anyway, they’re running a bunch of tests and they can’t use magic to heal my arms so I get some cool new scars,” he continued, trying to make light of the situation but failing. “I just want this all to be over.”
“R.A.B.?” Sirius asked.
“Mhmm like you aren’t a moonraker at heart.”
Harry ran his free hand shakily through his hair. His scar stood out starkly against his pale complexion. “The relief lasted for like 5 seconds until I fully realized what I’ve done. I was terrified and I tried calling out but only Myrtle could hear me. She was determined to have a stall mate and didn’t do anything. Thank Merlin you showed up.”
Draco was silent at that, wondering if he could sit down with another person like him and get some answers, although it sounded like she struggled with overdoing it as well.
Harry frowned. “Superstitious like that, I suppose.”
Draco flinched away. “You don’t get to touch me,” he seethed.
“Oh piss off.” But it made Draco laugh and it seemed like everything was beginning to be okay with them finally.
“I’m going to go in,” Ginny said, looking determined. Blaise squeezed her arm reassuringly.
“And me, don’t forget me!” James added with a laugh. He wouldn’t be teaching, but spouses were allowed to stay on campus—Harry was extra glad for that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus grinned wryly at the young Malfoy. "I must admit, I was getting a bit nervous. Let me fetch you some tea." Draco curled up on the sofa where Remus was sat, wincing as he tested his arm out. Not so bad, he thought.
Remus frowned but he didn’t have time to answer as Nott entered just then.
Harry pushed him away. “You don’t know me if you think that’s what I’m doing.”
The three sat in silence for a few moments after that, until the sound of someone padding down the stairs brought them back into alertness. The sound of the shower had ceased.
“There were a lot of weird conversations, very few of which I was a part of.” Draco frowned. Of course, a moment where he could be truly helpful and he had zero intel.
They all remained silent for awhile after that. “So this is the calm before the storm,” Lucius mused.
he thought, grabbing the largest one that had a stopper. One more glance at the door and it was showtime.
When Harry, Sirius, and Remus stepped through the fireplace at Grimmauld, they were met with loud din coming from the next room. Boisterous conversation, laughter, and clanging of glasses could be heard. This was not like the Order meetings of wartime that held a somber tone. This was a celebrating Order despite their losses.
He knew how Draco felt about him if that drunken night was any indication, so he tried to mask his feelings by stone-facing it through the first few weeks of school. He would only bother Draco if absolutely necessary. He’d let the ex-Malfoy Heir get his bearings with his housemates in peace.
Remus focused on the wall behind Draco as he said, “Yeah. I dunno why he’s agreed to be honest with you.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “So… I missed it completely? Why did I even wake up then?”
After his third night of no sleep, Sirius seemed to take notice.
Sirius shook his head in disbelief. “That’s low even for Malfoy.”
Despite Harry’s happiness that they were all getting along, courting gifts of the past a silly Hogwarts memory, he couldn’t help but feel exhausted by the constant interaction day in and day out. He still had a ways to go in terms of his anxiety, and not having moments of respite were beginning to wear down on him. At least the Golden Trio left one another alone to think in the evenings—Draco seemed to be making up for lost time with how he was continually joined at the hip. It made Harry happy to see that he hadn’t ruined it all but also completely exhausted with the constant interaction day and night.
Harry nodded. “I’ve never had to fake it with you. You’ve never asked me to hide the darker parts of myself. You’re home; you’re Ithaca.”
“Noticed what?”
Draco shifted uncomfortably, wincing in pain. Remus tutted at him and fluffed up his pillows. “Shouldn’t you be in that meeting?”
Harry looked at him in surprise, green eyes bright with disbelief. "I wouldn't peg you as being into Muggle literature."
Sirius’s fanatical excuses knew no bounds in trying to keep Harry safe. At first it was, “you need to get your strength up—you’re so thin.” Next, it was, “I already got the cup—there’s no sense going out there with no leads.” This week, it was “this isn’t your war—why do you feel so compelled to end it?” Of course, Harry, growing tired of hiding, frustratingly accused Sirius of being a self-preserving Slytherin in Gryffindor clothing, perhaps even a Hufflepuff when it got down to it, resulting in a never-ending glaring match between father and son.
Blaise smiled and leaned back. “Ah. So this is what you’re upset about. It’s just a cloak, Black.”
“He provided Ginny Weasley the tool that allowed her to be possessed by Voldemort. He let
“How is that possible?”
Thanks for your feedback as to whether or not you would like to see a sequel--currently mind mapping it as we get closer to end of this one! Thanks for your support and happy reading!
Harry nodded as though that was good, resigning himself to silence once more. He was beginning to look eerily similar to post-Azkaban Sirius, hair a mess, pallid features, and deep circles under his eyes. “I need to figure out who this R.A.B. is,” Harry mused, pulling out the note that he had been keeping on him at all times, obsessing over it even. “I thought maybe if I spoke to Hermione she’d have a hunch.”
“Anything? What about back in Second Year with the diary?”
“No wonder he has a snake face, you can’t be human after that many soul splits.”
“I know it doesn’t seem right,” Remus began.
“We were just leaving,” Healer Markus responded as he headed towards the door.
As they set to depart, Lucius pulled Draco aside. “I’m sorry about earlier, Draco. I wasn’t even thinking. I just love you and want you safe.”
” He willed. Where was this coming from? He kept repeating the mantra over and over as literal light began to shoot from his fingertips and into the wounds. The bleeding had stopped, whether it was from Harry bleeding completely out or Draco’s magic, he didn’t know but he pressed on. Draco was beginning to tire but he knew he needed to keep going until he heard the heartbeat getting a bit stronger. He felt someone finally run into the room but he couldn’t take his focus off of the task at hand. Something had truly taken him over and it was frightening and exhilarating.
“Ravenclaw’s diadem, for one.”
Both Draco and Nott were working with Remus. Remus had a lot of set up to do, especially with the moon arriving mid-week, so he required some additional help. Draco was both apprehensive yet thrilled to be working with Theo due to the Slytherin’s standoffish demeanor. Hermione was working with McGonagall, Ron with Hagrid, Blaise with Firenze, who had recently taken up post as the Divination Professor as Trelawny had retired, and Pansy with Pompfrey. They all had their work cut out for them.
"Whatever," Draco sighed, suddenly very tired with it all. "Let's just get this over with."
Draco looked at the Healer in surprise, eyes glassy. “You really would have me? Even with my rash actions?”
“Re told me. You’re very lucky.”
“Nah, we’d eat you alive, I reckon,” said a voice coming from the door. It was Ron with Hermione in tow.
That realization stung for Draco. His father was right—Severus sold him out to keep his place within the Dark Lord’s ranks. Did it really matter, though? “You disowned me.”
“Special how? I thought you were just showing me some of my heritage.”
After what felt like hours Sirius stepped back through the fireplace without Harry. The sun was about to rise and the man looked like he had seen another battle. He had dried blood on his shirt from where he held Harry and his long hair was looking frenzied and out of place.
Harry shook his head. “No, it wasn’t anything like that.”
Draco waved his hand in annoyance. “Nevermind that, we’re burning moonlight. Do you want to come or not? It’s really cool.”
“I’m not cursed…I’m just different now,” Draco replied defensively. "Werewolves always get ill from the moon."
Draco glared at the ceiling. “My father is a murderer. He shouldn’t even be allowed here.” He squeezed Remus’s hand tightly as a wave of pain rolled through him. “Fuck.”
Lucius blanched at that. “I deserve that, I suppose,” he responded, looking a bit pained to admit it.
Draco was too busy feeling sorry for himself to even consider when he would be transforming. In fact, he had been so irate at his father this entire time that it hadn’t even crossed his mind until just then, causing him to furrow his brow in concern. “I thought we got sick from the moon,” he chose to say. “I haven’t felt its pull yet.”
Sirius gave a little grimace in response. “Yeah, sorry, I’m a bit distracted.”
Draco chuckled. “He’s very nice,” he commented.
“James.”
“Me?” Snape scoffed. “I’m not the one creating tornadoes in the hallways.”
“Lily.”
His mother sighed and smiled apologetically at her son. “I suppose it never came up. I try my best to avoid practicing often.”
Harry pursed his lips in concentration. “Let me see. Turn towards me.” Draco rolled his eyes but begrudgingly obliged. Harry gave Draco a proper once over, his green eyes slowly roaming over his body. Draco felt heat rise to his cheeks, feeling more like a specimen than a person. He never imagined Potter of all people to be looking at him like this and he never felt so insecure. He forced himself to get a grip as Harry’s eyes roamed back up, meeting his own. A grin formed on his face, shocking Draco – Potter hadn’t smiled like that in weeks. “Show me your teeth?” Draco’s eyes widened but obliged. “Hm. Looks completely ordinary to me – a little more angular and wavier hair, sure, but you’re the same old pointy Draco we all know and begrudgingly tolerate. Can we go get some food now? I’m starved.”
Well that was concerning. “Do they have any clue what it can be?”
”, expending what felt like all of the magic he had. He didn’t care if he became a Squib after this, he needed to save Harry. He wasn’t going to fail him again. After what seemed like an eternity later, Harry’s eyes fluttered open. “Oh thank Merlin, you stupid idiot.” Draco exclaimed, then promptly passed out from exhaustion.
“Remus, what happened to him?”
Ron was having a rough time with Firenze as he didn’t have a Seeing bone in his body. It also made him a little maudlin when Firenze would scry with the stars, saying someone who passed had a message from him. Harry had told him it really was Fred, who was a consistent visitor of his, but he kept missing the message in his dreams as Voldemort kept ripping him away any chance he could. The nights were improving thanks to his talks with Andromeda and he would be seeing Narcissa soon, but his meditating and rune stone protections couldn’t keep the dead out indefinitely. They always came back at some point.
“Adoption spell broke,” Harry explained, too overwhelmed to say much more.
“Well I have these friends as of late who knew your brother quite well.” Regulus hummed in response, looking a bit far off.
“Great,” Draco managed. “Fantastic.” Draco was quickly learning that nothing could ever be easy for him.
Draco thought suddenly as the scent invaded his nostrils. He let the wolf take over for a moment as he let his sense of smell take over. It
“I knew you were a Black, I was just waiting for it to show up,” he laughed.
“Neither side is perfect, Draco.”
“I know you’ve only been here a few days, but how is it all going?” Healer Turner asked once they got settled in the sitting room.
Harry shrugged. “My Dad.”
~*~*~*~
“Let’s keep it that way, yes?” Harry rolled his eyes again but nodded. “Stay with them anyway for me? In case our old friend Tom comes knocking again?”
Harry leaned back into his pillows looking quite tired. “Yeah. Food tastes like ash, I can hardly keep anything down. It’s a mess. It just keeps getting stronger the longer it lingers inside of me—it can never be easy, I suppose.”
“Talk to Walburga much?”
Remus shrugged. “It was James’s spellwork so your guess is as good as mine. You should ask him when we’re back home.”
That explained the unlikely duo. “I’m sorry—I was just so tired—I didn’t mean to cause a fuss.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, referring to the nightmare.
“You’ve probably atrophied it with my son waiting on you hand and foot.”
Nonetheless, they ended up at the Burrow the next day, much to the chagrin of Sirius. It turned out that Dumbledore had tried to leave the sword of Gryffindor to Harry, although he did not have the right. Harry had realized that the sword would be able to destroy horcruxes, as it was impregnated with basilisk venom. The sword, however, was missing and was not Dumbledore’s to give. Harry was back to square one, but at least he was able to collaborate with the other two thirds of the golden trio.
Harry was frowning now too. “Draco’s dad?”
” holding his breath in anticipation. Nothing happened for a moment and Draco wondered if he was harboring any ill intentions towards Harry, as that would be the only way it wouldn’t let him through. His fears were alleviated when a bright light shone through the fireplace. “Brilliant,” he breathed, stepping through to the other side.
“Wonderful. I’ve also requested you as my next mentee beginning next week, so you’ll be helping prepare the sessions with me. I hope that’s alright.”
James laughed. “Makes sense with his proclivity to get into all sorts of trouble.” He looked at Harry. “Can I give you a hug? Haven’t been able to do that from afar.”
Draco shook his head. “I dunno. If you go to see her, I’m coming with you.”
The former professor frowned. “I’m not actually sure about that. Sirius mentioned it to me a few times when we were kids. Did you get to see him?”
“Self-preserving Slytherins,” Harry replied, before meeting Draco’s lips with his own in a lazy kiss. Draco melted into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders, running his fingers through messy black hair. This might be the best Christmas he ever had, Draco thought. Who needs piles of gifts from Father Christmas when he could have the savior of the wizarding world enveloping him in searing embraces? How did one get so lucky?
Professor McGonagall preached unity, but the distinct lack of Slytherin upper years made the speech lose some of its intention. Blaise, Draco, and Nott were the only three of their year to return, and it looked like Nott was having a hard time simply existing, shunned to the end of the table.
“There is a reason I brought Horace Slughorn back this year, Harry.”
Harry scrunched up his face in concentration. “I don’t remember any of that.”
They were able to navigate most of the shops without anyone stopping or staring, thanks to the notice me nots firmly placed. However, when they reached
“Isn’t it romantic, Draco?” she said dreamily, obviously excited at the prospect of a new hunt.
"Hi Bill. What are you doing to Draco?"
“You’re sure we can’t see Harry today?”
Harry nodded. “It’s a date.”
“Cissa’s kid?” Draco nodded. “You’re how old?”
“You mean I’m going to look like this forever? Does this mean he’s my… oh God.” Harry collapsed to the floor of the bathroom, pulling his knees to his chest, full realization taking hold. “I’m not a Potter?” he asked, broken.
. I feel like I can actually breathe properly here. Seeing you is an added bonus,” Harry reassured.
Harry shook his head. “You’re not a monster. The air was so thick with magic it was driving everyone a little mad. It’s okay.”
“Or,” a voice said from behind him, “it’s Ministry mandated for employment.” It was Professor Lupin. Draco could kiss him in relief. He suddenly felt awful for the hell he put him through while he was teaching at Hogwarts. “Stop feeding him nonsense, Dad.” Draco didn’t expect that colloquialism.
Another frown. “Hopefully when you meet with Healer Turner next week he can help you with that. He’s really excellent at his work. Top of the field.”
The Headmaster wasn’t nearly as concerned that a student was imbibing on campus and causing destruction as McGonagall was. “Mr. Black is doing
“You know Odysseus returns home, right? He gets peace.” Sirius sat at the edge of Harry’s bed, taking the book out of his hands and flipping through.
Ron would get very cross with him at times, especially if he was doing more than drinking.
Draco settled into the pillows as well, letting out a yawn. “The task at hand can wait until tomorrow.” He gingerly curled into Harry, still a bit sore in the chest area. “I’m knackered.”
Ron let out a low whistle. “You got it bad for him, don’t you?”
“Sure, Malfoy,” he said.
Draco’s fists clenched. He felt like Harry on a bad day and needed to bring his nerves down. He knew that if he said yes, he would have a terrible reunion with his father and might blow up at him right before he has to face judgement. He also knew if he said no, despite all of the horrors he had to endure via his father and his decisions, that he would feel guilty about not allowing him to try to make amends. He really had no choice for peace of mind. “This isn’t fair,” he said.
He placed both of his hand over Blaise’s chest, directly above his core and began to work the dark magic out from around his best mate’s magical center. The dark magic was violent and didn’t want to go without a fight—Draco felt it pulling not only on Blaise’s magic but on his own as well as it desperately tried to keep hold of Blaise. Draco squeezed his eyes shut harder as he began to pull more of his own resources to break Blaise’s core free of the dark magic—he felt some sort of liquid running down his face as well as dizziness that was always a telltale sign he was overdoing it, but he’d worry about that later.
Sirius nodded. “If it makes you feel any better,” James piped up, “he doesn’t shut up about you, so it’ll be a nice reunion when you do see him.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. He also wasn’t expected that. “What are you talking about?”
Harry shrugged, opening the letter. “I’m being summoned to the Burrow for the reading of Dumbledore’s will: I’m in it apparently.”
Sirius hummed in confirmation. After taking a slow sip from his glass, he began to explain. “The Garden healed me well past where it should have.”
“It’s not their fault,” Draco interrupted, nipping an infamous Potter-Black doom spiral before it began. “I am fine.” He looked down, heat rising to his cheeks. “I just acted rashly in the last hour or so is all.”
“What are the remaining pieces?” Draco asked.
“For who? The Fascists? That’s ridiculous.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, we know we don’t use that word here.”
Draco slid into bed next to him, placing a kiss to the side of his head. “Night, Haz. Sweet dreamless sleep.”
“Hogwarts, of course.”
“Not your business,” he replied. He really needed to cut Potter off.
Sirius barked out a laugh at that. “Very true. It’s doubtful we’ll find a press agent that Harry or I trust, however. We’ll figure it out. For now, the focus is on getting him better.”
Draco frowned. “No, I don’t think so.”
“Such a Potter,” he commented. He wrapped the fireplace with his wand like he did all those months ago, intoning “
“That didn’t even cross my mind,” Ginny replied. “I’d welcome it.”
It was now just Draco, Sirius, and Lucius in the room. Draco stood to greet them. Sirius pulled him into a hug—
James looked down at their hands. “That’s got to be an illusion—you would usually feel a heartbeat there so you’re imagining it.”
of a place where he didn’t have to feign being 17. His excitement at the prospect of running away from everyone, for even just a few short hours, was short lived. “Nothing I have fits me now,” Harry said frowning. “I can’t very well go out in a robe. I think I’m destined to be trapped here.”
McGonagall nodded in understanding. “Yes, of course. 8
“Fenrir Greyback.”
Harry’s eyes widened as he reached for his glasses, almost side-swiping Draco in the process. “Sorry,” Harry grimaced, “I forget how long my arms are sometimes.” He put his glasses on and the world came into focus. “How are we getting away without a guard?”
Pansy sighed. “How myopic of you. Of course some are more gifted than others, Potter for one. Anyone can scry though or read leaves. It takes practice. So do most of the Old Ways. A lot of them get marked as dark magic but they’re not—they’re just more connected with Mother Magick and the elements.”
Molly aimed her own glare at Harry. “I have six sons, do you really think I’m going to budge? Let’s go.”
Draco laughed. “I mean it, though. I know you’re scared but you can’t tell me you wouldn’t do the same.”
Harry smiled at that. “Yes, actually. That’s been great. I just wish all of my visitors were as kind.”
“Haz!” Remus exclaimed, pulling him into a hug as Harry walked into the room, waving someone off from outside. “Didn’t expect to run into you today.”
Draco nearly choked on his coffee. “What?”
James looked at Remus and Sirius. “Ready?” They just nodded. James took a deep breath. “Okay.” He stepped out into the Garden.
Draco was finally able to glimpse Harry around Remus and held back a gasp. How was this possible? Did that make him and Harry related? He shuddered at the thought.
Ron shook his head in sadness and guilt. “I can’t believe I let him get that bad.”
Draco shook his head. “Nobody knows where he is.”
Harry took it gratefully. “Thank you. I hope I don’t mess it up.”
Harry’s eyes were beginning to well up as he began to feel completely overwhelmed.
Remus nodded. “They’re confident that they can do it. Unlike your injury, the core didn’t deplete, it just sort of unstitched itself. It’s going to be awhile before he wakes, though. It’s a tricky process.”
“The wolf can be emotional. It opens an instinctual side to you. You’ve been battling health problems most of the time since your change. This side will take some getting used to. Even if you don’t have those feelings for Blaise anymore it’s still going to hurt. It’s going be alright.”
“Draco?!”
” Draco replied sharply. “That is the stupidest thing they’ve done yet.”
“Emily and Dru want me as a third. Trust me, I’ve had this conversation with them and they never get the hint. I repeat, insufferable.”
Harry felt exhausted despite getting a full night’s rest. He scrubbed his face with his hands as he looked at himself in the mirror, no longer fazed by seeing the Black features so prominent on him. In fact, he thought he reflected both his fathers at different times, depending upon the expression. He was really coming into his own even though he was still recovering from the rotting curse. The bags under his eyes seemed to be depthless and his collarbone still stood out starkly against his skin. It made him a bit uncomfortable but there was nothing for it but time.
“And I’m allowed to join in?”
He closed his eyes as he felt the potion’s effects ease his pain somewhat. Unfortunately, he was wide awake and it seemed to be midnight. He was alone for the first time in awhile. It felt unsettling. He looked at the table to see that Molly had dropped off food for him. He was suddenly ravenous. At the thought of wanting to have the basket closer to him it appeared on his lap. He jumped suddenly and yelled out in pain. A Healer rushed back into the room.
Sirius lit up at that. “Yes. Can’t wait to see Molly.”
“What’s happening-OW!” his other arm snapped. “It’s not the full!”
“I know it seems insane to you, growing up with Muggles. Very powerful wizards can become pregnant. Your father was essentially unmatched in magic, except for maybe Sirius. They came from strong, old families. Male pregnancy is common for them.”
Sirius let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Well I’m trying my best. Never been a father. First day on the job and all.”
“Crucio!” Draco watched as his father fell to the floor, writhing in agony. This was no game. There was no glory or independence on the Dark Side. All of the folk tales his father told of the good times were just that – folk tales. Every experience Draco has had involving Voldemort had convinced him that the man was an egomaniac hell bent on controlling everyone. Draco set his jaw at that thought, gaining some nerve. He would not die a coward. “Do you know what your father cost me, young Draco?” he asked.
Draco gave him a final squeeze and stepped back. “I love you too. I’ll stay safe as long as you do.”
Harry gave a small smile instead of blowing up in response. ‘Nah. I’m just tired,” he explained, “I know how it’s going to go and I am very much exhausted by it.”
The man sat up gingerly, hair finally moving out of his eyes. Draco’s eyes grew wide. “Harry,” he stated—then promptly passed out.
“Harry, relax,” Remus replied. “It’s not some mystical force pushing upon Draco or anything. It just comes with the extra sensitivity. We can basically sniff our soulmates out. His emotions are his own, I promise you.”
“I just thought I’d be cured by now. I’ve been doing therapy since the incident. I snapped into anxiety and depression like it was nothing.”
Blaise looked stiff, Draco noticed as he entered the living room. The teen was sitting fully upright on an armchair, holding onto a mug of tea as though if he let go he would float away. Kingsley, Remus, and Sirius were in the room as well, though they were having a quiet conversation in the corner away from Blaise. “Heard you couldn’t go on without me so you stayed in a warzone—how romantic,” Draco joked. Blaise jumped, realizing someone new was in the room, then visibly relaxed when he saw the blonde.
She laughed. “Not quite. I wanted to let you know we have some scouts coming before the holiday break and was wondering if you had any interest in professional Quidditch. You definitely have the stuff from what I remember.”
“Have you considered any post-school prospects yet?” she asked, motioning for him to sit on a bench next to her.
Draco flushed a bit at that. “I’m actually not sure that I can weather the stairs,” he admitted.
“Nice to see you leaving the cave. I was starting to worry you’d become so pale you’d disappear,” he joked. Draco grimaced in return. “How is the arm doing?”
“Oh, Draco.” There was the pity he was waiting for. He loathed it. “Even if you weren’t turned, this war is going to destroy any normalcy any of us has had. It’s worse than the first time. We’re facing someone not even nearly human – it’s going to affect us all.”
“Is he bringing someone through?” Sirius asked. “We’ll have to send for more food eventually.”
“Not being face to face with a huge werewolf?”
“Remus is a saint. I owe you dinner and a drink.” Sirius patted him on the arm in thanks and was let into Harry’s room.
Remus suddenly understood, sitting himself in the nearest armchair. “The Garden,” he repeated. “Of course, why didn’t I think of that?”
Turner ran a quick diagnostic, waving his wand over Harry. “Your arm seems to be healing alright, just a bit slow. You’re suffering from magical exhaustion so your body is taking its time healing. I’m afraid there isn’t a potion for that—you just need to rest and not do too much magic, if any at all. Healer Markus told me to advise strict bed rest for at least a week, no magic. Then you can start trying out small things, Lumos, Accio, et cetera.” At Harry’s blank face Turner looked at Sirius. “I have some paperwork with all of this written down for you. I know it’s been an overwhelming time.” He procured a packet and handed it to Sirius before turning back to Harry. “Are you swinging high or low today?”
The Healer tried to conceal her mirth as she said, “He’ll settle down soon. He just got new pain potion. What are you doing out of bed, Mr. Potter?”
Harry stood. “Sure, Professor.” He caught Draco’s eyes as he left the hall—he seemed nervous. He gave him a small nod as if to show he was fine. It didn’t seem to help.
“And you say they’re
“Uh, he is sitting right here and he could’ve managed,” Draco interrupted mid-chew, abandoning all table manners for the sake of deliciousness.
“Draco!” Harry called as the blonde bolted off. If Harry was following, he surely wouldn’t be able to keep up, Draco running at supernatural speed through the castle doors.
Harry touched his neck where Draco was running his tongue feverishly up against just minutes before. Oh. “I don’t know why he doesn’t just Mark me and get it over with. It’s obviously driving him spare.”
Draco shook his head. “It’s not grace. I’m just too exhausted to hold onto any strong emotions right now. We’ve done enough fighting for a lifetime, I think. As long as you’re true to your word and are going to work on atoning, we can try this. Please don’t make me regret this.”
Blaise was staring at Draco with an unreadable expression. “I never doubted my love for you, Draco.” Draco snorted in a very un-Malfoy-like manner as a response. “I’m serious!”
Harry’s eyes narrowed again. “What do you mean?”
Draco closed his eyes in frustration. “I guess I’ll just have to work on keeping myself in check around the full moon.”
Draco looked at Harry in shock, suddenly realizing the fullness of what he had done. Hermione, too, had caught on to what Remus was saying and was staring at Harry as well. Harry, though, didn’t seem surprised at all: did he already know? “I turned the Chosen One into a werewolf?” he said in horror. “How did
“I didn’t know he had anxiety,” Harry said. “I know nothing about him,” he added, a bit put out by that notion.
“You shouldn’t even be here. You chucked him out of your life as soon as he became different! Now that he’s half normal again you’re showing interest?” Half normal? What did that even mean?
Marlene just nodded thoughtfully, taking out a writing pad and quill.
“You sound like your brother.”
Draco reached out and squeezed his arm gently. “Get used to it.”
pretty common with the Black family—Sirius has a knack for it but hates it. He tries to ignore the visions as best as possible to avoid being lost in them. I’m pretty pants at it, honestly.” Harry just nodded thoughtfully. “What was the vision that has you mute?”
Harry blinked the glare off his face, returning to his letter. “I think I need new robes,” he muttered, fully aware that he had been wearing Sirius’s old clothes the entire month—nothing else would fit.
He glanced over at Remus who smiled knowingly at him, making him want to disappear where he stood. “Yes, I stayed with him,” he mumbled. “The castle is just too thick with bad memories I suppose.”

Draco reached for the mirror and examined it. “Some sort of Floo charm?”
“So I’ve heard.”
“It’s not an excuse though—I’ve been through enough ‘reactionary’ abuse to know that.”
“Harry’s doing alright, considering. He’s here too. Same floor and everything.” Remus smoothed back Draco’s hair just like his father. The juxtaposition of the two men made Draco’s heart ache. He hated to admit that he missed the bastard, even if he threw him out in the cold. “You called on some ancestral healing magic, according to the Healers. Your father confirmed. Kind of cool, actually, if you ignore why you had to do it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Quite.”
Draco sighed and decided to change the subject. He’d confront his father about it all tomorrow. “You look really thin, Haz. Have they figured our what’s going on?”
“Are you being safe I hope? You look a little strange” Blaise was one of the only people Draco confided in when weighing asylum. He was decidedly happy when Draco admitted he was going turncoat, Blaise never being one for Muggle hating violent endeavors.
Remus hummed in confirmation.
Harry just shook his head, plopping down on Draco’s bed and rubbing his face in his hands tiredly. He peeked through his fingers as he said, “Stupid nightmare. I haven’t slept alone since St. Mungo’s and I think my brain didn’t know how to react. I’m sorry, Draco, I know it’s early.”
Harry was taken aback. “I could never be tired of you, Draco.”
"Please don't call me that," Draco said, feeling more uncomfortable about his obvious feelings toward Harry.
miss my mum.”
“It is,” Draco supplied, “though they haven’t had a Parselmouth in centuries. Bully for you.”
Dumbledore sighed, sitting back in his seat. “Your parents tried their best to protect you but it ultimately drew Voldemort even more to you. We couldn’t have known he was going for similarities rather than the ‘purest’ blood.”
“We both did. It’s okay—he’s getting the help he needs.” Hermione looked to be holding back tears. She was fiddling with the hem of her shirt nervously. “Hermione, you didn’t even know the half of it—you would’ve gotten him help straight away if you did.”
He hadn’t realized he was screaming until the magic surrounding Blaise’s core finally yanked free and poured itself into Draco as though he were a sieve, reaching for his own core and suffocating him. Draco refused to let it settle inside of him and pushed all of his energy toward the vial—the magic expelled into it and Draco quickly placed the stopper back on, falling back onto his heels as he sank to the ground.
James took notice and pulled Harry into his arms, squeezing him tightly. Harry leaned into the embrace, feeling himself coming undone. “You
“How’s living with the ferret?”
since his passing. He could swear he could feel his heart pounding in his ears but that hardly made any sense. He felt numb and on fire all at once. He heard Remus pacing upstairs but doubt he could make it up there to calm him down. His head was spinning but one thing was for certain—he did not want to see if Harry had made a ghostly reappearance in the Garden.
“Sirius is actually testifying for him, and Kingsley—he had to work with them to get everyone in the castle.”
Draco could kick the stone statue of a hippogriff in front of him in frustration. Why wasn’t this working? “Regulus!” he cried out once more.
“Have to give you your pain potions slowly,” she explained as she switched the bags. “You’ll probably feel a bit loopy in a little. Sorry about that.” As the potion began to work its way into Draco the pain began to ease. He heaved a grateful sigh. “We also need to avoid too much magic use on you while you’re regenerating. Only basic scans to not interfere with the process.”
“I don’t love him, Blaise.”
Healer Turner frowned, scribbling in his notes. “What do you mean by strange, Harry?”
Sirius sat himself at the edge of the bed, giving Harry’s hand a light squeeze. “Well you can get to know him all you want now.” Harry just nodded tightly at that, not wanting to speak further. “What triggered your anxiety attack, do you know?” Sirius chanced.
Harry frowned. “I have evidence of it going badly though—Dad hasn’t alluded to any visions.”
“They’re able to repair?”
“Piss off, Malfoy.” Now that stung. He hadn’t heard Harry refer to him as that in a while. Suddenly Harry weaved into the crowd and out of site.
Harry sighed. “I hate rehashing them, Draco. I’m just glad you’re here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise had the audacity to give a chuckle in response, seemingly set free via the thought of Draco falling for Harry. It made sense to him somehow. He kissed Draco on the cheek. “It’s okay, Dray. He probably loves you too. I’m sorry for fucking things up so badly. I want you to trust me, at least as my friend.”
“I think you’re the first person to ever say that. You’re a wonder.”
Lucius was stiffer than usual. This could not be good. “The car is in use, so I had to fetch you myself,” he explained, voice devoid of emotion. His blue eyes stood out starkly against his pallid complexion. Something was not right.
Healer Turner frowned. “It would lose potency—best not. We can talk some meditating strategies, though that may help with rest.”
“And your dad?”
The elder Potter shrugged. “Not sure where he is. Anyway, they almost got caught by Nagini—You-Know-Who was coming. Now they’re off in the woods again.”
“His godson.”
“Antares,” Blaise tried it on his mouth, smiling around the vowels, “where have you been? Haven’t really seen you ‘round school.”
Harry winced in embarrassment, realizing the context. “Oh.”
He hadn’t meant to make a fuss.
“Nope. That’s Harry Potter, that is.”
Dumbledore looked away. “I had my suspicions, which were confirmed after November’s events.”
“He did the same for you.”
"You know of it?" Remus replied, eyebrows shooting into his hairline.
Lucius frowned, not in a position to argue. “I’ve failed him as a father. It’s the most shameful thing I’ve ever done.”
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” he said as he approached. Harry gave a little jump at that.
“Sirius says you’re having some PTSD issues. Nightmares and the like.”
“I think I’ve misunderstood Slytherins for a very long time.”
Draco did not get much more information out of the elder wolf, driving him a little spare. Nobody got the Prophet delivered to the colony, it seemed, and he felt shut out from the world outside of this little bubble. This time, though, he tried not to lament, and instead began exploring the colony as his arm healed, getting to know his clan.
It was James’s turn to shrug. “Odd. Starving. I suddenly have a pulse and am compelled to inhale and exhale after 17 years of that not being an issue.”
“Add it to your list of apologies,” Sirius quipped. Harry winced. “I’m joking—he’s not going to be cross with you. He’ll be happy you’re getting the help you need.”
“My Weasley jumper—it’s so cold here.” Draco avoided his mother’s eyes as he said it, not wanting to see her reaction to the fact that he has been ignoring the blood feud to the point where the Weasleys feel like he’s one of the brood. He was glad his father wasn’t here.
“I can take them up,” Sirius said. “It’s no trouble and you need to stay here for the ceremony, Headmistress.”
Hermione shook her head. “This is getting weirder by the second.”
It's been awhile, hasn't it?
“I love you,” his father said.
Harry frowned. “What does that even mean?”
Harry looked shocked as he stared at James. “I didn’t know that was possible outside the full moon.”
“Is Draco okay?” Harry called out before the older werewolf could fetch Turner.
Draco knelt next to the form, not caring that he was going to be covered in blood. “Harry,” he lamented. He put an ear to his chest. He could barely make out a heartbeat, which was really bad considering his extra-sensitive hearing. “Fuck. Harry, come on.” He then noticed the long gashes down his arms and the knife used to make them. Draco wanted to vomit from the sight.
Ron found Harry on the balcony that was attached to Sirius’s old room, smoking a cigarette from Merlin knows where. “Alright, mate?” he asked, sidling next to him.
“I’m fine, thanks.”
“Nah,” he responded. “I want to catch the Express one last time for the sake of nostalgia. I’ll be fine once we climb aboard.”
. I realized it after the first letter—I’m not mad, I promise. It just made me miss you more.”
“Can we just try again, Draco?” he had asked one night when Draco actually decided to grace the Slytherin Common Room with his presence, Theo be damned.
Remus was about to speak, but Narcissa cut him off. “Draco, Remus has a point. You have to be careful—your gift is wonderful, but you keep hurting yourself in the process. I can’t bear losing you after everything you’ve gone through—what we’ve all gone through.” She grabbed Remus’s hand and squeezed it in silent thanks for taking care of her son despite all of the trouble he gets into. Remus squeezed back in recognition and let go.
Him saying it out loud made reality crash down around him and the tears began to fall again. He felt Remus cautiously wrap his arms around him and he leant in, feeling defeated. He was burning in embarrassment and sadness. His father would whip him if he saw him in such a state.
He spent the moon with them and it was as freeing as he remembered. Running into the woods with the pack was unlike anything he had ever experienced. Not stuffed up in a room, not trapped inside his own mind, but
“You can call me Eric. And it’s honestly no problem. It’s all hands on deck right now with everything anyway. If that’s all I’ll head out.”
“You’re sure?” Remus asked carefully.
Draco glared at him but didn’t protest.
Draco smiled at that. “Alright. But if you don’t get a handle on it soon a Professor is going to march you down to the Hospital Wing and you won’t have a choice.”
“You know of him?”
“I’ve also put a giant ‘X’ on my back for saving him. It’s overwhelming. Everyone is always whispering around us.”
Draco felt some anger leave him as he considered his father’s willingness to admit the need to atone and to have thanks for Remus for picking up the pieces he left behind. “When did you go full turncoat?” he asked.
As everyone settled into the celebration, Draco pulled Harry into a darkened corner, overwhelmed with his magical prowess. It was truly intoxicating and Draco was losing a battle of his senses to it. “You did amazing,” he said. Harry’s eyes were aglow with his magic as he pulled Draco into a searing kiss, onlookers be damned. This only increased Draco’s frenzied response to Harry’s magic, and suddenly he had the urge to Mark him right then and there. Harry’s hands were roaming all over his body, also drunk off of the magic so heavy in the air. Draco began kissing his neck, ravishing him with his tongue and Harry let out a little moan in response, hardening against the blonde’s leg. Draco felt his body begin to shift as Harry pushed him against the courtyard wall, his teeth suddenly feeling too large for his mouth. He froze in panic, causing Harry to begin to kiss Draco’s neck with as much fervor as the blonde was previously administering.
“I’m not worried,” he said unconvincingly.
Harry was becoming more downtrodden by the moment. “I can’t
“Makes sense. You’ve been out for about five days.”
Harry placed the book on his bedside table. “An Order meeting?”
“I feel like I’ve missed an entire side of the Wizarding World,” Harry mused as he listened to Draco describe the details of the event. “It’s like an entire heritage I had no idea about.”
Remus pulled out a fake galleon from his pocket. “Forgot I had this until today—so stupid. Hermione has the other and we can send short messages.”
“Dead?” Draco supplied quietly.
“A bit of him. Inside of me. It’s how I’ve been able to see through to him.”
“You’re
“Good morning 8th years!” Sirius announced loudly, causing McGonagall to flinch. “You may have noticed that you have the mornings free on your schedules: all afternoon classes.”
Jack hummed in affirmation. “You look exhausted. I tried to clean you up a bit, but you’ll definitely need a shower when you’re up for it.”
Ron shook his head. “No, actually.” He made eye contact with Harry, who also looked as though he wanted to jump out of his skin. “I don’t think I can go in.” Harry walked forward and pulled Ron into a tight hug. The war made them all a bit touchy-feely as of late and it helped to be able to have physical touch to remind each other that they were still there together. Ron held him just as fiercely, gripping onto him like a lifeline. “I just know I’m going to see where it happened and I just—I just can’t,” he murmured into Harry’s neck.
The four men were all seated quietly at breakfast when Harry first spoke again.
“He’ll find his way,” Hermione said, following his line of sight. Draco jumped, not realizing she was next to him. He had thought she had gone to see Ron as well.
The next day Harry was sitting at breakfast alone at the edge of the Gryffindor table. Ron was glaring daggers at him from down the table and Hermione looked exasperated. Draco felt guilty. It seemed as though Ron had taken Draco’s side over last night’s mess. He locked eyes with the Weasley in question, who nodded at him in reassurance that they were doing the right thing. Draco wasn’t so sure anymore. Harry didn’t even glance up once from his plate, shoulders hunched as whispers and stares swirled around him.
It was around midnight when Draco finally made a reappearance in their shared room, probably wanting to give Harry some space. He dropped quite a few parcels at the foot of Harry’s bed. “You left these, Mrs. Weasley asked me to take them up for you,” he said.
It was an odd moment for Draco as the three stared at each other for what seemed like minutes. They seemed to be having a silent conversation as Harry awkwardly rolled his sleeves down to hide the bandages. He wasn’t ready for Ron and Hermione to see him like this. He felt ambushed.
“What about Blaise? I’d like to see him, too.”
“And I won’t have you die because you wouldn’t accept my help.” Draco was feeling his magic shoot down his arms as he imagined Harry being in peril. It made him a little dizzy and he willed it back. Maybe he wasn’t as up to the task as he’d like to be.
Harry frowned, thinking back to the mind games of the prior year that led to his godfather’s death. “I guess not.” He suddenly didn’t feel like celebrating any newfound powers to come. “I’m going to go work on summer reading,” he said, standing.
Harry grinned at him. “Impressed?”
Draco flinched a little at that—he could never fully assuage his guilt over his father’s hand in Ginny’s possession. He had apologized to her more times than he could count. “I remember him bringing the diary out of his study in conversation with Theo’s dad. They were trying to decide the best course of action. Mentioned a ring…”
Draco sighed. “It still hurts that he thought that. That he ended things because of it.”
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. “You’ve been here?”
Draco smiled sheepishly. “I feel a lot better, thanks.” He looked over at James, still not convinced his eyes were playing tricks on him.
“It’s okay if you like him, Draco,” Hermione said, resting her hand over his reassuringly.
Harry shrugged again. “Haven’t seen him in a while: he’s nice.”
As he felt himself fading he heard screaming. He saw James’s face, then Regulus’s, then some he couldn’t place. James was gripping his arms tightly and yelling out. Harry felt like it was all too dramatic—he’d be with him in the Garden after all—it couldn’t be so bad. He tried to tell him, but no sound would come out.
Sirius sat with his head in his hands waiting for not only Harry to be released into the long stay wing, but also for James to be checked out by the St. Mungo’s Anomalies staff. It was a good sign that the previously dead man was able to utilize the Floo with no problem, and he didn’t suddenly dematerialize once they left the manor boundary, but Sirius still could not shake the anxiety surrounding the idea that James might just disappear at any moment. He also just knew that the
“You’ll be back in school soon – vices won’t be so easily accessible.”
“I know that. I’m just telling you what it’s been like for me—why this vision has been driving me spare.”
Draco downed it begrudgingly, side eyeing the werewolf all the while. “I’m not a martyr,” he said stubbornly.
“It’s okay,” Harry tried to reassure them. “It’s out of me. Apparently destroying the vessel is the only way to get rid of a horcrux. I might have actually died for a few moments it seems. It did the trick though.”
“We’ll see. I’m going to try and rest. We’ll continue Potter Watch tomorrow, yeah?” Draco said, suddenly very tired.
His parents and Remus had left for a bit to change clothes and purchase books and other things that would occupy Draco for what surely was going to be a long stay. It was when they were off running errands when Harry chose to sneak in.
Harry grinned. “Of course. I’m so glad you get to come to school with me, Remus as well.”
Ron fixed a glare on Blaise. “Really, Zabini?”
Draco scoffed. “Professor, I’m appalled that you would think that I am unable to follow basic instruction. Of course I’ve been taking it.” And he had been. That vile tasting potion had been a regular part of his dinners for the past couple of days. Apparently flavouring the potion would remove its properties, something Draco was resentful of. Maybe he’d foray into potioneering in order to create a better tasting brew.
Harry laughed. “Yes, he’s being rather chivalrous about Parkinson wanting to feed me to Voldemort last summer.”
“Why don’t we take a walk, Mr. Black?” he suggested.
“I’m sorry I brought it up—I just haven’t been able to see anyone and wanted to make sure everyone was alright, considering.”
Jack screwed his face up in concentration. “I’m not sure. He’s a Pureblood, yeah?”
“No. I’m staying up here.”
Harry nodded in understanding. “No, it’s good. I’d still have Him inside me if I didn’t do what I did.” He squeezed Draco’s hand. “Thanks for this.”
Draco, Ron, and Hermione looked between each other a bit uneasily, thinking back to the last train ride they shared. Nevertheless, they made their way to the meeting, hoping Harry was now stable enough to go it alone for awhile.
“Draco isn’t here, I’m afraid,” Harry joked back. Sirius’s eyes lit up a little at the levity of the conversation. It had been a tense time and any bit of humour helped.
Harry gave a lopsided grin in response, leaning against the doorframe. “Please, only your extra-sensitive hearing could’ve heard that.”
Sirius just had a sly grin aimed towards the Irishman in question as he continued. “Mr. Finnigan is correct. Hold your groans. The past year, well years we should really say, were extremely challenging to your education, and especially in the last twelve months, learning wasn’t really the prime mode of existence here, was it? That’s fine, but we need to now catch you up in a way that helps you figure everything out while you’re still here.”
Harry pulled back and gently kissed him, making Draco feel warm and tingly. Lazy morning kisses were much higher up on his daily agenda. “I’m sorry,” Harry said with a sheepish look on his face. “I just had to check that you were here.”
“Fine.” Harry huffed in annoyance but was smiling: it was nice to feel cared for.
“I agree. But my father is very utilitarian in the face of protecting what is his.”
The trio travelled down the stairs to a lovely Christmas morning scene: everyone was gathered around the tree, scoping out presents or eating sweets. Sirius was staring at it in shock. “Where did you manage to unearth
Draco laughed. “No. It’s really special, especially for those of us who don’t connect with the dead as easily as you can. The Veil is lower on Halloween night or Samhain and we invite our lost family and friends to celebrate with us. We keep a fire going, set our altars, and join together.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed at the mention of the magic suppressant. “I know it’s for the best, but I feel vulnerable. There are still followers out there looking to take me out. It makes me nauseous to think that I won’t be able to protect myself.”
“Do you really want to make a scene right now? Late arrivers will be in the hallway at any moment.”
“I kind of like it like that,” Sirius commented, finally coming to life after seeing Harry cleaned up and safe.
He was told to meditate in the days leading up to the moon as it would help in remaining connected to his conscious during the night. A practiced Occlumens, Draco did as he was told quite easily, letting the comfort of mindlessness take over for an hour each day. Nobody around him seemed frightened by the moon, in fact, they seemed excited at the prospect of joining together under the cover of darkness. Even Remus, who he was sure was self-loathing at best, seemed to be happy to be changing with everyone. Draco couldn’t share in their excitement – he was all nerves.
Funerals would begin in the following week, with a large memorial service planned at Hogwarts. They were working on gathering the remaining Death Eaters for trial with the help of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. That made Harry’s interest pique—so they did turn away from Voldemort in the end. Lucius was still subject to a trial but would likely end up on house arrest due to his help in the months leading up to the final battle. Draco would be thrilled.
Draco nodded. “Your uncle told me not to bring you here until winter break. I wanted to bring you in the summer but he said it wasn’t the right time.”
Before his resolve could crack he gave the fireplace a good wrap with his wand, muttering the spell “
“It was only meant to be temporary. James was really upset. He didn’t want to do it: he didn’t want to relegate me to less than a parent. I was willing to do anything to protect them and coaxed him into agreeing. I think we had about two days as parents together before we were Confunded. It was really hard.”
“None.”
“Are you okay?” Sirius asked. “I know being back here can feel quite jarring.”
Sirius shrugged, knowing he too was worn out from the aftermath of the war. “Call me Sirius, please. I will say that the past few days have been an interesting time to say the least.” He drummed his fingers nervously on his armchair—he just wanted to see Harry and make sure he was alive and okay. “So, how is he doing?”
James frowned. “Didn’t Sirius tell you? The Garden healed his Confundus. Apparently it was a plan we all agreed to. I wasn’t thrilled about it, though, I’ll have you know.”
Sirius sighed, frustrated that he was being blocked from his parental duties. “Can I at least try the Dad thing? We’ll have to talk eventually.”
“You were here without me?” Harry was beginning to get upset.
Thanks so much for reading--I know you didn't get too much Drarry focus, but the sequel will have much more of that in store.
“Okay, let’s go then.”
he could help Blaise. He spotted a set of empty vials in the medical shelf.
"You're probably right but I'm just so glad to see you sitting up. Oh, I almost forgot." Remus pulled out a piece of parchment from his robes. "Severus stopped by while you were sleeping. He made me swear that this would get to you. He had to leave quickly." He handed the parchment over. "I checked it for tampering – it seems clean."
Harry kept taking glances at the doors of the Great Hall, half expecting Ron to return to the scene and wishing that he had just gone with him. The tension throughout the feast was palpable, with only the new First Years unaware of the ugliness that this room once held.
Draco didn’t know what to say. Harry was essentially baring his soul to him. “That was the most frightening thing I ever experienced. You with all that blood,” he said.
“I think I’m overly symmetrical now,” Draco agonized, shifting the angle of his face as he continued to observe himself. “I look inhuman – it’s uncanny.”
Draco huffed out a laugh, trying to imagine Remus being anything but cordial. “Sure.” He then became serious again. “I was thinking about returning to school and I’m not sure I want to.”
Draco took the opportunity to lean into Harry, resting his head against his shoulder. It felt comforting to finally have confirmation that he was still breathing after a few days away from him. “I’ve missed you,” the blonde murmured.
Draco rolled his eyes but smiled. “Whatever. Up for a round of chess: is that good enough for your posh Surrey sensibilities?”
“Meeting with Dumbledore. Seriously, read it.”
quite surprised but have been warned. We’re excited to have you back, for Harry’s sake.”
“Please, my Lord,” Lucius coughed out. “I am so sorry.”
Sirius held his hands up in mock surrender. “I’m not here to yell at you, Haz,” he said, sitting on the sofa next to him.
“Not really. We’re both a little fucked up.”
“Yeah for five days.”
“Please, Draco, don’t be so dramatic. It’s only an official disownment. You’ll still have your inheritance, of course.”
Draco closed his eyes. “What if I turned you?”
“To Harry Potter,” everyone echoed. Harry flushed in embarrassment. He truly didn’t deserve this.
“I’m fine—a little strain but nothing I can’t handle. They’re putting me in stasis tomorrow to get the dark magic out.”
Harry procured his cloak from the satchel he insisted on bringing. “Let’s go.”
“He lost a
Draco nodded. That seemed important. They needed to go forward in the best manner possible. “
Regulus’s eyes flashed in some sort of emotion—regret? Anxiety? “Harry, then?”
“Just keep your head up and stay vigilant,” Severus advised. “Look out for those who wish to harm you and take the help of those who offer it. You’re in a good position, out in the open or not. You just need to play it smart.”
That night, he and Ron were quietly discussing what to do about Harry in Draco’s room. Being a Prefect allotted private quarters: the dorm was essentially a long hallway with sets of doors leading off to single rooms equipped with a four poster, a desk, and a window. It was quite nice and quite private, exactly what the two needed to not arise too much suspicion speaking to one another.
Harry drew a shaky breath, and called out his father’s name. “Sirius?” Nothing. He sighed and looked at Draco in exasperation and anxiety.
Draco’s smile turned into a grin, but it faltered as he read Remus’s body language. “Why the long face, then?”
Draco frowned and decided to admit something close to his heart—he felt Bill should know he wasn’t forever a pointy bastard. “The twins were the first to treat me like a human. Even when I was terrible to Ron all those years ago—they caught me on a bad day once in Fifth Year. I was having a panic attack in the hallway on the first night back after dealing with Voldemort all summer. They sat me down in an alcove and breathed with me. I’ll never forget it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, yes, constant vigilance and all that.” Harry huffed in annoyance. “It’s not like your hex work is something to owl home about, is it.”
"Well go be alone somewhere else."
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline at the mention of their Second Year. He was painfully aware of his father’s hand in the whole mess with Ginny and felt a little twinge of guilt every time he thought about it. “That was a horcrux you think?” he asked.
“Did you find out where the others were?”
Harry grabbed a glass and raised it. “To the Order,” he said, not knowing what was coming over him, never one for public speaking but feeling the urge to let them know how much they were appreciated. “I’ve been told over and over that this war was not started in my lifetime but it had to end with me. The Order has kept a beacon of light in times of extreme darkness.” He looked at the Weasleys. “Sacrifices are not just made by the living, although we must bear the heaviness after the storm.” He looked down, feeling a bit overwhelmed.
“I’m sorry,” he said, looking down. “I really messed up didn’t I?”
green,” he slurred. Oh no, word vomit. He looked at Remus helplessly as his Healer laughed. “Did I just say that?”
Harry squinted his eyes in confusion. “Didn’t know I was chained to the hospital bed.”
Classes blurred by as everyone anticipated the upcoming celebration. Most of the Eighth Years planned to attend as well as a few Seventh Years. All Houses were involved in the event, building the altar up in the courtyard with flowers and special objects. Sirius helped them set up large round tables for their own personal feast, and Flitwick charmed glass orbs to float above them, lighting the scene. It was going to be unforgettable.
“What if I really am speaking to the dead?”
Draco nodded. "I've been here only once before – when Aunt Walburga was dying. Not a lot of family was out of Azkaban to take care of her; Mum volunteered. I think I was five."
“Are you trying to kill yourself?” Harry asked him as the Healer settled Draco back into bed. He, too, wasn’t released just yet, still seeing a Mind Healer for long hours every day. It had something to do with having a horcrux inside of him that made the Healers cautious in releasing him too soon. “I thought that was my thing,” he quipped.
"M'fine," he mumbled in response, pulling his face out of his hands. Draco tried to shake himself from his own doom spiraling. "You've pushed a Weasley on me with no warning, I see."
“Soppy Gryffindors,” Draco commented, but was smiling nonetheless.
“How old were you?” Draco interjected, almost regretting asking but fueled by morbid curiosity.
"I'm glad. You shouldn't have to deal with that alone."
Regulus jumped up. “Oh you want to talk to Sirius? I can get him.”
Draco frowned. “Not particularly, ma’am. Ron is having trouble coming to terms with being back after such a short time away. Is it possible for him to go to his dorm? He’s not doing well.” He glanced at Sirius who was now sitting up at attention, concern in his eyes. “I’m not sure if Harry is feeling well either.”
Ginny shook her head. “Don’t be like that, martyring doesn’t look good on you. As for his anxiety, he has Ron and Hermione. Believe it or not, Ron is pretty good with panic attacks: he has a soothing voice like mum when he wants to. He’s been able to talk George off the ledge loads of times and he’s on anxiety potions.”
Harry lifted Draco’s hands and kissed the back of it. “It’s going to go great. Everyone is so excited. You’re doing such a good thing. Hell, maybe Theo will even come.”
Lunch was less eventful, but it was nice to spend time with his Dads, Remus, and Draco all at once. It was like the end of summer all over again. If people in the Three Broomsticks thought the group was odd, none of them cared very much about it, chatting away about hopes for the upcoming school year.
“Sorry.”
Around mid-October, Ron approached Draco with a proposition. He was seated in their Common Room with Blaise and Pansy as he approached. Pansy sat up in interest as the Gryffindors usually left them alone when they were grouped up. “I want to do Samhain this year,” the ginger said. Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline at that. “Will you help me set up the altar?”
It was all Harry could do not to crumble right then and there. “I’m not used to this—having a Dad—a family.” He looked around at everyone in the room. Of course, he always had Ron and Hermione, but he always felt like an intruder in their relationship. This was something special.
“Alright.” He clapped his hands together. “I need to gather plans together for each year so I thought we could divide them up. I’ll take 6
Draco searched his face in concern, eyes crinkling as he sized him up. “Why wouldn’t I be here, Haz?”
“I like this idea,” Draco grinned.
“No, no I’m sorry,” Lucius seemed to shake himself from the initial shock. “I just didn’t realize.”
Remus ran his hand through his sandy hair, not thrilled to be explaining why they were already past that juncture. “He’s had a pretty rough go since you’ve been gone.”
As it began to near towards his 17
“Bye.”
“Yes, yes, very mysterious. Haz, you look peaky: everything alright?”
McGonagall gave another nod. “That would be acceptable, Sirius, thank you.” She smiled at Draco. “Thank you for looking out for your friends, Mr. Malfoy. 10 points to Slytherin.”
Remus nodded, his mind slowly unclouding around the events. “Have Lily adopt Harry.”
Blaise suddenly sobered. “How is he doing?” he asked.
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. I wanted to talk to him about the horcrux thing anyway. I just don’t know how to deal with my feelings towards him.” He leaned into Draco, not caring too much about public displays hidden in a closed train compartment. Draco, however, did, but allowed the Black Heir to rest on him anyway, wrapping an arm around him. Harry began scratching at his hands nervously as he anticipated the meeting. Draco grabbed a hold of them.
“Harry,” Hermione lamented, “it’s going to be okay. We’re going to see sooner or later.”
Draco wasn’t expecting to feel the air suck out of him when he stepped through the Floo into the lobby of St. Mungo’s. He couldn’t help but feel chagrin thinking about the last time he was here—a month’s long stay without the ability to leave the hospital bed had taken its toll. As he took in the bustling hospital, he found himself recognizing some of the mediwitches and wizards who had tended to him and vaguely wondered if they would remember him. It was all too weird.
“Potter has always been angsty—it’s just more directed now.”
“That’s a good lad.” Harry elbowed him in reply.
What was even more disconcerting was Potter’s behavior towards him. After his ridiculous meltdown on the first day, the golden boy had been particularly quiet and withdrawn. Weasley and Granger would attempt to coax Harry into speaking to them and he would just get up and leave the room, befuddling his friends in the process. He, too, began eating at odd hours with Draco and Remus. His wolf seemed to be happy to have Remus around – Draco assumed the first full moon was instrumental in creating a pack mentality with the older wizard, not to mention the very paternal behavior Remus had been exhibiting towards him as of late.
“You make it sound so romantic,” Sirius said with a laugh. “It is fun though. My parents would throw ragers at the Manor in the Garden. Regulus and I would sneak off with as much food as we could carry and throw our own party with our cousins. Sometimes all the families would get together. It’s a much quieter affair nowadays.”
“It’s him, isn’t it? It’s always been him.” The First Years started whispering more excitedly. Blaise turned to them. “Oy, you lot, out.” They grumbled at Blaise but didn’t dare cross an upperclassmen, leaving the room.
“Oh, hello boys!” Harry sighed in relief and stepped back, broken from the taller boy’s spell.
The day Harry had to meet with Dumbledore was the worst. He thought he could keep this newfound alias he came up with, and shed the savior image. He became completely irate when he was told that it wouldn’t work – that it would just be business as usual. He had launched a string of curses at Dumbledore, accusing him of doing this to him – which probably wasn’t far from the truth, regardless of how close the older wizard was keeping his cards to his chest. He stormed out and into his room with a loud bang, forcing Draco out in the dead of night when everyone finally went to bed.
"Well you definitely seem it, Potter," Draco butted in, feeling uncomfortable that the golden trio of all people were at odds. Harry jumped at Draco's voice and Hermione and Ron whipped around to face him fully. Draco raised an eyebrow at their glares. "Hello, friends."
Draco snorted humorlessly. “Maybe the winds blew you in the wrong direction.”
Happy birthday Harry!
Remus laughed without humor. “Yeah, I guess you can say that.”
“Anyway, we didn’t know he was a Halfblood and thought he’d want a Pureblood so we did the most logical thing we could think of.”
“Lo’, Dad,” Harry replied, greeting James, shooting Draco a grin.
“Nothing. I just don’t want to overwhelm him,” Harry lied. The reality, of course, was that the mention of Draco helping in any way made Harry want to tuck him away somewhere where nobody could find him.
“I’ll send up the Healer.”
Draco held him and gently asked, “What’s this now at 6 a.m.?” He didn’t mind the affectionate barrages so prominent in Gryffindors, but having the wind knocked out of him this early in the morning was not high up on his daily agenda. Still, Harry wouldn’t do this without good reason, making Draco a quite worried. “Is everything okay?” he asked.
“He’ll be alright, Rem,” Jack soothed. “But he’s going to have to take really good care of himself between moons. He needs to eat properly, keep up his strength. He won’t survive otherwise. He needs to outfight his genetics.”
“Wish I were—not fun being a living horcrux.”
James sighed, feeling more nervous by the second. “Fine. But don’t be sad when I’m right.”
Draco pulled his hands away again, feeling very tired. “I just don’t. Even though I forgive you about what happened it still messed me up. I can’t trust you like that again. I can’t let myself love you like that again. I’m not letting you hurt me again.”
“We were trying to give you the best shot possible. We didn’t think Voldemort would target a Halfblood over a Pureblood.”
“There’s a breakfast spread in the kitchen,” Sirius said.
Blaise rubbed his face tiredly. “I just wanted to get him something nice. He’s been my best friend since we were five. I was scared when all of that happened,” Blaise admitted. “I assure you it was more of a ‘so glad you’re alive’ gift than a courting gift. He doesn’t want me like that, I’m not daft.”
"It's just I never heard you apologize before. Usually too proud for that," Harry mused.
Draco sat up at that, eyes wide. “I think I was.” Draco shook himself. “I’m sorry. With the moon this close I want to hide you away. The notion of Voldemort having access to you has my brain all fuzzy.”
