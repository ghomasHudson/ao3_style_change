Last he had seen him was when Aunt Vivian agreed to share Pot with Draco due to his indecision between eagles and owls, so that Draco could write to Luna. Pot squawked, and shook a paper out of his beak.
"I don't know. That's more of what British wizards and witches call light magic. I've only learnt to counter Dark magic in Hogwarts, not enact light rituals. Besides, most rituals are considered dark due to its need of sacrifice."
"You've got to be a seeker. For me. Harry Potter's been Dumbledore's favourite for the past few years, Draco, we need to win fairly just this once. Everyone knows you're so
The spell recasted, albeit weakly, Luna moved to stand next to Draco to see what he was pointing at, and there, right after the shadow of Peter Pettigrew barely dissipated, was a brief flicker of Millicent Bagnold.
Jason Olse lived the first 20 years of his life by the port of Oslo, Norway. His father, the 45th Head of the House of Fawley, was a common man with a respectful job, and the sole heir to the name as one of the House of Fawley's last remnants after most lost their lives to Grindelwald's cause. Jason grew on the tales of his father succeeding every tribulations of the War to becoming an unsuspecting member of a society which, had no magic or power to its name but conviction.
"I suppose, in muggle terms, this was the point where everything was dark. But when the two worlds were separated and the remains of wizards and witches licked their wounds in peace, the first imposer of the Statue of Secrecy, Josiah Jackson, appeared as the leader of MACUSA on American soil. Then, came the British with the Law Enforcement Acts, the French with International Relations, and so on. You should note, if you are ever in need out of trouble, that Gondulphus Grave's real name happens to be Nojan Fawley."
"No," Luna suddenly shot up from her seat, "Monsieur Chartres came over on the 1st of June. He died after meeting Bartemius Crouch on the 2nd. Millicent Bagnold was found dead on the 3rd when
"He has a wife. He's alive, most importantly. If he knows anything, did anything, the people around him should know too. Combing through his tracks shouldn't be hard."
Flipping onto a knee on his broom, Draco narrowed his eyes at the salaud. He didn't notice the gasp behind his ears, the collective hush across the stands, because in that brief moment of insanity he dropped the most minimal occlumency barriers he maintained.
"Merlin's balls," Blaise muttered as he gently pried the newspaper away from Luna's hands, "if Sirius Black is an animagus, what's the say the wizard who got killed isn't? Susan, your theory would make much more sense."
"So tell me all you know of Regulus Black, because I have been told he went missing upon fleeing from Voldemort and was last seen in confidence of Voldemort's fall. I need what he had, because if my family comes to ruins, and His wand is pointed in my mother's face, I would be the last to stand between the Boy-Who-Lived, the Ministry, and Voldemort, should it mean my own death!"
"I may not be interested in Quidditch, but a majority of the students join Aerodynamics because Viktor Krum is the demonstrator."
"You leapt off a broom. Maybe the Wrackspurts got into your head through your ears, or maybe Marcus gave his Nargles to you, because they're more active around this time of the year, but cousin, you weren't even protected!"
The magic washed over the classroom in every direction. The rat scattered around however, between smaller obstacles which leaped and stabilised over its body. As soon as it escaped Draco dragged a series of explosions with his hand and a curse on his mouth to chase its path, popping all books aside as it darted around the corners, until one explosion landed squarely in its middle. It squealed again, but gathered itself once more and sped to the nearest crack in the wall.
"Sorry," came the apology after a few minutes of recalibration on both sides, "truly, that was reflex."
Draco Malfoy didn't have time beyond his school activities, and duties as the unspoken representative for exchange-students, to drown himself between shelves and shelves of books and books. He didn't, reasonably due to bed at a time all logical thirteen-years-olds were due, but Ernier Fawley who'd once lived through being a Pavilion representative, Quidditch chaser, guide of all lost students of Durmstrang, and Aunt Vivian's training to Uncle Jason's violation of knowledge, knew best to work on four hours of sleep at large.
Blaise had never seen Draco cry. It was further accurate to say he assumed most of Draco's emotions were fabricated, with the amount of occlumency which possessed his mind, and he assumption was truer than to his liking. Neither had he seen an emotion so strongly expressed as the red flush falling down his cheeks, or the wide glare of his eyes, he didn't know how to react.
Draco's face altered between disgust and mock horror before he, too, turned to check who was approaching them.
"Draco. You know there's an illegal portkey at Paralia Legrenon. He's heading towards us, not further. You're more likely to arrive in Albania the moment he leaves. Unless," Luna stepped closer threateningly, "you're planning to see him with your own eyes."
"She's having some issues with her brother," Draco exclaims in delight, "here's the main gossip, though, I think she's going to be headmistress."
"Yes. The very one. He was quite popular for being able to do a flip on his broom in his aerodynamics class last year. He was scouted into an actual Quidditch team, and the training has made a masterpiece out of him. Just
The Headmistress was absent from the front tables lined with silver embroideries, the sole difference from their white ones. There wasn't much to differ in extravagance. A thin, pale man rose from professor's table, and the hall obligingly fell hushed from front to back with a single glare from the man's brown eyes.
Then, Harry had bumped right into him at the Great Hall one bright, summer morning, just as the leaves were turning yellow.
"Young Miss Vivian never told me how to greet anyone, Young Mister Malfoy. Master Olse simply told me to respect his wife's blindness, so I tend to make such entrances out of habit. I'll try to remember your preference, Mister Malfoy, if you need."
"Like lovers. She has a strong belief that Jason must relieve his sexual needs someplace else when she is right by him."
Settling, finally, into the seat he had long considered his own Draco realigned the blinds as he waited. He pulled out a book, dozed, and was beginning to fall deaf when a knock rattled the fragile glass. The door opened before he could permit entry.
"I am attempting to refrain from allowing his impulse to drive him headfirst into the position. But I did hope, despite the conclusions he may inevitably come to, greeting his own father would give Erlnier quite the adventure."
"While you've been taking a very well-meant break," Luna glanced at Draco, "I've drawn the rabbits and carrots, giving the Wrackspurts excuses to attach themselves. So, I'm going to use this only interlude to brighten my hair."
Hogwarts battered against his magic, the castle probing into his core, the atmosphere turning thicker, of an overbearing love. Hogwarts was worried, he found, the wind was curling against its walls faster than it had been and the cardigan flapped against his head. Draco smiled reassuringly.
Considering that this was his first interaction with someone around the same age as him, no matter the many older friends he had made in Durmstrang, Draco could admit he was nervous. Not quite, however, apprehensive.
"Hasn't it ever occurred to you that Malfoy the senior would have a higher sway amongst the members of the court than yourself? All you've managed to do was to place him in his house, and I'd have rather placed him with Sirius Black. He will walk out of there sane, and with vengeance." Catherine tugged the strands of her hair.
The elf's hiding place was small. Smaller than his form, and stank of rusty metal. Kreacher climbed in, still muttering, digging pieces of jewellery out of jewellery, until a soft silence washed over him.
Draco hastily caught the bag thrown his way. He was pulled, tugged, and pushed into the Great Hall, still hesitant as to why his lack of sleep couldn't be fixed on a bed, until he realised Professor Snape's sadism dictated students' punishment to be announced at the beginning of the next week on early Monday to make them suffer throughout.
They assembled in the Oval Dining Hall, a fair walk from the lodgings that Draco reassured Blaise would get used to. The Oval Dining Hall was as the name indicated, with round tables and chairs. It seemed to have been made for the sole purpose of having them mingle, as they were crowded towards the middle rather than lining the walls. They were bound to, even as they scraped their chairs from under the tablecloths, bump into one another or reach for the second table's wares.
There had been a time when he, loaded with Miss Catherine's mind chaos of the night, went to class too tired to think by his mind and, ultimately, surprised the Professor by responding to questions far out of his league. That was when he'd developed the four-hour policy.
And it had to be, as their scuffle hadn't been small by any means, and the house could only separate them so far. He was taken underneath a hole under the house's loose rocks, dragged by his cuff through a tunnel none would have been able to cross but by lying down, and was released in a room too dim.
Draco wrote and sat back on his chair. He stuffed the parchment under a book, and started anew. Something raw pushed against his occlumency walls, straightening his posture.
No-one bothered him in the Stamp-Room. To them, the papers which strung from ceiling to floor was a sorry sight, and the machine which whirled the papers into rolls were too loud. Somehow, there was always a fault to find within the room, for most save him and Agatha, who were tasked to switch in blank paper rolls when necessary. And to his due, he did his job of sorting records into place very well by giving more effort and precision than anyone, but only well with enough sleep.
"How similar is it to the stuff I've been learning?" Draco looked at Aunt Vivian, who didn’t answer and remained buried in a paper.
"I'll be teaching you the physical aspect. Vivian will be teaching magic duelling, once you've finished learning your stances with me. Both of you. Luna, you’ll have to learn the basic stances and modify them as you wish after adjustment. A woman's body is different from a man's in structure."
Being handed Fillia's wand of unicorn hair and firm willow, she jabbed it into the air with her palm faced downwards. There were so many things she could do for Draco and much less internationally considering her elevated position. But the ministry's council was something she could sway, an International board quite logical in their decisions, quite progressive, Vivian found herself turning her thoughts inwards towards Durmstrang itself.
"Not something as precious to be called hereditary, but something valuable nonetheless because there isn't another pair of these two in the world. Magic is powerful but not indefinite. There are limits of an individual that cannot be crossed, which is why most devolve to rehearsed body fights. What makes everything better, is a weapon." Jason tapped the edge of Draco's blade.
"I fear death. The fall of the House of Fawley. Besides, I highly doubt you've ever heard of a younger Flamel other than I?"
"Karkaroff has his own authority. You are attempting to sway a private institute which is kept separate from much domain with but the support of those in-bred families."
His uncle's words had been the decisive reason behind his current plea, although he had grown a major love towards Durmstrang as a home.
Draco turned, and came face-to-face with Hermione Granger. She looked more tired than she had been the day before, with grass and twigs sticking out of her hair. It seemed she'd skipped lunch, as her usual boys weren't around either. Draco glanced at Blaise, and Blaise nodded.
It was silence which greeted Erlnier when he first met Chartres de Barr, his beady eyes assessing and his wrinkled face creasing into dissatisfaction. He didn't have the urge to prove himself, as he usually would have wanted, and instead grimaced back. They had not seen each other since.
When they entered the hall devoid of any tables but the students which lined its walls, Draco waved imperceptibly towards the few who enthusiastically greeted him. It was his first official day as a student of Durmstrang, and the older students, similarly those who were on the verge of leaving, was only fond to see him as one of their own in a different manner.
When Catherine purposely clinked her teaspoon against the cup, Jason rolled his eyes quite pointedly behind his sister for Draco to see and hide a smile at.
Rather, he had to leave with the information Sirius Black had given, and had no time when midnight was a quarter away.
It had taken Luna two years to connect one staple, unmoving wall in her Hogwarts room to Draco's room 21-22 in Durmstrang. The entire process had involved all every physical and inanimate form of magic they could dream of, and in the duration, Luna had to pass the checkpoint between Burton Alley and Glisy by travelling all the way to Kingston within an hour.
"It's midnight," Blaise questioned, "can't we push the plan back? There's enough time for the end-of-year celebrations."
"I must have you know those are usually reserved for dealings with lawyers outside of court, and that the accuser does not have the right to speak freely with the testifier, and that I've broken so many rules for the two of you, that you should be expecting a charge. At the least a formal warning."
"Yes. The first face people see, will be them. The second, a few records. Third, an ancestral joining of the sacred twenty-eight through many, many bloodlines, and fourth, the finished line of the Flamel through myself. Fifth, our dear Jason from a muggle family, and where else could they go but run to a dead end? It's the reason the Heads are unaffiliated by blood but talent."
"Crouch Junior was known to be devoted follower of Voo-doo. If there was an intruder which approached the house with ill-intent, with the kind of magic Bartemius Crouch has and his ownership over Winky, the house elf, both should have noticed. But Bartemius Crouch and his elf didn't notice until sounds came from his son's room, which means someone went there to approach his son for help or pleasantries. Neither seems possible, does it? So whoever it was didn't have enough magic to be noticed, at all."
"I've thought there was nothing to be learnt from children," Amelia Bones said as she cornered the man by several steps, "but I've been proven wrong."
"Fillia Flammel DeVann, on behalf of the Representatives of the European Union of Institutions, Victoria Ivan Velderwick, and Crisvoden Conner Chaeor, greet you Miss Vivian Fall, and would like to cordially extend a seat to our meeting as the previous representative of Durmstrang and honorary member of Uagadou, to be reinstated as the Headmistress of Durmstrang. Please, rest assured, as your status as a representative and honorary member will not and cannot be revoked. This is an urgency in need of your most immediate attention, as Igor Karkaroff has been reported missing as of the ninth hour, and the seat must not remain vacant. Would you come with us?"
"You've left us to think the dog was yours. Perhaps a warning of danger would have sufficed before we left the protection of Hogwarts?"
"You'll be requested," Joheim said as they stepped out of the Reception Quarters, "to oversee minor things, such as initial discomforts about their immediate partner or fist fights which should emerge in a month's time. The title will not be 'redistributed', as you have so put it, and the Pavilion will list you as one of the possible alumni to contact after your graduation for the Pavilion's lessons. But, you're a representative for the Pavilion, not the education sector, hence you won't be living in the Yellow Lodgings."
Professor Flitwick stared at Luna as though he was seeing her anew. Perhaps he was, as Luna was most known for her incomprehensible speech and actions. Draco observed the professor's assessment in turn, realising the man was sharper than his first impression. (Flitwick was the best dueler, charms caster, and professor of charms. He was better than Milanda Quento, who was held the position prior to Flitwick, and was known to have won a duel against Ioan Rye Illian, their current Professor of Duelling at Durmstrang.)
Luna's hand came up to his shoulder. Draco didn't turn to look at her but sighed in frustration as he tipped his head back. The Great Lake rippled.
Matthew, forgotten in Draco's perspective and clearly startled, snapped his fingers before Draco's eyes.
. Draco blinked as she drank the wine from the bottle. His mother would have commented, had she been saner, of how crude her manners were but she was pulling out a fermented
"Mother, last I've talked to her and not with a letter, told me the British M's sent dementors to the school. Other than being concerned about Luna, she has written me about how uncomfortable it makes her which surely is an understatement, I've gotten an offer for a one-on-one training session with the students at the end of this Quidditch holiday match so I hardly have time to care about those dementors. Viktor's got an offer on the Bulgarian Quidditch Team, which leaves us rather bleak. A private potions competition next week hosted at the Black Wing, I need to start my application for the Crow's Head for this year, and Matthew needs help growing pumpkins for some reason."
Vivian opened her eyes, which had closed in partial agitation while she had talked on of political changes within different ministries, and found the headmaster at the door. She came to her feet with practised poise and pointedly glanced once towards Pot, her eagle, who blinked its eyes at the students, who in turn resumed their scratching.
"Siblings fight all the time. I've seen you fight with your friend once over a box of chocolates, there's nothing too different in the way we argue."
"The House of Fawley does leave evidence of our existence. A student with the name of Fawley, a minister with the name of Fawley, houses, books, records. We've never disappeared from the public eye as a part of the sacred twenty-eight, but we've similarly never revealed the depths of our influence. The ones we leave in the public are ostracised, they live unknown to us and us unknown to them."
"Take it as a gift, and send your regards, Draco. He is your father, and he loves you as much as your mother."
As for the intruder, Erlnier sighed, carefully moving his levitation off Crouch's grounds, that was something he had to think on.
"That's why you brought them instead of Hermione?" Pansy yawned as she whispered the password, "she wouldn't have been asking politics."
"They'd better get used to it," Draco said as he smiled back, "you've most certainly changed from when I first met you. It's already been two months."
"Then, this is Peter Pettigrew. Animagus, aide of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, traitor to the House of Potter, and ex-friend of Sirius Black." Draco began, "we are presuming the rat, in the case of his missing toe and the similarity found in Peter Pettigrew's only finger found at the past site of event, is the evidence to figuring out Sirius Black's innocence despite small and unlikely. He is, after all, a madman at this point, having spent years amongst Dementors. If you could assist in the revelation, and please do not wake him from the immobilus and sleeping charm I've placed, Sirius Black might likely be proven a better guardian for Harry Potter."
Draco closed his eyes, and leaned forward until his forehead touched the wood. The Bound-Swing was something Viktor had been imagining for some time, but found unable to perform with his heavier, taller body. He'd recommended it to Draco who was less worked up, smaller, and lighter, in hopes of satisfying his own dream to at least, see it being performed live. Viktor, Draco thought, would be cursing up a storm if he knew Draco pulled it off at Hogwarts.
They disappeared with a second click, while Draco was left reeling at what had been a tower of papers which reached his head.
"My mother's correspondences have increased, including several letters to answer over the week. You've got new creases around your eyes." Blaise noted, and indeed, there were faint marks on their faces which hadn't been, and darker skin throughout. Had it not been for the proximity Blaise wouldn't have noticed.
Draco watched his father lean back into his chair, his posture unmoved from the sudden support lining his back. They stared at one another, Draco wishing for an indication of his future.
Aunt Vivian stilled when Draco and Blaise turned to glare at her, observing their faces as though it was to be the last to see them. And before she stepped off the moving train, before she walked away, she stroked their hair, once, to whisper, "you truly do look different."
"Considering how the dog was the only abnormality on the field, aside from the dementors, it would be disappointing for neither to be unrelated. Unfortunately, personal disappointment came from the headmaster rather than the dog."
"There's two main rumours about him. One says he's been living quite the life in a secure location, praised as the one who defeated him. Another says he'd gone into hiding, and where better could he go than the muggle's world where none would care to search? It's obvious now," Blaise squinted as he held the newspaper closer, "he's been kept unhappy."
Catherine's cheeks turned lightly red, and her blue eyes which remained sparkling even between the grey skies and the shadows of the clouds gleamed brighter. It was quite astounding how her beauty was flawless when she claimed to have done nothing to her skin. She clenched a fist against her green summer dress and glared.
They took down the fields, running towards the tree. Vaguely, Draco wondered how Blaise would find them, if at all. Their shoes were soon muddied, clothes creased, and sweat was beading down their necks before they reached the Whomping Willow. Luna immediately rushed for a branch.
The students glanced at each other before coming to an agreement, with Draco at their forefront, Filius noted, as he made to speak.
"The Pavilion's representatives are responsible for social matters. The school's representatives oversee the educational and larger problems, like class assignments, in collaboration with the professors. The Pavilion is made up from top to bottom of students, and there are often invited alumni to hold sessions on the greetings and social niceties of certain parts of the Wizarding World. Last, the German Minister came to talk about what manners are required for an official hearing in the German court."
There was another rumour around the school which spoke of how the eagle which sat so calmly on its perch near Professor Vivian at all times was actually a spirit which the professor had caught and confined to an eagle's body. It wasn't the most pleasing theory which ruminated, but its story was quite popular amongst the younger students. Who began to exchange glances that very moment, and was quelled by a knowing glance of the infuriated Professor.
"I was wondering if I should save you," Luna commented as she made him sit, "but everything sounded so clean."
Vivian looked around the classroom, at the glittering stares of her students she had come to care for, at the curious stare of her Draco, and the beady eye of her eagle. She made time hold its breath within the classroom, and took the moment to bemoan this life with closed eyes.
"Now, Blaise," Pansy clawed Blaise's shoulder, "we've been waiting for your return. It's less than polite to leave us waiting, don't you think? Perhaps an introductory greeting of your fellow friend for us to tear into?"
I wondered what a writer's block was before, but I know it now. The past two chapters were hard to write :(
"The Blue Wing does receive applications for Aerodynamics classes until the end of next week." A girl added as she twisted in her seat, "Vice Captain of the Quidditch team at Durmstrang, nice to meet you."
More importantly, he now found himself terrified when the girl did not confirm his suspicions. He had learned silence was an act of admittance, after all.
"Only you would criticise the Head of Fawley with such venom, grand-père. But I do request you to exchange the headmaster of Durmstrang with yourself."
"Hiding a tree in the forest or something," Draco muttered, "a sheep with wolves and rats with holes."
"The next time Tea comes to me with a question of your sanity, Merlin forbid, your mother will be the one to fish you out of Hogwarts."
“So, ummm,” Potter cleared his throat. “Now that we’ve… cleared things out, how do you feel about helping me end this stupid old rivalry once and for all?” Potter leaned forward and offered up his hand. “Friends?”
“The Slytherclaw Chaser, Theodore Nott, is now holding the Quaffle which he literally picked up from the ground. I’m not sure how I feel about that but let’s go easy on these people. He’s heading for the Gryffinpuff goalposts – yeah, good luck with that! – sorry! – and we have Susan Bones and Justin Finch-Fletchley right at his tail – he AIMS, SHOOTS, and … well, Ronald Weasley easily catches the Quaffle with one hand which was … predictable.”
“Oh, good morning Harry!” Granger looked up from her copy of the Daily Prophet with a nervous-looking smile. “Malfoy.” She acknowledged Draco politely.
On their way to the Great Hall, Draco clenched his jaw shut to keep himself from saying anything that could give him away – only nodding at Potter’s small talk and warm smiles like an imbecile – and tried to make sense of the situation he was in.
“No you’re not. At least not anymore, and that’s enough for me.” The words sounded so honest when they came out of Harry’s mouth, like they were pouring right out of his heart. “And I never said you were perfect. Neither of us is perfect, Draco. We’re flawed, but we complete each other. We don’t have to be perfect individuals to be perfect
an idiot, Malfoy. I have nothing to do with that.” He muttered, before standing up and walking back to his own desk.
Startled, Draco turned around to see Harry, wrapped in a worn leather jacket, standing alone just a few paces away from him. Draco couldn’t do it. He wasn’t brave enough, he was a bullshitter.
“I think I’d be okay. That’s the best kind of closure I could hope for, anyways.” He shrugs, momentarily thrilled by the idea of kissing Potter.
Harry had told him that night, as he held Draco and pressed their foreheads together, the cool scent of his body like a protective bubble all around Draco, keeping him safe.
Potter turned his attention to somewhere behind Draco’s ear, gritting his teeth. “That fucking bastard,” he spat.
“Professor, can you stand?” Draco heard Potter say, his own heart threatening to jump out of his throat with adrenaline.
, Harry!” Slughorn cried, clutching his burned groin with both hands. Most of the students had gathered around him now, mostly blocking Draco’s view.
Draco’s breath was coming in short and shallow gasps. He stood there for several seconds, letting the shock of what he’d just remembered wash over him. He had broken his promise to himself and taken the Sweet Agony. And if the potion had truly worked as it was supposed to, it could only mean that at the moment, Draco was in an alternate reality with an altogether different – and by the looks of it,
“But I keep failing them, Draco,” Harry closed his eyes and drew his eyebrows together. “Some of them die and there’s nothing I can do for them.”
Draco, how do you feel? Are you in any pain?” Pansy was by his side the next moment, taking his hand into both of her own.
Potter smiled at him, reaching into the pocket of his trousers. “Oh, actually I have something of yours,” he pulled out a polished piece of hawthorn wood out of his pocket.
Potter led him to the middle of the dancing crowd, wrapping his bare arms loosely around Draco’s waist and burying his nose in Draco’s hair. “You know you look cute as
The red-and-gold team arrived at the same time with Potter on the lead, his athletic body pulling off the scarlet Quidditch robes better than anyone else. He gave Draco a tiny smile that was equal parts friendly and challenging; Draco tried to return it.
He had been a selfish bastard in the past months (and maybe long before that, if he was being honest with himself) and a horrible friend. Draco had let himself be carried away from everyone and everything by the force of his guilt and sorrow. He had let himself sink further and further in the ocean of his regrets and self-pity, and become a soulless corporality of all the negative emotions in the universe.
“So, me and a bunch of others are going to Hogsmeade after class to smuggle in some Firewhiskey for the party tonight and then set up the last of the decorations, and I know you need to take your time to get ready so I won’t ask you to come with us.” Potter rolled his eyes at him good-naturedly. “So, I think we won’t be able to hang out today after class. But I will collect you at half past seven for the party. Okay?”
Draco’s unfocused gaze landed on a pair of shining emeralds only a breath away from his own face, and suddenly stupid, smug confidence was spilling out of every pore in Draco’s skin.
“I got you, gorgeous,” Harry groaned, pressing open-mouthed kisses on Draco’s collar bone and down his chest and belly, tracing the thin line of dark blonde hair from his belly button to his flushed cock.
Wait, that’s not how this works! Potter is not supposed to ask Draco whether he wants to be kissed by him! The whole point of this plan was for Draco to kiss Potter
Lip-locked and entwined, they stumbled into a dark, empty classroom in the east wing, Harry elbowing the door closed behind them, guiding Draco backwards until his back hit the edge of the teacher’s desk.
“… and win the war so you and your pureblood friends would be the only ones left in this school. Isn’t that what you wanted to happen when you offered to hand over Harry Potter to the Dark Lord, Parkinson?” one of the girls was saying, crossing her arms and looking at Pansy with disgust.
“Professor I really need to go, I’m late for class. I’ll catch you later. Sorry. Have a great day!” Draco is already halfway across the corridor from Slughorn and shouting at his direction. He doesn’t hear Slughorn’s response over the pounding of his heart in his ears as he pushes people out of his way to DADA class.
The two of them ran back to the castle and then up the stairs all the way to the seventh floor, not slowing down for a second. When they got to the seventh floor, Harry finally came to a stop in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy – now snoring loudly in his sleep.
Draco realizes that he too is shaking, but from the sheer force of his anger. He’s clenching his fist so hard, he’s sure he’s gonna have half-moon marks on his palms for the rest of the day.
Draco’s eyes flutter shut at the sensation of Potter being this close and his next breath escapes him in a shuddered exhale. Potter’s lips on his are chapped and rough and Draco couldn’t have
Draco had always been good in suppressing his emotions and denying essential parts of himself; that was why he’d mastered Occlumency so easily. But now that he had let himself love and be loved for the first time in maybe ever, it was like seeing a ray of sunlight after living a lifetime in stark darkness. And the emptiness it left Draco with when it was snatched back from his grip was a permanent ache.
The party stretched out until eleven and by the time the two of them left the place in favor of a walk in the school grounds under the silver moonlight, a pleased little smile was carved on Draco’s lips with no intentions of disappearing anytime soon.
Draco gives her the closest thing to a smile he can manage and spends the next five minutes absentmindedly looking for his DADA book in his backpack before Pansy finally pulls it out for him.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Potter said, tucking the wand back in his pocket.  They sat in silence for a few minutes, Draco internally repeating Potter’s words to himself with childish glee –
“Oh really?” Millie said, raising her trimmed eyebrows. “Then why do I think that I can pull off red lipstick far better than you, darling?”
Harry had promised to be there when he woke up. He’d swore that he’d never let Draco go. But the next morning, Draco had woken up in his own bed, shaking and miserable and all alone.
“An angry kitten,” Draco finished the sentence involuntarily, his breath catching in his throat and gaze sewn to Potter’s surprised expression.
Potter’s green gaze caught Draco’s for a moment – an abstruse look in his eyes – before he broke the eye contact and turned around, leaving the two perplexed Slytherins behind without another word.
He slid his hand into the hidden pocket on the inside of his trunk and pulled out the black velvet box.
Potter rolls his eyes at him again but this time, the bright emerald orbs are sparkling with mischief. “Fine.”
… don’t stop,” Draco babbled, tightening his grip on Harry’s toned shoulders and – as Harry started thrusting into him with brutal force – biting down on the flesh of his flexing shoulder to muffle his cries.
When the two captains approached each other and shook hands, Madam Hooch stepped back and readied her whistle. “Mount your brooms!” she ordered. “Three … two … one …”
when you see what I’m going to wear for the Halloween party tonight. I’m gonna be stealing the spotlight from all you bitches.”
“Potter, I…” Draco started, but the words died in his throat as his eyes landed on a head of shiny black hair leaning over the Gryffindor table, looking down at something on the table over Granger’s shoulders.
“Are you sure you want to go home for Christmas?” Pansy asked him for the third time that day. They were all sitting at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall for their last dinner of the year at Hogwarts. “I just think that, for the sake of your mental health, it would probably be best for you to stay away from the Malfoy Manor as much as possible.”
“It still doesn’t make sense, though,” said Justin. “Malfoy’s not in a position to beat up another student and get away with it, and he knows it. Especially Ernie who’s been waiting for an opportunity to get Malfoy expelled ever since he saw him on the train.”
The picture had clearly been taken through the front window of Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop in Hogsmeade. It showed Potter and Draco sitting at a small table, facing each other. Potter reached out and took Draco’s hand in his own, kissing his knuckles, and Draco smiled at him, reaching with his other hand to brush a blonde piece of hair out of his eyes. He looked so…
!” Draco protested, trying to sound threatening, but the proximity of Potter’s body and the scent of him filling Draco’s lungs smoothed out the sharp edges of his tone, so it came out as a weak mumble. He rested his cheek on Potter’s shoulder and quietly breathed him in; they stayed like that for several minutes.
! We’re Eighth Years for fuck’s sake. These kids are supposed to look up to us,” he threw his hands out. “Now they’re just going to laugh at us for the rest of the school year!”
“What is that on your desk?” Slughorn squinted, only just seeing the piece of parchment and rounding Longbottom’s desk to stand in front of Potter.
“I know,” Draco assured her, his mouth twitching into the tiniest smile. “Where would I be without you, Pans?”
When they finally broke the kiss – their lips still touching when they spoke – Draco opened his eyes to a set of magnificent emeralds melting away all his sorrows and regrets.
On their way to the dungeons, Pansy and Blaise gave Draco some space, talking about the Halloween party they were planning to throw in the Slytherin common room tomorrow and how they didn’t want to participate in the joint house party the other Seventh and Eighth Years were going to throw together anyways.
Draco had joined the team more than a month later than the others, and by then, the captain had already been chosen. And since he and Greg were the only ones on the team who had actually played Quidditch before, Greg was now their captain.
“The Manor’s a big house,” he said in a cold but even voice. “Unfortunately for you, you never got the chance to see the inside but it’s an amazing place to spend the rest of one’s life in. If it’d been somewhere like this place that my father had been sentenced to live in,” Draco made a show of looking around in distaste. “Now that would be just sad.”
Potter runs the tip of a pink tongue across his bottom lip. “Raspberries.” He murmurs, frowning a little.
“Hell yes, we do.” Potter falls into steps beside Draco. “For example, about what happened last week. I’ve wanted to talk to you about that since the day it happened, but since you’ve been so busy avoiding all interactions with me, I haven’t gotten the chance yet.”
Potter was dressed exactly like Draco; the same brown leather sandals with straps curling around his tanned calves all the way up to his knees, the same plain white, sleeveless toga, and the crown of green laurel leaves resting on his messy black hair. The only difference between their costumes was the short, purple cloak pinned to Draco’s left shoulder that indicated the superiority of his character’s rank over Potter’s.
“Okay, Ron, just leave it,” Potter told Weasley before putting on his grey shirt and taking a couple of steps closer to stand in front of Draco. “Malfoy, when you go crazy at people like that, you have no idea how much you remind me of…”
“Yeah, think I’d like that,” Harry murmured. Draco could feel his long erection pressed against the small of his back.
“Malfoy I…” Potter tilted his glasses up to his scarred forehead, rubbing his eyes. “You’re forgiven.” He said simply, and Draco’s heart missed a beat.
!” Pansy phonated a few seconds later in an attempt to lighten the mood. Draco finally looked away from where his empty gaze was sewn to the spot Potter had been standing on, back to her. Pansy quickly bushed away a tear from her left cheek, but Draco had already seen it.
“Catch,” Potter said, and threw him something that flashed gold in the air before Draco closed his pale fingers around it. “I caught it for you, it’s yours.”
“You didn’t have to intervene, Potter,” Draco said, fighting to keep his voice even. It was so hard for him to look at Potter without recalling that one, blissful day that they’d spent together; one that
Draco shrugged. “It wasn’t hard to guess that you probably wouldn’t want someone like me anywhere near your godson,”
“I think that if you want to lay claim on someone,” Draco said, raising his voice over Harry’s groan of protest. “You should do it properly. Come on, Potter. I get this feeling that you can do far better than just a kiss.”
!” Draco bleated, a ragged huff escaping his lips that sounded more like a sob than a laugh. He took a step forward and opened his arms, but Pansy quickly put a hand on his chest, stopping him.
Draco just stared at him, his palm holding the warm golden ball possessively. And he tried, he really tried not to lighten up like an obsessed twelve-year-old – he was supposed to be pissed, for Merlin’s sake! – but the helpless smile that was tugging at his lips was impossible to hide.
When they’d started Eighth-Year at Hogwarts all those years ago, Harry had thrown himself in his schoolwork and lessons in order to distract himself, and without all the Voldemort-related bullshit to weight him down – as old Slughorn put it – the Evans genes had kicked in. By the end of the year, he’d had his options fully open for his future career. And since Draco and Harry had been dating for a few months by then, Draco had convinced him to turn down his offer at the Auror Program and start training with him in St. Mungo’s instead. It had been the second best decision of his life after marrying Harry. Harry was an amazing Healer.
They ran inside the castle and up the stairs, occasionally stopping for long and messy snogs against a wall, and when they were running again, Draco couldn’t feel his feet hitting the ground under them, like he was weightlessly floating a few inches off the floor, and maybe he was.
The sound of Pansy’s voice cut through the haze of unconsciousness in Draco’s mind. Draco couldn’t make sense of her words yet, but the concern and distress in her voice was tangible.
A distant voice in the back of his mind screams at him, but Draco tunes it out as he pulls the corner of his mouth to form the ugliest sneer he can muster. He is pathetic, he knows it (Have known it for quite a long time, actually), but he convinces himself that it is okay to openly stare at Potter as long as he makes sure Potter thinks it is purely out of spite and nothing else.
“It’s fine, Potter. I’m fine. No need to sweat it,” he said, gently tugging his robes out of Potter’s strong grip.
He was ten minutes early for Charms, and the classroom was mostly empty except for a couple of Ravenclaws who didn’t even look up from their books when he entered. Draco threw his bag at the foot of a desk in the back of the classroom and sat down, crossing his arms on the desk and resting his forehead between them. He could still feel a dull pain in his chest and the start of a headache on the back of his eyes.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter,” Draco brushed him off casually, hoping Potter would just move on from the subject.
Walking out of the Great Hall with Blaise and Pansy that night after dinner, Draco’s eyes slid to a head of messy black locks still sitting at the Gryffindor table with an arm around the Weasley-girl’s shoulders.
; Draco noted with disappointment. “We’re already late.” He wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist – making his entire body stiffen with surprise – and led the way.
Draco had already stripped off his jacket and tossed it – along with Harry’s – somewhere in the hallway outside the classroom, and now his impatient fingers were blindly working the button of Harry’s jeans as he pressed bruising kisses all over Draco’s bare neck.
. He gulped down his nerves and started walking alongside the rest of his team to the middle of the field where Madam Hooch was awaiting them.
“Look, I’ll just get straight to it.” Potter said; a determined but somehow annoyed look in his bright green eyes. “I saw you yesterday; with Ernie. And I know you could have countered that spell with your eyes closed. I’ve seen you duel before and I know that you could have fought back, but you didn’t. Why didn’t you fight back, Malfoy?”
“Harry…” Draco closed his eyes, a single stubborn teardrop escaping his eyelids and running down his cheek.
Draco’s whole body went rigid at that. No, Potter couldn’t say that. He couldn’t ruin this for Draco.
Draco could feel the weight of Potter’s stare, making him go slightly dizzy. But when he finally found the courage to look back down, Potter had gone very still, eyes darting between Draco’s face and somewhere just above his head. Draco knew that look.
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Pansy practically shouts in his ear and Draco jumps out of his chair, startled, his Potions book falling off his lap.
have been Malfoy. Who else can you think of who’d have the motivation to beat up Ernie like that? And besides, he used to be a
And they were all here; almost every person that Draco had ever cared about in his entire life. He wished that his father had been a part of the ceremony too, or that Vince could be here to graduate with the rest of them, but even without them, it was still one of the best days of Draco’s life.
Just one thing before you start reading; when I was writing the scene in which Harry and Draco take a walk in the school grounds, I was listening to the song
“Before we really got to know one another, we always saw each other as the enemy. We were kids, Draco. We didn’t know any better. We were raised by people with opposite beliefs and morals and were never really given the chance to choose our own paths. We never got to pick the rights and wrongs for ourselves,” Potter said, throwing his hands up in frustration. “But when you started visiting Teddy with your mother during the summer, and you and I started actually
And now, every time he looked at Harry, he wanted to take his hand and tell him that he hadn’t forgotten. That it was simply impossible to forget, because those words were forever laced through every fiber of his heart. But how could he? This Harry didn’t remember that. This Harry didn’t
And he and Potter were actually getting along. They had talked again a few times, Potter telling him about the time he’d spent on the run and Draco talking about those awful nights of him guarding the dungeons of the Malfoy Manner – it hadn’t been easy, he’d had to force the words out of his mouth and his voice hadn’t stopped shaking all the while, but Potter had sat close and listened, and when he had finally finished, it’d felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
“Don’t worry Draco. It’s like you don’t know me at all, I would never put you in that position.” Pansy rolls her eyes dramatically and Draco’s heartbeat slows down a fraction, she’s right. “Trust me, I’m gonna make
” she panted excitedly. “Did you hear my commentary? I’ve always wanted to do that. It felt brilliant!”
“I don’t care about everyone.” Potter’s tone is serious at he looks right into Draco’s eyes when he says it.
“He’ll be fine. No, just stay right where you are.” Harry answered, tightening his arms around Draco’s waist. His voice was muffled by Draco’s fluffy lilac hoodie.
“I think you should start calling me Harry now.” Potter tells him, running the back of a knuckle on the soft skin of Draco’s cheek adoringly.
Draco’s fingertips were prickling with the urgent need to touch his face and soothe his pain away. He pressed them into his palms and said nothing.
Who had beaten up MacMillan like that? Draco knew for sure that it wasn’t any of his friends. They wouldn’t do that; not when Draco himself didn’t even have the balls to admit to have been bullied by him and personally ask them for help. It just wasn’t the Slytherin way of doing things. But who else could it be? Maybe Justin was right and it was just another one of the people that MacMillan had managed to provoke.
“What? You’re not going to bolt, are you?” Draco was sure that his eyes were twinkling with a thousand little stars. “Come on,” he said, and he broke into a run, dragging Harry behind himself.
Draco was shamelessly ogling at Harry as he passionately talked about his future plans, trying to restrain himself form pulling Harry aside and snogging him senseless.
Draco was there to pick up the items his father had ordered from Borgin the previous month. Apparently, nothing in the world could stand in the way of Lucius Malfoy’s desire for collecting rare and priceless dark artifacts. Not even a house arrest sentence.
A mixture of cheers and “boos” rose from the audience, but Draco paid them no thoughts as he determinedly sped up to catch up with Potter. Draco’s head was level with Potter’s leather-clad ankle now and he was helplessly watching as Potter reached for the Snitch, long fingers twitching to wrap themselves around the golden ball, and …
Before Draco can say anything, the sound of a person clearing their throat startles the both of them out of their shared moment. Potter looks up and over Draco’s head at the person and then quickly lets go of Draco, taking a step back.
“Bastard,” Draco muttered to himself as he readjusted his abandoned, half-hard cock in his trousers before stepping out of the small closet and heading for the greenhouses.
Draco rolled his sleeve back down and headed for the baths on shaky legs, using his time in the shower to make a mental checklist of the things he needed to do that day.
“Wow, how charming, Potter,” Draco cocked his head to one side, giving him an unimpressed look. “Except, you can’t give this away because it’s actually a school property,”
In the past three days, every time Draco saw Potter, he’d been flanked by his Gryffindor friends and that had made him chicken out. But even if he did get the chance to talk to Potter eventually, what was he going to say?
“I just wanted to say that …” Draco swallowed, cradling Harry’s cheek with his hand. “Thank you for having my back when I had forsaken myself,” he murmured, tilting his chin up to peck at Harry’s surprised mouth.
Draco narrows his eyes at her suspiciously, Pansy’s black eyes have the same evil twinkles they always have when she is about to get people in trouble. “What are you saying?”
After a few seconds of staring, Draco finally managed to turn his attention back to his potion. He carefully stirred the now steaming liquid three times clockwise and five times anticlockwise. The potion was starting to change color to dark orange when another burst of laughter snapped Draco’s focus away again.
of something hitting his desk dragged Draco out of his thoughts and he reached over to pick up the crumpled ball of parchment.
Draco had never said anything. He’d never complained when sometimes students would throw the Stinging Hex at him in the Great Hall or Diffindo his robes into useless shreds. He’d never even defended himself, and he certainly hadn’t reported any of them to McGonagall, even though she had pulled him aside the first day back and specifically asked him to report any kind of bullying or harassment straight to her.
Draco was gripping the headboard so hard his knuckles were white, his back arching off the bed with a loud moan as Harry lifted his thighs to press a firm lick across his crack.
“Okay, Potter, Don’t forget the rules.” Pansy says with barely surpassed thrill. “It has to take at least 30 seconds and there
“What?” Draco said, throwing his head back and looking up at Potter’s downturned face – his shaggy black hair framing it in messy ringlets.
That night, as Draco lay on his bed staring at the ceiling in silence, for the first time since the war, he thought about the things he could do differently from now – and not the things he could have done differently in the past. And Draco made himself a few promises.
“Of course, you do,” Harry said, brushing Draco’s hair out of his eyes. “You are a fighter, Draco. A survivor, just like me. You have your own battle scars just like me,” he took Draco’s tattooed wrist in his hand and brought it up to his mouth, kissing it softly. “And I love you for it.”
this??? And how was Draco supposed to be happy in it if all of his fundamental problems and mistakes had followed him here?
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Headmistress,” Draco said, frustrated. “I already told you, I didn’t see the attacker’s face.” He was in McGonagall’s office. He’d been told to go there straight from the Hospital Wing.
When they stepped out into the chilly air of late October, a light shiver ran down Draco’s spine as the cool breeze brushed against his skin, and he brought his hands up to rub them against his bare arms.
, Draco,” Harry groaned as he moved, the deep sound mingling with Draco’s whines and echoing around the small room. “So good.”
,” Draco moaned against Harry’s strong neck as his lube-slick fingers found Draco’s hole and started gently rubbing at it.
Draco rolls his eyes, the corner of his mouth twitching in a small smile despite himself. “Whatever, Potter.”
“Yeah, maybe I should,” he said, heat creeping into his cheeks, but he was unable to look away from that set of magnificent emeralds.
yes,” Draco said, winding a leg around Harry’s torso and adjusting himself so he could push down on Harry’s fingers.
With that, Goyle practically shoves Draco inside the classroom.  Draco stumbles in, glaring behind himself at Goyle.
” Pansy sneered. “But I’m gonna pretend like it was. It helps soothe my urge to want to slap some bloody sense into you.”
.” Draco hadn’t expected that. “Well, I appreciate it, Potter. I…” he cleared his throat, “I plan to apologize to the others as well, but I thought you should be the first. I can only hope that your friends would be just as generous with me as you.”
Fuck. He’s gonna be late and then he won’t be able to kiss Potter ever. And all because stupid old Slughorn decided to trap Draco in a one-sided conversation about fucking
“Let’s see,” Harry said and immediately added another finger, making Draco’s vision go white for a second.
“No, no I can’t fall sleep.” Draco sobbed, but his eyelids were already falling shut against his will.
“If you’re quite done, gentlemen,” Professor Frensby –their DADA teacher – is standing in the doorway with her arms crossed over her chest. “It’s time to begin today’s lesson.”
!” Potter said, suddenly alarmed. He shot forward in his hurry to snatch the parchment before Slughorn could pick it up, and his elbow knocked over his cauldron, spilling its contents all over Slughorn’s robes and sending the poor old man to the ground.
So apparently, there had been a mistake in the timeline and according to the original story, Eighth Year would have happened in 1998 not '97, so I fixed the timeline.  (sorry about that and many thanks to
“What?” he whispered, his eyes darting up in surprise and his mind failing to process what he’d just heard.
As soon as he stepped inside, he headed straight for the nearest shower stall with his chin in the air, taking his duffle bag with him so he could disrobe and then – once he had showered – put on new clothes inside the privacy of the small stall.
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy.” Borgin gave him another bow and said nothing else about the matter like Draco knew he wouldn’t. He was about to pay Borgin a fortune for the items, after all. And as far as Draco knew, his father was the only one left who was still willing to risk the purchase of dark artifacts from Borgin (Where did he even hide those things anyways?). He was not a costumer Borgin could afford to lose.
“I don’t know how he is since I’m here at Hogwarts with you, in case you haven’t noticed. But isn’t he at the Manor? Where else is he supposed to be?” Pansy frowned. “Isn’t that how a house arrest sentence works?”
“So you know everything about me, do you?” Potter clenched his fists, his voice rising. “Yeah, you’re fucking right, Malfoy. My life’s been all fun and games. I never made mistakes; I just snapped my bloody fingers and
“Oh, darling.” Pansy presses her red-painted lips into a thin line and falls silent beside him. Draco grits his teeth at his own carelessness. Pansy is his friend, but that doesn’t mean he should show her his weak spots like a pathetic, desperate child. What his father would do if he knew…
Draco’s hands slid between them, pulling impatiently at Potter’s belt buckle and undoing his zipper. “Off. Take that shit off.”
now. He can tell you about it.” Pansy looked back at Draco, black eyes shining with angry tears. “Draco, it was him, wasn’t it? You
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the locker room door bursting open caught all of them off-guard, and Draco whipped around to see Ginny Weasley run inside the locker room – ignoring Draco entirely as she passed him – and fling her arms around Harry’s neck in glee.
“Good game, Malfoy,” Terry Boot said as he passed Draco. And Draco wondered if this was how playing Quidditch should always feel like.
“Draco,” Pansy’s voice is gentler now as she puts a warm hand on his, and squeezes. “I don’t think that’s how he thinks of you anymore. Things have changed so much in the past few months. You’ve saved each other’s lives, he’s spoken up for you in your trials, you’ve apologized for everything and he’s accepted it. You’re not rivals anymore, Draco. For the first time, you actually have a chance with him now.”
He was still the same person who had made great mistakes in his past, who had taken the wrong path at some point in his life, and still bore the stain of it on his left wrist. A year ago, Draco didn’t believe that someone like him ever deserved to be happy like this, but now here he was, holding on to the feeling with all the strength in his soul.
Draco swallowed, his heartbeat quickening. He couldn’t remember the last time that he’d been this interested in something.
“Wasn’t me.” Draco felt the need to make it clear, even though he knew that Pansy was probably already aware.
“Anyway, now we have Dean Thomas, who’s actually a competent Chaser – no offense – leaving everyone behind and zigzagging his way towards the Slytherclaw goalposts on the far end of the field – you go Dean! – he’s getting closer and – THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT! YES! GRYFFINPUFFS SCORE!”
A huff of humorless laughter escaped Draco’s lips. “Can’t you see, Professor? This will never end.” Draco’s fists were clenching the fabric of his trousers. “We’ve fought in different sides of a bloody
Potter fixed his green eyes on Draco for a second and then – as if he’d found what he was looking for – turned his attention back to the others. “We’re gonna have to think this through.”
Draco stared at Potter’s outstretched hand. His long fingers, his square nails, the beautiful outline of the veins under his tanned skin.  He’d wanted to take this hand for so long. He’d dreamed about it, and he’d been rejected once. He wouldn’t miss his chance again.
? This Harry wasn’t the one from the alternate reality. This Harry might be his friend now, but that was it. He had already given Draco the forgiveness he’d been after; Draco simply had no right to ask for more. And he should never let himself forget that.
“Who, then? I asked Ernie several times, but he wouldn’t tell me. I think whoever it is; Ernie’s too scared of them to say anything. Who do you think it is if not Malfoy?” the girl asked.
This was how it had started, since the moment he had stepped into Platform 9 ¾ to take the train to Hogwarts for Eighth Year. And Draco had thought that either the students would get tired of tormenting him and drop it eventually, or he would get used to it after a while. But the bullying and the name calling only got worse and worse, and tolerating it got harder and harder.
Pansy’s black eyes are shooting sharp daggers at him and the tight set of her jaw couldn’t possibly be more threatening. He can almost hear her high-pitched voice in his head, shouting:
was what Draco had been begging for, after all. Because just like that, his eyes rolled back on his skull, and he was coming, painting his own bare chest and Harry’s hoodie with white ribbons of come.
“Okay,” He said, grabbing Draco’s hand. “Let’s go.” And he broke into a run the next moment, dragging Draco along.
Draco had though that if he kissed Potter and satisfied his own curiosity, it would be easier for him to forget and move on, but of course he’d been wrong. Now whenever his eyes even accidentally catch sight of Potter, he can almost taste the man on his tongue and feel his lightly muscled body pressed against his own. Thanks to Pansy and her wonderful ideas, he’s now more pathetic than ever.
!” Draco fisted his hand in Harry’s hair – Harry’s hand cupping his balls – and let out one broken sob after the other while he felt his cock rapidly filling up again with the movements of Harry’s head.
They’d both looked at the angelic baby girl sleeping in her cradle and then at each other; and decided that yes, Liana actually did suit her.
The person’s other hand shut the door behind them and Draco was, unceremoniously , shoved face-first into it, his cheek squashed against the hard wood. The person let go of Draco’s robes to push his long fingers into Draco’s hair and Draco let out a half-startled, half-aroused gasp as the man pressed his body against every part of Draco’s back, from head to toe.
She walks out of the common room towards the girls’ dormitory and leaves Draco slightly aghast. He looks at the potions book on his lap and tries to think of all the ways that Pansy could make Potter want to kiss Draco that wouldn’t be an utter disaster and comes up empty handed.
Harry flicked his fingers and all of Draco’s clothes disappeared, making him feel extremely vulnerable for a second before Harry turned him around and captured his mouth fiercely into his own. He put both his hands on Draco’s arse, kneading the round flesh before he lifted Draco off of his feet – making him gasp into the bruising kiss – and threw him on the bed, climbing in right after him.
!” Harry, Weasley and Granger chimed simultaneously, smiling at the camera in their matching red academic dresses.
“Okay, let me go get some for you,” Draco said, starting to get up when Harry put a hand on his shoulder and stopped him.
At that promise, the last remaining thread of Draco’s control busted, making him come hard and endless to the feel of Harry’s fingers inside him. He let out a helpless cry, clenching the white sheets in his hands as he sprayed hot come all over his own torso.
There was a resounding clap, with a little whirl for additional effects as Tea was as dramatic as Aunt Vivian, and out popped Tea in her newly blue robes.
She turned down the halls, as his office was in the leftmost wing. There were tapestries covering the wood walls and floors, hovering lights which lighted the passageways passed and dimmed when no presence was in sight. But what Vivian found the most amusing, was the space and time ripped dimensions. She turned to the nearest wall which was without the most deliberate hint of difference and stepped through, only to appear on the third floor's corridor of mirrors, falling out of the rectangular mirror on the ceiling.
"Vivian. I am not your housekeeper. You've only given me a worthless key which can barely slide into the house on the best of days, and even if I do enter it is for the sake of dusting and clearing the mould from your walls. To fill the void of no presence for over ten years and I-"
Draco's opinion of Viktor Krum was not high, or low, but it bordered with enough compassion to be sympathetic to his plight whenever he saw him crowded with students of all sorts in the passages without meaning to. They hadn't had a conversation but their greetings, as Viktor had seen him as a child three years ago.
"Magic works according to intent, and the amount of magic we can control of ourselves. Some have enough to use rashly, others little to use meticulously, and a very few who can control the magic around us, to make it ours, and use our core as the reception between what remains outside and what is within. Brooms are charms, but more than. To hover, it must resist against the magic which remains outside and feeds on your own magical intent.
His mother and Mrs. Zabini were less than enthusiastic at the prospect, but were used to the Headmistress' inclinations. Vivian Fall roamed Durmstrang during days she found herself bored, and messed with the dimensional pinches which were scattered throughout the school's passages when the boredom wasn't defeated. She was, similarly, the first and last complaint of the students' reasons for lateness.
"The European Union of Institutions is rarely heard of, most have taken to assuming it as a branch of the International Confederation's Educational Office." Joheim interrupted in surprise.
By the time Jason had finally settled on the nearest armchair, watching Draco clutch onto his stuffed dragon with a frown, he was already assaulted with memories of his own son.
Erlnier stood before Bartemius Crouch's house, and wrapped the invisibility cloak tighter around him. The lights were on. There was an elf visibly and audibly making sounds in the kitchen, unlike what usual house elves would have done, trembling even as she rubbed her rags against the table and snapping fingers as fast as she could.
"I've already cancelled the magic on anything I felt. Which means this whole room is quite objectified." Jason nodded his head.
Luna's declaration froze the room. Draco wondered, briefly, if she'd truly grown delusional. If Luna's occlumency was failing her, there was a need to revisit his Aunt no matter how much she insists on washing her hands off their Hogwarts experience. He stared blankly at his pseudo-sister, rather disappointed internally, while everyone else took to wide eyes. Then their brains scrambled to understand the situation, while Blaise, Fred, George, and Pansy collapsed back into their seats.
They would have been kicked out of the library had Blaise not casted a silencing charm in time, leaving her to mouth the remainder of her tirade and Draco to read from her lips:
They clasped their hands once more, a final reassuring brush of shoulders, before they both pulled away. He could see Blaise standing idly by the gates, first to have climbed the stairs. Until, someone landed their chin rather squarely on his back.
Vivian stared for a moment before breathing out a singular laugh. Bagnold looked at her judgementally, and turned to walk down the grey corridor.
Matthew's orders were completed one by one, until Matthew himself was sitting across Draco in the passage corner renovated into a sitting room. Draco, as soon as he had swallowed the first drink at Matthew's glare, felt his tears blurring his eyes.
The first floor was, as it seemed, a reception hall in its entirety. There was a piano in the corner which Draco was certain Aunt Vivian never used by the settled dust, a violin atop it which had been fondly displayed, with couches and tea tables lining the centre rug. He ignored the room, as he had seen many reception rooms in his young lifetime, although this one had a flair for the dramatics in its colour scheme of black and white.
He stared blankly at the tongue he'd wrapped his hand in, the tongue of an elf, whose head was molded into a door knob. A frozen, true tongue wasn't the most he'd seen, but it was unpleasant all the same.
Draco rubbed a piece of brick between his fingers. He seemed to stall, but in the end, smiled at his professor's concerned expression.
"Miss Narcissa is Mrs. Malfoy now," the elf said in disdain, "she is proper, most well done in hand. But you are no Black. You are no Malfoy. You are intruder, mixed thing which should not grace this house!"
"I'd rather have my aunt be Headmistress, if you'd all not take offence I'd love to explain." Draco eyed the class.
"Good evening," Draco said, much softer than their shouts, "there's butter-beer. Luna told me this is what all Hogwarts students love?"
She harshly tugged Erlnier to the nearest chair, which was the couch opposite the fainting couch and produced a chocolate eclair to stuff in the boy's mouth.
"There is always time. People think they have a limited amount of time to think, no-one realises how thoughts can outrun a single second of hesitation or conclusion. You're not writing, Draco. You are thinking. That takes less then the effort to move your hands, I assure you, you have time."
"There is no reason in killing," Aunt Vivian had said, "only that one has died and one has killed. Killing is a fact, a reality, a certainty that cannot be returned. If I must endow one with a certificate of killing it would be our most recent Dark Lord who has lost all sense."
The voice was rough, unused for long and grating to his ears. He couldn't talk from the foul hand across his mouth, and he indicated as much by biting a small chunk of his skin. There was a soft curse, and it wasn't a hand which grabbed him by his face any longer, but wet fangs which dragged him by his clothes.
"Ah, June. June...1st, yes. Hm. Flowers, Frenchman, here we are. Chartres? Chartres de Barr, Ministry of Magic, level B3. Orange lilies, orange lilies. Hmm."
"She owes me a favour, the first of the year. Don't you think, once they come to such a realisation, they would think otherwise of my actions?"
"There's a trip to Hogsmeade just next week. Perhaps we would have been better off treasure hunting in daylight, under the mass of students unsupervised. Not an error of conscience but an act of emotional thinking, would be the right description."
"How dare you!" Amiea gasped, "I am nothing like those giggling empty headed idiots who throw themselves at his foot, have some decorum in your accusations!"
The tile caved. Luna jolted to a stand as it approached the doors, screaming a spell, and every single exit in the room slammed closed. She screamed again.
"No one can stop Narcissa Black. I think we have only just began to realise how long a patience she has for the moment to strike."
"You did it very gently," she assured, standing to her feet and patting Blaise's head, "it was like a small hurricane."
By the time they reached the door, they had grown closer. Joheim pressed the second key into Draco's hand.
Now that a majority had gone Draco could see a heavy, round person sitting on a stool in the forefront, as Viktor Krum whispered worriedly into Nartus' ear. Considering Nartus' threat with his position at stake, Viktor did have a reason to protest rather violently. Draco ignored Nartus' pitiful whines.
To see its finger wagging at him, a broom held threateningly in its other hand as if to spark magic on a moment's notice was instead something he could handle, he twisted his mouth into a smile. Humans were easier to deal with.
Azkaban's guards had been invited to Hogwarts, that, he knew. But would Albus Dumbledore be so lacking as to consider placing such creatures on board the same train of his students? Or was there something...
The salaud made a three-sixty and zoomed right past Marcus' groins, to which Draco followed. He ignored the following shout, and gritted his teeth. Draco had utterly, truly enough of the thing Marcus had forced him to follow once a week, the salaud which was geared and charmed to play two players against another depending on the magician or witch's intent. He often had to see all unsightly sights of Marcus Flint when invited to a training session, and even now did he have to avoid running his face across the Slytherin's keeper's mouth who'd been doing nothing but gape in horror.
"Why yes. I do. He passes this store everyday on his way to work, and he's a man who takes the security of Hogsmeade very seriously. My store's the closes to Knockturn, so he makes sure to give a glance."
"Yes," Luna agreed with lingering discomfort, "but if the reason behind his attendance is sufficient enough-."
"That is predictable for students who've made cautious observations. For a disinterested transfer student, it's the least of all worries." Draco retorted.
"The Blue Lodgings. Now, there are underground passages often used when the winter winds fall hard, the entire passages charmed to warmth. You will be best off asking Draco," Joheim said to Blaise, "as he's been in them for the longest. It was a sight when I first came to Durmstrang, a wide-eyed first year, to find an eight year old running down the passages. Even more so when everyone started asking the very same boy for directions, of all things, well into their third month."
Draco had agreed to Pansy's enthusiasm on the grounds of establishing a rather strong beginning, Blaise knew, as he had seen him do the same in Durmstrang where he'd risked his own work for the benefit of others, only to cost them the same favor days, or years down the friendship. It was one of Draco's unforgiving traits Blaise experienced by his simultaneous transfer to Hogwarts.
What Draco had learned, in his few interactions with his mother and various conversations with the wizarding world at large, was that the people within the House of Fawley was in no manner conservative in their opinions contrary to the current society, or reserved in their speech behind closed doors. To those they considered an ally, they spoke without reservation, whether it be Sir Owen, or Miss Catherine. They had a common trait of holding their tongue outside, but made it known sooner or later of their own, surprisingly little, opinions.
"He did, in fact," Blaise picked up the conversation, "there, Ron Weasley. Youngest brother of the Weasleys. We haven't had much time to get to know each other, but we've heard much delightful rumours of your braveness Headmaster Dumbledore frequently mentions, Ron. Is it alright if we all call you Ron?"
"Stealing is not the proper term. I may have had to drag the Blacks into a deeper involvement within our House, which I assume is the reason why you wish to kill me, but I've had the mother's consent. You cannot possibly blame me for choosing a Black, when our previous Head had been a Black himself. It is rare to have a hereditary Head in our House, I'd have you know."
"The abandoned potion's classroom? There aren't anymore potions classrooms aside from Professor Snape's, Hermione."
Hermione stifled a giggle. When Draco turned, again with a pointed raised brow, she'd already stuck her nose back into her, and Marcus' books.
Draco grimaced. The papers he finished rifling through this morning had indicated Bertha Jorkins was on leave for holiday, moreover, towards Albania.
"The purpose of my approach was to invite you to my hall. Number 21-22, the most eastern room of the Blue Lodgings. Immediate to the Elves' house and the Fourth Court, across the Forest. Room 22 turned vacant as the occupants graduated, Nartus and I are leaving by the second season. Which also means you wouldn't have to share, unless by an offer."
"They are watching. You shouldn't have associated yourself with her, was doing so well maintaining a polite façade, couldn't have stopped a single smile?"
Now Draco did look surprised, and Blaise slowly pulled his mouth into a grimace, opening the door wider.
Draco waved at them, one flimsy swing, as he picked his way across the narrow trail. While it wasn't a secret that Draco had known Luna in France, it wasn't well-known, either. Their vicious glares, he supposed, was due to the fact he'd snuck into the Ravenclaw dormitories more than once and had escaped every time despite their fervent report to Professor Flitwick. This was the first time he'd blatantly crossed the room, however, and he wondered if Professor Flitwick or Snape was willing to let this slide.
Vivian looked up towards the desk, surprised at her brother's voice, only to find two men pouring over a map which travelled across the breadth of the desk and floor and some more.
Erlnier breathed in. Even in the midst of his sharp intake, his gaze flickered to the house elf's puttering to check whether his breath had been noticed, and realising he hadn't been, he pressed the air through his teeth silently.
"The notes indicate they were mentor and student," Luna said as she leaned back on a chair, flipping through the notebook, "They apparently knew each other from work, when Monsieur Chartres first entered diplomatic service of auror cooperations for the centurial seminar of the International Confederation of Wizards, and remained his mentor through several letters. Besides, Monsieur Chartres wasn't planning to stay in England, he only remained another day because Bartemius Crouch requested a meeting."
"What could be more suitable than to say Professor Flitwick had to pick you guys up from the Ministry of Magic?" Blaise replied, Draco's arched glance completely missing him by a fool's height.
She then began sobbing mutely into her arms, the sleeves of her robes turning wet. Blaise lifted the silencing charm.
A host of girls and boys, done up in exaggerated hairstyles and rather dark eyes repectively, swarmed before him.
"Enjoy your night for today," Uncle Jason said as he placed the book back down, "and I've stabilised your dimension-space magic. Use it freely."
He wandered the second floor which had had not been allowed before, which had an impressive array of time-warping dimensions scattered around every spare space there was, including a direct one towards the Kettle, which Draco was delighted to peer through. If it weren't for the fact that he was familiar with such a dimensional tear through time and space, anyone else would have stumbled through in eagerness and landed torn. There were books scattered across the floor and lining the walls, and Draco soon turned towards the third tear.
"It doesn't have anything but a bed, and the standard furniture. The case snaps shut when someone's inside, and unlocks when vacant. Compartment-charmed, one for strangers and the other an entrance." Aunt Vivian explained as she helped their cases onto the train, "other qualities included, but it would be a delight to watch you both struggle."
"Exactly as it says. Anything the students are inclined to think of, there is. There's groups for certain students from Bulgaria, or France, or Norway, and it's the student representatives of each year which has to oversee them. Sounds important, but the Orange Wing is an empty building where students mess around in certain groups with their group-invested furniture. But there are frequent parties of all excuses, so."
"He's not here." Luna turned on her heels ignoring Draco's awed eyes on the Shack's rather neat room, and rushed to climb out.
The professor clapped. Draco pulled his messenger bag to his shoulder, and took another look at the amusing sight of the girl's hanging mouth coupled with her frazzled hair. Unable to stop a smile he did as his instinct dictated, a fond smile splitting across his face, because he could imagine Miss Catherine scoffing right behind her at his lacking explanation, snorting at his pretence of knowing time magic, ridiculing him, but smiling with a proud glint to her eyes.
A snap echoed crisply across the room, to which Vivian tilted her head towards and Jason ignored. Two figures, a woman and a young boy, materialised before bleeding into a coloured figure. Catherine dug her heels into the stone floor before stabilising Erlnier, who, in a fit of dizziness swayed dangerously in the place he landed, as reflective of the unhealthy pallor to his skin with a disturbing crease to his face, but Vivian didn't comment. Jason rubbed his thumb into her left foot.
The International Confederation of Wizards' Conference took place in the country where the Supreme Mugwump resided. It was to be held in England, within the halls of the British Ministry, where security would be enhanced for the day, and delegates from all around the world would floo in.
"Harry got a new broom from an unknown person and I just wanted him to be safe, so I told Professor McGonagall to check on the broom, and now they're mad at me because Harry has to miss out on Quidditch, but it's just not safe!"
We must also consider the fact it's too much a coincidence for Bertha Jorkins to be at Albania right now. Tracking down Peter Pettigrew in two days won't be easy either. We have five people to consider: Monsieur Chartres, Bertha Jorkins, Bartemius Crouch, Peter Pettigrew, and Millicent Bagnold."
She was considering her husband's manner which had remained constant despite her active part in pushing him into his house arrest. There was not a single change from what had been before, to what had been now, as it was the same politeness she had first witnessed and the same love she had seen directed towards her. It spoke volumes of her husband, and herself, she found his loss of memories and return to 'normal' life without such proof rather disheartening.
They turned to stare at Susan Bones, who huffed and rolled her eyes. Her bluntness was what reminded him of Felis, her sharp tongue of Joheim. For the first time in his Hogwarts experience, Draco was genuinely paying attention to a peer's opinion.
Professor Flitwick was an old person, who'd spent the prime of his life in safer waters. He would have joined the Aurors had it not been for the discrimination and, what he could imagine, an upcoming war against workplace solitude (or the Ministry itself) more often mistaken as a goblin, and hence would've received no respect from the better purebloods who visited the place. Sometimes, he cursed his ability to read micro-expressions.
Draco had, as promised, lived in relative peace. If it weren't for the fact that Narcissa had played such a large part in the meetings herself, it was too rapid and silent a change that she would not have noticed it. It was the reason behind Catherine's sudden appearance, when Vivian could have covered the entirety of Draco's memory lessons herself, and Jason's frequent absence around the manor.
Draco preferred curling up on the library's windows when it rained. He enjoyed smuggling tea into the library, and smiled honestly when his cousin (or sister) Luna joined. Sometimes, when Blaise offered to silently support Draco's sudden disappearances in a social event, he smuggled his favourite brand of eclairs into their room in gratitude.
Draco wished he could abandon all pretence and haul the twins by their necks in frustration of their ignorance, but he couldn't fault accidental ignorance, as they had been seeing what had made them so.
She felt the magic resist against her intention even as she wrangled it around her grasp. Chartres was drawing his wand, his legs falling into a position, and she would have mocked him had it not appeared as arrogance. Vivian's imagination rampaged, and she wondered if she should bear more rudeness before deciding he was better without his consciousness. Lightening sparked between her fingers in brief flashes. Chartres' mouth opened to form a spell.
"But if there's anything in agreement, the fact that Sirius Black did approach Ron Weasley with a knife in his hands means there's something about Ron Weasley that Sirius Black deems threatening towards his own safety. As a convict, or with a purpose. That's the opinion you wanted, wasn't it?"
"You heard the interaction with Fred and George Weasley," he said, changing the unbearable subject, "that requires a discussion later. In regards to their possible roles, that is."
"The and-stuff is what got Mr. Zaxter in," Draco said, sitting up to reach for a small portion regardless, "Mr. Zaxter's been a researcher of 'light' magic. He can't get more 'pure' than that, in their standards. Single, from what the papers indicate, no friends, no family, no neighbours. Except for the security part they failed to indulge, he fulfilled all the conditions of what 'solo' requirements they had. Besides, he's seventy. Just old enough to get in, and young enough for them to accept his passion."
Draco waited until everyone had settled back into their seats, their eyes on his, listening to his every word as a clock ticked silently in the background.
"Yes, it's obvious they performed some kind of security check, but you know how reliant the Ministry is on veritaserum. It's been ages since the States made a counter-agent but, well."
Jason slid the tie around the man's neck. Vivian slowly crawled to a stand, muttering, "you should consider bringing Catherine over for the manipulation of memories, truly. I'm better at reading memories and chucking bits out or in instead of warping a third perspective to a first perspective."
Classes ranged between stressful to easy for Draco. Draco's lessons with Uncle Jason and Miss Catherine had went from morning to mid-day in his childhood, and Durmstrang's lessons, self-planned depending on the amount of electives, lasted from morning to early evening now. Aside from the mandatory classes he had been assigned on the first week, he had Aerodynamics, Languages, and Pavilion activities spread across the week every other day.
"Karkaroff himself isn't well established, no matter how much connection he can claim with the Dark Lord. As of now, where he has escaped a trial by the teeth of his skin, I would have to agree with Narcissa that he has disgraced himself. She said, and I quote: "I'd have stripped him of his own skin had he crawled any further in his own cowardice." Which is surprising, considering the future I had watched."
Startled, Erlnier stumbled. House elves weren't of hereditary magic, but the few which had been in service for centuries, like Tea, had no distinct magic of ownership but became one with the hereditary magic they've been in most contact with. So the elf, younger than Tea but older than most, had been unrecognisable to Erlnier's ears, less his magic, when surrounded by the Blacks' magic in the Black's house. Much like being stranded in Hogwarts, Erlnier thought negatively of the entire situation.
Draco sighed into his right fist, glanced at the rat in his other fist, and continued to walk up to the castle.
The rolls overhead were made of black metal but enchanted with magic. The paper which rolled endlessly out of a larger roll the size of an elephant on the floor was led up, towards the left ceiling, ran through a paper-presser which straightened its creases, and dragged towards the right. A puncher hung from the right ceiling, a tank of ink beneath, and names were continuously  stamped on, alongside times and dates.
Vivian's gaze wavered even as she maintained what remained of her sanity. War, she thought once more, this was to prepare him for war. She couldn't have prepared him better.
"Her opinion on Harry Potter was rather mild." Narcissa glanced at the newspaper which cracked against her husband's grasp.
The only fair interest which had caught Draco's eye was the girl who sat in every class as himself and Blaise, not a single one to be missed. From the chain around her neck he had once glimpsed he could only assume she was using a turner, the ministry issued ones of a hour's turn. And because they took every class, because Blaise was often pulled away by his childhood friends, because Draco hadn't established his place within the Slytherin hierarchy, Draco sometimes found himself paired with the girl who was always the last to enter and first to leave.
"Ah, it was necessary, Amelia. Hear them out, hear them out." The professor waved his hand, yet to catch his breath.
"We know," Draco answered, "but there's a fond explanation: Don't judge a book by its cover. I need to ask you something."
Draco held the knife tightly in his left hand, before switching it to his right. Luna was dangling it before her eyes by the blade as if she was contemplating its weight.
"Now that you've mentioned it. We had a moment of brief ceasefire, Lucius and I, when Narcissa started to take over the court proceedings. The moment Narcissa started to speak our eyes met in a deeper understanding than I would like to admit, the fact being that there will be no gains for us with herself at the forefront. She's the one who placed Lucius under lock and key, and the one who stole my title of guardian and labelled me a cousin. She may as well have added me to her family tapestry."
"I did mention you could involve others and make shares. I have ten or more questions." Draco smiled innocently, "besides, what credibility is there to speak of in any society?"
"You need the law on your side to free yourself. With Umbridge at the forefront of legislation on anti-animagus and anti-were policies, you'll find it hard to do so. But yes, I'll grant you the portion of political connections." Draco said with his eyes closed.
His entire robe had flipped when he tripped on the bench. That didn't mean he didn't see Draco Malfoy's pale yellow hair, too pale to be called blond. That didn't mean he missed out on the curve of his smile, the pale grey of his eyes, and the clutch of his fingers around-
"That's what we came to ask you, and. Uh," he turned to his friend, "I wanted to apologise," Ron intervened, saving Harry from his rapidly reddening skin, "for what happened yesterday. It was, unfortunate. I think."
"It'd best be proper. There are limits, Draco, lines that must not be crossed in etiquettes. You've always struggled remaining steady during situations you deem excitable, and there your curiosity comes much into play."
"I always forget you have gone out of your way to acquaint yourself with them. They are fine, healthy as ever. If anything, I believe Rachel may have a husband by next year. They had such a romantic atmosphere."
"I cannot leave this matter unattended. Detention for the rest of the year." Flitwick announced, "and I will be requesting your mother's presence personally."
"Deal. Repeat after me: I swear on the my magic, the dissolution of my core, to never repeat a work heard or spoken, through any retelling, implications, or variations to others, aside from myself, and two others who are similarly bound to this oath. So mote it be."
"Fine. I was about to ask you, I've asked Cedric and the others already, whether you've seen or heard anything yesterday? Ron's been more obnoxious this morning because of everything from yesterday. Can you believe what he's been saying about you? How you confunded me, or slipped a love potions into my food, to make me friends with you? Apparently,
"What's up with these French people?" The cook, a very strong-looking woman with purple streaked hair, thumped her knife on the board. The board split in half. "One demands a Coq au Vin, another demands a Quiche Lorraine, do I
Draco leaned forward. Perhaps it was an instinct, but this was one of those inexplicable moments in life where one felt closer to facing the truth, realising something great, understanding something important.
The vivid green light shone in his face despite the curtains he'd drawn. He glanced at the time, half to six, and bemoaned his continuous lack of sleep as he turned back to the hand-mirror.
"It feels as though my clothes are gathering more bathwater the further you walk. There's something down there, gingers, and Draco Malfoy has failed to clue us in."
Hermione Granger began to cry, babble, and reason psychology all at once. It really wasn't the time to be inconsolable, but Cedric reached around Draco's neck to pat Hermione's back, wondering how far-fetched their hypothesis seemed to be, or must have been had it not been Blaise, Pansy, and the twins' confirmation. He blinked several times at the ceiling in exhaustion.
Draco obediently turned West of Hogwarts' north grounds, towards Hagrid's hut and the Forbidden Forest beyond. He didn't know whether the rat would've dared to visit such a place when the Forbidden Forest hosted Voldemort not two years past.
A plate of chocolate truffles appeared, and Draco was, once again, forced into eating one. Giving the same effect as the first sip of honeyed water, Draco sniffed. Matthew leaned back in his chair and watched him in silence.
Cedric Diggory's attention was grasped the moment Viktor's name echoed, and had drifted closer the more the letter was discussed, until he was practically leant over the Gryffindor's table with his knee on the bench despite the protests.
"Of course. What a front, mister, I've only ever seen "The Art of Aurology" in Korea before. Even there it's taken in high regard. Have you seen Mahoutokoro's "Being Efficient"? Everything of Japan's express magical post system's as good. Second-hand books are valuable indeed."
VIvian had been silent the entire time Narcissa talked to Flitwick, standing by the stairs. Their first personal tea-time after two and three months had been cut close with Mr. Flitwick's sudden request, but overhearing their entire conversation from not a few meters away, Vivian felt a cold settle over her stomach at the mention of an Avada Kedavra.
"That's what you said," Erlnier protested, "and there the future's too vague. Preparation never hurts, something learnt far beyond my age, there is no reason for you to protest, you must have something to share, to protect."
"I'm glad you've had your manners well-taught. Is it your mother? Vivian would have taught you to bite the finger off."
They peered at their mothers through the window, and their mothers stared in return, until the train began to launch.
Susan threw another firewood into the fireplace, and poked it with the iron stick. She hadn't been invited, but had invited herself, and they'd all but agreed not to exclude her from conversations she privately told him were interesting. Her interest had more to do with the political gossip Pansy carried around with her like a suitcase of legal lawsuits, and so the two mostly kept to themselves by the fire in their personal world.
"This would leave an impression on my head but not a solid memory, and a stronger memory in yours but foreign. As raw as it is, I'd have to remove it from you after you've assimilated it in your own head. And by that point the memory, having gone through two receptions, would be useless."
"I didn't know you would talk bad about me then, did I? Before a roomful of Slytherins, even? Should I have read your mind then? Or did you do whenever I wasn't here?"
Hermione couldn't tell whether her answer had been a yes, or a no, but Draco dragged Luna up by her elbow anyways and dried her hair with a charm. With another wave of his hand, Hermione realised with surprise, Luna's messy hair pleated itself into a braid, then wrapped into a bun. Draco pulled out a hairpin, from nowhere Hermione noted, and stuck it in.
"You don't understand," Draco raised his hand, his wand trailed on the two, "there is no given option."
He laid there, panting, and nearly fell off a broom for the first time in his life when the entire school roared into life.
He admitted, although the constraints of his own House remained, she was his equal in all things known save the political and traditional affairs of both the Wizarding and Muggle world.
Vivian reigned in her snort at such a paling face, then reconsidered her words. If the session was to be successful it was probably possible to begin a campaign of relocating children, yet her brother would be more than willing to twist her neck if she began anything on a larger scale. The horrors of children remained, after all.
To say Earlier didn't know any of Chartres de Barr's interests and dislikes was an overstatement. He heard plenty from Aunt Vivian's slander. Perhaps it was luck which brought him to think of pubs, a guess made from Chartres' visit to the bar in Knockturn. Bartemius Crouch may have brought him to a pub in Knockturn, but Chartres was a man who liked appearances.
"Ron. Lost. His. Rat." Susan parroted, but it sounded more ominous than the fact she'd been repeating other people's words for the past minute.
With a wandless snarl, he snapped the chandelier's hook off the ceiling, which made it crash onto the floor. Using the splinters of wood and glass scattered throughout, he made an immediate wave of magic to sweep over the floor, in which they streaked through the air and landed in sharp edges by the millimeter of the rat's flickering tail.
Draco took a while to digest that, and was both horrified and awed at once. He could take this at face value, disregarding her perception towards his other identity. He didn't, as awed as he was.
Uncle Jason hummed. "Your friend is very used to the peculiar things which happens around you, like you going noticeably missing during the nights at Durmstrang, or knowing spells you weren't meant to know. He's been hearing you mutter through your essays in three two different languages, breaking rules to your liking, and very eager to prove what he knew about you to me when I appeared on your bed."
Draco had not bothered with arranging his classes save a cursory glance when Aunt Vivian had first offered. But there was Arithmancy, Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, and Astronomy. To Draco, and Erlnier, who had his days once packed with alternating schedules between Miss Catherine's restless memory-search and Uncle Jason's unforgiving political sessions it was more than empty. He had attended meetings at the Pavilion after rounds of students' filing complaints and taken midnight classes in the dark at the Forest of Raging Fell by the fortress' collapsed wall. He feared, most of all, that he would lose the experiences gained than earning any in improvement.
Erlnier brought the cloak tighter around himself, and shuffled a step forward. He knew better than to keep his gaze ahead, he kept it down to find patches of blank spots on the road, his feet moving from heel to toe. He didn't know if the house had wards, or spells, which was why he'd been so far, but this was news. Information he didn't think he'd attain.
"But you're using raw magic," Sirius Black narrowed his eyes, "of someone else's then? I would have never thought of Lucius Malfoy allowing his only child to be another's property."
"It's like one of those ancestral tapestry, but far minimised and based on reflective locations, than blood."
"If Draco attending Hogwarts was the right thing, and Durmstrang but an alternative, reluctance would have been the last thing to consider." She murmured, "inactivity worse than activity, a life for a life. Would it make sense if you were to believe the same theory applies to your decision?"
"We are witches and wizards," Draco continued, "with wands. Fred and George Weasley were brought here with a purpose."
"We're going to play a game. If you answer incorrectly, I'll take double the galleons off the table. If you answer correctly, I'll add two a question. Of course, you can invite others to play, and divide the share as you wish. No, you cannot rob me of these, because I'm pulling these out of charmed wallets which recognises ownership. Agreed?"
"It's fine, Blaise." Draco dismissed, distracted by the sudden explosion of black fireworks against the blue sky.
"Good evening, Minister. I'm afraid I need to speak to Mr. Scrimgeour, alone, if possible." Professor Flitwick replied.
"I don't understand, that was the 1700's! That was my great-great grandfather, wasn't it? You weren't even born!"
Draco nodded his head politely, which Blaise and Luna copied. Professor Flitwick looked at them all in turn, slightly offset by their formalities yet still upset, and began to wave his wand. They filed out of the room.
"And to emphasise,"Vivian added airily, "only nine living people, including you, know of me as Livinnis Vivian Fawley. All others have only heard of our reputation, and I promise you, it can be utilised to the greatest effects."
"Woah, Susan," Draco grabbed her shoulder as she moved, "we're all tired, and Blaise's excuse is vague enough for you to settle a suitable excuse with Professor Flitwick. Blaise, Susan, both of you should stay back to confirm our alibis with Professor Flitwick. Once done, tell us tomorrow morning. Hermione, please bring your friends back to the Gryffindor common room. It's nearing midnight, the twins will tell you what happened once I give them a brief explanation. Goodnight, Luna. Pansy, Fred, George, follow me."
He, too, was reaching for the wand in the fold of his robes. Draco raised a brow and looked down upon them with a tilt of his chin, and summarised that George was the one with brains, and Fred with magic. George glanced at his twin brother, before meekly pulling out his wand, too, their shared Cleansweep 11 shivering against the wind.
"We will send word back to the Minister," the French delegate spoke in a heavy accent, "and the Ministers shall decide."
(They would come to know, in time, that the goblin receptionist decided fees at his own violation. Rather, he was tasked to do so, and he found Draco's knowledge of Gobbledegook rather admirable considering his age, and had shaved four galleons off the average price.)
Draco stared down at Marcus Flint who hovered beneath him on his broom, sending him desperate pleas which had began, Draco checked the time, five minutes past the beginning of their game and well into half-time.
Draco could hear the faint traces of thunder, superficial in all but the sound which rang through the air. He could hear the skies thundering in the air, and in his ears, which should have caused even more confusion had the sky suddenly cleared. Dumbledore had some wits left in him, he thought, as he traced the sound to the middle of Hogwart's grounds.
McGonagall took her delicate square-shaped spectacles off, massaging the bridge of her nose with her forefinger and thumb. “Mr. Malfoy, I just want you to know that regardless of your actions in the past, you’re still a student in this school and as headmistress, the last thing I want is for any harm to come to my students. So I’ll politely ask you once again to tell me if you have any suspicions regarding the identity of your attacker.”
Draco felt a pang of stinging pain at the sight, like a small knife stabbing him right through the heart. He bit the inside of his cheek hard and kept quiet. He had been so caught up in his own petty world, building thick walls of guilt and self-pity around himself and shutting everyone else out, that he hadn’t even realized that Pansy – his best friend who had always been there for him no matter what – might be struggling with the same things. How could he have been so ignorant? So oblivious?
In a moment of desperation, Draco opens his mouth and the word has escaped his lips before he can stop himself. “NO!”
“Of course I am,” Potter said, emerald eyes filled with warmth as he looked down at Draco. “I already told you. You don’t have to wear it but if you want to, we’ll do it together.”
Draco swallowed hard, looking away. He wasn’t able to find a reason for the sudden jolt of hurt and embarrassment he felt in his chest.
“It depends.” Draco says softly, his gaze falling from Potter’s eyes to the dark red of his mouth. And the heat of Potter’s gaze on him says that he already knows what Draco is talking about. He fills the remaining distance between them and captures Draco’s lips in an all-consuming kiss. This time, Draco pushes his fingers into that black mess on Potter’s head and just lets himself feel.
They stayed like that for several seconds – sweaty and panting – before Harry slid free and threw himself on the mattress beside Draco with a content sigh. He turned his face to the side – looking at Draco with a lazy, satisfied, little grin – and lifted a hand to brush Draco’s hair out of his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes in a bored gesture. “Since when do I have to explain myself to you, Potter? You’re not the boss of me.”
“Hey!” suddenly, Potter was standing behind him and putting his hands on Draco’s shoulders, making all the hair on Draco’s body stand on end.
!” But he didn’t get to finish his sentence, because suddenly Potter was cradling Draco’s nape in his palm and kissing him – firmly – on the mouth.
“Yeah. Okay. Whatever,” Draco said, internally panicking. What was he going to wear? Had he even have a costume prepared?
?” Potter’s dark eyebrows shot up in surprise. “And what makes you think you’re in any position to do such a thing?”
Pansy rolls her eyes at him, clearly giving up on the subject. “Are you sure you don’t wanna come? You can tag along with us if you want to. Or you can hang out with Blaise and the others.”
“Yeah, it’s pretty amazing actually,” Potter answered, examining the wand in his hands. “It understands me.”
“Then come,” Potter said simply. “Come for me, gorgeous.” He ordered, pushing his tongue back inside Draco alongside two of his fingers.
It had been six days since Draco had come back from the alternate reality, and it felt like he wasn’t whole anymore. There was a sense of loss in every breath he took, like he had left a part of himself in Harry’s arms that night.
“I…” Draco sighed, his voice shaking with the heartache he had felt at Potter’s words. “I don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve you, Harry. And I don’t deserve to be that person for you.”
“Good.” Draco stepped forward and was about to pick up the chest when he saw it in a dusty corner behind Borgin. A delicate silver ring inside an open, black velvet box.
Draco doesn’t have time to comprehend what happens next. Suddenly there is no distance between Potter’s and Draco’s own bodies and Draco is almost thrown off balance as Potter wraps a strong arm around his waist and cradles the back of Draco’s neck in the palm of his other hand.
He didn’t know how much time had passed – he must have zoned out – when he heard a couple of students settling themselves down behind the desk in front of his.
,” Draco was lost in pleasure, already on the verge of his second orgasm. And by the looks of it, Harry was too. “Harry…”
Draco turned his back to them, having a strange feeling like he’d just suffered a heavy punch to the guts. How could he have been so stupid to let himself
Draco looked around the damaged locker room with a heavy breath. Draco had never really loved Hogwarts that much, but he hadn’t thought that seeing it in wrecks could actually hurt like this. The Quidditch pitch had been repaired during the summer, but the locker rooms were mostly still useless.
A shadow moves at the corner of Draco’s sight but he barely sees it because his heart is suddenly back-flipping behind his ribcage when Potter bursts out laughing at something Finnigan just said. An open laugh, with a deep, delighted sound roaring out of his chest and his head thrown back in mirth, which gives Draco a clear view of a lightly tanned, strong neck and a tantalizing Adam’s apple and he’s just so, so fucking done with this shit, when…
Draco’s eyes fell shut on their own accord, his breath escaping him in a soft huff as Potter brushed the tip of his tongue against Draco’s own. Draco’s hands came up to rest on Potter’s biceps. Potter’s mouth was hot and welcoming, and Draco had no idea what was happening or why, but he bloody well knew that he didn’t have the strength to pull away from this if he wanted to.
Draco sticks his chin out, holding his ground. “Of course you do. You think everyone is in love with you. Why shouldn’t you? You’re the bloody Savior himself, after all.”
Draco was walking the hallways of the Third Floor, looking for Pansy. They were supposed to meet there after class, but he couldn’t find her. As he rounded one corner, he heard what was unmistakably Pansy’s voice, though he was still too far away to hear what she was saying. He took a few steps forward, but stopped when he saw Pansy, cornered by a group of Ravenclaw girls who didn’t seem friendly at all.
“And I knew that if I could see Sirius again, he would tell me that he didn’t think it my fault. I knew that he wouldn’t blame me, but still I couldn’t forgive myself, and it was slowly killing me,”
Draco’s heart is pounding like crazy now. His palms are sweaty and his feet are cold in the comfort of his polished shoes. He wants to run away so badly but at the same time, he wants nothing more than to fling his arms around Potter’s neck and shove his tongue down the man’s throat.
They stayed like that for an unknown amount of time, both panting until their breathing evened out, and then Harry slid his cock free, carefully helping Draco up into a sitting position and pressing sweet, light kisses all over his face.
“Bastard.” Pansy finally looked back at him, mirroring Draco’s smile. They didn’t talk much more, but that was enough for Draco to know that they were fine for now.
“Pretty fun game, huh?” Potter smiled at him. How did he manage to look so good and unbothered by the cold when Draco himself could no longer feel his nose and his words were starting to mingle together by the numbness of his cheeks?
!” Potter’s shoulders slumped as he drew a deep breath, and he lowered his voice. “I’ve had crap to deal with too, Malfoy. A lifetime of it, for that matter. And yes, I fucking know how you must feel. Now would you just sit your arse down so I can tell you about it?”
Draco’s bed was located under a large window with a breathtaking view of the depths of the Great Lake.
Harry frowned, thumb texting furiously as he shoved the sandwich further into his mouth with his other hand.
“Not bad, actually. Lavender and Parvati stood in the middle, picked something from the pile and asked who’s it was. I learned a lot about some of the girls.”
“Hmm?” He looked up, then glanced at his pile. “Oh. Defense, potions, charms, transfiguration, ancient runes, arithmancy, and alchemy.”
Dinner passed quickly and soon the trio were heading back to the common room. Their footsteps echoed off of the walls as they jogged up the steps, secretly happy that they no longer had to worry about them moving. They had stayed longer at dinner than most of the other eighth years, and the common room was bustling when they walked in.
The blond picked it up, eyes scanning Hermione’s neat handwriting. An emotion flickered across his face that Harry didn’t recognise. Something between softness and a sneer replaced it, like they were fighting for dominance of his facial features. The note quickly landed back on Harry’s desk. ‘Fine, Mother Hen.’
The next few days passed without issue. The eighth-years began to settle into their new environment, and their new normal. By thursday, they already had multiple homework assignments, and were looking forward to heading back to the dorm after dinner to procrastinate on them. The common room was welcoming that night. All of the eighth years, or at least most, it seemed like, had wanted to socialize and have some fun. There were games of exploding snap by the couches, wizard’s chess on the tables by the window, a few of the girls laughing at tiktoks sent to them by one of their muggle sisters, and two boys wrestling in the corner while another recorded it. Harry and Ron were on one of the couches playing snap, while Hermione sat curled up in an armchair beside them, reading.
Blaise stood. “I’ll go.” The group watched as he dusted himself off and headed for Malfoy’s bed. Blaise stuck his head through the emerald curtains, and their muffled voices could be heard. A moment later Blaise closed the curtains and returned to the group. He sat back down on the floor, looking up at Harry. “He said he’s fine and he’s just going to read.”
Draco waved to Blaise over Harry’s shoulder as he headed past them to the stairs, then turned back to Ron. “Doesn’t matter.”
Demelza coughed. “Uh… I haven’t quite figured out how to use my phone yet. It’s a pretty new concept to a lot of us.”
Finally, he let himself be pulled to Harry’s side. Harry could sense the fear and the pain coursing through Draco’s body as he cried violently, sobs wracking his body.
Draco stopped at his curtains, looking at Harry with an expression Harry couldn’t read, but wished he could. “Yes. You definitely can.” He turned and looked at all of the closed curtains with a sigh, then back at Harry. “Goodnight.”
Professor McGonagall grinned at their beaming faces. “As you can see here, we have tried to incorporate your house colours into the fabric on the chairs and couches, but the rest of the room remains neutral. The staircase behind me leads to your dormitories. This year, we have decided that all boys will share a dorm, regardless of house, and so will all of the girls. Each dormitory has a washroom, also. Please, do try to keep it relatively clean.”
Hi everyone. So yes, I know that Dean was caught by the snatchers at the same time as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but I am writing it as if he was captured around the same time as Luna. Just to clear that up. Anyways, let me know what you think! Until next time! -Emma :)
Harry was mostly quiet now—only sniffles escaped him every now and then. Ron was mumbling to him, but the sound didn’t travel as far as it had before. A smile tugged at the blond’s lips, glad that Harry had such a good friend. He picked his book back up, scanning the lines, but they didn’t really sink in. His mind was on Harry and nothing seemed to be able to pull it away. He was talking with Ron in hushed voices and didn’t seem so distraught anymore. The thickness of tears in his voice had left and it now held the grogginess of sleep. He chuckled and Draco smiled in spite of himself, hiding his face behind the pages. After fighting it off his face he lowered the book slightly, eyes watching over the top of the old paperback. Ron had retreated to his own bed and drawn the curtains.
Harry awoke suddenly to the shaking of his arm, a dark figure in his dream quickly receding into the depths of his subconscious. He blinked up at a blurry silhouette, the outline of which he could barely see against the darkness of his curtains.
‘No. His mate beat me to it. We aren’t exactly friends... but it was still unnerving to see him like that.’
He was teasing, and Harry couldn’t help but smile. Draco still had this snark to him, and he loved it. “Also means you have to get passed Ginny.”
The girls nodded. Padma sat next to Harry and Sue sat beside Ron, both pulling out partially started essays. Harry went back to his paper, adding a transition sentence onto his first body paragraph, squinting at it skeptically. Padma eyed him but said nothing. His phone buzzed once more and he held it away from Padma, not that she would’ve tried to read what he was saying, but just to be sure.
Harry stuffed his phone back in his pocket and headed for the stairs. A bit of potato had slipped off onto the stairs, but he doubted anyone would notice. He pushed the door open and slipped inside, unnoticed at first. Draco was laying on his stomach, as he usually was, typing on his phone. He shut it off when he heard Harry’s footsteps, and looked up, startled. His mouth dropped open slightly once he realized what Harry had in his hands, to which Harry smiled. “I, er… you didn’t eat. So I brought you some dinner.”
She stared at him for a minute as if wondering how thick he really was. Then she pursed her lips and turned back to the cauldron. “Nevermind.”
The class chatted idly as they worked, seventh and eighth years mingling. Houses mingling. Harry grinned down at his scales.
“You don’t have to say that if it’s not true. We all went through stuff. We’ve all seen death, seen torture, felt pain, lost people… I’m not okay sometimes…”
There was a unanimous agreement among them, and they all headed back to their beds, drawing their curtains.
The class laughed. Malfoy sneered at them. That seemed normal enough, but something was nagging at Harry. He couldn’t get what happened last night out of his head. Couldn’t ignore the look Blaise was giving the blond that he thought no one else could see as Malfoy kept his head bowed. Couldn’t help but feel like there was something wrong with this picture.
Draco gave him a look, a mixture of amusement and something Harry couldn’t place. “You don’t have to thank her. She knows.”
Gingerly, he grabbed the other boy’s chin and tilted his head to the left, exposing the two jagged scrapes on his neck. Draco hissed as Harry pressed the wet cloth to them. “Sorry,” he mumbled back. Again, he healed them quickly with his wand, then put both hands on his jaw to look at his face in the candlelight. Draco looked up at him, his silvery eyes looking into Harry’s as he scanned the cuts and blood on his face. He found a few small cuts on his cheekbone and by his lip and healed them. Then he brought the cloth up and dabbed at the cuts. His pale skin had been stained in other places by the bleeding, and Harry wiped the splotches from his face. As he went to drop his hand he caught sight of a thick, pale scar on his cheek. Without thinking he ran his thumb over it, his knuckles brushing Draco’s skin. “The—”
Harry took a deep breath, eyes closed, then opened them again. He knew he shouldn’t be so shaken, they were only in class after all. If anything, it should remind him of the fun times he’d had with the DA. But now, even that stood for something more, and he just couldn’t shake off the bad memories and connotations held by so many things he used to enjoy.
Harry frowned when he read the last text, wanting to respond, but it was time to go to class. ‘U dont know the half of it.’
Harry and Hermione both looked up to see Draco standing there, fiddling with his tie. Harry nodded. “Where’s Pansy?”
The eighth-years are brought to their new dormitories. Once the boys and girls separate, the boys all spend the evening chatting and goofing around--mostly.
Dean nodded. “I could hear him from the upper floors, even though I was in the cellar, with Luna. She heard, too. I’m glad Harry was able to wake him up. I think he knew what was happening, too.”
The pang turned into an ache. A longing. He didn’t want Harry to feel like this. He had saved his life more than once. He didn’t deserve to feel this way. He didn’t understand why Harry felt guilty. Why he kept apologizing to Ron, and everyone else for that matter. For everything. As if it was his fault that he was a pawn in a war, being used from such a young age. They were
Another chair pulled out, this time the one beside where Harry’s bag was sitting. Blaise sat down, tapping Hannah’s arm and mumbling something about how he had a herbology question but couldn’t find Neville.
Harry held a hand up as Blaise sighed, staring at the empty spot next to him. “Guys, I know we don’t all get along… but we can’t do that. We have to live together for the next year, so that means we all have to make it work.” He turned to Blaise. “What was that about?”
“Sure,” said Draco. “Or you can do mine, I’ll do Hermione, and Hermione can do yours. How about we try and give the other person our own hair colour?”
Faith opened her mouth to object as McGonagall’s voice filled the room. “Good evening everyone, and welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few announcements before we begin the feast. First off, I would like to welcome back our eighth years. They are students who’s final year was interrupted during the Wizarding War, and have been invited back to finish their NEWTs. Please treat them as you would any other student.
Ron glanced at Hermione, then back at Harry with a look he couldn’t quite understand. “Okay, mate. Is that what you’re talking about, because I doubt he’d just tell you.”
He nodded. “Yeah, alright. Why not?” He watched as Harry grinned at the cards and found himself trying to supress one of his own. Harry shuffled them, cut the deck, then started dealing. He picked up a face card and surveyed it’s still image, then smirked up at the rest of the group. “I’m gunna win.”
Near the end of the practice, Harry coasted over to where Urquhart was resting on the ground observing his team. He eyed Harry as he approached but did not act hostile. Harry held his hand out after landing, which Urquhart took. “Welcome back,” Harry said with a grin.
that way. All the houses. I mean, Pansy it super outgoing and spunky, but Daphne is quite poised and reserved. Not snobby like I thought she’d be though. Sue is ridiculously funny, and Padma is a born leader.”
Harry waved the boys past him and jumped down into the next row with Blaise. The blond’s breathing had picked up, Harry noticed, as he got closer. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, but the other boy flinched and shoved him off. Harry looked to Blaise, then back to Draco. “We need to move. They can put the fire out, out we have to go out in the corridor. Let’s go.”
When they returned to the dorms, the quidditch players and spectators found that food had been sent to the dorm for them to eat. Harry, Ron, Dean, Seamus, Hermione, Daphne, and Draco tucked in. Daphne only grabbed her food and headed upstairs, Blaise had left to take a shower, and Goyle, to none of their dismay, had seemingly vanished. Harry, Ron, and Dean, still in their quidditch sweaters, sat down on one couch to eat. Seamus sat between Dean’s knees on the floor, while Hermione took a seat beside Draco on the other.
Susan and Sue were smiling at the two girls, and then Sue piped up. “More makeup means you have to try some on us!”
Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest and he mentally scolded himself. Of course, Draco had done fine. Harry recalled startling awake, out of that cruel place, and the first thing he saw was worried silver eyes watching him. He remembered Draco’s hand on his arm, soothing against his own clammy skin. Felt himself break down from the pain and overwhelming distress he’d felt that day, the trauma he’d relived in the dream… remembered Draco pulling him into a tight, comforting embrace where he was allowed to feel everything as it escaped his body, and being held against his chest as he fell apart…
Harry stepped up to one of the sinks to brush his teeth. The mirror was steamy so he couldn’t see his reflection, but he was positive that his hair was sticking up in every direction. While brushing, he looked around the bathroom, again. Tall stalls, mirrors over the sinks, towel hooks, white walls, white floor, red splotches…
Although the group of Gryffindors received odd looks from many of the boys, they came over anyways. Goyle lamented over (with Blaise looking thankful to have an excuse to leave) and leaned against the wall. Terry put his phone down and came over as well, sitting next to Neville on his bed. Malfoy closed his book, slid off his bed, and sat cross-legged on the floor next to Dean’s bed. The Hufflepuff boys stopped their conversation to join the rest of the boys, as did the Ravenclaw boys and Theo.
“I’m sorry.” His attention fled to the front of the room, taking in the splintered desk, the smoking quill. The dark-skinned boy on the floor next to it, hands over his ears, tense. “I’m so sorry!” Seamus cried, bottom lip trembling as he stared out over all of the crouched students, and back at McGonagall, who had also dropped to the floor. “I… I didn’t mean to scare anyone… I…”
Ron smiled sadly, turning his back and leaving them alone once more. He walked back out to the other boys, who looked at him expectantly.
Malfoy still didn’t respond. He shoved a chocolate in his mouth to shut them up, and soon more mewing filled the room.
The Great Hall looked just as magnificent as it had before the Battle of Hogwarts. The windows had been repaired, the ceiling as well, and the tables stood in exactly the same places as they had when Harry had last seen them on a normal school day. Although, despite its beauty, he couldn’t stop himself from tensing when he walked in. Many of the eighth years did as they entered together… all remembering the scene they had left behind the previous year. The bodies strewn on the ground, the yelling, the screaming, the blood and jets of light flying past your head… barely allowing you another day. Of course they all remembered that… who could forget?
Professor McGonagall cleared her voice at the front of the room, causing every head to turn in her direction. She stared out at the faces before her, smiling warmly at her students who had decided to return this year, all eight years of witches and wizards. “The sorting ceremony will now commence! Professor Sprout will bring in the first year students momentarily. As it is our first year post-war, some may be frightened. Many of you, I’m sure, were not convinced about returning this year yourselves. Please make them feel welcome. Treat them well, and each other well, also. That is all.”
Harry did a double take, staring at the spots of red on the floor. By one of the middle showers, the water was tinged slightly with red. A few droplets of blood could be seen on the floor there, as well. Harry sucked a breath in. The boys would usually shave in a mirror, and showers don’t normally have mirrors… So why was one of the boys bleeding? And which one of them was it? Harry stood on his tip-toes trying to see their hair over the stall doors, but they were too high. He stooped to look under. Pale skinned feet. That ruled out Blaise…
Across the aisle from him, Draco was crouching, ashen faced and staring between Dean and Luna, then the splintered desk. He was breathing heavily, wand hand shaking as he held it out in front of him. Pansy was leaned over him, mumbling. “Get up, it’s okay. It wasn’t an attack. You’re fine…” He stayed put.
Harry pursed his lips. “Yeah.” His stare lingered for a moment longer, before he pushed through the curtains and out of sight.
Harry shuffled the deck, then cut it and dealt them each three cards. He turned the top card up for Justin. An ace of hearts. “Fuck.”
As he finished his plate, he glanced over all of their work materials. “What are you all working on?”
“Okay…” He pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his school emails. One from Maya, asking about extra Quidditch training drills. Professor McGonagall reminding them about an assignment due date. Assigned reading from potions, which, Harry assumed, was what Blaise was reading.
“Well, one day Voldemort got very angry… I think he suspected he was trying to help me. He used the curse on Draco in front of me and I realized it was the same scream I’d been hearing for months. After that I always knew when they were using it on him. You could hear him, even when he was on the upper levels. His Mother, too. She was never cruel to me, but some of them were to her. I suppose she wasn’t mean enough for them.”
He cursed himself mentally due to his reply. His brain whirled, trying to come up with another way to get him to talk.
Ron wakes Harry early the next day, much to his dismay, to discuss the previous night's events. Gryffindor has quidditch trials that night, along with Slytherin.
Harry remained tense the rest of the day, mind whirling with questions and memories alike. By the end of the day he was overly quiet, causing Ron and Hermione to try and coax conversation out of him. He didn’t reply, and soon after Justin came by, telling the two Gryffindors that he saw Harry with the portraits that day. They stopped pressing him but kept a watchful eye.
The dorm room appeared before him once again and he blinked into the darkness, rubbed his eyes. A few of the boys were shuffling around him, and although his curtains were open, he couldn’t see what was happening in the absence of the normal moonlight streaming in the window. “
Harry layed down his cards. “And I had jack-squat.” They both laughed at him as Justin rounded up the cards and began to shuffle them.
Harry rolled his eyes, piling eggs onto a piece of toast. “I think most of us think that. Especially Malfoy.”
Harry turned back his way and caught a horrified look on Draco’s face. Harry raised his brows and the other boy turned away, yelling “
Harry shrugged, glancing at his phone again. “I guess it was, er, just something I didn’t catch on to. Do you think that’s how he learned so much about the vanishing cabinet and how to work it?”
The crying doesn’t get very loud, explaining why none of the other boys got up to investigate. Harry was probably the only other person awake. He debated getting up to see who it was and maybe sitting with them for a moment, but he took too long to decide. There were a few shuddering breaths and then the boy stopped crying. Harry’s heart lurched. He knew how it felt, to cry by yourself at night, after everything that had happened. Night was when his thoughts were the most overwhelming… they overpowered him sometimes, though not as often as they had at first. Harry bit his lip as he shoved the map under his pillow after deactivating it. He rolled over on his side, wondering whose pain he’d been eavesdropping on.
Something wasn’t right. Something about the way the boy carried himself. About the way he spoke and acted during class. About the way he seemed like a shell of who he used to be, progressively for the last few years.
Harry grinned. “Good. Really fantastic! I think we’ll do really well this year actually, I’m excited. It will be nice to play again, proper.”
just a nightmare. That’s all. Surely, he’d forget about it. Surely, he wouldn’t catch on to the million other things going on… Right?
Urquhart glanced to the sky, then back at Harry. “Yeah, sure.” He turned back to his team. “Oi! All of you, down here! We’re scrimmaging Gryffindor!”
Draco swallowed his potatoes. “Urquhart needed a seeker. He asked me to come back because no one wanted all of the attention on them because of Slytherin’s bad wrap.”
Then one from Dudley, to Harry’s surprise asking him how the start of his year had been going so far. They had made up and caught up in the summer, and had taken to talking on the phone once in a while. Dudley hadn’t lied to Harry before he’d left that day—he didn’t think he was a waste of space. He had apologized to him, and asked him what it was like, being a wizard. What the war was like. He seemed fascinated, but also worried. Harry could tell, even though Dudley just laughed it off.
Harry cut the cards once more, then started to deal them between himself and Ron. As he looked up a dark-haired girl flopped down, cross-legged on the ground against Hermione’s chair. Still, she didn’t look up. She flipped her page, speaking clearly, “What would you like, Pansy?”
He rubbed his eyes, reaching for his glasses. Ron’s freckled face came into focus before him. “It’s barely light out,” he hissed. “Why?”
Harry, Ron, and Draco headed upstairs around midnight, smiles still lingering on their faces from the night’s antics. As they neared the stop, music and singing reached Harrys ears. The lamenting instrumental and deep voice became clearer outside the door, and Harry looked at both Ron and Draco, who seemed bewildered, before pushing the door open silently. Dean and Michael were standing in the middle of the room, Take Me to Church by Hosier blasting from a speaker. It was about three-quarters of the way through, and the two were belting it out. The other boys watched in either amusement or annoyance.
DADA has the class duelling, revealing the struggles of some of the students. Harry has quidditch practice, and then he, Ron, Dean, and Draco have some fun.
“Malfoy—” Harry called out, but the boy had already snapped his curtains shut. He tried to convince himself that the sound he heard from behind the curtain wasn’t real… that he’d only imagined the muffled scream or sob of frustration that had torn from the other boy’s throat. His chest burned.
“I didn’t, but Draco did. Last night. He came over to me in the common room with a piece of parchment and a wicked grin and I just
“No, it’s not magic. There’s a tube on the inside.” Harry twisted the end off, pulling out the tube and handing it across to him.
“Would you like to scrimmage? Neither of our teams seem to be doing trials and we still have another thirty minutes.”
Harry nodded his head towards the side of the pitch. “She’s already training over there with Jimmy.”
“Snake got your tongue?” Ernie asked. “Worried you’ll make more of a fool of yourself? Let loose some dark secrets?”
Harry frowned, twiddling a pen between his thumb and index finger on his left hand as he thought of what to say. ‘
Ron gave him an incredulous look as Harry smiled at him. Harry said nothing, but Dean and Ron both made faces at him throughout the game, rolling their eyes jokingly saying he’d never win. However, their initial reactions to his comment about winning were no match for the
It started as strictly a symptom of anxiety, back in sixth year. The stress was too much for him, and when he became overwhelmed, upset, scared, or anxious, he often was sick as a result. However, it had evolved passed that… and he wasn’t in control anymore.
Hermione was chuckling as she scribbled an answer on her paper, and Susan and Sue seemed amused, judging by the nodding and laughing coming from them. Pansy, across from Draco, was simply beaming at her friend, and Harry knew why. She didn’t get to see him like this much anymore. And Harry hoped beyond hope that they’d all see more of his sense of humour and snark over the coming months.
Pansy was trying to draw his attention away, but when it didn’t work, she glanced up at Harry and shrugged. “It’s the bird, I think. But I don’t know why.”
Harry stuffed eggs into his mouth the next morning, scrolling through a list of drill ideas Ginny had sent him the night before. Ron sat beside him, immersed in conversation with Hermione while she flipped through the Daily Prophet. They’d only been there for twenty minutes, but Ron had already finished twice the amount that Harry had, but then again, Harry didn’t usually have much of an appetite. Not like he used to.
Harry’s phone buzzed against his leg and he pulled it out. ‘Him and I have never been friends. But lately he just wants to help and idk what to do. I’m not very trusting… never have been. But like symptoms wise? This is embarrassing. I get a lot of panic attacks and nightmares, and usually one will lead to the other, which sometimes leads to just a full on breakdown, which is even more embarrassing. Flashbacks, too. I just… I get a lot of things that trigger me I guess. And it’s stupid there’s so many things that get to me and I hate it its like it never stops and idk what to do about it I just want it to stop. I jump at everything and I constantly have headaches. Sometimes I snap at people but I don’t mean to. And I try to act normal but sometimes it’s too hard and I just can’t and then ppl get worried about me but I don’t want them too bc I’m a worthless piece of shit and I’ve caused too much damage and I have to stop talking now or you’ll figure out who I am.’
“Yeah. I’m not used to him being so quiet and drawn back. I’ve tried to talk to him, but he won’t say anything. Just pushes me away. We’ve always been close, so that makes it more weird.”
Harry rolled his eyes, picking up a seven of clubs. Then Justin pulled a card, stared Hermione right in the eyes, then cried, “31!”
The boys all looked at each other. “Well,” Seamus said. “Anyone care to find out how they managed to fit us all into one room?” There was some laughter from the group of boys as they followed Seamus to the stairs.
“Hang on a minute,” a deep voice said. Goyle sat up from the darkness a few beds over. “Malfoy. Are you growing soft? Do I need to alert the press?”
Malfoy looked up at all the eyes staring at him. He picked at his fingers in his lap. “Draco. I speak French and I… er—”
“I know, but even within the houses. Since first year I haven’t exactly meshed well with Lavender and Parvati’s personalities, and Kellah, Fay, and Annie have always been quiet. But they’re
“Clearly.” Both boys heads whipped to the side as Hermione slid in beside Ron, dropping her bag on the seat. “Before, you two
“Just stop.” There were tears in his eyes, Harry could see them from their proximity, but he held them back as he spoke. Malfoy returned to his book.
Immediately, a phone dinged nearby. Harry held his breath—it was at the Slytherin table. He watched as a white-blond head of hair leaned over, took a phone from a bag, and read the message. Pansy and Blaise leaned over, too.
“Secret,” Hermione said, a finger to her lips. Then she laughed again, finishing the last of her muffin. “How about you guys? Was it awkward?”
“Me too. Honestly, Harry,” she said, glancing up from her stirring. “I was really worried about this arrangement. But I like it. A lot.”
Green eyes flew open and he pushed himself upright, tears already streaming down his face. “I’m sorry,” he gulped. “I’m so sorry, Ron.”
only children. All very young. Especially when this started, when they were only 14. Now, at 18, Draco was a shell of the confident, arrogant boy Harry had known. Who he’d possibly been taught to be. But whatever he had been, he wasn’t that now. And Harry desperately wanted him to stop crying… to take this pain he was feeling and… and… he didn’t know. But he knew that on top of whatever suffering was going-on post-war… there was something else. It had triggered something else. Possibly something that had been dormant…
Blaise smirked. “He was clearly holding Harry right against his chest. I mean, when I’ve gotten him through nightmares or vice-versa we’ve hugged each other, but never like
A moment later a new voice startled Harry’s attention away from his phone once again. Pansy was standing next to Hermione, a plate of food and a cup of steaming tea in her hands. “Can I sit here?”
“Yeah. We’ve talked about it quite a bit, actually. He’s told me about some of what happened to him during the war and how it came to be. About, uh… different symptoms he’s experiencing.” She raised her brows. “After that fire in charms he kept pushing me away, saying he was fine even though he was crying on the floor and Goyle had just shoved him into the wall and blamed him relentlessly for his friend’s death. Oh, and also telling him that he’d make his life a living hell.”
Malfoy, Harry noticed, never came to breakfast that morning—but he did beat them to potions. He was the first one there, already copying the instructions from the board. Harry and Hermione slid into their seats, with Ron in front of them, speaking lowly until the class began to fill with other students. They chatted through most of the class, gossiping and laughing as they brewed that day’s potion. Blaise sat across the aisle with Malfoy, but despite the darker skinned boy’s efforts, the blond never spoke to him.
Hey all! I hope that you enjoy this chapter. Let me know your thoughts. The next chapter is coming soon. Until next time! -Emma :)
Hey all! I just wanted to let you know that I am not done with this story! I will continue to write it and I actually have a half-finished chapter open right now! I've just been so busy with work training and school and I didn't have many chapters planned out like I normally would so I was struggling a little to get this chapter written. But I am determined to get it done and finish this story! Thank you all for the continued support, and I'll see you all soon!
The Great Hall was bustling with students when they walked in, as per usual, the smell of eggs and sausage mingling with the sugary sweet scent of cereals like Pixie Puffs. Yawning, Ron slid onto the bench beside Hermione and gave her a peck on the cheek.
Harry’s attention shifted entirely to the front of the room. The young girl who sat on the stool looked exactly like the young version of Cho Chang that Harry could remember. He pursed his lips, nodding to himself.
Malfoy’s eyes turned to icy daggers. “Funny. What I was going to say was that I’m actually really interested in becoming a healer
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled, crumbs falling back onto his plate. Blaise looked up at him with a face that said, ‘
‘I need someone to help bring me back to my senses, like what’s really happening around me. Get me to breathe I guess. That’s what I struggle with the most. It doesn’t help if ur rough w me. Makes it worse actually. Like if ur gunna touch me, which can work, don’t just grab me, u know? I already startle easily.’
Stray tears leaked onto Draco’s shirt as Harry calmed. He was still trembling, but Draco suspected that was due to the dream crucio and not so much from fear. Harry pulled back, swiping at his face, watching Draco’s concerned eyes watching him. He sniffed. “I’m sorry.”
Carefully, Harry opened the door and stepped through. All of the boys had their curtains drawn and seemed to be sleeping. All except one—Malfoy. The blond Slytherin was laying on his left side, wand lighting the words of his book. Harry frowned, crossing the room to his bed. Though he thought the other boy’s eyes were trained on the lines of text, Harry didn’t see his brief, curious glance. Once in his pyjamas, Harry headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Upon emerging, he headed back to his bed… or at least, he intended to.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, eyes wandering to Draco. When his eyes snapped back to Hermione, she was smirking. “What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat at a table by the bay window, intending to do homework. Harry pulled his phone out from his pocket and opened his messages. His fingers flew over the keys, genuinely curious about the reserved Slytherin.
Draco shrugged. “Off snogging some bloke, probably,” he chuckled. Then he pulled up a chair, so he was facing them both. “What were you two starting with?”
Pansy and Blaise were watching him now, too. “It’s a muggle card game,” he explained. “Kinda similar to Blackja—nevermind. Basically, you have to collect 31 points of all the same suit. So Justin had an ace, queen, and jack of hearts, which equals 31 because the ace is eleven and the face cards are all ten. Does that make sense?”
As quietly as he could he opened his trunk, slipped on some jeans and a t-shirt, then tied his shoes. He didn’t want to wake the other boy, knowing he already had a particularly hard time sleeping. After closing the door silently, he jogged down the stairs to find Ron and Hermione. They were sitting on opposite couches from each other, Ron playing chess with Justin and Hermione reading. A plate of food between sat beside Ron that was untouched. Pansy sat beside Hermione, reading a magazine, while Blaise sat in an armchair, perusing a textbook.
It was Sue. She was staring at him with a creased brow. Harry looked at her, then at the others at the table, who were all giving him a similar look. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just texting someone that’s all.”
They were all working on homework from DADA, rifling through textbooks and scribbling answers on paper. The time passed smoothly. They chatted amongst themselves, sometimes conversing with others passing their table, sometimes laughing at each other and poking fun. Harry enjoyed it. He’d never really gotten to know Susan or Sue, and was glad that he was being given the chance to. Hermione was right, Sue was ridiculously funny, and he could see how Susan and Hermione had made fast friends through the years.
“I do. Very much. And I’m glad that you’re feeling better today. Also glad that Draco was able to calm you down last night so you weren’t by yourself.”
“Scared of some sweets, Malfoy?” Goyle boomed. “Doesn’t seem to be the only thing you cower away from.”
“What do you guys wanna do tonight?” Ron asked, looking between him and Hermione, who gave him a look.
“Nah. Hold on… Accio, pencil.” A sharpened, wooden pencil flew into Harry’s hand and he tossed it to Malfoy. “They’re made of wood. There’s graphite inside.”
Outside the curtains some of the boys had tried to go back to bed, but a few still stood nearby. Ron sat on Blaise’s bed, with Seamus and Dean nearby. Neville, Justin, and Ernie were still there as well. Ron and Blaise looked at each other, wondering if they were both thinking the same thing.
A scream came from beside them, and they instantly turned to Hermione. She was clutching the scar on her arm that Bellatrix had dug there. She’d missed dodging a hex by an inch, and it had hit her. Pansy jogged over. “I’m so sorry, Hermione. Are you alright?”
Harry shot up with a sob and a gasp, staring straight at Draco, terror and pain etched into every line of his face. He broke down, letting his head fall and sobs ripping from his body. His chest impossibly tight, Draco pulled Harry into his arms. Draco held Harry tight as he jolted and cried, horror and pain seeping from him as he sobbed into the Slytherin’s chest.
In the doorway, Ron looked over at Draco with a chuckle. “Sometimes I forget he understands all of the muggle pop-culture. He was really sheltered, but I guess he would have learned it over the summers and at school before he came to Hogwarts. Before he knew he was a wizard.”
Ten minutes or more he sat like that, water cascading down his body, over his puffy eyes, over his scars, his protruding ribs… He breathed deeply in an attempt to calm himself down.
“I dragged you up onto that stack of furniture while you were unconscious! I could’ve left you there. But I didn’t.”
“Wow. Never saw that one coming,” Hermione smirked, glancing between Harry and Ron, trying to find the blonde Hufflepuff. “Did you see the drawing Sue’s little sister sent her yesterday morning?”
The Slytherin didn’t miss a beat. “I’m bored. You’re reading. Let’s play snap.” To Harry and Ron's surprise, the two girls had been talking quite a bit since they got back, although they never did before. Ron had told Harry he thought it was because their beds were across from each other, and they had a few classes together.
Harry smiled over at Draco, but he was staring at the textbook sitting on his desk. He was blinking at it slowly, head down. Harry wondered if maybe he was remembering something that had happened. But if it was Harry’s use of sectumsempra or Crabbe’s use of fiendfyre he wasn’t sure.
Then Hermione was tugging on his sleeve, telling him it was only an accident, sounding like she was more trying to convince herself than him. Ginny sat up straight behind him, staring back at Ron through Harry’s desk legs. The rest of the class was staring at them, mouths gaping. Harry opened his mouth to speak and his voice came out raspy. “I’m sorry—we—the war—” He looked back to the front and his face softened. “Seamus…”
The table burst into laughter, everyone staring between the two. Last year this would have seemed rude to Harry. Unfair and uncalled for. But there was no venom there. He wasn’t being mean, just very sarcastic. Harry supposed that’s probably how he normally was with Pansy and Blaise. As for Hermione, it was just plain teasing on both ends from academic rivals.
“N-no,” Ron stuttered, alarmed by both his response and the warning look he received from Harry. “I was just curious…”
Harry glanced over at Ron, who was listening intently. “Well, sometimes it’s hard if you don’t press down hard enough. Some are more faint than others. You’d usually use them for math, drawing science diagrams, learning other languages…”
Ron emerged from the bathroom and strode towards him, holding his towel on. “Morning, mate.” He let the towel fall as he picked through his clothes to find his boxers. Harry raised a brow. “What? I’m too lazy to draw the curtains again and then put them back.”
Charms class that afternoon went slightly haywire. Not from the beginning, of course. It started just like any other class. Flitwick had them working on some more review, just of charms they had learned in the last couple of years to get that mindset back again. Harry sat near the top of the room, situated between Hermione and Ron. Seamus and Dean sat on Ron’s right,  goofing off with charms they’d learned over the summer. Flitwick was shaking his head at them, but his smile showed he was impressed. Hemione was talking to Sue and Padma, who were sitting nearby as well. In the next row down, Draco and Blaise were practicing the bubble-head charm. Draco had the bubble around his head, smiling at Blaise, who poked it with his wand. Draco, faking offence, backed away from his friend, pointing his wand at him.
“Absolutely not,” Justin Finch-Fletchely barked. “We are all dealing with stuff. We are all probably going to have nightmares at some point, and would probably all appreciate being woken from them. I don’t think that any of us should use silencing charms at night for that.”
we didn’t tie. Sometimes we’d be tied the whole year and come out with slightly different final grades. He’s brilliant. It’s one of the things that made him so infuriating.”
Harry smiled, then silently summoned his deck of cards from his trunk. It whizzed into his hand and he moved to sit on the floor with Justin, the carpet much softer than he’d realized. “’Mione, do you wanna play 31?”
Harry’s curtains were open, and the boy was clearly having a nightmare. He had been calling out for Fred, who had been like a brother to him. Draco knew that—he had gone to the funeral. Not that anyone remembered that.
Hermione laughed. “If last night was any indicator of what this year is gunna be like, it’ll be a riot.”
“Right… sorry. That’s Luna Lovegood, at Ravenclaw, right? I know she was part of that group you all formed a few years ago!”
The three are silent for a few moments, each caught up in their own thoughts, or, book. Harry fiddled with his wand between his fingers, the scar on his right hand catching the light. He glanced away from it to the untied lace on his shoe. Hauling his leg up onto the seat he slung one into a loop and tied it. “It’s weird, isn’t it? Coming back here? After everything… and it’s supposed to just go back to normal? I mean… nothing feels normal. I certainly don’t. This train ride doesn’t… how is this school year supposed to?”
Harry took a swig, then set the goblet down in front of him. “Draco was having a nightmare… remembering being tortured. That’s why he was screaming like that.”
Pansy blushed, looking at the table. “They usually do. I used to, too. But I came across an order form once in a magazine for muggle products like you use Hermione, and I just found them fascinating. I managed to get the conversion right I guess and order some. Now I get some for Christmas and my birthday… I don’t really know how my family manages to get them, but I’m grateful.”
He pointed his fork at her as he chewed. “You know what? I think they will.” He nudged Harry with his elbow. “Gotta do something to keep this one away from my snitch.”
Harry had mostly been asking the questions back although he already knew the answer, but for this once in particular, he was genuinely curious.
talk about the tournament? It’s bad enough that I went through it but now there’s rumours of another one so I can’t forget what happened even if I wanted to.”
Harry turned to leave but hesitated as he stepped away from his bed. He shook his head, took a few more steps, then turned again. He stared at Malfoy laying on his stomach, hair blocking his eyes from view. He sighed to himself, stepping closer to the other boy. He stole himself before asking, “Are you okay?” There was no way the other boy didn’t hear him in the stark silence, but he did not give any indication that he had heard Harry. “Malfoy?” Still nothing. “Malfoy. Are you okay?”
There was a pause for a few moments as Harry scrawled the answer to the first question from his potions homework down on a piece of parchment. His eyes flit back and forth between his book and his paper, drops of ink dotting his path. He cursed, removing them with his wand, then checked his phone when it lit up. ‘Its an escape’
He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them again, he found that Harry’s piercing green eyes were still boring into him. “I’m fine.”
“G—George hates me,” he sobbed. “Why are you still my friend when I-I’m the, the reason your brother’s dead?”
“I thought lying to Voldemort and saving my life would have been enough to keep her out of Azkaban.”
“You’re not fine,” he whispered, resting a hand on Draco’s upper back. Draco pushed him off again, turning his head away from whoever was there with him, not aware enough to be able to tell. He couldn’t stop the sobs that tore from his throat, and he shook his head at himself, barely able to draw in a breath. “Draco…”
“Does it work for you?” Draco asked, not wanting to show just how much he cared about the answer to that question.
Draco lets himself believe Pansy’s words for a moment, looking up at Potter who is now throwing a cushion at Weasley with a grin, showing off a set of bright, straight teeth. He lets himself imagine how it would feel to date Potter, to be able to hold his hand and call him by his given name as casually as so many others do – like he’s always secretly wanted to – and just for that brief moment his stomach swarms with a thousand fluttering butterflies.
