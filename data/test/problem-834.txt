he thought.
Not that she didn’t get along with those of the male persuasion. In fact, she usually had more in common with men than women, for the most part. But these were alpha male types, constantly preening and posturing and trying to outdo each other for how macho they could be. Dempsey had chosen to show his supposed “manliness” by giving Vesper a demeaning nickname within five minutes of meeting her. She could only assume that his thinking behind this was that by picking the “weakest” trainee among the group to torment, he would be less likely to have to endure any retaliation.
“Good,” Harry said curtly, turning. “I’ll get us some tea, then.”
He took Draco’s hand and started them in the direction of the 8
“You know who it is.”
Per Kemp’s instructions, he then relayed his schedule to her so that she could put it in the books and start arranging clients for him. With that he took his leave, feeling better about the prospect of his apprenticeship than he had in a long while.
Many had teased him over the years for how he talked to his cat like she was a human, but that never bothered Scorpius. Samara had quite a bit of kneazle in her and was damned intelligent, and they had only known each other a few months before they could understand each other perfectly. She had still been a kitten, then.
Hannah looked down at the floor a moment, and Draco knew that she had the information. Of course, she would have taken the time to ask, knowing he would want to know. “Six to eight months.” Draco bowed his head at her words. “But that’s without treatment,” she went on quickly, putting a hand on his arm. “She could undergo regular Regeneration Charms here, and if she was willing to take the potion regimen, she could stretch that out to two to three years, Kipling says.”
him. And besides which, you’re the one who’s just realized you fancy him, whereas he’s been pining for ages while simultaneously thinking you don’t return the feelings. So really, it ought to be you asking, don’t you think?”
Off to their left they caught a glimpse of diners enjoying a simple and elegant meal in what looked like a Japanese tea house, and then farther up on the right a large party was watching their servers removing an entire roasted pig from a pit that had been dug into the sandy ground.
“I’m sorry.”
Draco shrugged, then rested his chin on his hands, which were folded over Harry’s chest. He gazed at Harry with large, gray eyes. “I figured we were working our way up to it.”
Draco preened for a moment, then offered Harry a soft and somewhat sheepish smile. “I can’t take all the credit. Pansy did something quite similar to me back in November.”
Mila shook her head. “That doesn’t matter,” she said.
She rolled her eyes. “Just go in, Dempsey, and get it over with. It won’t be that bad.”
Draco watched the star anise pod bob around in his mulled wine, hearing only vaguely the way his mother cooed temperately over whatever box of jewelry she’d just opened. Considering there were five she’d already opened, and at least another two or three to go, Draco had to wonder how she mustered the enthusiasm for even that.
“That’s it, Harry,” Draco rasped, his mouth dry. “Come for me. Come all over me.”
“Yes,” Harry agreed.
“This isn’t like that god-awful gel you used to use in first year, for Merlin’s sake,” Pansy replied. “This won’t stiffen it, just let it holds it’s shape for the night so it doesn’t go flat during the reception and all that dancing you too are bound to do.”
, in way that will let us both get what we want. Like how you and Professor Potter did things. At your own pace, marrying once you were settled in your careers, not having a child until you’d had some time to
“Yeah. Why not.”
“No,” she said, her voice a bit shaky. “You just thought I couldn’t handle the truth. You thought I was too fragile to hear that it simply was that you weren’t attracted to me.”
Stomping on the stairs startled both adults from their silent thoughts, and soon Teddy appeared at the bottom of the staircase. Draco saw Andromeda quickly wipe her eyes.
“You recovered nicely,” Harry said. “Just make sure to keep your eyes open.”
Men were visual creatures. She knew this. They ogled; they gawked; they drooled. She didn’t usually mind so much, honestly. But she expected them to keep it to themselves, and she certainly expected them to keep it under control in a workplace environment.
“Yeah?”
“I’ve decided to stay single for a while. After everything that’s happened recently… it’s what I’ve felt I needed, to, you know, get my head on right.”
“And he never said as much to you.”
“All right, I’ll go. I can’t make any promises about hitting it off with your friend, though,” he added, in reaction to Pansy’s triumphant smile. “I hope you won’t give him any expectations.”
Kyle grinned at the ceiling. “For me too,” he answered.
“You go on,” Harry told him, enjoying talking to Neville, as well as Hannah and Pansy, who had now joined them in their conversation. “I’ll watch.”
He pulled back, his brow furrowing a little. “You made it clear to him…”
“They’re all exquisite,” said Harry. “Any of them would be a fine choice.”
it to be true. And I can’t… I want to start making choices for myself, and not for others. I want to do something other than hunting dark wizards. I want more from my life.”
Harry nodded, and Draco shook his head in disbelief. “If there’s anything I’ve learned about sex,” said Harry, “it’s that it’s all about communication, both verbal and non-verbal. It was easy to pick up on what you liked.”
Draco shrugged. “People act all kinds of ways when they’re scared or hurt. But it is often just that: an act.”
“He could do it on a permanent basis,” Vesper said. “The Auror Corps would be better off for it, honestly. We did this great practical lesson today on pensieve memories… apparently Ron designed it himself, said the classroom portion used to be too traditional on that subject, so he changed it. It was amazing. I learned so much.”
“I figured,” said Harry with a smirk. “You were locked up in his room practically all day yesterday.”
“So why aren’t you miserable?”
And the next day he was gone, and things
Dean cleared his throat and took a sip of whiskey. “It’s complicated,” he supplied, making Theo snort.
Harry grimaced. He knew he probably should have written to Molly Weasley, explaining the situation, but he didn’t know if she would want to hear from him, and he definitely didn’t know what he would say to her.
Harry and Draco both chuckled.
It was almost funny, the utter disbelief in Malfoy’s voice. “It’s, uh…” Harry tried to reply, interrupting himself with a few nervous chuckles. It was a legitimate question actually, and one Harry wasn’t entirely sure how to answer.
“Yeah.” Kyle nuzzled Clint’s nose with his, and he received a peck on the lips in return. “We should do that all the time.”
They continued to cook as he told her about what was going on at the Foundation and how smoothly the after school program was running.
to have, that they know they’re not supposed to have. And they can’t help it.”
Harry considered that. “Couldn’t we just rehydrate the skin before we add it to the potion?”
“Whose portrait is that?” he asked, to make conversation.
“You’re being utterly ridiculous,” Draco told him. “And not in the usual way.”
If anything, Kyle’s apparent ability to be attracted to Clint only made things more confusing. Because he still wasn’t sure he could feel
Harry snorted. “I can imagine. Although what they didn’t know was that Voldemort was really a half-blood, too.”
The term was back in full swing now that everyone had returned from the Easter holidays, meaning he had to keep up with all of his professorial duties, even those he had invented himself, like overseeing Raisie McNeal’s NEWT level research. Still, he had been glad to take Francesca up on her offer for him and Harry to enjoy some social time in her quarters, even if he would have to cut it a bit short. He was craving any opportunity he could get to be around adults, as teenagers were currently taking a large part of his time and energy.
, because that wasn’t really the point. Blaise was well-known enough by that point (in fact, he and Vesper both were, since they spent a great deal of time with Harry and Draco, and Vesper was a dueling champion and Blaise a successful businessman), that there would likely be some commentary and word-of-mouth gossip about the fact he was taking a woman from a prominent pureblood family to the gala, rather than the American daughter of Muggleborns that he had been attached to unwaveringly for the past three or so years. The news would come back to Vesper, one way or another.
should be the one to do it, not you.”
“So, in truth, him being
Kemp stared at Harry with narrowed eyes and a small smile on his face, stroking his beard thoughtfully. “I like that,” he said finally. “That is very interesting.”
“And if we are?”
“Hello, Harry dear,” Molly said, coming over to give him a kiss on the cheek, which he returned. “You’re just in time. I was preparing lunch for everyone.”
They entered the suite to find the rest of Draco’s side of the party – Blaise, Hannah, and Theo – all dressed but, like Pansy, not yet groomed. There was also a photographer, standing around and looking a bit bored as he fiddled with his camera. There was a collective sigh of relief as they all caught sight of Draco and a round of “thank the gods” and “where have you been” before Pansy shut them all up.
with. A guy who was smart and sexy but also kind, who supported you when things were difficult. Who took care of you. The guy you managed to drive away because of all your own baggage and because you acted like an arsehole when he decided he wanted to change careers and build a life that would satisfy him. And you just couldn’t live with it. And you’re insecure and scared and now he’s gone and you need someone to make you feel better. So you start sleeping with Marco. Because at least he’s hot and cool and he’s into you. And yeah… he’s not Kyle Bergeron. But he’s better than nothing. He’s better than feeling this alone.”
Draco laughed. “Ha! This is bloody brilliant.” He looked around the room, Harry did the same, to see that there was a diverse range of emotions being expressed around them. “I think it’s safe to say we’ve got the best in the class,” Draco said conspiratorially.
“Have you or Liam told them about what the other kids are saying?”
“Hey,” a masculine voice said from the doorway, and Harry turned to see Ron standing there, his expression one of sympathy.
Which didn’t make any sense. Because Draco had moved on. Hadn’t he?
Teddy took Harry’s hand. “Can we talk alone for a minute, please?”
“Ok, Daddy,” the boy replied, before running off. Both men followed him with their eyes, making sure he did as he was told. He looked back at them before settling himself on a little patch of dirt not far from the water. Draco returned his attention to Harry, satisfied.
“Fucking
“Ah, well, can’t hurt to keep some, run some diagnostics,” he said. “I’ll fetch us a bowl, shall I?”
to do one particular thing if you don’t want to. You have obligations to yourself as well, to your own happiness.”
Draco searched the room and spotted Potter at a small table in the corner, a firewhiskey in front of him that looked mostly untouched. He was…
She asked the neighbors what they knew of the man who lived in the sweet blue house, but they didn't have much information to give. He had a foreign-sounding name, they remembered, something German perhaps. He was very friendly but kept mostly to himself. He had visitors, but rarely anyone from the neighborhood. He was never a bother to anyone.
“We got Draco his first real broom at age eight,” said Narcissa.
your sister’s, and having heard Lindsey tell me about her projects earlier tonight… I can’t help but think that what I’ve contributed to the world pales in comparison. Made even worse by the fact that we’re sitting here in my family’s mansion, which I had been hoping you would find impressive, but now I’m thinking you’re going to find it the opposite and think I’m some upper-class prat who’s never worked a day in his life.”
I packed a lot in here. I hope it's good. You'll just have to let me know :) I have to give a special shoutout to those who have been rereading the story and giving me new comments, whether it was once or on multiple chapters. You really boosted my writing energy and I don't think I'd be posting now if it wasn't for you. So thanks!!!
Draco wasn’t sure what to say to that. Was Harry right? Was Lucius angry at
If he were kneeling in front of a man like that, with a hard, naked cock in front of him, would he want to suck on it?
“Muggles just like things rather shiny and new, I suppose.”
He turned back, scowling. “Don’t make me out to be the bad guy here. You know it’s not that I want to push you to do something you don’t want to do, but don’t think I haven’t noticed-“
“No, the coffee was fine,” Kyle said honestly. “I mean, it was uncomfortable, like I thought it would be. But Draco was nice. We talked for a long time. He helped me, I think.”
Ron snorted delicately. “All right. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. I know everybody has their secrets.”
“You brought him with you,” said George to Harry, by way of greeting, as he looked Draco up and down with a sly grin. “A snake among lions. It takes courage, I’ll give you that.”
“Hey, I was only asking.”
“Where are we going, exactly?”
, he thought,
The high of his orgasm was so heady that it wasn’t until the fog cleared that he was aware of Harry’s cock rubbing along his skin. He turned his head to look behind him, and saw that Harry was using his hand as well as a globe of Draco’s arse to give his own cock some friction, looking as wanton as Draco felt as he ground against the blond. Their eyes locked.
“Good. What does that tell you?”
“Yeah, that sounds pretty good actually,” Kyle replied, removing Draco’s jumper easily and without any fuss at all. “And if you could throw in a few embarrassing sounds or turns of phrase once I have my mouth around your dick, that might help too.”
Draco nodded. “I just didn’t want her to see photographs of them together in the society pages, or something. That would have been worse, I think.”
“She was really supportive,” he said. “That was a relief, because I was kind of worried that she would be disappointed in me, since she had fought pretty hard for me during 5
“You told me,” Kyle said.
“Ok,” Evan said, nodding. “Yeah, ok. I hear you.” He sniffed and swiped at his nose. “I’ll do better. I’ll
“I know,” she replied softly. “I saw him. It’s fine. We’re on good terms.”
Draco stared at Harry. “What?”
, too. He always has been, even if he didn’t live with us.”
Kyle let out a surprised breath that almost sounded like a laugh. “I’ve been better, actually.” He looked at Clint, seeing that his expression had softened. “Look, Clint, I-“
And so he found Hogwarts. Again. After seven years. It would be a fresh start, he decided. A chance to begin again, and to do something worthwhile in the process. At least, that was what he hoped.
It was a slow process, though. Clint only shared new things on occasion. But each new nugget of information was like a treasure; it was always interesting, and even more precious for its rarity. Kyle was learning to appreciate that.
Draco wasn’t holding back, practically fucking himself on Harry’s cock, and Harry could feel the pleasure building, threatening to spill over. He knew needed to feel Draco’s orgasm around him, and soon.
Hermione suddenly felt like crying. Everything from the past week was hitting her all at once, but it was more than that. She was both moved and disconcerted by Ron’s words. She loved that he had become so thoughtful, that he considered her needs before his own so much of the time now. She wasn’t sure if it was simply a result of getting older or if his job as an Auror had anything to do with it, but Ron had become a much more down-to-earth and serious person in the last few years. He hadn’t lost his sense of humor or his playfulness, which she was quite glad of, but he had certainly matured.
“Thursday afternoon is best,” said Harry.
“Is it me, or have we been here before?” He gave her a weak, but wry, smile.
Harry raised surprised eyebrows before thinking that over. “To spare her feelings?”
The only person he’d ever told about the sorting hat was Dad-Harry, because his dad had told him once about how he’d asked the hat not to put him somewhere when he was being sorted. He thought Dad-Harry would understand, and he had.
“Nonsense. I didn’t
They settled themselves comfortably and Narcissa informed the elves they would like some food. Then she presented Harry with a quite large leather-bound book full of drawings, photographs, and color samples.
He took it and read it to himself. “While in the field an Auror should always know his or her exact Apparition coordinates,” he quoted aloud, after a minute. “This allows for a speedy rescue from backup in times of distress.” He looked up at Vesper again. “That makes… complete and total sense.” He handed the handbook back to her.
Harry was reaching for climax, but Draco got there first, by only a few seconds. All it took was feeling the hot splash of cum on his hand and Draco shuddering against him, and Harry found he was joining him in bliss, clutching that hard body against him as pleasure ripped through him, concentrated in his cock but reaching to the tips of his fingers in the aftershocks.
part), wanted to jump back into bed and have his way with Harry now. But his thoughts turned to the boy downstairs, waiting for them, and he knew in truth he wouldn’t change the way things were now. They had a whole day ahead of them, to eat, clean, play at the park, talk, relax, and be together. And he wouldn’t want it any other way.
“No! My particular dislike of the Weasel is, in this case, irrelevant.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry caught his smile for a brief second before he turned away.
are you talking about?”
After exchanging brief smiles Harry set to the task of washing up and Draco followed his friend down the hall to the front door. When they arrived, they paused, and Pansy grabbed his arm.
“I don’t know what to think, Harry,” Ron told him as they made their way to another Quidditch practice Sunday afternoon. “Hermione’s being so analytical about it all. She comes to me yesterday with a list of reasons that we should be together. An actual bloody
“I am.”
“Of course,” said Harry.
After some yelling and a very pointed look at Teddy, Harry insisted they go up to Teddy’s room for the next hour before dinner.
“I think I’d like to take a walk,” Dudley said suddenly. He looked at Petunia. “Mum, would you like to join me?”
Kyle grinned in triumph, but also in affection. At first he had thought the way Clint downplayed his own accomplishments was him taking his good fortune for granted. Now Kyle understood just how hard the man worked, and how much he saw hard work as just a part of life. Kyle hoped he could convince him to celebrate the rewards too. He took Clint’s hand on the table, the one that wasn’t clutching his drink, running his fingers lightly over his knobbly knuckles, which had gone a bit dry and ashy from the cold.
talking about sex.” She felt her heart start to thump painfully. “That’s what this is about? You’re pissed at me because we haven’t had sex yet?”
“Ready?” Harry asked.
“Yeah. But this moment was particularly… pivotal. At least for me. Something happened, and you helped me.”
Vesper gave him a look. “Don’t start in on the safety stuff again with me, please.”
“The hassle of coming out. You said… back in October, when we first…” Harry rolled his shoulders, and Draco immediately knew that Harry was somehow upset, or perhaps annoyed. “You said you didn’t know if it would be worth the hassle. Obviously you changed your mind. Obviously this… Kyle is worth the hassle.”
Harry gave him a small smile. “You made me work for it pretty hard most of the time.”
“Because I don’t need it.”
“How very quaint,” Draco remarked, earning a snort from Harry. He felt his cheeks redden, realizing in that moment he could still sound like a bit of a snob sometimes.
When he did finally get hungry, he called for Winky, who was happy to bring him scones and a mug of tea from the kitchens. He sat on the grass, warmed his hands with the hot drink, and thought.
“That’s because…” Draco began, but realized that, while he had plenty of arguments for that, he really had no
“Thanks, Clint,” he said. “You’re a great person, you know.” He said it as much for himself as he did for the other wizard, because it was something worth remembering. “A better man than I am.”
That made Vesper laugh. “That sounds fun. I’m not dating right now, but I could use a friend too.” He smiled. “I can’t do it tonight, though. I have plans.” This was sort of true. She had promised Harry and Draco she would floo call them in the evening to tell them about her first day at the Academy, and she found she was really looking forward to it. That, and getting to be home on her own for a few hours. “Maybe later in the week?” she offered.
Vesper came into work the following Monday feeling jittery and excited. She was officially an Auror! Well, a Junior Auror, but still. It was something.
“Look, I’m not saying it was wrong for you to end things with Ginny, but seeing as you did, I don’t think you have a right to poke your nose into her life like that.”
Harry started. “That’s not possible.” He followed the trajectory of Draco’s pointed finger and saw, with a spasm of surprise, that his boyfriend was right. There was most definitely a portrait of him, where there hadn’t been before. It was linked by a gold thread to Sirius’ image.
“Well, you could start by finishing that sentence you didn’t finish. Your aunt apologized for her part in your…” He waited, letting the unfinished sentence hang between them.
each other, after a while, if that makes sense. They ended up being primary partners and only brought in secondary partners on occasion. They even moved in together, eventually. That’s when I decided it was about time for me to move on, and I stopped seeing both of them. It had fizzled out anyway.”
It's just so hard to see this one come to an end! Over a year of my life went into this, and I'm pretty sure it's the most personal thing I have ever written, including all of my original work. I have drawn from my own experience in some way for almost every character, and I've gotten very attached. I don't know what to do with myself now! (Actually, just kidding. There's so much else to do right now it's not even funny. But still...)
She laughed again, and he leaned down to capture her lips with his. This time she took a little more control, pressing herself against him and running her hands along his back. He hummed against her lips, seeming to like that, and her insides clenched in pleasure at the sound.
Vesper didn’t say anything, her eyes still narrowed and her pale lips in a thoughtful pout. “Are you sure?” she asked, after a minute.
“I agree that we should keep an eye on Teddy’s emotional state, however, and make sure he does always have an outlet for expressing his feelings directly, when he’s ready to do so.”
Draco shook his head, kissing Harry firmly. “We can only hope.”
“No,” said Harry, his brow furrowed. “It’s the doorbell.”
“Madam Lorenz brought a group from the orphanage for their pre-Hogwarts check-ups, and this came up in one of the exams.”
Eamon looked irritated but said nothing as the two made their way downstairs, wands drawn, stepping very carefully so as not to make a sound. Vesper and Declan both found themselves doing the same, even though they could be neither seen nor heard by anyone in the memory, of course. But it was just so quiet, they couldn’t help it.
Hermione laughed at this characterization of the situation, as if Harry’s popularity was merely a spot of bad weather that had to be ridden out. “And you’re letting him go it alone, I see.”
. Draco was struck by the thought. He’d nearly forgotten why they were here in the first place.
, she told herself, as she had done a thousand times already.
“You’re only eighteen, Harry. You have plenty of time to figure it out. And we haven’t even graduated yet.”
Clint gaped at him some more. “A date?” he asked breathlessly.
“He was. It’s just that flirtation is a permanent state of being for you, so you’ve lost the ability to read the signs.”
Vesper waved a hand dismissively. “It’s no big deal. He’s harmless. I showed him up pretty thoroughly during physical training today, and he even got to see me duel, so I think I’ve intimidated him into submission for now. But I do look forward to the day I get to duel him myself.”
Draco smiled. He didn’t
“Tell me everything. What did you say? What did
“Ron and Hermione aren’t soul mates,” said Harry. “Because there is no such thing. Love is just two people choosing each other over and over again. It’s not destiny. It’s a choice. And whatever choice either of them make, I have to stand by them, because they are important to me.” Hadn't both of his best friends stood by him during some of the most reckless and stupid mistakes of his life? How could he not do the same for them?
“I want you to be happy, Ron. I want both of you to be happy. Does being with Hermione make you happy?”
“I should go,” Draco said, after a minute.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “Somehow.”
“Would you like some… guidance?” he heard Potter ask.
“No need to be. I mean, it was my decision. It just wasn’t working out, and I didn’t see the point in continuing.”
my time with her?”
“Of course,” Harry said, not about to call her out or tease her in front of their companion. “How’s the vineyard?”
“That’s true,” Kyle said. “I’ll think about it.” It wasn’t a bad idea, actually. Though he could see himself feeling guilty for starting a new project when he had three others left unfinished. And he never did all that well with guilt.
“They’re exquisite,” Hermione said honestly. “But it’s way too much. We can’t afford these.” She realized her tone sounded disapproving, ungrateful, and she hardly wanted to sound that way, but…
“So tight,” Draco said, aware of the awe in his voice.
“His name is Edmund Troyer. We just arrested him on possession, but in truth we wanted to bring him in because he has affiliations with the Fearon smuggling ring. It’s the best lead we’ve had in a while, so we need to do this one right. He's already been stewing for hours. Hopefully, if he's tired, hungry, anxious about what's going to happen to him... Well, with any luck, this will be a quick one. But we'll see.”
Max nodded. “Ok.”
Harry nodded. “Please, Sir,” he said.
“Hi, Draco,” Harry said. His tone was neutral, maybe even a little flat, but it did things to Draco anyway. His heart was going double-time, and he took a deep breath.
“That’s happened to me before, too,” Harry said, sounding a little calmer. “It used to happen a lot more. Even little things would trigger it. But it sort of went away. I guess I figured I was over all of it, but maybe not.”
was, hoping she would simply take his word for it.
Draco’s smile widened. “Yes, it was.” Harry continued to stare at him, and Draco could feel himself drifting. He wanted Harry’s warmth again. “Come here, love,” he said. “Be with me. Stay with me.”
This was an important opportunity, and Vesper didn't want to mess it up.
“How is he?” Draco asked.
It would be so easy. Which was exactly why he couldn’t let himself do it.
Draco finally finished, and Harry felt like throwing himself at the other man and kissing him senseless. Unfortunately, they hadn’t arrived at that part of the ceremony yet. And he supposed the next bit
“I’m sure,” said Draco. He took a sip from the cup in his hand, fighting a grimace. It was the cheap stuff. But at least it was hot. He forced himself to swallow.
Teddy had reached the bottom of the stairs and was looking between the two men and smiling.
In order to relax and take her mind off things, Vesper curled up on her her sofa with a blanket to read a book. She was currently working her way through all the major works of Kurt Vonnegut, though it was slow-going because she didn’t have much time or energy to read anymore. She found her current endeavor,
It was always better after a shower, and this morning was no exception. Now dressed, Draco set about preparing his breakfast, enjoying the quiet of the house. He heated a skillet on the range and set three strips of bacon to cook before putting boiling water on for his tea and porridge. Though Harry had told him he could always make the porridge in the microwave, Draco found it very hard to get used to the idea. He still didn’t quite trust it to cook the hot cereal properly.
Harry pulled it out, just a little bit, and pushed it back in again.
“So… I wasn’t out… shagging other people, if that’s what you were assuming.” He rolled his eyes at Draco’s furrowed brow. “I was visiting Ron and Hermione. She was about to have the baby, and I wanted to be away from Hogwarts a bit, to clear my head. And then she gave birth and I decided to just keep visiting, to help out, to spend time with them, and with Rose. My new goddaughter.”
philosophical then. And perhaps you’re a bit too technical. What a fine pair we make.”
“Of course you’re not.”
want more?”
And then they were kissing again, the deep, probing kind that Harry always used to make Draco lose himself, to make him forget everything but their lips, their tongues, their breath. It was how he kept Draco present, in the here and now, in all the good that they were feeling rather than anticipating or worrying about what came next.
“Maybe for some,” said Harry, finally moving his queen, though he knew it was futile. Draco took her with his pawn. “But I always just operate on instinct. I react to what’s in front of me.”
“It’s all right, 'Mione, You don’t have to.”
Kyle blinked at him.
“And they wanted you isolated too, obviously, so you had nowhere to turn for help.”
Harry let out the breath he was holding and, after a moment of deliberation, nodded. They had agreed. Forget the past. Begin again.
“How can I resist you when you sound like that?” the brunet asked.
He started at the base of Draco’s neck, kissing and licking his way down the spine. Draco gripped the headboard as he writhed and ground his arse against Harry. He knew what was coming, and he was anxious for it.
“Draco told me that you are to start apprenticing with a master duelist this term. Is that what you want to do, become a duelist?”
“Harry,” Draco replied.
“Hey,” Clint said, when he was within talking distance.
She was looking at him with a helplessness he’d always found hard to resist. She was so soft, delicate, harmless. It was difficult to believe that she was capable of hurting him the way she had hurt him.
“About the same was when you asked me ten minutes ago.”
The floo chimed.
Draco let out a small grunt of acknowledgment, his gaze focused on the notes he was arranging meticulously in front of him.
“What the hell are you on about?”
Harry had been so gentle with him. He knew why, and it made sense. It being Draco’s first time, of course he would take it slow, letting him feel it out, adjust. Harry was considerate like that.
Harry went very still. “All right…”
One-on-one, you know where to put your focus. Your partner and their pleasure are what matter. But with two of them… I just couldn’t get into it. I was too focused on if each of them were having a good time and making sure that neither of them was left out, like you said and I… well, I suppose I ended up making myself a bit left out, in the end. I got off and everything but I just felt… weird.”
“Mm,” said Draco. He didn’t know how to deal with this feeling he was having, like he wanted to wrap Harry in his arms and never let him go, only it wasn’t this grown Harry he wanted to do that for, it was the small Harry, the one that didn’t really exist anymore.
Draco shrugged, but Harry thought perhaps Draco
Harry sighed. “No,” he said simply.
“Yeah. I know.”
“Hm,” said Harry. “You don’t say.”
“Of course.” Narcissa Black’s Christmas Eve party was always an elaborate and well-attended affair since they had begun the tradition four years ago. Vesper was actually surprised she was throwing one this year, given that she was also throwing a wedding only a few weeks later. But Narcissa Black also never did anything by halves. “Wouldn’t miss it.”
Still, he made an effort, reaching out a hand for the Gryffindor to shake and congratulating him on the post. Longbottom was more than gracious, friendly even, and said that he was looking forward to all of their joint work together, as the Herbology and Potions professors had considerable overlap in their subjects. Draco had managed to smile and return the sentiment, though inside he was rather bitter at the reminder. If Draco stayed on at Hogwarts past this year, as he had every intention of doing, he and Longbottom were going to be working together closely. And Draco was going to have to find a way to live with that.
“That may be true,” said Harry. “But I care about him. And I think I owe it to him to trust him at his word, whatever he says. I have to respect what he says he wants, rather than try to force him to want something… to admit… I don’t know. I just don’t want to pressure him. It’s more complicated, like you said. It’s not just about his divorce and what his ex-wife did. It’s also his parents, who are very… traditional. It’s about his fear of coming out, even to his closest friends. I mean, all last year, we had to keep our sleeping together a secret…”
Draco’s only response was an incredulous silence, but it didn’t last long. Their conversation had woken Teddy, and he was fussing about, now, kicking at Harry’s stomach.
“For what?” Potter asked, his mouth still half-reaching for Draco’s.
“Right, something like that. You know, like eating a slice of really good chocolate cake. It won’t sustain you in the long run, but it’s satisfying in the moment.” Draco arched a brown at David as he spoke, unsure of how to respond to that. “There
“That’s over a month away,” Draco said, amused. “And we’ve got all our mid-terms right before.”
It's been a hell of a long time since we've checked in on Hermione, it feels like. Here is a brief glimpse into how things are going for her. We'll get a heftier one from her in a couple of chapters.
“It is,” Draco agreed. “And now I have this exquisite paper dragon to display on my desk.”
“Overall she has two to three years, her Healer estimates.”
“It’s all right, Hagrid. You’ll come to our graduation, right?”
Draco could fault her for all of her lies and mistakes, and he could even fault her for trying to make excuses. But he couldn’t fault her for loving her son. He couldn’t fault her for that at all.
“Like set the table and make my bed?”
“But it’s come up a couple of times. When Pansy so
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise, but Malfoy wasn’t looking at him, and didn’t see. “How did you know that?”
“Your arm,” she reminded him.
“So, she said a stupid thing,” he said. “She shouldn’t think that way. But what if she came around?”
“If I’m going to stay the night,” Draco had said impatiently, “then I have to leave early, so no one sees. You know that.”
Harry was nearing his peak. The hot, sweet need had been there from the beginning, just a hair’s breadth away from tipping over, but he knew now that there really was no going back, and he wouldn’t last much longer.
They didn’t get to talk to Teddy for long. When they floo called in the boys were outside playing, and it was Toby’s mother Clarissa who answered. She went to fetch them, and both Teddy and Toby sat down in front of the fire and immediately launched into tales of all the things they’d done together so far. Toby was a very creative kid and loved to make up stories, which Teddy loved to act out with him and help him embellish as they went. It probably helped that Teddy’s metamorphmagus abilities were getting better every day and he could change his appearance at will to play pretend as any number of characters.
“Me too!” cried Teddy, finally letting go of Vesper’s leg. “I wash all the vegetables!”
They went by Zonko’s, but it was closed, being a Sunday and all, and only really popular when the Hogwarts students were visiting. Honeyduke’s, however, was open, and they each bought a hunk of fudge to enjoy; Harry, as usual, got treacle, while Draco favored the chocolate peanut butter flavor. They ate it with their fingers and occasionally swapped for each other’s as they kept walking, past the robe shop, and Madam Puddifoot’s, where Draco made a big show of trying to drag Harry inside while Harry laughed and protested vehemently.
“It’s not that I can’t be attracted to women. I happen to be bisexual, in point of fact. It’s just that I’m not attracted to Lindsey in particular. I hope that doesn’t… I’m not trying to offend you, or anything.”
“How you ripped him and Paul a new one for not making more of an effort to get to know me properly.”
“She must like that,” Vesper said.
Harry suppressed a smug smile, with great effort. He never thought he’d see the day that Malfoy praised Hermione.
“I didn’t put much stock in it, considering you were playing against
Why would Harry put up with that, when he could have any other fit gay bloke he wanted to go dancing or picnicking with? What did Draco have to offer, compared to that freedom, that ease, that was so important to Harry? Draco could already feel the way Harry was losing patience with him in that regard, tired of being stuck in their rooms together. Harry was growing bored of it, restless. So of course he would jump at the chance to be with other people, once his schedule allowed it.
“We’ll be careful,” Draco said, his eyes fixed on Harry’s mouth. “Just… don’t move.” He touched his lips to Harry’s again, cradling his chin gently, and Harry gave in, returning the pressure.
dreamy.”
“Me too,” Aria said.
“We’ve removed her from our approved substitutes list, as well as filed an incident report that will go alongside your complaint, and that will remain in our permanent records. She will never work here again, and if anyone contacts us for a reference, we will be forthright and honest about her indiscretion.”
She stopped at the sound of his voice, hovering at the end of the bed. Ron had put his book on his nightstand already and was staring at her with open concern.
“I’m just trying to help,” Lily insisted, with just a little too much innocence.
be more efficient. I was using it just now and it worked beautifully.”
“I have considered that,” she said with another sigh, looking through the book some more with a distracted air. “But I have yet to find a solution that satisfies me.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh, though it felt a bit hollow, given the mood he was in. “Good point,” he said.
Draco tilted his glass to and fro, still staring at the amber liquid inside. “It’s a thought… an idea, that I can’t get out of my head. The more time passes, the more firmly it roots itself.” He took a sip, finally, and Harry waited. “I know that you would support me in this, but I do have concerns about Andromeda, about how she would feel about it. That’s what’s holding me back, honestly.”
lucky. “Surely the Great Harry Potter already has a lover.”
Vesper looked down at the table again. “You’re right,” she said. She ran a hand across her forehead and through her hair, knowing the truth. Part of her wanted to hear it, all the things Blaise wanted to say. Which really wasn’t fair. Not to Blaise, or Declan, or herself.
“Terrifying. Can you imagine what she’ll be like when she can finally get her hands on a wand? I’m so thankful I’ll be out of Hogwarts by then.”
“Harry, mate, do you really think anything will come of this?” Ron asked.
“Yes, all right,” she said quietly, after a time. “I cannot deny that Neville’s blood status is convenient. It was never a deal-breaker; I would fancy him regardless. But knowing that it would be easier, that my mother especially would be more accepting…” She trailed off.
Holy shit you guys are seriously the best! So much love and thoughtfulness and strong, interesting opinions. I just can't get over it. I want more!
“For a case?”
Thanks so much for all the kudos! I'd love some comments if anyone is so inclined! It's always nice to hear what people think.
“Did everything go all right at the hospital?” he asked.
Harry sighed to himself. His and Draco’s predictions were turning out to be spot on. Ron and Hermione both were overthinking this, just in different ways.
“Fair enough,” he conceded, after some consideration.
“Yes,” McGonagall agreed. “You’ve shown what an exceptional wizard you are. Talented, powerful, and resourceful. They all want a piece of it.”
Draco sat there a moment longer, words on the tip of his tongue that he didn’t know why he felt so compelled to share. But he realized if he didn’t say it now, it was likely he would never say it at all. And that seemed wrong, somehow.
“So you tried it. And it wasn’t good?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, once he believed she was cognizant enough to understand him. “I have to go back to work. I wish I could stay, but I’m not allowed.”
“So it’s Liquid Lunch Monday!” Rico declared. “Which I think should always be a thing. We should make it a thing,” he remarked as an aside to Hannah.
“If you don’t want to do it, it’s your choice. I can always owl Draco and tell him you’ve changed your mind. He would understand. But the option is there, if you want it.”
,” she said, “that since I won’t have class maybe I could stay with you tonight.”
“Or maybe they’ll be too shy. Maybe they’ll just watch, and touch themselves. Maybe they’ll bring themselves off, making sure they come right when I shoot my load down your throat. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
larger than the Nott estate. Not that I’m one to boast.” He gave Kyle a wink, then took his hand and started leading him down the hall.
“I think your argument has a great deal of merit. And you’re not alone in your thinking. Moreau has been skeptical from the beginning, and her reasons are only getting stronger.”
“And I didn’t even know these existed!”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed to change his desires each year. Sometimes he wanted a large gathering with everyone he knew, while other times he wanted it small and intimate, out at a nice restaurant or some picturesque outdoor venue. He usually managed to decide with enough time for Draco to plan accordingly. In truth, Draco hoped his husband would choose something similar to last year, when they’d had a party at the Burrow in the afternoon and then left their one-year-old with Ron and Hermione for the night. It was their son’s first ever sleepover and, more importantly, a much deserved private sleepover for Harry and Draco. They’d barely left the bed that evening, talking, cuddling, and making love for hours, only pausing to eat some takeaway in front of the television at Grimmauld Place. Some people might scoff at the simplicity and ordinariness of such a celebration, but those people weren’t parents and clearly didn’t understand how precious some alone time with one’s spouse could be. For Draco, it was one of the happiest nights in his recent memory.
Harry hesitated, chewing on his lip. He probably should have expected the question. It was just strange, because pretty much all of the wizarding world knew about his dating habits, and it had been a long time since he’d had to explain it to anyone. He wasn’t sure how honest he should be.
“Mm,” said Draco, thinking that over. He
Harry thought at Draco. He wished he could say it aloud, but that would only confirm that Draco was implying. Apparently, though, his face was conveying plenty, because Draco was grinning at him wickedly, with an undercurrent of excitement.
They were silent for a bit, Pansy seeming to consider what he had just told her and Draco wondering at what point Pansy was going to lose all patience with him and end the floo connection.
She shook her head, swallowed, and set her sandwich down, staring at her plate a moment. “I also talked to Draco for a bit, towards the end of the night,” she said, her voice a bit too casual.
Teddy already had a designated bedroom at Grimmauld, of course, for when he had stayed with Harry and Draco in the past. It was stocked with a few toys and games (although usually Teddy brought what he wanted from home), but hardly had any personal touches that really made it Teddy’s own. They intended to change that, telling Teddy that he could decorate and arrange the room however he wanted. That had been Harry’s idea, and Draco thought it was an excellent one.
“I always figured you’d see the value in chess,” Draco commented, “given that you had to fight and win a war. And I imagine dueling and other aspects of being an Auror also involve strategizing. You know, moves and countermoves.”
“That’s true.”
“Well, I’m quite grateful,” Andromeda said.
But there were also small touches, whether to get each other’s attention, provide reassurance, or to give acknowledgement, which had not been there before. There were smiles exchanged, teasing quips volleyed, and pregnant silences in which Kyle became convinced, in the moment anyway, that something big was going to happen.
Harry pointed to the door. “Is he in?”
“I can’t,” Draco said, disappointed. “I’ve an appointment with a patient. An important one.”
All in all, things were looking up.
He returned it, her enthusiasm allowing a small, real smile to grace his lips. “I’m here,” he agreed.
Draco kissed an eyelid tenderly, knowing what a big step that was for Harry. Bigger than giving his love, his body, his heart. Draco had fought hard to earn that trust and he wasn’t about to waste it.
Dudley was looking at his mother sideways, his mouth twisted. “What did you think, Mum? That Harry’s going to do something to him? Now? After all this time?”
“Resigned?” Malfoy looked appalled. “Why would you resign?”
“That is quite weird,” Harry agreed. “What did you do? I mean, you’ve been on this whole ignoring her kick for a while…”
” she replied, in a way that Scorpius knew meant “yes.”
The 8
“Fuck, yes, Draco,” he said, gripping the blond by the hips for purchase. “I’ve been dreaming about this all week. Pounding your arse and making you scream.”
“I’m complaining about wrinkles, of course. I swear, some days you pull a shirt out of the dresser and put it on and it looks like you just slept in it. If you’d just let me-”
“All right, then.”
When their lips finally parted they simply stood there a moment, smiling softly at each other.
“Good.”
Aurelian gave a small grunt at that. He knew what she meant. She meant use it to do good. Aurelian was not
Harry grinned. “Unlike me, who makes snap decisions all the time. I realized in about three seconds that I had to break up with Ginny. I can pinpoint the exact moment.”
“We can add the oil to our rehydration treatment,” Draco said. “This says that the skin will reabsorb oil that’s been extracted if the skin is moist enough. It means we can use the skin we already have.”
Harry rolled his eyes, accustomed to Hermione fishing for grade comparisons. He was also not surprised when Draco revealed his and Harry’s score with small, but still rather smug, smile.
Iwu had raised her eyebrows and looked down at the pixie-like Junior Healer. “Correct, McClellan, although I like to
Hannah burst into laughter. “Now that I’d like to see. Of course, it would be just your luck for there to be a photographer in here to catch you in the act. Can you imagine the headlines? ‘Harry Potter’s lover, a closet exhibitionist!’ People would be beside themselves.”
“Thanks for lunch,” he said. “I’m really glad I got to see you again.”
Harry thought.
were a delicious sauce that needed tasting.
He laughed. “I know.”
“There weren’t many with curses,” Harry said. “It was mostly Howlers, and some normal letters as well. We thought we had it under control.”
Harry hovered over him again, lining their bodies up automatically, his mouth descending on Draco’s.
“No, that’s all right,” said Harry. “Let’s just clean together. It will be faster that way.”
It struck Draco as radical, that idea. It was…. revolutionary. It wasn’t how he had been encouraged to think of sex at all, in the past, but he liked it. He liked it a lot.
“A few things, I think,” said Harry. “I didn’t see what. I don’t even care, really. It’s just that some of that stuff is dangerous. Just this summer Kreacher took an old baby blanket into his little hole and it tried strangled him in his sleep. Thank Merlin I was home at the time, or Kreacher likely would have died. He doesn’t seem to care, though. Even ratty old blankets are precious to him.”
better, and yet I still…” She trailed off, avoiding meeting Ron’s eyes as tears started to flow again. “I hurt you. I never want to hurt you, but I do. I’ve hurt you before, too, just because of my stupid… because I… I overthink everything and-“
“First off,” he said, still clasping Draco’s hand tightly in his own, “I love you.”
"The best kind," she answered, sliding into bed and sighing softly. Yes, it was perfect.
Draco scooped him up. “All right there, Teddy?” he said, giving him a kiss.
“Hello,” said Blaise. Harry stared at him, waiting. He doubted Blaise had dropped by for a social visit. Their friendship was still a tenuous one. “Draco told me you spoke with Vesper.”
“But the metal is also hot, probably. Very hot. My friend also thinks the wounds look cauterized, since they sealed so cleanly.”
“Well, I should be off,” said Harry, pulling the sunglasses off his head and putting them on. Which, despite the fact that it shielded his gorgeous eyes, only served to make him look even hotter. “It was nice to meet you,” he said, nodding at Kyle. He turned to Draco. “See you at school. Have a good summer.”
“Yes, and did a bit more than that, besides.”
first,” said Harry, coming up behind him and pressing “cancel” quickly as the microwave whirred to life. “I’ll show you later.”
Toby Goldstein was one of Teddy’s good friends at school.
“Yes, sir, he just went to change. He said he would come back when he’s ready.”
“Yes,” said Teddy, after thinking that over.
“Yeah, actually. I think I do.”
“Have you eaten anything?”
“Well, not being able to Apparate makes a big difference, I imagine.”
She batted her eyelashes at him, smiling with a sweetness that likely portended his doom. “It bodes very well, actually, so long as you accept the inevitable. I’ve made an acquaintance recently, you see, who I think you would quite enjoy knowing as well, and I’ve invited him to a dinner party next week. I’d like for you to attend.”
Harry thought back to what he remembered last. It did start to become a bit of a blur. He and Draco danced for quite some time, then went back to the bar for more drinks. They chatted up another gay couple for a while, and they started buying each other rounds and… Harry didn’t remember much after that. He was pretty sure there was more dancing. And he remembered Draco snogging him quite enthusiastically, and thinking that Draco was pretty drunk as well.
something. I’m not apologizing. I’m saying I’m sorry. I… feel sorrow. I’m sorry that this is happening. And you’ve had to carry it around for most of the week, unable to tell me, or really anyone, and that must have been hard.”
“You are a Malfoy, first and foremost,” he said then, when Scorpius hadn’t replied. “Remember that.”
“You too,” Kyle replied.
“Do you miss him?”
“Right. Sorry.”
Harry carried the stack out of McGonagall’s office, thanking her as always for the tea. He shrunk them so they would fit in his jeans pocket and made his way back to the 8
Draco sighed internally. He was afraid of this, but he realized it was inevitable. Kyle would want an explanation. He
The brunet met his eyes and Draco looked closely, trying to discern exactly what he could see there: sadness, regret, fear, or perhaps a combination of all three. They stared at each other, at least until Potter finally found his voice.
He imagined putting his mouth to her, right below her bellybutton. Her stomach muscles would be strong under his lips. He would lick, tasting the salt of her skin, teasing at the edge of her most erogenous zone and making her gasp. But he wouldn’t go lower, not yet. She was going to have to beg for that. Instead he would trail upward, dipping his tongue into her navel before traveling higher, up past her ribs to the naked globes of her tits. He’d run his hands along the undersides, where the skin was softest, and then he’d slide his knuckles across a nipple, making her buck under him. He’d do it again, grinning, then pinch until she cried out.
Draco searched his memory. “Never heard of him.”
“May.”
“There’s a café down this way,” he said to Harry. “It’s simple fare, but it’s good.”
The staff nodded along to that, everyone in agreement. Draco snuck a glance at Harry to find that he was listening to the headmistress with a relaxed smile on his face, his eyes crinkling and flickering with happiness. Of course, Harry would be glad his friend was coming to teach at Hogwarts.
“We’re winging this a bit,” he admitted once they were finally in line to check out. “I hope that’s all right.”
“Sorry, I assumed you knew,” he said, to gauge Malfoy’s reaction.
“Well, no, not anymore, not that you’ve already found someone.”
“I suppose I should shower as well,” Draco said with a sigh, though he made no move to get up.
Hermione ran a hand over the front cover, enjoying even the tactile quality of the smooth leather binding and the thick weight of it in her palm. When she looked up, she met Ron’s eyes, which were crinkled in happiness. She leaned forward, giving him a kiss.
“Hi,” replied Draco. “You look handsome.”
Lorenz shook her head. “Not that I know of. There aren’t any boys older than thirteen at the orphanage currently. She may have a boyfriend outside of the orphanage, however. We do occasionally let her go to visit Hogsmeade when the students are there, so she can socialize. It’s so hard on her, not being allowed to go to Hogwarts herself. It’s good for her to have friends. But as far as a young man… well, I don’t know of one. And we keep quite a close eye on her, you know. We have to.”
They had been breathing heavily into each other’s necks, but Harry realized he wanted Draco’s mouth again, and so he lifted his head and took it, nipping at the full bottom lip before delving his tongue inside. Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, never missing a beat as they ground together.
He thought of everything that was about to happen mere hours from now, about the garden that was now in full bloom, his friends in perfectly tailored suits, dress robes, or gowns milling about waiting for the ceremony to start, the gazebo his mother had had constructed where he would finally take Harry’s hands and say the vows he knew he was always meant to say. Vows he had been thinking about long before he and Harry ever got engaged, if he were being honest with himself.
“It’s really that common of an occurrence?” Draco asked.
“How much energy I have.”
And he needed something else, too. He needed to live in Grimmauld. He needed a place to call his own.
“I’ll bring him back around half five, if that suits you,” Andromeda said to Harry.
Kyle was quiet for a long time, staring at the floor. Finally, he spoke, running a hand through his hair.
After that, Noor went back to reading, and Scorpius and Hugo chatted some more, looking out at the lake and occasionally catching glances of the giant squid.
She had shaken her head and then closed her eyes, reeling as if the action made her dizzy. “I’ve no appetite at all. And if I do get hungry, there is plenty of food here for me to warm.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to,” Harry said quickly.
In a flurry of movement Draco’s jacket was off and his top was pulled over his head, the jumper and shirt together, leaving his chest bare. Draco returned the favor, and soon there was flesh on flesh as they pressed together, consuming each other’s mouths like men dying of thirst. But it didn’t quench the need, only drove it higher.
smelling like a hospital by 4:00.”
Draco exhaled a shaky breath, nervous and excited all at once. Harry had ordered something special for him, as he had promised. And now it was time to use it. Was he ready?
“I think there’s someone at your door,” the wizard said. “I heard the bell.”
“I should hope so,” said Draco with a smirk, which made Harry roll his eyes. “And I’ve heard a bit about you as well,” Draco went on smoothly, back in charming aristocrat mode now that he no longer looked ridiculous. “You’re a national dueling champion, so I hear.”
Draco frowned. That was a shame. He knew how much Harry liked being hands-on with the programs. “Well, I’ll be home some days during the week. We can work it out that I'll up Teddy those days, so you can check in on the program then.”
“No,” said Draco. “It’s simply not so.”
year who can even manage transfigurations as advanced as OWL level, let alone NEWT. Their intuition is severely lacking.”
“Did you like Blaise or didn’t you?” she said bluntly now. “I could never tell.”
She felt it, that familiar humming energy, that gravitational pull. He did too, she knew, because a hand lifted, very slowly, and touched her, lightly, almost imperceptibly, on the sensitive skin of her inner forearm.
“Thank you,” she said, sighing. “That’s all I wanted, really. Well, nearly. If you two did end up getting together, I certainly wouldn’t be opposed.”
had helped improve, back in Hogwarts, with Harry. So, she had read his paper in
“Giggling like schoolboys,” Pansy said under her breath. “Anyway, you can never rely on the grooms to do their share of the work. That’s what I’ve learned. It was all me, my mum, Theo’s mum, and Daphne, who was my maid of honor. The men had absolutely nothing to do with it.”
“What the…” Ron said, staring down at the badge between his fingers. “What are you on about?”
year common room. There was a scathing and unrelenting monologue cycling through his head that he couldn’t get rid of, and it kept his blood pounding away in his ears. He flexed his hands and rolled his shoulders, trying to ease some of the tension, but there was nothing for it. He was worked up, good and proper.
He found Potter in his classroom, marking essays. The door was open, and Potter was focused enough that it wasn’t until Draco closed the classroom door and locked it with a flick of his wand that the man even looked up from his desk.
Draco pouted. “Don’t cut it much. I like it this way, honestly. You look like a rock musician. Albeit a very clean one, but that’s even better.”
And it was just a drop of blood. And it would be Draco’s.
Harry rested his head in the crook of Draco’s neck. “He shouldn’t have to. He should just get to be a kid. He shouldn’t have to deal with any of this stuff.”
“Over here,” Draco said, leading them down the now empty corridor and into an unused classroom. Harry couldn’t help but blush a little at their circumstances, remembering all that had transpired the last time they had been alone in a classroom together.
One more stroke and Draco was coming, and kept coming, letting out a surprised cry followed by an erotic moaning of Harry’s name. Harry rode it out, thrusting just fast enough to bring him over the edge. He was shocked by the power of his own orgasm as it overtook him.
The boy’s bathroom was empty, and Harry took a moment to appreciate that as he made his way to the farthest shower stall. It was his favorite, not only because it was farthest from the door but also because it was where it had all began, that night he caught Draco in the throes of self-pleasure. Whenever he stepped into it he remembered that night, what he had seen, what he had felt.
“Not that he needed to,” said Paul, laughing. “The way you looked at each other, even from across the room… It was a bit hard to miss, wasn’t it?”
, Harry realized, as he felt the way Draco was trembling beneath him, almost as if he were frightened. Whatever it was that Draco couldn’t yet share, it scared him. And that made Harry scared too.
“Yeah, I am actually,” said Draco.
That seemed to bring Draco up short. “I… I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it.” Harry didn’t say anything. “You’ve been thinking about it, though, obviously.”
He rolled onto his back, blinking away sleep and unwilling to get up quite yet. He rubbed his eyes, stretched a bit, yawned, wiggled into the mattress, flexed his toes, cracked his neck, and wondered what else he could think of doing to keep from actually getting out of bed. He had never learned to enjoy waking up, despite his chosen profession and the need to be up and about at a moment’s notice.
Harry did rather fancy a pint, actually. It seemed like the perfect way to top off a week that had been imperfect to say the least. But he didn’t want to leave Draco behind. “I’m in, if Draco can come too.”
She shrugged. “It’s what they want. They’re going abroad. I suppose they just want to get out of the country for a while.”
“I don’t know,” he said. “I think it’s more complicated than that. And I think anyone who really didn’t want to be here wouldn’t have returned in the first place.” He could feel himself getting hard again, and let out a soft groan. “Ginny.”
“And it was better that way, to not have regrets?”
“Uh-oh,” said Draco, sounding amused. “I know that look. Heads will roll.”
“It’s new,” Draco said, equivocating.
“Let’s see who comes to you first, hm?” Potter suggested. “After that we can go on the prowl.”
easily could, knowing him,” Draco added, as if unwilling to be too kind towards Ron.
But Draco still shook himself, knowing that if he didn’t get undeniable confirmation that they would both regret it. “Are you sure, Harry? This isn’t some… this is something you already decided you wanted, and not just because of… everything that happened today, right?”
“Kyle,” she corrected.
“I guess that means Robards will still be in the office.”
“Are you sure?”
“Even purebloods?”
“Here’s a master duelist, Harry,” said Hermione. “He sounds quite good. Wins all sorts of tournaments.”
“You’re telling me.”
“Interesting design,” Harry said, still staring at it. “What does it mean?”
She heard Ron let out a slow breath. “About what?”
“Yes.”
Harry huffed a laugh, then thrust in again. “Oh, I mean it.”
“You’re sure you won’t join us at the Burrow tonight, Harry?” Hermione asked as she, Harry, Ron, and Draco made their way off of Hogwarts grounds to Hogsmeade, where they could Apparate to their respective homes.
“You caught it quickly,” she said, lifting Draco’s hand delicately and submerging it in the potion. Draco’s eyelids fluttered and he let out a sigh of relief. “Luckily, this curse works slowly. But had it been allowed to spread, it would have worked its way towards the heart, which would have been fatal.”
After they left Hogwarts Draco had finally relented and let Harry teach him the Patronus Charm. He had been reluctant because it was understood that Death Eaters were incapable of performing it. Harry knew this wasn’t necessarily true, of course, considering Snape had been able to perform the charm, and that, in the end, was what had convinced Draco to give it a try.
He finished his tea and decided it was finally time to head back to the castle. He had needed some time alone, but he knew he would eventually have to face the music with Ron and Hermione. They would want to hear from him what had happened with Ginny. He might as well get it over with.
Vesper gave him a look. “Between the two of you, who knows what would have happened?”
“The most logical conclusion we can come to is that the murderer wanted the magical cores intact and functioning, to use for their own purposes.”
Happy Sunday! <33
. I mean…” He turned to Draco. “It would have been nice to know… I
Of course, she already knew the answer. This was not the first time in the past four months that Blaise had shown up on her doorstep. Granted, it was the first time he had shown up this late at night, and the first time he had ever waited on her front stoop for her to come home. But still, they had been here before. She knew what came next.
She smiled and kissed him. “I’ll eat a little supper, I promise.”
“Yes, well, as far as what Malfoy heirs are
“Oh, Draco,” Francesca said. “No, you’re not. You’re more miserable now than you were when you first arrived here in September.”
No, what was really worrying was what the article had to say about Sirius’ relationship with Harry, how they had been reunited after Harry’s third year, how he had tragically only had a couple of years with his pseudo-father figure before the man’s untimely death at the hand of Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry felt his hackles rise. He didn’t have to look at the author’s byline to know who had written the article.
Vesper nodded. “Yeah, I get that.”
Petunia sniffed, turning back to her husband. She patted the man’s spotted, fragile hand and said, “Very well. I’ll leave you to it, then,” as if she were speaking to Dursley, and not to Harry.
let him have whatever he wants. He’s done so much for the Corps already, so they owe him. But that stuff’s more based on politics than merit, and… I don’t know. It’s a lot of paperwork, and Ron never much liked paperwork.”
“There are plenty of Black descendants who are wonderful, loving people,” Harry said, thinking of Andromeda.
Draco pulled back enough to meet his eyes. Harry was looking at him calmly, peacefully, a hand running lightly through his blond hair.
Harry snorted. “I don’t know about that. I think it depends on the personality of the child, rather than the gender. Scorpius is plenty sweet, as far as I’m concerned.”
“Let’s hope so.”
WELL. It has been a LONG time since I've posted anything to this collection. Honestly, this story has been sitting around mostly finished for longer than I care to admit, and I decided to finally give myself a kick in the ass and finish it. It did turn out to be quite the monster (if you've been reading me for a while, you will know that brevity is not my strong suit hehe), and it's far from perfect, but I had a lot of fun with it, so I'm not that sorry about it :)
Smiling, Harry kissed him on the head, then put the book back on the bedside table. He knew he should get up now and clean up from dinner, at least. But he didn’t move, convincing himself that Teddy might wake up again and wonder where he’d gone. So he settled in, sliding down so his head rested on one of Teddy’s pillows, and closed his eyes.
“You all right?” Draco asked him. “Getting cold feet?”
Harry nodded and turned back to Jaime. “He’s right. Even your non-wand hand will help you here.”
Harry smiled a real smile now and closed his eyes again, his focus slipping away from Kingsley’s letter and the angry public and settling instead on the sure brushes of Draco’s fingers on his skin.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Esme?” said Theo, taking the girl from his wife’s arms. “I’ll take her over, then I’ll track down your man, eh?”
in this house is living up to the name of Malfoy.” He saw his father’s mouth twist in a sneer out of the corner of his eye, and smirked openly.
She’d had this nightmare before. She knew it well.
He watched Hannah take that in, feeling genuinely sad for her. He wasn’t Longbottom’s number one fan, but he wanted Hannah to be happy.
“Because it would be unethical, for one thing. And for another, I don’t know myself. Such information is supposed to be kept confidential by law enforcement. I was only told what I needed to know in order to understand your parents’ case.”
“I don’t think I was looking for a replacement for Sirius,” he said finally. “But I think I was looking for another Dumbledore or Remus, maybe. And considering how extraordinary those two men were and how well they knew me and my history, I suppose those expectations were unfair to put on someone new. But that doesn’t change the fact that Kemp… Kemp isn’t just a disappointment he’s… the opposite of what I’m looking for.”
“You couldn’t just do it in the morning, after the fact?”
A laugh bubbled out of Harry’s throat before he could stop it. And it was followed by another, and another, and another. Because it was just too absurd. It was just too perfectly, twistedly, frustratingly ironic.
Vesper knew that Mac was likely trying to give her a vote of confidence rather than put her on the spot, but this was hardly the moment she wanted it. She was aware of all eyes on her, including Declan’s and Dempsey’s, which she felt most palpably.
, me too.” He met Harry’s eyes, dark and beautiful, and he saw Harry’s orgasm in that gaze before he even felt it in his hand, and it was enough to take him over the edge.
The woman watched indifferently as Hermione made her way over and took a chair next to her. Hermione had to suppress the stab of disappointment she felt. Some part of her, the least rational part, of course, had been hoping that her presence would somehow spark a moment of recognition in her mother, that she could somehow heal her, simply by being there. But it was clear, by her mother’s vacant stare, that that had been a pipe dream.
“You didn’t,” Harry said, surprising him. “I haven’t handled… well…” He didn’t seem to know where he was going with that, because he didn’t finish the thought. “It will be all right,” he said instead. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Some things are worth a little risk, right?” he murmured when he pulled away, harkening back to the start of their evening.
“And I am trying to demonstrate that your gratitude is ill-placed,” the Malfoy patriarch replied, returning his gaze to the fire.
“That’s what they tell me,” said Draco. “I can grab one of the residents on the case and they can tell you more, but it sounds like he’ll fully recover.”
“It’s been a while,” he said to her as he made to untie the letter from her leg. It was not a Howler, much to his relief, not that he actually expected his mother to send one. She had never been one for shouting. Cold, quiet dismissiveness was more her style, when she wanted to be disapproving.
Draco chuckled again. “Yes, you would. But you don’t have to
Marissa sighed. “Good point. I bet I could find someplace.”
“To Vernon?”
Draco smiled. “Yes, that.”
“I would never do that,” Draco assured her.
“No need to explain. You know, I can stay with George instead if you want Hermione to stay with you.”
“So, you’re off for now,” Ron was saying, getting Vesper’s attention again. “Just be ready at 1.”
Harry huffed and bounced Teddy a little. “I’m not a political animal, Kingsley. I think I would only make it worse.”
“Wait,” Troyer exclaimed, sounding desperate. “You have it all wrong. It was me. I did it. I made those artifacts and tried to sell them. There isn’t anyone else.”
She thought about that. “Not sure. I like the idea of something with a lot of field work. I don’t want to be cooped up in the office all the time.”
“What does she say?”
“It works for me now,” he said, as if answering a question Draco has asked. “I think I’ve earned the right to have a little fun, and do what I like to do. I know wizarding Britain, including many of my friends, would be happier if I settled down, got married, started a family. But it’s not their life; it’s mine. And I’m not ready for that yet. I like keeping my options open. I like focusing on my teaching and spending time with the people who know me best. I haven’t met a partner I trust that much yet, to really make them a part of my life. But I also like sex. So…”
“I keep thinking about that third man,” said Declan. “How did he know it would be best to come through the back of the house? How did he know Eloise would be right there, within snatching distance?”
Kyle huffed. “You can’t say anything. Nothing that will make me feel better, anyway. You’re just going to have to live with that.”
Harry opened his mouth, as if to begin protesting, but lost his motivation quickly. He sighed. “Perhaps you’re right.” He looked at Draco from under his eyelashes. “Are you angry with me?”
, but he didn’t back away. Potter’s thumb ran lightly along his jaw, and his breath hitched.
It was too much to hold. His chest felt full and tight all at once; his eyes were stinging, tears already threatening to spill over. He was suddenly very, very thankful for the privacy charms Draco had cast.
He swiftly removed his trousers and pants and, holding his wand in his hand, conjured some lube. It dripped onto the floor a little, but he didn’t care. He had his cock in his hand now, and it was pure pleasure.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s called a refrigerator. Fridge for short.”
Draco didn’t say anything, perhaps trying on Dumbledore’s technique and letting him come to his own conclusions.
“What would be the point?” Harry asked, and his eyes were suddenly so… so
” Potter gasped, and that sound emboldened him, and he suddenly felt he had to be closer.
“Yeah. Ron and Hermione,” said Harry, nodding. “I talk to them a lot. But you know it’s nothing personal against you guys. It’s just that, like you said, they’ve known me since childhood. They knew my history without me ever having to tell them. They’ve always known. And that makes it… easier, I guess.”
He tilted forward so that his forehead rested against hers. “I know you will,” he said softly. “And thank you.”
to, or the fear of what could happen would be too paralyzing, would keep her from moving forward. And she couldn’t let that happen. She had to be like Mac, and the other Senior Aurors. She had to emulate their detachment, their courage, their self-possession, until it was something she felt within herself, for real.
years present looked up at his noisy entrance, but he didn’t pay them any mind as his eyes scanned the room for that familiar platinum blond head. He huffed in exasperation. Draco wasn’t there, though his three housemates were.
He opened the door quickly, ready to either welcome someone in or tell them off. But what he found there was so unexpected that he did neither, but rather just stood there and stared.
Draco was stymied, realizing he had no idea what sort of alcohol Muggles drank. He couldn’t very well order a double of Ogden’s and have them know what he was talking about. He was about to pick something randomly from the massive selection lining the wall when Potter spoke again.
Harry looked at the box, surprised. “In person?”
he accused himself, before deciding that no, he actually wasn’t. He was putting thought into how he wanted this night to go, and Clint deserved that. He just wanted it to be an enjoyable experience for both of them, and he wanted it to bring them closer.
awful, but what I was thinking was that new information is always valuable, and if one has to make a decision, they need all the information they can get their hands on.”
was almost too much to hear, too much to bear.
“Thanks. I’m glad you’re here.”
“I hit this wall just about every time,” she said, almost wistfully. “This question comes up for me a lot, because of the kind of work that the Foundation does, generally speaking. We’re meant to help Muggleborns find their way in wizarding culture. But what that really
Draco took his hand. “You’re going to be fine,” he said in Harry’s ear. “Just another thirty minutes and this will all be over.”
“Because it’s not any of your business. It happened before you and I started dating.”
Draco absorbed that silently. “You’re right. I will try to be better.”
Clint huffed a laugh. “True.”
“I have feelings for him. Strong ones. And we’re together now, as of yesterday.”
She inhaled shakily, pulling the long sleeves of her pajama shirt over her fingers and bringing a thumbnail to her mouth. “Merlin,” she said. “This
So, with Kyle’s clear dismissal and nothing more to say, Draco turned on the spot, removing himself from Kyle’s life with a small
The dragon roared.
Kyle laughed. “Thanks.” He hardly had anything hung on the walls, just a few prints that he’d picked up over the years. “Feel free to make yourself comfortable.” He indicated the sofa over in the living room. “Do you know what you’d like to drink? I have beer, wine, firewhiskey… or just tea or butterbeer if you don’t want anything strong.”
When he flooed into the home of the master duelist the next afternoon, he was surprised to find himself tumbling into what appeared to be a very posh waiting room. There were a number of armchairs in dark leather arranged around coffee tables of magazines and newspapers, a fountain gurgling unobtrusively in the corner, and three walls lined with shiny awards and accolades. He wondered, at first, if they all belonged to the master duelist, but saw different names on each one as he took a closer look.
“Marriage doesn’t mean having to have children right away, you know.”
Hermione breathed a sigh of relief, before she was overtaken by a frisson of what she thought might be self-loathing. She knew who she was really trying to protect by asking: herself. She swallowed it down, though, knowing she had no choice.
Harry found he was grinning widely. “It is rather fitting, isn’t it?”
He looked at Harry sheepishly. “Yeah.”
But, he realized, the thought didn’t scare him, or even make him nervous. He just wanted it, badly.
“I said some very stupid things to Draco, Winky,” Harry said. “Things I didn’t mean.”
“How about ring bearer?” Draco suggested to him.
Draco looked down at his hands, somewhere between pleased and embarrassed. “I’d certainly like to think I’ve come a long way since we were in school,” he said finally. “I’m not perfect by any stretch, but I have grown up, as have we all.”
“You’re damn right,” she replied.
” said Harry. He knew that this was only one session he was leading, and Jaime was Kemp’s student, in actuality, but why on earth couldn’t he learn how to use the jinx? “In fact,
Draco turned back to look at Harry, his expression hard to read. Harry shrugged at him.
“Very closely moderated temperature control. Hathaway has been obsessive about it, bless him.”
He received a shove from his sister’s shoulder in response, but they both knew it was all in jest.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I didn’t realize that. Where were you living before, if you don’t mind me asking?”
“Really, Malfoy,” he said. “After everything? I thought you weren’t going to take low shots like that anymore. I guess I was wrong.”
“Actually, I was wondering if you fancied a walk,” Hermione replied, eyeing Harry carefully.
“Tell me a bit about how your perceptions of purebloods have changed since you became involved with Draco Malfoy.”
“That’s it,” he whispered into the air, the pleasure in his cock building as he stroked and stroked it.
Hermione’s heart swelled in appreciation for her friend, but she gave him a wry smile. “Well, five minutes of lunch with me and I really bring down the mood, don’t I?” she half joked.
She introduced him to Fischer, Green, and Abernathy, all of whom had heard of Aurelian Kemp and his dueling prowess, and were suitably pleased to meet him. She introduced him to Declan as well, of course, who shook his hand in a very boyfriend-meeting-a-parent sort of way that Vesper wondered if Aurelian picked up on. They chatted away for most of the reception, Declan asking Aurelian about his dueling and his time living in the States, and also telling him about his work as a cursebreaker when Aurelian had asked.
Kyle laughed genuinely now. “Thanks. I mean, yeah. Obviously. That’s true. About that you can be both, I mean. I’m just an idiot. And awkward as hell. In case that wasn’t obvious.”
Draco laughed. “You’re right. I was thinking we should take Francesca up on her offer of a Tuscan holiday next year, if we can. Experience the real thing.”
“Two nights off actually… and yes, it was quite pleasurable.” He still had the mild but satisfying ache in his arse to prove it.
“Frankly, sir, yes.”
Draco looked at him. “My father is a bastard. So, given that, it was fine.”
“Go and put your school clothes on,” he told the boy. “And we’ll all have breakfast together.”
Draco paused in the buttering of his toast to give Harry a wry smirk. “Why do you think? Who is most likely to have such artifacts in their possession?”
George had showed him the prototype of this particular product. It was a small pin that could be planted on someone’s clothing and, when triggered, transformed their wardrobe into outlandish regalia from the Hogwarts house of your choice that was nearly impossible to remove. They were trying to finish them in time to sell them at the Quidditch finals, and by the looks of it, they’d succeeded.
was the one who had been in the wrong. How strange.
Harry bound his wrists and then pinned him to the ground with another spell, and that was that.
, he said to the voice. That wasn’t true. He knew that already. He knew it. Plenty of men did, and it didn’t stop them from being men. Harry did it, and he was a man, through and through. A sexy, strong, confident, self-possessed man. So why couldn’t Draco be
hungry, but he was content to have his son near, the small weight of him in his lap a comfort more than any food could be. Nothing felt more right than this. He bent his head, burying his nose in Scorpius’ hair a moment before giving him another kiss on the head. When he looked up, Harry was giving him a soft and knowing look.
“I’m Sam.”
Harry shrugged. “Maybe, but I never try.”
“I’m amazed at how distracted at work I am,” said Ron. “I have a hard time focusing and thinking about things other than her when I’m there. I used to be able to compartmentalize, you know? Work was work, and while I was there it had all my focus. And then when I was at home I was just focused on Hermione and the house. But when Rose was born it was like… my entire frame of reference shifted or something. Every case that has come across my desk in the past three months has made me think of her in one way or another. My priorities feel different.”
He perched next to her on the sofa as she lay across it, dabbing at her forehead and cheeks with the cloth.
Kyle shrugged. “I guess. It’s a little… I don’t know… stuffy in there.”
“First?” Draco echoed, his voice husky. “First you’re going to come in my mouth. That’s what.” His hand cupped the erection that was still confined in Harry’s underwear, and he smirked at Harry’s deep groan, looking into his eyes. “After that, who knows?”
Her eyes flitted to Declan again. He had been completely ignoring her since the breakup, which was understandable and better than the alternative. He could, if he wanted to, make things very difficult for her at work. But he wasn’t that kind of guy. He was taking the high road.
“Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter!” they all cried.
“I’ll show you
“Hm,” said Harry. “That’s in interesting way to put it.” He didn’t seem upset, merely thoughtful, but Draco felt a need to explain more anyway.
“Time to get up!”
, now that he thought about it. He’d always chocked it up to that the Malfoy estate was much larger and more lavish than the Greengrass one. This didn’t make the match uneven by any stretch. The Malfoys had amassed quite a fortune, true, but the Greengrasses were in a much greater abundance of political clout. They had been neutral during the war and had therefore avoided the stain on their name that an association with the Dark Lord would bring.
“He just cares about you, that’s all.”
“And those people would be wrong,” Draco quipped, making his accent as posh as possible. “Of course, I’ve always thought that above size, it’s always mattered more how well-decorated it is.”
“Of course I am! Tell me all about it. Meet any cute blokes? Have a holiday fling, maybe?”
“Oh, yes, Draco,” Harry replied, his cock starting to pulse. “Come inside me. Empty yourself into me. Give me everything!”
The supremely challenging Potions project was the source of particular ire for most students, but not Harry and Draco. Thanks to their revelations of the previous week, they had a couple of major breakthroughs with their potion and were well on their way to finishing early. Draco had taken to looking perpetually pleased whenever they were working on the project, giving Harry smiles that made the Gryffindor's insides ache pleasantly. Still, Draco was careful not to touch Harry again, stalling any forward motion Harry thought they might be making in their relationship.
you. You have to decide to. You have to decide that I’m capable of taking care of myself instead of always trying to swoop in and make it all better. Believe it or not, that doesn’t actually help me.”
Was it possible to have real romantic feelings for two people at the same time? And if it was, why did his feelings for Aria and his feelings for Emilia still feel so… different?
“Hello, Harry, dear,” Andromeda said, offering her cheek for a kiss.
“I doubt there’s any paperwork on her at all except for the initial contract,” said Harry. “She’s a model participant in the program. We’ve never had a problem with her and she’s never had a problem with any other child.”
, Draco insisted to himself.
The Slytherin raised one pale eyebrow and looked at Harry with caution in his eyes. “You would deign to partner with a Slytherin, Potter?” His voice was the usual caustic drawl, specially designed to antagonize.
“Like what?”
What if she went back to the place in question, the site of the accident? What if there were Muggles there whose memories, while modified, could still be useful to her? If they
, let’s talk about anything but him,” she said, placing the tray on the table. It contained the cider and what looked like five firewhiskeys. “Here’s yours, darling,” Angelina said as she placed Kyle’s pint in front of him. “And I got whiskey for everyone. We’re celebrating tonight.”
She wasn’t crying now. She was just staring.
Draco wiped his eyes and wondered at the amount of ambivalence his mother had managed to pack into a few paragraphs. She was pleased to hear accounts of him and what he was up to, and yet worried that they were not the best thing for him. She claimed to not doubt his judgment, yet questioned his choice of partner. She spoke eloquently of her love, of how much she wanted to see him, yet was still making the choice to keep her distance for now, no doubt due to her husband’s wishes.
Kyle turned back to him. “And yet you’re choosing someone else anyway.”
“A wise decision,” he agreed. He looked down and noticed what she was standing right next to. “Trying to break into my cabinet, are we? Trying to drown yourself in badly done paperwork?” he asked, amused.
as the magic released.”
“Still, you’d prefer I didn’t go into the field at all.”
“I got angry. Said some things. But they were justified.”
“No one knew about it. Besides, I didn’t want that money,” Harry said softly. “It was better that they take it.”
learning, not unlike
“It would never have worked,” Ginny agreed. “Especially since I’m pretty sure Harry and Draco want to have another baby soon.”
“Two daughters. Seven and ten. The older one will be going off to Hogwarts next year. A bit hard to imagine, I’ll be honest.”
“I don’t carry around a lot of anger,” Draco said. “It’s more indifference than anything.”
“I know you don’t want to bother me with it,” Draco said quietly after a few minutes. “And I understand. I just want you to know that you
“Knock, knock,” Harry said, pushing on the partially open office door and revealing Hermione behind her desk, her head of sleek, almond brown curls obscuring her face as she bent over a length of parchment. She looked up when she heard him though, seeming momentarily surprised before giving him a small smile. “I brought lunch,” he said, which should have been a given. It was Friday, and they always had takeaway lunch together on Fridays.
“Not pathetic,” he said mildly. “Just… invested. I happen to think it’s a good thing.”
“Thanks for the tip,” she replied coolly. “Since that’s my main goal in life, to make sure you find me attractive.”
Potter leaned back in his chair, looking at Draco intensely. But at least he wasn’t laughing; that was something. His expression was quite serious. “I’m not sure why you’re telling me this, Malfoy. Maybe you just needed to tell… someone. But… I’m not sure how much I can give you, besides telling you that your ex-wife sounds like a real piece of work, and that she obviously didn’t deserve you. Other than that, it seems like… time… and distance from this are going to be the only things that can really help you. I don’t know what else to say.”
Draco looked down at his outfit: tight gray trousers, a green v-neck jumper over a white button down, finished off with well-tailored charcoal sport coat.
“To draw them downstairs?”
“You and Allison seemed to get on,” Harry remarked after they’d spent a little while longer in silence.
“Right,” said Harry, and Draco found himself smiling. There were some things for which Harry always seemed to forget that magic could be used, left over, Draco had no doubt, from his Muggle upbringing. Still it popped up at amusing moments.
students a proper education.”
Hermione tilted her head and considered the question. “Not quite. Because I think I would have fit with Blaise, too, just in a different way. A very different way. That was what it came down to, in the end. The relationships I could see unfolding with each of them were so drastically different that it turned out to be not that hard to determine which I wanted more, which I would be happier in.”
Kemp raised a dark eyebrow. “Then make it count. Show me what you’ve been working on.”
“What, Dempsey?” she asked tightly. She knew she should have stuck to keeping her things in the women’s locker room down the hall. She had a lot more privacy there. But this was just so convenient, as it was attached to the Auror training room, and even though it was coed, provided separate bathrooms and private changing rooms, which was really all she needed. The downside, of course, was that it meant she shared a locker room with Chadwick Dempsey.
as good as you.”
, he added silently to himself.
“I like it,” said Harry. “And I was learning a lot. Just because I don’t want to compete doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy the sport.”
“Neville will be coming for an orientation on Friday,” McGonagall told the group. “He’ll sit in on Pomona’s Friday classes to observe and then will spend the weekend with her getting familiar with the greenhouses. Please be kind and welcoming to him, and let him know how excited we are that he’ll be joining our ranks. He knows he has very big shoes to fill and he wants to do the job well. He’ll need our support and encouragement.”
Draco kept his head down, secretly enjoying her theatrics. “Well, he never outright said any of that.”
“So, to what do I owe the pleasure, Professor Potter?”
“They fed you through a flap in your bedroom door,” Draco said, resting his chin on one of his hands and staring at the headboard. He realized he was simply repeating a lot of what Harry was saying in disbelief, but he couldn’t help it. “They kept you prisoner, to stop you from learning magic.”
“And how did you respond?”
No matter, he would just hole up in his room for the next few hours and work on homework. As a sixth year, there was
“Let me explain it then, in a way you will understand,” Hermione said, straightening up. Robards’ had almost a foot on her, height-wise, but he still leaned back automatically, reacting to her change in posture. “You may see Ron as just another one of your Aurors, one you can use as you see fit, but he’s also one of the most competent, most decorated, and most loved in the Corps, and there are plenty, including the Minister of Magic himself, who would never simply stand by and watch his rights be violated like this. On top of that, he is the center of
Harry paused, his mouth lingering at the point Draco had indicated, his eyes looking up at the blond again in a silent question.
, simply so you can be more efficient in your paltry choice of a career,” the man replied acidly, finally seeming to have snapped.
“Some of them,” said Ron. “Others step up when you least expect them to. People can surprise you.”
“Sweet Merlin, Draco, this is getting steamy.”
But no, she didn’t think that was it. Ron wasn’t that cruel.
Harry thrust a little harder, a little faster, his hands tightening on Draco like he was terrified of letting go. “Draco,” he whispered. “You are everything to me.”
two years older than you, and sixteen-year-old boys-“
Harry scoffed. “Of course not. I’ll wait right here for you, then watch you get dressed. I like doing that.”
“Or break the statute of secrecy,” Kyle said, closing the distance between them even more so he could keep his voice low, and so his breath could brush along Clint’s ear. Definitely that too.
“We really must be going. Thank you for the lovely tea, Minerva,” Andromeda said, turning to the headmistress.
“And Lindsey was wondering where you were.”
year dormitories. Though his stomach twisted a little with nerves every time he thought about what he was in store for when he went back, most of him was heart-poundingly excited.  He just had a feeling that he was going to enjoy himself.
Draco snorted. “I hardly think the two of you had a
Scorpius’ brow furrowed, wondering what exactly he was catching in his dad’s tone. “What, is there something you don’t like about-“
He knew there would be unavoidable closeness when he started sleeping with Harry, but he had never expected this much…
“Well, you say you’re bound to get letters because of the article that just came out, and of course you’re right… but doesn’t that mean your relatives will get letters as well?”
Harry rolled his eyes and Teddy giggled. He liked hearing Harry and Draco rib each other, though Draco didn’t know what it was that the boy found so funny about it. Still, he threw his cousin a surreptitious wink over Harry’s shoulder and got a big smile in response.
“I just needed a new challenge, I suppose.”
They lay there for a while, just breathing and sighing, and Hermione found herself already starting to feel better. She was a bit tired after all, but it was mostly mental fatigue, and she found she didn’t really want to sleep. She just wanted to be close to Ron.
Harry raised his eyebrows skeptically. “You’ve only seen his good side. But believe me when I say, when he’s angry, he’s a force to be reckoned with.”
“You like the jacket I take it?” he teased, raising an eyebrow in his best imitation of the Slytherin.
“And that’s all it does? I mean, it changes the design of the ring to match my… essence, or whatever, but that’s all it does?”
. Act like you care about
“Or he would, if he ever spoke,” Paul said. “Do you speak?” he asked Draco, arching a brow.
“You’re like a sister to me, Hermione. I never intended to talk to you about any of this stuff.”
Schoolwork had been piling up, and it was the worst week for it. Between the breakup with Ginny and the ever-growing fixation with Malfoy, Harry wasn’t getting much rest. Something had to change, and soon.
He shook his head. “Kingsley.”
“What can I do?” Draco asked softly.
“I’ve no idea.”
They chuckled to themselves quietly for a minute or two, their worries temporarily forgotten.
She might have meant it as a foil for his argument, but Draco considered the question as if she had asked it in earnest. “I think I’ll know it when I find it.”
Draco blinked and found himself nodding.
“Yeah… but that doesn’t mean… This isn’t how I was planning to get it.”
“Just getting excited for the big day, is all,” Harry added, with the straightest face he was capable of mustering.
, Hermione thought. Most interiors of wizarding homes were part Muggle, part magical, as inside their homes they didn’t have to worry much about secrecy. Guensler’s situation was obviously different.
Mila pulled her shirt down and returned to sitting with surprising grace. She stared at the floor.
He let go of Harry’s cock and the brunet let out a frustrated growl.
“Mmm, I bet I was. Did you come?”
Draco closed the door behind him and came further into the room, seating himself on the edge of Harry’s bed. Out of the corner of his eye Harry could pick up on the relaxed body language that was meant to convey Draco’s infinite patience, though he knew in actuality his boyfriend was probably anxious for an answer. Harry stopped pacing and turned to him.
Vesper resisted the urge to roll her eyes. The so-called Potter-Malfoy Contingent was what the press decided to dub the group of people that spent a great deal of social time with wizarding Britain’s most talked about couple. The group included, but was certainly not limited to, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Pansy Nott, née Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Hannah Abbott, Neville Longbottom, and her.
The next day, he and Narcissa had returned to France, and Scorpius had immediately shown Dad-Draco the ring and told him everything the man had said.
“You can do that much detail in gold?” he asked.
“Trust me, you will,” said Harry. “Mere seconds after.” He gripped Draco’s wrist. “I’m ready,” he said. “Time to lube yourself up.”
So he was avoiding the issue altogether. He was pretending it wasn’t happening, because it wasn’t, not really. It was only happening in his own mind, and he could have mastery over his own mind. From Emilia’s side of things, they were the same as ever. He was her best friend, the one she talked about boys with, the one to whom she described every detail of her dates, so that they could break them down and analyze them together. If he couldn’t continue to be that for her, then he didn’t know where he belonged in her life, and that terrified him much more than seeing her with another boy. Losing her completely was the one thing he couldn’t bear, and if he told her his true feelings, what he
“My light went out,” said the boy softly.
“I feel like I did,” said Harry, “just watching and listening to you.” He rolled to face Draco, pulling the blond to him. He ran fingers lightly down Draco’s spine, and Draco nuzzled into his neck. “Stay for dinner.”
year bathroom incident all over again.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry replied, taking her outstretched hand and giving it a light kiss, as he knew he was supposed to do. “It’s a pleasure to be here.”
, so the attacker can be captured easily.”
“You know, university,” she said. “I’ve always loved science, and I decided I wanted to be a biochemist. My parents are working class, not a lot of education… not
he thought with determination. If there was one thing he did know, it was that he would do anything for Harry. He could be better, for Harry.
Draco’s heart sank. Of
Harry paused. He certainly hadn’t expected that question. “I… don’t know. We haven’t talked about it. It’s… a little early for that. If we do decide to live together, it won’t be for a little while, probably.”
“There’s no need to thank me, Harry,” Draco said. “You deserve someone who will make time for you. So that’s what I plan to keep doing.” He gave Harry another kiss. “I love you.”
Draco downed the remainder of his tea and nodded, and Pipsy appeared swiftly to pour him another cup. “Thank you Pipsy,” he said.
Then Harry talked about his birthdays, or lack thereof, and the way he was forced to watch while Dudley opened a mountain of presents on his own birthday. And he talked about the bullying from Dudley, and the way he kept other children from befriending Harry, and the way Vernon and Petunia told his teachers and neighbors he was a troublemaker, and was not to be trusted, which was further confirmed whenever Harry would do some accidental magic to protect himself.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re a prat.”
“I guess we’ll just have to see what happens.”
“You said that I wanted you to be something you couldn’t be,” she said, and Harry nodded. “Well, I don’t think that’s fair. You don’t know what I want.”
negatively, and it has nothing to do with who I am.” He realized he sounded petulant, but he couldn’t help it.
Harry eyed Hermione, hoping she would pick up on the fact that he didn’t want to talk about it.
He smiled back. “Precisely.”
When they entered the ballroom, Arthur barely had time to get his announcement out before there was cheering and hollering erupting from all of the guests. They smiled and waved but were inundated quickly with well-wishers, anyone who hadn’t gotten to speak to them yet and wanted to offer their congratulations. It was all a bit overwhelming, and Harry had a feeling his face would be hurting by the end, with all the grinning he was doing.
“Besides, it’s basically the end of the first date, so I’m only a few minutes off.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Ron said, lifting his head. “We’ve drifted way too far off the subject.” His look turned knowing, and Vesper gave him a small, guilty smile. “You understand what I expect from you, yes?”
I feel sad.” He blinked rapidly a moment, his eyes focused on the ceiling. “But I do.” A tear spilled over, and he wiped it from his cheek quickly. “I don’t
His expression softened. “Yes, I know that.”
“Very well,” Narcissa said, after a long silence. “Perhaps over the summer I will have an opportunity to take a look.”
Harry elbowed him playfully. “Yeah, yeah. What’s yours, then?”
Some took front and center, though, placed in the most prominent of locations. There were many baby pictures of all three children, family portraits of the five of them over the years, and some other family and friends featured as well, particularly the Weasleys and the Longbottoms.
Draco found himself smiling shyly by the end of her speech, a torrent of emotions running through him, most of them good. “It means a lot that you were willing to give me a chance and put Harry first. That’s what I want to do too. It was my main intention when I came here tonight, which is why I’m glad I got the chance to apologize. And I’ll apologize to Ron as well, of course. And I will continue to do everything I can to make Harry happy. But now, I’ll admit that it’s more than that for me. I’d be very glad to know you properly, to call you my friends. I hope I can earn the same feelings from you someday.”
“I suppose they thought, if you learned magic, you’d one day return and take your revenge, and there was nothing they could do to stop you.”
“Come here,” he said, spreading himself out, just as Clint had described earlier. It was as clear an invitation as he could give, and Clint seemed happy to oblige. He came closer, climbing up on the bed so he was kneeling between Kyle’s spread legs. “You’re gorgeous, you know,” Kyle told him.
“Draco…”
. “But it’s not their life; it’s mine. And I’m not ready for that yet. I like keeping my options open. I like focusing on my teaching and spending time with the people who know me best. I haven’t met a partner I trust that much yet, to really make them a part of my life. But I also like sex. So…”
“Dance?”
“It’s all right, Pipsy, you rest,” he told the elf. “It’s just tea.”
“I don’t know, Teddy,” he said. “It’s been a long week. I think we need to rest.”
“No, never. This is very much a one-time deal,” Harry said, and both men chuckled.
“I’m going to them,” Draco said.
By the time he made it back to his bedroom he was vibrating with anger. His father had always been able to wind him up better than anyone – with the exception, perhaps, of Harry Potter, back in his youth – but he didn’t remember it ever being this bad. Whatever criticism he’d had of Draco, Lucius had always been loving and protective of Narcissa. Draco couldn’t understand what had changed; perhaps his parents were in the midst of some sort of row that put them at odds. He could readily admit that there was much about his parents’ marriage that he didn’t understand or wasn’t privy to.
Allison gave a dry, breathy laugh, staring down at her hands. “I relate to that to a rather uncanny degree, actually. My parents have never really understood me or my ambitions. They never supported me in what I wanted to do, and I had to make my own way. It was very lonely.”
Harry saw Draco nod. “All right.”
Harry nodded. “And don’t think I haven’t grasped the irony of that,” he said, his tone suddenly dry.
“And all the opinions contradict each other,” added Harry.
Thanks for the kudos lately! And, most of all, to the lovely people who have been commenting. <3
“I won’t, I promise,” Harry said, simply grateful that Madam Pomfrey wasn’t going to kick him out altogether.
But these moments were proving to be hard to come by, one might even say elusive.
Ginny dropped her gaze and nodded. “Well, all right then.”
“But we’re… you know, sentient, or whatever.”
“So well,” Harry breathed.
“I’ll probably wait until dinner, but go on and pour me a glass.”
The cheers surrounded them as they made their way back down the aisle. Harry was pretty sure some of the guests were tossing flower petals on them, or maybe spraying it from their wands with a charm. He caught the eyes of a few of his students as well as a number of Weasleys. They were all grinning widely, clapping and wolf-whistling. He spotted Narcissa Malfoy amongst the crowd too, and felt a jolt of surprise.
? To avoid having to come out?”
They followed Ron all the way to his office in silence, both of them refusing to look at each other.
, but she might be trying to keep things… cordial, with your father, keep her marriage intact. Seems to me she believes he’ll come around eventually.”
“All right.”
“Believe me, they’ve tried,” Harry said with a wry smile. “But I made it clear when I took the job: I’ll show up and gladhand and get fawned over all they want me to, but I’m not giving any speeches. That’s where I draw the line.”
“Seeing you with another man,” Harry answered simply. “I had no idea it would hurt so much.”
“That’s part of it, yes,” Draco said. “And I do the sort of things that a parent would do for you. Like what Toby’s mum and dad do for him.”
The nights, though, were something else altogether. There was plenty of sex, of course, which was brilliant as always, but that wasn’t what made those winter nights special. Rather it was that in the safe and secluded blanket of darkness it was easier for Harry and Draco both to lay bare that which they sometimes hid by the light of day. Embarrassing secrets, painful memories, and sweet confessions were whispered into the air, unheard by anyone but the two of them, absorbed, accepted, and tucked away for safekeeping.
Draco’s half-eaten sandwich went temporarily forgotten as he looked at said photographs with a sober expression. His eyes scanned the wounds, assessing the details.
“You don’t think that sounds enjoyable?” Draco teased.
“You want to become a teacher.”
“No,” Harry said, realizing he had led them off the subject. “That’s not it. If I want it, I’ll go for it, obviously. But I’m not sure I do.”
“That’s so good, Callum,” Potter said, his voice dark and hypnotic. “Gods, look how much you can take.”
“Very skillful magic,” said Draco. “Apparently the charms masters they keep on staff are some of the best in the world.”
to do this for you. Therefore I want it for myself.”
“I know Harry likes practical learning. And we
“Sure, sure.” Kyle looked at Draco. “Did you find it?”
Ginny stared at him for a second, then turned and started walking towards Gryffindor tower without a word. Harry turned to look at Draco, giving him an apologetic smile.
. Her mouth wrapped very warmly around the name, and Harry’s suspicions were confirmed.
The man’s hand was rough with callouses, not unlike Harry’s, and there was a long scar above his right eyebrow that Draco thought must be from a curse. He was probably scarred all over, come to think of it. If the war and only two years as an Auror had marred Harry’s skin the way it had, then Ron Weasley’s extra six years with the Corps on top of that had probably left him with more marks than skin.
“Ew, gross,” said Kyle, making a face. “Seriously.”
“Dessert, then,” said Harry. “Everyone wanted a chance to spend some time with you. I hope you don’t mind.”
“And then I figured you’d simply come back here. And then I was worried for a different reason.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Bollocks. You should listen to yourself. Going on and on about how you love her and you’re so miserable without her and you want to fight for her, but there’s this bloody
Two more strokes and Draco did come, spilling all over Harry’s hand and the sheets below them, tightening around Harry and sending him over the edge.
see that. He loves you.”
“Yes,” Harry insisted. “You’re more articulate than I am. You can help me get my point across. And I’ll be braver if you’re there.”
“I imagine that is something that might be achievable,” he said. “But only if Zabini agrees. He cannot know what you want unless you tell him.”
“It’s a term we use to describe the psychogenic motor immobility-“
“Right, of course,” said Potter, turning to Draco and giving him a smile. “Good to see you again, Malfoy.” He held out a hand.
“Well,” Pansy said nonchalantly, taking a sip of water, “even if you think it’s no good for Teddy there’s always the possibility of it being a bedroom for a
“I’m not concerned that you won’t be successful here,” she went on. “I know that you are, that you will continue to be. But I do wonder…” She sighed. “I cannot speak for anyone else, but it is difficult for me to be here, some days. Everything is still so fresh. Even though we’ve rebuilt Hogwarts, and it looks even better than it did before, the memories are there, as are the ghosts of the people we’ve lost, both figurative and literal.”
She huffed a small laugh and hooked her arm through his. “Yes,” she said softly. “All right.”
“Oh, Gods,” said Kyle, not liking where this was going,
“No problem,” said Harry. “We’ve just been passing the time lazily. Or I have anyway. Scorpius has been very productive, of course.”
“He lives with his grandmother,” said Paul. “I didn’t realize that. Where are his parents?”
of me, was unwavering. I’d never felt so special. And his kindness and humility helped me too. I had a few sharp edges, I think because I was always used to having to constantly defend myself. Being a woman in the sciences isn’t easy. He helped soften me a bit, made me less defensive, more confident.”
And there was Max to consider, someone Kyle knew he both liked and was attracted to. He definitely wanted to see where it would go.
Draco coming from Harry’s cock alone, and the awe in Harry’s voice afterwards.
“The old bulb is still in the nightlight. Just take a look at it. The wattage and voltage are written right there on the side.”
“It’s just…” Draco giggled. “It sounds like a taunt I would have given you in school. ‘Eat my arse, Potter.’ Only…” The laughter was in his belly now, coming from deep within him. “Only you would have
“But why would they do that?” Vesper asked. “Why deliberately alert someone that you’ve broken into their house?”
“You can’t think like that, Ron. You just… you can’t. Not if you are going to work this out.”
“I’ll escort you, if you don’t mind,” Draco told her. “I’m rather tired as well.”
“Sorry,” the brunet said, fighting a smile at Draco’s stunned silence, and not really looking very sorry at all. “I assumed you knew.”
“I can tell by your face that you feel guilty. Don’t. You’re young, and you just haven’t found the right person for you. If Ginny couldn’t be supportive of your decisions, then she wasn’t right for you.”
“We’re getting married,” Draco said.
“But you were right,” said Harry. “I didn’t want to hear it, but you were right. Hermione will make the decision that is best for her, and that’s the way it should be. I did the same thing when I broke up with Ginny, and I don’t regret it for a moment, because it meant I got to be with you.”
“Yes, she’s quite talented, isn’t she?” Harry said, happy to find some common ground. “She’s doing exceptional work in my class as well. But I have a feeling she likes Potions better than Defense. She loves to read and research. Reminds me a lot of Hermione, actually.”
But such thoughts returned when she entered the atrium and saw Declan across the way, waiting for her. He had two large paper cups in hand and smiled at her as she approached, offering her one.
With a heavy sigh she let the bird in, and the owl hooted softly at her in greeting and recognition.
Speedy, trembling hands undid belt buckles and pushed trousers to the floor, eager feet shuffled out of their shoes and socks, and the two bodies collided again, almost entirely naked. Only the thin cotton of their pants separated Draco and Harry now, pulled taut over the evidence of their mutual arousal.
. Now that he didn’t have Draco’s presence to distract him, he found himself burning with curiosity as to what Draco had brought him.
Draco didn’t hesitate, slamming back against Harry as Harry thrust in.
Harry thought about that, and then huffed a bit in frustration. “I don’t know. It just feels wrong to me. Obviously laws should protect parents, but they should protect children as well.”
“I ask for a sign that you want the same things I want and instead you break up with me. Well, I guess I have my answer.”
. What a pretentious little prick Mr. Fawley was. Not to mention a vocal and shameless blood supremacist. Harry couldn’t stand him. And now he actually had to sit down with the solicitor and have a conversation the following day, one he was really not looking forward to. But it had to be done. There was nothing for it.
He buried his face in Harry’s shoulder, his cock still inside the brunet and moving in almost imperceptible little thrusts as Harry wrung every last drop out of him with his powerful muscles. Merlin, it felt so
“Graze it with your teeth.”
“Then I will have failed you.”
“She’s not throwing like she usually does!” Xandra said defensively, crossing her arms. Ginny gave the short-haired brunette a withering look. “Sorry,” she said, “but it’s true.”
“I’m glad you did,” the brunet said finally. “We haven’t spent much time together lately.”
Vesper looked at him some more, and decided it really did seem like he understood. She nodded, then checked her watch. “I have to go to work.”
Draco nodded. “I’m seeing the truth of that. When it comes to my parents, for example… I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to do it. I’m not sure I could bear the way I know my father would look at me.”
She swallowed. “I just want you to be happy,” she said. “That’s all I’ve ever wanted. And I’m leaving soon, and sometimes I worry that I’m leaving you in worse shape than when I came here.”
Harry sat up abruptly and turned around, wanting to get a good look at his boyfriend’s face. Draco had his usual calm mask in place, but Harry knew him well enough now to know that the expression hid his nervousness. “Are you sure?”
… You said I deserve pleasure. I believe I do. I don’t want all this…
“I spent the first eighteen years of my life thinking very little about what I wanted or needed. But I don’t do that anymore. I like to give others what they want, when I can, but what I want is just as important. You’ve told me what you want. Now let me think about what I want. Then we can talk and see if something can be arranged.”
Harry smiled and kissed him, and Draco returned it enthusiastically.
. Eloise Parrish had known all along.
“Are you really going to talk to me about my love life?” she asked him, incredulous. “You
Harry lifted his head and looked at him again. Then he pulled out, only by a few inches, and pushed back in again. Draco gasped and clutched him. Harry did it again.
She laughed, though it sounded dry and disbelieving. “Uhhh, yeah, love, he is. Where have
They finished off their second course in conversation about their two friends, Draco first filling Harry in on what he had learned through Francesca’s letters, followed by both of them speculating on what would happen next and if the two of them would work out in the end.
“Did you really bring a Death Eater to a war orphan’s birthday party?”
“Like that,” he said, breaking their previously wordless lovemaking. “Gods,
“Yeah. I’ve got to run a comprehensive
Draco looked at him carefully for a long time. “It still makes me nervous.”
“They’re

to be used, and if it is somehow being stored without a means of release, it could… explode. It’s essentially a bomb waiting to go off.”
She smiled but shook her head. “Thanks, but I’m good.”
Bulstrode dipped her head. It was a small gesture, but to Hermione it spoke volumes. “He hasn’t spoken a word since he came to us five hours ago. He hasn’t moved of his own accord or acknowledged the presence of anyone around him. He is completely catatonic.”
Harry returned the favor, then slid a hand up under the white shirt that had come untucked from black trousers, feeling the taut skin that stretched over the lean muscle of Malfoy’s abdomen.
“A fair few,” Harry replied nonchalantly, finishing off his whiskey and wondering how Malfoy would respond.
“I’ll have a butterbeer, thanks.”
“Easy for you to say. You don’t have to listen to him day in and day out-“
“Yes, of course. You’ll like him too, I wager.”
?” The woman repeated. “Not on your life, you complete idiot.” She began dragging him down the hall and towards his usual suite of rooms as she continued her tirade. “Have you forgotten that your mother wanted a whole set of wedding photos of both sides
“Unless they don’t want to be seen as favoring purebloods too much, or are afraid it will appear they have something to hide.”

“More than talking.”
“What a way to go, though,” Ron said with a grin, giving the back of her head a kiss. “You about done in here? Victoire wants to play.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, and there was true need straining his voice.
“You’ve heard back from Lindsey Bergeron, I suppose?”
He entered the room through the open door and saw Harry standing before a large cabinet with glass doors, his hands on his hips as he appeared to be contemplating the object. Funnily enough, Kreacher stood next to him in the exact same posture, as though deliberately imitating him, and Draco chuckled at the sight.
Harry groaned again.
“This is more research with McNeal?” Harry asked, accepting his firewhiskey from Francesca with a thankful smile. Draco nodded. “How is that going?”
Harry’s eyes glinted at him with warmth and amusement. “Hey, whatever works.”
His cousin’s eyebrows shot towards his hairline, but he grinned. “Okay.”
She felt herself deflate a little. “Thank you,” she said.
But maybe he could have the best of both worlds.
“I didn’t,” she said. “The letter is still sitting in a drawer in my desk. I never wrote him back.”
“The key is, I think,” Harry said finally, pulling Draco out of his meditation, “to make sure that we disrupt Teddy’s routine as little as possible. The transition will be hard enough on him as it is, without him having to change the basic schedule of his day-to-day life. I think we have to be very careful about that.”
Teddy sighed, clearly frustrated. “I want to help him
, he thought gleefully as he heard the Chaser curse at his failure. He zoomed forward again, his arm outstretched, reaching for the ball before they both hit the stands. Two meters, one meter, the faces of startled looking spectators were coming ever closer, but Harry stretched that extra inch and his hand wrapped tightly around the Snitch, just in time for him to pull up before he crashed into the sea of green and silver.
Harry laughed. “A subtle distinction, I think,” he said. But he had to admit that, on the inside, he was secretly pleased.
“Ron’s been on me about eating more regularly, too, so…”
“And you never had such conversations with Ginevra? You never talked about you joining the Aurors, and her playing professional Quidditch, and having kids-“
“Only if you’re
The dark-haired man noticed him coming, and bit his lip in a flirtatious and promising way. Draco mustered his courage to take the final few steps.
Draco didn’t realize it would so sexy, watching Harry finger himself, but it was. The brunet worked himself on his fingers with his eyes closed, letting out small huffs of breath as he probed deeper. Draco meant to take in the whole picture, but he found himself fixated by Harry’s parted lips and the tongue that kept darting out to wet them. And then Harry obviously hit his own prostate, because he released a cry of pure pleasure that made Draco have to grip the base of his cock to keep from coming, worked up as he already was.
“You still learned a lot?” Draco supplied. “So maybe you can be glad it happened, despite everything that went wrong?”
“Hey,” he said, once he’d reached her chair. He sat down in the one right next to her, sighing as he did.
“Ok…”
He saw Harry’s eyes soften. “So what you’re saying is, we should make plans, but always be prepared to be adaptable, because there is always uncertainty.”
Not wanting to correct her on his name a second time, Harry followed Draco out of the parlor and waited until they were well out of earshot before saying, “Does your mother hate me? I can’t tell.”
He heard the bathroom door open and he opened his eyes. “Draco?”
“You knew how he would react,” Vesper said.
He dropped the privacy spell, finally, and as he started packing up his school things he could hear Marissa and Dad-Harry still discussing her shield.
Draco shook his head. He couldn’t even imagine. “So what did you do?”
“Yes,” Hermione said. “Yes, of course. But I’ve been in love with Ron for years. That’s not going to go away in a day, or a week, or even a month.”
Neville shrugged. “Got to spend my nights at home, tucked in bed, though, didn’t I?”
“All right.” This, Harry could only assume, was going to be his least favorite bit.
Harry sighed. “That’s more complicated.”
pursue a Potions NEWT?” Malfoy’s reply was probably meant to be a dig, but Harry chose to ignore that.
“The long and short of it is that she’s working out how to be happy right now. I don’t think she’s ready for a relationship yet. But I’m… cautiously optimistic, let’s say, for the future.”
“I’m going to take the job Naomi Thickett offered me,” Harry said into the dark. They’d had a long day, full of classes and studying, and Harry hadn’t even gotten a chance to say anything to Draco, or anyone else, for that matter, about his decision. Now they were in bed, and Harry felt the sudden urge to get it off his chest.
Harry glanced up at the portrait of Dumbledore to find him snoozing away in his frame, or, at least, pretending to. “Dumbledore once told me that it is our choices that make us who we are, more than our abilities,” He told McGonagall.
To his surprise, David glared at Paul, who was looking confused. “You bloody idiot. After I said all that…”
Harry laughed and shook his head, making for the boys dorms and practically bounding up the stairs once he was out of sight of the common room.
Draco looked around the store, hoping their slightly raised voices weren’t causing a scene. He leaned towards Harry, lowering his voice. “In the way that we talked about it being an arrangement where we weren’t exclusive and it wasn’t going to last and eventually we’d go back to just being friends. Kyle and I are
“You can ask me anything,” Kyle said.
“Look,” he said. “Haven’t you ever created a fantasy that you knew was impossible?”
“Like a clitoris, for example?” Harry said, arching a brow.
“Then we’ll only confirm what the student body already assumes: that we’re totally hot for each other. They’ll be quite gratified, I’m sure.”
years, leaving more flexibility for independent study and the chance for students to pursue internships outside of Hogwarts. Hermione, for example, ventured to wizarding London via floo once or twice a week to work in the office of a solicitor who focused on creature rights. Others had internships at the Ministry, or had started apprenticeships with a master in one particular subject. Harry hadn’t arranged anything of the sort for himself, since it had always been his plan to enter Auror training after graduation. The more he thought about it, though, the more he wondered if that was what he really wanted…
Harry had obliged, fully aware that Teddy was standing there, watching them. Andromeda met his eyes after a few minutes.
She sat for a little while longer, just watching him. “Yes, sir,” she said finally. “Thank you.”
When he arrived by floo to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place Draco had to wonder for a moment if he’d somehow garbled his words or gotten the address wrong. The sitting room he’d tumbled into didn’t look anything like he’d expected a room in the Ancient House of Black look. For one thing, it was very clean, and last he’d seen or heard of it the very neglectful house elf that “kept up” with the place didn’t clean very much at all. For another, the furniture was new, or at least only a few years old. The sofa and armchairs were upholstered in gray suede that matched, but not overly so, the patterned blue and white carpet. The walls were a soothing, understated green, and the room was finished with a sleek coffee table in dark wood and matching side tables for the electric lamps.
“I’m not
A date was what he needed, a nice conversation with someone who
The tech chuckled. “That’s true.” He paused. “Your sample’s done.” He pointed to the vial, which was now full of a cloudy white liquid. “Your diagnosis was correct.”
“Are you all right?” he asked the blond.
“It’s you,” Harry said. Draco snorted delicately. “No, really,” Harry insisted. “You bring it out in me.” It was the truth. He’d been decent with Ginny, he was pretty sure. He’d always known how to push her buttons and make her feel good, and she’d always responded well to him. But Draco took Harry to another level. There was no self-consciousness, no overthinking. It was just instinct, pure and primal. When he was touching Draco, kissing him, inside him, he just
Draco bit back a sigh. He really didn’t want to talk about this anymore. “I’m absolutely certain that it doesn’t make a bit of difference
“Quite. You know, I attended the World Cup when it was here in Britain. It’s something else, even for a Quidditch match.” That had been twelve years ago, now. It was hard to believe. “It helped we were in the Minister’s box. Best view in the house.”
“Master…”
“Yeah, we’re working on that,” Harry said, thinking of the portrait of Walburga Black that was still stuck to the wall in the hallway. But he was determined to get rid of it, one way or another. “I should also mention that I’m going back to Hogwarts, and won’t be staying here much for the next nine months or so. Will that be a problem for the… healing of the house?”
Harry relinquished his fork as well and looked at her. “Don’t, please, really. I was…” He considered what he was going to say. “I was just having a bad week, I suppose. Or I was… I don’t know. Lunch with you is always something I look forward to and I… was disappointed, I guess.”
“No, not on its own. You have to enter a password with your wand here.” He pointed to the open drawer, where there was a shimmering, translucent shield on the surface, keeping them both from seeing what was inside. On one side of the shield sat a row of little blank spaces, and Ron lifted his wand and started tapping them until they formed a numerical code: 19910901.
“We've had more important things to worry about,” Vesper agreed with a small smile.
“That it would,” Kyle cut him off. “Yeah, yeah, I know.” He turned away, his arms folded over his chest. “It doesn’t really make much of a difference, does it?”
“Ron and I are completely different in so many ways. It presents challenges and it has benefits. But Blaise and I… we’re quite similar. We have a lot of common interests and think in much the same way, but that also has me a bit nervous. I need someone who… who pushes me, not makes me more like I already am.”
“I missed these,” he found himself saying, just as Harry’s hand snuck up under Draco’s shirt as well.
“Sorry,” Harry said looking up at Draco. His face was taut and drawn. “I just couldn’t take it anymore. I don’t know why. I just had to get out of there.”
“Ron said you know a lot about dark artifacts?”
“I didn’t say anything,” Harry said, holding up his hands. His smile, though, remained knowing, and Scorpius rolled his eyes, deciding he wanted this subject done with.
Pairing: Harry/Draco
“Sure, I’m familiar with it.”
“Yeah.”
that was resting there. He held it up for Harry to see, a mischievous glint in his eye. “So you’re officially wizarding Britain’s most eligible bachelor now, hm?”
“No time like the present.”
“I understand,” she said. “I don’t expect… I’m not looking to point fingers. I hope you know that.” How could she, when at least one finger would most surely end up being pointed back at herself? She had caused this in the first place. “I know that this is a complicated situation. But even if you don’t know everything that’s happening, I would still like to hear what you do know. Even a partial explanation is better than no explanation at all.”
“She was a bit sulky,” Ron said, regaining Harry’s attention. “Or… maybe not sulky. Quiet, though.”
Though Draco had never pined for Pansy himself, he couldn’t help but think Theo a lucky man. His wife was striking, intelligent, and, above all else, fiercely loyal. Draco could only hope to find the same one day.
“Sounds like you’re open to the idea of having a magical child.”
, the parchment read.
Maybe, he realized, as he took Draco into his mouth and felt the blond do everything in his power not to writhe underneath him, he
“Bloody hell.”
Harry snorted. “I think most of the wizarding world won’t be so grateful, when they find out. It’s been printed in the papers that I’m aiming for an Auror position when I graduate.”
“You seem unsure,” Kyle said. “We don’t have to-“
The man had a sense of humor too, however. Harry had caught glimpses of it in the past few weeks, but he was getting the full force of it now. It was dry, sarcastic, and frequently at Harry’s expense, but the Gryffindor found he didn’t mind that so much. All he had to do was toss an affectionate accusation of “prat” or “git” in Malfoy’s direction and the blond would laugh, take a sip of whiskey, and grin at Harry, his eyes twinkling.
Harry was yawning heavily the next morning at breakfast. It had been a late night, with all the homework he had put off for most of the day. To make matters worse, he had the expected pile of well meaning but heavily misguided sympathy letters that he had to sort through. He was so irritated and tired that when he finally uncovered that morning’s edition of the
Draco put his arm around Harry and kissed his temple, letting his mouth rest there for a moment. “I get to be nervous and worried about this without it meaning that I hold you responsible. I’m just afraid someone will get hurt. That’s not on you. It’s just… the situation.”
He finished dressing and told the man that yes, he could see himself out. Jim/John didn’t bother asking Draco for his mobile number or offering up his own, the way some others did, and Draco appreciated that. The man was savvy, at least. Not unintelligent. He was even funny and well-spoken. Any man would consider himself lucky to wind up in his bed. Draco knew that.
But Harry was pulling Draco towards him, gripping the cheeks of his arse possessively.
“Yeah,” said Harry, keeping pace with him as they made their way up a staircase. “Listen, is there something going on between you and Ginny?”
On the other hand, it bothered her to see him this way. The Ron she knew and loved was gregarious and lively or, if something had upset him, passionate and outspoken. Ron could be quiet too, of course. Measured, calm, at peace. But this kind of quiet was different, and it disturbed her. There was a cloudy dullness in his blue eyes that she’d only seen once before, during the first time his arm was injured and he’d teetered on the edge of depression, waiting for his circumstances, his arm, to get better.
“It was for the best.” The bearded man, Paul, Potter had called him, suddenly glanced Draco’s way. “You’ve brought a friend.” His tone had turned appreciative as he looked Draco up and down in that way that Draco was becoming quickly familiar with. “Normal friend or special friend?”
“Good,” she stood, adjusting the sleeves of her blazer. “Because I’d never be able to find another deputy like you, so I’ve got to make sure I keep you happy.”
Draco considered making a meal out of the faux pas, if only to avoid further discussion on the matter of his mystery lover, but in the end decided he didn’t want to be
It was absurdly childish, fitting for a Hogwarts student, certainly. But did Harry really think that Draco would use something like this on his father, punish the man’s cruelty with…
Kyle grabbed Draco and kissed him deeply. “You know, for someone who says they’re tired of smooth talkers, you’re a pretty smooth talker yourself. Just saying.”
Harry did, watching with parted lips as Draco lifted himself up a few inches, slowly, cautiously, and then sank back down. Harry gasped the first time, then groaned the second, and Draco felt bolder. He had adjusted well, and the slide of the cock inside him like this, with him in control, was unexpectedly satisfying. He lifted himself higher and dropped again, harder this time, and Harry’s hands automatically went to Draco’s hips. With their steadying guidance Draco could up the pace, and so he did, bouncing on Harrys cock with new confidence, breathing ragged as he felt it brush his prostate once, then again, then again.
“Yes, of course it felt good.”
Draco chuckled beside him. “Luckily that is something that is easily remedied. It’s nearly time for lunch anyway.”
“A few minutes,” Harry whispered, as though he couldn’t believe it.
Harry smiled and kissed him in return. “I never forget, as you well know.”
Draco hadn’t seen Hannah looking this dejected before, and he felt some protectiveness flare up within him. He had half a mind to give Longbottom what-for on the issue. “I’m sorry, Han,” he said. “That sounds really frustrating.”
“He sounds like a prat.”
“Exactly. That was our thinking. So we tried it. But… I have to tell you, it’s just…
Harry sighed. “Yes, technically. But I don’t like giving direct orders like that, and Kreacher is… he knows how to find a way around orders, if he has a mind to. Not to mention, he and I have a complicated relationship as it is. It’s important that I maintain a level of transparency, a level of trust. He goes a bit… barmy, otherwise, and that’s no good for either of us.”
“Ah,” said Kyle. “Yeah, that makes sense.”
“You know how much I love you, Ted,” he had heard Draco murmur to the boy. “I’ll always come back to you, I promise.”
There was a buzzing noise in Harry’s ears at those words, and he almost thought, perhaps, that he had imagined them. Because this couldn’t possibly be happening, could it? “Love?”
“Mmmm, so?”
was due to bloom this weekend. I’ve been checking every six hours since Friday.
“Like hell,” she heard herself say aloud. She wasn’t going to stand for this.
Jaime nodded.
, Harry. You already are. Worthy, and then some.”
Vesper nodded, but internally she was grimacing. It was not the part of the job she was looking forward to. She’d rather be out in the field than in a cramped, dingy room all day.
He grabbed his wand and vanished their underwear, which earned a gasp from Harry. Then he cast cleansing and lubricating charms in order to prepare the brunet, sliding one finger inside the waiting heat of Harry’s entrance.
“Yes.”
He approached the lake and took a right, seeking out a secluded spot where the bank met the edge of the forest. He settled himself against a tree, shivering a little in the cold. He conjured some of the portable blue fire Hermione had taught him, warming his hands for a few minutes before getting comfortable and staring out over the lake.
“And sixth year, when I was stalking you. You must have liked that.”
Releasing Draco just long enough to reach over to the bedside table for the lube, Harry quickly returned, engulfing him again with fervor as he lubed up two fingers and plunged them into Draco, making the blond cry out yet again.
The grip on him tightened, and Draco sighed and melted into sleep.
“Yes. I was… crushing acromantula hair with my mortar and pestle.”
“Ah,” Draco said, nodding. “Well, I’m here to pick up Teddy for the day.” He spotted the boy on the jungle gym, playing with Toby and one other child, a girl with a blue bow in her blonde hair, and he waved. Teddy waved back, grinning.
“Juicy,” said another. Definitely Dempsey, this time. She was sure. “The kind you can bounce sickles off of.”
“We could, if you want,” said Kyle.
Zabini somehow managed to look incredulous without changing his impassive expression one iota. “If you say so,” he said.
Harry nodded. “Has he always been this… prickly? Or is he the way he is because of… you know…”
“Gods, Harry,” he said, when he really didn’t think he could take it. “Fuck me. Gods,
It was all there, every detail: the cupboard, the catflap on his bedroom door, the bars on his window, the ratty hand-me-downs, his aunt and uncle’s unwavering and vitriolic hatred of him and his magic, his cousin’s perpetual violence towards him, his lack of friends. It was all there, in print, for anyone to read. The dark, slimy underbelly of his upbringing.
“I have a gift for you too,” Draco said, after they had taken a few seconds to enjoy the moment. “Because, you know, it’s actually your birthday.”
“I’m sorry,” Vesper immediately said with a sigh. “Me and my big mouth.”
“’Blackmailing’ is a strong word.”
“Yes, and they could see it. They could see it easily. And they helped me, talked me through it, helped me get perspective…” His smirk widened, suddenly full of chagrin. “And David called me out, too.”
Draco thought.
“Oh, you are, are you?” She was searching for her jeans now, refusing to look at him.
When he arrived at dinner Francesca and Harry were sitting together at the staff table, so Draco went to join them. He wasn’t exactly sure how this whole “being friends” thing was going work out, considering that just seeing Harry was going to make Draco want to jump him, but he was determined to try. They’d made an agreement. And considering that Draco was the one to break off the arrangement, it was only right that he should make an effort, since this was important to Harry.
“Good,” Harry said. He leaned in for a kiss, and he knew the moment their lips collided that this was going to heat up, that they were going to need more from each other, after everything they'd just said. “Let me show you,” Harry whispered as his hand went exploring for Draco’s erection. “Let me show you what you mean to me.”
,” Harry whispered to the air as he climaxed. He threw an arm over his eyes, as though this would let him hide from his own stupidity. “Fuck, fuck,
“Good then. That’s all I had for the reception.”
those things. She had become an Auror, after all, and that required at least some sense of duty and honor and all that. It’s just that she knew it all already. Robards really didn’t have to keep going on about it, not when Vesper and her fellow graduates were practically bouncing in their seats, anxious to get their certificates and be able to officially call themselves Aurors.
“What kind of kiss was it?” Draco asked. “Was there tongue?”
“And you think we haven’t been preparing for it?” Harry countered. “What do you think we’ve been doing for the past three months?”
“You’re in a good mood,” she said, smiling a bit herself. Harry’s energy was infectious. “I take it the anniversary weekend went well?” It must have gone
Harry pouted but pulled away. “Yes, I know. Not that Scorp pays much attention anyway.” They both turned to look at their son, who had returned to digging in the dirt with a stick, babbling happily to himself all the while.
“That’s not the point anyway,” Angelina said. “The point is you need to stop tormenting yourself over this. It doesn’t do you any good.”
“I mean about the fact that I have no legal claim on him. I have no rights at all.”
Annoyingly, Vesper found herself almost grinning. “Blaise…”
Dudley nodded. “Right. Of course. Thank you for coming. It means a lot.”
“That’s just it, though,” Harry interrupted. “I know what I want. Like I said, I want him. I want Draco. But that’s clearly not an option right now.”
to do with this wedding, and she appeared to be seeing to every possible detail and, of course, sparing no expense. The fabric for Hermione and Vesper’s gowns, for example, was a special textile of acromantula silk dyed silver-gray and charmed to sparkle like the evening sky. The fabric was called Starlight and was, by Hermione’s estimate, over one hundred galleons a meter. Hermione didn’t know exactly how many meters of fabric were required to make the dress, but whatever the amount, this garment was likely the most expensive thing she would ever wear - second only, perhaps, to her own wedding dress.
“Not a clue, I’m afraid. Mila wouldn’t tell you?”
“No,” Teddy said, grinning again while the students around him giggled.
“Headmistress McGonagall said something similar,” Harry said.
“You tell me,” he replied, his blue eyes glinting.
“Right. Like that. You wouldn’t be expecting it.”
, he reminded himself.
“Harry,” Draco cut him off, his voice firm, but surprisingly calm. “If you bring this up again I swear to Lady Morgana herself that I will hex your bollocks off. And you know what a shame that would be for both of us.”
“No,” Ron said quietly.
Draco glanced at Harry, silently asking how he was with a raise of his eyebrows. Harry looked no worse for wear. His eyes were dry and his expression relaxed. Draco had no idea what the brunet was thinking at the moment.
“That’s all too true,” Draco said. “I’ve never met anyone as transparent as you. It’s a wonder you survived this war at all.” It wasn’t a particularly nice thing to say, but Draco’s voice was so tired, and so devoid of any malice, that Harry wasn’t sure if he should be insulted or not.
“And not because you liked Malfoy.”
still likes to report when I’m spotted out on a date, although thankfully it’s not front page news anymore.”
“The usual way?” Harry asked, lifting his head. “What way is that?”
Ron chuckled, giving her an amused look. “It really irks you, doesn’t it, not being able to find out?”
Mac looked down at the half-written report with a knowing smile. “Why don’t we finish that up together?”
“What makes you say that?”
Draco nodded slowly. Right. He could see how that would be difficult. What did Harry have to say to his uncle, at this point?
Kyle chewed on his lip. “I’m sorry.”
“But you’re right. It would hurt if you did that to me. And Merlin knows you’ve had plenty of chances, with all those insane admirers you have.”
Harry shrugged with his hands. “Well baking, much like life, is a messy business, I suppose.”
“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “It’s still weird, mind you. Even weirder to see him acting like… a normal human being.”
“Yes, Potter. Well-observed,” Draco said drily. “Nice to know your eyes are accurately connected to your brain.”
Harry couldn’t help it; he actually let a chuckle escape his lips. “No need to resort to murder, Draco.”
“Oh.”
should have put in a little more effort. Sounds to me like you did everything he wanted. You did everything right. So
“Damage to the magical core affects more than just one’s magic,” Malfoy said in his own version of a know-it-all tone that Harry was already becoming familiar with. While Hermione always sounded like she was reciting information from a book, Malfoy managed to sound ever so slightly incredulous, as if he couldn’t believe he was having to explain it in the first place. “A child with a damaged core will live a very difficult and painful life and die an early death. The core is like any other vital organ, if it is damaged, or unhealthy, we cannot survive it.” Malfoy was going over his own copy of the potion instructions, circling ingredients and making notes as he spoke. “And there is an argument to be made about quality of life. A life of suffering is no real life at all.”
Because that had been the goal, Draco was sure of it. Potter had intended for Draco to feel desired, sexy, wanted. The Gryffindor had hardly tried to hide his own interest or arousal; he hadn’t laughed arrogantly at the sounds Draco had made. If anything, he seemed to only get more turned on, more intoxicated, the more Draco reacted to him.
“Getting a bit monotonous, honestly,” Hermione said. “Lucky that I ran into Andromeda, or I would have been in danger of becoming very bored.”
those answers. I don't know a lot about the procedure for consulting outsiders on cases as sensitive as this one. But I for one would like to talk to a Healer about what it would actually mean to extract the magical core from a living body. And I’d like to talk to a magical engineer about what kind of materials can stand up to the raw magic exuded by a core. And I’d also like to talk to Ms. Nadharia more about the kind of damage the raw magic could specifically inflict and what it might look, sound, or feel like. I think, until we have a better grasp on all of that, there’s no way we can move forward on speculating on the design of the weapon. We just… we need more information.”
“Fair enough.” He appeared to be chewing over his next thought. “Were you worried I would be jealous or something?”
Hermione smiled too and scooted closer so he could reach her easily. She was practically straddling him now, her thighs wrapped around his.
