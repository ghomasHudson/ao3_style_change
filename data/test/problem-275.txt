Draco licked his lips, about to retaliate when the waitress showed up with the drinks. Harry sat back, taking the straw out of the glass and licking it in the most sinful way possible.
Draco looked up from the book cradled in his lap as a sobbing Pansy Parkinson practically fell out of his fireplace. He was up in an instant, book discarded, and wrapping his arms around his best friend.
"I did, sweetheart. Your dancing always cheers me up." She smiled fondly at him before narrowing her eyes. "I expect a full report tomorrow. I want all the salacious details of you and Potter."
It didn’t really matter, as Harry slipped off of his stool, out of the grasp of the drunkard. “Draco!” He rushed towards Malfoy, ignoring his shocked expression. He pulled him into a tight hug, whispering one word in his ear:
He shook himself out of it as the server pushed their drinks towards them, he was going to end up making a complete fool out of himself, he could feel it. “It doesn’t matter.” Draco murmured, taking a sip of his drink. The familiar burn warmed his throat and eased his nerves.
Ginny motioned him over to the fireplace and took a seat on the sofa with Luna. "She won't tell anyone."
Draco lifted his hips, struggling against the hot, firm body of Potter, who had the gall to smirk down at him. They were both panting slightly, and… was Draco hallucinating? Or was that the hard length of The Saviour pressed against his thigh?
She nodded, giving a small snort at his puppy theatrics. “But make sure the shirt is a summery colour, the weather is finally nice now.”
“Go fuck yourself, Malfoy. I knew you were a selfish bastard, but I didn’t know you could be this horrific.” As Harry spat the words, the candles in the shop all blew out at once. His magic coursed around him, his hands in fists as he stormed from the shop.
A lone woman bustled about the quiet shop, her shaking hands hurrying to package up the pills for her next customer. She was finally going to do it, after all these years. The very knowledge of what was about to happen had her heart hammering in her throat; an eager sense of anticipation.
Ron held his hands up in a helpless gesture. “You’ve seen how they look at each other! I feel like they’d fuck on Snape’s old desk if the mood took them!”
The two watched him walk away, before Draco pulled Harry back towards the door. They stepped outside into dying sunlight.
“And wake the beast? No, thank you.” She motioned towards where a mug of steaming tea sat under a stasis charm. “Cuppa?”
"Harry," Rita began with a sickly sweet tone of pity, putting her hand over his. "Is it possible he's lied to you? Given you a potion to trick you into being on his side?"
He plopped on to it, pulling her on top of him with a shriek. She laughed and tried to push him away but he just held on tighter. "I love you, Pans. I hope you know that." His words were muffled in her hair, and she squeezed him back. He let her go and she stood up, reaching down to ruffle his hair.
"Shhh my sweetling, all will be well." His mother shushed him as she stroked his hair. He should have cared that people could see him crying in his mother's arms, but he didn't.
Draco wanted to laugh, but this was the perfect opportunity to tell him. I'm dying. The words were on the tip of his tongue - but if he said them out loud, that would make them real.
"Potter. It's nearly curfew." Snape's drawling voice called out, and Harry turned to see him standing a few feet away. The professor's eyebrows drew together. "Are you alright?"
Harry hung up his coat and bag in the back room, before going and helping Paeson. She brought the cages into the back room, and then he carried them into the aviary. He opened the cage door, offering the owl a treat before it flew off. The next one flew inside, and Harry gave it a treat before shutting the door again. And so it went on and on, until all the cages were done. Each owl knew it’s cage, so it was a very smooth operation.
“You own.. This is your shop?” Harry stuttered, trying to wrap his head around the whole situation. He hadn’t seen Draco since they were all taking their NEWTs and that was nearing a year ago. He hadn’t changed much of course, except the shadows under his eyes were almost completely gone, and he looked like he had filled out more, or maybe he was just standing taller. His white-blond hair had grown a little longer, the soft waves pushed haf-hazardly behind his glasses to keep them out of his eyes. He seemed more confident, actually confident, not a fake cockiness - he seemed comfortable and at home in the shop.
Harry wanted to laugh. Whatever she thought she understood, it probably wasn't right.  "I'm very thankful that he could help me with this too. Malfoy has recently opened his own potion shop, Grotte aux Remèdes. I hope someone might hear my story and go there, and that they might find the help they need."
Harry didn't say he was sorry, because words like that were meaningless. Instead, he stood and slowly walked over to the other desk, where he laid a hand on Malfoy's shoulder.
Slowly, the whole room turned to see Draco stood by the door. His face was sad, and his gaze was focused on the floor.
Feeling an odd sort of déjà vu, and a shameful reminder of what happened in that bathroom five years ago, Harry drew his wand and warily stepped inside.
Suddenly, Memory Zabini had appeared beside Draco. The common room noise level rose significantly as everyone jeered at Zabini, who was by Draco in the present; at first he looked amused at his appearance, before a single, sharp tap from Draco made his face drain of colour. He no longer appeared to be enjoying the viewing.
You know that you have tiny scars across your face where the chandelier shattered, little shards of glass embedding themselves in your skin painfully. It had taken Mother hours to remove them all.
Draco took a deep breath and squared Harry with a look. "I'll live with you if you can get my wand back."
"What?" Harry exclaimed, louder than he'd meant to be. "Malfoy, I understand. Did you not listen to me just now? If you're too wrapped up in yourself to notice-"
"The forms that were needed to approve this law had been signed by you. Your signature was right on the line saying that you agreed with this policy and wanted it to be official." His voice had dropped to a whisper.
He supposed that the chaos of war had made him enjoy a quiet, organised life far more than he thought he would. He was fairly certain he wasn't OCD, though. He didn't hate it when he did something abnormal; he simply felt more comfortable in a routine.
and everyone else he lost. But then he thought of Hermione and the Weasleys and Neville and Luna and everyone he had now, and he couldn't imagine being without them or being without anyone. For the first time ever, Harry Potter realised all that he did have when met by someone who had none of that.
As the night progresses, you feel the distant hope that someone might speak to you start to fade away, until all that is left is a cold sadness inside. It makes your heart hurt a little. Even as a child, you knew how it felt to be lonely, because you hadn't met your friends yet and you have no siblings, so it had always been terribly lonely when your parents had to go out without you. Except this time, instead of simply being alone, you are surrounded by people and this time, it's that no one wants to speak to you.
Unfortunately, Kingsley was nodding along, writing something on the paper before him. Beside him, Malfoy narrowed his eyes and seemed a moment away from snarling. Harry saw his fists clench at his sides.
. He wanted to kiss those lips, and see if it was everything he had hoped it would be. Did he love Draco? It was far too soon to know that. Was he in love with Draco? He wasn't sure. But he definitely liked him.
"You can't just-" but Draco had already shut the door, leaving the kitchen and it's occupants behind.
Draco followed her gaze to the Gryffindor table. Potter had taken a seat beside Weasley and the moron trio seemed to be leaning in to have a hurried conversation. No doubt that idiot Weasel wanted to know what had been going on. Turning his attention to his own plate, he offered Pansy a lazy shrug. "I don't keep up to date on his financial standings," he commented dryly, "You'll have to ask him yourself."
"Clearly not all students otherwise I'd be in the dorms," Harry responded with some exasperation. He didn't really know how to explain it without going too far into information that he did not wish to share.
She took a moment to think about how to word her response. She may not be the most delicate of females, but even she could understand from where his question stemmed. "It's nothing based on prejudice," she started, frowning slightly. "We used to. There were trade networks and everything, but that was ages ago. The human world was young then, they hadn't quite developed the taste for bloodshed that they are rumored to have now. It's not really talked about anymore, merely stressed that our detachment from that world was detrimental to the survival of the Kingdom and our race." It had been a long time since Gwynn has sat through a history lesson and it was more difficult than she'd like to admit to remember all of the details. "There was pressure for weapons and magic greater than what the humans were producing. They'd wanted us to help them win a conflict and grew angry when we refused. Many of our liaisons to that world were slain because of it. After the killings continued over the course of a year, we withdrew completely, sealing our borders to any outside of this realm."
Despite Harry's best effort, he still remained relatively isolated and he wondered briefly if he would remain that way. He didn't like feeling like he was alone. Raising an eyebrow he turned and faced Ilaria. "Does this mean I'm not allowed to talk to anyone outside the castle?"
Across the table, Hendrik shared a look with his second. Neither one of them knew what to make of the sudden turn of events or the rapid personality shift. "Right," he muttered, shooting Soren a look that wished him the best of luck with the lunatic they'd all decided to crown. Soren for his part, returned the look with a calm smile. Unlike Lothair, he kept his amusement hidden.
"Mum just sent me an owl," he explained shoving it at her until she had to pull back in order to read it. "Says he's coming back and Malfoy's with him!"
Soren sighed, his eyes closing as he allowed his mind to run through the information and possibilities. There was truth to Lothair's words that he simply couldn't deny. Harry was nowhere near capable of handling a war and that was definitely Roland's goal. He wanted to see the Realm torn apart and that was the most sufficient way to go about it. "Ilaria," he finally replied, drawing her attention. Above all, he trusted her opinion on these matters. She wasn't the High Lady of the Southern Lands for nothing. Each one of them had their talents. He had his flair for internal and external political affairs. Lothair, while having a volatile temper, was a master of healing and magic. Ilaria's talents lay in war. Each of them sat at the top of their field and each had an opinion to be considered. "What do you suggest?"
to figure it out. Figuring it out meant facing the fact that Draco hadn't and likely wouldn't accept it. It was easier to leave it unnamed.
His thoughts shifted to the blond walking beside him, a slight frown marring his features. The blond had been acting weird all morning and Harry wasn't entirely sure how to handle it. He still had no idea why Draco had bothered to seek him out. He didn't believe it was because he was the closest or even that Draco felt that Harry owed him. Well, if he was honest, the blond probably did think that. That, at least, was in line with his personality. The fact that he'd sought him out, despite his voiced displeasure at having done so was not. In fact, it was the complete opposite. If Draco hadn't wanted to be within 100 feet of him, Harry was positive the blond would have moved heaven and earth to see that it happened. The manor was full of staff that would have relented under that self-righteous attitude of his and shown him whatever he'd wanted to see. Even in the Elven Realm gossip spread faster than anything. Harry wasn't going to believe that they didn't already know who or what Draco was.
Harry wasn't entirely sure what Dumbledore had planned for this meeting, but Lothair didn't seem to be all that interested in it and used it as a perfect opportunity to address his own desires. "I'm glad you summoned us, it makes it easier to ask you about our accommodations."
Lothair, it seemed, had the same idea a moment earlier because he got there before Draco did, immediately scanning the smaller Elf for any signs of injury. After a moment, he stood back up and shook his head. "And that's what happens when you build up too much elemental magic and release it too quickly."
He wasn't wrong. The place was a mess and it certainly wasn't set up to house anyone other than a giant killer snake, but he was pretty sure it was the most protected place in the castle. He recalled an earlier conversation with Soren about Hogwarts being alive with her own magic. "I thought maybe we could ask Hogwarts if we could use the place?"
Draco nearly choked on the bite of chicken he'd just taken, his eyes snapping to Pansy. He wasn't the only one either. Everyone within earshot of her had turned to look at her as though she had suddenly lost her mind.
"I don't plan to kill you, Draco," Lucius informed him, a maniacal gleam in his familiar grey eyes, "but you would be surprised as to what you can live through."
"You're showing me around, so get a move on it." Shoving Harry in front of him, Draco shot a dark look over his shoulder to the blinking Gwen they'd left in their sudden departure. There was just something about her that he didn't like.
There seemed to be a collective release of breath around the entire table. Harry hadn't even realized he'd been holding his breath until he'd felt the relief rush through him at Rosalind's news. It was short lived, however, when he realized that she was waiting for them all to take in the news. Her eyes met his briefly and he knew that it wouldn't be just that easy.
"Of course, but those are for those who haven't shown a preference for a weapon or in the case of a war and a need for quick armament. Since you're the most terrible shot I've ever witnessed, it would be a waste of money to have a bow made for you."
Soren hid a smile as Harry agreed to the situation. He had never doubted that the boy would make the right choice. He could tell that Rosalind was not pleased with the outcome, but she would come around in time. She was just worried for their safety and the development of the bond between the boys. But unlike Rosalind, Soren knew instinctively that there was more to this particular Wizard than met the eye. There was a sadness around him that Soren couldn't help but notice, even in his unconscious state. Harry's actions had only cemented the idea into his mind. This was what was meant to happen. The balance would be restored as it should have been and Harry would be one step closer to finally coming into himself.
Harry hadn't even noticed that Draco had already dressed for classes. Someone must have arranged for the uniform because this one fit the blonde perfectly. Given the change in his physical form, there would have been no way that the old set would have fit.
Harry doubted they would be able to sway each of them to their cause, but that was fine. Soren had explained that the decision did not have to be unanimous. In reality, they only needed to convince three of the five. Furthermore, if they could convince Aranel than his agreement had the potential to sway Ehlark to the same opinion. The third option was likely Kolvar. Originally, he had hoped to have Draco's help with that sell. Harry had little experience with the wealth of the Wizarding world. Nor did he know much about their imports and exports. As a Pureblood with a plethora of connections, Draco would have been the likely choice for tackling that front. As it stood, however, he wouldn't ask for his assistance.
Even if this particular Scout wanted to continue the report, he could no longer do such a thing once the firm grip of Roland's long fingers had secured themselves around the man's vocal cords, squeezing them until the last of his air was forced out of him. "I will not tolerate weakness," Roland hissed, flexing the muscles in his hand and allowing his elongated nails to sink into the flesh of the Elf's neck, blood dripping out from around the puncture wounds to paint a red trail over the pale skin exposed to Roland's mercy. "I will not tolerate incompetence."
"I just knew this had something to do with Voldemort!" Ron scowled, plopping down into the seat across from her. "They've probably brainwashed him into believing he's some bloody Elf Prince."
"You're out here playing house with her after ruining my life and you think it isn't fair?" Growling Draco took another swing, but this time Harry was ready for it and managed to shift out of the way.
There was no way Draco could possibly know what had happened. Not even Ehlark seemed to have noticed anything. Harry shook it off and focused his eyes back on Ehlark. It was harder the second time. Harry struggled without that rush of anger to breach the walls surrounding Ehlark's mind. After several long moments, he managed to get in. It was an odd sensation. He could still see through the other Elf's eyes but there was a murmuring swirling around him. Closing his eyes, he blocked out what he was seeing and focused on what he was hearing.
"Oh, Draco, darling, I remember you there. You were dashing!" Parkinson cried. "I do distinctly recall, however, that you were rather displeased at having to be my partner. You were always watching Pot-"
Harry knocked on the door with his free hand, the other carefully holding a wrapped-up gift, albeit a small, compact one. The door made the same creaking sound as it did before, especially when Draco opened it and almost reeled back at the sight of Harry. He looked even worse than he had before, with what seemed to be sleep deprivation joining the mix, but Harry had never seen anyone so beautiful.
Malfoy was gasping, short, panicked breaths, while he emitted a high, keening sound between breaths. His whole body was shuddering, and he looked as if he couldn't breathe. Sweat soaked his forehead, and Harry could see the dangerously fast pulse of his heartbeat in his neck.
Harry quickly cast a silencing charm on the office, so that no one overheard. He was completely out of his element. Fighting criminals with a mere stick of wood he could do, but comforting his old-school-rival-turned-office-partner? What the hell? This wasn't right. Malfoy wasn't supposed to have feelings, wasn't supposed to need comforting, particularly by Harry. Because if he did have feelings, then Harry was about to feel hella guilty.
"My father has never said he's proud of me or that he loves me and he even occasionally, though not often, hits me when I'm not good enough. He locks me in the dungeons when I'm really bad, and my mother just drinks her tea and watches. They make me write lines for hours on end until my hand is cramping and I can't write anymore, about Pureblood superiority. My reading list? Books about the uselessness of muggles, and blood status, and how to run a household and how to handle finances. Once you're told something enough times, you start to believe it, especially if it's all you've been taught. I didn't choose my parents or their beliefs, and I hate them... and yet, there's still a part of me that wants them to love me."
You sob harder, endless tears streaming down your cheeks. You wrap your arms around yourself, almost as if it is another person, and you stay there until the moon is high in the sky.
- and his eyes were glittering with menace and mirth. "What are you gonna do about it?" Memory Draco had seemed to unconsciously gravitate towards him, matching his intensity but retaining some fondness that spoke of how close they were.
But he is special. So, so special. You can see it in the way his green eyes are alight and the way his body moves to the music, so awkward yet so uncaring, and the way he tosses his head back when he laughs. You want to make him laugh like that, want him to look at you the way he looks at those he loves, like you mean something to him.
And it seemed that Malfoy had begun to trust him slightly, opening up more and more and becoming rather pleasant to converse with. He didn't speak much about personal life, though Harry knew better than to ask.
to possess considering that it was a Muggle invention, was tipped on its side, pens spread across a disarrayed pile of paper, and scattered across the floor. His clock, also Muggle, was a mere ten minutes out, though Harry knew how infuriating that could be. His immaculately pressed robes, which he always folded with care and draped over the back of his chair when he got to work, was crumpled on the floor. It struck Harry that Malfoy had no photos on his desk of anyone he loved.
Harry stood, anger thrumming in his chest, and prepared to leave when Dawlish's next words halted him completely.
To his surprise, Malfoy just rolled his eyes. Irritation sparked in Harry, not overcoming the guilt but rising to the surface faster than he was proud of. He felt the need to explain himself, to make Malfoy understand what he was talking about, to not dismiss him as he always had done.
He is so close to you, his expression so gentle and  his magic so soothing on your beaten skin that something inside you warms and your heart begins to beat with what feels like hope. It's been so long since you've felt it, you can't quite recognise it. At this proximity, his eyes are flecked with streaks of brown around the pupil, and his hair is shot with lighter brown strands, seeming almost golden in the pale light. His skin is smooth and unblemished, which surprises you, because he's been through the war like you, so how is he so untainted?
Things change very rapidly after that. Now, when they try to humiliate you and to hurt you, you don't let them; you smile carelessly and simply return to whatever it was you were doing. Their words can't hurt you anymore. Nothing can. You've been hurt, and that's okay. It's in the past.
Harry was shocked by the hostility in his tone. "Plight Palace? Why are you such a prat? No, I wouldn't do that. That would be wrong."
Harry marched into the building, head held high and determined. He was going to find Draco, drag him back to his much nicer flat and make him live there.
You've lost yourself, you know. What you are, what you've become... it's wrong, it's what you've been forced into. But how can you find the strength to be
said he'd help him, and yet so far, he'd remained silent. It was becoming more apparent to Harry that these things happened far more frequently to Malfoy than he'd ever known. This made him feel a strange sort of pity for the man who seemed to be so alone in the world.
But Malfoy didn't appear to notice his staring, and his next question caught Harry entirely off guard.
Draco looked around the highly decorated hall, as if afraid someone would see him. It really was quite unfortunate that Hermione had set the camera up there, as Draco was now stood for them all to see. They were in the far corner, tucked away and secluded. Harry assumed that the three of them had just skipped the Draco part when they'd watched it back, because he'd never seen this footage before.
Harry frowned, thrown. Draco had gone to Dumbledore already and he wasn't a Death Eater? Did this mean that they were on the same side? He wondered how scared Draco must have been to have thought that Dumbledore, a professor he hardly respected or believed in, was the safest option. Draco continued, cutting of Harry's confused thought process.
"Don't worry, Dawlish was suspended for two months for 'inappropriate, unprofessional and prejudiced comments towards a colleague'. Dawlish is a prat, so... he deserved it." Silence followed his words, and Harry glanced back over to see Malfoy with a peculiar expression on his face. He looked to be biting the inside of his mouth hard and his face was slowly gaining colour.
"Go ahead, I won't stop you." He chuckled, laughter fading again. "Perhaps you should even slice me open in a bathroom and permanently disfigure me and then never apologise instead. That rather sounds like something you'd do."
Harry had no idea what to say, or do. He was... horrified. And distressed at the sheer sadness and familiarity of what Malfoy was saying. He didn't want to, but he understood.
Malfoy just stared at him as if he were the dimmest person he knew. He raised his hands in an aggressive manner, despite the gesture itself being defensive.
Whatever. He couldn't think about that now. He began to knock on various doors, asking shamelessly if they'd seen a gorgeous blonde man recently, and if so, where. He did realise that this made him seem rather dodgy, but the only one to question him was an old woman who threatened to call the Aurors if he didn't explain himself. He hastily explained himself.
"You have no subtlety, Pans." Draco glared at her but removed the charm, grudgingly allowing her to put her arms around him. "And I'm sorry I didn't pay you any attention that night. You deserved more."
to have forged it. There was no way he would sign something that disgusting... except if he hadn't read it properly, or even at all. His mind flashed back to the day of Draco's panic attack and the form he had scrawled his name on unthinkingly, without reading.
One was thin, a stark white on his already pale face, curving around his left eyebrow and following the contour of his sharp cheekbone, pulling the eye outward ever so slightly. The second was raised and thicker, cutting though his mouth and twisting the lips unnaturally.
The day began just as Harry knew it would: grabbing coffee from the nearby cafe, passing Luna on his way to work, getting a biscuit from the office break room, before making his way to his office. The office that he shared with Malfoy. Unfortunately.
"...ought to be fired." Harry heard Dawlish chuckle, and he whipped his head back around to stare at the older man.
It was December 15th, 2001, and still there was no snow. It wasn't expected to snow, but Harry felt the disappointment, nonetheless.
"Harry..." Draco whispered into Harry's mouth, resting his forehead to the other's and opening his eyes to gaze into the green. Harry's mouth curved upwards as he smiled.
He realised that this was what Draco must have felt like since the war, when encountering those who used him as a scapegoat for all the suffering they'd endured.
"Hermione managed to rally public opinion against the new law, forcing the Ministry to abolish it mere months after it was introduced." Harry clarified. "She used you as an example mainly, as well as some others who had been getting their lives on track, and one woman who wasn't allowed healthcare when she needed it. Hermione made people realise what the law actually meant, and some people you helped as an Auror even came forward in your defence. That was pretty great." Harry smiled. "But this is the best part."
"Honestly, you can stop it now-" he began, but was shot down once again. Harry took pity on him and tried as well, but to no avail.
It turned out that Draco was sharply intelligent, witty and incredibly easy to talk to. Harry could barely reconcile this Draco with the hateful one he had known at school. Harry was finding that liked seeing Draco smile, liked his laugh and his hair and his face, and his
Draco's face lit up with hope and Harry was once more struck by how young he appeared here, like a small child who just wanted approval, or love. Draco turned once more, the lilies held higher in his grip-
"Oh my God, stop!" Malfoy's voice had risen in the mere space of seconds and some semblance of colour had flushed his cheeks. Harry fell silent. He was shocked by both the muggle exclamation and the sudden emotion in Malfoy's voice, which was sorely missing these days. "I know what you meant, Potter. I don't care. Just don't get all
Weaslette cackles when she sees what you're doing to him, and she gives your tips on how to torture him further.
Harry was so shocked that he could have fallen off his seat; all those years of hatred, and apparently it wasn't even true.
"Draco, Merlin. I... I'm so sorry. I didn't know you'd end up here in terrible place like this." No, that wasn't what he had wanted to say. He shook his head. "I've been looking for you since you left. We've all been looking for you, thinking something had happened, that you'd been hurt, or..."
He seems to want your attention though. You see him glancing at you surreptitiously, and then looking away when you notice. You see the way his eyes follow you across a room, and you see his reaction when you bite your lip and muss your hair on purpose. It's a good reaction.
Literally no one cares about me, which means no one visits me, which means my tiny flat gets quite lonely. Especially at Christmas. I haven't had a present in four years. People are supposed to see each other, eat nice food together and give each other stuff that no one really cares about but it matters all the same because it's proof that someone cares. I just want someone to care. About me. Not the Mark on my arm."
Still, she smiles and moves on. Dances with Longbottom, laughs with Weaslette, never sitting or speaking with you. You don't expect her to. She's far too pure for that.
You hum quietly along to the songs as they play. You watch as everyone lets go, the first real joy to be seen all year, ever since that accursed last year. You drink your drink silently. You smile at Lovegood when she smiles at you. She's perhaps the only one who is kind to you anymore, although you're not entirely sure why, given the way she was imprisoned in your house not too long ago. Well, perhaps she can see that you were as much a prisoner as she was.
Malfoy laughed humourlessly. "I don't have friends. I have followers. Crabbe and Goyle are literally payed by my father to be my bodyguards, Pansy only wants to marry me so that she'll be rich later in life, Nott wants me to promote him to higher society and Zabini literally asks for money because he's weird like that. The closest I have to friendship is Millicent, who smiles at me occasionally. When I went to the common room last week, Crabbe and Goyle laughed at my scars, while Pansy was disgusted and had a go at me for being 'inconsiderate'."
The astronomy tower was a picturesque place to stand at night, when everything in his head became too much to bear and he needed to be alone. The view was incredible, watching entirely over Hogwarts, all of its towers, turrets and features just there to be admired. Harry had always found the castle absolutely magnificent, which was precisely why he had come up here tonight. Hermione had been pestering him about that evil potions book he was in possession of, Ron was obviously stewing over his breakup with Lavender and being an oblivious idiot and Ginny kept twirling her air and batting her eyelids when Harry came close. Honestly.
"Absolutely." Harry confirmed. "Kingsley wants to personally apologise for that. You can have your same desk and position, and whatever else you want. Within reason, obviously." Harry grinned at him.
Harry didn't know whether to press further or to wallow in his guilt, but it seemed Malfoy had decided to answer his question after all. "Sometimes. Yeah, sometimes it gets lonely."
There's a silence again, this time broken by you furiously getting to your feet, feeling angry beyond words at this stupid, stupid, beautiful idiot, who's now looking up at you with wide, bemused eyes. How the hell are you supposed to be anything but subdued, when you're treated so badly? Is it not enough for you to feel humiliated when you think of all the tripe you used to spout because your
Draco nodded mutely, returning to his packing. It seemed as if there was nothing left but still, he kept going. It only took a few minutes to finish off, but Harry stood stock still for the entirety of the time, shaken to his core. When Draco was done, he picked the box up and moved from behind his desk.
Malfoy hadn't actually given Harry any trouble in the whole year they'd been sharing an office as Aurors. He was mostly quiet, subdued and content to get on with his work. That didn't mean that Harry liked him. Harry rather enjoyed antagonising Malfoy and was always disappointed when Malfoy didn't acknowledge his efforts. Call him childish, but he just wanted attention.
Harry's hands ran lightly across Draco's pale hair, their lips joined perfectly in a sweet kiss as they breathed one another in.
"But that's mental! You could have made plenty of other friends in other houses." It didn't make sense. If Malfoy was so lonely, surely he could stoop to the other house's level and try and bloody well make some more. It was too late now of course, but the option had been there once.
Finally, it becomes too much, and his eyes are still roving over you hungrily, and you watch him back, waiting and hoping- until one day, you snap, and you pull him forwards during a party, your hands clutching his shirt collar, and you press your lips to his, as passionate as you dare-
"Draco." He whispered, reaching out to take his hand for comfort, support, or whatever the hell he wanted to call it. But Draco flinched away as if his touch burned.
"Why?" Harry's voice dropped to match the volume of Draco's. He thought that he could hear his own heart pounding and wondered if Draco could as well.
He goes silent at that, and you can see him asking himself the same thing. There is a long pause between you, one you don't know whether to break, until he finally responds.
Harry actually thought he would be sick at the thought, and the guilt that followed and engulfed him.
He stared at the place where Harry had once sat alone, his body slumped, his face absolutely crushed.
"So where were you at the Yule Ball, Malfoy?" Ron asked, his face laid back as he watched the memories play back on the wall before them. In front of their eyes danced figures of elegant grace and vivid colour, girls giggling and boys red with embarrassment, but all enjoying the music. It had been Hermione's idea to watch back the Yule Ball from the footage in a Muggle camera she'd set up in the hall. She had thought it would enjoyable to see them all as they were four years ago, even if not all of them were here today.
So he decided to quit biting around the bush, and just go straight for it. "But, you did say all those things about muggles and blood status before. You still believe it." He almost wanted Malfoy to get angry, and hex him so that this weird, quieter Malfoy went away again. Malfoy deserved to attack Harry, and Harry deserved to take it.
He frowned. Maybe it was too soon for that. He didn't want to scare Draco off by rushing into things as he always did and confessing his sudden undying love to a man he wasn't even dating. He would settle for caring a good deal about Draco for now and go from there. That was better.
Harry didn't really know what to say that. How do you tell your rival who you almost killed that you're sorry? The reminder of what he'd done was fresh in his mind. He knew he was sorry, but the question was, would Malfoy believe him? "Oh...good."
Draco said nothing, but his eyes burned with furious mortification. Blaise barked out a laugh of surprise.
But to his surprise, Malfoy's face just cleared completely into an expression of tiredness as he rested his head back and closed his eyes. "Potter, stop." He didn't elaborate further.
"Malfoy. It's okay. Just breathe." he said, voice a steady volume and tempo. He decided against putting his hand on Malfoy's shoulder, thinking it would just freak him out further. Unfortunately, Malfoy was already freaked out.
up. I can't believe I ever felt bad about-" His remorse vanished in a torrent of fury. How could he have felt guilty for someone who still used prejudiced slurs? It served him right.
Malfoy was actually alright once you got over his past. He was surprisingly supportive, funny and just quite pleasant. Which was a word he would
Harry looked away from him then, not wanting to think about the anger this incurred in him, or the gratitude on Malfoy's face and the funny things it made him feel.
This time Malfoy properly laughed, tipping his head back and shutting his eyes. His shoulders shook.
And it became routine for Harry Malfoy-Potter to pull Draco Malfoy-Potter close to him as snow began to fall on Christmas Day.
No one made a sound as Harry got to his feet, slowly making his way to Draco by the door. Draco's head was now bowed, hair concealing his features. Harry approached him quietly and paused right in front of him.
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione squeezed his hand. “We won’t let him forget them, or the love they gave him. He will be loved by so many, have so many friends and family, and he will know his parents died for the sake of the good.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, knowing full well that Potter probably wouldn’t follow along. “Ashwinder egg, bezoar, bubotuber pus, ginger root, jobberknoll feather, lavender and powdered dragon’s claw.” He pretended to dust something off the counter, not wanting to spend too long looking into Potter’s stupidly gorgeous eyes. “Don’t worry, you can tell Mr Weasley that the latter was ethically sourced.” The older redhead’s name had cropped up in his search for the right ingredients, but he had decided it best to stay away from working with a Weasley so soon after the war.
“That’s the first time you’ve ever said that, Malfoy.” He came in close, enjoying the pink tinge in the Slytherin’s cheeks.
“Come on, Lucy.” Harry called, walking up the once-again grand staircase and into the living room. He drew back the curtains, letting the afternoon light pour in through the large windows, the dust dancing in the sunlight. He flopped onto the sofa, putting an arm over his face as his feline companion jumped onto his chest. It was only just past three and he already felt exhausted. And angry. He was always bloody angry; at least around Malfoy that was. The feeling was becoming so familiar to him that it was almost welcome.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Alright what is it? Have I got something on m-” He was interrupted as the two nodded to each other, their expressions morphing into slick smiles before striding towards him. Harry took a step back, sure that they were going to knock him over, but the two barely missed him, skirting around. When he looked back, the two young men were chatting to two of Fleur’s school friends.
Draco took off his apron, tucking his glasses into his breast pocket. Going to the back, he retrieved his jacket and scarf. Maybe his stomach was doing somersaults, and maybe his palms were slightly sweaty. And yes, maybe fifteen year old Draco was cheering in his head at the prospect of amicable alone time with Potter. But it didn’t matter, because they weren’t even friends. Yet.
“Are you really trying to get a child to pick favourites?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach as he watched Draco fawn over Teddy.
The words hung in the air between them, and Harry realised his mistake. Draco straightened in his chair, knuckles white around his mug as his face fell into a perfect mask of nonchalance; walls up. "Why would I spend time fretting over things like that? How does it help me now?"
Harry did a double take, squinting at the cat as he undid his scarf. It looked identical to Lucy, apart from it’s snowy fur being interrupted by a grey patch around it’s left eye. He could almost convince himself that Lucy had managed to get herself covered in dust, except for the fact that the cat was watching him with such boredom. Had it been his feline, she would surely have ran right over to him.
“Do an interview. With whom, I don’t mind. Offer your testament that coming to my shop helped you. Coming from you, business would really pick up.” Malfoy crossed his legs, reclining in a manner that Harry was soon learning was faux-nonchalance.
“Oh, excuse me for wanting a bit of peace and quiet from your yapping this year so I can focus on my NEWTs.” Draco replied with just as much venom.
"Careful, Potter. Someone might overhear and think you're flirting with me." Draco's pulse was echoing in his ears and it suddenly felt too hot. What in Merlin's name was going on? Maybe he was passed out drunk at home and simply dreaming.
Harry Potter could be his boyfriend. How long had he wanted this? Nine years? He could go on dates with Harry Potter. He would know how he took his tea, how his day at work was. He felt giddy.
The blond rolled his eyes, dismissing the paper into the bin. Was there really nothing better to be published? Who cared about bloody Potter and him doing fuck-all? Draco certainly didn’t. Or at least that’s what he repeated to himself as he pushed through the door to the stockroom. It was nearing nine months since he had finished his education, and he’d heard not a peep from the golden trio outside of his friend’s gossip. And that was how he liked it. Peaceful, no anxiety about past misdeeds (outside of his 24/7 inner turmoil), no awkward conversations. No bloody perfect, golden, pretty-boy Potter taking up any of his time, or any of his thoughts. Well, not as many of them anyway. No, he was past his school boy crush, and the petulant behaviour that he (without-meaning-to) brought with it. He would waste no more time thinking about someone who was no longer part of his life.
Harry sighed loudly, reaching down to grab Pigwidgeon from where he had been standing facing the wall, slowly walking into it, over and over again.
"Oh yes, the saviour of the wizarding world likes cock, isn't that a shocker." Potter’s voice was surprisingly tight.
Grimmauld Place was finally starting to feel more like home, but it still gave him the creeps. When he’d moved in he had magicked a door at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor, cutting the house in half. The once-grand house was huge, spanning six floors including the basement and attic, with seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, a library, formal dining room, drawing room, and more. In its hay day it would have hosted the most prestigious families of the wizarding world, welcoming them to dinner and parties. It was far too big with just him there, but by only using the first three floors and a new fluffy best friend, it was at least a little less daunting. The first floor had his own room, a bathroom, a spare room and what had once been the drawing room. Now the lounge and study combined, it had a big leather sofa and matching armchairs, a TV, far too many blankets and cat toys, a box of his godson's toys and books, as well as a desk and bookshelf stacked with all the books that couldn’t fit in Ron and Hermione’s flat.
Draco smiled at him, taking Harry's face in his hands, kissing his forehead, then his nose, then each cheek, then finally his lips. It was slow and tender, sweet and yet still needy. It was perfect.
“No, it’s quite uncommon. He wrote back in excitement about Draco, though. They got close in eighth year, did you know?”
Potter frowned and leaned forward to peck Draco on the lips. It was surprisingly gentle after what had just happened and Draco smiled. "I guess I've got to go."
Tonks looked at her glass, taking a sip of champagne. “I really admire your Father’s work, you know.” She said.
Malfoy visibly brightened, seemingly having only just noticed the Ravenclaw. He came around the counter to kiss her on the cheek. “Luna, ma chérie. What brings you here?” Harry tried not to snort at how much Malfoy sounded like a nosy housewife.
Draco snorted and pushed him away. He pulled his toiletry bag out of his suitcase and headed to the bathroom. "I'm just gonna freshen up."
Pansy waved dismissively as she took a gulp of her tea and walked into the fireplace. "Half an hour!"
“So feisty, mon Jolie garçon (pretty boy).” Draco murmured, narrowing his eyes at him. Bloody Potter, always so moody around him.
“I’ve made some new friends - that’s what you said. What about us? Why didn’t you mention that we were six months deep into a relationship?” Harry couldn’t keep the hurt from his voice, and he could slowly feel the anger creeping in as well.
He landed on his aunt’s doorstep, not daring to go back to the shop in case Potter followed him. He knocked quickly, and she answered not a moment later.
Pansy slowly pushed open the door, her other hand reaching to pull down her sunglasses. She peered around the cozy pub, searching for the full head of dirty blonde hair. She spotted it in the far right corner, and as she approached, Luna turned around and smiled broadly at the Slytherin. She was wearing bright orange robes and a pair of dazzling unicorn horn earrings.
The sound of raucous laughter drew Draco's attention to the furthest corner of the bar, where a group of young people sat squished into a booth, cheering and toasting. Squinting his eyes, Draco could make out the all-too-familiar mop of curls belonging to Harry Potter. And yes, next to him sat Weasley and Granger, and on his other side sat the younger Weasley and Luna. Dragging his eyes back to Potter, Draco felt his stomach flip in a way that certainly wasn't the alcohol. Potter had filled out since school, and his dark hair had grown out, slipping over his eyes every time he laughed too hard. He now sported a trimmed beard, and as much as Draco wanted to think he looked like a vagabond, he had to admit that he actually looked rather handsome, and far too sexy for his liking. His brown skin held a pleasant flush, and as Draco watched, he spilled a drop of his beer on his tatty blue t-shirt, earning him a playful punch from the younger Weasley. They exchanged smiles and Draco felt his heart tighten.
"Fuck off, Potter. I'm not in the mood for whatever your half-wit brain considers a joke." Draco's brain could barely keep up with the words that were spilling from his mouth. He rushed out the pub and into the cooler spring air. He needed space, he needed to be the fuck away from whatever had just happened. Draco could barely summon the self-control to not apparate drunk, and instead clumsily jogged to the next pub, and into their floo, giving his address.
“Tell that to the legions of women across the country.” Draco jokes, using his fingers to knead at the base of Harry’s neck. “I want to call you a silly git, because of how obviously and unbelievably fantastic you are. But I know it’s not your fault.” He pauses, whispering his next words like a secret. “It really is kind of rude how fantastic you are though, you should really think about sharing some of it with the rest of us.”
“Guys?” Harry asked, putting his hand on Luna’s arm gently. She didn’t move. “Tonks?” He waved his hand in front of her face. Still, she didn’t look at him, she barely even blinked. He could hear his blood rushing in his ears as pure panic threatened to suffocate him. “Hello?” He raised his voice over the music, searching for someone who can hear him. A scuffle behind him made him spin around, taking in the hobbled frame of Bathilda Bagshot.
"How's your day been?" Ron called, pulling out a chair for his fiancé before sitting himself down. He acciod a pint glass.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco nodded over to Pansy and Luna. “Pansy is a bad influence on the best of days.”  He looked behind him and Harry followed his gaze to a small stone archway on the edge of the party. “Come on, let’s get away from all this-" He gestured with his hand, "-shit.”
They moved through the crowd, followed by those endless whispers, and Draco spotted Pansy waiting at the bar with a smirk. "Good evening, gentlemen." She nudged their two abandoned drinks towards them, having obviously been watching their interaction with Balveer. "Quite a show you put on."
“Woah, I thought he became a recluse or something, You know, after he was so quiet in eighth year.” Ron added, shaking his head.
Pansy eyed him up, an eyebrow raised. “Merlin, when is it not?” She sighed, grabbing two wine glasses from the cabinet. She kicked her heels off, curling up on the sofa as she held out the glasses for Draco to pour the drinks. He had owled her half an hour ago, unable to stop replaying the day in his head. Pansy had been his best friend since he could remember, and their families had often holidayed in France together. She would be able to talk some sense into him, he was sure.
Draco picked Teddy up under the arms, holding him in front of him like a shield. “He’s got bloody black hair!” But as he said this, he watched with wide eyes as his hair turned silver. “Merlin’s tits!”
He turned round with a perfectly schooled air of haughtiness. "You almost sound like you've missed me, Potter."
The darker man huffed, scooping up some chocolate mousse for himself. Teddy whined loudly and he immediately offered him some. “I suppose you should come back to mine for a cuppa then.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. Lucius had been sent to Azkaban after the war, thanks in part to Harry’s testimony (amongst countless others). Clearly, though, Malfoy held no hard feelings about it, nor no warm feelings towards his father.
He mentally shook off the unneeded emotion, putting on his well-practiced professional tone. “Ah yes. I have to warn you, it will cost you quite a bit as the ingredients took a lot for me to acquire.”
“It doesn’t matter. I didn’t really fancy him anyway.” The blond took in Harry’s expression. “I was doing it as a favour to Pansy, that’s all Potter.”
Malfoy frowned, throwing Harry a dirty look. “Are you using one of my closest friends to manipulate me?”
“I’m surprised you haven’t seen him. He only really does his hair at the moment, and it usually changes to match the person he finds most interesting.” She hummed thoughtfully. “Let me go grab the tea.”
“Don’t even try it.” Harry smirked. “You can’t just throw water on The Saviour of The Wizarding World.”
“Yeah, but we agreed that it was probably just some horrid trick, remember? Ron and I threw eggs at him at dinner and got detention for a week.”
They were all having lunch in the Great Hall, chattering away, when Hermione caught sight of Harry and her face dropped. “What’s happened?”
He reached into the drawer to his right and pulled out a file, opening it up. "Your previous meeting was on the 15th May, and with today being the 24th, nine days have passed." He closed the file and frowned further. "You have our deepest apologies, Mr Malfoy."
“In your dreams.” Pansy scoffed, placing her own empty glass on the coffee table. “I’m going to grab some parchment. Top me up too.”
The Gryffindor was sound asleep, or so Draco thought. Just as he was about to retreat, the other man let out a loud breath, followed by a word: “Draco.”
“I’m meeting Mcgonagall for a tour.” Malfoy wasn’t quite meeting his eyes. He looked good, his hair falling softly over his forehead, no longer slicked back. He was dressed in an all black suit, one hand tucked into his trouser pocket. He looked handsome and confident… except for his other hand, which was tensing and untensing over and over again.
He was proud of Draco as well. He’d only seen a snapshot of what he was going through, but Harry was still in awe of his strength.
He ignored the feeling, not wanting to embarrass himself further by revealing his feelings to the other man.
The bodies of his friends lay in the dust and rubble of Hogwarts, lifeless, as Harry looked desperately for his wand, any wand. A loud hissing made him look up, and there was Nagini slithering towards him, baring its fangs. He stepped backwards, and as soon as his foot hit the ground, Hermione’s screams started. The smartest, bravest witch he knew, was crying, begging for help as Bellatrix sent Crucio after Crucio at her. And as Nagini got closer, Harry’s own death imminent, Ron started shouting.
"Yeah, no, really stressed." Ron frowned at his glass. "Be thankful you didn't become an Auror, Harry. Far too much bloody paperwork."
Swooning didn't happen in real life did it? Draco was sure he was about to find out. He cleared his throat and settled a smirk on his face, slowly raking his eyes up and down Potter. He was wearing black denim shorts and trainers, and a red shirt that said "melanin king".
It made her want to laugh, seeing such a monster struggle so. Perhaps he was suffering from guilt for the pain he had caused.
"And you’re a prick who is so used to having people brown nosing him that he can’t stand someone who refuses to!” Malfoy stepped forwards, squaring his shoulders as he seethed.
The question was peculiar, coming from a man who hated Harry’s guts. But there Harry stood, panting, probably looking as frazzled as he felt.
Draco's chest tightened as he thought about how that would never happen, but shook his head to clear his thoughts. He had to focus on the now. Shit, he really should have taken his pills.
“What lies? We both know what I did." Draco sneered. "We both know what a huge fucking cock I am.” His voice broke, his eyes cast to the ground as his shame crashed down around him.
“Absolument pas (absolutely not)! You’re so good with him, Draco. Although your language could use a bit of work." She looked at him pointedly. He smiled bashfully.
"Then you shouldn't have!" Draco pushed him with just as much force, their argument growing more aggressive. This time, Potter slipped, falling backwards. He grasped at Malfoy's cuffs in desperation, his eyes wide with panic, but all he managed to do was bring him down with him, the two taking down a tower of boxes as they went. The paler man landed on him  with a grunt as a flurry of paper cascaded around them.
“I know you won’t believe me, but it really isn’t your fault. No one could have done better.” Draco said quietly, firmly.
Lucy followed him diligently as he took the next flight of stairs down to the basement and into the kitchen. He put his coat and shoes down on the table before grabbing a pouch of food from under the sink. He squeezed the contents into Lucy’s bowl and then filled up her water bowl as the kettle whistled on the stove. He kept her bowls at the head of the dining table (though still on the floor), the small gesture making him smile every time he realised. Maybe he wasn’t ready for kids, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t spoil his little girl.
"Potter?" Draco asked, surprised. "What..?" He leaned down to move the cloak away and Harry’s eyes lingered on his chest only a few inches away. He got a whiff of his scent, all apples and chocolate and mint and something familiar that he now knew was all Draco. {-oh-}. The slytherin lifted the cloak in his hand, inspecting it, unaware of Harry’s racing heart. "Is this an invisibility cloak?"
As he began his tale of post-war sorrow, my heart bled for him, so burdened with stardom and grief. What should have been a period of freedom and bachelorhood for our handsome young star was laden with pain and suffering. He poured his heart out to me for some time, and once his shoulders had been lightened, he further confided in me his newfound solution.
Barely a minute later, Kreacher’s voice called out again. "Master, Mr Malfoy is being quite insistent-"
Harry rubbed his palms on his jeans, glancing at the door again. Why did he have to come so early? He hadn’t felt this anxious in a long time, and the wait certainly wasn’t helping. Suddenly, a flash of white hair caught his eye.
“You’ve changed.” Harry held his gaze as he walked slowly forwards. “You didn’t give me empty apologies, you tried to do better. You are doing better.”
“Well,” Malfoy’s voice caught and he cleared his throat. “I suppose I wanted to apologise, for the, um, letter.” He looked down, finally conceding his nervousness.
It was strange, seeing Draco in his ‘natural’ environment. He was dressed in smart grey trousers, his white button up untucked was perfectly styled to look casual-but-not-too-casual. He almost oozed cockiness, completely in the role of rich, upper class, white boy. It made Harry’s body react in a way that he was somehow familiar with, though in the strangeness of the moment, he couldn’t quite place it.
"How have you been keeping? Apart from your nightmares getting better?" Malfoy started, trying to work out how to talk like a normal person, when in fact he was sitting across from his former enemy, which was anything but a normal encounter.
Draco gave a small smile again, as if embarrassed, and Harry found he liked the unfamilair look on him. “I actually frequent muggle bars these days, if you can believe it.”
Harry slowly raised his head and met the sight of the Slytherin’s knees. Since when had he got so close? He craned his head up to look at the blond’s face. Then Malfoy did the strangest thing, and that was saying something after the past few weeks. He crouched down to Harry’s level, taking in his features with a frown.
“It certainly will, as will the next one.” He drawled. How long could he put off talking to Balveer? Unless he found somewhere to hide, the answer was ‘not as long as he’d like’ - and Malfoys didn’t hide.
“You Gryffindors, you’re so quick to anger.” Draco said, pulling off his gloves. Now he was here, he was more nervous than he thought he’d be. Granted, he was apologising more often these days than he had ever done in his life before, but it didn't make it any easier.
Harry ran his hand through his hair, only messing up his curls further. “So do you. I’ve never seen you look so-”
The club was lavish: chandeliers and sofas, draping fabrics and secluded booths, all topped off with neon lights and thumping music. Pansy sashayed her way into one of the seating areas and sat down, waving to a waitress. "Four shots of firewhisky please and…" she looked around at the other witches and wizards and pointed to a large pitcher of glowing liquid with smoke coming off it, "two of whatever they're having."
“Merlin, mate. That’s one messed up owl.” Ron said, shaking his head as he held out his arm for Pig. He was referring to Alfie for once, who was sitting rather happily on his perch just a few feet away, seemingly unaware of the effect his magic was having.
There was one bird that never went to the front of the shop. Alfie was a middle-aged barn owl, with a friendly nature, but his magic didn’t quite work. Pearson had told Harry of how he had been one of her first hatchlings when she inherited the shop, and how she had grown fond of him. And so, Alfie was the resident VIP.
Potter looked like he was about to say something but changed his mind. He unscrewed the lid and dipped a finger in. Draco undid his own shorts and pushed them and his boxers to the floor, kicking them off. He took his cock in his hand and stroked it languidly, watching carefully as Potter spread his legs and traced the puckered point.
“No, uh-” Draco cleared his throat. “It’s okay.” He brushed his hands through his hair, gesturing for Harry to come over to the counter. “It really worked?”
“All right.” Potter pulled a leather pouch from his pocket and Draco stood, holding up a finger to signal that he would only be a minute.
“Well, we can’t back out now! Let’s just get it over with.” Potter took his hand, and Draco lost all sense. His whole body felt like it was on fire. Ignoring the fact that his insanely hot crush was now holding his hand, he was about to go dance with him!
Draco sighed, turning over for what felt like the hundredth time. He couldn’t sleep, his slowly-sobering brain racing around the memory of their kiss. He’d left his school-boy crush behind him long ago, content with their friendship. But all his resolve had come crashing down the moment Harry’s lips touched his. How long had he yearned for this? To finally know what the darker man tasted like, how he felt pressed against him? He groaned into the pillow, his eyes flicking up to the clock on the wall. It was just past 4 in the morning. The kiss had probably meant absolutely nothing to Harry, just another drunken adventure. What was he talking about - probably? He was sure of it.
"You're being ridiculous, Malfoy. Just sit back down. Your sandwich will be here soon." Harry reached out to grab at his sleeve, but Malfoy pulled out of his grasp, marching past him. He cursed, grabbing his own coat to follow the Slytherin back out of the cafe. "For fuck's sake, Malfoy!" Why couldn’t they just talk?
Draco looked down at their joined hands, his heart fluttering. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose-”
Draco grabbed Potter's hand and pulled himself onto the broom behind him, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist. He was going to live.
Pansy made a choking sound beside him, and he turned to see her staring down someone across the room. He followed her gaze, nearly choking himself.
“Potter, I said it was fine.” He took Harry’s hand off of his arm and squeezed it. “This is a much better alternative.”
Draco leaned in close, taking Potter's hand and giving into the absurdity of the situation and the butterflies in his stomach. "Let me lead." He said lowly in his ear. The brunette nodded with a shiver, and Draco placed his hand on his hip.
Draco apparated away, his blood boiling. His emotions were everywhere, and he felt like Potter had just confronted him with every single one of them. Of course he regretted everything he had done, and of course he wanted to be friends. He had spent so much of his time over the past few years thinking about the golden boy, but with every mistake he made, every cruel and jealous word muttered, he sunk deeper into the quicksand of his own demise. By the time he had reached his limit, had wanted to change, wanted to set things right, Voldemort had returned; and he had to choose between his family or doing the right thing. Maybe his choices made him a coward, but he couldn’t change it now.
“That won’t be needed, Potter.” Draco cleared his throat, looking Harry in the eyes, trying and failing to quash the waves of anxiety in his stomach. He had something to ask.  "However, I would be immensely grateful if you would do me a favour.”
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at him, but couldn’t stop the blush in his cheeks and the butterflies in his stomach. He patted the space beside him and the darker boy sat down, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. They had the common room to themselves, with the rest of the eighth years either in DADA class or the library studying for NEWTs. Harry didn’t have to attend the class, with assurances from McGonagall that he would receive the qualification in full without the need for exams. Draco had opted out of DADA, focusing instead on potions, herbology and alchemy.
She wasn't a perfect woman. She was snobbish and racist, she supported her tyrannical husband in all his efforts. But she was a good mother, and had a kind heart to those she showed it to.
“Don’t you remember last year when he apologised to me?” The Slytherin had caught Hermione outside of class one day and quietly apologised for calling her a mudblood. Before she could respond, he had walked away like nothing had happened.
Fred and George stood just to the right of him, talking in low whispers. The glanced at him and then quickly away, whispering more fervently.
“They have bad nightmares. They started taking this new potion recently, and now they don’t have them anymore.” Luna’s voice drew Harry’s attention back to her.
"I'm… I'm… sorry." Draco's voice was cut off with a gurgling noise as more blood poured from his mouth.
Harry held his hands up in surrender. “Just checking.” He glanced at his watch. “Am I alright to leave you here? I need to check what time I have Teddy on Tuesday, and Andy should be finishing up with dinner now.”
"Oh, Merlin...I…" He trailed off, running his hand through his hair as he stared at Harry, his pink cheeks illuminated by the street light.
Pansy hooked her arm through his and winked up at him. "Come on gorgeous, let's show the world what they're missing."
As he made his way back around the counter, he ghosted his fingers over the wooden top, around the till, smiling at Sylvia as she watched them curiously. He danced them over to her, tickling her under the chin as she tried to swipe at him. “Are we going to have a good day today? Hmm?” He whispered to her. She closed her eyes and began purring. “I hope so too.”
“Oh, as if you wouldn’t be pleased if he had a full head of black curls right now.” Malfoy replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
His brave face lasted all of the sixty seconds it took for Potter to arrive and let him in, before he was struggling with the clasp of his cloak, struggling to breathe.
“Today we weren’t fighting. For the first time, since this whole reunion thing. Or at least, this afternoon, we weren’t.” He paused, taking another sip of his wine. “But this morning we were, and we always do. And it’s always at least half my fault, if not more. I antagonise him, stuck on this schoolboy fantasy of passion.” He looked away, feeling ashamed. “He just makes me feel so many things, and I don’t know what to do with them all. Then I end up lashing out.”
"It's called snorkeling, sweetheart. Wizards don't use muggle technology -it's far too dangerous." She tucked a stray piece of silver hair behind his ear.
He cleared his throat awkwardly as he tried to settle his nerves. "Sorry about last night, Potter." His voice came out much more timid than he intended and he frowned slightly.
He followed Potter to the dance floor just as the faster waltz turned into a slow dance. At least they couldn't mess this up?
Draco walked ahead, his hair illuminated by the sun. He almost looked like an angel. Harry laughed, his heart warm at the way the day had gone, breathing in the grass and sunshine, the flowers and the breeze, the few sips of champagne sitting warmly in his stomach. “I don’t know why they couldn’t have just told us.”
"Why does everything have to be a drama with you?” Harry balled his hands into fists, nearly shaking with the urge to go up to the other man and shake him, or better yet, slap him round the face. “Surely you don't need anymore attention, you got enough of that when you were younger, tugging at Daddy's sleeve constantly." Harry bit back, letting his anger take control of his words. It felt good to do this again, to argue. This was the strongest, rawrest emotion he’d felt in fuck knows how long.
Potter looked at him quizzically. “Hmm? Oh, you mean Charlie.” He nodded to himself but his eyebrows were still drawn together. “How does it work?”
Draco pulled a bottle of merlot from the wine cooler, sweeping into the room with a frown. “It’s Potter.”
He topped up his tea with a splash of milk. “Remember to let Lucy out if she’s pacing by the back door.” Sadly, he couldn’t charm the back door to allow her free access, the dangers of fame far too real to breach the wards that way.
The gryffindor bristled, shooting him an annoyed look. “Don’t start with that, Malfoy. Just let me say my piece.” Draco held his hands up in surrender. “The owl’s magic has gone all loopy, and has been affecting other nearby owls’ ability to fly. I was wondering if perhaps a potion could help, as even Hagrid doesn’t know what to do.”
He could feel a slight thrum in his veins and had to fight the urge to hum a song to himself. Just lovely, he thought. Perhaps he should spend the next two months drunk.
"Fuck, Malfoy, is that… is that what I did to you?" his voice cracked a little. That night in the bathroom, Potter had scarred him for life, literally. Draco felt no anger about it, he could still remember the horror on Potter's face as Draco fell to the floor in a pool of his own blood. He hadn't meant it, he knew that.
“Malfoy?” Harry furrowed his brows, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy in a heavily stained apron, standing behind the counter as he dropped several coins from his hand into the till. He could see that he was wearing a grey button up shirt and trousers with his sleeves rolled up. Malfoy looked relaxed, strands of his white blond hair slipping from around his glasses to frame his face.
Maybe they do have similarities, Draco thinks and smiles brightly. "That will be perfect, thank you."
Draco hummed to himself as he began about making his coffee, accioing the morning newspaper and levitating it just in front of him. There wasn’t much new; a supposed sighting of a Norwegian Ridgeback - and two further pages discussing the ethicalities of Dragon rearing, an interview with the Weird Sisters about their upcoming tour, no less than seven pages detailing the upcoming quidditch season, a gossip column about Kingsley Shacklebolt’s ‘DILF’ status, and not surprisingly - a dredged out speculative piece about everyone’s favourite Golden Boy; Harry Potter.
Harry took a deep breath, taking a large swig of his tea as if it could give him the same willpower as something stronger. He'd faced worse than a gossiping, middle-aged witch. "After the war, like many people, I suffered from long term after-effects." He started, taking another breath.
Harry turned around to see the two of them sharing a look he couldn't quite work out. "Please don't start this again. I told you; he's changed."
“That’s great, Harry.” Draco smiled genuinely, before his gaze fell over Harry’s shoulder. “I’ll come over later to see how he is, okay?” Draco flicked his eyes just over Harry’s shoulder.
“I did mean what I said a few months ago. Just give me the word and I’ll lock those bastards up in that bloody cupboard to starve to death.” Draco tries to keep his voice light and joking, but the anger flares in his stomach, images of Vernon Dursley writhing in pain flashing through his head.
“Any particular reason?” Harry looked at Draco blankly. “For naming your snake after me.” He elaborated.
“And leave you here all alone? You could have been rummaging through my underwear.” Potter smirked, throwing himself down next to him.
“Merde! (shit!)” The slytherin pulled away. “I can’t do this. I really can’t bloody do this.” He muttered, rubbing his head as he stood up. Bloody Saint Potter, calling him by his first name. It was like he’d just taken all of his emotions and shoved them into a muggle blender. Draco’s head spun, reeling with the anxiety of the day and his stupid boy-ish fantasies of a man he could never have.
“Well, whatever it was. I hope the scotch helps.” Potter chuckled and Draco found himself giving in to a small smile.
Hermione giggled at the picture that her boyfriend’s wild gestures created. They turned the corner to find the subjects of their conversation pressed against the wall to their left, lips crashing together as their hands crept under each other’s robes.
"I can do this. Blaise is right. I don't him to hate me." His voice could be heard even as he turned away from the camera.
"I mean," he continues, sensing your confusion. "that you're not the same anymore, and I... I don't like it. I mean, I'm glad you're not calling people 'Mudblood' anymore and bullying me and the first years, but... you're not supposed to be so- subdued. It's just wrong."
Suddenly, Lavender Brown gasped and pointed frantically at the screen. "Look! Harry's on his own! The Chosen One was ditched by his partner! Merlin, if
Harry knew the feeling, as these words sparked images of Sirius and Fred and Dobby and Remus and Tonks and his
voice said into the common room and Harry realised that he'd moved away towards the door, one pale hand resting on the handle as if ready to flee.
Harry's eyes widened at the blatant show of self-deprecation. Why would Malfoy tell him that? And surely Malfoy was surrounded by friends. Parkinson had probably been in there every day, kissing him all better and sobbing in that dramatic way of hers. Harry frowned at the thought of Malfoy kissing someone else.
Completely fabricated, Harry knew. But points for his creativity. He'd clearly had minimal time to think of an alibi.
It wasn't for lack of trying. He had gone to Draco's flat countless times and had been turned away by the neighbours who had insisted that Draco didn't want to see him. The last time he had gone, the landlord had told him that Draco had moved out. Apparently, he'd been unable to afford it as he couldn't pay his rent anymore.
His gaze was fixed on the ropy block of flats before him. It was the only building that could be a flat, as the rest were shops or small business firms. The flats really were ugly and in awful condition. There was graffiti everywhere, cracked windows, peeling paint, and scarily precarious looking walls.
Harry just stared at him, before it dawned on him that he should respond in some way, so he nodded rapidly. And this prior realisation caused another realisation, which was that he should try to appear calmer. If he was calm, then hopefully Malfoy would follow.
Dawlish gave Kingsley and Harry an honest looking smile, as well as a nod. "Well, Sir, I'm afraid it was all a complete accident." he began, sounding so genuine that Harry had to catch himself, "One of my recent assignments resulted in me taking a criminal into custody, and unfortunately he tried to escape while on the fourth floor. He ran into Malfoy's office and I was forced to use violence as a means to detain him, resulting in the mess."
Desperate tears prickled in his eyes, and to his horror, they were dangerously close to falling. He hadn't known it was possible to feel more guilty than he already had, even after threatening to punch the boy he'd almost murdered.
Those utterly vile human beings. Those pathetic excuses for people. Laughing at someone's scars, or hating them because of them...
There was no one close to Malfoy who he could contact; his parents were dead, and his friends were either also dead or in Azkaban.
Honestly, the last person Harry expected to see on his nightly wandering was Malfoy. But here they were.
Harry did all of this as routinely as he always did, even doing his routine tap on his hat as he passed the Weasley shop. He wasn't sure why he always did it; it gave him a sense of normalcy, he supposed, as if he were in control of what he did. It wasn't that he was into Trelawney's whole idea of fate and lucky signs and whatnot, but he just liked it. He could stop if he wanted. He could take a different route to work and not see Luna, he could go to another cafe, and he could firmly keep his hands by his side to keep himself from tapping his hat.
But then he lurched back into gasping again. Harry threw his conscience out the window and just leaned forward and grabbed Malfoy's hand, pulling it to his chest tightly. The other man shot him a frantic look but did nothing to pull away.
You wish you hadn’t returned. There is no place for you here anymore. All happiness and life has been sucked from the old building, and you fear that it shall never return. No one wants you here; all of your friends are dead, so who would sit with you at lunch?
"It was Dawlish." He said. "I saw him leaving the office this morning just as I arrived, but he left before I could do anything."
Zabini, to Harry's surprise, laid a hand on Draco's shoulder. "But don't you see? He hates you already. And if you don't
Harry frowned, attempting to clear the confusion from his brain. "But what about all the Slytherins, who you're always with? Your friends?"
They were sat in the eight year common room, shared by all houses, and right at the start of the year they'd decided to all bury their differences and work together to create a happier environment. After a few fights that mostly removed the animosity, the plan had worked surprisingly well and Harry had found himself with more friends than he'd had at the start of the year, including
, one I only woke up from a week ago?" His grey eyes gleamed hard and silver in the darkness, the breeze whistling through his pale hair menacingly.
Harry realised that he'd been gaping in horror at the Slytherin and smoothed his expression down in a way that Draco used to do. He hoped it was convincing, though he never had been very good at acting.
He felt his face drain of colour, one hand rising jerkily and waving at Malfoy as if that would take back what he said. "Uh- I mean, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry-"
Harry just stared. The words felt like a slap to the face and the insult wasn't even directed at him. It just didn't sit right with him that people felt it was okay to call others scum. He didn't care that Kingsley looked about to say something, perhaps to admonish Dawlish, or restrain Harry.
He shut the door behind him and was shocked to see both his and Malfoy's desk empty. But the sound of crying only grew. Well, perhaps crying wasn't the word- it was more like gasping. Harry glances around, so intent on finding Malfoy that he managed to completely miss what was right in front of him.
Harry was beginning to suspect that Parkinson was a bit drunk; so was Draco, because he laughed and the uncomfortable expression evaporated.
Malfoy remained facing away from him. "Not really. No one visited me anyway, so it's not like I was missed or anything."
. And Lucius Malfoy, that- that evil son of a... paying for his son to have bodyguards. And not even friends. That was just
is why." He said it like a statement, rather than a question. "Merlin, all it takes is one second of loneliness and you're ready to throw everything away and sweep in like the knight in shining armour!"
Draco inhaled shakily, tears now freely spilling down his face as he turned away in anguish. The sight broke Harry's heart.
Zabini began to move towards him, looking saddened, but then the image had disappeared and the group were left staring at a blank wall in shocked silence.
You feel as if you've been living in the dark, unable to see, and now you catch a glimpse of a light, as if you're seeing yourself for the first time and you've accepted who you are.
"No, actually, I think living here has been positive because there not a thing I can do about the instability and everything. Although I make sure that I keep everything I can organised."
Harry thought to himself, mostly as a distraction from his remorse. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the Saviour. Yeah, he had no clue what
Hermione, rather uncharacteristically, giggled at him and seemed to be quite taken with the curls she'd charmed in her hair and the lovely dress she'd been wearing. Harry had no doubt that he'd be seeing those curls again in the near future.
"What- what are you doing?" he choked out. The thought of Draco leaving terrified him a hell of a lot more than he was prepared for.
"I was there. Just in the background. Not all of us are Chosen, you know." Malfoy drawled from behind Harry, in the midst of the cosy group that had formed. Harry snorted; Chosen One comments no longer irked him, particularly when said so frankly. But when he turned round to look at Malfoy, he saw that the Slytherin's face was uncomfortable, eyes cast down and hands fidgeting. "You know, we really don't need to watch this-"
Behind them, the other members of the room were smiling, a single tear falling down Pansy's cheek, echoed in the way Zabini breathed out a small laugh.
Harry went to work each day, and each day he glanced over the empty desk as if the sheer force of his gaze would materialise Draco.
he judge you for being subdued? When he's the one who doesn't stand up for you, who leaves you to be beaten up? Some Saviour he is.
The flowers took a moment to become distinct, beginning as a vague, soft hue of light that slowly took form and solidified into-
It had been hard to even look himself in the mirror without shuddering in disgust. He couldn't bring himself to check the Slytherin table for Malfoy's return, too afraid the Slytherin would walk in and be scarred beyond recognition. He'd nearly
Granger is by no means one who cries often, but you manage to bring that side of her out. Apparently, nothing gets to her more than building new bridges and equality. Although, you do think she should have left S.P.E.W tucked away in the corners of her mind, because you know with a shadow of a doubt that it won't succeed. She doesn't understand that house elves enjoy serving their masters, if treated fairly, but you remain silent. Instead, you keep your opinion to yourself.
You look down at him, and your smile widens. You tell him that his hair looks nice today and that you'll see him around. You feel only satisfaction when he gapes after you.
"My parents don't love me. They just want me to be a Death Eater, which I don't want, which is why I refused the Mark over summer. I was crying in the bathroom that day because they sent me a rather nasty letter about what a disappointment I am and threatened to disown me. They obviously hadn't heard that I'd already gone to Dumbledore for protection already."
The Golden Trio seem to watch their friends becoming your friends and realise that you must be different, because Granger approaches you in the library soon, and asks for you to be her partner in Transfigurations. She's rather hard to crack but you don't mind if she needs to take her time. You would, in her place. Once she's thawed, she's lovely. You even offer to help return her parent's memories to her, which makes her cry with happiness, and hug you so tight you think you might crack a rib. You give her a potion that can remove her 'Mudblood' scar if applied regularly, to which she cries
someone.He'd nearly obliterated someone from existence in a brief moment of anger. Malfoy, gone forever. No Malfoy. No one to tease or insult or stare at when he's not looking.
then he always will and then there'll be nothing you can do. And besides, even if everyone else hates you, you'll always have me and Pansy." He grinned as Draco stared at him, stunned.
"Malfoy?" he said, gingerly crouching down in front of the man. Malfoy didn't acknowledge his presence, and probably wasn't aware of his presence. He just kept hyperventilating.
"You don't understand. You don't." He sighed. "You weren't famous for your name; you were famous for what you'd done. Your name became known as a result of that. The name 'Potter' is not why people like you. You have hundreds of people who love you for you in this school. You have Weasel, Granger, Longbottom, Lovegood, more Weasels and Weaselettes and so many other close friends who love you."
Dawlish laughed but his eyes were confused. "Come on Harry. Yesterday you were bemoaning having to share an office with him and now you're singing his praises? Please. You don't have to defend him just because Kingsley's here. We all know he's scum."
Nothing I can say or do will make up for this, but you have to believe me when I say that I didn't know what I was signing! I would
He looked physically worse than he had been, but what struck Harry the most was how tired he appeared, judging by the purple bags beneath his eyes.
Draco barely spared him a glance, his eyes bloodshot and tired, as if he hadn't slept at all last night and had cried instead. His gaze was distant and desolate, the familiar emptiness returning. He continued to quietly pack his possessions tidily into the box in that meticulous way of his.
"When you have the Chosen One not wanting to be friends with you, and everyone on his side, you don't really have many options." He sounded matter-of-fact. "Besides, my father wouldn't want me seen with any of them anyway. He'd say it would ruin the Malfoy image if I was seen with Muggle-loving Blood Traitors."
Grabbing coffee from the nearby cafe, passing Luna on his way to work, getting a biscuit from the office break room, before making his way to his office. Over the past two months, Harry had grown accustomed to meeting Draco and giving him his coffee in their office.
wasn't enough for Parvati, I think she'll be forever disappointed." Parvati flushed, but grinned. Harry, who was still watching Draco, saw the unease spark again as the other boy cast his gaze to the images again.
"Maybe. And anyway, it'll be okay either way." Harry had never heard such support from Zabini; his heart rate began to quicken for some strange reason as he watched the scene. The common room was now completely silent.
Draco lived here, in this dump. Draco was on the other side of this door. Draco was close to him... Harry could have screamed at the nervous tension this brought.
He doesn't come over to you, even though you know he knows you're there. You wish that Pansy were here, or Blaise, or even Crabbe and Goyle. They'd make this fun. They'd talk to you.
Draco was stood by his desk, one hand pressed to his mouth and the other efficiently picking up everything on his desk and placing them in a box. His half of the room was sparse, everything stripped bare of Draco's belongings. The timetable was gone, his papers were stacked in the box and his Auror robes were nowhere to be seen.
Instead, you cowered in the corner and cried. You used your wand on countless innocents and made them scream in agony, all because a madman threatened you. You cried alone because you couldn't fix a cupboard and you couldn't kill an old man and you couldn't do anything. And now you know how it feels to be shunned, and hated, the way you used to hate others.
That was harsh, Harry thought, as he winced. He waited for Malfoy to explode into a fiery pool of rage but was sorely disappointed when Malfoy only stared for a few moments, before rising and striding from the room. He looked oddly resigned, as if he were used to such treatment.
After that, he seems to watch you more, as if he can't quite take his eyes off you, and can't quite discern you. You feel as if you're a mystery that he is trying to understand. You don't mind because at least someone is paying attention to you now.
"It's okay. You don't have to tell me this." he said quietly. He didn't like seeing Malfoy cry. He'd seen too many people crying in his life. Ginny cried loudly and Hermione cried with deep, shuddering breaths and Ron cried with gruff sobs that he always tried to stop. But Malfoy did none of these things (except if he was having a panic attack). He just sat still and quiet, tears silently trickling down his cheeks.
Malfoy was watching him curiously, evidently bemused by the reaction to his words. He had clearly not been expecting such righteous fury.
"No. You helped me before, so I owe you an answer. Besides, if I don't talk to someone, I'll probably go mad. At school, I had friends. Lots of friends I hardly knew and a few friends who meant the world to me. They're dead now, or in Azkaban. But, although they loved me, they never understood. They never understood my aversion to chaos and the panic it would make me feel. They always looked at me weirdly, and it was always the thing we didn't talk about. At the time, I hated it and I wished they would understand me, but now... I'd give anything to have them back."
He laughs against your mouth suddenly, and you feel it, see his eyes crinkle fondly, a gleam in his eyes when he takes you in, as if he can't get enough of you.
He was invited to all the following gatherings, and not just at Harry's insistence. His friends had actually become fond of Draco, especially after he profusely apologised for everything that happened in school.
Weaslette says you've gone soft. She says you're a far cry from the boy you used to be, and thank Merlin for that. She'd have had to sic Hermione on you, if you were.
In contrast, he suspected Malfoy was OCD. Everything was meticulously arranged on his desk, he had a detailed schedule above his work, which he
When you've finished, you're breathing hard, your cheeks flushed and your hands in fists by your sides. He's staring up at you, perfectly still, and his eyes roam over your face. He doesn't say a word but you know that you've made it through to him.
You don't want that anymore. You want to be Draco Malfoy, the one who lost everything and had the strength to rise again. Not the one who sits alone at parties, feeling sorry for himself, not the one who lets others hurt him because he thinks he deserves it. Maybe he deserved it before, but not now.
Malfoy shrugged, the scars on his face shining vividly as they caught the light. When he spoke next, his voice was borderline despairing, but as if it was trying to be casual.
They sat down in silence. Harry pulled out a file requesting his signature - but he found he couldn't concentrate on it at all. The whole ordeal was weighing on him, and the words on the page just began to blur together even as he stared at it. Merlin. He had to do something. He'd been mean to Malfoy for long enough. He sighed, and he skipped to the bottom of the document, scrawling his name on the dotted line absent-mindedly.
"Why did you come tonight, Malfoy?" He asks, his dark hair wonderfully messy and framing his tanned faced, sweat lining his forehead. He looks beautiful.
"Would it?" Malfoy snarled. "As wrong as slicing someone open in a bathroom while they're literally sobbing?"
It's hilarious, until it's boring. You only have two months left of school, and he still hasn't made a move, making you wonder whether he will. That won't be any good. You didn't turn yourself around just for him to watch from afar, as if you haven't taken over his friends and become the person you've always wanted to be.
"God, Malfoy, Draco..." He murmured, grinning like an idiot. "I've been wanting to do that all year. I never said anything, and you thought that I didn't like you, and then you blew up at me... and now you're
Your pulse is racing, as if you've run a marathon, your throat sore from shouting, and yet you've never felt better.
When a Beauxbatons girl suddenly swept into view, placing herself elegantly by Harry and extending her hand to him. Memory Harry seemed delighted by the attention, taking her hand and awkwardly rising to his feet to ask her to dance. She accepted gushingly, and together they departed from the shot.
Harry's eyes widened. He wanted to defend himself, because he knew he'd made the right decision then, but his guilt choked his words. Malfoy must have misinterpreted his expression because he laughed mirthlessly.
"...Because he said you were scum and that you spent your time torturing muggles." Harry was almost afraid by the sudden rise of anger in Malfoy's eyes. "And I thought it was wrong. He, uh, can't treat you like that."
want you." He insisted. "I don't think I've ever wanted anyone more. I was stupid, and all of this is my fault. I promise that I'll fix this, and you'll get your wand and your job back. Just come with me,
"I'm surprised you don't already know, Potter." Harry flinched at the use of his surname, and Draco looked equally pained, but he continued. His voice was quiet and void of emotion. "A new law is being ratified decreeing that no witch or wizard bearing the Dark Mark is to have a wand."
But the conversation had already taken a nastier tone, and Harry was helpless to stop it. It suddenly dawned on him that Draco's animosity was fuelled by his defensive nature. It was his defense mechanism, to lash out and distract others from himself. It wasn't a healthy reflex.
stuck to, and he never wore patterned clothing. He always fell quiet when Harry wore patterned clothing, which he often did after seeing that it bothered Malfoy. He had considered that perhaps Malfoy simply just didn't like patterned clothing rather than having a natural aversion to its design, but the outcome was still the same.
"What... how-" he tried but seemed to abandon the effort later on. Instead, he began to open the present, his gaze suspicious.
They give up when they see that you don't care anymore. In fact, you think that some start to respect you for it. The teachers certainly do, because you see them giving you appraising looks when you're hard at work, and you hear how pleased they are for you when they remark on your improving grades. The eighth years begin to speak to you, though it takes you a while to trust what they have to say, and to reciprocate.
Harry instantly knew it was the wrong thing to say as soon as Malfoy's face shut off, all mirth disappearing from his eyes, his mouth hardening. Why the hell would he say something like that?
He would also casually ask him about his day, no matter how sad an answer he got. Draco started to tell him more and more things that
This strikes you in the exact wrong way, because why should you talk to him, when he hasn't bothered to give you the time of day this year? He was the one who left you cold in the corridor, your hand outstretched and sobs racking your body, and
It had now been a few weeks since the incident, and Harry and Malfoy could almost say there were friends.
You leave at eleven, the party still going strong around you, and no one notices as you go. No one except him. As you go up the stairs alone, you hear footsteps behind you and you turn to see him standing there, his face seeming torn between distrust and curiosity.
It took him a moment to realise that Malfoy's eyes had filled with tears, though only one escaped. Harry had to fight the unbelievable urge to join him in his crying and settled on remaining still from where he sat at his own desk, watching Malfoy.
Draco's long fingers unwrapped the reindeer wrapping paper he'd borrowed by Teddy, smiling slightly at the pattern- and then went still as he saw what the present was.
“Harry?” A familiar voice chimed, and Harry felt his heart stutter. He turned around, gazing into the warmth of Draco’s grey eyes.
“Of course, dear. Are you sure everything is alright?” She asked concernedly, leaning on the counter.
“Muggle?” Malfoy chuckled and it was like music to Harry’s ears. “I thought I’d try it out. Always a good day when I’ve done something that would piss my father off.”
“I know this isn’t the kind of luxury you’re used to Alfie, but this will have to be where you stay until I can get you better.” Harry threw him a treat. “I’ll come and see you later for dinner.”
Harry looked over to Draco as he sat back down on the sofa, the Slytherin on the other end. “Is that so?”
“I just…” Harry picked at his nails, struggling to find the words. He did not want to have this conversation. “I just...I dunno.” He raised his right hand to bite at the nails, but it was caught by Malfoy. He gasped at the touch.
“Dinner, is it? I thought you were offering lunch.” Draco smirked at Potter, loving the way he was so easily riled. He ignored his french remark - as if he’d stop. His mother had often spoken french around him as a child, as his own grandmother was french. He hadn’t found it very useful before, but now his mother had moved to France, she rarely spoke english to him, so he found himself using it more and more these days. Pansy said it made him sound sexy.
Dreams of Draco’s lips chased him relentlessly, only for him to wake up breathless, his legs tangled in the sheets. Each time he woke, he was quickly dragged back under, finding himself once again pressed in the doorway of the shop, pouty pink lips pressed against his. The taste of Draco lingered in his mouth, sweet and bitter all at once.
He watched as Potter slowly slid his finger in, millimetre by millimetre, with a soft gasp. He got to the knuckle and then began pumping it slowly, his eyes closed and eyebrows knitted together. Draco thought he'd never seen something so beautiful. He watched as Potter pulled it out, slicking up another finger, before pushing the two in with a wince. Draco knelt next to the bed, his head between Potter's legs and kissed his way up his thighs.
Harry lifted Teddy onto the sofa, pulling him out of his coat and shoes. “Sonus initium.” He muttered, letting the muggle music flow gently through the large room. The toddler let him, his eyes drooping. “Oh dear, are we ready for nap time?” Harry whispered to the little boy, brushing his salt and pepper hair out of his eyes. The contrasting strands almost suited him.
“How did you get my address?” Harry asked, finally relenting and sitting up. He eyed Draco with distrust, but could hear Lucy's purrs from across the room.
Draco smoothed his jacket down, following the mass of curls into the crowds of the London lunch hour. They walked for a few minutes before Potter looked back, signalling for him to follow him down an alley. The blond frowned, slightly perturbed at following his ex-enemy down a small, secluded spot, but his nervous curiosity was soon sated by Potter opening a baby blue door ahead of them. Behind him, Draco could see a counter with cakes and coffee cups, and when he stepped into the small café, the smell of freshly brewed coffee greeted him pleasantly.
“I’m serious mate, it was weird as fuck, but for some reason, I believe him.” Ron looked almost frazzled, his eyes wide as he plopped down on the sofa beside Harry. The common room was reasonably quiet for a weekday evening.
Draco’s eyes widened, the minute movement the only break in his perfectly schooled stance. He watched Potter walk into the ballroom, as did everyone else, the whole room pausing for a moment to take in the Auror’s entrance. He was dressed well, the deep blue velvet blazer fitted perfectly to his torso, accompanied by matching black shirt and trousers. He looked incredible, as he always did in Draco’s opinion, a little nervous too, but his Gryffindor confidence shone through. Potter smiled politely at the waiter and took a flute of champagne off of the offered tray.
“I’m good, great actually. That’s why I’m here.”  Harry looked down, fiddling with his fingers. Why was it suddenly so hard to talk? Malfoy was just the same prick that he’d known for the past eight years.
“I’ll need to meet this owl. I need to know more about their condition before I can begin the potion making process." Malfoy ran one hand through his hair as he leaned back. He looked straight out of a magazine.
A place like this was always booked up months in advance, but the owner had a hunger for money, and Draco could easily persuade him to open up a table for them.
Draco looked at the parchment again, stroking the tawny owl's head. Right up his street. He wondered what Potter meant by that.
“How on earth is it your fault? I may not have known Remus and Tonks, but I know they died for a good cause. I know they died for what was right.” Draco unconsciously reached towards him again.
“It’s Alfie. Poor little man, I’ve had to isolate him away from the others.” She gestured to where Alfie was in his cage in the back room. “Something is wrong with his magic. All the birds within a twenty foot radius of him start going loopy, flying in circles or struggling to fly at all.” The older woman frowned, her face etched with worry. It was the most emotional Harry had seen her. “I just can’t figure it out. In all my 30 something years of working with magical creatures, I've never seen much like it. The last bird I did was put to sleep.” Pearson turned to him fiercely. “And that is not an option.”
"Thank you." Harry said as the elf bowed out of the room. He didn't know how Kreacher got the things he asked for, if he could disguise himself or something, but the elf always managed to fulfil the task.
Malfoy walked towards him, and Harry watched him warily. “For the moment I knew you wanted me too.” He reached for Harry’s hands, but the Gryffindor withdrew.
Harry lifted a hand to his mouth to stifle his heavy breathing. His eyes wondered over the milky skin of Malfoy’s shoulders, the toned muscles of his biceps and his heart raced faster. He took a step back, eager to retreat, and tripped on the corner of a bench. He flew backwards, landing flat on his arse as the invisibility cloak lifted and revealed half of his face.
Harry could’ve sworn his heart stopped for a moment. He didn’t know what would happen if he kissed Draco, what would happen to their friendship. Hell, he didn’t even know where all these new feelings had come from. All he knew was that it felt right. And if he wanted this, Draco was giving him the opportunity to take it.
His own cock hardened at the thought, and he looked into Potter's endless green eyes to see an excitement that was echoed in his own. He closed his eyes, and with a sharp crack the two landed with a bounce on Draco's bed.
“I’ll let you into a secret.” Potter said quietly as he raised his glass to his lips. Draco watched him swallow and gulped. “The longer we talk, the longer I’m saved from talking to other people.” He whispered the words, his green eyes dancing with humour. “So please do me a favour and get it off your chest.”
Potter smiled and took off, pulling Draco with him. "Come on, let's get some ice cream." He went right up to the store front. "What do you want?"
He pressed his lips against Draco’s, revelling in their warmth and familiarity. How could something feel so utterly, incredibly, right? The kiss was sweet, and did nothing to douse the fire in Harry’s heart. Malfoy, it seemed, felt the same way, as he kissed Harry with everything he had. Harry kissed him back just as fervently, their mouths hot and desperate against each other. Finally, they had to catch their breath.
“I need another drink.” Draco groaned. He left Pansy’s side and began making his way through the crowd, worried Balveer would sense his gaze on him. A few feet away from the bar, someone backed into his path, and he nearly tripped. Draco grabbed onto the body for balance, looking up into the eyes of Harry Potter.
They pulled away and Harry looked at Draco with a new kind of intensity. It wasn't lust; it was… something else. Something new.
Draco grinned and pulled him into a sweet, tender kiss. They broke apart after a moment, resting their foreheads together. “You taste like chocolate.” Draco giggled.
Harry had stopped breathing, his eyes closed to the feeling of Malfoy so close. Pure panic seized him. Was Malfoy taking the piss? Oh merlin, he was! He knew Harry was into men and into him and now he was making fun of him. Tears threatened to spill over, and Harry blinked them away, filled once again with the anger that he was so familair with. He shoved Malfoy hard in the chest, satisfied at watching him stumble back.
Draco ruffled his white hair out of his eyes and hung up his suit jacket. The sound of a muggle ice cream can sounded below, the playful tune ringing out. A wonderful idea popped into his head.
Draco took a large swig of his wine, swilling it around his mouth as he thought over Pansy’s idea. The two had already finished their second bottle and were now well into their third. The blond was laying languidly on his best friend's sofa, the raven-haired witch in question haphazardly strewn across the neighbouring armchair.
“This is Lucy. She’s my cat. And yes, she looks like Sylvia.” Harry mumbled, throwing his arm back over his face.
Draco smirked, he was more than happy to have his turn at teasing her. He suddenly remembered what else he wanted to talk to her about, and his smile faltered, his stomach dropping. “Merlin, Pansy. I feel like I’m out of control.” He rubbed at his head.
Draco didn’t reply, pulling Harry back into the alcove instead. He pressed the other boy up against the wall, leaning in close. “I do.”
Harry twisted his neck to look behind him, spotting the mass of buzzing and wings. He laughed. “Are you scared of bees, Draco?”
Harry felt like he was missing out on something obvious. Like Malfoy wasn’t actually discussing charms notes. “Oh fuck off, Malfoy.” He spat.
Regardless of what his friends said, Harry couldn’t even look Malfoy in the eye. That didn’t mean that he didn’t watch him constantly, though. He spent the week staring at Malfoy’s back in classes, hallways, the Great Hall, and it certainly didn’t help that he now knew what lay under his clothes, the sharp edges of Malfoy’s body. With each day that passed, he was more and more sure of his feelings.
Draco looked up at him from where he had been watching his latte swirl around his cup. “If you’d like it to be.”
And that was all he needed to hear. Draco kissed him fiercely, running his hands over Potter's top, trailing his fingers over the bare skin where it had ridden up. Potter wrapped his arms around Draco and sat up, Draco straddling his lap as he pulled his top over his head. He ran his fingers over his chest hair before reaching round to scratch his back. Potter hissed into his mouth and Draco felt the noise go straight to his cock.
“I’m not saying we sit him down and tell him he’s gay, Granger.” Pansy flicked her eyes over to Lovegood, who was staring dreamily out the window at the rainbow. “All I’m saying is that we encourage him to figure it out himself. And if, at the same time, my ridiculous best friend finally plucks up the courage to confess his feelings, then all the better.”
A chorus of “To Draco.” Echoed around. Narcissa lowered her glass again. “And I would also like to thank Mr Potter for his help in garnering the well deserved attention to my son’s shop.” This time, the cheers were much lesser. It made such a change that Harry almost laughed. Cameras flashed from the crowd, but he pushed down the spike of anxiety in his stomach. This was too good of a moment to ruin.
Draco made his way up the stairs, remembering the way from when he had last come. How much had things changed since then? The two men felt closer, sure, but were they really?
He knew he wanted to spend his last few days with her, spending some quality time together before he left this world. Draco could taste salt and touched his cheeks to realise he was crying. He frowned and wiped them away. That wouldn't do, if he started crying now, Merlin knows he wouldn't be able to stop.
Pansy squealed, a horrific noise that only Draco ever got to hear. Sometimes he wished that being her best friend was a bit quieter. She clapped her hands eagerly. “Wonderful. It’s about time you got some of this mess-” She waved her hands at him, “- out.”
Draco lifted his head and wiped his eyes, kissing her on the cheek. "I'll come visit over Christmas break, mother. Promise to write to me?"
He apparated to Grimmauld Place, stuck on the doorstep until Potter arrived. He contemplated going back to his, but bloody golden tits would surely track him down and question him. No, he’d just have to put on a brave face.
Draco took deep breaths to calm his nerves, taking another of his anxiety pills as he looked himself over in the mirror. He was wearing a tailored grey suit with blue hues, no tie and a couple of buttons undone on his crisp shirt. He had left his hair natural, with a slight curl. It looked longer this way, but was probably just the same length as it had been in school.
"I'm sorry to bother you, but could you please go and grab some grated mozzarella from the shop for me?"
“Yeah. I think we were all too exhausted to go after each other.” The darker man chuckled, and the redhead joined in. Eighth year had been hectic, redoing their NEWTs whilst still dealing with the immediate after-effects of the war. Despite the remaining students being joined into one house, they struggled to regain closeness until the end of the year, and even then the Slytherins had kept on the edges of the group. Harry had seen Malfoy a lot, of course, but they had barely spoken apart from when needed, the occasional -can you pass the jam, please?-.
"S'il vous plaît (please)." Draco called back, walking into the living room. “Where’s my bear?” He called out, searching for the familiar giggling mound of silver hair. It had unnerved him at first, to see what looked like a miniature version of him, but he had soon grown so fond of seeing someone so pure that looked like him. It gave him hope for Teddy’s bright future. He heard the giggly murmurings of the toddler before he saw him, and he turned around to see the familiar face of Edward toddling towards him, but with a full head of jet black ringlets. "Oh mon Dieu (oh my God)!" He shrieked, throwing his hands up. He dived forwards and scooped up the toddler. “What the hell is on your head?!”
“Next time I’ll bring a victoria sponge as well.” He replied, shaking his head and looking back over at his godson in amazement.
He looks up at him as he blotts the table cloth with his napkin, and frowns. "It's not funny Malfoy, I've really fucked this evening up." He sounds somewhere between pissed off and petulant.
Draco reached up and grappled with Harry’s tight fist around his shirt. “Do you even know what pressing a shirt is, Potter?” Finally, Harry let go. “I don’t know what matter you’re discussing, but I can promise you that your tiny little brain is wrong.”
Harry lifts his head, looking at Draco with red eyes. “People don’t believe me when I tell them you’re a sop.”
After finishing their NEWTs, the trio had seemingly been on paths set for separation. Ron was training as a Junior Auror, and was soon going to start work on the field shadowing more senior Aurors. Hermione had gotten an apprenticeship working as an intern for a member of the Wizengamot; Herbert Thornley. He was an old half-blood, seemingly quite traditional, but very tired and more than willing to let his work be done by an enthusiastic young witch like Hermione. It seemed that on most matters he could quite easily be at least half-persuaded to change his opinion - and the rest of the time he was probably just eager to have her off his case. Harry, of course,was working part time at the owlery. This left him with a lot of spare time, which he usually spent with friends. Every so often, a burst of motivation would hit him and he would tackle another room at Grimmauld Place - there just happened to be a lot of them.
He knelt next to the fireplace, sticking his head in. "Harry Potter's house," he called and felt the horrible sensation of having only his head tumbling through the network.
“Oh! I’m so sorry!” Draco ignored him, turning to Potter. “Harry this is Balveer, Balveer, this is Harry Potter.”
Harry looked at him strangely for a minute before shrugging. "Okay, but I'm blaming you for missing dinner at Ron's tonight."
Harry was silent, taking it all in. First Hermione, now Neville. Could it all be true? Surely not. Malfoy had still been rude to Harry twice this year already. But then again, had Harry not started it, both times? It was too much to take in, too much to absorb, this potentially new Malfoy.
"I do, I just wonder how much you’ve done with all this,"  he gestured between the two of them. “Or how much you want to do.”
“Don’t.” Harry chuckled, kicking off his shoes. Draco followed suit, lining them up neatly. “I take mine with two sugars and a splash of milk, by the way.”
And there on the floor was the boy who had haunted Draco's thoughts for the past six years. His skin stretched tight, shiny and pink. He was ugly, barely recognisable as the boy who lived, but Draco knew. Draco knew the face of the boy he tormented, and who's face tormented him every time he slept.
So let me leave you with this, Potter: I feel so many things for you, and none of them can be resolved, or come to fruition. This is my attempt at goodbye. This is my attempt at starting anew. -
Draco climbed off his lap and pulled him up until they were both standing, kissing Potter again as he undid the buttons on his shorts. They fell to the floor and Draco palmed his cock through his boxers, feeling it harden further under his touch as Potter panted into his mouth.
Harry had saved him that day, after all the viciousness of their school life. After all the years of hexes and jinxes, all the bullying. Draco had been screwed from the day he met Harry Potter. He had been destined to fall for a boy who would never love him back. And now, as men, they had a chance. A chance to fall in love, a chance to be together, to forgive and forget, to move on, to learn and grow.
They moved together for another few moments, their breaths falling in sync, their faces close together as they watched each other, silver orbs staring into emerald ones. The two men lost themselves to the music, to the feel of each other. Draco felt like he was floating, like there was nothing in the world except for this completely insane, yet perfectly sweet, moment. Finally, the music came to a close. They broke apart, joining in the applause for the musicians.
“Nah. Not much has happened recently. We need something interesting to talk about.” Ron said, slapping him on the back. Harry was jolted from his thoughts, his positively, absolutely, absurd thoughts. That lager must have been stronger than he realised. “Who wants another?” Ginny and Seamus shot their hands up.
“Ha! He’s got you there, babe.” Hermione chuckled as she watched them over the rim of her wine glass.
The aviary was large, magically extended to the size of a small field, it didn’t have any trees, but there were two dozen perches bordering the outside. The whole enclosure was bordered with mesh wire, extending up ten metres up to allow for flying room. Each perch had three walls to keep out any rain , and the floor below them was wooden bark to make cleaning easier. The majority of the aviary was covered in grass, with longer patches scattered around. It was there that Harry would scatter their food. Right in the centre was a small pond for drinking.
It was the most serious Harry had ever heard her. He smirked. “Insurance.” He whispered, as Malfoy looked between the two of them, aghast.
Draco lifted himself onto his hands, his glasses falling off of his nose and landing beside Potter's head with a clatter. The two men looked at each other, green eyes blazing into grey ones as they caught their breath. Draco's heart hammered in his ears, the heat radiating off of Harry only adding to the blush in his cheeks and making him want to press his chest against the other man’s. Potter looked at him with wide eyes, mirroring his own flustered expression.
“We argued and he stormed off. Thats one. Then I followed him home and we talked it out. That’s a half.” He explained.
Harry clenched his fists, scowling as he made his way across the platform to Ron and Hermione. The pair were ready with consoling comments and cruel remarks.
Harry took a deep breath, steeling himself. “I’m just not as perfect as everyone thinks.” He said quietly. His next words came out in a tumble, “I let everyone down, they all died because I wasn’t fast enough, wasn’t good enough.” His voice broke, tears pricking at his eyes. “Teddy will never see his parents again, and it's my fault.”
Harry pulled away first, resting his forehead against Draco’s as he panted. His feelings were beyond words. Elation didn’t even cover it. After so long in a mist of anger and confusion, Harry finally knew what he really felt. And it, as always, had everything to do with Draco Malfoy.
The Gryffindor wove through the tables to the back corner, where he dropped his jacket in an empty chair at a table for two. Draco followed suit, sitting opposite him and plucking up the menu. The whole place was decorated in rustic pastels, and fairy lights were strung across the walls, offering an intimate atmosphere. Draco put on his reading glasses. The menu offered the standard offerings; sandwiches, paninis, jacket potatoes, cold drinks and hot beverages.
Harry woke with a start, drenched in sweat. For a second he raised his hand to grasp at his bed curtains, eager to see the reassurance of his best friend's face, but he only reached into thin air. His legs were tangled in his bed sheets, and a ticklish roughness licked at his feet. He reached out a shaky hand to grab for his glasses and slid them on. The white mound at his feet took the form of his feline companion. “I’m sorry, Lucy.” The words shook with his breath as he spoke. “Did I wake you up?
Draco watched as Harry Potter shook hands with members of the Wizengamot, and felt his heart swell. If it hadn't been for Potter's testimony, his mother would surely be rotting alongside his father in Azkaban.
“What? Your aunt and uncle?” Draco’s face had contorted in horror. He had known that they had been nasty, but hadn’t realised that they had been cruel too.
Malfoy took a step closer, not letting go of Harry’s arm. “It’s been a week since we last argued, which must be the longest we’ve ever gone.” He smirked. “I haven’t even apologised to you yet.”
You would be hard pressed to find a wizard or witch alive who hadn’t heard of Harry James Potter, or how he had survived The Dark Lord at only a year old. It is nearly two years now since he vanquished Lord Voldemort once and for all, and in the time since has completed his NEWTs - achieving an Outstanding in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as well as Exceeding Expectations in Potions and Charms and Acceptable in Transfiguration and Care of Magical Creatures - and has all but disappeared from society. This comes as a shock to all of us that are close to him, as he has always been such a bright face in a gloomy crowd.
His nights were filled with Malfoy too, dreams of arguments and steam filled showers, soft touches and creamy skin. He felt utterly fucked.
"Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I meant we should get away from all these eyes and go do something less… on show. More relaxed. We could go for a pint? Or a coffee?"
Harry’s shoulders shake silently, and Draco holds him tighter before apparating them the few feet to the bed. They land on the numerous blankets and pillows, and Draco tilts his head to let Harry cry into his neck like he knows he likes. He waits quietly as Harry cries, barely a sound to be heard in their flat. Draco has a flashback to a few months ago, as they had sat at the breakfast bar:
{I hope this reads okay! I just realised I can't have italics and oof.... I hope you can fully understand what are Draco's thoughts and what aren't!}
“I won’t lie to either of them.” Luna finally spoke up. “But I’m happy to help. Draco and Harry will be really great together.”
"Oh mon Dieu (Oh my God). You really are on your golden-boy shit again.” Draco chuckled, shaking his head and pushing himself off of the wall. He didn’t really know why he said it. He opened his mouth to continue but Potter interrupted him.
Harry nodded, glad at having the decision made for him. He took a deep breath, willing himself to just say it. What's the worst that could happen?
Draco shrugged. “I just hope it’s not Weasley. Luna would be- Holy mother of Merlin!” His jaw dropped, his wide silver eyes locking on Edward.
“I’m not homophobic. In fact…” Draco looked down at the floor, running his hand through his hair, seemingly suddenly anxious, “I’ve been waiting for this exact moment.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, pinching the bridge of his nose as he resigned himself to the whims of a stubborn, drunk heiress, with a loud groan. “Fine.”
The Slytherin’s jaw tensed.  “If you came here to make fun of my cat naming skills, Potter, I do have more important things to attend to.”
He met Draco’s lips slowly, almost cautiously. He felt so right, and so warm, that Harry let out a little moan, and that’s all it took for Draco to crawl onto his lap, deepening the kiss. Harry wrapped his arms around his waist, their lips crashing together hotly. It felt so good.
Malfoy pushed the door open, looking around curiously. He was dressed in dark wash jeans and a pale grey button up, untucked and slightly unbuttoned. Harry had to stop his jaw from dropping. He’d never seen Malfoy look so… normal. Well, normal was an understatement. He looked straight out of the pages of a magazine, all tall sophistication and aristocratic cheekbones. Harry had accepted his attraction to men a while ago, and the familiar thrum of excitement heated his veins. He was absolutely, without a doubt, buggered beyond belief.
Oh, God. He’d have to tell Pansy she was right. Maybe he could just go into hiding and change his name? It would probably be easier.
"Yeah, you know…" Ginny rolled her eyes at Harry’s befuddlement. "Like, you just feel so strongly for this person that you don't know what to do with all that emotion, so you get frustrated and it comes out as anger." She explained, sitting back in her chair.
Harry stared at Draco dizzily for a moment as his mind raced and the butterflies in his stomach hurtled round and round, lost in his silver eyes. The slytherin smiled knowingly, seemingly encouraged by Harry’s reaction.
“You know, you’ve been calling me that a lot recently.” Harry says, emerging in a cloud of steam, burgundy boxers clinging sinfully to him.
Harry snorted, looking around until he spotted Hermione talking to Lupin. Ron joined them, and Harry made his way over. “Your brothers are trying their best with a couple of Beauxbatons' girls.” He chuckled.
Was he…flirting? No, he couldn’t be, surely? Draco flicked his gaze up to Harry’s eyes and found them eerily cool. The ball was in his court.
“I’m surprised you haven’t seen him morphe; he only really does his hair at the moment. It usually changes to match the person he finds most interesting.” She shook her head. "Harry was just as oblivious, he only realised a couple of weeks ago."
Harry offered a tight smile, his skin crawling from the warmth of the man’s hand on his leg. He gently lifted it off and the man sighed loudly, his beer-stained breath hot on Harry’s cheek.
“For what was right? If I had been better, they wouldn’t have had to die at all!” Harry sniffed. “You said it yourself, you didn't know them, Malfoy." He stood up, crossing his arms as tears began to fall. "You don't understand.” He sneered. “You were on the other side!"
Pansy squealed and wrapped her arms around him. "Right. Be ready in half an hour, I'll bring my makeup over because this-" she gestured to his face, "- just won't do."
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Harry moved his arm to look at the house elf. “Tell him to piss off. And stop calling him ‘master’ just because he’s a Black.”
"So what if I am, Malfoy?" He was suddenly a lot closer, too close. He looked into the bright green of his eyes and wondered if he could actually get lost in them. Draco hissed and stood up abruptly, using his few inches to look down at Potter, pushing him away.
Harry finally knew the feeling in his heart. Maybe he had known all along, and had been unable to accept it, unable to accept the way he felt about Draco Malfoy. It certainly wasn’t anything he could put into words - and that's how he knew.
“Of course not! You’re so good with him, Harry.” She smiled down at him. “Either way, you make up for it by bringing random sandwiches.” She joked, raising the paper package at him.
"Since you asked so nicely," Draco smirked and dropped to his knees, pulling Potter's boxers down. He took him into his mouth slowly, licking his length and hollowing his cheeks. He bobbed his head at an almost sinfully slow pace and heard Potter curse again. Draco teased him a few moments longer before coming off his cock with a pop.
“You’re going to cause a scene, Draco.” Harry hissed, stepping closer as the witches and wizards around them stopped to watch.
Draco offered an exhausted chuckle. “Some of it.” He tried to think back. “We finished the third bottle of merlot, right? Or was it the fourth? And your dancing, that was great.” He snorted. “Merlin. You do squeal when you’re drunk Pans, I thought my eardrums- OH FUCK!”
"A new potion? From St Mungo’s? A Harry Potter exclusive to help repay you?" The witch actually leaned forward in her seat.
"No worries." Harry smiled back, and it met his eyes. Draco’s heart fluttered and he silently berated it.
“You haven’t, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry could feel his resolve melting already at the sight of Draco’s trembling mouth.
Luna had been one of the only people to get to know him after the battle. She had thanked him for sneaking food and water down to where she was being held at Malfoy Manor, and he had reassured her that anyone would have done the same. ~But no one is you~
“I came here once, when I was younger." Draco commented, taking in the room with a look of mild interest. "It looks a lot nicer now.” Potter had definitely been renovating, and it was a lot more homely now; nowhere near as terrifying and cold as he remembered. He wondered what Potter had done with the house elf heads.
He reached into a cabinet and pulled out some treats. The rustling was all that was needed for his gorgeous black owl to swoop in from Merlin knows where. She landed on his shoulder and nudged his ear. He reached up and fed her a treat.
Harry looked down at the child on his lap, his usual raven curls now interrupted by streaks of white blond hair. “Oh for Merlin’s sake." He cursed quietly, before casting a stubborn scowl at Malfoy. "Of course he likes you so much.” He sighed. Flashbacks of the day he realised Teddy could morphe flashed through his mind, specifically the silky white blond strands on his head. It suddenly all made sense.
At this point in the conversation, Harry Potter was on the brink of tears, and thanked me again for hearing him out as he had been so weighed down with the conflicting emotions of consorting with his ex-enemy. We paused our discussion for him to regain his composure. When we began again, Mr Potter told me how Mr Malfoy had been successful in his treatment, and has since opened his own potion shop in the wake of his success. As repayment, Mr Potter had agreed to this interview.
Harry cursed under his breath as he crumpled the piece of parchment into a ball. It should be simple, right? But it wasn’t.
“Then those nightmares should leave permanently, yes. However, there’s nothing to stop you from getting a new nightmare in say, six months time, of your cock falling off or whatever it is the saviour of the wizarding world worries about.” Draco smirked, pleased at the horrified look on Potter’s face at his words.
"I'm sure it is, my lovely, but I'd prefer it on that dance floor." She grabbed his hands and pulled him up.
Harry held his gaze, both of their chests heaving. He felt on fire. It had been so long since his emotions had been this heightened, and all he wanted to do was push Malfoy against a wall and give him a piece of his mind. For some reason, his brain won out, and he turned away, unable to stand looking at Draco any longer without needing to grab him.
The potion was one of his own making, and he was extremely proud of it. Every peaceful night over the past few months, every good morning, was thanks to it, and now he didn’t even need to take it anymore. He sent out a silent prayer that Potter wouldn’t pry too much - he did NOT want to have that conversation.
Harry Potter asking what Draco was doing at the ministry a few months later. "I'm training to be a curse-breaker, Potter. Let me guess, you're already Head Auror?" he had drawled in return. To his surprise, he had laughed, actually laughed.
Somewhere inside, Harry felt bad for putting him on the spot like this, but couldn’t find it in him to care right at that moment. “Since when were you friends?”
Harry admired her a lot. She didn’t make a fuss about who he was. In fact, when he had first applied for the job, she had raised a single eyebrow at him and told him he wouldn’t be getting any special treatment from her. That was more than fine by him, and as time went on, he found they got on well.
“You can't..?” Draco pulled him to a stop. “You’re telling me that you just insinuated a made up relationship to my ex, practically promised him a show on the dance floor, whilst also telling the whole bloody world that you like men - which will be in the papers all year by the way; not least because you’re with me, just to save my embarrassment? And you can’t bloody dance?!”
He grabbed a box of tissues and pushed it towards her, kissing the top of her head as he got up to make some tea. He didn't want to make her talk if she didn't want to.
Thank you, for giving me that chance. I wish it could have been for longer. I wish we could have longer together.
Draco followed his gaze, and cursed. There was his ex and his friends. Panicking, he shoved Harry against the doorway of the nearest shop. "Fuck, shit, bollocks!"
Draco held his hands up in surrender. "I didn't mean anything about it, oh Mr Saviour," his voice dropped with mockery.
“Thank you, Lovegood.” Pansy smiled devilishly. “Now listen closely, because this needs to go well.”
Old enough never came. Draco had returned home with his parents, and they hadn't travelled back to Egypt again. Instead, holidays were spent with arguments or icy silence. His mother often took trips to southern France, but Draco was rarely permitted to do so.
Draco feels as though his heart is going to explode. It really is quite rude how someone could be so fit and so cute at the same time.
“Well, you weren’t supposed to find out.” Harry dragged his spare hand through his hair. Fucking bollocks.
That night, as Harry slept, he dreamed of Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Music poured around him, laughter flowed freely, smiles beamed on almost everyone’s faces.
“Yeah, who doesn’t get turned on by caffeine jitters.” She looked at him pointedly and he frowned. Luna wrapped her arms around Ginny from behind, silently putting her chin on her shoulder. “We’re all here for you, Harry. Maybe you should try the mind-healers again.” The red head added.
“I’ll pay for the ingredients and research or whatever.” Potter said, trepidatiously, obviously still a bit pissed off.
"I thought you already were-" Draco cut him off with a hard thrust and they both moaned. His pace quickened and became more erratic.
“I told her how you saved my life! It’s not my fault she twisted my words!” Harry said, stepping close to the counter as his anger rose. Why did Malfoy always rile him so?
Draco took a step back, afraid to let him get closer. He was already too vulnerable. “But that doesn’t change -”
Narcissa gave a small smile at that. “Right, well, I’ll let you continue with your day.” She kissed Draco on the cheek again. “Remember to write to me.”
Draco frowned, unsettled by the sudden change in conversation. Was Potter really holding a grudge over something that happened over eight years ago?  "Don’t be so rude. As if you're the same person you were when you were eleven, Potter." He snapped.
When he returned, he was carrying a rather large potion bottle, stoppered with a cork and sealed with wax. “You are to take three spoonfuls each night. No less, no more. Understood?” Sylvia was sniffing Potter intently as he leaned against the counter.
I wanted to portray the after effects of the war without it being the main plot, whilst also showing you guys the budding relationship of these two fools. I hope you liked it, and I hope I did it justice!
"Yes! It's like a bloody miracle - I know you said the potion was relatively easy, but I didn't quite believe you until now." Harry chuckled.
Harry watched this all from a distance, his relationship with Draco no more than friendly acquaintances. He didn’t know if he wanted more. He was content just to see the other boy happy for once.
Caring for owls wasn’t a particularly exciting job, but that was more than fine with Harry. He enjoyed the quiet, or at least the lack of talking. Working with them made him feel like his soul was being soothed, though it was hard to come in every day, not knowing which ones had been bought.
Draco grimaced. “Oui, malheureusement (yes, unfortunately). She was wearing this horrible cherry lip gloss that I couldn’t get off of my face all day.”
She let out her breath in a whoosh and couldn't help but smile devilishly. She had been so patient, making sure to not give him the poison until he was confident in taking the pills, and the past 90 days had been the slowest of her life. When he had rang to request a refill, she knew this was her chance.
“This afternoon.” Ha muttered a quick tempus: 13:17. “Sh- I mean oh no! I didn’t realise the time Andy, I’m sorry.” He lifted Teddy onto her lap, narrowly avoiding swearing.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, shuffling closer on the bed and using his other hand to grip Harry’s chin, tilting it up towards him. “But I’d make it again,” he whispered, “If only to spend the night in your arms once more.”
Harry wiped the dust from his eyes, breathing heavily, his heart hammering in his chest. The wind howled in his ears, echoing around the ruins of the castle. Broken glass and rubble crunched under his feet as he staggered towards what should have been the courtyard. He squinted at his surroundings as his vision shook and shivered, trying to make out the spottings of colour around him. He screwed his eyes shut before opening them again, blinking rapidly.
“Like me?” Harry watched as Ginny raised the donut to Luna’s lips and she took the last bite. “I have more donuts, you know. You don’t have to share.”
He tried to move away as gently and slowly as he could, worried his semi would be too obvious. Maybe Draco was still asleep.
Harry looked at him quizically and Draco looked away with a cough. Something hot and wet splattered on his hand and he looked at it with wide eyes, coughing again as the taste of metal hit his tongue.
“You take it before bed, and after about thirty minutes you will be pulled into a deep sleep.” Draco leant forward, resting his elbows on the counter. “The first few nights, your nightmares may continue, but this time have some differences. For example, if you were having nightmares about your friends arguing, a new person may appear and interrupt the argument. Or if someone were chasing you through Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall might appear and give the person chasing you a detention.”
Malfoy’s living room was modern and chic, all greys and blacks with forest green accents. It had dark wash wooden flooring, with a black wooden bookshelf, cabinets and matching coffee table, a forest green rug underneath the latter, the main portion of the room filled with a plush grey corner sofa overhung by a dazzling silver chandelier. A large picture of a woodland hung over the fireplace, and in the far corner stood a tall forest green lamp, casting a warm light across the room; which had been sitting empty all evening, the tall Slytherin owner only occasionally pacing through on his way to the kitchen, biting his nails. Suddenly, Pansy Parkinson appeared in the fireplace with a roar of the flames, still in her fitted suit from her day at work, eyes wide, handbag clutched tight in hand. Sylvia padded into the room, offering her a meow in greeting.
“Don’t try and be coy.” He said, leaning in closer. They sat at the dimly lit bar, the golden boy-turned-man and his unwanted admirer - his much-bigger admirer. He was a muggle, in a muggle bar, unknowing of Harry’s fame, just simply looking for a hookup.
Draco snorted. “Oh mon Dieu, it’s to celebrate my shop.” He chuckled. “Mother wanted a reason to throw a bash, and my shop’s newfound success, owed mostly in part to you, is a good enough one.” He sipped his champagne with a shrug.
Harry nodded, lifting his chin from his scarf to give her a tight smile. Merlin, give him strength; he needed it to deal with an angry, puffed up Draco Malfoy.
“But I don’t even know what to wear.” Harry mumbled. Luna had invited him to a garden party, murmuring something about not having a rainbow. He knew that the 30th anniversary of The Quibbler was coming up, and so assumed it was for that. He was more than happy to support it, but wasn’t too keen to meet so many people. He’d done a good job of avoiding reporters and oddities in the past year or so, and wasn’t trying to change that anytime soon.
“Oh fuck off, Potter. Forget I ever said anything.” Malfoy sneered down at him before spinning around and striding away with a flourish.
Harry turned the channel to put it on. “He’s alright yeah, says the potion shouldn’t be too hard to make. He said it probably already exists somewhere obscure.”
“No, the mother barn owl is off her meds now, so all is back to normal.” Paeson stretched her hands above her head, cracking her neck. “I’m gonna make a cuppa, you want one?”
I could go on and on, but the point is this- you still plague my thoughts. You still fill my head. You’re in my dreams, my nightmares, my desires…
"My, my. Such amorous flirtation. One would think you'd been doing this for say, a few weeks now." Pansy smiled devilishly. "Or at least that's what I told Balveer when he asked."
Harry emerged from the toilets, wiping his damp hands on his jeans. The music thumped loudly around him, shaking the floor as the strobe lights added to the disorientating, heady vibe of the club. He searched the mass of bodies for the last of his friends standing. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had all retired for the night. Or should he say morning?
"What can I get for you?" The barmaid smiled at Draco, and he faintly wondered if she's just very good at customer service, or actually doesn’t recognise him.
“I’m not!” Draco reached for his hands again, and when Harry didn’t move away, he gave them a squeeze. The touch made his skin tingle, and the butterflies once again appeared with urgency. “I like you, Harry.”
The Slytherin’s face was bright red now, their noses nearly touching. His eyes practically sparkled and he wet his lips almost nervously. He was silent for a moment, apparently considering something before finally shoving Harry away.
And with that, Potter dashed off down the hallway, leaving Draco’s fingers tingling and his stomach fluttering with butterflies. They were both doomed, surely, so why were they both so excited about it?
“What, no hug?” Harry teased, walking up behind him and squeezing him tightly. Ron wheezed dramatically, flicking water at him over his shoulder.
"If you keep doing things like asking me on random trips to Paris, you'll be well on your way to never getting rid of me."
Here was his enemy, topless and warm and kind, and Harry just couldn't make sense of it all. His rapid heart, the butterflies in his stomach, the utter want he felt to touch Malfoy. He hadn’t felt this way since, well, since he kissed Cho. His face was hot, and he was beyond confused and… Oh Merlin. Was Ginny right?
“They’re so pretty aren’t they?” Luna twirled one between her fingertips. “I found them at a muggle store, which is great, because they’re fake!”
His hand was so warm, all of Potter was. It was like he was fire personified, warming you up, all blazing looks and passion. Draco ached to know whether he brought that fire to the bedroom.
“Well I certainly feel ancient with how quickly this one is growing.” She nodded at Teddy. “When are you at work?”
"No Quick-Notes Quill. What I have to say is quite personal, and I will not have you taking it and running a mile." He said firmly, trying his best not to sound unkind.
“I’ll come with you.” Draco said simply, before taking in Harry’s confusion. “It’s not good to be alone after something like that,” he explained.
Harry’s stomach jolted. Sometimes he forgot other people could hear him. “Umm…” He scratched the back of his head. “He said you weren’t good looking.”
“Are the nightmares recurring? Often the same dream or dreams over and over again?” Draco propped his chin on his hand.
"That's not what we were going to- ow!" Ron yelped as Hermione slapped him on the arm with a deathly glare.
“My house is only around the corner, do you want to come in for a drink?” Thank Merlin for Gryffindor bravery.
Draco put Sylvia down, relaxing against the shelves behind him in a haughty manner which he knew rubbed the other man the wrong way. “The saviour work continues.” He said with a smirk. Okay, so maybe he was allowing his schoolboy fantasy of Potter pushing him against a wall get the better of him. But really, life could be so dull sometimes; wasn’t he allowed to have some fun?
He led them slowly in time to the music, the two not doing much more than swaying. He'd been dancing at events like these since he was young, and was moderately skilled. Potter on the other hand, kept narrowly avoiding stepping on his feet. Their bodies were pressed tightly together and the heat gave Draco tingles all over, the warmth spreading all over his body and leaking slowly downwards towards his groin.
As Harry chopped the peppers, he let his mind wander back to earlier that day. It had gone so much better than he had expected. After the first half an hour, Malfoy and him had fallen into an easy rhythm. Draco would fetch the potions whilst Harry worked the till, and if the customer wanted a personalised potion, Harry would jot down notes as Draco asked them questions.
They wound their way back through the path, and onto the lawn. People stared, people gawked. Luna smiled, and Pansy winked at them. They made their way into the gazebo, Narcissa locking eyes with Draco sharply. She came over, fake smile plastered on. When she got close enough, her face dropped.
“Hey! I’m the one who had to decipher your horrific handwriting.” And read your half-lusty, half-sad ramblings on four hours sleep, he thought.
He was wearing exactly what Ron and Hermione had said, a light peachy button up and jeans, with his nicest pair of shoes.
Potter's mouth was warm and sweet, his lips slightly chapped. Draco kissed him back and hummed against his lips. It was better than he had ever imagined, and Merlin, had he imagined this a lot.
Was it a date? A catchup? A hang out? He wouldn’t know what ‘coffee’ meant on a good day - but add to the mix that the pesky little mini-me couldn’t keep his bloody mouth shut; and Harry was beyond panicking. Now the real Draco Malfoy knew that Harry had named his snake after him. Oh, and he knew that his snake counterpart thought they should get a room. How bloody fantastic.
Draco sniffled into Harry’s curls. “I’m sorry for making you feel unwanted.” He leant back to kiss Harry’s forehead. “I do want you.”
Malfoy paused, narrowing his eyes and thinning his lips. “Her name is Sylvia. What does this have to do with anything?” He quirked an eyebrow.
“Bloody twat, you’d think Dumbledore would’ve found some excuse to kick him out by now.” Ron cut in, scowling at Malfoy over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry stroked Lucy as he caught his breath, casting a quick tempus; 05:32. He was too awake now to go back to sleep, but he could go and see one of the only people awake this early - Ginny. There was a good chance she’d be getting in some early practice at the quidditch pitch. He climbed out of bed, pulling on some jeans and a tshirt, and grabbing his coat from where he had discarded it at the base of the bed. “Come on, Luce. Do you want some breakfast?”
“Oh, you know. The same as always. My old hens come round and talk my ear off, and this cheeky boy has me wrapped around his finger.” She smiled at Teddy as he toddled over to his toy box, pulling out a toy dog.
Draco turned away, trying his best to blink away his tears. He turned back to punch Potter in the shoulder. "So much for Saint Potter, did you just call me stupid?"
He didn’t answer, because, well, he didn’t know. He didn’t know where he was going, or why he was so angry. He should be happy that Malfoy’s cruel ways were apparently over, but he wasn’t. Because it was so strange, so unusual. After all these years of bullying and harassment, why was he stopping now? What had changed?
"What we were discussing earlier." He flicked his eyes over Ginny's shoulder at Luna, undecided whether or not he wanted her to hear what he had to say. The Ravenclaw was a nice, kind girl, and they were friends, but he didn't really want anyone else knowing. The only reason he was telling Ginny and not Ron or Hermione was because she basically already knew.
"Right, that's it, I'm coming in." Ron's voice carried from outside the door, and a second later it flung open, the red head staring in shock at the sight before him; papers scattered around the room, and in the middle of the chaos, Draco Malfoy lying on top of Harry Potter, hands either side of his head, pale skin flushed, white-blonde hair falling into his face. "What the fuck, Malfoy?"
“Enjoying a lovely cup of tea with my dear friend, Luna, here.” She sipped at her cup. “Why, what does it look like?”
“Yes, I’m sure. You know full well that he apologised to me back at the start of Eighth year. Plus, Luna trusts him, and I trust her, so.” Harry shook his head, trying not to lose his train of thought. “Anyway, he said it works by inspiring your own subconscious to fight back against the nightmare. For the first few weeks I’ll still have the nightmares, but they’ll be different.”
The familiar pull of apparition tugged Harry along, and when he opened his eyes again, he was staring at the front gates of Malfoy Manor.
“I’m not joking.” Harry took another step forward, until they were only a few feet away from each other. He summoned his Gryffindor courage. “I’ve been thinking about your arse too.”
Draco pried open the box carefully and selected a piece, popping it into his mouth. He had never tasted something so good. He peeked at his father out of the corner of his eye and schooled his features. "Thank you, Mother. It is most exquisite. Would you like some?"
He turned to his mother to see her raise her head from where it had been bowed, and Draco fell into her arms as tears swelled in his eyes.
“Make me.” Harry whispered, holding on tighter. If you had told him two hours ago that he would be flirting with Malfoy outside the Great Hall, he would have told you to go and get your head checked for wrackspurts. He felt almost giddy with excitement and disbelief, and most of all, anxiety. He was just riding on the wave of adrenaline at this point.
They continued on, lips swollen, warm with drink. When they finally reached the flat, Harry dug out a spare set of pajamas and a towel, and left Draco in the spare room. He went through the motions of getting ready for bed, the whole process taking far too long and making him feel nauseous. He downed half a glass of water before climbing into bed and falling into a restless sleep.
As they reached the end of the year, Draco Malfoy could be seen pulling childish pranks on his friends - tipping water on their heads, ice cubes down their shirts, casting sticking charms on their shoes. Teachers would only half-heartedly reprimand him for talking in class. His fellow slytherin friends would throw insulting names at him, and he would throw more creative, more absurd ones back, and they would all laugh together. He was back to himself, posh and snarky, but he was happier, his shoulders lifted, his words no longer holding the malice they once did.
"Bloody buggering balls." Harry muttered, searching the fridge desperately for the mozzarella. "Be thankful you don't have opposable thumbs, Luce, or I'd be blaming you for this." He shook his head at her as she sat on the kitchen counter beside him, head tilted as if she could understand him. He could've sworn he had bought some the other night. How was he supposed to make his legendary pizza now? Ron and Hermione were due in ten minutes, and all he'd done was turn the oven on.
Most of Harry’s time was spent cleaning, poo picking, and feeding. Every few days Harry would test the younger owls by sending them out to another emporium the shop was partnered with thirty miles away. If they returned with the note signed, then they were ready. Owls used their own kind of magic, meaning that they could find someone even if their whereabouts were unknown. The magic had a wizard repellant, meaning that they couldn’t be tracked or followed.
Harry spent the next couple of hours clearing all of the stuff from the grand bedroom into it’s private sitting room, airing it out and placing two hundred bloody sheets of newspaper on the floor. When he was done, he brought Alfie in and opened the cage, letting him free. This would have to be his home for now, until he could get him better. Sadly, he couldn’t trust Lucy with him, so he was confined to the room. Although very large for a wizard, it was still much smaller than the aviary, and only had about twenty feet of flying space. He unmagicked the door, making sure to not let Lucy in, and fastened the windows a couple of inches open so that there was plenty of fresh air.
"Obvious?! I only just realised! How in Merlin’s name did you know?" Harry looked between the two, aghast.
Draco Malfoy yawned as he unlocked the door to his shop, murmuring the words needed to de-activate the wards. He still wasn’t used to having something that was his, that he’d earned, not been gifted or given or passed down. No, this shop was his; months of hard work and stress all wrapped up nicely and painted with a fresh coat of prussian blue.
They walk into the entrance and Potter gives his name, which is given no exceptional notice as is the normal response. Muggles, Draco thinks, so blissfully unaware. Potter follows the waitress to the table and Draco happily stares at his pert arse.
“Merlin, I don’t know.” Harry had to admit he was almost tired of the repetitive arguments, though the fire Malfoy lit in him was unlike anything else he had ever felt. Because, really, that’s why he did it. Nothing was quite like a battle with Malfoy, the way his whole body felt on fire. And the git deserved every insult Harry would throw at him, didn’t he? It wasn’t as if he was anything close to a victim in all of this, he had said his fair share of horrid things too.
“I’m so sorry to interrupt, Andy. I, erm, just wanted to collect my coat that I forgot.” He lied, running his hand through his hair nervously.
Draco’s eyes shot open, focusing on Pansy as she sat on the armchair, hair brushed, face washed, sitting in a fresh set of pyjamas. “Why the fuck are you okay?” He groaned, rubbing his face.
A 6 year old Draco leaned over the edge of the boat excitedly, pointing down at the water. "Look, mummy! The fish! They're so bright, red and blue and green and yellow and-"
He barely noticed as Luna appeared through the portrait hole, greeting her girlfriend with a kiss on the cheek. She was a regular in the common room, despite having her own to retreat to. The Ravenclaw took Ginny's hand as the two stood, heading up to the girls’ dormitories. As they passed, Ginny leaned down to whisper in Harry’s ear.
Potter fumbled with Draco's buttons, practically ripping them off as he tore away his shirt. His hands were so hot on Draco's skin, blazing a trail along his torso. Draco felt his fingers graze over the scars on his chest before Potter pulled away. He looked down at the scars under his hands and cursed.
“My apologies, Mother. I have been rather busy.” Draco’s voice was tight and Harry couldn’t tell if he was on the verge of tears or shouting.
Harry sucked in a breath, turning to watch her retreating back. What the fuck? How in the world did she know that he was on about Malfoy? Was it really that obvious? And if so… Did Ginny really believe he was -passionate- about Malfoy? What did that even mean, anyway?
“I told you I’m honest.” He shrugged, a devilish glint in his eye. “Just don’t go telling that snake of yours. If he really is like me, he won’t stop telling you he told you so.”
I have been told to write this letter to get my feelings out. And though I would usually deny these feelings, everything must end - including these ridiculous thoughts. “What thoughts?” You may ask. Well, let me tell you.
When the Medi Witches and Wizards arrived, they found Harry Potter sobbing over the lifeless body in his arms, covered in blood.
The two pushed their way through the crowd, and Draco closed his eyes to the music, losing himself to it. He lifted his arms and swayed his hips, laughing to himself. The bodies pressed in tighter, everyone against each other. Draco opened his eyes to find Pansy winking at him, signaling to a tall brunette at the bar.
"Merlin's beard, Malfoy. I thought I was supposed to be the dim one! I spoke at your trial, remember?"
He was greeted by the eerie silence of Harry's apartment, and the thrilling view of his coffee table. "Harry?" he called and watched as a pair of legs wandered in, crouching down to reveal a rather disheveled, pyjama-clad Harry Potter.
Potter laughed and dropped his ice cream, wrapping his hands around Draco's wrists. Draco tried to pull away but Potter just tightened his grip, and really, his shorts shouldn't be this tight. He stopped struggling and as Potter was about to say something, he pushed him back, knocking the two over with Draco sprawled across him. Potter kept his grip and leaned up to whisper in his ear. "You're dead, Malfoy."
Harry frowned. “You should go back.” His mind swirled around the most important thing Malfoy had said all night; ‘him’. Was Malfoy gay?
“Wow. I wonder what it feels like to be interrupted!” The darker man said, scowling. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if he looked that good whilst scowling too.
Harry frowned, thinking about everyone who died, everyone who lost their family and friends. Many were younger than him. He didn't need pity. He needed to grieve and move on, like everyone else.
He marched through the crowd, narrowly avoiding drinks in his determination. He approached the two steadily, coming up beside them and slinking his arm around Draco’s waist. The broad looked over at him, confused, as Harry pecked the blond's cheek. "Everything alright?"
The jingle of the bells above the front door told her that her destiny was finally here. She spun around quickly, a dazzling smile on her face.
He motioned for Potter to go first, and he turned the sign from open to closed, locking the door and lifting the wards. “Where to?” He asked, putting his hands in his pockets.
Draco snorted. “Good idea, Potter. The hallway is about to flood with students.” The Slytherin didn’t look away though, his silver eyes holding Harry's with a hopeful look.
Draco had sat in his room that night fretting. First impressions counted, and he didn't know if he'd have another chance. It's his loss, Draco thought, I'm a Malfoy, no one can mess with me.
"As if you've never been a condescending prick before," he chuckled and clasped Draco on the shoulder. "Come on, pick up your drink. Let's have a walk."
All he had wanted to do was have a nice lunch, get to thank Malfoy properly. He hated to admit it, but with all his free time, He often found himself thinking about the people he didn't see. And yes, that was mainly Malfoy. Was it so bad to want to have a catch up? Why did Malfoy have to make everything so difficult?
The two women shared a smile. It was strange; to see the two together like that. So strange in fact, that when Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley walked in, searching for a lunchtime snack, they were immediately suspicious of something underhanded. Pansy’s gaze fell past Luna, towards the two scowling Gryffindors marching towards their table.
How about Galvin La Chapelle at 7pm tomorrow? It’s a muggle restaurant, but I think it's right up your street.
“Harry.” Dream-Draco mumbled against his lips. The Gryffindor took it as an invitation, diving right back in, pulling him as close as he could.
"What do you want from me, Potter? Do you want to be best mates? Why don’t you ask one of the hundreds of wizards lining up to kiss your arse instead." Malfoy hissed the words at him, narrowing his eyes as the two faced off in the alleyway. “Salaud (bastard).”
"Merlin's tits, Potter. You're making me miss that pretty little scowl of yours." Their interaction may have lacked the same vehemence and distrust that it often did back at Hogwarts, but the two men were certainly still as passionate about each other (though Draco supposed the exact kind of passion had changed too).
Draco looked up at Harry, water dripping from his curls, the sun shining behind his head. Merlin, if this wasn’t a wish come true, a dream come true, then what was? The moment was perfect, the cold water sending a buzz through his body. If fate, or destiny, or whoever,, wanted something to happen, then this was the time to act. He had spent too much of his life hating Potter, ridiculing him, bullying him, avoiding him, hiding himself from him. Enough was enough.
He looked back at Harry to find him almost comically looking between Draco and his case. "If you wanted to move in Draco, you could have told me first."
The sound of buttering toast ceased, and Draco looked up to see Harry frowning at the jam. “It’s how I was brought up. If I was too loud, they’d make me skip dinner.”
It was just the usual, a copy of the day’s Daily Prophet, a copy of The Quibbler, a letter addressed in Hermione’s writing, no doubt reminding him of the Weasley spring get-together, and...another letter. He didn’t recognise the handwriting. He pried open the seal curiously, unfolding the letter inside:
“So, what can I do for you?” Draco tried not to giggle as Sylvia licked his cheek. When he looked back at Potter, he was watching him with something akin to affection. How odd.
Harry felt like he was floating, his whole body light as he laughed. How had it taken him so long to realise? He’d always thought Draco was beautiful, but fancying him had never really crossed his mind. He’d always thought he was straight, but now… Was he gay? Bisexual? He didn’t know. All he knew was that this was the happiest he’d been in a while. It all made sense now, the heat between them when they argued, the looks he’d caught from Draco, the butterflies. This is what they were meant to be all along.
The pale boy took a steadying breath. “I know I shouldn’t care what she thinks, because you make me happy, but I do.” Deep breath. “It’s not that I’m ashamed of you, Harry. I’m just scared. She doesn’t know that I’m gay. I’m a Malfoy, I have to carry on my family line.”
“Well I’ll tell you what I told Mr Potter here, and that is; you won’t be getting any special treatment from me. Understood?”
"I beg your pardon?" Draco spun around to meet Potter's eyes. He just smirked and took it from his hands, looking through it.
"Don't you ever wonder what would’ve happened if we had been friends?" Harry couldn't stop the words from pouring out of his mouth, his heart desperate to speak now he finally had Malfoy sitting across from him. He’d always felt drawn to the Slytherin. When he was younger, it was easier to hate him; and boy, had Draco given him plenty of reason to. Even though they had never spent much time together, the other was always there, in the background. Granted, they hadn’t talked much since Harry spoke at Draco’s trial, but it didn’t mean that he hadn’t watched him closely the entirety of eighth year. But there wasn’t a marauder’s map for the entirety of London, and his friends rarely spoke of Malfoy. It was like he’d vanished from Harry’s life over the past nine months.
“You’re welcome.” Draco said smugly. The waitress brought over their drinks, placing them down in front of their respective drinkers. “I agree with him, anyway.”
With a crack they disapparated, landing in a small, shaded alley. The sound of splashing water could be heard. Potter took his hand. "Lead the way."
"Can I get you anything to drink, gentlemen?" Draco frowns at the menu, realising that muggle wine is much different to wizard wine. He passes it over to Potter.
"You're right. I don't. Here’s what I do know: you’re an arrogant arsehole who can’t even sit through one conversation!” Harry took a step closer, jabbing a finger at him. At this point he didn’t know what he wanted more, an actual conversation; a chance to be friends - or this fiery confrontation that he hadn't realised he’d missed so much.
“Hi, Bear!” He called, taking Teddy from Andromeda’s arms and ruffling his white hair. “How are you?” Teddy pulled at his earlobes, a favourite habit of his. “I can’t stay long, Andy. Je suis désolé (I’m sorry). I need to get back to the shop.” Draco’s heart was racing, and he felt like he might explode - he was certainly not going to do that in front of his Aunt, Potter be damned.
“Summery…” Harry muttered, mentally going through his wardrobe. He groaned “Can’t you guys come too?”
“That’s no way to greet a customer.” Potter said, fiddling with a sleeping potion that a previous customer had left at the desk.
Balveer was the latest of Draco’s romantic escapades, and held a striking resemblance to a certain navy-clad wizard across the room. He was sinfully gorgeous and sweet and kind - and did absolutely nothing to Draco’s heart. They had broken up a few weeks prior, and despite their relationship only lasting a few months it had been more than messy. It was safe to say that the man did not return Draco’s feelings of ‘only friends’.
"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
Ron didn’t answer, in fact, he didn’t even look at Harry, his gaze focused solely on Hermione. Merlin, he should have noticed them sooner. “Oi, mate.” He nudged Ron’s arm. Again, nothing. “Oi, why are you ignoring me?” Ron didn’t even flinch. Harry looked at Hermione and Lupin, still in deep discussion. Neither of them had even looked his way. “What are we talking about?” He tried, and again, nothing. His stomach sank and twisted with anxiety. He tried to brush it off.
The Slytherin let out a delighted chuckle, clapping his hands together in mockery before pouting his lips. “Awww, it’s okay! No need to be ashamed, Potter. I can help you with your notes, too.”
Draco watched the green flames disappear and sighed, reaching down to untie his laces. All of a sudden, his stomach jolted. Hand over his mouth, he rushed to the toilet, falling to his knees as he threw up into the bowl. It seemed to never end, and his stomach ached as he dry heaved over and over. He leant his head on his arms, breathing heavily as snot ran down his face. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and did a double take at the blood smeared on it. He looked into the bowl and saw much of the same.
He lead them out of the alley and into the bright sunlight, muttering a skin protection spell as he went because he knew how easily he burnt. They turned the corner to see a stream of clear water, children splashing in it as parents and dogs sat on the grassy banks, eating ice cream and laughing. It looked heavenly.
A short rap on the door signalled Draco Malfoy's entrance. The short, portly man spun round in his chair with a tight smile, gesturing to the seat before him.
So why was he staring at said posh pompous pillock’s hand outstretched in an unlikely truce? Unfathomable, unlikely, unexpected.  A strange, stupid, silly, idea. And yet here it was in practice. Harry’s eyes traveled up the long, slender digits encircled in silver family heirlooms, up the sleeve of the freshly pressed grey shirt, past the adams apple, up to the pink pouty lips, and finally, stared straight into the narrowed silver eyes of the git he’d long since hated with a passion.
Malfoy placed the coins on the counter, swiftly picking up the pouch with a nod. "Good afternoon, Miss."
Draco looked into his eyes, the bright green awash with tears. He was dying, right now. Perhaps there were worse ways to go.
"Scum and mudbloods." Lucius corrected under his breath, frowning at the two from behind his scotch glass. Draco hadn't heard him.
Narcissa chuckled and wrapped her arms around Draco, scooping him up. "I know they're pretty Draco, but you can't lean that far over! What would I do if you fell in?"
"You're doing so well," he whispered and Potter let out a little whimper. Draco watched as he began pumping his fingers a bit faster, panting heavily.
As he watched, Potter turned and met his eye, a small look of shock crossing his face. Luna turned too, and waved eagerly at him. He nodded back with a small smile and turned away, not wanting to draw any more attention to himself. He took a large gulp of his wine, memories of the past few years flooding his mind.
Maybe he should just forget the whole thing. He could just avoid Malfoy; it wasn't as if they bumped into each other regularly anyway.
As I sat across from him, a blossoming young man far from the spindly child of our first meeting, I was certainly most worried for him. He reassured me that he was okay, simply wishing to confide in me in hopes that I may enable him to help other witches and wizards through my world-renowned writing.
Draco picked up a couple of sickles from the tip jar and rubbed them together thoughtfully, his brain running through what needed to be done for the day. A dark figure appeared in his peripheral vision, and he did a double take. “Shit!”
As they neared the gates, they opened, revealing Pansy Parkinson, champagne flute in hand. “Bienvenue (Welcome).” She greeted, seemingly unsurprised at their presence. “Let’s get you something to drink.”
The Slytherin’s lips parted wordlessly, and he gave them a lick. Harry watched the movement before flicking his eyes back up to Malfoy’s. The Gryffindor stood, the sudden movement almost knocking the other boy over. He began pacing, running his hands through his curls.
Pansy propped up a very drunk Draco against the doorway. "Alohamora." The door swung open and she nudged him in, pushing him onto the sofa.
“Go fuck yourself, Malfoy. I knew you were a bigoted prick, but this?” Harry spat the words at him, backing away. “So much for apologies, you homophobic arsehole!”
Potter groaned and placed his lips against Draco's neck, grazing his teeth against his sensitive skin. Merlin, 15 year old Draco would have burst a blood vessel knowing what was about to happen, after spending so many nights in his bed at Hogwarts, fist tight around his cock over the thought of Harry Potter.
A bucket list. That's what the healer had called it. A list of things he wanted to do before dying. The finality of everything weighed heavily on Draco's chest. Breathe.
Draco smirked and put on a high pitch voice. "Oh Merlin! It’s Harry Potter!" he squealed, tapping him on the shoulder. "Can I have you autograph, Harry?" He poked his shoulder repeatedly.
"Good." Draco traces his fingers over his face before flipping them over, Potter landing with a gasp. He grinned devilishly. "But do you have experience taking it?"
His godfather smiled happily, picking him up and putting him on his lap, casting a gentle warming charm over him now he was out of his blankets. It wasn’t too cold in the spring air, but he still wanted to be careful. “You want some more?” He scooped up another bit, offering it to the toddler, who managed to get it all around his mouth. Harry leant forwards, using the cuff of his sleeve to wipe it away. He could have done it with magic, but sometimes it just felt more natural to do things the muggle way. He wonders which way his parents preferred to use when he was little.
Harry chuckles and pulls the sweater over his head, walking over to Draco. “What? Are you too much of a coward to admit how much you like me?”
“I know. Draco came and observed him for hours the other day, and Paeson even let me borrow one of the other owls to demonstrate.” Harry sighed again, holding open the door for Ron before they made their way back downstairs. “I’d hoped it would go away with time, but apparently not.”
“I’m telling you, ‘Mione, if they’re having sex on my bed, you might have to stop me from killing them.” Ron took his arm from around his girlfriend’s shoulders to make a strangling motion. Hermione just rolled her eyes at him.
“Alright, okay.” Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder to see students starting to pour out of the Great Hall. He grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze. “Owl me the details.”
He knew why, of course. His nightmares had stopped the week before. Now his nights were blissfully quiet, not even interrupted with dreams. It was incredible. Amazing. His shoulders felt the lightest they had done, ever.
Malfoy snorted. “What do you mean, what am I doing with Neville? All I did was help him with his notes.” He leaned forwards, scrutinising Harry’s face. “Merlin’s tits. Are you jealous, Potter?”
The rage she had felt 6 years ago still boiled in her veins, this time accompanied by the justice she was about to deliver.
The other man groaned, opening his eyes blearily. “Draco?” He held his hand out and the blond walked forwards to take it. He pulled him in, lifting up the duvet with his other hand. Draco crawled in beside him. “Turn.” Harry grumbled, and he did as he was told, putting his back to him. Apparently, Harry wanted to be big spoon. “Better.” He mumbled, before his breaths quickly fell into a more rhythmic pace.
Harry sighed and shook his head, moving onto the tomatoes. A sharp snap sounded across the room, and then Kreacher’s long, bony fingers were sliding the packet of cheese across the counter towards him.
Harry turned to her, trying to calm his racing heart. It’s not as if she was a legilimens, she couldn’t read his mind. His Malfoy filled mind. “Um, yeah. I don’t know why I never thought about her being Malfoy's aunt.”
He heard a soft clink behind him, and turned to see the door swinging shut behind him, a steaming mug of tea on the floor. He offered a soft sigh to the musical hootings around him, resigning himself to the amount of owl droppings he needed to clean. If the press could only see him now.
The next few weeks passed in a blur. Harry dedicated his spare time to tackling the upper rooms of Grimmauld Place, feeling more energised and motivated than usual. The second floor housed what was once the grand bedroom and its accompanying private sitting room and ensuite, as well as two other spare rooms and a bathroom. The third floor housed Sirius’ and Regulus’ old rooms and their shared bathroom as well as the two smallest spare rooms and another bathroom. The whole place was huge, far too big for just him, but when he had mentioned this to his friends as they caught up over a pint, they reminded him of all the potential it had. He was currently tossing around ideas of Teddy’s own room, a games room, maybe even a home cinema.
