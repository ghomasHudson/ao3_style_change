“Well there goes the last of the summer weather,” Harry sighed. He had been quite enjoying the warm evenings and the makeshift barbeque area that Benny Hardwick and Michael Corner had set up behind the back of the house annexe.
“Who’s ‘him’?” Sirius asked, looking nonplussed.
“It’s nothing to worry about,” Luna smiled, “it’s not like contractions have started.”
about the courgette muffins but this is my
, so let’s see if we can nip somewhere to buy some fresh clothes okay?”
He guessed the alpha probably wouldn’t necessarily appreciate that comparison given Draco was still at school.
“Right,” Harry nodded, “sorry. I didn’t see anything.” Harry rolled his eyes at himself, there was no way Draco was going to believe that.
Harry looked back at Colum, the beta was tall and fit with strong shoulders and a cheeky smile. The way he had been dancing showed how well he could move, his body toned and sinuous. Six months ago, Harry would have said yes in a heartbeat. They would have apparated back to Pimlico and probably fallen over each other in their haste to disrobe, touching every inch of sweaty skin they could reach. Colum raised his eyebrows expectantly.
“You d-don’t have to come with me,” Draco glanced at Harry as they entered the bright and airy ward.
A lot of alphas might be annoyed their omega was paying so much attention to something like Potions work, wanting them to concentrate on more domestic affairs. But Draco didn’t think Harry would be like that, he imagined the alpha smiling down at him proudly, his green eyes twinkling.
“I see,” Madam Pomfrey frowned critically at Draco’s chest, causing Harry to do the same. Draco flushed as he tried to pull his sweater down a bit further to cover the lace frill of his bralette. He knew it was a little silly, Harry had already seen him in his underwear the previous night. “Well the best thing to do is massage them a bit and let some of the milk come out.”
“I can take it back,” Harry growled as Draco pretended to be very interested in pulling on his new jumper. Sure enough, the previously circus tent sized sweater began to suck inwards until it was the perfect fit, snug but not too tight.
“No!” Draco gasped, looking horrified.
“Just l-let me through,” Draco shouted to be heard above the ruckus.
“Merlin, you’re so wet,” Harry gasped delightedly as slick ran down his shaft in waves of sweet honeydew. “So wet for me sweetheart.”
The omega’s breasts were slightly less swollen than they had been due to Lyra regularly feeding. However they were still gently curved out from his chest, pink nipples peaking as Harry ran his fingers across them, pinching teasingly.
“I think I’ve p-put the rotor together wrong,” Draco frowned, his lips coming together in a pout. “My paddles are wonky.”
“Don’t be a berk,” Harry chuckled. “You know she’s mad about you.”
“I –I –“ Draco began before Harry could bear it no more and he let himself collapse into a delighted peal of laughter.
Ron pulled a face at the word ‘womb’ and Harry couldn’t help but internally agree. What the fuck had happened in Harry’s life for him to be suddenly requiring reading material about ‘wombs’?
“Blimey Mione, the kid’s only two weeks pregnant, I’m sure he can manage the stairs by himself,” Ron huffed.
“That’s what the spell does,” Remus concluded, his eyes widening with realisation. “It allows you to keep some part of the beloved in your life.”
“How about I go and get us all another coffee?” Katie’s voice piped up cheerfully.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned ruefully, “can you imagine the fights in the Potter household? Sirius told me they were legendary. At one point he even stayed with them when his mum kicked him out of Grimmauld Place. Now that is just too much alpha ego under one roof.”
“You d-didn’t bite me,” Draco murmured as Harry sagged in understanding and quickly gathered the younger boy up in his arms, holding him close and nuzzling into his hair.
In the middle of one particularly rowdy group, Draco spotted Harry Potter. The man was pretty famous around the school, being the son of war heroes and a powerful alpha wizard in his own right. Not to mention that Harry was horribly attractive with unruly jet black hair and piercing green eyes. Whilst the alphas in Draco’s year liked to strut about as if they owned the place, Harry Potter was most definitely a grown man with five o’ clock shadow and muscled bulk.
“No,” Draco pouted, “I’m making a m-mess.”
“Do you want me to take a look?” The woman with the plait asked, coming over to Draco and gesturing for him to sit back on the bed. “I’m training to be a healer, my name’s Padma.”
“You okay with the crowds?” Harry asked, nudging Draco’s side and wrapping his fingers around Draco’s mitten clad hand.
“We’ve cancelled that St. Mungo’s Healer your headmistress called for,” the man announced. “You know if one of them gets a whiff of this it’ll be all across the London gossip rags by lunchtime. We’ve arranged for Healer Schmidt to come sort you out instead, she knows where her bread’s buttered.”
“Why not?” Harry frowned, “Look, being an alpha means I
“Am I sick?” Draco asked, lifting up his small, slender hands to place them on his belly. “Is the baby okay?”
“How many times did it take before it stuck?” Thomas Knocklelby, a particularly dim-witted alpha Gryffindor asked, gesturing crudely to Draco’s stomach.
“Harry,” Professor McGonagall said loudly in a clear warning tone.
Draco made another affronted sound, scrambling about on Harry’s lap before they both let out distressed shouts as the movement tugged at the knot.
“Bloody hell,” Ron announced loudly, causing a ripple of laughter to go through the assembled guests.
A few minutes later, after managing to collect himself and having used up a fair few sheets of toilet roll as tissues, Draco walked back out to find Harry leaning against the wall, waiting for him. The alpha’s eyes were closed and he had a contented look on his face. Upon hearing Draco, Harry’s green eyes cracked open and he gave the omega a soft smile.
“I don’t like it,” Draco muttered petulantly, starting to shiver in the ice bath.
“Yeah of course, give me a minute,” Harry told him, standing up and starting to pull off the red hoodie he was wearing.
Draco left him to his experiments as he hurried back to the Gaedere annexe for his scheduled revision session with Hermione.
“Oh!” Draco exclaimed in surprise.
^*^*^*^*^
“Oh,” Draco lowered his eyes, looking pleased.
was me trying to do the right thing. Siphoning you my magic and making sure you ate alright for those first couple of months,
“Very handsome,” Draco murmured instead, fighting the blush that rose up on his cheeks and hoping he could blame it on the fire.
“That’ll be all those pregnant omega hormones in the air,” Ron rolled his eyes before they widened and he turned quickly to Hermione.
Harry felt momentarily bitter that Hermione would know that, having touched Draco a lot more than Harry had over the last couple of months.
“How far along are you?” the third woman, who Draco assumed must be Felicity asked. She had mermaid dyed hair and a daisy chain tattoo around her wrist.
By the time Harry got back to the Gaedere annexe, his head was pleasantly buzzed from the beer and he was in a far better mood. Perhaps Neville had been onto something with his walks.
“Yeah, but I didn’t say anything about the spell,” Harry replied. “You know Sirius…I mean I love him, he’s great but…”
“Oh I have an internship in product design for Caulderwells,” Katie announced proudly. Harry recognised the company name; they were one of the leading manufacturers of cauldrons and potions equipment.
After Harry had established that only the icicles hanging from the roof contained alcohol, he bought them a purple one and a sunshine coloured one.
Harry wondered how Draco and Hermione were doing. The omega had seemed a little disappointed when Harry had explained he was going out. Harry had left whilst Draco and Hermione were halfway through bullet points on 17
Getting to know Harry better had been an interesting experience. On the one hand, Draco was relieved to find that the alpha was kind and patient and would undoubtedly make a good father. On the other hand, the more Draco learned about Harry, the more he fell hopelessly in love with him.
“That’s no problem,” Harry replied, casting a spell that opened up one of the kingsize sheets and domed it upwards like a parachute.
Draco still couldn’t believe the alpha was letting him keep the baby. Before Draco had found out that Harry had medical custody over Draco, he had been trying to think of ways to convince Bella to let him stay pregnant. It wasn’t that Draco had anything against termination, in fact he was very pro-choice, especially for omegas. It was more that ever since he had found out about the baby growing inside of him, Draco had already fallen in love with the idea of it.
“Yes,” Snape bit out miserably. “But spells like that never work how you want them to. Fickle genies listening to ill formed wishes. Draco had no idea the spell would cause him to get pregnant with Harry’s child, but the magic sensed his loneliness, his desire for a family, and so that’s what it gave him. It gave him a part of Harry to keep.”
“I mean seriously,” Harry rolled his eyes, “I got Es and Os in every other subject.”
The teenagers were on a beach somewhere, with Sirius leaning nonchalantly against a rock with his hands suspiciously hidden behind his back. The two girls were striking poses on the sand. One of the girls Draco didn’t recognise, although there was something strangely familiar about her face. She almost looked like Bellatrix, but her hair was lighter and her eyes the wrong colour.
That was probably the wrong thing to say as Draco immediately looked anxiously down at Harry’s still swollen cock.
“Yes,” Remus nodded, his eyes softening, “Draco is going to be given full access to his inheritance.”
“I – I love it,” Draco sniffed loudly as Harry summoned a handkerchief and passed it to the still weeping omega. Draco blew his nose before tilting his tear stained face up at Harry.
“Remus will deal with him,” Harry grinned, thinking of how after seventeen years, his godfathers were still absolutely enamoured with each other. He looked fondly down at Draco, watching as the omega fussed over Lyra, carefully wiping the bubbles from her skin. With a rising swell of absolute contentment Harry knew he and Draco would be the same, ten, twenty, fifty years from now, growing old together in this house with family and friends surrounding them.
“A little,” Draco blurted out accidentally before his eyes widened. Harry however, just let out a low laugh, reaching across the table to clasp Draco’s hands in his own.
Draco’s face started to burn as he bit the inside of his cheek.
“Gonna have so many more babies with you,” Harry grunted, angling his cock upwards and hitting Draco’s insides in a way that sent fireworks off inside of him. “Make you always like this, swollen with my seed.”
Harry smirked smugly as he took another sip of his Ogden’s, ice cold thanks to a chilling charm.
“Mm,” Draco nodded, “I think it would be nice, but…” Draco trailed off unsurely, wondering if he would come across as needy or pressuring if he asked for what he truly wanted.
“Mm,” Draco nodded, he had already checked twice in the mirror that the maternity gown was sitting nicely over his bump and didn’t just make him look like a distended hippopotamus.
“I love you Draco,” Harry stated quietly. The muffliato on their section of the ward must have finally fizzled out as Harry could hear Madam Pomfrey busying herself with changing one of the beds. “Thank you for having our baby.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione sighed, “you know you’re going to have to put up with a lot more than that once the rest of school finds out.”
“I can’t,” Harry grimaced miserably, “Madam Pomfrey’s got him on bed rest for the next three days.”
Harry felt relieved as Draco nodded and gave him a shy smile. “You got anything in there like those magazines you liked?” Harry asked. He knew Draco had also brought a picture of his mother but he hadn’t shown it to Harry yet.
Draco raised his eyebrows as his aunt fell silent for a moment, the waiter had returned to their table and delivered their food. Draco looked miserably down at his broccoli soup, his aunt had always tried to curb his love of sweet treats. Bellatrix believed that omegas were prone to negative effects from too much of a good thing and shouldn’t be spoiled.
“That’s brilliant!” Harry beamed, “Cheers Remus.”
Draco inhaled sharply, his eyes flicking nervously away for a moment before he reached down and cautiously began lifting up his gown. Harry swallowed thickly as he watched the silk slide up Draco’s legs, revealing more and more of his pale thighs. Draco hesitated for a moment before hiking the skirt up completely to his belly, exposing his lower body to the cool room.
“Oh yeah,” Harry laughed grimly, “as you can imagine he’s well chuffed him and Remus are going to be grandparents already.”
“That’s okay Mr. Potter,” the boy replied, chewing on his lip.
“Do you like it?” Harry asked from where he was sat on the thick Persian rug by the tree. Even Sirius and Remus’ Christmas tree was some sort of contemporary art piece that fit in with the industrial aesthetic of their loft. It was composed of bent wires and hanging light bulbs in red and green.
“Harry,” Draco said before bursting into violent sobs. Harry cursed himself, he had known it was a risk buying a house without Draco’s opinion but he had so badly wanted to it to be a nice surprise. He had spent months carefully extracting from Draco, Katie, Hermione and even sodding Snape what Draco’s ideal future would look like.
“O-Oh,” Draco gasped, a little surprised. “It’s okay, it’s only my lower back that aches.”
Harry and some of the other older students were out helping Hagrid stable the pregnant thestrals away from the ravages of the thunderstorm. Draco winced as a particularly loud clash echoed across the landscape, rumbling like a Hebridean Black. He cast another tempus and chewed on his lip anxiously, Harry had left about an hour ago and Draco really hoped the alpha wasn’t still in the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest with the elements as they were.
Along with those, there were about ten more animals that Harry was pairing up to various witches or wizards that they knew. Draco bit his lip, emotion taking over him as he realised there was also a small note still mixed up with the wrapping paper. He recognised Hermione’s writing;
Draco stared at a small tube of tinted strawberry lip gloss that had fallen out of his Christmas Day cracker, before deciding to dab a little onto his lips using the tip of one finger. Draco stared at his reflection and couldn’t help but finally feel a little pleased with the result. He hurried out of the bedroom to where Sirius, Remus and Harry were waiting for him by the front door and tried not to let his face match his pinafore as both Harry and Remus gave him compliments.
“Yes,” Snape’s gaze fell to his knees as he nodded. “She was my best friend.”
“The lemon and poppy seed please,” Draco said, “wait – also a chocolate muffin, actually could I have a Florentine?”
Eventually, they reached a bed curtained off from view, behind which Harry could definitely smell the acrid fragrance of an omega in distress, it was like rust and acid and stuck unpleasantly in his nostrils.
Harry paused, looking down the corridor towards the Morgana Suite, the lights were clearly lit inside as there was a faint orange glow underneath the door. Harry frowned and padded down the hallway to knock on the door.
“I just wanted to check, that’s all,” Remus was saying, in his best diplomatic tone of voice.
on Earth had he done that? What godforsaken demon had momentarily possessed him?
Not for the first time, Harry’s teeth had itched with the desire to sink themselves into Draco’s shoulder, marking him as bonded. Harry felt pangs of possessiveness every time he so much as looked at Draco now. His inner alpha couldn’t understand the problem, the omega was already swollen with Harry’s child, why not go the extra step and claim him?
“Goodness gracious,” Madam Pomfrey clicked her tongue as she rushed over, “I swear I get more accidents from these Saturday morning practices than during the entire week put together.”
“Not to mention he was hurt,” Hermione added.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned as Hermione rolled her eyes and smiled back at him. “It’s been brilliant. Do you reckon the guests will mind if we don’t come down for another half hour or so?”
“Sometimes,” Draco shifted, “I heard the other omegas in Slytherin talking…they said alphas d-don’t do that for omegas.”
“Blimey,” Harry chuckled as the snowman’s spindly twig arm politely doffed his top hat in Draco’s direction.
Draco felt bad, he knew Harry had spent a lot of money on the clothes and the truth was that Draco loved them. He was just apprehensive about what other people might think, despite Harry’s reassurance that their opinions didn’t matter.
“Only the ones that look like they might be here a while,” Olive retorted knowingly, nodding her head towards where Draco had still forgotten to close his mouth.
“He was hurt?!” Harry’s voice was loud again and there was a scratching sound as if someone had just jumped up from a chair.
hands upon the omega’s porcelain skin. Harry hated that even more.
“So I keep hearing,” Harry muttered, finishing the last of his beer and reaching for a new can.
Kidding
^*^*^*^*^
“Draco, this one is from Ron and Hermione but they did tell me it’s for the baby and they hope that’s okay,” Harry explained, passing the younger boy an oddly shaped package. On the wrapping paper, small plump Father Christmases were diving down chimneys only to get stuck, their little black boots waggling in the air. Draco opened the gift carefully to reveal a charmed baby mobile.
“How come?” Colum frowned but still looked amused.
“Right,” Harry nodded, “yeah, okay then.” He stood up and stretched, cracking his spine satisfyingly from side to side.
“Fuck off!” Harry roared, jerking to his feet. Draco yelped as the alpha inadvertently knocked the bowl of soup, uncomfortably hot liquid soiling Draco’s robes and prickling his thighs.
“Then I’d say you’ve become a complete arsehole,” Ron replied slowly after a moment. “Don’t you think the poor kid’s life is messed up enough already without you using him for your jollies? What happens after you’ve got it out of your system?”
“So, as I was saying,” Harry stated firmly, trying to avoid Professor McGonagall’s questioning gaze. “I am now Draco’s legal alpha, not you.”
“Of course I do!” Hermione screeched, lifting her hands up. “I’ve being going on about the way we treat omegas for years, not that anybody listens to me,” she muttered under her breath.
“I see,” Harry replied, realising he had been thinking of the ‘Bookman’ family who were convicted three years ago of mass muggle cannibalism in Florida. It was probably a good thing that wasn’t who Damien was having over for Christmas.
“Um, that looks nice? Maybe a little big?” Harry frowned.
“Sirius, this one’s for you from me and Draco,” Harry was reading the labels of the various gifts and distributing to the other men.
“I doubt that’s the whole truth,” Snape sniffed, crossing his legs and causing a bony knee to protrude through his black robes like some misshapen lump of coal. Harry frowned and glanced back to his godfather who was eyeing Snape wearily.
^♥*♡^♥*♡^♥*^♥*♡^
Another effect of the bond that was starting to materialise was that Harry could sense Draco’s emotional state, even more than he normally could from scents. Despite still being unconscious, Harry knew that Draco was feeling safe and satisfied. Harry wondered just how far the bond would go, if he would be able to sense if his omega was suffering from a nightmare or even a slight pang of discomfort. The idea pleased Harry greatly, that he might always be able to make sure his partner was happy and untroubled.
“I see,” Remus mused thoughtfully as Harry remembered where he was and immediately sought to curb the telling pheromones he had been giving off. It was obviously too late however, especially for Remus’ werewolf nose and the other man walked over to crack open a window with an amused expression.
Harry tried to push down the wave of irritation he felt at the idea of his friends talking about his and Draco’s sex life.
“What?” Draco heard Harry’s panicked voice as the man himself appeared by the changing room, looking Draco up and down.
Harry sat on the stone bench by the herb gardens, watching as May-bugs flocked to a nearby patch of wild cow parsley. The white frothy heads of the weeds were bowing under the collective weight of the surge of spring insects.
“Nah, love the stuff,” Harry grinned. “Only one time I turned down a plate because I knew Romilda Vane had drenched it in Amortentia.”
“They would if they knew how I got pregnant,” Draco said miserably.
“That doesn’t sound like a good idea,” Harry frowned as Draco’s face fell as if he had been scolded. “I just mean, it might not be good for you, something tight like that. Maybe we should try and find an alternative?”
“He’s
wasn’t exactly replying to my letters,” Remus stated pointedly. “Besides, I’m sure if it had been James who had been related to Draco, we would have told you earlier.”
“Did you fight a lot?” Draco asked, still trying to paint a better informed picture of the men he was soon to meet.
“You want Daddy to make love to you in our new bedroom? Fill you up with my thick cock, have you ride me right here on the floor?”
“And,” Harry continued, barrelling on anyway, “if Draco wants to keep the baby, I say he can.”
“He’ll need my magic though,” Harry replied, “male omega pregnancies can be a lot for the body and Draco’s already pretty weak looking.”
“Hey!” Harry protested weakly, still feeling rather shell shocked. “I’m telling you, I haven’t slept with a single omega...” he trailed off at Professor McGonagall’s expression, “
Draco blinked up into Harry’s concerned expression, realizing that the alpha was cradling Draco’s face tenderly as if inspecting him for any signs of injury.
Harry regretfully pulled away, realising that perhaps he
“You’re choosing studying with a seventeen year old over a night of clubbing and alcoholic debauchery?” Ron looked completely confused. “Mate, I know for certain that both Gabby Baldan and Colum Tidewell had the hots for you and they’re both going to be there, single and imbibing copious amounts of Tequila.”
Draco frowned quizzically at his aunt. She was looking wholly smug as she gestured to Draco’s exposed neck. “He hasn’t bothered to bond with you.”
“I’m okay,” Draco replied, he was actually feeling pretty hungry that morning. “I’m just too fat for my clothes.”
“Which apothecary?” Severus asked, his expression still unreadable.
Harry laughed fondly before leaning in to rub their noses together, “Don’t you? You should, it’d be cute.” He repositioned himself on the bed, nuzzling his face against Draco’s belly. “Hello Baby, I can’t wait to meet you.” Harry glanced up to where Draco was peering down at him curiously. “You’re going to be a very lucky baby you know? You’ve got the world’s most beautiful papa and your daddy is going to be a complete pushover when it comes to you both.”
“Nothing,” Draco grinned, his omega once again temporarily placated as he snuggled forwards and let the scents of bonfire and cinnamon lull him to sleep.
Harry pulled a face in response and looked over across the Great Lake, it was late afternoon and the landscape was a little misty.
Harry tried not to snort, thinking of how Fleur’s omega cousin had regularly paraded around their holiday villa in hot pants and a bikini top. There was something so lovely about Draco’s excitement at the prospect of being ‘daring’ that Harry didn’t want to say anything to the contrary.
“I’m going to assume that’s a name?” Harry questioned as Snape’s cheeks coloured further in anger.
“That feel good sweetheart?” Harry asked, pistoning his fingers in and out of the younger boy. “You like having Daddy inside you?”
“I’m serious you berk,” Ginny half snapped, shoving at Harry’s legs. “Sometimes I think you forget my mum’s an omega. I know what it’s like okay? I just wanted to let you know that there’s no hard feelings.”
“Crikey, yeah, didn’t even think of that,” his friend murmured.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted angrily.
The four women stepped back to give Draco space enough to change, chatting pleasantly to each other about the upcoming winter celebrations down in Hogsmeade when the door slammed open again. The scent of alpha rapidly flooded the room with bonfire and cinnamon.
“Like it matters,” the woman snapped, “he took a fancy to you at our Beltane party two years ago and keeps writing letters that are most promising.”
“Yeah? Well I’m actually Voldemort reincarnated,” Harry stated as Draco gasped and jerked his head to look up at him.
Harry nodded as the two of them began to stroll down the walkway, the odd town whizzing past them through the windows.
Draco let out a small noise as Harry closed his hand into a fist before sticking out two thick fingers, allowing Draco to guide them into himself. Eventually the strain became too much and Draco collapsed back against the fluffy pillows, sweat dripping down his temple as Harry’s digits breached him.
“I didn’t!” Draco whined unhappily. “I t-told you, it was a spell!”
“Bloody hell,” Ron exclaimed, his eyes widening, “your little omega’s a genius.”
Draco scrunched his nose up in confusion and cocked his head, Hermione had always told him to be patient with Harry’s long winded explanations but this one was particularly hard to decipher.
“Alpha,” Draco whispered as Harry snapped into action, striding across to the bed, his pupils large and inky.
Harry hissed as his heated body was enveloped by the freezing water, he wandlessly cast another chilling spell to make sure he didn’t raise the temperature of the bath too much so as to not be as effective in helping the feverish omega. Harry wrapped his arms carefully around Draco’s bump before letting the younger boy’s head loll back against his chest.
hate me, but I
Draco frowned as load of Fifth Years poured out from the classroom in question, apparently there had been a late room change. Draco found himself stranded in the sea of grumbling students.
“Draco,” Harry repeated, a little louder this time as the younger boy fell silent. “You’re misunderstanding me. I don’t want to bring home a mate because I’d like to mate with
“Those are all the things I’ve c-craved since being pregnant,” Draco said in astonishment, catching Harry blushing as he busied himself with the knife.
“Gorgeous,” Harry smiled. “I’ll just rinse myself and then may I join you?”
“Right,” Harry sighed, levering out of bed and shuffling over to Dean’s trunk, rooting around before pulling out the sapphire blue vial.
“Just like them,” Harry laughed, “You want seven kids then?”
“We’ll explain in a moment,” Remus told Harry, quickly stepping back and ushering for them to come in out of the cold weather.
Draco cringed as the silence finally burst, most of the room dissipating into frenzied conversations and conjecture. Draco could hear the odd words and phrases;
The boy leant over to peer down the ward as if trying to catch sight of Draco.
Draco turned to face Harry with a look of confusion, “Why w-would she want to meet me?”
Harry pulled back the curtain as his eyes went wide, immediately yanking it shut behind him. Draco was sat up in the bed, bare chested, his usual bralette already removed. Harry had definitely been expecting the omega to still be wearing his underwear and was stunned that Draco had been okay with letting the older alpha in here.
The younger boy remained asleep, his nose occasionally wrinkling and his breath warm and calm, but he was most definitely purring. Low and quiet against Harry’s chest, he could feel Draco’s throat vibrating. When a loud ringing went off and the purring stopped, Harry had a momentary urge to hurl his alarm into the bottom of the Great Lake.
“You go ahead,” Remus smiled, “I think I might take advantage of Professor Sprout’s generosity and harvest some of this fabulous rosemary and mint for mine and Sirius’ Sunday Roast.”
Draco sat stiffly in the Charms classroom. Professor Flitwick was droning on about areas of effect within casting but none of the students were paying him attention. In fact a lot of them seemed to be shooting furtive looks in Draco’s direction.
“Ah,” Harry winced guiltily. “Um, that’s actually another thing I haven’t mentioned. Severus Snape is Draco’s godfather.”
“I told you –“ Harry began as Hermione clucked her tongue frustratedly.
“A little,” Draco admitted, “I cast a warming charm and I think I accidentally got your chocolate frogs because they feel all s-squidgy.”
Harry quickly sat down on the bed beside Draco and drew the omega tightly into his arms.
Harry blinked in surprise at the trolley lady who had just slid open the door, a box of seasonal charity chocolate frogs in her hand.
“Now for my next trick!” Seamus announced as the custard balloon bulged and began to transform into a giraffe. The creature’s neck continued to extend, however, becoming like string cheese, whilst the giraffe’s belly expanded ominously.
“You go on ahead,” Hermione told him. “Draco and I will be there in a bit.”
“Don’t know what the fuck Ginny is going to say,” Ron stated grimly.
“But why?” Harry continued, clearly wanting Draco to think this through.
“I think you broke him,” Katie snorted, leaning down to plant a sticky kiss on Draco’s cheek before wandering over to her boyfriend Nick.
Draco folded in on himself slightly as the group’s eyes widened upon seeing Harry’s hand, still resting on the back of Draco’s neck.
“Okay,” Harry laughed, “I get the picture, why don’t you all take a seat and I’m sure you’ll be fixed up in a moment.”
The cylindrical bolster cushions he used to create columns, from which Draco draped sheets and shirts. To avoid collapse, he wound more blankets around the base. It took a great deal of effort but when Draco stepped back to observe his first nesting attempt he found himself frowning. For some reason it looked rudimentary and amateurish. Draco was sure it was silly to think that there was a superior art of nesting but he was getting slightly teary and frustrated as the whole endeavour was starting to highlight his long held insecurities over being a sub-par omega.
Harry grabbed Smith’s collar and jerked him forwards, Smith yelping as his injured nose banged against Harry’s.
“You know I had to write an essay on love potion unions last year,” a strawberry blonde girl announced to anyone who was listening, “and apparently any offspring born from them will come out wrong.”
Harry tore his eyes away from Draco’s animated face to look down at the pretty buckle up shoes in a shiny powder blue colour.
“She’s not my girlfriend,” Harry snapped. “Plus, she’s with Dean now and quite frankly I’m a little miffed you guys are acting as if I went and actually bedded a seventeen year old omega!”
Before Draco had considered any kind of intelligent response, Harry was striding away and Draco was left staring at his broad back and onyx hair with the scent of bonfire lingering in the air.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded awkwardly, wondering if it would be rude to bring his hand up to his nose to try and block it out?
^*^*^*^*^
“Likely story,” the woman laughed, “brat probably slicked up for the first alpha that looked at him.”
Draco blushed as he realised what he had said, his godfather pausing whilst weighing out ingredients.
Harry quickly checked to see that Draco was completely dry. Katie was laughing and clutching at the grinning omega whilst Hermione very loudly began to lecture Seamus about the laws of transmutative magi-physics.
“Ronald, I swear if I ever get pregnant you are not allowed within ten feet of the delivery room,” Harry could hear Hermione snap as he and Draco tried to suppress their giggles.
Draco’s breath wavered as he slid his eyes back to Harry, keeping his head angled. Draco opened his mouth before closing it again as if he wasn’t sure what to say.
“Yeah?” Harry asked.
“Oh Draco,” Snape hissed through his teeth. “What have you
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, turning round and laying his hands as gently as he could on Draco’s exposed shoulders.
“Damien, I’m going to walk away now. You are a very silly immature boy, but perhaps you’ve been raised that way or had pressure put on you. I know as well as you do that you’re lying about Draco and I’d appreciate it if you stopped. If I start hearing any version of this nonsense spreading across the school I will know exactly who to send my lawyer’s letter to. You see my godfather works in legal affairs and I had an interesting chat with him recently about slander.”
“Can’t you go bother Ron or something?” Harry huffed, “I’m trying to get dressed here.”
“Oh,” Madam Pomfrey looked a little surprised, she paused before nodding and exiting the cubicle. Harry could hear her scolding some Fourth Year for changing the colour of their friend’s sling.
“He looked alright,” the third woman shrugged, “Pretty dress.”
“That would be me,” Harry continued, as if the Lestranges were in any doubt. Rodolphus had turned a strange shade of purple whilst Bellatrix’s nostrils were flaring like a racehorse. Harry could immediately scent that she was the other alpha here. The Hospital Wing door swung open a second later as Snape marched in, followed by a worried looking Madam Pomfrey and a tired looking Professor McGonagall.
“Oh the hot one!” Ron clicked his fingers in recognition before cringing over at Harry. Hermione exhaled slowly through her nose before rising up and storming towards the loos.
“Right,” Katie began, “Do you think you did well on the paper – yes or no?”
Draco lifted his head up and licked his lips, Harry helped him get up so they could both peer into the trolley’s wide selection.
“Actually,” Remus cleared his throat, “there’s one more, it’s only small but something Sirius found the other day. This is for you Draco, from us.”
Harry frowned, taking another step forwards.
“A patio,” Draco huffed, crossing his arms over himself.
At the start of the third floor, Draco turned down the corridor leading towards the library. He could see a group of students waiting outside the Charms classroom, Venetia Dawson was among them and as soon as she spotted Draco, her and her friends fell silent.
“I guess so,” Ron exhaled wearily, “but have you seen some of these project titles? This is some heavy theory.”
“I know,” Harry sighed, slumping down and taking his hands away from his face to see his friends’ sympathetic expressions.
“Y-Yes,” Draco had stammered, cursing his nervous stutter and sweating palms.
“From where?” Harry screwed up his face.
“H-Harry?!” Draco asked in a panicked tone of voice.
“Oh,” Olive made a happy noise beside Harry. “Just like your mother, sweetheart.”
“The bus turned up quicker than usual,” Harry grinned, “Stan’s back from holiday.”
“What?” Hermione snapped. “Draco appears to be an excellent student fully capable of catching up, unlike you and Ronald when you constantly begged off to go play quidditch during
Draco was grateful that Severus was all for him continuing his studies. Draco was fascinated by potions, often poring over his godfather’s old ingredients journals and trying out new things. The loneliness Draco felt had become rather oppressive though the more his omega side came into full maturity.
Draco let out a shaky exhale of breath as he drew his hands away from his very miserable looking face.
Ron shot Harry a half questioning, half sympathetic look as Harry left the dorm rooms and travelled through the annexe into the main body of the castle. The two of them walked in complete silence as they proceeded down the long stone passageway towards the headmistress’s office.
“No,” Harry said firmly, “and we weren’t together when I found out about your pregnancy either so don’t start worrying. Honestly, she only came to see me this morning to chat about you and boast about her being scouted for the Harpies.”
“Are you still planning on getting the train back to London?” Hermione asked Harry as he nodded.
Draco snorted and laughed as Harry shot him a rueful grin.
that Harry hadn’t touched him, the older man knew that Draco didn’t have any experience in that department and had always been a little nervous around alphas. The last thing Draco wanted was to live up to all the horrible gossip about himself and become a desperate, flaunting omega, trying every trick in the book to get Harry to bond with him.
Draco took it eagerly, he didn’t think he’d ever had as much affectionate touch as he’d had today and it felt like it was warming him from deep inside.
Draco could see now that the building probably did used to be a warehouse. The ground floor seemed to be some sort of garage cum workshop with various muggle vehicles in different states of disrepair. Upstairs, however, was rather magnificent in Draco’s opinion. The stairs led them to an open plan conversion with exposed brick walls and light wooden floors. There was a humungous window looking over the river and letting in plenty of light. A sleek steel finish kitchen boasted an island with tall barstools, dried herbs hanging above the hob. There was a rather indulgent looking area with long leather sofas and a roll down projector screen.
“You w-were in the bathroom,” Draco spoke behind him, the scents of panic and embarrassment filtering through the air. “I thought I had time.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded, chewing on his lip, “I checked n-no one was around before I levitated my trunk in.”
Harry blinked at him before looking round the empty dorm room. “Where is everybody then?”
“Katie’s very excited,” Hermione noted, “I think it’s encouraging her baby fever.”
The three of them filtered onto the lawns a few minutes later, walking down towards the Great Lake as quickly as Draco’s state would allow. Draco gasped as they crested over a small mound and saw what was waiting for them. The little grove under the trees had been decorated with balloons and an enchanted banner reading “Happy Eighteenth Draco!” was hovering above a food laden table.
“T-Thank you for having me in your home,” Draco spoke up, trying to make his voice as stable as possible as he drew out the two bottles of wine and proffered them to Remus.
“I can’t do it!” Draco huffed, jerking Harry’s memories traitorously back to when a similar sentiment was offered in the bathtub the night before.
“Draco Malfoy I am going to ask you three questions, consider it your final exam,” she stated imperiously. Draco nodded and grinned.
“Don’t be scared,” Harry stroked down Draco’s back and younger boy could sense the alpha pushing out calming pheromones. “You know I’ll be careful and stop if you want me to.”
Harry knew he would be welcome to keep staying at Padfoot’s, especially as it was empty for so much of the year whilst his godfathers travelled, but he also felt like he wanted to branch out on his own.
“Um,” Draco cleared his throat, his eyes flicking nervously to Harry. “It’s a little…heavy.”
“Please d-don’t make me get rid of it,” Draco begged as Harry’s mouth fell open in shock.
“Surely you haven’t run out of the feverfew already?” Severus asked. Draco shook his head, he still had two vials left of the anti nausea potion his godfather had concocted specially for him. Draco’s morning sickness had started to hit around mid February and sadly ignored its own nomenclature, striking at all hours of the day and night.
Remus laughed as he attempted to pair together a growing pile of odd socks. “I suppose we behaved rather appallingly earlier. It’s just…we didn’t expect this for you Harry, and then seeing Draco was honestly like stepping back in time for Sirius and I. You know Cissy’s wedding was the last time he ever saw Regulus? It was certainly the last time he and Narcissa exchanged words that weren’t curses.”
Draco pouted at Harry who seemed rather amused by the reaction. “Did you want something from me sweetheart?” Harry asked, running his hands up Draco’s sides and tugging the nightgown with him, exposing the omega completely.
“You alright? You’re sweating,” Harry commented.
“It’s just a bit hard to wrap your head round,” another alpha shrugged. Draco knew he was called Dean Thomas because one of the girls in Seventh Year had a crush on him.
Harry quickly shut the door behind him to shield Draco from view. “It um, looks very nice on you.”
“Are we going home now?” Draco asked miserably, so angry at himself for ruining the whole day. They hadn’t even seen any of the other attractions.
“It’s not,” Harry shook his head, “I want you to feel secure Draco and even if that means we bond right now I’ll be happy to do it. Bellatrix is wrong, I’m not stalling or trying to avoid doing it.”
“You mixed up Thistlemilk and Bowtruckle bile!” Snape snapped.
“Oh you poor dear,” she tutted, “I remember how it is, in fact my daughter Pippa is going through the same thing – I recommend buying a heated wheat bag from Cobblepebbles on Diagon. They’ve got a great selection of nice smelling ones too, like lavender, or I think for a little extra they can infuse the wheat with a sample of your alpha’s scent.”
In fact, Harry’s views on omegas seemed to be wildly different to the ones Draco had experienced growing up with the Lestranges. Any omega was going to be lucky if Harry became their alpha.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, relaxing slightly and slowing down. McGonagall, however, still looked rather sombre as she perfunctorily gestured the way for Harry to follow her.
him?” Harry roared, the sound ricocheting through his chest as Draco whined and buried closer into Harry, stuffing his nose against the alpha’s coat. “You fucking
“Really?” Harry paused. “Molly’s not mad at me?”
Harry might have actually bought it if Damien’s scent wasn’t still broadcasting complete satisfied confidence.
“P-Please leave,” Draco whimpered. He had now managed to cover his chest with his elbows and plastered his hands against his face, completely concealing him from Harry’s view.
Harry felt himself moving forwards before his brain could fully catch up. He pulled back the curtain to three shocked faces. A tall, raven haired woman with a jagged scar across her throat, a stout man in a burgundy waistcoat and Draco, whose face was horribly puffy and swollen.
Draco was wearing pyjamas, they were the set that Harry had found in his own maze present and decided to transfigure so as to fit the omega. Harry hadn’t really liked the idea of Draco walking around the house in one of his usual nightgowns. The trousers and shirt were made of a tartan patterned flannel in chequered squares of dark blue and wine red. Much to Harry’s pleasure, they also looked nice and warm. Although the heating charms at Padfoot’s seemed to be a lot more effective than those in the Gaedere annexe.
Harry nodded, he had already thought all this through with Hermione. They would make sure that one of them, or at least one of the other girls that had so taken to Draco, would be with him at all times in shared common areas. The rest of the time, Draco would either be in class or in the Morgana Suite which was well equipped with a study. Professor McGonagall had even helped transfigure a small kitchenette area so that Draco could cook if he didn’t fancy the Great Hall or bothering the house elves.
“Yeah, sorry, should have warned you it does that. I think it’s worse because you’re so small. Do you want a hand sitting back up?”
at him.
“Yeah eventually,” Harry snorted, “although turns out that pregnant mares have quite a temper on them.” Harry paused and glanced up at Draco with a smirk, “You’re basically an angel in comparison.”
Harry managed to find them a comfortable, empty apartment on the Hogwarts Express, letting out a threatening growl whenever another student tried to slide open the door and join them. Every time Harry sent some eighteen year old alpha scuttling, he noticed that Draco would hide a small smile in his sleeve.
“He’s pregnant,” Snape hissed, jumping to his feet, his black cloak billowing behind him.
“Oh you know Neville,” Dean smirked, “probably communing with the trees or something.”
“Seems to be healthy,” Harry replied, “Madam Pomfrey says everything’s on track.”
“Y-You really think so?” Draco looked so incredibly earnest that Harry found himself nodding vociferously. “Aunt Bella thinks these types of clothes are…” Draco trailed off, casting his eyes downwards and his scent changing from apples.
“No,” Draco shook his head, “I want to get to the centre of the maze.”
“You’re an omega and a pregnant one at that so I highly doubt any one will have any complaints,” Hermione reassured him. “I’ll find you some clothes to change into and then we’ll sort out your burns okay?”
“And you,” Ginny sighed, turning back to Harry, “go find Draco and explain. If it goes badly just send a patronus and I’ll come and back you up okay?”
“Hi Olive,” Harry grinned ruefully, “Audrey was telling me all about your store opening the last time I was over at the Burrow so I figured I might stop by if that’s alright?”
“Harry Potter!” Olive called out angrily as Draco hurriedly picked up a decorative woven blanket from the back of a nearby chair and covered himself with it.
The trolley lady’s face morphed into a sympathetic expression as Harry scented that she was an omega herself.
“Hey Draco, would you like me to take a picture of you and Harry?” Katie asked, coming back over, “Nick’s lent me his camera and I thought we could recreate that nice photo of your mum and dad on their engagement day, it looks like it was taken right about here – that’s the same tree right?”
Draco knew Harry hadn’t told his family about the spell. What made it even worse was that Draco had read that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin had been in the Order of the Phoenix and wouldn’t exactly have pleasant associations with the Malfoy name.
“Say no more,” Harry grinned, “I don’t think anyone could begrudge me not being able to keep my hands off my new husband after seeing him walk down the aisle like that.”
“Oh yes,” Remus replied, his voice slightly strained, “Harry let me know yesterday so I doubled up on portions.”
“Nice to meet you,” Harry nodded, “did you want the bathroom?”
The thing about having grown up already semi-famous and then becoming quite popular on top of that, was that Harry had always been rather hesitant to get too involved with people he didn’t already know very well. He glanced down the table, whilst he had lots of friends and was never short of social engagements, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to start branching out and showing more of an interest in other people’s lives.
and –“
“At least you can all nest together,” Hermione said thoughtfully, “you’ll need to do that a lot during the pregnancy.”
“Oh sweetheart,” Harry sighed, his chest welling with sympathy. He fucking
“Are you alright?” Harry asked in concern before gasping himself and looking down. Translucent milk was dribbling through the gaps in his fingers and running down the back of his hand. “Hey – it’s working!”
Harry closed the door and looked down at Lyra, she was giggling happily as he placed a sloppy kiss on her rosy cheek before carrying her over to the bathroom. Draco was waiting, already in the bath with outstretched hands as Harry delivered Lyra to him.
“I’m going to cast some cleaning charms on you darling, will you let me?” Harry knew Draco had been nervous about wands pointed at him since the corridor incident.
“You…you want to see?” Draco asked, feeling a little surprised.
“You know when Ginny told us you’d knocked up a seventh year omega boy, I figured it’d be that Damien Tuppence,” Michael stated loudly, “the one with the nice arse.”
Harry swore above him but didn’t sound angry as Draco moaned, his eyes lolling about in his head. Draco mewled anxiously as Harry pulled out of him, leaving him empty. The orgasm was nowhere near enough, Draco’s body was expecting a knot, to be tied together with his alpha.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Damien interrupted, pushing himself away from the way and suddenly affecting a shy attitude, nervously tugging at the hem of his shirt so the neckline lowered to reveal more of his pale pink chest.
“Oh Merlin, your face sweetheart,” Harry rasped, clutching at his own chest as Draco gaped at him, his cheeks reddening.
Harry felt heat infuse through his body as his alpha roared happily.
Harry laughed, “Yeah, that sounds like an uncle’s role alright.”
“Bella didn’t want me near any before…” Draco trailed off.
Draco chewed on his lip and settled the rest of his persimmon on his plate. His stomach was finally feeling a little queasy at all the different types of food. “I don’t….anymore,” Draco added as Harry raised a thick eyebrow with a disbelieving smile. “I never r-really talked to any alphas before, apart from my aunt.”
“Plus if they find out that there’s a spell that could get them pregnant with my DNA…” Harry added as Ron’s face turned very pale.
Draco couldn’t exactly say he was sorry to have not gone back to the Lestrange house that summer. Not that he had ever been truly mistreated there, just horribly ignored. Along with his aunt’s constant biting remarks over not being a pretty or good enough omega.
“Draco is an omega,” the headmistress looked stiff, her fingers curling round her still steaming cup. “As such, his legal guardian is required to give their assent.”
Olive spent the next half an hour or so showing Draco all around the store, picking out various pieces and creating a teetering pile that bobbed along mid air behind them, eventually depositing itself in the curtained changing room on the second floor.
“Oh?” Smith quirked an eyebrow. The alpha was tall but not quite as big as Harry, although he still stood at an impressive breadth and height that served to be more than intimidating enough for Draco. “I’m surprised after what went down in that snow globe that Potter let you out of his sight.”
“The baby’s magical signature,” Professor McGonagall continued, “it’s a match for yours.”
“If you want to borrow the Cobblet book from me, feel free,” Hermione told him, “I finished it over the summer.”
Over the following weeks, Draco’s interest in the dark, carefree alpha had morphed into a fully blown crush. At night, Draco would imagine what the man’s arms would feel like wrapped around him, Draco’s omega sated and reassured. He would imagine taking Harry’s hand and excitedly showing him the new potions Draco was working on from Uncle Sev’s journal. He wondered if Harry would be impressed?
“I am grateful for the spell’s existence,” Remus concluded, “it saved my adopted son and now it has given me a grandchild but it should end now Severus. You need to destroy the spell, lest it end up in innocent hands again, or worse, calculating hands.”
Draco beamed as he managed to land another snowball, dangerously close to Harry’s crotch.
Draco felt a little embarrassed at the personalised quidditch gloves he had gifted Harry. Draco had been scared if had bought anything more then it might inadvertently reveal the depth of his feelings for the alpha.
Draco reminded himself that he could currently be recovering from omega termination whilst facing criminal charges and the outraged ire of general wizarding society. Instead, he was warm and safe and, even if only for a little while, had Harry right beside him, offering to take care of him.
“And yet you still gave me a fucking P for my Potions O.W.L. coursework?”
Harry gasped as Draco levered himself up, his hands gripping the older man’s sides before falling back down into the alpha’s lap. Both of them grunted as Draco began to bounce up and down on Harry’s cock. Harry bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to taste blood so as to stop himself from thrusting his own hips up. This was the first time Draco had been confident enough to ride him, to set the pace and Harry wanted to relish every second of it, every small, happy noise the omega was making.
“Oh what a beautiful woman, is this your mother sweetheart?”
Draco, however, smelled shocked, embarrassed and for some strange reason,
“Um,” Draco’s brow furrowed for a moment, “I’m in my nightclothes.”
“I did,” Snape replied. “Before the final battle.”
can’t,” Draco sounded a cross between miserable and irritated and it reminded Harry amusingly of how much more regularly the omega’s petulant side had been coming through lately.
“So who raised you then?” Sirius asked, crossing his legs and putting his clunky boots up on the expensive looking coffee table. “I know it wasn’t Andromeda.” Upon noticing Draco’s confusion, Sirius gestured back to the picture. “Andromeda Tonks, née Black. She’s your aunt.”
“Don’t forget we need to pick up wine,” Draco said hurriedly. “I want to buy a red and a w-white.”
“Yeah alright,” Ron chuckled, “I just meant it’s a bit of a surprise that’s all. He’s not your usual type and I guess I never figured you’d end up with an omega. He looks like a strong wind might blow him over half the time.”
“I-“ Draco began before looking down at his soup. Right now he didn’t think he could stomach a single thing.
Harry frowned, he wasn’t quite sure he knew what Draco meant. Was the omega worried Harry was going to go laugh with his friends about having copped a view of Draco’s arse? It wasn’t like the younger boy had been doing anything shameful,
“A-Ah,” Draco panted as Harry grabbed his shoulders, lifting him back up and onto Harry’s lap. Draco’s cock was hard again, bobbing underneath his belly, the tip connected to his bump by a sticky trail of precome. Harry could feel his own erection become covered in Draco’s slick, his needy hole so tantalisingly close.
“You’re going to be such a good mother,” Harry murmured, “look at all this milk, fuck Draco you’re so swollen with it. You’re such a good omega.” Harry grunted as he squeezed his own thighs together, heavy denim creating friction across his erection. The entire cubicle smelled like apples, honeydew and milk.
your parents were alphas?” Draco questioned in surprise. He had never heard of that before, although Bellatrix appeared to have sheltered him from a lot of the less ‘favourable’ dynamics.
Suddenly, the fragrance of grass and spearmint enveloped Draco’s senses as a familiar booming voice crackled down the hallway.
“Not at all,” Harry shook his head, “you washed before bed and I really want to taste your slick.”
Harry clenched his teeth, moving to take a step forward when he realised that Remus was looking at him. Of course the werewolf had still been able to scent that he was there. Remus held out his hand so as to tell Harry to stay. Snape was still sitting on the bench with his back to Harry, but his shoulders were a tense and shaking line.
Horrible assertions about himself, Draco could cope with, but speaking such
“You’ve been so cruel to him,” Remus commented quietly, dragging his eyes away from Harry and back to the seemingly broken man in front of him. “Harry has always complained to Sirius and I about how you’ve treated him.”
Harry had noticed three dark freckles in a line beneath Draco’s right ear, he had stared at them for quite some time whilst Madam Pomfrey began fussing over prenatal supplements.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise, “A bit late for that, don’t you think Professor? You’re the one that left that journal somewhere Draco could find.”
“I think he looked smug,” Muriel sniffed. “Knows he’s done well for himself and did you see the way he clings to Harry? I swear he wouldn’t leave the poor alpha alone even for a minute.”
“I –“ Harry made a frustrated noise and looked away.
Hermione frowned, reaching over to gently lay the back of her hand against Draco’s cheek. “He doesn’t normally feel too much warmer than this actually,” she said. “I think omegas run cold, especially during pregnancy when they are directing most of their body heat towards the baby.”
“So good sweetheart,” Harry murmured, caressing Draco’s lithe body before dipping his own face forwards and probing his tongue into Draco’s slicked hole. The omega tensed before shuddering, jerking his hips back in an effort to get his alpha deeper inside him. The blowjob became sloppier as Draco’s lips fell lax, the younger man letting out whining, huffing sounds.
“Merlin I’ve wanted to be inside you for so long sweetheart,” Harry murmured.
“Good, now we’ll put this dress in the ‘definite’ pile and you can try on some more clothes for me okay? Maybe I’ll finally learn something about fashion.”
“Lily used to say the same thing about James,” Remus smiled, “until she realised he could be.”
Harry could smell the creamy sweet scent again, emanating from Draco’s chest. Although the padded bralettes had arrived from Amberly’s in the post, it was still more comfortable for Draco to sleep without them. Harry had assured the omega that he shouldn’t be embarrassed about leaking overnight and had made certain that he never stared too long at Draco’s occasionally damp chest.
“I am a grown man, Damien,” Harry said calmly, “if you think some school yard gossip is going to influence
“Careful,” Harry warned as Draco drew away with cheeks reddened from stubble rash, “I’m not as soft as you.”
“I understand,” Harry smiled, feeling a surge of affection and happiness. He leaned in to kiss Draco on his reddened lips. “We’re together now, always.” Harry glanced down at Draco’s bump, stroking circles over the top of it, “Our family.”
“Draco, I think we should talk,” Harry said quietly as the shaking of the omega’s shoulders began to gradually subside.
“Right,” Harry muttered miserably. It had grown fully dark now and he could barely see Ron’s frown through the shadows. “I’ve got to go, Draco will be waiting for me to take him to the Hall for dinner.”
Draco could smell from the notes of grass and spearmint that it was Ron outside. The omega was also immediately very aware that he was only wearing an undershirt.
“I love you too Harry,” Draco whispered a moment later, almost drowned out by the crackle and pop of the magical fireworks Seamus had begun setting off outside.
“Oh, that’s lovely,” Remus smiled, looking over Draco’s shoulder. “It’s all different animals, look –there’s a stag.”
“Of course,” Harry nodded, “by the time I’m finished, everything in the house will be baby safe, or at least baby proofed.”
“Okay,” Draco smiled, hopping down off the seat and making his way towards the door. Before he left, he looked back at his godfather again. The other man had already donned his protruding black glass goggles and was humming to himself as he tugged on dragonshide gloves.
“Oh, I had a cardigan on,” Draco said, standing up and walking over to show Harry the fuzzy yellow garment that Katie Bell had lent Draco the first time he had visited Gaedere. The omega had looked ridiculously cute that day, in tight white cut offs and a loose pink sweater. Remembering that, Harry had it confirmed that he definitely wanted to take Draco shopping for some clothes he found nice.
“It’s not that,” Draco shook his head, “I love clothes, but Aunt Bella has always said you shouldn’t let omegas feel too fancy about themselves.”
The rest of the group joined them about ten minutes later, all red cheeked and breathless from skating.
The man huffed, drawing himself up as Harry let out another low, rumbling growl. His alpha was clawing to be let out so as to run this potential threat off. Harry knew it wouldn’t matter that much normally, but Draco probably wasn’t confident yet about being seen by others in what he considered a revealing dress. Not to mention that Draco was unmated and giving off some very attractive smells. Or at least he had been, right now the omega’s scent had turned to rusted distress.
“You mean other than an alpha right?” Harry frowned. “Did Bellatrix never sleep scent you then? That really sucks, I know parents are meant to do that kind of thing.”
“Of course,” Harry replied, frowning. “Yeah, I mean I can’t have a kid running around out there that I don’t see. I’ve always wanted children, I just…wasn’t expecting
“I’ll give you a hand,” Harry said, thinking about quite how big and heavy that large four poster must be. “May I come in?”
“Yeah,” Harry replied, shifting Draco even more into his embrace. “I just…I just can’t help but feel like I’ve been doing this all wrong Mione.”
“Oh Harry this was lovely!” Luna declared, coming to sit beside them and collapsing into a free deck chair. She fanned herself as she beamed over at them, “Happy Birthday Draco, I do like that dress you’re wearing, it’s such a shame it’s spoiled now.”
“Draco?” Harry said in surprise. “I thought I was helping you move in tomorrow?”
“Harry!” Draco stood up excitedly as Sirius left them. “Did you really invite Sev?” It was true, Draco had been rather concerned about his godfather being at Hogwarts all alone.
“Mercy!” Harry laughed, hissing as Draco managed to yank out some of his happy trail. “Ah – ah, mercy, I’m sorry Draco. I just wanted to get your honest opinion.”
Harry watched her go before walking round to take her vacated seat, looking over curiously at Draco.
“And do you feel safe?” Harry asked, “In these chambers with me? In our bed?”
A moment later, Draco slipped out from the changing room and Harry nearly dropped his tea in surprise, quickly stashing it on top of a nearby table.
Harry’s body was large and muscular, brown and still damp from the shower. Wiry black hair curled across his chest, leading down in a thick trail past his belly to where his cock and balls hung heavy between his legs. Draco swallowed tightly, Harry’s prick had seemed quite intimidating at first but at the same time it made Draco swell inside with need. Draco realised that Harry wasn’t moving anymore and when he jerked his eyes back up to the alpha’s face he could see that the older man was staring back at Draco, his expression dark and hungry.
“I’m sure you’ll be excused given the circumstances,” Hermione smiled, causing Harry’s eyes to widen as the alpha turned to her incredulously.
Draco gaped at her, a million thoughts whirling round his head.
Harry sighed as he sat down on the unmade bed. This large airy room was Sirius and Remus’, whilst Harry and Draco were going be staying in Harry’s childhood room on the other side of the apartment. Draco had already gotten excited about seeing where Harry grew up and even insisted they drink their teas on the balcony outside, despite the winter chill.
“No, I guess you’re right, I didn’t, thank god for being a boring square eh?” Harry took off his glasses and wiped at his eyes. Some of the candles in the suite had started to die down, flickering orange shadows across the stone walls.
“He – he came on to me!” Smith croaked, shooting Draco a vicious sneer.
“Hey, you’re Harry Potter aren’t you?” the Ravenclaw boy asked as he sat up on a bed and waited his turn. “You’re having a baby with that Seventh Year.”
Harry blinked in surprise before letting out a loud snort of laughter as Draco grinned at him.
“Well excuse my language Professor, but that’s fucked up,” Harry replied woodenly. He didn’t even know Draco and now suddenly Harry was legally qualified to sign medical forms for him?
spilled his soup and his legs got burned. Padma had just finished putting ointment on them when you decided that it was completely appropriate to barge into our non alpha dorm room unannounced.”
“Ye-“ Draco snapped his mouth shut before finishing, blushing so red it felt like burning.
“Yeah, well it did take nearly two weeks of badgering,” Harry muttered. He had also spent a good part of the last fortnight leaving pamphlets on the importance of nesting omegas outside the door to her office. “Besides, no one’s going to bother him. He’ll take the Morgana Suite and be able to have some privacy. Plus, this way I can siphon off my magic for the baby without having to keep traipsing up to the Hospital Wing every Thursday.”
With that Harry left, striding purposefully past the milling students until he finally re-entered his original compartment.
Ron laughed which made Harry bristle. Harry didn’t think he was being particular fair to Draco in his description, after all it was hard to tell what someone really looked like when they had been crying for twenty-four hours straight.
Now Harry was twenty-one and very much enjoying himself.
Olive laughed and gestured for Harry to join her back on the sofa. “No, you’re right. Normally the omega would be the one to always get pregnant. But I was a difficult birth and Dad refused to go through that again, said that if Mum wanted another kid she could damn well do it herself.”
“Thanks Mione,” Harry beamed, blowing her an air kiss as he didn’t think the beta would appreciate him actually touching her right now.
“Mummy had even got a venue in mind,” Venetia sniffed, and much to Draco’s horror, her large blue eyes welled with tears which she dramatically dabbed away.
Harry frowned as Seamus flicked his wand and murmured something, causing a large globule of the buttercup yellow custard to bubble up and escape from a nearby jug.
“Don’t be deliberately obtuse,” Bella snapped before frowning suspiciously. “Why aren’t you stuttering? Normally I can barely get three articulate words out of you.”
Draco wasn’t stuttering as much as usual and Harry hoped that Hermione was right and the younger boy wasn’t feeling too nervous. Although as a result, it did mean that Harry now noticed that Draco had a very slight lisp, or perhaps it was just his incredibly posh accent.
“I – I want you,” Draco gasped as Harry appeared beside him and licked the shell of Draco’s ear.
Slowly, Harry began to push in. Draco gasped as the massive girth spread him wide. They stopped for a moment to allow Draco to shift his legs further apart, Harry helping and massaging his buttocks. Draco could feel Harry parting the globes of his arse so as to better watch himself enter the younger boy. Draco shivered, thinking of what Harry must be seeing, his hefty, blood swollen shaft impaling the omega.
“Oh god not a beta,” Damien replied quickly, pulling a face. Harry thought that kind of reaction was a bit harsh but he guessed everybody had preferences. “No, I want an alpha who will properly court me for bonding,” Damien explained. “Someone devastatingly handsome and of the right standing who understands what a catch I am,”
Draco blinked as he tried to recover from the emotional whiplash. Remus let out a long suffering sigh before shaking his head at Harry, “You’ve just got to remember how to deal with him occasionally,” Remus explained before leaning forwards and giving Draco a tentative smile.
“Oh calm down, he’s fine,” Hermione retorted, “
He followed Colum out of the back exit of the club and onto a damp cobbled street. “Oh yeah,” Colum laughed brightly, “that’s better.”
“And I’m right handed,” Harry interjected, causing Draco to look at him.
“I’m going to let you go,” Harry whispered furiously, “but only because I don’t want to scare Draco. However, if you
“Nettlebed’s,” Draco swallowed tightly, “It’s on Tadpole Lane, a few streets over from Diagon Alley.”
“Right well, we’ll see what we can do,” Harry nodded decisively, realizing he hadn’t actually explained any of his thought processes to Draco. “But you’re definitely buying that dress, my treat.”
Harry grunted as copious amounts of slick and come puddled across his trousers. Maybe Draco had had the right idea with actually undressing first. Although Harry wasn’t sure about how happy he would be with Draco putting his dress back on to mingle with other people, given that it was only lying a few feet away from them and would surely be drenched with the scent of their coupling by now.
Draco swallowed, he wasn’t sure if this was going terribly badly already. He had expected formal introductions, perhaps polite enquiry about the journey. Instead, he followed the two strange men up a large metal staircase in silence. Harry reassuringly slipped his arm around Draco’s lower back as they ascended.
Harry felt Draco shift a ffew minutes later and moved so as to let the omega sit up against him.
“Harry man! We’re going to be late, it’s five to,” Seamus slapped the table in front of them making Draco yelp and jerk up off the bench.
“Oh that,” Colum grinned, “yeah I think everybody’s heard about how Harry Potter knocked up some kid.”
“What was it you wanted?” Harry asked huskily, drawing back from Draco’s chest but staying close enough that his breath tickled the wet skin, causing goosebumps to break out. “Tell me what you wanted from me?”
“Poppy,” Professor McGonagall inclined her head, “I think perhaps we should visit the hospital wing.”
“Oh,” Hermione blinked at him, “did I not explain that part? He got five Os.”
“Oh little one,” Harry said, rushing over to scoop Draco up into his arms, “Please don’t cry my love, whatever it is, I’ll fix it. Please, we don’t have to live here, it’s not a problem I promise.”
Harry glared at him as Hermione returned and Ron leaned over to kiss her with a smug look on his face.
“Ah, I think he already was,” Harry replied, scratching the back of his head.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, “It’s a peacock.” Draco’s happiest memory had been of the first ever photograph Bellatrix had found of his mother. In it, Narcissa had been picnicking on a great lawn, laughing and surrounded by white peacocks. Draco glanced back to the mobile and sure enough, an elegant peacock was fanning out its tail right behind a large, shaggy dog.
Harry had tried to explain to Draco that probably wasn’t the case as Ginny had never even officially been Harry’s girlfriend. Plus, Molly had always somewhat adopted Harry as an extra member of the family, much to the suffering eye rolls of Sirius who found the entire household a little too loud.
, what you could do is authorise Draco to withdraw all of his inheritance from Primrose and Profitts –“
Harry went very red when Draco opened the present from him and gasped loudly. It was a glittering topaz necklace, almost identical to the one that Narcissa had been wearing in the photograph Draco had shown him.
Draco shook his head, trying to dispel the voice. He didn’t mind if Harry was only concerned about the baby, that just meant he was a good father already.
However, Bellatrix had made it blisteringly clear that this wasn’t going to happen. Draco had been devastatingly certain his future lay with Atherol Sourboll, the portly man who smelled like mint humbugs and had pinched Draco’s bottom when his aunt wasn’t looking.
“First and Second years,” Harry had chuckled, “always
“Stay where you are sweetheart,” Harry raised a hand, “I’m fine, just got into a minor disagreement with a deceptively deep puddle.”
Draco flushed, he’d had no idea that people could see into the globe. It hadn’t been see through from the inside. Had other festival goers really watched everything that happened? It was a mortifying thought.
Damien let out a short, high pitched shriek as Harry slammed his hand against the wall.
“I take it Sirius wrote back?” Hermione asked after seeing his expression.
“Not because I didn’t want to,” Harry rushed to explain, “but again, I thought you might like a little more time before we did that.”
“Sure, yes, fine, whatever you say,” Seamus replied, clearly desperate not to earn Ginny’s infamous ire.
“You’re m-my alpha,” Draco exhaled happily as Harry’s hand travelled further down and he rolled his thumb and index finger up the omega’s cock.
It was an unusually warm day for late May and Harry had found it pleasant enough to wear only a t-shirt. The Hogwarts herb garden was a fair walk from the school’s main buildings, although with the castle being so huge and dominating on the landscape, it never really seemed far away.
“Madam P-Pomfrey showed me how but
“What I mean is, that kind of shit doesn’t define how you act,” Harry explained.
“What’s wrong?” Draco questioned, glancing round anxiously as he heard the large front door being pulled open.
Draco had woken up on Friday morning feeling rather worse for wear. Any discomfort, however, seemed to fizzle away as soon as Madam Pomfrey told him that the baby was okay. On Sunday, he had been discharged from the Hospital Wing and Harry had walked with him all the way back to the Gaedere House annexe.
“Sirius,” Remus murmured, placing a hand on the other man’s arm.
Draco frowned as Harry gave him an encouraging expression. “It’s..it’s just something we do.”
Draco had offered to tell people about the spell but Professor McGonagall had swiftly shut him down. Insisting that it could be dangerous for Harry if that information were to get out, not to mention that Draco would be arrested.
“I heard you’re trying to bring back He Who Must Not Be Named,” a Ravenclaw boy called Erwin interjected, “that you did some sort of dark magic ritual and you’re growing something called a ‘horcrux’ in there.”
to look like you’re in your twenties?” Harry frowned as Draco blushed and avoided his eyes. Harry wondered if Draco found it hard being in Gaedere House, socializing with all of Harry’s older friends and putting up with teasing from some of the others.
“Well that’s not good,” Hermione stated matter of factly. “You’re going to need a lot of touch during this, Draco.”
“Are you alright? Sorry they’re barmy,” Harry whispered as Draco tried not to obviously let out a shiver.
“Yeah, but…” Ron trailed off, “like not really? I mean of course he is!” Ron quickly added as Harry pulled a face. “But as in, you’re not together and you never have been. I’m sure Draco would survive a night on his own.”
“I d-didn’t know,” Draco looked as though he was about to burst into tears, his eyes were already red rimmed and his bottom lip was wobbling. “I didn’t know i-it would do this.”
“I’ll take it off,” Harry promised, quickly standing up and unbuttoning his shirt and jeans. “I’m going to get Hermione to watch over you whilst I find some other clothes okay? Fuck – Draco –“ Harry lurched forwards just as the other boy began slipping downwards under the water, submerging his chin and mouth.
“I promise Draco,” Harry said firmly, “I’m your alpha and your mate, I’m here for you,
“I had supposed after hearing what I just told Lupin, that you might prefer me not to be in your future husband’s life,” Snape stated. His voice was grim and resigned rather than challenging, as if Snape had already accepted Harry’s decision.
Draco tried to smother his yawn in his sleeve, he could feel himself drifting off but he didn’t want Harry to find a reason to leave just yet. It was incredibly comforting having the alpha in Draco’s rooms, sat on his sofa in faded pyjamas and bare feet, like he belonged there.
“So how is the little omega?” Ginny asked, immediately moving to lie in the warm patch Harry had just vacated. “He popped yet?”
“I’m so bloody done with winter,” Katie shivered as both of the Great Hall doors swung open to let in Hagrid, along with a biting gust of cold air. “It needs to be spring already, I’m telling you, the moment I see the first bluebell, I’m wearing shorts.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Harry rushed to say, levering himself up and holding Draco still. “Don’t move sweetheart, you’ll hurt yourself.”
Draco tried not to gasp as he felt Harry’s thumb begin to rub small circles into his neck as if apologising.
“To be fair Mione,” Ron frowned, “you do have a lot of causes, I mean house elves, magical creatures, omegas…”
to get rid of the milk…”
Draco found the nightgown being pulled out of his mouth and for a brief moment over his eyes before Harry tugged the garment off completely, throwing it to one side of the nest.
“Please,” Ginny rolled her eyes, “you mention ‘babies’ and she goes all goo goo eyed. Besides, why would she be mad at you? Her and Dad started shooting ‘em out straight after school.”
“Mm,” Harry replied happily, running his calloused fingers up the inside of Draco’s thigh. The silken nightgown had slipped back down and Harry took great delight in slowly pushing it back up. Eventually, Harry’s hand wound its way around Draco’s prick, lightly squeezing and tugging.
“It’s okay,” Draco gave them both a small smile, “I don’t like Bellatrix or Rodolphus very much and they’ve n-never liked me either.”
“This…is for me?” Draco blinked, looking up at Harry who was still frowning down at him before the alpha’s face relaxed.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “I’ll ask Draco, if I can get him to say more than two words to me that is.”
Snape let out another unbidden bark of laughter.
“Damien, I think I know where this is going,” Harry said grimly, his demeanour turning stiff. He noticed Damien flinch slightly as Harry’s posture turned more hostile.
There was a moment of silence before Harry muttered an apology and Hermione tutted back at him.
“Where did I go?” Draco frowned in confusion as Harry let out a soft laugh and perched on the edge of the bed.
“This is Draco,” Harry nodded.
“No!” Harry coughed, feeling himself start to blush. “I mean, thank you, that’s good to know,” he added as Nadia raised her eyebrows. “I was actually wondering if you knew where I could buy some omega undergarments, the type specifically for pregnancy lactation.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry sighed miserably, lifting his own head back and staring at the stone ceiling. He hugged the younger boy a little tighter, pressing their bodies together. “I’m so fucking sorry I wasn’t here. I would have stayed if I’d known you felt this unwell.”
“Don’t worry, I’ve got a t-shirt on under here,” Harry explained, tugging the hoodie free and checking it was infused enough with his scent. He passed Draco the article of clothing, his inner alpha preening as the omega hugged it close to his chest.
The ancient metal bell in the Hogwarts clock tower began clanging loudly to signal the end of lunch and Draco’s attention was brought back to the Great Hall. He looked over to see with a pang of disappointment that most of the Gaedere students had already left, Harry Potter included.
There was a moment of quiet before Harry let out a long sigh. “Even I know that’s not right, I’m sorry Draco.”
Draco nodded sheepishly.
.” Sirius pointed accusingly at Remus, “know full well you’re banned from my garage on account of knowing sod all about engineering and
“These were m-my mother’s,” Draco explained excitedly, sitting cross legged on the arm of the sofa next to Harry. Harry quickly averted his eyes as Draco pulled his night gown down over his knees, concealing the flash of pale thigh that had previously been visible.
“Draco?” Madam Pomfrey asked.
Harry shrugged, trying not smile as Sirius jumped up and stalked over to Draco. Draco blinked up the alpha with wide, nervous eyes. Apart from when they had first met, Sirius hadn’t engaged with the omega at all.
“Sorry to hear that,” Harry replied, “my friend Ron used to get travelsick too. His mum even bought him those special pressure bands but it never did any good.”
“The apprenticeship wouldn’t start until December,” Draco fidgeted. He knew that on the days when he had to go in to the shop that there would be plenty of Harry’s friends willing to watch over their child for a few hours. Draco’s mind flashed to the welcoming enthusiasm of Molly Weasley. It also helped that she was another omega, meaning Draco’s senses already perceived her as safe.
“Thank you,” Draco replied, his fingers twitching against the smock’s fabric and bunching it slightly. “I think I s-suit blue.”
Harry almost joked that the other boy was already pregnant but somehow he figured that might not go down too well. Draco had obviously been brought up in a very austere and traditionalist household with old fashioned views about omega purity.
“Then again,” Remus laughed, stirring his wine with a cinnamon bark stick, “I was always uncharacteristically brave whenever I was with your dad or Sirius. Something about their courage was so infectious, as if we could take on the entire world so long as we knew we were in the right.”
“Yeah,” Katie beamed, “Professor Zeborn, my Magical Metallurgy lecturer, suggested the programme to me and it sounds really interesting.”
“Good thing we started early in that case,” Harry smiled, cupping the back of Draco’s head and slowly bringing their mouths together. Draco let out a small, contented noise as their lips met, moving against one another. Draco seemed to melt against Harry, his hands pressing against the alpha’s chest as the older man carefully deepened the kiss, not taking any more than Draco was willing to give.
“No deal! Harry would kill me!” Draco grinned as Severus tutted loudly and pretended to throw the application in the bin.
“Harry,” Hermione began, “you’re a good alpha and a wonderful man doing the best you can in a very unusual set of circumstances. Now you know how much I’ve come to care for Draco and I do think that he will need probably more support and affection throughout the later stages of his pregnancy.
“You!” Draco gasped, staring transfixed as Harry sucked each of his digits into his mouth so as not to miss a drop. His omega tasted perfect, salty and sweet and Harry’s inner alpha howled in pleasure. Harry shifted on the bed, looking down to find himself kneeling in a distinct wet patch. Draco sat up, blushing down at the clear puddle of slick that had soaked through the sheets.
“I bet your alpha wants to bite him,” Ginny’s face was looking suspiciously wicked. “I know you Harry, you pretend to be all blasé and easy going like some Sirius Black clone, but you
“No, after some reconsideration I decided perhaps you couldn’t be
“Of course,” Draco frowned. “But it’s also meant to be a scent pool.”
“Yeah,” Harry chuckled, “imagine your favourite flavour.”
wedding gift, from me.”
“She’s healthy,” Healer Sweetbridge announced, looking both pleased and relieved. Draco let out a murmur of response before tipping his head heavily onto Harry’s chest, his breathing evening out. It seemed that the omega had been hanging onto to consciousness long enough to ascertain that his baby was alright.
Draco Malfoy then?”
“I w-was fifteen two years ago!” Draco gasped. Harry felt his stomach twist with revulsion. Arranged marriages weren’t unusual for omegas, especially within the older purebred families who maintained a traditionalist approach to omega ‘ownership’. However, the idea of a small, lonely Draco being shipped off to some grubby fingered fifty year old made Harry want to throw up.
Harry held his breath, his eyes boring into the back of Snape’s dark head.
“I’m good,” Draco whispered back. Harry smiled in seemingly relief and began to engage Remus in a humorous conversation about Draco’s pickle cravings.
“I know,” Harry bit out, it wasn’t like his friends were saying anything he wasn’t already painfully aware of. He looked at Hermione, “I just couldn’t do it. He wants the baby and if I don’t allow it then I’m the one forcing him to get an abortion. Don’t you think it’s fucked up he can’t control his own body?”
“Alpha!” Draco shouted, immediately acquiescing.
“I’m not
Harry smiled fondly at where Draco was sat cross legged on the carpet at Padfoot’s. They were in the lounge area and the omega was busy trying to construct his present from the Christmas Tree Maze. It was one of those wooden German decorations that you had to build yourself. The instructions promised Draco that it was going to be a carousel that, when you placed a series of hot tea lights at various intervals, would start to rotate.
Ron looked incredibly relieved as he stuffed a handful of salt and vinegar crisps into his mouth.
“Yeah, it’s me, I’m here little one,” Harry murmured, pressing a small, chaste kiss to the back of Draco’s scalp. He could taste salt on his lips from the omega’s sweat. “I’ve got you.”
Harry then tucked him carefully into bed, making sure no part of Draco touched the cold stone wall before crawling in himself and dimming the candles again.
“Not sure there’s enough space in a club for that,” Harry chuckled, “but maybe you could show me one day? I promise not to have two left feet.”
“Leave it Smith,” Harry growled. The rumbling sound made Draco tense, he had never been this close to an alpha before. Even Bellatrix had always kept Draco at arm’s length and she more shrieked than growled.
Draco grunted with effort as he reached down, Harry quickly grabbing a pillow to slide under the younger boy to stop him falling back or pitching to the side. Draco wrapped both of his hands around a hairy, dark forearm before tugging the hand back towards his entrance.
“Oh no,” Remus shook his head theatrically “I’m not sure where that goes, maybe on the outside of the appara-“
It was so silly harbouring a crush on Harry Potter, Draco was sure that most of the school felt the same way. The other omegas certainly did, with Venetia Dawson proclaiming that her family were already in mating talks with the man in question.
“You were at a nightclub?” Draco asked curiously, he had heard some of Harry’s peers talking about where they were going and laughing about the sort of hijinks that would probably occur.
“Blimey,” a man with an Irish accent and closely cropped hair announced. “This him, Harry?”
“You haven’t lit a fire, aren’t you cold in just that nightgown?” Harry frowned, looking down at Draco’s slender frame. The gown’s fabric seemed pretty flimsy and Harry couldn’t imagine it kept much heat in.
Remus looked up from where he was sat cross legged on the bedroom floor. “Harry, I don’t think you’ve ever coupled with that boy.”
been an arsehole, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “I told you, you’re going to need to grow a thicker skin for the next nine months,”
“He won’t be lonely anymore,” Harry stated firmly, “I love him.”
“Do you not want me here?” Harry asked, smiling and quirking an eyebrow.
“Hey Harry, how’s your kid?” Seamus asked brightly.
Draco felt sweat prickling on the back of his neck, he knew he was turning red. Whilst blushed cheeks might look awfully pretty on a complexion like Damien’s, Draco had the unfortunate habit of looking like a boiled lobster. He tried to calm himself, Draco had known this would happen eventually. Instinctively he placed a hand over his stomach to remind himself he wasn’t alone. Damien’s eyes snapped downwards, tracking the gesture.
Last night, for some godforsaken reason, Harry had done some reading on omegas, learning that for a male one, an abortion could be pretty intensive operation. Harry wondered how much school the blond boy would miss? If he would stay with his guardians to recover?
“What do you mean your allowance?” Harry frowned. “Didn’t you inherit from your parents, like I did?”
“Right then,” Hermione said, turning back to him. “I want to see you in something warm please, it’s two degrees out there.”
“Well I’d like to,” Harry replied casually, “and I think you might like it too.”
“Will I,” Draco’s eyes flicked quickly to Harry’s own crotch, “will I do it back?”
“Ginny just came to see me this morning. We were talking about you actually,” Harry could feel Draco tense up. “She um, well you know she’s Ron’s sister and their mum, Molly, she’s like an aunt to me. The thing is, Molly’s an omega too and I’m really close with them all. She’s pretty keen to meet you in fact.”
Seamus had the decency to look a little guilty and Harry suspected he hadn’t intentionally set up the joke.
“Well, look at that,” Harry said, beaming at Draco who couldn’t help but feel a little smug. The three of them carried onwards. When Harry noticed that Draco had lost a mitten, he carefully wrapped his hand around Draco’s bare one and pushed it into Harry’s warm pocket, holding them together there.
Harry fixed the man with a vicious glare as he crossed over to stand in front of the bench. Harry felt much larger than normal as he folded his arms over his chest and towered over the seemingly shrunken beta before him. Snape looked older and paler than usual, swamped in his billowing robes with a defeated slump to his posture.
“I’ve been thinking,” Harry murmured, his bright green eyes still fixed on Draco’s mouth. Draco didn’t want to start chewing again and somehow break the spell but he could feel saliva pooling uncomfortably on his tongue. “The books Madam Pomfrey gave me say that omegas really need a lot of physical contact in their second trimester and you’re nearly at that stage.”
No one ever spoke to Draco, no one ever helped him or noticed him.
Draco felt pleased as he wriggled back on the sofa. Harry leant in to him a moment later, the alpha’s breath hot against the cold shell of Draco’s ear.
“Harry,” Remus gasped softly as Harry felt himself rooted to the spot, his blood hot then cold.
The omega visibly cringed as he hugged himself tighter. Harry felt a little winded by the revelation. He had known of course, that at some point Draco would start producing milk in order to feed their baby after birth but he hadn’t realised that such a thing could occur in only the second trimester.
Harry shook his head disbelievingly at her, pretty sure that Ginny knew exactly what Draco looked like by now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eventually, most of the students got up to go to their assorted morning lectures. Draco had a free study period and planned on going to the library, so he could afford to sit at the table a little longer. He also happened to remember that Harry’s Advanced Duelling lecture didn’t start until ten. This gave Draco an opportunity to be in the alpha’s presence for a little longer without looking like he was being clingy.
“I assume you’re referring to Dean’s ‘Most Fuckable Omega’ list?” Ginny rolled her eyes. “Yeah, I got over that pretty quickly. To be honest I think most of the jerks at this school have one of those.”
“Right?” Harry laughed. “Also apparently me, Ron and Mione are in a very dramatic love triangle. I’m secretly married to Celestina Warbeck, one of my godfathers turned me into a werewolf, I actually got this scar from my
“You okay my love?” Harry asked, stroking Draco’s hair and chuckling as a mass of soggy petals fell out.
“Thank you so much,” Draco said, looking up at the two men and smiling.
“He barely stutters at all now when he’s with me and the girls,” Hermione said proudly. “I think it must just be nerves.”
Draco was aware that his own late father Lucius had been rather bitter enemies with Harry’s parents. Everyone knew the Potters had died defending their five year old son from Voldemort, successfully taking down the Dark Lord once and for all. Besides, Draco had also heard from the grapevine that Harry was aiming for the aurors, surely public association with a pregnant omega of ill repute might jeopardise that?
Professor McGonagall had informed Harry that the Healer from St. Mungo’s would be arriving on Monday to perform the procedure. Information that, quite frankly, Harry could have done without as he had huffed and sent her indignant owl back without a treat.
“Hello little one,” Harry smiled softly, stroking the side of Draco’s face and vowing to get the younger boy in a soothing bubble bath as soon as they were able to move.
“Harry?” Draco’s face screwed up in confusion.
Draco had shyly asked Harry if they could keep the baby’s sex as a surprise and Harry had happily agreed.
“Sorry!” Draco exclaimed as Harry peered down at him. “Felicity b-brought me to find you.”
It also didn’t help that Damien had gone about it completely the wrong way with his name dropping and exclusive social engagements. Those kind of things had always meant bugger all to both Harry and his godfathers.
Draco glared at the other boy, alpha or not Draco wondered if he could get away with hexing him into a stinkhorn toadstool and blaming it on pregnancy hormones.
“I love it!” Draco exclaimed, laughing messily before blowing his nose again. “Harry is this really our home?”
Draco nodded as if Harry had just said something deeply philosophical. It was sort of nice having someone who didn’t constantly take the piss out of how inarticulate Harry was. Draco certainly could, if he wanted. Although he didn’t speak much in front of Harry, Hermione had informed him that Draco was exceedingly well read and very eloquent.
“That must be it,” Harry nodded. He also guessed that it was something to do with Draco’s omega recognising the touch of his alpha but he didn’t want to embarrass the boy further. Draco’s cheeks were already so red as to almost be purple. “Want me to try the other one?” Harry asked, his eyes flicking down to Draco’s left breast. The nipple there seemed darker, as if Draco had been worrying it in his attempts to milk.
Something about the omegas Harry interacted with at Hogwarts bored him though. They were so stuffed full of familial directions on how to bag a desirable alpha that the asinine smiles and tittering laughs just seemed horribly fake.
“H-Harry oh!” Draco mewled, the strength in his arms giving out and half collapsing against the sheets, held up only by Harry’s strong grip on his hips. Harry drew back momentarily to see Draco’s face, half smushed into the pillow and clouded red as his open mouth let out a needy keen.
Previously, Harry had enjoyed time spent with multiple partners, having a healthy sexual appetite for a twenty one year old, and whilst he could objectively admit that Damien was a very conventionally attractive omega, Harry felt zero desire toward him. Even as Damien licked his lips in what he probably thought was an alluring move.
“Not this time,” Harry sighed, “but I do like dancing, how about you?”
at Draco.
about his baby, his and Harry’s baby, that was just intolerable. Draco had drawn his wand before he even realised he had reached for it.
“How would Potter feel?” Severus asked, “You tell me that you are going to actually bond with that hooligan. Have you asked him about this?”
“I’m going to get off the bed and give you some space okay?” Harry clicked his tongue frustratedly, his inner alpha screaming at him that he was doing something wrong by moving away. Harry ignored it, not wanting to crowd Draco when he was this upset.
“You don’t have to write it if you don’t want to,” Draco huffed, he knew he was acting petulantly and that had never been a good tactic when persuading his godfather of something. But all of Draco’s dreams seemed balanced on a knife’s age and he was terrified of them slipping away.
“I’m okay,” Draco replied, it was admittedly rather sweltering for early June and he was wearing pale dungarees over a striped pink, long sleeved T-shirt. “I’d like to change though, can we go back to the annexe first?”
“Y-You smell like marzipan,” Draco’s fair eyebrows knitted together and his nose wrinkled up unhappily.
Draco gasped, clutching at Harry fearfully, his nerves not settled at all even when Harry and Remus began snorting with muffled laughter.
“You’re not heading back to Patagonia?” Harry frowned, he could have sworn that was where his godfathers were currently travelling.
Draco stared back at her, he didn’t think he had ever been described as ‘lovely’ before.
“I want,” Draco gasped as Harry went even deeper with his thrust, rubbing mercilessly at Draco’s contracting walls. “I want your cock!” Draco half screamed before whining, turning his face into the pillow. Harry quickly slid his other hand under Draco’s cheek, tugging him out of his hiding place and kissing him hotly.
love was not enough?” Snape paused, his head hanging between his shoulders. Remus’ eyes took the opportunity to flick nervously up to Harry’s.
“Which way do you reckon?” Harry whispered to Draco, squeezing his hand. Draco frowned and sniffed the air, the path on the right smelled like moss and the mulch you got in the Forbidden Forest, whilst the left hand one smelled faintly of clementines and cloves.
“Dennis says he saw an alpha come and join you,” Damien continued. Everyone around them had shuffled closer, no conversations had restarted. “And that it was
“Sure you haven’t got it out for him?” Ron grinned, the colour seemed to be returning to normal on his cheeks and he was sitting a little straighter against the headboard.
“I am afraid Mr. Potter has already been made aware of your condition,” Professor McGonagall announced, looking very serious. “You are going to need to explain yourself Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry let out a bubble of laughter, “that’s alright, I’m sure they’ll harden up again once we’re off the train.”
Draco tried his best not to cry as Harry and Hermione led him down to greet all the guests and receive a pile of presents and cards that Ron dutifully gathered together and placed in an assortment of canvas bags for them to take back when it was over.
“Oh,” Harry piped up, suddenly remembering something. “I haven’t even told you about Sirius and Remus’ wedding present yet.”
“I had no idea,” Harry said, looking thoughtful.
“It’s perfect,” Draco nodded. “This has been the most wonderful evening, thank you Harry.”
Harry carefully ran his hand down Draco’s front, cleaning up the come splatters wandlessly. His wand was too far away on the bedside table and Harry hadn’t wanted to risk moving for it whilst still tied to the omega.
“Alright, we’ll meet up with you by the start of the food huts in about an hour and a half?” Harry suggested as the others happily agreed and everybody began to disperse. “Let me know if you get tired or cold,” Harry told Draco as they began to meander down a fairy light lit avenue. The usual grass of the park was carpeted in charmed snow and more flakes were lazily drifting down from the sky.
the time.”
Draco snorted, shaking his head as Lyra finished feeding and he dabbed gently at her mouth with the corner of the cloth. “Isn’t it the sixth yet?” Draco asked, looking out of a window through which the sunrise was only just starting to creep.
“Draco,” Harry said calmly, walking over and crouching down in front of the omega. “Talk to me, what about it is making you unhappy?”
“Thank you sweetheart,” Harry murmured, drawing Draco into his arms and letting the omega nuzzle into his chest.
When finally their daughter was brought into the world, Draco was close to unconscious and Harry had to crawl up onto the bed so as to support both his omega and the wailing pink baby in his arms.
“Should have seen how quickly that saleswoman jumped to her feet when she realised you and Potter were about to give everyone a show,” Smith scoffed. “I mean really, this is meant to be a family friendly event you know? I suppose from your condition it’s already apparent how little shame
“Like right now,” Harry continued, pleased the boy was no longer seemingly in pain as Harry caressed his breast. “Being so good for your alpha, producing all this milk.”
Draco ducked back in, eventually fitting more of the shaft in his mouth but quickly choking when he attempted more. Harry gently showed the younger boy how to use his hands as well, suckling beautifully on the tip whilst cool fingers slid up and down Harry’s pulsing shaft.
After the Wizarding War, where Voldemort had been defeated by the Order of the Phoenix and the courageous sacrifice of James and Lily Potter, it had been decided that higher education should be more encouraged within the magical community. Of course, there had always been institutes and advanced schools that one could graduate to from Hogwarts, but the intake had consistently been rather small.
^*^*^*^*^
“Unless,” Hermione murmured, causing Harry to glance up and see that she was looking pointedly between him and Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes and wriggled further back in the chair to try and better support his aching back, “Harry says I’m p-probably richer than him, and when Remus’ legal petition goes through, I’ll get my full inheritance!”
“And I’d like a roof of some sort,” Draco added, “but…” he paused and looked at Harry, “I know you don’t like small spaces.”
“What the fuck?” Harry’s mouth dropped open as Snape made another angry hissing sound beside him.
“What do they say?” Harry prompted in a low voice, already knowing he wasn’t going to like it very much.
Draco could only hope.
“And yet
“Okay,” Harry shrugged, still not understanding where this was going. There were several omegas in the seventh year and Harry hadn’t made it his business to get to know many of them by name. The only ones he did know were because they had introduced themselves. Male omegas were rarer of course, tending to only herald from pureblood lineages. The name ‘Malfoy’ also vaguely rang a bell but not from any matters regarding Hogwarts.
