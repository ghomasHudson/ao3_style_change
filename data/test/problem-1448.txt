I sleep badly that night, Draco’s unspoken question of whether he can keep something as simple as a stuffed toy haunting my dreams. I am not sure whether the scenes I see actually happened like that or are just figments of my imagination. How my brain sees Draco’s abuse. I see Lucius backhanding an about seven year old child. Narzissa who jumps between an elven year old Draco and his father’s wand, only to be pushed aside. These are just a few images that run through my mind that night.
“Yes, I think she said her name is Tilly. A Malfoy house elf, but it was Malfoy Manor after all. But why are you asking this all?” she fixes her eyes on me imploringly.
Yeah, not fast may have been the best answer. It’s six days later and I only have managed about three quarters of all the files in here. Mind you the worst part were all the papers just randomly flying around the place and the fact that no one seemed capable to only put one kind of information in a folder. So sometimes I had to sort every single sheet from the same folder somewhere different. And since McGonagall asked me to make sense and sort out all the papers I find too… Well, you see my problem. Luckily there are only some boxes (and a few flying leaves) in the back left and the shelves. But I guess that’s the only thing in this damned place that is halfway in order.
Well no, actually I remember one night where it wasn’t. One night five months ago where we just forgot what was expected of us. Where we just did what we wished. I wonder what others would think if they knew. I will never be able to forget it I guess. Do you remember? No, of course you don’t. Obliviate is a very strong spell if performed correctly. I didn’t do it because I wanted. You told me to, but you forgot that as well. You wish that it never happened, don’t you? But because you can’t use Obliviate on yourself, I can’t forget and I never will.
“Where else would I be, scarrhead?” he growls and his words strangely enough rip a laugh from me. He stares at me with wide eyes, “Did you lose your head during the time I can’t remember properly?”
“Malfoy’s punishment is not much different than that,” Hermione says silently, “Living down there is practically torture until one day he is going to be so much of an empty shell that he could very well be dead.”
And land in the living room at Grimmauld place. Hermione lets herself fall onto the sofa next to me. I smile sadly and sit next to her.
“Unfortunately he does,” it’s Hermione who disagrees with me, “If we want justice for him, he will have to.”
“Uhm…” I fidget with my hands, nervous about simply letting him go off, “Are you sure you should be doing that on your own?”
I am just about to catch him when he turns towards the other side of the stable. Unfortunately I am still too far away and I feel Hermione’s hand on my arm before I can come close enough. Instead I only watch as I see Draco use his moving hand to push himself off this side of the stalls. I swallow. There are approximately six steps to the other side. That’s over five steps without anything to hold onto. Draco has never managed more than two without support. My eyes lock with Hermione’s but she shakes her head.
"You were a muggle, you should know the place.  Quality furniture, only place I go.  Well, other than- never mind."
The next time Harry and Draco meet is at the same club roughly two months later, but this time on the main dance floor.
It took being told that it’s obviously in the sixth-year potions textbook for him to realize how stupid he was being.
Mother even helped me pick out some jewelry to go with it- later that week she took me to get my ears pierced.”
I looked down at my feet before looking back up at him.  "I thought you were using me.  I thought you left because you didn't want it to be anything more than good sex.  So I didn't push it.  But Harry, I've been flirting with you all day!  You haven't reacted to any of it!  You're giving me the most mixed signs on the planet, dumbass."
They exchanged a look and burst out laughing, tea shooting out of Potter's nose.  Which, of course, caused them to laugh more, but Potter's laughter was joined with shouts of sudden pain.
He’s not a very good listener, constantly interrupting me with questions and comments. I just rolled my eyes and moved on, which I suppose he took as encouragement to continue to annoy me.
It’s just, I finished like 40 hats and scarves and the weather is starting to get cold, so I figured- but you don’t have to-”
“Alright, you stay here, and I’ll go get us something. You can borrow some trousers if you can find ones that’ll fit your uncannily long legs,” Draco teases.
Harry turns to Draco, stopping in front of the door to his apartment, locking eyes with the slightly shorter man.
That’s how Harry ended up spending the next hour and a half being dressed up in more fabrics and colors than he thought possible.
Would he remember any of this in the morning?  How would he act around me?  Could it happen again?  Today had been his best day for a long time.  Neither of us thought about the war or our scars or pain... we both just existed together.  It's kind of like... we were healing.
He thinks quickly and mumbles a hex that sends Draco’s water bottle flying off the desk and across the room.
After dinner, I made sure mum was comfortable and I went up to my room to do some work for my Auror training.  After all the wrong I did, I at least want to make an effort to do good.
He dashes out of the bathroom, ignoring the part of him that wanted to stay put and let Harry catch him, and sprints down the hall.
“And I just don’t know what my problem is, guys.  I mean I totally support you two-” Harry gestures to Dean and Seamus “-but something about Draco dating men just makes me lose it.  Is selective homophobia a thing?”
I turn to him. “Pardon, did you just suggest playing a wizarding game where things literally explode while we’re on a muggle airplane, fourty-thousand feet above the ground?
First, it’s the top of his wrist, so he takes off his watch. But when the itching spreads to his elbow and shoulders and neck, he gets concerned.
"That would be wonderful!" I glanced at my watch. "Oh, I've got to go. I was going to spend some time with my friends this afternoon. Thank you so much for the tea Narcissa, the scones were delicious."
He realizes that he really didn’t know what to expect because when Harry comes down the hall and stops, staring at him anxiously, his heart skips a beat.
An hour later, he’s outside the door of a rather ordinary looking apartment with a large thermos of soup in hand.
Harry glances over to see Draco blush shamefully.  “Shit.  Sorry.  I forgot the charms, I was just a little caught up in the-“
Hurrying through the crowd of people, I make my way cautiously towards her with no idea of what I'm going to say or how I'm going to say it.  But I keep moving because I know I need to.
Two pairs of eyes instantly shoot to the point of contact, and Harry quickly releases Draco’s wrist.
“He looks at you the way I look at Ginny, the way Dean looks at Seamus, and the way Ron looks at Hermione.
“Well, depression is commonly caused by your brain not holding on to enough serotonin, the happy chemical.
It’s been four years since they last saw each other, and in that time Harry’s grown his hair out, kept stubble on his face, and gotten tattoos.
So it shouldn’t be surprising to Harry that he bumps into someone he knows almost every time he comes here, which isn’t very often, but still.
The man nods, causing his raven black hair to bounce messily on his head and it's all Draco can do to force himself to look away and grab his tools.
But Harry doesn’t intimidate Malfoy in the slightest, because when the blond looks up from his breakfast and catches sight of Harry, he chokes on the piece of toast he’s eating.
The sharp voice of the flight attendant standing next to me brings me back to reality, where I’m being fussed at for not having buckled my seatbelt.
Harry, already in nice robes, heads to the Great Hall early, figuring he’ll walk around and reminisce.  But his plans are interrupted by something falling from a staircase above and hitting his head then clattering to the floor.
“I said I’m sorry.  How can I make it up to you?”  Harry can hear mild frustration in Draco’s tone and senses an argument coming.
Maybe he’s wrong… maybe Draco doesn’t return his feelings.  But he doesn’t let that stop him, because there’s no way he’s going another day without Draco knowing how he really feels.
Teddy tilts his head at the blonde’s uneasy face, “Kitty?” he asks, holding the squirming cat up towards Draco.
“Harry, why are you asking all these questions? Where does that sudden interest come from? Is there something you are hiding from us?” Molly asks with a worried face.
“I don’t give a flying fuck!” I interrupt him, growling, “The ministry knows about my roommate, so I don’t care in the least what kind of business you have. I won’t answer one fucking question until they send someone with at least a sense of decency and compassion. Not to mention the little thing called patience. And if I see or hear from you ever again I am telling the minister to throw you out. Am I making myself clear?”
Just as I am finishing that thought, the cackle sounds again. But this time I am unable to move and a figure that looks like a dementor floats down on the other side of the clearing. I scream when I realise that the being has Voldemort’s face.
“It’s okay. Just be more careful next time,” Hermione replies while I work on keeping Draco steady, murmuring to him about horses.
“I know,” I argue, frowning at her, “But his injuries can be healed. There are spells, potions or ointments that can even make his scars disappear,” I snatch the list from her hands, scanning over it, “I’m not a mind healer, but I am sure there are ways to heal him.”
Anyway it works in my favour as all the Malfoy house elves are still in the Manor. But unfortunately the Manor is classified as a dark magical site. That means you need a special permission to be allowed to enter the wards that were placed around it. Ridiculous if you ask me. The ministry should focus on other things than that. And it apparently it does sometimes since it takes me two whole weeks and three letters until I finally get said permission. Sometimes they are unbelievable…
With a sigh I pull the boxes towards me. I take the lid of the first one. It smells slightly of fire and ashes and I pull a face. With a grin I pull out the first object. A small, stuffed, green dragon. It is worn like the most loved toy of a child. A wistful smile makes it’s way onto my face when I realise that it was most likely Draco’s. My search produces a small medallion. Some photos of the family in happier times, a baby Draco which makes me giggle at the sweet picture. The next are papers containing information especially important for the Malfoy family. The second box is the same but mostly stuffed with papers. Malfoy business and ancestry. Then I find what appears to be the marriage certificate of Narcissa and Lucius.
And indeed it works. After a few times of this, Draco’s head turns down to the little animal who meows when he feels the grey eyes settle on him. Another bump and the right hand lifts again. Dragon purrs and rubs his head against the pale skin. The blonde’s movements are slow and unsure as he runs it up and down the cat’s head, but the animal rewards him with a loud purr nonetheless. It’s like Dragon can understand how damaged Draco is and purposely encourages him. I smile and turn around to my friend who has come closer by now.
With that, she apparated away.  I closed the door and turned to Harry.  "So you promise you weren't just using me for sex?  You really want something with me?"
I saw the soup and how good it smelled and went to drink it but my lips felt... tingly.  His kisses from the night before lingered on my lips.
"I think ash floors would look good, give the place a homey but modern feel.  What do you think?" Narcissa asked me.  I tried to remember what ash floors looked like, but was drawing a blank, and she could tell because she summoned the floor sample to show me what it looked like.
He’s pulled out of his trance by Harry’s lower half inevitably emerging from the water as well and turns his head away rapidly.
I only notice because I try to flip the page and he reaches out and places his hand over mine to stop me.
Draco punches in the numbers for the second skein of yarn, because for some reason, it didn’t register the scan.
He casts the spell that symbolizes the action, counterclockwise stirring twelve times at a medium pace, and the cauldron will recognize that and perform the action.
“Well, my parents were very prominent members of their corner of society, so I was raised with an appreciation of looking your best.
Draco ignores the way his heart jumps when Harry says ‘we’ and just perches on the edge of his desk, folding his arms.
As we talked, I discovered that the reason she added 'Black' to her last name is because, though she still loves her husband, she doesn't enjoy the baggage that comes with being just a Malfoy. So she became a 'Black-Malfoy'. Draco didn't want any connection to his father so he changed his last name to simply 'Black'.
Harry remembers that Neville works here as the Herbology Professor and it hits him that Hogwarts was just as much a home for him as it was for Harry…
He hasn’t felt this strongly about something since the Battle of Hogwarts… he doesn’t know what to do.
He doesn’t stop to see how Draco reacts, however, because he sees a glimpse of gold and goes for it.
Naked, in the castle, chasing each other… I simply cannot believe it,” McGonagall mumbles to herself, shaking her head and rubbing her eyes.
“Here are your attendance lists and class schedules for this semester,” McGonagall says, handing a bound folder to each staff member.
He’s definitely the kind of guy that would make plans and then spend ten minutes convincing himself to walk out the door and actually commit to said plans, so Draco orders himself a vanilla latte with hazelnut and a raspberry scones and waits patiently.
Draco’s head is just by Harry’s shoulder, and you can see that he’s slightly shorter than the raven-haired man.
Harry can’t decide which is worse: his hair falling out or the fact that the laugh of Draco Malfoy is making his knees weak.
"I can help with the renovation if you'd like! I quite like doing that kind of thing, and I could use something to keep me busy."
As I climbed the stairs I noticed that all the paintings were gone and I made a mental note to ask Narcissa where she had put them.
“Potter… how did I not know about your borderline abusive childhood?” Draco asks, more curious than anything.
I had come home this afternoon to hear that mum had guests coming over again, so I went up to my bedroom and asked a house elf to make me some dinner as I didn't want to bother mum and our guest.
The golden plates in the center of each table fill with food, and Harry is thrown back in time to when he was a first-year sitting at Gryffindor table with the Weasleys, Hermione, and Neville.
Harry’s smiling, but his smile is fading as he speaks because with every word, Draco looks more and more anxious.
Every time he locked eyes with Draco and felt tingles spread through his body.  Every time they sat just a little too close on couch to watch a muggle movie.  Every time their fingers brush and Harry’s heart raced.  When Draco was sick and Harry missed 4 days of work to take care of him.  Harry admiring Draco’s hair and hands and the way his nose hooks ever so slightly.
“Uhm…” he hadn’t actually expected himself to listen to his therapist, so he really doesn’t have a clue.
Draco rolls his eyes and moves on with his lesson, charming the chalk to write the ingredients on the whiteboard so Harry can collect them, as usual, and Harry does so, as usual.
It takes him a moment to remember that he’s been asked a question, and when he does respond, his voice comes out much shakier than he’d intended.
"Oh hello dear, Harry here was just telling me some stories about his Hogwarts years.  Would you like to join us?" Mum asked nonchalantly.
"Harry," Draco started, bringing my attention back to him.  "Harry, tell me something about you that I don't know."
“Now, Potter, if you could kindly turn my cauldron back from its hideous state as a pink toilet, I’d appreciate that,” Draco jokes, lightening the mood.
The second time, my eyes wandered towards him without my permission, and suddenly I was lost in the blush on his cheeks. He certainly was not blushing because I was looking at him.
There’s a thick, gold ring with three small emeralds inlaid sitting inside a velvet box in Draco’s hands.
This bad feeling of his doesn’t ease up at dinner, or after he’s gotten in the shower in his Professor Apartment.
It’s concise, and he obviously isn’t used to apologizing, but it’s a gesture of kindness all the same.
As we apparated home, he grabbed my arm that time, and I was honestly disappointed he didn't grab my hand.  At the beginning of the day I said I wouldn't give in to him but now...  all I wanted to do was kiss him.  And I didn't hate it.
I used to think of Potter and only recall of how much I hated how perfect he was… I later realized that was called envy, a trait I didn’t know I could possess.
His creamy hazelnut skin is smooth and nearly unblemished, save for a small scar peeking out from between his black birds-nest of hair.
“The third-floor corridor is where the Staff Apartments are now located.  In your first year, it was out of bounds for the protection of the Philosopher’s stone – a rule which you, Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Granger, and Mr. Longbottom blatantly ignored.  I’ll have Professor Longbottom escort you there after our chat.”
And then he... blushed?  No, that couldn't be it.  Except... he did blush.  And it was freaking adorable.  But he kept playing it off, so I ignored it.
Leaning into the touch, Harry’s smile melts Draco’s heart totally and absolutely, and he closes the gap.
Harry regrets not spending enough time with Neville when they were in school… he’ll have to make up for it this year.
Hesitantly, he copies the dark-haired boy and reaches into the bag, letting his fingers squish around the clay and pull out a significant chunk.
Draco is taking Harry’s shoulder measurements - the man has very broad shoulders - when they lock eyes in the mirror.
Harry begins to worry, since Draco hasn’t been turning around for long enough periods of time for Harry to set the action on the spell, and the potion is almost complete.
“Well if you’re so good, you do it!” Draco says, huffing and spraying clay water everywhere, sending Harry into another fit of giggles.
“Yes… and you still…” Draco gestures awkwardly to his cheek and neck, which Harry’s lips had been decorating only moments before.
“So, the lesson is don’t meddle with love potions unless your job specifically deals with it or you absolutely have to.
Draco absolutely melts at the sound of the man's voice; sweet music like raspberry honey pours from between his full lips.
Harry looked at me funny.  "Alright then... well how are we going to get there?  I'm fairly sure you're not going to want to go by muggle transport."
By the time we checked everything out and hauled it behind the Ikea where we could cast a shrinking spell, we were both exhausted and slap happy.
"Don't- don't tell me you've got some kind of... messed up relationship going on.  I don't need a step-father, much less a step-father that's younger than me."  I said very firmly.
“Also, if we could all be kind to Professor Potter, as it is his first year teaching, that would be appreciated.
He hears a moan from the bedroom beside his and cringes.  He’d better put up silencing spells, or it’s going to be a long night…
If he had only stayed quiet about his worsening anxiety, she might not have sent him on this wild goose chase that brought him across England to Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
"Narcissa... I really don't think that would work.  I mean, I suppose I would be willing, only for a few hours, but there's no way you'll get Mal- Draco to agree," I said hopelessly.
Harry gets an owl back from McGonagall allowing them to borrow the pitch and informing them that she removed the anti-apparition wards from that area temporarily.
“I would be flattered that you think I’m smart, but your standards can’t be very high, considering…” Draco says, gesturing Harry.
It took a long time, but we finally had it all sorted.  We kept a few of the beds because we decided that they could be re-stained to match whichever room they were placed in.  We would have to reupholster all the sofas and would need a new dining room table, among other things.  I was excited to go furniture shopping with Narcissa, because she has great taste.
He has this oddly suspicious feeling in his gut, but he doesn’t think too much of it because the idea of being able to embarrass Potter twice in a row is much too enticing.
Harry sits and thinks about this for a minute (which is a first because he generally never thinks before doing things).
I lowered my cock into his mouth and he licked me up and down and sucked me and blew me.  I watched his own hand on his cock, pumping up and down in the way he likes.  His teeth scraped the full length of my cock.
Waking up with Harry next to me would've been perfection.  But instead I woke up with a dent in my mattress.  I didn't have a headache from the alcohol though, so he must've gotten me a hangover potion at some point.  Which meant he cares about me.  But he couldn't... or else why would he have left?
My first thought is that someone kidnapped him for revenge, but there was no breach in the security barriers. It makes little sense. When I arrive back in the entrance hall, I realise that Draco’s coat and an old hat that was on the shelf there are gone. He must have taken them. Did he… leave on his own? It would work since the security only blocks attempts to get in, not getting outside. But why would he do that? We discussed that he was nowhere near stable enough to go out on his own and he agreed that he wouldn’t try. Was he taken after all?
“Okay, now I still need you to turn over. I know you hate this, but I can’t leave it like this,” I urge him, softly pushing him from the side. He goes lax again, causing me to cringe, “Sorry, I really am. But I have to do this.” As he is completely pliant, I can turn him over, so he is leaning against the wall on the other side of the tub. My cheeks are bright red, but I run the washcloth over his backside. I run my tongue over my lips nervously, “Look I hate to do this too, but you have to endure it,” my own hand is shaking as I clean the last of him.
“Well, you remember how I asked you about that Spy A. And Ginny said I look like I am in love when I think about whoever this is. But I don’t know him at all. And it’s a guy!” I grumble, burying my face in Teddy’s soft hair (currently black to fit my own locks).
“I have the money theoretically,” I answer, a good horse can’t be that expensive and with both my vault and whatever Hermione can get back for Draco we should be able to pay for it, “But if you have your own horse you need to take care of them every day and I don’t have the time for that. Draco can’t go out alone and he’s not clear every day.”
“It’s okay, Draco. I am not going to hurt you. Just let me see your arm, okay? There is nothing you should be ashamed of. Please Draco,” I plead, continuing to stroke his right hand.
I snort, nothing new. She on the other hand does look better than this morning. Maybe she actually got a nap in. That gets my hopes up for Draco’s state.
What triggers Draco for the first time is something that has happened before and if it did, it got a flinch from him at worst or nothing. It’s after breakfast and I am carrying our used plates back to the kitchen when I hear something shatter from the living room. At first I don’t pay it much attention, since Draco has dropped numerous things before and usually only waited for me to pick it up. But it abruptly ends the humming Draco had been doing and I frown. Then suddenly a yowl from Dragon sounds, which has me immediately turning back to the living room.
“Not even go out once? You know, go to a bar or a club. Go get a drink and maybe find someone to flirt with?” she eyes me curiously
For a moment silence falls and I hope he will agree because he could prove that he is indeed innocent this way. On the other hand I am not even sure if I would trust the court to accept that testament if he gave it.
He shoots me a look that is trying very hard to seem annoyed but to me panic sounds more appropriate. He makes a sound like a growl, I would say he is frustrated with himself. But in the end he does a step back and lets me open the door. I move past him slowly before passing the doorstep. I don’t walk any further though, remaining on the top step. The sidewalk is still a few meters away and we are still inside the protection charm so none of the people walking past can see us. The moment the door swung open and the sounds of the street flooded in, Draco stiffened, doing half a step back before he can stop himself. He looks caught somewhere between fear and determination. Not exactly knowing what to do I wait patiently for him to make his move.
Draco exists first, turning to see if Harry is behind him and hears him say, “Headmistress… if it’s any consolation, I think we have gotten over our rivalry from school.
"Yep.  He came out to me and the rest of us Weasley's, along with Hermione, right after we broke up.  He's gay."
“I can’t take this!” Seamus bursts into laughter, causing everyone to follow suit, including a very confused Harry.
McGonagall sits behind the desk and gestures for him to take a seat.  As he sinks deep into the cushion of the chair he’s reminded of all the times he did so in his youth.
of September is the day this all began, really.  Although the real time of it all can be debated, none of the following events would’ve happened if Harry James Potter hadn’t accepted Headmistress Minerva McGonagall’s offer to let him teach Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
If all eyes were not already on him, Harry tries to stumble backward and trips over his chair, still choking on bread and waving his hands towards his crotch area in an effort to cool it off.
Draco? Gay? But he shagged practically every girl in our year, and others! Well, good for him, I suppose. I didn't know why that made my heart leap so I chose just to keep talking.
"I just know.  Don't worry about it.  I knew one or both of you would come home drunk and hungry, so I prepared.  That's what a mother does.  I'm not going to ask questions.  Just go take the soup and potions up to Draco."  She smiled a motherly, knowing smile.
Even Draco seems like he’s trying not to smile, despite shaking his head and cursing Harry under his breath.
Harry’s right, of course. Draco was only afraid that Harry had been putting it off because he didn’t want to see him, but here they are, figuring out what they want for dinner for the party.
About two hours into my studying, I heard a knock at my door, forgetting that it could be Potter (I refused to call him Harry), and called out "Come in!"
"Bah! What are you doing? Don't you remember my room is strictly off-limits? Get out! Stand in the hallway!"
For a moment, it’s just the two of them laying there together, and the world around them has stopped.
Harry thinks for a moment and tries to imagine Draco walking through the front door with a woman on his arm, but the second he imagines them kiss he squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head.  “Yeah, I would.”
"I'm sorry that I was ten steps off of my target, sue me!"  He replied, turning and walking into the pub.
The rest of the morning went well, and after lunch we all walked around Hogsmeade just to hang out. It was so much fun, just catching up with them. But the afternoon had to come to an end, so I said goodbye to them all and left to go back to Narcissa's house.
Narcissus Clothing is his fashion business on Mainstreet where he hosts fashion shows, designs his own clothes, and has a tailoring service; it's October and his business is finally booming.
“What part of ‘use two hands’ are you not understanding?” Harry says, laughing so hard he’s clutching his abdomen.
off of them, smiling.  The place could be called home after a few renovations and some final spells to cleanse the place of the Dark Magic left behind.
“I didn’t know what you’d want so I got a bit of everything,” Draco says bashfully. It’s a strange emotion on him.
My eyes widened slightly.  The 'baby' just slipped out.  I could've sworn I saw Draco smile, but I didn't stick around to find out.  I slipped my arm out from under him and untangled our fingers.  I threw on my t-shirt and grabbed the rest of the clothes off the floor.  Walking out of his room, I glanced back at him.
Draco tells himself that Harry didn’t buy anything because he forgot, not because he only came to the store to check up on Draco.
He turns around, shaking his head to get the water off, and sees Draco pulling his shirt off and following him in.
He shakes those thoughts from his head, double-checking his measurement sheet and heading to the silks aisle, which he had just previously been stocking.
An hour later, he’s danced with two boys and a very tall woman that could probably crush his skull between her thighs, and he’s having a blast.
Harry gets back to their flat totally unprepared for what he’s about to do.  Unlocking the door, he hears the TV on and knows that Draco is inside, sitting on the couch, waiting for Harry to get back from his weekly pub outing with his friends.
His friends have called him, Harry’s friends have called him, but no word from Harry himself. Dammit.
“Professor McGonagall!”  Harry exclaims.  She looks like she hasn’t aged a day, of course.  Seeing her makes him realize just how much he missed her.
"Well, we have been enemies for quite a few years. While I could put our differences behind us, as they were really childish, I don't think friendship is in our future."
“Your hair looks no different when you’re awake than after you’ve been sleeping for ten hours,” Draco says, attempting to be endearing. Obviously, it doesn’t work, because Harry gives him a look and detaches himself from the blonde man.
I forced the door open, my mouth on his.  Damn he tasted good.  I kicked the door shut and pulled out my wand, casting Muffliato on the door so no one could hear him scream.  'Cuz he would.
“To make up for all the time we’ve spent not kissing,” Draco agrees, pulling Harry onto the couch next to him.  They spend the rest of the evening cuddling and behind soft boys, and all of their friends are finally satisfied that they’ve gotten their heads on straight.
"Oh, you're both here, good!"  She glanced down at our hands, which were still together, and smiled.  "I was just hoping to teach Harry the wall painting spell, but Draco I'm sure you can do it yourself.  I'll leave you two alone."
When the light hits it just right, the vase even seems to sparkle like river water underneath the summer sun….
He’s feeling proud of himself and has almost made it out the doors to hide the clothes when Harry says his name.
“Get your head out of the Amortentia before you drink it, nitwit!” Draco exclaims, awkwardly dragging the pink toilet away from Harry.
"Yes sir," he winked before putting his hands on my ribs and lightly trailing them down to my waist before yanking my pants down.  The waistband grinding over my cock made me groan with pleasure.  Then his hands climbed back up my legs, his strong fingers caressing the inside of my thighs.  My knees got week and I had to grab his shoulders to keep from falling over.  He reached under the fabric of my briefs and up to my cocked where he gently pinched it before slipped out again and pulling my briefs down too.  My hard-on sprang up and Harry drank in the sight hungrily.
“Ugh! Why is everything with you about sex!” I exclaim, blushing for the umpteenth time and wishing I had taken the red-eye flight instead.
I had just gotten home from Christmas Shopping when an owl flew up to my window and began screeching. So I didn't disturb my neighbors, I quickly opened the window and gave Narcissa's owl some treats before reading the letter.
Harry and Draco work through their differences in the way that most men in their early twenties do- by not confronting the problem.
"Well, thank you for the thought but I didn't need to be woken up," I tried to say tartly but it came out a lot shakier than anything.
When the waitress comes back, he pours his coffee into his recently acquired mug and takes a sip, making the stupid face Draco’s ever seen and he loves it.
It’s like watching a stream be united with the river, sparkling and seamlessly blending into one greater whole.
“Professors Potter and Malfoy, do we have a problem?” McGonagall’s sharp voice rings out behind them.
“Black coffee with caramel swirled in, if you can, thanks,” he says, giving the girl a polite smile and turning back to Draco’s abhorred expression.
Some people spend their entire lives searching for that scent, but they can never find it because their mind has corrupted it so far that it’s incomprehensible.
Harry and Draco have this silent agreement not to prank each other anymore, but he just can’t pass up this chance.
Nor when he’s rubbing shampoo into his birds-nest hair, despite the fact that it feels a bit stickier than normal.
“You may have won the game, but I won something else entirely,” Harry says, thinking about how he’s never ever going to forget how Draco looks right now.
Draco wakes up warm and comfortable, more so than usual. He angles his body to the left a bit, letting the human-shaped weight fall into him.
I quickly wiped under one of my eyes and pushed my hair in front of my face, slightly shielding it from view.
His breathing has steadied, and his hands aren’t shaking nearly as badly, so Harry takes this to be a good sign.
He’s dropping flower petals all over the floor and putting the roses in a vase when he hears Harry wake up and Ron talking to him.
Harry can feel his face flushing for whatever ungodly reason and shakes it off, walking around the blond in front of him.
Harry has discovered that he really doesn’t like it when Draco goes brings home his one-night stands.  He doesn’t like it when Draco goes on dates, either, but it’s worse when someone comes home with him.  He always gets this awkward feeling, like he’s angry and triggered.
"Draco?  Draco I want you to know that I have company coming over at noon for tea.  You can stay or go, your choice."
God, I couldn't believe it. My mother? Friends with my childhood enemy? It's my worst nightmare. No actually, my worst nightmare is if my mother started
Draco is about to huff and discard his fruitless search through the purples when something small catches his eye.
"Oh pull yourselves together!  Your adults now, not first-years.  Be nice and use each other's first names," Mum said.
Draco pretends not to have heard, but he can’t deny the feeling of warmth that blossoms in his chest at hearing Harry admit that out loud. So, two men walk in comfortable silence, side-by-side, towards the Professor Apartments.
But there's no way he felt the same way.  I mean, Draco was totally wasted.  Alcohol makes you horny, he was so drunk he probably just... acted on impulse.  Forgot it was me.  He was using me.  Yea, that's it...
The rest of the day was uneventful.  I got back home at about 15:00 and mum's company had left, so I finished off the scones she made and we settled down to play a game of wizard's chess together.
As I walked towards where Narcissa had been standing, I found that she was heading in the opposite direction from me.  Towards Florish and Blotts.
He’s got white roses (Harry’s favorite flower for merlin knows what reason) and chocolate cake and a promise ring.
"Draco?  Draco wake up!"  I shot up in bed and looked around, seeing Harry sitting there on the edge of my bed looking slightly concerned.  His hand was on my thigh which sent shivers down my spine.
They lock eyes once more, but properly this time, and all of a sudden Draco feels seen in a way that he’s never been seen before.
I catch up to her, standing maybe four feet behind her.  I gather up the last of my courage and gently say her name.
Harry nods slightly, inhaling the slight scent of rustic cologne radiating off of the man in his arms.
He really should be more nervous about this job, since he isn’t trained in teaching, he’s trained in fighting.  However, he knows just about every defensive spell on earth – the good ones and the bad ones – and Auror training taught him more about using and handling them.
“When I say throw the clay, I mean onto the wheel, not your face!” He chokes out between laughs, clutching his stomach.
He's suddenly hyper-aware of the leather chair he’s sitting in, the cold floor beneath his bare feet, and the sound of Draco walking closer.
He really, really likes this. He doesn’t quite know what ‘this’ is, but he knows it makes him happy.
But luckily, only his blonde roommate emerges, and fully clothed as well.  Harry realizes he’s not wearing a shirt and chastises himself, blushing slightly.
"He already knew. I told him a few weeks ago when he told me he's gay, too," Narcissa said. Then she looked at me, eyebrows raised to see if it was okay to tell him that and I nodded. It's not like I'm ashamed or need to hide it.
When he’s awake, he admires Harry, letting his feelings sort themselves out. When he’s asleep, he dreams flashbacks to times when Harry was particularly... attractive.
I specifically chose a seat near the front of the plane to minimize interactions with muggles, and now I have to deal with the consequences of that decision.
After attempting to fix my hair but giving up, I headed downstairs and poured myself a cup of coffee in a to-go mug so that I could head out immediately.
Thankfully she seems to get the hint because she turns around immediately to attend a different table on the other side of the café. Draco automatically relaxes the moment she’s gone, even if it’s only minimally. His hands are shaking even worse now when he hides his face behind them again. I long to reach out to touch his trembling shoulder, but touch might startle him again, so I try to get his attention first.
I learned early that touching his arm is a safe action as long as I avoid his wrists, especially putting pressure on them. I pinned his right hand down once to keep him from hurting himself. It only got me an even worse panic attack and he passed out a few moments later. But what is worse are areas like his legs or chest. Unless absolutely necessary I avoid touching him anywhere like that. He jumps, scares or freezes way too fast there. Another thing we have to work on.
She smiles, a fake smile, she’s as good at pretending as I am, “No, I am just a friend. Nothing more. Orion’s mother died long ago.”
Also I need someone in whose name the letter ‘A’ has some significance. Since Snape is sometimes referred to as ‘S’ in notes which could have been seen by the enemy, I guessed that I need to find a name which starts with an ‘A’. Draco Lucius Malfoy doesn’t include that. Still sometimes I wish it is really him because then I would have a more than valid reason to drag him out of Azkaban.
My head whips up only to discover a wide eyed Draco in the doorframe. His eyes flit between Dragon, his anchor, in the hands of an unknown toddler and us, sitting near the fireplace. Andromeda’s eyes are as wide as her nephew’s. My body stiffens, remembering Draco’s reaction to his aunt’s name and the sisters’ resemblance, even if it has lessened with Andromeda’s grey hairs she lets show openly nowadays. I would love to storm over to the man to hug him and assure him everything is safe. But from experience I know that fast movement is the last thing he needs right now. Even one wrong twitch can send him panicking in such a moment. So I stay still and make sure Andromeda does the same.
He chokes, chest seizing as the panic overwhelms him. He curls in on himself, left arm moving on purpose for once. I stare at him wide eyed, having no idea what I am supposed to do right now. Touching Draco seems like the absolutely wrong move at the moment. It doesn’t take long for the grey eyes to fog over again. He shudders and his head falls down.
And I do, in Diagon Alley. I come from buying groceries for Ginny. She seems to like ordering me around and making me do her errands. I am nearly glad I spend most of my time in Hogwarts, but I wanted to see my children. There you are walking down the street. Your hair is shining so beautifully in the afternoon sun, my heart seizes up at your picture. Damn, I thought I got over that reaction to you long ago. I see you laugh about something your companion said. Your companion. For some reason my heart tightens again when my eyes wander to the person walking besides you.
He just tugs at my hair, causing me to look at him. The crooked smile is back on his face and for once his empty orbs are focused on me. His eyes seem to say ‘Don’t worry, I can deal with it. I am past it’. I only shake my head and pull him close another time. And chuckle wryly, tears still on my cheeks.
“No, daddy said the Manor was too dark. He sold it and built a new mansion twenty miles outside from London,” he answers carefully.
“Draco,” I sigh in fond exasperation, “Please let me go. I’m tired and I want to go back to my bed to sleep.”
“Why would I tell you that? So you can taunt him or sell him out to the ministry by accusing him of practicing black magic again?” he asks back with a challenging gaze.
He should be angry, but the homeliness of the place mixed with the scent of clay and scones draws Draco in immediately, against his will.
“I would like to congratulate you all on making it into whichever house you have achieved and remind you that your sorting represents where you’ll succeed the most, not where you’re required to spend all your time.
When he stands up, he turns to face the person coming down the stairs who he assumes is the owner of the sour candy.  Turns out, it’s none other than Draco Malfoy.
"I came to ask you to tell your mother I'd be heading over to my place to see if the potions were done working yet. If she comes home will you do that for me?" He spoke with a slightly annoyed and exasperated tone.
There’s a brown paper package on his desk that definitely was not there the night before, and he can only assume it was delivered this morning.
He’s got to come up with something perfectly mediocre and embarrassing so that Harry absolutely will not expect anything more serious in the coming months.
He melts for the umpteenth time that day at the sight of Harry’s smile and knows he’s truly in deep.
I turned around and walked towards the proper entrance.  "Yes, of course I've been here.  I just zoned out, that's all."
"I know this might seem strange, but I really have been trying to change.  I know I was never good during the war or before then, but I always felt a terrible pang of guilt and sadness watching everything that my family did in serving the Dark Lord.  So, if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to ask.  I have connections to places if you ever need help.  Think about it, okay?
"Don't fret, Harry.  We're friends.  I don't care that you're not wearing pants or that you slept with my son."
She left me alone and came back to find me in one of her dresses - she’s a bit on the shorter side, and I was a tall child - and I had just finished slicking back my hair when I told her I was ready.
"Do you still want help assembling the furniture today?  I'm free all day," I suggested apprehensively.
He kissed me back and it was magical.  I wanted the kiss to go on forever.  But it ended when the doorbell rang.  We sprang apart, startled by the noise and walked to the door, opening it to find my mother standing there.
He’s bringing his spoon closer to his mouth to take another sip of stew when Potter bumps his elbow into his chair, jostling the stew off the spoon and into his lap.
He exits the box to go congratulate his Alma Mater team, all the while wondering why he has such a bad feeling about Malfoy.
Harry has made a habit of going into Draco’s classes when he doesn’t have classes of his own to teach.
I risk a glance back at Potter, and we lock eyes again. Only this time, I respond with a snide look and roll my eyes. There. Maybe now he’ll stop looking at me.
Draco turns around for a second time to retrieve the ladle and Harry mutters the second part: defining the trigger.
“I’ve won the last three games, Potter. You’re not going to start winning now,” I smirk, feeling incredibly proud of myself. Mother would tell me to be humble. Father would tell me to use it to my advantage.
I chuckled.  "There's a lot of things you don't know about me.  What kinds of things should I tell you?"
"No, that's fine I suppose.  But I want you staying in our guest bedroom, certainly not in the same room as my mum," I said, still scared that they would get into a relationship.
During this lesson that Harry’s dropped into, Draco is teaching his sixth-year potions class to brew Amortentia (
Hearing him moan was my favorite thing and before I knew it I was jerking him off while fucking him hard.  It felt so good.
There are no other customers in sight, and if not for the hum of machinery Draco wouldn’t have noticed the cute, raven-haired boy sitting at one of the wheels, throwing clay.
I mean, access to Draco’s classroom, gaining his trust, strengthening their teasing relationship… who
Harry smirks and licks his lip, staring Draco directly in the eyes which Draco’s insides turn to jelly.
Neither man notices the bewildered looks they’re receiving from one Neville Longbottom, or the money passed from McGonagall’s hand to Flitwick’s.
"He's not my father.  And fine.  I suppose I can deal with him for one day.  But there's no way on earth you'll get him to agree, so good luck."
Stacks of unwashed dishes sit in the sink, and various food items and dishes are scattered across the counter.
"We can use spells to muffle and shit.  Just go."  I was glad he was letting me apparate us since he was drunk.  We appeared outside Draco's room and he shoved me against the door, pushing it open and forcing us inside.
He doesn’t know where the sudden playfulness has come from, but he knows that it definitely shouldn’t be for Potter.
Harry chokes on his dinner - a seemly recurring event - and pounds the table so hard that his entire bowl of piping hot stew lands in his lap, causing him to stand up in shock and cry out.
"-yes, after we had the best fucking sex ever, I layed there, and I held you, and I felt your breathing and I thought about it and figured you wouldn't want anything more with me.  And I know you don't.  But I do.  For some crazy reason, being around you makes me feel happy.  I love that.  I wanna... I wanna be with you Draco.  Even if it doesn't last, I wanna savor every moment.  Because you're amazing and gorgeous and sexy and you smell good and- I don't know.  I'm sorry.  You can go.  I just figured I'd shoot my shot, you know?"
Anyone who tells you that saying things out loud makes it easier to accept is full of thestral poop.
He sets out a pad and pencil and then takes out his measuring tape, turning around to face Harry, whose arms are extended in front of him, parallel to each other.
I am not sure what to make of his reaction so I grip his shoulder, ignoring his flinch from the expected pain this time, “What’s wrong? I think that was incredibly brave. You risked your life. You and Snape are the only ones who did that.”
Unwilling to break the calm atmosphere I set to watch him. My eye falls on a toppled stack of books next to the door. I guess that is what caused the crash earlier. But that was stacked securely, I remember that clearly. And Draco was way too far away from it, not to mention that he wouldn’t be able to move over there. So what threw it over?
“Hey Draco,” I try to catch his attention, “I brought a new friend for you,” nothing more than another blink, “Do you remember the cat you had when you were young? I think she was called Dhalia,” I exchange a look with Hermione, “So I thought maybe a new cat could be a nice friend for you.”
She nods softly in agreement, “I think you might be right. It just makes the story sadder. Anyway, even though this is some heavy scar tissue on his arm, I don’t think it would inhibit his movement or cause him any serious pain. Some stinging maybe if he moves it the wrong way but nothing worse. So like I said the reason he doesn’t move his left arm is most likely psychological. He probably connects some kind of trauma with the dark mark on it.”
The first he grabs is Shenan’s bridle, pulling it onto his right shoulder. Then he turns to the saddles, completely forgoing the simpler girths Andrea used. When he reaches for the one labelled with the mare’s name, I reach out to stop him. But I retreat my hand again before touching him and instead speak up.
She chuckles, eyebrows raised, “You’re very specific and there are a lot of things to consider. May I ask what you need the cat for? Why are you buying one now?”
We process in tiny steps towards the stable. But to my surprise as soon as he hears the sounds of horses, Draco seems to stretch forward, instead of blocking and pulling backwards. This time it’s me who stares at Hermione over the blonde’s shoulder, but with an encouraging smile.
There are enough people that give me their attention, but only because I am supposed to be their hero. The bloody saviour of the wizarding world. How I hate this title by now. You are actually one of the few people who actually see me as just ‘Harry’. So no, I don’t really want you to leave, but I am sick of yelling insults at each other. It is so often these days that I wish we could be friends, instead of enemies. Talking about everyday problems instead of fighting with each other. Sometimes I even question whether my decision to refuse your hand in first year, was the right one.
Hoping the cat actually does as told, I focus instead on the blonde in front of me. I kneel down before him and take his shaking right hand in mines. He twitches at the contact but shows little action of pulling away. Not that he ever tries very hard. I don’t want to think about whether that’s because he’s still too weak to get enough strength together or because he was conditioned to not resist.
“That’s good,” he nods, “Thank you. You can go now. But tell no one, not even any of the other house elves.”
Until today I shiver when I think of that day. But no matter what I have tried I didn’t get any bit further in freeing Draco from his imprisonment. As for Spy A I still lack the final proof that it’s actually Draco. By now I have also checked off every other possibility just to make sure. The aurors found lists of the death eaters in Malfoy Manor. I managed to get a copy with the names of everyone who followed Voldemort. I went through every male name that had an ‘A’ in the initials. Half of them are dead, of the other half over two third are accounted for and I talked to them. In the end I can rule out all of them. That leaves me with five more who are either missing or have moved to other countries. But none of them seems anywhere believable. Three were lower ranked, another is nearly 70 now and the last proclaimed his belief in the dark lord even before he joined the death eaters. That leaves only Draco in the end. But I still lack the proof.
She clamps a hand on my shoulder and nods, “It’s fine. We will help him however we can,” she motions in the direction of a door at the end of the stable, “How about we sign the papers and draw up a first appointment?”
“Maybe that’s exactly what we need,” I grin and hand the cat over to her inspection, “A dragon to help another dragon.”
“Yes, I applied for an permission as soon as I heard what he was sentenced to. He doesn’t deserve it,” she sighs.
“Oh my god. All this time,” she breathes, “I thought Malfoy was just an asshole, but he put his life on the line during the war. He saved countless people and his reward is imprisonment until either death or insanity. The world is not fair.”
“Yes, yes,” I reply, pause for a moment and then ask, she was a member of the Order after all, “I just found something. Have you ever heard the name ‘Spy A’?”
“Why? Because you couldn’t finish your newest project to satisfy your saviour complex,” he snorts, now forcefully ripping himself away.
“You will be,” I say, slowly pulling his cold body towards mine until his forehead rests on my shoulder, “You will probably never return to who you were before, but I’m sure you will recover. You are strong enough for it,” I stroke his hair as he shudders, repeating words I said to Hermione many months earlier.
“He sneaked up on me and got me at wandpoint with my back to him. He had enough time to kill or at least stun me but he didn’t. Instead he waited until Hermione came around the corner and fired a spell at him.”
Suddenly I stumble and would have fallen if I hadn’t caught myself on a tree a few feet further ahead. I pant, eyes closed tightly as I take a moment to regain my balance. Luckily Voldemort seems to have disappeared. Thinking myself in a moment of peace I open my eyes.
“Here we are,” Michael says as he hands the three pieces of woods back to us, “Take good care of him. Merlin knows he needs it. It is always nice to see someone undeserving walk free of this prison. Even though his state dims the happiness quite a bit.”
Ron visited us three weeks ago. Thankfully Draco wasn’t in the living room when the red head fell out of the floo but we ran into him when he tried to find me. The blonde nearly did a jump backwards. He was rigid the whole time and looked ready to either flee or panic and curl up any moment. Since then we have been careful not to let him see any visitors, no matter who it was. Andromeda wanted to see him once when she came with Teddy. He is her nephew after all. He was sleeping deeply at the time so I brought her to his room. She broke into tears at the sight of his state. But apart from that and the occasional visit from Hermione, we keep him away from everyone else.
Clear eyes fix on me, “You have no idea of the conditions down there, do you Harry? No one can be okay down there. I would be surprised if he made it past the first year with part of his sanity intact. So no, Draco is not okay,” she rants and I swallow hard.
Finally Lou manages to finish your conversation. She says goodbye while I only click my tongue. I haven’t let go of her hand the whole time and as soon as you turned away she pulls me into a small side alley where no one can see us. That’s where I break down. I grab her and pull her close to me, relishing in the feel of human warmth I haven’t felt for years. But I am a Malfoy. Malfoys don’t cry. So I don’t, just hold her close and shake.
It means I have to search by hand. My first direction was the internet since I am not particularly familiar with navigating the magical market. I come up empty, of course. Sure, I find a few horses called Karina’s Dream, even a pretty famous one among them, but none of them fit Draco’s description. The only dapple grey I found is long dead, some show jumping Grand Prix winner from the 1950s.
“Why?” he bites back, head finally moving as grey eyes peek over his arm, “Complaining that your prisoner escaped? Did you get in trouble with your boss?”
“Hello Mr Potter, Andrea called already to tell me about you and Mr Black,” he looks towards the blonde, “I would be happy to help you.”
“I am aware that I am supposed to shake your hand now, but despite the fact that you are on the good side, I am still not going to go anywhere near you. Despite the headache killing me and the nightmares, I would like to be able to think clearly for a bit longer, so I am not going near any other human right now,” he immediately covers his previous words with annoyance.
My fingers clench in the material, “I can’t ask him some of those. So if he doesn’t answer all of them… Does that mean we won’t get anywhere in court?”
And indeed Draco has already managed over half of the distance. His steps are insecure and he has problems balancing himself, but he is doing it, in smaller steps than the usual human though. Four steps, five, six. With the seventh he reaches out his right hand to the wood and another move forward lands him against the other side of the hallway, where Shenan welcomes him by carefully nosing his cheek. He gives the light furred horse a smile despite the fact that his free hand is now clinging to the bars next to the horse’s window. He buries his face in the soft fur instead.
Two weeks later I am exhausted beyond belief. It hasn’t been easy since Draco started getting panic attacks about anything that triggers him. I stopped counting after it reached over twenty, four days in. The blonde has been triggered by any kind of stuff like Hermione predicted. In between the attacks he has mostly spent his time sleeping, exhausted from panicking. There have been instances where I had to put him to sleep by force because he couldn’t calm himself down. Between that and the nightmares I’ve gotten barely any sleep either. It hasn’t helped that we couldn’t get to the one thing that usually calms Draco down. Both of the horse therapy sessions we had scheduled for the two weeks had to be cancelled. Right before the first one, Draco got triggered by a careless wand movement. The day of the second one I found him screaming from a nightmare during his afternoon nap which then resulted in him being too exhausted and wired to go out in the evening.
Oh, if only you knew. But go on. No matter how painful it is for me, I only have to bear with this for three more months. Three more months of being enemies and then nothing.
“And he is,” I hurriedly explain, nearly falling over my words in the process, “Like 99% of the time. But there were some very few times when he kind of responded to me directly. It wasn’t like he talked or anything, but he seemed to understand my emotions and react accordingly.”
“Now I am dirty too, great. Doesn’t matter, I can wash up after you. Now come on,” I say, carefully leading him over to the bathtub.
“Believe me, I understand you. And I feel the same,” she shakes her head sadly, “He deserves a free life. But… He may not even want to come back, Harry.”
I sit there for nearly half an hour until I am calm enough to stand up again and splash water on my face. Damnit, I am used to nightmares, but this was a bad one!
In all honesty you have been behaving weirdly for months now. You withdrew from literally everyone. You sat alone, spent more time with Snape in the evenings. You quit Quidditch which is unusual for you, because as far as I could see you loved playing as much as I do. I just now realise how much I have been watching you. I know the way your eyes light up when you fly after the Snitch. I know the way you drink your tea in the morning. I know how you start to tap your fingers when you’re nervous and so much more. Only your disappearance brought to my eyes how much I actually care for you.
To my surprise he leans forward without a moment delay. His movements are still slow but determined this time. And then I freeze, because his mouth wraps around my jam covered finger without one second of hesitation. I twitch uncomfortably. Thankfully he stops soon and sits up straight again. His eyes become vacant again.
“I haven’t seen you for ages,” I say, smiling happily at being able to talk to you, “How’s it going?”
Hermione grins as she follows me to the next pair of doors, “You know sometimes I think your obsession with Malfoy has become a bit too strong if you start to copy his mannerisms.”
Deep wariness in his eyes Draco detaches his moving hand from the doorframe and carefully reaches for Dragon, like expecting even a toddler to pull his cat away from him again any second. When his fingertips touch soft fur, he twitches away at first. But when the cat gives a loud meow, he reaches out again and carefully grips the small creature. Lifting the cat out of Teddy’s hands, he hurriedly pulls the animal to his face and nuzzles the soft fur. Dragon releases a soft purr and Draco relaxes for a tiny bit. That earns them a satisfied grin from the toddler on the floor. Andromeda has a hand over her mouth, her eyes suspiciously wet.
She shakes her head sadly, “There is basically nothing left. Some charred ruins and nothing more. I’m sorry. The house elves made it out, none of them was killed. They were sent to Hogwarts to work there. Some of them protested quite a bit though, especially the head elf. And two others said they had to wait there until their masters returned. They swore they would do that. One of them later turned out to be Draco’s personal elf and the other was named Tilly I think,” she rummages in the pockets of her cloak and finally pulls two small boxes out. A short spell enlarges them back to normal size, “This is all they could salvage. Some small tokens and some papers. Apparently the majority of that was kept under some simple sealing. In short most of them are important papers or things that hold sentimental value.”
I stare at her surprised as she dumps Teddy back in my arms who squeals in delight. Then she hurries off somewhere upstairs again. My attention is diverted back to the baby in my arms as he giggles and tugs at my hair. I smile, his presence letting me forget my troubles for the moment. I hear his grandmother rummage around above us. After about five minutes later she comes back, nothing but a small scrap of paper in her hand. She sits next to me again.
Andrea eventually goes to collect him after he has adjusted the stirrups on his own as well. I can’t help but wonder how clear he is at the moment. Not completely, since his left arm seems still entirely unresponsive. I would guess most of what he is currently doing is muscle memory. He doesn’t have the coordination to get onto the horse on his own yet though, so I bring the steps with me when I join them in the middle of the hall.
“That’s good,” she nods, “It’s a step in the right direction. More than we could hope for, I guess. If he at least tried to honestly communicate and not just sat there completely apathetic.”
She squirms in her seat, clearly uncomfortable and saddened, “Uhm… Well, you have seen his left arm right? How disfigured it is over the Dark Mark?” I nod confused, “That’s self-inflicted, I’m pretty sure of it,” another swallow from her, which tightens the dread in my stomach, “I… I don’t want to sound insensitive or anything but…” even Hermione is apparently stumbling over her words, “When his memories come back, he’s going to be in a very bad place and I’m afraid he might do something harsh.”
The blonde snorts, “You Gryffindors and your idealised worldviews,” he shakes his head, “The court will always follow whatever currently fits best. I know for a fact that my father used his power and money to sway or position judges so the court would decide whatever he preferred. And he was by far not the only one who did that. I haven’t exactly been out into the world yet, but I doubt it’s any different now. The power simply shifted and now other persons are doing it.”
It earns him malicious snickers from all around the room. Murmurs about him being a liar and only wanting to save his skin drift to my ears. He ignores it even though I’m sure he can hear them.
I stop at corner to hold onto the wall for a few seconds. My eyes dart around frantically and I gasp when I spot a flash of white towards the end of the small alley I am staring down. Immediately I push off the wall and approach, making sure to not run to fast in case this is who I’m looking for.
“Taken everything from him that mattered and then broken him further,” Michael answers from the door, “Come on, let’s get him out of there. He has stayed here far too long and now he can finally leave. Don’t make it longer than necessary.”
“Yes…” she mumbles absentmindedly, “Actually no,” she sighs. Her pale face comes up to me, pained eyes meeting mine, “Look I know how important he is to you,” she starts and I feel a lump forming in my throat. Whatever she read, it’s not good. I fear that there is something really wrong with Draco. She swallows and stutters finally out, “But it may be better to let him go…”
I am not entirely sure what to think of what he said but I can’t help but smile as I happily comply with his request, “Of course I will stay, Draco. But you have to move over a bit.”
He snorts but doesn’t move. I see Lena approaching our table carefully, a questioning look in her eyes, but I shake my head and she turns away again. If we order something I will walk up to the counter myself to order and collect it.
Abraxas! ‘A’! The last piece of the puzzle I needed to solidify Draco as Spy A. He is it. He just used his third name to keep every last bit of suspicion away from himself. Now I only need proof. I have a plan which I hope will work. Not wasting any time, some of the reports of Spy A in my bag, together with Draco’s birth certificate, I apparate away.
“The scars just show what you survived through,” I argue, “Yes, it doesn’t look the most pretty, but it shows how strong you are.”
The scene I encounter is not what I expected. A shattered mug is indeed on the floor and Dragon stares at his owner scared, meowing questioningly. Draco himself is standing straight, every single muscle tense. Both hands are clenched, knuckles standing out of the whitened skin. His eyes are wide and sweat beads on his skin, he looks as if he is just keeping himself from screaming.
“Tell her my thanks the next time you see her,” I smile and take the basket, smiling in bliss at the delicious smells wafting up from it.
I give it a try. For a moment his eyes seem to avert, still unfocused sure, but much clearer than yesterday. Then he gives one of his small head shakes. No, it doesn’t hurt. Or at least he is trying to convince me that it doesn’t. He could be hiding his pain after all. Careful not to startle him, I reach my hand out again, but I don’t touch him. I hold it out to him, palm up.
She only hisses, “I can see it in your eyes. When you pour over those mysterious papers no one but Hermione and Ron are allowed to see. You are in love with her, aren’t you? Or is it a he, Harry? Is that why you never seemed to react much to me,” she sneers.
“Had,” I correct, “At least he says that. His family used to own horses, but they sold them. I am thinking of trying to track them down, but the papers got destroyed so it might be difficult.”
“Is he sleeping now?” I ask while pulling off my jacket and leaving my bag by the door, yawning widely.
Since the water bowl is already more brown than translucent, I make the water exchange itself wandlessly, since I discovered that my charge reacts negatively to wands (as far as he can react that is). While the water is heating, I start to untangle the dirty locks. It goes very slow, especially since I don’t have any experience with long hair and his is in an awful state. Soon I have the bowl back and continue on with his sides and arms. When I reach his left forearm and run the cloth straight over it, I stop in surprise. There is the dark mark, that much was clear, I saw it already after all. But what I didn’t see or expect were the deep scratches turned into thick scars running all over the mark. The tattoo partially disappears under the heavy injuries. Where does that come from? With curious eyes I take his left arm up, he is only moving the right one anyway. Inspecting it closely, I frown. I am surely not an expert in this but from what I can tell these scars date a good deal further back than the ones I saw on the rest of his body. From before the trials. Hell, before the final battle maybe even. Since none of Voldemort’s followers would do that, the only possibility is that he did that himself.
We make it to the café without any further incident and I urge him over to a booth in the corner, fitted with soft blue couches, keeping us completely out of the sightline of the people on the street. He lets himself be led and falls into the cushions exhaustedly, burying his face into shaking hands. His chest is heaving fast, faint trembles going over his body.
“Asleep? He hasn’t slept during the day in months now,” she looks worried now as she seats herself next to me.
“I can look after him for a few hours. Now get up,” I let myself be pulled to my feet, “Anything else new?”
“I am,” I carefully inch a bit closer to him, “You are out and about. Yes, you still startle every time some unexpected noise comes or a stranger approaches, but you used to be afraid of so much as going out into the backyard. You have conquered that fear and I know that you will one day manage to overcome these reactions.”
His hand comes back to slowly running over the dragon. He tilts his head at me in what I take as thanks. I smile when I see him focus on the toy, right hand closing around the animal. I smile a last time as I lean forward again to ease him down into the sheets again. He pulls the dragon to his chest, nose rubbing against the animal’s snout. He looks so much like a child in that moment it clenches my chest further. I stroke his hair until his eyes fall closed completely and his breathing evens out into calm sleep. Then I bend down, stopping just before pressing a kiss to his forehead like I do when I tuck in Teddy. But knowing he could react badly to the unexpected touch I instead straighten up and after another look to him, leave the room again.
He throws me another wary look before squatting down on the floor and digging out a brush and some kind of plastic oval with ridges and a hold. He stands back up and half turns towards the horse’s door, but never completely putting his back to me as if he expects me to hex him any moment. After a bit of fiddling he manages to unlock it and slip in with Shenan. As soon as her door creaks open, the mare retreats her head to welcome him inside. He strokes her head and murmurs lowly. She snorts and trustingly hangs her head while he steps up to her side. Using both hands he starts to run the brush over her fur for a few times, then drags the brush along the ridges of the plastic oval to get the accumulated dirt out. He repeats the process until he has covered one whole side of her and changes to the other by carefully ducking down under her neck. I lean against Shenan’s window and watch him until I can’t stop myself from asking.
I stare at the relatively small cat, green eyes locking with blue. It meows at me. Carefully I extend my hands and the girl puts Dragon into them. The little cat wriggles in my arms until he is comfortable, then meows again. I smile and stroke one hand over his fur, which is immediately rewarded with a loud purr. My smile brightens. I don’t know how, but I’m sure this cat is the right one. I lift my eyes to the shop keeper.
She grins as she hands the tome over to me. I huff as the heavy weight threatens to pull my arms down. Reading over the spell, I memorize it and the wand movements. After some minutes I turn back to the blonde and step to the bed. Taking a deep breath, I preform the two spells. Only to nearly choke on air when the lists come back. They are worryingly long. Before I can read them, Hermione hurriedly steps forward and rolls them up, so I can’t see.
Have you ever though what I would feel? I snort. I guess you did and that’s what landed us in this situation. Now that I think back, my thoughts land on that argument we had over why you quit playing Quidditch. Solved that too, but you must have been pregnant while we shouted insults at each other. I can only imagine how painful that must have been for you. Why, Malfoy, no Draco? Why? I cared so much for you. Did you feel differently? No, you wouldn’t have slept with me and tried to spare me the embarrassment afterwards if you did. I would have loved to take care of Orion and you. To become a family with you. Instead I had to wait until our grandchildren married.
The soft smile stays as I carefully approach the peaceful pair. I see Draco tense for a moment but when he looks up and only spots me, he relaxes. He even gives me a small smile when I settle next to him on the floor. He makes a sound in his throat and taps the book still laying on the floor.
“Please not. Not the cane,” he whimpers from behind his hand, even bringing the left one up with the help of his knee, “Not the cane. I will do anything.”
“You didn’t really either,” she grins, “Yet here we are,” then she shakes her head, “I’m not specifically doing this for Draco. I believe in justice and it’s not been served here, so I want to correct it.”
“I am trying to describe a personality similar to our cat since he seems to get along with him so well,” I snort.
I frown for a moment then I remember that I told Professor Javis about Draco after one lecture to get some information, “Both,” I chuckle wryly.
At least he’s calm, I feared he would be worse. But when I ask him what he wants to eat he doesn’t point at it anymore, like he started to in the last days. Instead we have to go through the longer routine of me picking everything up and him conveying ‘yes’ or ‘no’. In the end it still works out and he is peacefully munching on a biscuit when Hermione stumbles in tiredly. The door opening a bit quickly, startles Draco once more and he drops his food. I sigh and run a calming hand up and down his arm. Soon he accepts a new biscuit and eats it slowly. The girl seats herself on the sofa furthest from the blonde, a cup of coffee in her hands.
Instinctively my hands reach out to cover his, “It will come back to you. One day you will remember everything clearly.”
And come out the closest to Hogwarts that is possible with the barriers around it. Not wanting to wait any longer I break out into a run towards the castle. Once I reach the outer grounds I slow down. Ignoring all the curious looks from the students I stride through the long hallways until I reach the portrait behind which the kitchens are hidden. With an eager motion I push it aside and enter, causing countless house elf heads to turn towards me. A painful sting runs through my heart when I miss Dobby huddling over to me, falling over his feet in eagerness. I shake it off and focus my eyes on the chaos of small creatures in the room.
“Harry, I understand you want to help him. But maybe he really did what they said…” Hermione trails off when I throw her a look.
He frowns at me but nods hesitantly, “I will take an Earl Grey and… some pastry, I guess,” he fiddles with his sleeves beneath the table.
“From him? Nothing. I didn’t cure him for myself or to have a new project like he accused me earlier,” I frown.
But again I can’t help but question why you are so important to me? As much as I want to deny it, I think I have some kind of crush on you. You standing before me causes more feelings to steer up inside of me than when Ginny presses up against me. It’s weird. Do I love you? Maybe. Will you ever know how I feel? I guess not, I am with Ginny and you are not even looking at me. I twitch when my inner eye brings up a picture of happy family life, only it’s not Ginny who is holding a new-born baby next to me and a small boy, but it’s you. My hands clench as I stare at your impassionate face. Why won’t you even look at me? You don’t care at all? I guess you don’t. Will you ever know how much I care about you?
Another snort, his nose purposefully turning up further, “I am pretty sure you will notice when I will start babbling in child speech again.”
The voice is about to sound again which causes a momentary distraction for me and Draco manages to rip himself away from me. He can’t support himself tough and lands face first on the carpeted floor. For a second I have trouble sorting out my thoughts and am entirely frozen in place. Then my fighting instinct takes over and the first thing I do is casting a silencio around us so the voice is not heard anymore. Unfortunately it does nothing to calm Draco down. He is trying his best to scramble away on the ground. He is still screaming and whimpering, eyes wide and hands shaking. Hurriedly I kneel in front of him and touch his right arm, but all he does is jump, release a new scream and huddle away from me. I sigh and run a hand down my face. Only one option left. Forcefully put him to sleep once more.
“Hey Draco,” I lean forward and make sure his eyes are halfway focused on me before I continue, “You are better today, aren’t you? Do you understand what I am saying?”
Throughout what was my fifth year at Hogwarts his reports are still slightly sporadic, mostly just getting some information on dark magical things, stuff you can’t find out in normal libraries. Especially horcruxes. He also helps with suggestions as to what Voldemort could have actually turned into a horcux. Towards the end of the year, he starts reporting more about death eater movements as well. At some point he hints that he believes Voldemort wants to launch a big attack on the ministry. And that it has something to do with me. Duh, they used my connection to Voldemort to lure me there to get the prophecy.
‘Sorry, I had to leave. There was an emergency at the ministry. They might finally be moving forward concerning the Malfoy trial. I put Draco under a sleeping charm. It should alert you if something is wrong with him. Hermione’
It’s past nine o’clock in the evening when we decide to call it a day. Draco is nearly dozing against Shenan, his hand only moving very lazily. The two women smile as I pry my half asleep charge away from the horse. Hermione has made another appointment while I was watching him. He leans heavily on me when I take him in my arms, blond head lolling against my shoulder. He seems tired out by the day but happy and that’s more than I could’ve asked for.
It takes two more rounds of the hall until he returns to the middle of it. He loops his arm through one rein before stepping up to Shenan’s side and pulling the closure of the saddle tighter. The horse snorts, but lets him do it without complaint. He strokes a hand down her flank soothingly before continuing on to adjust the stirrups. When he returns to the side we can see, he stumbles and slumps against the palomino for a second. I sigh, recognizing the signs. Andrea and I step forward to catch Shenan who is nosing the boy in confusion. But before we can get closer than half the hall he straightens again, shaking his head and rubbing his temples. I pull Andrea back to our post near the entrance.
Neville and Harry spend about two hours wandering the castle together, catching up and joking around.
The logical course of events would be for Harry to get Draco back, so he’s been staying extra alert, watching for anything suspicious in Potter’s behavior.
Nothing out of the ordinary happens, but when Draco finally turns around to retrieve his first ingredient, Harry begins the charm work.
The color varieties and possible combinations fascinate him, and he’s never satisfied until he finds one just right for his client.
Harry and Draco both turn to him at the same time and give him a look, sending him into a fit of nervous giggles.
And, just my luck, the second I started walking towards the stairs, he did too. I didn't want to look like a fool, so I kept walking. And so did he. We were walking up the stairs, side-by-side, and it wasn't very wide so we were practically shoulder-to-shoulder.
Harry is sitting in a muggle pub with Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Neville, trying to sort out his feelings.  He just doesn’t get it.
