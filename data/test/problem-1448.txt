and then his handwriting has a little different angle again, he's definitely stopped to think whether or not he should cross the sentence. Posh bloody idiot, of course he did not, of course everything has to be perfect in his letters.
“Then why does everyone else seem to be alright?”
And of course the motherfucking son of a bitch didn’t write which ones he had chosen.
Harry shakes his head when she keeps looking at him with such familiar soft brown eyes, drowned in incredulity and pain. She’s right. They don’t talk enough. There’s simply nothing to talk about anymore.
“I hope she doesn’t, now,” Mr Diler says, shifting towards the shelves. “She’s such a sweet creature...” he sighs with a delicate father-like smile. “And who told you about my tea, then, may I ask? Not a lot of students are familiar with my products. Lots of you just stick to the Dreamless Sleep Potion.”
Mr Diler laughs again, and Harry thinks this laugh is one of the greatest laughs he’s ever heard. Greatest, that’s the right word for it. Loud, and unashamed, and filled with incredibly strong energy.
It’s actually funny how the tendency to find comfort in company of the most unexpected people can’t stop establishing itself in his life.
scarlet lips burning. Grey eyes cool, but alive, like thunder clouds. Beautiful.
The boy sits by the lake, where the strong smell of water and seaweed approaches the forest symphony. Millions of grey licks of waves wink at him from the surface of the Lake, although now
Harry bites his lip and crosses the last sentence so good that no parchment is seen through the smears of black ink.
In the window number two, a man slides his hand through the soft-looking silvery-blond hair that fall back on his forehead in thick wavy locks. His gaze is unfocused, he looks at the empty seat in front of him blindly, and his nostrils copy the calm and heavy rhythm of his chest. Harry can only see the man’s profile, but his pale cheeks wear a soft kiss of blush on their pointed edges, his jawline is to die for, and his white neck disappears under the grey collar of his shirt. His elbow rests on the windowsill, and his long pale fingers are frozen in a pinching motion.
Ron looks up at him and, thankfully, snorts.
Harry holds the letter delicately in his fingers and inspects all the curves of Draco’s handwriting, although his gaze is blind and his mind is drowned in thoughts. He’s suddenly very, very tired. His breathing comes out of his chest quick, ripped. There are droplets of sweat on his temples, he wants nothing but to feel the soothing coolness of his pillows in the silence of his dorm, while all the other kids are in Hogsmeade.
“She uh,” Ron probably twitches uncomfortably. “She—“
Whatever. Good for Harry. More material for the third letter.
He’s getting pissy, Harry can feel this. He so hates to be bossed around.
“I love falafel takeaway. Ze’re’s a very famous falafel place not zat fa’r f’rom us, we should go one day.”
Harry hesitates. He can’t write a wrong name. He can’t leave it like that. Writing something like “Anonymous” feel stupid.
He still looks at Harry, and there might be a little demanding curiosity in the depths of those enormous pebbles, as if just stolen from the deep waters of Scotland. Then the bird kind of growls, and it earns a small chuckle, falling from Harry’s lips.
“I think it’s not a bad idea,” Hermione points out. “To cheer up the the students, maybe?”
A small silence follows after his words, as Hagrid purses his lips thoughtfully under his curly brown beard and refills their tea cups. Harry watches him attentively, fearing that he’s waiting for an explanation.
“What’s wrong with him,” he hears Seamus ask when he pours himself a second glass of milk.
Unfortunately, Harry can’t help but drop his smile. He’s been thinking for days, those long couple of days, thinking of the way to ask Draco about his winter break plans, about the possibility of their meeting in Paris (or wherever in France, really), but every line sounds lame, maybe the whole situation is lame, maybe Draco would want to do absolutely nothing with him in real life, maybe this would break even this little private thing they’re having—
“And then he comes at our dorm, looking like a kicked puppy...”
Harry’s dying to learn what’s there now. A part of him suggests that it may be a dull inexpressive snob that acts good just to be polite for his own good. And another part is screaming devilishly ‘suck it and see, Scarhead’.
“Zaint Sylveste’r? Le San Seelvayst’r,” she repeats in French, shrugging then. “Zat’s what we call the New Yea’r’s Efe.”
They do find the dried pomegranate blossom flowers in that shop, and the owner, Mr Taryck Dilér, makes them drink a pot of chamomile, rose and pomelo tea, because “the boy seems tensed and you Luna are a delight to have around”. He tells them about the process of wandering around turkish cities, trying to find the cheapest and most decent ingredients for his teas, and that it’s not easier than picking all of them from the trees with his own hands. He does it, too, in the season, but not one of his products remains at the shop for a long time, Mr Diler says with pride in his voice and fondness in his wrinkled eyes, so he has to “go shopping” most of the times.
Later, when he comes back to the empty dorms with only Ginny stretched on his bed in blissful sleep, he doesn’t force himself into laying beside her, it makes him feel in peace with himself actually, listening to her quiet breath. Knowing that she’s alright and unconsciously pleased with the act. Yeah, it
When they’re not occupied with sightseeing, Harry goes for long walks. He had no idea he’d love just
“Yeah, thank you very much for your concern, but I don’t think I’ll eat more if you keep doing that. I could, like, have a breakdown or something, or, I don’t know, as a protest I could eat nothing at all.”
“Come back to us, Harry,” she says quietly after a couple of minutes. “At least let’s study together, because I know you’re mirroring me in your bed every evening.”
Hogwarts feels sadder than ever. With the end of their last ever winter break, there is nothing separating them from upcoming N. E. W. T.s, and although Harry doesn’t really give a shit about his possible results, the idea of graduating scares the shit out of him.
“Yeah.”
“Nothing in my shop contains magic,” the man laughs, turning the fire off and pulling out a little copper kettle. “But everything has its special powers. Do you like cinnamon? It’s so much better with cinnamon.”
His friends are late, and it’s probably because the restrooms in such places are always crowded as fuck. The robotic voice announces another departure, and Harry doesn’t pay attention to the words but looks at the vehicle nevertheless, it’s right in front of him.
“He’s fucking plastered,” Dean snorts as Harry walks towards his bag to get a quill and a piece of parchment.
“I know you don’t really talk to anyone these days, but I’m not anyone. I hate to say it like that, but I’m your fucking girlfriend.”
“Noticing him first?”
“We survived a war, for fuck’s sake,” Ron groans one evening and drops his quill. “And now the profs are trying to kill us with homework! The audacity!”
yet again i don’t think i’ll ever be tired of thanking you for leaving kudos and such wonderful comments. it means so much for me, i mean it. i can’t say i’m super active on tumblr but if you’d like to rant about any hp related stuff or...well literally anything — i’m @dracovsbuckbeak on there. feel free to hit me up
“Did you know Slughorn wants to start the whole Slug club fuckery again?” Ron says at breakfast while loading his plate with a rather impressive amount of food.
Harry looks at Draco as if he sees him for the first time. He doesn’t feel like fainting, he doesn’t feel sick. He’s almost sure his heart’s beating alright. He breaths softly, almost tenderly, and he can’t believe that he’s not dreaming, he doesn’t want it to end. Harry realizes he missed just
He doesn’t even have anything to think about, to lull him back to sleep. Anything leads to devastation, and in the end he’s a shadow of his own self, half asleep — half awake, one eye opened to face the meaning of the night for there is a special one for Harry Potter now. At night, there’s no one but him. No one but him and his demons, curled up all over his body, whispering in his ears, breathing into his lips.
But it’s Sunday. He Accios a glass, fills it up with Aguamenti, swallows the water quickly and falls asleep again.
Then his heart misses a beat.
Harry presses his lips together and looks down into his plate.
Ginny’s comfort, Ginny’s peace, Ginny’s blissful safety of passive existence Harry’s trying to reach. Ginny reminds him of his mother. Of Molly, too. How many nights passed next to her, how many breaths stolen from her, how many heartbeats Harry counted while his head lied on her chest. It was good, having Ginny by his side. Good. Nice. Fine.
But even though Harry knows Malfoy took the mark, a part of his heart always refuses to call him a Death Eater. He was forced into this, and Harry should have thought better two years ago, he should’ve known this, he should’ve done something. Tell Dumbledore, tell anyone, stop this fuckery. He was a
He is, actually.
“No. I don’t think I will.”
“I don’t, it’s true,” Harry says, his voice barely a whisper.
“Oh but I do! I have a right to know what’s up, I fucking care about you.”
Harry starts feeling uncomfortable.
of him. Fondness. This word tastes better than a honeycomb. Better than a honeycomb with kaymak and tea.
Harry mimics a grin sardonically, wondering what’s worse: going back to bed and trying to sleep or staying awake till the evening.
Harry leans down and grabs a handful of it, then keeps walking. It melts in a minute, leaving the palm of his hand wet. He keeps walking. He realizes he’s trying to hide, to disappear in this white emptiness. He’s trying to runaway. He’s a coward. He doesn’t want to remember. He has blood
“Mr Diler? Oh, he is. I bet a good one, too, since he believes to feel magic in absolutely non-magical things. He thinks cigarette smoke keeps away the Nargles,” she laughs and traces her hand over a pumpkin. “I so want a pumpkin pie.”
“And?”
“Harry, do you want to break up with me?”
“Of course it does! That’s why saalep’s grows stronger when it’s added. I can’t explain it, but that is that. If it was bullshit, yavrum, no one would believe it for more than ten centuries.”
The letter is still in his clammy palms when the boys’ noises begin rising up in the distance. Harry decides he’s mature and over it all enough to shrug it off and continue living the life he’s been dreaming of living for a long time. It had to be done, the confession. And Merlin only knows how lucky he is to walk through this with a minimum of heartache.
With a heavy breath, Harry reaches out to the small fluttering feathers on the back of the owl’s head and strokes them tenderly with the tips of his fingers. The fever’s still roaring in his ears, he can’t breath through his stuffy nose so he inhales the chilly air in an uneven, broken, wet rhythm. He sounds like he’s drowning, although... he might as well. Drowning under the press of the words written on solid white paper, the words that burn him, the same that are echoed through the rush of his blood after each heartbeat.
he sighs.
“What was what?”
They walk in silence after that, shrill light of autumn sun waving goodbye from the back; their shadows long and dark in front of them. When Harry looks at Luna, she’s smiling with a quiet, delicate smile and her eyes are facing the road, darker when no light hits them. Her hair looks white, almost surreal, and Harry winces and looks away.
Despite the insults, Harry smiles to himself and tries to imagine what Draco looks like now. If his hair is longer, if his body is healthier, if his eyes are no more glass-made. If the soft kisses of rose petals are back and blooming on his cheeks. He wouldn’t dare to ask.
The way out is too long and too short at the same time. Harry’s palms are clammy, he constantly stumbles on his robes, the way his stomach clenches is a nice throw-up promise. The only thing keeping him from running towards Hagrid as fast as he can is the bird who’s trembling feathers tickle his jaw.
Worried. She’s always worried about him, and he lets her, that’s the essential in their relationship. She may be one of the fiercest Quidditch players, of the fearless and smartest witches he knows, but she also carries the biggest heart in her chest, the heart that aches and cares for her beloved ones. She’s so much like her mother, and Harry admires this a lot in her. Therefore, a soft smile touches his lips when he reaches out to connect their hands.
Of course, Harry knew Draco is not stupid. But letter after every letter, he finds himself fucking fascinated with his intelligence, with his mind, although one might not find them extraordinary. Hearing Draco pronounce every word he wrote down is so easy, too, because even though they’ve never had (and probably never going to have) a proper conversation, Harry is familiar with the way he speaks. And Draco writes just like that, it’s not something everyone do, and certainly not something particularly admirable; and yet.
But for Harry, the world suddenly goes blank and mute. The echo of Ron’s voice is long forgotten and instead there’s this huge something that sounds familiar, too familiar, as if he’d been thinking about this for ages deep in his head, somewhere at the very borders of his sanity, waiting either too patiently or extremely impatiently for someone else to ring this particular bell, but at the same time there is an excitement too grand and loud to be considered before. In his chest, Harry’s poor chest, every single bone starts waltzing around in a diabolical rhythm, and his heart feels as if it has just grown up to the size of a Black Hole. Of course in real life he’s just a pathetic moron who keeps gaping stupidly at the space between Ron’s and Hermione’s heads, but on the inside he’s burning like a nuclear reactor. It’s unfair that the thought of meeting one single person who probably wants to do nothing with you makes a man like that.
, kind of. No one seems to stick to any roles, people are more careless; or maybe it’s just Harry. Paris is also dirty, dirtier than London, although London’s not exactly clean either.
“What assumption?” he draws out weakly.
Harry knows he’s under Veritaserum, so he couldn’t lie to himself as well, no matter how much he tries. Harry also knows it’s not going to be Ginny’s name on the letter.
As the train gains its speed, Harry’s heart does too. He watches Draco watching him, and his chest blooms in the most beautiful, most desperate, most tender way. And when the train’s long gone and Harry hears Hermione’s voice through the rush of blood in his ears, he’s fine. He’s finer than he’s been in months.
Harry has never been on such level of intimacy with anyone, ever. It’s like he voluntarily cuts his chest open, pushes his own fingers through his flesh and his ribs apart. It’s more than being naked, it’s more than letting in.
Harry immediately lets the bird with a light blue envelope in, as well as the cool autumn chill that sends shivers down his spine, caressing his bare neck and playing with his hair. Fresh smell of thunder is heavy, filling up his chest, and in the mirror of his glasses no star winks at the castle; all gone behind dirty greenish-grey limestone clouds. The wind fills up every single path in the forest, shaking even the oldest and strongest giant pine trees, and the hills far far away suddenly pop up in blinding silver under a hit of lighting. Harry wants to lick them.
“Huh?”
“Didn’t get the letter?”
. The last two paragraphs, too. If he used to doubt his place in Draco’s life, everything is crystal clear now.
complaining, but Harry, he’s not that majestic and smart and wonderful to tolerate him every single moment of my life!”

He remembers seing Draco on ice. It probably was a catalyst for his poor little heart back in the Third Year, when for every student it was the beginning of something new. First two years were all about Harry caring unexplainably much for Malfoy and getting way too angry about this because he
“Well, a lot of others do, but not me. I don’t think it’s because of my habitats, canım, but because I’m lazier than a troll,” he explains casually, and Harry laughs at that, not taking his eyes off of the tea, quickly filling up his teaglass. “Thank you.”
Harry feels himself nodding once, heart clenched stupidly tight.
so i decided that i hate the update i posted yesterday so i’m sorry for having you guys confused. hope you’ll like the new chapter and if there’s anyone who managed to catch yesterday’s update — well i hope you’ll like this one better
“Are you okay?” he mumbles quietly as she puts her head on his shoulder.
“It’s the letters, right?”
Harry sighs.
“Honey, sugar, love of my life, you know she’s joking, right?” he mutters weakly, though Dean seems to have absolutely no problem with that.
They meet Seamus, Dean, Hermione and Ron at Three Broomsticks and after two bottles of butterbeer Harry excuses himself and goes to the tea shop.
And even more hours later, when Neville’s struggling with the Potions homework and Ron curses under his breath after probably the twentieth try of performing the new Charms spell, when Dean and Seamus are long asleep cuddled up on the latter’s bed, there’s a soft knock on the window.
Harry chokes on his own breath then and trips over his own feet, having to pull his hands from the pockets of his jacket to steady himself. Luna laughs sympathetically, but keeps walking. She’s still smiling when Harry stares at her in disbelief, with that surreal absence of hers.
“She said you did,” Ron nods awkwardly.
Harry doesn’t know if he should write him. Four days passed under gloomy Parisian sky, and although Harry doesn’t feel anything dark, and rotten, and
Talking to Fleur is easy, Harry discovers. She has a great sense of humour, she loves sharing stories and asks good, laconic questions so Harry doesn’t feel like he’s the awkwardly silent one (although he a little bit is). He lets her talk and laughs and wonders, and a little later Fleur says that they’re not going to the nearest grocery but to the other one, just so they could walk a little more.
“No offense but you would bang anybody,” Seamus snorts, and the whole table follows. Ron’s mug is darker than the bowl of beet salad in front of him, which makes Hermione and Ginny laugh even harder.
Suddenly Harry feels sick. Grey-eyed, full-lipped blond, unhealthily pale, unfamiliarly calm, sitting at the table, his cup of tea no longer steaming, ears so longer hearing anyone; anything. Another boy right in front of him, even dark wild hair can’t hide the stare of green eyes and furrowed eyebrows; shoulders tensed, hands clenched, omelette long forgotten as well.
The boy pauses and bites his lip. Yeah. Right. He can’t lie. He’d like to write a proper love letter. To celebrate the first person who broke his heart. He decides to not cross the sentence to avoid spreading more dirt.
Harry chuckles and it’s the best scenario in which no one notices how particularly excited his eyes go.
Ron’s gaze slips down in an awkward motion, and the sight of him is nothing but amusing, he’s like a deer caught in headlights.
or just read. Whether he believes Draco or not.
“Fuck!” he jumps a little only when the owl bites his finger suddenly. In our realm, its huge eyes look into him expectantly and a little skeptically, and Harry can do nothing but roll his eyes a little.
Harry’s staring at the Slytherin table at random, not giving two fucks about Ron going on and on about that Quiddich scholarship Ginny considers to accept, when something falls right into his porridge.
“Mate, what’s wrong? You’ve been distant for too long now, is everything alright?”
“I don’t know what’s going on with me, Gin. I’ll understand if you tell me you’re sick of me, but—“
There’s no need to take Veritaserum for Harry to admit he had been waiting for it, and now he’s messed up and bad, and sad, and mad, too. Mad at himself, sad because it’s like he’s Dudley who’s just gotten 57 best Christmas presents ever and now doesn’t have anything else to want and to hope for; bad because he constantly has to force himself into doing something. Under everlasting pressure, one’s mind gets tired, and the pressure only lightens up under one’s mind.
It’s true, he doesn’t hear from Draco, and after a rather tensed yet warm dinner at the Burrow Harry excuses himself and Apparites to The Grimmauld Place. Two days later, he packs his suitcase and catches a cab to the train station to meet Bill, Fleur, Ron and Hermione.
He suddenly feels sick to the guts. He often does, these days. He’s so fucking tired. Inside, there’s that lingering feeling of a trap. He’s like a tensed string, frantically waiting for a catch, ready to snap at every second, with every fiber of his being. It makes him weaker. More paranoid. It’s exhausting. He wants to have a rest.
Harry grimaces, not really able to control his expressions. Of all the thoughts he had last night, none of them was about Ginny, and that’s what he honestly informs Ron about.
“Maybe he misses you too.”
Meanwhile, everyone in the room begins to shout and thoughtfully share their own bright idea of how to humiliate Harry this time.
He should be relieved — he is. He should be embarrassed— he is. He should be grateful, he should be stricken, be shocked, awed, fucked up, utterly fucking terrified — he is all of the above. His reaction on Draco Malfoy is a bad one, and it’s just...it’s exhausting. Felling all this. Carrying it all in one heart, in one head. But he doesn't hate himself for experiencing this kind of emotions anymore. It feels like he manages to hate himself less in general.
“I think I sleep better. I don’t know.”
Harry shakes his head, rolls his eyes and grins, biting his lower lip. He stops reading for a couple of seconds, because the realization only hits him now. They’re really talking. They’re exploring each other with every letter, little by little, after all that they’ve been through, after all this time. It doesn’t feel absurdly, nor it feels like drinking a cold cup of tea.
For some reasons Harry can’t explain, he feels sheepish sending the letter with a little almost jet-black owl the day after. Hagrid said that big Barn Owls get tired too quickly, and if the package is not large it’d be better to use the small but quick Little Owls instead.
Harry’s front teeth are digging into his lower lip so deeply in attempt to control the widest grin it’s almost bleeding.
“Alright Harry,” the stare of Luna’s light blue eyes traced with millions of silver freckles falls onto Harry absently. “Truth or dare?”
A faint sound of flowing fabric, a wave of citrusy shampoo and sweet late spring flowers blossom perfume, a radiating ginger silhouette — and Ginny’s right next to him, brown eyes still concerned, just like they were the last time Harry met them with his own.
He blinks it all away and turns the shower on.
Harry shrugs. His shoes look exceptionally interesting in the dim light of Hagrid’s living room.
She chuckles miserably.
the git, and then...then the summer passed, and Malfoy stopped using so much hail product and his platinum-blond hair started glowing both softer and brighter in the sun; his baby cheeks were replaced with tentatively carved cheekbones, thus slightly chapped thin lips turned plumper and more elegantly arched; even his fucking voice got upgraded, from childishly squeaky to deep and cool, like satin, sending cool shivers down Harry’s constantly sexually frustrated body. And when Harry saw this tall and lean arrogant problem skating like a god, with screaming pink cheeks, and iridescent fucking smile, laughing like Harry had never seen before, like he could never even imagine someone like Malfoy could...
The letter gets read again. Slower this time, not as if to savour what was remaining there after the first reading, because Harry saw everything; but to hear his own decision. Draco is right, he can’t change some things, and just like that, he can’t change the paths his own self decides to follow, for Harry’s head and his mind are seldom cooperative with each other. Whether it will accept Draco’s words or forget them as soon as Harry’s head hits his pillow; whether they have been
“There you are.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Her milk-white cheeks are blossoming with January cold and her hair looks like pale gold in the room’s lights. She looks like a breathing painting as she moves towards the table, and Mr Diler stands up to greet her with two light kisses on both of her cheeks. Hot steaming tea runs quickly into Turkish pear-shaped glasses, and the three of them are all smiles and laughs, while behind the closed door transparent pink winter sky lets the sun kiss it goodbye.
Harry realizes there’s a tear sliding down his cheek slowly only when the wind blows right into his face and bites the wet path it leaves. The bird howls benignly and fidgets again.
“Fucking degenerate,” Seamus concludes deadpan, and everyone hears Hermione chuckling at this.
Harry. Harry James Potter. James. Jamie. Jem.
«You tell me this all the time,” Harry murmurs, wondering if it’s a hidden parallel or a metaphor and whether he’ll have to live through one more pointless conversation right now or not.
“It’s a barred owl,” Hermione says, looking at Harry with her brown eyes. “Not that commonly met among mail owls.”
Harry looks at him surprisedly for a moment, but then it all clicks and suddenly there’s the hot wave of gratitude rising up in his chest. Hagrid, lovely Hagrid and his gigantic hands and even bigger heart, his iridescent smile, lost under thick curls of his beard, mesmerizing eyes of the kindest, warmest brown.
Wednesday reminds him of Sunday, although the picture in Harry’s head was only a presumption. V-formations of birds tremble in the distance, and the sky is completely grey, like a worn-out, one thousand times washed white sheet.
Harry feels his lungs burning, and it’s only then that he knows he’s shaking, his cheeks wet, his nose stuffed and teeth firmly squeezed.
He knows for sure he does not want to and will certainly not force himself to join the Auror training program. But at the same time, he still has no idea what else he could do, and he still hasn’t told Ron and everyone else about it; and yet again, Harry Potter is a wrecked mess when he returns to Hogwarts.
“Yeah, because you had the audacity to not joining us yesterday at Ravenclaw dorms.”
Later in the evening, he walks into the Great Hall and his body does really feel lighter. He shoots a grin at Luna, who waves at him with a blinding smile, and for the first time in months he sits down to eat, not to torture himself. Treacle tart looks especially sexy today under golden lights, and in the morning, Harry beams at the sight of banana waffles, sleek with maple syrup.
And then, it all vanishes away with a whirl of strong, beautiful wings of soft milky-white and warm, hazelnut-brown feathers, alternating each other in a gorgeous, truly unique pattern.
“Sorry...what was that?”
who reminds him of the moment, of
“I hope the message she just delivered will be as lovely.”
“Maybe you should call him Sylvester,” Ron offers, grinning like a child. “What, it fits!”
Fleur laughs and her grip tightens for a brief moment.
The conversation flows easily between the five of them, and Harry is honest to god happy. He watches fields and mountains, deep blue waters and cold abandoned shores, listens to the familiar clatter of the rails under their train. They buy hot chocolate a sweet French lady offers them and profiteroles, and Harry tells everyone about Mr Diler. They listen enthusiastically about Turkish sweets, and Fleur says that she loves Turkish cuisine even more than French. She talks to Hermione in French, as Hermione knows a couple of most necessary phrases, and then Bill suddenly impresses them all with his knowledge of the language.
Despite the triumph written on the faces of hundreds of people and in thousands of articles and books, it feels like a loss.
oh so yall wanted them to meet eh? (:
It’s not like he’s embarrassed of their newly formed friendship with his ex-arch nemesis; no. Harry has never been the one to particularly struggle with people’s opinions on his actions. Yet the bond is still so fragile, so odd and precious to him that he just knows he should keep this one to himself; only to himself. The side of overprotectiveness, determination and jealousy. Like a priceless charm you wear on a thin silver chain, tucked securely under all of your clothes.
“And for me too,” Neville joins, and Harry just nods, already throwing the Invisibility Cloak on.
“Of course I’m not,” she says, trying to reach out to the teapot. It’s closer to Harry, and he picks it up and pours the tea into Luna’s cup. “Thank you, Harry. But there is that Turkish wizard I know, he owns a little tea shop there. Maybe we should visit him.”
“I don’t know,” Harry answers honestly. “Maybe just some kind of an autumn depression.”
“It’s a F’rench saying. We don’t usually mean it, we only want to say how go’rgeous a pe’rson iz.”
He wonders what Draco Malfoy feels at the moment, what he’s thinking about, what’s going on in his restless head.
It’s still cold, the merciless grey sky holds clouds made of steel and copper, and when Harry enters his dorm to grab a sweater, there are two owls apparently bickering on the windowsill.
“Well Hermione isn’t short either,” Harry notices, shooting at her his most charming (shit-eating) smile. She stares at him, face blank, but cheeks heating up a little.
“Right. Breakfast first.”
Harry chuckles at the little change in Draco’s handwriting that looks an awful lot like he stopped writing for a couple of seconds, in doubt, and then continued.
Something childishly impatient buzzes on his fingertips and the tips of his ears at breakfast. It feels like he’s planning a mischief, and oh it is good. Hermione gives him a weird look over the book at their Charms lesson and he grins in return.
He looked healthier. His cheeks were fuller, his skin was still pale, yet no more pallid, resembling wax — but a soft, expensive ivory. His movements never lost their grace, but the swift strangled motions of the last two years were replaced with his former elegance. The look in his beautiful grey eyes was a mixture of something Harry was used to from their very first meeting — it was sophisticated and poised, but the heated boyish snootiness of his childhood and then the doomed broken devastation of times the War gave in to be replaced with one of a kind determined, self-sufficient, a little bit defiant serenity. The pout of scarlet lips was still stubborn but not malicious, the arch of much darker than his hair, kind of golden eyebrows was insolent but not contemptuous. He didn’t lose any part of himself but took every single one to another, more mature, more sublime level. He was beautiful. He could inspire. He was worth looking at.
Harry writes down and his gaze locks up on six little vials, filled with coloured dust. Of course they costed him a fortune, but oddly enough, he didn’t feel even a little bit reluctant, letting go of his money. His body wasn’t, but his little heart was shivering in anticipation. He wasn’t so sure Draco would like his present, it’s a fifty/fifty game — he might as well sneer and the paints and conclude that it’s the most pathetic gift anyone has ever gotten him; but there’s something extremely exciting in the thought of Draco getting his present, it’s a childish, purest idea of being happy to give someone else something they might like, especially when it’s someone who...someone like Draco.
As if he’s ever been good with telling his heart what to do.
When Harry releases the breath he was damn well aware he was holding — chest and cheeks puffed, face darker than a pomegranate, eyes already bit red-rimmed and ridiculously wet — he looks at the bird. It, or he, apparently, looks back with huge, absolutely black shiny eyes, circled with millions of tiny white feathers, as if there are two cone-like funnels ending with two jet-black beads. He whoos at Harry somehow...tenderly and
on his arms that will never wash out, and the only option is cutting them away.
“Dare,” Harry says after a long second and licks his lips. His t-shirt sticks to his back and glasses are constantly sliding down his nose. He hopes Luna makes him go outside and feed some mysterious invisible friends of hers.
“Aafiyet olsun, of course,” he says and takes a seat as well. He has the smallest, probably turkish, teaspoons Harry’s ever seen, and in his long thick fingers they look especially, almost ridiculously tiny.
And it takes about an hour under the steaming hot water to scrub this the fuck away, at least a little bit, at least until there’s none of her sweat left on his body, until the proofs of his crime are gone with soaped water. It would be a lie to say that it was as bad as their first times, but it’s still there. Harry hopes patiently for the best.
It’s only hours later when Harry realizes he accidentally told Fleur that he thinks that Draco Malfoy is...beautiful.
Harry has no idea how on the Earth he managed to make Draco Malfoy this person. But the moment this thought crosses his mind, something else, something stronger and harder wakes up. Something warm, protective over the grey eyes and rich voice and lonely, lonely heart.
“Hagrid,” he says, voice breaking, “I’ve been thinking exactly the same. I don’t want this. I hate the idea of it and...”
Thoughts are circulating in Harry’s head like birds in the Owlery as he watches the evening slowly slide into nighttime. Harry’s breaths come out in slightly golden steam, it mirrors the distant horizon where the owl with his letter has just disappeared. For some reasons, the evening sky, with so many clouds and colours, so many emotions looks lighter than the heavy crystal clear blue bliss of the afternoon. Some beauty is boring and worth looking at once a day. Some deserves every bit of attention from the beginning to the very death of it.
The trunks are pushed back to free some space, but it’s still incredibly crowded in the room. The air is not that stale due to the high ceilings, but it’s so hot that little droplets of sweat roll down the necks and temples. Neville refuses to let them open the window, because Mrs Augusta Longbottom says, September wind is the most dangerous of all: you won’t even register the moment fever hops onto you. Behind the window the dark sky is nothing but a steady velvet drape, and millions of diamond pecks are placed so haphazardly, so chaotically on it, you wouldn’t be surprised if it’d turn out a child once grabbed handful of these sparkling pieces and threw them down, bursting into bright laughter. But each and every has its own place and is so big you wouldn’t believe it, so solid and fierce, so cold and beautiful, so blatantly important, and so heartbreakingly empty. No cloud hides them now, no light disturbs the sacred meaning of the night.
“I don’t want to play Truth or Dare.”
The white light of the morning is dull, and it feels odd after the clearance of the night. It’s probably an aluminum-grey day, with watercolour smears of clouds above endless forests, but there’s a lot to admire in this particular kind of a day too. Especially in September, when all the leaves make a serious competition to Shishkin’s palette, thousands, millions of shades of brown, yellow, green and red. Under the sky of perfect baby blue they’re soft and almost creamy, under the bright blue of a sunny day they’re almost blinding in their retrospective; and this metal grey sky makes its own gloomy, stoic, yet melodramatically poetic charm when you look at the never-ending pano from the Gryffindor tower. It’s a much common view in October than mid-September, but some days are an exception.
A sigh of relief escapes Harry’s lips when there’s a small brown and white owl waiting for him patiently on the windowsill of the dorm. It’s been almost two weeks since he’d sent the letter and an uncomfortable, nagging feeling has been tugging at his chest for a week. He quickly pulls out a small treat for her, some pork he happens to steal time after time just in case, and plomps on his bed, opening the envelope eagerly.
Harry catches himself cringing and immediately feels bad about it. He has so many advantages, he should feel so grateful, he should be all but stunned with the thought of spending his life as an Auror. But at the same time there’s this growing and nagging reminder that all that is just because he did what he had to do, he fought who he had to fight, he is the Golden Boy. And now he’s expected to lead a happy life of a magic policeman just because fifteen year old him thought it’d be cool.
Until the sixth year when he was so indifferent to everything that he quit even Quidditch. Yeah, the most wonderful year of all. The year Harry had to learn that a heart can not only be broken by someone; it can break
That’s the tragic charm of the first love. How many more we’ll have — we won’t ever know, but that first person will always be there, like a blessing, like a curse, like a promise. It’s a delicate and incredibly fragile spot underneath one’s soul and above one’s head, a spot which is painfully pleasant to the touch, unique and everlasting; immortal.
And yet, staring at the bird until it’s nothing but a little black dot in the white lifeless sky, Harry feels a wave of joy making its way over his skin, too.
“And you, Harry, you only ate a piece of toast!”
His headache grows harder to ignore. If it wasn’t for the first part of the letter, Harry knows he would’ve been smiling like a motherfucking fool at the thought of Draco liking his present. He would’ve also been analyzing his words about the way Draco feels towards empathy and admiring the adamant art of self-preservation he’s mastered brilliantly. But he’s not, not right now, at least. It’s much more complicated than this.
Harry’s heart aches in a bittersweet manner, but it’s nothing he was expecting to experience after opening the envelope. He wonders if he should connect their walk to Hogsmeade with Luna and Draco’s advice and what exactly he does dream of. He wonders whether it’s really the last time they communicate with each other. He wonders if he’ll see the boy again.
“Of course I didn’t, not yet.”
Harry thinks he’d spend any amount of money if he would feel it had a potential to please Draco Malfoy. Just because the fucking git made him cry with his present. Harry deserves to at least make him smile.
“But I’m hungry!” he objects, and Harry accidentally catches Hermione’s eyes when she shakes her head irritatedly, which was definitely not a good idea.
“Yeah,” she nods with a soft, inoffensive chuckle. “It’s just, zey sha’re watercolour painting classes, and zat waz when she sta’rted noticing him fi’rst...”
So he gets up, takes a look through the window, and his reflection doesn’t look impressed with the width of the sapphire sky and burning leaves. These are the last days of this fire, though. Even yesterday the leafage looked more pompous than today.
“I’m fine. Nothing happened. I’m just tired, that’s all.”
Harry’s not scared; he’s fucking terrified. Terrified, but his hands are not shaking when he opens the letter. For a second, he completely forgets how to breathe.
“Did you get an answer?”
Harry used to think he noticed everything, until he realized he did not at all.
“Of course we do! Why, does Miss Luna have troubles sleeping again?”
Harry lets go of breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“Harry, you’ve been like that since the summer. But now it’s just...growing.”
He should focus on himself. He should make this day decent. He should keep fighting his apathy, caused by the constant tension inside. Quite a paradox.
“The Dreamless Sleep Potion is addictive, I’ve heard. And um, Draco Malfoy told me about your tea.”
“You’ve been distant lately.”
Because he turns to face her again.
“Go steal another bottle of Firewhiskey from Filch’s study!”
who brings him back to reality. Of course it’s
It’s just a shitty day, it’s just a shitty morning. It’s probably just a shitty life but at least the mood swings don’t hit him in the face any more. He’s used to all the guilt, he’s used to feeling like a loser. A failure. In his own eyes, what’s more important. He’s used to knowing there’s nothing else he will ever be, because he’s Harry Potter. He’s eighteen years old and he’s been, he’s had, he’s tasted everything and anything he could not, let alone things he could. There would be no difference for him between dying tomorrow or forty years later. He held the world in his hands and they feel too unfamiliar now to hold his heart properly.
And Fleur, who hasn’t taken her eyes off of him, presses her lips together, hiding her smile and letting him to choose — to either gracefully move onto another conversation or not — and turns her head towards the road, and Harry just keeps breathing hard and staring at her, eyes nothing but fucking petrified as they keep walking. He opens his mouth and closes it a couple of times, resisting the urge to stab himself for wanting to say something (because this won’t end up good, what could he possibly say, good god), yet desperately needing to ask her, what the fuck is going on. Because something definitely is. You don’t smirk at people like that and expect them to be fine, he’s known Fred and George Weasley for years.
Harry can’t help rolling his eyes, but his cheeks redden on the instant.
At the doors he gets a peck on the lips from Ginny who’s leaving already to finish her homework before classes and sits down between Luna and Hermione. It’s too bright in the Hall for his liking, but not like he can do anything about that.
Hermione chuckles and Harry needn’t look at Ron to know he goes all red.
So many deaths — so many crystal glass eyes, so many silver droplets of sweat on marble-carved cold foreheads, so many blood-covered mouths. These bodies could make constellations up in the sky, whole galaxies. But there would be no Harry between them, because Harry died, too, but came back. Just because he’s Harry Potter. Just because he’s the Chosen One. Not because it’s fair.
“How do those Ministry birds even work? They never deliver with the other owls,” Ron waltzes into the room, yawning and stretching lazily. Harry’s never told Ron the owls were not, in fact, always from the Ministry, simply because then it would be too obvious who they are from. Plus, when at the end of August Harry blurted out that he wouldn’t really want to spend his life fighting, no matter what it’s called at the Ministry, Ron went nuts and began waxing poetic on the perks of being an Auror. He thinks he’s succeeded every time Harry opens a light-blue envelope. Harry knows better.
Hermione purses her lips, closes her eyes, defeatedly and buries her face in the palm of her hand.
The smile grows sillier and wider when he sees her overcoming her own thoughts and finally giving in. She sighs and shakes her head a little, warm fingers cup either side of Harry’s face, and then her lips cover his. The bows inside Harry’s stomach don’t relax, his shoulders are still tensed, no white noise in his head; it’s clear, and right now he feels Ginny Weasley with every fiber of his being.
“Is that an invitation for the three of us?” he asks lamely, and the moment he catches Hermione’s gaze, he knows it’s over for him.
“Oh sweet Merlin,” Hermione chuckles next to him as Harry watches a big grey own landing exhaustedly on the table. Her eyeleads are heavy, and Harry reaches out to stroke her feathers with one hand, quickly pulling the letter out of the porridge and grabbing the goblet with water to offer to the bird with the other.
“A break?”
“You can do it somewhere else,” she says slowly, breaking the eye contact and opening her sixth or seventh bottle of Butterbeer.
do not hesitate to tell me your honest opinion on my plot, sometimes i’m really not sure if i should keep going in directions i choose lol i need opinions
“Let’z get oüt of he’e,” Fleur commands, and they all turn towards the exit.
There are a few moments of silence after his words and then Hermione chuckles sadly.
“So the person I fell for doesn’t exist anymore?”
Not like Harry gives a shit.
Harry opens his mouth to explain, to try to explain, but he doesn’t find the words to do so. It just seems like there’s nothing to say, even Ron should realize it’s for the best, their breakup. At least he doesn’t seem mad. He’s the only person who could be.
“Yeah, sure,” Ron says, still unconscious of everyone and everything happening around him. “I think it would be cool. They want to travel by train, by the way, like Muggles, from London. I love trains...”
Needles to say, in the last couple days his almost unexplainable enmity against the young girl has only grown harder. He decides to not inform Draco about her crush on him, because first of all, he’s not a gossip and it would be terribly, terribly unfair to both her and Fleur as well. And secondly, the girl is almost as pretty as her older sister is. What’s worse than accidentally starting something that will one day eat you alive.
There are questions lingering in Harry’s head, but he doesn’t know how to ask. What to ask. A couple of minutes pass, and he decides to let go. After all, Luna is the rightest person to share a comfortable silence with. And if there’s a little sorrow in both their faces, it’s right, too. A peaceful and long accepted sorrow that Harry’s gotten used to now.
Jesus Christ. He’s too dumb to play these deep ass games.
She presses her lips together tight, the tips of her ears and her cheeks reddening because of the failed attempt.
“Dunno,” Harry can see him shrugging awkwardly. “Thought you were hungry. Gin’s worried.”
“Here,” he says, putting the plate in front of the bird. “Enjoy yourself.”
She looks up at him, surprisedly.
“He’s p’retty. Zat’s it. She said he was p’etty once and then got a little bit obzessed. And started to notice zat he gets letters f’om ‘ogwarts. A lot of them. And he paints also. Fin de l’histoire.”
Harry looks at the windows. In the first one, there is a company of women arguing. The second one is empty. In the third window, there is a boy of four or five looking back at Harry, with his little palms and his small nose pressed against the glass. Harry chuckles, then smiles at the boy. There is a silhouette in the second window, someone just walked in. The boy looks at Harry judgingly first, then smiles back, showing his one front tooth proudly. Harry chuckles softly again, then he waves. He doesn’t know if it’s a hello or a goodbye. In return, he gets a grimace with a little pink tongue out. Harry gasps silently, lips breaking apart, and theatrically hits his chest with the palm of his hand. The boy laughs and when Harry imagines the sound of his laugher, he can’t help but grin again. With the corner of his eye, he sees a man sitting next to the window number two. Boring. But the kid disappears soon, and Harry looks at the window number four.
“Yeah, I agree. Sounds awful.”
“Why?”
Playing it all off is a good idea; he fails miserably at it.
He says Luna’s name a little differently, placing the accent to the ‘a’ and making it linger, so it’s ‘Lunaa’ and not ‘Loona’. Harry decides it sounds rather nice.
No one knows it, but Hagrid’s secretly one of the wisest people Harry’s ever met. He doesn’t really know what to say, to thank him or to break down and start rambling, but the man speaks first, by now with a full-up grin.
It’s not such a morning, the snow has been covering miles and miles of hills and forests around Hogwarts, but Harry’s too used to this feeling to feel anything else, staring at the snow after waking up. With Hedwig comes Fred, with Fred comes Snape, Sirius follows right after, and it all starts again. This cool apathy, this feeling of guilt, of shame, of irrationalism. And to escape it all, to block the melancholy, maybe he shouldn’t stay on his own, maybe he should come down the stairs to the Common Room, to Breakfast, anywhere. But it’s a lonely Sunday, and although he knows he’s wrong, especially although he
“What about her?”
Smooth, Harry.
Harry laughs then, really laughs, chest shaking and crinkles by the eyes deepening; the dimples in his cheeks just as deep. He feels Hermione bursting into laughter too, the sound of it warming Harry up from the inside, her wild hair brushing his cheek and jaw.
The thought of getting an answer strikes Harry when he’s shoving the second piece of treacle tart into his mouth. The boy just frowns a little, still chewing, and then relaxes, because come on. The letter was atrocious. Draco will probably read it with an honest to god pitiful expression on his face, wondering what kind of “a fucking imbecile” would call it a love letter, and throw it away.
“Well I asked you first.”
Harry feels something long forgotten rising up in his chest again. Something he wants to wear like a trophy, something he wants to have his name on it, something that reminds him the feeling when the Order kids kept managing their Patronuses one by one or when Ron and Hermione were given the role of Prefects; but still not really. For the first time maybe in his life, someone says something normal about Draco, without hate or disapproval. Something not nice and not bad either. And it feels amazing, to be able to smile for him, to smile and not weird out, to feel this...this
Harry chuckles then, following the wizard’s smile. His big nose is bigger when he does and the wrinkles by his dark eyes, framed with even darker eyebrows, grow deeper.
“At least he ate,” Ron snorts, and Harry rolls his eyes.
Remembering Lucius’ or Narcissa’s long thick hair, Draco shouldn’t too. In fact, remembering Lucius and Narcissa all together promises that Time will do him good, extremely good, in fact, because both of his parents are gorgeous, are now just as they were ten years ago, when Harry met them for the first time. Lucius’ pale skin, his grey eyes, angular face with pointy chin and frozen cheekbones, cutting into jawline. His long strong body, legs for days, wide shoulders; Narcissa’s gorgeously serene posture, her narrow waist, her elegant hands and her cool voice. Millions of wrinkles in the corners of her eyes that have the same heavy lids that Draco has, deep lines across the high forehead suggest that nothing will ruin the marble-carved beauty of this face.
Prick.
After classes, when the air is cool and humid, and slowly begins to fall into softer shades of lilac, Harry, Ginny, Luna and Neville are making their way into the forest. Luna wants to find the bushes of blackcurrant, the tea of its leaves is her favourite. Harry falls behind her and Neville, taking his time and breathing deeply, head free of thoughts, and Ginny sticks to his slow wandering steps. Looking at the leaves from the ground is different. The darkening veins of trees form giant nests for trillions of creatures, their cries and whispers mixing with the symphony of wind and their steps.
“Hello hello hello, ol’ pal,” Ron breathes out in an awe when a big brown owl solemnly swoops down beside them. Harry’s not sure if it’s Bill’s owl or Charlie’s, but either is good. The bird moves towards his plate and looks contemptuously at the crumbs. Harry huffs out a small smile and puts there a new piece of toast with bacon and begins to slice it.
And of course Harry’s cheeks are immediately pomegranate-stained, burning with a deep, rich crimson above the frantically beating heart.
“It’s because he seems to want to spend all his fucking time with me, and not like I’m complaining—“
She shrugs under his gaze, her own is long lost in the distance.
“I’m tired. Ronald’s tiring.”
Her words feel safe enough.
She bites her lip and begins thinking, elegant brows furrowed a little. The best thing about her is, she never asks funny questions. Maybe that's what they call the French finesse, it probably has something to do with the mentality. In the end, gracefully avoiding uncomfortable moments in a dialogue is an art, something people either do or do not learn from the very childhood. Or maybe he’s overthinking and it’s just Fleur.
“Unfortunately, it is,” he nods. It’s still a problem, maybe not as big as Draco Malfoy (what up, it’s Harry, he’s eighteen and he’s never fucking learned how to set his priorities right), and yet it’s something he’s unsuccessfully trying to not to think about at the rare moments of comfort, for it’s a matter of his future life. And unfortunately now he likes the perspective of getting pissed at Grimmauld Place every day and overdosing on treacle tart (or meth) much more than fighting dark wizards for the rest of his life.
Harry just stares into the distance, not even bothered to pretend he’s interested. He’s too tired for this. He has no idea why he woke up at this ungodly hour on Sunday, too. Maybe because he just can’t let go of that one miserably small part of him that wants a reply. Not because it matters, but because it’s unfair, to open up in front of someone like that, even anonymously, and then be ignored. For people, their feelings are the most essential and sensitive things, and no one would like to experience that kind of disrespect towards them
It’s almost like he’s intendedly provoking Harry, and he can’t help but picture his arrogantly lifted up chin and lips curved up in a smirk, grey eyes laughing, stormily and daringly. It feels surreally familiar, although it’s been too long since he’s seen it; since anyone, actually, has seen it. But anyone wouldn’t bother much to notice the change in this boy, following the beginning of their sixth year at Hogwarts.
“Does cinnamon have special powers too?”
Harry almost winces when Neville turns off the lights with a flick of his wand. He turns to face the wall and closes his eyes, praying to fall asleep quickly.
This day won’t be an exception in any other way. He’ll come down to the Great Hall, have a breakfast, kiss Ginny on her adorably chapped pink lips, lie in her lap in the Common Room, write his Potions essay, play chess with Ron or a game of poker with Seamus. Or maybe a couple of games.
tugging at his chest and nagging deafeningly, he still catches himself —at the breakfast table, in the afternoon’s crowded streets, on his lonely evening walks — catches himself looking at the sky, or rather examining it expectantly, and then pressing his lips together tight, as if it would be enough to not feel the stupid, utterly idiotic disappointment settling down somewhere deep inside his chest.
Harry purses his lips and looks at her, trying to understand who’s wrong here. They’ve been apart for a year. A year of pain, a year of wandering, a year of utter hell. She’s not delusional, he might’ve not come back.
“Very funny, boys,” Hermione rolls her eyes and crosses her hands on her chest.
And again, Harry stares at him in shock.
“Uh,” Harry breaths out and lets the man enthusiastically tell him about the traditional turkish winter drink, made from orchids and milk. He learns that not only it does warm up one’s body and spirit, it also heals cough, bronchitis and diarrhea due to the medical powers of orchids.
Harry bites down a soft smile.
A soft whirl of strong wings greets Harry from the opened window, and looking up, he meets a pair of always-curious black iris-less. There’s also a small white mouse in the owl’s beak, and it looks positively dead.
“Mate? Mate, you okay?”
She takes a step in.
“Are you sure about us,” Ginny throws at his back in that typical challenging manner that he absolutely fucking hates about her because it really does work on him.
“I, uh, I haven’t come up with the name yet,” Harry says, shrugging uncomfortably.
“Harry, have you finished your essay already?”
at him, swallowing up Draco’s features, his movements, the emotions written on the face of his.
The ceiling is too far from being as beautiful as the night sky that he stared at for thirty more minutes before sending the letter, but Harry still can’t look away. It’s comforting after a round of nightly nightmares, leaving him all panting and breathless on sweaty covers of his bed. He doesn’t need to think much to remember who he’s just dreamt of.
“Are you...are you sure we can find pomegranate blossom flowers in Hogsmeade?” Harry asks, but not because he doesn’t want to go. He would love to, actually. Talking to Luna has always been one of his soft spots, his favourite soft spots.
“This person has nothing to do with me now. Don’t try to convince yourself it all started out with that dare.”
“By the way,” thankfully, Mr Diler speaks, “are you familiar with saalep? The Autumn here is as cold as winters in Istanbul, so I was just making it for myself.”
He gets lost and then finds himself moving in already familiar routes. He terrorizes local patisseries and makes mental notes to always try out something new. He doesn’t get recognized in Wizarding Paris, not even once. He tries and fails miserably at speaking French.
“It’s not always Truth or Dare.”
After reading the letter, Harry sits in his chair and stares at the distance, at nothing in particular, his vision unfocused, chest rising up and down slowly. His head hurts a little bit, right in the center of his forehead, but it’s not intolerable.
Those thirty minutes were a mistake. He should’ve frozen his ass out and gone inside, immediately. He should’ve come back, gotten rid of the letter, tugged Ginny close and been lulled into sleep, surrounded by people he treasures the most.
It sounds so simple. It is simple, but sometimes all we need is to be put right in front of this simplicity to see it and to make sure that
he’s been better lately, he pushes his head back to this swamp, putting on his warm clothes and leaving the castle, almost as if he’s consciously punishing himself, almost as if he’s enjoying this act of pure and loud masochism.
“Well stop then.”
The station is busy, like any station. He hears French, English, Italian, Chinese, even Turkish through the crowd, and it smells like oily chocolate doughnuts a curly boy sells at the beginning of the platform, cigarette smoke and winter dirt. Everything moves around Harry, and he feels like he’s the only thing steady. He puts his hands in the pockets of his coat and tries to find a window, but there are only sets of stained glass just below the high ceiling. The sky is already black and of course no star is visible in this kind of toxic darkness of a big city.
And most of all, Harry thinks of Draco.
“I know one inte’resting atelie’r not fa’r from he’re, they do handmade paints. Zey use ze classic Ancient Egypt technique, wo’rk with mine’rals and clay. We could go ze’re beefo’re you leave, if you'd like it, I think zey’re clozed today.”
“Call me sensitive,” Bill chuckles when they find their seats in the train, “but I think I’ll always be excited for the train rides because of Hogwarts.”
“I need to find pomegranate blossom flowers, you know,” she says then, and Harry meets her gaze, dissolving in the chaotic energy of her mind, again. “Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me?”
“I didn’t even know we broke up,” Harry shrugs, and he realizes how exhausted he is because it’s actually an extremely uncomfortable situation and right now he feels nothing. He’s not in the right state of mind to react...anyhow. Otherwise he'd purse his lips apologetically, the theatrical genius he is.
And Harry has to re-read these two sentences thrice and then once again just to make sure his eyes are not lying to him.
“Err, what? Why?”
“Poor boy, I still owl him my tea, and even though I love my regular customers, I would be so happy if his sleep normalizes one day. He’s been my client for over two years now... Allahym yaarabbim, how fast the days change each other...”
On Monday and Tuesday Harry looks through the window and sees how beautiful autumn’s last breaths are. Grass greener and greener under the beaming sun, but with a different green, not May-fresh or June-popping. It’s a kind of green you can find pressed in between the sheets of your heaviest book. This exact hue is escorted with ochre-yellows, with tea-oranges, with crimson-reds, if you trace the trees with a quick glance. And no swirl of white up the endless blue of the sky.
Harry smiles at this, but he’s watching Hermione watching him. She answers him with a slight shrug, as they continue this little wordless dialogue, and Harry feels thirteen again.
“I’m fine, Ginny. I’m going to be fine. Don’t be.”
Harry digs his teeth into his bottom lip and swallows.
But the old man only chuckles instead.
“Cannot you take a break?”
“I guess it’s because you grew up not being used to this. Like, in hot countries they roller-skate, right?”
eans its big fluffy head to the right, still staring at the boy.
“It is very beautiful,” Ron says, joining Fleur in admiring the bird.
“ ‘arry? You aite?”
“Is he not a wizard?” Harry asks then, not sure if he wanted to know about mandrake tea.
And at the same time, turns out Draco Malfoy is a complete mystery for him, Harry Potter, and this feeling of interest, of an abstract attraction now that he knows he’s given an opportunity to explore, almost breathes something in him. He’s not as apathetic as he was a couple of months ago, and so what if it’s a Death Eater’s son that gives him all that these days? So what?
“Fuck,” Ron snorts again and Harry turns his head towards him a little, continuing doing his thing. “Bill says mom’s furious that you broke up and says it’s not a good idea for you to spend all the Christmas holidays at the Burrow, although mom still loves you more than some of her own children. It’s more for the sake of Gin, you know,” and Harry nods at it, because he’s thought about it before. This year, he wouldn’t stay there after Christmas even for Mrs Weasley’s treacle tart every day.
“It’s not something I’d like to talk about.”
“It feels like you do.”
“Does anyone have like, something to eat?” he asks, letting the owl have a seat on his forearm. She looks okay, a little tired but just fine. “I’ll take her to the kitchens then, I’m rather hungry myself. Anyone wants something?”
“Uh, I don’t know, the war maybe? Don’t you think it kind of has to do something with the state we’re all in now?”
Later, two hours after sending the owl, Harry learns that most of the owls stopped somewhere in the middle of their way, because the storm is to hit this night.
“Maybe he gets tired of you time after time too?..”
He writes it in the library, with ears burning so hot it almost hurts, carefully ignoring the subject of the way it was so pathetic of him to suppose Draco would really not recognize his fucking handwriting. And, in the end, there's nothing to say too, all he could do is to thank Draco for delicately...not roasting the living shit out of him.
But god he’s happy that doesn’t look disappointed or mad or anything negative. Even after Draco’s attitude towards her. She’s one of the most understanding people of all, although at the same time she’s almost unbreakable in her beliefs, and...yes. Hermione Granger is also a gem.
She looks absolutely and completely shocked. Harry hears Ron’s ‘The audacity!’ in his head and barely holds himself back from laughing.
The corners of Luna’s lips curl up in the slightest and her eyes roll up slowly, probably breaking through the ceiling and taking her high above the Earth to consult with the stars.
Bushy eyebrows jump up in recognition, and his smile only turns into a bit more surprised one.
Of course people don’t change, but Draco’s not a scared and lost little boy now. They grow up. It was one letter and way too few paragraphs, but there’s much more in him. Maybe they could be friends. Maybe they would finish it after a letter or two. But Draco Malfoy has never been and will never be an empty shell; and if he’s been attracting Harry so much with his problematic and fucking unbearable self for seven goddamn years...
“Didn’t you, eh, break up yesterday? I thought you were...mourning.”
He’s not lying. Not really. He’s going to try to make it work, because that’s what she deserves. It’s not her problem that he’s a little fuck up. It’s completely on him.
“Some time off. To think,” the man explains, lighting his cigarette. “While you’re not under pressure.”
“We p’robably won’t go out again today, and I just hate staying at home all day,” she admits when they step on the famous painters’ street. “It to’rtures me a little,” she chuckles, and Harry nods understandingly.
. Harry’s stupid Hero complex and yet he’s never made any effort to save the person he admired so much. Harry knows for sure he shouldn’t feel sorry, it’s fucking ridiculous. Still.
“She seems fucking dead, mate,” Neville points out observantly, and Harry nods, grabbing the letter with suddenly incredibly fast heart rate and mumbling something about taking her to Hagrid. The poor creature blinks at him with gratitude when there’s no water left in the goblet, and maneuvers onto Harry’s forearm.
“I think that’s what I should be asking you.”
so yeah these days it's all about my libra moon ass
so we’re slowly but surely moving towards the end yeah
“I won’t tell anyone,” she says after a couple of silent seconds, and Harry feels her fingers curling around his bicep. “If you don’t wish zem to know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Why does everything about Draco Malfoy has to be so bloody complicated, for fuck’s sake. He should be disappointed, he should be hurt, he should be a little bit mad, as well. He’s already bought a ticket to France, for god’s sake.
The bird blinks at them expectantly.
He feels defeated.
Harry has no right to live, not after this. And yet he’s there, right there, in the Gryffindor tower, shivering under cold blankets and starry night.
“I ztill can’t believe I’m so lucky to have a huzband who cookz,” Fleur laughs as they make their way into busy streets. “I’m bad at eve’rything zat is not spaghetti.”
They stand there silent for a couple of long moments, looking at each other, wearing completely different expressions.
When he does, he drops his hands down and looks up blindly, finally letting go of breath he didn’t know he was holding. He wishes he wouldn’t, though, because the only thing he craves more than a Time-Turner right now is a quick and painless death.
Harry winces when the owl breaks a dead mouse’s, the one of that Elves got her, spine.
The sound of someone’s steps behind Harry hits him before the smell of Hermione’s perfume. She sits next to him and sighs, her skin turns dark golden, her glistening eyes are almost honey-coloured. She’s almost blinding.
Harry’s own heart clenches at this, too.
Stupid, desperate and hopeless. Illogical, even. Fucking ridiculous.
to be better after some time.
filled with Trelawney’s deep voice, the sound of Hermione’s quill scribbling agains the parchment, Dean’s incredibly loud breaths and half-imaginary sound of his own beating heart is a torture. The blue envelope makes an impossibly hard weight in Harry’s pocket, and the boy feels both physically and mentally exhausted when the last lesson ends and they’re all standing up.
There’s a dare in the way she holds her chin and purses her lips, but her eyes aren’t squinted; the look in them is uncertain yet hopeful.
“Fleur?” Harry blurts out suddenly, his thoughts not quite catching up with his mouth.
Mr Diler answers him with a little smile and gives him more of those little sweet things, made of flour, drenched in honey and decorated with half of a walnut. They’re delicious.
“Jesus, Sylv,” Harry snorts, although it sounds like a sob instead. “This is disgusting.”
“I’ll never forget that time you got a letter from the Ministry at four in the morning and the bloody bird made sure to wake up every single one of us but you.”
“I just,” telling Hagrid about Draco,
He plomps on his bed, barely managing to kick off his sweats, and lets his eyes travel down the marble-white of the paper once again. He’s probably just hyperventilating, he thinks.
“So what if I am,” Harry asks over his shoulder without a question in his voice.
“Do you maybe happen to know if there are any nice art shops in Paris? My friend,” he says, awkward as ever, “is a painter and I still haven’t bought him a Christmas present.”
The train flinches and Draco’s shoulders tremble too. With a blink of his eyes, he comes back to reality. He looks down, then back, then moves his head a little to look through the window, and—
“Ah, good evening, young gentleman,” the old turkishman says when Harry enters it, breathing in the strong scent of weeds and dried fruit. “How can I help you today?”
Harry chuckles, but his smile still saddens a little.
Too bad Harry doesn’t think he doesn’t want to see Draco ever again, now. As much as he wouldn’t want it to be a confession, it sort of is.
“It looks like it’s gonna kill me,” Ron snorts but then breaks down in a smile. “Awww, look at that little beak!”
Today is an important day. Okay, he won’t be seeing him any time soon, maybe that time at the Platform half a year ago was the last time Harry Potter saw Draco Malfoy, but
And some of the scars it leaves might be permanent, no matter how much time had passed.
“I’d go with you but I have to finish this fuckery,” Ron sighs. “I wouldn’t mind a sandwich or two, though.”
Is it good enough to consider? Of course not.
Ron snorts.
Ginny. Right.
He’s a teenager. His body reacts hungrily to the touches of little warm hands and plump lips; reacts to the press of petite yet strong body and impressive curves against him. But something still goes missing every time, and that’s the problem. Something’s missing in his head, something that would make him react to whispers cried in trembling voice, to the sparkles in hazel eyes, to smiles and kisses that are supposed to be shared. Maybe the problem is that he’s known Ginny since she was ten and getting his dick hard to the thought of the person that’s practically his sister is weird; maybe it’s for a completely different and much more complicated reason: maybe the way she throws herself so selflessly on him makes Harry lose the excitement and passion...he doesn’t know. But he always, always feels as if he’s just used her, and not just her but her body to get off; and it’s fucking wrong. Who the hell thinks that of a person you’re supposed to be in love with?
Harry could stare at the bubbles in his butterbeer for ages if Ginny wouldn’t shift uncomfortably for the fourth time beside him. He looks at her a little reluctantly, while the Halloween party Ravenclaws decided to throw out this year run its course. There’s nothing Halloween-ish in it, though, except for pumpkin treats on the table, no one’s wearing a costume. It’s just an other reason to get drunk, but in a slightly bigger company.
someone as well. That seing the one you love in so much pain, undeserved, involuntary, cruel to the point of being almost impossible, in so much pain that means an inevitable change of that one’s whole being, might also crash you, crash and make sure you never come back to your old self again, too.
When both birds, well-fed and seemingly comforted, leave the room, Harry quickly opens the second envelope to make sure that it’s just an other letter from the Ministry’s Auror Department about their program that Harry’s already accepted to. And Ron. And Cho.
“You’re complaining,” Harry grins.
“Yavrum?”
The way Draco’s hair was gleaming in the sun. The way he let its rays lick his face when it wasn’t hot or warm — only when it was cool and delicate. The way it sharpened his ivory-carved skin, his pointed jaw and cheekbones throwing deep shadows on the rest of his face,
“It’s Gab’rielle. See, as siste’rs, we’re ‘really close, and zometimes she tells me things zat...accidentally d’raw he’r attention,” she starts talking, and yes, based on the way she looks at him it is absolutely, completely clear that Harry’s miserable moron-esque mug has just confirmed everything she needed to know about her “stoopid assumption”. How the fuck could he forget that Gabrielle also attends Beauxbatons.
“A p’recu’rso’r of a gööd Zaint Sylveste’r,” Fleur purrs, straightening up.
“Fleur,” Harry then tries, as cool and collected as he can, “what is it?”
“You look better, Harry,” Luna says when they’re walking down the hill towards Hagrid’s pumpkins. Halloween’s approaching, and orange giants keep growing in size. Harry shrugs. He only decides he likes letting Luna walk with him because she doesn’t ask any questions.
“Did you make your tea?” Harry asks then, voice still a little rough from sleep and wordlessness.
Harry lets a couple of moments pass, lower lip between his teeth.
‘Hi lads, you see, my good pal Draco Malfoy took care of getting me a Christmas slash New Year present, and that’s how I ended up with a new owl. Happy New Year’s day to y'all from him, by the way!’

,” Hermione whispers, her wand pointed to the letter, and her eyes meet Harry’s for a brief second with a very odd expression.
“I don’t know. You tell me.”
Harry chuckles and shrugs.
“Let’s take you to Hagrid, love,” Harry whispers and pats her head with the knuckle of his index finger. “It’s a shorter walk.”
Harry rubs his eyes with his thumb and index finger. Takes a few deep breaths. Tries to sober up a little. The letters are wobbly and the flow of his words is even worse. He’s not in the right condition to
Hedwig’s feathers were just like these snowflakes, just like them. Softer, much softer, but just as white, clean, gracious in their glory. Beautiful.
“It’s not what ye were talking about, rite?”
He desperately wants to write that he wonders if Draco could beat him in one-to-one game.
“Well as long as everyone keeps treating her as one,” Ron answers almost politely, and it’s so—in a brotherish way it doesn’t sound wrong. “Oh shit, Bill says they’re going to visit Fleur’s parents the day after Christmas and invites us to go with them. They’re gonna spend two weeks or so in Paris. Not like I think there would be...”
with anticipation. An hour should be enough to read a letter. Maybe even more if they all go to the Common Rooms after dinner.
Draco Malfoy is the most exhausting person in the World.
Harry bites his lip nervously but decides to not cross the paragraph. If Draco decides it sounds pathetic, okay. But Harry rather reads it in his letter, not in his own feverish mind.
A family of three, with a little girl in between, with her hands squeezed in her parents’ hands, laughs as they run towards the enter. Couples either say their goodbyes and i-promise-yous or walk in together, smiling. Always-busy workers march into the doors with their long hurried steps.
She saved his life, after all.
He doesn’t really understand the nature of silence after his words, if it’s tensed or encouraging, or just blunt; but then Fleur, bless her heart, smiles and stand up from her seat at the table.
Harry stops writing again and lets himself fall back onto the cool ground, grabbing fistful of grass. His eyes are wide open, his chest rises and falls like he’s been playing Quidditch for four hours.
“Is that your favourite word now?”
“Have to give you a name, don’t I,” he tries, clearing his throat with a soft cough.
“Well...not like I’m planning to mourn anyway.”
“Yes, ‘a’rry?”
guys thank you so much for all your likes and comments, i couldn’t be more grateful for such readers. i love and appreciate every single one of you, hope you like where the story goes
No, he feels like a loser. He doesn’t feel right.
Harry lets out a wet laugh.
The softest autumn breeze smells like slowly rotting leaves and warm earth, and Harry lets it kiss away the heat on his cheeks and neck. The grass tickles his ankles, his head is dizzy, and every single tree sounds different under the gentle touches of the wind.
Yeah, though Harry meant it because he knows he could easily fall again and Draco probably just hates him. But after reading the next sentence, Harry just wants to slap himself.
“I just hope the letter is not about that. In any case, there are ink and parchment on the second shelf.”
Ginny lets a small smile touch the corners of her lips. Then she reaches out to Harry’s free hand and covers it with her small fingers.
He looks at Harry. Harry watches the shadow of recognition passing the lovely grey eyes of his, and then his scarlet lips fall apart. He must be breathing out heavily, because there is a sweaty spot forming on the window glass. The blond needs two or three seconds to collect himself, then he looks to the back, he looks at the watch on his wrist, he tries to stand up, but Harry already knows it’s not going to happen. The wheels of his train slowly start moving. Draco feels it too, and looks at Harry again, his cheeks visibly redder. His irises are darker and the spark in them shines brighter. Harry feels the corners of his lips curling up. Draco shakes his head slowly, the look in his eyes is a storm of emotions — shock, anger, irritation, resistance, but they’re screaming at Harry, and he knows for sure what they’re trying to say. He understands them.
His mind starts wandering a bit further, to the future. In the end, they won’t ever be real friends, they eventually will stop writing each other, they will probably really never meet...and it hurts more that Harry would like to admit.
Harry wants to punch himself in the face for writing this. He also knows he will probably regret writing the next paragraph, but something in his chest screams for a revelation. He obliges.
is one to be black. So black Harry could reach down to its waters and never wash away the stains on his skin. So back Harry could use it to write the letter. So black Harry could drown himself in it, and his sorrow and guilt would dissolve completely.
about Draco, maybe wouldn’t be a good idea. At least not now. Who knows, maybe it won’t go anywhere at all and wasting time on discussing this all would be...rather pointless. And at the same time, who Harry thinks he is to lie to Hagrid’s face? “I don’t know what to do.”
“Tell me what you want me to say, Gin,” he murmurs again, his eyes not leaving hers, and he almost sees the familiar resistance of green and red between them, how fucking ironic. So ironic he’s ready to break down and cry, but this time Ginny doesn’t say a word in return. She only stares at him, wide-eyed and petrified, lips pressed together tightly, teeth clenched, cheeks burning insanely hot. Harry shortly nods and leaves the Common Room, hoping that she has just finally understood.
Luna begins to slice one more lemon.
It’s true, he hates thinking about his stupid crush. His obsession with Malfoy had never supposed to be what it was. An obsession with a vain, self-centered, cruel pure-blood. The Boy Who Lived and a Death Eater’s son. Later a Death Eater himself.
“Oh my god,” Harry breaths out surprisedly when Mr Diler adds the third spoonful of sugar. Even considering the size of these spoons, it’s still a lot — the glasses are not exactly huge either, about four or five medium-sized sips. “Such tea? With this?” he points at the honeycomb sweet. “Unimaginable.”
“Good night everyone.”
And why does it feel right to be the person he is now, then?
“Harry, good mor—good grief, who’s this?” Bill exhales lightly, lips curving into a smile.
thank you for being patient with me. i know it took me a while, but i really am not planning to give up on this work. remember to stay safe and always take care in these trying times
. He trusts Harry. He opens up, brick by brick, little by little. And what Harry gets is so much better than anything, anything else he can think of.
. Of life he has to lead, of life he is capable of leading even with hands covered in blood and stone-cold faces, imprinted on the inside of his eyeballs.
He tells her about the tea and thankfully she doesn’t wonder how he learned about it. Instead, she tells him how she was looking for mandrake tea and the only non-magical place to sell it was Mr Diler’s shop.
“As if
“And with what, then?”
Harry’s cheeks start burning, but he still nods.
Harry bites his lip and hides his fists in the pockets of his coat, nails digging up in the flesh of his palms mercilessly. He looks almost triumphant.
Why does it feel right to admit to his own damn self that he’s just used to the idea of Ginny? The idea of liking her, having her, thinking about her, letting her care about him? Not...not loving her. Not
The night of Wednesday is particularly cold and uncomfortable, and after lying in his bed for an hour or more, Harry decides to go down to the kitchens and drink the tea for the first time.
Harry nods and finally decides on poached eggs and a cheese toast. His eyes of course drift away to Draco’s former spot at the Slytherin table, but this time he at least has an explanation. Poached eggs were Draco’s favourite.
Now he knows it’s really not.
When Harry gets out of the building, he already feels small. He suddenly wonders if the sky would swallow him up and leave nothing in return, no one to face the blushing rise of the next day. It’s not black anymore, like it looked from the tower. It’s so deeply blue Harry feels he could drown.
“I don’t know what else to do,” the boy shrugs, but on the inside, he feels completely different. He has never, ever said this out loud, but somehow it made him feel a hundred times lighter.
“Or Vester. Very masculine.”
Harry looks through the window at the Great Lake, indifferently blue and cold under the clear frosty sky. Soon its shores will be wrapped in ice too, and Harry already knows that each skating session’s gonna be bittersweet, all because of one grey-eyed wonder.
Harry thinks once again about Lucius Malfoy’s hard wrathful gaze, his lips white, pressed against each other; and Narcissa’s dry but warm fingers right above his heart, her whisper — she was barely breathing, too petrified and shaken yet still driven by her neverending love, and dips the tip of his quill into ink once again.
It’s been a week since the huge grey owl with exhausted amber eyes threw the letter in Harry’s porridge, and the devastation seems to only be growing.
“Your friend Draco has a sweeter tooth than me,” he says, and Harry catches himself freezing at the sound of this name and then staring at Mr Diler wide-eyed, ready to swallow every bit of information. “Although he likes his tea strong, with milk and no sugar, his coffee tastes like a coffee-scented candy,” he cuts his honeycomb into two and chuckles. Harry doesn’t even try to hide his smile. “And the tea, oh he drinks his tea first, till the last droplet, and then begins with his dessert. I used to think he only drinks tea to make an excuse for all the sugar he consumes on a daily basis, but it didn’t take me long to find out that he doesn’t need tea to have a huge slice of cake in the middle of the day just because.”
“Mate,” he breathes out, face still pink and fresh after the morning routine. “You look awful.”
When Harry nods and decides on thanking him, Hagrid only shakes his head and strokes the owl’s feathers once again.
“Sylv for short,” Bill offers, laughing.
“No,” she cries and shakes her head. “I don’t want to break up, I’m just worried.”
He professionally ditches every single one of his friends and returns to their empty dorm, literally
“A what?” Bill asks, taking the kettle off the fire.
“Hello, sir, I was wondering if you have the, um, the Sleeping Tea?” he offers a little unsurely, but meets no hesitation.
They step on the platform in Paris, and Harry feels just the least bit of heartbroken. He’s still excited, anticipating those upcoming days in a completely new city, and when the rest of his group leaves to find the restrooms, the thought of being the only single one in this trip doesn’t even upset him. Everything goes like it should be going.
“It was such an odd experience,” Luna says and smiles to herself. Harry then looks at her, she’s chopping her lemons peacefully to add them into her fruit salad.
“Well, you usually brood for a couple of days and come back cool, but now it’s been three weeks and you still look as if you’ve been Kissed.”
“Sometimes I think of dropping out, but this would be an ultimate dick-move,” Harry admits feverishly in the end, while having tea with Mr Diler — who he kindly decides to enlighten about his future plans (or the lack of them) — and blushes furiously a moment later, realizing his language could actually be more...eloquent than that.
“It’s a completely different story, ‘arry,” Hagrid breathes out with a hint of a smile in his low yet tender voice. “It doesn’t mean ye should do what ye don want to do just because you haven’t found the right path to follow.”
“I forgot I have to feed the slugs,” he says, standing up. “Ye can wait for me here, if yev got nothin’ to do.”
“Fine, I
Ginny’s voice sounds out of place. Anyone’s would. With an exception of maybe Hagrid’s. Or Luna’s.
Finally. One reason to stop writing letters to Draco Malfoy.
please do not hesitate and tell me if it sucks
He remembers playing with Draco. Even though out of ten he’d catch six Snitches, Draco’s four is already fucking good. He’s always been the biggest competition for Harry, whether his play was clean or dirty.
“It’s a he,” Harry says fondly. The beak is small, adorably curved and shockingly lemonish-yellow against dusty browns and warm whites of his feathers.
He thinks he must be dreaming when he hears the familiar sound of a birds swooping down. He thinks he’s gone mental when he feels a small weight on his shoulder.
There are still people on the square, and even a couple of painters smile politely at them as Harry inspects the drawings they sell. A lot of cartoonists, modern art followers, masters of pencil and charcoal portraits as well. Watercolour, oil paintings, the Eiffel Tower in millions of techniques. The painters are all different, too. Some of them are properly artistic, with old worn berets and colourful, patterned scarves tied around their necks. With tiny spectacles on the top of their noses and vintage coats and jackets. Some of them are in woolen jean jackets, right jeans hugging their knees pretentiously and small hats that show off the tips of their ears and let the hair curl on the nape of their necks. Some women wear long gypsy-like skirts and some prefer wide velvet trousers. Younger artists, there is a few of them, are shaking in their sneakers and biker jackets, the tips of their noses alarmingly red. But almost all of them smoke, some in groups, some of them alone, sneaking up snobbish glasses to the left and to the right.
With demonically beathing heart and dreadfully shaking hands, Harry opens the little note attached to the letter.
Harry opens his mouth to say that he’s never considered this as an option, but then the door opens with a whistle and Luna lets inside a wave of cold, icy air. She smiles when she sees them both, and although nothing could have had her ready to encounter Harry as well as Mr Diler, her face remains steady and unbothered.
He wakes up with a much stronger version of it.
Fleur is a really, really smart witch. Too bad Harry’s a pretty fucking dumb wizard.
With a missed heartbeat, Harry realizes, it’s either dump the letter and start a new one right now or no coming back.
Ginny clears her throat. Harry still doesn’t look at her, but not because of fear or reluctance. He’s too drowned in watching.
“Don’t you think we don’t talk enough?”
The familiar feeling of guilt starts building up Harry’s chest. The sixth year; the year that changed everything and the year he himself changed nothing, although he could.
“It would be great, actually, thank you very much.”
Wide awake again, Harry’s lying in the bed and thinking, thinking, thinking. The sweat on his forehead has been cold for awhile, his heart is beating merely, almost solemnly in the depth of the night; and yet the cheeks under unblinking eyes are paler then the moonlight, and the sheets under the palms of his unmoving hands are way too crumbled.
She shoots him a mock-coquettish look and chuckles, and that is what alarms Harry the next second. His lets his smile slip away, lets his heart out on a no-winning race with his blood pressure, and just melts into panic, pathetically, helplessly and ultimately gayly. He may be an idiot but he’s not stupid, he can tell when someone’s got dirt on him.
Not sneering. Not smirking or teasing. Long legs stretched, ankles crossed, pale fingers holding a quill. A little crease in between eyebrows. In the end, he was the second-best student, he studied a lot. And staring at him while he was concentrated and focused was sometimes better than bickering...and fighting.
He knows he’s absolutely fine when a beautiful grey owl blinks at him with her big wise eyes and fidgets a little, trying to point him at her own weight. Of course it’s a blue envelope. Of course it’s
It doesn’t go all too bad the next day, at least that’s what Harry’s thinking when the two of them are walking down the road in comfortable silence. It’s quiet and cool, and the the air drowns them in a cold blue haze. All the leaves are brown and in a week all of them will be sputtered on the ground.
She knows everything. It’s fucking terrifying. Especially when she looks at him like that, like that goddamn owl, with her brows raised slightly, the corners of her lips deeper than they usually are in an almost-mocking half-smirk, her eyes shining mischievously. Hermione Granger is fucking terrifying.
