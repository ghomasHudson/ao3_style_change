“Why did you do that?” Draco huffed angrily.
Draco started to stammer an apology but Harry opened the doors and entered the Great Hall with a hard stare in his eyes, closing the doors behind him. Draco fell to his knees, clutching the fabric of his tunic where his heart hurt as it never had. He felt tears rising to his stinging eyes and knew he should not cry in the hallway, it would make him an easy target, but couldn’t bring himself to move as he had to support his weight with his other hand on the floor because
“It’s ok, I’m sorry, ok? I shouldn’t have asked I’m sorry I’m sorry…” Harry’s voice was velvet and Draco was sobbing in his arms as he whispered apologies and they just sat there for a few minutes until Draco was better and Harry was just there but Draco didn’t told him to get away because he was enjoying the closeness so much and well, if he was going to hell at least he could enjoy the way to the abyss.
Draco watched Harry look blankly at the firebee honey and suddenly wanted to cry.
“So, I’ve noted we have potions together, right?” Draco tried to talk about something easy, safe.
“Could you show me?”
“Geez, Hermione, I told you, I’m fine.” Harry cut her exasperated, turning his attention to his Potions book in an obvious attempt to end the conversation and make them go away (
). Draco turned and he saw the same eyes that had been watching him the night before, and all that day, eyes now filled with worry and a concern so sincere that Draco couldn’t contain the choked sob that fought to escape his lips (
And Harry couldn’t just leave him there, not when he was looking so vulnerable and small.
got accepted w a full ride to college
The moans escaping his lips couldn’t be less Malfoy, but he couldn’t care less either. He just wanted Harry,
When time was up, Professor Slughorn asked for volunteers to being the first table to show their results and, unsurprisingly, Granger’s hand shot up. She and her partner, Weasley, went to the front with their vial. Granger was serene, though the red haired boy looked a tad nervous. When Granger drank a few drops of the poison she turned into what looked like a perfect replica of her carved into a block of cherry tree. Then Slughorn offered the bottle with the antidote to Weasley, who dipped his index finger in it and dabbed Hermione lips with it. Slowly, she started to recover, blinking and shaking her head a little. When she was fully herself, the class broke into applause. Slughorn watched, pleased with his star student last triumph. All partners continued to pass as they were seated in the room, so Draco and Harry were left for the last. Draco wasn’t worried about the test, he knew he had done properly the potion and it wouldn’t cause any problems. Harry, on the other hand, looked more nervous but Draco thought he knew why. Not knowing exactly what he had done nor how to know if the potion was well done, Harry’s fear was more for the unknown than for the poison. Draco, knowing this, took the vial to drink first but Harry stopped his hand in mid-air, taking the bottle from him to his utter surprise. He gulped once with eyes scrunched shut and waited. Draco saw as he turned into a wooden mannequin, oak by the looks of it.
Then he felt it. First it wasn’t more than a whoosh of air, like a summer breeze. Then it was like the blanket his mother used to cover him when he came home after a day of playing in the snow. He turned to see what it was and there was
“Are you sure you’re fine?” He shook his head again.
“Why did you do that?” Harry looked angry, although Draco was pretty sure that he wasn’t angry with him but with the whole situation.
“No problem… Are you ok?”
“You two realize that administering any kind of “medicine” or any other potion without the required license is a crime, don’t you?”
After what Draco thought was an eternity, he heard steps coming to the living room.
“It is a poison, named Licroatan because of its creator, a wizard who gave it to his own son to test it. It is known not only for the slow development of signs of illness but also for the peculiar symptoms it gives to the victim, who first notes a stomach ache which guides him to the wrong conclusion of a normal infection, though after three days of the poison making effect the victim will show a fast deterioration of nails and teeth and in this phase any treatment is useless and the victim will die in the fourth day of poisoning.”
) and he was asleep in his arms. Harry watched him breathe deeply, his face relaxed as he had not seen it before, his hair almost white in the sunshine, encompassing his face like a halo. Harry traced with his eyes the other boy’s lashes as they started to flutter.
Draco crumbled into Harry’s arms as he sobbed uncontrollably, too hurt and shattered that he couldn’t talk for the time being. Harry’s hands trailed to his back, rubbing it comfortably as his sobs calmed and he wasn’t trembling so badly.
“I see you already have companions, Potter. See you later, I’m afraid.”
“I told you, didn’t I? We’re friends now.”
“Professor, he’s right.” Harry suddenly spoke after his silent observation.
Draco instructed the mass to move a foot, two feet.
as she passed him.
It wasn’t until they were at the infirmary that Draco began to process what had happened.
Draco thought,
Anyway, Draco was a sculpture now. A beautiful, perfectly detailed sculpture carved in ash tree. For a moment Harry thought that he had never seen anything so gorgeous but then he remembered the way Draco had looked that sunrise, a few hours before he woke, sleeping safely between his arms with his face showing the most peaceful features ever. A slight blush crept to his cheeks when Slughorn poked him lightly in the arm with the antidote. He had forgotten where he was and what he was supposed to be doing. He had forgotten everything but the statue of the boy he loved in front of him. Harry took some antidote with his thumb and cupping his face with his hand, ran it over Draco’s lips. Then he saw how the silver haired boy started to become alive again, his eyelids fluttering as if he was dreaming and his features scrunching up. He gasped as if he were emerging from deep waters and opened his eyes. Those grey eyes that looked afraid until they met his gaze. The same eyes he had seen sparkle with fury, hate and resentment but also glow with a soft light until they looked like abysmal pitches of molten silver.
While making their way to the Great Hall Draco wondered how it was possible for Harry to act as if nothing had happened, like they were just two normal teenagers meeting for the first time. At least, that was what he thought until they reached the doors of the Hall, because then his knees went wobbly and he couldn’t breathe and all he could thought of were ways of escaping what was to come, the enter to the Hall full of students, all whispering, talking about the latest news of the Boy Who Lived and how he was now stuck with the Death Eater.
“No, I mean…” Harry lifted his hand to his closed eyes and hold his nose bridge, as if trying to calm a headache.
“How can you say that!? It affects you! And you’re my friend, how can it not affect me too?”
Draco gazed through a crack between the door and the frame into the hallway. Nobody. He took a step forward and halted when he heard
“Draco, come here, I’ll present you to some friends.” Draco followed him hesitantly, pretty sure that this wouldn’t end well for him.
He sat on the couch.
Draco had stood up without noticing and, after finishing his inner debate and taking note of his surroundings, decided that the best course of action at the moment was going back to his (their) room and taking a bath. A hot, long bath where he could think better. And if fucking Potter was in the room, well, he could perfectly go fuck himself somewhere else.
“Now, who can tell me what kind of potion are we going to brew today?” He hadn’t even finished the question when Hermione’s hand was up. “Ah, Miss Granger, as helpful as always.” Slughorn indicated Granger to answer with a nod.
When the bell ringed Harry managed to swallow the chump of food he was chomping and stood.
“Professor,” Draco tried to pretend security and found it pretty easy thanks to the rage that Harry had caused in him. “my name was written in the same sample that Harry’s, we both made the potion.”
“Draco?”
“Well, well, well, who would have thought that the heir of the mighty house of Malfoy was such a cry baby?” Harry taunted Draco from the bathroom.
“I didn’t want to eat indoors today.”
Draco kept watching him as he laid his clothes on his untouched bed. When Harry motioned to unwrap the towel without complaints of Draco’s presence Draco turned his head away so fast that his neck snapped. With his face burning red and his back facing Harry, he started talking in an attempt to distract himself from the fact that his roommate was practically nude (
In any case, he needed to drop his books in their room but when he turned to go he almost tripped on Draco’s books. The man had left them before hurrying away. Harry took them too, planning to leave them in Draco’s bed as he did so.
Harry looked up from his position, which was unfavourable to say the least. His upper half was hugging an unconscious Draco, while his lower half was still covered by the Invisibility Cloak.
), maybe waiting him to cool down.
As the class returned their attention to whatever they had been doing before the disturbance, Draco noticed the sad look in Harry’s face, though he chose to ignore it as they strolled to their table.
“After all,” the boy said in a singsong tone. “You were the one who did it.”
about it, less worrying about it.”
Two steps more. Draco knew he had to erase any thought away of his mind or the Dark Lord would be able to see it.
“So soft and bright… What do you use, strawberry and mint?”
“You see, my Draco, I have found something I believe you will actually like.” The Dark Lord raised from his throne and started pacing in front of it. “Since you are always complaining about
Harry shook the sleeping boy to wake him, worry darkening his green eyes.
Draco laid back his head and closed his eyes, his hands starting to wander down in the warm water.
whispered that stupid part of him which was crazy for Potter.
Draco had been on and off consciousness, the short periods when he was awake. During those moments, Harry made sure to bring a glass of water to the sick boy’s lips. When he looked like he was finally asleep and not just out of it, Harry relaxed just the tiniest bit. His heart ached to see Draco in pain and, although a part of him was urging him to go look for the ones that had done this to him, Harry also knew that his place right now was here, beside him.
life has been hectic
“How come? And what are you doing now?” Harry looked interested in what Draco was doing in the potion.
“Let’s go.” And Draco smiled the smallest of the smiles, but also the most shy of them.
Draco raised his blushing face from his hands and saw an embarrassed Harry looking away.
Before Draco had taken a decision, the bell rang and the students walked out of the classroom. Except Harry, who was heading to Slughorn’s desk with an aura of determination. Draco hurried after him and held him by the arm before he reached his destiny.
Draco sneered at the one called Hilda, eliciting a gasped giggle from the leader, Maggie. “Oh, he
Draco half opened his eyes and saw a blushing Potter holding a towel in his direction.
“Humm?” Harry was brushing his teeth and came to check his hair (which, if Draco was asked, was as messy as always and Harry had no way of solving it) in the drawer mirror.
Which is why, really, he never saw them coming.
He made an unsure sound, remembering Ron’s cold stare all through the meal.
“Hey.”
At this point Draco didn’t care at all about his master’s skills in Legillimens, he only wanted to stop hurting (everyone else and himself). If he had cared to look at the Dark Lord, he would have seen curiosity in his gaze.
Enjoy!!
“I don’t mind being your partner.”
Draco used the slow voice that adults use to explain something to a toddler. “I won’t go into the Great Hall if I can avoid it, even if it means skipping some dinners.”
Draco put on some jeans and was trying to decide whether to wear a t-shirt or a shirt when Harry appeared at the door, all damp hair and residual mist from his shower which, Draco noticed, hadn’t been a cold one. He finally took the plain black shirt and started to button it up, watching Harry’s back muscles swiftly moving under the skin as he stretched to unhang his clothes from the closet racks.
School. Moving out. etc...
“Uh-huh.” Draco sniffed for the last time.
dorm… With Harry sleeping in the bed beside him.
“Imperio.”
) table, Harry was done with cleaning the cauldron and sweeping the garbage to the can.
) and the background swiftly changed to resemble their room. Draco could still tell this was a dream, for there were little incongruences in the room, as the sky being crystal clear with two suns and the beds lacking their canopies.
Harry followed a stomping Draco to the room and watched for a minute how the boy with the hair as fair as the moon started taking his scarce possessions out of his trunk with brisk movements, throwing his school materials carelessly to the tidied bed.
This time, though, Draco didn’t say hi, he just watched him, smiling until Harry removed his hand from Draco’s face. Then Slughorn gave orders for everyone to sit again as he was going to announce the grades from their Licroatans potions.
to be his partner, why had he got the poxbearer, motherswiner, loosegob, airknob Potter?
Draco looked up to see Harry’s face just as red as his and him looking actually timid.
Draco kept on walking to the source of the voices, from where he could now see a faint light coming.
HERE IS THE ANGST!!!!!!!!
“What?” As Draco rummaged through the closet he sensed Harry closing the bathroom’s door and pictured himself checking for what had he been talking about. He heard Harry take a hard breath and smiled to himself.
“Should I assume that you have found the Chosen One?” Draco tried to ask this as indifferent as he could while he was fretting in the inside. Had his Master really found him? What was all this about? What did he mean by
). Draco saw as Weasley shot Harry a filthy look as he guided a hurt-looking Granger to their own table.
Draco snapped out of his stupor at the same time that Harry emerged from the bathroom, hair still a mess but now without a shirt.
“Yeah…” When Draco turned he discovered Harry looking at him with something darkening those clear eyes. He started a little but then he just sighed and broke the eye contact, instead advancing toward the bedroom.
He banged his head against the Vanishing Cabinet’s doors, hoping for someone to hear him.
“Are you sure? I’m not trying to pressure but that sounded like you would want some food.” Draco was dying of embarrassment by now, his face blushing furiously as he tried to hide it behind his pale hair.
Madame Pomfrey lay Draco carefully on the bed, her eyes wide open with surprise.
Draco scolded himself as he saw how Potter’s eyes lit up with his answer.
“Ha. Our potion? We both know you made the difficult part of it.”
Harry stayed silent, still confused about the whole situation that had unfolded in front of him.
And then Harry was gone and he was left with a whole hour to himself.
Harry put on his pants, banning Draco from the previous glorious sight. “I don’t think that’s wise. The teachers said yesterday that we’ll have today’s afternoon to get installed in our new dorms and I can’t lose any more potion classes. Sorry, though.” Harry was now securing his tie to his shirt with a charm against the wild fall wind.
“Yeah.”
“Hey, don’t be angry, I was joking.”
hello,
Harry noticed the pain in Draco’s eyes and with eyes dark from barely contained fury said “I won’t forget this, Draco. I may let it pass for now, but I’ll remember.” Then his eyes turned the green of the grass, of the hope Draco wanted so desperately to have. “Let’s get done with this, shall we?”
Draco sat at his usual spot at the far end of the table and pretended to rummage in his bag as he saw Weasley and Granger approaching their table.
“A snake that speaks!” Hilda clapped in excitement. “Most of the disgusting reptiles we pick up can only sob and beg mercy. This is nice!”
Draco strode helplessly in the direction the voice came from, finding a little boy crouched beside a girl holding something, her back towards Draco.
also for a while i was completely unable to write so.
Now he would have to take a shower. He stood, flushing away the bath and with it any thoughts of what couldn’t be. He opened the faucet, punishing himself with a cold shower for his stupidity.
“Good morning class!” Slughorn greeted the student as cheery as always, a habit that unnerved Draco to the point of tensing his body at the moment he heard the salute. “Today we’ll have an interesting task to accomplish; please, dear lass, distribute this among your peers, thank you darling.” Slughorn spoke as the sheets of parchment circulated between the tables. Draco and Harry’s table, being the farther from the front, was the last to get the assignment. Draco scrutinized the recipe, mentally making a list of the ingredients they were going to need for the potion as he also noticed it was a very dangerous poison, though nothing hard to prepare.
Draco almost fell off the bench from the surprise.
Harry woke up surrounded by sunlight. He blinked placidly a couple of times before noticing the foreign weight on his left arm. He turned and saw
Draco scowled at Harry’s way. Harry just threw him an exhausted look. He didn’t look like he had got a lot of sleep these past days. Not that anyone could, after all the atrocities they had witnessed the week before this. The day when he had chosen his loyalties. When he had lost so many friends and so much of his innocence. The day when the end began.
Draco was getting a bit impatient and tried to press his groin against the other boy’s thigh but Harry held his hips down.
Draco was a little touched by this, but he had to explain this to Harry.
“Let’s get going.”
“Madame Pomfrey! You have to help them! They’re poisoning the Slytherins! Please Madame Pomfrey, you can’t let the littluns die! Please.” In his fervour, Draco had gripped Madame Pomfrey’s arms, but now he was drifting away.
Draco continued to put his things in order as he waited for Harry to return, his mood better than it was at lunch.
“What did you found, darling?”
istg i intended to update this sooner and the half chapter has been sitting on my laptop for at least four months
And then he was in the middle of the hallway in front of the Potion’s classroom, half stunned and with a very painful stomach ache.
And he was just staring at Harry trying to come up with an acceptable excuse when he remembered.
“Thank you. I love you.”
Inserting wolfstar crumbs everywhere I go even in fics where they’re dead=doing gods work
“-Look guys, I really appreciate your concern but I don’t want to talk about it. I’m gonna go home for the night. I love you all.”
Before Malfoy had arrived, he had been wondering whether or not he would be able to pull off getting laid with Charlie’s boyfriend in the house. He thought he might be able to do it, the guy might not mind, or he’d be able to sneak someone in and out, but as soon as the blonde showed up on his doorstep, those dreams went out the window. Not with Draco Malfoy in the house.
Draco had managed to leave two decent side marks before Harry pushed him back, quickly, against the wall, pressing his needing body into Draco’s and “
“Out loud, mate” Dean prompted.
about him and Harry and it was bad enough Granger probably already knows. Pansy, Hogwarts’ next Rita Skeeter would be the end of him.
between he and Draco and the past months but they hadn’t talked. About any of it. Ever. And now that they were finally on the same side, maybe, just maybe they could finally just talk.
“And you
. I was scared, I was scared and stupid and I didn’t even know what it would
He moaned around Harry’s cock which made Harry thrust sharply into Draco’s mouth. “Sorry, sorry sorry-“ Harry stuttered, thumb gently rubbing Draco’s cheek. It was fifthly. And he loved it. Watching Draco
that he had a camera to capture the about twenty emotions that flashed over Harry’s face in about five seconds. “I’ll explain. Just go walk over to the corner over there.” He ordered, hoping in a way that was enticing and not insane. Merlin, his pulse was
“Please” Draco whispered, temptation thick in his voice.
Without having much memory of how he got there, Draco arrived at the top of the astronomy tower, the familiar sights of his panic spot comforting to him. He checked one of the chests and...yes, perfect. The blanket he had stashed away 6
“Why did you spill your drink?” Harry asked, making it sound so casual but Ron took a step forward, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Draco looked around, virtually
Draco indulged him, letting Harry’s tongue seek out revenance in Draco’s hot, waiting mouth.  Draco’s hand, partly slick with Harry’s spit, worked slowly up and down Harry’s shaft. He applied more pressure at the base, telling Harry that this will be a waiting game. With his other hand, Draco wrapped it around Harry’s waist, trailing down before grabbing a handful of Harry’s ass.
“Anything” Harry whispered, leaning down to capture Malfoy’s mouth with a kiss before rolling on his side.
. As the lump started looking more and more human, Draco felt the pain of a new amount of guilt adding to his burden. When it finally resembled Potter (a battered, pathetic echo of Potter), it turned his gaze at him.
“Sure, you can ask but I’ll decide to answer.” Draco said with a little laugh.
“Enough.”
also here things (kinda) go down if you know what i mean...
“Mr. Potter?” Flitwick was clearly annoyed by the interruption.
“Shit.” Draco averted his gaze as he let his hands drop the book he was holding. “I’m sorry, Draco, I should have noticed.” Harry’s brows furrowed in concentration as he tried to remember all the little evil things he had been seeing without paying attention, the sudden falls of students who casually were from Slytherin, the way their house hourglass didn’t seem to add up and the most recent incident in Potions that morning, as Draco had himself pointed.
“Actually, I’d prefer that you called me Harry, if that’s ok with you.” (
“I’m gonna go to sleep.” He announced.
WHERE IS THE ANGST??????
Harry turned again to button up his shirt and started talking with his back to Draco.
He got to the door and stopped, watching Potter with what he hoped was an inquisitive stare rather than a terrified glance.
shouted the rational part.
“What?” Harry scorned towards Draco. “Are you going to tell me this isn’t worth it? To let it go? That your grades are less important than mine? Or are you just afraid of speaking up?”
Harry just watched, half amused half awed, as his roommate tried to explain why had he woken with a boner
“Malfoy, are you really awake?”
“Ok, if you want to, you know I’ll be there ok?”
Draco couldn’t imagine a more awkward situation that waking up to morning wood after sleeping with the boy you love. That is, he couldn’t, until said boy had jumped out of bed and shut himself in the bathroom after asking who was the girl (
The bulk in the floor writhed in agony but Draco kept his wand steady.
When he opened the door, he was met with an empty room, as Harry was still in class. He took his time getting ready and picking up his supplies for next class, which reminded him, he had Potions, with Harry.
Draco moaned and buried his face deeper in his pillow. Harry, as if summoned by a spell, poked his head out of the bathroom.
Sorry for being dead for what? four months? So SORRY
“Before you give me some “medicine”, may I ask what is it?”
Draco could only hope that he was in Hogwarts still. If he was in Borgin&Burkes…
“---serious, I turn a second and you’re having an attack?”
Harry was pacing in the hallway, where Draco had left him. Why hadn’t he chased him? No, that wouldn’t have been wise. He knew he had royally fucked up. Why did he have to go and ruin it? It had been all going well, but no, let Harry Potter and his hero complex (now I’m sounding like Mione) go and do something stupid. But he was going to give up. Harry couldn’t let him. He knew how important was Potions for Draco. But did he really have to pull his influence like that? That had been reckless and stupid. No one would have liked it. Hermione would have hit him if she had been there. Now, what was he going to do? What would Hermione do now? Maybe he should just wait for Draco to calm down and then apologize. Yes, that was what he was going to do. In the meantime, he could as well go and take a stroll. Or maybe he should go to Mione? Why was he so fucking stupid?
Also...
He grasped Draco’s shoulder and moved it a bit. Draco. The pale white eyelashes fluttered and Harry stared.
He stayed where he was, too flabbergasted to think about his classes. He had fucked up regally. He was such a stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Draco was terribly offended and he’d probably never talk to him again. What a fool had he been! What was he expecting, for Draco to smile and thank him? No way would anyone ever do that. And less than anyone Draco Malfoy. For fuck’s sake, the man had a pride! And an enormous one! Idiot, idiot, idiot! What was he going to do now? Well, there was nothing he could do right now. Maybe he would ask Hermione later.
Harry knew he had fucked up so he just nodded silently and trailed behind Draco as he ambled to the desk.
Harry was staring at him with those green lights he had for fucking eyes and Draco realized he was waiting for an answer. He nodded, unable to look away from the pools of liquid emerald that were Harry’s eyes.
) Harry said quietly, glancing anywhere but at Draco.
“Harry… Please, Harry…”
Harry sat in front of Ron and coughed for them to look at him.
anyways
“W-W-What?”
When Draco had satiated his hunger for the first time in weeks he lay back in his cape, dreamily looking to the cloud passing rapidly on the sky. He sensed movement and turned to see Harry lying next to him with his arms under his head, absentmindedly watching the clouds. Draco blinked and returned to look at the sky until he heard Harry’s respiration changing its rhythm and he saw Harry had fallen asleep.
“Hi.” Harry answered, looking like he was to stroke Draco’s cheek but then Draco remembered where they were and stepped back, motioning for Harry to give him the bottle. He drank the rest of the sample and felt like he was falling into sleep very rapidly, at the same time that a numbness took over him.
He felt a little empty though. Yes, he was just himself, but there was no one else (
The last thing Draco saw was a close up of Maggie’s fist, and then everything went dark. Again.
Harry's quick pov of the whole thing and some memories of him growing up bi.
“Who said that I’m into girls anyway?”
“Draco!”
“Don’t you like it, Draco?” The girl was talking with a million voices, fragments of stories that Draco knew too well. The fountain started spitting blood and the butterflies became ashes falling from the sky.
“You seemed to be having a nightmare, you know, thrashing around and making these little noises…”
When he was sure they wouldn’t be heard, Draco confronted Harry.
The little girl turned slowly to reveal a brutally injured face. As Draco recoiled from the wondrous sight, the girl opened her hands and exposed an eye, semi rotten and looking like it had been taken from the ground. The cry in Draco’s throat died as he looked around to see everything in the garden wither and die, and the children’s clothes stain with blood as their skin opened with wounds and gashes.
“Better?” Harry asked after a while.
“You little…” Draco started as he good-humouredly punched Harry in one shoulder, continuing to fake fight until they reached the doors of the Great Hall, where they took a breath while checking their clothes for any sign of disarray.
“Do what?” Potter replied calmly.
. “Why can’t we start again?”
“What?”
“And you’re offering to help with my homework.” He said it not like an answer but as a statement. Draco nodded again, suddenly aware that Harry had nothing but his boxers on and that this made him desperately want a cold shower, even though that meant getting out of bed and walking by fucking Potter in his state, which was pretty unthinkable at the moment.
Draco was keening and pulling Harry’s hair, he wanted him.
When he got there, however, he noticed slight changes in the room that meant that the silver haired boy he had feared and missed in his way was in there.
Draco’s lids closed again and Harry heard him mumble “Po— Harryyy, why are you heeere?”
intimate.
Harry groaned as he stood, his five feet eight looking less in contrast to Draco’s six feet two. He didn’t stop complaining all their way to Potion class, even after Draco threatened to leave him on his own with Potions work.
“Potions, I reckon”
“Hi.”
Draco knew he was in a very very bad situation before he opened his eyes. As he did, he found himself in an almost unbearable heat, which would have been acceptable if it wasn’t for the way it seemed to start where Harry’s arm was draped over him and travel down to pool in his stomach. He was also very conscious he was enjoying the situation a little too much to be confident that he would get out undamaged from it. Draco was relieved that Harry was still asleep, at least from the way he was breathing over his head, a little breeze ruffling his hair. He stared at the space for a minute, just relishing in the way Harry’s skin felt against him, the peaceful calmness of them sleeping together, the way he felt waking from a night without nightmares. Draco tried to get out of Harry’s embrace without waking him and when he succeeded he half ran to the bathroom. As he emptied his bowels, he started to realize what had happened the last night and how he had ended in a situation like that. When he was finished, he hastily took a shower, regretfully washing away Harry’s scent from his body. After Draco relieved and refreshed himself he walked out of the bathroom to find a very dishevelled Harry blinking sleepily as he ran a hand through an already ruffled hair while he reached to Draco’s side table for a pair of glasses that were not there. Harry looked a little confused by this but then understanding bloomed in his face as he acknowledged last night’s events. He stood and walked to his own side table and put on his glasses, turning to look (
“No.” Draco was throwing a fit in his bed and he didn’t care at all, he hadn’t had enough sleep and that always made him grumpy as hell. This he explained to Harry, though with a more colourful language.
“Draco… Draco.” Harry took a step and kneeled in front of the tub.
sorry
“Come, Draco.” His Master bid him to move forward with no more than that. The man (
Draco couldn’t help but to notice Ron’s disdainful stare, though he focused on Hermione, since the girl seemed to be more curious than angry.
Draco shook his head, unable to look up and see what he intuited in Harry’s eyes as he felt his own eyes sting with tears barely contained.
“I’m just kidding you, Potter, it’s only that for me it’s bothersome to cut all the stuff in small pieces and you have a very steady pulse.” Draco tried to soften the joke with a praise for Harry, although he scolded himself for doing so.
blease, i thrive on comments, feedback and kudos
“Draco.” Fucking Potter took him by the shoulders firmly, making him look him in the eye. “I know you want to be strong but there are some battles you can’t win on your own. You think Slughorn was going to leave you alone after this? He doesn’t care if people bully you, he won’t move a fucking finger to help you!” Harry’s tone had increased as he talked. Now his voice was low, worried. “But now he knows I’m your friend. He won’t mess with you anymore.”
But this was the day. The D-day, as Draco called it in his mind. The day when they would assign each student a dorm and, with it, a roommate. Draco hoped he wouldn’t be assigned with a Gryffindor or, if he was being extra wishful, to be assigned with anyone at all.
There were still three meters until the door.
“My name!”
) and settling in and Draco had put all his little knickknacks in their proper places and Harry had hanged his last poster of the Chudley Cannons (
“Yes, ma’am.” He sat up, hurriedly stuffing the cloak in one of his pockets. “I’m sorry, ma’am.”
“So, any last words, snake?”
from this chapter on i'm not really betaed so sorry for mistakes.
Between the shock of being casted with Potter, his undignified escape from the Great Hall and the wondrous nightmare he had had last night, Draco wasn’t so happy when he woke to the banging Harry made in his morning ritual.
“It’s just. I don’t know. You saw it. In Potions. The People.” Harry’s eyes widened as he remembered and finally understood.
Even though he told himself this, Draco couldn’t control his sweat glandes, as he knew what the nightmare had in store for him.
Harry looked squeamish.
Harry seemed to wake from some distant dream.
Draco was shaking badly when he raised his hand to Harry’s face. He caressed lightly Harry’s lips and waited. Gradually, he saw as Harry started to breath and move a little. Then his eyes opened and Draco found himself staring into two abysmal pools of emerald. Harry recovered completely and smiled to Draco.
Draco let out a bitter chuckle. “Don’t worry about it, Potter? Seriously, that’s the best advice you can give? I can’t stop
“I’m sorry, I said I was going to wait you and now you find me asleep.” Draco’s heart soared as he saw the brightest of smiles illuminate sleepy Harry’s face with a happiness so pure and sincere he thought extinguished in this world.
“That’s because you just gobble down anything that appears in front of you, Potter.”
Hello yes I'm alive
Harry was not sleeping.
I want to slap them both. They're so stupid. Why can't they just be happy?
the computer where i was working on this died and i, like a fool, had not backed it up on the cloud (mistake i have already corrected and won't happen again)
“Let’s go.”
Draco sat beside Harry, flinching a little at Ron’s menacing air, which Harry seemed to purposefully ignore as he started eating (
… I d-don’t want t-to…
The lock on the barred door clanked as it opened from the outside.
“…you mind?”
Harry wasn’t surprised by this thought, having it constantly running in his head, though this was the very first time that it had been so clearly expressed.
He didn’t have any nightmares.
When his eyes adjusted, he found himself wanting to crawl back into the wardrobe and shut the doors.
The moonlight shone through the silky lace curtains, agitated by the early autumn breeze. There was a hearth facing the enormous windows and two seats that looked really comfortable by it. Draco advanced toward the centre of the room, slowly taking in his surroundings. It was beautiful, stunning even. There were draperies hanging from the walls, representing pretty scenes of beauty elves like the one who told about faerie tales, frolicking and dancing in the prairie. Between a passage showing a circle of faeries dancing around a fire that seemed alive and another that showed some cute little elven children listening to a storyteller, there was a staircase. Even if he wanted to stay all night up and slowly inspect every single thing in this lovely room, he knew he had to go to sleep. He turned to face Harry and found him watching him intently, his face semi hidden in the shadows. He looked like one of those Fae princes in the stories, who came to steal some pretty maiden’s heart without a second glance.
in the meanwhile, enjoy
Draco decided he would go, but as if it meant nothing to him who he got as roommate.
Harry had crossed the first chamber and now was standing in the middle of their bedroom and he couldn’t find Draco. He started to worry, he had seen clear signs of the other boy’s entrance but hadn’t seen him. What if he was wounded? What if someone had hurt him and he was dying? Harry started to frantically look around the room for clues, signals, anything that could tell him where was Draco when he finally turned to the bathroom door and found it ajar. He rushed into the room and almost fainted of relief when he saw the head of the guy lolling just above the water level. This guy. He debated if he should wake him up or let him be, especially with their relationship
1959-1996
Harry was confused. “What?”
*drops chapter and runs*
He ran his hand through soft auburn curls, and breathed in Charlie’s scent. Cinnamon and smoke, warm and comforting.
“Have a good night, Luna. I love you.”
But they slammed back into him at that moment. His mother and father, whom he had left. Had abandoned. His father was still on house arrest for another two years, he thought. His mother taking care of him, handling any family affairs.
Draco sighed as he heard Charlie’s voice fade out into the background as he walked to the other end of the house.
Because it had been five years now.
Harry sat at his small kitchen table, a mug of tea in his hands. There was another one set out for Charlie across the table too, but neither of them were drinking it. He put the cup to his lips, but the tea was already cold. He set it down.
He gave a couple of raps on the door. “Malfoy?”
Charlie turned around, face slightly twisted in thought. “I don’t know. Anywhere good around here, Harry?”
And so he sat. And he waited.
“Are they really that conceited that they can’t go that long without mentioning themselves?”
“I know enough. He’ll love you, I promise.”
He set out the food and sat across from Justin, and the two ate silently until Harry cleared his throat to break the silence.
were sitting outside the café with paper cups of tea between their hands.
“No you don’t, Malfoy.”
Harry sighed and shook his head. “I’ll see you in the morning, Charlie. Good night.”
Charlie was still snoring softly across from him, so he disentangled his arm from the other man and padded to the bathroom.
“You’ve been working on it for weeks, I’m sure it could wait one more day,” he whispered into the younger man’s collarbone.
Draco stared blankly at the gravestones for awhile longer before speaking again.
Harry was sat at his dining room table. And Draco Malfoy was sitting across from him, picking at the peas on his plate. They had barely said anything to each other since he had come back to the house, and Harry was grateful that Charlie hadn’t made them. Harry was fine with the silence, but it was probably polite to say something.
“Draco, darling. Talk to me.”
Charlie sighed, and shifted his head from Draco’s arm to burrow into his chest. “Then what do you want to do?” His tone was mostly concerned, but Draco detected a hint of something else in it, and when Charlie’s teeth ghosted across his collarbone, he understood what.
But he had just seen the bastard for the first time in five years, and he was going to live with him.
In fact, those kinds of things about her were what Harry loved most about being her friend. A lot of people back in school had assumed she was crazy, but she was one of the most intelligent people that Harry had ever met. And if you were looking for a straight up answer, Luna was the person to go to. She was refreshingly honest, and while her lack of a filter was off putting for some, Harry absolutely adored her.
“So, what have you been up to these days, Malfoy?”
Salazar’s left tit.
“Ok, that sentence means almost nothing to me, Harry. So how do you two know each other, and why did he throw up on the sidewalk when he saw you?”
“What? You’re not bringing him back here!”
“I do this and that, you know.” He was aware that was pretty obvious code for unemployment, but he wasn’t going to outright say it, and Malfoy made no comment.
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up across his face. “It is?”
“Malfoy, you’re not making sense.”
Malfoy was snapping in his face, and Harry realized he had definitely been staring too long.
Being here was the last thing he wanted to do, so he let the world black out around him, only allowing the occasional sentence to break through his consciousness.
That was, until his name got pulled into the conversation.
Justin stood in front of him, seeming equally confused, still wearing last night's clothes, his light brown curls just starting to dry, and lightly smelling of the shampoo Harry kept in the guest bathrooms.
“Well...I may or may not be bringing a friend with me, and I’m not so sure the Burrow is the best place for him to stay, it’s a little suffocating, you know?”
“You shouldn’t still love me, you know.”
“I’m sorry. That’s…always difficult.”
“Would you like to see your cousins’ graves?”
Draco nodded, and took Charlie’s hand, listening to their footsteps on the grey sidewalk.
This could not be possible.
“I don’t see why sometimes.”
“That’s more than enough time,” he whispered against Charlie’s neck. He smiled as the taller man shuddered before pulling back again.
Harry sat in his kitchen, wondering if maybe he had gone a little bit too far.
And now he was bound to not only two weeks of living with Malfoy, but also two weeks of celibacy. Unless he managed to get to someone else’s house, though he didn’t want the endless gaggle of Weasleys to worry if Malfoy let it slip that he didn’t come back home one night.
“They’ll get to the Ministry at three, and I think they’re exploring the city a little before they get here. Charlie’s staying with me tonight so he doesn’t have to be surrounded by the chaos of the Burrow while everyone else is settling in.”
Harry stayed silent. He didn’t want to do this right now. He had been expecting a nice, normal stranger. Not fucking Malfoy. And now everything was all much more dramatic than he was expecting.
“I’m fine right where I am. Have fun with your family, I’ll be here when you get back.”
“Oh, and Draco?” Charlie called out. Malfoy turned back towards him.
Draco smiled against warm, salty skin and signed. “Yeah, I think so.”
Luna was right. Harry knew she was right, he didn’t think he could remember a time when she wasn’t right.
“Harry, I said it’s fine. Really, you’re not hurting my feelings or anything like that. Look, I’m just going to take a quick shower and head home.”
Draco snapped his head towards the man, tears threatening to fill his eyes again. “Don’t you understand, Charlie? I’m a horrible person. Who doesn’t deserve someone like you. I never have.”
But this morning he seemed to be a completely different person. His hair was mussed, wavy and sticking out in odd directions in a couple places, and there were small bags under his icy grey eyes. He was clothed in just a loose Weird Sisters t-shirt (really?) and a pair of flannel pajama pants. This outfit did nothing to hide his pretty lean and muscular frame, and it certainly did nothing to hide his scars.
“Then fuck him. I like you, and that’s all that matters.”
“Oh don’t pretend we haven’t done worse.”
“You’re not a father, Draco!”
But…nevertheless. He seemed to be upset, and maybe, probably not, but maybe, Harry didn’t know the whole story.
“You know, Harry always says that the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters. We’ve all got light and dark inside us. I think your cousin told him that; his godfather. Did you know him?”
“Now his house is Fideliused, so you won’t be able to see it until I tell you where it is. So you should know that the address of the house is number 12 Grimmauld Place.”
Harry felt like he should stay, anyway.
Charlie wrapped Draco up in his arms and kissed his forehead, looking him in the eyes. “Good. You need it, dragon. Take care of yourself for me, ok?”
Harry spoke in a small voice. “He threw you in a room with Greyback?”
“Bloody right it will. Honestly, Charlie was being pretty smart having his boyfriend stay here instead of in the lion’s den.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Well, neither Sirius nor Regulus had bodies to bury, so they have gravestones out in the yard. Well, Regulus does have a place in the Black family plot up north, too; but I thought he’d like to be with his brother. There are also a couple of your other relatives out there, though not ones you would know.”
Harry stepped offstage and let out a heavy sigh, letting his mask drop a little, even though the voices were still booming and the cameras were still flashing around him.
“Yes, like I said, long st-“
Harry still looked down at his own lap, ashamed. “That’s not what I meant. He- he locked his own son in a room with Greyback?”
“You’re insufferable.”
But Charlie had always been concerned about how Draco froze up whenever the subject was breached, refused to talk about anything that had happened to him or those around him during those terrible 3 years.
“What? I’ll get to know him while he’s here!”
“Oh frog bollocks, he does get off his shift soon. I have to go, but you’re still an idiot, Harry!” she yelled as she rushed out of the room. “Have a good evening, send all my love to Charlie and his mystery man!”
“I’m not going to the memorial, Charlie. Do you know what an uproar I’d cause at the Weasley household?”
Weasley gave a speech. About something. Draco really held onto no details in his mind past that. Granger was next, she spoke about a couple of people who had passed during the war.
And so he didn’t push him off, he didn’t pull his wand at him. He just let him cry, and held him closer.
Charlie sighed. “We’ve never addressed it before, Draco; but we both know what day is coming up.”
“I grew up privileged. I know that. I know that even better than you do. My childhood was filled with things that most people don’t even dream of having, but it didn’t make up for it.”
Charlie understood this, knew when Draco needed to be brought back to earth and when he just needed time, so he left him alone.
God, his life was a headache.
“Draco...I know you hate talking about it, but…”
“It was, uh, nice seeing you.”
“Oh. Yeah. Well…see you.”
Harry didn’t offer him a change of clothes. It felt a step too far.
He wondered if the visions of piled up dead bodies would haunt him when he walked in the door.
“I’ve never met Andromeda.”
“Yes, it’s fascinating work. What do you do nowadays?”
“Your name is literally dragon?” he had asked, and Draco had smiled and listened to him launch into a conversation about his career working with dragons up close, which was really quite interesting. Draco had talked a little bit about his apprenticeship and wandmaking, and Charlie had listened intently.
“Sorry, Justin. Go back to sleep, I’ll take this call.”
“Draco….I was wondering if you’d like to visit your family.”
“You know, it didn’t make up for it.”
He glared at Harry with fire in his eyes, but his voice remained calm.
His eating disorder had been one of the things that had driven Draco out of the country. At eighteen years old he hadn’t only tried to kill himself, but he hadn’t been eating before that either.
Charlie yawned and nuzzled deeper into Draco’s embrace. “No, but you’re so bloody pensive I won’t get back to sleep. What’s wrong?”
“Charlie, why are you calling me this early in the morning?”
“I don’t want to be.” He was clearly avoiding the question, and he hoped Potter would take a hint.
Draco was just about to bite out another argument when Charlie’s words sank in. He did a bit of a double take. Charlie was a kind man through and through, but he was a stubborn one, and Draco had expected him to put up more of a fight than that. Not that he was complaining.
“So you haven’t heard from him since sixth year?”
Charlie placed a hand to his forehead, squeezed his eyes shut and rubbed his temples.
Draco turned towards the other man, concerned. “What is it?”
Charlie looked at his foster brother wearily. “And what do you suggest, Harry? Do you have a better idea? I’m not leaving him out on the street. He needs a roof over his head, and this is a perfectly good one. I’m sure you can manage not to attack him if he’s staying here, it’s a big house.”
That was when he heard the shower turn on in the bathroom across the hall.
But he did. And boy did the universe get him back for that.
Draco had been 19 years old, wide eyed and scared. The first week of his apprenticeship with young Romanian wandmaker; Anastasia Cristea, recommended by Ollivander himself, was quite frankly, not going well. It wasn’t that she was unkind, Draco was just terrified, and it was affecting his magic. He couldn’t contain it, and if he couldn’t even go a day without accidentally sending crates of wands flying across the room, he certainly couldn’t hone his magic precisely enough for wandmaking. Cristea was patient with him, but he was not as patient with himself, and it put quite a damper on his mood.
Whatever did Potter do with his time? He really didn’t have much information to be honest, and now that he thought about it, he was kind of curious.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck. “Er, yeah. We were-“
“I think it’s a lovely mug!”
“I don’t think anyone is truly horrible. And I don’t think horrible people are immune to change. I’ve seen you grow into the man you are up close and personal, and I’m proud of you. That can’t have been easy.”
Romania had done him good, but things like these didn’t just go away. He was no longer emaciated and on the brink of death, but there were bad days, and bad weeks where he struggled, and his eating habits weren’t exactly normal.
Harry smiled a tight, but hopefully convincing smile. He didn’t really feel like socializing, but these were the people he knew best, and it would still be a nice time.
“Why did you want to leave your aunt and uncle?”
“I think we need to talk, Malfoy.”
Luna handed him a bag of loose leaf tea that he knew was spiked with dried Calming Draught; not that he didn’t appreciate it, and gave him a soft embrace.
“Charlie, you’re dating Draco Malfoy!”
“You absolute idiot, Harold! You should have at the very least gotten his name before he stays in your house for two weeks!”
“A werewolf? No. He’s just a little allergic to silver and gets feverish around fulls, but it could be much worse.”
“Charlie-“
Charlie cleared his throat and scanned his eyes across the table, gaze landing on Malfoy.
“I will literally buy you any mug you want myself as long as it’s not that one.”
Charlie sighed and placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco pushed it off.
“Theodore? You were in my year at Hogwarts, right?”
He tasted like scotch and cinnamon, and touching him sent sparks flying down Harry’s spine.
Harry, again, knew she was right. But refusing to go to a mind healer was practically tradition by now. Over the years he had managed to pack his trauma away to a manageable level, and while he knew letting the wound scab over wasn’t the same as letting it heal, he couldn’t bring himself to open the floodgates to all of that pain.
Harry sighed, rubbing his temples. “Yes, Luna. I know. Look, I really don’t want to talk about Malfoy. Can we do, you know, anything else?
Wow, I’m really fucking sorry y’all. I know it’s been awhile but I’m severely mentally ill, but I promise that this fic will not get abandoned, it’s just going to take a while. I was going to try to get to 20,000 words with this chapter but I decided y’all would rather I get a chapter out than wait longer so I can agonize over getting 500 more words in. Enjoy!
Charlie walked over and ruffled his hair playfully. “Git.”
After they had all received the pieces around their necks, Weasley stepped forward next, Potter and Granger watching from the side.
Harry woke up in a sour mood. Charlie and Malfoy had apparently forgotten the use of silencing charms last night, and that really wasn’t something he had wanted to be kept awake by.
Hermione had suggested he help charities and good causes with all the money he had when they were eighteen, but he had been shell shocked and severely depressed at the time, so she had handled his finances for the last four years, and while a good amount of his money went towards charitable causes, he still had ridiculous amounts of expendable income, and he already owned Grimmauld Place, and countless other Black family properties.
Draco Malfoy came padding down the stairs.
He really, really, didn’t want to be the brooding, sulking “nobody understands me” type, especially during his adult life; because that kind of behavior wasn’t really acceptable past 20 or so, but it was especially hard when he was quite literally the only one who had ever been through what he did.
He had a scar on his neck from a bit of rubble that had hit him and a burn scar on his wrist from the Fiendfyre. The only thing he had to show for that devastating spell, that had cost a life and nearly cost several more.
He tried not to link his actions directly to Frederick’s death. He was sure his twisted little brain could find a way, some way that he had caused it, but doing that wouldn’t bring the man back.
“Come on, Draco. You have to get up. This is what we came here for.”
“No, but the fact that you just said that tells me you have one.”
He had stopped answering their letters over two years ago. Eventually they had stopped writing them.
“-I want you to come with me.”
“Draco, you’re getting ahead of yourself. This situation isn’t ideal, but I think it’s better if we work it out. I'm not planning on kicking you out of my life, and I definitely can’t make you leave your own flat. Look, you can’t stay in this park, so why don’t we just go back to the house for tonight?”
“I want my boyfriend to stay at Grimmauld Place while I’m there.”
Harry looked over at Malfoy softly, and held out his hand. An offer. A gesture. An olive branch, of a bit of kindness, hesitant, yet genuine. “That’s ok. I can tell you about them.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure. You’ve been nothing but kind to everyone you’ve met in Romania. Most people I know haven’t even achieved that, but you just seem to get along with everyone.”
He pushed Theo against his bedroom wall with a thump, kissing him hard and trying not to think about the fact that this was his godfather's bedroom, as always.
“You’re right. You shouldn’t have.”
“I didn’t think to ask, ok Mione? Jesus, shouldn’t you be picking up your husband?”
He wondered how quickly he could get an international portkey. If he had brought enough money for a motel. How quickly he’d be able to pack up his flat in Romania when Charlie inevitably demanded that he leave the country entirely. He couldn’t say he wasn’t inclined to do so himself. He couldn’t stand to be around Charlie when he hated him. It would hurt too much.
Harry didn’t know what on earth possessed him to cross to the other side of the bed. He wasn't sure what spirit enticed him to reach out for Malfoy’s shoulder, and there didn’t seem to be anyone around to blame when he hugged him.
Draco sighed, leaning his head against Charlie’s chest. “You don’t know everything about me.”
“No, but he’s not yelling anymore. Progress.”
He sat down on the emerald green coverlet and looked around the room. God, there really was a lot of green decor, with any luck Charlie’s boyfriend would be a former Slytherin.
He froze momentarily, not prepared for that question. “Uh, not that much, actually.”
“Yeah, he is. Apparently he and Charlie have been dating for awhile, so he brought him home for this. They’ll be here for about another week, I think.”
CW for mention of past self harm, suicide attempt, and violence
It was a bad idea to accept the olive branch Charlie was holding out. It would be so easy for him to yank it back when the other foot dropped. When it got to be too much. But it was tempting. It was so tempting to go back and be comforted by Charlie, and to be told it was ok, even if it wasn’t.
“Hey, I wouldn’t want to be in contact with Lucius Malfoy, either.” This drew a small chuckle from Draco, glad there was something he could see eye to eye with Potter on.
Charlie looked Harry in the eyes and reached out to hold his foster brother’s hand, and squeeze it gently.
He stumbled off the steps backwards, threw up on the pavement, and ran.
And in what seemed like a blink of an eye, they
“I just…get heated around the topic of my childhood. I blow up at people, more than I should, and I just end up hurting them and why am I telling you this? Point is, I’m sorry.”
But for now, he had him. He still needed him. And that was all he could ask for, really.
Harry took cautious steps toward the bed, and sat down gently on the edge, as far away from the shaking body as he could possibly muster. Malfoy didn’t protest.
Fuck, nobody but his friends even knew about his sexuality, though he didn’t really think it was the Prophet’s business who he slept with. Skeeter might think so, but he didn’t.
“Oh. I’m sorry. That must have been hard.”
“Yes. You know Sirius was my godfather, right? He left me this house, along with several others, and the Black inheritance.”
Damn.
And really, truly, this wasn’t how he was expecting this day to go. It left him feeling tired, oddly hollow, and empty. He wanted a drink, or to go to sleep, but it was only seven.
Theo smiled gently and his eyes sparked.
Harry had never wondered what Malfoy looked like when he was alone, relaxed, more raw and comfortable. For a while he probably would have told you that Draco Malfoy didn’t exist in such a state. He was always perfect. Clothes always crisp and ironed, buttoned up, shoes shined and tied tight, hair gathered perfectly. At least he had grown out of the gel phase around sixth year, that was pretty horrendous.
He knew that Charlie was curious. Was worried, and wanted to know what had happened to make him stop answering the letters. To never talk about them. He probably wanted to know what woke Draco up gasping for air, face contorted in silent screams in the middle of the night. But Draco didn’t talk about it. Wouldn’t talk about it. He had forced himself to move on a long time ago. He had pushed forward without stopping to stitch himself back together, and it had hurt. But the wounds had scarred over so thick that he couldn’t let anyone in enough to hurt him.
Draco just rolled his eyes and at the same time, pushed his finger into Harry’s mouth and undid Harry’s fly with the other. “Shhh, love.” Draco whispered,
Harry shook his head, unsure of what he could say because he really didn’t know
Draco transformed back his mug, indignantly, but the tea tasted much more...earthy now and he put it down in defeat. “Why do you even care? Why tell me this?”
“Okay Potter, you’re up.” Announced Seamus, seemingly pleased at how chaotic things were already.
“I meant it...” Harry whispered in between kisses, “that I don’t want this to be...purely-“ Draco bit at his bottom lip. “Physical” Harry whispered, tightening his hold on Draco’s waist. “And I don’t...” Harry broke away from Draco’s lips, pressing a deep kiss right behind his jaw, below Draco’s ear. “You know I want to fuck you more than anything.” He felt Draco’s grin vibrate through his skin.
me for not having self worth. I’m here to remind you that we
Draco watched him pace, feeling the rage radiate off of him. He wouldn’t lie, it was felt good to have someone one his side, not just someone his
Draco hissed. Harry just pulled Draco back to him, one strong hand securely around Draco’s back and the other cradled protectively around his head.
Harry leaned down, coaxing Draco’s head out enough to kiss him. Much more chaste but not less powerful than before. “I love you too.”
As they walked down the stairs, Draco saw Weaslette already waiting for him. Great. Without a word, Draco exited the common room. Which just left Harry and Ginny. Harry descended the lasts of the steps and stood before Ginny who was standing near the fire place.
could be continuously drawn to him, Draco, it really did make him feel like maybe he’s not so monstrous.
“Well?” Harry whispered, his voice deeper in an effort to keep quiet.
“I don’t know why everyone has such a great vision of me” Harry whispered into Draco’s hair. “I have a temper. I’ve messed up loads of times. Being a war hero doesn’t mean I’m a great person. Just means I’m stubborn, which can be a terrible quality. I don’t trust people, I don’t talk about my feelings, except for this apparently. Ginny and I make a great picture. The Chosen One marrying his best friend’s sister, he finally gets a family, and all that. Or, you know a ‘official’ one. But I’m not interested in making a pretty picture. Or even dating one, even though you
“I swear if you pick me up I will hex you” Draco hissed, shrugging the hand off.
“Dare” the ginger answered confidently, crossing his arms.
“Since third year, huh?”
“Everyone knows you have it.”
Potter laughed, licking up Draco’s length which caused the blonde to shiver. “We’ve talked about this, love. When I’m about to be inside you-“ he sucked on the tip a little, “call me Harry.” Sure, they had talked about that, but they definitely hadn’t talked about how Harry just called him love. Draco’s heart, and cock admittedly, swelled at that. He wasn’t even sure if Harry noticed it.
. He chided himself,
Harry, but another part of him would miss the rivalry.
“Harry” Draco repeated, firmer this time to try and call him back to reality. “It was a long time ago. They don’t hurt I...” he cut off because he couldn’t exactly say it was okay, because it had been one of the scariest moments of Draco’s life, which was an accomplishment to achieve.
Draco just stood there, trying his hardest not to shake, or at least let on that he was shaking before this was just...
” insisted Malfoy, knowing using his name would get Harry’s attention, “just go back first. I’ll go after. It’s not like we don’t share a room anyway.”
Harry smirked against Draco’s mouth, mouth parting willingly for Draco, letting Draco take what he wanted for a while. It was when Harry pulled his hair, which caused Draco so let out a soft moan that Harry took control. He changed the angle of their kiss, tongue teasing through and basically fucking Malfoy’s mouth which shouldn’t be
. Ah, well a quiet night in with some tea. A new novelty honestly, Draco would be okay with that.
. Is what he meant and only hoped the brunette would get the message. Potter may be he chosen one but that wouldn’t save him from getting expelled if he killed someone.
“Maybe that’s it.” Harry whispered, lifting his head up and stared blankly at the space in front of him. “I’m mourning what could have-
” she continued, giving them all a pointed look before continuing, “you’ll also notice that there are five tables instead of four this year. That is because all the eighth years will form together as one house this year. Now, I’m not saying that Gryffindor’s will cease to be Gryffindor’s nor Ravenclaws Ravenclaw’s. You’ll still be a part of your houses, only in your final year at Hogwarts we want you to focus on seeing past the House structure in preparation for the real world. As there is no House Cup in the real world. 8th years will reside in their own dorm together. As there are significantly less either years than let’s say all of Hufflepuff, I do believe you’ll find this comfortable. The dormitories for either years are arranged mostly into singles, with some suites of multiple beds, though each will have their own room within that suite.”
Harry put his hand on Draco’s squeezing it, “I did mean for tonight to be more...” he interlaced his fingers with Draco’s and pulled his hand off of his arm. “I’m not sorry, or anything before you say anything like that I just...I’m not good with...emotions.” Harry finished slowly, looking up to find Draco’s eyes watching him intently.
Cloak of Invisibility carefully secured around Draco, he descended the stairs. Thankfully, he had gotten here rather promptly and at a time when students were normally in the quad or Great Hall or Library. Again, Draco realized how suspicious he looked. If he was caught, Draco would absolutely be on a one way ticket to join his father.
“Why are you- we aren’t
“I want to worship you” Harry whispered in Draco’s collar bone before biting, looking up at Draco after. “I want this to be for you tonight.”
“Why weren’t you at the feast?” Harry called, not knowing
“No” Harry responded immediately, looping his thumbs through the band on Draco’s pants.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, suddenly aware of the fact that although they were both fully clothed, Draco felt horribly, horribly exposed. Harry seemed to sense that discomfort, leaning down to kiss Draco who responded willingly. After a moment, Harry pulled back again. “Let me make you feel good.” He whispered again and this time Draco just nodded, not sure exactly what he was agreeing to but it felt bigger than just a sexual act.
“They do little else” countered, Harry. “And I don’t care-“
the image of lust blown Harry waiting, eagerly between his legs almost made him come right there. “You-you really don’t have to-“
year for his many nights up here was still here.
“I’m not...I’m not a very open person, about myself at least. I think I can at least admit that now but I...I don’t know, I think it helps to talk to someone..I don’t know how to phrase this-“
Harry considered protesting against Draco but decided to just enjoy the peace.  “Goodnight, Draco.” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s temple.
The stretch was incredible. Draco bit his lip to stop himself from groaning in pain. Harry had prepared him, but there was still a size discrepancy between fingers and what was currently working its way between Draco’s legs. He let out a breath, stopping halfway.
.  The silky black contrasted perfectly with Draco’s pale skin and Harry was overcome with the urge to-
“Yes” came a husky reply, so drenched in desire that Draco almost didn’t recognize the voice as Harry’s. Well okay then.
Draco yelled, the question seeming to get ahead of his filters.
