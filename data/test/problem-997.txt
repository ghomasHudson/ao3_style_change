Yes, I've been accepted to 5 different muggle universities with top notch psychology programs. I've also been granted the St. Mungo's apprenticeship for mind healing and plan to do both concurrently with hopes of marrying the 2 in a completely revolutionary form of mind healing.
" she sobbed into his chest. He swallowed down the lump in his own throat. "I knew it... I just
His tone was urgent but calming and Draco nearly melted at the sound of the warm diminutive. Ok, maybe Harry didn't
"Me too, Hermione," he beamed back and he was surprised when he felt the lump in his throat. "I really am."
Harry stared back and there was warmth and tenderness there.
"You know, I dream about that night all the time? The sunset?"
"Yes?"
"What is it mate?"
"Harry?" Ron's face contorted in a bizarre mixture of confusion and disgust.

"Auror Extraordinaire, huh?" He smirked when he reached him.

"Good one, Draco!"

," he said again, this time pointing to the blonde man standing by the fountain chatting with a woman that Harry was pretty sure worked in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. He already looked all the part of the aristocratic businessman, his tailored robes a stark difference from the brown ones he'd worn here just 10 days ago.
Harry nodded, "But it's going to be even more of a media shiteshow now then it already would have been..."
The Sebastian he knew wasn't a threat. In fact, the biggest reason Draco found it hard to take the man seriously was because he was just like every other man that was too enthralled with him for whatever superficial reason that made him the desire of their fantasized conquest: easy to manipulate. It was amazing what men would do to in an attempt to have some claim to his beauty or riches or power or fame. Tell them no and they beg. Tell them what to do and they jump. Put them in their place when they act tough and they're putty in your hands. Draco knew the type and Sebastian was the type. Perhaps it was because the one man he'd ever loved was only ever impressed by whether or not he was being a good person and had never been afraid to call him on his shite, but Draco found Sebastian's type to be quite boring in its predictability. But kidnapping? Extortion? Endangering little old ladies? So much for predictable!
They reluctantly came forward, still half hidden behind Walden.
"What?!" Harry asked, startled and blood rushing to his cheeks.
"Ahh! Don't point that laser stick at me!" He got up and backed away towards the edge of hall. "I don't know what kind of weird, freaky deaky cult shite this is," he looked down at his robes, "but I've got to get home!" He threw his own wand on the floor to a chorus of gasps and then tossed off his robes to don jeans and a tshirt, instead.
ceremony.
They all looked out at the scene before them. Harry and Draco were arguing in the middle of George and Angelina's flat while Ginny and Luna sat curled up on the couch near the fire playing with the pigmy puffs they'd gifted each other and Neville and Hannah danced around the room to the Christmas stylings of Celestina Warbeck.
"You're starting to become a bad omen, you know that?" he muttered, ruefully.
It was weird having this conversation with Malfoy. They were actually revealing vulnerable things about themselves.
Draco took a deep breath and braced himself as Harry let go of his hand to knock on the door. A few beats passed before the door swung open to reveal a genial looking woman whom he remembered being at the head the throng of red-headed children during trips to Diagon Alley before each Hogwarts start of term.
"Alright, alright, don't get your knickers in a bunch." He thought for a moment about how best to explain the three weeks of nonstop drugs, drinking, and sex that followed his acquittal. "Let's just say I had quite the self-destructive streak after my release from Azkaban. I had a plan to get pissed and be buggered by as many muggle blokes as possible just as a big screw you to my dear father." He laughed darkly.
Harry sighed.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "There's nothing to talk about."
"The other way that you can help is by supporting me in embracing Draco." He looked to Ron and Ginny. "He's actually really important to me for a number of reasons and the more people I have on our side who help break the stigma of him as an evil death eater, the better."
have a few minutes before they send them after you."
The house elf stood there bouncing, excitedly, a foot from where Harry lay in Draco's childhood bed. The bedroom, a time capsuled ode to the young boy that Harry had known, was filled to the brink with green and silver decor, pictures from Draco's time at Hogwarts, moving posters of fit, long-retired quidditch players that littered the walls, and a closet full of expensive, posh, preppy clothes. They both wore pairs of his old pajamas that he'd transfigured to fit them now, but they were the smooth, soft, fine silk kind and Harry couldn't help wonder what type of 16- year-old boy would even have these? He snorted, answering his own question as he gazed at the man next to him whose long, flowing hair and pouty lip made him look all the part of a spoiled prince. He zipped his mouth shut at the look Draco gave him.
"Oh!" Harry jumped. "Yes! I hate to miss the feast but yea, I've got to get going!" He made a show of shouting over the crowd: "Ron! I've got to go, make sure to save me some pumpkin pasties!"
He looked up to see over a dozen red jets of light and, veiled among them, one
" He shook his head, exasperated at the memory.
Harry shook his head sceptically.

Their magic buzzed and mingled in a way that Draco had never felt and his own breathing hitched as he picked up the pace.
"I am
He shook his head and then took out his wand to cast a disillusionment charm on himself before walking back out of the door.
"Severus, at the time I found out that my father...." He paused and shook his head. "I thought you would've already known. The things Yaxley and Rowle said that day made it sound like torture and rape were a regular death eater practice... And I was just so disturbed and things started to make sense that I'd never understood before... Like why my father always seemed uncomfortable having me around his friends and would tell me that he didn't want me alone with them... When I was younger, I thought that it was because he thought I was too young to be in on the important talks but when I witnessed what they did to Harry I knew that he simply didn't trust them around his teenage son."
"Ron... Me and Gin haven't been good in years..." He swallowed thickly. "You know its hard for me to talk about that kind of stuff..."
"Potter, that makes no--"
(See the end of the chapter for
is a pretty powerful spell, how did that even work without having the proper wand?"
"Like that one split second decision to partner up with the prat instead of leaving him out to dry that day could've potentially changed the whole course of your life as you know it!"
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna, Seamus, Dean, Parvati, Padma, Ernie and Hannah all raised their hands. There was a hush across room. "Ladies and gentlemen, Dumbledore's Army." There were more applause as his friends gave curt bows of their heads and Luna gave a pageant wave. He smiled at her before continuing.
Harry glanced up at him as he began stirring. "How do you even know all of this? What, did your godfather get you a potions set as a baby or something?"
"Nah, mate. I'm pretty sure my conscious would be light as a feather right now. Probably lighter than it currently is, even..." He watched a spider crawl up the stone wall next to him and Harry was surprised when he didn't even flinch as it neared him. For the first time, Harry started to wonder if Ron might feel numb, too. "It's hard to feel like you've done enough when you do all this fighting the good fight and shite like that still happens to your best mate, the woman you love still gets tortured, and Fred still dies in the end." A tear rolled down his face and he didn't try to stop it. "At least maybe if I'd have killed them, I'd feel like I'd got
"Yes, Teddy, I'll play all the fun games he wants me to." Harry laughed and discretely reached round to squeeze Draco's bum.

he yelled.
fucked up on so many levels, mate. And like Ginny said, to have had to deal with that while saving the fucking world." He shook his head and then looked back at him. "You do realize that what happened in the diner when we ran into Rowle and the ministry with Yaxley would have looked very different had I known, right?"
"What do you want to taste, Harry?"
"Because we both know that if I go through the front, I can get a better gauge of what's going on in the rest of the house."
"Yes, teenager." He returned a wry smile. "I was wondering if you could track the floo usage from my residence on Monday morning? I'd just like to make sure that wherever he's been off to is safe, you see?"
"He's 3! No, dear, if you really want to be there for Teddy then he needs family. How about you just stop by for Christmas instead of getting him luxury toddler gifts?" She shook her head exasperatedly but there was a smile playing on her lips.
"Nothing good, most like, because it looks like ol' dad was very opposed to Sebastian joining the wizarding world and he even protested his acceptance into Durmstrang. An interview with the old headmaster revealed that shortly after the arrival of Sebastian's acceptance letter, his father marched to Durmstrang and begged him to rescind the offer, to tell his boy that there had been a mistake. The headmaster says that's the first and only time that's happened in all his time there but, when he asked why, Krafft senior apparently bumbled on about a mysterious string of dead and mutilated animals. Sheep and rabbits, mostly -- right around the time Sebastian turned 6."
Not even fifteen minutes went by before Draco returned, fully dressed in his posh clothes, hair in its perfect fishtail, and a cup of fresh-brewed coffee in each hand. Harry stared at him in awed disbelief when he carefully tiptoed around scattered parchments, handed him one of the cups, and gracefully lowered himself down beside him. He reached for a file.

Harry's heart was beating too fast. It couldn't be...

"Well, you are pretty damn fit... And I happen to find the quietly strategic and disruptive type not only brave, but also, incredibly sexy." Draco smiled lasciviously and Harry felt the heat rise to his cheeks as the heat increased between them.
"Hey!" Reynolds shouted as he turned onto the street. Draco aimed a jelly-legs jinx that left him scrambling to stand upright.

which subsequently made him want to roll his eyes at himself. "When things were getting really bad here last year, he adjusted the wards to only allow him and I access. He was in the headmaster's quarters and he knew I would be under scrutiny from both sides and wanted me to have a place to escape all the chaos." Harry raised an eyebrow. He had come to appreciate the complexity of Snape ever since viewing his memories but the idea of him being a doting, caring godfather just seemed unreal. At least it helped explain all the special treatment Malfoy got in potions over the years, he thought. "I'd come here to hide away or study."
Harry hovered nervously outside of the terraced home on the quaint little block on Elderberry Road. He'd taken the tube instead of apparating directly in the hopes that the nearly hour long ride from the ministry would give him time to think up

"And you'd better pray to Merlin that comes off with

"Of course not," Draco responded in a voice that was now Draco's, too.
Ok. He had to admit he was feeling stupider by the second. He made a conscious note that if he were going to be an idiot in the future, then he at least needed to use the other hand so that he could heal himself.
Draco shook his head.
Sebastian growled, running a hand roughly through his hair in frustration. "No. No! This is your fault, Potter!" He pointed at Harry abruptly, eyes wide as if something had just become apparent. "I thought it'd be enough to beat you but, apparently, the original lore is true."

Draco looked up at Potter nonplussed. What just happened?
He spoke a little louder so they could hear him when he spoke. "It's called

"Do you know how bloody hard it is to change direction mid-floo!" Ron marveled. "Fred and George did it once when they tried to sneak back home at the exact moment mum passed the fireplace on her way for a midnight nosh. Wound up all the way in Upper Flagley, they did!"
The bubbling panic was just starting to mingle unsettlingly with his hangover when more bits of the picture floated into place.
didn't happen!" Ron chuckled and shook his head in relief. "Now if only you and Gin would go ahead and have some kids like the rest of us."
"And, Mr. Malfoy, the wand has worked for you as it did before? Even without having to win it back?"
It was still in the planning stages and in need of some serious investors when they received an anonymous donation of 200,000 galleons! It was enough to turn what was initially going to be a small orphanage into a booming community with a focus on healing, mental health, and supportive connection. Harry saw it as no coincidence that the money came the same week that Draco was released from Azkaban. He thought that it might be some big, showy attempt to thank him for speaking on his behalf during his trial, veiled in the thin guise of anonymity because, of course, Draco didn't know how to do anything small. He couldn't be sure, though, and he didn't want to make too much of it if it were true. Throwing money at something wasn't hard when you had it in surplus and certainly didn't mean reform when you were already as rich and pandering as the Malfoys.
The woman turned to Draco, surprised by the shift in mood.
"When was she last here?" asked Potter.
Potter?!" Blaise rushed to the fireplace. "What on Earth is going on?! Please tell me you have
"We never told anyone
nodded her head towards the large booth to the left of the stage and the busboy stopped his clearing of the bar top to whistle at the odd arrangement of characters convened around it. On one side sat a group of posh ladies and gentlemen who looked overdressed in the too bright neon lighting of the karaoke bar while the other was made up of a plain, comparatively ragtag bunch. The table between them might as well have been a chasm the way they awkwardly stared across at each other with only the occasional terse, fake smile for niceties.
"Mother..." he said, gently. He approached her slowly and, when she didn't turn away, he reached out and took her hands in his. He bent to try to look her in the eyes, but she continued to look to the side. "Mother, I need you to know that Harry had nothing to do with me coming out or me ending my marriage. Neither did you. I know you wish that you had... but I just needed to live.
Draco had only begrudgingly accepted Harry's invitation because he couldn't think of a kind way to say
He looked back at Harry and all the thoughts of sitting out on the lake or going for drinks at the Three Broomsticks that he hadn't even realized he was fantasizing about began to dissolve.
"Ever since Yaxley and Rowle... did what they did..." He looked down at his trainers. How could he say this? "Me and Ginny never... I don't know if..... What if..." He swallowed and looked up into confused blue eyes. "Ron, how am I ever supposed to have sex after what they did to me?"
"It's just... I saw so many fucked up things happen these past two years... So many people hurt who didn't deserve it --" he choked and laid his head on his arms for a moment before he lifted his head and continued more firmly. "That didn't happen in France, it happened here! And it happened because of me! It happened because of my family and that stupid rhetoric we've been preaching for centuries!" He looked away angrily, a scowl curling his lips. "I just want to be able to help for a change. I want to figure out how to help people heal in the aftermath of all this."
Harry exhaled a loud sigh of relief. "Oh, thank God, mate!" He leaned in close and whispered. "I thought I was tripping my balls off! Do you know what in the bloody hell is going on? Or why everyone keeps calling me Harry?"
"And sometimes it's more straightforward. My godfather died in the war. He was a spy for the order and I'm so proud of all the things he did to protect me and others -- many of which will never be known to or acknowledged by most. But everyday I talk to his annoying arse portrait and whenever I'm home I pick his favorite flowers from my mother's garden for him. I take time to be grateful and proud of all the things he's contributed to my life or that I know because of him. It's all my way of reminding myself of his life and what he's done."
Draco finally put down the
Draco rolled his eyes and smirked but held on tightly as he disapparated again, landing in a small clearing across the way. The luminescent peacock was still shining bright like a beacon when they looked back and it wasn't long before Sebastian fell for the decoy; A slew of green jets rained from a spot to their right to effortlessly
The officiant nodded to Harry and he suddenly felt as if the words that Hermione had carefully helped him craft all those months ago, filled with lighthearted jokes about being quidditch rivals and Auror trainees, just wouldn't do. He swallowed.
Harry nodded and followed Ron down the spiral staircase and to the tapestry that hid the stairs that led to the ground floor. Instead of descending them, however, Ron sat down on the topmost step and Harry followed suit.
Thank you for reading and sticking with me through this storyline! I've got much in store for Harry and Draco in part two so be sure to subscribe to the series for updates!
"Oh? I'm sorry to hear that."
"It's Anavi! Anavi Chopra! But,
Draco felt his eyes begin to burn before the note was abruptly snatched out of his hands as Pansy examined it closely. He switched the little clasp on the front of the portable CD player and the lid lifted to reveal the silver disc spinning to a halt. He immediately recognized Harry's handwriting scrawled on it detailing which tracks contained various songs including some he already recognized as Spice Girls, Britney Spears, and Janet Jackson songs. He searched and found that song number 6 was one he'd never heard that read:
His heart clutched as he saw red hair stand out in the middle of the throng as a disheveled Ginny Potter-Soon-To-Be-Weasley-Maybe-One-Day-Zabini desperately searched in his direction. Harry numbly took off his baseball cap and Blaise, who looked exhausted and a little banged up himself, pointed in their direction. Ginny pushed away from Savage and Robards, who were holding her up, and ran full force, despite her limp, into his arms.
"That's exactly what she said you'd probably say." He leaned in and kissed Harry chastely. "She's a very sage woman, you know."
Grey eyes sparkled and reflected so much love and adoration as they gazed into green.
There was at least one
"I didn't want to love him, Harry. I just wanted something simple. Something different and exciting. But it was so much more than that."
Comments and feedback are welcome and appreciated :-)
"Aww!" He placed a mocking hand over his heart. "Were you actually concerned about me, Weasley? I'm touched!"
Harry's jaw dropped, indignantly. "But you think she'd poison
Her pause lingered and Harry watched as she swallowed, visibly, even as she spun.
I had so much fun writing this chapter lol. Hope you enjoyed!
"You can't let him get to you, Malfoy," he said without taking his eyes off of the task at hand. Draco had been briefly distracted, mesmerized even, when he realized that Potter had begun carefully, yet, wandlessly lifting out some of the more embedded shards before the words finally registered.
"Really? Never??"
without his voice cracking too much.
It was 9pm London time which meant he had been up well into the early morning back in Melbourne before Alexandra was finally able to get him a portkey. She'd also proven that she was, in fact, capable of miracles as she'd managed to get him on the calendar to meet with a witch from the Department of International Magical Cooperation at noon tomorrow. What he'd talk about? He had no clue. But he did know that, right now, he needed to get some rest.
"Harry... Harry, are you sure?"
Draco didn't remember walking to him. Maybe the wand caused him to float. All Draco remembered was standing over the man who had caused Harry so much pain, long before he'd killed him. The man who'd loomed as an ominous presence in the background of every happy moment he and Harry had even shared in these past six months. The man who had just taken away every happy moment they'd had yet to have... The man who had just doomed Draco to experience the worst pain imaginable for the rest of his miserable existence. Everything in Draco wanted to unleash the vast power bestowed upon him to destroy this man and he felt that power mixed with hatred roar in his ears, whirl in his chest as he lifted his wand, glare fixed on Sebastian Krafft.
"No dear, but we wanted to," Molly said, simply, with Arthur nodding at her side.
"Not yet, sweetheart." He removed the fingers that had been gently stretching him open and licked up the underside of Harry's straining cock, teasingly, once more. He dipped down to let his tongue tease at his hole briefly before pulling away. "I want to feel you when you cum."
"Potion or curse?" Harry asked while making a mental note to make sure he warned his mother-in-law.
"You're still so easy to rile up," he delighted, his smirk turning into a grin.
"Don't you ever fucking dare question whether or not that was our son," her voice cracked.
Harry was surprised when the typically shy kid stretched out his arms in a bid for Draco to hold him. Draco looked taken aback but he reached out to let the little boy clamber into his arms, all the same, softening as Teddy settled on his hip and pulled out his toy snitch from the pocket of his overalls to share with Draco.
Draco threw in more floo powder and the flames opened up into a dressing room where a number of people in glitter and sequins and wearing a shite ton of makeup and wigs were chatting merrily.
could be interpreted from the collection of libelous snippets?
are you getting at?"
His wand illuminated familiar dark green walls and mahogany floors and he searched, room by room, for any signs of intruder or struggle. When he was confident that the place was clear, he finally turned on the lights and sighed as he sunk unto the rich, leather couch.
Harry stiffened at the name and hoped they didn't notice.
"So, have you seen your parents yet?"
Granger-Weasley
"Well, there came a point where I kept blowing things up and crushing them when I was angry. The thing was, it wasn't that I would be talking to someone who was pissing me off and random things would start exploding uncontrollably -- as I think is the case for most accidental magic. Instead, it was more like I would be talking to someone and think 'I really want to punch this prick in the face' and, instead of doing it, I would focus on a lamp or vase and concentrate on it until
"Next thing I know, this place will be crawling with Potter's idiot Gryffindor friends. No respect --" He heard Snape muttering to himself as he closed the bedroom door.
"We found this stuff at Sebastian's sheep station and haven't been able to make heads or tails of it. Detailed information regarding yourself, your ex-wife, and Draco Malfoy."
"Who here, besides our professor, has seen Potter's stag patronus?" he asked the room at large. He raised his hand and slowly all of his classmates followed suit.
But she wouldn't budge. He screwed up his face in confusion and then: Something clicked. He felt as if the blood had suddenly drained from his body and his heart beat in his ears.
He had wrestled with his conscious for days before he had found a very Slytherin compromise: when Theo finally approached him, he very coolly said that he was tired of the drama and would be perfectly content to pass along the reigns to Theo. Draco knew that the thick headed boy's ego could not resist the opportunity for leadership and he was just slow enough that Draco didn't fear real danger coming of whatever half-baked schemes he might come up with. By doing this, he had essentially talked himself into a neutral position. It was a precarious position but if only he could stay quiet and not draw attention to the fact that he actually thought everything they stood for was bollocks now, at least until he could hopefully escape to uni, then both he and Lucius should be alright.
"He's not all bad, is he Harry?" She turned to him expectedly.
"Yup!" she said smugly.
"No, I'm pretty sure I could puke," he said sinking further into the cushions.
But then there was Potter... Despite all of his mental preparations to proactively avoid running into the man at all costs (including running through a list of all of his long forgotten evasive Auror maneuvers,
"Ah, yes! You know, I've learned a lot about myself since my time at Durmstrang. For instance, did you know that my family were among the trusted few of Grindelwald's inner circle? My great grands were among the folks who launched a movement! Incited a war! They were legendary. But, apparently, my grandfather didn't see it that way." He scowled and the bat collided with yet another vase. "With the fallout after the war, pa decided to reject anything to do with them and moved from Hungary to Australia. There, he married a muggle woman and raised my dad with the same airy fairy righteous nonsense about muggles being great and needing protection and fairness and bladdy-blah-blah." He stopped his circuit and screwed his face up in indignation. "It was that very crock of bullshit that allowed them to accept their lot in life as

"Oi! How dare you speak to Harry Potter, you death eater prick!" Davenport shouted with his wand pointed at Draco's chest. Harry's wand was immediately out and he was surprised when Malfoy didn't reach for his own.
around them.
"What do you want?"
"That plot twist wound up being the reason why the wand was never really able to work for Voldemort and how I was able to use it against him to defeat him." He smiled, triumphantly. "The wand refuses to harm its rightful owner, you see."
Harry swallowed as he realized that he really had put himself into another unnecessary, stupid situation because Malfoy really could take advantage of this situation. He didn't know why, but he really wanted to trust Draco.
had he met a wizard who, with the mess free, undetectable options of the
The Ministry was his first thought but that wouldn't be the first resort for Potter, not without having Draco bring the thief in with him. Robards would absolutely blame Draco for the separation and credit Harry with the capture if they didn't come in together. He could no longer deny that the man truly did seem to care about him, for whatever reason, and want him to succeed.
Harry snickered and Andromeda crossed her arms, making Draco quell.
She raised her hands in surrender.
He scooped Draco up in his arms and carried him out of the bathroom, through the club, and disapparated as soon as they reached the nearest deserted alley.
The nightmarish eventualities at play in his head ranged the gamut from Draco being unimpressed by his tiny flat to them reverting back to full fledged, teenage fighting or, worse: Harry finding himself
" His eyes glinted impishly.
Hristofor flinched again at the sight of Harry, despite the fact that he was much calmer now.
Harry dropped his head to the table. He'd never felt more helpless. Not only was he likely headed to Azkaban right alongside the hundreds of witches and wizards he'd helped send there over the years, but, worse: If everyone truly believed that he was responsible, then no one would be out looking for the real suspects. He

"No! Of course not! Ron, how could I be? I'm not bent..." He said that last part a little weaker than he had intended.
"Only that they would be very, very valuable to whomever should be so lucky as to possess them!" He smiled slyly and Draco couldn't help but notice the nervous wringing of his hands. He raised a brow in question.
and, while he hated the pain Harry had known because of how he'd gotten that scar, Draco had never felt more grateful for it and what it represented: the fact that he was alive and here and had a shot at a real life full of love, happiness, and
"Ron!" Cried Hermione, but he was already out the door.
"All we know is that it's definitely a potion -- the lab confirmed. But still no leads on a common distributer."
"Harry, I'm so sorry that you felt that you couldn't turn to us for support. That you felt like you had to carry this burden alone. Too many times have I failed you... too many times has this world failed you," Dumbledore said solemnly.
Draco flattened out against the bark, wheels spinning madly. The Ministry of Magic's "Light and Shadow Training Simulation #829:
She smiled warmly. "Sure, deary. I understand, I've raised three myself! Do you have identification with proof of address?"
Narcissa reached out and intertwined her fingers with Draco's.
Harry panted and moaned so sweetly as he adjusted to the fullness. Draco's mouth traveled to his pulse point and then down his neck to his collarbone, feeling Harry's muscles relax around him as he laved at his skin, his tongue massaging and soothing away his nerves as he began to move slowly.
"She's been having an affair, of sorts, with Blaise for the past three years," he said without pretense.
That's it!
Harry paled as he stared at the perfectly scrawled handwriting for the hundredth time in twelve minutes.
Draco watched as Harry drifted off to sleep. It was the most peaceful he'd ever seen the green eyed boy look. He grabbed his blanket off of the chair and draped it over him and Harry stirred only briefly as he pulled it closely, a faint smile on his lips.
Grey eyes widened with horror as he caught on to what Harry was insinuating.
Draco intuitively clutched his wand to his chest, possessively. Harry frowned at him and Draco gave him a rueful smile as he handed it over.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and then narrowed them. "How did you know I was here, Potter?"

"Draco --" Mother started.
"Fuck my life," he thought.
It felt so different from what he knew: Where Ginny had been soft and supple, Draco was angular and cut, lean muscles. Everything felt a little harder, including the cock now pressed against his thigh, and yet, somehow, it all felt

"Ahem."
"Z&M International!" he shouted and soon found himself looking into the small office where Alexandra sat packing up her things for the day.

Harry's eyes burned and his heart felt too warm, too filled with love. He was scared to trust it. Draco noticed and pulled him close, rubbing his shoulder, reassuringly, but it only made the feeling stronger, more intense.
"We've had three more victims and, unfortunately, this week it came with a fatality." Savage said solemnly. "Little witch in Dorset. Gram of eight."
And this calm,
"What? No Weaselette? He's softened you, Malfoy," she teased.
"Here we go," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes before raising both hands in a couple of unkind gestures in Ron's direction.
He walked over to the clothes laid out for him and rolled his eyes. Of course they were posh. He undressed quickly and slipped on the soft cashmere jumper (Ok, he had to give it to Malfoy because it really did feel amazing against his skin) and the trousers. He had expected them to be too long for him since Malfoy was a few inches taller but apparently he'd even had the foresight to transfigure them shorter! The robes, too!
As he thought about what might be happening to Draco in that bathroom and the lights began to flicker and the music started to skip, he thought that, depending on what he discovered when he opened that door, she might be very disappointed because he was fairly certain that he might've actually reached the level of rage where
"And, it was always pretty obvious that you and Malfoy had way too much sexual tension, mate, even if it was wrapped up in hatred. And ever since you got it into your head that he's the anonymous benefactor, you've been giving him goo-goo eyes left and right."
... but, he and Harry now found themselves mostly on the same page -- or, at the very least, somewhere in the same chapter for most things. Somewhat surprisingly, things did, indeed, feel at peace.
"Now, now--" Borgin began to back up slowly with hands halfway up in surrender. "I mustn't be held accountable for whatever...
He smiled ruefully and then raised his hands in surrender at the incredulous look she shot him.
"What?" he asked, innocently.
"Maybe. But that dag was dry as a nun's nasty. Could've told her anything to make her feel special for the sake of being special. You, on the other hand, don't give a
"The day before he purchased the new wand from Gregoravitch."
Ollivander now stood before them, examining them both with a scrutinizing eye.
"For Merlin's sake! I'm telling you I didn't--"
He sighed and placed his head in his hands again, not wanting to see Harry's disappointment or watch the moment that he decided to hate him for the rest of his life. And to think, he'd just had plans to propose.
' -- I see your hair still looks like shite."
The Bulgarian man nodded. "Vhen ve found her ve gave her dreamless sleep and brought her back here. He retrieved her."
"Yea, I'm fine, Hermione."
"Draco you're naked and gorgeous and I want to touch you!" he almost whined.
"What?!" Blaise asked, jaw dropping indignantly. "How come Pansy gets to stay?!"
Malfoy's face softened and Harry saw what looked like sadness and defeat flicker there before he put on his best damnable Malfoy mask and smirked.
"Thank you, have a great day." Harry bowed to the TSA agent and Draco quickly scurried behind him.
"Thank you for giving me the choice, Draco." He reached out to take his hand and then looked out over the little town and shook his head. "I think that might just be one of the greatest gifts I've ever been given."
He smiled, politely. "My apologies. Can you tell us anything about the two men?"
can do all the gay stuff, I'm just here to supervise."
"What's that big whirring thing?" He grabbed on to Harry's bicep with one hand and pointed with the other.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and shook his head frantically, wet tears sliding down the crook and soaking his t-shirt there.
(Skip after the *************************** if ^^^^ is too much for you).
"Huh?"
Harry's breath hitched, his eyes drawn to the leaking cock. "I want to taste you." He swallowed, Adam's apple bobbing. "Want to please you."
"I can't believe we just did that!" Harry turned to Draco, wide-eyed.
She smiled through her tears. "That's beautiful, Draco!" He shrugged shyly. It was weirdly cathartic talking about this.
"Yea, I just need a moment," he squeaked out.
Shit.
"You're really here? And alive? Not some weird ghost?"
"Draco, darling, please be careful," she said as she kissed him on the cheek.
He shook his head briskly, effectively shaking off the sudden pang.
Harry laughed. "I don't know, mate, we've had pretty crazy lives. I reckon if we go down the road of what could have been, we'll be going all night."
-- the one thing that he had feared since that faithful day when he was 11 and it finally clicked for him that he wasn't like all the other boys at his fancy, new boarding school -- that he finally felt free. He almost thought he saw a glimpse of fear in his father's eyes when he had responded to the slur by laughing hysterically.
Draco shook his head. "I, for one, am glad they're going well. I'll shed my tears next week. Today I'm just grateful for these moments. Tonight really has been precious to me, Harry. I'll never forget it."
" Draco exclaimed. "Potter, how in the
In almost every relationship and friendship he could think of, Draco was used to either being taken care of or solely concerning himself with making sure that he took care of himself. Now, he found himself wanting to do whatever he could to not hurt Harry, or -- at the very least -- take care of him when he inevitably did. He didn't think he could stay away... yet, seeing the disappointment in Harry's eyes after father's firecall made Draco think that he might try just about anything to avoid that look on Harry's face again.
"What an awful analogy, Potter." Draco rolled his eyes and wiped away a tear. "You know you always catch the snitch, of course we'd win in overtime."
He swallowed hard and said a sorrowful prayer as he stood and crossed the room.
Draco carried on, seemingly unaware of what Harry was pretty sure to be a subtle act of wandless magic. Harry's mind drifted back to Ron's half-hearted joke from years ago when his own powers seemed to go into overdrive where Draco was concerned.

They sped around a corner where a market place full of merchants and bargain hunting muggles was visible in a nearby square.
And then there was the little matter of Harry
Harry eyed the cigarette, longingly, the thought of a quick stress relief oh so temping...
It had been easy to behave last night: they were so incredibly exhausted from the week's events that they'd both knocked out as soon as their heads touched the pillow. They'd slept straight through the night despite the fact that it was only 6pm when they'd gone to bed.
"She did exactly what I would have done if I were wandless in muggle territory: try to lose them on the trains." He shook his head. "She would have probably made it, too, if she wasn't hurt."
Biggest plot twist since Wilda Griffiths indeed!
Borgin loosened his old bones and limbered his neck as the spell ended. "You two know how to play hardball," he grinned mischievously.
Harry had barely had a moment to ponder the question before they felt the cool, tell-tale sensation of a spell whooshing over them.
He kept going until Draco gripped his hair tightly and yanked, causing Harry to pull away and stare up at him, breathlessly.
There was a long silence as Harry stared back into his eyes.
. It wouldn't work." Harry didn't expect to feel so disheartened by those words. But then Malfoy continued: "Not like I'm used to, at least. It couldn't just be a random hook up or no strings attached. When has anything between us ever come without strings? Strings with you already gets so messy and tangled... But the crazy part is, even though I run from strings and attachment, somehow, I wouldn't even want a life with you in it without the strings." He resumed caressing his hair and stared into his eyes warmly.
Any common place that Draco might think of to meet up in the wizarding world would raise a lot of questions and probably garner attention from the press if Harry Potter himself were to show up with a captured and bound prisoner and just sit and wait...
Harry shook his head as if to come out of a daze. "Nothing it's just... I'm just really proud of you."
"Well... Merlin, this was so long ago... Maybe six months ago or so... We were all out day-drinking at an Oceana Wizarding Pride event and he was talking about Gregorovitch, the famous wand maker, and I told him that we have Ollivander back at home. I remembered the odd encounter we had with him on that case we worked and shared the bit about the Elder Wand as a farce... Salazar, why would I ever think that was
Draco looked flabbergasted. "What in the-- Wait..." His eyes widened impossibly larger in disbelief. "Harry, can muggle men have babies?!"
"I don't know much about Quidditch, but I can say that that Benjy Williams is one fine hunk of man," said Daphne, wryly.
"Take a break, hunny, it's time for your lunch," Draco said as he waved his wand.
Draco leaned in for a kiss, lips still brushing his salaciously as he spoke. "Nope, that's the Potter-Malfoy special. Now, let's hurry this along -- we have plans this weekend and I won't have any fun if you're obsessing through the whole damned thing. And Salazar forbid this shite bleed into the wedding." He shivered at the thought.
Fuck!
His fellow Slytherins were mostly split into 2 camps: the first being those whose families were tried and true death eaters who thought Draco a traitor; and the rest those who were neutral or team Order who now placed all blame for the hate the house was receiving onto him for being the one actual death eater. The Greengrasses weren't bad though. He had never been particularly close with either of them but, at some point, the younger one, Astoria, must've taken him for a sadcase and she and Daphne started forcing him to join them in the common room every now and then for a game of exploding snaps in their attempts to pull him out of hiding. "If you're going to hide in the shadows like a vampire then people are going to treat you like one!" Daphne kept insisting.

who claimed that there had been a burglary gone wrong."
Potter licked his lips and looked around the room briefly before saying respectfully: "Thank you, professor, but I'd rather not."
Draco raised a wry brow.
Draco crossed his legs along with his arms and leaned against the doorframe. An unexpected smirk slowly crept onto his face. "Really?" There was humor there instead of loathing which was a pretty good sign when it came to Malfoy, Harry thought.
If you've never watched "Sisters of House Black - An Unofficial Fan Film" then you totally should! It's cannon in my head now when it comes to the Black sisters' story and shapes how I wrote them. Here's the link if you're interested or you can type it in YouTube: https://youtu.be/0hrcRtu45TU
If you have your own thoughts of what pre-2001 pop songs Harry might've put on the mixtape I'd love to hear it! :-)

Harry smiled wryly. "Alright, then. No name, no galleons."
Harry shook his head. "I reeeally doubt that will happen, Ron."
Harry to know how he felt. He lifted the chain over his head, revealing an eternity ring: an intricately carved, goblin-wrought silver band featuring a celtic knot design set with emeralds and rubies.
Draco froze, lips slightly parted. He had no clue how to answer the unexpected query. He'd never allowed himself to ponder that question because it was an impossibility. The dating part was one thing (if dating meant shagging, then he had always had whoever he wanted -- in a very discrete way...) but it was the
As Harry followed suit, he looked around the room at the odd mix of friends and family who had come out to support them. He watched as Minister Shacklebolt laughed with Hagrid, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. Narcissa was chatting cordially with Mrs. Weasley and Fleur. Bill and Charlie were laughing as Ginny and George tried to teach little Teddy how to bewitch a gnome to fly down the back of Ron's dress. Pansy, Blaise, Goyle, and Daphne were joyfully reunited and laughing over glasses of firewhiskey with the DA. Luna was twirling around delightedly to the beat of her own drum. Waldon, Wila, and Ariela, now going into their 4th year at Hogwarts, were excitedly talking quidditch with Oliver Wood and Viktor Krum. Astoria and Michael were snogging heavily in the corner of the tent.
"What?!" he asked, baffled. But then it clicked. He turned wide eyes towards Harry who slowly donned a similar look of comprehension.
"Potter!" she shouted, her wide eyes landing on him when she finally came to.
"Harry, listen to me. I love you. I have loved you with my whole heart since I was 10-years-old and I always will. Don't you ever doubt that. But I love Blaise Zabini just like you love Malfoy." She hung her head. "We reconnected a few years ago and... We resisted! Really, Harry we've tried! In all these years, we've only ever crossed the line that you're thinking of once and... Harry, I just felt so guilty! I'm so sorry! We stopped, Harry, I swear we stopped! But... it's the emotional bit that we still haven't figured out how not to give in to and I can't help but feel just as guilty."
"Have you lost your bloody mind?!"
"Do you think the floo was tampered with?" Hermione furrowed her brow in thought, worry etched on her face.

"I don't know, sir. Maybe when you're raised to impress unimpressible homicidal maniacs it's hard to think up a whole lot of joyful moments. But -- and again, I don't know -- did you ever think about the fact that Potter just died 5 months ago and watched a lot of other people do so and not come back to life? And, you know, that he might not be feeling all that happy at the moment, either?"

Draco's breathing did, indeed, hitch at his words and his trousers suddenly felt a lot tighter.
Draco felt a mixture of relief that Harry didn't think that the whole thing was his fault but also sadness that the stubborn Gryffindor was so willing to hold all the guilt himself. "It's ok. I can share some of the blame. If I hadn't taken your cloak you would've never been left exposed. How much blame can you let me hold?"
that in there?!"
"Like a pathetic and desperate attempt to make me look less sorry?" Draco griped ruefully.
He had initially assumed the eight year gap in the the Australian Ministry's magical registry to be a mistake, that they'd simply excluded something or maybe there was protected information that the authorities weren't willing to share. It went back as far as Krafft's time at Durmstrang where he was noted as being a fairly mediocre student with a penchant for getting others to do what he wanted: multiple detentions for things like manipulating younger years or having other students to do his assignments. His parents fell ill during the summer after his sixth year and he didn't return for his seventh year as he opted to take care of them himself. Then: complete silence. There was only one notable record listed during this time: the registration of a new wand (chestnut with a dragon heartstring core) purchased from Gregorovitch in year seven of the eight year hiatus. It wasn't until a year later, when he made his grand reappearance on the arm of Matthew Echunga -- then chaser on the Australian National Quidditch team who eventually helped fund the startup of Sebastian's broom business -- that there was even a hint at his goings-ons within the wizarding world.
Stevens paused and searched the terminal before she pushed through. Her eyes landed on them, as if she expected Harry to be there, and she nodded once to indicate:
"Mums the word!" said Amanda and the rest of them murmured their agreement before the floo ended.
"What?" Draco asked incredulously, a hundred different pieces clicking into place. He put his head in his hands and groaned, reminded of the talk he needed to have with mother. "Why didn't you tell me?!"
"Where are we?" he asked, peering out past an old church steeple to a village of thatched cottages.
a lollipop."
Draco shifted and reached into his bag to pull out the case of potions that Riply had packed. He handed Harry a clear vial full of clear liquid.
Draco's heart clutched now as he remembered the awe and warmth that carried the barely whispered name to his ears.
"Yea." Ron looked up with red eyes and swallowed thickly. "I wonder how long it's been stuck there, you know? And, thank Merlin for that because it means she isn't..."
Ginny arched her back and her muscles tensed around him as she screamed out into the ether. He quickly pulled out his slicked fingers and rubbed her clit vigorously as he watched her leak, legs shaking around his shoulders as she rode out her orgasm.
Harry was looking at him strangely, like he had when he was telling him about wanting to go to uni. Draco laughed. "What?"
Professor Merrywhip really seemed to be oblivious to the fact that everyone in the room, besides himself, had fought in the war and that their mastery of defense against the dark arts was the only reason any of them were sitting there today. Draco had been on the other side of the war and it still felt belittling to him.
"Draco! You've
"You take me for a complete wanker, do you? I didn't forget that little display of wandless magic that day on your terrace." Draco cursed, inwardly. Unlike Harry, he'd never actually taken the time to
can make it back from that..."
Harry was shaking with frustration. So he didn't even know this person. Just a rumored cure for potion ingredients that not a single lab test detected from a phantom bloke which -- who knows, could actually make the symptoms worse.
Draco stared at him nonplussed.
"I swear to Merlin, if I have to sit through
good at being bad guys."
It was funny, really. Harry found Draco's budding love of muggle pop culture so hilariously at odds with everything he'd previously known about his stuffy, prejudiced-against-all-things-muggle former rival. And, surprisingly, it seemed that the more upbeat the song or dance, the happier the Draco. It was strangely endearing to see all of his guards come down as if, at least for the night, Draco had forgotten that he was supposed to be an aristocratic, arrogant, prat.
Draco was grateful that he'd opted to wear his warmest jumper today as Potter had, indeed, made him ditch the robes. He shivered as he apparated them to the address that Harry had given him, already yearning for the balmy, Australian temperatures. They appeared on a picturesque little suburban street with lawns that all still somehow looked perfectly manicured, despite the frost.
"Well..." he said, stopping by the head of the bed. "Stranger things have happened. ...To me, anyways," he added with a shrug.
Harry scarfed down some breakfast (surprised to find that he not only had an appetite, but he was feeling ravenous) and then headed to class which was mercifully right down the corridor.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. He was pretty sure this was another one of Potter's ways of single-handedly trying to fix Draco's reputation and he didn't know whether to feel annoyed or touched. The worst part was, he couldn't figure out
"And you've got to bear in mind that this was weeks after I had lost Sirius and everything had happened in the ministry -- all of my friends had been put in danger, Voldemort was gaining power, people were disappearing left and right and I had just learned that I was the Chosen One who was supposed to stop it all." He looked up at Dumbledore who looked remorseful. "I didn't realize what had happened at the time. All I remembered after the escape was Draco giving me his robes and wiping my tears and telling me that I had to stay strong and pull it together because people were counting on me to win the war." He looked over to Ron who looked dumbfounded and Ginny who was crying silently. "He told me that he had to play his role or he and his family would be killed but that he hoped I survived and won. That's part of why I was so obsessed with him that year because he didn't think he had a choice and I wanted to stop him, to show him that he did have choices! And I defended him in his trials because I knew he really didn't think he had another choice that would keep his family safe." Draco had the Malfoy mask firmly in place but Harry noticed that he was nervously fiddling with the butterbeer cork around his neck.
Draco nodded and she disappeared through the great oak doors.

"Power?"
"We really
"Draco... No... You gave me a choice!"
Anavi Chopra found herself sat in her drawing room that Saturday afternoon with eyes nervously glued to the floo.
"Excuse me, mate, where am I? Do you know how to get to South Kensington?"
Harry dropped his face into his hands and massaged his temples. "Hermione, I really don't feel good. Is it too late to back out of this?"
"Erhm..." Harry didn't know how exactly to describe the interaction he'd just had with Malfoy. "He was actually being... kind of... erhm.... Nice?"
Harry saw the moment it clicked for Draco, the nervous look replaced with a lascivious smile just as Harry reached the check point and stepped up.
"Draco, hunny," he cooed as he frantically pat pale, clammy cheeks that looked even paler than usual in the twilight. He was just checking for a pulse when he heard a groan!
Draco pulled him even tighter to his side and kissed his forehead as Fleur floated in snacks from the kitchen, Charlie and his Romanian boyfriend got the first round of exploding snaps going, and everyone shouted Mrs. Weasley down when she tried to put on Celestina Warbeck.
"There are simply more important things to think about right now." She was currently sorting through his mail from this morning's post. He had planned to simply ignore it all so he was all too glad to let her sort through it. "Kingsley Shacklebolt formally requests your --"
He looked around and walked over to a nearby dresser to look.
He breathed a sigh of relief when Draco made it through without incident (because he had been sure he was going to be subjected to a strip search considering how fucking bizarre he'd been acting). He was smiling brilliantly as he padded over to him just as Harry was putting his ring back around his neck.
The man twisted his lips wryly. He looked miffed but he eventually nodded and summoned his shirt and robes before disapparating without another word.
Draco smiled and then tried to force himself to reign it in. He couldn't believe his luck! He was actually being
"Draco?"
"I bet you are, sticky fingers. Hold
"Draw him out, how?" Harry suddenly looked like he did when he got all protective and possessive and Draco noticed him unconsciously reach for the ring hanging from his neck.
Draco chuckled. "That's you assuming that you'd be on top."
Harry grimaced as if stung. His world was plummeting. He needed to stop this! Needed to fix it!
Draco nodded, knowingly. "Well maybe it could be helpful to practice being mindful and present with sensation first. Hmm..." His eyes lit up. "Ok, Harry. I want you to try meditating for a whole week and, if you do it every single day, maybe we can try something."
"Then I graciously accept your bribes of sex and food," he said, kissing him sweetly. "And besides, turns out I owe you for your brilliant consultation."
Harry grinned as he stepped out of the floo and into a familiar, still grimey but slightly more friendly bar.
"My name's Harold, not Harry! And what in the fuck is going on?" he said, starting to panic.
Harry twisted up his mouth in thought. "I don't know, but..." He reached out unexpectedly to take Draco by his good hand. "C'mon."

Harry paled.
Harry's jaw dropped as something clicked into place.
"Shut it, Potter." He smirked. Where to start? "How much are you comfortable with me telling them?"
the feel of the scruff there felt. He made his way to his long, elegant neck and Draco tilted his head to give him better access, moaning as he sucked on the sensitive skin there. What a beautiful sound, Harry thought.
He kissed Draco, hard, hoping that if he could pour everything he felt into it then it would
Shite. In 15 years, he still hadn't figured out how to keep a secret from Pansy Parkinson. She could read him better than almost anyone.

Harry chuckled and paused their slow progress up the path to the villa to pull Draco closer by their intertwined hands. He kissed him lovingly on the forehead before confessing:
"Seriously! Though, you would've thought McGonagall or someone would have anticipated that it would be traumatic for the lot of us." He rolled his eyes.
crap or fully understand my past and he just always seemed so interested to know!" he rattled off, somewhat defensively.
Stevens' spinning, green head smiled smugly from the hearth and Harry tried to tamp back the seed of hope threatening to burgeon somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
"I know. I have to."
Malfoy stopped his pacing and frowned in thought.
" he asked, confused. "Does that happen often?"
"Oh, the pleasure is all ours, hunny," said Crystal. "You still in London, darling? I thought you had come back?"
"Why are you here, Malfoy?" He realized his mistake as soon as it'd left his mouth. Draco's smile dropped and was replaced with something icy and protective.
"Well... if you can imagine, I'm usually very, very selfish when it comes to sex. But surprisingly, I wouldn't want to be that way with you. I'd want to take my time and figure out just what you like... You deserve to be taken care of and to experience pleasure and I'd want to be the one to please you." He licked his lips and Harry swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly parched. "And I'd want to take things slowly to make sure that you're comfortable each step of the way." He traced his thumb across Harry's bottom lip and Harry's breath hitched. "And apparently you'd get a
"We don't know. Potter was confounded or something during dueling practice! Now he's freaking out and saying that his name is Harold or something and won't let anyone near him to undo the spell."
"Well that's certainly a good start, Harry. But I don't think it's quite mission accomplished," Draco chided and Harry's whole body went taut with anticipation, having finally learnt to skip the devastation of it not being enough, but still desperate to hear how he could be exactly what Draco needed. "There's more to taste and, quite frankly, I think you can do better than that if you really want to please me. You sweet, sweet darling," he cooed, "how about you show me all the devilish things that precious mouth of yours can do?"
"Oh..." he said again. "Hmm... I don't know if I can do that without Harry... But I'll try. It'll help if Luna's there, she always throws me off guard!"
"And, Draco, dear. Thank you for helping to bring our Ginny back to us." Her eyes crinkled with warmth.
"Sooo... Only a little over a week left, Harry! Are you ready??" she leaned in, brimming with excitement.
Shuffling footsteps headed their way and Harry made a bee line for the opposite room which he prayed was Draco's.
He looked down when he felt a tug on his t-shirt to find that they were surrounded by little ones.
Ron shook his head. "No, but it
Draco couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. He watched as she walked towards the entrance hall and paused before she went in.
"Ehrm... Yes -- Well, Ginny was the one who spotted them at the end of the street. We were confused and she wanted to confront them, but I insisted that it was ok -- that they were probably just lost or something."
Harry nodded. He had no doubt that Ron would've abandoned all sense, reason, and plans in an attempt to kill either of the two men had he known. "It wouldn't have been good. And I'm glad you didn't know because I wouldn't want you to carry that on your conscious."
Draco couldn't see Harry at all but Harry's hand found his and squeezed.
Harry shook his head. "I haven't."
"Alright, mate. I'm down," Ron said, at last, clapping his hands together eagerly and effectively shifting the mood. "How are we breaking him out of that joint?"
Harry shook his head. "But it was my fault. I was so stupid for being in Knockturn Alley that day."
"I want my mother back! The one person I could count on during the darkest of times!" he pleaded. "I have light now, mother! I finally have
The idea of being distracted from the myriad of emotions he couldn't possibly deal with right now didn't sound like a bad idea at the time and it vaguely registered in his cloudy mind that, if this were to lead to sex, then it may be the last time he got to get dick for the rest of his life if he actually honored the stupid vows he was planning to make. Draco stood and wobbled but the bloke wrapped an arm around his waist to steady him and helped lead him off to the rest room.
"Ok, now how does that get us any closer to catching this woman?"
"Malfoy! Wait up!" The two boys paused. Malfoy glanced around warily and then nodded to Zabini to go ahead.
"Yea, but..."
"Ha!" he laughed into his drink. "Blondie does but
"Got it!" she said, still beaming at having conned him into their little agreement when she ended the call.
"Erm..." he felt his face heat up. What was he supposed to say?
"Nothing! I just want you to be happy. Just... be very careful if you plan on getting closer to Malfoy. He
They had come to the airport straight from Anavi's house with no other practical and
Draco leaned in so close that Harry could feel his breath against his ear as he talked. "Harry, are you trying to say that you think you would want to top and are curious about bottoming, but nervous?" Harry nodded slowly, swallowing hard.
Harry had played his role. He had found the horcruxes, rode off with the dragon, bested the evil death eaters, vanquished the villain and saved the world. He had been naive enough to think that it might all end there, only to find that people then needed him to play the role of the war hero and the symbol of hope and change in the aftermath.
"Only that they had thick accents. Bulgarian, if I'm not mistaken."
"None taken! You should've been there for the existential crisis Fred had after when he asked if I'd ever wanted to shag you or any other bloke and I couldn't say 'yes'." He chuckled. "He'd thought that was just the norm, too!"
A moment later, a large sledgehammer came smashing through the window, sending glass flying everywhere. Harry belatedly hoped that Bob, his muggle neighbor, wouldn't miss it and silently prayed that his garage door had been open. Oh well -- there was always
mocha for you, ay." The beguiling, Australian businessman sat the drinks before an immaculately dressed and manicured man whose long, blonde, braided ponytail snaked around the curve of his neck and past his collarbone.
"Yea, that part was all fun and games until Ron had to chime in and tell Fred:
go without chasing it down and finding out exactly where it leads, but, I don't have to tell you that this has the potential for you to get hurt very, very badly..."
"You can't. But we need to find Ginny and I know that you want that as badly as I do. I can't make you believe me, but I would never hurt Ginny." He shook his head. "I can't hate that she loves you, or you her.
She stood tall and he spun to face her, face-to-face. For the first time in a very long time, she did not look away. Instead, she reached out to hold his face within her hands.
"You think someone from there was able to trace it back to you?" she asked, astonished.
"Well, until his parents were both found gruesomely murdered in the family home."
"Ok, well we're going to see if we can find out what's what from the source. Thanks, Blaise -- we'll try to update you with what we find before your portkey leaves."
for life."

Harry paled more and more with every word.
"How can they even
"But you're still worried that I might want to hide it?" He kind of understood his point. Harry's interests were quidditch, football, and fighting bad guys. The only smoking gun he had to even tip off a homophobic prick that they should get their hackles up was the fact that he was obviously in love with the man standing in front of him. "Why would I do that?"
"Wouldn'ta missed it for the world, Harry!" Hagrid boomed.
"No, you're certainly not alone but... Harry, you do realize that if there's anyone that never needs to prove anything to anyone ever again, it's you, right?"
"What?" he asked.
Let's just say that Astoria was not pleased to find out that he'd fudged their sacred soul bonding vows on their wedding day and that Draco was about as sexually attracted to her as a three-legged goat. They tried to make the whole heir thing happen for their parents' sake but each attempt required copious amounts of alcohol, a certain Janet Jackson song, and a lot of imagination on Draco's part of a pair of green eyes and the ghost of a whispered
"Ronald Weasley, you don't have to like me but Harry's been through enough and if you make this any harder for him I swear to Merlin I'll hex you to hades!"
"Merlin, yes yes yes yes yes," he almost sang. And with that, Draco matched his rhythm and Harry buried his head into Draco's neck and moaned loudly as he came and came and came. Draco arched his head back as he followed suit.
Of course he knew she had been visiting with solicitors. He was fucking
person he wanted to see right now.
"Well I know at least one of them has a residence in the UK so there's a chance they haven't left the area..."
Draco reached out and grabbed him by the shoulders as he continued to search those eyes. "No, Harry, stay with me. It's ok. You're ok. Your friends are ok." Granger and Weasley nodded off to the side. Harry and Harold seemed to be fighting for control. Draco rubbed firm, calming circles on his shoulders with his thumbs. "They are strong. They protect each other. They protect
As promised: a second, chapter for today that actually has Draco somewhere in it :-)
"Maybe we could play charades? --it's a muggle game," Potter clarified as Draco and Pansy looked at him puzzled. "Where you act it out with your body and we guess?"
A chorus of laughter went around the room.
"Oh, Ron, you're always eating. I'm sure you would've eventually found
"Well,
" he yelled after Draco's fleeing form.
"Hiii handsome!" they sung in chorus.
"Who here can also cast a corporeal patronus?" He, Blaise, Daphne, and Theo were the only ones to put their hands down.
"Merlin, it's actually going to happen!" whispered Katie, now clutching onto Ginny.
"Portkeys?"
Harry shrugged as he watched Draco tour the tiny flat, mesmerized. "Well, I have my house at Grimmauld place -- I mostly stay there because it's obviously more convenient to use magic and for travel... but I like to come here whenever I need a break from the wizarding world," he added, somewhat sheepishly.
Harry smiled. Ron was right, Draco seemed to be able to read him better than anybody.
When Draco spoke, it was low and rough with want, his grey eyes darkening.
over that life'!" He snorted and Harry couldn't help but laugh, too, though he shivered at the visual of Voldemort, noseless and in the green JLo dress.
Harry shivered at the command and his pulse pounded as he slowly pushed the apron up Draco's chest. He made sure not to break eye contact as he leaned in close, willing himself to take his time as he let his tongue toy with the balls hardly veiled in the thin fabric. Draco gripped his hair firmly as he suckled them through the lace, artfully pulling each one into his mouth. He released them and inhaled, reverently, as he licked up Draco's length, the light pink lace turning magenta where he licked.
Draco frantically felt his face with hands too cold and clammy to be dignified, in a move intended just as much to make sure that all of his parts were back sorted as it was to confirm that he was, in fact, still alive! He placed a hand over his chest, hoping to still the heart now threatening to beat out of his rib cage and turned wide, grey eyes to the man standing beside him in the alley he'd apparated them to.
Just when Draco thought he was about to give in to his indecent proposal, the fucking wicked bitch of the west sat down beside him.

"Yea, we thought that great stupid brute was going to kill you!" Wila pouted and crossed her arms, petulantly.
"Are you worried that I'm expecting us to shag? I told you I wasn't..." He looked concerned as he peered down at him.
A loud pounding filled the room as someone forcefully kicked at the bedroom door. Harry shot up, disentangling himself from Draco as he grabbed his wand and looked around, disoriented. Draco rolled his eyes and reached out a hand to calm him before he could accidentally blast something.
"That's it, love! Let go! Fill my fucking arsehole!" he ground out.
die of a heart attack, thank you very much. Now, can you focus, Potter?" he said without looking up. "How you excel at any of this with the attention span of a gnat is beyond me."
After rummaging through Ginny's medicine cabinet and, mercifully, finding a vial of hangover potion, Harry was feeling exponentially better. He still had an hour to fully pull himself together before work so he was in the kitchen, hoodie drawn over his head, cozily, and nursing a very strong cup of tea when a tapping noise caught his attention.
At last, the next flash of light illuminated the scene and there, some twenty metres off, stood Sebastian Krafft, madness in his eyes as Draco spun, landing somewhere just behind the bloke as the darkness descended. Draco raised his wand, adrenaline pumping as he wordlessly cast at the dark spot that had been Sebastian, just moments before. One last, powerful green jet burst free from the spot and landed somewhere to Draco's left just as the red jet of his disarming charm collided with something solid!
"Vogue" - Madonna
Harry exhaled a long breath as he looked around him. Where to start?
"Draco, our decisions might not always be... the best... but we make them as a family.
Draco's eyes lit up. "Right there?" He hit the spot again.
"Sir?"
Draco felt his his chest constrict and then so did everything else as they disapparated on the spot.
She smirked wryly.
"Thanks, Gin," he said as he snuggled against her and reached for another spoonful of Rocky Road.
Draco gaped at her.
"What? I thought it was high fashion?" he said, examining the silk sleeve of his black and gold patterned shirt that simply felt marvelous on his skin! It was loose fitting in a way that accentuated his lithe lines and cut in a deep v that showed a hint of the fine blonde hair on his chest. He also wore black fitted jeans and suede loafers that he thought made him look very high class muggle.
Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so happy! He and Draco had spent most of the next day in matching pairs of Draco's fancy silk pajamas and canoodling near the fire with mugs of warm butterbeer or, otherwise, snogging each other senseless. He could only assume that this was what regular teens did but, if so, boy had he been missing out!
Harry's mouth dropped, taken aback. "Yes but --"
that Father had shown them. Draco blushed handsomely but avoided the question.
"Well at least that solves one mystery, I guess," he surmised, walking over towards Draco's bed. "I couldn't for the life of me figure out why you'd be having casual conversations with muggles but, I guess this makes more sense."
Harry shook his head. There was no way he'd ever forget about Draco.
He deserved death but Potter had kept him from it. He deserved Azkaban but Potter's testimony saw him free.
," there was a moment where it felt like there was the potential for a friendship but then it had become very clear that they each had separate and conflicting roles to play. At first, Harry had felt determined to prevent Malfoy from living out the destiny that he seemed to have resigned himself to but then it had become obsessive for Harry and culminated with Harry accidentally nearly killing the boy in that bathroom. He'd finally let go of the notion that they could ever be on the same side but then, they went and saved each other's lives. Could they possibly bridge the gap now that the war was over and the game was done?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, your poor, precious reputation," she scoffed before sipping her wine. "If you thought you knew so much, why didn't you say anything?! Ask me why I did it or fight for us?! Anything would have been better than just ignoring me for years! What's even your point in staying together if that's the case?"
"So you're telling me you hadn't seen your wife in a day and a half and you didn't find that suspicious?" Jansen screwed up his face, doubtfully.
"Draco, I've been letting you play dress up in my clothes since you were four." And, as if to prove it, she reached into her own hair and removed her ornate, floral crystal hair-comb and placed it in his hair. He stared at himself, awed. A reflection of the most beautiful person he knew. "I never cared that you were gay. That part has always been more of your father's hangup but that's only because he doesn't know that I know what all he got up to in
"Huh..." Ron pondered and screwed up his face in thought. "I wonder what little things could've changed our paths."
"Out with it, Potter."
"I have an idea," he said, reaching for Harry's hand and spinning on the spot.
Draco bristled at Harry's side. He spared Harry a fleeting, nervous glance before turning his full attention back to Krafft. His nerves were replaced with adrenaline as the full weight of the situation dawned on him: he may be immune to the full extent of the Elder Wand but Harry...
Draco blinked at him, dumbfounded. Harry supposed he was used to more fight from him but fighting was the last thing he wanted to do right now.
"Potter!" he breathed, mesmerized. His eyes landed on Andromeda a moment later and Harry saw a glimpse of panic that made him wonder if Draco had made the mistake of thinking he'd spotted a ghost like so many others did when they encountered the woman who looked so much like her psychopathic, late sister. She smiled her wide, kindly smile and he watched the fear abate. "An-Andromeda?" Draco finally managed to get out.
Harry inhaled sharply at his words.
"Harry, one outcome comes with a media frenzy headache that is over in a week but, the other... The other would mean that we're in for more running and hiding and fighting." And, he didn't want to say it, knowing how frightened Harry was of loss, but it wasn't lost on
"What if..." He bit his lip, hesitantly. "What if I might feel the same?"
Harry nodded. "I started practicing those mindfulness exercises in your book last night! It was actually helpful." It wasn't nearly as easy to focus as he'd expected but it did help him to stop worrying so much about how the feast was going and he'd had a restful night's sleep.
Draco saw the flash of green just as the scene was plunged into deep darkness. He instinctively groped for Harry and spun on the spot, apparating them to the dark shadows of a massive yew tree mere seconds before the curse could collide.

"That banner was a right bitch to make, Harry." Ron puffed out his chest proudly.
"Please tell me you've got
Draco fell into a rhythm as he rocked his hips back and forth slowly, his breath hitching as he found his stride. Harry moaned as the burn started to dissipate and turn into pleasure, his cock twitching between them. He was just considering trying to see if Draco would let him reach for his cock yet when Draco switched the angle and he felt
Ron faced forward and looked unseeingly ahead down the staircase. "It's not pity to think that what happened to you was fucked up. And it
"Give it a taste, hun. Let me know if it's sweet enough," she encouraged as she slid the cup across the counter.
Harry returned to an eerily empty Grimmauld Place late that night. He hadn't noticed it much the night before because he'd, blessedly, downed their last bottle of

happened the other way round."
She held his eye in the mirror and then crossed her arms, wryly.
Draco nodded thoughtfully.
"Ahhhh!"
"What's that?"
"Completely?"
Draco threw back the covers, stomped across the room, and swung open the door.
"He's not my..." He shook his head. "I'm not gay." He said a little too emphatically.
"Obviously."
"What happened 6th year was not sex, Harry. That's not what sex is like and no one would think you wanted that."
, anyways."
Andromeda hid her snicker behind her hand and Bill fixed Harry with a deadpanned look from across the room that screamed:
He hadn't even bothered to tell Ron or Hermione about any of it since he'd left Hermione's office last Wednesday. As far as they knew, Harry had been a wreck because he was a sappy, confused bloke with a unrequited crush -- which wasn't that far off from the truth, honestly, so he figured he'd spare them the parts that would give them cause to worry that he might lose it. Besides, he didn't want to talk about it. It felt private and tragic and his and Draco's. How could they understand? How could anyone?
one girl recited with her eyes screwed up a few feet away. In the room to his left stood visible, towering piles of miscellaneous odds and ends like broken umbrellas and solo shoes that he supposed were to become portkeys. Finally, he spotted a little section of cubicles stationed in the center of the floor with a sign overhead that said:
?! He sighed and followed Harry into the tiny restaurant.
I realize that there a couple of things that might make you raise an eyebrow (Draco style) if you haven't read the prequel, Draco Hearts Spice Girls and Harry Potter. Here's some info that will be helpful to know for this chapter if you haven't read DHSGAHP:
person he'd wanted to see.
Draco made it a rule to try not to waste energy worrying about Harry Potter as it was sure to be a constant and futile endeavor for anyone to undertake. That obviously hadn't always worked for him in the past since Potter somehow kept getting caught by death eaters, but the little things, he could usually let go of. He sat here now, however, getting increasingly annoyed. He couldn't be the only one to notice the dark circles around Potter's eyes that made him look like he hadn't slept properly in a year? And someone else surely had to have realized that Harry never smiled anymore or that the sparkle in his bright green eyes had been dimmed... And what about what happened this morning? Someone had to have noticed that Potter was having a rough go of it and that maybe they should back off.
Draco rolled his eyes as his heart fluttered, traitorously, and stormed off towards the street, haughtily mumbling about

"Look, mother, I love you but I can't keep being tortured like this!"

The duo were sat cross-legged on the floor in front of the big, blue muggle screen -- both still in their pajamas and donning matching blonde hair and mesmerized stares, to boot.

"That's it, love." His voice was low and raspy as Harry's muscles clinched around him. The mellifluous sounds coming from Harry's mouth told him that neither of them were going to last much longer.
The loud, jarring sound of marble cracking echoed through the still grounds and Draco turned his back to the scene, gaze fixed on the glowing bindings around his wrists. He shut his eyes tight and waited with bated breath. He didn't need to see what came next.
"While I'm glad to know where your loyalties lie, Stevens, unless you have any proof to the contrary then I expect you to follow orders no matter what you're comfortable with," Robards said as he walked commandingly to the front of the room. "Potter will face justice! Do I make myself clear?!"

"I'm going to go look for the Trolley witch," said Ron, standing up and making his way towards the door. "I'm starving!"
Blaise's smug face turned incredulous as he read through it quickly.
They both winced and then laughed as Madam Pomfrey finally made her appearance.
Draco's eyes widened. "What?! You think he's doing all of this for a fabled wand?!"
hate cooking," he said, leaning in to steal an open-mouthed kiss.
Andromeda had been right: He needed to move on. No matter how much the brief interaction might've convinced Draco that the flame was still there for Harry, too, the fact of the matter was that the man was married and already had a full life built without him.
Draco waved a hand, dismissively, and her mouth closed with a clack. Harry looked between the two with a raised brow.
Draco rested his forehead on Harry's and proceeded to wrap his arms around his waist, gently pulling them closer.
"Well maybe if you'd get off your high horse and actually
"Technically, no..." he said snapping out of his daze, mind finally galvanizing and his eyes searching madly through the article. "This doesn't make sense..."
"Uh-huh," she nodded.
Draco's smile went from shy to ravishing and Harry's eyes traveled down to it, automatically, making the moment feel charged and Draco's already distressed heart leap. Just when he was quite sure that Harry sodding Potter might literally be the death of him and that he didn't very much mind, something shifted for Harry and he dropped his hands to his side, the carefree, thrilled countenance from a moment before replaced by something more hesitant and doubtful.
not in the mood to play this game. Now you can either tell me simply because I've been good to you for over ten years or... I'm sure Draco here can just take the information we need -- He's a master legilimens, you know," he lied through his teeth. He felt Draco stiffen beside him. "Just keep in mind that some stupid accents won't be the only secrets we're privy to if we have to take that route..."
to play nice with Malfoy?" Hermione said, already exasperated as she took a seat next to Harry. "Us 8th years are supposed to be models for interhouse unity!"
"Sooo..." Draco teased as Harry pulled up his jeans and he did the same with his pajamas, an amused glimmer in his eye. "Where are you at on that gay thing?"
Across the way was where Ron had once sat before he'd left to join George at the shop more than two years ago now. So much had changed in the last 6 years. So many people had come and gone. But he had remained and he had long learned that he couldn't always count on people to stay -- it was out of his control. What he

"Well, I know you're probably dying to tell me what Ron and Hermione did: that I need to leave it alone."

Draco and Harry shared matching incredulous looks.

And it had been hard, for all of them. While Narcissa still gave him the cold shoulder years later, she had started sending him hand-knit (not magic knit, mind you) scarves and hats and blankets on his birthdays and Draco had heard from multiple accounts that his father was overheard bragging about him when he'd made
"What?" She blushed.
"Listen, Draco, just shield and run. Shield and run. You ready?"

"Surely you've figured out by now why sex requires so many mental backflips on my end now that I could probably medal in the muggle Olympics? Or that I hardly ever initiate because I refuse to feel like your
Harry stared into frantic grey eyes and remembered that soft, timid kiss in that club the night Draco had sung him Spice Girls. He remembered the exact moment when he finally understood why people called it making
"You sly dog! You've known what you were doing this whole time, didn't you?!"
"Now what are we going to do with this bloke?" Harry pointed a thumb in Hristofor's direction. "He'll probably just run straight to his friend or the other one when we let him go..."
much about poncy arse clothes or their hair?"
"Nuh-uh-uh." He shook his head. "You tell me what I want to hear, first."
Draco responded by kissing him back, just as passionately.
Harry watched as Malfoy threatened Borgin and he became more convinced than ever that the stupid git had actually joined the Death Eaters. Was he really that daft and elitist to do such a thing? Harry sighed as he mentally answered his own question. Harry had always had Malfoy pegged as woefully naive and ignorant when it came to Death Eater values but maybe he did get it and really was a truly evil bastard...  Harry didn't know, but he was determined to find out. It was probably a bad thing that this got him excited but the thrill of the mystery was at least tangible.
"What in the??"
"I sure hope you can cast a patronus..." he prayed, feebly.
"I know he is and it isn't fabled." His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed.
Draco chuckled and kissed him, sweetly.
of me like that..." His voice dropped lower, just barely a whisper on that last part and Draco bore witness to the longing, fear, and trepidation at war behind the emerald green veil. "Draco, there
Harry felt the chill and the sudden feeling of joy being sucked out of the air. They peeked, carefully, around the corner.
Draco suddenly felt incredibly stupid for never once considering that Potter, the man he had always labeled lucky and undeserving of all the love and attention and favor that he got since starting Hogwarts, was actually abused for practically all of his life before he met him. He felt like absolute shite.
"What was the one stipulation that we agreed upon when I adjusted these wards to include you?" he hissed.
Everyone he told seemed skeptical, in fact, but Draco's wretched cause leaving his newborn cousin an orphan was the only common thread he could find in the three examples and, being a good Auror, that left him with no choice but to conclude that all signs pointed to Draco Malfoy being more complex than anyone was willing to give him credit for. If he were being honest with himself, he was also terrified to ask Draco about it and find out that he was wrong. But, last night, he'd finally gotten some proof!
the family. I know that you aren't enthused about this union but we fought to keep this family together -- please, don't do anything to destroy it."
Harry paused between bites, his brow furrowing as he really took in his fiancé for what felt like the first time since they'd sat down. Draco looked paler and more fretful than usual and, what was worse, he hadn't even touched his fish and chips.
!" Draco sputtered, horrified and glued to the spot as Potter just marched straight up to the front door of the nearest home without a plan in sight. He jumped when the door wandlessly blew off its hinges as Harry approached and barged on in.
"What do you mean?" he asked as he reached into his bag and pulled out the portable CD player.
"Anavi... I really need to know..." Harry swallowed, not quite sure he was ready to ask the question and receive the answer. Draco reached for his hand and squeezed, reassuringly. "Is Ginny still alive?"
"Oh, why of course. They're in the closet there." She pointed before she turned and walked off.
"Harry, slow down -- Are you talking about Robards' secretary?" He looked confused and doubtful.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco cocked his head to the side and smirked, silver eyes glinting as he studied the man before him. Did he really not know? Sure, he never shouted it from the rooftop back at Hogwarts but it certainly was no secret in the Slytherin house. It was really none of Potter's business but... this could be fun.
Harry smiled, guiltily.
Harry was standing in the middle of the street looking around frantically when he caught up.
"Right. It's time for my lunch break," the dazed masseuse said as she prepared to take off.
Harry reached out hesitantly and grabbed ahold of the gnarled hand. The lift doors opened onto the atrium and Harry watched in awe, marveling at the sheer amount of strategy and detail this plan must have taken as Draco, looking for all the world like a damn good Auror instead of an investment banker, threw the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder into the air and readied his wand.
"You look beautiful!" he said, holding out an arm for her. She blushed as she grabbed ahold of his bicep and they disapparated.
"Ok. So, I'm bisexual and I'm possibly in love with a man who is getting married in less than two weeks but wants to have sex with me and drunkenly admitted to loving me and seems to think it perfectly alright for us to just make the most of the time we
bad at this! You were doing ok sixth year, what on earth happened?" Harry felt his face heat up. "
Harry reached up and caressed his face with his hand, cherishing the feel of the soft, pale skin against his and the way Draco leaned into the touch.
Draco's lips parted as forlorn, grey eyes stared into Harry's.
invite the press this time?" he teased.
"Ollivander might know," he finally suggested. "He was the first to report his missing heirloom but we have more information now. Maybe the other 3 artifacts or families or even the whole Tuesday thing mean something to him."
The hairs stood on the back of his neck as the words registered and realization hit: He hadn't heard a peep from Ginny since their row.
"The root you sent over! From the-- from the case!" he whispered conspiratorially.
Draco reached out to grab both of Harry's hands in his own as it dawned on him what he meant.
He pulled out his wand and wordlessly summoned an assortment of massage oils. When he found one that reminded him of Harry in their quidditch days, he quickly rubbed it into his hands, heating it with the friction and filling the room with the scent of sandalwood. When he rubbed up his back again, his hand glided easily and long, nimble fingers worked to undo some of the knots as he went. Harry did eventually begin to relax into the touch until Draco finally started to massage his neck and shoulders and couldn't resist anymore: he sat down on the narrow space of the part of the seat not occupied by Harry, pressing up against his bum as he leaned in and slowly licked up the curve of his neck with his tongue.
Blaise gave a hearty chuckle. "You're probably right," he said as Draco caught a tin of Sleakeazy's Hair Potion out of the air and rubbed it through his hair which magically went back to it's regular, perfect form.
Draco fought his shiver at the thought of the sweet little old lady getting up to things that were anything but sweet-little-old-lady-ish. Harry, on the other hand, was already on his way out of the door.
"Hmm... well, Harry, it
birds of paradise just yesterday!"
"You have such a lovely family, Harry."
I do know."
"The Merry Chandelier or something ridiculous like that --"
She stabbed the ice cream with her spoon and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
'still the master of the thing'?
"Hey, are you getting off or not, mate?" asked a grumpy wizard at the front of the queue waiting to board the lift.
Harry scoffed at the idea of being sent "home" to a place that would only ever be home again if Draco made it back to him. He turned and marched off, determinedly.
Harry paused, one hand on the wood door of Ollivander's wand shop, and directed a raised, questioning brow his way.
"How much did you give him?" he asked as she lackadaisically handed him the handful of hairs she'd plucked.
Draco didn't really know what he wanted or expected from any of this anymore, all he knew was that he'd never felt like this about anyone. What was hardest about it all was that he actually really cared about Potter and how he fared in this.
man who he knew deserved the world.
! This is supposed to be an office, not a menagerie!"
? He wondered in nervous anticipation.
Jansen smirked as he approached but Harry set his sights on the wand half hidden up the bloke's sleeve. If he could only get him to drop it...
headlines would look like when word got out that Draco Malfoy was involved. He found it hard to think at all, however, when he was suddenly overcome with raw, untampered pain coursing hot through his every nerve! Draco saw stars! He fell to his knees, jaw clenched, eyes watering, but refusing to let free the scream threatening to leave his throat as the
He watched as they made their way to the one long, rectangular table ahead of all of the smaller circular tables dispersed amongst the room. Andromeda and Teddy were already seated there. Teddy, all dressed up in junior dress robes and sporting purple hair tonight, spotted him and waved enthusiastically. Harry smiled warmly as he returned it. Minister Shacklebolt was there, as well, draped in royal red robes and sitting with his wife by his side. He raised a glass in Harry's direction and winked when he caught his eye. Robards' wife was sat next to them with a seat saved for the ornery old man now up on stage and saying things like
Draco stayed a step behind, letting Harry lead the way both because he had no idea where he was going, as well as the fact that it made it easier to sneak glances at the bloke without being conspicuous. Harry's fixed determination was a sight to behold, for sure, and it certainly didn't help the ridiculous fluttering sensation in Draco's stomach or, occasionally, his chest.
"Well......." Harry turned to see Draco grimace guiltily.
." He rolled his eyes, annoyed.
Harry angled his hips again and relished the moan that escaped Draco's lips as he arched his head back. Ok, he must be doing something right, he thought. Draco reached down to guide his hips and encourage him to rock them and Harry bent down to lick at the span of his exposed neck, kissing and sucking a trail up to the soft spot beneath his ear. "Harry..." Draco whimpered and Harry couldn't resist anymore, he began to grind in earnest.
"Well, that's the good news. He got cocky, probably never expected anyone in the wizarding world to discover his muggle life. Apparently, he's found a new muggle boyfriend who's some big shot politico and the cheeky bastard has been showing up on his arm since February! Krafft is believed to be living with the bloke and Aussies Aurors are on their way to the home as we speak!"
Harry let out an exasperated sigh and shot them a terse, apologetic smile as he waved his wand to let it in. Of course this one also carried a letter written on parchment with
Harry ran his fingers through his hair in exasperation, completely dislodging it from its bun. It would have been a beautiful sight, had he not been so angry at him, the way soft black hair tumbled down past his shoulders and framed his face.
Draco Malfoy... Are you really all that surprised that your definitions of
Draco sighed heavily and privately wondered how unfortunate it would be if he rescued the girl only to still wind up in Azkaban for cursing the lot of them.
Draco and Harry exchanged a surprised glance. They turned back to the old man, eager for answers.
"Alright, class!" said Slughorn as he called them to attention. "Today you will be revising the Draught of Peace!"
Blaise was by her side as she pulled away and he and Harry shared a nod.
"Are they..." Hermione turned to them with wide eyes. "Are they more fun than us?!
"I haven't the foggiest, but I do know one thing..." she said, grabbing a handful of cocktail menus.
Draco reached up and his hand found its way back to the nape of his neck and he kissed Harry hard. The faint salty, tangy taste of his own cum was still on Draco's tongue but, for some reason, it just seemed like the sexiest fucking thing and he kissed him harder. Draco had begun jerking his own cock but Harry knocked his hand away and took over, relishing the feel of his cock in his hand. He wanted to be the one to make Draco come. Draco whimpered against his mouth and Harry sped up the tempo, knowing he was close. He felt Draco's cock pulse as creamy, warm cum shot from the tip and across Harry's stomach.
Harry was silent for a few minutes as he looked off into the distance. Finally, his green eyes met Draco's and there was a calm there. "I think I finally can. Thank you, Draco."
"How illegal was that?" Draco whispered.
"Or come to your senses and work it out?" hoped Ron.
"The whole bottle," she sung, devilishly. "He'll be on the shitter for at least a few hours."
"Wait -- don't tell me you believe this nonsense, too?" Katie questioned Bill.

He heard the sound of footsteps shuffling towards the door and a muffled incantation before the door was pulled open and a shock of white blonde hair poked out.
"Obviously I don't plan to just hand it over! Besides, we would have the one advantage of him having no idea who the real possessor of the wand is... As long as he doesn't disarm
Harry bit his lip nervously. "Well... I don't think I could ever..." He paused. What if this was a deal breaker for Draco?
?! Dung, that's oddly specific... where did you get that from?" He raised a sceptical brow.
"Why, hello there," he said, stroking its soft plumage with his knuckle. He carefully untied its note and it hooted happily as he tossed it an owl treat.
Draco raised a brow. "Yes?"
"Well, that certainly explains some things, Potter. When you started going out of your way to be
Shit.
"No. I asked Astoria to handle whatever it is that comes up." He shook his head. He worried his lip like he always did when he was contemplating something difficult. Harry reached out to cusp his chin in his hand and squeezed his cheeks gently to coax it free.
"Potter, did you seriously think that I would take
, on he and Draco's stomach and chest. He felt his arse clench around Draco's cock and it was enough to send Draco over the edge, as well. He rested his sweat covered forehead on Harry's as he stilled and came inside of him.
Jansen/Draco looked at him curiously.
Anavi Chopra, the usually understated executive secretary, shuffled into view wearing a stunningly vibrant royal blue and white embroidered saari. Her hazel eyes went wide when she spotted the raised wand.
"Harry, can you buy me this with your muggle money?" he asked holding out a copy of the
power
Draco chortled and rolled his eyes. "Didn't think it through, again?" he asked with brow raised teasingly. Harry shook his head frantically but Draco's eyes gleamed with amusement and darkened with some warm emotion as he grabbed Harry's chin and leaned in to kiss him passionately. "Yes," he said looking at each face in the room and locking eyes with Ron. "I guess I have a
"Boys, while I am personally glad to see that after all these years you two have
He realized belatedly, as they pulled apart, that he probably sounded rude. "
He watched Lucius' wheels turn as he tried to figure out his next move before, eventually, sighing in defeat.
He started from his thoughts as a handsome, shirtless Aussie bloke sauntered towards him.
Draco tucked a strand of raven hair behind his ear as he thought on that. "Harry... you do realize there are other configurations to that equation, right?"

"Over here! Over here! A photo for the
"It's ok, I don't need your hand I only need your brain!"
"Oh, bugger..." Harry said when he realized that he'd accidentally, wandlessly vanished it.
It was only within the past year that they were able to focus on having an actual relationship that wasn't just her taking care of him. They didn't have that intense passion that you saw in muggle movies but they were doing ok for a good few months. That's why he was surprised that it was when things were finally going well that she had asked for the break. She framed it as being about what was best for him, as she always did, but he had a hunch that it might've really been because she'd wanted a break for a long, long time but was just too afraid to admit it and it wasn't until now that she thought that Harry might be well enough to handle it emotionally.
"No. Never," he said, petulantly, then playfully pushing him before capturing his lips in his.
Draco stared back, stunned.
the one meant to be all breathless and bothered, remember?" he asked as he snaked his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him close.
She stared.
"I have excellent rhythm, Harry," he said as he sat back down beside him on the sofa. He leaned closer and added in a low, teasing voice: "In case you were wondering."
He rubbed at the back of his neck and felt the flush creep up it.
Harry's smiled waned, however, when his gaze landed on his own wife who sat beside the empty chair awaiting him.
She gave him a little smile but hesitated. "Oh, alright! It couldn't hurt," she said as she waved her wand and the document duplicated.
The blonde head turned irritatedly in his direction and then froze.
Harry couldn't hide his shiver at the words. He swallowed, Adam's apple bobbing and mouth suddenly very dry. His cock hardened as he inhaled the intoxicating citrusy smell of bergamot and Draco so very, very close.
details, Potter?"
Draco stood taller and scoffed as he readied his wand.
happily ever after.
The mark doesn't come off -- Believe me, I've tried." Potter's mouth fell open, as Draco gathered his things. "Look, Potter. You don't have to keep saving people, sometimes they have to save themselves. Why don't you take care of
Harry nodded and smiled at him, fondly. "In the flesh."
Ron frowned as he tried to comprehend muggle storytelling. Harry found that one of the funniest parts about his best mates' union was Hermione's continued attempts at introducing Ron to muggle culture. This week, she'd apparently made him watch
! He tried to push down the panic threatening to bubble up and overwhelm him.
"I know, bonkers, right? Well it looks like the bloke had plenty of practice navigating the muggle world," she relayed, bemusedly, as she read from a report. "As you know, we've been baffled because, despite the fact that Thundelarra has a thriving wizarding community and he grew up there, no one seemed to know the bloke! There are some older folks who remember Krafft's grandfather as being a notable member of the community and even his father until he became a young man with a family of his own; but many of the townsfolk thought that the family had long left the area because they'd simply stopped interacting at some point... Aurors just canvased the muggle parts of town and, apparently, the muggle neighbors paint a very different picture of a quintessential family-next-door with a hard-working father, a respectable mother, and the charming young boy who excelled in his studies at the muggle school, played muggle sports, and participated in something muggle kids cult called the
"Oh, come on. Let's buy you a pint," said her friend dressed in a matching neon green fit as they ushered him over to a seat at the bar.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath before he responded.
"You'll find him, Harry," she reassured, frowning as she examined one of the trial documents.
Draco listened with rapt attention as Harry told him all about the muggle auror-of-sorts, James Bond; and, when they watched a countdown of top 90s pop, Draco discovered that he had a penchant for classics by Madonna and American queens like Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey (which Harry thought was fitting since Draco
Harry nodded. "Brilliant!" He smiled.
"Well, by the looks of those big, strong, muscles, I'd say you've clearly been working out... I'm sure you probably just overexerted yourself," he bullshited then shot Harry a wide-eyed, furtive glance and shrugged as the confused man smiled back toothily.
"Well
He walked up the front steps and let himself in. This had been a second home to him since he was 6-years-old and he knew it well.
"Take off your pants," he directed as he shimmied out of his own, revealing a beautifully long, pink, thick cock that flushed against his pale abdomen. Harry did as he was told before taking it in his hand, relishing the weight and feel of it as he stroked and cherishing the way it made Draco's breathing hitch, his grey eyes dark with lust. He leaned in to kiss Harry one more time and then made to stand, taking Harry's hand and leading him so that he was sat at the edge of the bed while he stood before him, pulsing cock at mouth level. Harry didn't know why, but it was intimidating. He eyed it, hesitantly, and Draco bent to plant a kiss in messy black hair, his bun having come half loose.
Ron looked perplexed. ".....Then.... Blimey! How'd he keep going back in time then?!"
She nodded but paused on her way out. "Oh, and sir? I booked your next eight meetings and managed to make you and your wife a reservation at La Sirène for Sunday."
"Huh..." Now that he mentioned it...
Hermione pointed her wand at him and chanted
plans?"
"This is going to sound sappy and maybe a little childish -- I'm sure Bubblykicks would be proud," he scoffed and Draco raised a confused brow. Harry took a deep breath before he continued: "Draco, sex with you... Well... it's filled with love and awkward insecurity and hope and this... this desperate need for safety and belonging and reassurance....." He paused, his brow furrowed. "Quite frankly, it's
"And... apparently it's a lot easier for the DMT to follow the full floo trajectory when you know the starting point..."
He was surprised to find Harry's lips on his and his arms wrapped around his waist in what was, for the second time today, complete abandon -- the guards he had carefully kept in place thrown to the side as he kissed pale pink lips sweetly but assuredly.
he had shook, wracked with sobs and his head in his (probably thoroughly bewildered) Aunt's lap. They had only started to form any relationship at all the week before he'd left for the states and he hadn't talked to the woman since. But when it hit him that life was far too precious to live the lie that his parents insisted that he live and he had to face the very real likelihood that he might lose them
"Woah!" he said, awestruck as he reached out to take the map and observe it closer. Harry hesitated for a moment but handed it over. "This is an amazing piece of magic! Where did it come from? Wait... How long have you had this?" He narrowed his eyes as comprehension dawned on him.
"Parvati?" He half expected her to tell him to leave her alone. He couldn't remember a time that they'd ever had an actual conversation and if he had ever spoken to her, he wouldn't have been surprised if it were only to say something mean because she was a Gryffindor and, let's face it, he
"Quietly strategic and disruptive type?" He smiled, something warm reflected in his eyes.
It had always peeved him that Potter seemed incapable of minding his own business. The fact that he had somehow, inexplicably, become Potter's favorite subject for meddling was only the icing on that particular proverbial cake. When life made sense, it usually meant that Harry was hellbent on foiling Draco in some way. But now, in some bizarre twist of fate, most of Potter's meddling of late involved the green eyed boy either saving Draco's arse or defending it and it drove Draco crazy that he didn't know what to make of it.
Harry groaned when nothing happened for what felt like the thousandth time.
Harry jolted upright and the three best friends all fixed each other with wide eyes before they whipped out their wands, at the ready.
" and "
"It might be nothing but... The whole pureblood family nonsense just made me realize something. Fawley, Flint, Shafiq, Ollivander... These families are all part of the Sacred 28 and, specifically, those who somehow managed to stay completely neutral in both wizarding wars... Well, Ollivander
"Yea... I do, don't I?" He smiled sheepishly.
"Teddy, you know who knows a lot about Doxy Pox and how to avoid it? Your Godfather. I think you should ask him
"Who isn't these days?" he joked. He walked a little to the side and sat down on a step, patting the seat next to him. "What happened?"
He glanced at Harry and was relieved to see that he only looked fascinated and not judgey.
Draco nodded. Potter directed him to sit on the nearest bench and then sat facing him. He cradled his hand gently with one of his own large, rough hands and Draco held his breath as he began to delicately pull out the shards of glass, one at a time.
"Harry. You're doing that thing where you forget to breathe. What is it?"
act, things always fall to shite! Tell me, how are we supposed to trust you when you could keep something like

"Well, how in the

He raked his fingers through his hair.
that he'd been through, he finally knew happiness.
"Because you wouldn't have shown up at all if they had! Really now, Harry." Hermione rolled her eyes, already exasperated from her efforts as she and Ron tried to usher him back towards the front of the room. There, a makeshift stage had been erected in front of that ridiculous
Draco raised a brow at Harry who just shrugged and rolled his eyes.
Harry laid his head back down and contemplated that for a moment. If that was what sex was supposed to be like then what happened in 6th year definitely didn't count. He had always thought himself weird for not being as sex obsessed as some of his classmates. Ron, Seamus and Dean made sexual jokes all the time and he might muster up a fake laugh or two but, really, it made him uncomfortable. If he were honest, the idea of having sex with girls just never came to mind and the thought of having sex with blokes terrified him so much that he just tried not to ever think about it.
Hannah and Daphne were chatting merrily; Greg giggled drunkenly as he leaned against Neville (who looked slightly terrified as he tried to hold up his gargantuan frame); Pansy and Hermione had their heads together, plotting (a frightening sight, indeed!); Blaise was talking a seemingly intrigued Ron Weasley's ear off about getting in on the ground floor to invest in the quidditch world cup; Astoria and Ginny kikied over joining the ex-wives club; and Luna and Rolf were on stage singing some muggle song called
His entry into the Ministry went mercifully smoothly thanks to Hermione's coin giving him access to the toilets.
