"Come." Severus told him lowly and Draco followed him, already feeling a hint of regret swelling as he saw Hermione and Ron watching from behind Shacklebolt and Remus with confused eyes. He only met them for a moment before turning away again.
"Mind yourself." Severus told him darkly. Draco shook his head. This was getting him nowhere. Plus, they were sidetracked from his original question. He had half a mind to redirect them back to it when a light knock followed. He turned to find Harry peering in before giving a small wave. Severus glowered before gesturing him in.
The whole rabbit chase ended up taking several hours. When he sniffed out Hermione once again she was by the lake with homework spread out. She grinned when she saw him.
Similarly, Hermione was fine with Draco telling Ron he was an idiot, but the second Padma said so there were wands out and Harry was desperately trying to play peacekeeper as Draco laughed in the background.
"One," Draco began and watched when Dudley gave Harry one last nod before heading towards the car, "Two-" Vernon and Petunia scrambled after him. Draco shook his head. They really were a horrid bunch. He turned back to Harry.
" She hissed and raised her wand. Draco felt his chest tighten. No. He shoved his wand in his robes and jumped up.
"Come on, Draco," Zoe said when he tried to weasel out of it, "We can still be friends even if you and Theo aren't a thing anymore," she told him, bumping shoulders with him, "Besides, if anything
“We could give him a cursed gift. Like, say it was from an admirer wishing him good luck and when he opens it-”
you to,” He rolled his eyes, “As for your father… the Dark Lord may have forgiven him, but he won’t pass up an opportunity for vengeance. He’ll make you torture him as punishment for his numerous errors.”
“Yeah…Uh, we broke up.” He said, rubbing the back of his neck with a shrug. Ron immediately sat up with wide eyes. There it was.
“So I heard you had a famous celebrity join SPEW.” He said and Hermione whacked his shoulder with her book.
“I think banshees are quite lovely once you get to know them,” Luna piped in. Tristam paused at that, looking her over curiously. Draco was pretty sure Luna and Tristam had met through the DA a few times, but nothing too terribly more than learning jinxes together. “Really they’re only fatal if you make them scream… so don’t make them scream.” She said simply.
In years to come… after future torture, fear, and death… this moment remained one of the most painful of his life.
“Yeah, we know, Draco. Don’t worry. We also have been practicing legilimency so we’ll make sure to study them both to answer all the questions we need to.” She said. Draco nodded a bit nervously. He wasn’t sure how comfortable he was with this, but there was no going back now. “We’ll be the ones stationed at the school, right?”
She called and Draco straightened up to see that Winston had taken the place of the little girl from earlier, making polite smalltalk with the mermaid. “Tell me, who does your bloodtraitor brother think the Heir is?” She asked. Winston turned to her with cold eyes.
No. No, he needed Theo to stay angry. To keep talking about this… because if they kept talking about this then they… they could… they didn’t have to talk about… He looked away, momentarily overwhelmed with everything. Tears were prickling at his eyes. This was the worst thing that could have happened. For a moment, Theo’s anger seemed to completely falter altogether.
"Alright," Harry said, drawing Draco from his thoughts, "You've convinced me. Hopefully, Theo finds out so that his entire stupid lesson on our wedding is useless." He said, looking far too pleased by that than the fact he was getting married (again) to someone as great as Draco. He supposed he would let it slide this time... Theo did sound like he enjoyed being a nightmare of a professor. "Just one condition?"
Great. There was Potter with his bloody hero complex. Rolling his eyes, he stepped back. Montague’s eyes lit up, perhaps sensing an easy target, as Potter stepped forward to hold out his hand - as if Montague would honestly hand the thing over. Draco sure wouldn’t. Not without making him work for it.
Draco froze as he went to stow one of his books in his bag. From beside him Hermione frowned, her eyes flicking from him to where Umbridge stood in the front of the classroom.
“How do I access their magic?” He asked as Harriet peered out from Draco’s bag to slither up and absently poke at the knives. Severus ignored her.
“Draco, we have a treat for you!” Jugson called. Draco rolled his eyes as he entered the dining hall of the manor to see a small group hovering around a heavy oak door on the end of the hall. Draco tensed, “Hey-”
“Harry is being a git to Harriet and brought up the fact she doesn’t have legs,” Draco said. Harriet poked her head out to look at Ron before retreating again. “He’s really gotten rude, hasn’t he? I’m so sorry.” He sighed, patting the top of her head. Draco didn’t go around saying Hedwig didn’t have a hands, did he? It was just plain mean. Ron snorted as he jumped over a few wayward trunks to join them.
“Hm? Oh, dear me. No.” Zoe laughed, “He goes to Durmstrang. We actually can’t be around one another very much. Have you ever seen what happens when good and bad luck collide?” She asked. Hermione opened her mouth, but Zoe didn’t give her much of a chance to respond, “Though, in truth, I think my mum originally planned it that way so she would stop mixing us up.” She chuckled. Hermione tilted her head, “We’re identical.” She added.
"What? Right now?" Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest as he looked Draco up and down, "Seems a bit rude to on Ron and Hermione's wedding day." He pointed out. Draco scoffed. Coward.
Hermione cried in greeting and reached out. Harriet slid over to her wrist, tongue flicking out a few times in welcome. Harry rolled his eyes. He never understood why she liked Hermione so much. "I've missed you. Is Draco here?" She asked, looking around. Harry shook his head.
Draco dragged Ginny to the side, hoping that Harry had a better plan than he did. Two against one, right? They could take down a massive snake that killed people by looking them in the eyes like freaking Medusa.
"We'll talk more later," Draco promised, grinning widely at her. Lavender beamed before straightening up to skip towards class, grabbing Ron's hand for him to follow. Draco watched in amusement as he detached himself from her to whisper something. Lavender frowned, but nodded and headed off towards her classroom without him. Ron turned.
His second year was better. Andromeda had been kind of enough to write him every few weeks. It had been a bit of a weird time with them still trying to get to know one another and learning how best to interact with the other. Then, during his third year it had been Andromeda, Ted, and sometimes Dora too. His fourth year then entailed even more correspondence with Remus and Sirius occasionally thrown in the mix.
"You - I don't want to know. I don't want to know why you were off dismantling illegal crime rings with some random, criminal muggle," he decided, "Though, if we survive this, you are no longer allowed to do anything on your own ever again." He said, shaking his head, "Blimey. Do you hear this? He made a big deal to go off and be a Death Eater and then he fucks off doing muggle crime stuff. Do you hear him?" He asked Hermione who, for once, seemed at loss for words.
"...where are we?" He asked as Hermione turned her attention to Harry's finger now that Ron's hand was wrapped.
"Are you here to kill Voldemort?" Someone asked. Draco fought - very hard - not to roll his eyes. Obviously. What the Hell else would he be here to do? Kill Father Christmas? Harry nodded and the whispers rose. Before he could give a vocal response, someone had stepped forward and placed their wand at his feet. Draco's eyes widened. A few people murmured. Harry, of course, looked confused.
"You wouldn't have let me name him Albus anyways," Harry grumbled and Draco nodded. Absolutely correct. "We might not even be picking out a name. Andi was a bit of a coincidence," he mused and Draco nodded thoughtfully as he glanced at where his daughter was riding Padfoot around while still throwing petals from her basket.
“I sent it to your mom. I’m guessing she left it for you.” He said. Draco nodded, of course. That made sense. “Where is Harriet by the way?” He asked as more of an afterthought. “I haven’t seen her.” He added. Draco grimaced.
“I wouldn’t worry about Fleur or Viktor if they aren’t physically here… plus the kids won’t necessarily matter much. They’d be pawns too. Nothing relevant to winning the war so they're pretty sage.” He said, now tapping his wand against the table in thought. Draco took their pieces off. “Sadie and Tristam.” He decided, “Only if they’re caught though. Assuming that they manage to stay incognito I wouldn’t even spare them another glance - where’s Zoe during all of this?”
“...are you going to award us points?” He asked dryly. Dumbledore smiled. “Told you we would be back here again. Shouldn’t have let us get away with it last time.” He shook his head.
"Is that redhead boy your brother?" Gabrielle asked after Hermione's departure and pointed to where the rest of the Weasleys were were reappearing. Oh. Right. They should probably join them. The Weasleys had all come to show their support for Harry, but once the task started they dispersed to socialize. Draco wouldn't be surprised if Andromeda was here actually... He made a note to look for her or Nymphadora.
“Hey,” Harry said casually when he felt go and absently started playing with Draco’s hands. It was a recent thing he had started doing. Instead of fiddling with his quill or robes he had taken to just using Draco had a human toy. “Did you ever tell Theo that you loved him?”
"Hey," Draco said before they went to walked inside, "Are you sure you should be going with us?" He asked Zoe, looking pointedly at her non-golden appearance. Her eyes narrowed, "This is a rescue mission. If there's a bunch of wayward curses you
“Someone could need help.” Harry said cautiously. Draco threw his hands up in the air. He was about to list all the reasons that someone needing help wasn’t their problem when the door swung open to reveal Neville holding Trevor with wide eyes.
“Ah, well, if there is one thing I’ve noticed over the years… it is that some ambition takes self-preservation, while others take courage. Perhaps the sorting hat knows where our priorities lie,” he smiled. For some reason… Draco wasn’t sure that made him feel better.
they do with him when the war was over? Draco had killed people. Maybe it had been to keep himself alive - to keep his friends and family alive, but did that actually matter? People were still dead and Draco did it. He opened his mouth a few times before feeling his shoulders slump. Jenkins frowned.
“I’m fine.” Draco repeated. Ron looked at him. Then he chewed his lip for a moment. Draco felt a bit of his stomach twist before he finally broke, “I just… after Cassi my parents never mentioned having any other kids. Not once. It kind of felt like if anything happened to me then they were done,” he said and tugged absently at his robes, “I know Rita Skeeter writes a lot of rubbish, but… I guess they could have changed their minds…” He murmured. Ron shook his head.
“Boggarts are something you’re going to come across eventually. You have to know how to deal with them.” He said softly. Draco closed his eyes. “Maybe we can work on it outside of class-”
"Everyone survived. We won that battle." Draco reminded her, "I really don't think your luck had anything to do with it," he said gently. Zoe only shrugged, eyes pinned on the ground. Draco grimaced. Obviously, he had faced the consequences of his meddling last year firsthand. However, it still felt like he was forever finding more around every corner. He had hurt so many people and -
"Harry-" Hermione began, but he waved her off. It was fine. He understood. It was fine. Fine. Totally fine.
"Draco," Hermione finally said, "Before you open that... there's something we need to talk about," she told him softly. Too softly. He felt his concern swell at it. Why was she looking at him like that? "Um, we... we heard yesterday that Malfoy Manor... it went up in flames." She explained, "There was an explosion. I don't really know much else about it." She told him. Draco stared.
“It would seem so… it isn’t as much as what they used to get me though.” He mused. Ron made a face between disgust and alarm. Harry grimaced.
- were bleeding and nursing wounds, but alive. He couldn’t see… there. Hermione and Ron. They were together - both looked hurt. Hermione was on the ground completely still while Ron appeared to be… laughing?
“I still don’t get why you would go to Harry for defense lessons.” Draco grumbled. Ron clicked his tongue.
“Have you heard of occlumency?” He asked. Harry shook his head. “It’s like… keeping people from seeing into your mind.” He said and watched as Harry stiffened, straightening up slightly as his eyes seemed to sharpen onto Draco.
"I... don't know," Harry told him softly, "In that story you told me it... well, it wasn't a good idea..." He mused. Draco pursed his lips.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked, sitting up. “Don’t worry, it isn’t on.” He added with a nod towards the muggle contraption behind them. Neville wasn’t looking at that though. He blinked a few times before speaking.
“I… can… maybe show you how I’m feeling?” Harry suggested, leaning in slightly. Draco could smell spring on him all over again. A million different scents combining into one that was so specifically
“He stayed with me this summer,” Sirius told him. Draco stared. Really? Dumbledore allowed that? “He was… not doing the best these past couple months,” he continued slowly, “With you being gone and all. Surprisingly, Severus reasoned with Dumbledore for it,” he added with a stiff nod towards where his godfather had been sitting at the other end of the table.
He knew Hermione's spell had saved his life, but... he felt utterly defenseless without his wand. As it was, one wand between them felt precarious. Given that Harry wasn't comfortable with Hermione's it proved to be a difficult task.
“Detention, Mr. Malfoy,” Severus told him darkly, “And since you asked… a hundred points from Gryffindor will be taken.” He added as the left side of the room groaned. Draco gave a vague gesture as he folded his arms over his chest. Severus sighed. “....if you stop talking for the rest of class I will give you back the hundred points.” He tacked on.
“Nothing is decided yet,” he said slowly - just as Draco knew he would. After all, Draco was pretty much done for anyways… but there was no way his father would announce it in front of a room full of people. “Dobby should have still been responding to you.” He added. The house elf flinched with muttered apologies.
It was a little funny at first, but Draco ended up becoming his dedicated person to look out for him now. Hermione said it was because he had a good heart (ugh,
“I mean, it’s got to have been a rough summer… then with the dementors and, well, his aunt and uncle.” He said. Draco nodded. He had hoped with Voldemort back they would have found somewhere better to go… apparently not. Apparently it took a dementor attack to get him out of that hellhole. “Are you sure you’re okay?” Ron asked, putting a hand on his shoulder, “With Theo and all?” He asked.
“I think so,” he shook his head, “They’ll probably get back together. I think they both just need to figure stuff out. She mentioned that she and Harry had been talking about something and she wanted to test something out?” He added, “So, I guess they’re still friends.”
“I’ll watch it with you.” He suggested and despite himself, Draco found himself flushing a bit. Then frowning. Oh
of them says there are three objects out there that would keep Voldemort from dying..." He trailed off.
want to be honest. About everything. So when they ask you something you kind of have to deflect. Like… they asked me if I was loyal to them and I said I was loyal to my family and beliefs. That sort of thing.” He shrugged.
“How do they even define a bloodtraitor through that anyways? Seems like a brand of magic that could go a bit wonky to me.” He grumbled, “I just think - ah, Weasley.” He cut himself off and Draco looked over to see Ron walking over.
like Harry.” He said and Hermione tilted her head, “Okay, but… it’s a sensitive topic.” He grumbled. Hermione frowned, possibly noting the subtle change of demeanor. “You can’t tell
"Sorry, mate." He said and patted the side of his arm, "You had a nice go of it though. We'll have talk later if you live."
“And just you wait until I tell you about Neville Longbottom,” Draco continued as the rest of the hall began to fall silent, “I saw him read a potions book
"Hey, kid! Yeah, Trevor had to leave. He said something about basketball and then left. He gave me a gun though!" He added brightly, holding up one of Trevor's magical guns, "I tried to shoot the snake guy a couple times, but it looks like you and your boyfriend took care of it with you're fancy sword," he mused and then turned back to Ted, "Can I see the magic baby?" He asked. Dora peered at him curiously.
“...hi.” He said, offering a wry smile. Severus (unsurprisingly) did not return the gesture. Harry paused - looking warily between the two as Severus marched up to them, face torn between an expression of pure anger and pure relief. That was kind of touching.
"So, like," Draco began, "Are we just... not going to point out he's been in love with Hermione for years?"
“...you haven’t.” Harry muttered, going back to his potions book. Draco looked up at the ceiling. “Besides, I didn’t think it would matter. You like Severus and he’s a spy too so I figured he would know how to help you.”
“They won’t. I’ll make sure it’s anonymous.” He said and then tugged at his sleeve with a sigh, “What about you?” He asked. Draco shot him a questioning look. “Your dad. Are you going to say anything?” He asked.
just Hermione… “I’m, um,” he started and bit his lip. “Just thinking. About things.” He said… because
“Yeah, but I bet you don’t want to ask anyone from your school since they would take it seriously and try to follow you around when you get back home.” He pointed out, “Then you’ll get accused of leading men on. Not a good look for a veela descendent if you want to be taken seriously in the future.” He said. Fleur tensed at this - eyes sharpening for a moment before giving a slight tilt of her head.
"You got them arguing about it now. I'm not sure how they can still quarrel after being dead this long but they've managed - don't you two have a go at me!" Remus gasped, spinning back around. "If anything I should have a go at
Bellatrix’s knives, according to Severus, often used dark magic to fulfill the wielder’s needs. If you wanted to cause someone a lot of pain then the cuts would burn. If you wanted to kill someone then the cuts would lace themselves with poison. If you wanted someone
"What's that mean?" Remus asked, amused. There was still a note of trepidation in there. "This is my war too. I want my son to grow up free."
"Not as a rat, he can't. He needs the mark," he said and stood up, tucking the jar under his arm so he could offer Harry an arm, "You know, Remus is here too, Peter. I'm sure he'll be
, she sneered, wrinkling her nose, "Poisoning the mind of even poor little Draco," she said and Draco inwardly rolled his eyes as he quickly muttered healing spells. "Did he tell you all the fun we had together?" She asked, licking her lips. Andromeda's eyes narrowed.
“How did you know?” He asked and then made a face, “That’s an awful password.” He added, wrinkling his nose. Draco shrugged.
“Draco,” Lupin interrupted and stepped forward to grab his shoulders. “It’s okay.” He said gently. “Hey… it’s okay.” He said and bit his lip, “There is something I want to see though… Do you mind me opening it back up?” He asked.
by Harriet so he knew there was going to be a teary farewell for when she was no longer allowed to play with her on a daily basis. Draco kind of doubted it would be a very long separation though. He saw the way Fleur had been eying up Bill Weasley. An interesting choice, but hey. Who was he to judge?
...did some stranger just assault him by pretending to be his boyfriend? No. He mentioned treacle tart. It was definitely him.
This fucking guy. Draco laughed. He couldn't help it. He couldn't. Fawkes tilted his head at him, perhaps sense Draco's rising disbelief.
“Harry would kill me.” Sirius said flatly, “Do you remember when we had that encounter last month?” He asked. Draco nodded. Voldemort had sent him on the mission to confront the Order. It had probably been a test to see if he would actually hurt any of them. He had managed to prioritize… poor Emmaline Vance did unfortunately end up in St. Mungo’s for a good three weeks due to him.
“Annoying me,” Draco said and held up a hand, “I’m not sure for what time. I just know you annoy me a lot.” He told him and climbed towards the deck before Harry could try and drown him.
“You killed a Death Eater for him. You put your life on the line for him.” He shook his head, “And you ultimately paid the price when he died. You can’t keep punishing yourself for it. Besides, you’ve already saved people. Snape’s a double agent and I don’t think he’s done what you’ve done.” He reasoned. It was honestly a little alarming how he was just... accepting this information with barely any reaction. Draco thought back to their conversation a couple days ago under the tree.
“No,” Draco scoffed and glanced back at the wardrobe, “But… I would rather people not jump to assumptions if something… unexpected comes out.” He muttered and ran a hand through his hair. Lupin came closer, sitting next to him with thoughtful eyes.
“Nonsense,” she interrupted and tilted her head, “Let’s get a good look at you. God, you look just like Narcissa,” she smiled softly and put a finger under his chin, “I’m sorry, this year probably wasn’t what you expected,” she added with pursed lips.
“What can we do?” He asked. Harry opened his mouth, but at that moment Cedric Diggory came by to help Zoe up, leading her towards the other end of the castle. “Uh, hey - DIGGORY!” Draco warned when he saw another cloud forming above them. A rumble followed before a sharp jolt of lightning crackled down. With a flick of his wand, Cedric sent it back into the sky.
“Bye,” Draco smiled back weakly and jutted his chin out at the older Nott. “Winston,” he spoke coolly, and the older boy stared down at him. He looked quite a bit like Theo with his black hair and green eyes. The only difference was while Theo was unkept and quite honestly a bit of a mess, Winston always had his hair slicked back meticulously and was the pinnacle of well dressed.
Naturally, he wanted to be included so he informed his aunt that he usually also had wine with dinner (which was very much a lie). There had been a bit of a pause before Andromeda just… gave in. Really, he should have known better looking back on it. His aunt was hardly one to give into anything.
And by 'short-lived' he meant that him and Harry had maybe a week together tops before they were found out.
"Here," he said, turning back to Hermione, "I can take watch." He said, holding out his hand. Hermione looked him over. She seemed torn between agreeing and arguing. He could see the fatigue hinting at her features. They had been traveling for so long and the damn locket hadn't been helping. "I'm okay. You sleep and I'll figure out something." He said, trying to sound calmer than he felt. Hermione didn't look convinced, but warily dropped the locket in his hand before bringing out her wand. Harry took both, inwardly cursing Nagini's attack for the destruction of his own.
Harry, for his part, seemed more preoccupied with shouting at Montague than watching the bludger. He spurred his broom forward to grab at his arm, yanking him back in the nick of time as the bludger zipped past.
“You’re leaving soon. You’re not going home.” Draco told him, voice tightening. “You’re going someplace safe. Far from your family. You won’t take me with you.”
with me being a little selfish? They're my parents! Am I supposed to sit back and do nothing to help them?"
Maybe even more!" Harry shot back, voice rising, "Do you know how much could have happened to him in that time?"
“Bellatrix,” Draco said with a shrug as Harry made his first move on the chessboard. A bad one. Ron quickly countered, trapping the pawn with his knight. “Bellatrix Lestrange. She’s in-” he started, but was cut off by something shattering behind them. Draco turned just in time to see Neville Longbottom with a broken cup of spilled hot chocolate.
Draco growled back, voice rising slightly, "And you know what? Fuck you for thinking you're innocent in all of this," he said and Harry's brows shot up in feigned amusement as he let out an mordacious scoff, "No, seriously. What would have happened if I told you that I wanted to help them? You would have bitched about it then too. And guess what? The reason why nobody tells you anything is because you never know how to deal with shit. You didn't tell anyone about Umbridge. It would have been so simple to just ask for help, but we had to notice it ourselves. Even now you won't tell someone who can actually fix the fucking problem! We could have told someone about the stone during first year instead of going after it ourselves, you and Ron could have told literally any witch or wizard that you missed the train instead of driving a
“How you survived is… frustrating,” Moody told him, “After everything. Me putting your name in the fire, all the effort that went into leading you along-” He began and when Draco kept his wand up, cut himself off. “How are you still awake?” He asked, confirming his suspicion that Moody did, indeed, try to drug him. Relief flooded his chest. Draco watched as Moody went for his own wand.
Secretly, Draco sometimes agreed… he just liked Molly too much to ever say so. Plus, Fred and George might just kill him under the guise of a prank if their last name was ever associated with the word ‘boring’ again given their new enterprise.
Mostly he, Ron, and Hermione were trying to iron out their plan with Griphook on how to rob one of the best guarded banks in the world, but honestly Harry wasn't that interested. He was interested in the fact his boyfriend hadn't said a single word since he had woken and couldn't be in the same room as him. Hermione had made some progress with him. He wouldn't be within ten feet of her, but at he didn't mind seeing her. The same couldn't be said for Harry.
Not for Draco, obviously, but… well, maybe it was something to do with the Chamber of Secrets? It was hard for him to play the concerned parent role when he wasn’t really a parent… or concerned. Draco knew his father pretty well and was positive the man was enjoying the situation more than concerned... and yet. Still. He was here. Trying to get Dumbledore out of the school and the Ministry of Magic involved.
“Which one should I show him?” He asked and Ron popped up with the demon twins. Honestly. It was ridiculous how they somehow just
Draco looked at them all. He wondered how he must look to all of them. If he was different. He must be. He had to be after this summer. Swallowing, he walked inside to where an empty seat remained before grabbing the watch again and squeezing again. It ticked lowly in response.
“Well, I got Crookshanks and I know you miss Ether...” Hermione said with a shrug. Draco internally faltered at that. He missed his family’s eagle owl. Both because she had been a good friend growing up and also because her absence meant no word from his family. He looked down at where Harriet and Harry were both in some kind of silent staredown and smiled.
"Thanks, Draco," he said, a bit quietly and with more sincerity than usually reserved for him. Draco offered a small smile back, "I'm sorry I kept stealing your soap this year-"
“I guess,” Draco told her and shook his head, “Thank you. For everything.” He said and Andromeda smiled before squeezing his arms tightly and leaving in the same direction her sister had gone.
"Does that mean it's working?" Draco asked, fighting back a grin. It most definitely was. He could tell by the look in Harry's eyes.
Draco frowned. He had never felt that way… not before Hogwarts at least. What did that mean? That Sirius had something inherent inside of him that led him towards right over wrong? Why didn’t Draco have that?
"A dragon," Ron was muttering, "A bloody dragon!" He grumbled and sat up with a wince, "Nobody is ever allowed to ask me to do any favors ever again. I rode a dragon out of a bank for the sake of the wizarding world. I've done
“Draco’s right,” Hermione agreed calmly and Harry rolled his eyes. They were such an obnoxious shade of green, Harry’s eyes. Draco had always felt infuriated by them since they were the exact shade of green the Slytherins wore. It was as if fate thought he needed a constant reminder of the ‘what ifs’ in his life. They would have been very pretty if Draco didn’t hate them so much.
This a/n got so long. I'm sorry. Year 4 is next week! This is the last two-chapter years. Now we're moving up to 3 per a year! Yay!
“You know, one might say you are even more qualified than them in the matters of beheading,” Draco told him with a slight shrug, “Forty-five hacks? I bet most of them only needed one or two to take their heads off,” he sniffed as Nicholas gave a fierce nod of agreement. “I bet they are only bitter that their deaths were so much less spectacular,” he said. Nick beamed.
fancy being the first person to take her on. Sure enough, one of the Death Eaters stepped forward only to be immediately taken down. Draco shook his head in silent awe.
"I... I'm sorry," he said, daring another glance at Andromeda, "And... you gave up so much for me..." He managed, eyes flicking to his father. "I'm sorry. I didn't-" He began and the words left him. A hand touched his back and he turned to see his mother standing behind him. He gave her a shaky smile, "I'm talking to father," he told her. She nodded. "Andromeda and Cassi are here too." He added.
Ah, yes. Target acquired. Shoving aside his mourning, he marched out, leaving a very concerned trio of friends behind him.
of confidence.” He said, grimacing. Poor Hermione. He had expected it to happen, but it still sucked that it did. Harry glanced over at where Lavender was feeding Ron some grapes and made a face. “Pretty sure they’ll be going to Slughorn’s Christmas party together.” He sighed. While Slughorn had been
And now they were apparently stopping his godfather from stealing the sorcerer’s stone to bring back the Dark Lord. Draco still wasn’t pleased with the fact Hermione had set the man on fire at one point, but he had at least hoped they might see that Severus wasn’t the type of person to just try his hand at necromancy.
"I do," Theo said, eyes flicking him up and down, "If he knows you're there then he'll be there. You got the stone out of the mirror last time, right? He'll think that you'll be able to get the wand out of the mirror. Plus, you know, he wants you dead." Theo shrugged. Harry gestured to him in return. That was a very fair point. "Alright, so we're able to control the battle completely then. That also means we can decide the place. If we have enough time it can be someplace that we'll set up advantages. Secret hideouts, traps, things like that." He shrugged.
“What about you, Pansy?” Zoe asked and plucked a pear from the table. “You know, if you tell us how Rita keeps getting her information, I’ll call you pretty too.” She purred. At that, Pansy’s face went dark red. She slammed her food away from her before stalking off.
"You blew up the mansion, didn't you?" He asked her quietly. Slowly, her eyes lifted to his. "Was... was father still alive when you did it?" He asked.
"Eh, whatever," Jenkins yawned, "Are you here to kill me?" He asked, tilting his head, "Like an angel of death or something?" He mused. It was then that Draco realized he had put on his mask before entering. There was a stab of annoyance at the realization his age had been deduced by voice alone before he removed it. Jenkins frowned at him. "Oh, you're a fucking ghost."
Draco inwardly smiled. They might not all get along, but the fact Fleur already called the Weasleys her family told him that there wouldn’t be trouble between them for long. If there is one thing he had learned over the years… if you accepted the name Weasley then you were one of them.
“Let’s argue about something else.” He said and Harry paused in clutching his book protectively to blink at him.
“I can do that,” she said and tugged at the end of her hair thoughtfully, “You’re going to need to figure out how many kids and what we’re going to tell their families.” She warned. Draco thought back to Winston and nodded solemnly. He turned to his mother.
Walburga and Orion Black hated Sirius. The house knew that and acted accordingly... but Draco's connection to the Black family wasn't through Walburga and Orion. It was through his mother and the fact that he was getting nice blankets and soft pillows and bloody snacks appearing in his room meant that she still cared about him.
. Draco kind of doubted Dumbledore would take care of anything... part of him suspected he already knew before anybody else.
“Don’t be stressed.” Theo murmured to him as he gave a wry grin. They were just entering the village and nobody had bloody
Draco snapped his teeth, giving a low growl at the insult. Neville only smiled in return before kneeling down next to him. He had been initially hesitant in letting anyone see his animagus form… but it
“I have a message for you,” Severus finally said and reached into his desk to pull out a letter. “Not for you exactly,” He amended as he handed it over, “For the... friend I suspect you will be visiting soon.” He added. Draco’s heart momentarily stopped.
"Another inferius?" He said, flicking his wand so the body levitated. Why Donovan didn't think to do this himself was unclear. As it turned out, clever Death Eaters weren't always common.
“Rumor has it she’s already going with someone,” Ginny told him, “She didn’t say who though. Probably waiting to show whoever it is off as a sort of grand reveal.” She added, rolling her eyes. Draco pretended not to be listening as he raised his book a bit higher. It was then he noticed Hermione staring at him. He raised the book even higher.
"It probably is something that served him well as a Death Eater," Draco said, "He has more reason than most to hate muggles." He said and shook his head, "What's the book even matter now? We have other things to figure out." He said. Hermione pursed her lips.
“What does that mean?” Theo said, shoving him back. “What did they do with him?” He asked and his eyes fell to the scars on Draco’s neck. Perhaps he sensed a connection, but couldn’t find the missing link.
Either way, it meant most of the time nobody spoke during breakfast… which was unfortunate on days like today. Harry was in a pretty foul mood. As ridiculous as it was, the whole Heir of Slytherin thing was beginning to get to him. Perhaps, Pansy’s suspicion was finally making him crack. Either way, it was pathetic to watch as he miserably played with his porridge, while others whispered as they passed.
“I don’t know,” Draco grimaced, “Because I cared about you. Maybe I kind of still do. I just… think that maybe I would be in a similar position if I got sorted in Slytherin. Maybe if someone offered me a chance to leave…” he began and swallowed. He had no idea, in truth, what he would do or believe if things had been different. “I just want to give you a chance.” He decided to go with.
being in the midst of attention. He didn’t expect to be the center of everyone’s world either. However, despite his ridiculously humble attitude, he was
"What is the summoning charm, Derek?" She asked. The boy opened his mouth then paused. "Astoria, what is the summoning charm?"
actually give them a hundred points when class ended. Maybe he really was trying to make amends...Still, Draco had other things to deal with than his temperamental godfather.
pretty great. It had been such a triumph when they first heard her talk... Now they couldn't seem to get her to stop.
There was a pause before the both started laughing. Draco wasn’t sure what the answer was. He didn’t particularly care. If he was the hundredth person Harry said he loved that would be fine as long as there was nobody after. He got the feeling Harry was thinking the same.
It was becoming a bit of an unfortunate habit… playing peacekeeper between his friends and godfather that is. It seemed to be beyond all of their capabilities to be well-mannered around one another despite Draco’s constant interference. However, he would admit that since the Sirius Black debacle… he had been more, uh, biased as of late in siding with his friends.
“Yeah,” he mumbled and stepped closer, “My parents. Ron… Ron couldn’t see them. He saw us winning the house cup and some other stuff,” he said slowly, as if he wasn’t sure he should give Draco a detailed telling of Ron’s deepest desire… it sounded stupid anyway.
"Draco used to bring me pudding," he said simply and shook his head, "Plus, if my kids were involved in some weird war I would want people to help them out no matter what. Magic or not. So... yeah, bring it on." He said simply and shouldered up next to them. Everyone turned to Draco.
When Draco said he wanted to play quidditch this year, he had imagined… you know. Playing quidditch. Not this nonsense. Harry, as usual, was in the midst of trouble. He wasn’t sure why nobody was stopping the game considering that bludger was clearly out for him. The weasel twins were doing their best, admittedly, but Draco could tell their guarding was irritating Harry.
“You were a dramatic storyteller.” Draco told him when they re-emerged from the pensieve. Harry smiled, shoving his hands in his pocket to stare thoughtfully at the swirling liquid still in front of him.
"This is the godfatherly wisdom I'm going to need. Thank you." He said lightly and Sirius snorted as he leaned forward to ruffle his hair.
“It’s obvious,” Hermione told him, tongue stuck out in concentration as she tried to sew something resembling a hat together. “You two fight because it’s easier than actually sorting out your feelings for one another.”
Draco had actually been in Gringotts for a few minutes to join them when he finally escaped Fleur's overprotective clutches only to then see a dragon burst through the ceiling.
“You know,” he said and held out his hand, “I don’t really fancy going to class anymore. Lockhart doesn’t actually teach anyways.” He said and Ginny gave a small smile at that. “I’m going to read some more about muggles. Do you want to come with?” He asked. Arthur liked muggles well enough. Maybe Ginny did too.
“I don’t like it,” Harry was insisting to Ron and Hermione one night. Draco paused by the doorway to the common room to listen. “Zabini is up to no good. Are we just going to… leave him alone with Draco? Or
“Yeah. He’s with Neville.” He said and Draco frowned. Right. At the beginning of the year Moody’s unforgivable curse lesson seemed to have shaken him more than Harry. “He’s helping him with some herbology stuff before Hermione finds them and makes them both join SPEW.” He said and Draco clicked his tongue. Ah, SPEW. He wondered if Viktor had been introduced to Hermione’s most recent political lobbying. The idea of the huge Bulgarian listening to Hermione prattle on about house elf rights made him smile. The next time Draco saw him, he was going to tell him the fastest way to Hermione’s approval was to wear a SPEW badge… Dear God, please let Viktor Krum walk around wearing a SPEW badge. Please.
He had made fun of Harry just jumping on Quirrell in their first year. Now, look at him. Just bloody jumping on top of Death Eaters. It was a damn shame. He supposed that while Bellatrix could probably block any spell he sent her way, she couldn't block a fifteen-year-old launching himself at her. Well, she could if she was expecting it maybe. Draco was pretty sure nobody was expecting this though. Least of all Draco himself.
"Oh, yeah," Harry laughed darkly, "We all know how much the Pureblood Prince himself should have been in Slytherin."
Voldemort gasped. It almost looked like he was melting into the ground. Harry ripped out the sword. It was doused in red and black. Right. Draco had almost forgotten the sword had absorbed all that basilisk venom from their second year. That was probably why it was (supposed to be) so handy in killing horcruxes in the first place. Voldemort gave a scream of pain, but it was cut off by Harry bringing down the sword again. This time, when the sword would have plunged into the back of Voldemort's skull, there was a cracking sound and he collapsed into nothing.
"...and that's when we jumped off the dragon into the lake," Hermione was saying and fixed him with a baffled look, "How did you find us anyways?" She asked, looking around nervously. Draco swallowed his food. He looked for the words and was a little frustrated when they didn't come. Instead he took the watch from around Harry's neck and tossed it to her. He tried to put all the explanation he could into it... well, given that it only allowed you to transfer feelings it wasn't quite sufficient, but... well, hopefully it worked.
"Thanks, Molly,” he said and leaned down to kiss the side of Harry’s head without messing up his rarely respectable hair. ”See you later, Mr. Malfoy,” he said and Harry sighed.
If he considered his week to be bad at that point, then he needed to really lower his standards on what a good week looked like because it just got worse. In all honesty, it was a bit of his own fault. He had been suspicious when an owl swooped by, dropping a package in front of him during lunch. Neville had even frowned at it.
“I’m a parselmouth?” Harry interrupted, effectively ending the argument. Draco ran a hand over his face.
Having just turned nine, Gabrielle wasn't old enough to go to school yet. This meant she had lots of time to write Draco. Every. Single. Day.
Ted grabbed him and pulled him into a hug. Draco hugged back, burying his face into his shoulder as he tried to hold back the tears threatening to rise... again. Draco hadn't realized he had the ability to cry so much until today.
“I know,” he said softly, “What I need you to know is that everything we decided… it wasn’t for appearances, Draco. I do hope one day you can see that.”
"Do you?" He asked and snapped his fingers, "Hey! Hufflepuff in the back!" He called, "You're not here to stare at Beaxbatons students. Keep your eyes up here." He said and turned to Harry, "You let this happen?"
“What is that?” Hermione finally asked and Draco looked down to see he was fiddling with the watch again. Ah. He let it go so it fell against his chest. “You didn’t have that before, did you?”
“Oh, yeah?” Draco asked and grabbed the sword. “Maybe I’ll kill you with it first.” He hissed and launched forward. This time, he made sure to think about where he was aiming and...well, ideally he had wanted to get the heart, but considering Riddle was the size of a 17-year-old and Draco was twelve… well, it moved more towards his stomach and just kind of went upwards. Interestingly enough, Riddle seemed pretty pained by this action. Draco hadn’t been sure since he was technically a memor- wait. He turned, seeing the diary beside Ginny glow as he yanked the sword down, stumbling back.
...almost. He didn’t mainly because she hesitated, eyes flickering over him for a moment. Draco’s ire rose back up when she stayed indecisive. Part of him just wanted to leave. It wasn’t like he needed to be here anyways with his grades -
“But you’ve already deviated from their normal, Draco,” Ron said, completely ignoring him, “And eventually you have to realize whatever person you become… that’s on you, mate.”
“You’re such a Gryffindor,” he said as he watched Sirius chow down on a chicken leg. “Being here is stupid.” He scolded and Sirius glanced up with a quick, mocking face.
Pansy leaned back. She had gotten much prettier over the years, he realized. Her face had filled out so that the features weren’t as squashed together. Now that she wasn’t scowling at him, he could see that maybe (just maybe) someone might actually like her… you know, if you could get past her bigotry and bad attitude.
“You know,” Draco said as he looked around the room dejectedly, “We pass by our deathday every year without anybody fussing.”
“Fred and George have worked very hard for this. Don’t be a brat.” Dora said as she dug out some coins to pay for Draco’s small library behind them. “Besides, I think it’s brilliant! Not to mention perfect for a time like this. Humor is good during dark times.” She reasoned. Draco made a face. Now seemed like an awful time for pranks, but whatever.
"Well, we're suspicious," Harry informed her. "Teddy mentioned two moms so..." He shrugged. Draco shoved his head so he was facing forward. Dora groaned.
Also! Now that Draco is a semi-decent person we get into the next stage of his development (: I think some of you have guessed what that might entail, but we'll get to see it more in action very soon. Also, Fleur is an underrated character. That is all.
.” He shot back, hiding a grin. “I bet you would be more freaked out than I am.” He added. Theo gave a stoic nod.
"Shh," Ted cut him off with a shake of his head, "I wouldn't go around with any sort of blaming yourself. I don't think she'll come back as a ghost, but I truly believe she can find a way to haunt us even without that Resurrection Stone," he said solemnly. Draco considered. That was a perfectly valid concern. "If anything, we must live our lives in fear knowing that she can probably see all of our bad decision making and tally it up for whenever we join her." He grimaced.
"If you somehow run out of these I'll try to bring more," Snape said, letting Harriet slide back up his sleeve. Harriet paused to give Harry one last scathing look before disappearing once more, "Perhaps try to get the sword to work as well if you're running low." He added. Harry nodded. Honestly, there were a good ten fangs in there. Considering there were only three more horcruxes left there should be more than enough, but Harry learned the hard way not to count on... well. Literally anything.
“Hey,” he said and put the hat back on the stool. Harry peered curiously at it, eyes dancing in between Draco and the hat before meeting his eyes. “I was just checking in. Seeing if that thing still even worked.” He told him, stepping away from the stool. Harry raised an eyebrow.
“DRACO!” Neville shrieked, effectively silencing everyone within a good hundred yards, “I DID IT!” He yelled, holding up a rather hideous looking plant. Draco sat up.
that!” He whispered, a bit panicked. Hermione, Ron, and Harry were one thing… not ideal, but forgivable. Dumbledore told him from the beginning that they could know if the moment was right and he wouldn't hold it against him. However, he had to
"Well, so can I," Andromeda said, standing up, "Or, how about this - Nymphadora can take everyone here to the next safe house and after we drop these three off we'll travel to join you together." She said with a nod towards Astoria and Daphne. Both girls nodded while Tonks pursed her lips - a little dismayed at having been left out of the action. "Very good." She decided and walked over to gently shake Hermione up. Tonks leaned forward.
“I wouldn’t leave you,” Draco said before the words were even fully processed. Harry glanced over at him. “I mean, I might not be able to be around all the time, but… you know I would never leave you, right? You know that. After everything… you… you just have to know that.” He said slowly. Harry was staring at him, eyes fixed on him with an intensity that Draco wasn’t really sure how to receive. It made his heart do something in his chest that might have been a health concern in any other circumstance. “Besides,” Draco coughed, “I would look brilliant as a Death Eater. Have you seen the tattoos?” He asked.
“Uh… I mean, you can shoot it for fun,” Harry said as Draco stared back blankly, “But other than that… yeah. You hunt animals with some. I think that’s a different type though-”
"I don't think it would have worked with any mirror. Besides, I... kind of wanted to know what I saw in it," Theo admitted, almost too lowly to hear. Blaise gave him a perplexed look. "What?"
“I went off on him during our third year,” Draco shrugged, “Maybe he was thinking about some of the stuff I said… I didn’t ever mention their first names though. I’m pretty sure he knew your mother.” He added. Harry blinked. “I don’t really know the details, but… some of the stuff he says. I think he knew her well, actually. I know he hated your dad and stuff, but it might have been different with her.”
"I really wish I knew how to help you with this very clear cry for help," he told her. She stuck out her tongue while putting an arm on Neville's shoulder.
” He said, cutting himself and she nodded. For some reason, she looked like she was about to cry too.
"Right," Draco said, shaking his head and gesture them to walk together down a hallway to get away from the crown, "I should also help organize some of this. When should we-"
“They are not in any danger. If they are not retrieved within the hour they will be returned unharmed.” He said. Draco remained unimpressed. Though there was a hint of relief there as well. Hermione and Ron were safe at least.
“Here. Enjoy the work of whoever the bloody Marauders were.” He spat out. Severus’ eyes widened for a moment as he stared down at the parchment. “I don’t think
“A temporary truce that will be demolished the second we both get what we want.” He said and went back to writing something in front of him, “Now get out. I won’t be allowing you to steal from me again.”
"You're pretty talented for a Death Eater," Harry called lightly and then switched his point attack to send a jinx towards Goyle (who had gotten a smidge too close to Sirius). Sirius, for his part, was still using the knife Draco had let him have to ward off his attackers with a vengeance Draco was a little concerned by. It probably had something to do with Regulus, "Who taught you that reductor curse?"
about him. “I must say, your first year at Hogwarts does not seem to be what anyone expected, Mr. Malfoy,” he hummed and picked up a few candies. It was then that Draco realized that his bed was swarmed with cards and sweets. “Ah, yes. You and the others have caught the attention of your classmates for your valiant efforts,” he smiled.
“She can,” Harry said and clapped him on the shoulder. Draco tried to turn around again, but Harry yanked on his arm impatiently. “Look, she wouldn't normally, but we both know you wouldn’t walk away if Nott caused trouble-”
“There’s only enough for one of us,” Harry said after Draco had gone through Snape’s ludicrous riddle of poisons and potions. “Do you know which one takes you back?” He asked, gesturing to the purple flames behind them. Draco nodded absently. “Maybe you should go with Ron and Hermione and I’ll take this,” Harry said, looking at the meager amount of liquid. Draco snorted.
“Oh,” Hermione said, a bit eagerly, “You know, muggles actually looked at the genetics of twins and their chromosomes very closely and found that even if girls and boys look alike they aren’t actually identical. Technically, you can only be identical if you’re the same sex, which is
Remus warned. Draco looked at Sirius warily. That was... maybe good? During his time and Bill and Fleur's house, Draco's snooping had him stumble upon a particular confrontation between Peter Pettigrew's animagus and Sirius. Draco hadn't stuck around to see the ending, but he had decided rather quickly that on the rare instances Sirius was actually upset... he would not stand in his way.
"Hey," Ron greeted, "I made - okay," he said when Draco scooped up a few slices of bacon. When was the last time he ate without the concern of being poisoned? Granted, Fleur had made him quite a bit of food, but... the world had been cloudy then. It was hard to really describe. Detached, maybe? No, that would mean he couldn't feel anything. He definitely was hopped up on fear and stress - whispers haunting the back of his mind that it was all another trap. A trick. A way to make him talk.
“It’s fine. It’s… not like anything can come of it anyways. I just wish I hadn’t realized it like… you know, like
“Do they now?” He asked, almost a little sarcastically, which was a little strange to see on someone like Voldemort. “Unsurprising, given you had spent your years battling my attempts to return and trying to attack my servants.” He said coldly. “I rather liked Crouch. I was displeased to hear you had a hand in his demise.”
“Draco,” Theo sighed and raised a hand to brush his cheek lightly. Draco flinched. “What’s happening right now?” He asked. Draco looked at him. This was his worst nightmare. Several of his worst nightmares combined. “What happened to your neck?” He added, touching the scars.
“...ready for wha-?” Harry began, but cut himself off when he caught sight of Hermione and Draco both standing within the group of champions. “What?” He asked blankly. Hermione waved excitedly as Krum gave a bemused smile. Draco responded by simply shrugging when Harry met his gaze.
He was briefly reminded of Hermione's askance about starting the DA after learning Sirius was for it. Normally, he might point out that Sirius didn't often
"I only save Master Black because of his brother," he decided and without another word disapparated again. Harry snorted. The sound of the sea caught his attention - salt clinging to the air so that his sense felt more alive than they had in weeks. Sirius also seemed to enjoy it as he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply.
. Is that what you want me to say?” He asked without meeting his eyes. Draco blinked a few more times.
him. Harry seemed to be the only one considering some sort of helpful retaliation only to grab his hand with a sigh. "You're not allowed to leave me." Draco warned him.
Fleur and Gabrielle also sent him some macaroons along with letters from both. Apparently Bill had spent the holidays with them. Draco was sorely tempted to bring it up to the rest of the Weasleys since he was pretty sure Bill had told them all he was working during the holidays, but figured now wasn't the time for him to cause more drama... yet.
“Oh, I know who that is,” he said and the group all spun around to stare at him, “What?” He asked again. Ron threw up his hands.
"I have to go get ready, but I promise I'll be back for the details of that," Draco told her and gave what he hoped was a reassuring nod before moving past her to get towards a small, inconspicuous room a bit to the side. Draco couldn't remember having ever seen it there, but figured the castle had added more rooms for the event. Sure enough, as he pushed his way inside his trunk and clothes sat by a window with a mirror and some of Harry's things as well.
"-last week Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were said to have been there, but luckily escaped. Nobody knows what caused the explosion, but it appears to have taken out Fenrir Greyback and ten other Death Eaters. Reports say You-Know-Who and Bellatrix Lestrange were not at the manor when the explosion happened so don't let down your guard," Lee continued. Harry's eyes widened. Malfoy Manor? It
"Draco," Hermione tried, sliding in next to Harry, "It's us, okay? We can prove it, but we need to hurry."
“I was planning to look for Winston over the summer,” Draco said quickly, “But then I got taken and… I tried-”
Oh, Draco… the fun part about dramatic irony is that we all know how badly you fucked up with those last few sentences to Hermione RIP. That mental breakdown is coming. I promise the next chapter will be fraught with some major character development for our boy, worry not.
"Draco..." He said softly, "Things are more complicated than the little things you've picked up on," he said and Draco snorted. Right. Everything in life seemed to be that way. "I'm not making excuses - and I like simple things!" He added, "That's what I have with Dora. A wife - who I
"I'm going to take that kid to so many Weird Sisters concerts. Also, if the DADA position is still open when he's in school I'm definitely going to apply so that we can terrorize the school together," she said with a stoic nod. Draco laughed. That kid was probably going to be the luckiest kid in the world, no doubt. Draco turned to look back at him only to find-
"I don't know. Just... be careful, alright? I'll be back." She told him and just like that was gone.
“It took me a long time to figure out how to get you both here discreetly, so please don’t ruin this by freaking out.” Draco greeted as he sat down in the empty classroom.
“In theory, no. They don’t. Practically speaking? I would have nowhere to go, Draco. I don’t have an Andromeda or Gryffindor friends that would take me in.”
“He’s back.” Harry managed once more. Right. Okay. Draco had this under control. He glanced over his shoulder to see a few others trying to intervene. He walked around, gently trying to pry Harry’s fingers off of the corpse.
He was so shocked by the declaration that he couldn't even think of a response at first, "I have things I want to do... with you." He added and shook his head, "It isn't fair. I haven't... I thought after all of this that we could have some normal time together." He said sounding bitter. Draco shook his head.
“Getting rid of Black will save the other two.” Severus hissed back, “Let me go before the dementors come.” He growled. Draco didn’t really want to leave it at that… but he was right about the dementors… and he couldn’t leave Ron.
"Binns is on vacation. I don't know why a ghost needs a vacation, but Theo is filling in and making my life Hell," he informed him darkly. Oh... yeah, that made sense. Draco turned back, "Last week he assigned them all different readings on your trial-"
“It’s not just about Pansy,” Hermione had said while Draco hit his head repeatedly on the table during breakfast, “It is about categorizing people and limiting them by trivial things.”
“You are so lame,” Ron said, looking truly awed. Draco stared him down. “Fine. Whatever. I’ll go. Just know that
"Voldemort killed my brother," Theo said simply, "I knew that from the beginning. You were just naive enough to let it happen. That doesn't mean I would turn against you." He told him. The words were curt, but Draco appreciated the honesty of them. He nodded, looking at the ground before meeting his eyes again.
"He didn't tell us this for a long time," Hermione argued, "If we betray his trust then he won't tell us anything in the future. We'd be better trying to get him to come forward instead."
Maybe he couldn’t do it after all. Draco had killed people, sure, but… this somehow felt different. More intimidating. More final.
"Don't piss my mother off," He said lowly and Harry gave him a startled look, "I'll explain later." He added and Cassi peered over, walking so she directly in front of an oblivious Harry.
“You can see them?” Harry asked, sounding a bit perplexed. Draco shrugged and got into the carriage. “...have you always been able to see them?” He tacked on. Draco bit the inside of his cheek.
"Sirius would lose his mind," Draco said wisely, "I vote we tell him." He said and reconsidered. While it
. There wasn't exactly a huge list of people on who he could be talking about. "The point is, you didn't even do anything
The room he entered was covered in green and silver. It was lavish, with polished wood and silk bedding that had a familiar crest painted over it. The Black family crest. Draco wandered a bit closer, noticing news clippings scattered about. On one of the walls was a photo of the Slytherin quidditch team. In the center was a boy clinging onto the snitch, smirking into the camera. At first Draco thought it was Sirius.
Logically, he knew Harry probably felt fear as they all did. Maybe. Harry sighed and grabbed his arm again. At first, Draco thought he was trying to look at his Dark Mark again only to notice him staring at the back of Draco's hand. Oh. Right. The scars on his hand had faded slightly - not completely, but almost. He hadn't used the blood quill as often as Harry had. There was even a chance it might not be permanent.
In the end, they had to share a compartment with Luna Lovegood. She was an odd girl… Draco mainly knew about her via his family research he had done over the summer. After the Neville thing he went ahead to see what other business his family had been involved in. Turns out, after Pandora Lovegood’s death, his father decided to spend his efforts appealing to the ministry that their family should not get her life insurance money on account that the backfiring of her spell had been purposeful rather than an accident.
There was more shouting. Then, without warning, Bellatrix was gone and Draco was fully awake as he crashed into the floor. He gasped, a jolt of pain shooting through his wrists as he landed. He felt someone tugging on his shoulder to find Neville next to him.
“What? No. My Aunt Andromeda is,” he frowned, “Bellatrix is in Azkaban,” he said and tilted his head, “Why would I write to her?” He asked. There was a long pause. “Do you know Bella?” He asked, bewildered. Longbottom stared.
Draco needed to sit down. It was too much. It was too much and what the Hell? They took every precaution. What was happening? He couldn't breathe. He couldn't-
“Oh my God,” Ron was wheezing. He looked a bit like a lobster, his face bright red from laughter as Fred clapped him on the back, smirking at George who gave Draco a thumbs up. Draco pouted back, trying to appear as pathetic as possible in front of Molly Weasley.
“Narcissa.” He said as if Draco’s mother had also somehow appeared in the shack with them, “Well, this is a lovely coincidence.” He murmured. Draco rolled his eyes. “I am sorry to hear you’re related to them though. Very unfortunate.”
"Leave her be," his father interrupted with a small grimace, "She's doing the best she can." He said evenly. Draco stared. What did he mean...? Why would-
There was a something in his chest that made everything lighter. Anger seemed to crackle around him until he realized, rather calmly, that there were flames circling him and Bellatrix. He wasn't sure how... but he knew his magic had somehow summoned them so that the world knew this was between him and Bellatrix. That all the years he had spent with her were about to finally come to end so that he could have his vengeance - or die trying.
"I mean, he did, but it was all kind of last minute," Zoe frowned, tapping against the table thoughtfully, "He never mentioned it before that night. Then the next day he was... gone." She said, shaking her head, "Maybe being around you was too much for him." She added and Draco frowned. "I don't mean that in a nasty way! Obviously, it isn't your
He was about to suggest they drag Hermione away from Lockhart before she started drooling when a sudden flash of silver caught his attention. Draco stiffened. Harry didn’t seem to notice, too busy trying to whisper something to Ron. Taking advantage of the lack of attention, Draco stepped away from them to follow the graceful figure to the front of the store.
“Champions!” McGonagall said as she scurried over their way, holding the thistles on her hat in place, “Oh, where is - there you are!” She said when Harry walked in with Parvati (who also looked really pretty). He stumbled a bit, almost as if Parvati was dragging him to the group. “Okay, now are you all ready?” She asked.
McGonagall seemed less than impressed by his slow walk to the stool. She looked pointedly at the chair for him to sit. Well then. Trying not to seem too put out by her lack of respect on the matter, he put himself on the rickety stool (really, this thing seemed ancient… Why not an armchair? Surely, school funds weren’t that dismissal).
“You’re… going to kill a full-grown man who has murdered multiple people already?” He asked. Harry looked up at him with a scowl. “Sorry. Um, I’ll help you.” He said. Wait. That wasn’t the right response either. “...I’m sorry.” He said again and this time leaned forward to hug him. Draco still wasn’t thrilled with the whole hugging thing, but… well, it was growing on him. Maybe. Harry certainly enjoyed it based on how tightly he clutched back at him - almost as if afraid Draco might disappear.
“It was fun getting the stuff for it,” he said and pointed to another of their memories. “I highly recommend we do that one too before calling a break.” He added. Draco sighed. Something told him he was about to get made fun of again.
"I'll leave you to it then," Molly told him and Draco nodded his thanks, "Ron said I was only allowed to hug her ten times today so... give her one more for me." She said when Draco put his hand on the handle. He paused.
.” He ordered as Harry gave a slight gasp of trembling pain. “Come on-” He tried and Neville suddenly moved, raising his own wand.
.” He said, pointing a finger at his chest. “And while we’re on the topic, I don’t appreciate you telling him that I haven’t been doing well.”
“...why are you upset about this?” Ron frowned, and turned to them. “That’s… twice as many people to snog, right? That’s a good thing, mate.” He said and clapped his knee. Harry made a sad sniffling noise.
“I’m, um, dating Ginny.” He said and Draco turned to look at him with raised eyebrows. He couldn’t say he was
“Yep,” Draco said, popping the p. “Her family was recruited. They agreed to serve the Dark Lord, but…” He trailed off. He wasn’t sure what to say. There was something about this girl. This fourteen-year-old who he had seen shoved off in the corner. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. As if he knew her already. “Mr. Greengrass killed a muggle to prove himself. Her face when he did…” He said. “I couldn’t just leave her with them… so instead I smuggled her out.”
"I also knew during your third year. I also knew about you and Harry during your third year," he added helpfully and Draco opened his mouth to respond, but apparently this turned into an invitation for everyone to announce when they knew Ron and Hermione would get married... general consensus was that everyone knew before Ron and Hermione did.
“Such a dashing young man!” George cried from where he was still pestering Vernon. “Vernon, what do you think of Theo?”
"Oh," Draco blinked a few times and picked up one, "Thanks. Sorry, about that," he added and rubbed the sleep from his eyes, "Do you mind if I, uh, spend some time as my animagus? It helps me calm down." He said and Harry nodded quickly.
“No, they belong to whoever is staying here,” she said and Draco raised an eyebrow at her, “Oh, come on. I don’t have time to rent us a room. It’s just twenty minutes and if the muggles come in we can confound them.” She said. Draco lifted his hands in surrender. Whatever. He knelt down, curiously looking at a few items of muggle clothes left in the open bag as Ron started looking for food.
Look, he understood there was an obvious ‘Sirius Back and Draco Malfoy’ parallel going on here. He understood that the fact they were technically blood made it stronger. He understood Harry was acting purely on emotion because he found out a lot of distressing things quickly and the guy was an orphan with some serious issues. Like, seriously, Draco was astounded by the fact he was sent to live with
Not that he planned to have sex yet. He was only fourteen, after all, but Andromeda wouldn’t believe him if he said that. She was under the impression that all teenagers lied constantly, which just wasn’t true. Draco considered himself brutally honest. In fact, he only lied around twenty percent of the time… okay, that was a lie. It was more like eighty.
the potions master.” Severus snapped at him, though through the exasperation Draco could see a bit of fondness touching his eyes. “You’re forgetting to crush them. It releases the juice better.” He said and Draco looked down. Damnit. “Love has made you sloppy.”
“Be safe,” Andromeda was saying as they entered the platform. “Don’t do anything foolish and…” She trailed off, running a thumb absently over his cheek. “Remember what we talked about.” She said, voice lowering slightly. “There are some things best kept secret, but if you need help. Get help.” She reminded him.
Both Harry and Ron’s heads snapped up simultaneously. McGonagall took a long breath before standing in front of the door with her hands clasped in front of her.
“I need your help.” Draco broke in before it could continue. They both turned to him. While the words had been pretty tame (all things considered), the tension crackling between them was anything but. Andromeda nodded for him to continue. “When I was little you used to tell me about the Deathly Hallows,” Draco began, nodding at his mother. Narcissa frowned.
important. He was Draco Malfoy. Important was his middle name. However, he wasn’t sure what Harry meant exactly.
Bellatrix seemed too angry to voice any words. All that came out of her were furious, guttural shrieks that had the house shaking so hard that Harry thought there might be an earthquake. Another pop followed and Bellatrix spit.
“You should be ashamed of yourself,” he said without thinking. Petunia gaped a moment, mouth puckering like a fish as she struggled to retaliate. Harry gave him a curious look from where he was saying goodbye to Hermione and Ron, but Draco didn’t pay him any attention, “You and him both. Was your sister really so bad of a person?” He asked, shaking his head, “Because the only two people who seem to know much about her treat her son like rubbish.”
“Draco,” he said shortly. “Dumbledore told me. Your aunt told me.” He said. Again, Draco wasn’t surprised. “As someone who is
"Done," he answered Harry's...ghost? He couldn't really tell. "I'm done. It's done. Done." He said firmly.
“Harry,” Draco finally said, interrupting the panicked attempts to get help, “He’s not here to get Ginny out.” He said and Tom’s eyes latched onto him, curling into a cold smile.
Draco yelled. Part of him was amazed at how quickly Harry listened as he gripped the broom, letting the bludger shoot by before reaching out again. It seemed even that close call wasn’t enough to deter him. He was close… maybe he could make it.
He said and Lavender's eyes lit up at that, "But I'm getting ahead of myself," he chuckled and grabbed a piece of toast to butter, "I've seen you two together. Very, uh, passionate." He said for a lack of a more... descriptive word. Ginny compared them to two eels... fair enough. Draco leaned in, "You are being safe, right?"
Hints of lavender soap hit him - much like what his mother used to wear - with whispers of Andromeda’s birthday cakes and something else he refused to identify even though it reminded him of grass and sun and rain hitting the ground.
Draco stared a bit at them all in horror. Sure, he was a little taken aback by Ron making prefect - especially when the Hermione decision was such an obvious choice - but why were they acting
“Just going to throw this out there. Seems like a childish argument.” He offered to nobody. Theo and Hermione had continued talking as if nothing happened. Right.
“AND DON’T THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT GOD FORSAKEN CLOAK THAT WE CAN’T HEAR YOU MAKING OUT! JUST GO TO THE BLOODY ROOM OF REQUIREMENT OR SOMETHING!”
"At the very least just... tell me what sectumsempra does," he said with a sigh. At this, Severus threw his wand down.
. He wanted to move after him, but he was holding up Ron’s weak side. If he let go then his bitten ankle probably wouldn’t be able to hold him up. “Sirius, he’s gone! Pettigrew transformed!” Harry shouted and the dog perked up, blood oozing from the gash across his snout. He launched forward, sprinting after the rat so they were alone with an unconscious Severus (look, he hadn't agreed with knocking out his godfather, but even Draco had to admit he was acting more unhinged than even Sirius was).
sucking Lavender's face off. Perhaps she read this in his eyes because her mouth dropped indignantly for a moment before giving a small huff.
“If he can’t tell us where the traitor is then he’s of no use to us.” Bellatrix said. Draco’s heart sped up. He looked back at the man in front of him. “I know you have an attachment, but he will be a problem.”
“Hey, Sirius.” Draco greeted the black dog watching him. He had wondered what exactly was going on with this ‘move’. Harry had been staying with Sirius as far as he knew. He supposed they made a special trip to keep the Dursleys from being killed. A waste of time if you asked him. Why did Harry even have to come to this? Maybe he was the only one who could convince these idiots their lives were in danger.
"You... are you sure you don't want to choose? You don't want him to be named after you?" He asked cautiously. Remus only shook his head. "Not... not after James or Draco or anything?" He asked. Harry frowned at that. Edward Draco also sounded awful... so he was a little relieved when Remus shook his head again.
"Draco." Hermione interjected and he turned to meet her eyes. Inwardly, he sighed. She didn't have to say it for him to know. Trauma. Harry had it before last year and it was honestly a surprise it took him this long to start showing the effects of all he had been through. Biting his tongue, he looked away. It would just be nice if Harry knew where to direct that trauma... that's all. Still, Draco knew he didn't mean it. He also felt a stab of guilt knowing that... well... it wasn't
“Just thinking about Rita Skeeter’s Weighing of the Wands article. Very honored to see the eyes that are glistening with the ghosts of your past.” He said and Harry reached out and to mess up his hair. “
"Well? What is the answer, Cissy?" She asked. Narcissa straightened up and turned to face Voldemort. When she answered, the words bounded across the woods. Draco had expected them, but they cut no less when she spoke - looking the Dark Lord straight in the eyes.
But yeah. Get ready for the true romance… Neville/Draco. Not really, but their bromance is gonna be epic.
“A muggleborn gave me trouble,” Draco said, redirecting his thoughts back to Bellatrix. That was a lie. Draco hadn’t seen a single muggleborn in weeks. “Then I found Crabbe walking around with this,” he said, lifting up a coin. It was one of the DA coins Hermione had made in their fifth year. Draco was actually pretty pleased with his ingenuity here. He had shown them to Voldemort with an explanation of how they worked and told him it was probably how members of the resistance were contacting one another.
“My mother is being stubborn about staying,” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of nose. “Trust me, I’m thoroughly frustrated on the matter. Loving someone who is determined to endanger their own lives is… no easy feat.”
“My parents.” He said. His voice was reasonably contained, but Draco could hear the excitement rising. “Have you seen this one?” He asked Ron and Hermione who both shook his head. Harry looked at the swirling colors for a moment - there was a hint of hesitation when he looked back at them, but ultimately he gestured them closer. Draco smiled before walking over to lean back into the bowl.
“Electricity,” he noted with a nod, “This is a muggle building.” He said and glanced around. Hermione nodded as she pulled them into a room. Draco examined the area curiously. It was a… small… house? No, just a bedroom with house-like things inside. He frowned. This didn’t make any sense. “Is this supposed to be an inn?” He asked, looking around in bafflement.
"Hi," Harry greeted as he shuffled next to their cauldrons, "I wanted to see if you were done," he told Draco and then gave Severus a wary look, "I also realized I hadn't thanked you for the memories you gave Draco of my mother." He added. For a second, Draco froze - a little concerned he might have been listening in. It was then that he remembered his Christmas present to Harry. Right. Severus had begrudgingly coughed up two very carefully selected memories.
"I was afraid you'd say that," she sighed and then glanced at Harry, "Take care of one another then. All of them."
“What is this?” His father asked and Draco tilted his head, “I heard you were reinstated. This is an outrage. You are not fit for this school. First, you brainwash my only child by allowing him to consort with lowborns and refuse to let him leave that awful house and now you let a monster wreak havoc-”
still angry with Severus over last year. He felt betrayed over him not rising up to be the person he thought he was. Draco had always looked up to him and… whatever. He was just disappointed. It was like the last real connection to his old life had finally given out.
"It's good," Remus said, wariness momentarily pausing to give him a warm smile, "To think of a future means you have hope to have everything you might want in it." He told him. Draco nodded.
“They aren't going to put you into Azkaban for being tricked by Dumbledore," Theo shook his head, "Look, I promise I won’t say anything if you just tell me what’s going on and
“I’m less worried about Krum and more about Karkaroff. If you really think he’s bad then he could easily manipulate someone like Krum - who is his
He groaned and let his head fall forward, “Aren’t I already hanging around an unsavory lot as it is? Why are you-”
“This is just mean!” He said loudly as Madam Pomprey shrieked in the background. Hermione picked up a pudding and dumped it on Ron's head. “
“Oh? You’re famous now?” She smirked up at him, “Did you finally snap and murder all the dark witches and wizards so they would stop disrupting your education?” She asked and Draco rolled his eyes. Honestly. He just came here to learn.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He said smoothly. Smith’s eyes narrowed - nose wrinkling slightly as if he could destroy Draco with his mind alone.
“He doesn’t know that,” Draco waved his hand dismissively “Also, Dean Thomas definitely has a thing for Ginny,” he clicked his tongue “But is kind of scared of Ron. Another fun fact: He also has a thing for Seamus.”
"I'm going to drink twenty butterbeers or die trying." He decided. Fred and George, of course, perked up from the far end of the table.
"I don't know if you're aware," he said rubbing the side of his arm, "But there are quite a few people looking for you." He said and looked Theo over. "I heard this was all your doing." He said, gesturing vaguely around them. Theo scoffed.
"I am so excited to learn where this going," Harry said, grabbing a treacle tart from the tray beside them. Draco gave a suffering sigh.
A few people gave panicked shouts. There was another thud as one of the other wards came crumbling down while others scattered away. An uneasiness was rising while some of the Death Eaters prowled at the borders, tauntingly flicking their wands and waving brightly.
and people... kind of annoy me." He admitted with a small shrug. McGonagall coughed - it might have been a laugh. "Not everyone, but... I mean, the... Listen, I had a first-year come up to me the other day crying about a their ear hurting and it turned out they put a marble in there. I can't deal with that everyday!"
"He's alright," he said, voice going a little high and strained. Sabelia tilted her head. When he locked eyes with her, he found his mouth almost moving without permission, "I'm pretty sure I would already die for him." He said without thinking then frowned. Wait a second. "Hey. No fair." He muttered and Teddy made a garbling noise. "You better hope that one goes back to Brazil and doesn't stay friends with your mom because if not... you won't get away with anything." He whispered. Teddy cooed in agreement, "Glad we're on the same page," he said and Ron peered over.
Yeah, Draco agreed. Unexpected was one word for it. Another might have included words that an eleven-year-old probably shouldn’t know. There was a face. A face on the back of Quirrell’s head. Draco wasn’t new to the magical world - he had seen some alarming things, but this? This was not something he had been prepared for. At all.
"Come in," a voice called and Harry opened the door to reveal both Griphook and Ollivander calmly sitting on a pair of beds eating what looked to be lunch. Both seemed to have recovered fairly quickly...  Nobody flinched away when he walked into the room at least though both did jump at the sound of the door opening. "Ah, Mr. Potter." Ollivander smiled when he saw him, "How nice to see you, child." He said and Harry gave a weak smile as he shuffled in.
Harriet called brightly. Harry made a face before lightly tugging on Hermione's arm to gesture towards the snake.
“Very well,” Bellatrix said, “We will see if the Dark Lord agrees with that assessment, Draco. If he doesn’t… you will pay the price.” She said, and dropped her knife so it clattered to the ground. “And I will not protect you from his wrath.”
Draco snorted as the memory began to fade. Harry looked torn between amused and empathetic towards his poor mother.
“Harry is just as rude,” Draco told him, leaning him against the cave’s wall, “Speaking of which, now that I’ve given you all the tools to properly make fun of him, are you done trying to con information out of me?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. Sirius put a hand over his chest.
“Knotgrass is used in polyjuice potion,” Draco said, tapping a finger to his lips, “When you transform into someone else you get their eyesight too…” He mused slowly, “You and I will be talking more about this later.” He informed Neville. “Right now I have to go. Thank you, Neville!” He called, sprinting away.
he wrote and hesitated. Part of him didn’t want to explain the situation, but he knew his parents may need to get involved if he hoped to fix this. Sighing, he put his quill back to the paper.
“I know what you believe in,” Draco said slowly and bit the inside of his cheek, considering. “I don’t agree with it. Not anymore.”
“Uh huh,” Draco grumbled suspiciously, “Just keep your - Montague, I’m surprised they let you out with all of our guests this year,” he cut himself off when he saw the Slytherin eye up Harry, “I thought Hogwarts might at least pretend it had semi-intelligence students.”
“While I most certainly appreciate the school getting a thorough cleansing,” Daphne said, reappearing so suddenly that Harry almost fell out of his chair, “I am kind of irritated by the whole thing. My parents aren’t paying these goons to freak out about a monster attacking cats and ghosts,” she sniffed, tossing her hair over her shoulder.
Now, I'm sure you guys have figured out my words mean nothing by this point, but I THINK I'm gonna try to wait a week before the next chapter is up. I still got to write the ending in the epilogue so I'm gonna try to spend this week getting that together so that maybe the last couple chapters came come out a little closer together... tho like I said. My words mean nothing.
"Are you going to keep it?" Draco asked Harry who was still staring at the spaces Remus was addressing. "After we're all done using it?"
“Where have you been?” Hermione asked and Draco inwardly sighed when he noticed tears pooling at her eyes, “I-”
“Here,” Granger said one morning and handed Draco a plate of food, “Sit down, please. I need to talk to you.”
“You’re trying out for keeper. That means you see all the players and figure out the best play. If you can’t do that then nobody can. Now stop making me say obvious things to you so I can make fun of your freckles or something.”
There was a sharp influx of confusion and... uncertainty before finally transition into raw panic. Harry bit his lip.
It was fine. Draco figured it would work out well enough. Dumbledore would be weak after that adventure and hopefully give Montague an upperhand.
“Draco’s?” Hermione said and shook her head, “Harry, if you felt Draco’s pain then it is definitely Voldemort making stuff up. You and Draco don’t have a connection-”
“Yes, Potter. I was there,” McGonagall said flatly. Potter gave a small pout and a hint of a smile touched her lips, “I was going to say that it was quite possibly the most Gryffindor thing I have ever seen.”
In theory, if happy memories could deter beings such as dementors then it wasn't all that surprising they had such an affect on dark wizards. Bellatrix stumbled back at the brightness as the light seemed to knock her to the ground. Draco cold hear some people gasp, but he ignored it as he took advantage of Bellatrix's weakened state to throw out one more curse.
“Did… you ever meet her?” Draco asked, trying to do the math in his head. Sirius would have been seventeen when she was born… so disowned. Sirius surprised him by nodding.
“The first dance!” McGonagall answered his earlier question, a bit impatiently as she looked them all over. “Get into your places, the ball is about to start.” She said. Draco nodded. He was about to grab Fleur’s hand when he caught sight of Theo gawking with -
“Stop talking to me, you stupid mudblood,” he hissed to her lowly and the girl blinked. Her eyes widened as hurt swept over her ridiculously messy features before hardening into something else.
Draco gave a weak smile and gestured to his trunk. At least he was already packed. Andromeda hugged him again.
"I wouldn't be so sure," a new voice said and Draco felt his heart stutter to stop when Andromeda stepped out in front of them, "Go heal Nymphadora." She added over her shoulder and Draco glanced down to see Dora's leg was swelling from where Bellatrix's curse hit her. Shit. He wasn't sure what that was. Pulling her up, he helped move her to the side as others rushed over to aid either Andromeda or Bellatrix. They both raised their hands in unison.
“He’s probably poisoning Draco’s mind with all that pureblood nonsense again.” Harry said, ignoring the question. He bit his tongue. To his surprise, Ron cleared his throat.
“I know it was you, you bloody little-” He began and brought out his wand. A few of the students passing by froze when Draco returned the gesture. There was an awkward moment of silence where they simply stood there with their wands pointed at one another
The house was… different than he last saw it. Sirius seemed to finally have won the battle and replaced many of the pureblood decorations. It was freshly painted a scandalous scarlet that would have sent the poor Blacks rolling in their graves. Still, Walburga’s portrait hung strong in the corner. It appeared not all their magic had been stripped away. The thought made him chuckle as he walked forward towards the dining room.
, but I couldn't because I had to keep him safe. He... He can't be. I can't have failed again," Sirius said, almost breathlessly as the hysteria started to settle in. A bang sounded from somewhere outside.
"This portkey will get you into Hogwarts," he said calmly and when Ron reached for it, slapped his hand away, "But we must talk first. I know they're searching for you out there, but I... have distressing news," he told them and Draco frowned as Harry sat down next to him. "Nott told me your plan. It is likely to work, but you must destroy the horcruxes quickly. I already have some students looking. Dumbledore's portrait told me it would be something of Ravenclaw's?" He asked and they all nodded.
"I don't know," Andromeda told him, "I really don't. Ever since last year he had a million plans in place. Some I knew about and others I didn't. He might have escaped and just be hiding somewhere, but I can't risk anything. Not with..." She swallowed and looked at where Tonks had also gotten quiet. The rest of her words went unsaid. Andromeda simply buried her face in her hands. From the couch, Hermione shifted slightly in her sleep.
“You’re making a mistake.” Draco tried again. Bellatrix smiled. It sent a shiver down his spine. Clumsily, he went to grab for his wand, but Bellatrix tilted her own in warning.
“I don’t know,” Draco sighed. Whatever. This was happening, apparently. “Neville and I were going to experiment on some plants to make an eyesight potion.” He said in hopes to get them all to drop this.
“Well,” Hermione said hesitantly, “Maybe we can spend time together at Hogsmeade sometime.” She suggested and Zoe beamed.
“The sorting hat does make odd decisions, doesn’t it?” He asked. Draco didn’t answer. He was pretty sure his feelings on the matter should be obvious. “You know, it wanted to place me in Slytherin,” he said.
Draco clicked his tongue and stalked out. He was pretty pleased with the conversation though… all things considered. He was sure to bring the letter with them when Harry took them to Sirius’ hiding place. It was a horrid little cave littered with rat bones and… yep. Sirius himself looked like complete and utter filth. Even Buckbeak looked better than him, lying down with freshly cleaned feathers ruffling as they all bowed to him. He was surrounded by various newspapers scattered on the ground - most of which appeared to have been collected by Sirius himself. Draco leaned down to pick one up, noting the article Rita had written mentioning Lily and James was ripped in half.
“I don’t know you!” He shouted after them. Somehow nobody else seemed to really be reacting to this. Possibly because Harry had made his grand re-entrance, “You can’t just forcibly adopt people!”
"There is something evil and chaotic in you," Neville chuckled as he finished stomping out a flame, "Well, I guess that means we can't boil gillyweed and pearl dust together." He mused. Draco laughed harder. "Are you okay?"
what he meant when he said he wanted Sirius and Severus to get along. Giving one last glower, he marched back to the Dursleys and where Harry was looking more and more frustrated.
Harry muttered back. Draco inhaled deeply. “And now what? They are going to drag you down with them? That isn’t fair-”
Draco asked and shook his head, "Why would you not mention that to him? What good would your silence have done?" He asked. Dumbledore's eyes watched him carefully. Not answering. Just observing. Like he was a freaking animal to watch, "Fine. We can come back to that. Tell me about the Deathly Hallows."
Draco was absolutely going to read into this, but raised his hand in a subtle surrender anyways. Ron studied him over for a moment before sighing.
“Tell her she’s mad!” Ron cut her off, “Krum found the smartest one of us and charmed her to get information on Harry and figure out that bloody egg for the second task-”
he muttered and walked over to yank Draco up, leading him away. Harry stepped forward, but Severus only shoved Draco behind him before turning to face Harry with a scathing look, "Keep. Yourself... in line." He warned, voice almost a whisper.
you.” Harry grumbled, face flushing a dark shade of red. Draco’s mind froze. “And I've been acting like an idiot and I'm
“Well, isn’t this a surprise.” A voice drawled out and Draco flinched on impulse. “You know, I had thought you might turn out pathetic, but honestly… this is just sad.” The boggart said… because it was a
“You’re just looking for an excuse to miss class,” Draco sighed, “I will not be a part of it.” He said and then looked around, “Where is Harry?” He asked. Hermione and Ron looked at one another. “Oh God.”
"Mama said I can stay," she told her, "I have already mastered my lessons. I know the English and I can stab." She said firmly. Draco blinked a few times.
“Potter?” Theo asked, a bit breathlessly before looking over his shoulder, “...thanks.” He said as Harry lowered his wand. Draco waited for some sort of response, but Harry was too busy glaring to give a ‘you’re welcome’. Draco was about to ask how the Hell he knew where they were before his wand illuminated an old piece of parchment before flickering out altogether.
.” He complained when he was pulled into a hug. Rolling his eyes, he just went with it and turned to kiss the side of his head.
“I think he would like that,” Lupin mused and clasped his arm, “Also, I should congratulate you. I hear winning the Quidditch Cup this year secured another House Championship.” He added, clapping his shoulder as he brushed by. Draco paused. He had almost forgotten… though he wasn’t sure how with Wood’s ecstatic screams from the tower every night.
The stag bowed his head at him. For whatever reason that seemed to snap Draco out of his devolving emotional breakdown.
you this already!” Hermione said, voice shaking. Draco moved a little closer, putting a hand on her arm. “Just go. Just…” She threw up a hand and spun away, marching towards the other end of the hall. Draco looked over. He didn’t really expect Harry to say anything - he
Andi growled at him and reached over to slap his hand away, "I'll bite you." She warned and Teddy paused - looking a bit torn between testing that or simply letting it go. When Draco cleared his throat pointedly he gave one last bright smile before skipping over to grab Narcissa's other hand.
“I’m not taking credit for what’s happening right now.” Hermione told him. “Who would even make Theo upset?” She asked. Draco considered. A good question. In fact, who would upset the vast majority of people? His goal was going to now be pissing off the highest quantity of students - nay, the whole magical community.
“Oh, excuse me?” Draco gasped, though it was hardly filled with any real ire as Theo pulled him down the corridor.
“I didn’t say anything!” She grinned and kissed his cheek “Thanks, Draco. I know you hate it, but I’m glad you got sorted with us. You’re a good friend. My best friend, actually.” She admitted, “If they had to choose someone for me to rescue at the bottom of a lake it would probably be you.”
who is going to turn him into an evil git and we’re going have to learn what life is like when we aren’t insulted on a daily basis… Until Nott does something stupid, of course.”
....Draco looked at her. Ron had already practically dove onto the bed as Harry begrudgingly held the gun with a grimace of distaste. Hermione narrowed her eyes. Slowly, Draco started moving towards the bed.
“What new seeker are you even training?” Wood growled out. Draco inwardly sighed. He knew Montague was already on the team, but dearly hoped it wasn’t someone else in their year. As it was, the Slytherins could be difficult to deal with. He couldn’t bare if it were Blaise or -
The blissful peace was tragically short-lived. As soon as Draco went to buy his quills, Theo had stepped in with an offer to pay – abruptly reminding Ron he was an enemy.
“It’s a sad movie,” he told her and gave a vague gesture, “Jafar just wants a promotion. I think he deserves it.” He sniffed. Hermione closed her eyes and smiled.
“No,” Draco said and pulled out his books, “Why does it matter to you so much anyways? You need to stop being weird when we date people.” He said, wrinkling his nose as he remembered the Vicktor Krum debacle. Hermione grimaced in sympathy. Ron scowled.
To her credit though, it wasn’t red, which was a nice addition to Draco’s now direly red wardrobe, but instead a lovely dark purple with a silver ‘D’ on the front. It was also admittedly pretty soft. Cautiously, he looked at where Harry was pulling his own sweater over his head and internally panicked. Did he have to wear his too? In front of people? Just as he was trying to figure out his next move, a silver package caught his eye.
“Anyone can use them to stab someone,” he said, picking up a knife with consideration, “But only someone with Black blood can use the magic in them. I would guess Bellatrix and even the dog could use it. You’ll have to be sure to keep a close eye on them.” He warned.
“...Sirius, can you deal with that?” Andromeda asked and Draco snorted, pushing Harry away now that he brought them both tumbling to the ground with a bang.
No. No, this was different. He was doing this to help prevent collateral damage. To help the kids and his friends make it out of here. Dumbledore hadn't spared them a second thought as far as he was aware. Ron gave him a sympathetic look before peering back down at the board with a look of utter concentration, tapping his fingers against his knee before nodding.
“I HAVE THE RULE BOOK, WEASLEY! HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME THAT I’M MAKING UP RULES?!” Draco yelled, shoving a glossy booklet in his face. The younger version of Ron looked at the sky for a moment before taking a long breath.
“We should go,” Vernon said quickly and grabbed Harry’s luggage, “Get in the car,” he added lowly. Harry snorted and gave Draco one last beaming look before turning away.
Quickly, he yanked off the hat to spin around. Harry stood behind him, hands in the pockets of his robes.
"Oh, darling," she said and patted his cheek, "Be sure to call me over when you say that to his face." She said and then paused, regarding him warily, "I suppose that means I should say it..." She added and Draco raised an eyebrow, "I do not approve of what you did," she added tersely.
“Easy for you to say.” He finally muttered as he adjusted his bag with a little more force than necessary. Draco tilted his head. “Oh, um.” Harry rectified with a wince upon realizing that Draco had a good amount of experience in the field of being hated for something that was not his fault. So, did Hermione actually, but he figured that would be the next thing to bring up if Harry didn’t stop being a brat. “Sorry.” He finally relented.
“Nonsense. It’s hilarious and practical,” he said and Sirius tilted his head, “Oh, whatever.” He said and looked out over the line of boring houses. Hestia was still trying to reason with the Dursleys and as Dudley and Harry exited the house. Draco watched curiously as the pair shook hands.
not allowed to have cold feet." She told him and Draco glanced up where the wedding party was and then squeezed Hermione's hand.
“What are you still doing here?” He snapped. Draco internally sighed. Well. It worked. That was good news at least. “Draco, stop following me. I told you we’re
“Hi, Sirius.” Harry said, looking torn between thrilled and anxious. He brought out more food from his pockets. Draco wished he had known what sort of state the man was in. He could have brought him more food and clothes and…
to witches and wizards in the tenth century?” He asked. That gave the group a small pause. “I’m not saying it was right of him to put a monster in the castle, but I think it is understandable.”
“I had to obliviate Theo.” He said as an introduction, stepping inside and pulling out the slip of paper Montague had given him. Dumbledore glanced up from his desk, eyes dimming slightly. “He apparently found me over the summer.”
“You're not the one who has to calm him down when he wakes up screaming,” Draco said hotly and… okay, screaming was a
Draco had seen the inside of the house just once. During that time he had admittedly only seen the living room and been more preoccupied with, uh, other things. Namely, clocking Vernon in the face. Now that there was no chaotic living room floo visits or candy experiments gone wrong, he could finally see what it might normally look like.
know it too. There's a reason this house responds to me and not you." He told him hotly. Sirius went completely still at that. It was... well, Draco was sure Sirius knew that Draco knew. This kind of magic - his
“Ah,” Draco said and bit his lip, “And, um, you didn’t… worry about… you know… not being what people wanted you to be? I mean, your parents sounded awful, but weren’t you worried about messing up and letting you friends down by not being Gryffindor enough or something?” He asked, trying his best to sound casual. Sirius flinched.
naming any child of mine Albus," he said and Andi let out a breath of relief, "And I doubt he would be Edward either," he said before spying a woman walking towards them in glittering silver and a dark purple dress. Oh, good. "Mother!" He called, "Could you take them downstairs?" He asked as she practically floated over to kiss him on the cheek. Andi watched her in besotted awe. "And why are you telling Andi about us having another kid?" He tacked on, a little annoyed. Narcissa blinked innocently.
“Longbottom! Yes! Bring him!” She beamed, “I like hearing him say fancy herbology terms.” She added. Zoe just shook her head.
. He tried to imagine if he had been sorted into Slytherin… if he remained with his parents and kept his blood purist ways… then, years later, he had an actual conversation with Harry and found out he didn’t know that his own grandfather was a bloody hero… He was pretty sure he would have died on the spot. “Everyone knows that Fleamont died of Dragon Pox alongside Euphemia. How do you think you got so bloody rich? He’s the inventor of Sleekeazy!”
He would kill Hermione for sure. Probably finish Harry off for good measure too. Ron might be tortured. It… he… he couldn’t…
carefully here. If this damn potion ended up smelling like Harry then he would lose his mind. Maybe he could muck it up on purpose?
“Draco, where-? Lucius,” Andromeda’s voice came from behind him, and to his horror, Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her (the little Weasley girl squirmed her way beside Harry as well).
“What are you doing?” Harry asked suspiciously as Draco went to drop some more pearl dust in. “That’s too much.” He said. Draco stared. Hermione was right. That damn book of his was
"Um," Fleur frowned and pressed a hand to Draco's cheek, "I... you need to leave," she said apologetically. Harry bit his tongue before looking at Draco. That was a joke, right? He... he wasn't really expected to leave him right now? "You're upsetting him." Fleur added quietly.
“You’re really worried about this,” Theo noted when they left McGonagall’s office a few hours later, “Potter survived the killing curse as a baby. He’ll be fine.” He said and grabbed his hand. “Let’s do something fun tonight.” He said. “...unless you have something
Rude, but okay. Hermione tilted her head. Draco could see her brows furrowing together before something clicked.
He shouted and pulled Draco again, sending them toppling to the side as the cavern rumbled, rocks tumbling down with a loud, thundering boom that sent the whole tunnel shaking.
Slughorn had what his mother might call ‘a rich sympathizer taste’. It was essentially as if someone decided to buy a bunch of things you might find in a lower-class house, but clearly spent a lot of money on them. For example, the drapings (while silk and very pricey looking) made them look like they were in a circus tent of some sort. The ornate chandeliers and lanterns looked as if they had been collected from several places. He was almost reminded of the Burrow… if the Burrow included ridiculously overpriced versions of everything in it.
She shot back venomously. Draco shrugged. He would regret that later for sure… but it was at least a relief to not deal with it now as he turned back to Slughorn.
"Enough!" He shouted, standing up so suddenly that Draco moved back a bit. His eyes were burning brightly - like the center of a flame. For a moment, he looked down. Draco realized his good hand was shaking. He shook his head. Unbelievable. Part of him wanted to relish in the fact he had actually gotten a rise out of the old man, but he wasn't done yet. Not anywhere near done.
“‘Night, Draco.” He said and when Draco went to lay back down, felt Harry move in slightly closer to him. He froze. Oh no. Oh God. This wasn't good. This was a precarious situation. Draco couldn't sleep like this when... you know, he was
“Why did you leave it for so long?” He finally snapped back and when Lupin turned, yanked his bag off one of the desks, “I told you it was a bloody bad idea-”
“There’s also a stupidity in it.” He said firmly and grabbed Harry’s arm, “We will not be participating.” He said and looked cautiously at Hermione. “...you too, actually. And you.” He added, grabbing Ron. Lupin raised his eyebrows. “Listen, I don’t want to psychoanalyze my classmates in front of everyone, but Hermione got petrified last year and Ron has lasting trauma from a giant spider trying to eat us in a forest. They don’t deserve to potentially relive those experiences. Thank you.” He said.
“Oh, yeah, we definitely don’t have dangerous ideas now,” Harry told him with a nod at his arm, “How’s the Dark Mark on your arm holding up?”
“Why didn’t you say so?! You just let Hermione drag us to the library for no reason?” He said, voice steadily rising with more and more outrage. Draco paused.
There was a lot Draco objected to about... well, pretty much everything she just said, but the idiot part of him (you know, the Gryffindor part) wondered idly if she knew he was gay. He didn't have a chance to ask since she kept going.
"McGonagall said she was going to make him stop doing that," Harry grumbled, shooting a dark look at the paper the girl was reading off of, "Even if that
my family.” Draco said before he could think it through. Moody smiled. From behind him, he could feel Harry shifting - hopefully putting the pieces together. Moody looked over Draco’s shoulder, eye fixed firmly on him.
The snake fell to its side, a loud wail following as the cavern shook and Harry was revealed underneath on the ground. Draco sighed. Thank God.
The rest was pretty typical. They saw Dumbledore - who resolutely did not look at Harry - and ended up back at Sirius’ house. Draco had figured he was in the clear. Well, sort of. Harry cornered him a few hours later.
"My mother grew up with two sisters. She thought it would be nice for her children to have siblings too." He said simply. Ron gave a weak smile at that. "So my parents went to a curse breaker. The wizard told her he fixed it. My father wasn't really sure, but right afterwards they had my sister so obviously they thought the spell was broken. Then I came." He said and stared at the table thoughtfully for a few minutes, "Turns out... he didn't really break the curse. Eventually, the magic sensed there were two of us and it picked the correct heir before getting rid of the other one." He said and shrugged. He had only been five. He didn't remember. Not really. Hermione put a hand over her mouth for a moment - clearly at a loss for words.
"Ah," Harry told him wisely, "But that was because I wore Dudley's clothes and didn't eat. What excuse did you have? I'm sure you were well-fed and your clothes always fit perfect," he said. Draco scowled at him, certain that he was trying to rile him up now, "So not sure why you were so pointy-"
He thought about relaying this to Ron and Harry, but both seemed preoccupied with finding the Heir of Slytherin, or at least what the monster was. Draco had pretty much halted any efforts he was making on that front given that him and Hermione still weren’t on speaking terms. Ron had tried to play mediator once or twice, but was instantly shut down by both of them.
”I’m so sorry, ” Harry told him when he finally pulled away. Draco grimaced. He didn't want to have this conversation yet. Also...
In the end, he ended up doing sixteen and then passing out for the rest of the weekend. Ginny gave him five galleons 'for trying his best' though, which felt was downright insulting, but he was too sick to really do much about it other than glare.
, Neville!" Ginny praised and then paused, "Wait. Didn't you, like, lower you standards a ridiculous amount and date him?" She asked Draco. He scowled at her. "What? He's a git," she said wisely, "I once had to hex him for talking too much bullshit." She said and then turned to Neville, "But I've never punched him. Genius. Really groundbreaking work there." She nodded, giving him an applause. Draco stopped his search for the blender to join in.
Ron choked out. Harry didn't look up. Despite the fact they could all hear Hermione's screams, none had reacted as strongly as Ron. He called her name constantly with screams of his own before yanking uselessly against the chains. At some point, he managed to get free and tried to disapparate. Harry had tried a few times too and when they failed Ron ended up pounding against the wall with helpless sobs.
There was a pause before realization flickered over Harry’s face. It immediately morphed into amusement and then outrage.
is why I’m stressed out.” Harry said, hitting the railing next to them as if he had somehow proved a point, “You don’t have to even go back. We’ll protect you!”
"Hold it," One of Jenkins companions said, putting a machete over his shoulder, "So you're the kid who took down the sex trafficking then?" He asked and Draco nodded, "Huh. Good job. And the organ trafficking?"
“Really?” He asked and flipped through it, “That’s… lucky.” He said. There was a weird gnawing at his stomach that he ignored. “I’ll face the blasted eye for you.” He said. Neville shuddered.
"Ha! Will they work on wizards," the man chuckled and dumped the bag out so the guns clattered on the floor, "I crafted these myself! Well, my father did those... and my grandfather did some at the bottom, but not the point. I fill the suckers with these babies," he said, holding up a small ball, "And depending on which one I use will hurt worse than any curse you can think of. Check it out. This one is filled with wolfsbane, which is obviously good for werewolf hunting. This one is with unicorn blood - have to get stuff under the table if you know what I mean - and these are filled stunning curses trapped inside. If one of these hits you it will knock your ass right out." He continued. There were several other different colored balls, but Draco didn't ask about those ones.
. Draco was so horrifically embarrassed for them (and himself for even knowing them) that he pretty much decided immediately this school year was going to be horrid… at least the howler was funny.
"That is indeed true," he said and then picked up the pieces of Harry's wand, "However, there are reasons wands respond to us. Connections. Emotions. Things of that nature," he mused and tapped his fingers on his thigh for a few seconds as he thought, "Sometimes, it is beneficial to receive a second wand. Most don't realize they can outgrow their first. What your magic needed when you were eleven could be different to what your magic needs now. It's grown and so have you," Ollivander explained, "Besides, your core was of the phoenix that belonged to Dumbledore and responded to You-Know-Who's connection to you. I suspect that even if this wand survived the war it would weaken after the Dark Lord dies. Your connections are gone." He said simply. Harry frowned.
"SIRIUS?!" He shouted and a hand gripped his arm, he turned and... yes. Yes, he was there. Harry laughed a bit hysterically before throwing himself at his godfather, hugging him tightly. After a minute, he turned to Dobby, "Thank you... so much," he said, shaking his head, "Thank you for coming for us. That was really brave." He told him.
“I don’t know!” Harry said a little defensively, “You can like both, I think. I’m pretty sure that’s a thing.” He said. Draco wasn’t sure what to make of that comment. Not that it mattered because in the distance he could see Ron and Hermione were both red in the face and - ah, no.
“Molly said you punched a muggle,” She greeted and narrowed her eyes, “I’m assuming it was one of the Dursleys, but thought I should check.” She said and walked over to hug Harry. “...it was your uncle, right?” She asked him. When Harry nodded, she turned her eyes onto Draco. “Alright, what kind of broom do you want? A Firebolt I’m guessing?”
differences, but I think I liked it the same. I mean, he was bigger, I guess. His face was kind of scratchy.” He told the ceiling. Hermione frowned.
She was released from the hospital and since that point, neither of them had uttered a word to the other. Harry and Ron both seemed terrified to get involved - probably fearing both Draco and Hermione’s wit and temper equally. He liked to think that the fact neither had openly said anything to him on the matter meant they thought he had a point.
"If she dies under questioning, I'll take you next," she told him wryly, yanking Hermione up by the hair. Bloodtraitor is next to mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them — yet," she said darkly. Harry kicked out as hands grabbed at him. Trying to think of anything at all to at least postpone the nutjob taking Hermione from them, but before he could think of anything there a sharp stab of pain and his world went completely dark.
"I won't be complaining when it's over," he said. Severus' lips thinned at that, but he said nothing, "Why are you here? Is it Draco?" He asked, voice rising. "I had a dream - I
“I’m so stupid. I didn’t even realize it until that moment,” he sighed. Well, maybe part of him had always known, but it was easier to pretend he didn't when the words only existed deep within the depths of his mind. “I’m lucky Bellatrix thought it was a cute little puppy love crush.” He said, rubbing the back of his neck, “She laughed and told me it would go away after he was dead.” He explained. Hermione’s hand tightened on his arm.
”You’re not in love with Neville, ” Sadie told him when he had joined the other Slytherins for a study session. “You just think you are because he is someone you would like to be in love with.” She said simply. As if anything she just said made sense.
about them. There would no doubt be a retraction soon enough. Besides, Andromeda already wrote him on the matter to inform it was rubbish. He had no idea how she knew, but trusted her all the same.
“No way,” Harry objected, “A Hufflepuff. Like Tonks.” He reasoned. Draco shook his head. He saw that kid reading about
Oh, right. Crabbe and Goyle were both people his father mentioned he should get acquainted with. Draco had sat with them on the train and felt like they would make good, lower ranking friends. It was a fun little game pureblood families liked to play with one another. Children of Death Eaters tended to try to exert themselves over others. You could come out on top, as equals, or on the bottom. Crabbe seemed like someone he could easily bully into submission. Of course, there were those like Pansy and Blaise where that would be less of an option given he had grown up with them.
“There, there,” Draco a little uncertainly as he patted his back. He gave a look towards Harry who gave an encouraging nod. “It’s… okay? I mean, he’s not dead yet. Maybe he’ll, uh, fight through it,” He tried. Ron turned his snort into a cough.
. A flash of pink hair caught his eye a few yards away. Hopping down, he weaved through the blinding back and forth of spells and yells to find Dora disarming her opponent.
“I - I’m so sorry,” he stuttered out, feeling his stomach sink. It was strange. Reasonably speaking, it made sense… that dark witches and wizards would use dark magic to hurt their wayward children. It was just something Draco had never considered in the realm of possibility before. The idea of his mother or father raising their wand to him… the thought had never even crossed his mind. “That’s horrible.” He managed. Sirius chuckled.
"I didn't do it to be nasty..." Neville repeated, rubbing the back of his neck. Draco and Ginny unanimously laughed at him.
“I will not be lectured by a fifteen-year-old,” he said calmly and picked up the black quill, “Why do you have this?”
“Yeah, but we’re going to. Either about you being weird about that book or me.” He said and shrugged, “So let’s pick something that won’t be as… tense.” He suggested. Harry didn’t look sure as he looked him over carefully. “What’s your favorite color?” He finally asked. Harry frowned.
“I’m honored,” Draco told him flatly. Harry snorted, “If it bothers you so much I won’t bring him around you-”
Draco jerked back. Sirius seemed to process what he said a second too late as his eyes widened, mouth opening to backtrack. He never had a chance as Draco suddenly stood.
"Smartest decision I've ever made," Hermione interrupted him firmly. Draco swallowed. Alright then. He couldn't very well argue with the bride. "Come on," she whispered, "This kind of has been a long engagement. I'm ready for it to end." She said and Draco nodded.
"But... clearly that didn't work," Hermione said, tapping Skeeter's article. "If this is true, I mean."
"Oh? The muggleborn? We'll find him again soon enough," Voldemort said and Draco shook his head. It was at that moment that Rowle started coughing. Draco glanced over at him before turning to back to Voldemort. Donovan joined him seconds later, clutching as his throat as he fell against the wall. Bellatrix stiffened for a moment before turning to look at where Narcissa stood calmly, watching with an eerily blank look.
I’m just warning you! I might even upload year 5 a bit quicker than usual so you don’t have to sit with the pain as long. My tentative schedule for this year is gonna be Part 1 Sunday/Monday, Part 2 Wednesday, Part 3 Sunday. I think. We'll see how that goes. Then we might have to go back to 1x a week bc while I'm technically finished with year 6... year 7 is a freaking mess of scenes in no real order right now lol. But yeah. Year 5...
“I’m not very good at making friends,” she said softly, “Never was. I want to be helpful, but…” she trailed off and Draco furrowed his brows.
“Nightmares.” Draco translated. Harry flinched. “I can fix that for you,” he said and internally felt a swell of concern. “Is it just the graveyard or other things?” He asked, trying to sound casual. Harry paused. Then, as if unable to hold it in any longer, he spilled everything.
“....he hasn’t killed me yet.” Harry’s voice grumbled. Ron gave a slight shrug at that as Hermione closed her eyes again. “Besides, I’m with you. Let’s just go to Zonko’s or -
"I've had more practice now," she warned, "I'm just pleased I finally have a chance to right the wrongs you've done to our family. Breeding our bloodline with muggleborns and
“I figured they would badger you about it,” he said and looked fondly in the direction Harry had gone, “He’s really a perfect blend of Lily and Prongs… amazing given that he never met them,” he mused with a slight sigh. Draco nodded. He didn’t know Lily or James to give much commentary to that, “Did he leave out anything about what’s happened this year?” He asked and Draco snorted.
particular tree. He kind of hoped he suggested it again given they were having a boy... it would be funny to see how exasperated his godfather got, "Of course, I suppose I could always change it like I did yours..." He teased. Harry closed his eyes, breathing out slowly.
"No, no," Draco told him, watching with slight amusement as Kreacher froze, "I would like to do this." He said. The house elf continued looking at him - eyes narrowing slightly. Draco bit back a chuckle. It had been awhile since he had given any house elf an order... he tended to avoid the ones at Hogwarts so Hermione wouldn't get riled up. He glanced over his shoulder to make sure she wasn't listening. "Though I would like you to go upstairs and feed Harriet for me... please." He added, "Then perhaps start cleaning up the drawing room. Honestly, Kreacher. Have you seen this house?" He asked lightly.
“Shut up, you arrogant prat,” He said, rolling his eyes, “You've done your job tonight,” He told him, thinking about the peeved look on Ron's face when he had entered. McLaggen opened his mouth again, but fell silent when Draco pressed the knife further in. “Stop bothering Hermione.”
"Come on," Ron said, gently helping her up, "Fleur mentioned she has clean clothes for us," he told her. Hermione yawned. She looked too tired to even know what was happening as she stumbled out of the room. Harry shook his head. He needed to be better with checking in with her. Draco wasn't the only one tortured. Making a silent promise to join forces with Ron to look at her arm a bit later, he turned back to Theo.
, but my parents used to whisper about Voldemort wanting a Deathly Hallow during the last war.” He said and shook his head, “I’m not sure why he wouldn’t want all of them, but Winston and I are going to try and find them before he can get to them.” He explained. Draco stared.
sorry-” he greeted, grabbing the bag. From behind him Sirius also reappeared. “You are doing amazing. I would never leave you on purpose, I love you so much-”
“Are you alright?” A girl asked him curiously and Draco recognized her from the train. The muggle girl who was hanging around Potter earlier.
“Yeah, well he did!” Draco shouted, “And Sirius - someone who has waited twelve goddamn years to keep the man who killed best friends away from Harry - would have taken him away from that. How is what you did fair?” He asked, “You know, Dumbledore said the only reason Harry survived the Dark Lord’s attack was because Lily Potter loved him so much her magic protected him even in death. You may not like James Potter, but what about her? Did you hate her that much too? To put her child who she
“He was apologizing.” Draco informed him. Ron shrugged. “...did you apologize to Hermione?” He asked. Ron gave him a considering look.
your help,” Draco spat at him and stood up. Harry closed his eyes and took a long breath. It infuriated Draco even more. “And I certainly didn’t ask for it. In fact, it would be easier for me if you just stayed out of it.” He tacked on. Harry gave a cold laugh.
“I should get back home. Thank you for meeting with me.” Narcissa said and turned away. Draco opened his mouth to call after her, but she had vanished around the corner before he could even think of what he wanted to say. Bewildered, he turned back to Andromeda.
"You... are sorted based on...? Nevermind. I wanted to ask you about the guns." He said, nodding to the bag on the ground by him. The man shrugged. "Are those magical guns by chance? Not the ones that spew out metal bullets?" He said and the man frowned at him, "Will they work on wizards?" He clarified.
“Anyone with two eyes and a few brain cells knows nothing is going on between Potter and Hermione,” Tristam said, picking up a piece of bread to butter, “Love potion. As if.” He snorted and threw an arm over Draco’s shoulders, “Unfortunately, Malfoy here has reason for concern. I heard she’s been getting hate mail, hasn’t she?” He asked. Draco gave a small nod. He hadn’t known whether to reveal that or not… Pansy might revel in the fact people were sending Hermione such wicked letters over Skeeter’s article proclaiming Hermione’s ‘devious’ intentions getting Krum (and Harry apparently) to like her.
Despite being placed in Gryffindor, Draco liked to think he still had retained Slytherin qualities as he got older. He was smart. Cunning to a degree that it almost always got him and his idiot (no, not you Hermione) friends out of trouble. Ambitious and most importantly
No regrets. Ted was going to meet his grandson. It was worth it. He only hoped his parents would forgive him.
So. That was how he made it through the torture with his sanity. It didn't explain who had blown up the mansion... though he did have a sneaking suspicion that if Rudolphus and Rabastan pushed his father to insanity they could have just killed him... and if his mother returned to the manor like his father said she would only to find him dead and Draco missing...
“...find what?” Ron asked and Draco nodded to himself. Yep. Crabbe and Goyle were a perfect fit for these two. Pansy only sighed at what probably was a stupid question.
Look, he wasn't eleven anymore. He had developed an appreciation for muggles, yes. That didn't mean he had to enjoy all of their inventions. Was it amazing they made such a machine without magic? Of course! Was that amazing machine also slow and ugly and bumpy enough to make Draco want to vomit on its low-grade interior? Also yes. Not to mention it was red. Why was everything in his life red? He was forced to wear robes, live in a dorm draped in red, befriend red-headed people - the color haunted him.
“Oh,” He whispered and went back to trying a hydrating charm so Sirius didn’t pass out when flying. “I see. You must have been… very important to them. Since it took that long, I mean.” He said softly.
"I'm really happy you're alive," he went with and interlaced their fingers. "I probably should have realized sooner. When your patronus came-"
"Hi," he greeted, "I'm glad to see you're doing better," he added, softening his voice. Ollivander beamed back at him, "I... obviously, you're recovering, but I wanted to ask you about my wand," he explained and dug out the two snapped pieces to hold out. Ollivander frowned and set a cup aside, reaching out to pluck the wood from his hand and examine it closely. "I wanted to know if it could be fixed."
“Alright,” Hermione sighed and shut her book, “If I give you an answer will you drop this?” She asked. Draco frowned. How many times had Harry ranted about this? Clearly enough for her to be exasperated by the topic. Harry gave a shrug. “My guess is that Draco is tired. He’s tired of always being accused of being a traitor by Slytherins, by Gryffindors, by his own family, and now by us.”
"And that's all I can do because he can't even look at me. Why me? It isn't nearly as bad with Ron and Hermione!" He said bitterly. Sirius sighed and sat down in front of him. Harry waited for a lecture on how he shouldn't be upset that Draco was making some progress with them - as if he didn't already
A knot began curling around Harry’s stomach, making his skin prickle slightly. He didn’t like where this was going. Not at all.
a choice on the matter, which was really kind of you, Draco. I would have appreciated the opportunity myself, actually.” He said and pushed him back. “How could you do that to me?” He asked and pushed him again, “Does anyone else even bloody know what you are and what you’re doing?”
“Where is Hermione?” Draco repeated, feeling a wave of panic begin to swirl in his chest. No. No, no, no, no… this wasn’t… couldn’t… “Where is she?” He asked again and when McGonagall didn’t answer, shoved past her to get into the hospital wing. No.
Draco glanced up from the fire he had been staring into. Harry was in his favorite armchair. He had no idea how long he had been sitting there.
Harry paused to find Hermione looking back at him. Only she wasn't in the ripped and muddied robes he bad last seen her in seconds ago. She looked oddly clean in a silk dress that was covered in blood. Harry raised the Death Eater’s wand. What was this? He opened his mouth to ask only for the sound of a door opening behind him to follow.
“Sure,” Draco sighed and looked down at his wrist. Harriet was there, watching with ever changing eyes as if she somehow knew he was under duress. He smiled weakly and ran a finger over her head. Lupin watched thoughtfully.
Harry's heart stopped for a moment before recognizing the voice. Luna. Thank God. She sat at the end of the hall, looking pretty calm all things considered. Did she even know about Draco's anaimgus form? She must have considering how easily she stooped down to pick him up without a single question. Dean was behind her, carrying bags of everyone's stuff with a wary look behind him.
“Hi,” he greeted wryly, “I’m sure you’re both having a lovely moment, but Harry’s score is about to come up and I need Draco to
"I know!" Ron cried, gesturing to him, "It was bloody hard to think of romantic stuff on the spot too. I thought I did a good job. I said her eyes were like chocolate or whatever and that-" Ron began, but was cut off by Draco wincing. Ooh. That would do it. "Was chocolate really that bad?"
"We had a whole thing planned for when this finally happened," Draco complained, "Now we don't even have time to do it! Unbelievable." He grumbled and Harry patted him on the shoulder before giving Hermione and Ron a quick grin with congratulations. Draco wasn't sure how they were going to spin this as 'congrats on getting together, but now Harry must die'. "Ron got a whole speech when we got together," Draco muttered, "I wanted a whole speech."
"Shh," Draco said as he winced. His body protested at any sort of movement, but he forced himself up on his elbows anyways, "Mother, it's... it's fine..." He said and looked around. He touched his robes. Surprisingly, everything was still there. His wand, his watch, his knife, the muting potion he made, and some ingredients he picked up at the apothecary. Perhaps they wanted to give him a fighting chance. He glanced up, noticing his father was also there with his wand out and eyes nervously flicking around the room.
“Draco.” Harry said and grabbed his arm. He opened his mouth as if he had every intention of reminding Draco that he was overreacting… and then possibly realized that Draco would just lecture him on why he wasn’t overreacting because he shook his head instead, “Do you want to write an appeal to the ministry again?” He asked.
hear from you because fuck you for thinking that hearing it from anyone else would have been okay!" He shouted. Harry flinched.
get into the whole thing. The walls of Grimmauld Place shifted from a dark navy to Draco's favorite shade of green, perhaps sensing his distress. Hermione stared around them, bewildered while Ron barely batted an eye. Harry didn't seem to notice as his gaze fixed on Draco's face.
“I asked Cho Chang.” He said miserably one evening as Draco looked at Ron’s robes with a grimace. He had hoped it would be better without all the lace but… yeah. Still not great. Normally, Draco might tease him and say that this relic might be the most high-valued thing he owned, but… the situation was just too sad.
This became more of me spilling off all my HP theories lmao. Sorry about that. Yes. Zoe. She will be popping in and out occasionally with her good/bad luck nonsense as a running gag. I'm thinking of adding a scene to year 4 where we meet her brother and see exactly what happens when they interact. As always, if anybody trans sees something wrong with how I'm writing Zoe lmk. I honestly think that one scene is as blatant as I'll be about it bc 1) she's a minor character and 2) there's no real reason to bring it up again so idk why I would lol. I figured I would confirm it here in case anyone was confused and also to spite JKR.
"Because it was at four in the morning, Draco!" She said and crossed her arms over her chest, "Besides, I'm not so sure you didn't. Harry couldn't look me in the eyes when I asked him." She told him smugly. Draco rolled his eyes. She had no proof either way. Hermione's smile wavered for a moment before sighing to look over her shoulder back the mirror. "You don't have to do this, Draco. There's a lot of people out there and I know aren't too fond of the attention-"
"Whatever, you called her a mudblood. You used the spell in that memory?" He asked, brows furrowing. He internally sighed. Perhaps it had been very subtle. Still, he wished Harry would have picked up on it. How did he not know it was Severus? He pinched the bridge of his nose. Severus looked tense - jaw tightening as the mention of the memory at all. "Why
“Hey,” Zoe Accrington said one afternoon as she slammed her bag down next to them studying in the courtyard. The sky around them brightened a bit at her approach. “Granger, you’re good with charms, right?” She asked as Theo practically sprinted over.
In the following years down the road, when Harry inevitably gave his retelling of their years at Hogwarts, it would include a lot more details on things Draco didn’t really care to do into detail on. Especially about mundane things like Hermione storming out of divination, Twelawney talking like a possessed person, Buckbeak dying, and their very intense quidditch match against Slytherin.
? “Did he cry on you?” He asked and Harry nodded. “Oh. Well. That solves that then.” He mused and turned behind them, “Get him over to Ginny and - you too?” He asked when he saw her sit up. “What the Hell? Were you both just waiting for me or something?” He asked.
“Well,” Draco said when he was done and turned to look over Harry seriously. “I have good news and bad news for you,” he said and Harry raised an eyebrow. “The good news is that I’m willing to rid you of these nightmares that so plague you… for a price.” He said and Harry narrowed his eyes. “Don’t be scared-”
"Do you think Rita Skeeter would give me an interview with that as a quote?" Draco laughed, "Maybe she can lay off of the giant stuff with Hagrid and have a fun time with
Hermione didn't answer him. Not that anyone expected her to considering her anger was definitely still soaring high for Ron's abandonment. He seemed smart enough not to argue with her when she held out her arm.
Oh, he didn’t want to do that. Not at all. Still, Andromeda would skin him alive if he was rude to an ex-auror. As a mother of an auror she demanded the world fall to their knees at the profession. Grimacing, he turned to an empty seat.
“Um,” he said, a bit uncomfortably, “I don’t know. Really fit. Chiseled face. Pretty eyes and tall - not, like,
"...honestly, I think it easier to protect them in the castle rather than leaving them to shoot people here." He reasoned and Jenkins gave a nod of agreement before patting Draco's arm in approval. Severus looked like he might argue, but after several seconds of staring over everyone, only shook his head and grabbed the book wordlessly. A sharp jerk followed as he felt the air around the shift - spinning as a sharp jab came behind his navel and they zipped away. When they landed again, Draco was a little startled to find himself in a room full of children.
"You - but-" Harry tried and then threw down his quill, "Has anyone considered that sometimes I need to be coddled?!" He asked, a bit desperately. Draco snorted, "Has anyone considered that?! I'm under quite a bit of stress, you know!" He added, a bit hysterically. Hermione looked him dead in the eyes before snapping her book closed and getting up. Harry gave a betrayed splutter as she made her way to where Ron had been grimacing by the entrance - clearly torn between wanting to enter and not wanting to be sucked into doing work. "Draco?" Harry asked, turning to him again.
"I figured I should start practicing for day I inevitably poison you," Harry told him and Draco couldn't help but grin at that, "Is this some sort of weird cry for help?" He asked. Draco's smile disappeared. "I mean, first Zacharias Smith and now you're attempting death via butterbeer. I'm a little worried about you, Draco." He said and then reached forward to grab the hand Draco wasn't holding tea in, "And why have these
Draco smiled. He did very much know how to use them. To prove it, he threw one at her - letting magic steer it so it grazed her arm. With a flick of his wrist it came flying back. Bellatrix didn’t flinch. She touched her arm and peered at the cut. The blood on her fingertips turned black.
Thank God. Draco came here to bloody learn. Not save the world. He was eleven. Though… now that they were on the topic…
“Really?” Draco asked as he entered the common room, setting his bag down. Harry looked as though he had been hit repeatedly with a book as he gave a very stoic nod in return. “Good job. How was it?” He asked. Harry considered.
Bidding his mother and Ted a slightly terrified goodbye, Draco trekked over the grounds - making his way over ruins and through wades of people. McGonagall was in the middle of trying to right some of the columns while Blaise and Theo picked up the fallen glass from the Mirror of Erised.
“I do see the concern, Mr. Malfoy,” he said and gave a slight gesture to the wardrobe, “However, as a Gryffindor perhaps there is bravery in allowing others to know your fears?” He suggested. Draco remained unimpressed as he shook his head.
Ah. Yes. Right. Draco forgot the original stupid reason they were here. Sighing, he closed his eyes. A snort of laughter rippled through the others.
“Draco wants to be a healer,” he jumped in fondly, “He’s quite incredible at potions and knows every healing draft out there,” he added and Draco grinned at him, “So we’re working together to figure out a new potion to alleviate the need for glasses. It, um, bothers him for some reason-”
“Montague,” he said as he smiled tightly, “Sorry, I didn’t notice you there. With the hair and state of your robes I thought you must be another Weasley,” he said and gave a feigned look of concern, “Is everything alright at home? I have some extra money if your parents got themselves arrested again.”
“You never met your parents,” he pointed out, “They could have been bad people. Maybe they didn’t even want you,” he said. Harry’s jaw tightened.
is me offering to help you anyways.” He said. Pansy’s mouth popped open - he could see the retort about to leave her lips before her brain caught up with her. Silence fell between them. “There’s a place you can go. Someplace safe during the war. It’s where I sent Theo.” He tacked on. Pansy jerked back.
"This is... incredibly dangerous, Draco," She began and shook her head, "And I'm not sure I can stop you. So I'm just going to do my best to prepare you.” She said and gave a small grimace. “You do know you’ll have to do horrible things… to prove yourself?”
“I’m not-” Harry interrupted and took a long breath as Draco moved to one of the empty seats and threw himself down. There was a long pause. “Can we… just put this on hold for a little bit?” He asked, as if he
can hear it. Aragog said the girl was killed in the bathroom so maybe it gets around through the plumbing.” He explained. Ron screeched and the car revved slightly as they flew over a creek.
Draco reached out, lightly stroking one as Luna and Harry discussed the creatures with the others in hushed tones. Draco smiled a bit at one. They were definitely ugly creatures… but they had a sort of tranquility to them that he appreciated.
“I have two more years to change your mind,” he decided. Draco scoffed in return, "I'll work with Harriet to make it happen." He added. Harriet appeared from Draco's sleeve to hiss at him before retreating, "Are you
Draco spat out his pumpkin juice as Hermione very slowly looked up from her book to stare at Harry for about ten seconds. Ron was the only one who seemed nonplussed by the statement and raised his hand for a high five. Was that what Ron meant when he said ‘test something out’?
the others it was useless to sneak into the Slytherin common room. Harry was adamant that either Pansy or one of the other ‘Slytherin gits’ was the Heir of Slytherin.
“I thought you knew everything, Granger.” She purred, twirling a strand of strawberry blonde hair around her finger. Hermione blinked.
Petunia dropped her purse. Huh. That was that then. Severus knew this muggle woman… and the only connection the two of them could possibly have is Lily Potter. A wave of frustration suddenly came over him as he looked at her.
"Kid, if they're running illegal organ trafficking schemes then they don't care about breaking the rules. I'm a little surprised nobody shot at you though. I guess your little mumbo jumbo thing scared them so badly that nobody thought to shoot." He mused. Harry turned to Jenkins, looking vaguely annoyed that he had sent Draco places where he could be shot, but didn't get a chance to comment on it, "Look, none of that matters because it seems to me that I can just walk outside and shoot the guy with no nose and see what happens. If he dies then brilliant and if he doesn't then I'll shoot again while you lot use your magic stuff to kill him." He shrugged and Jenkins' two friends murmured in agreement.
"Harry?" He tried and when he didn't get a respond, pulled at his sleeve so he could look at him, "What are you thinking?" He asked and then looked over his shoulder, "Was it something Severus said to you?" He asked, thinking of when Severus followed Harry after the others parted. Harry's fingers twitched. "For the love of - I'm sorry. He really has gotten better, but I guess he can still be a prick with you-"
He shouted, but with his broken nose the pronunciation was slightly off for anything to happen. A few of the adults who had been helping spread out trying to either help Dumbledore or gather the injured all suddenly sent an onslaught of spells upon realizing Bellatrix had left her master’s side.
“I think it will be helpful for reconciling me with my parents.” He told her calmly, “I’m afraid I can’t be more specific than that, professor.” He said. Umbridge hummed, giving a tight smile as she folded her hands in front of her, pressing her knuckles to her lips deep in thought.
All too clearly, Draco felt a surge of understanding towards Harry’s anger. If this was what true betrayal felt like… he understood Harry never wanting to speak to Draco ever again.
Harry's eyes were searching. Draco got up to move in his line of sight. Voldemort was saying something, but he got the feeling Harry wasn't listening either as he met Draco's gaze and relaxed. He could do this, he could this, he could this - he
“I think we can find out fairly quickly where your loyalties truly lie.” Bellatrix whispered and lowered her wand. Draco’s stomach sank. He wasn’t sure he liked where this was going. “Grab my arm.”
“Listen,” Draco began “I told Dumbledore not to give me any points. It isn’t my fault this keeps happeni-
“They brainwashed you,” he said simply and Draco reared back, “Normal families aren’t supposed to threaten to chuck you to the side over little things. They told you to be a certain person - and that there was only one
. Draco realized almost immediately how poorly timed this question was given all the information that was revealed.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner..." He said slowly, rubbing the back of his neck. Andromeda shook her head.
“Come with me,” she decided and pulled him out of the classroom. Draco considered objecting but… well, after six years did he really expect that to work? He knew Hermione well enough at this point. He stayed silent until they were at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
"Moony," Sirius called (now back in human form), "I found him!" he said and lifted up Andi who gasped.
"Harry," Hermione began tentatively, glancing at Draco and then Ron, "We were... just talking about Umbridge," she said quietly, voice going a bit weak at the end as Harry's eyes snapped to her with a concerning amount of heat to them. Hermione swallowed, "We just think maybe if there was an adult you trusted-"
“You came all the way down here for that? We sleep a few beds away.” He pointed out. Draco gave a weak smile in return.
“Oh, I found the poor thing wandering about the castle a few weeks ago,” she said, picking it up to kiss the top of its head. Draco had to mask his laugh into a cough. “Normally, she comes and goes as she pleases… I’ve named her Toodles.” Umbridge added. Draco gave a stoic nod.
“Dumbledore says it is going to get moved after tonight!” Harry whispered back, “So you have to see it
“I’m sorry,” Draco cut him off. “I know. I just lost my temper. I didn’t mean any of that - and you’re right. Most of what happened was on me anyways. I wanted to get involved and… I did. That wasn’t you. I lured Bellatrix away on purpose to prove I could handle it.” He said. Harry looked at the ground. “You thought Sirius was in danger. Nobody could fault you-”
“I kept telling you as much,” Draco threw back before snatching the parchment away, “But you were just blinded by the red, weren’t you?” He asked, tugging at his robes pointedly. Montague shook his head.
“I kind of want one for myself.” He said and snorted at the look on Neville’s face. “I’ll see you later.” He told him and then stopped as he went towards the masses of plants. “They would be proud of you.” He said over his shoulder. Somehow the words seemed harder to say if he actually looked at him. “I mean, I obviously don’t know anything about them… but. Yeah. They should be.” He said and took off before Neville could respond.
"Dobby has come." A small voice squeaked. Harry gave a weak smile. He wasn't sure how Sirius had gotten in touch with him so fast, but he was grateful. There was really no telling how helpful Kreacher would be... though Harry did see a rapid rise of concern in the elf's face when Draco's name was brought up.
“Don’t worry,” Neville told him, “I sometimes watched you from the greenhouse. White foxes aren’t exactly common.” He mused, “But rolling around in the mud was smart.” He added and when Draco stared, held up his hands, “I’m not going to say anything. I figured it was something between you and Dumbledore.” He said and Draco buried his face in his hands.
“Sure,” he said and then fixed him with a long look, “There’s also something I wanted to talk to you about.” He added. Harry looked at him - a hint of confusion playing over his features. “I know you’re going through trauma. You saw someone die. Voldemort is back and all that, but… I…” He took a long breath before sitting up and clasping his hands together. “I want to make sure I have the story right.”
