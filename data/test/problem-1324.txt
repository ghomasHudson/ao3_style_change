“That’s different.”
The AA meetings that he’d been going to were paying off. He’d already been to three by the 24
“So, you think that because he’s not pure-blooded, he can’t be bilingual?” Harry asked, his voice shaky. He didn’t know why he was so angry— he just was.
.          Harry took the letter out of her hands carefully, afraid he might rip it. Why had Malfoy written
Harry pretended to pout. He knew that he couldn't sing, but he loved singing to Teddy anyways.
“Now, I have the trinkets all picked out. The list is as follows, so write this down: a silver owl pendant for Cissy, a book on the goblin rebellions for Draco, the Dummy’s book for computers for Arthur, a bronze charm bracelet for Molly, dragon-skin gloves for Ron, The God Particle for Hermione, a one month subscription card to ESPN for Ginny, Robert Reich’s biography for Fleur, Les Dragons en France for Bill, a full-set muggle magic kit for George, Pride and Prejudice for Angelina, The Invisible Hand for Percy, and a lovely denim jacket for Charlie.”
He moved into the next room. This particular room was poorly lit and was filled with tons of furniture: a couch, a bookcase filled with books, several chairs, a table, and some shelves. There was a note on the table next to the entrance. The note read, “Find the key or be trapped forever.”
They continued talking for the better part of an hour. Until, finally, at 10:15, Harry had to go. Ron and Hermione decided to stick around in order to play with Teddy.
Andromeda moved them to the couch and began to offer Harry solace, “He was just trying to look like you, Harry. He doesn’t reali-”
Love Always,
"So what have you been up to, Luna?" Harry questioned.
Draco smiled and turned around to face Harry, “Prepping for econ with caffeine.
"It means speechless!"
“Would you like the free nachos that are included with our happy hour? A purchase of three martinis merits a plate,” Draco burst out. He said it to the space between the two men. Draco paused, understanding that Potter just addressed him.  He wanted to reply and ask what he meant.
“Yes, it is. I don’t understand how people complain about American capital punishment when we have Dementors as prison guards.”
“Um, what? Yeah. Sorry. I was just distracted.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Let’s just go.”
"When I was a kid," Draco said. "I never talked to other kids and I always had imaginary friends and I kept
"I'm fine, and you?" he replied.
Seeming satisfied with this answer, Malfoy went on to craft his own. He said, “Well, if you must know, I’ve been very angry with my parents. It-It’s something that happened about a year ago. As you know, the aurors began to round up Death Eaters and You-Know-W— Vol— You-Know-Who’s supporters beginning on May fifth. So, I was consequently with my parents after the Battle until May seventh. In that time. I decided to tell my father that—” Malfoy stopped. He seemed choked up. Harry waited respectfully and attentively until Malfoy spat out, “Well, I-I decided to tell him that I’m gay. And he...he. Nevertheless, he wasn’t happy or supportive, but he was sentenced to Azkaban soon so that was that. That’s not what really hurt, though. When You-Know-Who was still at large, you know, residing in the Manor, I told my mother— secretly, mind you. And she ignored me. She acted like I never told her. I thought that it was all an act for the Dark Lord, but then, after the war and before she was exiled, she tried to set me up with Astoria Greengrass!” Malfoy stopped to breathe and he looked at Harry.
“Nevermind us,” interrupted Hermione. “Is everything okay? That letter worried us.”
On September 1st, Professor McGonagall announced that Hogwarts would be remodeled in the following year, but (unfortunately) the next year would hold 3 different sets of 1st years (those from last year, those currently, and those for next year). Thus, Harry was required to design speeches, partake in interviews, stage fancy dinners, and pose for photo-ops.

"Hmm?" Harry questioned.
“Language,” Andromeda reprimanded him. She grabbed his arm, and together they apparated to Hogwarts.
“Oh, totally. What do you have?”
“We’re not. I mean, we are but—“
"Hogwarts was an escape for you from your abusive family. Magic was an escape from bullying and being an outcast. Sirius and Remus were escapes from your…lack…of family connections. All these things, Diagon Alley, Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, magic, Hogwarts…. these have all been coping tools for you. And you've been devastated when they haven't been exactly what you wanted or expected. There was still abuse and hatred and racism in the wizarding world. There was still manipulation and untrustworthiness in authority figures. There was still loss and death. I mean…" She threw up her hands and quickly clasped them together, as if scared of Harry's reaction to this information. "I mean look at how quickly you forgave Severus Snape. You look for the best in people, which isn't wrong!" Harry wanted to protest this. He wasn't looking for the best; he was looking for the objective truth! "When you found out about Dumbledore's past, you were crushed, weren't you?" He nodded. "You got angry. You had an episode. Then you got even angrier when Ron and Hermione didn't fully agree with you. You forgot about Dudley's bullying and Snape's abuse when they did one little nice thing."
“Coffee? At this time of night?” Harry joked.
“Yeah…”
Andromeda squealed in reply. She then asked, “Can you hand me the sticks and apples? The caramel is ready.”
“Well,” she said, “You have a lot of seniority. Most people don’t last around here. It’s Sally, Darren, then you. And you know about Darren.” She shot Draco a sly smile. Everyone despised Darren.
“Well, lucky for us, you just so happen to love cooking,” Andromeda winked at him.
[Yes, but he was sleepy.] By the way, your French is getting better. Have you been practicing?”
Draco blushed and put the coat on. They made their way inside.
On the front page, he saw the headline,
.          Draco continued moving his hand closer to the toddler’s. He took his index and middle finger and gradually picked up each of the toddler’s fingers. Draco fought the urge to close his eyes as some of his hair fell out—white-blond strands falling like feathers. They were so transparent that they almost looked rainbow in the sunlight. The lights of his hairs contrasted with the dark black of his shirt and jacket. He thought back to how he cancelled the hair appointment with Fab. Maybe he should make another one, but he wasn’t sure that his hair was strong enough. He almost jerked back when the child loudly whined.
As they walked to the local café, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what his younger self would say if he told him that he’d had a lunch date, or rather an appointment, with Malfoy. Before they walked in the front door of the restaurant, Malfoy said, “Oh, shit.”
Harry.”
“World History, Geometry and Trig, Bio, French Ab, Econ, Philosophy, Sociology, and Art History.”
"Yeah. And the scariest part? I can't remember anything else."
Harry took a few melatonin in an attempt to replace his Ambien. He was going to have a long day tomorrow since he planned on apparating back to Andromeda’s and cooking dinner. He lay down on his new bed. It was still strange to him. He used to sleep in a cupboard. He used to sleep in Dudley’s extra room. He used in sleep at Hogwarts or Grimmauld Place or the Weasley’s or Andromeda’s. He’d stayed in so many homes, but after a while they were all taken away. He wondered if that was another symptom of his mental illnesses. He resolved to ask his therapist at his next appointment.
“Not…really,” Draco said, although it sounded more like a question.
She looked like she’d been staring at the counter too. She was still deep in thought.
Draco still looked confused.
"I did. It was lovely; I enjoyed it. The pens came in handy."
“I wanted to thank you,” Narcissa said to Harry. “for forcing my son to cease his self-isolation.”
.          Draco felt awkward in the silence. He grabbed a random thought out of his brain. Finally, he spoke, “He speaks French.” He meant to just state it; however, it may have sounded more like a question.

Reading, taking notes, and focusing in his classes were not what surprised Harry that day, no. Not even answering questions surprised Harry (after all, Hermione would be proud). What surprised Harry was that, after English class, Malfoy stopped Harry and asked the dark-skinned man to join him for lunch. What surprised Harry even more was that he responded, “Sure, I’ve been meaning to ask you for your help in Algebra. Where are we headed?”

“Finally? I only found out myself a week ago.”
"Forgive me, Potter, but are you joking with me?"
Harry sat and said, “You have to answer mine first.” He paused when Malfoy rolled his eyes, then he repeated, “You have to ans-”
Draco had finished re-mopping the floor thirty minutes after the pub had officially closed. Potter and friends left shortly after midnight, Thomas and Longbottom dragging him out. Draco had held his breath until he could no longer see their heads in the parking lot. That didn’t matter now, he thought. He was going to keep his head down, get his degree, and get a nice little muggle job.
He watched as the children worked. Ms. Claire walked beside him and whispered, “I think they like you.”
Draco arrived to his SALC class about ten minutes before it was supposed to begin. He, and a handful of other students, obvious over-achievers, waited outside the door for the previous class to end. After the doors opened and the previous students left the classroom, Draco watched as the students standing with him chose seats closest to the front. He sat in the back, near the door. He liked the idea of being able to escape if something were to happen. He didn’t know why he still thought like that.
they started to serve Voldemort than I do. ‘They’ meaning my parents. I think that my father always wanted power and my mother followed him into it. I never thought that I’d say this, but I know more about my father than I do my mother. I don’t know how devoted my father was to Voldemort when he was gone, but I do know that he always practiced dark magic—whether it be that book for the Chamber of Secrets or studying horrendous spells. I didn’t really believe my father about the Dark Lord coming back. I was fourteen and pretty neutral in matters of war. Andy, what was it like for you to grow up?”
” Draco whispered to himself. “He better not be bloody
He picked up the letter first and read,
Harry got an excellent night’s sleep: a total of six and a half hours. It was 9 AM, and he and Andromeda were tidying the house. For the most part, the house was not ransacked, so all they needed to do was clean up the stray wrapping paper and wash the dishes.
“Nevermind,” Sally said, “Look, if you’ve only ever smoked it, you probably didn’t experience a true meth high. Snorting it—and shooting it up—gets you
Harry had attended a muggle university in hopes of not running into anyone from the wizarding world, but lo and behold, there stood none-other-than Draco Malfoy.
“Well, a few reasons…I think that given our history in Hogwarts, we always had a rocky…we were always…well, we bullied each other. There’s also the matter of our places in the war: I was a Death Eater and you were ‘the Chosen One.’ Also, our…our friends—well, your friends. I don’t really… Lastly, the press would flip shit.”
They looked at eachother for a second.
“Hey, if you’re—” Harry broke the silence at the same time as Malfoy.
Andromeda burned the first dozen of the rolls and said, "Haste makes waste."
Slowly, Draco pulled away from the kiss. He rested his forehead against Harry’s, an oddly romantic gesture, and said with a hoarse voice, “We should probably get inside. It’s freezing out here.”
“No, no, no!” Teddy jerked his hand from Andromeda’s and started his tantrum. Harry held his breath. The toddler couldn’t have known about what all happened here, could he? Maybe he could feel the energy or see the ghosts… “I wanna hold ‘Arry’s hand! ‘Arry! ‘Arry!” Harry exhaled.
Harry laughed and looked at Draco. He obviously wasn't very accustomed to smoking outside in the cold; his cheeks had picked up a heavy, pink blush that faintly covered his nose. It was times like this that Draco's sarcasm didn't irritate Harry.
“Ron, you know she’d be laughing her arse off.”
"Two peanut butter, two chocolate, two white chocolate and peanut butter."
“I know you’re French, Andromeda, but I was really craving Italian.”
“C’mon, mate. Let’s get you home.”

"I had a panic attack this morning," Harry admitted.
“But you’re still in Britain.”
He took a deep breath and turned around to look at the surrounding buildings. Why was he always so drawn to this place? Was it the sense of calm? The lack of reporters? The seeming normalcy? Harry suspected all three.
[Hello. How is it going?]” Draco asked. Harry loved when Draco spoke in French because it was obviously his most natural language.
,” Draco teased, moving his head closer to Harry’s with every word.
“Oh, Draco,
When he received no answer, he went to investigate. Fear ran through him. What could’ve happened to Teddy and Andromeda in that time? He would not be able to handle it if something had happened. He couldn’t take another death. As he went through the living room and the kitchen, he heard laughter. Harry sprang to action and entered Andromeda’s music room.
Harry nodded. He asked, "Why are you here, anyways? At a  muggle uni-- I mean."
"It was no problem. I wanted to get you something nice. Besides, if you have a watch, we might not be late for class anymore," Harry joked.
“No, Coca Cola,” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Not if it means I actually get to eat the food that I make. Besides, I don’t mind spinach and broccoli.”
“Alright, that’s two fireballs,” Neville claimed, implying that he’d also be doing a shot.
“No?”
"Andromeda has written Nar-your mother, though. I thought that you'd have known by now."
“So,” Draco said. “What do you think of the professor’s reasoning behind the claim that American
“Well, too bad,” Harry joked. Draco yawned.
Harry had had some say in the renovations, perhaps more than he should have. He ultimately left it up to McGonagall, the professors, and the renovation crew, but he knew that he’d have to get involved when they mentioned including a massive panorama dedicated to Harry in the Great Hall. He’d managed to convince them that all he needed, and much more than he wanted, was a small painting of his patronus. At least that way he could pretend like all of this wasn’t about him.
“Hermione?” Neville asked.

to forgive anyone. That mumbo-jumbo therapist bullshit about how forgiving and forgetting will free you? Yeah, it's bullshit."
"Gee, tough crowd," Harry joked.
“Oh. Is it about the…you know…the kiss?”
“Oh, wow,” Harry replied.
“Oh,” was all that Harry could say.
They made eye contact and Draco asked, “Why are you at a muggle uni?”
“What do you like to do, Harry? Who are you? You don’t have to be the Boy Who Lived anymore. Have you thought about your hobbies? Interests? Sexuality? Short-term goals?  These are all very important to your identity.”
“It was a Friday, and there was some sort of football game on the telly. It brings our ‘best’ customers out.” Sally said. Draco did not understand these muggles. What was the point of having a ball game where you couldn’t touch the ball with your hands? More leg-related injuries? Dirty uniforms?
“Oh, don’t let Cauliflower scare you. Sometimes she gets hyper,” Draco informed him.
“Oh yeah. It was weird to think about myself like that.”
Harry jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen. Had the ham and turkey burnt? Merlin, Harry couldn't even remember if he ended up putting them in the oven. When he arrived in the kitchen, he found that both pieces of meat were simmering and that there was a note taped to the stove.
“Uh…not quite. See,” Harry put on his best fake-story voice, “they crashed into a swamp. Then an alligator ate them. And then he pulled out a knife and carved it into my forehead.”
“So, guess who made it onto the Harpies,” Ginny commanded with a smirk.
"You wanna know what set me off?"
to assume that there is nothing else out there.”
“Well...um...I didn’t say that you weren’t okay. I said-er- that I don’t know how you are. Which isn’t a lie,” Harry replied, rubbing his neck.
“Well, the wizarding world is still basically stuck in the 1800s.”
Harry held his breath. He hoped that Draco had somehow overlooked the front page this morning. H replied, “Professor, I mean Headmistress, McGonagall has got a new rule passed that says that sorting will take place on the first day for second years. Something about house unity…”
Harry met Draco at their gazebo. He mentally took in the other man’s blond hair, blue-ish grey eyes, pink lips…his skinny stature, elaborate clothing… Harry shook himself out of it.
Arriving at the house, he called out, “Sorry that I’m so late, Andromeda.”
. He got his Dreamless Sleep Potion and took his normal double dosage. He took it again. He
"I meant that I could help you catch up, prat," Malfoy elaborated.
He walked to the Starbucks on the east side of campus and ordered a white chocolate mocha, Ginny’s favorite. “She’d be proud,” he thought bittersweetly.
"I live with Andromeda now. Your-- er-- aunt."
Harry nodded. He cleared his throat. This damned dry mouth was going to be the death of him. "I have another campus tour today," he stated.
"Nope. She takes care of Teddy Lupin. Tonks- her daughter- and Ted- her husband- and Remus- her son-in-law and our third year DADA teacher- all died. Teddy is her grandson and my godson."
“Hey, mate,” Ron said. “Dazed out again?” The ginger looked exhausted with small black bags under his eyes.
He paced over to the gazebo. Kneeling next to Malfoy, Harry whispered, “Are you okay?”
"Nothing important."
She was slightly taken aback, but accepted his hand and said, “I’m Sally Gala. How are you liking your apartment?”
“Andromeda, that smells amazing,” he informed her.
“Draco! Why?”
“Well, I couldn’t help myself. Narcissa’s always loved owls, Drakypoo is a history buff, Arthur is interested in muggle communication, Molly likes puns, Hermione likes science, Fleur is getting her doctorate in economics, Bill likes-”

The days passed by and it was 8 AM on Halloween. Harry hadn’t slept well and had been going in and out of consciousness since 1 AM. Finally, he decided to get up and make coffee. He put on a hoodie, turn the coffee pot on, and escaped outside for a cigarette.
"What?"
“So,” Harry said. “Ginny got accepted into the Holyhead Harpies.”
“Wha—? Harry! That’s just cruel. How am I supposed to have a partner that doesn’t even look after my well-being?”
“I really don’t give a fuck about the press.”
"Escape route?" he asked, "What do you mean?"
8. You are not responsible for what happened to you as a defenseless child.”
This chapter was much longer than I thought it would be, but enjoy!
“Uh…history. I think that I want a minor, but I don’t know what it’d be.”
Her grabbed her face, forced eye contact between them, and said, “I did not date him. I never dated him. He was never my boyfriend.
Nevertheless, Harry decided to allocate his time to Andromeda and Teddy when he got home. He started by cooking chicken alfredo and fruit salad. After dinner, Andromeda and Harry sat outside drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, and watching Teddy play.
“Haha, very funny,” He replied. He took a biscuit anyways. The familiarity felt nice to him.
Malfoy leaned towards Harry, clearly wishing to whisper; however, Harry stepped back, fearful of Malfoy’s obvious scowl.
“Andromeda!” he screamed before falling into a full-fledged panic attack.
." He smiled, as he knew that he'd gotten that same twinkle in his eye whenever he'd thought about Hogwarts. Maybe this would feel like that. Maybe it'd feel like home.
“Yes?” Harry asked.
Love, Hermione”
“You know what I think is funny?” Harry mused.
“Didn’t you hear me? I’ve been trying to get your attention for several minutes now!” Andromeda said, her voice bordering on confusion and concern.
?" Draco asked.
Harry scooted closer to Draco. He wanted to hug him or somehow physically comfort him, but he wouldn't dare do that without consent. So, he settled for words, "Hey, if it means anything, I don't blame you."
The night continued and Harry was more than glad to leave himself out of the conversation. Instead, he played with Teddy and eventually excused himself to put the infant to sleep and to do homework.

“I’m...confused.”
“Yeah…she’s just protective.”
“Eh, I’m Harry Potter.”

“I’m Draco. Draco Malfoy.”
"Hey, Malfoy," Harry slurred. "Fancy seeing you here."
“Yes, well, he’s forty-five now.”
Chapter 19 will be uploaded Tuesday, August 3rd.
“Merlin, ‘Meda. Did you already look in the bags?”
, yes. I had a bloody house call, and I had to break up a domestic dispute. Like I'm a bloody auror or a police agent. I'm neither of those!" She pressed her palm against her forehead, as if warding off a headache. "It's the end of the hour, and you're my last case. I'm going to go home and drink an entire bottle of some bloody elf wine." They laughed together and stood up, walking out the door. He signed out of the office and apparated to Manchester.
The snow had lightened some in the past two weeks, but the temperature was still steadily below freezing. It was the fourteenth of January, and Harry had been back in school for nearly a week. His second semester had a harder course load, but better teachers. He had signed up perfectly so that he could be home by 5 PM every day. Plus, he had Economics 1 with Draco at 9 AM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
“Hey, bud,” Harry said, scooping the toddler into his arms. “I’m gonna change your diaper, and then we’re gonna eat. Is that okay?” Teddy simply nodded and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.
“Unicorns are a tad bit childish, anyways,” Harry replied.
Harry
“Draco!” he exclaimed, “You’re early. I love that about you. Listen, it’s 3:15, and my kid has a doctor’s appointment at 4. You don’t mind taking over the bar and register for me, do you?”
“You’re too forgiving.”
“Head bartender? What? Since when have I been that?” Draco asked. He nearly laughed at the thought of being in charge around here.
Harry rubbed his eyes. He couldn’t believe that after being prescribed Ambien
.          “Andromeda,” Harry pointed out, chuckling a bit, “He’s practically running off.” They watched as Malfoy’s pace quickened in an attempt to leave the campus. He almost looked like a wild animal feeling a predator. Harry wondered if that’s how he felt.
He sighed and sent the letter on its way. Would his therapist be proud? Probably. He retreated downstairs and awaited a reply.
Harry really had his week cut out for him. It was the nineteenth of April and he had exams to start studying for. On the twenty-second, he was due for his required internship (he was going to job-shadow for a teacher at an elementary school). Then, on the twenty-third, he and Draco would be babysitting Teddy.
"I can understand," Harry said. He
They sat in the theater room for the movie. [AN* Yes, I know that
Harry set Teddy down, much to the toddler’s reluctance and asked, “Moi? [Me?] What’d I do?”
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted.
“Well…” Ron grinned and put his arm around her. She smiled as well.
Even though he saw the same buildings again, Harry felt like he learned a lot during the tour. He probably should have told everyone that he'd already applied to the university through the Department of Magic—they had set up their own wizard-to-muggle education program—and been accepted. This wasn't another prospective student tour: it was an accepted student tour. Yes, he made impulsive decisions, but didn't those always pay off? He decided not to answer his own question.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. He sat down next to Harry.
Draco snorted, “Nope. They claimed that they were, but then they tried to set up an arranged marriage for her. She almost went along with it—y’know, to produce an heir, which was not only super cissexist, but also fucked up—until the story was leaked.”
"How many are enrolled now?"
“Well,” Harry stopped to do his breathing exercises to steady his beating heart. “Me too. And I attend meetings—once every other week—for my PTSD. And they help.”
“You didn’t get to sleep until 3?” Her worry grew.
“We’ve discovered something magnificent about Teddy,” Andromeda told Draco and Narcissa. “When he wants a certain person to hold im he changes his hair color to match theirs!”
“Uh, muggle wise, Legos, a sand box, a train set, a Leap Frog, and maybe a small, mechanical truck.”
try to disappear forever by moving to a muggle city hours away from London and Hogwarts and Etretat, people kept finding him. She continued, “just, um, just grab his hand and take it off your head.”
Harry stopped fooling with his appearance and went out to the small foyer to greet Andromeda and Teddy.

“Cool.” Davie smiled and ran back to the swings.
"So, Harry," Dr. Shelly began, "How have you been?"

Harry snickered at the joke entailed in the last line. He looked at Draco’s second letter.
"You've always been smarter than me, no need to brag."
.          Andromeda gave in, “Maybe some watered-down juice for him.”
“Um, may I help you?” the blond teased.
“Ooh, fun!” George replied. He stopped and glanced at Draco. “And who is this with you?”
“I don’t know. I was considering a shot of brandy,” Harry joked. “You?”
“Yes.”

“Right, right. I’m sorry. That stuff is sensitive to Muggles, isn’t it?”
“Really?”
.          "Are you drunk?" Harry asked.
“Well, we…” Ron looked embarrassed. “We failed,” he admitted.
“Yes.”
“Yes, my dear Draco. I can do hair. I’m rather good at it. Last year, I did my own dreads.” Fab informed him, wiping the tears from her eyes.
“No,” Malfoy spoke up. “I answer one: you answer one. Why do you care?”
sitting at a table with alcohol at it," Narcissa whispered in reply.
"Okay, okay. I get it," Harry bit back. He just wanted to feel normal again. "So what can I do in the meantime?"
“That sounds fun.”
Harry was pondering these facts as he travelled home after his Criminal Justice class. When he got inside the house, he put his bag down and walked over to Teddy. He picked Teddy up and said, “Bonjour, mon petit. Comment ça va? Est-ce que ta mamie fait le dîner? [Hello, little bit. How are you? Is your grandma making dinner?]”
"Yeah…" Harry glanced up at the headmistress. She was smiling nervously. "What? Oh! Yeah. Yes. I accept." Harry smiled back.
“Fourth year?” Ron said, his eyebrows furrowed together.
"Better," he responded. They locked eyes, and Harry moved in to hug her. He laughed. "Merlin, I was worried that this would be too strict."
When class had finished, Harry realized that he spent an hour thinking about Malfoy’s situation instead of what the professor was saying. “Oh well,” he thought, “the PowerPoints are on the professor’s websites.”
“Do you know how long it took me to make this?” Harry said.
"You'd be great at that, Harry!" Seamus remarked.
“Yeah.” Harry mustered up the courage and asked, “Why are you so pissed about it, anyways?”
Harry pulled away from the kiss, then looked to his left where Halloween was devouring a velociraptor. Draco and Harry burst into laughter.
Harry shrugged, “One book.”
“It’s not like you could have helped that,” Draco offered. “You testified at my trial, didn’t you?”
“Teddy!” Harry yelled, drawing out the last syllable.
“Is that how you got that scar?” another boy boomed.
"Why do you think that it was so easy to have one teacher for each subject? Hogwarts has grown more than I, Dumbledore, or any of the Founders could have predicted."
Draco paused in his writing. Was he being too mean? He took another shot of Smirnoff and decided that he didn’t care.
He paced home, satisfied to discover that Gonzalo had locked himself inside his apartment. Once Draco got inside his own apartment, he shut and locked the door. He deadbolted it, just to be sure. He placed the alcohol on top of his coffee table and went to his kitchen. It took him five minutes to devour all the cereal he had to his name. He didn’t waste any time in purging it. After his stomach was settled, he walked back to the living room and sat on the sofa. His cats were asleep; this wasn’t anything new to them.
They spent two hours in the joke shop and then three more hours in Diagon Alley. It was about 9 PM when they departed for dinner.
He did know that he hated his parents. His mother had stopped sending him so many letters, and he hadn’t checked to see if she sent him anything for his birthday. She almost always got him some chocolate, a new broom, and a surprise gift. Now he doubted that she would even be able to afford the chocolate. Aren’t you supposed to love your parents? Family above all else, right? Maybe he shouldn’t hate his parents…?
“He means is this the time wh— Oh, just continue,” Hermione said.
"Pretty bad. I was having flashbacks and I cried for a few hours."
“What?”
The secretary escorted him to the designated classroom and introduced him to the teacher. She was an old lady with a sweet, mellow voice.
“Huh?”
.          "You have classes with him?"
“Fine,” Ron grumbled. “A fireball. And a beer, please.” He paused, thought over his answer, and finally replied, “A Blue Label.”
“You better tell Darren to stay away from that meth.”
“You’ve dyed hair before, right? I don’t have to worry about going bald?” Draco asked, skeptical.
“No,” he said forcefully. “I’m not losing my shit today. Not today. Not now. Not today, damn it!” His body jerked a few times, and he started to hiccup. The rocking got worse. “No no no no no no no,” he repeated. He shook his head with each “no” and started rubbing his hands together. He was told that sometimes “calming sensations” would help before a panic attack. They never did. He counted to ten and backwards in English. He did the same in French. He got to “four” in Spanish before he started to hyperventilate. He decided to focus on the floor.
“Because.”
Draco set his backpack down and walked into his so-called bedroom. With no mattress, pillow, nor blanket, he lay down on the itchy carpet. Draco didn’t remember much after that, but he did remember being awaken at some time in the afternoon by an extremely loud bulldozer and construction crew. He sat up and wiped his face. After realizing where he was, he took a few pills and lit up a cigarette.
“Yes,” Harry said, giggling again. He put his right hand under Draco’s chin and met his eyes.  Draco tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair. They moved closer to each other until they were breathing the same air. Harry felt hot Carbon dioxide meet cold oxygen and he closed his eyes. He felt Draco’s lips on his and deepened the kiss, occasionally sucking Draco’s bottom lip. They continued like that for a few minutes until they pulled away, breathless.
“Hello, I’m so excited to have you with us today,” she said, shaking his hand. “I’m just going to walk you through some of the protocol.”

“Yes.” Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, of course I care. I’m sorry… it’s just that your…your birth mark is looking rather large today.” He choked back a snicker and looked his officer in the eyes.
"No, I taught it," Harry stated.
"That's how it is for me," Draco informed him. Harry noticed a few snowflakes taking refuge on Draco's eyelashes. Draco continued, "I have a massive freak out or nightmare and I hurt myself or drink or snort something. And then I can't even remember what upset me."

“Some.”
“So, you look shocked. Did you think that I wasn’t going to show?” Draco asked.
A couple minutes later, the door sang again. Ron, Hermione, and the Grangers entered. Soon enough, everyone had filed through the door. Harry went over to greet Ginny and Luna.
“Yes! I wanted to hide from you. Merlin, it seems silly now. Oh, and I remember that you thought your father was going to buy you a gift.”

.          Draco thought back to Andromeda addressing this child in French. This little, half-blood, werewolf child with pink-hair. The child who responded in both French and English. Draco unclenched his right fist and slowly moved his hand upwards, as if the child was an animal that might strike if he moved too quickly. Andromeda was very close to Draco. He could make out her frown lines, only highlighted by the dumb, goofy grin that accompanied her face. Had anyone ever been this happy to see him in his entire life?
.          “Yes, well, I thought that it was still important to establish bilingualism in him, regardless of his blood status,” Andromeda replied. She smiled warmly at Malfoy.
Ron scowled. He replied, “How come I let you convince me to paint this on my face, anyways? Why couldn’t you just charm it on? And why didn’t you put any paint on your face, huh?!”
“Really?”
“Dunno yet…you?”
The old woman answered, “They’re never this quiet.”
When he finally got there, he felt overwhelmed. It was obvious this was a class that most of the first-years in the College of Arts, Languages, and Cultures took as a default. Despite there being nearly two hundred seats, almost all of them were full. Harry chose a seat closest to the door. When he sat down, oblivious to his immediate surroundings, Harry heard someone clear their throat. He looked to his left and found himself sitting next to Malfoy.
Because it was Spring, Harry enjoyed his walk to the school. The sun rose around 6:30, the air was warm, and flowers were blooming. Somehow, he knew that this would be a good day.
[You are cute today.]
“So?” Harry asked.
He changed his belt and walked out the door, but heard Andromeda call out, “Now, go woo my nephew.”
After they extracted their Galleons, Harry and Draco stopped by Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Harry briefly wondered what Fred would think of him hanging oiut with Draco Malfoy and if he’d be proud of Harry’s forgiveness. He put the thought aside.
"Well, I do." A grin spread out on Harry's face. He liked teaching. He repeated, "I do."
It only seemed like he had been in the living room for a few minutes when he began to feel Andromeda shaking him and hear her calling his name.
to be high as Hades—typically the same idea, but not nearly as horrible and terrifying.
.          “A bad word that we do not use, Teddy,” Andromeda replied. She groaned at his hair. “Harry,” she addressed him, “What do you mean? Why would you say that?”
Trigger warnings: food, allusions to eating disorders, smoking
The temperature had dropped drastically by 11 PM. Many attendants of Harry and Andromeda's party had left, but some were still present.
Dousselsnorf continued, “Eventually, the Death Eaters must have discovered. One day we went to our respective homes only to find everyone dead inside. Since then, I moved to the Probational Office. Escobar decided to partake in auror training, and he was soon moved to the head position. It was at my request that his office be on this floor.” Dousselsnorf made eye contact with Draco. Draco didn’t break it.
[Why not?]”
George laughed, “Everything here is half off for both of you.”
"Do I think what?" She asked. Dr. Shelly set her pen down and looked up at Harry.
"Both."
The invite list was rather long for a two-year-old’s birthday; Harry knew that, but it was only comprised of the people closest to Andromeda and Harry: the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dean, and Seamus. He had to cook for a total of 16 people, so he wanted to begin preparing as soon as he could. He had already chosen a present for the toddler, a mini-quidditch broom much like the one that he had had before Voldemort—no, he told himself. He would not think about that right now just like he how he wouldn’t think about Lupin and Tonks lying on the floor after the Battle.
This year was apparently different. Harry loved Hogwarts, but he didn’t see why everyone was so arsed to get his opinion. Other members of the DA would also be there, but he supposed that that was a given. The conference was also a feast, and it was somewhat open to the public.
“Do you wanna do this again sometime?” Harry questioned.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “I bloody hate dressing up.”
"Are you all right, Harry?" Luna inquired.
They had arrived at the location of Draco’s apartment.
They walked towards the gazebo and sat down under it.
It read:
“Harry,” she said, handing him four sheets of paper, “I want you to work on these. The first one has two columns; I want you to write down whatever activities you do throughout the day and how those make you feel. The second is just a goal determiner, and the third one is a make-your-own-pie-graph for priorities. What’s most important right now? School, relationships, religion, exercise? The fourth one is called the Gingerbread Man. It shows gender and sexuality as a spectrum. Think you can handle your homework?”
“Forget it!” he screamed. “I wish Hermione were at least here to help. She wouldn’t be laughing at me.”
“What all are they doing? Term started this year, didn’t it?” Draco asked.
“Yes?” Harry responded in a questioning tone.
“The past is the past. People get hurt. They die. They end up messed up beyond belief. But I took this job so that I could help people heal and change. You are still a person, and all of this applies to you. Do you know that, Draco?”
. Four: I was scared for my family. Five: I knew that the Dark Lord would kill me for being gay. Six: he was in my
“Oh, I wouldn’t say I forced him…”
“You’re so oblivious.”
Draco dressed himself in one of the ministry’s bathrooms. His uniform, neat jeans and a black polo shirt, smelled a bit weird as it usually did, mimicking the booze and shitty cheese fries of the bar. Although at first it reminded him of his shitty life and horrible decision, the smell was welcoming to him now. Once dressed, he apparated into the employee bathroom of the Black Cauldron. It more so resembled a broom closet; people rarely entered it unless it was opening or closing time. Draco rarely worked the opening shift, noon to eight at night, but he kept track of who was working if he’d needed to apparate.
Harry
Harry smirked. He really missed Hermione. Ron and Harry started walking towards their classroom.
Draco opened his mouth and then closed it. Andromeda looked at him and Harry thought that they were somehow silently communicating. Draco seemed hesitant.
Andromeda smiled again and replied, “Let’s just say that aurors rather respect and trust anyone with ‘Tonks’ as a surname now.”
“I don’t…I don’t remember how to make a martini,” the assistant admitted. Draco could see a shameful blush creeping up on his cheekbones. It took all of Draco’s self-control not to make fun of him or roll his eyes.
"Nooo!" Teddy quealed.
“H-he
“Okay,” Draco said. And that was that. And that only made Harry like Draco more: because he knew when to drop something.
Harry’s mouth dropped in shock. This was what had gotten under Malfoy’s skin?
“Dark tan carpet with some stains. It feels itchy, but it’s okay. The walls are a pale tan. No, wait, they’re white. The…the walls…” He started shaking his head again. These dumb exercises would never work! Draco finally decided to just let go. He would let himself have this stupid meltdown, and then he’d calm down and go to the meeting, and everything would be fine. He started to sob harder.
"When? When I invited you to the meetings?"
Draco was cut off by Harry's sudden hug. With a wide grin, Harr pulled away and gave Draco a silver box.
aren't mentally ill. So, after the war, I was a little giddy without my parents' everlasting influence. I went to a muggle psych and he diagnosed me with clinical depression and substance abuse. I dunno…after rehab, I've never liked doctors and therapists."
He did not even have to skim the article to understand that someone had overheard him come out to Ginny at the Three Broomsticks. Silently, he folded up the paper and stalked back to bed.
“Je vais le voire. [I’m going to see him.]” Harry walked over to the playpen where Teddy was stationed. He picked the infant up.
Harry arrived home with salads and spaghetti plates from Olive Garden.
Andromeda interrupted, “Mon amour, Harry a l'école maintenant. Il va à l’université pour apprendre. [My love, Harry has school now. He goes to the university in order to learn.]”
Nearly two weeks had passed. In that time, Draco had told Narcissa (successfully, from what Harry knew) and Harry had scheduled a double date with Hermione and Ron for the thirty-first of the month. It was now 7 PM, the seventeenth of March. As an attempt to make their relationship more serious, Draco invited Harry to his apartment. Harry now stood outside the door of Apartment Thirty-Three C, preparing to knock. He tapped the wooden door twice with his knuckles and was greeted by Draco.
"No, Spanish Ab."
“Woah, really? I never knew!”
She playfully nudged his arm. A smile played at her lips. “The short black guy! The one that said, ‘watch this’ and then fucking vomited everywhere?”
“What?” Draco choked on his drink. “There’s no way that they’d want me there.”
Harry had noticed that Draco was a
He got back home shortly after and went in through the kitchen. He glanced at the clock. It was about 4AM. Harry shook his head: the clicking second hand was giving him a headache.
“Really, mate?” Ron’s jaw dropped slightly. He whispered, “I hear that it only gets worse from here on out. I was told that the second year is always dedicated to learning how to properly fill out paperwork and reports and that the third year’s internships aren’t nearly as interesting as they sound. We’re supposed to work from 8 to 6 on some bloody, boring internship. Every. Single. Day.” He banged his head against the table.
Harry sat Teddy in his playpen and proceeded to make French toast and sausage. At 8:30, when there was nothing else to do, he sat down to work on his Earth Science essay.
“So why did you come out here?”
Harry crouched down so that he could be at eye-level. He asked, “What’s up, little man?”
“English 120, Calc 200, World History 112, Euro History, Econ, PoliSci, Physics, and Spanish.”
“I didn’t think it’d be this hard to talk,” Harry admitted.
"I…I really want to kiss you right now," Harry admitted.
“Oh.”
[And you]?”
He came to a stop just next to the Kilburn Building, the school of Computer Science. He giggled to himself. Why would a wizard need to learn computer science? And why was his mouth so dry? He got off his broom and decided that the former question was more important. He started walking down the street.
“What was your sentence?” Harry blurted out.
"Oh, do you miss Hogwarts?"
[Why not?]”
[We have to find a seat,]” Andromeda said. She grabbed Teddy’s hand and led him over to a table.
He shook his head and replied, "Nope. Not even good ones. Is that nor…" he stopped himself. She didn't like it when he said "normal." "…regular?"
With Love,
"I wish that I could do everything over," Draco admitted.
"Thanks, Nev," Harry said. Neville smiled; he knew that Harry only gave people nicknames like that when he was drunk. They continued their journey, which felt
“Have mine,” Harry offered, slipping his coat off and handing it over.
Draco watched the group the entire night. He knew that he wasn’t being stealthy or sly, but then again, he never was when it came to Potter. Not really. The whole group pretty much ignored him except for Granger. She came up to the bar sometime that night and ordered more drinks.
“God damn it. How many reasons do you want?”
Harry enjoyed auror training, he did, but he still did not feel like it was “fulfilling” him as Luna and Hermione swore good careers were supposed to. He often shrugged it off and contributed the feelings to nerves about being an adult. Since the war, Harry had moved in with Andromeda to take care of his godchild. He was not yet ready to live alone, and he certainly was not ready to care for Teddy alone. In the summer after the war and before starting auror training, Harry had spent his time mainly with press and with his friends and Andromeda. The renovations to Hogwarts meant that everyone wanted to know what the “Wizarding Savior” thought of the new school and the adjustments to sorting and if Harry wanted an “8th year” available to the young war veterans like himself and Ron and Hermione. Of course, the Death Eater trials also brought much unwanted press coverage to Harry. Would he be testifying? What did he want each of the Death Eaters’ sentences to be? Did he pity them?
, he thought,
“It’s not like I’m doing it now!”
Harry wasted no time in asking what was on his mind, “When do you think we should tell our friends and family?”
"Oh, I don't know," she admitted. "Daddy wants me to start writing for the Quibbler…"
.          “Oh, no, I’ve got it,” he reassured her. “Anything for Teddy?”
"Yeah…but it doesn't matter." Upon viewing the two blondes' confused faces, Harry added, "I think that I want to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts…at Hogwarts."
By 3PM, Draco actually felt excited to get back to the Black Cauldron. He had been working at the muggle pub for a few months. It was something set up by his neighbor Sally. She resided across the hall from him with her partner Fabienne, who they called “Fab.” He usually worked from eleven at night to five in the morning, but tonight he was working three-thirty to eleven. It was impossible for him to find a job in the wizarding world, and it was rather difficult to find a job in the muggle world with no experience, minimal education, and a criminal record (it merely showed as “political conspiracy”). Draco and Fab were bartenders while Sally worked the kitchen. It was honest work, and it was all Draco had.
Harry groaned at this also. He wasn't too excited for the party. This wasn't because he didn't want to see everyone, but rather because it had been his responsibility to send out invitations and then "thank you" cards. He didn't mind too much because Andromeda had handled the decorations, but he felt that he had done so much work that Christmas was already over.
They continued to talk about Ginny’s career for a few minutes until she finally asked, “So, what about you?”
“Um,” she spoke up, “I’ll have a martini as well.”
, Draco, we were children then.”
Unfortunately, sleep was never a good friend to Harry. When he’d managed to achieve unconsciousness, nightmares darted his way. But instead of being crisp and clear Voldemort-related terrors, these were much worse. Harry’s world was muted and riddled by fog. He was back at the Dursleys, where he’d grown up, and they were trying to shove him into his cupboard—only he was too tall now and wouldn’t fit. And someone was screaming about how he smelled like cigarette smoke and how he burned lunch and then he was being smacked over the head with a wooden spoon and it was almost exactly like being a little kid again. Except it didn’t make any sense. Wait, oh God, unless he was back at the Dursleys, but that didn’t make any sense either beca-
“No,” she replied, “Jason’s bi, Ariana is pan, hmm, let’s see, Al is nonbinary.”
It was always great to have Narcissa come early because she liked to make herself busy. The first few times that she visited, Harry wondered why she helped out. After all, she'd lived her entire life with house elves at her disposal. As of late, however, Harry's come to the realization that Narcissa was now working as a waitress at a muggle restaurant. Like Harry, she used work to distract herself from her grief.
Like every Monday, Harry left the house at 8 AM so that he could get Starbucks and still be on time for his 9 AM Psych class.
.          “Yes, well, I thought that it was still important to establish bilingualism in him, regardless of his blood status,” Andromeda replied. She smiled warmly at Draco. He was so fucking stupid.
“Yeah…” Harry admitted.
"You-Know-Who is dead. Why prolong the war?" Malfoy replied.
"Oh…Well, one, It's called the 'Room of Requirement.' It changes into whatever room you need. So, it was different for us in fifth year than it was for you in sixth. Two, we formed a group so that we could learn Defense Against the Dark Arts."

today!” Harry replied. When he realized that he was moving his arms frantically with his fork still in hand, he put them down in his lap. Hermione always told him that he was overdramatic and had a knack for emoting stories.
"'Fix' you?" Dr. Shelly inquired, "What do you mean? Harry, there is no "fix" for mental illness. We can treat symptoms, but you have to understand that this isn't something that makes you 'broken' or merits 'fixing.' It's all just neurotransmitters and bad experiences." He sighed and bit his lip. He'd been staring at his lap ever since she started her mini-rant. She continued, "The Ambien CR will help you as much as it can. Not everyone's brain is compatible with it, but I think that yours is doing well. You'll take it for about another month, and then we're going to re-analyze where you're standing and how much it has helped you. If you really need to keep taking it, we'll have you go a couple of weeks without it before prescribing it again. People get addicted to this stuff all the time, and the last thing you need is an addiction."
"I never expected you to like teaching."
“Aw, well, I’m sorry. Maybe you should ask Kinglsey for a new one. Someone like…” Harry paused to look around the room. He grinned as he found someone. “Aronowitz. I bet he’d be a perfect partner for you.”

“You didn’t see the Dementor?”
“Um, close,” Harry commented. “How do you get the
“Yes.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry claimed.
Sally brushed her fingers through her girlfriend’s afro and smiled sadly. “I personally hope that we’re not going to spend the rest of our lives in bloody Moss Side. I don’t know about you two, but I have different goals.” Draco shrugged. It was a shitty life, true. He hadn’t even had a mattress to sleep on for months, true. And the apartment complex had a new infestation of bed bugs in it every year, also true. Yet he still liked it there: it had its own personality, and he’d finally grown to calling it “home.” He cleared his throat.
Draco shrugged and didn't move.
“Bonjour, [Hello,] Teddy! Comment ça va? [How are you?]”
“It was too late!” Draco was yelling again.
“It’s okay! You can tell me.” She was laughing now. Draco hated it when people laughed at him. “Aw, look at you. You’re blushing!” She grabbed Draco’s cheek with her thumb and index finger. He swatted her hand away, careful not to hurt her.
“Fine. One: I was spoon-fed pure-blood propaganda as a kid.”
They moved to the checkout line.
Harry knew that Draco was still slightly frightened by cars, so he was pretty surprised when Draco agreed to let Harry drive.
Harry interjected, "And seeker. She's pretty much good at everything because of the competitions with her brothers."
“Harry! It’s fine. Seriously. I know that you’re not doing too well right now, so don’t worry about it.”
date Ginny, didn’t he? Did Harry imagine that entire year?
.          “I’ll write you tonight!” Andromeda yelled after him. She frowned as he got further away. “Oh, dear. Do you think we scared him?”
“Actually, I have. What do you call an ocean that sells drugs?”
“That’s fine,” Harry replied. “You know how he gets after an hour or two of being awake.” Andromeda’s frown deepened, and Harry realized that it was not Teddy that was the reason for her frowning: it was Harry. “What’s wrong, Andromeda?”
“Hmm…I wonder why. It’s not like Voldemort was living in my home or anything like that…”
“Nothing. I just…. Are you all right, Harry?” She asked.
Harry woke up to the high-pitched beeping of his alarm clock. It was 6 AM, and he was intending to leave in an hour. He got up, made his bed, got dressed, made coffee, and woke Teddy up. He poured some milk and cheerios into a bowl, cut up a banana, and began to feed his godson. When Teddy was done, Harry woke Andromeda and said his goodbyes.
“Now, the caramel will cool for five minutes. As I was saying, we’ll have goody bags and we also need to have people giving out candy to trick-or-treaters. Cissy and I have agreed that we’ll do that. As for decorations, outside: we’ll have orange lights, some jack-o-lanterns, and a dancing skeleton. Ooh! We need to carve pumpkins and bake a pie. Also, what song should the skeleton dance to?”
“What are you learning now in Calc?”

“Oh, no,” Harry replied. He joked, “I just didn’t know you were a crazy cat lady.”
How did he forget the turkey? This was an important dinner. How could he just ruin it? How? How?
to act like that while on the clock. When he finally reached the Black Cauldron, he promised himself that he’d shut his brain up. He clocked in and waited for the night, and the high, to pass.
“Why don’t you know?” a tall boy burst out.

Harry took the letter off of the bird’s leg and opened it, viewing the pretty manuscript.
“No, no. Don’t worry about it. I’ve accepted your apology. I was just...surprised.”

"I'm sorry. It's bullcrap. Now, I want you, Harry, to go to this damn tour and enjoy it. Don't place all your hopes and dreams into it or anyone else there. It's up to
"Noo!
“I can’t believe that I’m spending my entire day with Draco Malfoy,” Harry said once in the car.
.          “Has he replied?” Harry asked. He felt that he already knew the answer.
Harry smiled as his best friends spoke about their careers and studies and, well, lives. At some point, he felt a spark of envy. Then, he felt guilty. It wasn't their fault that he didn't know what to do. He was tired of feeling confused. What did he want to do for the rest of his life?
Draco stopped writing for a moment. He wondered if he had written the letter with enough irony and dark humor. After all, his mother had known about his habits for a few years.  He continued,
“Uh—um. Well…never mind.”
While they ate, Andromeda explained that she had written to her sister and was awaiting a reply. However, she was not expecting one: she and Narcissa had not spoken for nearly two decades.
“Every time I see you, I get butterflies,” Draco admitted with a nervous chuckle.
He jumped at the loud knock on his door. He walked to it briskly and opened it to a very skinny, very angry-looking dark man. He scrunched up his face and sneered in confusion when the man began yelling at him in Spanish.
“Your mother was exiled, yes?” Andromeda asked.
[I'm scared!] I don't wanna! I don't wanna!" Teddy clung to Harry's clothes and started babbling out a mix of French and English words. Harry couldn't understand him, so he started to sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."
.          Andromeda nodded and dropped the subject. Harry felt a tinge of guilt.
Draco smirked, “They’re for Andy.”

Chapter 1 TW/CW: therapy m, food m
At 5AM, Draco, Sally, and Fab were extremely tired and more than ready to leave. Draco had had another shot to steady himself out around 4:30—one of the only benefits of this job was the (limited) free drinks. He and the girls walked home. He could see Sally watching him out of the corner of her eye; she was concerned and watching for signs of inebriety. He had previously tried to inform her that he rarely felt alcohol until he’d had at least 5 shots and a few other drinks. That only seemed to worry her more, so he dropped it.
“Oh, yeah, sorry. I was just thinking about how great this place looks now. The renovations have really done a number on it.”
"Then stop doubting yourself."
“Cocaine?!”
I’ve been well-- considering what all has happened. I’ve sorry for not writing to you, but I have been busy. Yes, the rumors are true: I’m attending the University of Manchester.
“What?”
“She’s really worried, you know.”
.          After calming Teddy down, they sat at the table and fixed their plates. It wasn’t until about twenty minutes later that Andromeda brought up the subject they seemed to both be avoiding: Draco Malfoy.

, he was more so excited for his date with Draco. He felt like a giddy teenager: anticipating a movie date.
“You can’t just do that, y’know. You can’t call me ‘Potter’ every time you’re pissed.”
“Well, I’m sorry. It just…really sucks…for you.”
"Fancy meeting you here," Harry said as he sat next to the blond.
"You act as if you know," Malfoy suspiciously said.
There was slight disappointment after Harry departed eu to the fact that the kiss was never discussed. Harry almost didn’t mind because he really had enjoyed spending time with Draco.
“Dunno,” Harry panted. He winked at Draco and they kissed again.
Draco often remembered that moment. He didn’t get the job or meet Fab for another month, but they occasionally spoke and banded against Gonzalo.
I did what I did.”
"Well…" Draco mumbled.
So, it was 10 PM on the 18th of December and Harry and Andromeda were making peanut butter fudge. He was buttering the pan and gathering the second set of ingredients while Andromeda was quickly stirring the nearly-boiled first set.
He was shaken out of his thoughts when Potter gladly added, “And one for me.” The man put his elbow on the counter so that he could get closer to Draco and Xavier. He put up his hand as if he were sharing a secret. “I’m trying to slow down,” he failed at whispering. Draco tried his best not to laugh. He usually loved it when patrons were giggly drunks; they were much better than the angry or horny ones. They radiated a kind of happiness that Draco’d only ever dreamed feeling. He looked at Longbottom, who was shaking his head in both amusement and shame, and tried to keep his emotions masked. His AA counselor told him that he’d feel a ton of confusing emotions after getting clean, but he never told Draco that he’d feel like vomiting and laughing out of nerves at the same time. Potter stepped back, self-awareness spreading over him. “Three….three martinis, please.”
Sexuality? He dated Cho and Ginny, didn’t he? He wasn’t gay. But still…
it? People still do that?”
He walked around the campus for an hour, attempting to imagine a life where Voldemort never existed and his parents never died and he never went through all of the stupid shit with the war and his PTSD—he took another deep breath. He wasn’t going to hyperventilate here. He kept walking.
It wasn't that Andromeda thought badly of muggle universities or education: it was just that she didn't understand
Draco smirked, “Ok, Mr. Bi Who Lived.”
“I don’t know. How?”
“Nah.”
Harry waited outside the door of Headmistress McGonagall's office. It wasn't the first time that Harry had been here since Dumbledore's death, but it still felt as solemn and strange. He swallowed back his peculiar nervousness. He wasn't sure why this meeting filled him with such fear; he was definitely going to get the job. Was it possible that it was dread from Voldemort's curse on the DADA teaching position? No. Perhaps it was just the switch in his life. Harry's therapist said that change could cause panic. Then again, she'd also said that surroundings didn't change: people did. Harry decided that Ginny was right about that being a total load of bull—
The both snickered.
“This stupid shit
the child?
the change.”
he’d picked that particular night to get shite-faced. Harry groaned and set his head down on the desk. He immediately realized what he’d done and snapped his head back up. Several people looked at him. Malfoy, on the other hand, decided to give Harry one of his infamous sneers. Harry rolled his eyes. He resolved to simply ignore Malfoy. Even if it didn’t work in the past, it had to work now. They were both different people than they were then, right?
“No offense, but why didn’t you do that?”
At 3:30, Harry set out the drinks and snacks and finalized the pork roast. The door began to sing and Harry knew that the first guests had arrived. He opened the door and invited Hermione and Ron inside.

“Well, Madi…in a car crash.”

Narcissa took a deep breath— she didn’t look convinced. She finally said, “Alright, then.”
"Thank you. I'm just…flabbergasted."
"Oh…"
“Harry, brake! Brake, brake, brake!”
As he got out the ingredients for stuffing, macaroni and cheese, green beans, peas, and corn, he could feel the day droning on and on. His work continued until 1 PM when he forced himself to take a nap.
“Yeah…it reminded me of the D.A.”
. She told him that they would wait a little longer to formally diagnose him with PTSD because wizard psychiatrists typically did not like to diagnose children—“Young adults,” Dr. Shelly would correct him—with mental disorders.
“Er, thanks,” Harry said. “But I’m not really a flower person.”
“Merci, it’s all from scratch. I was thinking that we could have candy apples— y’know, caramel, sprinkles, chocolate, cherry sauce— and red punch— kinda like a bloody color— and peanut butter-chocolate fudge, ooh! and graveyard brownies.”
"646."
“Oh, y’know. A bit o’ this and a bit o’ that,” Harry countered.
“Andromeda, no!” Harry spoke up. “You’re always welcome.”
“I missed out on nearly twenty years of being his aunt. As the kids say, ‘he’ll deal.’”
He got out his syllabus and pens and waited as more students poured in. Within ten minutes, nearly all of the seats were filled. There were a few seats still empty, of course: some in the middle and a few in the back near him. Draco smiled, happy that he had probably earned a table all to himself. The professor motioned for the people in the back to close the doors. A girl across the aisle from Draco got up to close their respective door, but she paused when another student ran in.
No. He wasn't going to do this again.

.          He fell to his knees and choked out a few tearless sobs. Halloween, his black cat that was missing one eye, walked over to him carefully and slowly. He sniffed his owner and attempted to curl up in his lap. Draco nudged him away and crawled to his room. He picked Cauliflower up and put him out into the living room. He closed the door.
"The Room of Requirement. After the fire…"
He opened the front door, unlocked, and stepped into the apartment.
“Oh. Well...I invited Narcissa over. I should have spoken to you first; I didn’t realize that it would be a problem,” Andromeda said, trailing off.
“Okay. I’ll set you some leftovers in the microwave.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
“Yeah,” Harry replied. “You saved up, though. Right?”
“’Ey, he’s a good worker,” Jerry said, handing Draco his name tag.
"Wow," Harry said, amazed.
I have great news! The Harpies want me on their team. Can I share the details with you over lunch? I have so much to tell you about!
The night droned on and Harry choked back a strange sense of nervousness. Having Malfoy visit his home wasn’t that big of a deal, was it?
Draco nodded.
“Well, according to Hermione, it’s only a ‘promise’ and their actual wedding wouldn’t be until, like, eight years from now.”
[Yes. How did I forget?]” Narcissa continued to baby-talk Teddy while Andromeda spoke to Draco.
"Wow, this much have been—" Draco started.
“What do I know?”

“Is this it, mate?” Ron asked.
Harry”
He got out some of his writing parchment, a quill, and some ink. Draco wrote back,
"Harry?" she asked again. Her smile slipped a little.
.          Harry opened the window to let the owl in and got out the owl’s water bowl. He took the envelopes off its leg, and he read them aloud, “Bill. Bill. Bill Weasley. Madam Malkin’s. Witch Weekly. Junk. Draco Malfoy. Junk.” He threw them onto the kitchen table, but he nearly walked away before he realized what he just read. Harry went back to the table and picked up Draco Malfoy’s letter.
“Do you
.          The air immediately gave off a sharp, putrid smell. Malfoy and his clothes emitted a mixture of cheap vodka, beer, and cigarettes. He stumbled a bit as he walked to his seat.
Malfoy bit his lip and nodded. They sat next to each other in silence for a while until Malfoy cleared his throat and asked, "Why are you being so nice to me, anyways?"
say that?”
.          He looked back at Potter. The man seemed to be attempting to feign an indifference to this train-wreck, but he was failing miserably: his face was shaped with amusement and slight worry. Did he think that Draco would
“Oi, Draco! Two Pimms and Lemonade. And cut that spacey thing out; we’re still busy,” Sally announced to him. He glanced at her a few times while he made the drinks. Her hair was loose, and her bright pink bangs covered her left eye. A bead of sweat was making its way down her forehead as she took orders, handed out beers, and collected bills. He went back to concentrating on the drink orders.
Malfoy sighed again and sat on the ground. After what seemed like forever, he finally spoke, “Potter, why do you care?”
“So much for ‘slowing down,’” Draco muttered. He heard Longbottom snicker.
“At least we want to do this,” Harry pointed out. “Some of the older wizards here only do this for the money or the ‘fame.’ Why would someone want to be famous from an auror career?”
Andromeda responded, “Very confusing to say the least. There’s something very…appealing…about being told you’re better than others. And scary—because obviously not everyone believes it. When I was a kid, it was easy. Bella was the eldest and she undoubtedly held up whatever Mum and Father said. I wanted to follow her footsteps so badly. Cissy is the youngest and perhaps the most introverted. I never knew what
Harry chuckled, "No, no, no. I know that I can't sing. You know what I
“Où tu es? [Where are you?]”
“Well, the Ministry would never hire me…and I don’t really care for Quidditch.”
He walked to the kitchen after getting his much needed coffee and cigarette.
Harry sighed. Luna reminded him too much of his therapist.
“How?”
Ginny raised her eyebrows and replied, “Yes, of course.”
Andromeda nodded understandingly and said, “If you don’t mind me asking, what was going on during the war? Your mother won’t…she doesn’t like to talk about it.”
Harry was currently sat in the Admissions building, waiting to hear back from the School of Arts, Languages, and Cultures. If he got accepted, he was going to do the Religions and Theology course. He smiled to himself and went back to reading the University Life magazine that he grabbed.
He replied, “That sucked.”
Harry smiled and said, “Thank you, Andromeda.”
“We really have got to quit doing that,” Harry informed Draco.
“Is that how you stopped drinking and doing drugs too?”
As he walked past a small picnic area, he noticed a blond head of hair in a gazebo. He got closer and heard what he thought to be hyperventilation. Harry briefly argued with himself. Should he comfort Malfoy, or just walk on? It took roughly five seconds for Harry to decide.
That’s amazing—and terrifying. How many gnomes did Andy find in her garden exactly? I think that she amay’ve set a world record.
.          “Draco?” she yelled. She walked towards him, Harry and Teddy following her. “Why, I, I haven’t seen you since you were a baby! Do you remember me? It’s me: your aunt Andy. Andromeda, that is. Do you remember? I’m your mother’s sister. I, she, I couldn’t see you. I wasn’t permitted to see you after you turned one. How are you? How have you been? Are you okay? Do you remember me?”
They grew silent again.
“I have Business 101 in five minutes and Introduction to Psychology at 6. You?”
Harry and Draco meet once more when Draco attends Andromeda's dinner.
“Yes, bu—hey..”
“Yeah,” he said. Her words confused him a lot. He hadn’t dissociated since the Halloween after the war. God, he was so confused.
wizarding neighborhood. The press was only becoming more and more overbearing since McGonagall announced that Hogwarts would be looking for professors for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. Who did Harry think was worthy of the position? Did he think that it was still cursed? Did he think that Ron's older brother, Charlie, would be selected as a professor? What about Neville Longbottom?
Harry laughed, “I know. I just…needed an ice-breaker. I need to talk to you.”
“And all of this is going to be from scratch?”
Harry remembered when he found out that he was asexual. It was a few months after the war. He and Ginny had had many intense makeout sessions, and, yeah, he was into it. But when his shirt came off, he couldn’t do it. He apologized to Ginny because he must be broken, right? Don’t all people want sex? It was Ginny who told him that he wasn’t broken and that it was all right. It was Ginny who told him that, no, not all people want sex. Asexuals don’t experience sexual attraction. Demisexuals don’t unless a strong bond is formed. Grey-asexuals do, but only sometimes. And so on. (AN** I am allosexual so, if I have something wrong, please correct me and I will change it.)
, though. I'll get them after I see my sister."
He opened the door and welcomed Draco in.
“Hands, kids,” Ms. Claire interrupted.
Harry faked a gasp, “She does?!”
"Oh, well, what about your dad?"
They arrived at the restaurant and Draco got out first so that he could open everyone’s doors—a pointless but polite gesture. The night continued as they had a thirty minute wait for their reservation due to arriving early. Draco sat right next to Harry, and the latter could practically feel his heart beat up to his Adam’s apple.
Andromeda stepped in and responded, “Non, elle fait un gâteau pour ce week-end. [No, she is making a cake for the weekend.] Harry, I don’t know what  you did, but, whatever it was, it worked.”
“Graveyard brownies? What’re those?”
“Besides,” Harry said. “

for the party."
“Ouch! You stupid, bloody bird. Get out of here! Go on! Fuck off!” Draco screamed at it. He glanced at his finger and threw the mail in the garbage.
[AN*: major trigger warning for panic attack and repetition] Harry folded up the note and wiped away a tear. His throat began to contract and he felt as if a train was using his chest as its track. He knew what this was. His therapist had given him instructions for what to do for panic attacks. But, at this time, Harry couldn't concentrate on where he was—let alone counting to four.
“You’re such a weirdo,” Fab stated. They all laughed. “So, am I doing your hair before work tonight?”
right now?
When he burst through the door, two women stared at him with wide eyes.
Harry had his first exam Monday, June 5
Draco sighed. He had a meeting with his probation officer today at 1PM. He groaned as he poured himself a cup of coffee: he hated those meetings. He didn’t need to meet with someone twice a month just to talk about all the dumb mistakes he’d made in his life. He could easily remember those each time he looked at his left arm.
He wondered why he wanted to touch Draco's face so badly. Then, he realized. Draco's presence was always comforting and Harry could easily tell him anything. He paid special attention to Draco's hair and eyes and lips and clothes. Harry took a deep breath. He had a crush on Draco.
“Oi, mate. Are you gonna eat that?” Ron asked, pointing to Harry’s broccoli chicken casserole.
It took him only ten minutes to remember whom he was missing.
floor. The office of the head of the Auror Training Sub-department was stationed in the Probational and Minor Offense Department due to the fact that the head was often involved in probationary hearings. Harry was frightened about what would happen when he turned in his withdrawal form, but he knew that it was for the best. He knocked on the auror’s door.
He stepped back, breaking their eye contact, and asked, “What drinks would you like? We currently have our special Black Cauldron Potion, which is a mix of tequila, dark rum, and cranberry juice.”
6. No one can hurt you.
Everything went fine that day—or as fine as it could be in the state he was in. He sat and people-watched for a few hours, he got something to eat, and he walked around for a bit. He got home at 4, made dinner, socialized with Andromeda, and played with Teddy. He didn’t even take any Dreamless Sleep. He wasn’t sure that he ever wanted to touch it again.
“You wanna walk to class together?” Draco asked.
“A little bit.”
“Today was the first time that I’d seen wizarding news since I was seventeen.”
“I hate being poor,” Draco said.
Finally, he groaned, “What the fuck? It’s not even spring yet. Shut the hell up, birds.”
“Piggy-back ride?” the blond asked.
read his notes and memorize them, he’d still be missing the vital information from the past month.
"I'm okay. You're sweating. Are you sure you don't need some water?"
“Listen,” Draco said. “I’m sorry...about those news articles.”
"What?"
“How is he?” she repeated.
angry. She hardly knew him. How the bloody hell did she think that she could make these assumptions about his life when
“Lovely,” Draco said. “What do you think?” he asked Harry.
“What?” Harry asked.
"Our seventh year has 52 students. Sixth year—61. Fifth—85. Fourth—92. Third—105. Second—95. The first year has about 156 combined. There are so many more muggleborn students."
He wasn’t too worried about the semester—all of the classes would be easy enough. He was taking Constructing Archaic Greek History from 8AM to 10AM on Monday and Friday, and Wednesday from 9AM to 10AM; History in Practice Tuesday from 4PM to 5PM, and Thursday from 3PM to 5PM; Cities and Citizens from 12PM to 2PM on Monday and Friday, and from 12PM to 1PM on Wednesday; and Standing on the Shoulders of Giants from 2PM to 4PM on Tuesday, and from 2PM to 3PM on Thursday. Draco was always good at school work, and he knew that. The only class that he
"Harry, you scheduled this appointment!" McGonagall exasperated. "Are you trying to convince me that you don't want it?"
Harry assessed his friends and inhaled. He counted to four and exhaled.
“Really?” Malfoy exclaimed, flabbergasted. “There are five ingredients, and one of them is ice.” He rolled his eyes and continued, “I’ll do the martinis. You can do the shots and beer.” Malfoy put a bottle of water on the counter. His eyes darted between Harry and Neville as if he didn’t know which one to address.
"I was just…so scared."
“Th-they’re dead!”
Draco was very confused. In fact, he hadn’t been this confused since third year when he found out he was attracted to an older bloke on Slytherin’s quidditch team. No, this was nothing like questioning his sexuality. He just wanted to know why the bloody hell Harry freakin’ Potter had showed up at The Black Cauldron. Yet there Draco was—serving the bloke and his golden friends alcohol.
He arrived at Andromeda’s only to hear the toddler yelling and screaming. His hair was black and curly, as if he was attempting to mimic his godfather. Harry smiled. If this was how powerful Teddy’s magic was so far, he couldn’t wait to see it when the boy went to Hogwarts.
“Yeah.
Ron’s face went as red as the gem, and Hermione grinned. They all left the room to go chat and Harry opened the door to let the rest of the Weasleys in.
their relationship was about. They had written each other often and had even developed inside jokes. As far as Harry knew, this made them at least friends. Yet also as far as Harry knew, friends didn’t really kiss. So was this thing with Draco platonic or romantic or something else all together?
Sticking out his right hand in an offer to shake Narcissa’s, he asked, “How have you been?”
“Woah! Don’t leave me,” Draco called.
“No,” Draco said adamantly.
Draco bit his lip, "Thanks."
“Meow,” they heard.
They shopped around for a few hours. Harry found Andromeda a cashmere sweater and expensive sweets. He got Ron a strawberry cheesecake and some classic muggle movies—Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Back to the Future. He got Hermione a few chemistry books and a scarf.
.          “Of course,” he replied. As he walked down the stairs, he mentally reprimanded himself. How the bloody hell was he supposed to sit through an entire dinner with Andromeda, Teddy, and Malfoy?
He was walking home after his Art History 101 class, but he wasn’t focusing on the travel. He’d checked his watch every few seconds, but sit still said a few minutes past 4. Why was time going so slowly?
“And how do you know that…?”
.          Teddy woke up an hour and a half later, giving Harry and Andromeda enough time to talk about what university was like. He talked of his classes, his studies, the buildings, the campus, the food, and the social life. While it was true that Harry had not yet made any friends—he’d formed a study group with a few people for his Islamic Studies class—he had still seen and heard of the parties every weekend. When he saw Andromeda’s frown, he assured her that he was there to focus on studying, not drinking.
“The same reason why I won’t help with Hogwarts!”
Harry grinned. "Well, I expected as much."
“Okay,” Malfoy consented. “I’ll go first and then you can wait a few minutes and go. So people don’t think we were skipping together.”
For the first time, Harry felt like he had it all worked out.
“So was I.”
“Pot, Ritalin, coke…”
“Have you dabbled in any wizarding drugs, such as Magic Dust, Flying Dragon, or Busty Boo?”
Harry ran down the stairs. Once he got to the kitchen, he exclaimed, “It finally came! Yes!”
.          Draco unlocked his door as Gonzalo sputtered. He slammed the door shut when he got in. It was only then that he let himself fall apart.
. Draco commented that this was ironic because Harry hated politics. They both laughed.
“What about me?”
"Oh, yeah. I exchanged scarves a few minutes ago."
“You know what I mean.”
"I'm fine," he repeated.
“Boys! You always have your minds on food,” Hermione chimed in.
[Yes!]”
“Um, yes.”
They moved on to find Pansy Parkinson’s gift.
"I get to set up my classroom and all that jazz in mid-July, then I go full-time along with the students. I never thought that I'd see the Hogwarts train again…"
for so long that he didn’t even know who he was anymore. It was exactly five years since he started snorting coke, and he was popping pills, cutting, and starving long before that.
“It’s all right,” Narcissa said.
.” Harry groaned and put his head down on the desk. He felt like he was never going to catch up. After his embarrassing melt down during the obstacle course, Harry missed class every time he felt slightly anxious.  As a result, even if he
“I’m not sure.”
“Why, of course!” Harry faked a posh accent and began to search through the recipe book.
“Water,” said Luna.
They stopped at the holiday-special section and went over to the bracelets and rings. Draco’s eyes automatically fell on the sterling silver and emerald wristwatches.
He blushed and replied, “
Harry went back over some of their letters and recalled the first one, from Draco:
"You're wearing your watch," Harry attempted to make conversation.
“Dearest Ron and Hermione,
The other children ran to acknowledge Harry, asking for his name, age, and normal job. Ms. Claire smiled as they asked if he had a wife or kids or, more importantly, any pets. She politely told them to carry on like normal because Harry would introduce himself when everyone arrived.
Draco started to curse in French.
Harry giggled and scooted closer to Draco.
Harry hadn’t slept in three days. The Battle of Hogwarts Second Anniversary was a week ago, and he was still just as depressed as he was last Tuesday. He checked his clock again. Only five minutes had passed since the last time he checked his clock, making it 3:06AM. He pulled at his hair, frustrated that he just could not be normal no matter how hard he’d tried.
“Amanda,” she beamed.
He exhaled and began to read off the list:
Harry opened the car door and stepped out.
The only thing that Harry was dreading was his therapist appointment. He decided that he would tell his therapist about his persistent insomnia and nightmares.
and the 3
?" Draco questioned.
He waited a minute before she responded, "The one with less people, then."
“What’s up?”
“Where did you even get the idea to do muggle drugs?”
"Oh, well I've been looking for wrackspurts and also trying to learn a bit about Quidditch. Ginny's playing for the Harpies, you know."
Harry shrugged.
"Charlie Weasley, of course! Haven't you been told? He has a way with dragons."
“Am I just gonna express remorse and you’ll propose your love for me?”
"Teddy!" Harry called out. "Do you want to go to bed or do you want a time out?"
“I just don’t understand,” Harry said. “I’m sorry.”
Aware that he could not possibly avoid the thankful onlookers, Harry kept his head up while he shopped. He wasn’t going to hide— and maybe, just maybe, his dad would be proud. He wondered if that would cancel out his assumption for Dumbledore’s feelings, but then filed the thought away. Once at Honey Duke’s, he bought chocolate frogs and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and licorice wands and fizzing whizbees and cauldron cake. Harry wanted this Halloween to be amazing for Andromeda, yet he also wanted to please Draco and Narcissa. He did not know why he was so worried about that.
.          “Sounds good,” she replied. She looked genuinely happy. “If I were to see Draco over dinner or something, would you like to be there?” She looked at Harry expectantly.
Harry asked, “How do you know?”
Draco smirked at Harry’s stupor. Both men arose and walked inside.
Draco Malfoy turned his head to his left, spotted Harry, and muttered, “Oh, Merlin.”
"That was great. I couldn't have said it better myself."
“Well, it’s 5PM.”
of September, and Harry had just finished up his classes for that day. He’d promised to give Andromeda a tour of the university that afternoon. Harry was going to take the floo to their house, then they would all apparate to Harry’s together, as Teddy had some sort of vendetta against using the floo.
“Y’know, this is the place where we really first talked,” Draco said in a tone that made the fact sound like common sense, but not common knowledge—like the differences between Inferi and ghosts.
.          Andromeda’s grin fell a bit. “Oh. Well, could I write you? You must understand that I haven’t heard anything about you for years. Merlin, how old are you now? You must be…” She grew flustered as it became apparent that she’d forgotten.
Draco shrugged, "Whatever a person can do with a history degree in the muggle world."
at the bottom. Between the bottom of the window and the top of McGonagall’s picture, there was a modest mural of Harry’s patronus.
He got to the restaurant at 5:15, but waited outside for Draco. Five minutes later, the blond arrived. His hair was slightly gelled and he was wearing a light blue button-up shirt and dress pants. The colors complimented his eyes, but he looked extremely cold.
Draco rolled his eyes.
buying her something,” Harry said.
Harry grabbed the Tupperware containers filled with spaghetti and salad. He decided to sit in the living room and desperately hoped that Teddy would not want to play today. Harry was developing a horrible headache, and with everything that was going on, he didn’t want the toddler to see him breakdown.
“I was lonely.”
Harry
“I will now take roll,” announced the professor, an old man with a hoarse voice and vivid sweat stains.
The Malfoys’ visit came and went fairly quickly. It was awkward at first because it was Draco and Narcissa’s first moment interacting for hours at a time in almost a year. It was also awkward because Harry had made a conscious effort to call them Draco and Narcissa, instead of Malfoy and Mrs. Malfoy. And then it was also awkward because Draco had no idea how to interact with a child— let alone a part-werewolf, metamorphmagus child. However, everyone made sure to act in such a way that would facilitate comfortable feelings for everyone else. After four hours of communication on Sunday, none of them felt like strangers anymore.
“I’m glad you finally told us, mate,” Ron said.
Draco sighed and said, “Okay, let’s go.”
mean….mean…” Teddy stopped talking as a confused look spread across his face. He looked at Andromeda.
“It just…is,” Malfoy answered. “No one else understands
. He had finished it fairly quickly since it was just a written portion on Anti-Deadly Disease Wards. Going into the exam, Harry assumed that the hardest part would be remembering the difference between the old Latin, Arabic, and Greek names, but once he finished, he realized that he would be lucky to pass at all. His suspicions were confirmed later that day when the results were posted: he had failed massively.
.          “Y-you, too,” he heard Potter stutter as he walked away.
“Draco,” Sally called, attempting to get his attention. “Are you in space? What’s Mars like?”
“Is that even bloody normal for a mug—” he stopped himself. He continued, “mucky pub like ours.”
Harry smiled to himself as he walked towards his flat. He loved the toddler so much that even his little quirks and tantrums were adorable.
think that he would hurt it? He looked at her expectantly. She apologized, “I am so sorry about that. He…he hasn’t learned boundaries yet.”
“Okay, Okay. I get it. Also, ‘Drakypoo’? I don’t think he’ll like that.”
.          Harry climbed the stairs quickly, skipping every other step. Once he got inside the bathroom, he handed Andromeda the unopened envelope. She dried her hands and opened it in a rush. Her hands were shaking slightly from nerves. Harry watched Teddy.
"There's still much to do," she said.
“Why not? I hear
“Oh,” Harry remarked.
“You don’t have to be so sarcastic. What stuff were you doing?”
Harry looked away as Malfoy sighed. Two classes? This was ridiculous.
“Me too,” Harry replied, grinning.
“No,” Harry lied. “The melatonin helped with those some.”
Harry smiled shyly and shrugged. They moved closer to each other. Harry relaxingly put his arms in Draco’s shoulders because the latter was taller. Draco put his hands on Harry’s waist. They tilted their heads and leaned closer.
“Teddy,
Draco rose and dusted off his pants. “I did
“No,” Ron replied. “It’s a promise ring.”
“Because I’m already brown, mate.” Harry giggled a bit at the sight of Ron’s face. “Wait, I think you’re getting some of the red back in it!”
“I-I’m sorry,” Harry spoke up. “I don’t know why I’m so angry. You did nothing wrong.”
The next few minutes went on and Harry told them all about his hobbies (well, reading and cooking) and Teddy and Andromeda.
Draco cleared his throat, “Who do you want to tell first?”
They were about to go inside when Andromeda’s owl arrived with two letters. One for Harry and one for Andromeda, respectively from Ginny and Narcissa.
"Sorry, just…thinking."
"I took the Ambien about an hour before I laid down. I laid down around 10, but I don't think I fell asleep until 12. I'm not sure, though; I tried not to look at the clock. For the first night, I didn't wake up due to a nightmare or whatever. I do feel really sluggish though," Harry replied. He'd been seeing Dr. Shelly for a while, so he had learned by now that she liked details—not only because it helped give her information but also because it helped her know how Harry's memory was doing.
"I'm happy for you."
," Draco hissed. "Stop treating me like a baby."
Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry smiled. Of course his best friends would accept him.
“Harry—“
“That’s that.”
"Do you think…" Harry trailed off. He shut his mouth and silently prayed that she didn't hear him.
“Come on, Andromeda likes bracelets,” Harry said. He grabbed Draco’s arm and led him further into the store.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows and said, “I’m sure that there was at least one time.”
Dousselsnorf pointed towards the door and said, “Now, you walk out of here, and you never walk back in here, okay? I hate it when people get out only to be sent back in again.”
Harry’s first couple class sessions went rather well: he had read every assignment and written every essay required of him. It was now Monday, the 25
Harry grinned. “Merci.” He watched her for a few minutes before asking, “So, what’s on our agenda?”
The Great Hall had suffered the bulk of the destruction and despair, and that was obvious when one looked at the final renovations. When Harry last came for a conference, the Great Hall was only halfway done. The walls had just been finished, but were unpainted. The tables were a temporary, cheap wood. There were no chandeliers, only sconces. The big window had been replaced with a cheap, semi-transparent glass. So much had changed. The walls were painted with their traditional tan, but now they were also covered in art and murals. Each person who died in the fight against the Death Eaters was given their own mini-painting. There were ten long tables for the students, as opposed to the traditional four grand tables. This was an evident move for house unity. The professors had one grand table at the front, the throne-like chair still sat for the headmaster. Seasonal wreathes were positioned under each of the sconces—resembling modern looking lamps magically lit by fire. There was an elegant glass chandelier over every table. The big window was now a mosaic with Hogwarts’s logo, each house’s representative animal, and
“Well, no. I just, um,…” Harry paused, trying to think of something. “I was too busy studying for exams, y’know. I was pulling an all-nighter, and I decided that I’d take a nap. Then I woke up at 6, and I realized that I should probably just go to school tomorrow. To training, I mean. Not school. It’s…it’s not school.”
“No, it’s not,” Draco stated. “They had no business forcibly outing you. Nor sticking labels on you without your permission. Your sexuality is your business and your business only.”
3. You are not dirty.
“Have a biscuit, Potter.”
.” He let go of her face and brushed his hands through his hair. He felt his face. It was definitely red.
“I want to get her a matching necklace and earring set,” Draco informed him. “Ironically, she’s not really a snake person. She likes unicorns. I think that she fell in love with thwem after our Care for Magical Creatures classes…”
Draco
"I don't want special treatment," Harry announced.
“Oh,” Ginny said. Then, as an afterthought, “Who else knows?”
“Well, typically you move your mouth and then your larynx—“
“Right,” said Malfoy, tossing the cigarette butt behind him. “Well, I’d better head to class.”
“I’ll have you know that I haven’t killed anyone or offed myself yet,” Draco spat out.

Harry started laughing. "'White Suburban mum.' Are you doing okay? Have you had a hard week?"
Harry continued to sit outside so that he could watch the sunset.
“What year were you born?” a blonde girl asked.
“Do you have anyone else left?” Draco asked at 3 PM.
“New dorms? I read in the

"Did you just make that up?"
[Yes, and you?]”
“I almost forgot. I have a recipe for it. Would you like to start on it now?”
“Seriously?” Malfoy asked.
“What know what, Draco?”
Draco confided, “It’s weird being poor.” He laced his fingers through Harry’s,

Harry grinned back, but suddenly worried if Andromeda knew more than she was letting on. He went back to his room, got out a pen and paper, and wrote,
“You know why.”
really
“Yeah?” Harry replied in a questioning tone. “Why? Isn’t it a normal Thursday?”
Andromeda smiled in response. She pulled the rest of the food out and put their milkshakes in their magicked freezer. When Harry moved in, it seemed that they had silently agreed to have a mixture of muggle appliances and wizard technology. Andromeda shook her head when she pulled out the third burger.
“It was fine. I just...I saw Draco Malfoy.”
“Of course it’s okay. It’s just…” Harry cleared his throat and said, “You’re not...making this too scary, are you? I’m-I’m not the only one who has been affected by death in the past year and a half— Merlin knows— and I don’t want anyone to be frightened.

“Well, semi-coercing him…” she corrected herself. Then she admitted, “Draco hasn’t been well since after the war. He has been dabbling in muggle drugs and alcohols-“
“‘Arry!” Teddy called out suddenly and raised his arms.
Harry rolled his eyes. “How many times have people asked me that in the past several years? You hear one speech, you hear ‘em all.” He took another sip of his coffee.
[So-so.]"
“Yeah,” Harry affirmed. “What about you?”
to believe that there’s something in everyone that can still be saved. I can’t give up on the last of my family. Even if Narcissa won’t speak to me, I can still have my nephew.”
"But…" Harry trailed off.
“Well, I’ve given it a lot of thought and I have realized that I am biromantic and asexual,” he informed them.
“How do you know that?”
Around late July of 1998, Harry moved in with Andromeda and began to assist in caring for Teddy. It was strange, as Andromeda has insisted on only speaking French around the infant so that he would grow up to be bilingual (a Black family tradition). As such, his only company until September was Andromeda, Teddy, Hermione and her family, the Weasleys, Neville, Dean, and Seamus.
Once inside the store, Draco merely stood by the door, looking at all the glittering merchandise with wide eyes.
He sighed again as he went to untie the letters from the bird’s claws. It pecked him when he removed the letters from its mouth.
“Why am I so bloody fucked up?
Harry gasped and had to will himself to gently place the young metamorphmagus down. He tried to steady his breathing, but to no avail.
“Why were you ever?”
Harry rubbed his face. Arts? No. Music? Merlin, no.
Harry ate at McDonald’s that night for dinner and then apparated home at 8. When he got home, he began his homework and studies. He finished his take-home Intro to Psych test, read his assigned book for English and looked at its associated essay rubric, finished his essay for Earth Science, and looked at the Algebra PowerPoints. He decided that he would need Malfoy’s help. Seriously, who understands polynomial division?
“Draco!”
“Um...I have been...fine,” she answered with a stricken look, shaking his hand. “And yourself?”
The rest of the night flew by as Harry and his friends hopped from bar to bar. They had helped him move into his new apartment in Manchester a few days beforehand; nevertheless, they’d spent the week before university went in session assisting Harry in getting used to the new city.
"I know," she said. Her voice developed into the "look at me I'm sympathetic and I understand" tone that she always appointed when trying to calm him down or explain something. "It must be awful for you to have to forgive everyone." She paused. "This is what we call 'abused kid' behavior. Feeling like it's
“I don’t like dogs,” Draco stated.

Twenty minutes later, he went back inside the house to wash dishes and vacuum (the beauty of magicked muggle appliances was that they could become silent). After that, he woke up Teddy for a bath. The toddler was not happy.
“Ron and Hermione.”
Andromeda smiled, “
“I’m sorry. It’s...okay. I should have clarified in the letter that it’s nothing bad. I just...need to tell you something.”
“All right, all right.”
“Harry!” Andromeda called, “You’ve got mail!”
“You named your cat…’Cauliflower’?” Harry asked in disbelief.
"Keep taking it. Keep up the regular sleep schedule. And cut back on the coffee, mister. It'll stain your teeth, anyways," She smiled at him.
Harry’s eyes darted down to what Malfoy was wearing. It was similar to what he wore the night at the bar: skinny jeans, a black t-shirt, a black jacket, and converses. He never thought he’d see Malfoy wearing muggle clothes. Malfoy suddenly glanced over, obviously aware of Harry’s staring. Harry looked down in shame. He felt a blush creeping on his face. He didn’t look up again until class ended. Malfoy stood up in a rush, collected his things, and nearly ran out the door. Harry continued sitting at his desk, still extremely confused.
spotless and threw tantrums whenever I got dirty. It got to the point to where my parents took me to a wizard psychiatrist when I was nine. He diagnosed me with OCD, but then my parents pulled me out of therapy because one, Malfoy's aren't mentally ill and, two, I was a kid.
“I know! Want a tour? I’d be happy to show you everything!”
The night of the twenty-first, Harry could hardly sleep. It was common knowledge that stress and nervousness could trigger insomnia. So he tossed an turned and meditated and took his sleeping meds and finally, at 2 AM, he fell asleep.
“It was too late, Potter! He had my parents! And my home! And all my options were gone! They were gone! They were gone!” Draco stopped when he realized that his face was wet. He was crying.
“It’s fine,” Harry lied.
“Three: I didn’t realize what

“What about you? Why aren’t you an auror or a Quidditch star?”
“Yup, yup. Uncle Harry is awake,” Harry groggily said. He rubbed his head and put his glasses on. “C’mon, little man.
“Because we’re friends and friends care about each other. We are friends, right?”
“Mum thinks that they’re getting married too soon.”
Harry took a deep breath,” As you both know, I’ve been seeing a therapist.”
“Um…,” the new bartender said, “I’m not sure. I’m new here.” He sounded nonplussed as he looked around for Draco.
“Hey, why don’t you come on back and we can go ahead and start?” she cheerfully asked, “How was your week?”
"Hello, headmistress," he replied, stepping into her office. "How have you been?"
Teddy reached out for Harry. Harry positioned his godson on his shoulders and walked them through his house. They’d visited before, but Harry had since then added some more furniture and décor, including a huge bookcase that took up an entire wall of his den. After they checked out the house, Harry took them on a tour of the immediate Manchester area. They visited some of his favorite shops and a nearby park.
, [I don’t know,]” He cleared his throat and switched to English. “On one hand, I’ve spent my entire life studying the wizarding world and our related history, but on the other hand, I feel like muggle history just
“Surprise me!” Potter replied. He slammed some money down on the counter. “Keep the tip!” He seemed to not know he was yelling.
(Not beta read)
Harry yawned and asked, “How long was Narcissa here?”
.          It had only been an hour or two when the yawning began. Teddy claimed, repeatedly and aggressively, that he wasn’t tired. He was firmly anti-napping; there was just too much to see and explore! Soon after they returned to Harry’s flat, Teddy fell asleep on the sofa.
, to Keynesianism? Hint: it was a process between the 1890s and the 1940s.”
Harry grabbed Andromeda’s arm, and all three of them apparated to his flat. When they arrived, Harry could see that his flat was much messier than he previously thought. The loosely-covered disapproval plastered Andromeda’s face. Harry didn’t see how she hadn’t gotten used to this yet; after all, she’d raised Tonks.

“Do they sell more charms here? I’d like to buy—actually. Never mind.” Draco dropped his voice. “I bet that I can find some wizarding charms in Diagon Alley.”
The professor had just turned the overhead projector on when a blond boy ran into class and took the seat right next to Harry.
“Teach!"

“Non! Aujourd'hui! [No! Today!]”
Harry sat outside for about twenty more minutes and then found his way inside. He found Draco admiring the brownie graveyard by the dessert table.
Draco cleared his throat and let out a small smile. He replied, “Actually, I was on Neptune. I wanted to see how long a human could last in a gaseous environment.”
Harry turned and walked away. He ignored the people calling his name, remarking upon his bravery. He took his assigned seat to the right of McGonagall. Hardly anyone had sat down at the speakers’ table yet. He stared down at his cup as it almost instantly filled with coffee. He took a sip.
“How has your sleeping been lately, any nightmares?”
Draco cut him off with a kiss. He joked, “Why are you so nosy?”
“I never had a choice, you know,” Draco said.
"I…I was being serious, y'know," Harry said.
“Why does she keep calling you? Can’t she just take the floo here?”
Harry did not, in fact, have any plans, so he hung out with Draco a little bit. They went to Diagon Alley—fully disguised under the invisibility cloak. For the most part, they people-watched. No one noticed them for a long time. Tat is to say, until one little boy spilled his entire cauldron of fizzing whizbees and Harry and Draco lost it. Their wild laughter concerned everyone in the street because no one could identify the source. By the time they apparatd away, they were wheezing.
Yet, this Monday was going to be different. He knew because that’s what he’d promised himself. Starting today, Harry was going to pay attention and participate in class. Really, he would.
They burned through the menus and the appetizers pretty quickly, and were left with time to talk before the entrées arrived.
“I want to help you,” Harry whispered.
Harry begrudgingly got out of bed. He wanted to fix turkey for dinner, so he decided that he might as well go ahead and begin. Following the steps that he so often took, he walked out of his room, fixed coffee, and walked outside to smoke.
“If you’d like. Do you think Jerry will be annoying about it?”
.          Malfoy nodded. “Oh.”
Draco apparated to the 3
[Yes, I would like to study more history, but I understand that the first year is for the core classes.]
"You're wearing your scarf," Draco responded.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. He replied, “Not to be redundant, but I don’t know.”
.          Malfoy reached his right hand up carefully, and he gently pried Teddy’s fingers off of his white-blond hair. Teddy let out a loud whine. Andromeda stepped back from Malfoy so that the toddler wouldn’t get any more ideas of the same sort.
"Do you think that it'll still work?" Draco asked.
What took Harry by surprise first was the size of the apartment. Unlike the vast area of the Malfoy Manor, this home was tiny. It could not have had more than three rooms: a living room/kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom/water closet. Next, Harry looked down to see two cats sniffing at his feet. They looked like opposites: one had thick, white fur and was missing an eye; the other had short, brown and orange fur, amber eyes, and only half a tail.

“Why are you cursing? What’s going on?” Sally asked.
“Oh, Harry! I’m so sorry about Teddy. I told him to leave you alone. I guess he got bored while I was checking the mail,” Andromeda said, frowning.
.          Andromeda frowned. She had been doing a lot of that recently. “Harry…” she almost whispered. “Look, I know that the Malfoys and Blacks aren’t exactly perfect people.” He looked at her in disbelief. Was she really defending them now? Her own family that disowned her? She continued, “Don’t, don’t! Just hear me out, okay? Narcissa and Lucius are, or were, both…” she sighed, uncertain about her words. “They’re both alcoholics. They have always used alcohol to cope with things, and I’m sure that that’s all Draco learned. You have to give him a break. I’m sure that if Regulus had been given a chance…things would have been…different…”

Finally, a boy with short, dark brown hair affirmed, “Nine.”
Draco was smiling. He spoke again, “I never questioned my father’s rhetoric at all until I was thirteen. It was at that time that I…I started to question my sexuality. Of course, being a number of
“Okay.”
At that time, a few people dropped their bags, half-walked--half-jogged towards Harry, and attempted to shake his hands. He tried to play along, for some people craved his touch as if he could heal the sick and save the dying. Several more simply gasped and stared at the scene— unable to comprehend Harry’s presence. He quickly gave out hugs and handshakes and even posed for a few photos. Soon thereafter, he departed the scene and paced to Honey Duke’s.
Draco jumped at the loud noise from the counter behind him. He spun around quickly. Potter was standing behind the counter, laughing. He slammed his hands on the counter again and announced, “Everyone! Oi, everyone! Watch what I’m about to do.” He then turned back to Draco and asked, “Mate, can I have three shots?”
"Normally, we would require several NEWTs in order to teach this subject, but I think that you have proved yourself quite worthy."
Harry sat down in a more comfortable position.
.          “Well, on top of the fact that he was an enormous bully and a
Before school on Tuesday, Harry went to his counselling centre. He sat in the waiting room, but his therapist came through almost immediately.
“Really? Mine too,” Draco said. Then. he awkwardly added, “Um…not green like your eyes, but…um… Slytherin green.”
Harry bought his coffee and he and Draco departed for class.
They travelled with Teddy to Clos Maggiore via cab. It was then that Harry got a good look at Draco. He had a tiny bit of hair gel applied to his blond hair—just enough to hold it out of his face. He was wearing black dress pants and a dark green dress shirt with a trench coat over top of it.

“Oh. Do you uh…” he cleared his throat, “do you speak Spanish?”
He sent Xavier home so that he and Fab could clean the fryer. It was a more dangerous and complicated job, and Draco wasn’t about to confuse the bloke. Besides, he’d already made him clean up Potter’s puke. He drained the fryer in silence, waiting for Fab to put on her heat-protectant gloves. She came back to where he was sitting and kneeled down next to him.
“You’re going to train him as bartender tonight. Okay, Draco?”
"I'm jus' kiddin'," Teddy responded.
“Holy fuck,” Malfoy said. “Fine, if you really want to know, I want nothing to do with my mother and father.”

"Did you get your Christmas present?"
The girls laughed even harder, and Sally asked through her humorous tears, “Draco, what the bloody hell are you?”
The session had adjourned about ten minutes beforehand, at 6:30 PM, but Harry had still stuck around. It was Draco's first time at Crowing Corner's Counselling Center and Harry wanted to make it nice. They stayed after with Luna for the purpose of socializing. It wasn't as if she was the only Hogwarts alumni at the PTSD meetings, but she

“Holy fuck. They make it sound like ‘only.’”
“How do you make time fly?”
Neville shot him a puzzled look. "One for Ginny and one for Hermione, right?"
First, he visited a store that was known to carry supplies specifically for teachers. It was one of his favorite places. He bought Flitwick a “World’s Greatest Teacher” coffee cup and some expensive tea bags. He bought McGonagall some high-class pens, a book on Latin and Greek roots for the English language, and a gold necklace with a witch hat. He bought Sprout several different breeds of muggle flowers. When he passed by an astronomy store, he knew that he had to buy something for Trelawney and Firenze.
The walk to the Black Cauldron wasn’t at all interesting until Draco heard yelling coming from near the parking lot. He sped up, attempting to get a good look at whatever was happening at the bar. He smirked at the sight of police placing Darren in handcuffs.
“Harry,
“It’s not… a lot.”
Within fifteen minutes, twenty students were sitting patiently. None of them took their eyes off Harry. Finally, Ms. Claire announced, “Okay, class. This is Mr. Potter. He’s going to help me out from now until lunch.”
.          “He speaks French,” Malfoy stated.
. Potter seemed to understand in that moment, as he stood up almost immediately.
"It was a…! Yeah, it was a study group…" the realization suddenly dawned on Harry.
Draco was about to go inside when Harry jokingly said, “What, no good-night kiss?”
Ron and Hermione grinned.
Sally and Fab sat beside Draco on the park bench. They tossed out bird seed to the pigeons and watched as the birds flocked towards the food. The three of them only started hanging out once Draco found out Sally and Fab were a couple. He understood why they’d been so secretive about it. It hurt him slightly that they didn’t consider him a “safe” person, but it also filled him with a sense of sick joy. He could still appear straight to other people. After all, everyone he’d told so far had been utterly shocked.
"So many people hate me, and the worst part is that I can understand why. So many people died in the war…and so many others have lived, but with scars. It was partially my fault and I know it."
The following morning, Andromeda bustled around. She was so happy that she hummed as she walked, and was cooking pancakes with magic. Harry couldn’t believe his eyes; he hadn’t seen Andromeda this happy since before Ted and Tonks died. Well, since the second war started.

Harry made eye contact with him, but his eyes fell down to Draco's lips.
“Yes.”

“Rock, paper, scissors?”
“He’s been sober for a really long time,” Harry interrupted.
Nevertheless, that’s where he was now: at ASDA, purchasing Cadbury’s, Maltesers, and Kinder Eggs. It was there that he thought the same thing that he so often thought, “It’s easier to be in the muggle world.” He sighed because he knew that Dumbledore would not be very proud of him. Right now, he was thinking like a coward— not a Gryffindor. He sighed again because he wasn’t sure if it mattered anymore.
Everyone in the bar was watching them now. That is, Potter’s group and a few other small, stray groups. Some people were laughing at him.
“As it is 1:30 PM, class is dismissed,” Professor Wilkins declared.

When he entered the “café,” Harry was automatically greeted with the smell of cigarettes and beer. He and Malfoy shared a semi-disgusted look.
He sat down in the middle of class, not wanting to draw attention to himself. He began to take out a notebook, pen, and laptop, but then he saw it: a white-blond head.

"Well, no."
to hate kids, but actually love them.”
One moment, he was back at Hogwarts and facing Voldemort. Then, he was in Andromeda's kitchen. Then, he was in the Dursleys' kitchen.
“And what’s that? In terms of addition, I mean.”
“Um, no.
“That would be fine,” Andromeda beamed.
Teddy was all dressed up in his little suit and tie. It was strange because the toddler didn't mind; in fact, he felt just the opposite: he loved dressing up and he loved the attention that it would entail. And much attention would he get. Harry spent an hour designing the seating at the tables. Finally, he set Andromeda, Narcissa, Molly, Arthur, Bill, Fleur, Charlie, and Hermione's parents at one table. At the other table, he set himself, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville, Draco, Dean, Seamus, George, and Angelina. He considered splitting the tables up evenly, but he didn't know who he'd leave out.
The blond carefully took off the wrapping paper and ribbon. In the box, there was a sterling silver and white gold watch whose hands had alexandrite on them.
“Um, free nachos? Fuck yeah!” Longbottom exclaimed. He clapped Potter on the back in a friendly motion. Potter grinned in response. Draco felt his stomach flitter. He wanted to punch something. He wanted to do a shot. Instead, he started making their drinks.
“Draco,
He arrived at the theater with ten minutes to spare. He worried about the tickets selling out, but found that Draco was already holding two tickets, a large popcorn, and two drinks in his hands.
“Harry,” Draco whined. “It’s going to be
His days were rather routine up until Thursday. After World History, Harry stuck around the school library in hopes of completing his research paper on sub-saharan african trade in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Why did he get such a difficult question when Malfoy was assigned the cultural and social factors of the Mongolian empire? Who knows. So, he stayed in the library until 8 PM. Finally, he left when he found only one book. He was lucky that most of the required sources could be from the Internet, at least.
"I forgive you," Harry replied.
After that, he went around all the shops that he could think of. He bought Dean and Seamus matching ugly Christmas jumpers. The two were dating now and they loved stuff like that. He got Ernie a red and gold tie and Cho some aquamarine earrings.
When Harry walked through the kitchen on his way to the bathroom, he saw a grin play on Andromeda's face.
“Merlin, are you
“I am a terrible flirt.”
When he got home just a few minutes shy of 5, Andromeda had begun cooking dinner,
I’d love to meet up for lunch. I would suggest a muggle restaurant, but I know that you know how to get around the wizarding world much better. How about the Three Broomsticks at 1:45?
“As for my friends,

, he reminded himself,
“I guess I just…got over it.”
“Hey, I’m amazing. Anyways, I’m starving. Let’s grab a cheeky Nando’s.”
“Not to be cliché, but what are we?”
Harry looked around and sure enough, small, white flakes were coming down.
“I thought she hated Hagrid,” Harry questioned, peering through the glass caressing around the earrings.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I just needed a few days off. You?”
“H-he!” Harry pointed to the young child’s forehead as he began to hyperventilate and cry.
“Did you understand any of that?”

that I couldn’t do it. I took the offer anyways. Mother didn’t want me to: she was so scared that I’d die and asked me if that’s what I wanted…”
He was currently at the Hogwarts Memorial Graveyard, along with almost every other person that had survived the war. Draco claimed that he had to work, but Harry knew that he was really just scared of seeing ghosts. And he was okay with that: one didn't need to be brave all the time.
“Well, of course! I refuse to use nasty, powdered mix.”
“I’m fine,” Ron responded. “I was talking with Hermione a lot last night. She called me pretty late after she got out of lab.”
Potter almost immediately hunched over and vomited on the floor. The Weasel laughed. Longbottom got over and rushed to Potter’s side.
“What the fuck is a twink?” Draco asked. Sally and Fab burst out in laughter. “No, seriously,” he continued, “Is this some kind of gay culture thing I never know about?” The girls kept laughing, and Draco could see a few tears form in Fab’s eyes. He scowled.
“Who is dead?”
He got up and locked the door. Draco stood in place for a few seconds before he felt the hot, salty tears run down his cheeks. He wiped them and rubbed his eyes. He pointlessly checked his back pockets for the letters he had written. After he got out of prison, he spent a long time writing apology notes for the Golden Trio and their friends. None of them felt right, but he used to keep them on him at all times. They felt stupid and silly. They felt superficial and vague and disingenuous. He gave up a few months ago; however, he still kept the pile of trashed notes in his apartment. He wiped a few more stray tears away from his face, unlocked the door, and stepped out of the bathroom.
“Yes…” Draco had turned to face Harry and was very seriously maintaining eye contact.
"Harry, I didn't want to wake you. I know that you haven't slept well lately, so I let you sleep pretty long. I went ahead and put the turkey in the oven and the ham in the Crock Pot. They should both be done by 8 this morning—don't worry, I've set my alarm and
Harry drew a breath. His life was finally going to start. No more ghosts and no more worries (his therapist would be proud, he thought). He exhaled, looked down, and began to walk.
“Xavier, this is Draco. He’s one of our head bartenders,” Fab informed the new hire.
[I understand. Do you like Christmas?]"
[I am always cute!]” He replied.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think—”
Narcissa smiled, and Harry found himself to be surprised that he could refer to the Weasleys as “Ron’s family” and Narcissa Malfoy would still understand.
.          She swallowed a bite of her Caesar salad, took a sip of her water, and patted her mouth with a napkin. She stated, “I wrote Draco yesterday. It wasn’t too long of a letter—only twenty-three inches.”
Of course, he wasn't only up for that. Like normal, he couldn't sleep.
“Ha-” Ron started.
Harry shrugged.
Harry shrugged. He just wanted this bloody headache to stop distracting him.
Malfoy’s eyes suddenly enlarged at the horror of what he said. He muttered, “Oh, Merlin. I can’t believe that I just told you all of that.”
One thing that still made Harry nervous, though he wouldn’t dare admit it to Draco, was telling their loved ones. He knew that Narcissa didn’t know, and he was constantly resolving to tell Hermione and Ron about it. If he couldn’t even handle telling his best friends, who could he tell?
Harry thought on his way back from auror training. He took the floo from the Auror Department to Gringott’s and exchanged some of his galleons for a few pound sterlings. After that, he apparated to Muggle Manchester. On his way to one of the Archie’s Burgers, he passed by the University of Manchester and its tall brick buildings. He stared at them, noting how they loomed over the city in a strange, omniscient way. He stopped staring.
How could he let Andromeda down? How could he forget something so important?
“Is that a bad thing?”
"Did you enjoy yourself, Draco?" Luna asked.
“Is that so, son? Because I get the drift that you couldn’t care what else happens to you. Look,” Dousselsnorf set down his papers on the desk and stood up. He continued, “You already spent a few weeks in Azkaban. You were held in the ministry’s high-security prison for about a month. You’ve been on probation for, what, almost two years now? You won’t have to see me again after June 15th if you stop being such an arsehole. I’ve been working with you. Why won’t you work with me?”
Dousselsnorf sighed and stood up from his chair. He grabbed the family portrait off of his book shelf. His entire family, including himself, was smiling and waving towards the camera. He set the picture down on his desk and faked a small smile.
The blond looked at Harry and said, “I like your jumper. It matches your eyes.”
One year and three months ago, Draco moved to his apartment complex. He had almost nothing except for enough money for two months’ rent, his wand, and the clothes and several pill bottles that fit into a small backpack he bought from ASDA. After signing the contract and receiving his key, he treaded up the stairs to the second floor. His apartment was 2B, and it looked and smelled like tweakers had lived there the past few months.
"Are you continuing your magical education, Luna?" Draco mused.

“’Arry! Look, look!
Harry replied, “What?”
“Er…” Harry did not know why, but he did not want to tell Malfoy’s mother about how unhealthy and, well, sad he looked. He answered, “We’ve spoken. We have to classes together and...er...have had lunch together.”
“What?”
Out of shame, he resolved to keep his eyes on the professor and his syllabus. Anything but Potter. He thought about his back pocket and how, yet again, he’d failed to bring any of his apologetic letters with him. He’d have to remember those from now on.
.          Andromeda looked down in disappointment. “No,” she admitted. “He’s probably just busy. Didn’t you say that that class you share is rather difficult?”
“Oh, yes. Once or twice. The first time was in second year—I believe—I accidentally turned up in the wrong chimney after using floo powder for the first time. It was a disaster!” Harry smiled in spite of his rambling, but couldn’t help himself from announcing, “Wait! I remember: you were in…somewhere…with your father. Borgin and Burkes, maybe?”
Draco poured three fireballs, careful not to spill anything since Potter was watching the entire time. He set the shots down in front of the dark-haired man. Potter looked around, gave the Weasel and Longbottom thumbs up, licked his lips in anticipation, and downed all three shots.
“Three,” they said together, “Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” Sally laughed as she looked at Draco’s continued fist.
Harry did both.
“Why?”
“Aww,” Harry faked a pout and began to rock his godson back and forth in his arms. This kid had to have a better life than Harry. He refused to let the same mistakes happen—neither domestic nor political.
“You?” Harry asked.
“Sure.”
, he thought.
[Cute, my love. You are very cute.]” Andromeda informed him, grinning. She ruffled his hair and went back to looking at Harry. “You look like a strapping young man,” she said.

“Oh, well then.”
“Really?” Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Oh, well, that’s alright. We’ll just order some more simple stuff until you get help. What beer do you have?” Longbottom replied.
It was Friday, and of course Draco was closing again. He didn’t quite mind that much since Sally and Fab were closing with him: 11PM-5AM. It was one of those nights where no manager would be on the premises, so the bartenders on duty would usually conduct the more difficult closing duties. Draco had lasted until slightly past midnight without drinking that night, but he so desperately needed a shot when one customer yelled for a solid ten minutes at all the staff because his cheese fries hadn’t been prepared in under five minutes.
Harry raked the gold and brown leaves all to one pile. October had begun to set in, but it was rather chilly for the twenty-ninth. He was wearing the sweater that Mrs. Weasley had gotten him for the last Christmas, yet he still had goosebumps. Or were those a result from his anticipation for the arising party? Only Merlin knew…
"Oh."
“Don’t feel too bad,” Malfoy said. “You didn’t hurt my feelings that much.”
couldn’t manage to talk to him about their friendship or relationship or whatever it was that they had.
, he thought.
“Oh!”
“Draco?” Fab questioned.
"I'm doing great, too, mate. Thanks for asking. Right now I'm working for the local owl post, but I've talked to George about helping out with the shop," Seamus added.
.          “That’s fantastic!” Andromeda exclaimed. She grinned widely. “Are you busy? Harry was just showing me the school. You might like to join us.”
“Expelliarmus!” he heard. He moved out of the way and ran through the next door. The room didn’t change at all except there was only a small table and two chairs instead of the other furniture that the last room had. Harry stepped through it slowly. He felt a weird tingling in his legs, similar to what he felt the other night at the University.
. He chose this seat so that he wouldn’t attract any attention. Now his bloody table partner had chosen to do something stupid and merit others’ judgement. Draco sneered at him. Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco felt himself growing red like he did the other night—the night when Potter
By the time half the presents were opened, almost everyone had received what Harry had gotten them. The only gifts that Harry had left to hand out were the ones for Narcissa and Draco.
“Th-the scar!”
“You look nice tonight.” Harry mentally reprimanded himself for such a shitty icebreaker. He wasn’t trying to flirt with Draco—he was trying to talk to him.
His first day of classes were interesting, to say the least. He had somehow managed to not get lost. Introduction to Islam was almost definitely going to be Harry’s favorite course—he was sure of it! He took notes on the class directory and the syllabus, and he even managed to ask the professor a few questions during class. The textbook didn’t even appear to be that bulky and boring. On the other hand, he wasn’t so sure that he’d enjoy Introduction to the Study of Religions and Theology. According to the directory, the majority of their class wouldn’t actually be about religion but rather how to approach
“Perfect. For the inside, we can levitate rubber bats and put up some cute, cardboard cutouts of monsters. We can do vampires and mummies, but I think that werewolves would be rather inappropriate. Oh, and shouldn’t we all wear costumes?”
.          “I do hope he replies to me,” Andromeda admitted.
Harry was on his third cup of coffee by 9AM. He'd been awake for only an hour after somehow getting eight hours of sleep. Sure, he'd lain in bed for a few hours before he'd
The minutes slowly ticked away until they were chanting “10, 9, 8,…” When the "1" sounded, they witnessed the ball land and all of the couples on TV kiss. Harry and Draco shared a somewhat innocent smile.
“Likewise,” Draco sneered. He set the book down on the shelf and wiped his hand on his pants, as if he touched something filthy. Dousselsnorf rolled his eyes, seeing through Draco’s façade.
"Wait,
“Attention, class. I will now begin to read off of our syllabus. Our semester will cover World History 111, which means that our studies are roughly the beginning of mankind to the Industrial Revolution…”
[Do you want to wake him up?]”
“Yes, sir,” Draco replied.
Their conversation continued for another twenty minutes until Andromeda announced that it was time to open presents. They all gathered in the living room. Harry noticed that Draco was dressed in a light blue shirt that complimented his eyes.
Harry's was a thick scarf, but it was unlike his Gryffindor scarf. While his Gryffindor scarf was striped and partly scratchy, this scarf had green and red swirls and was made up of soft, rich fabric.
"Harry, I am so sorry. I didn't think that our conv—" Ginny started to ramble.
“So, I spoke with your mother…” Harry said.
“Um…I just thought that maybe Draco would like to join us,” Harry said.
Harry.”
“What do you mean?” Draco replied.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco said, "I tried to bust you for a
Harry took a bite of his burger. “Maybe,” He swallowed and replied, “but I doubt I’ll have much time. We do have auror exams in June, and I hear that next year is going to be very difficult. I’ll consider it.”
"I agree. Our Hogwarts years are over and I'm tired." Suddenly, Harry announced, "Fuck."
“You know exactly what I mean.” He couldn’t help but smile. Of course, he never hung out with them again. It was just too hard to hide his wizarding history from them, especially since Felicia was a self-proclaimed pagan witch. He’d watch as she pretended to brew potions and study astrology until it was too much, and he’d leave the room guffawing. Fab would always grow angry and call him mean and a “bully.” He already knew that.
“It’s not that easy. I tortured people. I tormented people. Imprisoned them. Starved them. I—it’s—“
After the first few months of interviews and speeches and photo-ops, Harry kept his head down low. He took care of Teddy, cooked, and learned some basic French from Andromeda. It wasn’t much, but it kept him sane until training began.
“Headmistress,” Andromeda corrected him
Draco rolled his eyes. “You don’t understand.”
“That’s not an answer.”
“Um, free nachos? Fuck yeah!” Neville exclaimed. He clapped Harry on the back. Harry grinned in response.
Draco made his way back to the door. Before he touched the door knob, he turned around and said, “I’ll consider it.”
Harry admitted, “Well...he doesn’t look too healthy.” He stopped short of confiding that he had comforted Malfoy out of a panic attack.
“It’s fine, P-Harry. I recognize that my actions have not made me the most trustworthy person-” Narcissa began, but was cut off by Harry.
Five minutes later, Narcissa arrived. She was dressed in an elegant, green silk dress and was immediately welcomed in by her sister. At 4:15, Harry was starting to doubt that Draco would show up. Andromeda saw the concern on his face and offered him a reassuring smile.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh. This would be a long day.
‘This is the first relationship that I’ve ever been in,” Draco said. “I’m not exactly sure how this is supposed to work.”
“Dumbledore-“
They left the tavern laughing and, surprisingly, Harry’s week began to fly by.
“Yes, I hope they like chocolate.”
Rest was exactly what he did. He learned conversational French from Andromeda, spoiled Teddy, read muggle books, played Quidditch, and attended (wizard) therapy on a weekly basis. Attending a muggle uni was only the cherry-on-top for tabloids such as the Daily Prophet and Witch Weekly. Harry did not care: it was time for him to be selfish.
“So…” Harry began. “What’s up?”
“Fourth year, maybe fifth. You?”
Friday night, as soon as he got home, he got out his pen and paper (most of the wizarding world had abandoned quill and parchment after the war):
Draco shrugged.
They hugged again and everyone finished their gift-giving.
“Oui? [Yes?]”
When class had finally ended, Harry was anticipating the next semester. Malfoy had looked at him a total of two times in the entire ninety minutes. Which, of course, Harry wasn’t particularly wanting Malfoy to look at him, but how could he just ignore Harry’s existence?
Of course, he had slammed into someone and sent both of their belongings tumbling to the ground. They simultaneously bent down to pick everything up when they bumped heads.
to sell alcohol to someone this inebriated?
“Harry! Harry! Harry, Harry, c’mon. Harry!” She got louder with every word.
“Just, please, tell me why,” Harry said. He took Draco’s hands to plead, but then dropped them as soon as he realized what he was doing.
Harry grinned and Ginny asked, “What?”
The kids counted on their fingers, eager for Harry’s approval.
It was all very stressful. So, yes: Harry was anticipating a new term at the University of Manchester. He had decided to go to university because it was what he wanted—which was strange for Harry. Hermione was excited due to the fact that she was attending Oxford for chemistry. “We need more girls in the STEM fields,” she had said. Ron was working to be an auror. Neville decided to study Herbology so that he could help Madam Sprout teach—a shock to everyone. For a while, Harry’d felt that everyone had their futures and careers planned out—everyone except for him. Andromeda warned him that he arguably had had the most stressful circumstances and so he needed rest time.
“Why did you take economics then?”
“I started doing cocaine before sixth year. I bought it from some of our classmates.”
“Sorry!” Draco practically yelled. “I shouldn’t have said that. I had no busi-“
“Okay. That’s fine. Would it be rude if I continued to cook while you do so? I know that you deserve eye contact, but I don’t want to burn the caramel.”
“Like it? I love it! It’s….” Harry stopped midsentence. He looked at it again, noting the mixture of the deep blues, light blues, whites, greys, and the black. It was elegant and subtle. It was exactly what he wanted. “It’s perfect, Luna.”
"Do you like muggle uni, Harry?" Luna asked.
Malfoy ended up sitting next to Harry in World History, but they didn’t talk at all. Harry pretended to be listening to the lecture, but he was really just paying attention to Malfoy. He was doing a lot of that recently.
"Yes.
“You can imagine how frustrating it is when Ron’s family is over,” Harry added.
“With expressing myself and all,” Harry clarified.
He replied, “Nothing. Just can’t believe that you said ‘legit.’”
"This!" Harry started to tickle Teddy and the toddler was guffawing. A few minutes later, Harry stopped and kissed Teddy on the head.
The snow was pouring down at a quicker rate now, and thus the air was growing colder.
He groaned loudly.
[Very well, and you?]”
Harry looked at Draco again. He was caught by his eyes. The snowflakes on his eyelashes and the pink on his face caused the blue in his eyes to pop. The grey speckles only complimented that.
“S’okay.”
in her arms. He shook his head and pouted. Draco wanted to roll his eyes. Why couldn’t children behave? After all,
The party was scheduled for 3 PM in order to ensure gift-opening and socializing. With only five hours left, Andromeda and Harry were in a rush.
likes you. You’re very amiable.”
?" Harry scoffed. "You're such a git."
“Yeah,” Draco giggled. “Better than
“Wait, what? No! I don’t, I don’t do that.”
"I don't understand. Everybody wants me to be a good person and forgive them!" Harry's voice rose. He was angry, and he knew his face was turning red, but he was
“Harry! Are you okay?” She burst out of the kitchen and into the living room.
“Oh…and they’re…accepting?”
"What?" Draco asked. His right eyebrow was raised in a skeptical fashion.
“1980,” Harry replied.
.          Harry took Andromeda and Teddy out for dinner after they finished the informal tour. Harry turned in early so that he could get some studying in before his classes the next day, but he ended up not being able to concentrate and simply tossed his textbook across the room.
.          “Oh! Okay. Well, I will…I will certainly be sure to write you. Oh! By the way, this is Teddy,” Andromeda announced, grabbing the pink-haired toddler from Harry’s arms. “He is my grandson, and Harry’s godson. He is Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin’s child.” Harry saw Malfoy’s face turn white. “That means he’s your second cousin.”
“Hey…” the blond sleepily replied. “Just…wanted to be alone.”
"I'm pretty excited," Harry replied.
At some point, however, Narcissa stated, “I only just wish that I knew where Draco is. I worry about him so much and he’s just disa-”
“What?” Harry asked innocently.
"That's ridiculous!"
He poured himself a shot of firewhisky to chase some Adderall. It went down easily and without protest. His throat hardly ever burned anymore from doing this. He got himself a glass of water and an apple. Sitting on the couch to read his newspaper, he quickly finished his makeshift newspaper. It took him roughly ten minutes to skim the paper. He stood up to take a shower, dusting the apple remnants off of his pants, couch, and table. Once he was inside the bathroom, Draco undressed slowly. His entire body began to hurt as if he had fallen and rolled around on glass. He wiggled his fingers on his left hand and checked his wrist. The scratches, cuts, and burns on it were puffy and red—they were more than likely infected. He ignored the rest of his body and stepped into the shower, turning the water on.
“Er…” mumbled Harry. “He, um…” Harry didn’t have it in him to tell her that her son sported dead hair, a grey and nervous complexion, and a skinny stature. “Well, he…” Harry wanted to comment that Malfoy had worked hard to become sober, but he couldn’t bring himself to admit to Narcissa that the blond was an alcoholic. “I don’t know.” It wasn’t a lie.
“That’s beautiful,” Harry replied sincerely.
He nodded, and Fab went back into the kitchen. Draco spent the next few hours explaining the register, rush times, and basic bartender duties to Xavier.
“Hey,” he greeted Draco.
They stood around awkwardly.
Malfoy cut himself off mid-inhale, blinked, and sneered, “What do you want, Potter?”
“I know. Addressing all of these respectively, Draco, we’re different people now than we were during Hogwarts. Yeah, we basically hated each other, but that doesn’t mean we do now. It also doesn’t mean that our relationship now will be unhealthy.
.          Malfoy turned his head to make their eyes meet. He was so close that Harry could make out every little vessel in his eye. Malfoy spoke, "Are you daft? I
“‘Awwy! Yay, yay, yay, yay! I to’d you, maman.
“Hey, if you’re—” Potter began.
“How did you get out of that one?” Draco questioned.
It was an hour before party time. Harry did some last minute touches on the napkins and presents. He couldn't help but feel restless and he was sure that it had something to do with the thought of having everyone over.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and said with great disdain, “What in the bloody hell gave you the idea that you should tell my mother that I’m ‘not okay’?”
“How am I supposed to know? Religion is different in the wizarding world. ‘Sides, you’re not even Muslim. Your family was just Muslim.”
Ms. Claire commented that it was time for reading and she passed out the books.
“Oh, um. Okay,” Draco said. “Is it urgent?”
“He’s a very smart young man: English and French,” chimed in Narcissa.
“Yes?” he asked.
“Hey, at least we don’t have any fizzing whizbees to spill,” Draco declared.
“Bu-“
“I realize that our choices during Hogwarts may not fully impact how we interact with one another now, but I said some disgusting things.”
.          Draco became a bit more confused. The Blacks taught their children French because they wanted to preserve their heritage…their
Draco and Harry had made up since their spat during the November fifth dinner, and Harry had somehow convinced Draco to go Christmas shopping with him.
