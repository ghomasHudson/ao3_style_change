Draco scoffed and tried to look away, but Merlin grabbed his chin, forcing him to meet his gaze. “I will not allow you to reject this truth, Draco. You made mistakes, yes, but you were merely a child. You
A couple of hours later, Harry made his way to the seventh floor. After making up with Ron and Hermione, he was in good spirits, but still nervous about his talk with Draco. When he opened the door to the room of requirement, he stopped and stared.
Kreacher shook his head,  “No, Young Master, Kreacher will not. House-elf magic will be protecting Kreacher.”
Harry paused as if not trusting him to keep his questions to himself, and then continued. Draco listened with rapt attention as he was told all about the press and the students, the harassment, and how Sirius Black had told him about this room as a lifeline to escape it all from time to time.
After five minutes, he had finished the water Draco had sent and couldn't bear to sit still any longer. When he crossed the bridge, the lights appeared on the other side as Draco had promised, leading him along the riverside.
“The soul bond is being so powerful that the familiar absorbs a portion of the magic. It is being different from when a wizard uses a familiar to store magic. When the bond is being sealed, so is the magic in the familiar. It is belonging to them, as your magic is belonging to you.”
Draco looked to the left and noticed that the land began to incline after a short distance. His eyes followed the incline, and he was surprised to realize that someone had magically formed a gentle hill leading to the largest part of the waterfall.
“WHY IN THE NAME OF MERLIN IS THIS SO BLOODY COMPLICATED?!” Harry roared as he tramped through the forest on the way back to his cabin. He’d been walking out his frustrations for the millionth time in the last week, trying to figure out why he couldn’t find the manifestation of his link. He’d poured through the book and tried every example of a link he could think of, but nothing worked.
Harry looked at him for several moments as though trying to make up his mind about something. Finally, he spoke, “I’m not taking Remedial Potions. He’s been teaching me occlumency.”
Draco could have kissed his mother, he was so grateful. Although there was a spark of recognition in her eyes, the only reaction she gave was to reach out and grasp Harry’s hand, shaking it firmly. “Wonderful to meet you. I apologize for any negative impression you might have been given of my Draco. I assure you that the actions of others in the Malfoy family do not reflect on him.”
Now that Umbridge was taken care of, Harry’s nerves from earlier returned. There was nothing left to do now other than ask Draco to stay with him.
Draco spent the majority of the next few days alternating between hiding out in his room and working at Grimmauld Place. He didn’t see anything of his father, which he was grateful for, but his mother was a different story.
“No, Kreacher, you’ll have to go back to Grimmauld Manor.” Draco was touched and concerned at the downcast look in the elf’s large eyes. “It’s not safe for either of us if you are here. Besides, someone needs to take care of the Manor don’t they?”
Sometime later Kreacher quieted, looking up at Draco with fear evident in his large eyes, “B-but...if Sirius is to be r-released, Kreacher will have to serve him. Kreacher is a bad elf for saying so, but Kreacher does not want to be serving Master Sirius. Kreacher does not like Master Sirius, but Master Sirius also hates Kreacher, and his house. Even if Kreacher was wanting to help Master Sirius, Kreacher doesn’t think Master Sirius would accept.”
While surrounding cells were filled with the laughter and screams of the insane and destitute, the only sound to be heard here was a rough click-clack against the stone floor.  The large brown dog inside huffed impatiently as he paced back and forth, trying to control his irritation. The mystery writer had promised a delivery within a week, and today was the seventh day.
In the end, it was the thought of Harry and everything he’d gone through that cemented Draco’s decision. “I’ll do it.”
Without another word, Merlin waved his hand, and Draco once again found himself spinning and falling, as though he was being pulled into a whirlpool of magic.
Umbridge seemed to forget that Draco was there. As she slowly walked around the room, he could hear her muttering to herself, “Such promise… must tell the Minister… Dumbledore… Potter.”
Almost immediately, one pair captured Harry's attention. It was a silver simple wireframe pair with oval lenses shining as they caught the sunlight from the window. He picked them up and put them on, surprised when they magically adjusted to fit his face perfectly; that was handy, he thought to himself.
“You love me!” Draco exulted. His face lit up with a beautiful smile and he leapt into Harry’s arms.
Harry read the last note over and over again, tears running freely down his face. While Draco showed him that he loved him every day, he'd never been this open with his feelings before. Wiping the tears from his eyes, he began to run, desperate to reunite with his lover. He was going to spend the rest of his life making sure that Draco knew how worthy he was.
Draco nodded in understanding, turning his eyes back to Lyra, who was still staring intently as she hummed. His pain was almost completely gone by now, but he didn’t want to move until she stopped.
Somewhere in his mind, Severus hated that Draco was looking at him with such loathing. There was also the slightest whisper that Draco Malfoy would not be defending Harry Potter if it weren’t true. However, he had been drinking. He was also bitter, angry, and humiliated after the incident. “Did Potter also tell you that he violated my privacy by sticking his oversized head in my Pensieve?” he said, smug and certain that this would cause Draco to see sense and turn against the Potter boy.
“The only limitation that I am aware of is that it cannot conjure food,” Draco said, repeating the words Harry had told him, “due to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, of course. Other than that, there seems to be no limit on what the room can provide.”
Draco had no such hesitation, “Honestly, Miss Ames. Please, control yourself. You were busy. Harry has been tended to and will be getting his glasses, so there is no harm done and no need for you to quit your job.”
They were growing closer every day. They still argued and challenged each other, but there was no malice behind it. They learned they had a surprising amount in common and could spend hours debating their interests. Draco began tutoring Harry in Potions, while Harry trained him in Defense. Within a couple of weeks, they had begun meeting every night.
There on the rug was Draco Malfoy, in cat form, batting around a rather large and ugly-looking toad.
The idea was so tempting. "But won’t father be angry with you? He gave a very strict budget.” Draco asked, concerned for his mother.
The silence that followed was deafening, and he could see nothing other than contemplation on the other boy's face. Draco thought he would crack from the pressure until finally, "Why do you want to do this Malfoy? We hate each other. We always have. What's in it for you? I should think you would be glad to see me injured. Why now?"
Draco ignored him, completely focused on his task. Harry grumbled slightly, but remained still, knowing it wasn't worth the pain to fight the Slytherin.
“I’m fine, Harry. What did you see in the Pensieve? Will you tell me?” He was furious about the way his godfather had behaved, but Harry’s focus had been on the memories, and Draco wanted to know why.
“There,” she said, “that’s settled. You go out and have fun, darling. I’ll expect you at the tea shop in Vairtyc Alley by no later than 5. Afterward, we can get some dinner and you can tell me all about your day.”
Unable to bear the silence any longer,  Harry cleared his throat. “Look, you guys, I don’t know what Dumbledore has been up to, but he’s having everyone in my life keep secrets from me, and I don’t like it. On top of that, while he’s always had this thing about being vague and leaving me to figure things out on my own, now he’s ignoring me completely.” Harry paused, “I’m not going to follow him any more. From now on, I’m going to do what I think is right and leave it at that.”
Kreacher nodded and disappeared, surprising Draco again when he was back in less than three minutes. “Kreacher has returned the pouch with the fake stone to the giant man’s pocket. The real stone is being hidden at home as Young Master requested,"
What had started as a beautiful winter's day in Hogsmeade was now a complete and utter nightmare. The snow-covered paths were now littered with debris and dropped packages. The frigid air was thick with smoke, curses being flung in every direction. Explosions rang out like thunder.
I thought the scenic route would be nice for a while, but you don't want to just take a stroll, do you? I know you want to let go. You want to run. So, do it.
As the light of the thread grew to a blinding degree, he felt the acceptance pulse through him with a flood of warmth, chasing away all of the emptiness he had been struggling against for so long.
Now that the elf was calm, Draco moved out of his kneeling position, his knees screaming in protest from being on the floor too long. He winced and sighed in relief as he sat and thought things over for a moment. Draco remembered all too well how Sirius had detested Kreacher and treated him nearly as bad as his father treated Dobby. He was determined that things would be different this time around.
Draco paused to think. The most important thing he could do for Kreacher was to give him purpose again. It was something Granger had never been able to understand. She had been correct about the treatment of house-elves; Dobby had proven that.
Those who had been forced into servitude were left baffled as their marks disappeared without a trace.
Draco paused, calming himself. In the two years that they had spent growing from rivals to lovers, and the months since their relationship had become something more, Harry had never given him pause to doubt him. Arguments, pranks, and rivalry were still present in their relationship; it made their time together interesting and entertaining. Draco wouldn’t have had it any other way, and he trusted Harry with every fiber of his being.
Suddenly remembering the time, Draco asked,  “Would you please take me back to my room at Malfoy Manor, and then hear me out? If you don’t want to after I’ve explained, you won’t have to. Alright?” With a large sniff, Kreacher nodded. Draco moved forward, placing his hand gently on Kreacher’s head, and they apparated out.
However, something about her horrible taste in decorating allowed Draco to slip back into his “Malfoy” mask as though it were a worn glove. He stood straight and tall, his nose held almost imperceptibly in the air so that he was looking down on everyone and everything around him, and his mouth was curved into the haughty sneer that had become his trademark.
When they got to the front of the building, Harry noted with relief that it was just a painting. He supposed someone had used magic to make it move. Harry thought it was brilliant, although it was slightly disturbing to see a large bird of prey on top of a building like that. This magic stuff was going to take some getting used to.
Harry thought it over for a few moments, “It’s a good plan, Draco. But, as relieved is as everyone is, won’t people start asking questions about her absence?”
Draco hadn't realized it but, from the moment the howler had opened, he had forgotten about the world around him. The words had pierced him through the chest and he was in a state of shock. When the letter suddenly caught fire, he jerked as though slapped, once again in the present. He was in the Great Hall, and the entire school now knew that he had defied his father, who had disowned him and threatened to kill him…or at least would have if the letter hadn’t caught fire.
Almost as though he was being controlled by an outside force, Draco forcefully made his way through the Manor, wondering what his father had in store for him. Being summoned to his study never ended well for him.
Terror gripped Draco’s heart like a vice as he scrambled to his feet and began to back away. Though he’d known he would eventually be punished… desired the chance to offer retribution for his crimes… he couldn’t stop this small attempt to escape, now that he was faced with it.
Was this their manifestation? It was the only plausible explanation he could think of. Only one way to find out… he dipped his quill in the ink and wrote one single word.
Sending love to anyone who takes the time to read this story. It is quickly becoming my baby :) Massive thanks and props to everyone who helped me get this chapter out: All of my lovely Larks and my awesome beta ReaperCrow! We are setting the stage with this Chapter. Next, we enter the Great Hall, and the real fun begins.
“Of course, Madam,” Draco purred, lowering his head in a bow of respect, “It would be foolish to allow personal matters to interfere with my service to the school.” Looking at him, no one would have guessed that his thoughts were the exact opposite.
The dog started when suddenly a large trunk appeared, falling to the ground with a loud thud. Seconds later, a note appeared on top of it.
“Shhh,” whispered Harry. “We’re almost there. I don’t want you to see it until the right moment. Don’t worry, I won’t let you fall. Trust me,” Harry pleaded quietly.
Dobby was silent for several moments, seemingly dithering between protecting Draco and following orders, “Dobby is not liking the young master going in alone. But Kreacher is needing help. Dobby will go. But young master must promise Dobby he will call if he is being in trouble. And young master must be staying in the main room on the first floor. There is being nasty things in that house, and the young master is not having his wand.”
“Please excuse my administrator. I’m afraid Miss Ames gets rather caught up in her work and we’ve been rather busy these last few days. How can I…” he paused, examining Harry closer. Harry braced himself, preparing for more unearned gratitude. Harry was relieved when Healer Edwards commented, “What on earth have you been doing to these glasses? They are barely holding together.”
Disclaimer: See Chapter 1! The conception of Merlin and his role in this story is my creation, but otherwise, I own nothing!
“Thanks to kissing her robes these last several weeks, I happen to know that Umbridge sends reports to the minister on Mondays. She sent one out this morning, and won’t be expected to report again until next Monday. If we haven’t settled things by then, we’ll come up with something. What do you think?”
Draco sneered defiantly as he felt the power of the soul-bond coursing through him. Tom Riddle was in for a world of hurt.
He was assaulted and overwhelmed by the memories of his life and death. Failure, regret, and grief swept over him like a tidal wave. For an endless eternity, he was drowned, suffocated, and released repeatedly; never allowed to breathe… never allowed to collapse…
Whirling to face him, “Potter!” he shouted, “How did you know? How did you know that I would see the plant? That I would be able to follow you here? We’ve never…I never said…” Draco trailed off, unable to say anything further.
Draco’s face immediately brightened, “That’s brilliant, Harry! There are so many places you should see! We’ll get your glasses and clothes and then I’ll show you around for real!”
Just then, he heard the tell-tale pop and Dobby’s voice, more high-pitched than ever in his distress, “Dobby is being so sorry for keeping young master waiting! Dobby is a bad elf!” Draco could hear what sounded like Dobby hitting himself and whispered fiercely, “Dobby! I ordered you to cease punishing yourself! It’s alright. I expected some difficulty. Now tell me what happened.”
Draco returned to the bed, flopping down with a sigh. Lyra returned to her previous position on his shoulder and nuzzled his neck softly, before moving up to lick the tears from his face. He was overwhelmed with the gift of having a companion like her, and affection and warmth for his new familiar pushed the remaining grief away. When she finished licking his face, she looked into his eyes and huffed lightly. Draco almost felt as though she was scolding him for his negativity. He laughed and petted her softly before picking her up and depositing her on the pillow next to him.
In reality, Harry wasn’t offended at all. Even Hagrid, as nice as he had been, hadn’t mentioned Harry’s clothes or glasses. At once, an idea struck him. “Don’t move. I’ll be right back.”
He looked up, waiting for the protests and anger he was sure he’d receive, particularly from Hermione, but there was none. Instead, they were looking at him with determination. Ron spoke first, “Of course, mate…” he took a deep breath, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, “I know that stuff last year set us wrong, and I know that I was a complete arse about Malfoy. I’m sorry about that. I really am. But this is your life, and the way Dumbledore has been acting is completely mental!” Hermione nodded at this, “Whatever you need to do, mate. I’ll support you. Even… Malfoy. I don’t like the git, but it’s none of my business if you want to help him or be friends with him.”
Draco’s eyes widened. Harry was right. He had been so furious; he had just thrashed around and attempted to get out. Normally, he would have calmly analyzed the situation and kept a cool head. It had been drilled into him from birth that giving in to such emotions was unbecoming of a Malfoy.
After making Harry laugh uncontrollably for several minutes the dog jumped off his lap and on to the floor, transforming into his human form.
On the far end, he saw the source of the rushing sound: a brilliant waterfall. The water flowed over rocks, cascading into several small waterfalls at around 6 meters off the ground. The water continued this way for around 4 meters or so, emptying into one large waterfall, which fell into a large pool.
Of course, he'd known it to be true from the moment his father approached him with that look in his eyes.
This might not be something I need to say, but I'm going to say it anyway, if only because I'm insanely anxious about how those parts of the chapter will be received. When I read Harry Potter, I often think about the confusion, grief, and even self-loathing that can come from living in a home where you aren't wanted. I, and other fans too I think, often felt like this part of the story was overshadowed by the rest of it. We saw some of the ways Harry was affected by his time with the Dursleys, but I can't believe that's all there was to it, if only because it's all he knew from the time he was a baby. I just want y'all to know that I did my best to give voice to those emotions, and give more depth to the situation that he was in. I hope I did it justice.
Draco hugged her tighter and thought for a moment; he couldn’t tell her the truth, but he could tell her a version of it. “I..had a nightmare...someone was after me. You...sacrificed yourself to save me. Your last words were ‘I love you, my darling’. I know it wasn’t real but...when you said that just now...”
He tried to take his time and enjoy the scenery, but he couldn't focus on any of it. As much fun as this was, his heart was racing at the thought of what might await him when he finally found Draco.
He sighed in frustration as he crashed into the chair in front of his desk. He really didn’t want to leave yet… but he was running out of options.  Before he went that far with it, however, he decided to write Hermione. He didn’t want to bother her while she was looking for her parents, but there was a chance she knew something he didn’t.
A hand grasped his shoulder and Draco flinched, unable to help the immediate reaction to another person touching him. He relaxed after a moment, realizing that Merlin would not fault him for his weakness.
“Ahem. Wonderful to see you, Mr. Malfoy. I must admit I was a tad concerned after the events of this morning. I’m pleased to see your priorities are still in line despite your
Harry was beginning to lose hope. Maybe their bond required them to meet in person? He’d heard of bonds where they could only find their soulmate by touch or sight.
Draco thought it through for a moment then sighed, “In for a knut in for a galleon, I’m not giving up now. But you better make good on your promise Potter. Lets get on with it, I haven’t got all day.”
His father approached like a tiger ready to devour its prey, his eyes burning with a look of hatred that Draco remembered all too well.
“Well,” Hagrid said carefully, thinking out loud, “Yer safe enough here… and I suppose we did get all yer school supplies, and yeh could use some clothes and such. I’m rather worn out, but you should be able to have some fun, this bein yer first visit and all…” Hagrid stopped to think it over for a moment, “Meet me at five o’clock. At the Leaky Cauldron. Alright?”
“Come on in deary,” Madam Malkin said kindly, “you can step right up here and I’ll get with you as soon as I finish this young man’s measurements.”
From where he stood, Harry could see a den, kitchen, and even a bedroom. It was almost an entire house... inside a trunk!
It was at this moment that Kreacher finally released Dobby, who flopped forward, barely catching himself before shooting the older elf a reproachful look. He turned to Draco, his eyes wide and tearful, and began speaking at a frantic pace, “ Master was ordering Draco to see you, but not to be healing you unless you would not be living. Dobby went to be getting Kreacher because Kreacher serves Young Master and could be healing him. When Dobby and Kreacher returned, the baby cat and Young Master was being covered in bright light. The light grew until Dobby could not be seeing before it was vanished. Dobby was being so frightened, Young Master. Dobby thought it was an evil baby cat-”
As they lay together in the field that night, staring up at the brightest starry sky they had ever seen, Harry decided that lilac was now his favourite colour.
In the middle of the trunk, where a lock normally would have been, there was nothing but a simple square panel. Thinking it over for a moment, he touched his hand to the panel and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
The man before him was no older than 30; his eyes were a piercing blue and his hair the darkest of black. Power reverberated throughout the oasis, and yet he was not afraid; somehow, he knew this man meant no harm.
“Come on Dray, it’ll be fun…..what a load of bollocks. Gallivanting through trees, weeds, rocks, and mud. Why in the name of Merlin did I let him talk me into this?” he grumbled. He was sure his hair was in a right state by this point. His clothes were rubbish as well.
Healer Edwards returned the smile for a moment before a serious frown crossed his face. He bent down to Harry’s level, looked him in the eyes, and spoke gently, “I think your home situation is less than ideal.”
“Oh that,” Harry said, caught off guard by the subject change, “Well, you were the one who suggested the clothes and glasses. I figured you might have other ideas, and I want to explore this place.”
Bursting into joyous laughter, ran through the pine trails as fast as he could, only stopping when he couldn't continue any further. Dropping to his knees, he desperately tried to force air into his lungs. Sweat dripped from his face and his muscles were on fire, but he felt so alive and free that he couldn't bring himself to care.
Draco paused, debating what to do. He couldn’t let Hagrid discover the stone was missing. If that happened, Voldemort would inevitably find out; there were too many risks to even consider. In his previous life, Draco could have transfigured a look-alike, but there was no hope of that now. Even with his wand, his magic wouldn’t be capable of such a complex spell at this stage.
He was shocked when his mother pulled him into a tight hug, releasing him after a moment and placing her hand gently on his head. Something had changed between them since his return; she had never shown him affection like this in public.
This was a problem; he really didn’t want to be covered in writing, even if it was from his soulmate. Trying to think of another option, Harry brushed the word lightly with his fingers, eyes widening as it vanished.
“The Deva is a guardian of nature. They live in everything, from the trees to the soil. They are invisible to the human eye, but they see everything that happens in the forest. They were touched by the love shared between Luciana and Nicolas, and they grieved at their deaths. They merged the trees themselves into an impenetrable wall. The Bougainvillea was trained across the wall and nurtured, growing into the entryway we came through.”
At this, Kreacher lifted his head immediately, “Of course Young Master! Kreacher is not thinking! Kreacher will take care of the home and Young Master. Young Master will be safe,” and then he surprised Draco by speaking rather sternly, “Young Master is to be calling Kreacher if Young Master is needing anything. Kreacher will take care of him.”
The cat went back to tormenting the toad, and Harry shook his head in amusement, unable to resist teasing him a bit, “Well now, aren’t you adorable, taking down that nasty toad?” Draco apparently did not find this funny, as he turned and actually growled at Harry, followed by a stream of yowls. He swore he could almost hear the curse words Draco was using.
Harry shook his head, “No thank you. I’ve been wearing glasses for so long, it’d feel weird without them. I would like a new pair though,” he said, eyeing the many options with more than a little excitement.
“He told me to go to the forest and place the records on the edge. He specified that I had to place the records, the diary, and my Heir’s ring in a row. I then had to speak aloud to the forest. I had to plead my case as to why I wanted to visit the oasis alone. So I did. I told them about me, all about us, starting back from first year. I explained that I wanted us to visit for a few days. I must have spoken for over an hour. I was beginning to get hoarse, but I persisted.”
"Thank you for helping with my hand Malfoy. I appreciate it. I have one last question for you. Did you know Umbridge was doing this to students?"
Nodding, Harry followed Healer Edwards through the door into the connecting hallway, watching his long black curls sway as he walked. “Where are all the machines?” Harry asked as they entered the exam room, not quite knowing what to make of it. Healer Edwards chuckled good-naturedly, “I thought the same thing on my first visit here; I’m muggleborn as you may have guessed. We don’t need machines. We use magic.
He strolled over and bent down, looking her directly in the eye. Unsurprisingly, there was no fear, only anger.
By now, Draco had recognized the blubbering voice of Dobby and the snide voice of Kreacher. He was beginning to feel the pain, and though it wasn’t nearly as strong as he would have expected, the noise was grating on his nerves.
When Harry finished heaving, he remained on the floor, his entire body trembling. Draco wrapped an arm around him, feeling Harry flinch and stiffen momentarily before relaxing into the embrace. It was a curiously intimate movement, but neither interrupted it. When Harry stopped shaking, Draco moved in front of him and tilted his face until Harry’s gaze met his. Draco was horrified to see that Harry’s face was streaked with tears. It pulled at something inside him he couldn’t identify.
Olivander chuckled, “I’m afraid it was my mistake. The Malfoy family has traditionally received wands made of Blackthorn, Hawthorn, and Yew. These wands tend to choose those who seek power. Their owners are often fearsome and notorious in their lifetimes. While not always the case, owners of these wands tend to practice the Dark Arts, as many in the Malfoy family have been known to do. I’m ashamed to admit that I allowed prejudice to overcome my judgment. I do apologize.”
“Well,” Draco said, “the story goes that each founder valued different traits in their students. Gryffindor valued courage, Ravenclaw intelligence, Slytherin cunning, and Hufflepuff hard work. Students are placed in their house based on whichever supposedly fits them best.”
“Do you think I give a bloody fuck about points right now?! I know because he told me, and I had to practically drag it out of him! He was sick and distraught after your lesson!” Draco spat the last word with disgust.
Merlin paused momentarily, as though gathering his thoughts. “First, for reasons I don’t quite understand, people were extremely nervous, even frightened when I greeted them.” Merlin shook his head, as though still perplexed by the issue. “After some time, I decided to change my appearance, and found that my younger self, for whatever reason, was much less intimidating. Besides,” he grinned, “why would I appear as a frail old man if I had another choice?”
The beauty was entrancing, and he almost jumped when Harry touched his arm, gesturing for him to look at the rest of the space. The grass was a brilliant green and looked almost too soft to be natural. Orchids of all colors covered the place, giving off a sweet fragrance. The far-right was covered by a large canopy, which looked as though it could be closed if one desired it. Inside the canopy was a tray covered with an array of food, a large cream-colored loveseat that was perfect for two, and lastly, an enormous bed covered with luxurious looking blankets and pillows. Draco’s mouth went dry seeing this.
, Umbridge’s wand,” Draco said, grinning as the wand flew effortlessly into his hand. “Much better. You won’t be needing it for a while, so I may as well hold on to it.”
Thoughts of Harry brought what little courage he had to the forefront. He’d waited too long to defy his father. He wasn’t going to make that mistake this time around. “Better to ‘debase’ myself with them than crawl on the floor like a miserable worm,” he hissed through clenched teeth. “Tell me, Father, did you buy black robes so they wouldn’t show the dirt you crawled through to lick the boots of your precious Lord?”
Harry was floating in the water, enjoying the perfect weightlessness of it all when he sensed something...strange. It felt like… a magical shift of some kind? But how was that possible?
Kreacher nodded, “So...Master Sirius is being...innocent?” He shook his head furiously when Draco nodded, “But...but this does not matter! Master Sirius abandoned my mistress! My mistress is dead and it is being his fault! Master Sirius broke her heart!” Kreacher burst into sobs, dropping to the floor. Draco knew all too well the pain of loss and felt a kinship with the elf he hadn’t expected.
After months of competition using up all my writing ability, followed by months of complications from ADHD, followed by a fall down the stairs, it's finally here, and I'm finally back, healed from my fall and ADHD being properly taken care of for the first time in my life.
A little look at what our boys got up to in the garden ;) MxM SMUT! EXPLICIT! Don't like, don't read.
“No Draco, it was just a normal root. You were struggling so much you didn’t pause to think. If you’d twisted your foot the right way, you could have gotten out from under it with no problem.” Harry said patiently.
proud. So yes, and thanks.” He turned and began to head toward the door. As he opened it, he turned his head toward Harry, “Oh and Potter? Next time, just ask. I don’t bite... Hard.” With one final smirk, he transformed into his cat form and began walking slowly down the corridor.
After finishing his lecture, he paused to gauge Harry's reaction. He would have expected rage, and maybe accusations of lying after such a speech; there were none. Harry's face seemed frozen in shock. His eyes were wide and he had gone pale.
Before he could begin to clean it up, however, the ink seeped into his skin, becoming a flat picture for several moments before disappearing altogether. Could this be…?
Draco seemed to guess this; he walked up to Harry and looked him in the eyes, hesitating for a moment before putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “There is one thing I do know about wands, Harry; they choose the wizard, but they don’t define them. Regardless of what similarities your wand shares with Voldemort’s, it’s what you do with the wand that matters most. Power means nothing compared to what you do with it. So don’t think on it another moment, alright?”
"That's correct, Draco," the man said solemnly as though reading his thoughts. "Look there," pointing towards the air above them. Draco obeyed, shocked when he saw what appeared to be a black snake floating in the breeze... only something wasn't right. All snakes were simply that. They weren't dark or light, despite the common misconception.
Tormented thoughts warred with the hope in his heart as he watched the magic, unseen to the rest of the world, stretch out towards his match.
They spent the rest of that day together uninterrupted; his father was away on business. They had lunch together, walked the grounds, and talked about everything. Draco couldn’t help but hug her several times and stayed as close to her as he could, reveling in every moment of it. With every embrace, smile, and laugh they shared, Draco reminded himself that he didn’t need to carry the weight of her death anymore; she was here, alive, and he was going to make sure she stayed that way.
“Why? Hasn’t done somethin’ to yeh has he?” Hagrid asked, narrowing his eyes and peeking around Harry to look for the blond.
as he landed. Draco didn’t know what he had hit his head on. The only thing that registered was the fire raging in his skull and the dampness of blood on his head.
“Excuse me?” This was a surprise. He couldn’t remember doing anything that would cause this level of anger. “Did what exactly?”
Harry sat on the nearest sofa and became lost in thought, once again thinking of Sirius. What would his godfather think of the current situation?
“Kreacher, please!” he shouted. Draco couldn’t be sure if it was the use of please that had done it, but Kreacher stopped immediately, breathing heavily with large tears streaming down his wrinkled face.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Draco said with a smile, “you did a great thing today. Go on back to Grimmauld Manor and I’ll see you later, okay?” Kreacher nodded, gave a little bow, and vanished.
When they walked through the doors of the eye-care center, Harry’s eyes widened at the sight before him. There was so much chaos he couldn’t tell how anything got done. Glasses flew through the air in all directions, some to shelves and some through an archway leading to the back of the office. They arranged themselves over and over, some even knocking each other off to try to take a space.
As the darkness closed in on him, he was able to register a faint mewling sound and a softness around his neck. The last sound he heard was a purring that seemed almost musical, before he allowed himself to be pulled under, finally succumbing to the inky blackness that called so sweetly to him, promising him freedom from pain, fear, and despair.
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he had to rub his eyes twice to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. He was standing inside what resembled a muggle apartment. Stepping forward slowly, in complete awe of his surroundings, he found a sitting room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom. As he was walking back through, he noticed a piece of parchment on the kitchen counter. He couldn’t help but scoff lightly as he read the words.
A croaky whisper broke Draco from his memories, “Kreacher welcomes you to the house of black. My mistress would be pleased to see young Malfoy in her home, son of most beloved Narcissa.”
Last warning, MxM SMUT! EXPLICIT! This is my very first smut piece ever. I never thought I'd do anything like this, so reviews are especially appreciated, and I hope you don't hate it!
He continued to follow the river until he came upon an enormous flock of white herons. They were resting on the banks of the river, and, like the deer, didn't seem to notice he existed, even as he stood right across the river from them. As he watched the snow-white birds preen themselves, Harry couldn't help but compare them to the peacocks at Malfoy Manor. While the Herons were beautiful and elegant, he had always found the peacocks creepy. They were white as well, but it seemed… wrong... as though they had been artificially drained of colour. The most important thing to Harry, however, was the fact that these birds were free. They could go anywhere they wanted. No one held them captive.
"Padfoot I… thank you. For everything. You're the only one who hasn't been trying to hide things from me. You always give me a say and treat me like a normal person. "
Once again, Harry’s expectations were thrown. Instead of protesting as he thought they would, Ron looked thoughtful for a moment before saying, “Well, how about we eat with you then?”
“I’m sorry, Kreacher, I can’t tell you that. I trust you, but I can’t risk anyone having that information right now. Do you understand?”
He nodded at his godfather without lifting his eyes from the thread, not registering the words as he watched the magic begin to swirl with the second phase of the Soulmate Ritual; the link. Whoever his soulmate was would have to accept the bond without ever knowing who he was.
Severus continued to study him for several moments before nodding his head. Draco sighed in relief as they rose from their respective seats and stood opposite one another.
Ancient gnarled trees covered the island in groves, creating a beautiful green tangle that he spent hours winding his way through. Being the only person on the island, he thought it would be quiet and perhaps even lonely, but the forest was alive with the sounds of wildlife. The twitters and songs of different birds, the humming of bees, the rustling of leaves, the fluttering of swarms of butterflies, and the endless sounds of life around him created a symphony of sound that was at once soothing and exciting.
Admittedly, it wasn’t the smartest thing in the world to do, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel any guilt or shame over losing control. If nothing else, Draco had been able to confirm something he’d long suspected: his father’s policy on a Pure-Blood being above emotions was completely mad.
“Spot-on, Kreacher!” Draco exclaimed, beaming at the house-elf, who flushed with pleasure at the praise. “Okay,” Draco said matter of factly, “Can you get the pouch back in Hagrid’s pocket, and then take the real stone back to the Grimmauld Manor?”
Draco wasn't surprised this time when Harry immediately nodded. He knew he was telling the truth and had been sure it would show on his face. He did not need his Malfoy mask and had decided against using it with Harry.
Dobby’s eyes filled with tears and Draco was afraid he was going to panic again. He had to choke back laughter when Kreacher slapped his hand over the other elves mouth and placed him in a headlock, speaking calmly despite the struggle, “Young Master is not to be listening to Dobby. Dobby is being a stupid elf and is knowing nothing about anything,” he said matter-of-factly, seemingly oblivious to the fight Dobby was trying to put up. “Young Master is being very lucky. The kitten is being bonded to Young Master as a familiar.”
Draco sighed and slumped in his chair, exhausted. He’d spent the entire day researching and firecalling and trying every single option he’d been given… and nothing. Was something wrong with their bond?
Kreacher nodded and disappeared. It was at this moment that the smell hit Draco’s nose again. Without wasting another second, he threw off his clothes, praying to Merlin the smell could at least be removed from his jacket, and returned to the bathroom where he intended to spend the next few hours scrubbing the scent from his skin.
“What happened then? Tell me!” Harry laughed outright at the curiosity and impatience coloring Draco’s tone before continuing, “finally, as the sun was beginning to set, I spotted a tiny colorful blur. It reminded me a bit of a snitch as I watched it fly around. All of a sudden, the thing did a dive bomb and stopped right in front of my nose! I was able to see then that it was a hummingbird. The little thing fluttered around my face for a moment, and then I heard a voice in my head! I thought I was going mental at first, but it introduced itself as a Deva, coming to me in that form.”
Harry with his stubbornness and infuriating way of acting before thinking… Gryffindors must be contagious!
Draco looked at Harry for a few more moments before smirking lightly, “Well… I do have an idea or two.” When he paused, Harry scoffed lightly, “Enough drama, out with it already!” Draco chuckled, “Well, this first part is just knocking her down a peg or two. She was very angry at first, but pretty soon she’ll be willing to do whatever we say.” Harry smiled at Draco’s use of the word ‘we’. “In the meantime,” Draco continued, “We’ll get into her office and find anything we can to incriminate her, getting rid of those blood quills while we are there. We can also work on a plan for getting her and the minister exposed. I was thinking Granger could be of help in that regard.”
Kreacher’s demeanor changed completely, “WON’T!” he screamed, “Sirius is being bad! Sirius abandoned my Master and Mistress! Kreacher won’t!” Kreacher began to beat himself and howl in fury. Draco felt ashamed; he knew how the elf felt about Sirius, and his loyalty to his previous master was now clashing with his desire to serve.
Too wired to sleep, and too tired to think of Malfoy, Harry lit his wand and reached into his bedside table, pulling out a small dragon-leather pouch. He clutched it in his hands fondly, thinking of Sirius, who had given it to him over the summer. He extinguished the light on his wand and lay back down, keeping hold of the pouch.
“There are several additional enhancements we can make; they can be charmed to repel against the elements; snow, rain, fog, and things of that sort so that you can see in any weather. I’m sure you’ve already noticed that they automatically adjust to fit your face. That is a permanent feature; they will grow as you do. Lastly, we can charm them to transition, allowing you to see perfectly regardless of the lighting.”
He reached a point where the water was crystal clear and beautiful, freezing where he stood as a herd of red deer emerged from the forest. He thought they would see him and flee, but they took no notice of him at all. He scarcely dared to breathe, petrified of breaking the enchantment he had wandered into. The doe took turns drinking from the water while they watched the fawns frolic and play. When they were done, they simply wandered back into the forest. Harry stood there for several minutes afterwards, his heart warmed by the sight of the beautiful family.
As he tried to clear his thoughts, Draco jumped lightly when he felt a warm tingle against his hand. When he opened his eyes, he was shocked and confused to see his hand covered in ink, despite a lack of quill or ink. He watched curiously as the ink seeped into his hand, as though it was a picture drawn on parchment instead of skin. He brushed his hand with his fingers lightly, an idea occurring to him as the ink disappeared at his touch.
There was no safe answer to this question; Draco knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt. It was simply another method of intimidation. Any answer would only give his father information he hadn’t had before.
Love and hugs to my beta Freyja_Luna, and Kaedmarie, who helped me work out all of the kinks in the story.
He reached for the ink, cursing under his breath when he knocked over the bottle, covering his hand in ink.
Relief washed over him like a cool breeze as the space was illuminated by glowing orbs of light, revealing the end of the staircase as well as a passageway beyond it.
I can't believe this took me a month to get out! Please don't hate me! Story issues and my competition caused some delays!
Something must have shown on his face, because her eyes grew wide with concern and she rose, “Are you alright?” she asked with worry coloring her tone.
“But hold on,” Draco protested, “aren’t you supposed to be ancient? Long white hair and beard, long staff, that sort of thing?”
Draco sighed, looking at the ground. Harry noticed he had a habit of doing that when he was embarrassed in some way.
Credit, love and thanks to Kaede-marie and Ghostie for working with me on this chapter. Couldn't do it without them! Love as always to all of my Lovely Larks and all of my new friends for their continued support!
Merlin stared at him with slight reproach and Draco winced, mentally scolding himself. Merlin was the most powerful wizard who ever lived; He really should have had more tact. “I just meant...you don’t look the way you were painted at Hogwarts,” he trailed off, nervous about the reaction to his insult, unintentional though it had been.
As he walked, the scenery began to change. The autumn gold sycamores were slowly replaced by the dark green pine until the green was all that remained. He continued following the stream of colours until it led him to a dirt path, then promptly vanished. Harry anticipated the next note that appeared, catching this one in his hand.
“Of course, Madam,” he said respectfully, allowing his face to twist into a sneer as he followed behind her. His trap had snapped shut.
Remembering his promise to Dobby, Draco said carefully, “Oh..erm…not today Kreacher.” Draco paused when he saw Kreacher seem to deflate a bit. He found he truly wanted to help Kreacher, he just wasn’t sure how.
Nine minutes and 48 seconds later, Draco emerged from the shop, looking slightly calmer, much to Harry’s relief.
Harry stared at Draco in bewilderment and admiration. He couldn’t understand how he could speak to an adult like that. If Draco’s flaw was that he didn’t think before he spoke, Harry’s was that he never spoke at all, at least not when it came to adults. If an adult was making him uncomfortable in any way, he usually just stood there and accepted it. Harry supposed it was a habit born from years with Uncle Vernon.
Harry clenched his teeth and tried his hardest not to say what he was thinking: that this behavior was far more unprofessional than missing when they walked into the store.
He spent the next several days exploring every inch of his body and mind, waiting for a dream, touching strangers to see if he felt a positive or negative of any kind… nothing. It was infuriating. The only thing that kept him sane was the knowledge that his soulmate, wherever they were, had accepted the bond and were likely doing the same thing.
Harry and Draco saw none of it. As they made the age-old promises, they had eyes only for each other and their hearts were full of love.
With a wave of his hand, Merlin healed Draco’s injuries before answering. “There are a number of possibilities for those with the gift of magic, human and otherwise. Where they go depends on the life they lived, the death they suffered, and many things in between.”
“Well, that was a cover-up,” Harry looked at him sheepishly, “ I wanted to bring you here, but I needed to investigate first. Even here, I’m well known, and the villagers were happy to show me around and share their history. I was led to the forest and tried exploring it for several days. I spoke to the village elder about it after having no success. He informed me that only couples were able to find the path, and even though they may find the path, they would not find the oasis if their hearts were untrue. A person on their own would see nothing at all, simply wandering the forest aimlessly.”
His heart started to race and his palms started to sweat. Draco was overcome with the memory of the last time he had seen his mother. The pain and grief ripped through him as if it had just happened. His mother continued to hum and he shook his head, trying to dispel the negative emotions. He reminded himself that his mother was alive just past this door, and raised his shaking hand once again.
“Er… Good job?” The cat stuck his nose in the air, almost looking as though he were preening himself for the accomplishment.
While knowing all of this did make Harry feel a little better, the comparisons Olivander had made still weighed on him heavily.
Harry couldn’t handle it, it was too funny. It started with a chuckle, and before he knew it, he was rolling in laughter on the floor, holding his sides from the force of it. “Oh, Merlin,” he choked out between laughs, “You… you… ha-ha-ha!” He was actually struggling to breathe at this point, but he just couldn’t stop.
Draco looked up curiously as Harry took off in the direction Hagrid went. He turned back briefly, “I’m not angry. I promise I’ll be right back.” Draco hesitated, then nodded.
“Not a big deal? Harry,” the blond paused, taking a calming breath, “Olivander compared your wand to Voldemort’s. He made it sound like you could be headed the same way as him, just because your cores were from the same bird,” Draco scoffed, “
"What-" he said, turning around. The question died in his throat as he took in the sight of Draco on one knee, holding a square box.
Despite the beauty, Harry couldn't help but feel irritated. Not only had Draco used a portkey to dump him in an unknown forest, but he hadn't even seen fit to show up!.
Thursday evening, Draco was doing homework when Harry burst into the Room, his face pale and clammy. He took one look at Draco before dropping to his knees and vomiting. Thanks to the magic of the room, the mess disappeared as soon as it hit the floor. Draco moved behind Harry and, after hesitating a moment, began to rub his back gently. It was amazing what sharing a bed, even when one is in cat form, could do for a relationship.
It seemed to work. Draco noticed Harry had stopped fidgeting and looked a great deal less nervous than before. Harry returned Draco's smile, surprising him by saying, “Well, I’m here with Hagrid. I don’t know if you’ve heard of him? He’s the groundskeeper at Hogwarts," Harry paused, and Draco nodded for him to continue,"  Anyway, I’m sure you don’t need help, but you could come shopping with us if you like.”
“It’s very simple; regardless of what house you and others end up in when you go back, I want you to do what you can to take down the walls that separate you from your peers. I believe that if one generation started this mess, another generation can repair it.”
Struck by sudden inspiration, Draco Malfoy had decided to visit Umbridge. Although he had been in her office before, the sight of it never failed to sicken him. The room was heinous, having been decorated in the most garish mismatched pinks he had ever seen. The walls looked like several tea parties had exploded, and the cats covering the gaudy plates nearly made him regret his animagus form.
As though they had heard his thoughts, the Herons took off into the sky, responding to some silent instinct as old as time itself. Harry stood and watched until they had all but disappeared into the setting sun. He was left thinking of Draco, and how he was the only thing in the world that gave Harry the sense of freedom in flight although he remained on the ground.
His mother looked towards him and smiled, speaking softly, “Good morning, my darling. What brings you here?”
With nothing else to distract him, Harry became lost in thought, trying to imagine what it would be like to see clearly again.
“You is being correct, Young Master,” Kreacher said. Dobby had ceased his struggle, his eyes showing interest in the subject, but apparently, Kreacher wasn’t willing to take any risks, keeping his hold firm around Dobby’s head. “Most of the bonds is being made by magic, and the wizard is forcing the animal to be obeying. A bond that is being forced is not being a true bond, and there is being no true power in it.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Apparently, Malfoy couldn't refrain from using insults, even when he tried to say something nice. Harry's first instinct had been to crumple the note and be done with it, but for some reason, he couldn't.
nearly blurring his vision as he started to write. He was careful to avoid the parchment, but otherwise let them fall freely down his face. For several minutes, he poured his sorrow, anger, and grief onto the parchment. When he felt he couldn’t say anything else, he ended the letter with an apology for bearing his burdens and hopes that Harry would understand. Before he could second guess himself, Draco signed and addressed the letter, summoned his owl, and sent it off. As alien as it felt to be that open with another person, his instincts were telling him that doing so would help them both in the end. Difficult as it was, he was going to trust them.
Within a few moments, Draco’s foot was free. He scrambled to his feet and faced Harry, who was smirking at him, amusement shining in his eyes.
Swallowing a thick lump in his throat, Harry nodded, unable to speak. Healer Edwards reached out and pat his shoulder, “Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I’ll see you next year.”
After dealing with being killed, ending up in a strange place, and humiliating himself by fainting in front of Merlin, Draco has some difficult decisions to make.
After a few moments, anticipation began to get the better of Harry. He had never been very patient as it was, but now he could hardly stand it. He wished Hagrid would move a little faster. Truthfully, Harry was restless enough that he would have run all the way there if it were an option. He could hardly believe he would finally be getting new glasses.
With that thought in mind, Harry left immediately with the portkey, wrapping it in his cloak to avoid touching it until he stepped outside. When his stomach settled from the travel… he still hated portkeys… he began to walk around the island.
, he grudgingly admitted to himself, he had no trouble putting up a front for someone he disdained. It was a relief, as he had plans that relied on flawless deception.
Harry rushed to Draco, taking his face gently in his hands, “Please don’t be upset with me. I know I should have told you, but I thought you might run away from us. Why? Why didn’t you tell me?”
Incredibly humbled, Draco looked away and rose to his feet, wincing as he registered the pain in his hands.
The inner pep talk didn’t work very well, but as they made their way back to the sitting area, Harry screwed up every ounce of Gryffindor courage he had. Instead of sitting across from Draco, he sat next to him on the sofa. Draco looked at him curiously for a moment but didn’t comment. “Er… So… There’s something I wanted to talk to you about.”
As he started to get out of bed, a piece of parchment folded in half appeared with a pop, landing right in front of him. Harry scanned it thoroughly for any sign of dark magic or ill intent. Finding none, he opened it.
Harry turned toward Draco, wordlessly requesting his opinion. Draco studied him for only a moment before exclaiming, “They look brilliant, Harry! Much better than those horrid old things.” Harry laughed, “Thanks, mate. I won’t need to try on any others. I’m going to take these back to Healer Edwards.”
Today was, without a doubt, the strangest day of Harry’s life. If he was honest, it had been a trying day; finding out he was famous was almost more of a shock than discovering he was a wizard. The shock from learning the details of the night his parents died was so great that he immediately blocked it from his mind, hoping to sort through his feelings at a better time.
He sighed at the other boy. “Fine then….Harry.” Draco said, looking away with a small degree of stiffness, still fearful of rejection.
"No, Harry," Draco said fiercely, grasping his chin tighter, "Those people out there don't deserve you. Fuck Voldemort. Fuck Voldemort. Fuck them all. The world would be a much darker place without you. You are strong, smart, funny, sarcastic, talented, stubborn, reckless, brave. You are a beautiful person, not because of what you did, but because of who you are. Never again, do you understand me?"
The beauty that surrounded him with each step was like nothing he’d ever seen. The entire island was covered in a series of lakes, connected by small rivers and waterfalls. One of his ancestors had built a series of bridges into the surrounding mountainsides, allowing him to gaze endlessly at the crystal and turquoise blues of the water.
When he opened his eyes, he flailed in surprise at the beam of white light shooting towards him, causing him to nearly drown in his attempt to dodge whatever attack this was.
Draco looked towards the elves, careful not to move too much. He got the sense that it wouldn’t be a good idea to interrupt Lyra in whatever it was she was doing. “Is she healing me somehow?” he asked quietly.
Words were mumbled in a foreign language Draco didn't recognize. Lucius touched his wand to the knife, which shifted from glinting silver to the darkest of black.
Of course, When Harry was finally taken to get his glasses, Aunt Petunia had gotten him the cheapest and, in her outspoken opinion, ugliest pair possible. Afterward, he was locked in his cupboard for the rest of the day for the “inconvenience” he had caused.
Forcing his feet and eyes forward, Draco recovered himself and moved towards his table. Oddly, the concern in Harry's eyes had calmed his nerves, reminding him that there was someone there to help him absorb the blow of whatever his father had planned.
Sirius Black had been called a lot of things, many of them quite nasty, but patience was certainly something he was never accused of having.
Draco gasped in pain as he was hauled to his feet by the scruff of his robes, his father lifting him so that his feet were barely touching the floor. His voice was low and menacing as he looked down at Draco, “Did you think I wouldn’t find out that you were gallivanting about with Dumbledore’s worthless servant and the insignificant brat who somehow managed to destroy our Lord? You dare to debase our family name in such a way? What do you have to say for yourself?”
Harry had taken to hiding away in the Black Family Library rather frequently during his stay at Grimmauld Place. He had found an old sofa in a darkened corner, worn but at least free of creatures. Harry had found it was a great place to silently brood in his anger. That morning, Harry was lying on the couch, as usual, arms crossed, raging at the world. He'd been there for several hours and had been starting to fall asleep when suddenly, a large black dog jumped on top of him, licking his face furiously.
Once again Draco was nearly thrown into shock. This had been the last thing he expected. He knew Harry had no idea of who Draco really was, and had hoped beyond hope for a fresh start. It never occurred to him how little he actually knew about his long-time rival. At once he was gripped by fear. Although his father had never actually hurt him, Lucius Malfoy did not permit defiance and was certainly a dangerous man. Though he had never been on the brunt end of his father's rage, he had seen it enough times to be afraid of it. He also had no idea how the other Slytherins would react once word got out. He could be ostracized, disowned, possibly even hurt or killed. Could he risk all of that for a chance to be free? He knew if he remained silent he would be forced into servitude under that madman, and soon. He would no doubt be tortured regardless of any efforts he made. He would eventually be forced to hurt others, to kill. That thought decided for him, and he knew what he had to do.
"I'm guessing that you don't know much about blood quills besides what they do. Yes, they are tools of dark magic used to carve a message into one's skin, while simultaneously writing the same message in that person's blood. Pureblood families and tutors often threaten punishment with them, but they are considered archaic by the majority, and rarely are the threats carried out. What many don't know is that blood quills are impervious to magic, other than spells designed to make the punishment worse, for example, Poison, boils, or reopening of the wound at random times even after it has healed. From the look of it, I would say she's been having you use the blood quill on its most basic setting until this point. This time around, however, Umbridge has used your pride against you. She somehow knew that you would not seek help for this wound, and would instead try to fix it yourself. Because of this, she used curse magic on the quill so that the marks would continue to bleed and increase in pain as long as you tried to treat it yourself. These marks will only begin to heal when someone else tends to it. Otherwise, it would simply torment you until you have in or the curse was removed. You wouldn't have died, even from blood loss, but the pain would grow to unimaginable levels. I imaging Umbridge would have removed it after some time, though how much time is anyone's guess. Sadistic bitch."
When Draco didn’t respond, Harry couldn’t help but look up, meeting the grey eyes that were still wide with disbelief. “Well…” Harry faltered, “What do you think?”
“I should expect so,” he said haughtily. “Anyone who would put the school in jeopardy should be dealt with appropriately and immediately.”
Looking at his friends, he couldn’t believe how this was going. He’d been sure that Ron was going to explode again and that Hermione was going to draw the line at not following Dumbledore. He looked at her, his eyes wide, and she chuckled, “I know I’m the first one to go on about rules and authority and such, so it won’t make much sense to you.  Regardless of his intentions, Dumbledore allowed a lot of this to happen and is ignoring you when you need him most! Of course, I’m going to support you!”
He’d been offered countless jobs with the Ministry and various other protection agencies, but he didn’t want to be accepted without finishing his education, otherwise, it would just be something else he was getting because of his name. Besides that, he’d had enough fighting. He didn’t know what to do with his life, but it certainly wasn’t that.
Looking sheepish, which was an odd expression on the wizard, Merlin admitted, “The truth is that I am breaking a lot of rules by offering you this chance, and even in death, The Powers That Be watch Harry closely. They would know immediately if I were to attempt to send him back in time, and they would put a stop to it. Regardless of what was meant to be, they don’t take kindly to the idea of me, or others like me, tampering with what has already come to pass. In fact, it has never been done before.”
Draco was shocked by Dobby’s speech; it seemed the elf truly cared about his well-being. His guilt at his earlier behavior towards the elf, and house-elves in general, intensified. Draco had only shown basic kindness, and Dobby was acting like a completely different elf. “All right, Dobby. I promise.”
wands, Harry.” Draco sighed and began to pace back and forth. He’s always spouting ideas about how the wand chooses the wizard and the characteristics of wands, as though they were alive. He told me what mine looks for in an owner this morning. Yet he completely ignored that with you, just because of who you are!”
“Well...alright,” Draco paused, “But be careful Kreacher, Dementors are nothing to mess around with. If anything goes wrong, come back at once.”
“It was,” Harry agreed, “The Deva asked me to picture you and to imagine my feelings for you and our relationship. Afterward, it spoke into my mind again. It told me that normally they would not make such allowances. Wands are not allowed past the curtain, and they do not let visitors make changes to the oasis. They made an exception for us because of our story. Like Luciana and Nicolas, we were on opposite sides of a war. Instead of giving in to hate and fear, we came together. Because of this, as long as I gave my word I would not change the integrity of the oasis, they would let me add a few comforts, and stay longer than the usual permitted time of 24 hours, provided that is, that you could see the curtain in the first place.”
He felt as though he'd been hit in the head by a bludger as he registered the meaning behind Draco's words.
Draco was going to ask the man what he meant, but Olivander shuffled towards a different section of the store. He plucked a wand and handed it to Draco. Immediately, Draco was engulfed by a golden glow and his body was flooded with warmth and joy; he had found his match.
Cursing his own cowardice, Draco turned to leave. Caught up in his thoughts once again, his foot hit the wall a bit as he turned. The noise was small, but deafening in the silence. Slowly, he turned back and forced himself to face Harry. It would do no good to run now. He might as well face the consequences of his spying and get it over with. After seemingly an eternity, grey eyes met emerald green, and the world stood still. All at once, Draco felt as though he was frozen to the ground, pinned beneath the emerald green eyes which seemed to spark with fury. His mouth went completely dry, and he found he couldn't say a word.
“That is utter shite and you know it!” Draco yelled, cutting off his godfather once again. Normally Severus would never stand for this behaviour, but he was completely shocked by the fact that his godson was yelling and cursing at him. It seemed as though he had indeed abandoned his father’s teachings if he was willing to lose control like this.
“Holly wands are protective of their owners and paired well with those who may experience danger as a result. Phoenix feathers are essentially picky, and the fact that your wand had responded so strongly was a good thing. He also said that holly and phoenix are hard to combine, and the fact that yours did makes it an exceptionally powerful wand.”
“Mr. Potter,” Mr. Edwards said a few moments later, his voice laced with concern, “how long have you had these glasses?”
“Excellent question, Mr. Malfoy,” he praised. “Cedar wands are known to match with those who possess great strength of character as well as loyalty. They are also known to be very protective of those they love, and quite fierce in that protectiveness. It’s not a wand you find often in the hands of a dark witch or wizard.”
Draco stumbled, falling to the ground from the unexpected blow. His father had moved so fast that he hadn’t anticipated the backhand. Within a moment, Draco stood, knowing that staying on the ground would only make his father call him a coward.
Draco laughed softly as he settled back on his pillow, jumping slightly when the humming abruptly stopped and Lyra came to snuggle against his neck.
Harry sighed, "Well? Are you just going to stare at me all day Ferret? In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a little busy here. Why don't you go round up some helpless first years? I'm sure Umbridge would love to have some more students torture themselves under her nose…..Bloody hell why won't the bleeding stop! Just get out of here Malfoy. I don't have time for your pathetic attempts at insults today."
But even as the world tumbled into chaos and darkness, Draco Malfoy could only focus on the figure advancing towards him.
Kreacher’s eyes began to shine again, and Draco was petrified he would begin to cry again; he really wasn’t used to handling emotional breakdowns. Instead, Kreacher just asked, “You...you would be wanting to stay with Kreacher?”
His mother waved her hand, dismissing his concern, “I was able to step away for a moment. Your father is still in his meetings. You know how he is.”
Draco was confused. Where was he? What had happened? His head was fuzzy and he couldn’t seem to think straight.
While Draco would have enjoyed the opportunity to spend more time with his mother, he was relieved that at least this time he knew his way around; last time had been frightening and overwhelming. After reflecting for a few moments, Draco decided it was probably better this way; he may need the ability to move about without the concern of maintaining appearances.
He looked at Harry and gasped. He could see it. Harry’s emerald eyes were glowing with love, affection, and hope.
“I don’t know anything about wands,” Draco admitted, “so I demanded that Olivander tell me about your wand. The wood and its core alone; not that nonsense from earlier.”
“I saw my father… He bullied Snape. He was horrible to him. Worse than you ever were, even worse than my cousin… ” He looked at Draco, his eyes red, swollen, and once again shining with tears. “He thinks I’m just like my father. He says so, all the time. He’s only teaching me because Dumbledore made him. I can handle the way he treats me in class, but the way he tore through my memories… and he mocked them, Draco. it’s like he’s getting back at my father by tormenting me.”
Narcissa turned towards Harry, a small smile playing on her lips. "You make sure he gets himself something special, alright?” she instructed in mock sternness, as though designating an important task. “Don’t let him worry about what his father might say.”
Before Draco could think up an intelligent response, Harry continued, “Besides, if it does turn out that you are the smarmy prat I always thought you were, I can just ask the room to refuse you when I’m inside.”
Their first night together, Dragon had started to curl up on the floor by the window. Harry, to the cat’s surprise, had picked him up and placed him on the bed, before lying down next to him. Dragon looked at him curiously, and Harry merely rolled his eyes, reminding him that the whole reason he was here was so that he wouldn’t have to do things like that. Dragon had huffed lightly before settling down on the pillow next to Harry and falling fast asleep.
Marching forward with all the purpose and elegance of a Malfoy that he could muster under the circumstances, he gestured for Harry to lead the way.
Though it was still a little unnerving, Draco nodded, deciding it wasn’t worth worrying about in the grand scheme of things. “How far back would you send me, then?”
He would have been alarmed if he weren’t used to the idea of magical creatures, and the sight itself wasn’t so beautiful.
After what seemed an eternity of picking at his food and barely acknowledging his housemates, Draco heard the familiar flutter of owls bringing the morning post. His eyes immediately locked on the magnificent eagle owl soaring towards him, a letter with a familiar red glare in its claws.
Harry cast a Tempus charm, shocked to realize it was already afternoon. Thankfully, it was Saturday, so he didn't have to worry about lost time. Harry quickly dressed, gathered his things, and headed for the kitchens.
“I can’t believe him!” Draco burst out, “Not only does he not even think to bring you here; but now that you are here he just skives off! I’m sorry, Harry, I know he’s nice and everything, but it just seems so irresponsible! There are other things you obviously need, and all he thinks of is the list!”
Harry looked at him with skepticism, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh lightly, “Okay, so I don’t know
“We will re-charm the glasses every year when you get an exam. That is unless you choose a new pair, which you are always free to do. If you have any problems or concerns, just send an owl or come on by. Does that sound good?”
Draco sighed and knelt in front of Harry. “I know you can, but you don’t have to. This isn’t right, and it’s not going to happen again,” he said firmly. “I’m going to have a chat with Snape, and then you and I are going to see Dumbledore. This ends tonight.”
As Harry broke through the treeline, he was forced to a sudden stop. He had come to the top of a very steep hill. The stream of light vanished, and he wasn't sure what to do now. He contemplated his options for a few minutes before deciding to climb down the hill. As he placed his foot on the edge, another note appeared.
Draco knew the answer, of course, but he had to ask the question to keep up appearances. His heart ached as Harry’s eyes filled with sadness, “No, they’re magic but...I didn’t grow up with them. They died, and I grew up with my muggle relatives. They...don’t like me much.”
“Why so far? And why me?” With everything he’d done, surely there would be someone better. Images of Weasley, Granger, and countless others flashed through his mind.
Draco shivered despite the warmth, his skin breaking out in gooseflesh. He wasn’t sure he liked this story, but he was captivated.
Nodding, Draco continued, “You are aware that Sirius was convicted of murdering twelve muggles and a wizard by the name of Peter Pettigrew?”
In another 10 minutes, Harry had his glasses. They fit perfectly and he could see better than could ever remember. Healer Edwards came into focus and Harry admired intricate blue flowers decorating his tie; he had thought it was just blue before.
"I don't support Voldemort. My father does. But I'll get to that in a minute. As to why I never said anything, by the time I realized the truth of the matter, we were firmly on different sides in the eyes of the world. I did as my father expected. As the enemy of the Dark Lord, you were to be hated. I was expected to torment you and best you in every way. Just as an example, my father bought my way onto the quidditch team just to pit me against you. It's the same way for nearly all of Slytherin. We are expected to hate you because of who we are."
He didn't wait for Draco's agreement and left the room without another word. Draco sat, stunned, his earlier hopes returning. He knew he couldn't risk anyone seeing the emotions in his eyes or the exhaustion on his face, even at this time of night; so he spent some time in the alcove calming himself until he was sure no one would notice any difference. Once he was satisfied, he swiftly made his way to the dungeons. The common room was empty and everyone in his house was already asleep, at least from what he could tell. He was just barely able to dress and lock his curtains, before the night's events rushed back at him and he was overcome with exhaustion. He was asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. That night he dreamt of happy things for the first time in months. He dreamt of flying and freedom and slept soundly through the night.
This day…traipsing through a forest, being bitten by bugs, tripping and humiliating himself…Draco was mortified. He turned away from Harry, his eyes downcast, and tried in vain to fix his clothes and hair.
First, the links for my lovely betas, as they deserve all the attention and credit I can give them for getting me through this.
"Harry, I know that I sometimes have trouble saying the important things out loud. That's why I chose to write those notes today. I feel as though you and I were made for each other. I want it to be you and me against the world, for the rest of our lives."
As if pulled by an outside force, he turned once more to the Gryffindor table, and all at once, he knew the answer. Harry's eyes were blazing with fury and locked on the spot above Draco's head where smoke still hung in the air.
Without another word, Draco approached Grimmauld Place. He’d only ever seen it at night and he was rather shocked to find that it wasn’t any less gloomy during the day. Stepping towards the large and battered front door, Draco braced himself, remembering that the house had been left empty and decaying for the past six years. He reached out to knock on the silver handle, jumping slightly when the door opened, seemingly on its own, releasing the most intense smell of neglect and decay Draco could ever have imagined. It took all of his willpower to step over the threshold and into the dimly lit hallway.
"I'm doing this because I care. I never hated you. Not really. I was angry with you when you dismissed me on the train our first year. Of course, now I know what a pompous arse I was, but I didn't at the time. All that I knew was that you had dismissed me for someone I thought lower than myself. I decided to torment you any way I could because of it. I resented you, and Weasley and Granger. I don't anymore. I'm not the same person I used to be. I only wanted to be friends with you back then because of your fame. Your scar. But that's not the case anymore. And I certainly won't stand by while you've been tortured by Umbridge. If you'll let me help you, I will."
It didn’t sound so difficult; he’d managed to become friendly enough with students outside of his house after he’d defected from the death eaters the first time, and that was under the most impossible of circumstances. Something Merlin had said made him wonder, “What do you mean, ‘regardless of which house’?”
Merlin appeared to be pleased, but halted him once again, “Hold on Draco. Before you agree to this, I need to make a request of you.”
Draco nearly laughed at the layer of messages his father was sending to the public. Lucius not delivering this message in person would show that Draco was no longer worth the effort. At the same time, the howler would announce his betrayal to all who were present. In truth, it was rather predictable; his father had always had a flair for the dramatic.
Harry’s answering smile was blinding, and without wasting another second, he crushed their lips together. Their kiss was filled with such love and passion, that the Devas themselves could feel it, though of course they were outside the oasis at the time. The forest rejoiced, for two lovers from opposite sides came together.
At that moment a pair of glasses sailed just past Harry’s ear, causing him to jump back in shock. Draco turned toward the receptionist with a light glare, “Excuse me, but just how is he supposed to pick a pair of glasses if they are flying all over the place?”
“So,” Harry grinned, turning towards Draco, “where do we go next? We have everything we need, right?” Harry secretly hoped Draco would have more ideas in mind; he didn’t want to return to the Dursleys yet.
He moved over to the mirror and was surprised again when his reflection shifted into focus. He looked around and found that everything else was still blurry; he realized it must have something to do with the mirror. Harry was ecstatic to find that he loved everything about these glasses. They were light and comfortable, and he thought they looked much better than the horrid round ones he would be tossing out today.
"Alright yes, you told me so. Don't be so smug about it," Harry said, his voice mumbled by Draco's shirt.
Draco was unable to contain his amusement at the situation any longer and burst into great peals of laughter. After a few moments, he wiped his eyes and lowered his face to hers, a malicious grin on his face.
“Alright calm down, I’ve got you,” Harry said, moving over to take a closer look at the situation, still chuckling, seemingly unable to help himself. Draco glared petulantly at the forest floor and waited.
Surprised that Draco had picked up on exactly what Harry was afraid of, he asked, “Why does it matter who he is?”
This was proven when, a few moments later, Draco spotted Harry and the gamekeeper Hagrid. He remembered that Hagrid had the philosopher’s stone with him. On a whim, Draco decided it would be best to do something about it; if the stone never entered Hogwarts, there was no risk of Quirrel getting it.
An abashed smile lingering faintly on his cheeks, Harry -- with his unusually shy demeanour -- picked up his and started eating his soupe à l'oignon.
Still looking at the way the man had run off to, Harry brought up a hand and swept off nonexistent dust from his shoulder.
"Pfft-" Draco smothered a laugh, and so did the waitress -- judging from the look on her face -- much to Harry's shame.
"It's you!" Harry gasped shocked, his eyes flashed and a finger pointed accusingly at the slimy Slytherin.
Harry frowned, he could never understand what was it the man had written that made his writings blow up. Not that he hadn't tried to understand, he himself had borrowed the book from Hermione. It was by far one of the most obvious mystery novels he'd ever lay hands on. No wonder Hermione didn't make any threat and gave it to him without reluctance the second he asked for it.
Harry raised a brow back at her in a challenge. "What makes you assume he'll be taking me home? Not the other way around?" he asked, slightly offended.
The sound of footsteps neared their table, Harry looked in its direction and saw the young lady from earlier standing near him with food trays perfectly balanced, perched on her hands and forearms so effortlessly. Harry suspected there was magic involved in that.
Draco chuckled and leaned closer with a smirk that made Harry's stomach became a habitat for butterflies.
Not to his knowledge, the blond Malfoy's lips quirked in amusement as he found the dark-haired man's behaviour quite endearing.
Blush spread across his face, Harry turned and clamped a hand to his mouth. So much blood rushed to his face, Harry was positive that it would eventually overflow from his nose.
Though, that seemed to be enough to inflate Draco's already big ego as he looked very satisfied with himself, all the while half-smiling and half-smirking.
The date then went on uneventfully, with them just talking about random stuff, or mostly Quidditch as it was a topic they both commonly shared a great interest in.
If Harry ever felt magical, he certainly was now. And it was Draco Malfoy who he was sharing the moment with.
Harry took a sip from his cup and gulped it down too quickly, he almost choked himself to death before the time of his date even arrived.
Draco merely leaned forward and smirked slyly. He answered confidently, "I'll make you wish for a next time."
A short squeal emitted from him, it disappeared as quickly as it began as he disguised it -- futilely -- with a cough.
A waitress came up to their table at the raise of Draco's hand. She conjured a book and began writing very quickly, her eyes snapping back and forth from her book to the table and then back. She then vanished the empty dishes with a wave of her wand.
In fact, the git was rather...pleasant? He was all right, Harry might be wrong, but the blond at the moment had his nose slightly stuck up in the air like he was preening from the delectable meals he had chosen, sort of.
Yeah, I'll be back here again, absolutely, he thought while nodding to himself with a mental note to bring Ron and Hermione with him, or his parents...Sirius and Remus, too...fuck it, the whole damn family!
Harry glared at him, looking the most threatening possible with pink hues still lingering on his cheeks. "Old man?" Harry asked incredulously. "Malfoy, we're the same age. You're even months older than me if I remember correctly."
"I wouldn't have said so, if I hadn't meant it, no?" He looked forward, sneaking several glances at the beaming man beside him as he talked.
Blushing as red as beetroot, he felt himself threatening to melt under Draco's gaze, his legs going weak like jelly.
He honestly had no idea that a date could be so enjoyable since this was his first, and he didn't mind one bit to go on another with Draco.
"Well?" Harry prompted, growing a little impatient by the second. Even more when Ron and Hermione exchange that sickening, knowing look that made Harry incredibly left out whenever they did it.
"W-well, then... We should be going," said Harry quickly. He turned on his heels, and disentangled himself from the blond man and headed towards the manor.
Harry soon got up from his seat and smoothed the imaginary wrinkles of his green dress shirt that Hermione had insisted on wearing.
"Ah, pardon. A person by at least average intelligence could've tell where we are from a single look," he smirked with a side-eyed glance at the look on Harry's face.
All he could do at the moment was to stare back at the cool grey eyes before his own. They seemed to be very...breath-taking, and...
Draco made a sound of acknowledgement before uttering a "You're welcome", and took the utensils in his hands and started eating.
Harry laughed a real, genuine laugh at Draco's words. And the cold, indifferent Malfoy actually smiled back at him.
The blond nodded in agreement. "Yes, and that's why we're going on a little trip together, Potter," he stated.
Harry looked down on his lap to hide his blush from sight. Draco's voice was muffled in the background as he made his order. Harry fidgeted his fingers absentmindedly.
If there was a turn off button on a human's body, he'd already done that the second his stomach sold him out.
Harry pouted, his cheeks blossomed a faint pink shade. A memory from last week entered his mind. Ron sure as hell didn't miss the opportunity to poke fun at him, saying his obsession with the blond git had resurfaced.
Harry rolled his eyes at that. "Yeah, yeah, keep saying that. You know what they say about white-blond hair. It makes you look-"
Harry looked up, seemingly to ponder about it. Before coming to a conclusion that he, admittedly, had no clue, at all. Which wasn't surprising at all to Draco. It was only expected from the dense Gryffindor.
"Don't worry I'll take full responsibility." A smirk formed on his face again. "Hoping for me to feed you hot soup in bed, Potter?"
Harry tapped his foot repeatedly on the floor as he did whenever he felt nervous -- a habit that irritated Hermione to no end. With a fingernail bitten down between two rows of perfect white teeth, he spared the clock on the wall a glance.
A smirk curved his lips as he stared down at the shorter wizard. "Good to see that your choice of clothes had improved over the past week, Potter." His grey eyes looked at him up and down.
"Remarkable observation skills, really Potter," Draco said unimpressed, sarcasm dripping heavily from his voice.
"So did I," Draco's smooth voice spoke a little too quickly. Draco caught himself and hurriedly added, "I mean, it wasn't so bad, Potter. Who knew you weren't as insufferable as I thought."
Draco nodded, proceeding into his leisurely paced stroll.  "Yes, I do horse riding here. Every Sunday. It's a little hobby of mine." he shrugged as though it was something everyone did for a living.
"Harry, will you quit that?" Every person that has encountered Hermione Granger in their lives knew it was not a question.
Ron laughed, and so did Hermione, a small chuckle she usually gave him whenever he found something confusing.
"Come on, Potter! Do you wish to stay here? Because I'm leaving!" There came Draco's impatient voice tickling his ear.
A slight pang of what could be discerned as disappointment struck his chest and Harry had no choice but to push it down.
And dare Harry thought that, just maybe -- because now was still too early, but just maybe Draco could be the one to open that new door?
Hm, it turned out that getting onto Harry Potter's nerves was still a hobby of his after all these years. Draco thought to himself joyfully.
One could only pray Hermione wouldn't turn into one of those coquettish, gossiping ladies. The image in itself was already a horrendous nightmare. Harry shivered.
Harry didn't understand a thing. He blinked, his brain felt dizzy and was threatening to shut down just from looking at the long list of food, yet he didn't understand a thing written there.
"As favourable as I found the position we are in right now, Potter, let's not stay here for any longer," Draco said, a teasing smile adorned his lips.
Sigh. If Harry used to get so worked up over anything the blond did back then, now all he was upset about was how he couldn't seem to bring those anger back to surface.
"Hm, I know that last time I said it was rude to stare, but...perhaps I could make you an exception. After all, I find your stare to be quite enjoyable, Potter." Draco's voice dropped low at the last part -- dangerously seductive to Harry's ears.
"Come on, shall we?" Draco cocked his head towards a French restaurant and offered an arm for Harry to hold onto. Like the gentleman he is, a voice inside Harry's head supplied. Harry rolled his eyes but placed a hand on his arm regardless.
"What makes you say that?" Harry scoffed, face not giving away any hint of what was happening inside -- heart pounding in panic as he chided himself over and over again for almost thinking he might've actually liked and wanted to see Malfoy smile in that way again.
"Likewise, Madame Lavergne," Draco said, inclining his head politely. The woman smiled at the show of courtesy and put an open palm on her cheek.
Harry stumbled upon his words as he caught himself staring again. "N-no, I g-guess...?" Draco's smirk grew wider.
The bell rang, someone opened the door for them instead, whilst the two men were busy arguing over who enters first. What a sentence.
"Yeah, right. But I changed my mind, no one could change that fast, Hermione! And last week, we only chatted for like, what, 20 minutes?"
The waitress walked away and Harry fell slumped on the table right away, his hand tangled in his hair in tight grips.
Laughing a deep chuckle that mesmerized a stilled Harry, Draco got up and pulled the shorter man with him and forced him to meet his eyes by a finger under the other's chin. "Well, we can't have your day all ruined like that, can we Potter?" A gleam swam in the depths of his eyes.
Fucking stomach and its growling tendency!  Harry swore in his mind as he flushed a maroon colour. How he wished the floor would magically open and swallow him whole.
He walked towards the fireplace and grabbed a handful of powder before bidding his goodbyes and saying, "Diagon Alley," in a clear voice.
Deciding that, yeah, maybe he wouldn't want to know whatever reason the ginger and brunette had, Harry shot his best friends one long sceptical look before taking another sip of tea and saw that the time of his date approached closer and closer.
"Do pull yourself together, Harry. After all, it's going to be only a few hours, if not one. You said it yourself."
"You're as easy to read as an open book. Anyone ever told you that before?" Draco smirked as he rested his chin on top of the back of his hands, not planning on taking his eyes off Harry at any moment.
Having to just recover his senses, Draco blinked and without missing a beat, he replied, "Mother once told me to enjoy the little things in life and I decide to take heed of that." A smirk appeared on his luscious lips when an indignant look crossed Harry's features.
Draco scoffed. "Don't get me started on Father, he'd disown me before I could even explain anything."
Just then, at the immensely appealing smell of the dishes settled on the table before him, the unwanted, the unforeseen, the damned-est thing happened.
Draco raised an eyebrow questioningly. "Potter?" He smirked, waving a slender hand to gain Harry's attention.
It felt like they were both the only occupants of this world, like everything surrounding them were nothing but painted sceneries. Inside, Harry panicked. No one and nothing ever made him experienced something like this before.
Harry's eyes widened when he finally came to a realisation that they seemed to land in a grass field, out of nowhere...or was it not?
"Malfoy-?" he cut himself off with a gasp as the blond in question took off his coat and pulled him flushed to his side. So close that their hips were touching against each other. A warm heat rose to Harry's cheeks.
Draco Malfoy, all dressed up in the fanciest, most stylish clothes money could afford, stood before him in the flesh after a couple of floo calls they exchanged in the past week.
A hand suddenly reached out to grab his from out of nowhere, yanking him towards the person's chest. Harry widened his eyes and whipped his head around to look at the person.
A voice, deep and clear, muttered low by his ear, "You should've seen yourself, Potter. Blushing, are we? My, my." Draco blew a hot breath on his ear. A shudder rolled throughout his body, Harry heard Draco smirk.
Harry waved his goodbye and speed-walked towards the entrance of a tall building that was his apartment.
Draco didn't wait around to hear the rest of what Harry had to say. He disapparated them both from the alley, not leaving any trace of them being there before behind.
They made their way to the house quick, as the rain became heavier by the second. And then, suddenly...
At that, a slight frown appeared on said Malfoy's face. "What for?" he asked, unsure what the other man was implying.
Draco stilled, remaining quiet as the hand gripping his spoon tightened. Soon, he regained himself fast enough for Harry to notice nothing. He chuckled and replied rather awkwardly, thanking the gods that the Gryffindor was oblivious as he was.
"I take it this is an invitation to invite me over to watch it with you? Sweet. Thank you, love." Harry stared at him appalled, taken aback by the response he received, and flushed a deep red.
Harry swallowed a gulp of saliva, ashamed he had been caught staring too long. He shifted his eyes to look at anything but the smirking Slytherin in front of him.
"Y-you wish!" was the instinctive response. Draco chuckled with a hint of amusement lacing his voice. He drew away from the red-faced man, giving Harry a chance to breathe and cool himself.
Without looking back, he replied, "Goodnight, Harry." And he soon reached the alley and vanished into thin air, leaving the black-haired man alone in the middle of the street with a dazed look on his face.
Draco, with the white handkerchief in hand, leaned alarmingly closer towards Harry. The black-haired man's poor heart was beating uncontrollably and blood rushed up to his face.
Draco arched a brow at him, waiting for a response. With which Harry answered with a mere, "Seems delicious."
The world seemed to stop as Draco brought his face close enough to be in Harry's personal space, and brought his hand, the one with the handkerchief, to wiped it along Harry's collar where the stain was at.
Harry looked down at his pouch and hugged it against him in the same fashion as a schoolgirl that was given a love letter.
Draco stayed silent for a moment before finally replying with a couldn't-care-less-you should've-been-more-careful type of tone, "Is that so? Want me to hunt him down for you, Potter?"
He had initially expected Draco to tease him about it like he probably would back then when they were still young teenagers.
Cold biting wind swept upon them, sending shivers through Harry's frame -- he felt cold, but couldn't care less at the moment. It seemed that all that mattered now in the world was the man in front of him, and himself.
Harry opened his mouth to ask and turned to Draco, who he saw had an unreadable look on his face. Heat crept up his neck. Just how long had he been staring?
Only by now having the realisation of not feeling the weight of his pouch in his pants, Harry blanched and began to panic. His thoughts drifted to when he was smacked into by a stranger in the busy street.
Just as he was about to call for Draco, he felt a familiar hand on his wrist pulling him towards the blond. Harry looked up and furrowed his eyebrows in question.
"Yeah? Try us," a smirk -- the one Ron often used back then when he plotted something against the Slytherins -- appeared on the redhead's lips.
The handsome young blond man was so dangerously close that Harry could feel his breath ghosting on the tip of his nose. Blood was pounding in his ears, the only thing loud enough for his ears to catch.
But then, as Harry was about to spew out the insults on the brink of his tongue. He found himself smiling instead. And they both laughed together in harmony, even if it was drowned out in the rain.
A sneer formed on Harry's lips, he then let out a small sigh before he decided to take a look at the menu as well.
Harry fought the urge to scoff. "That's because his business won't look good if he keeps being an arse to everyone," he mumbled.
Draco laughed, much to Harry's chagrin. "You shouldn't be. A Malfoy never lets others pay in their stead anyway."
Harry turned to take a step in the stone-tiled path, before finding himself restricted from making the move. Only then had he realise that the hand was still coiled around his lower back, unmoving, making him lean involuntarily close to the blond's lean frame.
"The total is 148.55 galleons, gentlemen," her voice echoed in Harry's head, though he quickly dug his hands into the pocket of his trousers when he saw Draco did just that.
If he had expected for Harry to go, "Oh heavens, Malfoy! I knew you had good taste! I'm impressed that you know French as well!" then he wasn't getting any of that, sorry to disappoint.
Yes, Malfoy, the git that had been tormenting him just because back in their school days. Rita Skeeter would be making millions of galleons from this. Who wouldn't want some juicy topics regarding the Saviour's love life?
At the sound of coins clanking, Harry knew Malfoy had paid the bill. Harry felt frustrated. Just how in the world did he not notice he had been pickpocketed.
He shifted his eyes to stare into the alley Draco had disappeared from and a warm look dawned on his face.
Harry blushed a light pink, finding that he didn't hate it as much when Malfoy teased him with the famous title that he had despised so much for all his life.
Oh, so this got to be one of the Malfoy estates? So much for a 142 IQ. And also, equipment? For what?
Just then, Draco finally leaned back graciously on his chair and placed down the green cloth by his wine glass.
Draco raised a hand, calling for a waiter. A ginger haired young woman dressed in navy blue approached their table with a notebook in hand.
Harry averted his gaze away, not standing to stare right at the knowing, amused, stormy depths of grey that were Draco's beautiful eyes.
Ron placed a hand on his shoulder and patted. With a grin, he merely said, "You won't like the answer." Hermione giggled into her palm, a sight that reminded Harry of Lavender and her group.
Harry was utterly speechless of what just happened. He raised a finger to his hot, blood-filled cheek, disguising it as though he was just brushing away a strand of his long bangs, skin burning hot beneath his fingertip.
Draco and Harry jumped, startled at the interruption. They locked eyes once more and a smile lifted Harry's lips.
Thoughts ran through his mind with the speed of the wind. The reason behind his distress, you may ask? He started to think that,
Draco almost staggered in surprise from where he was standing. A warm sensation burst inside of his chest, his heart fluttered against its ribcage and butterflies flew around in his stomach. All of that just from hearing the use of his given name.
The two sat down, Harry's face slightly tinted in pink from went Malfoy had pulled out a chair for him to sit on. Said git was smirking smugly from across the table as he pored over the menu's content.
The streets were packed with busy young wizards and witches, some shoving and elbowing their way. A man bumped into Harry, almost knocking him to the ground. With a spluttered apology the man quickly set off on his way, disappearing into the crowd once again.
Upon entering his living room, he made a dash towards the fireplace and made 'floo-calling Hermione and Ron' his first task.
A broad smile remained plastered on Harry's face as they walked their time away until the sun was no longer hung in the sky and a dark blue colour took place of its previous warm orange.
Time passed, Harry checked the expensive muggle watch his godfather insisted on buying him, and an hour had passed. Harry blinked. Well, time sure flies quickly when it's spent with the person you enjoy talki-
"Mother told me about it," as unconvincing as his voice sounded to his own ears, Harry bought it and proceeded with his meal. The man wouldn't notice someone robbing a house if it's happening in front of him.
"Even if I do, whatever it is can wait," Draco said as he all but dragged Harry by the hand out of the restaurant. A "Thanks for your visit and come again!" from Adrianne was not far behind them, and Harry looked back to return her smile, before trying to keep up with Draco's fast pace.
Chewing on his lips, Harry spoke slowly, "I...don't understand a thing." How embarrassing, now he felt rather stupid. Not that he wasn't If I do say so myself.
He might've seen wrong, but Harry could've sworn something close to a look of fondness flickered across the other's face for a second before it was back to its perfectly patented smirk.
Harry's eyes lit up with interest. His mind already supplying images of Draco riding a white horse with full gear on.
"I supposed I could clear some time off my very busy schedule for you, Malfoy," Harry teased, staring straight back at Draco's grey eyes, which darkened at the mention of him doing something exclusively for him, Draco Malfoy.
Draco smiled at his retreating back and bent down to gather his long forgotten, soaked and dirty coat.
He heard Draco tutted from across him, shaking his head at him. The blond took a handkerchief -- wait, people still use that? -- out of his breast pocket and what he did next almost landed Harry on a vacation to St Mungos.
The image lingered in Harry's mind for a few moments until he gained himself enough to snap out of it and turned bright red.
"Ahh!" Harry shouted, his foot tripping over a rock. He closed his eyes, bracing himself for the impact with the hard ground.
Draco would more than love to shower Harry with praises, however. But there would be time for that in the future, Draco was sure of it. He had to be.
A glass of steaming chocolate coloured beverage with whipped cream, marshmallows and sprinkles at the top was slid on the table until it was in front of Harry. His eyes gleamed instantly like a child being treated ice cream by their parents.
"Try not to spill any more drink on yourself in the future, Potter. I wouldn't always be by your side to wipe it for you." Harry wasn't sure if he even had any blood left to rush up to his face.
"Brilliant." Harry paused until he reeled from the building tension from the lack of response, he added, "This was not yet revealed to the public, but the Chudley Canon's playing against Caerphilly Catapults in a few months."
"My bad, Potter, it seems that this son of a bitch forgot to return your pouch," Draco smirked widely when Harry's eyes went wide as the realisation sank in.
"Really?" Hope bloomed on Harry's face, lightening up his whole visage. Draco blushed and coughed awkwardly.
"What, because I make time to take good care of myself? There's this thing called self-love, Potter. Ever heard of that?" Draco retorted. "I reckon not." Draco eyed his tousled mop of hair.
The blond directed his gaze away from the owlishly blinking pair of emerald eyes as he felt his heart jumping in joy and to hide the foolishly wide happy grin that threatened to break out on his face.
As if taking that as their cue, raindrops started to fell from sky-high like arrows pouring down a battlefield, drenching both Harry and Draco.
Staring with a mischievous gleam in his eyes, Draco smirked. "Then, off we go," he said with a light tone, panicking the shorter man even more.
"Just relax and do not bring up anything unsuitable to discuss in a date, and you'll have him taking you home." Harry nodded, although finding it not helpful at all at the moment.
"Oh, what pleasure it is to have you, gentlemen, here in my humble restaurant! It's such a delight to see you again, Mr Malfoy!" A blond woman cut them off, a French accent faint in her voice. She ushered them inside.
"U-uh... Goodnight, Draco!" Harry shouted, his cheeks painted red. The blond's first name felt so foreign on his tongue. Foreign yet right, it was.
He bit his lips and ducked his head in embarrassment for having such thoughts, hands still clutching at Draco's shirt tightly.
"Can't you guess?" asked Draco with a cough following as he quickly turned to look the other way, having caught himself looking for a moment too long.
It was then had only Harry noticed that Draco had grown into a fine young wizard who now resembled his father, Lucius, a lot. The blond man had grown out of his boyish, teenage features, his jawline was sharper and defined, cheekbones as high as it was elegant, his blond hair was no longer slicked back -- locks of luscious hair fell over his deep, stormy eyes.
Harry let out another yelp as he felt his feet giving out. He would've fallen flat on his arse on the ground hadn't the firm hand on his waist kept him in place, flushed against the solid frame of the blond Malfoy heir.
Seeing the now clean, spotless table up to her sanitary, she started to read out the bill and Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Harry shot him yet another half-hearted glare before it broke into a shy, boyish grin. "Yeah, why not. I don't quite detest the idea of that, do you, Malfoy?" he teased back.
Draco who caught a glimpse of that, smiled a smile of his own and bumped his shoulder lightly. "I could teach you if you want," he offered to Harry, his voice uncharacteristically -- that of a Malfoy's -- warm and gentle.
Clumsy as he was, he quickly settled the glass down onto the table, earning himself a splatter of the glass' content on his shirt.
Draco smiled. "Hot chocolate -- your favourite," he said, looking ever the proudest from remembering that little detail from all his staring at the Great Hall years ago.
A pair of strong arms wrapped around his torso for the second time that day, Harry fluttered his eyes open. Draco had caught him just in time. How come he was such a damsel in distress today? Harry had no idea.
She looked over at Harry, their eyes meeting each other. Harry tilted his head with a slight smile on his face, he returned her warm greeting, "Hello, my name's Harry," was what he said, introducing himself like a toddler on their first day in kindergarten.
"Shut up, I don't need to hear that," Harry said, his voice lacking its sharpness and came out more half-hearted than he wanted. His heart was beating like mad against his chest.
Harry and Draco’s relationship had taken a dramatic turn as well, though neither was entirely aware of it. Harry’s new cat, "Dragon", was accepted immediately and fawned over constantly. Dragon was very friendly toward all of the Gryffindors, except for Ron, whom he seemed to have it out for. The cat enjoyed stalking him, jumping out of nowhere to scare him, knocking over his chess pieces, and clawing at his bedposts. Ron was increasingly frustrated, especially when Dragon teamed up with Crookshanks to annoy him.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, deciding truth was the best way to go, “ Honestly, I was just trying to think of something to say. You’re the first person my age I’ve seen today. Are you going to Hogwarts too?”
Now Draco was furious, although truthfully he was mostly just embarrassed. “Potter, you git! Stop your laughing and get my foot out!” he shouted as he struggled in vain. He was seriously regretting that he had let Harry convince him to leave his wand in the hotel room.
I want to thank Merlioske and Yuvika for their wonderful work as betas with this chapter. Their ideas, patience, and encouragement helped get me through to the end. Their links will be at the bottom, as well as another note discussing this chapter in particular, as well as plans for the future.
“Dear me...of course, you are right...I apologize,” Miss Ames mumbled through hiccups and loud sniffles. Harry’s jaw nearly dropped as she wiped her face and returned to her desk without saying another word, avoiding their gazes entirely by staring at a fixed spot at her desk.
It seemed as if Harry was staring directly into his soul, and Draco struggled to keep eye contact. He refused to back down, and let the honesty and sincerity he felt show on his face. Surprise showed on Harry's face, and finally, he spoke.
“So?” Harry asked stubbornly, “Who cares about that? You aren’t your family or your father. I’m inviting you to come with us. Do you want to?”
Of course! Draco was so excited he could have jumped, though he stopped himself in time. He’d hoped that Kreacher would agree to help him, simply for the fact that he was a Black family member,  but he hadn’t thought about the fact that with Sirius in Azkaban, he was the only heir available, meaning that Kreacher would automatically serve him. Still, he had to be sure, “How do you feel about such an arrangement, Kreacher?”
“Apologies, Madam, of course,” he began, “I’ve found a hidden room in the castle. It can provide whoever summons it with anything they require.”
Suddenly, strong arms wrapped around him Draco from behind, encircling him in a familiar warmth and comfort.
Now that they were shopping together, Harry was extremely excited that he might finally have his first real friend, particularly one that Dudley wouldn’t be able to frighten. As they stood outside of Olivanders, Harry reflected that Draco was likely to be a good friend, if his current behavior was anything to go by.
,” he whispered. Umbridge was subsequently lifted into the air, turned over, and dropped once again on the stone floor.
Draco was silent for several moments, staring at Harry, seemingly thinking something over. Harry was starting to get uncomfortable when the blond asked hesitantly, “Harry, how long have you had those glasses?”
Now that he could move without risking a hit to the face, Harry surveyed the various styles and colors on the shelves. Looking at the shelves in amazement, he wondered why on earth people would want to wear glasses shaped like triangles, hexagons, or diamonds. Harry shook his head and continued looking, relieved when he found the standard rectangle and oval lenses.
Healer Edwards chuckled, “Essentially yes, but it’s more than that. Yes, they will protect your eyes from the sun, but you will also be able to see perfectly in the dark as well.”
Hours later, Draco started to wake, confused by the sound of voices nearby, one high-pitched and panicked, the other gruff and irritated.
Draco smiled, and Kreacher looked rather startled at the gesture, “You said that I am the next heir to the Black family line, didn’t you? It seems to me that if I helped him, and Sirius didn’t want to take responsibility for you or the Manor at Grimmauld Place, he wouldn’t have a problem with me taking things over and staying with you.”
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin as the shout echoed through the seemingly empty corridors. Once he was sure he could breathe properly again, crept down the hall to the alcove where the shout had come from. As quietly as he could, he pulled back the curtain. It was Harry Potter, nursing a bleeding hand and cursing under his breath.
Still feeling somewhat awkward, he looked again at Merlin, who had returned to the bench and was waiting patiently for Draco to sort through his thoughts.
Draco felt immense satisfaction as he watched Umbridge pitch forward. She landed on the floor face-first, and Draco couldn’t help but feel pleased that he had thought to ask the room for a stone floor this time. He was sure it hurt that much worse.
Harry looked up at the man and smiled as Healer Edwards said in a playfully stern voice, “Just remember, you are to come and see me every year so we can keep your eyes healthy. Understood?” Harry nodded, “Yessir”
As they turned into Horizon T.  Alley, Harry immediately spotted their destination. It was a standard brick building with nothing to distinguish it from the rest, except for the sign which read “
Healer Edwards was sitting at his desk working through a large stack of files when Harry knocked on the door. “Well,” Healer Edwards said, sounding slightly shocked, “that certainly was fast!”
McGonagall was so ecstatic that she began teaching the students Defense, as well as Transfiguration. Even the laziest students, Ron included, were scrambling to learn as much as they could before Umbridge returned.
Sirius thought it over as he headed for the mail slot, confirming its existence. He would have to return to his cell from time to time, but he knew the guards’ routines like the back of his hand. Now, instead of shifting into dog form, he would simply escape in here.
Harry made a mental note of the title, internally wincing when he realized he had been thinking “doctor” this entire time.
Harry smiled. Not only did Draco agree, but he seemed to be excited by the idea. Harry was extremely relieved to have someone around who would explain things properly. “Sounds like a plan,” Harry said, looking forward to getting to know his new friend.
They bid farewell to the forest and gave their gratitude to the Devas. Though the spirits of the forest did not show themselves, there was at that moment a gentle wind that whipped through the trees around them. The forest itself seemed to come alive with the chittering of all manner of creatures and the movement of the trees. All at once, both were overwhelmed as the Devas entered their minds, sharing emotions of joy, hope, and affection. The couple stood together, eyes closed, basking in the warmth they felt from the Devas.
Narcissa reached into her robe and pulled out a pouch filled with galleons and handed it to Draco. “This purse will automatically retrieve money from my personal vault. Get whatever you need for school, and whatever you feel you may need besides.”
“I can’t believe you fell for it,” he laughed. “What kind of Slytherin would give away a precious secret for nothing in return? You
Shaking his head softly, he returned to the sofa and waited, wondering if he would even get a response to something so ridiculous.
Curiosity broke through the sadness clouding Draco’s mind. After a moment, he was able to calm himself enough to shake his head no.
“Listen carefully, Draco,” Merlin commanded gently, “You do not bear the weight of your sins alone, nor should you suffer damnation for them.”
Harry chuckled, “No. I came here about a month ago; when I told you I was going on an extended investigation for the ministry?”
While Draco may have lived a lifetime, his mind was currently that of a child. He had to work for a few moments to restrain himself and control his anger at the judgment. The man had admitted his mistake, after all, and apologized. Besides, he recalled that his father’s and grandfather’s wand had both been made of yew, so he wasn't entirely wrong.
His mother responded by smiling gently, “That sounds wonderful. I was unable to accompany Draco today, and I think it would be beneficial to him if he were able to gather his school supplies with someone his own age. Unless your guardian would have a problem with that?” she said, looking pointedly at Hagrid, her tone practically daring him to respond negatively.
Draco had to fight to keep his face expressionless as an amused Harry Potter emerged. As it was, he couldn’t quite contain himself. “Potter!” he nearly shouted, before catching himself and hissing, “What in the bloody fuck….?! How did you…? What is that?”
As he approached, number 12 appeared in its dramatic way, shoving the neighboring houses aside. “Go inside and ask Kreacher to allow me entrance,” Draco whispered to the air next to him, “From what I understand, the house would allow me entrance because of my magic, but he’s been alone for six years. I don’t want to enter unannounced,” he paused, thinking he should probably warn Dobby. “Be careful, Dobby. The house is not in good condition, and Kreacher is a bit mad, but he needs to be treated with kindness. Explain to him that I am a Malfoy and that my mother is Narcissa Black. Hopefully, that will be enough for him to allow us in.”
Harry was silent for a few moments, and Draco was afraid he had offended the boy on accident, until he said quietly, “Yeah. I feel like I don’t know anything. I don’t even know what questions to ask.”
Harry was too overwhelmed by the concern his godfather had shown to say more. Instead, he got up and enveloped Sirius in a tight hug.
Harry and Draco take their first holiday together. Draco thinks it's just a hike, but Harry has something special in store. Tale of how two people found love through a legend of love and tragedy.
Harry seemed pleased with her reaction as well; he released the breath he had been holding and his shoulders relaxed. Harry shook his head and responded firmly, “Not at all. I wasn’t raised around wizards, and have never heard the Malfoy name before today. I don’t know what Hagrid was talking about, but Draco has been perfectly nice to me. I’ve invited him to come shopping with us,” the request for permission implied.
The grass below him was a soft carpet of the deepest green. Flowers of all shades and hues surrounded him, permeating the air with their sweet scents. He felt the cool, gentle breeze caress his cheek, bringing with it a symphony of birdsong, humming bees, and the bubbling of a nearby creek.
When Harry got to the seventh floor, he paced in front of the wall where the door would appear, thinking of a simple living room. He focused on making the room feel welcoming and neutral, as well as comfortable. He was satisfied when he entered a well-lit blue and grey coloured sitting room, with a warm fire in the fireplace, two comfortable looking sofas, and a coffee table between them.
Later, Harry would look back on today in awe of his good luck. He was so distracted by his thoughts of the evening ahead that he didn’t hear Snape’s instructions for their potions assignment. Fortunately, he was partnered with Hermione. Rather than scold him as she normally would have, Hermione did the potion on her own, telling Harry that she would take notes for him in their classes for the day, so long as he promised to study them and complete his homework on time for once.
Trigger Warning! Vivid descriptions of violence and injuries as well as physical and emotional child abuse.
Harry turned towards Draco and hesitated, feeling guilty about the prospect of the boy sitting in a waiting room for a long time with nothing to do. Draco seemed to read his mind and waved him off, “It won’t take long at all, Harry. I’ll be fine here.”
"You will look at me when I'm talking to you, baby Malfoy." his attacker hissed. "I know about your traitorous behaviour. We have you, and soon we will have Potter. All that's left to decide is whether to kill you or mark you as one of mine, allowing you to live with your guilt."
He couldn't help but scoff a little when he read the following words. Apparently, Malfoy had anticipated his reaction.
Feeling strangely calmed by Healer Edwards’ deep voice and easy manner, Harry nodded and relaxed back into the chair. Healer Edwards cast several spells on Harry’s eyes, making notes as he went along. Harry was immensely surprised when Healer Edwards moved on to his glasses after only ten minutes, casting several spells on them.
“Wait, how did you know what I was thinking?” Draco demanded, suddenly realizing this wasn’t the first time Merlin had answered his thoughts. A quick examination confirmed that his occlumency shields were still intact. Was Merlin simply that powerful of a legillimens?
That was two years ago. Harry hadn’t been to the eye-doctor since and his glasses were old, worn, and getting too small for his face. It didn’t help that Dudley’s favorite activity was seeing if he could punch Harry hard enough to break them. He couldn’t see properly, but well enough that no one raised any further concerns, so he had dealt with it as best he could.
Harry took off in a mad dash after Hagrid and was able to catch up to him rather easily. “Hagrid, wait!” Hagrid turned around, evidently startled by the urgency in Harry’s voice, “Alright there, Harry?”
After a few moments of feeling her embrace, hearing her voice, and smelling her perfume, Draco decided his father could promptly sod-off. He wrapped his arms around his mother and sobbed, basking in the warmth of her hand as she stroked his hair and allowing the sound of her gentle shushing to calm him naturally.
But even as his body and mind had healed, even as he remembered what it was to be free and safe, something was still missing.
Ever since Draco had begun to doubt the validity of his father's beliefs, his mask had threatened to slip. Today, maintaining his air of indifference was nearly impossible. As Draco prepared for the events to come, his fears bubbled just beneath the surface.
The cat jumped off of the sofa, transforming into Draco a moment later. He kept his eyes lowered to the floor, “I may have turned Umbridge into a toad?” he said slowly, his voice laced with guilt and came out as less of an admission and more of a question. It was obvious that he was expecting a thorough scolding from Harry.
Harry threw his hands up in frustration, giving in to his curiosity. He scribbled a reply without bothering to sign it and sent it off with Hedwig.
Not a single person thought about Umbridge returning the following Monday; the freedom was simply too good to waste. The only dark cloud was Filch, who was miserable without Umbridge ordering him to torment students. Of course, everyone found this funny and had a lot of fun ignoring the decrees right under Filch's nose.
“Something is missing.” Draco responded immediately, repeating his earlier thoughts. “I always pushed away the thought of a soulmate. I didn’t think I’d live through the war, so there was no point, but now…”  he paused, sighing softly, “there’s no reason not to now, with the war over. I may not even have a soulmate, but if there’s a chance… a match for me… I have to find out.”
She had wanted him to have an escape, from life or danger, whatever his needs may be. As he stood there with the letter, he couldn’t help the surge of anger that rushed through him like molten lava. If this place was as secluded as his mother said, they could have escaped the war and lived. Peter Pettigrew couldn’t have betrayed them. Tom wouldn’t have found them.
Even Draco had to admit to himself that this made a lot of sense. No one would think to notice if he was the one who was sent back. Of course, this didn’t stop him from glaring reproachfully at the other wizard.
to put it on the Marauders map, but the stupid thing just kept disappearing. It was the only glitch we ever had with the map."
Severus smirked in satisfaction when the knocking ceased. Obviously, whoever it was, lacked any sort of spine if they gave up that quickly. Must be some pathetic first year… or Longbottom.
Emerald eyes scanned the scene, desperately searching for the platinum hair and stormy grey eyes of the boy he loved. Relief swept over him as their eyes met.
“Pardon me,” came a familiar voice from behind him, “Surely you wouldn’t judge a young boy on the actions of his father? Here I thought Dumbledore would expect more tolerance from his staff.”
He stood in the doorway for several minutes, wondering where to start, when a spark in the corner of the room caught his eye.
Thanks for reading, I hope you like it, and I hope it was worth the wait, even a little! Love and Hugs!
This chapter is shorter than the previous one, but I thought it a good place to stop for Harry. I already had this one typed up and ready to go, but hopefully I'll be able to post the next one soon. Review, please!
Merlin sighed heavily. “Your guilt and fear… your certainty that this is what you deserve… it pains me greatly.” With sadness in his eyes, Merlin approached Draco, who remained motionless as Merlin placed his hands on his shoulders.
Later, Draco wouldn’t be sure how he had managed to make it to his bed, only that he had. By sheer force of will, he put one foot in front of the other. He continued to fade in and out of consciousness as blood dripped into his eyes, causing the world around him to be nothing but a haze of black and red. When he finally made it to his room, he collapsed on the floor.
"Argh! Padfoot! Gerroff!" Harry spluttered, trying his best to shield his face from the sheer amount of slobber coming from the dog's mouth. Sirius didn't seem inclined to listen, however, and continued his merciless attack. Harry burst out laughing, unable to contain himself.
That night, when they went to the Room, Draco had nearly cursed Harry at the idea of walking around on a leash. Harry had laughed furiously at the reaction before suggesting a simple glamour. Draco had ranted and pouted for nearly an hour afterwards before furiously agreeing that there was no other choice, but that Harry had “better not watch or laugh when the glamour was applied, or risk having his own bollocks hexed off.”
Also, just as a reminder, from here on out the chapters will switch between Draco and Harry's POV :)
The rage he had been controlling up to that point flared to an inferno at the mention of Harry’s name, “
Draco observed Umbridge cooly. Her eyes had gone steely with malice, and her mouth was twisted in a cruel grin. He suspected this might be her natural face, as it looked much more natural on her, compared to her usual wide-eyes and innocent smile routine.
Draco deflated slightly, having expected this reaction, and turned to walk away. He was surprised when Harry tugged on his robe to stop him and spoke in his defense, “Stop it, Hagrid; That’s rude. We talked in the store and he seems alright. I invited him to come shopping with us.”
“I understand, but I don’t think you have to worry,” Draco said, looking at Kreacher inquiringly, “if Sirius hated his home so much, do you think he would want to live there?”
Draco and Harry turned to look at Hagrid as well, “Uh...er…” he sighed, realizing he didn't have much of an option at  this point, “we’d be glad to take yer with us.”
Eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy jerked out of his thoughts, staring at his godfather for a moment before remembering what they had been talking about.
When Draco had calmed down, his mother gently grasped his chin and raised his eyes to meet hers. She wiped away the remainder of his tears and asked, “What happened, darling? Why are you so upset?”
The next day, a first-year, worried about her female cat, complained loudly that Dragon shouldn’t be allowed to roam the castle freely unless Harry got him neutered. Dragon snarled and yowled as though he'd understood, while Harry dropped to the floor laughing hysterically. Dragon had hissed at Harry before bolting, and Harry had continued laughing for a good 10 minutes before following his cat into the dorms. Everyone listed in confusion as the hissing and growling continued, followed by profuse apologies from Harry.
Rather than rising to the bait, Draco remained silent and sat next to Harry, who looked confused but said nothing. After a moment's thought, Draco reached out and swiftly but carefully pulled the injured hand into his own, leaning closer to get a better look. Startled, and not knowing what Draco intended, Harry started to pull away. This had been the wrong thing to do, as he let out a yelp of pain and promptly ceased struggling.
When Draco began to purr, Harry decided now was the time to mention the day’s events, “Umbridge was missing from class today,” he said nonchalantly. The purring immediately stopped. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about that, would you Draco?” He asked lightly, looking down at the cat, who now refused to look him in the eye, instead, looking back and forth between his paws and the toad on the carpet.
Draco stormed from the room, fury raging like fire through his soul. Severus was not going to get away with this.
With that, they began to make their way through Diagon Alley. Harry and Draco quickly decided to stick close behind Hagrid. It was much easier to navigate the crowded streets when everyone quickly moved aside as he passed. There wasn’t much conversation, as the street was now extremely crowded.
The theory was proven when relief flashed in Harry's eyes. He also noticed that despite this, Harry squared his shoulders, seeming to brace himself for something unpleasant,  “Harry Potter," he said stiffly, turning towards Draco's mother and holding out his hand, "nice to meet you.”
Harry dissolved into laughter once again, and Draco relaxed. He couldn’t find any malice in the other boys’ words. He had to admit that his parents would have been horrified at such an “unbecoming” use of language. He couldn’t help but smile a little as he watched Harry’s behaviour. He’d been petrified throughout the entire day, fearing rejection and worse. But for Harry to laugh so freely in front of him must mean something good. For the first time in a long time, Draco allowed himself to hope.
His face slammed against the stone, and he bit through his lip as the curse pierced its way through him. He felt as though he were being submerged in a lake of fire while knives, needles, and swords slashed their way through every inch of his body. He felt a surge of anger and worry through the bond through the agony before he lost consciousness.
Draco turned to Harry, who was looking at him rather than at the flowers. “What are they?” he whispered, feeling that if he talked too loudly, he would disturb this perfect moment.
“What you don’t realize, however,” he continued, “is that you were set on your path long before you had a choice. By the time you met Harry, you were set on the path others had set out for you; a path of greed, power, and darkness. This set you apart from Harry and sent you in different directions. If you chose a different path from the start, allowing you to befriend Harry as you desired while saving you from a lifetime of dark uncertainty… I believe it would have the power to change everything.”
Throughout the morning, it seemed as though the hits kept coming. As they walked, Hagrid constantly threw out words and phrases that made no sense to Harry. He was beginning to get frustrated. Not only was he extremely confused by this point, but he was also dying to explore this new and wonderful place. Hagrid, however, was focused entirely on his task of getting Harry school supplies and quickly ushered them from one place to another.
Harry observed Draco for the moment, wondering about his reaction. Based on what Harry had seen so far,  he wondered if Draco was not used to thanks, praise, or even basic kindness. Harry could definitely relate to that, and it would explain the difficulties Draco seemed to have when he was thanked or even smiled at.
“He has a stone in his pocket that I need to get from him somehow.  If he keeps it, bad things could happen. Can you retrieve it for me without him noticing?” Draco asked hopefully. Draco didn’t have his wand yet, and even if he did, he wasn’t sure he would be able to pull that off just yet. Kreacher thought it over for a moment and nodded, “Of course, Young Master. Kreacher will be retrieving the stone.” Before Draco could ask how he planned to do this, Kreacher vanished. Somewhat alarmed, Draco watched Hagrid and Harry as they walked, hoping the old elf wouldn’t do anything rash.
Harry touched his hand, noting the lack of pain. It was at this moment that he'd already made his decision. Both Malfoy's words and actions from the previous night showed that he was trying to take a different path.
After dabbing at the wound, Draco was just barely able to make out the lines seemingly carved into Harry's hand, although he couldn't read the words due to the blood still seeping from the wound. He had to struggle to keep his face impassive. The horror and anger he felt on Harry's behalf was nauseating. He wanted to be sick at the sight of it. Finally, he addressed his, for lack of a better word, patient.
Perplexed, Draco asked, “Why did you need to go after Hagrid for that? You could have just asked him later,” he hesitated a moment before adding, “Besides, Hagrid hasn’t really been the best at telling you what you need to know. He’d probably just have you glance at everything.”
"There we go!" Sirius shouted. "You've got to stop hiding away up here. I know you're still angry, and you have every right to be. I don't like that they've been trying to keep things from you, or how Dumbledore has handled a lot of things over the years, but you've got me pup. I'm on your side, no matter what."
They melted into the embrace. Tongues tangled together, hands wrapped in hair, and they pressed as close as they could get.
He gasped as he was yanked up and encircled by a pair of strong arms. Draco hugged him fiercely. Then he lifted Harry's gaze to meet his, "You listen to me, Harry Potter," he said softly, his grey eyes shining with an emotion Harry couldn't place, but took his breath away regardless, "I don't want to hear you say anything like that ever again."
Harry almost threw the book, thinking back to Riddle's Diary. Only the fact that the writing had stayed on the page, rather than disappearing, convinced him to continue.
Surely it couldn’t be healthy if what he’d felt was the result. It was enough to drive a person to an early grave. Draco shook his head in exasperation at his unintentional pun.
Although he was better prepared, the force of the resulting blow was still a shock. This time, his father had used his cane, striking him hard against the middle. While he could certainly remember such pain from his previous life, his eleven-year-old body was unaccustomed to it. Before now, his father had only ever slapped him in the face. Draco gripped his stomach as he struggled to breathe, hoping against hope that he wouldn’t be sick and make the situation worse than it already was.
Harry’s eyes widened as he saw the beautiful snowy white owl Hagrid had chosen for him. “She’s brilliant, Hagrid. Thank you!”
“So you’ve finished, have you?” he said with a smile as he began to stroke her fur. He still couldn’t get over how soft she was. Draco was grateful that his mother had been immediately accepting of her, and promised not to reveal her existence to his father. If his father found out… he couldn’t even bear to think of it.
“I’m afraid I don’t speak toad,” Draco laughed, “but I don’t think you’ll be making it to the exit anytime soon. Even if you could somehow reach the door, the toad is a rather slow animal.”
One day, he was contacted by a goblin named Snarlworth, requesting a meeting. Harry had been nervous, sure they were going to condemn him for destroying their bank. It was a huge relief when Snarlorth told him that they didn’t hold much of a grudge in this case, though they were miffed about the dragon.
When the man spotted the two boys in the doorway, he turned expectantly to the receptionist, shaking his head in bemusement when he saw the chaos that surrounded her. He approached Harry and Draco and introduced himself, “Hello boys, my name is Healer Edwards,”
“Well, I see they’ve been broken. Would you like to get them repaired? Or, if you prefer, we could look into getting you a new pair or getting your eyes fixed?”
As Harry lay in bed that night, he found himself wide-awake. He was completely drained, mentally and physically, but sleep just wouldn't come. Thoughts of his conversation with Malfoy kept replaying in his head. He felt slightly guilty for putting Malfoy off instead of answering him. He knew the other boy would worry about it until their next meeting, but he had been thoroughly exhausted and he still needed to consider the potential consequences with a clear head.
Draco had been ecstatic when they had arrived at a luxurious seaside resort in Costa Rica. He had been disappointed when Harry had told him that they would be staying here for the later part of their trip; they were only there to drop their luggage and their wands. Draco had protested heavily at that, but the Gryffindor had begged, pleaded, and cajoled until Draco had given in, and they’d apparated here.
Author’s Notes: Love to my readers and as always, major props to my beta PTwritesmore and all the loves to my Larks! Special thanks to Kaedmarie for her continuous help and support!
After a few moments, he sighed in defeat. It would have to wait until he got to the hotel. What else could go wrong?
Tilting his head in a manner that Draco was quickly beginning to refer to as his "thoughtful look", Kreacher stooped over and plucked a random pebble from the ground. As Draco watched, the pebble shifted in shape and color until it looked exactly like the Philosopher’s Stone. Draco wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference by looking.
“Go home Dobby,” Draco whispered. Dobby made a sound as though to protest, but Draco cut him off, “I know you want to be there, but you have to think about Kreacher. He’s going to be skittish, and you two didn’t get off to a good start. He’s a bit mad, but he’s still a house-elf. Now that he knows I’m a Black, he won’t harm me.”
Harry doubled over at Draco’s petulant stare, managing to choke out between his laughter, “Your….Hah hah…Your face! Oh, Merlin….You should see…..your face! And….Bloody fuck….Hah hah! Prim and proper….Malfoy….Never thought I’d hear….Hah Hah Hah!”
Exhausted from the events of the day, the pair drifted off to sleep together, comforted by each other’s presence.
Since that day four years ago, they no longer had to hide their relationship. They stood side-by-side, soul-mates and partners, regardless of any hardship they faced.
“Kreacher will serve Young Malfoy because Young Malfoy is the rightful heir, but also because Young Malfoy reminds Kreacher of his Master Regulus. Young Malfoy is kind to Kreacher.”
“You would return to July of 1991. Before you attended Hogwarts, and before you met Harry. You would be as you were at age eleven, though you would retain your knowledge and memories from your previous lifetime, as well as your time here.”
After 30 minutes, Dobby hadn’t returned and Draco was beginning to worry, pacing in front of the shattered steps. He was considering entering the house despite his earlier intentions, but his instincts told him this would be the best way to approach Kreacher, rather than just walking in unannounced.
When he awoke, he was being held upright by random death eaters. Harry was in front of Voldemort, his eyes trained on Draco. As he watched the air crackle with the force of Harry's magic, he sneered weakly at Voldemort, not caring about the blood in his mouth.
“You say he’s arrogant and a bully like his father, but that’s ridiculous! He never accepts praise without trying to argue, he avoids his fans and the press like a plague, and he STANDS UP for people who are being bullied! It’s the whole reason he wouldn’t be my friend! I was an arse, and he couldn’t stand it! He got on the quidditch team because I was bullying Longbottom and he flew after me to defend him! Most of the fights he gets into are because he’s defending someone else!”
Looking at Kreacher, an idea struck him, “would you be able to transfigure something and make it look exactly like that one?” Draco asked.
Draco nodded and swallowed, unbelievably nervous. After they’d become friends, Harry had revealed that Draco had been a "pompous git" when they’d first met. Harry had already been feeling stupid and ignorant at this point, and Draco had shot his mouth off. If Draco was honest with himself, he agreed that he had come on rather...strong.
When the world looked at Draco Malfoy, they saw what he wanted them to see; a mask of pure arrogance and disdain. It had been beaten into him as a child; Malfoys do not show emotion. Fear was a weakness; love and affection were pathetic and nonexistent.
Draco moved to her side, speaking in a rather harsh voice, “apologies, I’m afraid I lost my temper. I hadn’t intended to harm you physically. I had decided that the best revenge against you would be to turn you into the filthy, crawling animal that you are.” He took a breath and continued, “Unfortunately, you’ve overplayed your hand.”
Two weeks later, Harry wiped the sweat from his brow as he finished moving all of his belongings into the cabin his parents had built on the island. When he’d discovered it, he instantly chose it over the castle his ancestors had built. It was small, cosy and absolutely perfect.
Silver eyes, identical and yet so unlike his own, eyes glowing with murder, and a voice dripping with hatred as he confirmed Draco's worst fears.
Draco steeled his resolve; there was nothing to be done now but face his future, whatever it may hold. With that, he entered the great hall, attempting to glance discreetly at the Gryffindor table and failing miserably.
He had to admit the idea was enticing… he could change everything… erase all of his regrets… live a life he’d never dared to even dream of.  But still… “I don’t understand why you aren’t sending Harry? If he was the one who was meant to defeat Voldemort, surely he would be the best choice?”
He smiled as he made a beeline for the shower, excited to scrub away years of filth and despair. He still had a lot of questions, but those could wait until later.
The toad turned around and puffed up its body, looking like a bumpy balloon as it called loudly, “Quark!”
He began a low chant in parseltongue. Tom was rendered immobile until moments later, he began shrieking in horror and agony. The dark mark ripped itself from his skin, taking with it the results of his experimentation and violently reverting him to the 71-year-old man he would have been. Seconds later, he collapsed, his heart giving out.
“Why should I be?” Harry asked, “Yeah, you might have insulted Hagrid a little, but it was true,” laughing, Harry continued, “Besides, you cared enough to get angry on my part. That’s what’s important. Not to mention, everyone else acts weird when they meet me, except you.”
Harry shook his head as Hagrid walked away, but he wasn’t all that surprised. Hagrid seemed to favor leaving Harry to his own devices.
For the first time, perhaps in his entire life, Draco released his inner torments without reservation. It was as though a dam had finally broken within his heart, only instead of drowning and suffocating in the waves as he had before, he simply allowed himself to be carried along.
As soon as classes ended for the day, Harry caught Ron and Hermione in the corridor. “Hey, guys… Can we talk?”
Draco's defences were up immediately. His first instinct was, as always, to fire off the first insult he could think of. It was his natural reaction when faced with anger and scorn from the Gryffindor. Just as the words were on the edge of his lips, he paused. Harry was no longer even looking at him. His focus was once again on his injured hand. Harry never let down his guard when alone with Draco. Every other time they had met alone, he relentlessly tracked Draco at all times, looking like a predator ready to pounce. This time, though he had seemed as angry as ever, he had completely turned his attention. This caused Draco to pause, and remain silent. He wanted to see how Harry would respond, no doubt expecting to hear a taunt from his rival.
It was as if the words, both powerful and gentle, pierced through the abyss. In an instant, Draco was pulled from the void; dropped through time and space.
Draco sagged against the wall in relief, jumping away when he felt the grime and cobwebs beneath his robes. Brushing his robes furiously, he made a mental note to spend the entire day in the bath tomorrow. “Kreacher, I’m sorry, I know you don’t like Sirius, but this is really important.”
Looking to his left, an umbrella stand caught his eye and Draco wanted to vomit. Was that a troll leg it was made of? He shuddered and continued moving. Something was different about the house from the last time he had been there. Of course, it was disgusting, but he had the feeling something was missing. As he walked down the hallways, he spotted the enormous portrait of Walburga Black and realized it was her screams that were missing. Whenever he'd been here before he was with Granger or a Weasley, which set her off at random times. Draco supposed the difference was that he was pure-blood Black. The portrait had no reason to be disturbed. He sneered in disgust at the painting. He would have to find some way to tame the thing or remove it. Even if it was silent in his presence, he had no desire to deal with an insane pure-blood fanatic, especially one that was even more radical than his own father.
Taking a breath, Harry decided to tell the truth, “Well, we’re friends now right? And what kind of friend would let his friend roam around and fend for himself like that? We’ve already been getting along so well and everything, so I just thought… well you would be safe and…” He felt his face flush.
Olivander paused and said quietly, almost to himself, “Perhaps I have been going about this all wrong.”
“If I had just grown a bloody spine and broken away from my father!” His fists were now bruised and bloodied, but he took no notice.
Draco had expected this line of questioning and decided to risk it all and go for the full truth. But first, there was Harry's hand. "I'll explain everything to you, I give you my word. But first, your hand really needs to be seen to. I'll explain everything I do. This may take a while and you shouldn't have to be bleeding and in pain while we talk. Will you permit me to tend to it?"
Realization hit Draco like a stupefy to the chest. He pulled away from Harry and began to pace back and forth. He’d been so lost in the story, he'd completely missed it. Only those with true love in their hearts...but he and Harry...they hadn’t...he hadn't...true, he’d wanted to...he could never find the words. Draco paced faster, panic setting in.
Draco was lost in nothingness for a long time. He was only a sense of identity, floating through an unidentifiable emptiness.
When a howler had delivered its message, it tore itself up. This one had caught fire. Someone had to have cast Incendio, destroying the howler before it was finished.

“Since the beginning of the school year,” Harry answered quietly, “Over the summer… well… something happened, and Dumbledore decided I needed to learn.”  Meeting his eyes, Harry took a shuddering breath before continuing. “It’s terrible, Draco. Every week it feels like he’s ripping his way through my mind, tearing into my worst and most personal memories…” He trailed off.
And it was. What had started as a throbbing in his head was now only a dull ache. He stretched his muscles carefully, pleasantly surprised when the pain wasn’t nearly what he had expected.
Harry shifted nervously in his seat and lowered his eyes to the floor, “A couple of years,” Harry mumbled, “but it’s no big deal. I still see alright, and my family just...hasn’t had the time.”
Author’s Notes: Love to my readers and as always, major props to my beta PTwritesmore and all the loves to my Larks!
Hagrid looked away in embarrassment, “Er...yeah. Sorry about that Harry. I didn’t even think of it,” he mumbled. “But yeah...we can head over right now and so somethin’ about yer glasses.”
For the last year, they had kept their relationship a complete secret. It had quickly become a competition to see who could insult and prank more creatively and win their 'fights.'. No one saw the sparks of amusement and affection in their exchanges, or so he had thought.
Umbridge seemed to notice this. Her evil smile grew impossibly wider, and she continued, “Honestly, what else could he have done? Obviously, the shame of having a disgraceful, mudblood-loving blood-traitor was too much for a respectable man of society-”
Merlin approached him slowly, as though approaching a cornered animal. “No Draco,” he pleaded softly, “do not fear. You are not here to be punished.”
When he finally reached the shore, Harry fell to the ground in exhaustion, staring at the beam. Nothing happened. It just ebbed and flowed, like a thread of pure light. He checked the wards… there was no sign of any intruder, which meant this would have had to come from miles away. Even then… an attack should have been warded off… So what was this?
“Not at all. There are a lot of students that come from muggle families who’ve never heard of magic or anything involving Hogwarts. There’s no harm in it, most everyone catches up pretty quickly. I don't mean to make assumptions, but since you mentioned you were worried about being behind, does that mean your parents are muggles?"
Since the moment the snake was cursed into his arm, his world had been void of everything; sight, smell, sound, taste, and feeling, all dulled. What did it matter, when he was going to die anyway?
“In remembrance of the love that occurred here and the crime that was committed, the Devas turned this place into a sanctuary. It was originally just a part of the forest, a little oasis in a sea of trees. They merged the trees to form an impenetrable wall. The Bougainvillea, which symbolizes passion, liveliness, and life experience, were trained on either side of the wall and nurtured until the entryway was formed. Like I said before, it’s enchanted. Only those with true love in their hearts can even find this place, let alone enter it. Anyone else wouldn’t have been able to see the curtain and would have been compelled to turn around. The Devas still watch this place, using their magic to transform the area based on what they perceive the needs of the couple to be.”
“You… you’re not mad?” Draco said nervously. “Why aren’t you mad? Aren’t Gryffindor’s supposed to be all righteous and noble?”
Draco said nothing and waited, sure Harry would overcome his shock on his own. Several minutes passed this way, with the two staring at each other, saying nothing.
to think about that last thing Draco said, or why he was blushing. This was going to be interesting.
Six months had passed since the end of the war, and Harry Potter was at a complete loss of what to do with himself. Hogwarts would remain closed for the next year, and Ron and Hermione were in Australia for who knows how long, looking for Hermione’s parents.
“Well,” Harry began,” I knew Hagrid wouldn’t be up for all of that, and then I thought maybe just you and I could go. So I talked to Hagrid, and we’re on our own until you leave to meet your mum…” Harry paused, mortified to realize he had just assumed Draco would agree, “if that’s alright with you?” he asked nervously. Sure, Draco had agreed to go shopping with him, but that had been for school supplies, not spending an entire afternoon exploring.
"I'll talk as I work. It will help you focus on something besides the discomfort. As for what I'm going to do, it's fairly simple. I can't work any healing magic on it, nor would I if I could. I'm not trained for it. The bleeding has slowed down a fair bit since you've stopped touching it. I'll be able to clean it properly and apply the medicine to it. After which I just need to apply the gauze and wrap your hand. Alright?"
The pain threatened to overwhelm him, dragging him in and out of consciousness. He could only make out snatches of what his father said as he lay there crumpled on the floor.
Harry's POV in the Room of Requirement. Harry is in for some surprises, and how does Draco plan to deal with this mess?
My Darling; Those were the last words his mother had said to Draco before she died. Before he had a chance to control himself, a choked sob escaped his throat and tears began streaming down his face. Looking at Draco with alarm, his mother swept him into her arms. In between the waves of grief and relief at being held by her again, Draco reflected that he should not be behaving this way. His father had taught him that pure-blood wizards did not show weakness, and his 11-year-old self would not have shown such emotion.
Harry took a breath and stood, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. There was a teasing light in his eyes as he said, “Back to Potter now are we? And here I thought we were at least on a first-name basis.”
Arms encircled Draco once again, and Harry began to speak, “Once upon a time, there was a witch named Luciana, and a wizard named Nicolas. They were on different sides of a bitter war between two nations, but they loved each other desperately. They chose this place as their meeting spot, each vowing to visit every week. Months passed this way, and the war raged on. Thousands lost their lives, but the lovers continued meeting in secret, cherishing every second together. They had planned to flee together, but on the night they were to leave, tragedy struck.”
He approached the ornate door to his father’s study, unable to keep his hands from trembling as he knocked.
He looked inside, but all he could see were steps leading downwards. The thing apparently had an expansion spell on it. He was curious for a moment, then shrugged before stepping inside and descending the steps.
Stunned at the idea, Harry turned to Hagrid, “Is that something we could do?” he asked, hardly daring to hope.
Sirius sighed and continued, "Anyway, there's no door at first. You have to walk past the empty wall where it should be, thinking of what you want the room to become. In your case, with the lies, the prophet has been spreading and the way you are often treated at school, I figured you could use a place where no one can find you. The room can give you a place to sleep, a place to relax, or a place to vent if you need to."
Draco nodded, remembering his annoyance at the sudden absence, followed by surprise when Harry returned and suggested they take a holiday together.
Harry didn't hesitate to throw himself on the ground in front of Draco and pull him into a searing kiss. "Yes," he said as he broke away before kissing him again. "Yes, yes, yes," he said, kissing him again each time.
