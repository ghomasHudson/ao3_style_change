“Please, the game will be over in about two minutes.” Draco added, a smile playing on his lips while he did lizard blinks.
Sometimes, he would help McGonagall with lesson plans or try out spells with supervision. On rare occasions, he would be out late looking at the stars at an opening or in the court yard and the Old Coot would walk by. Dumbledore spoke in philosophy, and Draco spoke back in the same language. In a weird way, Draco enjoyed their mysterious conversations his best friends would tease him for.
This is an AU.
Especially with the papers after their divorce. It had immediately gone public, with an officiant telling a Prophet Reporter the moment she got the paperwork back. All the articles were about their divorce for at least one week. It alternated between Draco hurting Harry or Harry deciding he was too good for Draco. When, in reality, it was his own fault in the first place that he lost the love of his life.
"I am not naive!" He roared over the calm, patronising tone Harry used as if he believed he was getting through to Draco, "I've seen all the men and women around you. How they fall for all of your charms. The same ones that I stupidly fell for!"
It was dropped at Draco's hand which were in his lap. He recognised that scrawl anywhere. He expected it to be lines and lines, maybe paragraphs long because it was Harry. And he goes ambitious with everything he does. No; it was about a line and bit long.
I let out a quivering breathe. It jotled my body forwards one step. This place was the best sight to end this wretched life. The place he grew up, the place he was tortured, looking out into the fields he adored.
Draco’s face softened, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder after faltering because he wondered if he should or not, “Please forgive me in jumping to conclusions: my sincerest apologies Monsieur Harry, Monsieur Ronald.” Harry smiled and looked at Draco’s hand on his shoulder and blushed once more but for a different reason. Quickly, the boy moved his hand back to his side.
One glance at each other and they screamed at the top of their lungs, Harry reaching over to turn the wheel to the side, because Ron was motionless as he yelped. Foot stomped on the pedal, Harry’s moving of the wheel made them spin and spin and spin. It was minutes later- that felt like hours- it stopped, Ron’s foot going off while they bobbed in the sky on cloud level.
Six months later...
“You will never believe what your sons did this morning.” Commented Molly, dropping the apron she had wrapped around herself. “Your sons flew that car of yours to Surrey and back last night.” Her voice was scrutinising as her harsh gaze looked between the twins and a red Ron.
But that wasn't being sent until I had... jumped. I don't know how to cope. Everything is always flying in the head, whizzing around, destroying what little happy thoughts I had left. Self-depricat is what people would call me. But everything I've said about myself is true! I'm lanky, too skinny, my hair looks white, my eyes are dull, my skin is too white.
When the final note was sung, they both took deep breathes but remained looking the other in the eyes. Green gladly invaded Draco's sight. Grey graced Harry's line of vision. "Harry!" He blurted out before he could stop himself and became all embarrassed that Draco chuckled.
"Need a hug?" His voice leaking sarcasm from the corners of his mouth. "I won't call you; I'll be far too busy. Don't have time. Right," the blonde sighed standing up shoving his hands and pack of cigarettes in his pockets, "I'm going to the bathroom, wherever the bathroom is."
"To all your fans out there, I'm pretty sure they're curious who you're talking about." The radio host prompted.
"But you don't even know-"
"Pillow-fort Potter, care to join?" Turning around, Draco saw the hints of a smile tugging the corners of Potter's lips and Potter saw how flushed and askew Draco was. "C'mon." He encouraged, "Would you feel more comfortable of I ordered you to help?" A nod, once down and once up. "Potter, I order you to help me build a Pillow Fort."
Other times in the castle, he would be on the Quidditch field getting pointers from McGonagall he was surprised to learn was on the Gryffindor in her time at school. She was also a Chasers; the position he was after. Draco knew he couldn’t beat Angelina Johnson or Katie Bell. Just as long as he beat Alicia Spinnet it would be fine.
"I love you. I fell in love with you and I still do Draco. And I took it for granted. I always thought you'd be there, that I could come home at any time and dinner would be on the table, I could cuddle you in bed. But I was wrong, I was so, so wrong love.
Since his mother had secretly set up a different account and was slowly transferring money into it, Draco didn’t feel anything was much different minus going back to that loveless house his mother tried calling a home.
“Ready mate?” Asked Ron and Harry nodded, so impatient he was tempted to not reply. Yes Harry knew it had only been a week, but he missed Draco dearly that he just wanted to hug him. In addition, Harry did miss the other Gryffindor boys’ and possibly Hermione (who he only talked to for Draco’s sake also).
And Harry didn't regret his decision as he sat in the stands with the rest of Gryffindor House. Immediately after the Snitch was released, Harry's eyes locked on the glowing ball to realise Draco was already racing after it. "The new addition to this mock Quidditch team Draco Malfoy- incredibly attractive, no homo-" Harry had a pit in his stomach churn at the compliment.
"She's incredible." Laughed Su, swinging back on the bench then pulling herself back right using her hands on the edge of the table.
Those were words Draco never expected to hear. At the moment, their relationship was rocky, because of Harry's recent promotion to Head Auror. But Draco thought he knew Harry loved him, loved him at least enough to not to that!
"Nope!" He popped the p to be specifically irritating.
Not once has Harry gone on a date, had sex, looked at someone else romantically or sexually, or been himself since that divorce. People would call what Harry did a mid-life crisis, but he calls it the worst mistake he will ever make in his life.
"THREE!"
Harry noticed the blonde blush at that, and Harry's thought was
And us doing that, requires trust. The first step to that..." the blonde took the deepest breath ever, "You can roam freely about the Manor, but no going in the East Wing: that place will always and forever be, off limits. And yes, you can go into any room you please. That includes my bedroom, my study, my personal library or even the kitchens." He knew how much Potter enjoyed the company of House Elves, "Now, it's time for you to show you're willing to trust me." Never had Draco said anything so softly to anyone before.
" They stared at each other, eyes-wide. Turning around, they came face-to-face with Lily Potter. She was in an amazing green dress with a transparent piece of fabric behind her shoulders. Cool, blue earrings in her ears and the same colour for a necklace and a bedazzled belt.
“I’ll be sitting in my room quietly, pretending that I don’t exist.” Everything about his tone was sarcastic, but they seemed too thick to pick up on that.
The other boy chuckled, “Have to agree with you there.”
"Incredibly defensive for someone claiming to not like a certain someone mate." He said and sat next to Hermione. "He's an alright bloke anyways. Nof'ing I'd think from a Malfoy."
"Just stay away from Hermione, yeah?" Ron still smiled at him but Harry could hear the underling of jealousy.
In the image, they looked so young, even if it was only a few years ago. Their smiles so bright, hands clasped together in a tight grip, eyes squinting they were so happy being next to each other. Laughing to himself again, Draco remembered how many times it took for them to get it right- more realistically, how many times it took Harry to get the timer correct.
“About a minute since you last asked.” Ron grinned, taking pleasure in his friend’s nervousness because that was the only fun he’d be having in those dress robes. The clearing of a throat brought Harry out of his thoughts. He looked up the stairs to see Draco. Dark, royal blue robes flowed to his knees, a silver belt holding black dress-trousers tightly to his thin waste. His lighter shade of azure shirt. Leather brown boots with golden spirals at the top were tucked into the tight trousers. Like an angel from heaven, Draco descended the stairs, his eyes sparkled and smile grew contagious.
at me, and being- being
The caption read, his face lighting up in a smile at the love hearts coming after it.
“Mr and Mrs Malfoy! What are you doing here?” A man with a monocle, grey hair and a brown suite appeared from behind a counter into Harry’s view. His eyes narrowed when he heard their names, but didn’t move as he feared to be spotted.
When they pulled back, Harry sighed in a dream-like state, "I did."
Narcissa- dressed in an elegant red dress with a long, flowing, silk black scarf around her neck and a medium sized black bag on her shoulder- rolled her eyes and hit Draco lightly on the chest with the MP3. "Honestly, it isn't that bad! They're all around your age, so you have nothing to worry about!" She sighed and dragged Draco to his feet. Defeated, he sadly smiled at her and allowed himself to be dragged. "Your father and I have that date, so you agreed to go to the party. And here, take my jacket"
He continued, "As ever, I would like to remind you that the Forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year,"
"It's here Hannah. It says 'it is the Victorian flower meaning preference'. So, the person has a preference for only you then." She wriggled her eyebrows which Draco did laugh at.
“Malfoy, Draco!" McGonagall called and Draco elegantly walked up the step to confidently sit on the seat. It definitely took a long time (pushing five minutes) until the hat called a house. "GRYFFINDOR!" He smiled brighter than Harry had ever seen. Out of everyone, Harry clapped and whooped the loudest, excitedly pointing to a free seat beside himself.
"Boy-Who-Cheated! Golden Boy, not so golden anymore!" Another voice shouted- his secretary- and that voice belonging to Ernie MacMillan. They chucked them around, laughing and grinning together.
"Also: there was talk of another album circulating, but apparently, you've turned it down?" Harry reached his house but, he stayed seated in the car listening to the radio wasting a lot of diesel as he did- this better be worth the £100 I'll spend later Malfoy Harry mentally scolded.
People say that was the turning point for the Dark Lord's win. Draco believes it was Dumbledore’s problem.
"I want a divorce." Said Harry, looking to the side of Draco's face. For the past six months, he believed he and Draco were growing apart and that Draco didn't love him anymore because they would never talk (not once did it occur to Harry that the blonde had tried, but the man was too busy). With those words, the stretch out silence began. It was when he heard the shaky breath his... well, ex-husband let out did he see the three tears go down that perfect face. One after another, Harry felt the urge to wipe them away but refrained, because he was the one asking for a divorce.
"She's all yours, mate." He put his hands up. Opposite them, Dean was asleep while Seamus tried throwing Berty Botts into his mouth (five out of ten isn't that bad a score).
"Nice seeing you, Granger, Weaselbee. Say your tara's to each other, especially that one." He pointed a dainty finger to Granger. Just now, he noticed the tears streaming down her face, a constant flow for sorrow. How it pained him to even say the word 'mudblood' and 'blood-traitor' now. "Potter, you're coming with me." Sticking his nose in the air, Draco beckoned for Potter to follow him. Obviously, knowing he couldn't. "Pathetic." He sneered, walking up to Potter and pinching his ridiculously dirty clothes between two clean fingers. "I'll be seeing you: possibly not you, though." His final jab at Granger (however much he didn't want to do it), he was off. Whizzing away to Malfoy Manor with Potter pinched between his fingers.
Draco sighed, slipping the jacket over his slim shoulders: his build very slim and some would say feminine. Then, his father walked into the room dressed in one of his finest suites. "She spent an hour sorting through your clothes, we really need to go shopping sometime, Draco."
"That's it Harr!" His did whooped and Harry brightly smiled at him- they were practically the same height.
"Fuck." He huffed, taking a deep breath and relaxing his body against the wall in the hallway (he managed to get through the door!). "You'll have to go on my sofa. There's no way I can get you to the living room."
After taking a deep, needed breathe Harry pushed the boys' bathroom door open with one hand to be assaulted by the lung-filling smell of nicotine and the blinding view of smoke upon smoke.
Lying on a sofa god knows where (Draco really couldn't care less where he was at the moment), Draco lounged about with his earphones in, eyes closed and contently listening to
"Oh, my Walkman?" Draco smiled. "It plays music on the cassette in the middle." (Draco opened it up, pulling out the 'cassette') "that then plays through these" (he tapped the headphones with his index finger) "do you... wanna hear?"
"What are you going to do with the Blood-Traitor and Mudblood?"
The sorting was finished: Draco knew because the clapping had died and the chatter had risen. Tired of walking in a straight line back and forth and back and forth, Draco sat on a bench bobbing his leg- a habit he scolded Harry for.
Molly’s brow frowned in worry at the amount she would have to spend. “No worries boys, we’ll get you them.” Her and Arthur didn’t look able to afford them and Harry suddenly felt extremely guilty. But the look in Draco’s eyes was telling him it’s not your fault while an arm snaked around his shoulders for comfort. He hummed, resting into Draco a fifth time for that day.
Harry sat there, in tears as he watched Draco run out the door possibly to the bathroom. All Harry wanted to do was comfort him. To hold the blonde in his arms, kiss his cheek and temple, whispering sweet nothings in his ear to calm him down. But he lost that privilege.
There was a lot to work through with Potter, but they'd get there. Eventually.
"Permission to speak, master?"
"DINGLEHOPPER!" Terry and Justin shouted him, cupping their hands around their mouths. Jumping, Draco swore he was going to strangle them both when he heard the Gryffindors begin to laugh. Glaring, red-faced and now moody, Draco shot a look at the Gryffindors that shut them all up before flipping the other direction and smiling brightly at his friends.
“Please stop!” He whined once more. The woman smoothed out his hair and cupped his face, “You’ve grown so much darling, you will certainly turn out to be such a wonderful man.”
Yesterday was a very energy consuming day, with the rescue mission at about two in the morning, then the Weasley household, his emotions for Draco (he still needed to figure that one out) and so much more. Percy smiled, shaking his head in amusement.
"You showed me feelings I've never felt before. As a kid I wasn't shown love, compassion, empathy. You taught me those things Potter. But you also taught me hurt, emotional hurt. That loving someone can be saint-like, but almost as terrifying as knocking on Devil’s door... and he answers. You were my forbidden fruit, but I just couldn't keep away from you.
This time, the silence was deafening. "I-er, I could get you a book to read, if you want? I'm not exactly allowed muggle entertainment." He could read Harry's thought even if he didn't say it, "Yes, I know about Televisions and Gameboy’s, thank you very much." That earned a half-smile from Potter, and he took that as a victory.
Thankfully, Fred let go of the wheel for a second letting the car hover in position. With the added help, Harry was pulled through the door and then it was closed behind him. Behind him, he could hear Vernon shouting and Petunia’s high-pitched scream as the man fell into the bushes.
At lunch, Abbott ran to the Slytherin table, throwing the book at Draco who managed to catch it, putting a hand on the floor to balance himself. "Quite the throw on you Abbott." He sneered.
"Where?" Asked Ron, scandalised.
“Can somebody tell me the name of a curse?” His magical eye and normal eye scanned the room, his face got harder when they landed on Draco. Moody asked Ron, who replied with the Imperious Curse. The spider flew around the classroom, landing on unsuspecting victims making Ron whimper and Parkinson shriek when it landed on her face. “Mister Longbottom?” Neville stuttered his reply and the class grew quiet. “Crucio!” Moody said, his wand directly on the spider. Neville had to look away when it happened, even the Slytherin’s flinched or cringed. Draco’s hands grew clammy, them shaking slightly under the desk as he recalls when Lucius used it on him while his mother was away. “Stop it!” he shouted, “Can’t you see it’s bothering us? Stop it!” He stayed standing even when the teacher turned to him.
It was Dumbledore’s funeral and Snape killed the man. Crabbe and Goyle fixed the Cabinet and Zabini was made to kill him. But couldn't do it, didn't even make it up the stairs before running and hiding. Snape cast the spell and fled with Crabbe, Goyle and the Death Eaters the two let in.
“It-er... it’s me... I must've called a thousand times but, erm- you’ve... never picked up.” His voice was so smooth and so soft and so easy compared to the last he heard it. Before, it was spewing hot lava that loved to burn Draco to the core. Before it was also so cold, he wished he had fifty jumpers on, instead it froze him. But before, it was also like the perfect mattress you’ve had for years and could never think of getting rid of. Because many good (and bad) things had happened with that mattress in your life.
Harry screamed in his head, pulling Draco's pillow close to his chest as he cried into it that night. The next night, and the next.
"Told you he'd take it well." Hermione sighed.
"Look! Right..." her hand scanned the lines until she reached one with the quote she was looking for, but Li found it first.
"It isn’t his fault he can’t see well, and has no sense of direction...” George looked to his brother then back at Percy.
It all spiralled from that. There was a period of ignoring Harry, insulting Harry, a fight with Harry, and then making up with Harry. Never did Dumbledore bring up the task he asked of Harry and Harry forgot all about it.
“There is no excuse, because I should have been there: for you, for Rose, for Teddy. I’d really love to be yours again. Just-
"Ronald has a good heart. He can be incredibly funny." Observed Luna.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Could a fifteen-year-old be anymore childish? Arguing with their little sister about a sport.
was left unsaid. Because the statement wasn’t true. Harry didn’t
"Go ask Hermione!" Muffled Ron into his pillow. Within seconds, the door was slammed shut and the five boys relaxed in their beds. "It is six am." Ron groaned.
"Word is, that you're moving out of state." Harry saw the anger, hurt and sadness in his friend's eyes that Harry had not told him himself. "As soon as you graduated after Prom that is."
“Ahh, fascinating.” Arthur went to ask another question, but before he could, Molly came back into the room carrying seven envelopes.
"Harry mate, you can't already have a crush on the guy!" Exclaimed Ron when they entered the carriage.
calling him
“Right dearie, step into the fireplace, throw the powder at the floor, and day Diagon Alley! You have to pronounce it clearly though dear.” Molly instructed and Harry nodded along taking in the information. Just as he reached for the powder, Draco interfered and went before him to show him what and how to do it. And Harry, somehow, messed up saying two simple words of ‘Diagon’ and ‘Alley’ together.
"Wicked!" Ron smiled brightly.
"Yep." He lent his head against Draco's, laughing at how absolutely absurd this was.
That endless stream of worry had disappeared that same night Har-
Beauxbatons was hard on Draco, due to the friends he made there. His closest friend that treated him like a little brother was Fleur Delacour, who is in her final year at school now. Already, Draco missed the elegance of Beauxbatons, the grace of the women and gentleness of the men. Looking about the train station, Draco didn't see anything posed, elegant or charming in sight.
The entire trip, they got to know Draco and he got to know them. Although Draco already knew about the houses and what houses they were in (thanks to Sirius of course), he listened with rapped attention. "We'll hopefully see you in Gryffindor!" Exclaimed Hermione, already hugging Draco as the train pulled to a stop.
Deeply sighing, Draco entered the train to find an empty compartment to read in content silence.
"What problem?" Harry acted innocent, but some part inside his mind was telling him how wrong this was. So far, Harry had been really good at ignoring his mind, so he did just that.
"Is it?"
And it went on, and on, and on. Forget the life destroying, home wrecking pamphlet, it came closer to a novella. Shrinking to his knees, Draco sobbed and sobbed on the floor, using half the pamphlet and his arm as tissue- coving the part where Harry has the audacity to apologise (in such a formal way he's disgusted for even loving the man). Staggering to his feet, Draco wobbled and slumped into his steps as he walked into the- his bedroom.
“Mister Malfoy, I must recommend you go in the hall this instant and wait in there.” McGonagall told him, filing through the first years as they went.
“We’re happy to oblige mum.” Fred said, running up the steps with George just behind him. They heard the tap running and then a scream from the bedroom. Draco prayed that whatever they did didn’t destroy any of his stuff.
At Hogwarts, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Professor Flitwick stayed at the school together. In his opinion, if Snape was there instead of Dumbledore then he would love it a lot more. Normally, he would be found in the library reading through its extensive collection of books. Some of which he had read previously at the Manor: ‘Defeating The Dark Lord’, ‘Boy Who Lived Biography’, ‘Dark Arts 101’, ‘Secrets to Potions: advanced’, etc.
"I suppose, you are wondering why I called you to my office month before our lessons?" Harry didn't verbally reply, but nodded his head and stood in front of the desk. "You need, to make Mister Malfoy fall in love with you, before Christmas break." There a debate, a very long and heated debate (more one sided heated wise), until Dumbledore convinced Harry it was for the Greater Good.
"Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight." She continued, "Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join
And the year hadn't even started yet. New record: Harry patted himself on the back. They were on the train and Harry knew she was bound to come up to him at some point. He had owled her over the holidays of fifth year from his living room basically saying 'we need to break up.'
“Get ready to face Malfoy mate.” Fred continued and got out of the way so Harry could hold Hedwig’s cage.
There was a reason for this: the word was banned. All of his school supplies had been carelessly thrown in the cupboard under the stairs. A plus side to his home life was that he was moved bedrooms, to Dudley’s second one. In his room were all of Dudley’s broken toys, a small single bed that was more like a toddler’s cot, a chest of draws, a wardrobe and a bedside table with a lamp Harry had to fix.
"Calm down, Mr. Hero." Draco told him, "Dumbledore is probably going to put an age range." Terry frowned making Draco smile more. "Someone our age knows more magic than someone aged fourteen for example. It's a logical thing to do."
"You're JOKING" Exclaimed Justin from across the hall. He has always been an awkward person with a hidden bubbly and exaggerated personality.
Harry could barely look up from his palms as he sat through that funeral service. He helped carry the casket to the stand it was on, so he saw all the roses people had brought with him.
"Imperturbed!" He confidently said. The blonde boy stepped in front of the Thestrals, throwing up the Imperturbable Charm creating an invisible barrier around them.
Finally, the train came to a stop blowing its high-pitched whistle. Everybody scrambled off: everyone in the compartment somehow staying together.
"Draco!" He yelled back over the noise and they shook hands. Harry's hands didn't feel anything like the ones that touched him before.
"I'll see you at Kings cross soon, my love." He kissed his two fingers, touching them to the gravestone and looking at all the flowers there. From Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Daphne, Dean, Neville, Ron, Hermione, and the most by himself.
When the puddings, too, had been demolished and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.
"It would be wise, for you to step forwards. Join us!" Nobody moved at all.
side. Because that's what Draco was now- in a cage; in a rut; whatever you wanted to call it. Several padlocks scattered on the steel door, also being heavily layered with locking charms to keep him from, from breaking beyond repair.
He tried, God he tried, so, so hard not to cry when Harry asked for that divorce. He willed his walls back into place, but they couldn't hold back a few tears going down his fragile face. Why wasn't he enough?
In the Great Hall, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang had their own seating on wooden benches (which Draco thought the girls would complain about). At the Gryffindor table, Harry and Draco were sat side-by-side with Hermione and Ron opposite them.  "And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!" The blue flames grew red and a piece of parchment drifted from the Goblet, "The Durmstrang Champion, Victor Krum!" And nobody was surprised, "The Champion from Beauxbatons is... Fleur Delacour!" Draco cheered loudly for his friend, "The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory." Draco had no clue who that was, but politely clapped still.
"Hello, darling." That voice. Harry's glowing tears flowed down his face he smiled and flung his arms around Draco.
"Draco, calm down." Laughed Harry, shoulders pushing together so he can stand next to Draco.
He stood, turning to Harry and lightly flicked his wand so all his clothes were swiftly packing in suitcases, "And when the time comes, explain to the children the pain. The utter embarrassment you put their father through." He raised his voice, "When will you learn that they are your legacy? That we" he gestured to himself this time, "Are your legacy."
Draco rolled his eyes. Hours of sitting in that seat awaiting for the train to arrive with Potter constantly asking him questions, uselessly flirting with him. Merlin, did Potter even like boys!?
Were the last sentences he jotted down when a light decided to consume his vision. Instinctively, he put his hand up to cover his face but it was soon being used to lift him off the seat. "Please no, no, my book! I can't sing, really, I'm being honest!" Panicked the boy, especially because he was feeling hands push him by the waist- his
If was their eighth year when Draco decided he needed to change. He ignored all his father’s letters, sold the manner after his mother died only a month after the war. During the time from the Battle to Hogwarts, Potter helped him with his trail and they settled some of their differences thanks to a dinner after it was decided Draco was innocent.
“Same here, thought the ugly guy had you there Harry.” George looked at Harry with a playful tone to his voice.
Leaving the compartment, Harry couldn’t stop the smile on his face and he dreamily sighed when off the train. The birds chirped higher, leaves were a brighter green and the trees danced to the tune of nature. Hermione’s nose was stuck back in the book. She murmured a phrase, but French didn’t sound the same. “What do you make of Draco then?” She asked, snapping Harry from his thoughts, “Ron?” She supplied, suppressing a giggle as she looked at a flustered Harry.
He didn't fight: he didn't want to. His father died rather close to his mother. Narcissa, by defending Draco's actions from not killing Dumbledore ('he's just a boy!' She protested'), was eaten by Nagini. And the remaining Malfoy's had to sit. And had to watch. And had to stare as she was eaten, limb from limb.
“You too Ronald, he’s going to kill you.” George turned to Harry, “He’ll probably slap you then kiss you.”
Taking a lot of blankets and two of the three duvets, Draco was doing stuff with them and Potter had no idea what. "Per-permission to sp-speak, Sir?" Oh, Draco
. He leant forwards, attaching his lips to Malfoy's and there was a spark. There was something in that kiss unlike the one with Cho that made him feel
"On my waist Mr. Weasley." She said harshly. A wolf-whistle came from Draco when he did and then the two danced. Professionally, from McGonagall, not so from Ron. "Now pair up! We are down two girls, so a pair of boys will have to practice." Draco and Harry somehow found their way quickly to the other.
They all flew off in directions to port keys to then land at The Burrow. Harry was shaking when he arrived before Draco did. When everyone arrived before Draco and Tonks did. "They're here!" Shouted Ginny from the window. Without a second thought, Harry ran outside and lounged himself in Draco's arms. He was close to tears and shaking as he inhaled that familiar, safe cent.
"SETTLE DOWN!" Came the voice of Albus Dumbledore at a volume Madam Maxine could never reach. "This year sees changes!" He stood up and walked to the stand, "This year, Hogwarts shall host the Tri-Wizard Tournament!" Once the excitement settled, Dumbledore continued, "Two schools will be coming to participate: Durmstrang Institute from Northern Europe, and-" Dumbledore's eyes moved to Draco and smiled warmly at the young boy, "Beauxbatons Academy of Magic from France!" If Draco's excitement peeked when he was sorted into Gryffindor, it exceeded Mount. Everest hearing the news.
Terry and Justin slowly made their way into the carriage, believing Draco could handle it himself. As careful as cradling a broken bird, Draco stroked their head feeling his smooth palm in contrast to the rougher skin.
"Erm, Potter. If you don't mind me asking, why are you here?" Terry inquired. Next to him, Justin shuffled unable to keep still.
Down in the closest, most frequently family-used living room, Draco put on the record-player and snapped his fingers, a House-Elf immediately popping in. "Yes?" The elf said, who was named Acidy-
He looked at Harry's ring finger, seeing the radiant, gold ring bounce water off the top. He was wearing the ring...
Being back home, Draco wondered why he ever left. In England he had everything he desired: freinds, his parents, his brother, his music, and Harry. Through out his return, Draco and Harry grew closer and closer. They would be seen out in public at cafe's, restaurants, cinema's, and more.
“Dobby, sir. Dobby the House-elf.” His voice was high pitched, and his eyes were golf balls with deep brown centres. His small, skinny body was covered with a potato sack and his ears were so much like bat wings Harry wouldn’t be surprising if the ‘house-elf’ (or whatever it was named) flew off.
“Where’s the train though?” Asked Ron. He was looking over the wheel better than Harry could as his head just surpassed the dash board. Harry said something similar... until the chugging grew louder, air surrounding them became murkier and the car shook from the pressure of the rails.
“Your point, Potter?”
Shaking, I stood at the top of Malfoy Manor. I had to, there was no other way out, but down. I had to, he had to, he had to.
with them.
Sheepish, Harry hung his head in shame. Draco rolled his eyes, but- of course- Harry didn't see it."
"Due to this, classes may be cancelled, and class sizes will increase for fifth years and above."
It's Gryffindor Draco, and it's a very large stretch considering Dean didn't live in Wiltshire. Please, keep that in mind x
“I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Harry looked over to the door and he knew he was paranoid it would open any minute now.
Grimacing at the pig-like manners his cousin had, Harry deliberately withheld the food. “What’s the magic word?” He mumbled to himself and suddenly it was like someone had cast a freezing charm.
. So lost in the moment, Harry only just realised that the blonde was kissing him back just as passionately as he was. About that kiss, Harry loved that Draco put his whole body into it. The blonde grabbed Harry by the waist and behind the neck, moving his head back and forth as they kissed.
As the song processed, so did their confidence. Facing each other, their smiles couldn't be wiped off their faces by anything at all. In that moment, it was just them. And they didn't even need to know each other’s names to be able to look at someone and just
me." And she grabbed his hand, leading him to the centre of the floor, "Put your hand on my waist." She instructed.
Harry couldn't help but thank Dumbledore for that oh so strange task years ago.
"Yes, well, you made that clear when you kissed Weaslette on that staircase." Harry went to talk, but Draco continued, "Or when you didn't grab my hand at the Manor: I was a hand reached away from you Potter... and you just left me there- again!" Harry felt the tears well in his eyes because their failed relationship was his fault, "When I told you I was forced into the mark and you decide to Potter Sempra me! You called me a 'freak of nature', that I 'wasn't human'. That I couldn't have emotions and I will only ever be known as a Death Eater." Draco's hot tears flooded his face but he struggled on anyway, "Do you know how hurt I was? Do you know that Blaise had to sit with me for a week alone in my room because I wouldn't stop crying?"
Draco thought that he would slowly begin to drown, then find it easier to swim down: be in so deep, that it's too deep for him to carry on. Then the stages of grief finish with acceptance- water filling his lungs, his eyes fluttering closed; the last image he sees is the blazing, pink sun light as a dot in his blackened vision.
"Now you sound like
"The date night?" She twirled. Harry looked to his dad, smirking at the fact his dad was in trouble. "I don't know what you're smirking about, young man." There was a pause, like something was meant to click in Harry's head but it never did.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He writes about me?" Harry asked, suddenly very interested in the conversation.
"Imagine having kids and a spouse. You could easily die from being an Auror, then you leave them for life." He explained, "No thank you. You can save life’s another way that doesn't risk your life!" And Harry thought about that.
"The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representatives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance." McGonagall announced. All the boys but Draco groaned as he really liked such formal events, and all the girls grew even more excited. "Silence. The house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
"Yeah, sure my showerhead is very impressed with me." He nodded like he was very, very serious Draco burst out laughing at the image of Harry screaming to Elton John or Tom Jones in the shower (
Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger hopped on the train with Harry having to pull Hermione out of the way because her head was stuck in a book. Not any book, but a Learn French Quick and Effectively! Book. All the way there and at the Quidditch World Cup, Hermione would speak to them in French, annoying the two to the point they wanted to rip it to shreds. Maybe even make French an illegal language.
“With all respect Professor, I am not sitting in that room pretending everything is sunshine and rainbows while my best friends are Merlin knows where doing merlin knows what!” His tone clipped and sharp, glaring at McGonagall while she glared back. Eventually, the woman gave in leading the first years to the entrance.
"Just leave me alone Malfoy." He heard Harry shout, however, it came out broken.
He told his brain). They found themselves at the fence and they both lent against it, Draco a little further over just so he could lean his head against Harry.
“Boys, we need to get going! Draco’s returning to Hogwarts tonight, McGonagall is collecting him!” Called Molly, to the twins and to the three second years.
He had gone through half of Transfiguration A, a quarter of Charms A, and whatever potions books interested him when it came to organisation of the books.
"Draco, Draco!" Whispered Lucius in the silent courtyard it may have been a scream. "Come, Draco." Narcissa's voice was softer but just as afraid.
And they kissed. Fireworks literally went off in the background, and people began to charge outside to see them. But all Draco and Harry needed was the electricity that they suddenly felt when his lips were on his. Nothing had been better up till now.
A small, cute owl flew down the table. Her large, blue irises shone and her small, black body could just carry the letter.
"It's been sixty years, and I still love you Dray. I did try to move on, I'm sure you would've been happy about that... but I couldn't find anyone I even liked. It was you for me, and it was only ever going to be you.
"How am I going to do my hair? A pony tail? A normal Platt? I NEED HELP!" He growled frustrated again.
"A cooked Dinner, please." He tightly said, wondering if strangling a creature was unethical. The House-elf nodded, popping away with a
When the food reappeared, Draco looked at it like it was Mount Everest and he had to climb it with no safety equipment. It had been a while since he'd had that much food on his plate. Starting to eat, he firstly cut off a part of the chicken and used his teeth to tug the piece off the fork, sighing at how good it tasted.
When Harry apparated, he knew he heard the cry of emotional pain from Draco as soon as he swished his wand. However, Harry was stubborn... which leads us to:
"Potter, do you think you could be anymore righteous if you tried?" Sighed Draco.
Back at Hogwarts, Draco moved all of his stuff from his private quarters to his dorm room for the year, because there was nothing else to do. He sighed, trudging the last piece of luggage from the room up those stairs Draco wished were an escalator instead, he flopped on his bed in a sweaty heap. And that day, he also wanted to get some Quidditch practice in before dinner.
"And they are so named?"
"I'm here for Draco." He said, slingling an arm around the blonde who immediately pushed it off. However, he wouldn't look Harry in the eye and the red wouldn't dissappear from his cheeks. Smirking, Harry also took that as a success.
"He's just excited to see everyone again. I would be if I were him." Neville argued, standing for the first time then stretching.
"There's 'Mione, see ya' mate." Ron clasped him on the shoulders quickly and rushed off to his date with the tail end of his waist coat flapping running to catch up to the girl looking around for him.
"Oui, oui, oui! bien sûr j'irai avec toi!" Exclaimed Draco as Harry lifted him off the ground. This time, Harry did lean in to kiss Draco and Draco did the same. They met half-way in a breath-taking kiss. Everyone else faded away: they only focused on each other in a passionate kiss and loving embrace. A very loud 'Whooop!!' From Ron knocked the two back to their senses. When they pulled apart, Draco still held Harry by the face and Harry still held Draco tightly by his hips, rubbing in a soothing, circular motion.
His mum and dad knew about the seventeen girlfriends he's had. James pinned it as the 'Potter Charm' and Lily scolded Harry for it, saying he needed to consider others feelings more.
The other boy switched sheepish, looking to the floor, “I’ve never seen you smile so brightly before when your father was punched... you have a beautiful smile.” Both their cheeks flamed pink at the uncommon emotions.
Harry had never been so nervous. He was so worried, that every five minutes he would ask Hermione 'what if?' questions. "Relax Harry! He is going to say yes." She reprimanded for the final time.
“Who were the people in those uniforms?” Harry asked him, jogging up to Draco’s side. Quickly, Draco stuffed the book in his bag he brought along.
"You could give him a chance." She shrugged, taking a sip of water after.
"Well, that is bound to happen being an Auror. That job seems so repelling to me." He shivered, thinking of it.
"Well, the Mudblood will be killed. But this one," He started laugh making Draco still like he was playing a game of freeze tag as a four-year-old. But remove the fun. "Will be special, made an example of, shall we say. As for the Weasley, he will go to a reform Centre: for Purebloods who were stirred in the wrong direction by their pathetic, filthy parents."
At one point in the game, Ginny moved to sit by Harry- a bit too close for Harry’s liking. And for Draco’s liking too by the icy glare he was shooting the eleven year-old girl. At everything Harry said the girl would blush, and when their hands brushed on accident Harry apologised but she tried to do it again.
The Slytherins abandoned him, and his parents told him to come home immediately, to which Harry stopped him from doing. Harry offered Draco a place to stay, and he agrees because he doesn't have anywhere else to go. He ignored every letter from the Manor and even Severus' attempts to discuss the matter with him.
Immediately, Voldemort took the role as Minister of Magic. Immediately, almost every country warded any British wizard from entering. Immediately, all Muggleborns were killed: all kidnapped or snatched. Even children, were tortured then killed. For some reason, they spared the babies. Draco thinks it's to either experiment, or teach them to be like the new British Wizarding Society.
"And who's this gentleman next to you?" Fleur asked.
"You're
"So, Draco, how was your holiday?" Asked Terry. Everyone was sitting down waiting for the entrance of the first years. Justin had gone to sit at the Hufflepuff table, even if all three wanted to stay together.
“I suppose you know all about that curse, huh Malfoy?” His voice gravelly and dangerously low, “Your father tortured countless on that curse. Your Aunt turned a boy’s parents dormant.” Neville cast his eyes to Draco looking sorry for him, “They say the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”
“Harry?” She asked for his opinion.
"Never seen a move like that before, not even with Charlie!"
"Harry, it's so good to see you." He whispered, squeezing Harry the tightest and longest of the three people. Eagerly, Harry returned the hug just as fiercely.
"For your information,” he said slowly, drawing out the third word, “the curses used to be used for good reasons too. Imperious was used to try and... fix the brain, when it is presumed you were brain dead. The Killing Curse was used to quickly and painlessly (than any other way of dying) kill an incurable dying patient. Lastly, there is the Cruciatus Curse, the worse of the three in my opinion. It was used to try and re-awaken the heart." With that he walked out with his bag tightly on his shoulder. Next to leave was Blaise and Theo, glaring and sneering at everyone, even more to the teacher.
Harry's eyes burnt with streams of guilt. Taking a step into the bedroom from only listening within the hall, Draco already felt like he was too close, “Dragon-"
On the rooftop, sirens of passing muggle vehicles fill my ears. Children laughing, playing, skipping stones in the lake nearby. Their positivity only serves as something I don't have, something I envy, something I didn't have in the first place- a child hood.
Within a flash, the girl with red hair ran up the stairs again and they all heard the closing of her room door. “Did I do something wrong?” Worried Harry.
“They were called Aurors. They’re our version of police.” Explained Draco.
Playing in the background was a love song, one of Draco's favourite songs, Harry came to learn. Why hadn't he told Draco he loved him sooner? If he did, would Draco be dead? Would Harry be holding him in their shared living room, watching muggle TV and talking about the future?
"I can just sleep on the floor, I'm no trouble." It was fast and quiet and sounded just how Draco's heart broke more in that moment for Potter. Someone so
"You don't expect me to go to that, do you?" Whined Draco.
Embarrassed, Ron blushed. "Right... sorry." His brown eyes turned to Draco. "Can I keep listening to this?"
But Potter was unrecognisable. Two black eyes, blue knuckles, no shoes, clothes torn to shreds like a bear had taken swipes at him for the fun. God, Draco never wanted to cry so much since his father's death.
He scolded himself). Crouching slightly to get to Harry's level, he took the man’s chin between his fingers and lifted it so they were looking into each other’s eyes. "I'm sorry." There was a pause, Potter not knowing if Draco was saying sorry for his past or something else, "I'll ask and if you say no, I'll just get a House-Elf to make up a bed for you tonight," Potter's mind wondered back to that odd House-elf from earlier who was incredibly well-spoken, "Would you like to sleep in my room tonight, Potter?"
"It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year." Draco thought the man was brave. Stupidly brave. A different kind of brave than killing a dark wizard, a brave for no reason kind of idiocy.
Picking up the entire box of letters, dating from the beginning of Hogwarts to the last one he hadn't already chucked in the flames, he threw the others head first into the volcano. He spoke to Harry, but was directed at the fire, "I hope that you burn."
"I was going to keep Potter as my own, Draco." His snake, sly sound still scared him. "But, with what your family had done to help with my cause, it is only fitting I repay their loyalty ten-fold." A swish of his wand, and Potter was set free. The shackles unclasped on their own, and Potter fell to the floor with a small, pathetic, weak grunt.
When the apartment door opened, Harry sighed suspecting it was Vein again. To his surprise, there was a gorgeous blonde boy at the door who kept glancing down then up (his impeccable grey eyes!) with pink-painted cheeks. "H-hi, I erm- I- I don't have anywhere else to sit. And... since we're in the same year- I just, I thought I would ask if I could- could sit. In here." There was an awkward silence.
“Really?” He gasped, “How’d it go?” The twins started talking over each other but Arthur seemed to catch it all. Swiftly, Mrs. Weasley wacked him in the back of the head with her hand, “That was very bad of you boys. Very bad.” He grinned at the twins and Ron.
"Later, Malfoy." Harry saluted, smiling, and slung his hands in his pockets. When Draco was entering his common room, he didn't see Harry glance back at him and let a genuine smile come over him.
Each droplet was a second, a second I could be found and stopped. A second that I'm suffering more!
Intently, Harry listened to the radio as it carried on.
Sitting down, Draco began to write. Occasionally, he would bring his phone out to write notes in the always download 'Notes' about future things happening in the things he was writing or for future ideas when he finished that one.
“Quite irritating actually.” The sharp tone of Draco cut the twins playful fun. His face was hard and Harry thought his face looked more pointed when he was mad. For what reason, Harry had no idea but hoped it wasn’t him.
Girlfriend number
When they were signed, Draco was the first to speak, "I expect all of your belongings to be out of my house by tonight, Potter." His voice was icy sharp, softening in sadness at his next statement, "I hope you can find someone who made you happier than I did."
“There were bars on his window mum!” Ron expressed through bread in his mouth.
From the stairs there was hammering of feet, and Harry saw a head of blonde hair. The boy automatically thought he was dead. But Draco ran over to Ron, “You idiotic Gryffindor!” He hit Ron four times in the chest before turning to Harry.
Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days."
Something ticked in Harry at seeing Draco chat with Zabini and Nott (not his main tormentors, but do on occasion when asked to by Parkinson) like old friends. “You know them?” He asked in a levelled voice.
“Hi...” Draco slammed it down, effectively holding the call. Taking a deep breath, he composed his quivering voice box so it was still.
It was a weird feeling now, whenever Draco was mentioned or he thought of the boy. He got this weird feeling in his stomach every time (Harry figured it was because he missed him so much). “He’s staying for a bit...” Ron’s cheeks turned pink, “He tried talking us out of coming, saying we would get in huge trouble with the ministry.”
"I can't believe they've cancelled Quidditch." Sighed Ginny, sitting a few seats down with her friends.
“Incroyable Zabini. Mon accent fait aussi des merveilles pour moi. Comment allez-vous avec les dames et messieurs?” He smirked as Blaise turned his head to talk with Nott who laughed at Draco’s comment.
Not needing to turn around, he knew his dad did the exasperated sigh thing where he flopped his arms to hit his sides then slightly stuck his head out for emphasis. "Yeah, he looks middle, you take it downtown."
Without anyone noticing, Draco spotted Narcissa in the corner. He ran to her, hugging her close in the secluded space. “Mother, what are you doing here?” He asked in a hushed voice.
"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the Tournament," Dumbledore continued, "none of which have been very successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical Co-Operation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that, this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger."
“They believe you put your name in. Why you would do that is definitely not something I could see you doing.” Draco said and Harry waved him over to lie down beside him.
"Calm down Mademoiselle 'Mione!" He chuckled, "I have done the move before, I was complete safe!"
After Draco had died, people began to listen to the blonde. The amount of original potions and methods for them there was in that mansion was impeccable. One that changed the Wizarding World was permanent Wolfsbane that only lost affect during the hours of the full moon. Another was a quicker and cheaper way to make Veritaserum. A final one enabled gay couples to carry children, changing a genders body part depending on their sex so they were able to produce a child without a surrogate.
"Ok, splendid. I'll get Acidy to bring us some blankets and pillows." Potter's eyes widened, "We'll sleep in the living room with a Lumos." The raven-haired man shook his head violently, "It'll be fun." Draco nodded, "Like having a sleepover, aye Potter?"
Harry decided to read the letter.
leader to be so defeated was terrible to even hear, let alone witness.
"Heck, you told the entire world what you did to me: I got an owl from Greg who's in America and Vince in Australia! You told them how you brought a girl into our bed." Picking up another letter, Draco was tempted to keep this one.
“Boys.” Warned Arthur from the seat of his armchair. They continued their game (games) of exploding snap.
“RONALD WEASLEY! If you are not up in the next five minutes, Fred and George will drag you down those stairs!” Molly shouted. In the living room, Percy and Draco were in a deep conversion about the ministry and Harry was sleepily huddled into Draco.
“Yeah, and I’m sorry Draco, I shouldn’t have snapped.”
"Potter, keep your eyes open, yeah?" He tried talking to the man and when Potter wouldn't look at him, he gently tapped his cheeks a few times. "Listen to me, Potter. Say something if you are listening you blubbering idiot." He grunted- that was all Draco could get out of him at the moment. "I need you to take your shirt off, so I can heal you." He added quickly, seeing the panic rise. "Don't worry, I won't do anything you don't want to: I can just heal your face and arms, and then I can run you a bath. No offense, but you do stink." He said as a joke, mumbling to himself he was an idiot for joking right now.
"That's rubbish!" bellowed Fred through cupped hands.
"Far be it for me to break tradition." Draco commented like it was nothing. Roughly, he grabbed Harry's arms and slung them around his waist, taking his own and putting them around Harry's neck.
"Je suis tellement ravie! je revois mes amis! Pourquoi ne peuvent-ils pas déjà être là?"
"I-I've just been asked to make another album!" He screamed, jumping up and down then into Harry's open, surprised arms. Ecstatic for Draco, Harry hugged back just as fiercely.
“No I am not joking Mister Finch-fletchely." he said, "Though I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar -"
at me in lessons,
"I'd rather be alone and ignored than completely ignored thank you Potter." He sneered, even though it wasn't Harry's fault. It appeared that the scarred boy knew that and decided to sit beside Draco.
"Heaven forbid someone whisper your part of a scheme!" Screaming, Draco noticed the flames in the room becoming more as the letters were pumped into them like a hose for a house fire. "Your enemy whispers so you have to scream!" He yelled once more, so much passion behind it, his heart was attacked by the flames of the fire.
He loved Draco...
But maybe that was out of pity?
To which Ron shouted "WHAT?"
"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of
Speaking of things I adore: Potter. I've been in love with the git since I was in diapers. But how can I keep loving someone so intensely who hates me? Hates me to the point they try and kill me... even though it was justified.
"Wha-what are you doing?"
"Have you read this?"
They've been together for five years, and the first three were incredible. He could see himself with Harry for his entire life. But then the promotion happened... he didn't even want the job.
It was the end of his second week, the Saturday.  So far Draco had been sent six flowers and he wondered if Harry was going for a rose bouquet. Breakfast was always an affair he looked forward to now, because he always enjoyed the little notes and flower Harry would send him.
Ron had seen Hermione and (for Draco and only for Draco) Ron was going to try and make a better effort with her.
"Dates?"
Draco was pressed against the back of the sofa, with Harry rested on his chest and he read aloud the book he was reading only just so Harry could here. If Draco read all my textbooks to me, I’d be a genius thought Harry, resting more into Draco if that was even possible.
Like an obedient little puppy, Harry followed. "Your dorm is down there, you do know that right?" Concerned, Draco glanced to his right. "How many years have you been at this school, Potter, and you don't know where the dorms are?"
Draco dragged a depressed Harry behind him to the library to prepare for the task ahead. Two days prior, Ronald and Hermione visited the two who were peacefully skipping rocks at the lake, to tell Harry some gossip-chain style information. When Harry returned, his first and only sentence of, “It’s Dragons” had Draco enveloping the younger boy in a soothing embrace. They poured over book after book after book, not managing to find many useful spells.
"But then, you had to destroy it all didn't you? With your righteous attitude! And I hope you know, it'll take more than an apology to fix this, if you even want to fix this!"
"Yeah, 'cause Oliver bloody Wood was still here!"
Coming out of the bathroom, Draco went straight to his bed. Guilty, Harry gave the blonde his doe-eyes, moving from his own to Draco’s and climbing under the sheets with him. “I’m really sorry Dray.” Murmured Harry, slowly lowering his head to Draco’s shoulder wrapping the blonde’s arm around his to rest on his neck. “I didn’t mean to worry you, I-I just wanted to get back to Hogwarts and to ask you about why it wouldn’t let us through. I didn’t think... I should’ve, I really should’ve. And I’m so sorry.” He waited for a reply to come only hearing a sniffle.
Immediately, Potter got stuck into it: practically throwing himself down on the many blankets and pillows to find the right one. Triumphant, Draco watched, fascinated with the man, as he fluffed all the pillows to find the right ones to go inside. The blonde man smirked.
He cursed himself under his breathe. "You idiot." Someone laughed next to him, smelling like alcohol.
Luna had become a reporter for the Quibbler as a small job before she left Hogwarts at the end of the year. Since they were second cousins, he went around to hers for tea once a week at least and Luna suddenly decided to post an article about this new-and-improved Draco Malfoy.
He managed to pull Harry from the lake and he broke the Horcrux of the locket. When Draco opened it up, it showed Harry kissing Ginny Weasley and the raven-haired boy telling Draco he would never love the son of a Death Eater. It echoed the countless times Draco was screamed at by Lucius or harshly scolded by Narcissa. There were reverberating smacks in the background after some insults.
"Try saying that five times fast?" And Fred and George did, just loud enough for Draco having to stop himself from laughing.
"You might be replaced Harry!" Beamed Fred teasingly.
“It means, my oblivious little brother, that you need to look at their
She then turned to Harry and sternly but sweetly (Harry didn’t know that was possible until this moment) lay a hand on his shoulder, “And you, if you ever hurt him, you don’t want to know the muggle ways I can harm you.”
"What, nobody asked you to come as a date?" Harry asked. They weren't close, but they talked occasionally- being co captains of the team might mean they had to.
Harry huffed and grabbed one of the headphones pushing it to the side. "Talk normally mate, we can still hear you, remember?"
Granger, Weasley, Potter... to the far left was Weasley: tape over his mouth, shackles on his wrists and ankles, noticeably shorter than the other two chains. His hair had to be ginger underneath all that grime, doesn't it? And his clothes weren't of the latest fashion, but they were never ripped, were they?
“Your eye-sight is horrible mate. Never known anyone to be so blind.” In discomfort, Ron gave them back to Harry with a waving arm adjusting his eyes to normal.
Around them, Percy and Molly caught on to what the twins were talking about. Reflecting on last year, Percy did think the two acted very close even for best friends. Especially, for male best friends.
However, Harry took a step forward allowing for Draco to take his wrist. The raven-haired boy expected his hand to pass through thin air and then he'd probably awkwardly laugh but instead, his hand made contact with skin.
"You flying home right now?" Asked Blaise on the other side of the phone. In the background, Pansy was shouting to let her talk to him. Draco laughed while bordering his Private Jet with his brother, Sol.
mum." James commenter and Lily hit him with her ringed hand. And she continued to do so until they were both out of the gym.
"Er-yeah, I-"
Drink in hand Draco clicked his fingers and this boy called Damien handed Harry his own one. Damien walked off, going to the refreshments table to grab another spiked punch for himself. Surprised, Harry's cheeks turned pink at the quick obedience to a small gesture.
Neville looked confused, “Really? I didn’t even know he was back in the country. Last I heard, he’d buggered off to… Where was it he went?”
Amongst Scorpius’ retellings of climbing a tree to save a snail, eating pancakes and falling over in the mud, Draco didn’t interject, relishing every moment he could listen to his bubbly little boy ramble on about a tree branch as if it was the most magnificent thing in the world.
Harry had to contain his laughter, “From rocking chair to rock chair, am I right?”
“I apologized for that, I intend to do so personally to all of them as well. That aside, Potter, had you not been so wrapped up in your own issues, you might have noticed that I was, in fact, quietly wondering what it would be like to be looked at by you, in the way which you looked at Cho, and later Miss Ginny Weasley. Well, Mrs Ginny Potter by now, I assume.”
Harry looked at Draco with a half smile, as if he were really considering the idea, glad to have it proposed at all, but Draco was let down by his response.
Kudos, if earned, are always appreciated ;)
He picked up his drink and wandered on after Harry, curious as to what the upset was about this time.
“Next to George and Angie, of course. George’s been working with Malfoy, y’see.”
After what would have been a few miles of walking, he had circled back to the robes shop, and the prospect of seeing shopkeeper from earlier again making him squirm with anxiousness, Draco hurriedly turned into a sidestreet to catch the breath he didn’t know had escaped him, body heaving from the uncommon amount of exercise. The raw, aching pain of scar tissue over his chest and back refusing to stretch as his lungs expanded was easily dulled with a whispered spell and a fluid movement of his hand, but the uneasy feeling of being watched, stayed. Fighting the need to sink to his knees in exhaustion, both mental and physical, made Draco feel guilty and regretful that he never managed to eat enough to keep himself strong nor exercise enough to feel fit. He had to lean against the old, greying brick wall for support, wind rushing between the buildings, dragging wet, dead leaves with it, until the silhouette in the corner of his eye came too close for comfort, and Draco finally managed to apparate home, not waiting to find out if whoever he saw had actually been there, nor what they might have wanted.
“Evening, Malfoy.”
“Good evening mister Potter. I’m sure you are aware that you are quite early.”
Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
“Yeah, no problems. My mum’s probably feeding them everything she possibly can at this moment.”
Hermione nodded, “Yes, so much better. I’ve started keeping a diary, to order my thoughts and everything that’s happening every ohso hectic day. I’ve spent so much of my life reading, you would think the idea of writing might have come to me sooner.”
Hermione and Luna disappeared upstairs, Harry handed Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus the packages that had just been dropped off by owls; suits to each of their preference and size. The Weasley’s parties were all but small and required a certain level of dressing up. The fireplace lit up and out stepped Andromeda and Ted, who looked very smart in his blue suit with a grey tie, holding a present with sparkly wrapping and a large bow that spurted fireworks, “D’you think she’ll like it?” Ted asked, holding the present up for Harry to inspect.
Ron started piling cuts of meat, potatoes, carrots, gravy and the like onto his plate, everyone shortly copying him.
It was calm in the streets of the little town, a few students went in and out of the Three Broomsticks as he passed it, unable to ignore the years-old pull that he felt towards the place with a smile. Everything about Hogsmeade oozed nostalgia; faded memories he loved, like the books Hermione would lovingly read by the fire in Gryffindor common room, with their yellowed and worn pages. He knew Hermione and Ron would be attending together this evening, and Ted was staying the night at the Burrow with their kids. He assumed that Ginny would go there with Albus and James, if she felt like being with company.
Harry simply nodded vaguely before falling silent for a few moments, re-running what Hermione had said in his mind, “All the other could ever want, eh?”
Harry spluttered on his mouthful of food, and started coughing, so much that Hermione started thumping her hand on his back. It took him a full few minutes to regain his breath, teary-eyed and flushed.
Harry chuckled and swatted the back of his head, "You've been spending too much time with the Weasleys. Just 'cause you apparated for the first time, doesn't mean you can swear, young man."
“-which means that I now have to find them in the midst of two kids and keeping my research going, honestly Harry, absolute nightmare, though Ron has been helping me very well.”
“Uganda,” sighed Hermione, “Uagadou specializes in Alchemy, and he was always good in Potions class, I’m sure that’s why Malfoy went there. Or, just to get away from everyone’s judgement. Can’t have been easy for him, being a Death Eater, fighting on the wrong side of the battle, father in Azkaban. He seems to have found his place now though, he married somebody Greengrass.”
Draco sighed, “You’re taking the piss, but unfortunately, I was…”
Malfoy raised his chin, “Maybe. You certainly failed to notice-”
Malfoy seemed taken aback, “Whatever gave you that idea?”
Harry looked back at the faces, smiling sadly.
He laughed and took the present from Ted, then pulled him into a hug, “I’m sure she’ll love it, buddy.”
As you may be aware, the tenth anniversary of the notorious Battle of Hogwarts is anon approaching. To our great sorrow, many of our dearest friends gave their lives to safeguard our school and conserve our liberation during that time.
“For, for each other...” Harry sighed.
Malfoy laughed, thinking that Harry was joking. When he saw him being serious, he rubbed the back of his neck and cleared his throat again.
“You assumed wrong, by the way.”
Draco laughed, assuming he’d painted a face on a pinecone, and looked inside the bucket as well. He nearly jerked back at what he saw, but instead held the bucket up, “That, my dear boy, isn’t a niffler.”
At some point, Harry left Draco’s apartment, but only after some stilted conversation, Malfoy being insistent that Harry borrow some of his clothes because he wasn’t going to let him walk around in last night’s suit, and another kiss. He apparated in front of his house, which was now easier to get into because Neville had woken up, and he opened the door for Harry with a very sluggish and confused expression.
“Malfoy? Is this…?”
What do you think?
Pleased to see him, Ginny waves, “Harry, there you are! Could you bring me a glass of punch, I’m in dire need of a drink.”
“Oh. Where’ve you been all night then?”
“Touchy, touchy… Done any of that yet, maybe?” Seamus made a point to obviously eye Draco up and down with a smirk, then at Harry, “Malfoy looks stiff as a board, I’d say he could use a pair of hands on his-”
“Why? A memorial is, as the name suggests, a way to keep the memory of them alive. If that memory, as well as a place so full of trauma, called for a way to cope, surely that’s alright?”
Harry’s eyes shot wide open in surprise, “What, he’s still here?”
Harry sighed, looking at the letter, still on the table. He folded it up and slid it back into the envelope, then left it next to a picture of Fred in the living room. Ted had fallen asleep on the sofa at some point, so, with a little bit of effort, Harry managed to carry Ted into the green flames of the fireplace and onto the sofa in his own living room.
"Permission always granted, Potter, no need to ask. And please, don't call me 'sir', makes me feel like I'm thirty for Merlin’s sake. Malfoy's fine." He laughed, trying to show it was okay to express emotion around him, Draco would prefer anger or plain sobbing compared to Potter's reserved-ness.
"Who's your next target, mate?" Asked Ron, bumping his shoulder and smiling at him.
“Hogwarts letters have arrived! Dumbledore must have known you were here Harry- mystery, that man is.” She sighed, handing out the envelopes individually.
"Yeah, da-" his eyes widened, "Those weren't-" taking a deep breathe, Harry's face was flat as he shrunk into his shirt, really wishing he had a hoodie on, "I wish you the best of luck, Draco Malfoy..."
It was school that was the problem though. Blaise, Pansy and Daphne weren't returning instead opting to go to Beauxbatons instead. Greg, Millicent and Theo were going to Durmstrang so Draco didn't have anyone in his year to talk to.
"Sorry Professor, just speaking the truth. Is already after the Snitch! Oh and Ravenclaw Seeker- Hufflepuff seeker, Cedric Diggory's new girlfriend- Cho Chang is now zooming off in Malfoy's direction! They are neck-a-neck!" His excitement rising, "A FILTHY FOUL FROM CURLINGS! HE KNOCKED THE BEAUTY KATY BELL-"
"What's going on?" Their voice just reaching the end puberty as he was sixteen but still sounding innocent. James Sirius Potter snatched a pamphlet from Boot's hand, skimming through it. However, Padma Patil pointed out all the key points over his shoulder. Numb, James stared at the pamphlet feeling betrayed himself.
Everyone piled on the train for the new year at Hogwarts. And things were definitely new for one Draco Malfoy. This was his first year at Hogwarts- the school his mother wanted him to go to. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy had divorced over the summer; Narcissa returning back to England to live in Grimmauld Place. Imagine Narcissa' surprise (and Draco's confusion) when they find a man with long, curly black hair sat in the living room.
The blonde nodded, "Sure, it's got around thirty minutes of music on it."
"Welcome, First Years." Dumbledore warmly stated. "And welcome back, to everyone else. Firstly, I must ask once more for your attention while I give out a few notices. Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle this year has been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch's office if anybody would like to check it."
Uncomfortable in the corner full of stoners while the After Party to Prom raged on behind him, Harry nervously fidgeted on the spot and fiddled with the ends of his black suite. "Oh, sit down Potter- I'll even put this out if it makes you uncomfortable." Draco rolled his eyes, moving so he and Harry were a select distance away from the blonde's preferred social group.
Off the train now, Draco took in the air around him outside the stuffy cabin. Hanging back, Draco decided to wait for the prefects (and because he wanted to pet the Thestrals too).
Harry's friends were incredibly accepting of it, even Ron who dislikes the Malfoy's like nothing else. The blonde apologised to everyone, and didn't say the M-word, Blood traitor or comment on blood ever again.
." His shaking didn't come through the mic, but he really felt freezing all of a sudden. The boy still wasn't looking at him, that Harry went to go off the stage.
"Us Weasley's get placed in Gryffindor within seconds." Continued his twin, George.
"Rather you than me, Terr." He said, grabbing a chicken breast between his knife and fork. "But a Ravenclaw champion would be very honourable." The boy nodded in agreement, "Just as long as it isn't Gryffindor."
There was no Neville Longbottom to give a pep talk. But, when Harry opened his eyes, he could only roll out of Hagrid's shackled arms when Dolohov yelled "Avada Kadarvra!" From the crowed, hitting Hagrid Square in the chest.
Finally, the great double doors opened. Another year and another set of a hundred or so students. Draco believed it wasn't so difficult to figure out why there were so little students around their year. The first Wizard War would mean many people would not be focused on reproducing.
Draco rolled his eyes, "You don't even need the prize money."
thing. Like how some father and sons have fishing, or bird watching, or dare-devil stuff like skydiving, they had basketball. They had always shared basketball.
“Definitely not! We do not need to be known as the weird family who let their freakish nephew have an Owl!” Replied Vernon
Draco hadn't heard what was going on. Still too focused on continuing his next chapter, of course.
In the living room, Draco and Ron were playing Chess while Harry watched. Ron had just moved his queen to I7, but not taking a piece when the magical piece moved. The Queen sighed in frustration at her controllers inability to take out at least a porn or rookie. When Draco called him closer, the blonde leaned against Harry, yawning already and mumbled a move. His head was somewhere near Harry’s shoulder but not fully on it. “Come on Malfoy, I thought you wanted to play!” Ron sighed, flopping back against the bottom of the armchair.
“Fred, George, how are you?”
“Draco! How are you?” Maria hugged him tight and he returned it, “I haven’t seen you in three weeks: tell me, how are the Weasels?”
The world went black... nothing improved. I was too young to take my life. I was age twenty. I barely even lived a life. I left everyone, because I coped with my mental illnesses wrongly. If only I had talked to someone, if only I had the confidence to tell anyone.
It was late at night; almost everyone had gone to bed. Some people were still up, and those some included the main couple. Draco’s arms laced Harry’s neck, their fore-heads leaning together and Harry’s on Draco’s waist. Every so often, one would lean in, slowly kissing the other at random times. “What are we?” Asked Harry, them swaying slowly to the music.
“Me too, I missed you.” Harry squeezed back, burying his face in Draco’s shoulder. The boy had grown taller this year, just shy of Ron’s height.
There was a line attached to some square with a black thing inside.
Okay, so maybe they were more than that (in secret) for a while, possible snog buddies, possibly snog buddies with feelings... well, that all stopped when Harry decided to get a girlfriend for about a month. They hadn't talked about resuming that silent agreement at all, even if they both wanted it to happen. Maybe even on a more intimate level.
“Oh, hello.” Harry answered when she walked down. He was the only one who didn’t see her wide eyes and her suck in a breathe. Beside him, Draco felt something unpleasant twinge inside of him not understanding what it was.
Curiously Draco raised an eyebrow, "us?"
"Yes, Professor McGonagall." His attention was back on the Seekers who were a meter away from the crowds heads, "The Snitch took a sharp turn left back on the pitch- Malfoy managing to turn immediately, leaving Chang in the dust! But she's caught back up! Both their hands are stretched and, WHAT?!"
It was Weasley. "STUPIFY!" Cried the Weasel, and his father was sent back, his head hitting a rock. Gone. At the time, his and Weasley’s eyes connected and Weasley looked like he was about to cry. Not that Draco registered any of that: all he saw was red. Just about to fire a Crucio or even the Killing Curse, "HARRY POTTER... IS DEAD!" Rang through the Court Yard to the other side of Scotland, the silence was so deadly.
“You hungry?” George asked looking at the stuff Molly prepped for dinner that day. He ripped off bits of bread and threw a piece to Ron, and Fred to Harry.
Speaking of ghastly hair: "Potter, stay still while I perform some charms, and for Merlin's sake put one of my shirts on!" He tutted, noticing Potter's flinch, "Hey, it was only a joke. You won't be punished for being yourself or even a bit messy. I just want you to be clean and in good clothing due to your experience within the few months prior."
thought Harry, "You laugh a lot with your friends, smile with Zabini, you're
"Lee Jordan. You were appointed commentator, and you said you will have no bias!"
It was dinner time? Huh, Draco didn't have any food in. Oh well, he went back to bed. Those salt drops still soared from his eyes to his neck, ears or mouth. But at least he couldn't feel the sadness as dominant anymore, right? At least the numbness was taking away the excruciating pain. Maybe it wasn't just heartbreak pain? It could be that he rarely eats, rarely drinks, and Draco doesn't think he'd showered for quite a while now.
When I took the final step, I couldn't tell if it was my final one or not. Because my vision was so blurred by heavy tears of guilt, overwhelming sadness, frustration and depression.
Harry told them all what happened, and Arthur was smiling from ear-to-ear hearing Lucius Malfoy was selling to Borgin and Burkes. He told them about the checks on the ministry officials, grinning as they all made their way to the book store.
“Yes they do. I’m sorry if I do not bow down to you, but there’s no need to use your friend to ask such a bigoted question. Your fame does not faze me, as your mother saved the world with her love. I do not mean to offend you with such a statement, only stating the truth. It was not you who rid us of You Know Who, it was Lily Potter- who I am told was a lovely woman.” His formal voice sounded so practiced and robotic. Ron turned red in anger, but Hermione smiled, taking Draco’s side. Meanwhile, Harry was flabbergasted. Never had someone spoken to him in such an even (slightly hurt) manor.
The white tulip was closed up, but that's what it was in the image too. Its elusive, delicate petals overlapped, hugging each other tightly with a very small and light green blanket fading at the bottom. Its stem was long, but quite thick compared to the others he had received.
"There's Veela's in Beauxbatons." Terry grinned. Draco shook his head at his friend. "And the boys from both schools are right yo your ally." The blonde smiled more genuinely at that.
Oh, Harry was right: he couldn’t have been more right. The food was delicious to consume with it all melting in his mouth. And the fluffy insides of the potato with the texture you would expect cotton candy to have.
Very uncomfortable, he looked up to see Draco’s expression and his cheeks turned red. He excused himself, saying he wanted to sit on the sofa and went beside Draco. Much like the night before Christmas, Draco moved around so he and Harry were lying down with a blanket draped over them. In one hand was The real Racketeer In Salem, by Dezeray MacQuoid. It was someone telling the Salem Witch Trails from a witches point of view in the village.
"Silence!" Dumbledore shouted; it shocks Draco every time, but Harry placed a hand on his to stop him jumping. The Headmaster grabbed the edge of the dusty cloth covering something and pulled it off, revealing... The Goblet Of Fire. "The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if chosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun!"
"Thank you for the- shocking insite to your life, Draco. I don't think any interview can ever top this." He laughed, and so did Draco, "Here is Katy Perry with her new single, I hope you enjoy."
.” He replied to the question properly before Vernon’s face could burst from red to a prominent purple, “If I could just let her out for an hour or so!” He felt like dropping the frying pan over Vernon. The food he had cooked, that he didn’t even get to eat.
Then Harry would be holding a breathing me on his sofa as we watched muggle TV I didn't understand. Instead of Harry holding a dead me, on the soaked grass of the vacant Manor.
Harry sat up to attention when Draco squealed from the kitchen. Bolting up in surprise, the smaller man ran into the room because, he thought something had gone wrong.
"So!" said Dumbledore smiling around at them all. "Now that we are fed and watered, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter you lessons tomorrow morning, Bedtime! Chop Chop! Prefects, lead the first years to their Houses. I hope you get comfortably settled here."
In the airport he heard the screaming of teenage girls and some guys (even though he was not out to the world yet) over the harsh blowing of the fans. Smiling, Draco jogged to the entrance of the airport to quickly make it through customs and greet the people there to see him. Stepping through the glass doors, the screaming intensified just as quickly as Draco's smile reached his eyes. Signing autographs and t-shirts, Draco also talked to his fans along the way.
Saying goodbye to Harry, he hugged him tightly- tighter than he did to Ron, Fred or George, Percy and him only shook hands- whispering that he wishes to see Harry in one piece at Hogwarts. The other boy laughed, “how much trouble can I get into in a week?”
And Harry took this as an opportunity. Knowing Justin and Gary (is it Gary?) were both prefects, he raced as sensibly quick as possible to the blonde. It wasn't a secret where Ravenclaw Tower was, or how to get in. Everybody knew it was a riddle: a different riddle each time. Alternatively, Harry did not want to answer a riddle to get Draco on his own to charm the gorgeous blonde. (and Harry would not have been able to answer the riddle, too.)
"He forgot his book, again. Thought we agreed with him no writing on New Year's." Lucius commented, picking it up and opening to a random page, reading through it- even though he knew that maybe Draco didn't want to share that. Lucius smiled, closing the book and taking it to Draco's room.
Once more, Ron huffed, “Harry mate, you carry on then.”
So, Draco sat down at his desk, parchment out and quill in hand...
Taking the advice, Harry wondered through the crowd of people flaunting the fact they have a car (Brand new Audi Hatchback, yeah), girls smiling while dropping names (Oh yeah, Jayden Croes viewed my profile yesterday." Laughed Pansy Parkinson drowning in the shower of gawping mouths and wide eyes, "Me and Josh Richards met too, he's a sweetheart!") and people asking to use the plug already in use, playing the 'I have less percent than you!' Card.
"BUT DRA-" Pansy was cut off by the signal being lost and Draco chuckled again- he didn't realise how much he missed his best friends.
Tear after tear fell and fell as I got closer to the edge. The edge. A place that will send me to Hell if I believed in God, because Suicide counts as a clause in the seven deadly sins. Pattering of pipe water added as a timer.
"And my patients is almost done." His mother sternly told him as softly as she could. "I thought we agreed no MP3 tonight because of the party?"
“I know, but now when Ted goes, he can tell me what things are like without all of those disasters going on.”
He sighed, “I’ll be honest, it was more like one large, alcohol-fuelled therapy session than a memorial. I feel a bit guilty.”
“You’re both doing better now, then?” Harry asked cautiously, as Hermione had struggled with finding her footing in motherhood, what with there being so few books on the subject for mothers in the wizarding world and her being so book-centred.
Harry had drifted apart from the group at one point, and now found himself wandering a hallway covered in portraits, his wand lit up with a whisper of Lumos. Hanging on the wall, there was one of Albus Dumbledore, standing in his office, poring over some parchment. His phoenix squawked, and before the painted version of Dumbledore could look up at Harry, he moved on to the next picture. There was a canvas with a very large group of people in it, and he was about to look at the next picture, until something made him do a retake.
“Indeed. A patronus against hippogriffs. Revolutionary. Must talk to George about this.”
“Well, it wasn’t all me, not even close. Andy- Andromeda, is always there to pick up my slack, Ginny too.”
Harry seemed puzzled by the last, so Draco nods and elaborates, “Ted’s grandmother is my mother’s sister- Andromeda is my aunt.”
Enthusiastic, Harry looked up at Maria wanting to know more, “He fell off the swings into a toddler’s play pool when he was nine-”
“Why, what such hurtful altercation!” Fred rebuked placing a hand on his heart.
Immediate, the boy’s expression softened, “It’s okay Harry, it was nothing.”
“Right. Yea, I-" There was surprise in that voice, and Draco deeply wished it was hurt instead. Just so Potter knew what it felt like. To have your world flipped. “I was wondering if... you’d like to meet. To meet up. To go over everything? I just want to-" the man cleared his throat (a tell-tale sign he was on the verge of tears). “To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done. For er- breaking...” the word
Harry was hooked. There was no way in hell Harry was going to let this gorgeous blonde go.
he asked for a divorce? Why didn't he just talk to Draco about the distance between them? His mind was swirling with questions and self-pity that he didn't even realise he apparated himself back to his flat.
Being the tallest, Justin slung his arms over the two Ravenclaws. Like they were childhood friends, they reminisced over the years and the first time they arrived.
"But it isn't Sunday."
Soon enough, the three became equated (or re-equated in Narcissa and Sirius' case) quickly and Sirius told Draco all about Hogwarts. This included his godson and his best friends.
“I've missed two of your birthdays, two Christmas', Rose's birthday, Teddy’s birthdays, Rose's birth, your mother’s birthday, our anniversaries. Reality only kicked in when you left. But please, please give me a second chance. A chance to prove that I love you back. Because I do, I could never love someone more.
Draco had done many renovations since taking over Malfoy Manor- as a distraction, mainly. It was now a month since the war had ended and when he got back Draco closed off the East Wing forever and locked the dining room door with the strongest curses and wards, he could imagine. Then, he had to redesign the place like he wanted it.
“Draco, Harry,” he disrupted the peaceful boys who forgot the world around them existed, “Tell me, what is the purpose of a mickywave?”
because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?" He commanded more than asked.
"But this shall not disrupt exam seasons, so O.W.L and N.E.W.T students do not get off lightly." The seventh and fifth years groaned. "With that being said, my final message is to stay away from the Forbidden Forest. This will lead to an instant suspension. Now," He clasped his hands together, "Let the feast begin!"
"You were going to hit the Thestrals!" Neville smiled at him and Draco remembered he could see them too.
"Mm, and everyone says he's so humble and kind and considerate and caring." Exaggerating, rolling his eyes and more.
Friends- friends will be fi-"
As a reward for allowing the Dark Lord to stay in the mansion, and for his father's sacrifice to the cause, Draco was able to pick a person to be his. A slave, really. "I choose... Harry Potter."
“What? Have the arrived? Are the okay?” Questioned Draco, falling into line beside his Godfather.
“No, no-Er, that wasn’t it at all!” Stammered Harry, turning red as he waved his arms in denial, “It’s just, I-uh, don’t like the fame… I just wanted to know if it would be a problem.”
"God's Potter, you still need that bath." Potter's eyes saddened. "Fine, I'll cast a cleaning charm, just this once. You're having a wash from now on, every day." Joyful, Potter nodded, looking to Draco with Venus-green, perfect jade jewels. Leaving his wand at the end of the Pillow Fort by his feet, Draco kept a Lumos on, trying to sleep with light present just so Potter wouldn't be afraid to sleep in the Manor.
“Hello Ginny dear.” Molly averted the conversation from the two blushing boys seeing her only daughter walk down the steps.
"You sounded like you’ve sung a lot too." Suggest Draco, snuggling into Harry's jacket that was too broad for him, but not long enough. Harry was just shorter than him that he only needed to look down slightly, he could deal with that height difference.
"Percy should have been an exception,"
“Afternoon all, sorry I left earlier today dear.” He said to Molly. They had a quick peck and the twins made a gagging noise when they did.
"Pas de problème, je suis Hermione Granger." The girl introduced herself, taking a seat opposite the transfer student.
"Five galleons Dean?" Seamus said in a smug voice.
“I swear to Merlin.” Sighed Arthur, running up the steps to his three sons. They heard the voices of them and then silence.
Ignoring his blush, Draco cleared his throat. He decided not to answer, because in his head Draco thought it would be very rude. (You're always thinking of your next fucktoy and acting like a neanderthal to notice those with actual intelligence.)
"What?" His face screwed up in confusion, but he was still bouncing the ball, bouncing on the balls if his feet. "By going left?"
Funny, how that now he's dead people finally listen to all the good he had to say and all the good he'd done in the world.
It started off with nodding or smiling to Malfoy in the halls. The blonde stared at him in confusion at first, but soon Malfoy was smiling back, blushing when he noticed Harry looking at him. Harry kinda found him cute...
He broke his precious blonde's heart. Harry knew exactly what that was like:
.” George added quotation marks to the last word, and the two started walking off.
“Where
Sweating, Harry breathed deeply through his nose and out his mouth. The court was smoothed, not a scratch on the floor before he and his father had gotten onto it. Even the hoops were up to pristine quality, again, until they had gotten to them. However, all their basket balls were still in the prestige, fully-pumped quality. Unfortunately for Lily, her husband and son had brought their own.
"Awe! That is so sweet!" Li swooned, fanning herself as a joke. Abbott's smile was almost as wide as his own as she read the note attached to the ghostly white tulip.
We-we can rebuild trust and- and everything else and- or we can be friends.
As Draco reached the bottom, he saw the throw of Arthur’s punch at his father and Draco’s mouth opened and his eyes widened. The books toppled from the shelves and the case fell on the floor with it. Once Draco was snapped out of it, he was cheering Arthur on as about three successful punches were thrown in succession.
"I love you too- I got a right Yelling at from our mother's when I arrived." Chuckling, Draco gazed into those wide emerald eyes.
"Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, and you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
“Anyone would be happy to have you, Harry. It’s not like they could refuse you, of all people.”
‘Okay’.
“Hey, you said that Malfoy had already told you about the painting at Hogwarts. When did you talk to him?”
“So, from what I can gather after that little exposition, it’s a bit tense between you and Scorpius’ mum?”
Tragically, the spell ends prematurely when Molly bustles up to Draco asking about the punch, and he disappears with her into the house. Harry didn’t even have a moment to process the thoughts and revelations that he’s just gone through, because seizing the spot just opened up next to him, Hermione moves to stand next to Harry, conspiratorial glint in her eye and all.
Harry looked at Andromeda, "Well... Only if Granny Anny says it's okay..."
Malfoy only smiled in response, and handed him a mug of tea once the kettle had boiled. Harry took it gratefully, and stood opposite Malfoy against a kitchen counter while he silently sipped it, slowly going over the shreds of memory he had from last night. One in particular made him take another swig of tea and shake his head, af if that would make it go away… Or make it clearer. He looked up at Malfoy, who was eyeing him with that expression of knowing a little too much, and narrowed his eyes.
Ron answered with his mouth full, “Can’t change what’s perfect, love.” He swallowed and grinned widely at Hermione, who scoffed, but couldn’t help but laugh.
“I thought he would have married that Parkinson girl he was always hanging about with.” commented Neville, “Though I understand why he didn’t. She wasn’t a very nice person, really.”
Draco tutted at Harry’s distasteful assumption, “Such violence, Potter? They are philosophers, not Beaters on a Quidditch field. I meant that alchemists like to prove their point by citing past research and tests.”
Draco looked up, confused, “Probably not. What year?”
Draco was brought out of his thoughts by a soft snore, to the serene image of Harry Potter, sound asleep against the brick, head lolled onto his shoulder at an odd angle. Draco winced, he couldn’t imagine that sleeping position to be comfortable. He dropped down to crouch next to Harry and tapped his chest a few times, to which Harry barely responded. With a sigh, Draco took hold of Harry and, after several attempts, managed to get him on his feet. It helped that Harry had stayed lean, and that he was a bit shorter than Draco.
The group nodded in agreement, quietly finishing up the food on their plates.
He stepped outside, closed the front door and Apparated to the Ministry, swiftly walking along with the throng of people on their way to work. He stepped into an elevator, and stepped back out on Level Two, where he encountered Luna. She smiled sheepishly, "Hello, Harry. How are you today?" she asked in her usual soft tone, "Did you have a good morning?"
Malfoy didn’t answer immediately, he simply looked at each of the faces for a few moments, then at Harry. His voice was distant, more disconnected than he’d been during the minutes prior.
Harry shook his head, “The case was brought to us by a member of the muggle law enforcement, a muggle wife of a wizard. She asked us to have a look, because they couldn’t identify it as any muggle-known substances. Sure enough, Appare Vestigium showed traces of magic, but not any kind of magic that we know. It’s new, independently invented, not taught.”
“Not a fan of birthday bashes, then? Hiding out in the kitchen and all that.”
"Traitor!" gasped Ginny, bringing a smug look to Harry's face.
That evening, after putting Scorpius to bed and awkwardly trying to keep a conversation going with Astoria, Draco arrived home through his fireplace. He washed the dishes he and Mrs Cambell had used earlier, then changed his button-down for a navy jumper. About to leave, he was reaching for his coat, when he saw the envelope on his doormat. He recognized the seal, and various scenes from those seven years flashed through his head. He was debating whether to just grab his coat and step over the envelope, leave it where it was, but his hand, still in midair, started getting numb and he brought it down, all the way to the floor, where he picked up the letter.
As if he were summoned, Seamus walked up, looking much too happy about catching the last snippet of Harry’s sentance, “What’s this about pleasure?”
“Can’t. Hermione enchanted my house against opening spells. And Neville usually silences his entire house from outside noises before going to sleep.”
Wednesday the 2nd of April 2008
Without a second of pause, Harry takes Draco's hand and leads him out of the house, pauses just outside the door, then strides through a few groups of people, until he halts Teddy mid-run, letting Victoire tag him and run off again.
“I’ll have you know that Uagadoo teaches advanced alchemy, and that I owe my career, and by extent, my life to that school.”
Ginny giggled, “Oh, Harry Potter… Only you would want the complete opposite of living through someone vivaciously.”
The arrangement that Harry and Ginny had come to suited them both as a perfectly fine solution to a relationship that had gone unattended and ultimately fizzled out, something that had saddened them both greatly but didn't hold against each other. Busy schedules from high-demanding and time-consuming top careers, mixed with a close and large family that was regularly visited, left them with few moments to spend, just the two of them. A rocky start to a last year's Quidditch season on top of an already stressful day job and the resulting lack of sleep for Ginny didn't improve her irritability. The joint decision to terminate her third pregnancy in its early stages was something that Ginny felt grateful for, however sad it was to lose a child. She felt better now, knowing that it had been the right choice. She couldn't imagine any of the steps that she and Harry had taken to end their marriage would have been very pleasant with a newborn involved, and she had never wished to bring another child into such a tense and unhealthy environment.
“Oh. Didn’t know you were there…” He muttered, stepping over the bench to sit next to Malfoy, albeit facing the opposite way.
Stumped, Hermione blinked, “Wow. What do you need my help for? Tell me, how did you get that far, without realising he was into you?”
“I see. Hadn’t expected that. Although this evening has been full of things I didn’t expect, so far.”
“No, it would be great if you’d stay. That would probably make it easier.”
Harry rescued the tin from James, who had climbed onto the counter (with the assistance of a strategically placed chair), and was preparing to bash the elusive metal case, withholding what he knew for sure to be something sweet, against the wall. Before James could burst out a tantrum, Harry popped the tin open and handed him and Albus a flapjack, before cheekily eating one himself. He picked James up, who made a gurgling sound, as if he were an explosion, before stuffing another bite in his mouth when he was back on the floor. Albus mimicked the sound before giggling loudly, which started a who-can-laugh-the-loudest contest between both toddlers.
He ended up sitting in his velvet high-backed armchair, tumbler with gin on the side table, turning the letter over and over in his hands. Finally, with a heavy sigh, he broke the seal and pulled the letter out of its envelope.
Ted nodded understandingly, “Was it Crookshanks? ‘Cause I’d be fine with you trapping him in our attic for a while. I wouldn’t have removed you for that, just so you know.”
McGonagall, who had observed Harry during his few seconds of bewilderment, looked around and sighed.
Harry's face scrunched in confusion and looked away. A minute or so later, he looked at Malfoy, repeatedly taking a breath to talk, but deciding against it at the last moment, until he could fully form a sentence again.
Barely following what she was saying, he looked at her as if she were on the other side of an opaque window, “Are you saying that you knew I liked him in school?”
Ron looked from his wife to Harry, “No, I didn’t. Why’s that?”
The crack of dawn- the promise of a new day, accompanied by the vivid pink and orange of a sunrise, reflected in the trademark round glasses that sat upon Harry Potter's nose. His kitchen window had the most breathtaking early-morning view he'd come across, even if he may say so himself, especially since he was drinking a cup of steaming tea while soaking up the first golden rays of the day.
“That’s very kind of you, Malfoy, but honestly, I will be fine. Already looking forward to the guilt-waffles that Dean might make tomorrow morning for me.”
“Right, so should I.”
“I know, he won’t be forgotten, no one that ever knew him would let themselves forget him. I’m not sure anyone ever could.”
Draco scoffs, bet not without looking pleased with the compliment, “I should hope so, it is essentially my area of expertise.”
Harry half-expected Malfoy to slap him after that comment, so the moment that their lips met again was a relief, if not confusing at worst and complicated at best. Harry managed to drop his thoughts though, and slide an arm around Malfoy, pulling him closer, as Draco tilted Harry’s chin up with his hands. When Harry went to break apart, Draco placed a hand firmly behind his neck, bringing him back in, sliding his fingers into the mess of hair, and Harry melted in the grasp Draco had on him.
Harry smiled to himself as a rabbit dashed through the dew that glistened over his unkempt back garden, which had grass at irregular lengths, weeds, common flowers and a few bushes growing throughout the sizeable piece of land. He really must get around to tidying all that wild vegetation up... If only to be able to sit at a small table, in his back garden, fresh dawn air surrounding him, while he sipped his morning tea. Another smile, another thought skipped through Harry's mind, one including two young children giggling as they ran through daffodils that he could picture growing right at the back, in the left corner of the garden.
“I heard you get back home, and since it’s raining terribly out there, I was sure you’d need something tasty to lift your spirits.”
After a couple of moments of stilted silence, Seamus downed the last bit of his beer, and slammed the goblet against the table, “Speaking of memories, let’s have a challenge. I wanna know about all of your great memories of the people we lost in the battle. C’mon, to jog yer mind we should get walkin’. That way I can show you the dent I made in one of the doors with me head.”
“Alright there, Potter?” Draco doesn't turn, but Harry doesn’t miss the smile in his voice. He cranes his neck to inspect the contents of the cauldron,
“Well, I’ve heard you’re working with George on something. Must say, I never saw that coming.”
Harry looked perplexed at that. “So?”
“You see! I knew it was a joke. Shame on you, Potter, saying stupid things like that.”
Hermione giggled and flung her arms around him, Harry laughed as he caught her. He looked at Ron, who nodded in appreciation, and Harry answered with a smile.
“Like I was saying, not paying attention.”
At the far end of the Great Hall, another figure was keeping her eye on the proceedings, until her calculated gaze fell on Harry. She started marching in his direction, robes billowing out around her, pointed hat bobbing with every step.
“Please take your seats for dinner, sorting yourselves into your houses per table will not be necessary this evening.”
“Oh, well, I have a spare bedroom and a fold-out sofa, I’ll take the armchair.”
Ron’s eyes seemed to bulge as he looked at all of the food, “Blimey… As much as I love eating at home, nothing beats a good ol’ supper at Hogwarts.”
She nodded, and hugged him tightly, and so did everybody else, before they started to walk out of the castle, to where they could apparate.
“Hey!” Ron whacked him over his head, “What’s wrong with Weasley?”
Carrying his jacket and bag, Harry patted Ted on the back, "C'mon you rascal, best not get in trouble over a book about the intricacies of knitting a pattern of the Gryffindor lion into scarves." They all stepped out of the office, both adults chatting while Ted stared around with wide eyes, as if this wasn't his umpteenth time in the Ministry.
To Harry, Malfoy being nice to him, and himself being pleasant back, felt strange and unnatural. He was always so used to being on his guard around Malfoy, because he expected everything he said to be mocked. It seemed as though Malfoy had kicked that annoying habit. As if he could read his mind, Malfoy picked up the conversation on the same topic.
Ron, unaffected by the turn in the conversation, spoke up again, “Anyway, he’s doing some work with George now, but they only started a few weeks ago, as far as I know.”
He’d barely put the kettle on, after drying off and changing clothes, when his apartment door was knocked on. Wary, he peered through the peep-hole before opening up for his next-door-neighbour, an elderly woman by the name of Jean Cambell, a wealthy muggle who had known Narcissa well, though how such a situation had come to be was a mystery to Draco. Accompanying Jean was, as always, her soapy lavender scent, but today that was overwhelmed by the warm, comforting smell of hot lemon cake, evidently with raspberries beautifully decorating the top.
Refusing to let him downplay any more, Hermione resolutely held up her hand, “Save it, Harry. I’m no idiot, I do have eyes, you know. And I can see that you’re still not over each other, now even less than before.”
Upon closer inspection, his eyes hadn’t been betraying him; in the painting, was Remus Lupin, smiling with that knowing smirk on his face, and next to him was Tonks, laughing happily, their arms around each other. Unable to tear his eyes away, Harry scanned the rest of the painting. There was Fred, winking at him, and Lavender Brown giggling inaudibly, Cedric Diggory sent Harry an understanding nod, and he couldn’t help the tears that stung his eyes at that. Colin Creevey smiled brightly, Harry half expected the enchanted picture-version of him to produce a camera, but a sudden amount of light made him look up, shielding his eyes.
“If only hippogriffs could be driven off like dementors, eh? Save you from getting kicked in the arm again.” Harry laughed and patted Malfoy’s arm, who looked from it to Harry, then ignored the meandering thoughts in his mind. He didn’t mean it like that…
“Oh? I’ve heard you’re quite the Auror, Potter. Wasn’t difficult to guess that you’d go into the profession, but nonetheless, it suits you.”
They grin at each other, and if he could, Harry would have paused that moment in time, he would happily have stood there for hours with Draco, marvelling at the complexity of emotions that he felt whenever Draco was near. Whenever they spoke, always so candid and plain, and the feeling of being understood and understanding, even though he had yet so much to learn about the man that he’d known for so long but only just really met.
“Are you kidding? I was rather a mess. Couldn’t keep anything together for five seconds while I was here. Mind you, I haven’t much improved.” 'Shit. Why would I say that to Malfoy? Now I’m going to get it, big time. Anybody else want an invitation to make fun of my life?'
Several minutes later, Harry handed glasses full of smoothie to the people who were awake, now also including Luna and a miserable looking Hermione.
Harry decidedly shook his head, “No. Divorced quite a while ago.”
Harry doesn’t move for a few moments, but after a meaningful glance at Ginny, crosses the lawn, and finds Draco in the kitchen, standing over a cauldron.
Malfoy laughed, “Oh, Potter, you most certainly did.”
“Come on Potter, get up. You can stay with me tonight.”
“Right… What should I do about that?”
She rolled her eyes, “Oh Harry, you’re hopeless. Malfoy wants you. There, is that put plainly enough for you?”
You yourself were present during the Battle, and thus to you we extend this invitation to attend the Memorial of the Samaritans, to remember our dearly, inequitably departed, and their sacrifice for what they believed in.
Malfoy played with his cufflinks for a few seconds, pursing his lips. Harry’s mind was whirring, though quite slowly due to his intake of alcohol.
Scorpius considered this, then nodded, “Owl?”
“Oh. Great.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Erm... Beef and potatoes. And beans."
“Alright! Let’s calm the hell down.” Harry managed to bring the room back to relative peace, and had the attention once again. “Remember that we have Victoire’s birthday today, we should start getting ready to get to the burrow on time.”
Harry chuckled and let Albus run off after his brother, “I’ll sort it tomorrow, don’t worry.”
Malfoy nodded, “You just proved you can hold a conversation for more than a few seconds. Impressive. Not unalike to how you look tonight. I hardly recognised you. Well, the scar helped.”
“George and Fred,” Draco offered, coutiously, still unsure of how triggering the name was to Harry. To his relief, Harry just sighed.
In the house, Harry tucked James and Albus into their beds and cast a simple spell over the room as he silently exited it. When he wandered back downstairs, Ted was happily eating an evening snack in the living room, but the mood was doused in the kitchen, where Ginny was sat at the table, a cup of tea between her hands, an envelope in front of her, Hogwarts' seal pressed into the wax.
Ron’s brow furrowed “Where’s that then?”
He looked over at the suit that was hanging on the door, chosen for him by Luna for the evening's occasion. It was tastefully black, but was fleetingly highlighted in a deep red sheen as the fabric moved under lights. There was a black button-up and waistcoat to match, but no tie as Harry disliked the things. His cufflinks were miniature versions of Hogwarts’s seal in gold, the quartet of tiny gilded house animals idly flicked their tails and turned their heads, flapped their wings or slithered into a coil, enrapturing Harry as he held one of the cufflinks between his fingers. He put it back in the box next to the other and looked at the clock again; three past seven. With a sigh, he forced himself to focus on the document in front of him.
Harry pulled a face and settled his elbows back down on the table, “That’s what people said before the second wizarding war came along…”
Draco had walked over to look inside as well, “I suppose we can only find out…”
Harry held her gaze with a level stare, he knew what she was thinking. “Gin… We should-”
Re-focusing his glazed eyes when he heard the vague sound of a voice, as if he were underwater, he stared at the shopkeeper, who seemed to be getting increasingly nervous and confused, exaggerating the grey puffiness under her eyes. He tore his stare from the robes and turned heel down the street. His heavy coat billowed behind him as he kept a stiff march, passing through one street after another. His erratic corner-taking and sudden decisions to change direction betrayed the fact that a certain destination was not on his mind, but a lot of other things were. Rain now reduced to drizzle clung to every inch of him, he slipped more than once, but the water running down his face disguised his tears and the brisk walk was clearing his head, giving him a chance to think his life over in a rapid albeit less distressed way.
“Good on you both, and that would be great. Thanks, Malfoy.”
Seamus elbowed Harry, “Nah, she wasn’t. Remember when she said we should surrender ye to Voldemort, Harry? Right nutcase, that lass. Also, me mam says Malfoy’s got himself a son now ‘n all, but his wife was a bit of a gloomy person. Threatening to off herself, she was. In the end, they got divorced. Sad really.”
When food appeared along the tables, the remainder of the standing guests took their places, the four tables now all filled almost a quarter-way, with the Ravenclaw table being the most crowded.
“Blimey, Harry, did you never get home?”
“Fucking watch me, Malfoy.”
Some awkward laughter rumbled through the evening’s attendants, as everyone wondered where to take a seat in a flurry of low mumbles.
“Oh, well… She didn’t want to come tonight. Made up her mind the night the invitation arrived, and you know how headstrong she is. It’s sensitive, you know? Didn’t want to push her…”
Draco watched the bird from his balcony, leaned on the cold wrought iron railing, for as far as he could, which was until it disappeared behind some tall building or other. He’d send her owls often, maybe twice a week, and usually he would receive a negative response, one letting him know that Astoria just wasn’t up to see him. She didn’t seem to understand that she was not the point of his visits to the house.
“Kids alright?” Harry asked, after being unforeseenly almost suffocated in Ron’s hug.
"Oh, no, he's with Andromeda until tonight, they've gone to the seaside for a couple of nights."
"See you later buddy..." Harry stood up to shrug his jacket on, then ruffled Albus' hair and kissed both of Ginny's cheeks, "'Till tonight."
Ginny agrees and rouses James, leaving Albus to sleep while she gently hands him over to Harry, who takes both boys home after saying his goodbyes.
Harry sat up straight, “You don’t- Needing one isn’t the point, though. It’s an advanced spell, you have to practice it a few times before you can produce a full one.”
By circumstances, he meant his trainwreck of a marriage, that now had him so grim about life that only his son could bring him happiness, and as much as he hated to admit it, that was also something holding him back from bettering his life. He couldn’t go back to Africa anymore, not until Scorpius was old enough to understand why his dad was gone for several months, and waiting that long was becoming more unbearable by the week. Only recently had his new collaboration with Geoge managed to alleviate some of his hopelessness, but there was still so much about Alchemy that he had to learn, so much more knowledge to be acquired, if only he could travel back to his acquaintances in Africa.
“We have your dear friend Mrs Granger to thank for that. Since her changes came to the Ministry, a lot of house elves- or, elves, I should say, were liberated, and so ended up here, just as eligible for education as any young witch or wizard. The elves that formerly served in Hogwarts were offered positions as staff or places in class. These ones are the former. No need for dirty pillowcases any more, thank goodness. They like to make their own clothes now. Though I hear a shop has been opened for elf clothing in Diagon Alley.”
“Merlin’s beard, Harry…” Ron chuckled, “I spilled my beer that night and all. That’s a beer I’ll never get back.”
Malfoy's gaze that met his was challenging, 'Tell me I'm wrong again, Potter, and so help me-'
McGonagall’s voice cracked at that, and even from this distance, Harry could see the glisten of tears, she no doubt watching images of students and colleagues in her mind’s eye. One of the teachers stepped up and clasped her hand, and after exchanging glances, McGonagall continued,
Hermione sighed again, “Poor child…”
Minerva McGonagall eyed him up and down, “Yes, well… I suppose some things don’t change, do they?”
“Coming back to Hogwarts would have been miserable after the Battle. Epecially after I crossed the courtyard and seemed to join Voldemort. But we’re getting off-track. I finished a re-sit of the seventh year in Uganda, and I was taken on as an apprentice by a renowned witch. She taught me a few more advanced brews, but I wanted to learn more, so I ended up being referred to a different witch, and through her I met a couple of wizarding people who were all very obliging in teaching and even working with me on a few potions of my own invention, mainly against hereditary illnesses amongst muggles.”
“You’re quite misinformed Potter. You’re simply not paying enough attention.”
Harry and Ron laughed, and the trio chatted on, until a clinking stilled the conversations in the entrance. Everyone turned to face the far end of the hall, where a couple of teachers had gathered, professor McGonagall at the centre.
When he looked around the castle again, from where he and his former professor were standing, it was as if a lens had fallen over his world. Everything was eerily green-blue tinted, dusk-like in a way, and an ominous tone distantly rang, as if he’d just come back to consciousness after being whacked over the head, hard. Debris scattered the floor, holes were blown through walls, stairs and arches, the dust still hung in the air. Dark puddles and crumpled heaps; people, bleeding, their wands still gripped in their cold hand.
Knocking on the door to mimic a nursery rhyme, Harry took a step back when he heard the scrape of a chair and shuffle-y footsteps behind the door. "Good morning," he smiled, as the wooden door was swung open, something that was becoming slightly more effort by the day, because of the cascading deep green vines, entangled with pops of purple and bright pink flowers, which had grown down to hang in front of the door. He held up the bag he was carrying, "Brought fresh flapjacks."
He nodded sincerely, “Of course.”
“Same here.”
“And I hate to say it, but I think not. That table that you transfigured popped back up after just an hour of us sitting at it.”
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
“Perhaps I could give you a couple of names, I know a few people who… Experiment with spells. Funny you mentioned my work with George, because that’s what we are doing. Nothing as complex as metal reduction, just a few things for his business.”
“Aw come on now, I thought you might be a nicer person by now.”
When Draco caught up with Harry, all he could catch was something involving a hippogriff, and that Hermione had supposedly accumulated so much grief during the evening, that the mention of Sirius- Sirius Black, no doubt, had caused her to collapse into tears. Draco didn’t miss the ever-so subtle motion of drinking, followed by the less subtle pointing at Hermione and Seamus that Ron made to Harry, who nodded understandingly. When Hermione’s expression foretold more crying, Harry hugged her, patting her back soothingly. He stepped back, and she took a deep breath, and he smiled. Seamus, meanwhile, was crying onto Luna’s shoulder. Dean was behind Luna, trying to calm Seamus, while Neville was bringing his moral support to Luna from behind Seamus. Luna was being very calm and understanding about the matter, considering she was quite sandwiched and had a soggy shoulder.
CRASH!
Turning away, Draco sat at the footstool with the jewellery box he used to keep some of his most precious items in. They used to be antics, now all they are, are forgotten memories. "I-It was never my intention-"
"No, no Herm-Hermione, it's fine. I know my father is a bad man." He sighed, "Mother filed for a divorce this summer. Father was happy to agree." He rolled his eyes, "So mother and I moved to England." He looked at the three, examining their features, "I met Sirius, he spoke about all three of you. Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley?" He asked them and they nodded. Draco smiled at the two politely, and Harry was really surprised when Draco didn’t eye him in awe. It seems Ron had the same reaction because he looked at Harry while Draco chatted to Hermione after the introduction.
Landing at Malfoy Manor was more eventful and emotional than when Draco broke his arm in third year (yes, he did break his arm in third year. Maybe some over exaggeration, but it
"WHA!?"
But then coming from inside the hall was Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Snape. They swiftly followed the headmaster to the front entrance, Draco running to keep up.
“Ready to go Mister Malfoy?” Asked McGonagall. They learnt during the Holidays that, because Draco was not of age Lucius could not fully disown him. The Malfoy Lord could cut his accessibility to the Gringotts accounts and could deny him access to the Malfoy House it he had another guardian to care for him.
“S-s-sit down?” Large globs of tears swell in his eyes that flow quickly. His wailing was what Harry was most worried about however. He panicked on what to do- he’s only ever had to comfort Draco!
"Nice to see you too Pans." He laughed, quickly moving to Blaise to hug him too. Behind Blaise was someone he didn't expect to see. Dressed in a hoodie that reached his thighs, Harry wore black jeans and that hoodie was familiar to Draco... Draco blushed, recalling when he gave it to Harry and walked over to him slowly. Looking down at the floor, Harry only noticed Draco was there from the posh shoes he always insisted on wearing.
Before the insufferable git could finish, Draco stepped aside and offered Harry in.
When Harry returned home, he was exhausted from his day. The job was extremely tiring and all he wanted to do was snuggle up with his love for the night. Weirdly, the kitchen had no plates in the sink, no plate covered in tinfoil for him. In the living room, he felt something looked different, and it did. The coasters were gone as well as a photo on the fireplace. Maybe he was imagining things.
James- very sweaty, glasses askew and hair even messier than usual- passed the ball to his son, Harry- who was very sweaty, glasses askew and hair even messier than usual.
After dragging him back in, Draco, as gently as he could, lowered Harry onto his white leather sofa which went lovely with the shades of blue in the back all smudged together to make the night sky with bits of white as the stars that had pink shadows.
Now Harry stood, waiting for his friends. Outside in the cold. Where it began to rain. Just his luck.
As soon as Harry opened his mouth to speak, Draco had a book out in his lap, bringing his legs up to rest against the seat opposite. Desperately, Harry wanted to swipe the blonde lock that fell in front of his face away.
"Wicked..." he heard Fred whisper.
Burning is an awful way to go...
It was a casual Monday morning: waking up without Harry in their bed. What he didn't expect was Harry to Floo in at 8 am, with divorce papers in his hands.
"What? How?" Ron questioned- it was like he didn't see the danger of being an Auror.
"One: only my friends call me Dray, and, two: it does not interest me." He turned back around, continuing to walk.
"No, you're sleeping in my room with me-" His cheeks turned bright red at what he insinuated but his voice never lost its controlled tone, "-You will have the bed, and I will sleep on the settee. No arguments, Potter." Looking to the floor, Potter nodded.
"Weasley, we can hear you perfe-"
When they entered the shop, at the front was a foppish, handsome wizard with wavy blonde hair and particularly straight and shiny teeth. His clothing was trying hard to be regal with his flamboyant, flashy and incredibly flashy robes in a wide assortment of colour.
The rest of that meeting was a nightmare. Desperately, Harry wanted to strangle Dobby when he found out the house-elf had been keeping all of his friends food, presents and letters from him. Dobby said he did that because ‘If Harry Potter thought his friends forgot about him, then Harry Potter won’t want to return to Hogwarts...’ he tried to have a hushed argument with the house-elf, but Dobby managed to bash into everything then make a noise in the wardrobe trying to open the door when Harry had to talk with Vernon.
"What the fuck, Malfoy!" Exclaimed Seamus. All the rest stopper just shy of the barrier that Draco took down as soon as they came to a halt.
Another letter a victim to the abusing ambers.
An owl came earlier that day, that Potter would like to visit. Of course, he didn't send one back but had one prepared to be sent.
“Dray! Give them back!” He whined running after Draco.
his heart. He grabbed it with sharp nails and rough skin to suffocate it, then brainwashed the thing into thinking it was loved. Harry potter subjected his heart to Stockholm syndrome. And
“How have you survived in this place?” Asked Draco to Percy while gently running his fingers through Harry’s rats’ nest of hair. Unlike Draco, the raven-haired boy was able to block out the shouting and stomping of feet as he relaxed into a calm, completely deflated slumber.
He panicked.
Instead, when focusing on his emotions for Harry, Draco never felt so light and free and hopeful. Maybe that's why he decided to turn down the record deal. Maybe that's why he decided to get a new manager. Maybe that was why he decided to stay in England. And was the reason for his most recent song.
"Here we are, your majesty." Harry said, bowing. Gently, he took Draco's palm and kissed his knuckles. In front of the common room entrance.
Half of the petals had bloomed, just so the remainder of the them (the smaller ones that didn't bloom) joined in the centre like a very hipster, tie-dye shirt.
I was content I managed to apologise to the person I caused the most pain to though.
Never mind, the numbness will take care of it all.
He couldn’t talk so, Draco nodded his head smiling looking into Harry’s eyes. Guilt and regret filled them, which slowly whittled away as they fell asleep together in the sheets.
Honestly, we said no basketball, remember?"
It was midday that Harry was standing in the living room quietly. Aunt Petunia fussed over Dudley’s bowtie that Harry thought showed off how overweight his cousin was.
victory the tri-wizard cup!" Everyone cheered and whooped. That was, until the goblet grew another colour, spouting a new name. "Harry Potter? Harry Potter!" He announced.
"He's gone loopy." Whispered Ron so everyone but Draco could hear.
Molly pointed a finger harshly at Ron, “You best hope I don’t put bars on window Ronald Weasley.” Fred and George’s eyes widened looking down at their little brother who was red.
Putting his trunk up, Harry noticed the boy was already in his Hogwarts uniform, however, it rode up when Malfoy had to go on his tip toes to put the trunk in the compartment. Pulling something out of his pockets, Malfoy put this weird thing over his head and had circular orange things covering his ears.
Draco turned pink, "Th-thank you, Harry."
Hermione turned sheepish, "Oh... sorry, I'm still learning..." she tapped the French book but Draco still smiled.
"This, is Harry." He introduced.
“Do they have the story of The Boy Who Lived in France?” asked Ron on Harry’s behalf. Seeing through what Ron was trying to do, Draco turned to Harry.
The worst thing he did got Harry punished, throwing him and being locked in Dudley’s second bedroom. That was after he was lectured on how generous the Dursley’s have been in letting him have Dudley’s second bedroom.
Harry gestured to the seat, “Why don’t you sit down?” Dobby looked at Harry like an angel. His eyed went even wider and his head lifted like he was praying.
Back in the common room they partied well into the morning, because there was no Percy telling them 'Everyone to bed, NOW!'
“Mum, can you go with me please?” Asked the red-haired girl, knuckles white she was clutching at the bars to get cart so harshly. Molly cooed, agreeing and grabbed onto the cart, running at the walls with her. Behind them, Fred and George were messing around and Arthur had to drag them through after Percy had ignored them and went straight for the train.
Feeling eyes on him, he looked up to Harry. It was like he needed permission to do everything. "It's okay to eat, Potter. You can do what you like while nobody else is in the Manor, I promise." Harry tucked in, too: he barely ate a quarter of what was on the plate. Draco decided he'd slowly build Potter's stomach up again.
"I've never talked to a House-elf as goby as she is." He shook his head with a laugh.
"Certainly." She turned to Draco who was flabbergasted that worked so easily, "Anything else, Master Draco?"
"Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will..."
"It would be, erm... Great to uh- see you in Rav- Gryffindor! Great to see you in Gryffindor, yeah!" Harry stuttered, getting embarrassed by his mix up. On the other hand, Draco laughed, kissing the boys cheek and throwing the cloak over his shoulders.
"Howdy, partner!" One of the guys said to him, tipping his hat and had a straw in his mouth. It was so idiotic and stupid that Draco chuckled at it, then the person went away.
“I have to sadly decline Mademoiselle Brown, Monsieur Harry has already asked to which I had agreed. However, it is a pleasure to meet you, all of you ladies.” He dropped her hand and the girls swooned at him. Draco however, laced his arm in Harry’s holding his own hand of the arm through Harry’s. “Shall we go, Monsieur Harry?” Harry smiled at Draco’s words and walked out the door, still grinning at the blonde clinging tightly to his arm.
). "Fuck, Potter. You're so light." Whispered Draco as he slung Potter's arm over his shoulder like Potter was a lifeless voodoo doll. Dragging him to the closest sofa was a problem, as it was out the door and down the steps.
