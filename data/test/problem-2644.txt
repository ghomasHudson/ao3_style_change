Suddenly it’s September and Bertha is crying in Rita Skeeter’s lap, saying that if she and all her ilk like questions so much they should ask themselves where the hell is bloody Percival Ignatius Weasley, one eighty centimetres, blue eyes, red hair, glasses, no recognisable marks or scars, please. It is not fair that bloody Rita and Reggy and, sorry, I don’t know your name
Mort rolled his eyes. “Look, I will help you. But you have to think of something that you can sell to me”.
They would had seen a figure like the one in Harry’s painting, someone with a nimble foot and a mane of spun light.
Fred got up, blinked quickly and put a hand on the backrest of the nearby armchair until the dizzy spell passed. Then he looked for the symptom list and grabbed it. Harry passed him a quill silently as Fred dropped down on the armchair.
“Oouh!”
The last one had been very bad. Clubs had him vanished from the yard, with a broken arm and a few bruises, not to show his face there ever  again if he wanted to keep his ears attached. Ratty could consider himself lucky because Clubs had been furious, angry enough to have him killed on the spot. If he didn’t, it was most likely because Ratty made a pathetic figure, sobbing on the floor with his big ears and his too long and thin everything else. He had been called Needle, for a while, until spring came and he removed the wool hat and revealed an enormous pair of ears that hid everything else; the narrow face and the long neck and the stick thin arms.
Look, if you didn’t appreciate the existence of a whole gallery dedicated to clocks and watches, if you didn’t go and carefully examined each one and chose your favourite, what was the point of living anyway?
“Nononono. I mean, when did you— ?”
Voldemort. He thought he understood and he had hidden his real name, like folktales advise you to do, and chosen a new one for himself. And then he had forbidden people from even uttering that one, his second name.
Nobody really understand how, but Amycus Carrow becomes the new DADA teacher at Hogwarts. Every other candidate is either dead or missing or suddenly refuses to take the post when the previous day was willing to do it.
They spent the morning there, sleeping under a tree. Nobody from the Bureau de la Magie came to complain. Draco was gifted with three different cheeses and he was told that while he was welcome to visit, they would all feel better if they could take their dragons and leave soon. Somehow, Harry got to try some strawberries and he made Draco ask where they could get more on their return trip. Sirius had tasked him with baking the cake for his parents’ wedding and the strawberries were very sweet.
Harry had turned to Regulus because Kreacher was his in a way he never was Harry’s. Regulus’ tipping point towards his betrayal of the Dark Lord was the uncaring and cruel way he had treated his house elf. He should be the one to say what should be done, just as Harry had to be the one to dig Dobby’s grave.
Here is a mostly complete list of the gifts that Harry had received through his life.
“Hey Kreacher, did you sleep well?” he asked smiling as he crouched to look under Regulus’ sofa. The cold fireplace plus the tea set still on the table where Harry had left it last night meant that Kreacher was still in his makeshift bed. Good. Harry had had a lot of trouble making the elf take better care of himself, but that was to be expected. The surprising thing was that he had almost disobeyed Regulus a couple of times in his quest to serve him.
Luna at-the-door looked at Regulus when he spoke but Harry couldn’t study her expression because at that moment Luna-in-the-dining-room opened the door and peeked out, asking if there was really another her.
“Are you even listening to anything I say?” Draco sounded amused and comfortable.
“He was always right behind Hermione in marks, and they were both miles away from everyone else. You know Ravenclaws seek knowledge, but we are not very good students. We get distracted easily.”
Draco made a big show. He sighed and huffed and rolled his eyes as if he were granting them a big favour. He wriggled in his seat to take his left arm out of his sweater and nothing else. Fred hummed a song out of tune to make things more dramatic. At last Draco got his arm out and showed it to them, turning it one way or another before quickly hiding it back under the black wool. All in all it was only visible for three seconds.
And here Harry thought of a boy and of kissing him. Just holding and kissing and maybe touching his hair that looked so nice.
Also, Percy always did what he was supposed to: he washed his hands, cared after his siblings, got good grades and yet he was not the favourite son. This is all subconscious, of course, but he resents it.
had been once inside him. The coldness became detachment, as he stared at the black patch thinking of the small and the big evil. You didn’t need to be a dark wizard to make the world a dark place. Darkness could come from the dullest people living in a bungalow in the suburbs.
It wasn’t fear but it was alarm and danger. Someone was angry and impatient. Someone wanted to hurt, to inflict harm when before they would have been content with taking what was theirs and leaving oblivion and absence behind. Now they wanted to destroy, to raze, and to take, take, take.
Draco had complained a bit about Granger, as he insisted in calling her, but he had no real criticism to offer other than her mere existence and the fact that she was an insufferable know-it-all. Given that Draco had once spent fifteen minutes talking about the different names, shades and textures of the colour grey, and how there was warm grey and cool grey and something called
Harry passed him a glass of water. He didn’t have to say anything. He understood why having a wand was important but casting theory was
Oh, no, don’t give me that hippogriff shit.
I don’t really believe in this silly PPP program. I don’t think one can just let go of certain things. There is too much blood and hurt on both sides.
idiot which was the worst kind.
right at her, which made her jerk and lose her balance but didn’t seem to do much more. He had only seen that happen with giants, half-giants and dragons. People didn’t just shake off a
“Give me just a minute,” Harry said. Fred had probably intended to go alone, but Harry was having none of that. Fred still had a purple and yellow bruise on his head from the last time he went to the bathroom unaccompanied.
“We made fun of you because your father’s money got you on the Quidditch team, but you were pretty good,” he said standing up and gently pushing Fenton away from the bag. “Now, why are you all so tense? I don’t know if you noticed, but
Harry descended into a field slowly and got off of the broom. His hands were cold and pink, his fingers had wrinkled. He was short of breath and the air was too cold when it went through his nose and his mouth.
The interested party noticed this. Noticed that the ground floor was exuding the smell of tears and exhausted sweat, blood and bile and dirty clothes and a plate of food that nobody ate. It was the smell of death. Someone in there was dying or someone close to them had died.
In fact Harry would say that about a third of the books in the Black library were illegal to have now. Maybe more. Some books were preserved for knowledge’s sake but couldn’t be owned by individuals and Harry thought he might have a copy of every one of them, hot off the Ministry’s forbidden list. He had even found one that mentioned horcruxes in passing and he knew how rare that was. Any other time he might have stopped and read the entry, but at the moment he was task-focussed.
,” Fred cried. Again. He pouted and made the wand let out a stream of sparks.
But Harry pointed out that it would be much easier to keep Sirius alive if he had some extra months of freedom and he didn’t have to live as a fugitive and Ron was certain that they would be fine even if they changed everything. It wasn’t just their knowledge of the events to come, it was their knowledge, period, their experience.
Talk about non-verbal casting then.
“I know,” answered Harry. He was still holding the painting carefully because he really liked it, it was his favourite thing. He owned very few other things that he liked as much as this. The first sweater that Mrs Weasley had knit him perhaps. He smiled. He didn’t think he could stop smiling. “But I have amazing good luck. Here,” he added, handing Draco the painting.
“What’s your team?” asked Harry.
House”.
Three seconds.
about Percy’s secret activities, Percy might had fooled others, but not them!
“Don’t look at me like that, boy” Uncle Vernon had grumbled and Harry averted his eyes. Slowly.
“I can’t believe you would remember her and not Snape” said Draco as they parted ways. “I am sure I have spoken way more often of the
“Oh. Um. I can wait,” Harry said, even though what he really wanted to say was that it was Tuesday. Tuesday morning. This was not the time to request Draco’s company, and yes, Harry was aware he had done just that but he meant for a drink. What kind of lecherous pervert made an appointment on a Tuesday morning? Didn’t that person work?
“The thought is flimsy,” Harry went on kindly, because he also did that too, when a young Auror insisted on a hunch but couldn’t explain why. “Let’s make it sturdy. We will start at the beginning. Slughorn’s death. Why would he die?”
“Was he bad because he didn’t eat his vegetables?” she asked because being four she lacked a lot of life references.
The house was quiet though. He couldn’t sense anything. He padded to the door to his bedroom and then to the banister of the stairs and he still heard nothing. Luna had left a soft light on in the corridor.
Five minutes later Fenton was on the sofa, nested by Fred’s side and getting all the pets. His little black nose was leaving a small patch of dampness on Fred’s knee. Draco looked as if this had been the inevitable result all along.
Harry tried to think as little as possible of his time with the Dursleys. There were cans of worms and then there were tiny closets under the stairs with spiders, and nothing good came of either of them. He was mildly surprised to see that he had gotten good things out of it. Things that he could have learned somewhere else with a much better environment, but it was nice to see that the experience hadn’t been completely wasted.
He was saved from having to give a detailed account of yesterday by the nice funny fellow, Dumbledore, who said he was probably tired and didn’t want to talk about it, and anyway Snape had already given them a description of what happened after.
is some sort of stupid hidden joke, but Renata and Draco are above such childish humour.
“Oh, no,” Regulus said chirpily, tossing his hair over his shoulder. It was something he had picked up from Fred and Harry wondered if Ron and George noticed it. “It’s not about me. We just thought it might help with the shock if you saw someone else who had been resurrected first.”
He didn’t have any other belongings.
Twas the night before Christmas and everything was well for once.
“Like hell he is” said Crabbe the senior, looking down at Mort with his muggle clothes and hair.
“A consultant.”
“I’m just saying. The arms are too short. And that arch over there, it ends in a funny way. It should— ”
He stopped having headaches. Must had been the glasses after all.
“Is this how you usually conduct your Auror investigations?” asked Draco tentatively.
Harry laughed, long and loose. It was so good, listening to him laugh. Even if it was the nervous giggles you get when you are really past your bedtime. Like when they thought they should spend awake all of the night of New Year’s Eve, and the sunrise found them howling with laughter over the sound one of the squeaky cupboards made. They were both laughing now. It was contagious and freeing and the fact that they had to keep their voices down made it all funnier.
He did that, quick look up and amused smile, and grabbed the bag with the dinner. It shouldn’t be any different because he had taken food before; it was about the only thing he took with him. (Fred was bemused that anyone would reject an offering of firecrackers.) But it was different because before he had taken things that were going to spoil, things that had no use. Now he was taking something meant for him, he was sharing their food even if he didn’t stay for dinner.
“What’s this?” she asked once more. She had asked the same question fifteen times since they left Ernie’s grave. The Whomping Willow had merited seven minutes of close examination and a chestnut had been sacrificed so Eleanor could see the branches batting it away.
They might be able to do the same with Fred. If they said he wasn’t human they could argue that he was still entitled to certain rights. Werewolves could openly go to Hogwarts these days.
“Will it be safe?” he asked, full of youth and still, somehow, innocence. He asked like a child asks of his mother when they are afraid of the dark. “For the others, I mean. If I go there, will it be safe?”.
There was a series of blows that shook the ceiling and a sound that could be a cry for help or a scream of pain but that in either case sounded very much like Patricia.
This was Sirius, so it could be considered an admirable display of restraint.
There was a prophesy. Dumbledore didn’t want to talk much about it but one look at Harry’s perfectly still face, at his serene eyes, convinced him to talk. He was almost an adult anyway, he could stand the details.
The moment Percy saw on his vision was wonderful and he did well in chasing it, but when he clenched down on Oliver, when he felt the heat of his orgasm coming up and Oliver surrounding him and inside him, he thought that that moment was very nice too. Very nice.
The boy asks for a “get better” kiss and she cries but she also kisses him, and laughs and cries and kisses him again when he says that she better not be expecting jewellery, he was not going to be that kind of boyfriend.
“There, there,” says Oliver Wood, patting her on the head. He smells like a summer day.
“To be fair, he was mostly playing with Fenton,” Regulus said, eyes up on the flames that were about to touch the ceiling.
But Draco wasn’t returning. Nothing to worry about yet, it had only been fifteen minutes and he had said he was going for a long walk to clear his head. Still, Harry had an anxious knot in his stomach that was relatively easy to ignore because there was always some anxiety there. There was also a grip on his heart and lungs that was new, a shortness of breath when Draco wasn’t around.
Draco gave him a lovely judging look and an amused smile.
Thadeus Nott is your cousin too and just the other day I saw you hex him in the middle of Diagon Alley.
But of course the owl had found it, or so he seemed to say as he stared at Harry with his single yellow eye. He opened his beak to demand a treat.
“All day. I keep having this idea and then… it goes,” Draco said, biting his lip. It was annoying, certainly, but it was more than that. He looked frustrated and anxious, his face paler than usual and his hair in a ponytail far messier than Harry had ever seen. It looked almost like Harry’s own hair after all the times Draco had undone and redone his hair. “I don’t even know if it is a good idea because it keeps escaping me!”
some sort of influence in the house that was pulling them down and twisting their thoughts, much like when they had to carry the horcrux. It had been impossible to think about destroying it when they were wearing the locket.
“Well, Eleanor, it was your dad. He stopped a very bad wizard.”
“You look ridiculous” Draco informed. He probably wasn’t aware that he was nodding along too.
I already convinced Harry not to give that person a broomstick, so the hard work is done.
Dear Merlin, that was bad. Harry should go and put his head in the sink and drown himself. Draco’s initial surprise had given way to the more familiar amazement at how Harry could say the most stupid and outrageous things, so at least it didn’t come as a shock. Draco was used to judging Harry on many things.
“Twins, I swear,” said Ron, although he didn’t sound all that annoyed. There was a softness in his eyes that Harry knew came from seeing the twins back together and being ridiculous. Ron looked stupidly happy and at a loss because of it. He had spent years worrying over nothing in particular, just worrying over the state of his family.
on the others.
“Greek” Harry said absentmindedly. He went to the Museum weekly and read all the brochures, he knew the difference between an eromenos and a puer delicatus. Unlike Pit, who was making a big mess of History and Art Depiction to justify his request for sex. Harry merely nodded, too irritated to play along. He just wanted to get a straight answer about Ratty that went beyond any reasonable doubt. So far he only knew that Pit was a perv, but not necessarily the perv he was after. He did get another cup of tea and a muffin, though.
Harry helped Luna fix the meat for the thestrals, a couple of carcasses of old sheep from another farm. He watched her take the guts out and put them in buckets and was mesmerised by the image of the gentle blonde girl elbow deep in blood. Thank Merlin that she had a good heart, Luna played by rules of her own. She was one terrifying woman.
(No, Harry didn’t know either.)
They gave back the wands. Harry supposed he should attempt to fix the room, clean up a bit, but it felt rude, with Fred standing right there. Fred didn’t think so and was happy to show Harry the spell. Then Draco said that he was taking Fenton for a walk and did anyone want to join him.
Harry liked Draco, he wanted Draco, and he thought Draco might want him back. Harry liked Draco—he was sure of it now—because Draco was funny and sarcastic and intelligent and kind despite himself. Harry might have first entertained the notion because of a dream brought on by so much time spent together, but now he wanted Draco, all of Draco, for himself.
of bad things out there didn’t weight as much as the certainty of bad things at home.

Right before dessert was served Sirius rose to give his speech as Remus’ best-man. He spoke generously and unashamedly of Remus’ virtues and he peppered his speech with funny anecdotes, like the time Remus hid a grindylow in the Gryffindor dormitories (this prompted a loud “What?” from McGonagall) until two weeks later Kingsley made them release it in the lake (an even louder “What!?” from the same source).
Malfoy hit his forehead again. Good thing that he didn’t wear any rings. Also the foyer was very dark so Harry didn’t recommend banging anyone’s head against the wall in frustration because they might hit a previously unseen picture frame or more likely a desiccated troll head.
Where had he been?
“I don’t know. Is it red? Red seems less bitter than black but has more body than green.”
The book wasn’t particularly useful. There was nothing related to the situation at hand, nothing that could alleviate their suffering. Harry was still glad he had read it and had to admit that Malfoy had made a good choice. It didn’t give Harry a solution but he got something like a frame in which to put his ideas. Perhaps he had approached the matter naïvely because he was far from being the first person interested in Death as a topic and particularly in avoiding it. He
“Harry! Draco!”
But at last, it was night. She lighted a spy candle and put it on the bedside table while Lucius went quickly through the series of nine steps that would open a secret flight of stairs from their bedroom.
other people to take care of emergencies and a very nice dog to warn them if there was danger.
“Actual zombies!” murmured Piers Polkiss like one would speak of a pile of gold.
It had only been around half a year since he met Draco and Harry felt awaken. The past year had been necessary, a chance to truly rest and breath, but it had also been like living under permanent anaesthesia. And now Harry was rousing and noticing how lonely he had been, how removed from the world.
The shop assistant had been nice even before he realised he was talking to Harry Potter. These days Harry looked almost as wealthy as he was and that guaranteed a different kind of treatment. The assistant had shown him multiple owls and even some other birds of prey that he promised were the perfect fit for someone in Harry’s line of work. They were beautiful and had shiny colourful feathers and impressive beaks and, predictably, Harry hadn’t liked any of them. He had been thinking of a polite excuse to say no and leave when his eyes fell on Aeneas’s cage on the background.
From time to time he goes to a wizarding community and offers to do some chores or magic in exchange of goods. If a goblin woman sees him, she will give Percy a loaf of bread. He has no idea why they do that but it’s very good bread, so Percy is happy to take it. One time Percy met a male goblin and he gave Percy some salt, that he still carries with him. It is possible that for the last seven months Percy had been eating goblin bread and whatever fresh produce the Greek witches offer him in exchange of doing chores.
She wrote the acceptance letter after her usual model, and then she crumpled it and rewrote another one that stressed the fact that Harry was a wizard and there was a wizard society that would welcome him.
Bellatrix sidled to her, anxious to know whether they had the opportunity to imperius someone, to learn something for The Cause.
Harry had lots of things to say. About her research but mostly about the absolute craziness of her intending to leave everything behind and all the dangers they would be facing, no doubt, and that she obviously didn’t understand yet because you couldn’t until you have been on the street for a month. And she was muggle born, for God’s sake, they would go after her!
becomes one of the most popular wizarding papers. It starts printing special issues every two weeks with information on what is really going on in the Ministry and it is a nice comparison to the “everything is fine, this is fine, nothing is on fire” message from
“No. It’s fine. I am not otherwise engaged,” Harry answered stiffly.
It’s because of the Weasley cousin they never talk about. The accountant.
Fred bent down like a very old man. Harry would have jumped to help but he instinctually suspected that he shouldn’t. He had seen them at their worst and kept seeing them in a terrible state multiple times a day. He had seen them bleed and vomit and soil themselves. He had seen them naked. He had cleaned them and helped them dress and undress and generally been around during a vulnerable and embarrassing time. As easy as it would be for Harry to get up and pick up the paper from the floor, he was letting Fred do it.
on having him in the pub.
There was something devastatingly beautiful about watching Draco standing there naked in a room full of things. Almost as if he belonged in a painting himself. Harry let himself admire the view, the delicious line of Draco’s chest and hip, the curve of his arse, his leg, the way the light played with his hair, the white canvas of his skin and the colours of the tattoos. He was like the little sketches and paintings that hung around the room.
Harry was aware that he had collected and astounding amount of quirks and superstitions. He easily tripled Mrs Tarry in Ellesmere Road, and she was a firm believer of the chemtrail conspiracy and that a coalition of Jews and lizards was controlling the world.
Harry’s last day of work as an Auror had been on Friday, which was quite neat. Like your total coming to one galleon or exactly fifteen sickles. However, on Friday he was only required to drop off his badge and sign some papers so his actual last day of work as an Auror was the previous Thursday. If one wanted to be even more precise, Harry’s last day of work was a Tuesday two weeks ago when he gave his final notice and explained to the department Head for the third time that yes, he meant it, he was serious and they should take his letter of resignation.
“It’s just, the spicy bread is working, so why not?”
Not thinking about something was easy, extremely easy. Usually it was not because as soon as a thought knows it’s unwelcome in a mind it will dig its claws in. But Draco was breathing softly next to Harry, sleeping on his side. He had removed his hair tie and his hair fell loosely over the pillow and his back. He looked very different with his hair like this, relaxed and unguarded. Of course Draco should be relaxed and unguarded if he was going to sleep but beyond that he looked… at ease. As if he didn’t care if anyone looked at him.
. I would like to know. I think it would help me sleep”, he finished with a weak grin.
Draco went and made tea, probably because he wanted to get out of the living room and the strange air in it. It took him an inordinately large amount of time to get the tea ready and when Harry went to see if maybe he had had a tragic but hilarious accident in the kitchen (nobody trusted Draco’s ability in the kitchen) he found him once again standing in the corridor, head tilted back to look at the names on the tapestry.
“Oh!” Harry cried happily. Despite being mentioned in a prophecy, Harry didn’t really believe in portents and auspices, but the paper had brought what was undoubtedly a Good Omen.
Which was, to a wizard, like being castrated. Worse than being castrated, perhaps. Magic was what gave you a place in society and a reason to be there, to work and interact. Everybody knew that squibs were mostly useless. If you didn’t have magic you had nothing.
“And how are you?” she asked, sitting on the floor of the living room. She was wearing a pair of jeans, which was an unusual sight on a pureblooded witch, but jeans were very convenient when one was trudging in the mud in November trying to teach a herd of thestrals what could and could not be eaten. There was a smudge of white paint on her left thigh that almost resembled a group of stars.
Draco was giddy and smiling and in such a good mood that it made Harry wonder about his past life. Harry being happy with all of this was only natural, but Draco was used to a life of comfort and luxury. He had no reason to be excited.
. In their place someone had inserted blank pages full of annotations made with a clear and tight handwriting. List of names and places under a code that would probably only make sense to the author. Or to someone who was very, very, well acquainted with the less picturesque parts of London. Harry spotted many familiar names and even Draco figured out some of them.
You might wonder why am I even trying with this stupid notebook thing.
They didn’t know. They frowned at them.
“I will take you to your cottage and check how it is,” Harry said, coughing, “and afterwards I want you to stay with Ginny and her teammates for a few days.”
Until Olivia managed to get alone with Molly in her kitchen.
Draco did not get the new curtains he wanted.
How strange it was, to hear Luna speak of that mother who was sweet and caring and brilliant, to hear her speak of her relation to the Malfoys, of Lucius having a fit because he lost to his wife and almost lost to his cousin too.
Nobody could think about the interested party.
And he wanted to be liked back. He wanted Draco to like him for himself, if there was something that Harry could offer. He didn’t want the crumbs of affection brought from days of cohabitation during a stressful situation. He wanted more and he wanted it to be real.
Harry forced himself to shake the sleep away; he couldn’t believe he had woken up merely because he was
“Oh, dear, that was everyone’s reaction back in the seventies. But it was still popular. We loved a good scandal back then just as much as we do now”. She laughed and winked.
“Draco, stay outside, please,” Harry said in a whisper. Draco was looking at the scene over Harry’s shoulder. He had his wand ready, at least, which was a good instinct even if unwelcome at the moment.
. They had an article on wendsing sightings in the Ministry and they all know that was just Rupert leaving the gent’s loo. There is a need for proper reporting and so new media has sprouted. This is good, except for how the journalist are camped by the Winzegamot door.
asking what happened and I explained some of it. I am much better with letters, I don’t put my foot in my mouth so much.”
“What do we do?” screamed Fred, followed by another wordless scream as he was swept off his feet and dragged towards Quinn by a thick iron chain. Even now, wounded and in pain, Aetius Quinn didn’t lose sight of his objective.
Although it might be a gift too. An offering.
The worst, however, and evidently Malfoy agreed with Harry here, was the blood coming out from Fred’s eyes. Seeing the white stained with red, the tracks on his face like tears of war.
Now the silk sheets were all Draco, because Harry was pretty sure he had never felt silk in his life. But if Draco wouldn’t notice the change, Harry was not going to point it out for him.
“Thank you, Fred. I think only fresh blood works, but a very small amount is enough.” He patted Fred on the hand. They had had dinner already, but Harry was thinking that he might prepare them both some hot soup of water and spicy bread. He didn’t like how pale Fred was. “If Draco hasn’t cleared his head, tomorrow evening I will take him there.”
Eleanor listened to all this pleasantly. Children have a very particular sense of justice and it all sounded good to her. They also like hearing that they are safe.
Fred had no idea. He told the notebook the differences he had seen between the two Lunas and that it had been freaky.
He had a point; what he didn’t have was the words in order to get there. He stared at Malfoy’s ponytail for lack of a better place to look.
“Stay back,” he hissed again. From where he was Harry could see that the dining room was empty. There was a big pile of debris, parts of the big table and the chairs, and something could be hiding in there. He wanted to check the living room first, though.
“A coat,” Harry interrupted. Draco had used the tone Ron used when Harry bought his books for Hogwarts or the Auror Academy, Ginny’s tone when Harry got her her first professional broomstick. The tone of, “This is too much and I couldn’t possibly accept it.”
“They are going to give you an Order of Merlin, 1st Class”.
offers to swear an unbreakable vow to share Weasley’s whereabouts with Bertha as well as any and all information gathered, as soon as it has gone to press. The others follow suit and Potter says magnanimously that he bears witness and their word is enough for him.
“Pit”
“Well, I had to go out and buy some new towels and many pairs of pyjamas,” he said, certain that the reason would be obvious now. Blessed Luna had come yesterday evening to take care of the boys so Harry was able to run some errands. Getting the books that Malfoy had suggested and also the urgently needed clothes.
He didn’t know that someone else had noticed the disturbance in the Veil.
The house barely had any furniture and was supposed to be just a momentary safe place. Good enough to hold two people without too much discomfort. It was certainly not prepared to house eight.
“One must remain always vigilant”
Harry erased it, but it left behind a light mark on the wood and the letters could still be read. He had to try two more times before he got the whole area to be the same colour.
“I tell everything to everyone” answered Lee happily.
The purple vulture hopped twice as Luna exited the barn, wings still spread to their full span. Its eyes were still red, its pupils white, its beak strong and curved so it could tear bone apart.
Draco was sure the elf, Kreacher, hadn’t talked to anyone in his life. People
It was a cheese.
, glared at each other while Hermione explained in quick burst of words that they wanted to help and she had some ideas on how to defeat Voldemort, she had been doing research, you see, and she had been talking to Dumbledore…
He didn’t. He sat back and raised his eyebrows when he noticed that both Harry and Draco were looking at him intently.
She put the snake around her neck, letting it burrow under her clothes, and turned to Harry.
Regulus looked at his own wand as the same time that Draco turned to him and nudged him, telling him to try something.
Remus Lupin couldn’t say when was the last time he had eaten meat, but he thought it must have been in Hogwarts. His abrupt departure from the school still caused a little ache in his chest, but it was nothing when compared to many of the events in Remus’s life. Ache or not he felt he had gained more than what he had lost in his stay at the school.
ooOoo
And then he did something.
Fred drank of his cup, slurping, and pointed at Harry. “Or his face.”
Regulus and Fred took a nap after lunch, with Fenton’s help and supervision. The nap was interrupted when Regulus woke struggling to breathe and vomiting blood and Harry fell in the familiar pattern of offering help. Draco materialised on Harry’s side, jumping seamlessly into the routine, handing handkerchiefs and towels and glasses of water as soon as Harry reached a hand for them and before Harry said what he needed.
Harry lifted his hand.
in his hands.
“It is very much like the real Fred,” Harry said, “and at least he didn’t draw a pile of poo or a farting arse.”
months which probably have something to do with his enthusiasm for the let-Draco-kill-me plan.
Next were the cuts, which should be cleaned before Harry closed them. Some fortifying potions were in order.
Wow. So she was a drug addict with horrible friends and even worse life habits, but that girl could sing.
“This is my wand”.
Three more steps and he would be in the dark corridor. The dark cluttered corridor so Harry was taking them all the way to their sofas.
Fenton looked like he knew, but hadn’t been able to resist on account of being a dog. Draco called him to his side and Fenton went, tail between his legs and ears hanging sadly.
. No one was mad enough to actually
“I know of a place” said Draco. He had been looking at the sky constantly, and if they weren´t holding hands, he would have walked in to a lightpost twice already. There was an unusually high amount of owls crossing the sky, considering it was still a couple of hours before dark. “It may be safe, or, well, safe from them”.
was one to talk).
The knife drew a thin line of scarlet on the white neck. She cried in pain and choked as she repeated Harry’s name.
Few things were clearly established on that meeting. The horrible nature of the Dursleys was one of them. The necessity of keeping Harry near a blood relative was another. The certitude that the protective spell had faded was the third.
“Oh, come on. He has an illegal wand.”
The only time it seemed like there would be a problem was when the Puddlemere was scheduled to play against the Holyhead Harpies. Ron didn’t know what to do and who he was supposed to support and seriously considered making a surprise visit to Charlie.
By day three she has successfully stolen the rat Scabbers from the Burrow. She was going to switch it with a real pet rat, but it escapes and she can’t go chasing the stupid rat. Then she begins a ten-days terror program on the Longbottoms. Footprints on the flowerbeds, upsetting the warding charms on the doors, definite signs of tampering in the chimney… Augusta Longbototm is many things, but she is certainly not a fool and by day four she is at the Ministry demanding help form the Auror office. It takes five freaking days for them to send a couple or aurors down. Narcissa is incensed on her behalf.
Maybe one of them would say that the hip-opener postures were more challenging for men. Maybe the other would point that the substitute teacher, a twinky young man with very big eyes, loved handstand postures but that neither of them was a fan. They both liked their heads and neck were they didn’t run any risks, thank you very much.
Harry spoke before Fred made the suggestion. “I am not opening your grave to check if your wand is in there.”
. As if his words and his decisions and his wants were something worth listening to.
The problem was that Seamus

Bathroom window it was.
There was something he wasn’t saying, something Malfoy hadn’t said. It had only occurred to Harry now as he hurried to get the door and knocked over the firecrackers and a flowerpot. Harry could just vanish the clutter. The moment he had brought it home it had served its purpose and Harry could just make it disappear, erase it.
“No appetite whatsoever,” said Regulus, still sitting upside down. “For humans or human food.”
There was a Dark Lord, a Sith Sauron wannabe, with a fascist blood purity discourse that wouldn’t go very far. Not-Marco agreed. And, again, it seemed like Harry was another example of its fragility, because there he was doing magic while muggle.
Harry read and worked and went with Draco to every free exhibition and every discount cinema. And also, he went to a Trivial Pursuit competition at a pub (it was a good opportunity for Draco to discover new topics to ask about) and won a radio.
Draco left. Luna came. Harry cooked dinner and got the kitchen in order. He fell into bed feeling exhausted both in mind and body, especially mind. It took him a while to fall asleep, as if his brain first needed to unload the many images and thoughts he had accumulated through the day. Purple feathers and red eyes that seemed more friendly than Voldemort’s, Rodolphus’ sullen face, mouth permanently down and face badly shaven even though they were allowed toiletries. Soft and white skin in contrast, surrounded by a halo of silver and gold. The ruins of a high and proud place, forgotten and conquered by vegetation. How good it was that a tree would grow from a place of desolation.
. Lots and lots of books that were certainly inappropriate for a young, pretty, pure-blooded witch such as herself. Hell, some of them were inappropriate for old ugly wizards. Some of them were written by
Harry is moved from the third ring to the second, linked with rainbow chain to Draco’s portrait.
Harry laughed because it
It felt so underwhelming, after the terror of a minute ago. The street was quiet and dark. It was cold. There was no one there.
ooOoo
of was that he wasn’t sending Aeneas, though. He wasn’t risking his stupid owl on the ire of a monster. Instead Harry looked around the drawers in the library desk until he got some official Ministry paper and envelopes. It didn’t have enough magical strength to go by itself from Grimmauld Place, but if Harry dropped the letter by the entrance to the Ministry then the envelope should find Quinn by itself, flying on the mail currents that were at work in the Ministry.
“I want to go,” said Draco. He was clutching the napkin hard.
At the end of the game Draco even brings an unexpected twist so Surreptitious Snake’s character can be incorporated to other storylines. He is still a bad guy, but not so bad that he must be tricked into falling down a volcano, unlike His Darkness, the true villain of the story.
Even after the fire, the thing that used to be a clown is still twitching. Eddie leans down and grabs its heart (gross) and rips it from its chest making a soft “gloup” sound (extra gross). The creature dies.
The usuals didn’t like the occasionals because they dumped prices and took the clientele.  They made a very close circle, so if you went there and didn’t have someone to speak for you, you would be left outside to pick up whatever work scraps they left. And they rarely left any. Harry had actually received lots of free advice and offers to set him up because he was always polite and had pretty eyes and talked to the girls and the boys with casual easiness. He had declined, though. He was doing well enough so far and he already felt like the street was taking too much of him to go and sell some more. He feared that he could end up being a different person, someone made from all the absences in Harry’s life.
“I know the story, Potter.”
Harry was short of breath. The cold was close to painful. The paper he had wrapped the painting in crinkled.
And Pansy was scared. Terribly scared. It would had been better if she kept chasing Ginny because she was sure that with Ginny she would not experience this fear. With Ginny, Pansy would still have her armour intact.
“Oh? And I am in dire need of help?”
And Harry comes back. Draco forgives him for risking his live just for having said that line.
is a huge success, but there are quite a few traditionally inclined wizards who don’t appreciate the liberal editorial line and write often to complain. Draco takes all his savings and opens a second paper,
Meanwhile, Snape has developed the habit of twisting every conversation so he can say “pity you don’t have any other orphan available to sacrifice” and “oh, if only we had a child to endanger” and “yes, but how can we solve this by killing a child?”.  It is very rich coming from him. Dumbledore is not amused. Apparently there is a line for Severus Snape and that line is drawn when sacrificing oneself for the greatest good.
Then, two years after the birth of
Draco lifted one hand slightly, palm up. Harry put the letter there hesitantly, not knowing if he was reading the gesture right. Draco took it and turned around without another word, closing the door behind him.
“You might have noticed that the room didn’t burn down.”
“The night you, the night you escaped. From the house,” said Draco with a calm voice. “I took my broom and went to the village and ate three cornettos. Strawberry, Classic and Mint. They had run out of pistachio.”
“I can’t give them their brother back just to see him die in pain.”
Neville spent the next few years feeling rather well if slightly melancholic at times. His parents were doing well although they were not fully recovered and they would never be. He was free from his grandmother’s influence and he had even gotten to a place somewhere near cordial with her, although not close and affectionate. To say the truth, Neville didn’t think he had ever loved his grandmother. She was too strict to allow any love to grow.
Just to ask. A few more questions and he would let it rest and go to sleep.
“Err,” Harry began. “I just came to give you this. It’s not, it’s not that great. I mean. This doesn’t make up for it, but I thought you would like it.”
Draco finished his tea.
All this went in beautiful parallel to the motions made by Harry, who was now staring at his hand clutching the awl with a mix of fear and surprise.
“Oh my god, it speaks. Hello tiny person!”
But Percy doesn’t care about that or any other tropes because he is exhausted. Winning a war is a tiring job and he was doing more than winning. So, as soon as Voldemort keels over and dies, Percy checks that his family is alive (they all are, good job there, Percival) and he makes himself a portkey and goes away.
Then the door opened and Draco was there, dressed in washed-out jeans that had atrocious cuffs and a blue t-shirt, looking beautiful and pissed.
on Harry. As if he hadn’t shaken his world and told him something he had never heard. Despite his youth, there was little that Harry hadn’t seen or heard before, but this was certainly it.
There had also been Ginny, and trying to make it work and seeing that it wouldn’t and desperately fighting to at least keep their friendship and mutual understanding intact (one of the few things that had gone right in Harry’s life). Plus there was all the added effort of maintaining friendships when they were all doing different things with their lives. Not to speak of the nightmares and that dreadful sensation that had taken residence in Harry’s stomach and that had a lot to do with feeling alone and like he never really mattered to anyone, that he was only a tool. That feeling had only gotten better recently, but also worse; less present but more raw when he felt it.
“I really have to go,” Malfoy said as he entered the library. He walked down its length quickly, eyes on the tall shelves and hands slightly up and open mirroring his stance when he had studied the family tapestry.
“To know what these are”.
Honestly, Draco didn’t know.
Charlie Weasley had already jumped down from the dragon and was knocking, or perhaps
“Muggles who know what they are doing. Why don’t you just focus on helping her with the farm and pay someone else to do it? That way it would be finished quicker.”
It is, and Potter looks adequately taken aback at Irene’s fury and exhaustion. He keeps coming every day because Potter is punishment incarnate, but at least he brings chocolate flapjacks with him. From time to time he has some useful comment like “Malfoy says the Ipswitch attack was Bella Lestrange” or “Malfoy says Gibson is too stupid to be
“Daffodils,” said Fred. He also put a foot down as if he were trying to stop the room from spinning.
So Lucius packs up his things and leaves the country quietly.
“It may be best if we do not attempt to bring him in” said Snape, to a riot of voices (and death threats from Sirius). His voice had been just as cold and calm as always, undisturbed by Sirius presence. His eyes, though, had a turmoil in them.
They might not have worked as a couple, but Harry still loved and admired her.
Draco danced too. Supposedly to show him how it was done.
Besides, this was Luna, not Hagrid. She didn’t have animals that fed on humans around.
What Draco saw was a hairless creature reminiscent of a house elf that had been enlarged to fit a teenager body.
My throat hurts.
It was a compromise. They would both leave things behind and they would both have to adapt to a new country, together. It was fair, logical, and very sweet. Hermione had said yes and moved to Germany and Harry wished her all the best even if he felt a bit lost not having her close.
Now, the Mirror of Erised. Harry had gotten the philosopher’s stone because he didn’t want it and that was more on track. Still, the whole idea about reverse action curses came because, from what he had read, the harder people tried to cheat death the quicker they died, often in gruesome ways. This was all interesting and probably very edifying, but the cheating act had been performed already. Fred was alive in Harry’s living room reading softly to Regulus and making funny voices. What Harry needed was something to work as a fixative.
They shared a look between all of them.
But the announced breakfast was true. It smelled like coffee and eggs and beans and toast and Harry’s mouth was watering.
And colour, so much colour. He didn’t know how Draco had endured his stay at Grimmauld Place because—with the exception of the library—the rest of the house was dark grey, dark blue and off-putting white. The white in Draco’s house wasn’t off-putting or sad, it was a base to allow the colours to shine without competing with each other. It had the same elegance, the same artful purpose and measure as Draco’s tattoo.
Someone gave a small step back.
It turns out everybody wants to see a baby bat so Harry takes them to Grimmauld Place (not too far from their house, they can go walking) and shows them the baby bats currently living under his stairs until Luna can find them a new home. Then, of course, the girls are busy staring at the family tree tapestry (Draco! You are here!) and soon after they are in the living room floor making a family tree of sorts, although rather than family blood lines the girls are following a complex system of rings and vines in which flying ability and coolness are the defining factors, hence why Oliver Wood and Charlie Weasley have the honour of being inside the first ring.
Andromeda was a bit too much of a presence. He made his excuses soon after and went down to the kitchen. Harry had mentioned during breakfast his idea to cover their trace from werewolves and other creatures and Draco wanted to be prepared.
“I have some muggle pens,” he said without turning around. Fred had had a small seizure and Harry was helping him through some exercises to check if he was recovering well. He thought that his left eye wasn’t moving as it should. “They are blue.”
“Aha. Well. This was certainly an interesting reunion,” Malfoy said, pushing his chair away from the table. “Let’s do it again in ten years. Good luck with your thing.”
. You have to use noble materials”.
It was good, but it wasn’t easy. At times it was tense and emotional and suffocating and almost everyone had to excuse himself at some point to go get some fresh air and gather their thoughts. And that wasn’t even accounting for the war between Molly and Fleur.
bad. Saying that she was as bad as a murderer meant that a murderer was as bad as a petty and cruel teenage girl. That Garner who had killed twelve people was as bad as she was; that Walden who raped a muggle woman before killing her in front of her wizard husband was as bad as Parkinson who cut off Padma Patil’s hair.
So he handed in his resignation letter and he was firm about it and spent his last two weeks writing very detailed memos so his replacement would know what each case was about. On Friday morning he went to hand over his badge and sign his discharge papers with at least three different departments. His farewell from the office had been… tepid. Not cold because he was still Harry Potter Saviour of the Wizarding World, but not particularly full of warm wishes either.
Some will say that Death is about balance, that it requires one life for another. It might have been true at some point but not anymore.
“Just answer me this” Professor Lupin went on, gaze still firm, “Are you all right? Do you need anything?”
Someone, either Regulus or Draco, casted a blasting curse that smelled strongly of pure alcohol and was charged with anger. The air trembled around it as it travelled down the corridor and went past Quinn’s head.
People still didn’t know what Lee’s radio show was supposed to be about, but there was sudden and permanent increase of trivia about plants.

“We had lunch together yesterday.”
Harry closed the door again.
“Your knuckles are red,” noted Draco. “And swollen.” His eyes searched Harry’s. There was that curiosity that was Draco’s downfall. That need to know and understand even if he would later judge and mock.
Meanwhile, Harry took Draco to the museums. He spent ten minutes staring at the
Olivia had crawled under the kitchen table.
They met by the corner that led to the exit and they took a handle each of the trunk.  The closest tube stop was Euston, but Harry insisted that they ought to take Angel instead and Draco had given in without a fight. Angel sounded right.
“Please!” she said, and Harry had to close his eyes and keep the tears there. She called him again.
“He set him on fire” said Lucius. They hadn’t spoken much. There had been too much to do. Running, hiding their trail, sending a warning note to Andromeda, leaving false clues for the deatheaters, for Bella, gathering some supplies, disguising themselves and ensuring no one saw them get on the boat. They barely spoke, but when they did, that was a recurring thought. Lord Voldemort on their ballroom floor, screaming as his face burned.
Harry extended his arm, stopping Draco from coming inside. “Can anyone tell me,” …what to ask? What to ask and prove it was really them? “… something interesting about Draco?”
“We have two representatives of Hogwarts. Mr. Tiberius Angustifolia, president of the Board of Governors for the last six years after Mr. Sweepington passed away.”
Regulus pursed his lips and nodded. “Yes. Yes, I do. Draco doesn’t seem to cling to bad things. Doesn’t mean he won’t punch you next time he sees you,” he added as a warning but Harry didn’t mind. He would take a punch gladly if that’s what it took for Draco to stop being angry.
“I am doing fine”.

Harry laughed, a short and ugly snort, but a laugh nonetheless and he was taking it. Even if it came from bloody Draco Malfoy teasing him, Harry needed that laugh.

He didn’t dare say it aloud.
It’s after New year. Ron wanted to visit Percy and Harry went with him because he had appointed himself as Peace Keeper. He even has a badge and a plastic sword to hit people with in the head.
When Lucius proposed to her, she almost said no.
He just hadn’t seen anything.
“You think that’s enough?” Quinn grunted. He was pale and his clothes were stained with blood but the wounds from the second
“I think I might— ” Harry began. “I don’t know. There have been so many people in this house. But Rebecca’s husband was Perseus or Pluto or something like that, right? I think I have a napkin of hers then.”
“HEY YOU” bellowed Godric before anyone gave him a reason not to. A few of the firebirds shuffled and rose their heads.
“I…” Harry faltered. There had been so much venom in the word “save” that he didn’t know if he was supposed to say yes or not. “I don’t want you to be hurt,” he said at last.
too and she doesn’t look at the wizarding world too kindly. If I ever again come back home feeling down for something you did or said, or, Heavens forbid, if you ever make me go home crying: she will kill you.” Olivia made a small gesture with her shoulder, not even a full shrug. “She has done it before, during the war. Mulcier and Rosifer, or something like that. So she knows how to hide a body.”
That was a new sentiment for Harry. Privet Drive had never been a home, no matter what Dumbledore and his love blood magic said. He loved the Burrow dearly, but even if he felt comfortable and welcome there it was still the Weasleys’ place, not his. Grimmauld Place was just the place where he lived and although he had made many changes—the most recent one bringing light to the foyer via removal of ceiling—it just wasn’t a home in the way Draco’s small bungalow was.

said a voice in Harry’s mind.
could do quite a lot of simple magic beyond the parlour tricks he had witnessed. Nothing too big, but big enough that he should have been detected by the Ministry already. Which led to the conclusion that he must be doing something else, something way more powerful than heating water or colouring stones to make earrings (seriously, the guy had no sense of colour or elegance, Draco could do so much better). However, he was suddenly remise to any more confessions, and Draco couldn’t find out anything else.
Wasn’t it obvious? Draco said that he had gotten a teapot because he liked the shape of teapots. That was the clue to unlocking the rest of the riddle in his arm.
at any minor movement. Like the day after doing lots of exercise, which he supposed was the case only the exercise had been mostly involuntary.
“When everybody thought my brother wanted to kill you,” said Regulus. “You said there were dementors in the school.”
There was a shiver making its way through the deatheaters. Draco saw the shine in his aunt’s eyes and felt like he would be sick. The worst was looking at Mort, well
That again! There was no bitterness to it, but that again!

“Well if it is not too much bother” he answered airily, which Harry had learned was his automatic defensive response.
“Will you talk to me?”
“We are talking about Hogwarts” reminded David softly “and the changes in the school.”
But that wasn’t enough. It wasn’t right for them to walk away. It wasn’t right and therefore there must be a hidden wrong.
Like everything about her, Luna’s pack of thestrals was different. As much as people still liked thestral-pulled carriages, she wasn’t sure she wanted that for them, not if she couldn’t make sure that someone would talk to them and they would be treated properly. So she wasn’t raising them for carriages and for now she made her money from the by-products. Hair and fur and feathers and manure. The winter spiders she might sell to a Herbolarium, where she knew they would be treated well, but the thestrals were staying here.
Fred didn’t wake up. Harry didn’t know if he should wake him or not because sleep should do him good but he had been sleeping for a long while now. Then Fred turned around, almost fell to the floor (great reflexes there, Harry) and had a seizure that lasted five minutes. He pissed himself and Harry also found blood between his legs.
The interested party didn’t know of Harry’s involvement. It knew, they knew, that Harry had been acting oddly for the last two months and that this oddity had increased during the last week, but nothing else. The interested party preferred acting on knowledge rather than intuition, but the truth was that intuition had a lot to do with their behaviour. Intuition had pushed them into hiding their name and presence. Intuition had called them to the Room of Death that Friday at midday.
This led back to the first complain, that there was no power because its sudden appearance would draw attention. Plus, Mort didn’t know how to connect it back. And if he did, someone would come to disconnect it and he would find him squatting there.
Although, to be fair, not everybody was saying that. There was a female voice that shut down the comment quickly and even used the expression “Shame on you” which Harry had only ever seen in literature.
Since by then they had both grown used to the loud music and the smells and the fights, Harry was fairly surprised by this reaction and the finality with which Draco spoke. It wasn’t the offer of booze and drugs that altered Draco so, although he declined both and had admonished them against consuming any kind of drugs without looking in to the manufacturing process and knowing their exact composition. Because, who knew what could be mixed in there? Were they following a proper hygienic protocol?
Ten thousands words later, look at who deigns to appear.
He refused them all. Oliver was very supportive of his decision of not working ever again. All he asked was for Percy to consider growing his hair long because Oliver liked playing with his curls.
After putting a pillow over his face and hitting himself repeatedly Harry got up and went to the bathroom to get a sleeping potion. It had been a while since he last needed them, thank Merlin, so the potion had a bit of a dense texture. But it should work and send him into a dreamless sleep; it might not be very restful but honestly, given his state of mind and the long talk about wands that morning, Harry didn’t want to risk it. Wands had a very obvious shape and it was a matter of time before he came up with something.
There was someone on the street yelling and throwing spells in the direction of the house. More than a someone by the number of lights ricocheting over the Fidelius charm. He could almost make out the words of a female voice screaming “I know you are in there”. That was enough to wake him all the way, but then he though he heard her call for Lucius, which made no sense because A) his father would never take refuge in a house with such a dreadful wallpaper, B) full of Dumbledore’s sycophants, and C) the Malfoys had other residences, anyway. The one for grandfather, where the older relatives went to live after a new generation took claim of the manor; and the one in France so the younger generations could get a taste of the continent, and he would be surprised if his mother didn’t have a third location somewhere discreet.
Eleanor took a chestnut out of her pocket and balanced it on top of the gravestone. Then she sneezed so Minerva took her hand to lead her back to the sun.
The dragon had a long chain. Long for Harry, but short for the dragon who could barely move around the room. There were deep scratches in a small area of the floor, the further point the dragon could reach.
It was good. It was very, very, good. They were going to very happy in there.
It was the beginning of the second-to-last month of the year. Just like nineteen is almost but not quite on the verge of change, too old to be a child and too young to be an adult. November is too cold to be autumn but too early for winter.
(Which, it must be said, were formidably ugly. Sirius couldn’t understand where did they get those shirts).
Harry had sudden difficulty swallowing. He knew what Draco had meant, oh how he knew.
“He was also the Head during the first war,” Draco said slowly, his gaze lost in the green glimmer of the lake.
. Draco was right, people always forgot the last part.
Harry hadn’t stayed for the reveal to Ginny and Bill, hence the much deserved howler. Ginny used to be his girlfriend, he should have been there for her, but Harry felt too empty inside.
and the current date. They even added some letter grades in Charms and Care of Magical Creatures based on the few words they had exchanged.
to go after Dean.
He took a pouch from the drawer, soft dyed leather with silk lining inside.
Percy had slowly accepted that he had to put on clothes in order to not  catch a cold, and he almost always left the house fully dressed now. Going back to work was another thing. He didn’t want to. He just didn’t. He couldn’t stand the idea of being back in an office, reading and writing memos. He said he had some savings and he could always find an old rich gentleman and be his kept boy. Oliver was actually two months younger than him but he was happy to fill the role and keep Percy forever.
But he knew none of that. All Harry had was the intuition that an abstract someone coming from the Ministry might attempt something.
The City was an anthill full of people, but even ants go to sleep at night. Grimmauld Place was in a residential district that didn’t see that much movement throughout the day to begin with. At night it was quiet and still. More so in the nights of almost winter when it was cold and it rained a miserable drizzle. Nights like this you wouldn’t even find a late goer returning from the opera or the cinema. Tomorrow, now, was Tuesday. People didn’t stay up late before a Tuesday.
century when the floo network was starting to develop, some lady of the house had decided that climbing stairs and going down the corridors was not an efficient way of moving, especially when one had so many things to do and hearts to break.
Harry didn’t know, so Draco dumped half of each in the teapot.
Ok, it was more like two and half.

How their lives had inverted, hadn’t they? Harry had been the poor orphan boy for years while Malfoy strutted around the school like a silver and diamond prince. And now, look at it, now Harry had a problem that could be fixed with money
“I knew him pretty well, though,” Harry bit back because the argument was patronising. “I knew him when he came to defend Hogwarts. I knew him when he died there.”
Last time, Dumbledore had apparated with Harry atop a rock in the middle of the ocean that overlooked the cliffs and the cave in them. Harry remembered how dangerous the sea had seemed, how big and devouring, especially for a boy like him who had never properly learned to swim.
From an outside perspective, the curtains, the windows, the façade of the house didn’t say much. But the interested party was, well,
But he didn’t say anything this time and he gave Harry a calm look. Then he bent over and kissed the top of Fenton’s head.
And on a certain day in December, certain people, not everyone but a long list of certain people, could come and get a cup of ice-cream for free.

and that someone had not checked properly and failed at his or her job.
On Christmas Eve Percy goes home and he is yelled at, cursed at, cried at and loved, very loved, it’s embarrassing. He is rescued from the madness by Potter who easily admits he has been fuelling the newspapers infatuation with Percy because that way they left him slightly in peace.
Dinner was good. Hot and salty enough to take away the bitter taste those thoughts brought to Harry’s tongue. Luna had said it was from a goblin café in Diagon Alley and everybody had taken a step back, but it was actually pretty good and even Regulus and Fred had tried a bit.
Besides, if Mort ever fell sick again, he would be much better prepared to brew him a cure.
He had quite expressive eyes. It was probably thanks to the brows and his magnificent frown, which was voicing his opinion about the little plump woman who kept chattering about how it was most likely a little juvenile prank and had anyone checked at Hogsmeade? Surely he had sneaked there. Or perhaps he was ill and his parents simply forgot to send an owl letting them know. They would receive it tomorrow for certain. Nothing to worry about.
They only had the one mattress over an old box spring, but after that first, wonderful, excellent round, the mattress was suddenly inserted in a big wooden bedframe with solid and clean lines. Draco would have gone with an art deco style, so it had to be Mort and wasn’t it great, knowing that
Nobody knows if Ollivander was there.
1.- He can draw. He might have more or less practice, but he can draw pretty well.
Harry was very proud of being able to present eggs and tomato and sausages to Luna, toast and bland cheese for the other two. If Kreacher’s absence hurt, it wasn’t because Harry was lost without him, because he needed a servant, but because of the grumpy house elf himself. He could live without Kreacher, that wasn’t the problem.
big reveal that Harry was asleep inside a crystal coffin in some witch’s garden. He actually went to visit said witch, because Dumbledore was adamant that they didn’t dismiss any theory. The witch was friendly and offered Remus plenty of tea and biscuits, although she refused to lift the blanket that covered the box in her garden.
That is fun to write!
“How did you know Sirius was an animagus?” Harry asked a while later, when he felt better.

the girl, not unless she absolutely had to in order to get Ginny’s attention.
The list of symptoms. Creased and soggy on the lower left corner and filled with different handwriting. Harry’s quick and clear and small so he could fit lots of information in little space and still be readable, Luna’s round and big and a bit loopy, and Malfoy’s too.
Luna had shrugged it off because Luna shrugged all failures off. She had thought that it would work because they had seen some small success with the spicy bread. It didn’t, all right, they would try something else.
Ron is a man now, and adult, and he is kind of freaked out at the shenanigans they did when they were merely children. What were they thinking? Was there no competent adult to point out that they were kids? It shouldn’t be up to them to rescue Sirius or Buckbeak, what in the seven hells.)
Harry checked the windows and door for damage, a little notebook trailing after him and hovering near his head to write down whatever he said. Time of the event. Spells casted and their effect. Any words the fake-Luna had said. Anything she had touched.
Ron had a room all to himself, a room he didn’t have to share with anyone, and he didn’t know how to sleep in it. There was no older brothers, no Gryffindor friends, no Harry, no Bill or Fleur or Ginny walking by because he was actually sleeping on the couch.
They never tell you how it rots your teeth.
Since evidently Regulus and Fred were having trouble with typical human food, Luna thought that maybe the thestral’s diet would work on them.
Harry tended to agree. Until a few years ago goblins hadn’t been allowed to ride on the Knight Bus, of course he wasn’t going to like the law.
Draco did not move. He did not move as Pansy Parkinson, pale and pretty and proudly sporting her Inquisitorial Squad badge as well as the prefect one crossed the wall into 9-3/4 platform.
twice but the bottom of the pot remained black; the food had probably fused to it.
Some, like Luna, seemed to have apparated without house-elf help which everybody agreed was impossible but not particularly unusual in her case. She walked around with Ginny closing the eyes of the fallen inferi. They weren’t inferi anymore, she said. Now they were just dead people.
“All right,” Harry said again, more firmly. “Tea. Biscuits too, if you can stand them. And I am going to rise the lights a little bit.” Harry did just that, lighting a couple more candles with a tap of his wand. Kreacher was either fast asleep in his nest under Regulus’ sofa and Harry shouldn’t wake him, or he was doing something he was forbidden to do like polishing the bronze decorations on the balusters. Harry didn’t want to stress him out with yet another talk about duty and how caring about your own health is also a duty, Kreacher, for Merlin’s sake.
Eventually he reveals himself to Ginny because she is screaming incoherently at the sky and Percy thinks that she might be suffering hypoxia and dehydration. Ginny throws the water bottle at his head.
Of course, you will say there is far more blood on my side. And you will be right. So, why even bother?
So Draco did. Everything he knew and thought about that colour and how it turned up in surrealist art more than people thought and also in Tolkien’s descriptions of elves, which was surprising because everyone defaulted to green, but he had said grey too. Which took him again to his theory that nowhere in the book it said Legolas didn’t have auburn hair, and that’s how he imagined him.
Potter, unfortunately, does not have a photogenic face (he tends to look like a sad lost deer in all pictures) and all the attention stresses him out. Draco offers him a mutually beneficial deal: Draco will take care of the press for him and Potter will stop the Ministry from returning the manor and his fortune.
It was a nice piece. One that Draco hadn’t expected to ever sell.
“I can’t! I…” Harry had to stop and begin again. If only Malfoy weren’t so difficult Harry would have been able to explain everything in its proper order and Malfoy would understand Harry’s point. “You know, maybe you haven’t seen it, there is this stone arch in the Department of Mysteries.” Malfoy lifted both of his eyebrows slightly. He probably already knew what Harry meant, but he still made him say it. “They came out of it, from the arch I mean, in the department. And the Unspeakables there, they are really grabby and jealous. They will seize anything that falls under a category susceptible to examination, even if it is needed in an ongoing investigation.” There was a lot of resentment in the last few words.
Harry didn’t immediately call after Malfoy. It would be understandable if he did, if he cried “Malfoy!” and began to run, but it would also be very stupid. Evidently Malfoy didn’t want to talk to Harry, so Harry wasn’t going to give him a chance to run or apparate away. It was better to follow him and shorten the distance between them without being spotted.
By the time he was fourteen, Harry had gained just a few centimeters, quite a measure of muscle and experience, and he had lost his name. He was universally known as Green in the yard, not because of his eyes but because of the bright green bag from the Language School he still carried around. He was Harris at the Falafel King because it hadn’t occurred to him to give a fake name until the moment Kaleem asked. In Cricklewood he was Christopher, which was long and Christian and the folks there loved to call him “Young Christopher” and applaud his initiative to bring some cash home and engage in honest activities rather than demand alimony like kids these days.
He told them all this while Luna coaxed the magma snake out of the chimney in the living room where it had taken refuge during the panic. It was taking her a while. She almost had it until Aeneas decided to help by jumping into the fireplace and hooting.
Harry wondered how had he let it get to that point. Malfoy had turned around once more and was walking toward the patch of darkness that was the main door.
Harry wanted to take him, to hold Draco in his arms and never let go, but he was still holding a valuable painting under his arm so all he could do was sneak an arm around Draco’s back and hold him close. He kissed back with the same ardour and a warm feeling bursting out of his chest.
It was hot and she didn’t particularly like the sand or being under the sun, but she could work on it. She got herself a long white dress and put on sun lotion, being extra careful with her nose, cheeks, and the back of her neck. She went and sat herself under a shade.
His heart was beating madly and his hands were sweaty, but the terror had abated and he could swallow now without feeling like he would choke on his own heart. They had been so close to disaster… but now they were out, in another room, still in danger, but away, away, away, breath Draco, breath.
All was well. She could sleep in peace.
So it was understandable if Draco’s disappearance, while worrying, was featured only briefly in the discussion. Mostly they thought that he had been pulled out by the Malfoys, who no doubt had some inside intel of something that was about to happen.
Draco had no idea what was happening and it was giving him anxiety. He wished Mort were here but at the same time no, he really, really wished he didn’t show his face. Maybe this was instinct magic kicking in but he felt like it would be better, safer, if no one knew about Mort. Better keep Professor Lupin distracted, then.
“You should have called me, Harry,” Ron said somberly. It hurt him that his best friend hadn’t called, but it also hurt him that he might have done something to make his best friend not call. Ginny had called him an idiot a couple of times already and Percy had said nothing, because he never did, but he had given Ron one of those looks that said he was acting like an idiot and he knew that Ron knew it.
And then, and then! Oh! Harry couldn’t deal. Harry wasn’t a social being, all right? He had literally grown up in a closet under the stairs. He was not made for polite society. Not like Draco who knew how to stay cool and indifferent and polite at all times.
follow tradition. Mum was very happy when she thought of my name.”
Harry had barely moved and his shoes were already full of sand. He didn’t like sand. He put a bit in his hand and looked at it while he let it fall slowly, thinking how he could use sand in a duel to annoy an enemy. Maybe just a blast of sand, coarse and gritty. That should throw anyone off balance.
Seriously, rest a bit before starting this chapter.
On Sunday morning Draco checked out of the hotel. He bought himself another pastry and went to King’s Cross to get his luggage out of storage. He dragged his trunk all the way to platform 9 and…
“Nevertheless.” There was an honest apology in Ron’s voice. Harry hoped he remembered the sentiment in ten minutes.
The library was the only good room in the house now, even more so since Harry had moved his painting there, so that’s where he retreated. The big desk was still covered with papers and books about death and resurrection which Harry began to move aside to make a bit of space before giving up and switching to the small desk by the window, the one with all the drawers. He sat there and wrote a letter to Hermione telling her everything. Even as he was writing it he found himself taking notes on a separate sheet. Harry was only now beginning to realise how in depth and extensive his research into death had been and he thought he should at least write a small guide. Someone somewhere in the future might find themselves hosting a recently resurrected friend and they would surely appreciate having Harry’s notes. He already had two pages on food alone.
The voices now came with a feeling of curiosity missed with caution, but nothing of the hot panic Harry had felt before. Harry looked at the blonde boy, still staring with an indignant expression. He hadn’t made any sense except for the tiny strange parts where he did, and Harry felt like he was missing a huge chunk of context. More importantly, he didn’t look dangerous.
The letters were from Sirius, but it seemed that he had become a sort of vessel for everyone else. He wrote, in his stream of consciousness style, that Weasley (Ron, but to her Weasley meant only him now) had found a muggle novel about chess that he would be glad to lend her once he was done with it. Attached was a picture of Harry and Draco playing in the garden of their house, both with green stains and happy eyes. There was also a list of Hogwarts professors who had said “not me” when asked about stepping to her old position of Deputy Headmistress. A star next to the name indicated they had also touched their nose when saying it, which brought a page-long rambling about integrating muggle customs and how Remus was being very close minded when he refused to accept nose-touching as an excuse to avoid helping with the laundry. He also noted that Sybill’s name was not on the list, in case she wanted to take it under consideration.
not-Marco didn’t like his answers. Apparently, vague feelings and voices that weren’t really such did not count like proper magic or, according to him, like anything that made sense. The hiding was better, because it had a practical side as well as the emotional one.
And that was it. The book didn’t say another word about it. Nothing about what happened later or who was that wizard and why people didn’t flock to him asking to repeat the miracle. It did say where it had happened: Nievoldhagen.
And then they get to Percy Weasley, loyal collaborator of Thicknesse’s Ministry, suspected Death Eater, BLOODY UNDERCOVER SPY FOR DUMBLEDORE. WHAT? Bertha goes all the way to the top floor of the Ministry, crosses outside, and screams for a full minute, scaring a couple of pigeons. Then she realises that she can’t remember when was the last time she was outside, so she goes home walking slowly and blinking at the white sky.
and make things less painful. Right now he didn’t know if his attempts to fix it weren’t somehow cruel. There were moments when he believed so.
Draco open his grip on Fenton’s collar and allowed the dog to get to Harry. Harry immediately crouched and patted the dog on his neck, head, side. He was a really nice dog and he ought to be petted and patted everywhere. He still had really cute ears.
Harry couldn’t say what exactly had been it. It was not the discovery that Dudley would be receiving a pair of boxing gloves for his birthday, with what that entailed. It was not being fed for dinner a bunch of vegetables that were about to go bad. It was not having to vacuum the house and do the dishes and ending up with no time to do his homework and hence getting disapproving comments from the teacher the next day, as well as enduring the laughs of everybody in the class.
They apparated away soon after and Draco went back to bed. Harry hadn’t moved at all, but he smiled and scooted closer when Draco returned.
Molly didn’t learn about it from Percy because Percy and Bill got distracted and went outside to shoot fireworks with the twins. She did learn about it though. Harry spilled the beans in a desperate move when she heard about a certain killing curse that left a big scar on his chest when he was fourteen.
If Harry had managed not to hex each and every one of them, he could negotiate Malfoy’s price if he had any.
“Draco” he said right away, so at least they would be spared the game of
Since the three of them were there Harry got started with cooking some rice. He also began the process of casting
Malfoy pushed away a couple of bottles with his foot and stepped over a box that had turned over. He looked meaningfully at Harry but said nothing, obviously tired of reminding him to clear the foyer.
a joyful thing. He would like to visit the place someday, he told Draco, and salute those two women. Draco smiled and it was nice and tense in a good way.
“She had the hots for Voldemort,” peeped Fred, always helpful in filling people in. He had a bit of toilet paper in one of his nostrils.
Draco was confused.
“I have with me Caecilius Frenzen, from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”
It started with the awkward tense silence. Even people in other rooms of the house quieted down, as if attuned to the general mood in the living room.
“Draco go awaaay”
The mind lets you in.
was torn and tattered and hardened, like a piece of fabric that has been left too long to dry in the heat. But once the spell was gone everyone was free to come to the house and it was good, it was a sign of the times changing. Besides there was a lot to rebuild and Harry was glad to be able to offer a bed to all those who needed it. Now the only thing preventing entrance to an outside agent was the door and the common charms that every wizarding house had.
All his life, Draco had heard Lord Voldemort was high, Lord Voldemort was great, Lord Voldemort was the most powerful wizard in existence. Probably surpassing Dumbledore himself since the old fly had never dared confront him face to face.
There was a general bristling in the room because nobody liked hearing that someone had picked on Luna. Draco seemed to be of the opinion that his family relations and his status allowed him to be a bit of an asshole, but no one else had that privilege. He even muttered that Luna might have taken years to accomplish proper hair care, but she was accomplished in many other things.
Parkinson had spent a year and a half in prison and two years on probation and could count herself lucky. Harry thought Parkinson was a bitch, and he didn’t use the word lightly, but she was not a Death Eater. Harry had seen Death Eaters up close before, during and after the war, and it was insulting and demeaning to compare them. Was Parkinson a bad person? Absolutely. Had she abused her power in the last year at Hogwarts? Harry didn’t know, but Ginny said she did and he believed her. Did she deserve to be taken down a peg? Oh, yes.
Malfoy went to the end of the sofa, grabbed a cushion, and carefully slipped it under Fred’s head while also turning the head to the side. Spit and foam slid down Fred’s chin and on to the faded cushion which had an embroidered pattern of leaves and birds.
ooOoo
Fred scooted over and grabbed Regulus. He grabbed him, like a doll, and pulled him towards his chest. Even sick, Fred still had quite a few pounds on Regulus. He was shorter, though.
He had knocked on the door and saved a lot of energy and all James Potter got out was a few warning words before he died. He hadn’t even had his wand with him. Just a few words and nothing else was all that stood between Voldemort and his goal once the door was opened.
People got angry when Percy didn’t want to give them a prophecy. After a time he started to give a blank prediction of swollen noses and bruised faces and egos. Oliver and his team were happy to carry the words of the prophet into action.
Percy Weasley looked very disappointed. He hadn’t been invited to the wedding, but then again, neither had anyone else. The only actual legal guests were Teresa and her family. Everyone else either didn’t need an invitation because they were vital parts, like Sirius and Harry and Draco, or they had simply come when someone informed them of the wedding.
But Malfoy was good-looking and Harry was seeing him daily
Aeneas returned the next morning, just as Harry was finishing showering and before he went down for breakfast. He hadn’t realised it yesterday but he had ended up sending the letter a bit late at night and Aeneas was far from being a fast owl. He was in fact quite slow, so the letter might have arrived
“Maybe tomorrow.”
If he had any problems with his work, it was long before and after the mission. He had problems with the policies that dictated who and what to prosecute, and he had problems with the punishments. Not that they weren’t doing good. They were chasing bad people for sure. But sometimes Harry thought that they were going at it sideways. That if only they implemented certain policies earlier, they wouldn’t have to do the chasing and arresting later on.
At first it seemed as if it would pass, but the retching brought real nausea and soon Fred was vomiting a yellow liquid with a pungent odour that was little more than bile. Harry was happy to say that he had had a washbasin ready so everything was contained. He was less happy to notice red specks in the vomit. Fred was bleeding.
Really, nobody was going to buy that. He could just as well pack his things and talk to Draco.
Harry stopped, breathed twice and sniffled. “What will happen when
you went in, got measured, tried a few wands and once one of them chose you, you paid and left with it.
It turned out that the British muggles had different ideas about who should rule the empire.
He stopped brusquely, sharply, the heel of his right foot raised in the air in an aborted step, his left hand extended for balance. His hair was long now, longer that his father’s had been, and he wore it in a ponytail that was messy from the struggle. It reminded Harry of something, but he wasn’t sure of what.
Draco’s face did something strange, attempting half a dozen expressions at once. Then he sat next to Harry. “Nah, that’s all right” he said while looking through the papers in the coffee table and grabbing the most recent newspaper, dated from two days ago. “Don’t’ want to ruin my surprise”.
Harry made a sound like he had had a seizure of his own. At least he managed to keep that comment down. It was enough that later he threw himself into a long ramble about how he looked bad in black and how much better the uniforms of other schools were.
“Your wands.”
One or two might have taken a second to answer, a second for a fleeting image of a dark figure to vanish from their minds.
Twas the night before Christmas and the house was quiet and still, all the inhabitants burrowed in bed. But it was a new house, the wood wasn’t settled and it creaked and groaned. There was the strange smell of new paint and new wood and new everything because they had lost it all and had to get it new.
“Someone from the Ministry came and he told him that he was on a bender,” said Fred as they got inside the living room. He was sitting at the end one of the sofas holding a newspaper. Regulus was lying next to him, a cold towel over his face. He waved blindly at them in greeting.
ooOoo
Malfoy ignored his red eyes or the fact that he had taken such a long time to go to the library and back. He had served himself a mug of tea without needing persuasion and had Regulus and Fred chewing on their respective slices of toast with tasteless cheese.
“Who are you?” he snarled.
He was elated at getting it back, that feeling of rightness when you heard a good song. And Draco’s presence, drawn to the room by the melancholic and eerie melody, that was good too.
There is no feeling like the skin of your fingers touching that wood again, the light weight of it in your palm. The rush of power coming back to you, seeping in your blood. You feel a pleasure unlike any other. No food, no cool drink in the heat, no release inside a warm body. There is nothing quite like it.
“I don’t see any problem with it,” Regulus said. He was lying down on the floor, applying pressure to his wounds as instructed.
It probably wasn’t an
The next time Harry woke up it was sometime before eight. He was feeling reasonably rested which these days meant that he was tired but not terribly so. He heard Luna singing downstairs, not well but not badly either, so things there were calm. Harry could indulge in a hot shower, maybe even properly washing his hair with care products so it would be shiny and bouncy.
Harry ignored the noise and focussed on the task at hand. Regulus was bleeding. Fred had a big bruise under his eye that was swelling quickly. Luna was the one who didn’t stand up so she needed the most urgent care.
Every time he or any of the customers complains, Draco smiles a cheap version of the smiles he used to give Voldemort and vows. Sometimes their words sting and sometimes they break against his armour. He lives in a weird state between immunity and pain.
or something,” added Regulus.
So they went through one of the kitchens. They couldn’t even relish the fact that they were running through a kitchen, just like in the movies. Too tired and focused on putting some distance between them.
And one of them they spent celebrating.
He hadn’t actually told not-Marco to become a fellow homeless secret wizard, but he
“Do you… just… How exactly do you know what you are doing?”
People didn’t like that, but on the other hand he was extremely hard to insult. Or make him feel insulted, that is. Plus, there was something serene about him that was contagious. A certain sureness that things would turn all right, an air of knowing something you didn’t, that perhaps your worries weren’t so.
had nothing to do with this and is very far away.”
. How would you know?”
Bellatrix Lestrange comes very close to murdering Hermione. Her scream, as she sees them escape, rings in all of their ears for the whole duration of their trip around the Circle line. Seven times they go by, and it is only after the fifth that their shoulders begin to unclench.
“Could I have some tea?” asked Draco which was an achievement because he never asked for anything. If offered, he might accept tea,
They eventually calmed down and Draco rose to make dinner. Professor Lupin had merely pointed at the fridge and pantry, understanding quite well they were not ready yet to have anyone else touch their food. Sirius had sent a house elf by the name of Kreacher upstairs, too, before they entered the room to give them extra privacy. Harry’s face had moved quickly from delight to disappointed resignation at missing the elf.
“Yes. Your memory is intact, I see. That’s wonderful.”
By the end of the week, Draco was completely in charge of the Designing & Making Crafts operation while Mort was Chief of Security and Performance Lead. Grocery Acquisition and Preparation was a shared operation with multiple points of contention and careful negotiation.
ooOoo
Harry went to Diagon Alley to buy Draco a coat. A good one that would keep him warm and dry and that could be cleaned easily because Draco appeared to pick the muddiest places to take Fenton for a walk. He thought about going to muggle London because Draco did seem to prefer muggle clothes now, or neutral ones, but in the end Harry went to Diagon Alley and got something in dark green with a hood charmed to keep the wearer dry. He wasn’t sure about the size, but the assistant gave him a receipt so it could be exchanged.
She showed him some sort of scarf knitted with candy wrappers. Ernestina said it had been done by Alice and that she liked doing things with her hands, they both did. Ernestina had thrown some costumes over the couple and let them out on her back garden where they spent the mornings, while she had to work on St. Mungo, caring for the plants.
Regulus was nodding. Somehow it was an ominous nod.
There were people still looking for him and no street kid would pass over the opportunity to make some quick cash by ratting him out. He thought he had caught a glimpse of one of the two men from the crosswalk, asking around near Soho too.
However, no matter how serious Harry was about finding Malfoy, he had other things to do first. For starters, he should get dressed.
The one with short stories only contained the afore mentioned short stories. Some paragraphs had been marked and underlined, but with second hand books it is hard to know who marked what.
“It’s a girl,” Regulus said firmly.
“I can go down to get some breakfast” Draco offered, although he made it sound as if he would have to dive in a piranha infested pit to fetch them tea and sugar.
“There seems to be quite a lot of redhead wizards. I wonder if there is some genetic predisposition”.
“Let’s go for dinner” Harry said, and after a quick glance to the shoes and the coat of the guy he added “you are buying. You may ask questions, but only if you answer my own”.
Mort lifted his head from the table. He was deep in the mind numbingly boring chore of sorting coupons and planning finances. Draco was happy to cook dinner while M figured out the money.
“When exactly did you learn to do this?”
Oh, indeed. Harry knew who she was.
But! Remus had also spent nine wonderful months with hot meals and wolfsbane and he had started to lose the chill from the street. It had given him the chance to save some money for once in his life. So, no, he wasn’t going to complain.
“Fred.”
Draco’s response, however, was unexpected.
“I don’t dream of him either,” Regulus said. He looked very pleased to have his tea, although he still hadn’t tasted it. “I don’t know why. I was close to him and he was terrifying. Handsome like a devil, I will give you that. But terrifying.”
“She is a bit more than that,” he said as his feet touched the floor. The worst had passed. “She is a great duellist and a successful Quidditch player and a very good friend.”
“If you are absolutely sure,” Draco said, following him inside.
“That turns into crab cakes when attacked,” he suggested.
Since he stepped on London, Harry had gotten so many offers that asked for nothing in exchange. Free! No obligations! They would offer a place to sleep, some quick cash, food, just a bit of a chat, the word of Our Lord, just some honest help from a good fellow.
it would be Suruchi’s turn. Minister of Magic, ten years. Would successfully see the process of lifting the Statute of Secrecy (it was going to happen, she had seen the month of panic when those pictures of
ooOoo
Come Monday morning he had dragged himself out of bed and to the kitchen to get some pumpkin juice, and right then and there he had decided that clothes were something that happened to other people and he refused to get dressed. Then he had filled a second glass of juice for Oliver and gone back to bed.
don’t forget my mistakes. Why would any other?
Draco claimed to know, though.
Still, they were alive,
and still have strength to disapparate without a wand.
At the end of the course, Severus resigned of his position as Headmaster and Minerva McGonagall became the new Headmistress. Severus went back to his position of Professor of Potions and Head of House since Slughorn had been retired and it was only Albus’ machinations that brought him out of retirement, something that Horace kept reminding to everyone. Minerva still had to find a Deputy Headmaster or Headmistress and a new professor of Transfigurations, and a Head of Gryffindor House, she supposed.
And maybe they, he and Harry, will meet someone who is also afflicted from Hanahaki. A war widow perhaps, dying of sadness and longing for the person that was taken from them. Draco would say, rather rudely, to stop mopping and get up and be happy because they owe it to that person who died too young to be happy for the both of them. Harry is appalled at his bluntness, of course. That was terrible, Draco. Show some tact.
Sirius was well liked by the family, is the point.
Harry had meant going to Museums and feeling good with yourself when you read how bad people had it in the Middle Ages or how advanced the Romans had been. He didn’t talk often about that (fitting in and all that) but it turned out that both Venus and he were always on the lookout for cinema promotions no matter the type of movie, so they had met a couple of times outside the job, so to speak, and got talking.
to buy him a new pair of glasses. Wouldn’t that be nice? Really, Pit was a lovely man and he deserved some love in return.
It turned out that Harry
“Mr. Dumbledore…”
Ah, yes, yet another Death Eater Harry had duelled and defeated. Not during the Battle of Hogwarts, he had been busy with other things then. It was when a few Death Eaters escaped detention while awaiting trial and there was a two-day panic before they had them all in hold again. Indirectly, that became Ron and Harry’s default admission to the Auror Academy.
Just, what was one supposed to say to that? Fred was looking at Harry with a lost expression, silently begging for help. Neither of them knew what to do, what to say.
“I really like being outside,” Regulus said, flopping down on the blue backless chair. He lay there like a puppet with cut strings, long legs on one side, head and one arm hanging loose on the other. “I didn’t know that I liked it so much. I never noticed, at Hogwarts.”
“He had the sun behind him so he thought that Ron wouldn’t cast blindly.”
“My room smells weird” she said, knowing that Ron would be awake.
I’m doing it for someone else. They think it will work and I am sure it won’t.
No appetite either, but Regulus got two exes while Fred had just one on account of Fred being able to eat some spicy bread on occasion.
But Draco wasn’t. He would take care of things, just as
Draco thought about it.
When Kreacher returned, Harry was in the library cursing himself for not making a decent catalogue of the library books. Since yesterday morning he had had time to find six promising books that later proved to be no use at all. He was now making slow progress with the seventh one which, quite fittingly in view of current events, had been banned for the last half century and could only be stored in institutional libraries.
“Even muggles can use them. There are regulations about it.”
They practiced all morning until Regulus was able to say his piece without looking like he had food poisoning. Harry understood his nervousness, but he was also pretty sure that it would go well. Even if Luna rejected him, she would be very kind, and he didn’t think she would reject Regulus.
ooOoo
This isn’t Draco’s story, even though he played a big part in it.
lonely.
“Hi,” he said to the bird. It extended its wings and flapped them twice.
It comes in March.
He started working Friday to Sunday on the street markets. He had no license but by then he had honed his senses to the point that he could tell whenever a cop was setting foot on the street. Why, some of the other less than legal traders learned to keep an eye on him to know when to fold and leave.
Harry wondered if they missed Draco too, and were saying nothing to spare him. He might tell Draco anyway, because he thought Draco had also grown to like them and he should see them if he wanted.
“The first time, dear.”
He kept looking at it for a long time, while Harry helped Fred get settled and got the best smelling soap and shampoo in the house.
“Gggaahmnoooo” said Harry, which was a very reasonable response.
Slightly taller perhaps, a bit more flesh in his bones. He still looked like the fragile puppet from three years ago. Draco thought he could even see the seams half ripped and open, or perhaps it was just sinew and bone under the skin.  But he could also see the raw magic pulsing under the pale skin. He had an aura of majesty and power that Draco hadn’t seen the first time.
“The friend?”
And a bit farther away from the river, enough that you didn’t get the smell, there was the other house.
about, but it wasn’t any easier to explain.
Because he wasn’t completely blind or as big an idiot as some people thought, he did notice that Malfoy looked pretty good. Hot, even, although everything about him was cold. He looked handsome and elegant and like a thousand galleons. He looked like he was supposed to look.
“You can’t be sure!”
Why? Well… He just had to. And he knew exactly what to do.
“Who are these again?” asked Draco. He was chopping onions in the kitchen for dinner, while in the backburner his personal recipe for a cold avoidance potion brewed slowly. It would take all night before it was ready, but it would be worth it. It was starting to get really cold and neither of them had proper winter wear.
After a cursory sniff of Harry’s shoes and hands (Harry agreed they were the body parts that carried the most information) and a quick sniff at his crotch (um), Fenton turned to the bag, putting his head inside and sniffing all the bottles.
ooOoo
Harry took him. If he wasn’t going to love his owl, he reasoned, he should get an owl that no one was going to love. Besides, no matter what the bemused assistant said, Aeneas was far from being totally useless. He could deliver letters just fine, only on his own schedule and with a bonky aim.
Harry only stared at the painting for ten seconds before lifting Fred to the sofa. Fenton jumped after him, stepped on Fred’s knee, and then made himself comfortable on his lap.
Although it was in his best interest to keep quiet, Harry felt he had to speak. There were already many things he didn’t talk about, and he would rather not be silent on the small things.
She looked around and snatched a piece of parchment from Arthur’s pocket and a quill from someone else’s. She bended over the windowsill to write something, glancing at Pansy to make sure that the girl was noticing the elegance of her posture.
“Because I could give you your Christmas present now, if you really need cheering up”
“Aren’t you surprised?” said Lee, resting his head on Neville’s tight. It was unbelievable that Neville had once been chubby and clumsy. It was unbelievable that he had once been a boy when he now looked like the default picture of A Man. “I am very surprised. Fred and George aren’t going to believe this.”
2) We know we are not going to like the other person. That is the point of the Peace Post, talking to someone you wouldn’t normally talk to. It shouldn’t matter if for some reason you have memorized a catalogue of owl owners in Wizarding Britain and therefore you realize your new Post Pal used to be a fan of genocide. We know that already. The point is getting past it and being Better.
“I don’t know” Lee interjected chirpily. Here was a man who wasn’t shy before the mic. “It’s not as if rules were being reverently respected before the riots. My letter of acceptance, and I am talking here merely as a former Hogwarts student, my letter of acceptance, I was saying, stated that only cats, toads and owls were admitted in Hogwarts. However I brought Anansi with me and this didn’t seem to cause any problems and it helped me make life-long friends.”
“I do,” Harry said. He had thought a lot about that too. “If it comes to it, I was thinking of marrying him,” he said in all seriousness. It was a very good plan. Half the time his thoughts veered towards marrying
Today’s strip had the dog grabbing a dementor by its cloak and playing tug of war with it. He was soon joined by the patronus of its owner, which was a silver copy of the dog.
Harry wondered, with a shudder, who had cast that spell? Was it Quinn’s old boss because he didn’t want to be captured? That would be an amazing feat of powerful magic then. Quinn might have forgotten that he had extorted his way to that position, then. Or,
“Want us to learn you a lesson, shorty?”
Pit’s whole body was trembling, but his voice was unwavering when he answered.
with one of the Biggest Pranksters of the Century and what exactly did they think that would happen? That was Percy’s defence. It should had been obvious.
Again he only remembered that he could apparate when he was half up the stairs already and after he almost dropped a teapot full of boiling water over his head and he banged his elbow on one corner. Harry was a terrible wizard.
“Oh, well. At least I already know current prices for tombstones” Sirius said bravely.
Death was an impenetrable mystery. Death was the end all. Death, and the parting between worlds, was what had built the Ministry of Magic. The stone arch and the ragged Veil had always been there, and the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry of Magic had been built around it.
He showed Draco to the library. The painting greeted them from above the fireplace. Aeneas greeted them, too, hopping on his perch. Draco had an amused and resigned expression, either at the painting he didn’t like which was hanging in a place of honour, or at the jolly fat one-eyed owl that wasn’t good for much.
Draco was following behind, with Fred’s arm over his shoulder and evidently wasn’t paying much attention to Regulus’ rant. Harry was curious what could have Draco’s attention. Maybe he was distracted staring at Harry’s ass. A man could hope.
.” Draco says drily. He is always so dry and detached when talking about the war, and Oh My God Draco! Did you zone out on me?
“How was I sup-” Slytherin started to say. It was an old argument already. How was he supposed to know that the basilisk would cause any trouble?
That had been one of the decisive factors to convince them to enter the house. When he gave them a sudden self deprecating smile that seemed to laugh at himself for playing a role he didn’t believe in. When he said he wanted them to come in, really, he did, but didn’t feel in any position to tell them what to do to keep safe. He could also offer them money and sandwiches, if they preferred.
Harry was still down in the kitchen when Draco knocked on the door, so after letting him and Fenton in and checking his identity (there was no doubt about Fenton) he had to hurry downstairs to check on Regulus and Fred.
Harry was overloaded with thoughts. Harry judged people based on the state of their cuffs and, most annoyingly, was right pretty often. (“Don’t be absurd, Rhodey, that man is in bankruptcy he could not be at a party that costs sixty galleons the ticket. His cuffs are bleached and rethreaded.”) He had too much information to analyse. He didn’t even notice when Malfoy put the black sweater on, stretched it down, and pulled his ponytail out.
They entered the mall and searched for the appropriate shop. Despite the relatively early hour it was busy and they had to wait in line. Harry merely looked around with a dazed smile. To be fair, it always felt weird entering a clean and brightly lit place. He felt all the more out of place with his baggy second hand clothes and his dirty shoes.
“I hope… I told Regulus that he could come visit, one day.”
Harry told them. He only needed a minute, and half of it was to complain about Ollivander’s excessive chattering. Six inches, golden oak and unicorn hair, sold to Rebecca Isobel Nott on 1902.
So there wasn’t much Harry could do other than nod and drop some hints to Seamus when he saw him. It hadn’t even changed things for him personally, that realisation. He had had many other things going on in life, like his building disenchantment with his job and his dealing with trust issues.
already, which, excuse you Malfoy, but Harry was far from dumb. Harry was pretty smart, actually, only about different things and in different ways. So he might not always remember to grab his gloves or, as it happened today, all of his clothes; but Harry was pretty knowledgeable about how magic worked
“East Europe.”
Luna nodded, taking the information in. She was sitting cross-legged on the floor with her back straight, hair parted in two and falling over her shoulders. She waited a bit before speaking. Long enough that they could all gather themselves, if not their thoughts. Fred was still hugging Regulus, but at least now Regulus didn’t have his face pressed against Fred’s chest. He was very close, but he could breathe.
He looked at Draco, his face flushed from the wind, his silky hair almost tangling (not possible though, Draco’s hair unknotted by itself). He looked at him and knew that in that moment Draco was happy. Not that Draco had been miserable. He had taken the death of his parents as well as was possible given the circumstances and he had had plenty of support. But there had been a feeling of being lost, Harry knew, of being your own master and not knowing what to do. He hadn’t been miserable but he hadn’t been as well as he could be.
… There was quite a lot of stirring in the house. More than stirring. A continuous series of deep thrusts and a bed creaking ominously.
Sometimes Sirius had dreams about Azkaban, but the dream didn’t have the chill of the past and he always dreamed that he escaped, one way or another.
They didn’t mind it much.
“Yes, well, that is not the case. A relationship can die without anyone else interfering,” Harry bit out because
They were tense because not five minutes after Harry had left something had tried to get inside. Fenton had showed his excellent hunting drive and began to bark, loud and angry, scratching the wall under the living room window. They weren’t sure what it had been. Fred said he had seen a faint grey shadow between the droplets of rain. Regulus said that he didn’t really see anything, but if he closed his eyes he thought he could point at a presence by the sound of its footsteps.
They got Percy to the living room and to the twins sitting together. He didn’t faint but he fell to the floor once more, sobbing so hard that it looked like his chest was going to break in two. Ron stayed by Percy’s side, patting his back. He was crying, eyes red and his chin trembling, but it was nothing compared to the utter wreck Percy had become. Regulus looked at Harry and mouthed, “Where is Fenton?” but he and Draco were long gone.
And Draco… Draco needed a show of trust, and he could give him that.
Maybe it
Harry was naturally confrontational, or perhaps Draco brought it out of him. In any case he answered by deliberate and challengingly shaking his hips and then, at Draco’s mildly indignant expression, going into full dance mode, which involved all of his body, expansive arm motions, and the whole room space.
Dumbledore said there was a way to defeat Voldemort. But perhaps Harry was tired, it was too much information to take at once, perhaps he would prefer to ask some questions about his family, about the parents he barely met. They could talk about that, leave the hard matters for some other time.
“Or not,” Harry went on, because he was the worst. “If that makes you uncomfortable. Maybe it’s a private thing, if you wanted to cover his mark. You don’t have to show me. I was just curious, but it’s all right.”
Fred turned to Harry with a confused look that he was sure he also had on his face.
looking at Harry because he hadn’t found a suitable place for them.
Remus waited with trepidation for the third full moon. When people noticed it was the third time you fell sick in as many months and drew conclusions. Only the full moon came and it went and no one at work said anything other than Theresa, who sat next to Remus and offered him a cup of hot tea in exchange for some of his chocolates and some of those painkillers he carried ‘cause her uterus was killing her and fuck biology, man.
“Moony, is this…”
She clinked her glass. Silence was requested and achieved. She cleared her throat.
Harry’s eyes were still on him, completely disregarding the inhuman monster that was quickly coming towards him. The eyes seemed to be the only point of colour in a room that was suddenly turning to be made out of black and grey.  He looked with an electric intensity, searching, and Draco prayed that he found whatever he was looking for. He tried to make his face as open as possible to answer whatever that penetrating gaze was asking. If he could give nothing else, he would give his honesty…
“Muriel called my mother a frigid and barren witch,” Draco added. “She was invited to my christening and apparently she said I looked like an ugly marshmallow. She said it was a pity Father didn’t have a natural son to inherit.”
This is not the first time Draco and Harry came across each other. It is unclear what Draco does these days for a living, but his businesses have a tendency to bump against Harry’s. However, this is a side of Draco Harry had never seen, loyal and kind and brave. Harry is paying attention.
He heard Regulus call for him. Harry wished he could close the living room door and have him stay there with Fred, away from any not-Lunas.
He didn’t know how long the
“It is not bad,” Harry said, not as quiet as the water droplets water of Regulus’ voice but not much louder than that. He spoke like a dry towel feels, one that is a bit old and softer for it.
“Yes… I, uh, we met once at a crosswalk near Whitehall. We, that’s it, me and this other wizard, Arthur, called for you, but I am afraid we were too adamant. We had been looking for you for years, you know. Everybody was very worried”
Molly Weasley (née Preweet) was that kind of traditional woman who would dote on her daughter’s husband but would be a complete nightmare to her daughters-in-law because absolutely no woman was good enough for her baby boys. This is not a rare occurrence and Molly herself had had to fight against the extraordinary force of nature that was Matilda Weasley.
“Oh, did you hear? I am sorry for the disturbance”
Luna sighed tiredly but devoid of anger. “Probably. But I think they are upset about my comings and goings, the change of schedule. Not that thestrals usually care much about humans, you know, since most people can’t even see them. But…”
For a mad instant they were in the middle of a circle of fire. The one that Harry was producing meeting with the flames of the fireplace that were jumping out of the hearth like hands reaching out. It was a circle, a perfect ring of the brightest, reddest, flame. Then Draco stepped in the fireplace and the circle broke. The flames collided and surged up, engulfing them and hiding them from view. They were surrounded by fire. They were in the fire.
charms. Thank Morgana the Lestrange were not known for their attention to detail, because Rodolphus could have raised lots of complaints before their wedding, during the wedding night and certainly
“I know what I saw. You summoned an apple, and materialised and vanished those coins and cards. I know you were doing magic, what I want to know is how are you getting away with it”.
The boy looked at him in silence. It was a look he had often seen both in Snape and McGonagall directed to a hopeless first year.
“He is a
Draco left the book open upside on the couch. He wandered in to the kitchen, the bathroom, and the two other rooms they didn’t know what they were supposed to be.
There was also a document declaring Regulus Arcturus Black to be a male human wizard of nineteen years of age, signed and sealed by the Minister and a Wizengamot special representative.
He passed his wand to his left hand (he had done that once when fighting a Death Eater and the woman had stopped and asked what the fuck he was doing, as if using your wand with either hand were a weird thing). Harry licked his right hand quickly, from the wrist to the fingertips. His skin tasted like salt and sand. He put the hand over the dark gap of the kitchen stairs.
“Some people were worried. I was very sad, for a while. Aunt Calpurnia said—she is Papa’s aunt—she said that he should keep a close eye on me and that I shouldn’t be allowed in Mum’s study. Going to the river, too. She said I shouldn’t go even with company because I might do something that I would regret. Professor Flitwick wrote a letter to him. He was concerned that I looked very sad and liked wandering in the forest.”
Draco stared. He was not familiar with the notion of work. Now that he thought about it, nobody in his family seemed to work. Maybe the halfblood cousin, but he wasn’t sure.
“No! I w-”
Once again, they were too tired to do anything other than going to sleep. The house was secure, salted and circled, and they all had their wands nearby. There was nothing to fear.
They were aware that their life was quite ridiculous. They didn’t mind. They kneeled before the tree and put the box of chocolate wands and the sweaters and the bicycles and everything else.
“Yeah, yeah, I know” Oh, lord, Harry was blushing wasn’t he? Later tonight he was going to drown himself in the bathtub. “Look, don’t think too much about it. I just saw it and it was on sale so I got it. It’s nothing fancy like you are used to”. He mumbled the last part.
He spied the blond guy again twice more. During the first performance of the morning in Camden, and the one after lunch.
They ended up giving her an apple and a glass of water and helped her find the correct floor and the door to her apartment. Harry assured her that her thights were perfect the way they were and many men would gladly die in between them, and she hugged him and cried a bit more and informed Draco that his boyfriend was a true gentleman.
Malfoy had grabbed one of the few undamaged cushions and transformed it to make it big enough to hold both men. He had also grabbed the cushions and blankets, everything stained with blood, and taken them with quick strides to the kitchen. Kreacher hurriedly following his steps carrying Fred’s wet slippers.
He got on the floor, took his slippers off for some reason and Harry had just enough time to shove a cushion under his head before Fred began to shake. Regulus followed the proceedings with lips pressed together and he got down on his knees to wait on Fred’s other side. The last couple of seizures had been bad, really bad, for both of them. Regulus was scared.
There was something else. They had attacked Draco for his profession, for the way he had found of surviving. They attacked him for daring to stand in the only corner they had left him.
Meanwhile Malfoy took Regulus and Fred to the loo and got them back to the living room and sitting on the same sofa. Regulus had a copy of
The left half of Snape’s face and hand was covered in small cuts. Lord Voldemort’s outburst had broken all the windows in the room and thrown the floorboards up, like a forest of thorns or the bottom of a spiked ditch, and the iron shards from the chandelier were now embedded in the stonewall.
“But I wanted to meet Fenton!” George exclaimed.
Quinn raised his head and looked at Harry once again with the expression of a hunter, a predator, eyes piercing and teeth bared. Already the deep wounds were closing.
The hall was silent, but there was noise in the rest of the house. Mutters and whispered conversations in every room. Sirius found Remus in the library, calmly perusing the book’s titles.
and dragged him home and pushed him to the bed, intent on making his mark there. And Harry had absolutely no complaints whatsoever.
And it was a very small window of time, so small that it should have opened and closed without anything happening. By themselves the two of them were not powerful enough, important enough, to pull through. But this was not about themselves, this was about the power they had together, the symmetry of opposition. The magic of a mirror.
The chaos.
And Draco did, too. He could tell from how he had relaxed at her last words.
. Naturally, he had taken this as a challenge.
It wasn’t until almost three weeks later that Emmelina Vance remarked on the coincidence that Draco’s disappearance so mirrored Harry’s. They had both vanished one day and no charm or spell could find them.
He let go of Oliver’s hands so he could grab his back and shoulders as they kissed, hard, fast, and laughing a bit because this was all ridiculous and also very important. Percy felt his legs spreading open almost automatically.
Harry was received by some sort of cartoon bird, big and purple and with just a few lavender feathers at the base of its long neck. It made a funny sound, like a hollow gear. Harry liked it. He smiled at the, what was that, a condor? He smiled at the bird. Nice bird. It brought a note of colour and fun to the place. He liked Luna’s place, it was calm and pretty, but he often felt a certain melancholy there. Perhaps because Luna was alone there, and she had been very alone at Hogwarts, and she deserved better than that.
Draco Malfoy.
Luna didn’t have animals that fed on humans like giant spiders or blast-ended skrewts. That didn’t mean that the animals that she had couldn’t kill someone if provoked. They could. But that was true of many creatures, even small ones.
He wasn’t sure if it was a good idea or if it would work. He thought so, but he wasn’t sure. What he was
“I have no idea.” Percy writes back. “Wait, do you mean the Johnsons? How are they?”
Malfoy very deliberately said nothing, but something in his face changed. He smiled too. He tried to hide it, but he smiled, Harry was looking at his mouth and he saw it. It was a smile that said that of course Harry had an almost useless owl. Just as he was upset about the death of an old house elf. He just never did things quite like he was supposed to.
But Harry was alone. No one saw it.
“Yes, as in, you have to work or trade for it”.
With that, the boy turned to leave.
A muggle.
It was a kindness, giving him a few minutes alone. Harry nodded silently, head turned so his tears wouldn’t be so obvious.
Draco’s fifth year ought to have been excellent, but instead it was mostly irritating. The Ministry denying what Draco knew to be true was convenient but exasperating in their obfuscation. The pure blood students whispering that things were going to change were equally infuriating, as if they hadn’t seen the same weak and pathetic creature Draco had witnessed.
“People keep asking about killing Riddle, but these are the kind of problems we should be focusing on.”
The pouch with the money was still on the floor and Harry couldn’t bring himself to touch it. Aeneas was fighting with the howler, opening his wings threateningly. The howler, once its message had been delivered, began to burn which Aeneas took as further reason to tear it apart.
had taken care at first.
But he hadn’t gotten his cake
Malfoy had come every day and things had been so bad that he had even stayed more than strictly necessary, when before he had always been ready to bolt. Harry remembered seeing him sitting in an armchair with a notebook in his hands which meant he had been there a while. It wasn’t important, though. What was important were the cuffs. Trouser cuffs and sleeve cuffs. The first ones were still stained with green and dirt and had a hole on the heel, much like Harry’s used to have. The wrist cuffs though, oh here it came, the wrist cuffs had been lifted to avoid getting them wet and thus they had revealed a bit more of the streak of colour in the left wrist.
Ratty had been there.
“Okay” he said. He blinked twice.
Ironically, the closest he had come to dead it had been by his own hand, when he managed to track down Marvolo Gaunt’s ring. The mark of the Hallows displayed in the stone taunted him. The possibility to see Ariana again, to say sorry… Perhaps Gellert too.
Percy was very happy. In Oliver’s bed, he was sleeping better than he had slept in years.
“Muggles seem to manage fine,” Draco said, in a choked voice.
The place was too well protected. This wouldn’t be the route to Grimmauld Place.
“So!” said Regulus, taking a sit next to George. “I have become good friends with Fred and I understand that you two are a package deal so let’s get up to speed. How do you feel about crosswords?”
There was some high hobnob from the Church of England and a guy who maybe worked at the BBC, and two minor celebrities.
Also, he gets to meet with Oliver. It turns out that Oliver hadn’t noticed the girls’ lack of magic, but he also doesn’t care. Why would he care? Are you- are you supposed to care? Is this another thing Oliver missed because he only thinks about Quidditch? What’s wrong with not having magic in any case? Oliver’s mother is muggle and it is agreed that she is wonderful.
(Harry had always been tempted of informing Clubs of the little confusion between image and nickname, but never got to it).
It was a very welcome rest but for the fact that it opened the opportunity to talk and Harry wasn’t sure of what could he possibly say. Nice to meet your family, let’s not do it again? Draco hovered around him, moving his hands all over Harry’s body, wishing health over every inch of his skin and not daring to meet Harry’s eyes.
“It’s good to see you,” said Harry, perhaps a bit louder than necessary.
Draco opened his hand and let the pouch fall. He didn’t throw it, he didn’t hurl it back, he didn’t even drop it as if it burned his hand. He simply stopped holding it.
“G… R… A… D” said Ravenclaw almost unconsciously while Gryffindor wrote. The man had once misspelled his own name, three times, on the same page, when they were laying the rules of the school. Most people didn’t notice, but even in the crest it said Gordic.
“Do you know something?” Percy said. “You and Charlie, you were never in grave danger. I never had to worry about you.”
It wasn’t just that Draco had been calm and collected about it. Being self-possessed and keeping a cool head was a great virtue (that Harry sadly lacked), but this was not it.
Someone was very powerful. That was true yesterday as well as now. Someone had power over minds and memories and perceptions. Someone had achieved what Voldemort and Grindelwald only dreamed of. Someone had retrieved a key from its hiding place and gone to the locked room and released the Demon from the mirror where it was imprisoned.
“Well, I better get going.”
“How about… memories of the battle?”
Keeping a low profile meant:
This is it! Thanks to all of you who commented, kudosed and read.
I know about solo Quidditch, but I don’t think I get the dome thing.
Harry gave him a straight Karol. A good lie needs to be fast and consistent, so it pays to have a few stories memorized. The Karol (Kasia for the girls) was the story of a British born kid (so you don’t have to bother with the accent) son of an immigrant couple who was always working. It was very rare for someone to question why a poor immigrant kid was not in school at any given time. It also gave a plausible excuse for being almost anywhere at any time without adult supervision, since you always had to run an errand for Uncle Szymon.
Draco had said he wouldn’t come until after lunch that day, which was perfectly understandable because yesterday he had spent over six hours at the house. Surely he had other things to do. He had been very adamant about having other commitments and a job, so he would have to attend to them. Although Harry was starting to suspect that Draco had only said that to be difficult and contrary. He did not keep any kind of working hours and his only regular activity seemed to be grass stomping and scribbling in a notebook. Draco might consider that a job, though.
“I am not opening anyone’s grave looking for wands or skeletons,” Harry said in a parent-like tone. “And neither are you,” he added, because he knew Fred and because although he didn’t know Regulus that well he knew him enough to know he was trouble. Regulus did whatever he wanted and damn the consequences.
Look, Pansy had noticed that they were spending quite a lot of time together so it made sense to befriend the girl either to get important intel on Ginny’s habits and preferences and/or to make her jealous. She had not been planning on actually
Remus explained the case and showed him the photographs, charmed so they would remain still. The woman became serious and insisted on giving them a cup of tea while the young man studied the pictures.
Draco was there with his wand in his hand, pointed at Harry, his left hand on Fenton’s neck. Fenton had his tail up and was stretching his neck, trying to get out of his master’s grasp and get close to Harry and the interesting bag full of smells he had brought.
And he was pretty sure Mrs. Adkins washing machine wasn’t even connected to the current, and yet it hadn’t given any trouble since Harry offered to look. The poor lady, ankle deep in water, had been so grateful she kissed Harry on both cheeks. She had pressed a twenty quid note to Harry’s hand and covered him with enough blessings to last him for the rest of the year.
,” Regulus was ardently saying, one hand raised for emphasis. Harry grabbed said hand by the wrist and kept it up so he could scrub under the arm and on Regulus’ side.
“Thanks, dear. Will you give us a hand, please?” Regulus appeared to be talking to the handkerchief. “For us. He is in over his head.” He flickered his eyes briefly at Malfoy and then at Harry, extending his hand to give back the handkerchief almost like a medieval lady giving a token in a tournament Harry waved at him to keep it.
Weasley sends another postcard around Christmas. This one comes with an address, in case either he or Snape also want to drop everything and fuck off, he supposes. Draco writes back explaining he is bidding his time to exact just retribution over all those who wronged him and Snape is in no condition to travel. Weasley writes, well, he doesn’t write, he sends a third postcard with quite a nice drawing of a thumbs up.
made more sense”.
Malfoy nodded and said “yes” or “of course” or something similar. Harry leaned down a bit as he left and put a warm hand on Kreacher’s shoulder, just for a second.
He bought himself a chocolate pastry in a muggle bakery and spent the morning walking leisurely and trying new baked goods. His feet took him to a park where a riot of colour caught his eye.
It had gone well and they were all happy, despite how much they were crying. But Harry needed a second because the business of bringing miracles to people was very tiring. He retired to the dining room, close enough that he would be right there if they needed him. He pressed his forehead against the window and took a deep slow breath. There was a scratch in the glass that hadn’t been there two days before. The talon of the Demon or the burn of a spell.
He found himself later that night near the Thames, tired and irritated at the unnecessary complexity of the muggle world and their habit of asking questions like “can I see an ID?”.
Harry returned to the living room and checked on Fred. He was still bleeding, although at a slow rate. Regulus watched them in silence, he was back to being sullen and depressed.
“Shall I tell you about the colour grey again?”
“We deal with things the traditional way,” offered Regulus softly. He had stopped looking at the blanket in his lap and had advanced to looking at the tea set. “Drinking tea and saying nothing about it until the bad feeling goes away.”
Harry could see Malfoy rising an invisible hand to his face, but he didn’t know if he was removing a mask or putting it back on. He only knew that his expression shifted.
Harry had seen it. The insistence that Draco had a job but then not having any obvious working hours. His night owl habits. Even the occasional touches of paint on his face and hands. Remnants of make-up, Harry thought, carefully applied and hastily removed.
“Boys, too, if you prefer” said Sirius when he saw his hesitation. He had learned his lesson from Harry and Draco. He didn’t have as much advice in that area, but he was convinced that whatever he said would be better than anything that Harry or Draco or Remus and Severus could ever come with. Percival Weasley might have something to say, given how he had gotten himself such a handsome boyfriend, but the others had just stumbled into each other and were completely clueless.
The interested party got closer.
“Did you learn anything?” asked Draco. His hair was very nice, too. He had put it a high ponytail, but some strands had come loose to frame his face. Harry wondered how it would look out of the ponytail, if it would surround his head like a lion’s mane or if it would hang like Regulus’ silk drape.
“Listen, Draco,” Harry said, opening a drawer from the desk. He had had a long time to think about it. Too long, probably.
The tea was cold by then and bitter so Harry had to take the tray and make it fresh and Draco stayed in the living room checking on Regulus and Fred. Regulus had had the beginnings of a headache the whole morning. It hadn’t developed into a full crisis, thankfully, but he was still in pain. Fred had a dry cough which was annoying but since he wasn’t spitting blood nobody thought it was bad.
His first words were that please, they should all just eat, it was past noon, and he had brought a bottle of green sauce. Hahaha.
George managed to surprise her. He came dressed in an understated dark blue that really suited him (Sirius’ doing) and formally told her he would like to take her on a date: Late breakfast at a new café followed by a matinée play in the theatre.
“Yeah… I… Yeah, I don’t know either”
The sugar gliders couldn’t escape through the balcony route and after all that effort, how could Draco not offer them shelter under his coat? It’s practically his duty as a Slytherin to secret away two living fashion accessories and later train them into becoming
And I thought my family was strict and difficult.
“Balding, skinny but with a belly.” Sirius said with very illustrative gestures. “Yet that man has fathered seven children, Olivia, seven. Ron is sporty and much better looking. Do you understand what I mean?”
Before the declaration we need the plot, any plot. Maybe someone is missing. Yes. A witch goes missing, Laura Hale. Two years younger than Harry, so he doesn’t remember her. But then Susan Bones goes missing too and Harry knows Susan well. Plus she is from the Bones family, so all alarms go off.
She opened the door and stepped outside, Harry following her after a beat. Far away in the field there was a small herd of thestrals. Nowadays there were many more people able to see them, but the number of people able to care for and domesticate them had stayed the same.
“Ahm.” Said Eddie.
So he hadn’t exactly noticed, he hadn’t
It was like lifting a layer of white dead skin after being sunburned and gingerly touching the pink skin below. It felt good and scary. The feeling shadowed Harry through the last few days of school, through the scraps dinners and nights under the stairs.
“I see. And you thought that they would do the same with two adult wizards? File them for examination, put them in a jar in a shelf? Maybe with a tag on their foreheads or a little sign hanging from their necks.”
… Do you know where the old Black house is?”
“It’s like watching a baby griffin learning to walk and setting something on fire in the process,” said Regulus. It was unnecessarily mean because Harry had just been asking an honest and judgement-free question, but he was also grateful that Regulus had spoken because it meant that he could shut up now.
Draco had also asked Luna to please not send Sevila again because she drew muggle attention. She also drew wizards’ attention because she was a purple vulture after all, but Draco didn’t care about that. It was the muggles’ attention. Draco really couldn’t afford the fines for Undue Muggle Attention.
Cursing his grandmother.
It took Draco four hours and a bit of fear before he managed to track him down to a corner of Camden where he was attempting to sell some truly ghastly jewellery.
Harry nodded. He knew that. He understood it. He also thought in some cases it was a little unfair and more than a little dangerous. You had to make sure that people didn’t have a reason to want another war, that they had enough to live quiet lives.
“It’s a pity about that rivalry in school, because he would have some idea of what to do.”
He missed the train.
Harry showed Quinn into the living room and he saw him scan the place, his penetrating eyes looking for the people that weren’t there. He also took a deep breath, which in any other person would go unnoticed but it made Harry think that Quinn might have some other abilities.
“Harry!”
Imagine the anger, the humiliation, the pain. Death is painful. Clinging to existence is painful.
She might not have had a Hogwarts’ education, but she had been difficult to bring down anyway. She had a staff of common ash and a stone knife and she had used both against them. Inside her hut, in the hearth of the fire, they had found human bones and teeth. Some big, some small enough to look like a goblin’s except for the colour. Goblin’s bones were steel grey and these were, well, bone white.
Draco leaned back on the sofa.
“Draco,” she cries, softly and sadly. Beautiful Draco, six years and two months and with a face like a silver coin. “Draco, dear, do you love this boy? I don’t mean like you love Mummy. Do you…”
“Is that…?” croaked Draco, smart Draco, quick Draco, already guessing what Harry had brought and being halfway to an infuriated laugh.
They packed up their things. It was incredible how much they had accumulated in the last few months. Harry wasn’t looking too closely at how they managed to fit everything in the old suitcases from the Oxfam shop, but they did it, with lots of sweat and curses though. Even the headboard, because Draco insisted.
Harry was still unconvinced but he didn’t get a chance to voice his concerns before the girl went on. So, yes, she had been investigating the topic because she understood that Voldemort, yes

“It is not even December yet!”
“…and all I’m asking is that you— ”
surely Malfoy had noticed Harry’s interest too. And what was he doing about it?
Harry wondered about his usual hiding strategy. He had made himself invisible, unseen, but he hadn’t really thought about other senses.
“I want to say we won’t be long,” Harry said while Luna got her things settled. “But I don’t know how long it will be. Definitely before bedtime.”
Draco looked at him briefly before averting his eyes and nodding. Harry wasn’t sure that there could be a charm or a curse that prevented you from having a thought, but maybe Draco had been hit with something after all. Until this morning he hadn’t know there was a variant of the
Fred tried to wriggle his eyebrows but he wasn’t able to do it very well, so he had to purse his lips and bat his lashes instead. Harry thought of kissing him just to show him how far he could take a joke.
hare had vanished. It had set its eyes on them, pearly white and full of malevolence (this was the first time they described its eyes, by the way, and Harry thought it was extremely interesting), and it had roared. Not an animal roar, Fred was very adamant about that. A bear, a lion, even a dragon didn’t make that kind of sound.
he hadn’t had a seizure in more than ten hours. He was the peak of health. He even had a slice of toast nearby. He wasn’t eating it, but he had it around as if he might.
Draco seems quite composed and unaffected by the discovery, but he also storms outside and when Harry goes to tell him that they had moved Goyle’s body it is obvious that Draco had been crying.
“What is this, the Twelve Days of Christmas?”
“She didn’t want to”. Explained the boy, Neville. “But Luna had heard Hermione give the address, so we just grabbed a handful of floo powder and jumped in”.
No, it wasn’t something as pedestrian as each member of the house getting a napkin embroidered and Harry was a real goon to ask. The clothes were embroidered with the initials of the ruling couple in the house which meant the father or the eldest child and his wife. Draco would say that Regulus was right.
ooOoo
. Two flames burst out of the tip of the wands.
were the prey.
It had been a long time coming and it was a pervasive matter so asking Harry what was the proverbial last straw was unfair. It was not a single straw; the problem was the big pile of straw underneath, the fire hazard of straw, the freaking barn full of straw that could not be ignored any longer.
“Please?” he said, and then added in a whisper. “It will make Kreacher happy, just let him see you leave with it.”
But if you had asked any of the neighbours on the street or the chilled Londoners hurrying along if there had been someone there at any point during the day they would have said no. No, they hadn’t seen anyone.
With every word Regulus uttered he moved away from those last words. Every small command put distance from that horrible one, from the order to leave and destroy the locket and take care and, with a broken sob brought by the Draught of Despair, to never let anyone order Kreacher to hurt himself. Those had been Regulus’ last words, to Kreacher but also in general. It was good to have new words. So Kreacher was in a state of tentative joy and relief and everything else mattered very little, including who did or did not accept the food he cooked.
Nobody had told Harry that they didn’t have any tangible evidence against her, that they didn’t even have a particular suspicion, just the knowledge that she lived in the area. Maybe that was the straw, that they knew that he would want something more before barging inside someone’s house, so they didn’t tell him.
“This is my sandwich. I am working on it.”
Ollivander straightened and looked very pleased as he told Harry the characteristics of Voldemort’s wand. The terrible but powerful things it could do.
“Oh, yes, yes.”
He was still not thinking about anyone or anything. Just lying down and willing it to go away and let him go back to sleep.
“It will probably be very faint anyway.”
l, and Draco will greatly benefit from the terrifying experience of being invited to her house to spend the summer. Dear Aunt Virginia only accepts a child per generation, two at most, and it was an incredible win on Lucius’ part that Draco, and not Theo, was chosen.
Now, however, Sirius was happy. Happy with the abandon and full embrace of young children that don’t know yet that most things in the world come with caveats and conditions.
Draco spent the night in an adequate room in a B&B, having signed as one Marco Black. A good night of sleep and a full breakfast did wonders to improve his melancholic mood. Clearly, this was just what he needed and he would have his bearings back in no time.
Slytherin whimpered with pleasure.
“I must warn you” George had said. “I had to sell my soul to Draco so he would tell me about this. If we ever get to that stage, we can not get married because I promised I would let him pick our kids’ names.”
“Right, Draco”
ooOoo
Draco was starting to think that there was something wrong with the Black family. At least with the ones with dark hair, because his mother had never done that sort of nonsense and the aunt they never mentioned seemed quite normal all things considered.
“Your favourite colour.” Harry just couldn’t stop blabbering. He should come to these things with someone who could slap him anytime he spoke too much. “Not sure about the shape, though.”
“Travelling” Suruchi said, rolling her “r” as if it were something akin to murder.
Harry woke up late feeling if not rested, righted. It wasn’t the good natural sleep but it was enough that his mind didn’t have the drain of exhaustion. Enough that he could deal with the weirdness of his life.
Harry felt overdressed. He was wearing a waistcoat, for Merlin’s sake! At least he wasn’t wearing a tie or a cravat, although he looked incredibly good in the latter.

But a house elf apparates in front of him, and
“Of course he wouldn’t, don’t think I don’t know, but it can’t be any kind, it should be one giving sweet pears. I was going to write Neville asking for advice.”
But they didn’t talk about it in their trip back to London.
Harry had told Fred to sit tight and he was now taking Regulus down in his arms. Who would have thought it? Harry the tiny orphan was well fed and strong enough to carry someone in his arms.
“George Granger” George would say, grinning. “That’s four gs and three rs.”
By dinner time he was twenty pages away from finishing
Harry was beginning to suspect that if he were to go and kiss Draco he might be rejected but he wouldn’t be punched in the face.
Now Harry was at the top of the stairs, covering the threshold completely, and she was on her hands and knees, scrambling to get up, to get to her wand. Harry casted
“And I can’t see as well any more, but Ron, you are going to be fine. Just do as you were doing.”
Harry nodded. He would nod at anything Draco said at this distance. “Will I see you later?”
He still imagined Draco’s face, that little smile that was like a smirk before he gave in and accepted something. That face he had made today when he had apologised inexplicably after insulting the painting. But Harry had already come so surely it didn’t count.
And the miraculous reappearance of Mr Zusak’s wallet, with all the money and his medical prescriptions, after someone stole it from him after church.
“No, no.” Regulus looked more lively, less agitated by his dream as he analysed why exactly Death Eaters would dislike Harry besides his involvement with Voldemort’s fall. “Because you do things differently and that’s an insult. You take wands out of a duel and when you
your name!” Mort exclaimed in an unnecessarily loud tone. “Oh, my, I knew you regretted Marco, but this is way over the top. Trying too hard to be cool”.
They had crossed the threshold with trepidation, holding hands. Now, hidden away in the kitchen they were starting to relax. Both men had kept their word and sneaked them past the cramped dining hall to the kitchen downstairs. They had sworn they could leave at any time, too, and no one had to know they had been there if they didn’t want to. And, did they want more tea?
Harry closed the door behind him and locked it. It could be forced open with a few different charms, but it would take time, and enough time might mean getting out of there and to a safe place. He did the same with the main door before turning to Luna and disapparating with her.
Harry looked at the girl with the frankly magnificent mane of hair. She was panting and trying to speak and Harry thought that she was made of iron. Iron feet and iron bones and iron blood and iron core. Solid and unwavering. Strong.
“He was a very bad man who wanted to hurt many people. So a young man took this sword and killed him. Now we have the sword here so everybody knows that if they are bad and want to hurt people, they will be stopped.”
There was a very evident step missing in the chain of events. If the merchant had been arrested the cargo would have been seized through official channels and the snake might have gone to the Department of Magical Creatures unless some other department stepped in (bloody Department of Mysteries, but the Wizengamot might want it as evidence too). But it had gone to Luna.
He looked at the house, examining every piece of the façade. The curtains in the living room moved a bit, just a small channel for the sun to go through. Harry crossed the street and looked at the house from there one more time before taking a deep breath and disapparating to Diagon Alley. It was beginning to rain, the drizzle from the night before growing into a proper pour.
They had run to the stairs but the monster had lashed out with either fire, a stinging curse, or a blade. Either way, they had given up on the stairs and kept running down the corridor which was a terrible idea because there was always a strategic advantage to having the high ground. But they were not thinking clearly. There had been a roar that gave sense to the idea that blood could curdle. It was roar that stopped hearts and made blood thicken, turning it to ice. Luna had passed out just about then and her
