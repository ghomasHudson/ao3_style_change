Harry smiled back and nodded at him as he too sat up and got off the couch with the Slytherin. He will give Draco anything he wants unless its something really expensive that he cannot afford himself then no. "I promise you'll get your snuggling session afterwards," he said, intertwining their hands together as they began walking off the stage together. "Oh, I also forgot to tell you how beautiful your singing voice is."
"HERMIONE!" He yelled, needing help to pick out his clothes for the date. But he knew he should be able to do this, to find something to wear. He wasn't this nervous when dressing for Ginny. It was always simple, a pair of pants and a shirt but it all depends on the weather. Today, as he looked outside his bedroom window, he could see a nice blue sky with a few clouds floating by. The birds outside in the trees were chirping happily, and Harry shook his head knowing he was getting distracted. But as he turned around, Hermione was already in his room, in her light purple pyjamas and looked sleepy but irritated. Oops, thought Harry and slowly backed up to his closet.
"What?" Harry says with a shrug and looked up at Draco, silver eyes meeting green. He smiled and caught up to him. Beds back then should be comfy, right? Maybe they are made from a different material. "If that was Helga's room, I'd like to see how comfy beds were back in her days."
Harry saw it was the belt he'd always get beaten with, he quickly walked back slowly towards the stairs for an escape but Uncle Vernon came rushing into the room and grabbed Harry by the arm and dragged him upstairs to his room. Harry struggled to get loose and knew it was going to be as bad as it was before. Uncle Vernon shoved Harry into his room, yanked the belt hard with each hand to test its strength and sneered at Harry.
Harry, however, wasn't as excited. Since the beginning of the year, Ginny had been giving subtle hints on him to make a move.  And since the announcement of the 'Snitch A Kiss', Ginny had not so subtly suggested for him to fly over to her during the game to help her that they were the 'perfect match'. Truthfully, Harry would rather kiss a toad.
"Do you think the word is going to spread that I'm... you know... into guys?" Harry asked suddenly, wanting to change the subject. He did a quick search of the room for any sign of Ron, but he wasn't anywhere to be seen. He just had to make sure. He will tell Ron about his sexuality, just not yet.
Harry exited the Gryffindor common room with his invisibility cloak hiding him from others, and the Marauders Map showing if there are any teachers coming his way, he could easily get to the Prefects Bathroom. As he did so, he quickly said the password "Pine Fresh" and ducked behind the statue of Boris the Bewildered into the bathroom.
Draco elbowed Crabbe hard in the ribs for his rudeness. How dare the git not like Harry because Harry's just a wonderful human being that deserves all the love and attention in the world. "Oww!" Crabbe whined and rubbed at his ribs.
"Oh, but he said much more than that," Pansy said, a mischievous smile spread on her lips. "Famous Harry Potter, his wonderful smile, intense but pretty emerald green eyes, lips that look as soft as a cloud, black sexy as hair and of course, my favourite and the most humorous, that hot sexy ass."
Draco still found it adorable that Harry had checked him out as it reminded him of the third year, except he was doing the checking out. He loves that smile, those perfect lips he just wants to kiss every day. That black hair, no matter how messy it is but it always seems to be hotter every day and Draco just wants to run his fingers through it. Those beautiful Emerald green eyes. He just wishes he can tell Harry how attractive and incredible he is. He bit his lip as he had been staring at Harry's lips which he wished he could kiss so slowly and lovingly.
Harry leaned closer to Draco as he couldn't help it. Every time those silver eyes look into his green ones, his heartbeat would pick up rate and he would feel a little dizzy. Not the bad kind of dizzy. The good dizzy. He was dizzy in love. His hands slid around Draco's waist, and as he sees a lovely gleam in Draco's eyes, he closes his eyes and leans in for a kiss.
Harry shook his head and said, "Nope." Not once has he considered going out with someone in the past beside Draco. But he just doesn't think he's attractive or fit enough for people to like him that way. He looked at the blonde Slytherin next to him. "Draco, truth or dare."
Harry sighed in relief; he didn't know if his mental health could deal with people calling him bad words all the time because of who he is. "Okay," he said and the first thought that pops into his mind is Draco and the flying date they have... Flying tryst. "Thank you for the talk, Hermione."
McGonagall had come over to the Gryffindor table and was chatting with Harry. He stood up and walked away with her as if each day there were dragons battling. Draco felt a surge of anger at McGonagall. Did she really think Harry's best way to brace himself was to sit through all of his morning classes and then spend lunch in the Great Hall packed with cat-calling students? Draco acknowledged much of the disdain coming from the Slytherin table.
Draco recalls trying to flirt with Harry loads of times, but people only thought he was being his 'normal' rude self. Like last year in Hagrid's class with the Hippogriff, Draco kept checking Harry out a lot to show him his true feelings, but he never truly saw how he really felt.
"Ron!" Hermione snapped, grabbing another book from her book bag and began hitting Ron hard on the shoulder repeatedly with her other book and snapped, "You fowl little piglet!" Ron flinched from the girl and her hard books she likes hitting people with.
Harry hugged back gently and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "Shh... It's going to be okay, Draco," he told him soothingly. "We should go somewhere until evening, just to relax and cuddle." He leaned away from the hug and raised his hands up to the Slytherin's face so he could wipe away the falling tears with his thumb. "Sound good?"
"You can have some if you want," Harry said and put his glasses back on. They were so much cleaner! Merlin... "Thank you." He grabbed the glass vile with the clear liquid in it. He wanted to drink it, but the thought of a sleeping Draco made him feel excited and tingly inside. "I'm also exhausted at walking from one side of the castle to the next."
Draco didn't have the badge on his robe since the incident in Potions because he's seen how sad Harry had looked. He hated seeing his crush and best friend sad, especially over something the Slytherins all did. Creating the stupid badges, he tried to get Crabbe, Goyle and Theodore to take the badges off but they didn't listen.
"Don't you mean an afternoon kiss?" Harry corrected him with a smile. "And I'll gladly give one to you." And that's when he leaned in, while Draco tilted his head to the side, and Harry attached his lips to the blondes. They kissed slowly and tenderly, forgetting where they are for a moment as the kiss shuts down their minds but keeps their hearts beating like drums and as one.
Harry chuckled, wrapping his hands around Draco’s neck, and pulling him into a hug. He just didn’t know they were being stared at by everyone in the bookstore. However, Draco did. He wanted the world to know that Harry was now taken. Taken by himself.
He checked the time with a "Tempus!". He could not believe his eyes. It was 10:00 already? Unless he and Ron went down for an early breakfast... Yeah, that must be it! Time flies fast when you are having fun. No wonder the time was so slow at the Dursleys. The only things that made the time fly by were the chores he was instructed to do. But it did not matter, as long as he was working hard on something as it always took his mind off his depression and everything else.
"Stop! That's enough!" Dudley seemed a little apprehensive now, and Harry had no idea why. "Let him suffer here, he's the least of our problems," he said as he hesitated at the sight of his cousin, turned around and began walking back towards home.
Harry could smell something utterly familiar coming from Draco. Citrus and Vanilla. But Harry didn't know where he had recently smelt it from, other than Draco, of course. Draco could feel Harry wincing in the hug which he pulled out and studied him. "I'm so sorry!"
"What on Earth are you doing?" Harry asks and he leans down on his side, staying in position and looks under the table. The Slytherin winked at him, making Harry blush, and he watched as Draco leaned forward towards his crotch and the next thing he sees, no, feels, is Draco's nose rubbing at his crotch from inside his pants.
"He couldn't have, Albus," said Professor McGonagall. She knew none of her students or Professor Flitwick's students at any age knew any spells that difficult. "He would not know of any spells that advanced. Not even any 6th years know these kinds of spells."
Mr Weasley gathered everybody up in the dining room. "Alright everyone, time to go," he called, getting everyone out of the burrow with bags filled with food and supplies.
Joslyn made a gesture at Harriet to let her know she wanted to be alone with Draco. Harriet nodded and walked out of the lounge room with her laptop. Joslyn quickly turned on the TV, plugged a USB into the back of the TV and found the folder that says 'Harry Potter', clicked on it with the remote and played 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'.
"They are blades," Harry told her shyly while he toyed with the blade with his fingers. But he was careful so he doesn't cut his fingers and risk having to go to the Hospital Wing to see Madam Pomfrey to get it fixed. Even if it was a small scratch. "They come off a shaver."
Hermione stopped just in time and looked back towards the entrance from where she and Ron had just flown out of. Harry and Malfoy had fallen off their brooms and landed on top of one another. Well, Malfoy was on top of Harry and she could see very clearly the look on Harry's face. Hermione grinned, but the bet could be the other way around. She flew towards Ron, stopping as she has neared the two blokes. "No! You better have 10 galleons, Ron, because I'm pretty sure Harry's the one who'll be snogging Malfoy."
Blaise frowned. That's a lot of people that know of his crush on Ron. "Okay, that's a lot of people," he said, nearly squeakishly and tried not to sound panicked. Too late. "Anyway... um... just please don't kiss him again." He frowned at the ground and rubbed his arm up and down.
"I'm not sure," Ivy said and shrugged though she had a game in mind. A game which she'll see what she wants to see with one simple word. "Truth or dare? Never have I ever or Exploding Snap?"
Draco and Harry looked at each other even more surprised, they didn't think this could happen in a garden. But this was Hogwarts, anything could happen if you knew where to look.
The professor caught Dean and Seamus snogging at their desk, he made the spider fly around them to try and stop but it didn't work. He had to separate the couple, placing Dean in the front and Seamus in the back row. Both Seamus and Dean eyed each other sadly, wishing they could be near each other again. They even sent love notes to each other for fun, they didn't care if the professor caught them and read the whole notes out to the class.
"Not too sure," Harry said with a shrug and felt shivers run down his spine at the thought of walking into a room filled with magical deadly algae or animals. "I'm so glad I didn't try opening the Ravenclaw or Gryffindor doors. Who knows what I could have come face to face with?"
"Morning Ron and Merry Christmas," Harry said drowsily and gave a weak pensive smile. This is his fourth Christmas ever, and he is kind of glad that Ron stayed behind so he wasn't lonely. But loneliness on Christmas day would have been a good but woeful thing to him. It just meant more time to suffer, but to top that off he does get presents. But does he even deserve the presents for the lies he has told everyone?
Hermione was eating her bowl of curry in peace, she looked up at her best friends 'fighting' over food. She couldn't believe how childish Ron was acting. "Ron!" she hissed. "Harry had the nachos first; you can't just take it off of him. Besides, there's probably another bowl somewhere."
After painting the entire house, a new colour instead of black, which took around three days, Draco headed up to his room for a long break. While passing all the family portraits on the second floor, he heard a ruffle of feathers. Date was all that came into Draco's mind. He smiled and headed to the owl room. An owl as white of snow with the tiniest black dots on her feathers sat on the porch with a letter in its mouth.
"You're welcome?" Harry asked and was uncertain about why Draco was thanking him. What exactly did he do? "But why are you thanking me? I didn't do anything."
"Harry, come over here," Ivy shouted but turned around to look at Harry who he made his way towards her. She held her cousin gently in her hands, trying not to squeeze him too much. The thought of doing so made her shudder. "Don't worry Draco, we'll fix you," she whispered to the fluffy ferret's fury ears with a cheeky smile.
"Hmmm... Harry Malfoy or Draco Potter," Narcissa added and decided to play along with her husband. "I think Draco Potter is best, don't you think so Harry?"
"Harry Potter. Put your wand away!" Professor Sprout moved forward, pushing students out of the way to get to the pair. "You are late. I'm sorry but I have to give you a Detention. You may serve it tonight with Mr Malfoy, who-" Professor Sprout turned and stared down at Draco, "somehow is incapable of growing up and stopping a dirt fight before it gets out of hand. And Mr Weasley, ten points from Gryffindor for actually throwing dirt around the room." Draco nonchalantly hid his hand under the table, dropped the dirt on the floor and walked away.
"Oh, ha-ha!" Ivy said in disbelief with a roll of her eyes. If this was some trick of Pansy's it was not going to work. She doesn't give up that easy. She decided to drop Draco off at Harry first and then do Pansy. It'll be much easier as she knows Pansy can get a little whiny.
"That I like doing both but I'm the bottom in this relationship," Harry said with a happy smile as Draco's shirt finally came off. Harry ran his hands over his lithe body and tugged him closer to him.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Harry told him bitterly. He doesn't know what Malfoy is playing at and he doesn't like it. Although, it's slowly making his blood rush to his cheeks. Especially with that attractive smile and wink the blonde Slytherin gave him. That wink and smile was for him and only him.
Ivy rolled her eyes at him. All she wants is for her cousin to do the last question since the first one was too late to be said, except that time Harry actually asked him to be his Yule Ball partner. Oh, she was smiling the entire day as she was so happy for her cousin. "You have to do it someday," she told him in a sad tone. "Remember the promise?"
"Wait... what do you mean for me?" Ron asked with furrowed eyebrows, not understanding any of this. What did his fellow dormmate mean? "Why the bloody hell do I need it, Nev?" His voice became quieter as if he's embarrassed to say what was on his mind. "Why do I need to be kissed by you?"
Draco walked up to Harry and reached his hand out to touch Harry's chest. Harry smiled and pulled off Draco's cardigan and shirt out of the waistband of his trousers. "Ginny and Seamus were trying to figure out which one of us is top and who's the bottom," he said absentmindedly, wanting Draco's shirt off already.
"Yep," Draco said silently, but all that was on his mind was Harry and what he could be doing right now. The thing is, he doesn't even know where Harry goes to hurt himself if he does hurt himself like Ivy does. He hasn't exactly seen any cuts on Harry's wrists, but he has a feeling Harry has them. He doesn't know the password to the Gryffindor common room either so even if he is there, he won't be able to reach him unless he goes through Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. However, he is sure he'd get hexed if he stepped foot into the Gryffindor common room.
Ivy smiled at Ron and tried to make it as big as possible as she reaches over and shakes his hand. "Hello Ron, I'm Ivy," she says and after the handshake, she grabs her fork and cuts mini slices into the strawberry jam scone. "Ivy Black."
"Weasley," Draco greeted back with a nod. At least the Weasel showed some courtesy, not like he did back when they first met. He's glad Harry has such good friends, even if he hasn't actually met these two other Gryffindor's fully. He'd like to, to be honest.
Harry entered the Potions classroom and he walked over and sat next to Ron. Ron gave him a little pat on the shoulder and a smile which Harry forced a smile back at him. He noticed Draco sitting over with all the Slytherins. If he wasn't feeling so numb, he'd so wanted to sit next to him.
Draco just looked at her, confused. A strange rectangular box called a television. What in Merlin's name is that?! "Alright," he said. "I may as well adhere you guys at some time for the duration of the week."
As Harry exited the Grand Hall he zoned out, thinking about the last time Uncle Vernon punished him. He remembered how much it hurt, the sting of the belt as it hit his skin. It was like a snake attacking him, striking at his back. Harry flinched at the memory. It was like he was re-living the punishment, feeling the belt hit him repeatedly. Hearing Uncle Vernon telling him he's not getting any food for a week. Before he knew it, he was directly in front of the Lat Lady's portrait.
Draco, Pansy, and Blaise got to their feet, which was very hard to do as the barrel just moved which made them nearly lose their balance again and fall on top of each other. But they managed to stable themselves and stop moving, which stopped the spinning barrel from moving. But this situation was difficult. They didn't know how to escape. Whenever they tried to move, the spinning tunnel would move with them.
"Yeah, and?" Draco asked her with raised eyebrows. He was uncertain what she wanted him to do about it. What could he do? He has a feeling Harry hasn't told Granger or Weasel about their friendship so that would be a problem if he just goes up there and asks him out. Unless Harry did tell them, and he wouldn't be mad at all. It's Harry's decision whether he wants to tell his friends or not and if he trusts them enough to not spill it out to the world. "What am I supposed to do about it? Ask him out or something?"
Draco rolled his eyes at her, grabbed his plate, and left the room to eat in silence with nobody to disturb him but the chirps of birds in the distance. "Goodbye, mother."
Harry returned the smile, especially when being called by his first name. He gave his attention back to the massive shadow figure he saw floating around some trees and pointed his wand at it. "EVERTE STATUM!" he shouted, watching as an orange beam of light flew out of his wand and hit the creature. He quickly moved back to the tree with Draco and panted.
Draco rushed into the Gryffindor common room and took in what he saw. This looked nothing like the Slytherin common room. The common room wasn't long, low roofed, green and silver. Instead, it was small, tall, red, and gold and looked like a tower. He ignored the stares from the other Gryffindors and turned back to Hermione. "Where are the dorms?"
"No, this cannot be happening," said Timothy and his mouth fell open slightly. He shook his head, not wanting to believe this at all. "This just... no! How the hell... Is there a new spell you came up with or something?"
Draco and Pansy had just left the Yule Ball to search for their best friend. The dance with Harry was still on Draco's mind, it made him a bit less worried and the neck kiss Harry gave him helped a bit more too. But it couldn't change the fact that Ivy was out in the castle somewhere and all alone. He kept looking up at the ceiling or the high windows for her as they rushed through the castle as he knows she can get up to high spots in the castle.
Draco looked in the bucket again, and he curled his lip. "Ugh," he groaned, and that groan went right down to Harry's groin which he moved on his seat a little uncomfortably. "Look in the drawers over there."
Draco was about to say, 'I'd like to ask you the same thing', but he stopped himself and sighed. He looked to Harry, smiled, and placed his hand over Harry's and gave it a little squeeze. "Harry, if I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes. Because only then will you realize how special you are to me." He placed his free hand on Harry's cheek and just caressed it whilst seeing Harry blush from underneath his fingers and his cheeks slightly warmed up. He thought about kissing Harry's cheek, but Granger was there and he rather this be a private moment between him and Harry.
Harry looked back up into Draco's stunning silvery eyes again, and a flush crept up his face. "Sorry, Draco," he said, and he cleared his throat. This just couldn't be happening. He was supposed to be on his way to class and not bump into the hottest guy in school. Well, he knows others don't fawn over Draco like he does. Not even any girls.
Draco sighed happily and rolled over, placing his arms around Harry where he can and snaked their legs together. He gave Harry one last slow kiss goodnight before lowering and resting his head on the soft blue velvet pillow. He closed his eyes and fell asleep next to his boyfriend. Harry smiled lovingly at him, gave Draco a forehead kiss and fell into a deep sleep in Draco's arms.
They then headed out of the bedroom, out of the Transfiguration Courtyard and down to the Great Hall together. As soon as they got close enough to the Great Hall, they dropped their hands from each other's grasp and walked over to their required tables with a sigh. They both didn't want to but knew they should spend a little bit of time apart, just so people won't suspect anything, but they didn't care if word got out.
Lucius looked at his son with concern running all over his face, especially with the reddening of his son's cheeks.
Harry sighed and pressed his lips together. As the train started moving, he got lonely and bored and decided to sit with Neville, Ginny and a Ravenclaw girl. He smiled at the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor snogging each other. "Hey, Neville!" he whispered, sitting next to his fellow roommate who held what looked like a cactus but alive and... breathing?
Harry couldn't take this any more. He was blushing like mad and it was all because of Malfoy. He took a few steps towards Malfoy, grabbed his robes and pulled him closer into a kiss. he didn't expect the Slytherin's lips to be this soft, or smooth against his lips. It was a perfect slide of lips.
The potions classroom door slammed shut, that could only mean Professor Snape had entered. "We'll be making antidotes today. I'm sure you have all the required ingredients and have completed the recipes. We just need someone to test it out on." Snape looked directly towards Harry.
Ivy looked up at the person approaching her and her cousin and smiled. She hoped he liked the gifts she gave him. She had to go to the muggle world to get it all which she didn't mind at all. "Merry Christmas, Harry!"
Harry was laughing as he wrote these predictions down which actually are good and hilarious. The twins kept feeding him predictions and he wrote them down as fast as he could. "So, you guys aren't angry at me for apparently putting my name in the goblet?" he then suddenly asked.
Harry was nearly mesmerised at this sight of Draco showing him a part of his body which Draco only sees. He felt somewhat special because this dick was beautiful. "You're gorgeous," he whispers. "Every damn part of you." And the sight of the semen dripping out of the slit just turned him on again. He could just see the little blonde hairs coming through on the blonde's groin and he smiled in adoration as he was seeing Draco's path to manhood.
Harry sat with Ron in Potions, as always. He glanced up at the Slytherin table a few times and met eyes with a certain silver-eyed blonde Slytherin. He faked a smile at the Slytherin and turned back to making his potion, but he could still feel the blonde's eyes on him. This always gave him butterflies in his stomach.
The door swung open and the short figure of Sprout filled the doorway. She looked sharply between Harry and Draco. "You have forty minutes left of class to re-pot the saplings, may I suggest you get started?" Professor Sprout then stalked away, leaving the door open.
Draco smelt the pine in Harry's shampoo and conditioner. Although, he smelt banana flavoured gel in his hair. Weasley! he thought and scowled. Draco ignored the thought of Ronald Weasley putting hair Gel in his boyfriend's hair. He continued to dance slowly with Harry, and he squeezed Harry's hand, feeling a little squeeze back from Harry.
"So, what are we going to do whilst we're here?" Harry then asks him, looking down on his nose where Draco kissed him and feeling like he could cook eggs on his burning face. He probably could cook eggs with his blushing face.
Everyone had returned to eating, discussing what they'll wear and who to take. Dumbledore was about to head back to his seat but decided to say a few last words. "Actually...." Every head turned back to the headmaster and Dumbledore smiled at everyone. "Only muggle-borns and some half-bloods will get this joke. Why does Voldemort prefer Twitter over Facebook?"
Hermione ignored the rude ignorant Slytherin and began telling the class about the creature they will be learning about. "A Niffler is a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. They are attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept or set loose indoors. Nifflers, in general, are usually harmless."
Draco laughed at the memory of Harry trying to dance with that Parvati twin. "Yes, I remember your failure at dancing, Potter," he teased, smirking at the flush on the Gryffindor's face.
When Harry went down to the front door and apparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place, the first person he sees in the kitchen is Hermione. He gulped down the fear of her lashing out at him and tried his best to tiptoe past her into the kitchen.
Harry and Ron were so excited they couldn't stop bugging Hermione, well, Ron bothered her the most and Harry only faked his excitement as he just felt too depressed these days to be excited about something. Harry knew better than to anger Hermione, he never liked to anger anyone he cared for. He knew how to keep his emotions tucked away, he's been doing that his whole life, except when Snape kept pestering Harry about his father and how 'Ignorant' and 'Lazy' he was.
"Are you going first, mate, or will it be me?" asked Ron as he turned back around and hopped off his chair. He rested his hands on the desk Hermione was working on and watched the little swirls rising up.
The room had been lightened up by the 'Lumos Maxima' Harry cast and Harry stared at the room in wonder, deciding whether he liked this room better than the Hufflepuff one. The walls and roof were painted a cobalt blue, the floor was covered with wooden floorboards, there is a gigantic telescope in the middle of the room pointing directly at the roof and there is a large sky window on the roof directly above the telescope. To the right lay a canopy black and blue old vintage bed, with midnight blue drapes hanging from the sides like curtains.
"I really love when you do that," Harry mumbles and feels sleep pull at him. He's never felt sleepy when he's laying alone but whenever he's with Draco, it seems too easy. It is easy. He loves how the Slytherin makes him feel and how his body reacts to whatever Draco does or says.
Harry's frown grew into a small smile after the small little insult from Draco. Speaking of owls... Harry still hadn't owled Sirius back, he made a mental note to do it this afternoon. "Thanks, Draco," he said benevolently, although flushing when Draco mentioned the word 'date'. He thought of a different type of date. "I can't wait!"
"Um, yeah?" Harry replied awkwardly with a little shrug. Merlin, this was hard. It shouldn't be hard to talk about though. "However, we were just talking about me."
"I kissed Draco a couple of times," Harry then said and smiled at the memories of the dancing, the few little kisses on the mouth, nose, forehead, and cheeks. And he couldn't forget the little nuzzles with his nose in Draco's neck and his nose.
"You sound like you're in love with him, Harry," Ginny said sweetly, elbowing Harry in the arm and smiling.
“Yes,” Draco replies quickly, his smile widening as he knows what Harry was about to ask him. He kissed Harry’s nose, wanting to see those bright green eyes again. But the best thing he saw was a dark shade of red appears on Harry’s face.
Harry gave a smile at that note and looked back up at Draco which he nodded, and Draco nodded back with a smile. That charming smile, the one Harry loved so much but was never able to kiss. He quickly slipped the note into his robe pocket so if he'd forget anything he can just peek at the note.
"Um... nothing," Harry said quickly, not looking them in the eye and instead, looking down at the floor. He wouldn't tell them, of course. He doesn't want them to worry either way. The disbelieving looks the twins and Ron were giving him made him sigh. He had to at least tell them something, but not relating to what really happened.
"Um, never mind that..." Draco said and rubbed the side of his neck a little awkwardly. Why was he here actually? Did he have something to say? Yes, he did. He had to ask Harry out and to the Yule Ball. "I guess it is, so I don't draw attention to myself for calling you 'Harry'.
Aha! Michael Corner's trying to escape. She grinned. Good luck with escaping now, Corner. Nightshade neighed and got up on her back legs and Hannah held on tight so she wouldn't fall off.
Ivy grabbed a sausage roll and nibbled at it slowly, tasting that disgusting ashy flavour she dislikes. Draco watched his suffering cousin and shook his head sadly. "You really need to start eating more, Ivy," he said seriously but in a soft tone just so she doesn't feel worse. "It's not healthy to feel sick after eating something so small. I'll do everything in my power to help you, but you need to let me help you. You need to bring down those walls of self-esteem and let me in."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked into the classroom and chose where to sit. They had Transfigurations with the Ravenclaws. Ron sat next to Harry, which surprised Harry a little. They were next to where Dean and Seamus sat. Hermione of course, decided to sit on her own so she wouldn't be distracted by her friends.
{Maybe I wouldn't be here, in this position.} Draco just feels as if this song is a part of him. He really wants to go back in time and do something all over again, to gain a friendship he never had the chance to obtain. He would have done it differently too, and not acting like the snobby little rich kid he was back in his first year.
Draco continued to try helping Harry dance the ballroom style, even if it took nearly the rest of supper to do. They slow danced and looking into each other's eyes. Draco pushed back Harry's fringe from his eyes and leaned down to kiss him. Harry kissed back with a smile, already missing the feel of Draco's lips sliding against his, and as Draco licked Harry's bottom lip for entrance, Harry gave it to him easily. Draco entered his tongue in Harry's mouth and caressed the Gryffindor's tongue, tasting him once again but deep down inside him, he could feel he wanted more. He wanted this relationship to progress slowly, though. Just like how his best friend Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom's relationship developed. It was a surprise when Blaise told him, they were secretly dating for the past year and a half. He didn't know who else Blaise told, but he was glad he was hopefully the first one who was told.
Neville flinched at the shove but kept the smile on his face. "What?" he asked him proudly, feeling as if that was the bravest thing he'd ever done. Well, it wasn't really but it was nice to try. "I did that for you as you need it."
Harry's blush returned to his cheeks, and he smiled at the blonde Slytherin. This incredible, attractive as hell bloke just complimented him. He's either hit himself hard in the head or he's dreaming. Although, if he really hit himself in the head and this actually happened then he doesn't mind. "Thanks, Draco. You're p-pretty too. Uh-, I mean... incredible!" Jesus fucking Christ. That did not just happen! He's just feeling like an idiot and he should run away.
"And what if Harry and I are naked in bed?" Draco asked and sounded quite amused. He'd like to know what Potter's skin feels like under his own, the grunts he'll make during sex and the moans. Okay, he knows he's going a bit too far there. They haven't even been on their first date yet. "Would you still hunt me down and drag my naked ass out of there?"
Harry noticed Fred was already at the table, and he sat down on the right side to Fred. Draco tried sitting down but when he tried grabbing the chairs they just moved to the side and out of his reach. It was like they were playing chasey or Tag with Draco.
"Was that really necessary, Draco?" Harry asked him while taking a bite from his wrap. Although, it was kind of funny watching the muggle boy dance away uncontrollably. "I mean, isn't it illegal to cast spells in muggle populated areas?"
Ivy sighed and tapped her fingers on the table with boredom, wishing she really had those tarot cards she got for Christmas so she can see if she will be lucky today. "Just kiss already!" she mumbled quietly enough so nobody could hear her as Ron and Blaise were talking amongst each other, and there was a little more chatting coming from around them and the Professor's table.
"Of course," Harry said automatically as he really does hate having to vomit out anything he eats, as well as the thought of food made him sick. He just wants to eat a normal meal like a normal person would. "Sorry for interrupting you, and I'd be happy to test it out."
When Draco's bag was in arms reach, Harry grabbed it and searched the bag for the vials. "Thanks, Draco." Thankfully, he found one, unscrewed the cork from the top and drank the whole vial. It tasted a little like cherries which he didn't mind and when he was done, he put the cork back on and put it back in Draco's bag. He wiped around his mouth, careful not to wipe the kiss off if that was possible. He wanted to keep the kiss on his lips all day so he can remember it.
"So, which crystal is ours, Professor?" Parvati asked while she was looking at the table with colourful crystals glimmering in the classroom. She hoped to get the other pink one, or the purple one! The blue looks nice.
Draco nodded and grabbed an apple from the breakfast basket and got up. But as he knew Harry hadn't eaten anything, he grabbed a Manista and a Mekitsa for Harry and gave them to him. "You need to eat, Harry," he told him carefully but as an order. "You need your energy for today."
Hermione calmly nodded but she still was unsure about her friend being with Draco. But if Harry trusts him then she'll trust Draco a little bit. "Alright, if you are sure about this."
Harry smiled at him. "Morning, George." He tried not to call the twin less man 'Georgie' as he knew Fred used to call him that all the time and he just doesn't want to trigger the man. When staring into those brown eyes of George's, he could see something very concerning. Those eyes looked quite... empty. It was like the man wasn't alive. Oh, he hoped he wasn't seeing a ghost.
Harry nodded sadly and looked up into Draco's silver eyes. He didn't want him to worry. Draco stared back into glossy teary eyes. It was heartbreaking seeing such a beautiful soul so broken and depressed, so he closed the gap between them in a soft and slow kiss. Harry began to cry into the kiss, letting the tears fall down his cheeks and one or two tears entered his mouth.
"So, did you put your name in the Goblet?" Ron asked critically, staring at Harry for an honest reply. All he wanted was honesty from his best mate and no silly bias.
Draco looked up at Harry and shook his head. "You shouldn't be, Harry,” he smiled at him as he patted the snowy white owls’ soft feathers. “I'm the one who loves you, not your owl."
Ivy watched Harry leave the Gryffindor table and her cousin Draco did too. She noticed that Harry had the sort of vibe and expression she usually has when she wants to be alone. "Dray, Harry just left the Great Hall," she whispered into his ear, though he already knew as he was staring at him. "This could be a chance to ask him to the Yule Ball or even ask him out."
Harry was in the Potions classroom and was sitting next to Neville since all the other places were full. He didn't dislike Neville; he was actually very smart once you get to know him. He was like one of those 'geeks' muggles call.
George just nodded. "I'm fine, truly!" Harry didn't know if he should believe the Weasley brother or not. The death of Fred had really hit George hard across the chest. He could see how hurt the older boy was, how depressed he looked. He just hoped George had a way of coping with Fred's murder that wasn't anything concerning.
"And how are you?" Harry asked her, forcing himself to chuckle a bit at the response he got from her. He wondered if Hermione and Pansy are mutual friends or even more. That would be nice to see, his best friend being loved by someone.
"Seriously Harry, don't do that!" Hermione hissed at him and calmed her racing heart with a few deep breaths. She's lucky her dad taught her how to calm herself when having panic attacks, not that she's had any.
When he knew his dorm mates were asleep, he quickly grabbed his new metal friend from inside the book he kept it in as well as the one from the sock. He made his way down into Moaning Myrtles Bathroom and found an empty 'Eclipse mints' tub in a cupboard and put his little sharp friends in it. Nobody has ever used or touched it ever, nobody probably knows it's there, so he thought that would be a good hiding spot. He put a ward around the tin so nobody can open the tin and find his little friends in the future.
"Who are they?" Seamus asked when staring at the people wearing weird gowns and suits. It's like they went back in the future to the 1700s. But he mainly stared at a dark brown-skinned man who he swore looked a little familiar.
"Ah, I see." Silence had crowded the space among Harry and Fred for a moment. "Did you want to test that theory then, Harry?" Fred then asked with a challenging smile, lightly licking his lips.
Draco tried opening the door again and again. It still wasn't doing anything, so he pointed his wand at the door and muttered, "Alohomora!" It did nothing. What's wrong with this door? Doesn't it not know easy spells like Alohomora? What other spells could it open up by? Maybe by saying the animal it will open the door. "What's 'badger' in Latin?"
"Yeah." Ron was looking around Harry, trying to see where Draco was. "I don't know what happened," he told Harry innocently. "We were just getting the soil and he shoved past me and then I shoved him back and threw dirt at him..."
Harry was the first one down, with Draco following from behind. What he didn't expect, or maybe he did expect it, was to be pinned to one of the walls of the Burrow and feel soft lips against his own. The kiss was gentle, and Harry kissed Draco back with equal the amount of gentleness. He opened an eye just to get a sneak peek of his beautiful boyfriend and noticed the early morning sunlight was shining through one of the large windows to the side of Draco and his hair looked almost golden. So handsome, pretty... How could he be so lucky?
“I know ye would do anything ter get what ye want, Malfoy,” Hagrid bitterly said back. And while he and Lucius were arguing, Harry and Draco quietly snuck out of the store and with a little help from Draco, they made their way to Diagon Alley.
"Go mbrise an diabhal do dhá chois," spat Seamus to the little girl, pointing a finger at her. The girl's body was halfway out of the tv.
"No," said Harry and he rubbed at his neck. He doesn't know how he will make it out alive from this task. What he really needed was luck if he were to survive the dragons today.
"I'm not your uncle, Harry. It's me, Ron. Do you remember where you are?" Ron didn't understand why Harry was so upset about this nightmare he had. What was his Uncle doing to him in his dream? He hoped it wasn't anything terrible. He is sure as bloody hell hoped Harry wasn't being hurt because he will storm that muggle's house and hex that bloody bastard of an Uncle no matter if he's not allowed to do magic underage.
Ivy looked at her with a smile. She's actually never thought about how the day was. She just let it happen. But she had to admit that it was the best day of her life. "It was spectacular!" she beamed, and then poked Lavender on the shoulder, "Especially since it was with you."
"Do you want to get a picture or two with your friends?" Harry then asks him, and he moved his hands down to Draco's to intertwine them together. He glanced from Draco's eyes, down to his lips and back up again, biting his lip with a smile. "Or we can get one together."
Harry was both happy and confused as to why they hadn't killed each other yet, but he still couldn't help but indulge his curiosity. "Say, Malfoy, why are you even over here in the first place?".
"Don't be so sure of that," Draco muttered under his breath with a slight smile, enjoying this little three on one argument. Can't Weasel and Granger just go away now so that he can be alone with Harry? Its what he wants right now.
Harry winced at the angry snake and leaned his back against the tree trunk. "Sssorry, Ssserpentine. I wasss cursed asss a baby. Voldemort killed my parentsss with the killing curssse and tried killing me but the ssspell rebounded and killed him inssstead." He lifted his fringe up for the snake can see his scar. "Ssso, the ssscar isss a curssse. I wasss not born with the Parssseltongue ability. Asss Voldemort'sss ssspell rebounded off me, a part of hisss sssoul trapped itssself inssside me ssso I can ussse hisss Parssseltongue abilitiesss."
Joslyn smiled at the thought of her, reminding Draco of Pansy Parkinson, a witch from the United Kingdom. "You know, there are stories about Harry Potter, you and other people," she said honestly. Of course, there are stories! Harry Potter is famous in the wizarding world.
Ron sighed and laid his head back on the chair. The sounds of the crackling fireplace, the smell of the fire and watching the snow falling down from the sky was so relaxing. Before he knew it, the relaxing sounds were making him give away to sleep.
"I...um..." George took a pause and exhaled slowly; Harry knew how hard it was for George to talk about this. "I-" George flushed, not really proud of how else he copes with his grief. "Sex, Harry. I deal with it all with sex."
Draco gives Harry's forehead another slow kiss and he feels Harry slowly nodding off into sleep. He's looking forward to alone times with Harry like this in the future, where their snogging, cuddling, or just lying down next to each other. But he needs to figure out how he'll plan their very first date. Nowhere in Hogwarts is romantic unless he finds somewhere nice. Maybe a picnic under the Willow tree will be nice? But where will he get the food? Could he order some in from Hogsmeade? Probably. He'll figure it out soon. Oh, but when will he tell Ivy and Pansy that he's finished the promise? When Pansy comes back, she would have a lot on her mind about the first kiss he had with Harry anyway, so he'll leave it for later. He yawned silently and nuzzled his nose in Harry's pine-scented hair. When he closed his eyes, he fell into a deep sleep.
"Leave him alone," Ginny hissed, standing up for Harry. She looked pissed but Draco didn't care as he ignored her.
Hermione gave Harry a knowing smile and continued eating her cereal. Can't the two boys just kiss already and date? It's getting a little annoying when she catches them both looking at each other secretly. Don't they see that they like each other? Goodness. She just thinks their hopeless romantics trying to get together when it's not working at all.
"Sure thing, Draco," Harry said with a nod and walked towards the library with Draco. They entered through the library, walked past the many bookshelves, took a left in the middle of the library to come to the familiar vertical bookshelves with the old wooden bookshelf on the very end of the aisle. Harry took a peek around the library, seeing nobody except Draco and pulled the trigger for the bookshelf to open. They walked into the tunnel, the familiar torches lighting up the path towards the door at the end. They emerged into the secret room and took off the invisibility cloak, Harry placed it on the couch's back.
To this day, he still doesn't know what man that's his heart's desire smells like Citrus, apples and Vanilla. Obviously, Hermione had told Ron that she smelt Ron in the Potion, but he doesn't know if Ron had told her of what he smelt. Ron actually never told Harry what he smelt, so that made him curious to what he did smell. But Harry knew Hermione's shampoo smelt of watermelon. So, he guessed Ron could smell that.
Blaise smiled at what he was hearing and wished he had someone to send Valentine's gifts to and receive them from. He was in his bed, reading one of his fashion magazines and surrounded by closed Slytherin green drapes. He knew he was probably forgotten by Draco and that was okay. Draco had Harry so he was happy as a sunflower.
The trip back to 4 Privet Drive was quite short, and Harry found out that Petunia had finished her shopping right after his little... whatever happened to him. He really didn't know what it was. Could it have been a panic attack?
"Thank you," Neville said kindly, straightened his tie and cleared his throat at what he wanted to ask the Slytherin. "So, are you going to ask him out or are you too chicken?"
"Okay, now you are going too far, Ms Parkinson!" Draco told her in a warning tone, narrowing his eyes at her to warn her to stop whatever she's about to do. Merlin, this woman can be a tough one to deal with "Give them here!"
"Miss Black, can you tell me your age?" Madam Pomfrey asked carefully as she took the younger witch up towards the Hospital wing. The nerves burned through her as she hoped she was wrong about what Ivy could possibly... have.
"S-Seamus," stuttered Neville, his face becoming pale as the clown guy opened its mouth, showing its sharp razor-like teeth.
Draco bites his lip, wanting to try this new position with Harry so he nods. "Shower first though," he tells him hotly and thrusts himself up. He tried to at least as Harry's weight was keeping him pressed on his bed. "You still need to finish where you left off."
Blaise, even though he hated this situation they were in, stepped into the blood and gagged. It was so sticky and stuck to the bottom of his slippers. "Eugh... Gross!"
Harry placed the tip of the blade between two red marks on his arm, before applying pressure and cutting his arm in three more places. The blood rose to his skin and trickled down his wrist, and the anxiety was pouring out of him onto the white floor. He kept staring at his arm, admiring the blood oozing out from the cuts he made. He then cast another quick "Tempus" charm, seeing that it was now 1:40 in the morning.
Ron's ears and face turned a bright red from embarrassment, but also from being caught. Harry dropped his jaw in shock, but quickly closed it as he had potatoes in his mouth. That was definitely something new to hear. His best mate had... God. He wants to congratulate him since he knows what it's like to have sex for the first time.
"Well, 'ello there everyone!" Hagrid said, smiling at his class. "Glad yer all could make it." He turned to Hermione with a smile. "'Ermione, I'm sure yer can tell us abou' Nifflers?"
Draco smirked at Harry and his moose antlers which fit his raven hair quite well and he looked very... cute. "Oh, but it was called for," he said in a mocking tone of voice. Merlin, he would love to see Harry in all the antlers he can charm onto him as possible. "You had your go, so it was my turn."
Draco really doesn't want his cousin eating garlic at all since he knows of her allergy. Even if she eats garlic with bigger meals he gets scared for her life. But he is glad she hardly eats garlic. Only on occasions as she does need it. Everyone needs garlic in their system. "Ivy needs to have garlic with something else like tomato sauce or with a different meal otherwise she goes all red and puffy. She's also on a special diet. She needs to eat meat a lot, but also plant-based sides on her plate too. Mainly meat..."
Harry started to panic. He hated hearing screams coming from people, especially in muggle movies because it's when they're getting...killed. Perhaps this maze wasn't meant to be entered? He heard the familiar screams from Ron and Hermione again, and then there was silence. God. He hated this so much.
The sound of Harry's low, sly laugh drew Draco's eyes away from his own cock, and he watched with silent, screaming impatience as Harry edged closer and closer, parting his lips tantalisingly until his mouth breathed hot air onto Draco's shaft. When he lowered his head and finally kissed his cock, Draco groaned so heavily it sounded like he was in pain.
"Pansy!" Draco hissed and tapped her hard on the shoulder, making his best friend jolt awake and look around her surroundings. Then she saw Ivy with tears streaming down her cheeks and frowned.
Draco looked out at the scenery, thinking maybe it would help him a bit. When he was about to ask, he felt a little nervous and shook his head. "Never mind. We better get to class," he says and turns away from the window to face Harry. "If you feel like you can't walk into a class next to me for some reason, I can give you a head start if you want."
Harry got up off the floor and walked towards the bathroom mirrors. He rolled up his sleeve with a hiss of pain to reveal the set of cuts which lay on his arms, dried blood staining his Pajamas. With that in mind, he didn't feel as he needed to clean his arm. Besides, he was going to wear his long-sleeved jumper and his robe anyway, so no one else could find out about his little... Problem. Unless he uses the spell.
"Malfoy's don't cry," Draco mumbled while ignoring Harry's heroic speech. Well, he definitely heard everything the Gryffindor said, and it really calmed him down. He looks down at the dark rocky ground while wiping his eyes with his sleeves.
Hermione looked at Harry's steak with a frown, then looked at him. She leaned to her best friends' ear and whispered, "Can I have half of your steak please, Harry?" She isn't hungry for steak, but her body needs it.
"Hey!" Draco said to his boyfriend and clenched his jaw in annoyance. Two can play it that way. He pointed his wand at Harry's robe and thought of his own house colour, "Colovaria!" He watched as Harry's Gryffindor coloured robe turned into a green Slytherin coloured robe. He chuckled and stared into Harry's green eyes.
Draco had just escaped Ivy from breakfast and made his way down to Defense against the Dark Arts. He was wondering about Harry and how he's managing with the terrible things Weasley had said. He was already halfway to class when he bumped into someone.
Draco kept up the rhythmic thrusting movements, loving the feel of Harry's hot and wet mouth on his prick. Before he knew it, the tension building in his gut was becoming warmer and he knew he would come soon.
Harry yawned, rubbed his eyes from sleep and looked up at the angel that lay next to him. "Morning," he said tiredly and could not believe he never had a nightmare during his slumber. Perhaps, it was because of having Draco near him. Yeah, that must be it.
Draco wrapped his arms tightly around Harry's stomach and leaned his head on Harry's shoulder, smelling the scent of Pine from the messy black hair. Such a beautiful scent. Before he knew it, he and Harry were soaring off towards the castle, hair blowing in the wind and holding onto Harry like his life depended on it, which it did.
Draco and Harry began to laugh quietly at that, knowing Neville probably did get carried away with Blaise on the dance floor. But then to everyone's surprise, Blaise leaned forward and finally kissed Neville. It excited Harry, Dean, Hermione, and Seamus so much.
"What a tiring day," Harry said while letting a yawn escape his mouth as he was heading down to the Great Hall with Draco by his side, holding his hand and smiling. But what he was looking forward to was after dinner with Draco.
"I honestly have no idea what any of those spirits are and that they even existed," said Draco as he leaned closer to Harry and looked down at the page Harry had begun reading. "I know what a Yeti is since it relates to the Bigfoot. A Jackalope I know of and I learnt something new about them thanks to you."
"Sorry..." Harry said slowly with remorse. Hedwig glared at Harry but then turned her head around to look the other way in ignorance.
"So, um... when were you last at Hogwarts?" Joslyn asked him, wanting to know because obviously, a muggle Potterhead wants to know about Hogwarts and when she'll get her Hogwarts letter!
Harry really wanted someone to hold on and cry on. Draco, he needed Draco. He wanted to tell him everything so he can get it off his chest. He could even go to one of those Psychiatrist meeting things with Ivy. It sounds alright.
Draco frowned a little from the obvious lie Harry was telling him, and it hurt but he knew it would be hard for Harry to talk about what he goes through with people. He gets it because Ivy's been the same too. It took her time to open up and she let Draco into her mind slowly and carefully. He knows about the lies and the tricks thanks to Ivy. "Okay. So... are we still going to walk into the Great Hall distanced or should we come out to everyone about our friendship?"
Harry blushed darker, and he bites his lip when staring at his boyfriend. "So, what exactly happens now?" he asked and decides to lay his head on Draco's shoulder and just let it rest there while he smells the scents of his boyfriend.
Draco watched as Voldemort's facial expression turned into something that looks liked it has lost its will to live. He noticed Harry didn't have a wand on him. Of course, he knew what he had to do but didn't know when to do it.
But as he made his way to Gryffindor Tower, he heard someone crying from Moaning Myrtles Bathroom. He curiously made his way down the stairs to the unused girl's bathroom; he heard the most amazing singing he'd ever heard in his life. Well, the only singing he's ever heard close to him instead of on tv or the radio. He didn't want to scare whoever was in there, so he just peeked around the corner of the arched doorway.
Draco wrapped his arms around his cousin in a tight embrace but who he thought about while hugging her was Harry. "Good night, my favourite cousin."
The Nun pulled Cecelia towards her, and Cecelia screamed for someone to help her, but nobody did. When the Nun had Cecelia in her arms, she flared her teeth at everyone in the room and dug her teeth into Cecelia's shoulder blades.
Harry chuckled with his mouth around Draco’s cock, and the vibrations of his mouth made the Slytherin moan. He descended his mouth down the shaft until his nose buried itself into Draco’s groin with little blonde hairs there and he got a good sniff of his boyfriend’s musky smell which went straight down to his own groin and gave him the need to have a hand down there stroking him or Draco’s mouth. He pulled off all the way, curled his fingers around the base and tongued at the little slit where precome was leaking out from.
Ron nodded his head; he had been platting Ginny's hair when she was younger. It was fun and it was a part of how they got along as kids. "Sure thing, mate. Do you know what you want your hair to look like? Like... Slicked back, undercut, et cetera."
Draco pulled away and shook his head, ignoring how incredible this guy kisses and how familiar his lips feel. He just feels so guilty, even if the guy kissed him. What if Harry walks into the garden and sees him with this guy together? "Sir, I told you..."
Draco rolled his eyes in a playful manner. He thought the confused look Harry made was very cute. Why was he thinking this now? C'mon Draco, keep it together. He felt a flush rush up his cheeks as he realized Harry's been staring at him for a while.
Draco frowned at Harry and blew him a kiss from the compartment door. Harry chuckled as he loved how their goodbyes are like. He grabbed the kiss from in the air and planted it on his cheek. Draco waved with a loving smile, but a hand grabbed him and pulled him away.
Lucius looked back down at the photo, watching the way his son looks into the other boy's eyes as they danced. It was just like his and Narcissa's wedding, staring at each other for what felt like an eternity. "I'm still not too sure but I do want our son to be happy. What do you think I should do?"
"Well, C'mon," Ron said, and his jaw clenched a little with impatience. He just wanted to get to the Great Hall so he can eat but he wants to travel there with his mate. "We need to go to breakfast. I'm starving."
Narcissa looked at her son, drawing her delicate eyebrows in with worry. "Are you sure you want to go back there?" she asks softly and stops petting his hair. "I know it holds a lot of bad memories for this family."
"Okay, Molly," Harry said slowly and feeling a bit weird for calling an adult by their first name but he dismissed the feeling. He walked around to the kitchen cabinets and grabbed a glass cup from the middle shelf. He was about to fill the glass up with water but as soon as he looked back into the glass, it had water already in it. "Thanks." He gave Molly a fake smile and hoped she'd buy it. The Weasleys were all so nice and all he does is waste their space and time. He is a waste of space here. Just another burden...
"Yes, actually," Draco said. He wouldn't deny it to his own mother. "I've just been too caught up in schooling and...his task that I really didn't have any time for relationships of the sort. I've thought about it, but I just didn't have the time."
"What happened?" Draco had to ask. He has never heard of this story before. It seems he still doesn't know his cousin much. He swore if this muggle girl did something to his cousin like breaking her heart...
Lucius wiped away the tears, got up from his chair and walked over to the Pensieve. "Thank you, Narcissa," he said softly and felt daft to even cry at all. "I don't know what I would do without you."
Draco smiled goofily at Harry. When his raven cawed into his ear, he swiftly turned his head to glare ignorantly at it. How dare the crow disturb him! The crow just cawed again. Draco grunted and pointed his wand at the bird. With a sharp wand jab and the spell
Harry smiled sadly at the thought of actually telling Draco what he goes through, which he won't ever. He doesn't want people finding out. Then he began wondering if they like the presents he gave them. "What did you two get?"
Harry said the password into the Gryffindor common room, and they entered in. This wasn't Draco's first time in Gryffindor Tower with Harry, and he is glad it won't be his last. He's snuck into Gryffindor Tower loads of times whenever he wants cuddles with his Harry or to do more voluptuous stuff with him, and Harry's snuck down into the Slytherin common room thousands of times as well.
"Hello, Harry," Seamus said with a small smile. He wondered if Harry had forgotten what he saw at the Quidditch World cup where he and Dean were holding hands. He wouldn't mind, of course. He doesn't even care if Harry finds out about Dean and his big secret.
"Girlfriend?" Blaise asked with a strike of confusion, and he shook his head. "Draco doesn't even have a girlfriend. He's not even into girls from what I've heard." Harry felt this sudden feeling of hope. His disliking to Ivy vanished, and he felt a little better hearing about this.
Next came a punch to the face, and then a kick to Harry's stomach, and Harry wheezed in oxygen from his lungs while spitting out blood from his mouth. It wasn't a good mixture. Finally, the belt hit Harry hard against his neck, causing a red bruise to form where the belt hit, and Harry hissed in pain but took it all in. He was waiting for more but more didn't come. He just wanted to shout at his Uncle to keep going, to make him suffer even more but he didn't have the ability to say it.
Malfoy felt the similar electric shock as Harry had just touched his hand but ignored it also. He furrowed his eyebrows, confused as to why Potter was apologizing. "What are you sorry for, Potter?" He forgot they were still shaking hands. It's just the warmth from the other bloke's hand made him feel as if he was at home, and he loved it. He didn't want it to end.
"I guess I did deserve it," Draco said and lowered his gaze a little, so he was looking at Harry's lips. Merlin... He ought to stop doing that. Then he corrected himself with a little head tilt. "To some extent."
"You are welcome and wow that was hot," Fred answered truthfully with a soft smile. He rose his arm up and pressed the back of his hand against his mouth.
George rose an eyebrow at him and said, "You know... That awfully sounds a lot like Draco Malfoy." He leaned a little closer, "There something you're not telling us?" Then he frowned at the word he used. The 'us' just made him remember Fred.
After that nice workout in the park, and an unusual meeting with Draco, Harry decided to head to Diagon Alley for a few minutes. He wanted to see how George was doing, with the shop and how he's dealing with the grief.
The professor just nodded at his student and got back to reading without saying a word. He trusts them to not misbehave or use the wrong type of spells in his classroom.
Draco looked into Harry's green eyes and smiled. It was one of those smiles that lit Harry up with fireworks from the inside. "Well, see my cousin over here wanted to sit with her new friend," he said to his boyfriend but pointing a finger to Ivy who was sitting next to Lavender. "She dragged me over here. I don't mind though. But I was getting a few stares from your Gryffindorks."
"For checking on me," said Harry a little sadly. He wished Hermione and Ron came to check up on him, but they didn't. He knew they couldn't, but best friends were supposed to be there for each other, right? "Only Cedric and Professor McGonagall have come to visit me."
Harry nodded, that was a good time of day to go out. And Draco Malfoy knowing muggle restaurants? That's new to hear.
Draco gave a little nod, understanding her disappointment in him. He didn't care though. He left her be and headed up to the 4th year boy's dormitory. Blaise was now getting his items ready for class, but Draco was very happy to let Blaise have his peace. He walked up to him, tapped him on the shoulder and when Blaise turned to him, he gave him a big hug. "Harry kissed me," he said in a whisper and smiled again. Merlin, his cheeks are starting to hurt now from all this smiling.
Harry looked up at Draco as he heard him say his name. He wanted to know what Draco was saying and why his name was included in the conversation. Were they talking about something important that involves him? Then he noticed he liked how Draco was speaking a different language because it was kind of hot.
"Hello, Harry," Hermione said cheerfully, smiling at her best friend who she literally saw talk to Draco Malfoy out of all the other people in Hogwarts. "How are you? And what was Malfoy doing with you?"
"I wouldn't mind at all," Pansy stated with a shrug. "In fact, I would have yelled at you to say yes and to drop me immediately. It was sweet of you to think of me first, but you should have gone with Harry. You love him, so it will make more sense if you go with him."
Harry walked over to George and sat on his bed. He placed a hand on his shoulder and sighed. "I know you miss him, George," he started. "I understand what you're going through. I've lost so many people who I card for recently. We all have."
Harry looked around in satisfaction at the member with as of the D.A. as they tried to produce Patronuses. Half the group had already been able to at least produce a silver mist and a few had actually produced a corporeal one, Cho, Fred and George, Hermione and Ron.
Ivy hesitated and looked down at the beautiful sight before her. Lavender looking all vulnerable. It was amazing. She lowered herself down to the girl's chest and licked her nipple up and then down. Lavender moaned and reached her hands down to tug at her jeans. Ivy smiled, that only made her lick around the girl's nipple now. She moved back and pulled down Lavender's jeans until she got them off with her shoes as well. She licked her lips when seeing Lavender's light blue knickers. She crawled back up and continued where she left off. She leaned back down and started sucking on Lavender's other nipple, which earned her a moan of pleasure from the girl beneath her. She swore to the heavens, she was about to fully unclothe the most beautiful being in the galaxy.
"It has been starting to hurt a bit, stabbing, and burning pains," Harry said and let his hand fall to his side. He froze and just realized what he has said. At least he didn't admit what he does in the bathroom to numb him or what he goes through. "It's very distracting."
Harry continued as he was still thinking back to Malfoy Manor, "Soft looking whitish blonde hair... I could just run my hands through it endlessly." He recalled his heart fluttering in his chest when Malfoy was so close to his face. It was almost like he could just lean in and... kiss the blonde. He could even see the slight light blue in the Slytherin's eyes, and he knew the blue had to be from Narcissa Malfoy.
"Bye!" Draco said with a slight blush, petting Harry under the chin and quickly walked off. Merlin, that was a little embarrassing. He couldn't even work up the courage to ask him out! How pathetic!
Ron sat on his bed and watched as his best mate began putting his clothes away. He has noticed something in Harry's demeanour though. He isn't dumb. "Mate... are you alright?" he asked softly.
Feeling his nervous butterflies in his stomach, Draco walked up to Harry dancing with Granger. As soon as he was a meter apart from them, he cleared his throat and thankfully heard the weird song die down. "Harry, I'm stealing you for another dance."
Well, he wouldn't know how to react to that. Angry? Oh, yeah, for sure! He would not let Malfoy ruin their friendship if that is what Malfoy was going to try to do. He made an oath to watch the Slytherins carefully to make sure they are not up to anything off like love potions that would make everyone delusional so they can take over the school. Whoa! Okay, he knew he was going a bit far, but you got to keep your eyes on your surroundings, right? What was that word that creep of a professor used? Continuous vengeance? No... Constant vengeance? Yeah, that sounds about right... But the last word wasn't right. He knew that... Constant... Constant... Constant vigilance! Yes! Constant Vigilance!
As Harry was out flying the Dragon from who knows where Draco began to remember back when he first got to meet Harry. When he first met him in Madam Malkin's Robe shop, he remembered that his heartbeat was beating faster than ever. That day, he actually thought that he was having a panic attack, but now he knows what that feeling is. Draco smiled to himself, feeling that familiar beat of his heart quicken as he was thinking about Harry Potter. Even then, he didn't know he was actually meeting Harry Potter. But he always used his Malfoy Mask to hide his true emotions, because according to his father 'Malfoys don't show their emotions'. Draco blames it on his father and how he wants the Malfoys to be these perfect pureblooded wizards.
It had been exactly a year of being together with Draco and Harry felt the sudden need for more than kisses and hugs. One night as he was at Malfoy Manor, he lured Draco into his room using rose petals. He sat naked on Draco's 4-poster bed with a forest green quilt and pillows, waiting for his Ice prince to arrive. When he heard the door open, he bit his lip. He covered himself up with Draco's bed's blankets as Mr. Malfoy walked into the room with a bunch of rose petals.
Without consciously knowing, Draco touched Harry's hand. He could have squirmed but had the mind not to. Both boys shared a sharp intake of breath at the sudden gesture. "Sorry," he muttered, his cheeks becoming redder as he removed his hand from Harry's.
"Yay!" Ron said and pumped a fist in the air just to be a little silly. It was only for show though, his excitement. He wouldn't actually feel this hyped up about dancing with his best mate. It's just them having a little bit of fun.
Narcissa's frown grew a little. Finally, he is starting to see everything now! She nodded at him. "He never wore his mask around me, and I found out about his sexuality one time when we went shopping. I noticed he wasn't staring at all the pretty girls who walked by. He kept his eyes on the men walking the streets, they mostly resemble Harry though. Black hair and glasses. I even caught him staring at a boys' bottom who looked the same age as him." She held back a chuckle. "That is how I knew; you have to spend time with our Dragon to get to know him. He's not our little boy anymore, he's becoming a grown man. By spending time with him, he will start to warm up to you, trust you more," she said with a hint of a smile. She knew how much her Dragon loved Harry; it was just so obvious. Even by the way he writes about him in his letters to her.
Pansy screamed and backed away from the tv, hiding behind the couch Ron sat on. Draco and Blaise jumped over the back of their armchairs but peeped their heads over the edge to keep an eye on the ghost girl.
Ron nodded a little and held his right hand on the professor's waist and his left hand held the professor's hand. He really didn't like this any more than he liked dancing with his own mother. What made it worse was hearing Fred and George whistling at him. He gave both his older brothers glares but continued to dance with his professor. Bloody Hell, it was embarrassing.
Harry nodded, sat down on the gazebo seat, and started from the beginning, letting more tears run down his face. "A-as you know, V-Voldemort killed my p-parents." Draco nodded. "So, when S-Snape found me he g-gave me to Dumbledore, who gave me to my m-mother's muggle sister, P-Petunia. Aunt Petunia was always j-jealous of my m-mother, being a witch and all. Uncle V-Vernon and Aunt Petunia also had a k-kid and treated him like a king, leaving me as their s-slave."
Harry laughed and let go of one of Draco's hands, putting it on the Slytherin's shoulders. "Yeah, I noticed her too when you left and thought that the lighting must be a little too bright for you and your beautiful eyes," he said as he moved his head closer to the blonde, licking his lips as he wanted a kiss.
"I would certainly love that," said Narcissa with a polite smile back. She opened the door and stepped back to let him in. "Why don't you come inside, it's quite chilly out there." But then she paused, she never liked being called by her marital name. it made her feel old. "Oh, and please call me Narcissa."
Harry pointed to the potion that looks kind of hard but also simple to brew. Dreamless Sleeping Draught?" he asked the blonde who seemed to be staring at his face, but he didn't know where. He blinked and pressed his lips together. Draco was still staring at a spot on his face. Oh, he hoped he didn't have any sneaky pimples that came through. "Um... Draco?" His hand automatically found their way to Draco's cheeks which he caressed, and a red tinge formed on the Slytherin's cheeks.
"At least it's something other than nothing," said Pansy and she looked to her side at Ivy, who nodded in agreement. "Did you at least say anything to him like... about your feelings for him?"
"Just going for a walk," said Harry, smiling and completely ignoring Lavender Brown trying to get Ron's attention. Then he leaned down to whisper into Hermione's ear since he knows why she's been acting so strangely. "Just push that brat away and kiss him, ''Mione. It's not that hard." With a little wink at her, he turned around and left the Great Hall leaving a blushing Hermione and a confused Ron behind.
Harry frowned at the floor are really considered this for a moment. She told him about her life so it's only fair if he tells her about what he goes through. But the thing is he doesn't want to tell her. He doesn't want to tell anybody about this. It's his own problem and nobody else's. "All I'll say is that thanks to Voldemort and killing my parents my life is a complete piece of shit and sorry for my language," he mumbled, and Ivy nodded. He knows that when he's mumbling he sounds like he's speaking nonsense. "Someone, and I mean Dumbledore, thought it was wise to send me to my Aunt so she can look after me with her husband and child. Big mistake."
Ivy wrapped her arms around her cousin for a hug, when she felt as if she had enough, she stood up and walked a little towards the entrance to the hallway leading to the dormitories. "Good night, guys," she said and hesitated for a minute, staring at her best friends. With a sigh, she walked her way to the 6th year's girl's dorms.
"Harry, please get to work," Draco said and shoved Harry in the chest with his shoulder. He just wanted to get this done so he doesn't have to deal with knowing Weasel was in the same room as him again. Harry involuntarily sucked in air as a flash of pain travelled through his chest.
"Nobody can get passed Dumbledore's age line, not unless they're 17 or older," Harry said tiredly and resting his head on his knees. He was tired of having to answer the same question repeatedly, especially if it was something he didn't do.
He hurried to meet Ron and Hermione at the Three Broomsticks. He just hoped Draco and Ivy will like their presents. The only thing that troubled him was how he was going to wrap it. Hermione was the last to arrive, carrying large rectangular packages.
"I want to know why you fought Ron," Harry said in a demanding tone and glared at him, but he couldn't persuade a Slytherin like Draco to admit first and answer last. He wasn't that good in persuading.
Harry was walking through an empty corridor as he prefers them that way and he had his hood over his head to block out the rest of the world. All he wanted was a break from the rest of the world, Hermione, and Ron. They weren't being very talkish to him as much which is why he decides to isolate himself from them. It pretty much happens every day and he's fine with it. Then he hears a distant "Harry" come from somewhere around him. He pretends to ignore it and keep walking but as he does so he hears footsteps coming from behind him. Deciding that it is rude to ignore someone calling him, he turns around and faces the one and only Draco Malfoy. "Hello, Draco."
“Well, I remember leaving the Great Hall with Draco,” he said slowly, glancing over at the sleeping blond nearby. “And...and going down to Potions. We were talking about his mother, he’d gotten a letter from her…” Hermione nodded, but her expression told Harry he was still missing something. Harry thought back, and suddenly he knew. “Oh. That Ravenclaw boy who tried to curse Draco, but it hit me instead.” he said finally, and Ron nodded.
That night, Harry marveled that they had already spent around a month at Beauxbatons. He’d enjoyed every single second of it, and his new friendships, as well as getting closer with Draco and even Daphne.
“Now, that potion will take the pain down and then you have my permission to leave. You’ll get your schedule at breakfast.” Pomfrey sighed as she capped the potion bottle and cleared up. “Ms. Greengrass dropped in on you this morning after she and Mr. Potter brought you in last night.”
“Hello,” Hermione said to Andromeda, pushing back her hair. Teddy babbled and his hair began to change to the tawny brown color of Hermione’s, who smiled when she noticed.
He felt like he’d felt the night when he’d burned the Mark off of his arm; everything was in sudden clarity. How he loathed himself and hated what he’d done, been forced or threatened to do. How he’d done it, even though he knew it was wrong.
Draco frowned slightly. So many of his memories were like that. Or they weren’t truly happy, but the kind of happy he had used to delight in from bullying others, or something like that. Did he have any memories that would work for this?
Those three months had been blessedly peaceful, but Harry had stayed up in his room, thinking on many things. Grieving, for one. He felt sometimes as if he would never be able to look back on the memories of the fallen without feeling as if the Whomping Willow had socked him in the stomach. They never left his thoughts.
Twenty minutes later they were talking about tattoos, Daphne having spotted Harry’s on his shoulder, like Draco had done all those weeks ago.
“We’ll show you the way to the dorms,” called Camille, and they followed after her as she walked confidently through the blue-painted hallways. Harry was glad for the guidance, for it was starting to look all the same in his eyes. Daphne walked next to him, while Draco was a bit ahead with Simon, chatting away with him in French.
“What?” he said vaguely, looking up at Hermione and getting the impression that he’d missed something she’d said while being lost in his thoughts.
“We should go have a snowball fight.” declared Simon. “The snow’s sticking, I can see it on the cobblestones.”
“Just wanted to get away for a while,” responded Draco vaguely as they tramp up the hill back to the school. “You?”
“It’s not because of you.” Harry replied as the staircase settled into place, and they walked up the remainder of it into another hallway. “It doesn’t matter what they think, it doesn’t concern them. I care about what you think. Not them. And trust me, I’ve dealt with shit before.” he continued. “Remember second year? Fourth year?”
“Thanks.” replied Harry, still a little flushed from the attention. “How’s yours coming?” he asked, as the teacher directed the class to split up into pairs and practice the charm.
“Alright. I told Amelie she could take the bathroom, but we’ll just do yours out here.” announced Camille, unpacking various things.
before fetching a tin of homemade toffee, and the three swap grins as they remember eating it and having their teeth glued together.
“W-What?” he replied, all too aware of the quaver in his voice. Like...a date? What is this? Is this what they were hiding?
Once he’s onto Platform 9 ¾, he strode quickly to the train, giving no attention to those around him, even as they started to realize who was among them. Soon there was no one in front of him. No one wanted to be near a Malfoy. He sneered. Draco knew very well what was thought of him. He thought it himself.
“Headmistress,” piped Parvati, “So if we go on the trip we won’t be able to return for Christmas break?”
“Well obviously.” stated Draco with a roll of his eyes. “It’s snowing.” Harry snickered, then burst out laughing as Draco felt someone tackle him from the side and send him flying onto the snowy, cold ground.
“Oh- yeah.” he responded, flustered. Whenever he thought about Draco it felt like everyone could tell, like he was broadcasting his thoughts or being super obvious. He hoped that wasn't true.
All of these things were going through his head, and he hadn’t realized them until now, but they were all true. When Harry had seen Draco earlier today, in the mirror… he’d stared. He hadn’t been able to help it. Draco had looked beautiful, ethereal. And he’d stared back.
one that had housed the Resurrection Stone, not so long ago. He brushed his thumb over the engraved gold ball and remembered the small, dull black stone rising out of it. It was still hidden in the forest, somewhere, and Harry knew he could find it if he wanted. But he’d meant what he said that night, after he’d triumphed over Voldemort. He wasn’t going to go looking for it. He knew better now.
“No. I don’t really care about him being here. I’m fine.” And with that Draco stood up and left the table, Harry frowning after him.
“What you guys did didn’t look like talking to me,” muttered Blaise, and Pansy cackled. Draco smacked Blaise’s arm, which was the closest bit of him he could reach. Daphne snickered.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, but his voice sounded quavery, even to his own ears. Harry gave him a knowing look and handed him his wand. He must’ve dropped it.
“Sure, we’ll have tea,” agreed Ron, and Hagrid lead them inside. Harry’s instantly comforted by the familiar, cozy surroundings. Hagrid set down three huge mugs and a tea kettle
Eventually he gave in and swabbed roughly at his eyes, then walked back out of the Owlery. It’s a beautiful day. The morning chill has dissolved, and the sun warmed his skin as he made his way down a small path. He didn’t know where he was going, but he would rather be out here than inside. Being outside calmed him. Things are simpler out here, thought Draco. Just the sun and the wind and the plants. He found a flat, eroded stone that jutted out into the lake. When he sat, it was pleasantly heated from the sun. Draco exhaled and closed his eyes.
“Nothing.” replied Draco, schooling his features into a normal façade. Harry eyed him suspiciously before beginning a conversation with Ron. Draco caught Hermione’s inquisitive eye and sent her a quick smirk and a shrug. She shook her head slightly and returned her attention to her plate.
“You’re still fetching the ingredients for me, Potter. We need crushed unicorn horn. And please don’t drop it.” Draco said, but unlike their previous classes, his voice has no bite to it.
“Well, do tell us what this is all about.” said Pansy. Harry swallowed. Yes, he was definitely out of his depth. He wasn’t witty enough to deal with three Slytherins, let alone Pansy.
So far the day hadn’t been that bad. He’d gone to classes, both of which he’d shared with Hermione and Daphne, Ancient Runes and Charms. He’d had to endure some rude mutterings, but all in all not too bad.
“Merlin, I hate goodbyes,” he murmured, looking a little forlorn as they waved one last time to their Beauxbatons friends before following the other exchange students, and Madam Maxime, out of the dining hall. Daphne came and took hold of Draco’s other hand, so that she and Harry were on either side of the blond. Harry sighed.
“My name is Maddy, and I like chocolate,” replied a tallish blond girl. They went around the room, and all together there were around fifteen kids, all 9 years old. Amelie motioned for Harry to join her at the front of the class, which he did.
“There you are!” Daphne waved him over to their table in the dining hall, and Draco hastened to sit down next to her, and across from Harry. “Harry said you went Christmas shopping today? What did you get for everyone?” she prodded, and Draco smirked. It wasn’t hard to tell she wanted to know what he’d gotten for her.
“Alright,” replied Harry softly, letting go of his gentle grip of Draco’s arm. Draco gave him the barest hint of a smile and slipped his hand into Harry’s as they resumed walking.
“Yeah,” Harry replied casually. He swapped a look with Draco, who’s eyes were sparkling merrily at the withheld secret. “But we left the ball early.” Harry continued, noting Hermione’s keen eyes flicking between him and Draco with curiosity.
“And,” Draco went on, shaking, “I- I tortured people. I could’ve done better, done more to help, so many people died, Harry. There were bodies on the floor of my house. There were people locked in the dungeons of my house. And I had to go about like they weren’t there.”
“Merry Christmas to you, too. And thanks for the Healing book and food,” Draco replied. She’d gotten him a book on Healing spells and procedures from other countries, which had been really interesting to flip through. There had been lots of remedies he’d never heard of, and part of him was itching to try brewing them or casting them.
Harry thought back on his eighth year, revisiting all of the events that had happened to bring them together like this, looking for little clues. Now that he knew Draco had liked him, for a while, it was a little easier to look back and spot hints from the Slytherin that he’d missed. To see their too-long stares, things they’d done together, and conversations in a different light. Like carrying Draco when he’d had a broken ankle, or all of their Seeker’s games. Like stargazing in the clearing, and earlier tonight as well. Even that night at Riley’s, when Harry had first realized what he felt for Draco. It all led back to where they were now.
“Don’t tell Hermione about this,” insisted Draco, and though Harry wanted to protest he just nodded. Again, this was something to talk about later. It all tied back into the thing that Draco refused to address. Harry sighed.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Er. No reason. I’ll be right back,” he added, and went to put it in his dorm. When he stashed it beside his bed and changed out of his Quidditch robes, Draco’s bed was silent, the hangings pulled around it entirely. Harry went back to the common room and rejoined Hermione.
Harry pointed at him. “Late,” he said sternly, but a smile danced on his lips. Draco smiled ruefully.
“You didn’t see anyone, down at the pitch?” asked Harry as they walked through the doors. Harry took out his wand and locked the front doors. Probably so if the would-be killer was behind them, they couldn’t just stroll in after them.
Potter came back with the rest of the ingredients and set them on the table. A little jar started to roll and Draco yelped and lunged for it.
Camille seized their hands and dragged them over next to the dessert table, which Draco eyed hopefully.
He could hear the water running in the bathroom, and sat up slowly. Last night… last night felt like a fever dream. So much had happened, his mind was spinning trying to grasp it all. Not to mention his talk with Harry when Draco’d returned from the town. Something had shifted between them, but Draco had fallen asleep before he’d had a chance to take it in and figure it out. For once he hadn’t had a nightmare, even though he’d forgotten his dose of Dreamless Sleep.
“We aren’t together anymore,” Harry replied, having anticipated the question. “We owled a bit over the summer, and we both realized that we didn’t really like each other that
“Oh, by the way,” he added, tilting his head towards the door. “Amelie’s waiting for you. Something about an all-day excursion?” Harry groaned
“What’s a video?” She blinked before laughing, and Draco scowled at her. “Don’t laugh at me, Granger.”
“Fine.” he said shortly, crossing his arms, and Harry snorted. “But how are you going to- hey!” he exclaimed, for Harry had scooped him up, bridal-style, and was beginning the walk back to the school. “Potter!”
“That’s not a bad thing,” commented Harry, but he sat back and watched Draco, his green eyes following his every motion.
“You don’t understand,” he said, and Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, gently, and the other boy turned startled eyes up to meet his.
“See? I told you I’d win.” Draco bragged, smirking. He glanced over at the other boy and almost does a double take. Potter’s hair is brilliantly windswept and he’s grinning at Draco, and he looked gorgeous.
Draco murmured agreement, and McGonagall dismissed him. He walked out of her office in a daze, and didn’t bother going to go grab his school bag. Instead he discreetly leaves the castle and wandered the grounds again, eventually finding himself at the same clearing as before. It’s bright and warmed from the sunlight that poured into the clearing, and he stumbled before sitting down.
Harry looks back at Ron, who raised an eyebrow and tilts his head towards their normal desk, where they sit near Ernie and Terry. Harry nods, casting one more glance at Malfoy, who’s sitting by himself, head bent over a book. Part of him wants to damn it all and go take the vacant seat next to the Slytherin, but his feet are already following Ron to their normal desk as class begins.
“Hurry up, I’m dying over here!” yelled Daphne as she dove away from another snowball, and with a sigh and a glance at the starry heavens Draco ran to go help her.
“Alright, you should be done or close to it by now. Final test, go ahead and smell it, then cork a phial for each person and bring it up to my desk. Once you do you’re free to go.” instructed Professor Athme, and Draco inwardly groaned.
“Well legally I have to, you never took your test.” pointed out Draco with a smirk. Harry chuckled but gripped Draco’s hand firmly, their fingers curling around each other. Draco exhaled before turning on the spot and Apparating, dragging Harry with him into the compressive tunnel, the darkness, the uncomfortable sensations, until they rematerialized in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.
“I watched last week’s match,” he said, shaking his head. Harry lifted an eyebrow. He hadn’t been going to the school Quidditch games, instead using that time to spend alone with Draco, since most of the school was out on the pitch.
“Watch it, Potty.” Draco replied with a huff, but his lips were curving into a small smile. Harry grinned back.
“Yeah, could we?” Draco mirrored Harry and dangled his legs off of the bed, one hand moving up to swipe his blond hair to the side. Harry nodded agreement and stood, adjusting his glasses. Draco snorted. “Those glasses are hideous, you know.”
Harry nodded agreement vaguely. He can’t get the haunted look in Malfoy’s eyes out of his mind. Because it’s so similar to what he sees in another person’s face. His own.
“That’s my point.” he declared, closing his eyes again. “And no, I don’t want to open presents yet. Christmas will still be here when I wake up later.” he added. “I’m not some five year old jumping around at the crack of dawn, screaming about presents. Unlike some people.”
When they entered, Harry noticed Daphne smirking at them, and when he glanced at Draco the blond was scowling at her. Harry smiled at this.
“Welcome class. We will be having winter exams in December, so you want to make sure you’ve studied everything before then. Today we’ll continuing our work on Patronuses, or the Expecto Patronum Charm, that repels dementors. How many of you can produce a Patronus already?”
The two walked back to the common room in a comfortable silence, but it felt heavier than normal. As if both of them knew that they both had things left unsaid.
“...next class, the last class before the eighth years leave, we will be brewing Amortentia, or the most powerful love potion known to mankind. Normally it would take two months, but these batches are in their most crucial and final stage so that you will be able to complete and test your potions. Homework is to review this recipe. You all can go now, and come prepared next class.” finished Professor Athme. Harry hastily scribbled down the professor’s parting words before departing the room. As he stepped out the door, however, someone snagged his sleeve and pulled him aside.
The week passed rather quickly, in Draco’s opinion. When he’s not in classes, he’s spending time either by himself, wandering lonely parts of the school, or with Daphne, Blaise, and Pansy. He’s quickly becoming close with Daphne, and Draco admitted to himself that he’s glad she decided to befriend him.
“Draco, how may I help you? You said earlier that you had a question for me?” His professor sat behind a desk, and Draco sat across from him.
“Twenty minutes, so don’t take too long.” answered Harry, back to Draco as he sorted through his trunk. Draco made a noise of agreement before slipping into the bathroom and closing the door quietly behind him, leaning up against it and tipping his head back. I need to get myself back under control, he thought fiercely. Act normal.
“Well, he doesn’t call me Mudblood anymore. He’s apologized to us, doesn’t insult… I think some things have changed for the better.” answered Hermione. “Let’s just see what happens.”
“I’m not saying it does,” said Harry softly. “But you blame yourself for everything when that’s not at all fair to you. You aren’t Voldemort-” Draco shivered- “and you didn’t start the war. It would have started with or without you. People would have died with or without you.” Draco let out a shaky breath.
So now he and Draco were dependent on each other. Harry was doubly glad that the war was over, now, because going into those kinds of situations with someone else’s life depending on his, literally depending on his...it was different.
His thoughts were interrupted when the smoke cleared abruptantly. Professor Athme was standing in the middle of the room, wand raised, and as the haze cleared Harry felt cool, clean air wash over him and he inhaled gratefully. With another flick of her wand, the room reorganized itself and people struggle to their feet.
“Hey,” he said, looping the strap of his bag over his chair. There was already a cauldron of what Harry assumed was a not-completed brew of Amortentia, softly simmering away.
“So, good early Christmas present?” asked Harry, swinging their joined hands. Draco looked at him, a spark of amusement glimmering in his eyes. He stilled the motion of their clasped hands with a long-suffering sigh, and Harry snickered.
“Oh, good, you got him to come out.” greeted Daphne when they reached the bank of the frozen lake on the grounds. Draco peered at the ice covering the lake.
“Er. Sorry.” Harry says into the awkward silence, backing up slowly. Malfoy has also backed up, his arms coming to wrap around his middle defensively. He looked thin. His mouth was drawn in a thin line.
The mood in the Great Hall sobered a bit. That was something unexpected, thought Harry. But the idea of a memorial fit. It seemed right.
“Don’t be sorry. You’re the one who just went through two days of pain because of me. I’m sorry.” mumbled Draco, and Harry leaned into him, warming his side.
Five hours later he was in the Gryffindor common room with Hermione, Ron, and Dean, as eighth years still had access to their respective house common rooms, even though their dorms were no longer nearby. Harry was thinking about Malfoy, Hermione was reading a newspaper, and the other two boys were engaged in a loud game of wizards chess. (Hermione had scolded Ron thoroughly for swearing colorfully in front of a group of second years when Dean had taken both his rooks)
Draco conjured a knife and grasped it. His hand is shaking, trembling. The silver of the blade seemed to grow larger, until everything else blurred and Draco’s staring at the knife in his palm, taking short, shallow breaths. Do it, you coward. It would be better for everyone if your dark stain was gone from the world. A tear seeped from Draco’s eye, trailing down his cheek. His heartbeat pounded in his ears, a frantic thumping. His eyes are squeezed shut, and over and over in his mind he saw Dumbledore’s body falling off of the tower, the pained faces of those he was forced to torture, Crabbe’s terrified mask as he was consumed by the flames-
“Alright. Sorry.” he muttered, and with a last motherly smile the hospital wing matron bustled off. Harry stood up and Draco followed him out of the hospital wing.
“It’s not a bother. I’d love to, it’s rather fun to do.” Draco got the sense she was sincere, so he accepted gratefully.
“Yeah,” answered Draco, slightly breathless, but no one except him will ever know it’s from Potter and not the Seeker’s game. Another broom rose from the ground, and with his night vision still in use Draco could see Weasley with his arms wrapped around Hermione on the broomstick.
“No, actually. We’ve known each other for a while, but I only started trying to befriend him today.”
“I think I should do this myself.” explained Draco. He’d arrived at this conclusion only a moment before. Harry nodded knowledgeably. “Can I take this?” Draco held up the Marauder’s Map. Harry eyed him.
“Do that, then.” replied Draco, picking up his book again. “And go away, I have to finish this by Friday for Potions class.” Weasley raised his eyebrows and huffed but walked away, and Draco returned his attention to
When he got to the place on the path where the thestral-drawn carriages parked, he saw two empty ones left and shook the mud off of his shoes in preparation. He walked to the other side of the carriages to where the doors of the carriages were and stopped abruptly. Because of course Potter and Weasley and Granger would have to be there. Bloody wonderful.
“We wanted to watch the stars, there was a meteor shower.” lied Draco, and Harry was glad that Draco was better at it than Harry himself was. Once they said good night to Hermione and Ron, Harry and Draco tramped up the stairs to the dormitory. Harry yawned before getting into bed, and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
“Yeah, let’s go. I’ve had enough shopping for five years.” complained Harry, and Draco smirked as they stepped out into the cold, both of them shivering involuntarily as the change in temperature hit them.
Not knowing where else Malfoy would be, Harry resumes his wandering, trailing his hand along the stone wall, his fingers tracing every dip and imperfection. Some time later (Harry had foregone wearing Fabian Prewett’s gold watch that night, as he preferred to not know the time) Harry strolls into the courtyard and sits on the bench near the quietly babbling fountain, facing the memorial monument. Even in the shadowy lighting from the crescent moon half-covered by wispy clouds, Harry could still make out a few names.
He could hear someone screaming, as if from far away. Someone saying his name. But his ears were buzzing and his vision was blurring and he found that he couldn’t breath and the feeling of ice changed to a burning sensation, needles were stabbing him and pain was erupting in every cell of his body and then everything went black and Harry knew nothing more.
“I was very suspicious of you in sixth year.” explained Potter, and they both quiet a bit at the mention of that time.
“So,” the Gryffindor ventured, his eyes a bit soft at the edges as he watched Draco. “Why have you been disappearing into the grounds?” Draco turned his head away. This was almost the same topic, thought Potter didn’t know that.
“Yes, much better than last week, when two people puked on your shoes.” she teased, and Harry pulled a face.
“She knows best,” Harry assured. “I got you something.” He pulled the package out of his pocket and handed it to Draco. “I noticed you liked them, sorry you couldn’t come to Hogsmeade today.”
Harry was silent for awhile and Draco finally looked at him, surprised at the closed off look on his face.
“Oh don’t cry over me, you sap, I’m fine. Don’t get your knickers in a twist,” Draco groaned, but Hermione could hear the worry in his voice.
Draco started pacing, before whirling around and banishing a chair at the wall, seeming to be calmed slightly by the sound it made when it hit the wall. Harry flinched at the impact. Draco paused from banishing a second chair at Harry’s reaction, his wand still twirling rapidly in his hand.
Secretly Poppy had instantly thought that Albus was hoping for another double agent like Severus. She hoped that Harry would never allow such a thing to happen to his soul-mate. Poppy only had the slightest idea of what Severus had had to go through in the past and she knew it would not bode well for Draco. Poppy had had to stay in her office for a few moments longer when she overheard what had transpired between the Headmaster and Draco. She was also impressed at the level of Occlumency that Draco must have already achieved to have been able to notice Albus’s intrusion so quickly. He was frustratingly subtle when he was trying to be. Although, when taking into account who Draco’s godfather was, she wasn’t surprised he had mastered the art at such a young age. No, Albus had another think coming if he believed his carefully orchestrated way of handling Harry was going to continue. Poppy hoped Draco somehow put a stop to Harry returning to his family’s house this summer. Poppy could only imagine what he went through while with them, his low weight over the past three summers had not escaped her notice. Regardless of how many times she and Minerva implored the Headmaster to not send him back there, he always refused, stating it was of the utmost importance for him to continue returning.
“Despite everything going on, Harry still seems much happier than he was last year. Draco has to be at least slightly the reason for that.”
“Your boyfriend better win me my gold,” He whispered so quietly Draco barely caught the words. Draco did roll his eyes this time, elbowing Theo hard in the ribs. Draco still couldn’t contain the smirk Theo’s words elicited. Damned straight his boyfriend was going to win.
“I’m fucking starved,” Draco agreed, bumping Theo’s shoulder as they made their way up to the Great Hall.
Draco did yell out this time as he felt what must have been a Cruciatus hit Harry. So much more powerful than what the Beauxbatons boy had managed.
Thank you all for the amazing support. Let me know what your thoughts are and any questions moving forward. I love hearing what you're thinking!! Have a wonderful weekend, see you in a few days!
Just an FYI guys, this fic has very little angst. This is my emotional support fic during these trying times. So sometimes I will gloss over things that would otherwise be a huge plot point. There will still be things these boys are up against, but I'm not out to hurt them. Just try to keep that in mind. This chapter is a little longer than normal. I hope it will help you get through the shit show that will be tomorrow (and coming days) in America. I obviously know our American election also affects the world, so I hope everyone else is staying safe and taking care of themselves during this insanity regardless of where you live.
Harry was up as quickly as he could manage, stumbling into the common area where the twins and the girls were in various levels of consciousness.
As much as Draco did not want to go back to the Common Room right now, Draco didn’t see how he was going to get out of it. He was suspicious enough as it was; the last thing he wanted was Pansy and Theo looking into his activities more deeply.
“Harry Potter!” Dumbledore boomed and Draco wasn’t sure if the panic and dread inside of him was his or Harry’s.
Father’s brow furrowed and he glared at them harder, which Draco hadn’t thought possible. “Abominations,” Father hissed and Draco couldn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes.
Father narrowed his eyes at him, “You have an image to maintain and a family legacy to live up to. You should not be wasting time and sullying your reputation with someone you do not intend to marry. What changed there? You always swore you had no feelings for the Parkinson girl.”
Hermione frowned more deeply, but listened to him, casting a glance around the corner before darting out and catching up to a group of Ravenclaws.
It was lunch time, the end of year Feast was set to be later that day, which Draco was dreading. Harry had tried to give the Diggory’s his winnings and they had adamantly refused. Insisting that he keep it. Any talk of Cedric at all made Harry shut down. Draco had pocketed the money himself to keep Harry from stewing over it, but the two of them had talked about a few possibilities for it, late the night before.
“We’re on hols though, so we have more time to see each other. Thanks to your present we can actually organize things now too. I’ll see you tomorrow...” Harry checked the time, “Well, later today.”
“I honestly look forward to getting to know you better, cousin,” Draco said, taking a sip of his tea.
“Oh Luna! Yes of course! Everyone this is Luna Lovegood, she’s in my year and obviously Ravenclaw,” Ginny said squeezing closer to Harry to make room for Luna to sit on her other side.
“I hardly see how it matters about his testimony; the man was obviously delusional!” Fudge shouted, exasperated.
Draco pulled away, scrubbing at his face and running his fingers through his hair. “I really don’t think it would have been. They used the Cruciatus.” He took a few steps towards his bed, pulling out a fresh change of clothes. “There were three?”
Harry bit his lip, throwing his hands up in a shrug. “Hi, I’m Harry, everything about my life is insane.”
He seemed to get what he wished for because then that feeling of adrenaline and excitement from the First Task filtered through. Draco hoped whatever he was facing wasn’t too challenging. A little while later he felt small scratches at his right leg, but they weren’t overly painful. Then a few moments later red sparks went up, but Harry was still feeling that focused determination. Draco figured it must have been one of the other three. Harry didn’t seem to be running into any other obstacles as the minutes passed by. Finally, there was a change as confusion and annoyance came through. Draco was utterly flummoxed as to why Harry would be feeling that way. Harry sometimes felt that way while in Potions or Transfiguration, but in the middle of a giant maze didn’t quite make sense. Relief and excitement washed through and Draco figured whatever had been perplexing him was no longer a problem. Harry’s excitement increased and Draco hoped he was close to being done. He just wanted this was all to be over, once and for all.
“I am sure I do not know what you mean, Father,” Draco drawled back at him. Draco knew this day would not be ending well for him, what use was it trying to please him anymore?
Suddenly, there was the noise of feet clattering down the hall and the sound of the door unlocking. Draco’s stomach leapt to his throat, panic surging through him. He felt a thump against his chest and suddenly Harry was no longer standing in front of him. Draco whirled at the door as Pansy and Theo appeared.
“Let’s go find your other half,” Pansy whinged. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled his journal from his bag, quickly asking Harry to meet them in their classroom, warning him about Pansy.
Thank you again for the amazing feedback! Here's a little more interaction between Malfoy and the Trio! Lots of Harry and Draco next chapter. Also be aware, this story does have multiple points of view so you will definitely be seeing Draco's perspective eventually! I hope that's a good thing! Have a wonderful week!
Draco directed his attention to the front of the maze as Dumbledore announced the champions. Draco cheered for Diggory and feigned boredom for Harry. Harry somehow found his eyes briefly in the crowd, shooting a quick smirk his way. Draco studiously ignored the butterflies that bloomed in his stomach.  Within moments Harry disappeared into the maze and nothing but adrenaline and determination flowed through.
“Do you unbutton your shirt on purpose?” Harry finally burst, breaking the silence. Draco couldn’t stop himself from laughing at how incredibly bothered he sounded, the vulnerable feeling vanished.
“Please don’t tell anyone about us,” Harry pleaded, flying to his feet, groaning a bit and grabbing at his chest. “His parents can’t know. No one can know!”
“How big were they?” Draco asked quietly, finally seeming to be able to focus on the conversation. Harry whirled to look at him; he noticed Draco was cracking each of the knuckles on his hands with his thumbs.
Draco nodded dumbly, watching as Harry lifted his fingers to run across the outline of the moon plastered onto his chest. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, feeling overwhelming calm and a pleasant warmth fill his body. Draco felt his shoulders relax, a previously unknown tension draining from him.
“This is going to be impossible,” Draco groaned as he buttoned up his robes. “Maybe it’ll just be Severus patrolling the dungeons. He won’t give me detention.”
“I saw so many people with them at the Cup, and Ginny was talking about it, she just turned thirteen so she’s hoping to meet her soul-mate this school year. I guess compared to everything else, it’s not that far-fetched, it’s just a little crazy to me, one person who complements you perfectly.”
“I’m happy he has someone capable of keeping up with him. Someone whose got his back. Harry protects enough people. He’s going to need someone to protect him.”
Harry stood up and strode over to where he had deposited his cloak earlier. He also picked up his wand and what Draco recognized as a piece of parchment.
“Draco, what the hell happened here? I saw your father leave the alley, but you weren’t with him. There was some blood...”
Draco sneaked a peek at the clock on the wall above Harry’s head and sighed, “Unfortunately I believe I have to go soon. I’m surprised Pomfrey has given us this long. I’m sure Hermione and Weasley are already outside.”
Draco was completely outraged by Krum’s attempt, and became even further enraged with the Tournament organizers. How dare they sacrifice the eggs of these poor dragons to an asinine task? Draco felt such sympathy for the poor Chinese Fireball.
“Merry Christmas, Harry,” Draco smiled, crossing the room and twining his fingers into his hair and kissing him.
“It wasn’t about being a hero; I thought you knew me better than that.” Harry whispered the last words and Draco felt the hurt flow through.
Harry was silent until slowly the fizzles died out in his left hand, his right hand having extinguished the second they made contact with Draco’s mark, and buried his head against Draco’s neck his glasses awkwardly digging into the skin there. Draco hesitantly reached up and buried his fingers in Harry’s hair, stroking it slightly, resolutely ignoring the wetness he felt accumulating on his shoulder.
Draco shrugged, “It depends how long it takes for him to get away.” Draco peeked at the journal and saw Harry had scrawled his small moon character, but nothing more. “He should be here soon.”
“You’re in the Hospital Wing, obviously. Fucking scared me for a minute there,” Draco mused. Harry could feel him carding his fingers through his hair. It felt quite nice.
Draco sniffed, settling down on the ground with Harry, laying his head in Harry’s lap. “You should have said something earlier, I missed that awful article she published about you with how sick I was before the First Task. No, there was word in the Common Room that she was about to publish a piece against Hagrid, outing him as a half-giant among other things, so I had to pull a couple strings to get it stopped.”
“Oh, so their well-being is more important than Harry’s? Makes perfect sense. From that response, you
This was going to a place Draco definitely didn’t want to tread, “From what you’ve told me about them, they definitely don’t make a solid case for muggles.”
The meal flew by in a whirl of Draco mindlessly chewing his food and trying to sneak looks at Harry whenever possible. Before he knew it, the tables were being moved backward and the Champions were being told to lead the Ball in the first dance. Draco smirked at the feelings of utter terror filtering through the bond, Harry hadn’t been this freaked out by the damn Horntail, but dancing was an entirely different horror apparently.
Harry decided Hermione really was a quite amazing person, and she didn’t get nearly enough credit for it.
“Harry, where did you get to?! We were freaking out!” Ron asked, tugging Harry off the main path and towards where Hermione was standing. “We got separated from Ginny and the twins; we’re trying to find them.” Ron cut through the woods, tugging Hermione and himself forward.
It seemed Fudge was at his limit, he pulled a bag from his pocket and tossed it at the foot of Harry’s bed through the gap in the curtains Draco had left, narrowly missing Sirius. “Potter’s winnings, I have business to attend to, please excuse me.”
He heard Malfoy calling after him, and indignation filtering through the bond, but he threw the cloak over himself and hurried back towards Gryffindor tower. A permanent smile plastered on his face.
I know many of you hoped Cedric would live, and I really really wish I could have kept him alive. Unfortunately, Cedric's death really signaled the beginning of the loss of innocence for these characters. The seriousness of this War. I figured yall would rather I keep Cedric's death the same, and not have to kill of someone else closer to our characters to have the same effect. Also we're beginning to stray from canon, but we arent quite far enough to have a plausible reason for Cedric not to die other than my personal preference.
“Favouritism will only take you so far,” Harry teased. “McGonagall wouldn’t hesitate to give me detention for a month, and take points.”
“I’ve had an allergic reaction,” Harry said not at all convincingly. Fred and George laughed and rolled their eyes.
“Probably,” Harry agreed, slowly getting to his feet. He pulled on the sweatshirt he had been wearing for the journey down to the Shrieking Shack.
Draco and his father were at a table and Hermione swore she could feel the atmosphere change around them with the rage tumbling off of Lucius. Draco, on the other hand, simply looked bored. The three of them found a table and Hermione went up to the bar to order, giving the happy couple a few moments alone. She also definitely wanted to eavesdrop on Draco’s meeting.
“I wish fifteen was more exciting. It’s like eleven you get your own wand, thirteen you may get a soul-mate, then nothing until seventeen,” Blaise pouted and Draco kept himself from disagreeing. He had some major plans for turning fifteen. He just hoped everyone forgot about this particular Pureblood tradition.
Harry screamed the words at him, and Draco felt the pure unadulterated anger and rage flowing through the bond. This is what Harry must have been mad about the day before.
“That’s obviously not ideal, but I’d rather you get lessons from two competent wizards and be able to defend yourself. I think spending time with the two of them will do you good too. Also, I imagine I haven’t been helping with the anger. I’ve been pretty mad about things too. I’m sure it’s bleeding off on you.”
“Not sure what you’re talking about, my neck is a bit sore, I think I got all wrapped up in the blanket last night. Look I’m starving. Let’s go get food.”
Draco tried not to think about that too much. Lucius had made his decisions and he would have to deal with the fallout.
A few minutes later a splash was heard, and everyone cheered as Cedric and Cho surfaced about 100 feet from shore. Cho was looking incredibly disoriented as Cedric pulled the two of them back to shore.
“Harry what are you doing, keep – “Ron cut himself short as he took in the scene between Harry and Malfoy. “What are you on about, Malfoy? Get your hands off of him!”
Pomfrey slid behind the curtains around Harry’s bed and informed his guests that they had to leave. Within a few moments Weasley and Hermione ducked out into the Ward.
Draco focused on their bond and realized that within a few moments he did indeed feel a peculiar cold feeling encasing his arm. “Er, yeah, I can feel it. It’s not like I’m personally cold though, it’s hard to explain. It’s not very comfortable, at any rate.”
Draco looked up at the two of them before his eyes glued to Harry, “I’m okay.” His voice barely carrying to where she stood. He had successfully cleaned most of the blood off of his face, but his cheek was an angry red. It was already swelling badly despite Hermione’s makeshift ice pack.
"He's asleep, get your harassment out now because I won't tolerate it once he wakes up," Draco said looking towards the Weasleys. They all stared at him before Ginny, of all people, finally found her voice.
Malfoy cut him off by placing his palm flat against Harry's mark. An explosion of warmth and calm flooded his chest and Harry immediately raised his hand and did the same to Malfoy. Malfoy inhaled again, but all Harry could feel was the intense, but not uncomfortable warmth filling his body. They stood like that for a few moments before Malfoy turned away with a deep sigh.
Draco set his face down onto his and Harry’s clasped hands, and before he knew it, he also drifted off to sleep.
"Er, Harry, you're looking loads better," Weasley attempted and Draco couldn't keep a snort from escaping him.
“I have said that,” Hermione confirmed automatically. She cast a glance towards the door. It was obvious she was beginning to overstay her welcome. Her and Draco’s relationship had grown leaps and bounds since she had become aware of his and Harry’s bond, but she knew he would grow closed off if she hung around too long. According to Harry he wasn’t used to showing feelings in front of people.
Draco rolled the eye that wasn’t covered by the ice pack and flapped a hand at her, “I promise I’ll be fine. I have potion I can take in my lab should the need arise. I’m just tired. My cheek will bruise and I’ll have a wicked black eye. Feel free to tell everyone it was Lucius. I can’t wait until Severus finds out.”
Draco did not go and sit next to Harry as he would have preferred, instead plopping down onto the bench next to Theo, barely able to keep his excitement inside himself.
Draco knew Severus would have preferred he did, he loathed when people used injury for pity and attention.
“No. I’m not leaving you. Sorry. I do not care if I have to live with the Muggles, I absolutely will not allow Harry to go back there alone. I frankly think it is absolute bollocks he has to go back at all, but if you insist upon it, I am going with.”
Assuredly, none of the whispers around them were about anything than the kiss that had just happened.
Harry irritably shook his hair out of his eyes, “I mean at the end yeah, but it was this like all over my body intense pain thing before that.”
“Not sure that would help anything at the moment. I wouldn’t say no to some ice for my face if it could be managed.”
"Potions done," He quietly got to his feet and carefully scooped the potion into a few jars. He corked all but one; Harry had gotten to his feet and shadowed him across the room.
Draco would never admit to anyone here at Hogwarts that he had always desperately wanted a pet dragon. He had begged his father for one of course, but had obviously never been given one. He had even tried to explain to his parents that they had plenty of space at the Manor for a dragon and he would train it and take care of it.
“Could only be one person, really, and it makes a bunch of things from this year make sense. Are you okay?”
“Once upon a time there was a woman I loved, and I made some stupid choices. Dumbledore decided to utilize my position close to the Dark Lord for his own gain. I would not wish this position on anyone, but most specifically my godson. The Dark Lord is smart, smarter than anyone gives him credit for. He would see through your ruse in a moment. He checks for soul-mates. It would bring the Dark Lord nothing but joy to have the opportunity to use you to harm Potter. He will make it painful and he would drag it out until Potter came for you. Do you understand what I am saying?”
“You feel your best mate’s little sister growing colder and colder on the floor of some disgusting chamber with a snake taller than a house attacking you, and no one fucking comes to save you! You get bitten by that snake and feel acid flowing through your body, feel your organs slowly, agonizingly shutting down one by one. Then you tell your best mate’s little sister to go, even if that means dying alone in the literal sewer, so she doesn’t have to watch someone just a year older than her die. No one fucking comes! A fucking bird comes before any grownups do! So, no I wasn’t leaving that little girl down there! I’d do it a-fucking-gain. I’m sorry you had to feel that, but I was not leaving her there!”
Ron’s eyes widened slightly at the scene. “Er, sorry, it’s just everyone is starting to go down to the train…”
“Wonderful, then you just need to learn to Apparate and then you can come kidnap me as much as possible,” Pansy interjected, and Draco looked at her in confusion. They always spent time with each other over the summer, but she had always been pretty happy at home.
“There’s a thin line between love and hate,” Sirius pointed out, his thoughts drifting to James and Lily.
Draco felt a tightness in his chest like when he would hold his breath until Harry dove the rest of the way beneath the water and the feeling disappeared. Draco figured he must be using his new gills. At the very least, the gillyweed had worked. Unfortunately, the icy child from the water was covering his entire body now. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was uncomfortable because his emotions were focused, but all Draco could think about was how bloody cold he was.
Harry nodded, but couldn't get the blond out of his head; the sound of him repeatedly hitting the ground echoing in his mind.
“Ugh! That’s the worst, what was he prattling on about? Some terrible creature or one of his favourite Gryffindors?” Pansy gushed, leaning towards Theo.
He felt slightly better when it was confirmed that his and Hermione’s hypothesis had been correct, Harry would have to retrieve a fake golden egg from beneath the dragon assigned to them. Draco internally groaned when he saw that Diggory has gotten the Swedish Short-Snout. He had hoped golden-boy Diggory would get the Horntail. Draco had to admit he was slightly impressed by the act of Transfiguration that Diggory completed, and cheered loudly when he was successful in retrieving his egg. It had felt sort of relieving to release some of the stress pent up inside him by screaming for the other Hogwarts champion. He had to pretend he wanted Diggory to win at any rate.
“Oh shit, wait, Professor Lupin honestly helped to create this thing? I knew he was brilliant, but this just cements it. Your godfather too.”
“Pomfrey wants me to eat dinner here and then she said I can go after that as long as I keep it down. I feel completely fine, but she insists.”
“You suffered a bond refusal illness. I have already briefly spoken to Mr. Potter about the absolute dangers of ignoring your bond. Thankfully, we caught it in time and I was able to heal you. You should steadily regain your normal strength over the course of the day. I urge the both of you to discuss your differences; I will not be able to keep the Wing sealed for too much longer. There are a number of people that have been eager to visit. I can guarantee you a few moments. At Mr. Potter’s request I have kept the knowledge of your bond to myself, as far as anyone is aware Mr. Malfoy you suffered from an untreated case of the Owl Flu. You are obviously quickly recovering after the appropriate potions.” Madam Pomfrey disappeared without another word.
I know, I know, it's been forever. I got a new job and it has been encompassing my entire life. Teaching 8th graders virtually (and in person at the same time) is an insane challenge and adventure within itself.
“What did you do to the Weasleys?” Draco asked as he sipped at his tea. The rainbow-Blaise-canary was not able to respond with words, but did squawk irritably.
“I feel like I still barely know you. I know your feelings almost as well as my own, but I don’t even know what your home is like.”
“My apologies, Draco, I forget myself sometimes. I meant no harm,” He said genially and Draco forced his features into an impassive mask.
“Oh thank fuck, he’s home,” Nott gasped as Harry dimly noticed light coming from up ahead. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m dropping you there. He’d think it was me. Sorry, but you know I’m right.”
“I mean, maybe? Probably not. Her father has always hinted, but Father wanted ‘something more’ for me. I’ve also made it quite clear to my Father that Pansy is similar to a sister to me and insinuated I wouldn’t even be able to give him an heir with her. I expect he would probably try to set me with one of the Greengrass girls. They’re Sacred 28, powerful, and therefore ideal.”
No, he would have to fit in. He wasn’t ready to be out to Weasley yet. He could say he was getting ingredients for Severus… but that was brief and would make him dismissible. He would have to be injured.
“Thanks,” Harry said a moment later, his throat and mouth no longer feeling like he had spent days in the desert without a drink.
Harry was clad in a set of bottle green robes which he had accented with an unmistakable green tie. The Slytherin logo was gone but Draco knew what the colour of the tie he wore daily was. The tie went perfectly with his robes, and Draco would never have suspected it was a Slytherin tie had he not known previously. Harry was wearing his tie to the Ball, in front of everyone to see. Draco’s tie, Draco’s Slytherin tie on the Gryffindor Golden Boy. Draco finally understood the way Harry must feel to see his love bites on Draco’s neck. Draco didn’t understand how Harry didn’t tackle him in the hallways daily with the way Draco was currently feeling.
Harry bit his lip, looking conflicted. Draco couldn't hold in a laugh, endeared by the fact that Harry knew how much he hated looking sloppy.
“Hey, stop, none of that,” Harry chastised. Draco still didn’t drop the block and Harry frowned more deeply. “Please?” He asked weakly. Harry drug his thumb across Draco’s unhurt cheek.
“Yes, sir, I understand,” Draco forced out, his mind zipping through the horrors he could have possibly faced.
“Apart? No, I’m going wherever you go. The Apparition is so that we can get the fuck away from your family as much as possible. I’m not going anywhere near the Manor if I can help it.”
Draco quickly got ready for bed, excited for Harry to get his gift. Not excited for the Yule Ball the following night. He knew Harry was going to look stunning and he was happy that in the end Harry had found a date in Parvati Patil. Harry had even been able to pick up enough knowledge about formal dancing from the very few lessons Draco had been able to give him in their limited time. Harry was no longer as anxious about the Ball at any rate. Draco was incredibly curious about who Hermione was going to the Ball with, she had been incredibly tight-lipped about it whenever she had joined Draco and Harry in their late-night meet-ups, and Harry had told Draco that she refused to even give a hint of who it could be.
Draco’s face ached. He looked into the mirror he had just summoned. His eye had darkened overnight, as he thought it would. Draco vanished the mirror and braced himself for the onslaught today would bring. He was doing this. He wasn’t hiding it anymore. He was going to shatter the illusion over the Malfoys’ perfect façade.
“Brilliant, good bye Harry and Hermione,” Luna said pleasantly, getting to her feet and letting Ginny pull her from the Hall, their hands still gripped together.
“Do you have any idea how much I love you? You’re the absolute best mate a person could hope for,” Draco praised as they left.
“I really don’t think Ginny still has her crush on me, but I won’t ask her. It’ll probably end up with Ron and I going alone, and me grabbing the first girl I see and opening the dance with them. Why does it have to be a girl anyways? Why shouldn’t I be allowed to bring a man?”
"Come on, you're falling asleep standing up," Draco put his arm underneath Harry's again and carefully opened the door back into the ward.
Hermione barely stopped Neville from putting butterfly wings instead of moth’s wings into their potion. Unfortunately in front of them, Ron made the same mistake. His and Harry’s potion crackled violently, like tossing water onto boiling oil and Snape swooped in.
“If I’m being completely honest, it was how not obsessed with Potter you were this year that tipped it over. Outside of Potions, you two have barely been at each other’s throats. But don’t worry no one else suspects, that I know of anyways.”
“You got premature majority, didn’t you?” Longbottom asked, and everyone turned to look at him in shock. He shrugged, looking self-conscious, “Gran’s told me about it about a million times. She hates having to take care of the family responsibilities.”
“I’ll give you it back at the dorm,” He muttered. Draco could barely hear him over the explosion from the Hufflepuffs. Draco hadn’t realized how much tension he had been holding, worried that Theo had been right.
“What changed?” Harry asked and Draco would have thought he was fishing for compliments if it were anyone but Harry.
Draco smiled weakly, “Not sure that would help anything at the moment. I wouldn’t say no to some ice for my face if it could be managed.”
a bit to get used to Draco and I was bonded to him! I could only imagine what it would be like for you. Hermione found out when we were fighting or I may have just told the both of you. I don’t know. We both made some shitty decisions this year, but I truly think you and Draco will get along eventually. You just have to give him a chance. But we aren’t talking about me right now. Congratulations you two! Hurts like a bitch at first!” Harry forced a smile at his two best mates, and then a thought struck him and he legitimately starting laughing.
“It’s the only thing my brain can comprehend right now, because the idea of a 12-year-old just accepting the fact that he was going to die alone in the dungeons of his school isn’t getting through currently. I know you’re furious with me, and I deserve it, but can I hug you, please?”
Draco took a few deep breaths, and wiped his face with Hermione’s scarf. The bleeding from his cheek had stopped, her scarf stained with his blood. Draco noted what the scarf looked like so he could purchase her a new one before hauling himself to his feet. Draco pulled his wand and cleaned his clothes. He strode down the alley before ducking back into the Three Broomsticks, heading straight to the loo. Draco spelled the door shut, finding the room blessedly empty.
“I still can’t believe that Krum got the Snitch,” Dean sighed, absently rubbing his hand up and down Seamus’ arm.
“Ten galleons it’s Potter,” Theo said and Draco’s smile dropped from his face. He hadn’t even considered that, but no, Harry wouldn’t do that.
Draco was staring at him with pride and something else in his gaze, “I guess I’m just your lucky charm.”
“The Malfoys are a Pureblood family. There are old laws; from when we didn’t live as long, that allowed majority at the age of 15 should the wizard fit certain criteria. Principally, they would have had to have found their soul-mate, and been able to pass a worthiness test set forth by the magical artifact of choice for the family,” William piped up. Draco was impressed that he had known what he had been talking about.
Malfoy recoiled like he had been burned. He briefly met eyes with Harry before quickly whipping around and hurrying through the crowd to catch up to the platinum blond heads of his parents, who no one seemed to be getting within 2 meters of despite the large amount of people trying to leave the stadium.
“Sure, now that Potter is winning, Weasel comes crawling back,” Draco couldn’t keep himself from commenting.
Draco sighed and dragged Harry over to the couch, pulling him against his chest as they cuddled. “I haven’t told you for a reason. I like what we have. It’s not a loss. Cursing Muggleborns was so fucking stupid, it’s so juvenile. There’s no point spending time with people who I no longer share the same ideals with. I still get to see Pansy and Theo loads, I just don’t have to fake niceties with people I dislike. The only thing I hate is that people think I’m with Pansy. I can barely stand the charade we put on. It makes me feel gross. I feel like I’m cheating on you.”
Draco was sitting in the library studying with Pansy and Theo, racking his brain. Vince and Greg were sitting at the same table but they were definitely not studying. They were flicking balled up pieces of parchment at each other. Draco just could not remember what would help Harry breathe underwater. There was something tickling at the back of his brain, but it just wouldn’t come to him. He had been fruitlessly trying to figure it out the past few weeks and time was getting low to figure it out. The Task was just a few weeks away. Draco sighed heavily and got to his feet.
Harry pulled a small, smooth rock from the ground and threw it into the lake. “Defense just wasn’t my favourite class today, that’s all.”
Harry felt badly for how upset Ginny sounded, but also found it presumptuous that this girl would come over demanding presents. Luna did not seem affected by Ginny’s words at all.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Yes, I’m aware of that now! I was mad at him! He called you that name, and I didn’t want to talk to him.”
They made it to the Owlery in record time and Draco pulled out a piece of parchment, quickly scribing a note to the store in Knockturn Alley that would be able to get him what he needed.
“Does that hurt?” He asked, worry filling him, curse scars were always so finicky and hard to predict.
Draco was getting really annoyed with the impressive magical feats his soul-mate could perform, one was going to get a complex if this continued.
"I'll be fine, I promise. They’ll be healed. Look, you can check once I take the potion. Trust me.” He still hadn’t moved a centimetre from when Harry had begun touching his soul-mark.  “To answer your question, yes, soul bonds are seriously intense and powerful magic. There’s no ignoring it once the bond has been sealed. It's why I couldn’t bear to watch you get cursed today and feared for you at the Cup. Things are only going to get more intense."
“Are you so used to that? You can’t tell me all of your friends are only ever trying to get things to hold against you.” Harry asked, in disbelief.
“I’m actually going to go meet up with Viktor, so you’re on your own,” Hermione said, packing up the scrolls of parchment she had laid out to take notes on what they figured out. She grabbed Draco’s Ancient Runes essay as she cleaned up and he grabbed hers, “I’ll swap the two of them tomorrow in class.”
Draco took mercy on him, crossing to him and hesitantly grabbing his hand, a tender smile on his face. “Harry, are you a seeker or not?”
He quickly made his way upstairs and into his dorm. Thankfully none of his other dormmates had turned in yet. Harry rooted in his trunk for his cloak and the map before charming his curtains shut and throwing the cloak over him.
“I appreciate that, Malfoy, and I accept your apology. As long as you continue treating Harry well, you can consider our previous transgressions as water under the bridge. I know the universe wouldn’t have made the two of you soul-mates if you were only made up of the parts of yourself that I have interacted with previously, and please call me Hermione.” She reached out her hand and Draco shook it immediately, a dazed look on his face.
Harry sighed at the reminder, their laughter echoed down the stairwell as they retreated back to their room two floors up. Harry went back into his dormitory, hoping Ron had gone downstairs. Thankfully he had, Harry grabbed his journal and noticed it was warm to the touch.
Draco had been searching and racking his brain for a solution to his problems. He had known there was no way he could return to the Manor this summer; he knew Mother would not be able to keep him safe from Lucius for long. He also knew he wouldn’t be able to bare being away from Harry that long. He had searched every ancient Pureblood text he could get his hands on the past few months, completely in secret. He hadn’t wanted to worry Harry with how much he already had on his plate, and couldn’t bare his disappointment should Draco fail.
“Just fancied a walk,” Harry said dubiously after he swallowed his bite, “How was Padma? It seemed like you had a fun night.”
“Potter has been abducted; our worst fears are realized.” He said to Dumbledore, whose eyes only briefly flashed to Draco.
“Something tells me your father would be bothered by quite a few things going on here,” Harry sighed. “Thank you.”
Once again I will thank you all for the out-of-this-world response. It's absolutely insane that we broke 500 kudos. I never in a million years thought I'd get this kind of reaction. It really makes my day. I worked from 7am until 730pm today and I actually looked forward to getting home and posting this chapter. Yall are the best.
Around him, he felt his familial lines rise up like a golden spider web, ensconcing the world around him in darkness. He felt the wards of the Manor like physical strings of gold, spreading out around him. He could see his Mother’s magic like a beam of light, the floor below him.
Maybe everything would be okay, Harry was only 14, and they couldn’t expect him to compete against 7th years. Students who were of legal age and able to consent to a tournament like this, Harry was too young.
Hermione smiled at Draco’s apology, and Harry felt butterflies in his stomach at the sight of his best mate accepting his soul-mate. Harry hadn’t realized how much the approval of his friends had been weighing on him.
“I mean, I’d assume his mother was the one with giant in her blood. Doesn’t quite work the other way around.” Draco trailed off and Harry’s eyes bulged with that line of thought.
“Yes, so I guess they’re taking something from you. If you don’t get it back in time, you lose it,” Draco shrugged it all seemed pretty straight forward to him.
“Are we seriously going to be staring at the water?” The stands all faced the water but nothing would there to project what was happening like at the World Cup. “This is such a fucking joke.”
Harry felt the inferno in his chest increase in intensity with what must be Draco’s pain filtering through their bond as he became conscious. Draco’s face contorted in agony, and Pomfrey forced his mouth open, pouring a potion down his throat. Draco eye’s still had not opened, but he bit down on his lip so hard Harry was sure he was in danger of biting through it. Draco’s head flew to the side and he let out a wail of pain. Harry wondered what he did in a past life to deserve having to listen to Draco scream like this.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. His eyes caught on something caught between his trunk and his bed, still wiggling slightly like it was trying to join the rest of Harry’s belongings in his trunk. Harry bent down and grabbed onto a small bottle cap, a smile coming to his face.
“Draco you have to understand the danger you are in being bonded to Potter. Who knows about the two of you?
“What do I need to do to show you how sorry I am? I had to do what I did, but I feel awful for it. If Pomfrey made you stay, you don’t have to now. I won’t force you to stay here and listen to me, to touch me,” Draco said, resignation in his voice.
Draco set the two objects down on the desk and made himself comfortable in Lucius’ chair. If he was going to take on the Head of House duties, he might as well act the part. He plucked a hair from his head, and pulled the vial with Harry’s hair from his robes. He twirled the two pieces together, thankful for the length of each of their hair. This would have been much more difficult if they had shaved heads.
Harry sighed, resuming the tracing of the moon, “Might as well get that over with, you may want to let go of my hair though.”
Draco finally made it back to his room. He pocketed the Cloak and grabbed a few different things from his room before stepping back to the fireplace and throwing in Floo powder.
“That’s it, we’re taking you to the Hospital Wing, you look like death. You’re fucking scaring us, Draco,” Pansy said and Draco felt worry pierce through the bond. He looked up blearily and witnessed Harry and Granger at the end of the hallway, staring at him. Harry had a look of utter surprise on his face.
Draco focused back onto his potion, trying to fix what his neglect had caused, shoving down the vulnerability he was feeling.
“It’s just past eleven,” She whispered, her voice barely carrying to him. Draco didn’t try to think too hard about how exactly she knew what he had wanted to ask. Hermione was curled in a ball on the bed next to them, but she was wearing a different set of robes then she had been wearing yesterday. Weasley was snoring softly from Harry’s other side. His head tipped backwards; arms crossed. The twins were sprawled spread-eagle in the aisle between the rows of cots, as if it were the most comfortable place to sleep on the planet.
Suddenly, Draco had had enough, “Answer me this, if you would, Father. Why do you expect me to be a leader of my peers, but then want me to follow and be a part of your little ‘club’,” Draco asked using his fingers to make air quotes.
Harry thought back to what Charlie had said, memories of the flames and the multiple dragon handlers trying to keep them under control. “No, he didn’t. Now you mention it, he definitely said he thought we had to just get past them. Then he said was that they were nesting mothers, and there was one for each of us. They were all different types.”
love to have that discussion over various refreshments. Completely safe, untainted, refreshments,” The other twin agreed.
Draco let out a relieved sigh and nodded his head. Harry unfisted his hand and spread his fingers across Draco’s mark, he felt Draco’s heart beat pick up. Harry bit his lip, but reached into his pocket and threw on the Invisibility Cloak. He carefully ran his thumb across Draco’s cheek bone, watching Draco’s eyes flutter shut and a quiet sigh fall through his lips, before he turned away and made his way to the doors of the Wing.
“You’d better, you sap,” Draco commented fondly. Grabbing Hermione’s essay so that he could correct it before he went back to his Common Room.
Harry waved him off, “No, don’t worry about it. I’m sure Pomfrey will let me out. Maybe we could meet tonight though?”
Draco couldn’t quell his curiosity any longer; he got up and walked to Harry, looking down at the parchment. “Harry, what the fuck?”
“I’m trying to determine how long Dumbledore is going to require you to stay at the Dursleys. I still want to try to convince him not to make you return, but I’m not holding my breath.”
Gillyweed. That is what he was trying to remember. It was an expensive magical plant that would allow the person who ate it to breathe underwater for well over an hour. This was exactly what he needed. Severus had taught him about it the summer before last. He was sure Severus would have some in his stores but would definitely know if Draco pilfered any. Draco would have to order some. Draco set the book on the shelf and made his way back to the table.
Dumbledore delegated a few more tasks that Draco ignored, busying himself instead with undoing a couple of his buttons after he caught Harry sneaking glances every few seconds. Harry looked down at the bedspread guiltily before reaching up to touch Draco’s chest quickly.
Sudden gasps and screams made Harry turn around; Moody was behind them, his wand pointed at a snow white ferret. He was using his wand to levitate and slam the poor animal repeatedly against the ground.
Hermione was reeling. This wasn’t the first time? Draco was talking like what had happened had been almost common-place.
“Obviously you do not agree with his and Harry's relationship, but it happened. I have never seen Harry act the way he does when he is around Draco, and that was after only just a few minutes of observation I am sorry you are feeling the way that you are but if you want to keep Harry in our lives then you may as well get over those feelings. Draco is here to stay. A lot of terrible things happened today and our world is changing. One thing that isn't is the bond Harry and Draco have. It's evident Hermione knew about their relationship and seems to be fine with Draco. If she can forgive him, so can all of you."
Harry brought the potion to his lips and quickly swallowed it with a grimace before laying back against the pillows, his grip still ironclad on Draco's hand. Within moments his breathing had evened out and Draco sensed the muted feelings of when Harry was under Dreamless Sleep flowing through the bond.
For the first time Draco felt real hatred for the Dark Lord. How could anyone do that to a baby? What kind of person would stand behind someone who would?
“I’d honestly rather be by myself, Ron want to play chess later?” Harry asked, hoping that would be enough for them to let him leave.
"Merlin, Potter, calm down!" Malfoy hurried to him touching his arm hesitantly. "Do you always do this?"
“Do you think you would have married Pansy? If you never found your soul-mate, that is.” Harry asked.
Draco heard the door click open and he stifled a grin. It had almost become a ritual between the two of them. Draco would go to his lab to brew potions and before long Harry would appear.
“Fancy a butterbeer after? It’s so cold out,” Ginny asked as they continued wandering through the aisles.
“Draco our entire world is about to turn upside down. It is clear you have picked your side. You must be ready for the challenges that come with it. It will not be easy. You know where your father’s loyalty lies.”
Theo finally breathed a sigh of relief as he fell in step with a crowd of 6th years and made his way into the Common Room. He looked around as quickly as he could without drawing attention and spotted Draco in the corner with the other 4th years. He seemed distracted but not overly worried. He must have felt at least some of Potter’s attack, but it had ended so abruptly that he wasn’t quite worried as of yet. Or it might have been too far away. Of course Potter had been attacked on the exact opposite side of the castle.
Thank you times a million to everyone who helped me get this far, who has read this story, who has left wonderful words or kudos or bookmarks. We still have quite a bit of excitement left. Including Draco's birthday, the Third Task, a bonding (or two), and Harry and Draco's solution for the summer hols. Buckle in everyone, this is where it gets crazy!
Draco’s voice was soft again and he was staring at the cushion of the couch, “I’m sorry if it was excruciating for you. Yes, Lucius cast it a few times. I’ll be fine. This is not the first time he has done it. I think he might have put a little extra into it though. Although it might just be the amount of time since I was subjected to it. I didn’t go home for Christmas as I normally do.”
I will be taking no criticism on the Ron/Hermione/Pansy bond. I know a lot of you are on the hate Ron train, and that is fine, but as I have said before, this is not a Ron bashing fic. I love Ron and I swear, I promise, that he will be going through some major character growth. As stated previously, he was a bit of a jerk and very immature 4th year. Just next chapter we see a massive shift in Ron after something is made apparent to him. Just try to hang in there. Drarry is still our main pairing here. I definitely hope this decision does not turn you off from this story, but it is something I had planned from the very beginning.
“Good,” Draco muttered. He was done hiding what Lucius did to him. Everyone could know that Lucius did this. Draco was not covering for him any longer.
Draco squinted at him and Harry picked the map up again and pointed at the top, “Look, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.”
"Is this how it's always going to be?” Harry whispered.  “Seamus and Dean never said anything about how this feels." Harry hastily loosened his tie and threw it off. He felt like he was suffocating.
“Hey, let’s give them something else to talk about.” Draco whispered in his ear. Harry glanced at him quizzically. “Something bigger than this,” Draco swung their joined hands a bit.
Draco shrugged, “At least with a muggle, I can produce an heir. He wouldn’t be pleased that the Malfoy line would no longer be pure-blooded, he would definitely be pissed beyond belief, but his worst nightmare is that I’m gay. He already threatens me weekly without knowing I’ve bonded. It’s going to be a nightmare when he finds out eventually.”
“I always thought they hated me because of the colour of my skin, and that’s definitely a contributing factor. The names they used to call me...” Harry trailed off for a moment and Draco only stared at him in shock. “My aunt is the only living blood relative I have left. Dumbledore put me there because apparently something my mother did when she died makes me safe as long as I stay with her blood relative. Honestly I’d rather take my chances anywhere else. It almost seems pointless to me. I spend a month with them and then go to the Weasley’s. What’s the point? It’s never made sense at all. Dumbledore once said it was because I had to keep calling their house home, but I don’t. Hogwarts is my home, has been since first year.
