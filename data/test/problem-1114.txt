‘George made my drinks,’ Draco replies, and sways into Harry slightly. ‘You smell divine,’ he mumbles.
‘Do you think you can recall anything else he might have mentioned during the time of your kidnapping?’ Blaise is asking Draco. ‘Any other magic items his affiliates have in their possession or are trying to create?’
‘Will you take me to bed?’ Draco asks.
‘I apologize if we made you uncomfortable this morning,’ Draco says, breaking the silence. ‘I understand that this - our relationship - might come as a shock to you.’
She begins to launch into an animated description of
‘We all did,’ Harry frowns.
His fingers are gentle as follows the knobs of Harry’s spine down to his shoulder blades, gentle as he guides Harry’s head downwards to press their foreheads together. Harry can feel Draco’s breath on his face, coming in soft puffs, and Harry feels the air come shuddering up out of his lungs as he tries to clamp down on the sobs threatening to spill out of him.
Guy laughs. ‘Aw, Professor,’ he says. ‘It’s not like you saved all our half-blood asses by defeating magic Hitler or whatever. I figure we owe you this one.’
‘Yes,’ Harry replies, thinking of the letters on their way across the Channel, and of Blaise’s grumpy eagle-owl. ‘I’m coordinating. Delegating. Letting you bully me into eating chips and curry,’ he adds, pointing at the offending tray. ‘This is blasphemy. You know that, right? I can feel my ancestors turning in their graves.’
Harry wants to laugh. There is no extent that the DMLE would not go to, if it meant acquiring a new weapon - especially one as powerful as the Elder Wand itself.
‘Harry,’ he whispers. ‘You came.’
‘Here’s your Dittany, Potter,’ he says. ‘Please don’t give yourself an occasion to use it.’
‘Oh,’ says Draco, looking confused at the uncharacteristically emotional display.
, and she talks at a volume usually only achievable with a Sonorous. ‘It looks good, but if there’s almonds, I’m going to need to make a run for Madame Pomfrey.’
‘Alright, but in all seriousness,’ Neville says, waving his hand, ‘you make it work, actually, because you want it to work. You make it work because you’d rather have them in your life than not at all, and you both know that eventually your lives will curve back into the same place, because sometimes the universe
‘You’ve never asked me whose magical signature I used for my Anchors,’ he says. ‘And I never… I never knew how to tell you.’

shade of fuchsia, and Hermione gets absolutely plastered from the punch, and at the end of the night Ron has to carry her into the Floo.
Draco looks up sharply, all the colour draining from his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s lips twist in furtive, aborted motions, like he’s trying to figure out what to say next. ‘I know you need time,’ he forces out. ‘I know that. But you don’t know. You have no concept of the depth of my feelings when it comes to you, Harry, nor their intensity.’
The firelight is amber as it lines the planes of his face, dipping in beneath his cheeks and brushing at the lines that bracket his lips. Draco always holds himself in layers of sarcasm and biting wit, but Harry watches him as the mask comes completely off and Harry feels that same shifting of the earth beneath his feet, and gravity readjusts to the earth as it turns off its centre. And then Draco is looking at Harry like he deserves this, deserves to be looked at like he matters, and it makes Harry’s mouth go bitter and his stomach twist savagely.
He tries not to sleep. Instead, he lies in the dark and stares up at the ceiling, trying to recall the weight of Draco slumbering beside him, or the hum of his magic perfectly aligned with Harry’s Anchors.
‘Right,’ he says, with conviction. ‘When I was going through all my issues, with the alcoholism, the reckless self-endangerment, you were there for me. Unequivocally. But I wasn’t there for you, not properly, even though you were going through so many of your own hardships.’
Harry closes his eyes as his fingers clutch at the front of Draco’s robes. He is suddenly aware of the stiffness in his muscles, the cramping of his toes in his ill-fitting shoes. There are words he wants to say, promises he wishes to renew - but the exhaustion folds over him like a dark hood, and he sways, his voice dying in his throat.
‘Alright then,’ Pansy relents. ‘For Kreacher.’
Pansy sits up slowly, her eyes narrowing as she stares at him.
It isn’t the perfect job, working at Hogwarts. His students are incredibly difficult (he loves them, God help him, he loves them) and he tries his best, and for the most part he’s found his footing. The workload is intense and he’s constantly exhausted, and when he trudges up the stairs to his private quarters, he passes plaque after plaque commemorating the people who died in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry’s never really had to face any of this, all these years since the War, too busy running towards -
‘The year is 1997,’ continues Draco. ‘The Ministry belongs to Voldemort. Lucius Malfoy makes an enormous payment to Selwyn Thestral Stables. Snatchers suddenly have money for food, clothing, buildings, potions. There is plenty of reward money available. But, strangely enough, at the war trials, nobody can seem to figure out who funded their activities.’
Draco’s shoulders lift in a bone-weary sigh. His gaze wanders over Pansy’s shoulder and he spots Harry standing there in the archway with the tray in his hands.
Draco puts on the kettle to make them chai. He watches Potter happily pouring daal into Draco’s cereal bowl and hates how easy it is to please this man who deserves
‘Not too bad, actually,’ comes the easy reply. ‘We’re coming onto exams in two weeks. It’s chaos and misery in the castle.’
‘They were rather rude, weren’t they?’ Luna pipes up. She takes a spoonful of Harry’s blood orange sorbet and dumps it into her butter-popcorn parfait. ‘I wonder what inspired them to behave that way. It’s very odd.’
Harry wonders how Malfoy’s been hiding this. He’s been watching Malfoy obsessively since before term started, but he’s never noticed -
‘I guess I’ll come back tomorrow to finish looking this over,’ Harry says, holding out the ledger.
‘Daphne, I’m working.’
And now it might be too late.
Harry wakes alone in bed with the sun streaming in past the curtains and for a moment he thinks that maybe he dreamt it all. But there is a warmth lingering in the sheets, and a familiar scent clinging to Harry’s clothes. Harry leans over and puts his glasses on, the world swimming back into focus, and he recalls the way he fell asleep with his legs tangled up with Draco’s, his face pushed into Draco’s warm chest, Draco’s hands tracing idle patterns on his back.
- but it sends sparks shuddering straight to Harry’s core all the same. Draco is beautiful tonight, dressed in a suit just a shade lighter than charcoal, his tie the same star-shimmer silver as his eyes. His hair frames his face, loose and feathery, softening all his sharp edges and drawing Harry’s eyes to the curve of his lips. He belongs in a song, or a fairy tale - something with curses and kisses and slumbering princesses.
Harry shakes his head slowly at Proudfoot. ‘You’re never going to find him if you pursue that angle,’ he tells the senior Auror.
‘Well?’ prompts Draco.
‘I want to make you as happy as you deserve to be,’ Draco whispers. He flicks the ring box open, revealing the band of white-gold within. ‘To give you everything you desire, to realise all your greatest aspirations. To defend you when you are attacked. To be your sanctuary, to hold you when you are weak. To go to bed with you, to wake up with you, to be with you for the rest of my life.’
The Slytherins all seemed to shake themselves as one, as though throwing off a daze. "Do we really have to?" asked Parkinson uneasily. "I don't want to be around them, Potter. They all hate us. And it's obviously at least one of them who's responsible. I'm in favor of waiting everything out from the safety of Draco's room."
The kisses immediately stilled as Harry pulled back to look at the other boy in surprise. "But…but I can't just tell him I can never see him again. He's my friend. We've been friends for
"Then tell him that," Blaise said, keeping his voice gentle. "Because he genuinely believes that you do hate him, Harry. And it's killing him."
who."
"Are you okay, Draco?" Harry asked softly, rubbing Draco's back in comfort.
"Who else has left this room besides Stephen and Anthony?" Harry cut in, glaring right back at Zacharias. Lord, how he disliked and distrusted that man.
brave?
"A mathematical error," he said with a casual wave of his hand. "Harry obviously adores me far too much to ever find fault with anything I do or say."
Draco couldn't wait to see how else they differed.
"Sooo, Malfoy," came a sly voice to his right. "Fancy a game of chess?"
"I was sure you hated me," Harry murmured, eyes still fixed on Draco's lips.
"You mean," Blaise finally gave in and snorted, "that the stupid moronic idiot that we've all been wondering about and trying to decide who could have been that much of a daft sodding dunderhead as to lead Harry Potter himself to the Slytherin common room, was
"Bowtruckles," he said as casually as he could.
"Pibby is not knowing!" the elf wailed. "I is only minding my own business, sirs, like a good elf, when I
"Just stop embarrassing yourself already and admit that I know him the best," Pansy said, reaching out to pat Blaise patronizingly on the shoulder.
"Oh no," Luna disagreed, smiling at Ginny. "She's not evil at all; she has a very kind aura."
Harry gaped at her while Zabini rolled his eyes, also directing his attention back to the board before him.
"It's my home," Draco swallowed, pulling away, "even if it isn't a particularly good one. They took me in when I needed help."
"Talk?" Harry echoed, feeling nearly dizzy from how hard his heart was pumping blood through his body. Cae was standing so close—close enough that Harry could feel the warmth of his body, could smell the familiar leathery-scent of his cologne, raw and dirty and
had lost anybody. Nobody cared if
But as Potter rose from his seat and began to stalk closer, Draco wondered if maybe he should start practicing his threatening tones more often. They were clearly not having the desired effect.
"Yes," Draco nodded, and without waiting for a response, he snatched at Harry's wrist, dragging him down the corridor and all but throwing him into an empty room.
Draco's eyes fell to the square box that Seek carried in his hands, covered in what appeared to be an entire roll of gaffer tape, and he tilted his head, wondering what was inside.
"Oh," Caelix said softly, and Harry cracked one eye open to give him a sardonic stare. "Can I ask you a question, Harry? One you promise not to take offense at?"
"You have the biggest nothing," Draco snorted, "other than ego."
"Right," he said, shoving his hands in his pockets to keep them from clenching. "Well. Have fun looking then, I guess. Sorry, I'll leave you alone." He turned to leave but was stopped by the sound of his name.
Draco took a deep breath. "I can say that I'll try," he said cautiously. "I can't promise we won't ever fight and I certainly can't promise that Weasley and I will ever like one another, but…" he hesitated, wondering if he had the courage to finish his statement.
together?
were both staying at the Manor. Daphne was staying as well. Daphne had been attacked. The Auror watching over her was dead. There was still no word from Greg, and Blaise had yet to make an appearance.
"Draco. My name." A name I have longed to hear spoken from those lips, after thirteen long years of acquaintance.
Potter looked surprised as well. "Well, uh, I dunno," he struggled for words. "It just…wasn't working, you know? For either of us. I suppose the feelings had just mellowed for both of us in the wake of the war until there was nothing between us but friendship again."
"That is exactly what I wish," Draco said in a low, soft voice. "Find them for me. Money is no object."
"What did you say back?" Pansy asked carefully, moving to sit on the other side of Draco.
"It's yours," Harry snorted, waving them off.
Harry grinned. "I prefer Draco pricks," he said lightly, grin widening as Pansy and Blaise laughed.
"There's nothing wrong with making an entrance," I say smoothly, turning around and offering her my arm for Side-Along Apparition.
Draco would let it pass for now.
"Mm, Potter," Draco tried to complain, voice muffled by Potter's lips.
And as his footsteps echoed lightly along the marble staircase, he wondered fervently again whether Draco was okay.
As he spoke, Harry pulled his hand away and rose to his feet, staring at the corpses as he wondered if anyone would be missing. What would it mean if all the caterers were there in that pile?
"His knob's not tiny," Harry protested belatedly.
"You sound so upset about it," Harry breathed, feeling relief course through him at the obvious anger in Malfoy's every word. If Draco was that furious at the thought of someone attempting to slip Harry a love potion, then surely that meant that there was no way the blond would ever have done that very same thing himself. Right?
He heard the words, but Draco was having difficulty focusing on anything besides the colored bits of metal stuck through the other man's face—he had never seen so many piercings in a person's head before. There were countless pieces of jewelry sticking all along the man's ears, as well as hoops around his lip and nose, and bars through one eyebrow. The man's bangs were longer than the rest of his spiky hair and were dyed a shockingly bright pink, but the rest of his scalp was bleached a horrendously offensive fake shade of platinum. On his feet was a pair of shoes so worn out and falling apart that Draco was convinced that magic must be the only thing still holding them together. His jeans were faded and wrapped tightly around his long thin legs like a second skin, below a clingy t-shirt depicting squiggly lines that Draco would guess to be mountains, above which were stamped the words JOY DIVISION.
"Oh, god, yes!" he moaned, both hands clenched tightly in Harry's hair. "Merlin, Harry, that feels incredible!"
"Have a lovely time, then," I bite out before snapping open a different navy folder and disappearing behind it once more. Just like my previous attempt, it's thwarted once again by a single pale finger lowering the folder back to the desk.
"As if, mate," his ginger partner scoffed. "First of all: I'm engaged. To a woman, with female anatomy. And second: Cae's only got eyes for you."
"I never said that," Draco defended automatically.
"Your better half, clearly," Zabini returned, and Harry shook his head in wry amusement.
"Well, I mean, that makes sense and I definitely believe it," Blaise shrugged, "considering the fact that I do have eyeballs and have seen the clothes he wears. Still, though…to be eighteen and never actually own your own clothing? I don't know if it'll ever make sense to me, no matter how many times I hear it."
He hugged her back, burying his face in her shoulder and saying nothing for long moments. "No," he finally said, voice muffled. "No, Tracey, I'm not."
"I'm glad you told me," Malfoy said in a voice that trembled, matching the tremble in Harry's insides.
Hermione rubbed his arm soothingly. "I'm sure after you both cool down a bit you'll get it all sorted."
A pale hand suddenly reached out and grasped his wrist, making Harry gasp as he flicked his wand up to press against a slender throat.
"Of course not, Harry," Hermione scoffed, straightening in her chair and tucking a thick curl behind one ear. Harry watched it spring right back into place the moment her fingers were back in her lap. "But even you have to admit that you've never really had the best handle on your anger, and I know that you clearly dislike the current situation and clearly dislike Malfoy and I know you already dislike Potions on top of everythi—"
"I believe you," Harry said awkwardly, unsure what it was this girl really wanted. Was this another attempt at drugging him? "Thank you, er…sorry, what's your name?"
"Well, aren't you in a mood this morning," Blaise's eyes flashed as he removed his hand and sat back in his chair. "Both you and the Chosen Auror." That got Draco's attention. His gaze flicked back to meet Blaise's, to find the man appraising him coolly. "Your foul moods wouldn't have anything to do with one another, I wonder, would they, love?"
Ron's voice flashed through his mind suddenly, the words only a few days old, but it seemed like ages:
They had been sitting in silence, staring at each other in a strange combination of warmth, wariness, and surprise, perhaps at both finding themselves in that situation. Malfoy's arm was completely still where it lay draped over Harry's back, fingers resting between his shoulder blades. The quiet had been unnoticeable at first; comfortable, even, but it began to slowly build into a ferocious itch, begging for Harry to scratch it with words. But the Auror had no clue what to say. He wasn't even sure what it was that was happening, or how exactly things had led to this…whatever it was.
One corner of Harry's mouth pulled up in a half-grin and he shook his head. "I don't think I would be as happy about it, though." He turned to smirk at Malfoy only to find him silently seething, glaring at Blaise as if he would like nothing more than to rip out the man's intestines with his fingernails. Blaise only smiled innocently at Draco, resulting in the blond's anger worsening.
"And what else happened?" Malfoy asked in a low voice.
"Sorrow"—Edna St. Vincent Millay
"You're absolutely adorable." Harry's smile widened and Draco felt his heart stumble and skip a beat.
"How's everything going with Malfoy and Greengrass?" asked Neville, straightening in his seat and setting his quill aside.
"But he looks good in pink, Draco," Blaise said, trying to force his face into an innocent expression.
"Okay, thank you," he nodded, smiling tightly at her. She smiled back, staring at him for several moments before turning away.
And the sight of Draco trying so desperately to hold himself together and be all right made Harry's chest ache and it felt like his heart would crumble to pieces watching the man attempt to keep every scrap of pain and fear hidden from view. A glance back down the hallway confirmed that Ron and Neville had indeed gone into Daphne's room and that they were alone together in the long corridor.
"Yes, really," the brunet smiled, capturing Draco's mouth in a kiss. "I don't know how else I can tell you how much I like you, Draco. I never thought that any of this could ever actually happen. But now that it is, I want you and everyone else to know how serious I am about you. I—" But everything else was cut off as Draco leant forward to kiss him, seizing his face between two hands and kissing him as fiercely as he could, unable to help himself.
"Would you rather us leave?" Pansy asked quietly, in a rare somber moment.
At first, their relationship had been brilliant. It had been a source of light for him in the darkness of his life at the time. Everything had been so painful and terrifying; he had still been struggling with the loss of Sirius and had begun learning about Voldemort far too intimately, coupled with his usual near-death experiences, schoolwork, and a Quidditch captaincy—not to mention all the fucking articles, rumors, and occasional attempts to slip him love potions—had all left him feeling isolated and miserable. The only times he hadn't felt like everything was spinning out of control were the stolen moments in Ginny's arms. She would hold him close and whisper in his ear, trail her fingers lightly over his bare skin. Her laugh would never fail to bring a smile to his face and her kisses used to give him hope. But now…
"Malfoy wasn't at dinner either," Ron added, and Harry wasn't sure if his tone was more prodding or suspicious. "Something happen between the two of you?"
"If it was one of us," Zabini narrowed his eyes, "we must certainly be talented, hmm? Considering we weren't even fucking there last night."
"Then at least there's that," Seek said simply.
"I don't know." Draco wanted to see Seek so badly, but how could he? What could he say that would excuse his absence? "I'd need to think of some sort of excuse to get away for a bit."
Harry stared at him for several moments, trying to figure out how best to word his rampaging thoughts. "Do you really not know me at all, Draco?" The question succeeded in snapping Draco's gaze up to meet his own. "I mean, do you really think that I'll ditch you the second we get out of this house? This isn't just some temporary fling I'm using as a distraction from everything horrible that's happening. I like you, Draco. I really like you." He reached out to stroke the back of one finger down Malfoy's cheek, who was not even blinking as he listened to Harry. "And I don't necessarily think it's appropriate to broadcast our relationship to everyone in the midst of such terror and grief, but…"
"No," Draco snorted. God, he wished. "I wish. Stupid Blaise hid all the alcohol. You should know that if you're nothing more than a figment of my imagination."
"Relax," he said with a heavy eye roll. "I'm not here to hurt anybody."
I'm going to come if you keep this up!"
Parvati snorted, tears still streaming down her cheeks. "But when do you not sound creepy, Seamus?" she responded weakly.
"Now," Hermione continued, ignoring Smith, "I think we should all spend the night together. Hopefully, we won't be here very long, but in case it comes to it, the dining room is more than large enough to fit us all comfortably, and we can all conjure beds to sleep on."
"Malfoy?" Weasley's tone was nudging and Draco realized that he had never answered his question.
Seek grinned. "Not so easily, no. I was planning on charming it out of you."
Harry said nothing for several moments, and Draco finally glanced up to find him staring at Draco with the signature intense stare that Draco had missed over the past fortnight. Lord, he had nearly forgotten how Harry was able to set every inch of him on fire with the power of his gaze alone.
"Um, excuse me," Blaise cut in, "my face was your face. We both had the same face. You were just as confused by the concept as I was. Plus, leave my face out of this."
"Hey," Harry said with a soft smile, settling back between Draco's legs and pressing another kiss to his thigh as he coated the fingers of his right hand in lube. Shifting up, he bent down to kiss Draco at the same moment he slid one finger into the blond, and Draco felt his back arch slightly at the sensation. Harry took his time with one finger before gradually inserting another. He crooked them and grinned against Draco's mouth as a breathless groan escaped the Slytherin.
"Why are you even here then?" Harry wondered, turning his head to the side to speak more clearly. "I mean, who even talks to dead bodies anyway?"
Polyjuice Potion!"
Scribbling back a hasty
"Good thing I plan on finding out then, huh?" Draco whispered, clutching at Potter's hair even tighter. Merlin, where had he learned how to flirt so convincingly? Draco had always thought of himself as socially awkward in one-on-one situations, but he appeared to have somehow been harboring a secret mastery in superior flirting skills that he had not even known he possessed. Huh. He always knew he was talented in ways he wasn't even aware of.
, Draco sighed to himself, proven right in the next second as Blaise continued speaking. "I heard that you helped devirginize Draco a bit last night."
"You two bet on whether or not I was a virgin?" Potter gaped.
"Well?" he snapped, impatience coloring his tone. "You have the blasted print or whatever you called it. What are you doing with it now?"
"Seamus and I won't let you and Padma out of our sights," Dean promised. "We swear it."
Draco stared at her. "You stole
"And on everything else?" Harry asked hesitantly, scared of both the question and the answer.
"Just let me know when you are," he said with a sad smile, unsure of what else to say, "You know how to find me. And besides," his smile widened by a fraction, "I'm not the center of the universe, you know."
Relaxing back into the soft pillow, Harry smiled to himself as he watched Malfoy begin to stir, stretching his back and yawning widely. His eyes were still closed and his silken hair mussed, and he looked so impossibly soft and irresistibly warm that Harry simply could not stop himself from touching.
"No," he said finally, long after Draco had fallen silent. "No, Draco, I don't…it-it can't…I don't understand, it
At those words, Harry's fingers began to itch, longing to draw the Marauder's Map from his bag and scan it for Malfoy's dot. His evil dot. Probably doing evil things
"To what do I owe this rare pleasure, Draco?" his father asked in a soft voice, words steeped in ice. "After nearly four long years of not so much as a single letter, I was certainly not expecting a visit from you. I believed you had all but forgotten about your father, sitting here waiting for my own cowardly son to find enough courage to finally be able to look me in the eye."
Grinning at the mental image of the shocked expression Hermione was sure to wear when she heard the news that Malfoy collected Muggle authors, it took several seconds to notice that Malfoy was quiet and that a dark look had crossed his face. At the sight, Harry's smile dropped and he immediately regretted his question.
"Who knew you were such a closet romantic?" Potter mused, kissing his temple lingeringly. "I love it."
"To prove that we could be inclusive," Parkinson answered, "even if the one we're including is someone we detest."
"I did kiss you back, you know," Draco pointed out, feeling nearly dizzy as the words fell from his lips before he had even thought them through, excitement and hope rushing through his veins with every hammering beat of his buoyant heart.
"I remember always refusing to touch him," Blaise said thoughtfully, thinking back.
die today, hmm?"
At the explanation, Malfoy's expression cleared. "Oh, it's fine." For some reason he also dropped his gaze and colored, drawing Harry's notice to the delicate pink of his blush, not to mention the unknown reason behind it.
Malfoy tilted his head and studied Harry at an angle. "Why not?" he asked finally, and Harry shrugged again.
"Oh," Pansy said quietly, lifting a hand to her heart. "God. Draco, is this that Gryffindor sincerity you were saying can be well past overwhelming at times? Because I feel properly overwhelmed at the moment."
"Despairing Cries"
"Yeah," Harry replied glumly. He needed to
At the mention of paperwork, Ron groaned and raked a hand through his hair. "All right, I'll stay here with the two weird Slytherins," he nodded. "Let me know if anything has changed, yeah?"
As the memory crept into his mind of them pressed together so intimately on the couch, clutching each other and gasping, he felt his body remembering as well. Had he even consciously realized before the previous day how attracted to Draco he was? Had this realization all been because of Caelix? Harry had never had reason to question his sexuality in the past; there had never really been any time or cause to think about it in his adolescence, and then he had been with Ginny.
"Seek?" he whispered, glancing around to make sure he really was alone.
"Oh, good lord, I take it all back," Hermione sighed, rubbing her temples. "Congratulations, you're both back to being just as equally immature."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nothing happened," Harry insisted, trying to snatch the parchment back.
Harry shrugged. "Sorry. I know it's not any of my business or anything, I was just curious." His steps halted as he finally reached the windowsill, folding his arms atop it and leaning against them as he stared out at the dark grounds. It was beautiful. The moon was just beginning to wax, a tiny silver crescent peeking out behind a single wispy cloud in the surrounding navy of the night sky, and he glanced up to find eyes just as silver watching him from only inches away.
"It doesn't have to," she shrugged. "But tell me who this boy is. Is he another eighth-year?"
"Excellent sign," Draco murmured, unable to move his gaze from Potter's soft-looking mouth.
"No," Draco sighed, pulling back far enough to look Harry in the eye. "We're already here, and I really don't want to put this off any longer. It's been over six months since I was released from St. Mungo's. It's long past time that I finally came here and made peace."
"Are you okay?"
Harry's grin widened. "Your friends love me."
He leaned more heavily into Harry, who wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer into his side.
"No," Harry sighed. Draco was only a part of it. "It's everything, Cae, it's all of it." He ran a hand through his hair. The fingers on his shoulder were still gripping him. "It's just…" he struggled to describe what "it" all was. "It's just fucking all of it, you know?" The words were heavy and felt like stones on Harry's tongue. His voice was weary—just as weary as his body felt. His bones felt weighed down and ancient; his eyes were sore and exhausted, as though they had just
"What's going to happen to him?" Harry finally asked, voice soft and unsure. Harry had known that bringing him to the Hospital Wing had been the best thing for Malfoy, but what would happen to the blond now that he was there? Would he be punished for it? Sent to St. Mungo's? Given detention? Harry had no idea what to expect.
"What about you?" he asked, wanting to get the subject away from himself, but also curious about what Malfoy had been up to since his acquittal. "I always thought that you and Parkinson were together, but she and Zabini chose to be partners and were holding hands."
Draco's mouth dropped open in shock. "Cute?" he demanded. "What the hell do they mean by cute? I have never been so insulted in my life! We're
"You have no idea how much the guilt was killing him," Blaise continued. "There were times when I truly did think it was going to completely overwhelm him. Why do you think he ran out on you your first night together? He already had feelings for you and the guilt was eating him alive. He's always cared about you, Harry. He loves you, you idiot."
"Can we just lay down for now?" Draco asked softly. "Together?"
"Potter!" a sharp voice called, and Harry's head snapped up to find Zabini and Nott standing near a doorway along the distant wall, staring at him with narrowed, serious eyes. Without hesitation, Harry hurried over to them, trying his hardest to brush all thoughts away of whose bedroom he had found himself inside.
"And today?" Harry asked softly, leaning against the car next to Draco. He shifted closer until their arms were pressed together. God help him, he wanted to touch the man everywhere.
Ducking into the corridor, Harry clutched the folder to his chest and leaned against the wall, taking several deep breaths before shoving away and walking quickly back to his office. Once inside, he was relieved to see Ron seated at his desk, facing Harry's own across the room.
"Okay," Harry nodded. "Stay here. Neville," he leaned around Smith to speak to the other man, "will you stay here with him?"
"Shit," Harry said, jumping to his feet. "We need to go find them!"
Oh no! Screams that curdle blood are the worst kind of screams to be trapped in a house with! Any suspicions on the killer yet, darlings? Or their motivation? Any guesses on who the scream came from or who will be the next to die? Any thoughts on your local weather or any new year's resolutions you've accomplished and/or given up on that you would like to talk about? I'm here to listen :)
"You're welcome," she breathed, staring at him with shining eyes that made Harry uncomfortable.
Maybe Harry's presence at the Manor was getting to be just too much—for Draco, for Zabini, for himself. What was he really doing there anyway? He hadn't protected anybody, hadn't saved anyone. All he had done was make a fool of himself and get rejected for it. And that was hardly something he wanted to stick around to continue doing.
Aaand with drama comes truth. I know a lot of you had already called it from the first chapter, you clever little badgers :) Prepare for even more drama next chapter!
Oh god, Harry shouldn't be out there alone. Every instinct he had was screaming at him to find somewhere safe, somewhere less exposed. Anybody could be watching him in the darkness; he had willingly made himself the easiest target in the house by venturing out on his own. Anyone could be hiding in one of the dozens of shadows crouched around the corridor.
Malfoy nodded seriously. "Something we're both grateful for."
The sight hurt too much to see and Harry quickly turned away.
"I—Harry…" Draco looked lost for a moment, standing before the window in a halo of silver moonlight, appearing small and confused and lost in the cold darkness of the vast night sky behind him, and the sight made Harry's heart hurt. "Potter…"
"Hey," the brunet said, standing far closer than Draco could have believed possible without the blond becoming aware of his presence.
Potter snorted but did not refute the statement, something that Blaise took to be an overwhelming victory.
"So, Potter," Blaise said casually, beginning to serve himself dinner, "how does the Hall look from this side of the room?"
At once, several names popped into mind, but most of the list was dead and the rest were in Azkaban. So no, Harry was at a complete loss as to who was behind the horrifying string of attacks.
Snorting, she shook her head at him in amusement. "If nothing else, Draco, I will always have you to entertain me."
With a grunt, he lowered Draco's leg from his shoulder and grasped the other man tightly before rolling them over, raking his gaze over the sight of a flushed Draco looming over him. Draco bit his lip as he settled into a comfortable position, squeezing Harry's biceps as he began to roll his hips down into him. Harry clutched at his thighs, tracing the dragon tattoo with one hand before placing his hands on Draco's waist and helping him lift up and drop, the man rolling his body in sensuous waves that had Harry bucking up into him and groaning.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione to find them both staring at him in surprise. Blushing, he folded his arms across his chest, feeling defensive as he said stubbornly, "I like him."
Draco thought crossly but then frowned as he pondered the question.
"If it really did say what you're implying it does," Nott shrugged, "then all that would
"We all picked partners we trust though," Harry pointed out, "of course we're not waiting around to see if they're the guilty one."
"I hardly fawn, you prat," Potter retorted, grin widening.
"Oh yeah," Fen guffawed. "We voted today. We're done with all this waiting 'round shit we've been doin'."
"What do you want to do today?"
The man's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Are you helping me?"
"There," Fen said in a cold, clipped voice. "You have your answer. Now both of you get the fuck out of our room."
"Yes," she nodded. "Most of them are still sleeping, but Neville and I have been doing head counts every hour and everybody is still alive and accounted for."
Harry sighed. "It's simple, really. I want you back in my life."
At that, Hermione appeared interested. "And who was the first to arrive?"
It was official—the plan had worked. Blaise's mad plan had actually worked, and Draco was surprised at how little effort the whole seduction bollocks had actually taken. Either Potter was extremely easy or Draco was extremely talented.
"You're going out?" Potter seemed surprised, as though he had been expecting Draco to lock himself away in the isolated safety of his own home with only himself for company, passing the time by never speaking to anybody. And once the danger was over and the others were gone, that was most likely what Draco would end up doing.
"Potter," he choked, gazing around in confusion. "What the hell are you doing in my bed?"
The words made Draco pause, feeling torn. A large part of him wanted to scoff at Potter and mock him for his ridiculous sentimentality, but an even larger part of himself wanted to simultaneously melt at the words and also hug Harry hard enough to somehow fuse them together so they would never have to be apart.
hurt.
"Why do you all act like we have absolutely nothing in common?" Harry asked, wondering what Draco would do if Harry were to 'accidentally' elbow him.
what was causing it? Was that what had caused the feeling before, in the Manor?
"No!" Draco ground out, glaring harder.
Even if every second ticking by pushed them closer to their inevitable separation, Draco would try his hardest to enjoy every scrap of time allotted them. He would smile and laugh and enjoy Seek's company; he would soak up as much happiness as he could while he was there and hope it was enough to keep him warm when he left.
, he thought absently, setting down the empty glass next to the others.
"Ron!" Harry scolded at the same moment Draco cried "Hey!" and made a rude hand gesture, but he sighed and rolled off of Malfoy, who looked even more upset about the loss of contact than about the hurtful nickname and turned enraged eyes onto Ron, who had finally lowered his hands enough to peer at them.
before the two of you ever got involved. And you wear my clothes and sleep in the same room as me. So he can deal with it."
"It's sort of hard to tell with Malfoy," Harry responded wryly and Neville chuckled. "But I think he's okay, mostly. Daphne is…traumatized."
"No, I just…" Draco trailed off as he realized that he didn't actually know how to respond. Yes, he wanted to stop. But at the same time, despite his fear, he wanted Harry to fuck him. The contradiction was making his head spin; Draco laid back down on the pillow with a deep breath. "What are you waiting for, Potter? An official letter granting you my permission? Just get on with it; take my virginity already, for Christ's sake."
Aaanyway, I hope that all you lovely anonymous faces out there enjoy the chapter, and I hope that no one is too upset about the wait or about the intense soap opera dramatic realness of it all! Sorry again. Love you again. Please leave me reviews :)
"Well, he's obviously the guilty one then," Nott drawled. "Unless someone else was the last one to see Boot or be seen with him, it's obviously got to be his partner."
ful; Pansy needed her eyes checked.
Harry shrugged again without replying as Hermione led the way back to the knife, bending down and dipping the brush in the small tin of powder, shaking any extra powder loose before looking down at the knife and hesitating.
"Harry," Malfoy whispered, a horrified look crossing his face. "Oh my god, Harry…I-I didn't…oh, god, I'm
more than you do about Malfoy."
"Nothing but revulsion," Draco sneered, but it was rather watery and felt far from his best.
"Because," Draco shrugged, "he said we're always together and I guess he saw that horrid kiss that Blaise forced on me in the Great Hall the other day like the perverse molesting bastard he is."
"Harry," Ron interrupted, frowning at him. "She's just worried about you. There's nothing wrong with being cautious, you know. Just go to Pomfrey and get yourself checked out. If there is no potion, then getting checked out can't do any harm, can it?"
"Fuck, Potter," Blaise said in an impressed voice, "are you saying that you used Polyjuice at the age of twelve to sneak into the Slytherin common room and in the process tricked Draco into being the one to show you where it is by specifically choosing Crabbe and Goyle to impersonate after first brewing a notoriously difficult and restricted potion in secret somewhere in this school before then stealing pieces of their DNA?"
Malfoy nodded without a word, eyes locked on the floor, and Harry wasn't sure what expression it was he saw on Malfoy's face, but he knew he didn't like it. Striding forward, he slid one finger under Malfoy's chin and tilted it up enough to press a soft kiss to his mouth.
The next day was spent almost entirely in blessed solitude. He took his meals in his room and spoke to no one. The silencing charms he had set around his chambers allowed him total privacy, unable to hear anybody knocking had any of the others chosen to try to visit. The morning light had not brought with it any desire to see anybody else, and nobody could make him until he was ready. Maybe he would just stay in his room until the entire investigation was over. Pibby could bring him his meals and his books, and Draco could simply wait out the bloodshed within the safe confines of his own bedroom.
, Harry thought to himself, unsure what to make of the situation,
"Fuck," he managed weakly as his knees gave out. Harry ran forward, catching him just before he hit the ground.
Climbing slowly to his feet, Draco fixed the other man with a hard stare, feeling molten rage swirling through every inch of him, racing through his veins with fierce, fiery loathing, searing through him and growing hotter and hotter with every hateful, crippling question Blaise slashed him with. "Get. Out."
No matter how much he knew it would hurt to watch him leave.
"Draco!" he called, crossing his arms and strolling over to the two boys. "You absolute fucking wanker." Dark eyes glared and Draco shifted uneasily.
"Okay," Draco agreed weakly, body throbbing with pain. Yes, St. Mungo's really did sound like an excellent plan. "Will you…" he flushed but forced himself to ask the question, "will you stay with me? I—I don't want to be left alone. Not after…" he gestured weakly around the room with one blood-soaked hand, lowering it when he noticed how badly his fingers were shaking. His entire body was trembling as his stomach fought down wave after wave of nausea. Blackness licked at the edges of his vision, creeping in closer and closer as his mind struggled to make sense of every horrifying thing that had happened, finally surrendering with a grateful sigh as darkness clouded his vision and wrapped his mind up tight in a protective quilt of onyx nothingness, doing its best to keep the nightmares at bay as long as it could.
"It wasn't the Slytherins," Harry said, feeling worried. Who the hell had killed her?
"Can I…" Harry began but then hesitated. "I don't want you to feel pressured or anything, but I'd really like to kiss you, Draco. Could—could I?"
"Okay," Harry nodded, rushing outside and locking up his house. "Okay, that's fine. I'll come get you. Where are you?"
Silence cracked around the Common Room like the sharp lash from a whip. Draco stood with his hands clenched, squeezing his eyes shut tight, willing himself not to
"Nobody fucked anybody!" the blond hissed, glancing around the three of them as they exited the classroom and began to make their way to the library. "For Christ's sake, Pans, I already told you that not everybody is as big a slag as you!"
"I'm doing fine," Harry mumbled, collapsing back into a seated position on his mattress.
Draco flinched at the sound of a fist smashing into Wire's cheek.
For the first time in his memory, Harry Potter was touching him in a way that was neither violent nor done out of the necessity of a life-threatening situation. He was touching Draco out of
"All right," Wescott sighed. "God, this fucking case is turning out to be a nightmare." Harry, Ron, and Seaver all nodded in agreement. They were silent for a moment as they watched the two groups march across the grounds and into the dark house. An eerie silence fell over the four of them, broken by Ron.
"It hasn't even been ten minutes," Harry pointed out, glancing around. It seemed like nearly everybody was there.
"No," Harry shook his head. "You lot need to be part of the decision-making 'round here. And if you do nothing but lock yourselves away out of sight, they may begin to think you really are the ones behind it and actively seek you out."
"Who, Neville? Who are you talking about?" Harry felt panicked, wondering what the hell was taking the members of the guard so long. What on earth had happened to Neville?
. His heart was pounding in his chest, fire and adrenaline were coursing through his veins, searing through his body; Harry felt
"Shall we head down to breakfast, then?" he asked, desperate for anything to break the silence.
"So you're hoping we can all become friends?" Harry asked, raising one eyebrow and sounding skeptical. "I'm not sure if it's really as easy as just throwing a dinner party."
Harry turned his face to the sky, feeling the dull sunlight on his skin. Was any of it really happening? Was he really there with Draco? Was Draco really touching him in such a mind-melting way? Every touch, every lick, every swipe of Draco's tongue against him was making Harry fall apart; he quivered and shook and moaned, earning a shivery moan from Draco in response. Harry lightly ran the backs of his fingers over Draco's cheek, groaning at the feel of his own prick poking against the inside of Draco's mouth.
big, probably the biggest in the entire school. Probably even the nation, who knows, it certainly wouldn't surprise me. And reminding me that I'm the only person you've ever done this to will not help anything."
As long as Draco would have him, Harry never wanted to be anywhere else.
Blaise's gaze dropped to the floor. "Just you," he said quietly.
Holy fuck. He used to hate Malfoy, didn't he? Did he? The more he thought back on everything, the harder it was for him to dredge up how that hatred had felt. The Slytherin had always been able to affect Harry more than anybody else seemed able to. They had always been at odds with one another, ever since the first day on the train, when Harry had refused to shake his hand for—at that moment—a tenuous friendship with Ron, his first actual friend after Hagrid.
The sound of an approaching car had Harry dropping the duster in excitement, ignoring the small plume of dust that rose as it hit the carpet. He hurried to the door, wrenching it open and practically running outside. Draco was just climbing out of the small blue car when he noticed Harry, flashing him a shy smile, and the sight made Harry's heart stop dead in his chest. God, Draco was so beautiful.
"Yeah," Ron agreed, placing the pawn he had been polishing for the last ten minutes aside. "What's a little rain to those blokes, eh? Tough as dragon scales, that lot."
And then, his cock was in Draco's mouth and Harry's entire world was perfect. He knew it was not an appropriate time for the two of them to be doing such a thing, but at that moment, Harry couldn't make himself care even if he were to try. Because Draco's mouth was perfect, and Draco was perfect, and they felt perfect together.
"I'm not sure Weasley won't try to strangle me with a shoelace or hex my balls off under the table," Draco pointed out, feeling light-headed from Potter's proximity. Lord, how was he always able to make Draco feel so dizzy just by looking at him in a certain way? Was Draco coming down with something? Was this another side effect of those spontaneous allergies that he decided he most definitely had? Draco didn't need a Healer to diagnose him—he was more than capable of properly diagnosing himself. And dizziness brought on by spontaneous allergies was certainly more believable than dizziness being brought on by Harry Potter.
Pibby popped into sight, wailing deafeningly and beating his tiny fists upon the floor. "Bad, bad, Pibby! I is failing! I is failing my Master! Pibby is horrible bad useless elf!" the creature sobbed, bashing his head against the carpet. Draco instantly dropped to his knees and lifted Pibby's shaking frame to a standing position, pulling him up to look at the blond.
But as Greg grinned widely at him, Draco found himself smiling back and decided that maybe some things had stayed the same, after all.
"But the front door is now warded just as heavily," Hermione frowned.
"Or you could teach them about Epsinfoderus Algae," Luna continued in her musical lilt, smiling up at Longbottom. "That's a sea plant that lives in warmer waters and is said to be able to take on the characteristics of passing ocean life. It's also called Mimicking Seaweed and is meant to be quite difficult to find, apparently. I think that's because no one actually knows what it really looks like, since it can't help but copy everything it sees. I wonder if the poor plant even knows what it's supposed to look like," she sighed, and Draco was once again unsure if she was joking or being genuine.
Draco's mouth dropped open in shock. "You absolute knob face, I am not an albino! My hair is
passed through Draco at the sight, whether it was hope, desire, tenderness, lust, maybe just a need to distract himself from the current horrors plaguing him, he was not sure, but he knew without a doubt in that moment that he wanted Potter. He wanted Potter's mouth on his, his hands on his skin, his voice crying out Draco's name; he wanted to see the green eyes staring up at him from his position on his knees before the blond, as well as the reverse. Draco knew if there was a chance for him to get on his knees for the Chosen One, he would not hesitate.
to stop talking about Potter."
His gaze flicked to Draco to find him scowling, eyes flashing dangerously, and Harry stretched out one arm to place it over Draco's in an attempt to placate, just out of Ginny's line of vision. "Yeah, Gin," he said hollowly. "Er, me too." And it was the truth; he did miss her. He just wasn't sure it was wise to tell her as much. It would be too easy to misinterpret his meaning.
"You can afford it," she said, still not glancing up from her finished essay. Did this make the third or the fourth time she was re-reading the blasted thing? How many times was she going to look it over until it was perfect enough to hand in?
men, right? It just meant that Blaise came up with stupid plans that had no actual bearing on reality.
"Okay," he exhaled, rubbing his damp palms on his trousers. "Okay, I guess I'll go now. We're meeting in the Entrance Hall. So, er, yeah. I guess. Wish me luck then?"
Gritting his teeth, Harry felt the urge to throw something through a window. It seemed to the Auror that, between the killer and Zabini—whether they were the same or separate people—there would always be someone trying to tear Harry and Draco apart. And that was not even mentioning Caelix and his volatile reaction. Would the rest of the nation say such awful things too, once they caught wind of his and Malfoy's relationship? Would the entire world not be satisfied until Harry and Draco were forever separated? Would they not rest until Draco was torn straight from Harry's embrace? Until the man was ripped directly from his arms?
Draco seemed amused by Harry's reaction; his smile was smug and he appeared extremely pleased with himself. It was an expression Harry couldn't resist and he bent forward to capture that smug mouth in a searing kiss. Malfoy responded with a moan that sent shivers racing through Harry and any brain functions being used to calculate how long it had last been since he'd laughed were quickly being focused elsewhere.
He left the Hall grinning and relaxed for the first time since the
"Thank you, Professor," Harry said, speaking in a quiet voice. Draco heard her walk away, but he did not want to look up from his confetti-covered plate. Stupid Valentine's Day. He had never even wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day. It was without a doubt the most useless holiday ever invented.
"Oh," Draco said quietly, sounding surprised. Harry pressed another kiss to Draco's back as he continued to wash the man's hair, earning a moan from the blond, who had his eyes shut and a pretty smile lighting his face.
"A Malfoy year?" Harry repeated blankly, frozen with one hand in his hair. The way Ron spoke, it made Harry sound a bit mental; one might even say obsessed. Pathological, even. A heavy frown slid across his face. Harry was most definitely not obsessed—with anything. Especially not with Malfoy. Harry had plenty of other things in his extremely full and oh-so-nauseatingly-interesting life to focus on other than pratty, posh Slytherin albinos.
"It's not a joke, Harry," Malfoy argued, sounding frustrated. "How many times do I have to tell you that?"
"Should—should I go now, then?" Harry wondered hesitantly. "Or do you think I should give him space for a bit? Maybe let him calm down toward me first, or something?"
not some silly twit that he used to have a pathetic crush on in school.
"Wait, I'm confused," Pansy smirked, "are we arseholes or twatty cunts?"
Swinging his gaze, Harry glanced to the corner to notice a straight wooden staircase leading up to a second level that looked down on them all, the upstairs appearing to be less than half the size of the room they were in. Past the oiled banister of the second-level balcony, Harry caught a glimpse of more towering bookshelves, and he wondered how many books the enormous room held. Against the far wall sat a large wooden fireplace, empty and barren, and it wasn't until that moment that Harry realized how cold the room was. Despite the beauty and the enormity, the library felt strangely still and lifeless, as though the books were holding their breath. The room felt hollow, almost, in a way that Harry could not explain, suddenly feeling tiny and insignificant surrounded by mile-high bookshelves holding countless novels with unknown names staring down at the six of them in absolute indifference. It made Harry sad, and he was not sure why.
"Zacharias?" she asked sharply, scribbling in her notepad. "Are you sure?"
He straddled Harry's hips and began peppering his face with tiny kisses. "Fuck me, Harry," he whispered. And it was Harry's turn to freeze.
"That's at least some sort of progress, isn't it?" Draco had every hope that more progress could be made with Harry's friends, just as soon as Weasley stopped being such an insufferable knobhead, something the blond did not actually have too much hope of ever happening. So, maybe not very much hope for progress after all.
"Excuse me? Harry Potter?"
Growling, Harry slashed his wand and shouted, for what had to be the hundredth time, "Reducto!" This time, however, they both paused as a deep groan issued from the wood, along with a loud splintering sound that made Draco jump as a large crack split a sudden seam in the wall above the doorframe, the damage stretching all the way up to the ceiling.
"Further up ahead!" Harry yelled. The screaming had stopped but Harry thought he could hear sobbing coming from somewhere along the darkened corridor. Oh god, who was it this time? Who had been killed?
Harry let out a shaky laugh. "It's not, though. None of it is. This is all just so fucking
"No, it

"What do we do if the fingerprint
"That's not what I'm asking," Ron interrupted. "Forget all that other stuff for the moment, I'm asking who you would rather be with. Who do you have the stronger feelings for?"
Fuck. Was Draco crying? He hadn't even been aware that he was close to crying, for fuck's sake.
"Christ," Harry muttered. "Stephen and Anthony could be hiding in this place for years before we find them. They could be hiding here for years without us
Pulling the Map from his pocket and tapping it with his wand, his eyes began automatically to search the dungeons. There was Draco Malfoy's dot, all alone and ensconced yet again in the Slytherin Common Room.

If this was how the girl chose to conduct all of her conversations, Draco would never be able to speak to her. Once again, he was at a complete loss for what to say. Was he really so transparent? Did she really not harbour a single grudge against him?

"I can't," he whispered, eyes wide with fear and uncertainty. Oh god, what was he doing? Fenrir would kill them both if he ever found out!
Harry shook his head. "There's only one person it could have been then, Hermione."
"So, did we all live through the night then?" a voice drawled several feet away, and Harry and Draco turned to find Zabini sitting up in bed next to a stirring Parkinson, staring at the two of them with an intensity that made Harry uncomfortable. How long had the man been awake? What had he seen and heard? What was he thinking?
Harry stared at her in shock. Good together? Were they? Harry certainly thought they were, but did Ginny think so too? Was she simply saying that?
"Who would you rather be with?"
Potter nodded firmly. "Everybody treats my boyfriend with respect. Spread the word."
"So, er, what can I do for you, then? Is this an Auror thing?" Rhys asked nervously.
Harry rolled his eyes, struggling to free himself before giving up with a reluctant grin. "Fine, I get it. You still have at least a few more years before the nursing home."
Draco stared at him for several moments before reaching out to touch the man's bare chest. "Am I really here?" he wondered, gazing around the room as he waited for the awful moment when he woke to discover he was really back in his old, filthy room in the clubhouse, lying next to a drunken, handsy Fenrir.
? Although, I suppose it is interesting to know just how many words rhyme with 'suck'."

Smith turned his enraged eyes on Harry, opening his mouth to speak before he was cut off by the sound of Michael's voice. "Yeah, Smith, great idea, go ahead and goad Harry Potter. You do realize he's a trained Auror, don't you?"
"We'll go on ahead," Blaise cut in, giving Potter an amused look. "We'll see you in class, Draco."
"Well," Ron said with a shrug, "let's go get those answers then."
"He just threatened me
"Morning, Potter," Draco greeted, straightening and lowering his feet to the floor. He reached for one of the numerous markers always lying around the library and tucked it between the pages of the book before setting it aside. Draco was constantly reading multiple novels and was forever finding himself in need of bookmarkers.
at him wrong…it made Draco shiver just to think about. Harry really did think that Draco was worth defending. Harry had faced down his admirers for Draco, completely unafraid of them turning on the brunet.
"Can I sit with you?" Potter asked, running one finger down the length of Draco's arm.
Still looking at the floor, Vince nodded.
"Unless you changed your mind about the Ministry safe house?" Potter asked, touching Draco's bare forearm with the tips of his fingers. It wasn't until that moment that Draco realized he was not wearing a shirt, just black silk pyjama bottoms slung low on his narrow hips, the long hems pooled around his feet. He normally slept without a shirt and had been too panicked upon waking to remember to throw one on. A fierce blush threatened to stain his entire upper body, but he managed to somewhat tamp it down.
"Fucking good food," Seamus nodded. "Although I could've done without that hour-long speech Malfoy made at dinner about becoming reformed and listing all the war charities he's donated to and his hope that we might set aside the past in the face of a brighter future or whatever the fuck he was twaddling on about. You'd think he thought he was fucking McGonagall or something with the way he kept talking. Now
"Oh, hey, P," he greeted, violet hoop rising as the corners of his mouth tugged up into a smile.
Draco nodded hesitantly. "What are you…" the question trailed off into silence, both boys ignoring the continued whispers still hissing through the air all around them.
They sat in silence for what felt like an eternity.
"I had always suspected something like this…" she murmured, looking down and shuffling her notes. "But not so soon…not the
A scream of rage erupted from Wolf as he jumped to his feet, reaching into his back pocket for something, and Harry felt his heart stop cold at the quiet sound of a knife flicking open. Shit. Fuck. Harry didn't have any weapons on him! He still had his trainers on, he wasn't even wearing boots, for fuck's sake!
"Don't let your face freeze like that," Ginny said in amusement, and Harry turned the glare onto her. "I mean, I suppose it's not the
"Blaise is right," Pansy said in a bored voice, "it's either confront Potter or wait to be confronted by him. But either way, you may as well just get the confrontation out of the way now."
"I think you mean as free-spirited and unencumbered by the opinions of others," she said, eyes narrowed. "It's not my fault that you're such a fucking prude, you know."
I get garbage thrown at me on the streets. Nobody wants me around, you included. That's why you've been ignoring me all term, isn't it? Decided your life would be much better off if you simply pretended I didn't exist?" His tone was rancorous and biting. The truth was—a truth Draco had been trying desperately to deny to himself—Potter's refusal to even look his direction all year
"Yes," Hermione responded. "If this was a simple severing charm or a standard slicing spell, then everyone is still a suspect because everybody here knows the spells and are capable of casting them. But if it was a more powerful, lesser-known spell, it would help remove some of those names from the list."
this! I don't mean to be so insecure all the time, I don’t want to be, I swear! It's just that so many people want you and are constantly plotting to take you away from me and everybody is always just
"A special hero today, then," she said, refusing to take a hint. "Any idea how you'd like to celebrate?"
"Save your breath, Potter." The sneer was back. "You need not explain your relationship with your Weaselette to me."
"Please say something," Potter pleaded. "Actual words other than just 'oh'. Is any of that what you want too or should I just stop embarrassing myself now by saying things you don't want to hear?"
"Yes," Seek argued, "you can. You absolutely fucking can. You owe that place nothing; you owe those people
"But you can't." The dull resignation in Malfoy's voice made Harry's head snap up in worry. The three words had been uttered in such a flat, lifeless tone…a tone that Harry did not like. A tone that set him instantly on edge. "I understand, Harry." He offered Harry a blank, vacant smile, the kind one sees painted on cold glass dolls propped up on display, empty and fragile and wide-eyed, sending a shiver through Harry at the sight as Draco began to pick himself up off his knees. Harry climbed to his feet as well and they stared at one another for one hundred and thirty-seven hammering heartbeats; Harry counted every single one.
Draco was halfway back to the clubhouse when the front door creaked open, making him freeze in place. A dark figure slipped out, moving quietly, and Draco felt his heart rate triple. Was it a Death Eater? What would be his excuse for being outside? Would Fenrir be upset that Draco had left the bed?
"That's right," Caelix smiled wider. "Manliest man you've ever met, admit it. I outman half the male Aurors without even trying."
Harry opened his mouth to ask when he had ever sided with the Slytherins before two days ago, but Nott was speaking before he could.
"Fine with me," Zabini said, and Harry noticed that he seemed to relax slightly at Harry's words.
"He started it!" they both said simultaneously, slanting each other a reluctant grin.
Reaching his trunk, Draco filed through it for something to sleep in, finally finding a worn sleep shirt, one that fell nearly to his knees and was without a doubt the most comfortable thing that he owned. The struggle with his clothes took what felt to be hours, but finally he was squirming his arms through the holes of the shirt and tugging it down over his torso. Yawning, he pulled out a pair of pyjama bottoms for Potter, who caught them with a grin and pulled them on with almost as much as ease as Draco had—not—managed.
Following after the blond, Harry allowed the door to click shut behind himself, falling into step beside Malfoy, who slanted him a look out of the corner of his eye.
Draco did not hear from Potter for four days. Four days in which he passed the time by wandering through the large house with a bottle of firewhisky clutched in one hand, alternating between sobbing hysterically and screaming in fury at the empty air. Whisky was not his normal drink of choice, but he relished the burn as he gulped large swallows between tears, awaiting something he was not yet sure of. Was he waiting for Potter to return? Pansy to tumble through his Floo? Greg to arrive on his doorstep with a bag of sweets? Maybe it was Blaise he was really waiting for, to show up in something tight, speak in a low voice, fit himself snugly behind Draco's body, kiss his neck in the one spot that always made him moan. Draco was just not sure anymore—the world felt skewed. All he knew was that he was waiting for
"That's comforting," Parkinson said quietly, and Harry looked at her closely, noting that her face was pale and her fingers trembling.
"Tell me he's at least fit," Tracey joked sadly, biting her lip.
? Perfect, even? Had the potion somehow transported the real Malfoy somewhere else and replaced him with this new strange, flattering look-alike? One who knew how to do amazing things with his tongue and the skin of Harry's throat?
"Please, Draco," the brunet pleaded, feeling another crack splinter his heart, "please. Just listen, okay? Because I have something I need to explain to you and I need you to listen without interrupting."
"Well, that's good then," Draco said cautiously, still feeling self-conscious.
to fix this.
"Don' worry," Fenrir slurred, eyes bloodshot as they looked around the room, appearing unable to focus on anything for longer than a second. "Tha' missing ear'll be the least of that cunt's troubles. Those dumb fucks'll all be taken care of soon enough."
"Okay," Seek smiled, and in that moment, Draco believed that everything really would be all right.
"Well, well, Pansy," Blaise drawled, "do you think it took them two seconds or three to jump each other after we left the room?"
," Harry growled, shaking the other boy roughly, "
Malfoy said nothing for several moments. "To my knowledge, nothing like this has ever happened before. We've somehow been entirely cut off from the Floo network, which I can assure you was not my doing. And unfortunately, we cannot get reconnected without being able to contact the Ministry. And whilst the windows in the house are not able to be broken, they should be able to be opened from the inside, which now seems impossible, based on the countless windows we attempted to open last night. The doors have never locked like this—it's like something is holding them shut, but I have no idea what. And although Apparating in and out of this house is impossible for most people, I, at least, should be able to. But I can't, no matter how many times I try. I don't know what this is, Potter, I really don't. I don't have even the slightest idea of what's happening or who's behind it all. I don't have any idea why someone would even want to do this."
"Hermione!" Harry turned to her as she took a seat in the nearest armchair. "Ron's talking bollocks at me again! Give him one of your lectures on how wrong and unfunny slavery is!"
idea what it was like to hear from about a hundred different people that
The moment Harry felt Malfoy's grip slacken, he wrenched his arms free and shoved at Malfoy as hard as he could, sending him reeling back and nearly falling over, a nasty bruise already forming over one brow as he stared at Harry in shock.
"Incredibly," Harry chuckled, wrapping one arm around Draco's waist and using his other hand to tilt Draco's chin up for a kiss.
"Are you saying I was right earlier, with my questions?"
"Hey," Harry greeted softly as he entered the sitting room. "I thought I heard you Apparate in."
to come after you then, but she wouldn't let me just leave and so I told her it was over and she said something about not taking me back when I come to my senses but by then you were already in class and you've refused to even look in my direction so
A sudden knock on the door sounded, turning every heard sharply in the direction of the rapping.
"So now that that's decided," Malfoy said, eyeing Harry in a way that made him feel exposed, "what do we do now?"
Harry turned to stare at him, noting the pink flush in Malfoy's cheeks and the way he kept biting his lip nervously. "No," he said after several moments, relieved as his heart finally began to slow. "It's fine with me, Draco."
(See the end of the chapter for
Before the man had a chance to take a step forward, Harry was there, catching him up in a tight embrace.
That was the first thought that floated through Draco's dazed—well hardly dazed, more like
That was the thought that continued to pass through his mind in stomach-clenching echoes. He had failed—Daphne was dead. Ron sat next to him, nodding his head at every word Wescott was saying, but Harry was unable to focus. Everything sounded muffled, as though someone had stuffed cotton in his ears to block all sound.
They stared at her in stony silence.
"Can I request that everyone stop talking about it?" Weasley cut in, and everybody turned to him in surprise. Draco had forgotten the prat was even there.
"Just tell me everything that happened, yeah?" Cae sighed, speaking to the far wall. "I want to know what spells you used and what spells were actually successful. Ron already told me that neither the Floos nor his Patronus was working during the incident."
Reaching out with trembling fingers, he snatched the condom up off the bed and tore it open, glancing at Draco before rolling it on. One quick coating of lube later and he was back, leaning over Draco with a gaze like fire. He coaxed Draco's legs over his shoulders before reaching one hand down to help guide himself into Draco, and Draco heard his breath catch at the feel of a stiff prick prodding at his entrance. Seek shifted, adjusting his position before pushing forward, and Draco inhaled sharply at the feeling of being slowly filled. His body was still loose from their earlier shagging on the beach, but Seek took his time, rocking into him so gradually, almost as though he was afraid of breaking Draco. He pressed deeper, pushing closer into the blond, and Draco gasped, the sound swallowed by a kiss.
He shrugged, smiling even wider. "Feeling seduced yet?"
"Come on, Hermione," he said in a wheedling voice, "they're right, it's Friday. And our homework really is done."
split the still air, everybody jumped and five wands were immediately turned on Pibby, who was howling and wringing his hands in distress. "Master Draco! Help!" he cried, ignoring the wands pointed at him. "Fire, sir! Fire in the Manor! Master's home is being destroyed, sir! Please, sirs," the creature sobbed. "Too much fire! I is trying but I is failing all alone! Quickly, sirs!" As he spoke he stumbled to where Draco stood between Harry and the wall. Grasping Draco's hand with both of his own much smaller ones, the elf began to tug on Malfoy in an attempt to pull him in the direction of the door.
to do to you," he growled, biting a bruising kiss into the skin below Potter's ear.
"We do what we were already doing," Hermione sighed, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. "We continue with the search. There's still the upper floor to check."
you were my best friend
—when Draco had asked him to leave; when Draco had cried. It left Harry with a dusty, bitter taste in his mouth. Even though he had certainly not planned anything or even truly been aware of his feelings, he had pressured Malfoy. He had done exactly what he had asked Caelix not to do to him yesterday. And then, like an idiot, he had asked Draco for a goodnight kiss. What had he been thinking?
"I really do like you, you know," he informed him quietly. "I swear this isn't some sort of joke."
Sensing the exhaustion rolling off the blond in tangible waves, Greg stretched. "You look tired," he commented, making Draco want to roll his eyes from the absolute truth of the statement. "I'll go, then, so you can sleep." He rose to his feet and paused to grin down at Draco. The flickering light from the fire cast his features at an odd angle, making the grin appear shadowed and stretched. It was a rather frightening effect, really, since Gregory's eyes were hooded in darkness and all Draco could see of him were gleaming teeth, making the smile appear menacing.
"We've been
Harry took a deep breath. "I'm going to go speak to Draco."
"Ever the hero, helping any in need of your services," Draco admired softly.
As his collection at school would begin to pile up, he would smuggle them home during holidays, shrunk and hidden in the false bottom of his trunk that he always kept them in. He would then hide them—still shrunk—in various locations around his room, never leaving them in one place for too long if he was at home. He wasn't sure what exactly his father would have done to him if he had ever found the book collection; Lucius had always tended to be rather unpredictable with his discipline.
"Yes," Draco scowled. "Exactly my point. I don't get E's, Potter. Not in Potions."
Glancing up, Hermione shot Harry an exasperated look before turning to Ron and sighing. "Oh, for god's sake," she muttered, swatting his arm sharply. "Ronald!"
"Hence why you never learned, then," Pansy shrugged. "But the point is, you lost, and I get the bed. Be sure to Transfigure yourself something comfortable, Blaise. Now come along, Granger," she said, climbing unsteadily to her feet and waiting for the other girl, "the bathroom is next door and since we're such bosomy friends, I already know how much you need a wee."
A Quidditch match. God, Harry hadn't been to a match in
Deciding on the former, he phoned Pansy first but got no response, the call going straight to voicemail. He dialed Tracey next and was relieved when she picked up after only two rings.
Both men stood silent and unmoving, listening hard for any sounds. "I don't hear any—" Neville began, only to be cut off by Harry.
One of Harry's shoulders raised in a shrug, mouth pulling down at the corners as he pondered how best to answer, finally deciding on a shortened, simplified version of the truth. "It's like I told him," Harry gestured lamely down to the Stunned boy lying unconscious and unarmed on the cold floor, "I knew whoever it was would be back. You know nothing can be kept a secret in this school and I knew that word would get around that you were in the Hospital Wing." He shrugged again. "So I waited."
Harry drags his too-long hair out of his eyes and casts his gaze upon the fruits of his labour. Rolls of parchment are stacked to Harry’s left, ready to be sent off to Blaise for processing. He’s listed everything he can about the case - the gruelling investigation that led him from Belgium to France, the spells and modifiers involved in locating the panic room, the precise methods used to open it. He has yet to start the report on the raid - the duel, the curse, the improbable Apparation.
‘Which is why
that Harry feels a lump grow in his throat and he dares to want more than he’s ever wanted.
Harry teased, and Draco laughed, and then swore, because his lip was bunged up pretty bad, actually.
‘We must ask that you cooperate,’ Smythe attempts, his voice sounding somewhat wobblier than before.
The first few weeks off the potions were the worst. Draco kept having awful night-terrors and high fevers as his body - his magic - tried to fight against his terror. Harry couldn’t bear to let Draco suffer on his own. He stayed over every night, pressing cold towels against Draco’s brow, and watching helplessly as his friend curled into a tiny, protective ball, whimpering and weeping, locked in the nightmare with no escape.
Smith was terrified of Harry once, when he was prone to magical explosions, but now he’s convinced the Anchors have diminished Harry’s power - just like everyone else thinks it has. They have no idea that Harry could reach out and rip Smith’s magical core out of his chest, if he wanted to - and god,
It’s just that, in the wizarding world, it is impossible to avoid the Chosen One. His face is plastered in all the magazines, his name sprawled over the newspapers. Clothing stores start stocking Muggle-inspired outfits because Trainee Auror Potter wears this combination to the pub with his friends. Boys grow their hair out shaggy and untamed, and get tattoos of those round-rimmed glasses and a cartoon impression of a lightning bolt. Phoenix patterns become all the rage on clothing. There are potions sold that claim to make your eyes turn that wildfire-green, if only for a few moments (though in fact, there is no potion in the world that could replicate the colour of Potter’s eyes).
They stand in companionable silence for a while, watching the stars. The moon reappears from behind a cloud bank, and it bathes the Forbidden Forest in a wash of silver.
Harry hasn’t really seen Neville in a while - the Hogwarts schedule and the Auror rota kept them in separate worlds, with the exception of the occasional gala or fundraiser. Neville usually turns up early, makes his rounds, and then disappears before Harry’s managed to say more than a few sentences to him.
‘I don’t know about that,’ Hermione frowns. She pockets Harry’s letter and folds her arms over her chest. ‘He hasn’t been returning my letters. Normally he’s really good about writing back.’
lunch,’ interjects Ron, snatching the tickets out of his niece’s hand. ‘I promised your parents I’d feed and water you properly.’
‘I cannot personally disclose the details of the Malfoy account to anyone other than Draco Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy,’ Acquafredda says in clipped, perfect English. ‘You must understand, Professor, that Master Draco has been particularly careful with his personal affairs since the release of Lucius Malfoy. However,’ says the lawyer, holding up a finger, ‘he
Harry mutters an obscenity around a mouthful of his very dry, very tasteless fried chicken.
‘Circe, Potter, don’t pass out on me,’ Prentis frowns, leaning over to peer into his face. ‘I’ve got some Pepper-Up left if you want any.’
The wind sounds like the crashing of waves as it sweeps through the treetops. Harry can feel the beginnings of an early autumn in the cold caress on his cheeks. It is a welcome relief after the oppressive heat of the summer. He rests his head against the cushioned back of the deck chair and exhales long and slow.
Harry lifts his head from the safe oblivion of his hands, pulls off his glasses and rubs the bridge of his nose. ‘I bet she’s happy about that,’ he sighs.
’ at the drop of a hat.
There are other spheres floating above them - all prior failed attempts at recreating the Lopez Panic Room - close to the high, arched ceiling of the laboratory. Harry’s hotel room became too cramped for three people to work comfortably in, so Blaise arranged this place for them through the Ministry. The laboratory is on the top floor of an old villa belonging to one of the professors who teaches part-time at Beauxbatons. The house is just outside the city - in what Harry would probably call a quaint country town - and just far away from other wizarding houses that Harry doesn’t have to deal with the white-noise-feedback of background spells.
He’s just about to sit down and tackle the next stack of papers when the door to his suite swings open. Pansy strides in, sporting extremely large sunglasses and an armful of what appears to be takeout.
(See the end of the chapter for
There is a loud clatter as Arthur drops his fork into his wine glass.
Harry slips off Prentis’s desk and heads back to his desk to clear up. He’s done his debrief with Robards, it’s the bloody weekend, and he’s told everyone to leave him the fuck alone unless it was an emergency and there were no other Aurors in the building. He’s going to have a nice weekend with Draco, DMLE be damned.
Harry turns to his ex-professor and scratches awkwardly at the base of his skull. ‘Spells don’t really take, sir,’ he explains. ‘But thanks for the offer.’
‘Fully clothed,’ Draco points out, sitting up slowly. ‘We must be grateful for small mercies, Harry.’
Harry arches an eyebrow. ‘I teach Defence,’ he replies blandly. ‘It would be remiss of me not to provide the children with any practical experience. And I would hardly rate a childish hex as
‘When I first saw Harry,’ he says, clutching at his jug-sized serving of beer, ‘he was only a tiny little thing. I knew then that he needed a lot of love to grow big and strong, so I did my very best to love him as much as I could. And though Harry’s still just a wee thing -’
‘This is from-’
Potter has nearly no table manners. He leans his elbows on the table, tears apart chapati with his fingertips and licks curry off the back of his hand. It is infuriating how much Draco wants him.
‘Oh, shove off,
can’t it be this combination of spells?’ He jabs his finger in the general direction of the glowing sphere in the middle of the room. ‘It’s what I would use.’
Harry doesn’t tell Malfoy about the other parts of his life that are in shambles.
‘Er,’ Harry says, scrunching up his forehead as he tries to match a face to the name.
Draco visits Harry every single time he ends up in St Mungo’s. He comes with flowers, a box of fancy chocolates, and a scathing remark.
An icy numbness washes over Harry’s face. ‘
His partner, Prentis, is a shrewd old thing, well-seasoned and always level-headed in a crisis, and Harry’s gotten rather fond of her, so he usually does a few stupid things to keep her out of harm’s way. Besides, he’s the best Auror on the force at wordless casting, and he’s already developed a few shortcuts for the more complex defensive spells. If he can cast faster than Prentis, why shouldn’t he move first?
‘Yeah, and I felt that,’ Harry replies. ‘But you’re… your magic is soothing. You’re like a meditation melody or something,’
A few couples are making their way onto the floor, falling into the first steps of what seems to be an incredibly difficult dance. Harry hasn’t even mastered the waltz, let alone whatever
‘I think-’ Draco breaks off, inhaling deeply and running his fingers through his hair. It looks feather-light, silk-soft. ‘I think it’s alright to acknowledge that they were deeply flawed people who hurt others, sometimes on purpose. I think they also tried to take care of us. But I won’t pretend that Severus’s behaviour towards his students was excusable, just because he was a war hero. And I don’t think you should forgive Dumbledore for what he did to you.’
Pansy is up against the garden wall, snogging Fleur’s little sister like her life depends on it.
Harry shakes his head, still feeling a bit lost. ‘Yes, but Ron’s not trying out for the Tornados, Gin.’
(It’s not invading, not really. Draco wants him here all the time. Harry is loud and boisterous and hilariously snarky, and he has amazing taste in music and is sinfully good at cooking. He is the lighthouse in the storm, the raft to which Draco clings desperately, but the last thing Draco wishes to be is a burden. He has burdened enough people in his lifetime.)
Draco has to close his eyes for a moment, and perhaps it is the lack of sleep or the sheer amount of stress that has been brutalising his system, but he is suddenly so bloody fucking
‘You’ve saved mine hundreds of times,’ Draco replies. He shifts further down the bed and lies down next to Harry. The light dips him in purest gold, lavishing its gifts on him with a love that feels as reckless as the love that burns in Harry’s chest. ‘Maybe more, I don’t know,’ Draco says. ‘I’ve stopped counting.’
Healer Thompson nods and taps her wand on the clipboard. A fine line appears between her eyebrows. ‘Will you have somewhere to stay while you’re in London?’ she asks, glancing up.
‘Fantastic!’ Singh grins, flashing all her straight, pearly teeth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Daphne tosses the envelope onto the bed. ‘Let me see your Anchors,’ she demands.
There is a moment that Draco clings onto, one that perhaps even Harry has forgotten about, and it is this:
‘I know,’ she says. ‘I know.’
Even after they release him from Azkaban and send him back to Malfoy Manor, Draco cannot bring himself to stomach food.
‘Male Weasley,’ she clarifies, jabbing a very pointy, very glossy fingernail in Ron’s direction. ‘Sorry I was a dick. The Weasley is Our King thing was very tacky. Also sorry for the general twattish behaviour and casual racism.’
Christmas holidays finally come around and instead of going to Brussels, they decide to stay in Scotland. Teddy helps them put up a tree in the living room and Victoire comes to spend a week with the three of them, armed with a basket of extremely tacky gifts. Teddy and Victoire share Harry’s guest room, which Draco is a bit suspicious about until Victoire calmly reassures him that,
The reverse-engineering hasn’t gone all too well. He’s thrown countless variations of protective spells together onto his model - the glowing orb that Ron is gawping at - that he knows will reproduce the effects in the manual, but none of them
Harry wanders back into the living room, casting his gaze around the apartment once more. Everything is orderly, but not in the way that a home looks when the owner is on vacation. It’s like Draco just vanished into thin air.
‘I am afraid this is a Slytherin’s work,’ Draco replies, offering one last smile over his shoulder. He gestures at Blaise - a subtle flick of his fingers - and nods towards the hallway outside the dining room.  ‘Come, Blaise. Let’s talk.’
Draco turns his gaze upon Daphne, annoyance flitting over his face. ‘I thought I told you not to do that shit.’
that is an ocean away.
He asks Andromeda when he visits. Teddy is old enough to sit up now, and he grabs fistfuls of Harry’s hair and tries to eat Harry’s sweater as Harry tries to focus on their conversation. Andromeda tells Harry that Narcissa’s moved to France and they’ve sold the Manor - apparently Narcissa wants nothing to do with her husband’s name or assets anymore. Malfoy, however, is still under parole, and cannot travel or use magic until his sentence is done.
‘You’re sure you’re up for this?’ Blaise asks, his voice lowered as he squints at the bottle of wine in his hand. ‘That’s some complicated enchantment you boys cooked up. It’s not going to be an easy one to cast.’
‘Do we- what do we-’ Harry breaks off, his voice choked by the shape of his heart hammering in his throat. ‘Draco, what are you saying?’
‘I could have a go at it, if you like,’ Neville says as they take their seats at the High Table.
Hermione’s eyes flick back and forth as she scans the document at an alarming pace. Her lips grow thinner and thinner, her expression pinched, which can only mean that everything is in order.
‘Hi, Hermione,’ Harry smiles, looking up from his packing. ‘Come straight from work?’
Harry feels his eyes prickle with tears he can’t afford to shed. He pulls Draco’s hand into his lap and covers it with his other hand. ‘Hold on to me,’ he says, ‘and I’ll hold on to you.’
Lucius looks up in surprise, his wand jerking up to point at Harry’s chest. His mouth opens and a curse comes flying out of the tip of his wand, straight towards Harry, but Harry’s always been faster than his opponents. He eviscerates Lucius’s clumsy spellwork with a dismissive flick of his wand. With the next sweep of Harry’s wand, Lucius’s wand comes flying out of his hand and snapping into Harry’s outstretched palm. Behind him, Blaise’s voice murmurs out an incantation as he casts a protective shield over Narcissa.
‘I give up,’ he says, barely above a whisper. ‘I can’t do this anymore. If they want me gone, then I’m gone.’
In truth, Harry has always been a bit terrified of what a pureblood witch like Narcissa might do with a wizarding apartment, whether it would end up looking as cold and grim as Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place. In a way, he’s always seen her the way he first saw her, when she appeared at Lucius’ side - tall, foreboding, silent, beautiful in a way that belongs in a museum, locked away behind the glass. Now, she looks softer somehow, framed by the bright summer sun filtering in through the living room.
‘Huh,’ he says.
Harry comes to stand beside him in front of the mirror. He slips his arms around Draco’s middle, managing not to wince at how desperately thin Draco still is, and presses a kiss into the bare patch of skin behind Draco’s ear.
Sirius’s love is a dark sun. Its heat still burns in his letters, long after he is gone.
Harry bites his lip and scuffs his shoe against the pavement. ‘He had his reasons.’
Harry feels a flash of guilt. ‘Nev,’ he groans, ‘you’re already so busy-’
‘Oh, yes,
Harry nods his consent.
There is a parliament of owls waiting beyond the wards of Grimmauld Place. Harry can feel the impatient crackle of the Floo about to flare to life. The world will descend upon them with all of its chaos soon enough - but for now all Harry wants to do is lie here in the sweet pool of Draco’s magic and know that this delight of a man has moved heaven and earth for him - to know that he is so loved.
He knows how people can transform and grow and shed the shackles that were forced upon them by poor upbringing, just like how Dudley isn’t even recognizable anymore because these days he laughs with his stomach and he has two foster children whom he loves deeply, and he sends Harry artisanal cheeses every fucking month with handwritten reviews in his atrocious spelling, and sometimes he even invites Harry to join the musicals he helps direct down at the LGBT centre even though they both know Harry can’t carry a tune to save his life.
‘How long were you keeping that hidden?’ Pansy asks softly.
‘Yes, exactly,’ Blaise says. ‘For the past few years, we haven’t really been concerned with their efforts, since they’ve been pretty consistent at blowing up each attempt. But then last month a modified Time-Turner went missing from the Department of Mysteries. It isn’t functional, of course - hasn’t been since the attack of ‘96 when you and your friends wrecked the Time Room.’
‘I want to keep looking,’ Harry tells Prentis.
From across the table, George winks at Harry and flashes him a thumbs-up. ‘You heard her, Harry,’ he grins. ‘No winter weddings.’
‘What?’ Blaise frowns. ‘Potter, I have not had my morning coffee - make an attempt at coherency,
Harry opens his mouth to protest and Ron throws him a look so thunderous that Harry quickly thinks better of it. He drops into the nearest chair, pulls off his glasses and rubs at the bridge of his nose. His eyes feel red-hot in his sockets, and a nasty migraine is threatening to split his skull open. He’s been exhausted for days but now it’s getting to the point where it feels like his muscles are woven from lead.
They had a favourite place - a small, charming Italian restaurant - that they would go to after a long day wandering up and down streets and dropping into bookshops and cafes and galleries. There’s some irony in having Italian food in Paris, but it really was the best place to sit and watch the world go by - with large, curved windows that would open in the summer, so Draco could smoke without having to sit outside. They also had really, really good coffee.
Blaise blinks slowly and scribbles something in his notebook. ‘That was probably the best course of action,’ he says, his gaze dropping to the sprawling marks of his handwriting. He lifts his eyes to meet Draco’s. ‘But do you think that you could have done what he asked? Could you have modified the Time-Turner to turn back decades?’
‘Let’s get some lovely tea on first,’ she says, rubbing Hermione’s arms comfortingly. ‘Yeah? Let’s do that.’
‘Harry,’ he whispers. ‘You came.’
She covers Harry’s hands with her own, squeezing over his scarred knuckles, over the harsh, white letters carved into his skin. There are scars on his wrists too, and more tracking up his arms beneath the sleeves of his shirt. There’s a reason Harry left the Aurors behind - ten years’ worth of reasons. She and Ron saw the worst parts of it, the drunken nights and the string of nameless lovers, the horrific injuries that only got worse after Ron left the Aurors and there was nobody left to watch his back.
There are a hundred thousand reasons, and Harry doesn’t know where to begin.
He smiles at Harry like they’re sharing the most delicious inside joke, and Harry tries not to roll his eyes. Last week Draco went with Harry all the way to Germany to watch Ginny’s match, even though it rained
He comes to stand in front of Draco, bracing his hands against the counter so that he can lean forwards and kiss Draco on the cheek. Draco smiles, bringing his hand up to toy with the tassels of Harry’s hoodie, his gaze fastened on that small patch of skin beneath Harry’s neck, just above the curve of his collar.
‘You helped me already, Pansy,’ he tells her, as sincere as he knows how to be. ‘More than you know. More than you’ll ever know.’
‘You have shit timing, mate,’ he says, looking up at George. ‘Fucking
‘What the hell, Harry?’ Ron frowns. He prods at the glowing orb with his wand and watches the golden runes shift and slide out of the way. ‘This looks complex.’
‘Right,’ says Neville, slapping his palms on his thighs. He stands up, straightening his jacket. ‘I’ve got to go pick up Ginny. She’s back today from Greenland - reckon she’ll need a hot pasty and a big hug. Harpies lost by three hundred points.’
Malfoy lowers his gaze to his hands and stares at them like they aren’t part of his body. ‘Side effects of prolonged exposure to the Cruciatus Curse,’ he says. ‘You’d know that, Potter, if you ever bothered to open a book.’
‘I am
He swaps the cards, so that the two of spades is on the bottom, and the ace of hearts sits on top.
(In an attempt to repay Daphne for her unflinching kindness, Draco once visited Astoria’s sickbed with a box of chocolate eclairs wrapped in white ribbon. She was so small, a sliver of the moon about to disappear in the night sky, her soul fastened to life by a fragile thread, but she was so gentle when she took her big sister’s hand and whispered,
‘What the bloody hell does that
He’s always known they would come.
(Hermione’s face appearing in Draco’s fireplace in the middle of the night, tears sizzling as they fall onto the coals beneath
‘We’ll fix this,’ Harry promises, half to himself, half to Draco. ‘We’ll make everything alright.’
‘There are three snakes in total,’ Luna tells him. ‘Oh. My mistake. There’s the fourth.’
‘Teddy,’ Harry greets with a smile. He slides out of bed, straightening his wrinkled clothing.
Harry never forgot those words, uttered in regret and longing -
A white peacock-feather quill lies next to the letter, alongside an ink blotter, all laid out in preparation for the completion of the letter.
I always spend longer writing these than I expect and it has been the busiest, crummiest month for a variety of reasons. Thanks for bearing with my haphazard uploading schedule.
Draco is out of his seat before Harry can even move to help him, hurrying across the space and gathering up his best friend into a tight hug. ‘Hush, darling,’ he murmurs. ‘It’s alright. I’m here, see? I’m fine. Everything’s fine now.’
actually work in your favour. In the meantime, though,’ he adds, tilting his head slightly, ‘you just get really good at writing letters. Though as far as I can tell, you two have that down to an art form, so you really shouldn’t be worried.’
is how she approaches conflict resolution.’
‘Merlin,’ Harry utters, mortified. ‘
Malfoy taps his fingers on his mug. He picks up his spoon and scoops up a bit of whipped cream and half-melted marshmallow. ‘I think it does,’ he says to the spoon. ‘Some days are just… grey. Heavy. But other days I feel almost human,’ he adds, looking back up at Harry, ‘and I can enjoy a latte in a mediocre cafe and I’m mostly grateful that I’m alive to revel in the mundanity of it all.’
The man snorted, an angry, derisive sound. "You don't even know why the clubs are meeting up, do you?"
"Not in the corridor, Harry," Draco groaned, feeling Harry chuckle against the skin of his throat as he spread kisses down to his collarbone.
Heart hammering, Harry pushed at Malfoy, managing to force him back a couple of steps. Draco met his gaze with a terrifying, almost hollow-eyed sort of determination, reminding Harry of one of those colorful wind-up toys Dudley had played with as a young child, the kind with bright colors and wide eyes that had always scared Harry for some reason when he had looked at them. The colors had always been too bright and the eyes had always seemed too wide and almost terrified, in a way, the painted faces set in a frozen mask of false amusement, unable to do anything but repeat the same mechanical motions the toy was built to do as another person wound and rewound it, controlling everything it did like a mechanical puppet—Draco had become Harry's own mechanical puppet, only Harry had never been the one to first tie the strings to the blond; he had never been in control of the puppet that had somehow become tethered to him.
"People have called my hair a lot of things, but never pretty," Potter said, the smile on his face turning into a grin.
"How kind of you, Potter, thank you," Blaise deadpanned.
"Goodnight, Harry," is his mumbled reply.
Face burning red, Harry turned and hastily made his way back to the Gryffindor table, where he found his potion a sickly green and crackling alarmingly. Stepping back to his station, he quickly scanned the instructions before dropping two horse hairs into it and stirring seventeen times. It hissed and turned a delicate orange, which was pretty, but far from the cerulean color that Hermione's was.
"Well," Ron said uncertainly, sounding surprised. "I told you lot that he was the most unstable one here."
Squaring his shoulders, he thanked Ron and Hermione before marching resolutely to the dungeons, all earlier exhaustion forgotten.
"Well," Hermione said slowly, pausing to scribble something down in her notepad. "That's the thing, Zacharias. We're not entirely sure you
he actually love Draco?
"So," Ron said finally, breaking the quiet, "how did you sleep last night, Harry?" His lips were twitching as Harry's head snapped up, feeling his face flush.
before
Blaise's mouth dropped open, appearing just as offended as Draco had been hoping for.
"Why was there a silencing ward placed on this room?" The question earned several looks of confusion. "We knocked twice and asked you to unlock the door," she explained, tucking a curl behind one ear and settling her weight on her back foot as she surveyed the four men. "But when none of you responded the second time, it struck me that you couldn't hear us. We could hear you, but you couldn't hear us, which is not the easiest of spells to cast. The magical locks placed on the door were actually easier to dismantle than the silencing ward. Who cast it?"
Moments later, he heard the squelching sound of footsteps running toward him in the rain. Two young Aurors were sprinting over, one whose name Harry knew was Pickering and the other he thought might be Scrivens. As they approached, Harry saw their eyes widen as they took in the sight of Crabbe, face red and tear-streaked, eyes still clenched shut in pain as he continued to howl and stamp his feet.
"All right," Hermione said in the same soft voice she had been speaking in. "But Ron and Neville and I will choose a room nearby, just in case."
"Does it really help?" Harry asked skeptically, eyeing Draco in disbelief.
"No, Draco," Harry's voice whipped out low and fierce. "Not a single word of that is true, don't even say it! You are the

"This feels nice," Draco admitted, smiling to himself when Seek's hold tightened.
All four men turned to stare at him. "Right, Greg, sorry," Draco broke the silence. "Come along and I'll explain. Potter," he sneered, "can continue with whatever other asinine procedures he has constructed to waste time." And not caring who was following him, Draco set a quick stride down the long corridor. Within seconds Gregory had caught up but turned to stare in surprise when Draco marched past the large doors that the other man had paused at, continuing the steady pace forward instead.
Draco growled and yanked Harry down to him, catching his lips in a forceful kiss. Any need for oxygen was quickly forgotten as they clutched at one another, one of Malfoy's pale hands twisted gently in Harry's hair as the other gripped his shirt collar, until they were both dizzy and panting.
Draco's voice was suddenly reverberating through Harry's stunned mind, the statement ricocheting around his skull in clamoring echoes until he was feeling nearly dizzy from the force of it. Maybe Harry had wanted to know that Draco trusted him so badly that he had overlooked the real reasons behind Draco's fear.
"Is that what inspires all his friendships then?" Draco asked sympathetically. "Pity? Because that is certainly understandable for at least one person sat here. But then, I'm sure that person is quite used to pity at this point in his life. Lord knows his life is pathetic enough to warrant more than an individual's fair share of pity."
"They just had a couple drinks together," Dean shrugged. "Weren't here for very long."
Malfoy's body twitched in the direction of the closed doorway, as though he meant to stride from the room, and the fear of him leaving like that made Harry snatch at his wrist, intent on assuring him that that would never happen.
better than whatever rodent-like creatures the two idiots kept comparing him to.
"We have pyjama bottoms on, you git!" Draco snapped, trying to ignore the pounding in his skull. "Why the fuck are you so goddamn chipper, you evil soulless wank-faced spawn of Satan?"
"I hate flamingos," he muttered beneath his breath.
Blaise laughed even harder. "There's really no other explanation, Draco. Potter either wants to kill you or he wants to fuck you. Possibly even both, who knows. Maybe he wants to kill you and fuck you at the same time."
"It was clearly the Slytherins! Every time they disappear somewhere together, somebody ends up dead! The only reason nobody died last night was because Potter was awake all night making sure none of them moved! But the second he turns his back, they're at it again! Why do you keep blaming everybody but them?!" Everybody turned to Harry to await his answer.
Where was his ring? Oh god, he had no idea! Had he left it at Seek's? He had taken it off days ago and completely forgotten—where was it?
"Boyfriend?" Draco's forehead crinkled in confusion. "You mean Pansy?"
"More like incorrectly inferred in everything you hear."
Malfoy smirked. "I suppose I've suffered through worse than your company."
At the thought of Potter, the blond was reminded of the prat's impending visit. Gulping the rest of his tea, he rose from his chair and began shedding clothes, tossing them haphazardly on his way to the bathroom. A long hot shower was what he needed, and then he would deal with Potter.
"What did he tell you about Justin?"
"No, it can't," Harry replied morosely, wishing more than anything that he could be the one to be there for Draco. But that possibility was no longer an option, now, was it? Draco had seen to that. Even if he hadn't gone to Wisp out of spite over Harry's uselessness, even if he hadn't thought of it as lying to Harry, that didn't change anything. In fact, it nearly made it worse, in Harry's view—worse that Draco could do something like that without once thinking that it might be a problem.
The other three stared at him.
"Okay," Draco said hesitantly, tucking his phone away and climbing to his feet. Before he could walk away, however, Harry reached out and caught him around the waist, tugging him close to plant several kisses along the back of his bare shoulder. Harry didn't think he would ever get over the way Draco's skin felt beneath his lips.
"So says the girl in the sexy fishnets," Pansy said, reaching under the table, and Draco ducked his head just enough to watch her run her fingers lightly over Tracey's stockinged thigh. He wondered when they would finally realize they were fooling no one and just fuck each other already.
. That couldn't happen. They couldn't do that. If anything happened to Seek…Draco didn't even want to think about it. He couldn't even think about it. He could not consider the possibility of Seek being injured, let alone—no, he couldn't even think the word. Nothing would happen to Seek. He would not allow anything to happen to Seek. Draco would warn him. As soon as he could sneak away, he would call Seek and warn him.
"You mean that hideous snake thing?" Harry nodded and Caelix looked thoughtful. "You know, I'm not sure how that spell was cast. It was like a modified Dark Mark, wasn't it?"
, and certainly not a cute one! Prats were
To summarize—rejection turned into loneliness, loneliness became hurt, hurt generated anger, anger beget rage, rage engendered hatred, hatred grew into retribution, and retribution gave way to murder. And that is the Cycle of Daphne! Hence the psycho crazy that is her :)
Draco recognized the feeling. The air felt the same as it had the day of Daphne's murder, when Dark magic had spread through the Manor like cancerous smoke, affecting everything it touched with arid fingers made of Darkness and fire.
"Maybe he was worried Justin would talk."
to object to Harry being involved with someone else?
Draco appeared confused by the request. "What?"
"Yes," Malfoy said dryly, "emphasis on

Accepting it with a nod, Hermione cast a quick
Casting a quick Tempus and noting the time, he shook his head regretfully. "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't have time at the moment." And he found that he really was sorry. However unexpected, he enjoyed the girl's strange presence.
"No," she said kindly, offering him a sad smile. "I think it would be best for you to get some sleep in your own bed. And I also think it best that he be given some time alone when he wakes up to process what happened."
"I already told you, you're a fool," Draco returned the smirk, "and fools are far too common, so I suppose you really are normal."
"Draco," he murmured, deciding the teasing and foreplay had gone on long enough.
As he had to do now.
"I'm fine," she said casually, waving one hand. "It's like I said, that little bitch couldn't hurt me if he tried."
"Another excellent point," Zabini said, mouth unmoving but eyes smiling. "I suppose you really are an honorary Slytherin after all, Potter, welcome to our little club."
"I still say you should care about my monetary security more," Blaise said crossly. "After all, we're best friends. You should be trying to help me get rich, not losing me money by shattering all stereotypical expectations I had placed upon you without your knowledge."
"Potter," Draco said in confusion, shooting nervous glances around himself. Harry had never approached him so openly in public before; what was going on?
Seek smiled softly down at him. "Neither was falling in love with you."
Not that Potter was his, or anything, of course.
"Yes, thank you," she smiled. "For the extra food you snuck down sometimes to Mr Ollivander and me."
Raising one eyebrow, Draco stared at him for a moment before pouncing, rolling Harry onto his back and smiling dangerously before claiming Harry's mouth in a kiss.
"If I fucking have to," Potter folded his arms, looking serious, and Draco felt a twinge of annoyance.
At the question, Harry finally recognized the voice and they both immediately backed down, Neville cancelling the shield charm as Malfoy stepped forward, glaring.
Blaise grinned widely. "You're the only one coming on him, Potter, don't you worry."
"Were the eggs not good?"
"It's not your fault, Harry," Hermione whispered, hugging him again. "I know that everything hurts now and it all seems so awful and hopeless, but things will get better again, I promise. Everything will sort itself out, you'll see. Just keep telling yourself that you were as much an innocent victim in this as Malfoy was; neither of you is to blame for any of it. Neither of you is at fault."
Harry grinned up at him, climbing back up Draco's body to claim his mouth in a kiss. Tasting himself on Potter's tongue made the blood rush harder through his veins, and Draco wrapped himself fully around the boy in his arms, heart feeling like it might just burst from the amount of affection he felt for the brunet.
Draco bit his lip, nodding down to the ground.
"It's different now," Harry said softly, sure that Ron was thinking of his only trip to the house when they had been seventeen. Harry had been worried as well the first time he had appeared before the intimidating main gate, certain that he would hear Hermione's screams echoing from the walls, or see the specter of Voldemort lurking deep within every shadow. But the house had not reminded him of that time at all, so full of fear and danger. The Manor no longer represented those things.
"This is bad," Hermione shook her head. "This is not going to end well if both sides are so openly trading threats."
, eh?" he asked incredulously. "I didn't know it was first names with you two." Harry blushed but before he could respond, Ron continued, "And you ate breakfast together, in the

As we rotate, I see Chang out of the corner of my eye, watching us impassively, and cannot resist the urge to send a large, smug smirk her direction. Harry chuckles and pinches me sharply.
Everything would be fine once he was with Seek. Seek would make him smile and laugh—he would hug him and make him feel safe.
"Exactly," Draco agreed with a solemn nod. "I'm glad we are in agreement." He was glad that he and Potter were on the same page regarding Draco's superior level of maturity. He was his very own level of maturity—he was Malfoy-level maturity, which was undoubtedly the highest level of maturity one could reach, and it was about damn time that Harry Potter acknowledged that.
Turning to Anthony, she buried her face in his chest, weeping softly. Parvati stared at her sister, tears streaming down her own cheeks as she laid one hand against Padma's arm. Anthony wrapped his other arm around Padma, stroking her dark hair as his own eyes filled with tears. Michael Corner sank down onto the floor near the wall, face blank as he gazed at nothing.
"Fuck, Pansy, I should have been there," he swore.
that nothing happened between me and Oliver Wood!"
"Okay," she breathed, squeezing him once more before letting go and stepping back. "Good night then. And thanks, Draco."
"Hey, I only think about sex with
," Harry groaned, kissing Malfoy fiercely, "who the hell taught you how to talk like that?"
"Let's see what the couple in love looks like, shall we? Are there any photos of you kissing?" His voice had taken on its old cold, sneering timbre, but Harry could hear panic lacing the words, the angry questions threaded with fear. "Or are they mostly just of you two holding hands and gazing adoringly at one another?"
Ron's eyebrows shot up. "Mate, you accepted a crazy expensive gift like this from another bloke right in front of your boyfriend?" Ron shook his head. "Where's Hermione and her lectures on tact when you need 'em?"
"I mean, I know what that's like," Harry continued, wanting to stop talking but somehow finding himself unable to prevent the words from spilling from his mouth, "being the third wheel and everything."
"I have it," Draco said, crossing to his wardrobe to pull out the jug of pumpkin juice that he and Blaise had gotten during their last free period of the day. It was charmed to stay cold, the jug feeling like ice beneath his fingers. Blaise was already pulling out the goblets they had knicked from the Great Hall the last time they had gotten pissed, setting them down on the floor and gesturing for Draco to pour out the juice.
Pansy gave him a flat look. "Yes, for some reason, that didn't exactly make me the most popular person in the nation. I personally thought it was a brilliantly simple plan for saving all our lives, but other people just did not seem to be able to see my point of view on its utter simplicity and obvious brilliance."
"As I said," Draco said distractedly, staring at Harry's smiling mouth, "we've always been hilarious. You've just never been able to appreciate it."
"I meant," Draco huffed, "are you forgetting
"Exactly!" Harry agreed vehemently. "Tell that to the universe! It's bloody out of touch with itself!"
"Oh," Draco breathed, unsure how to respond. He wasn't even sure how he was feeling. Did Potter really mean that? Did he really want to keep seeing Draco? Did he really want to publicly date Draco? Was he really not embarrassed or ashamed or disgusted or
Red-faced and grinning, Harry trailed one hand along Draco's waist, feeling embarrassment and satisfaction settle in equal parts within him.
"I never said that!"
with a broomstick that beautiful.
"Eh, all right then," Ron chuckled, "maybe not take over. But I do know that you want to go into some sort of career where you spend all your time standing up for those who can't stand for themselves and righting wrongs and changing archaic laws and fighting injustices all day and all that selfless sort of rot."
The questions felt morbid to Draco and he knew that he did not want his mind to continue down that particular line of thinking, attempting to instead distract himself by taking a large gulp of tea and staring around the gardens with a closer eye. The sight and sounds of Draco's familiar surroundings felt comforting to him as he sat by himself in the warm autumn sun, gazing around at the grounds he had known since childhood as he waited for Potter to join him. Harry had certainly been right about the grounds, even wildly overgrown and in desperate need of care, the gardens really were beautiful, spreading out in multicolored meadows of various flowers. African lilies stood in proud bunches amongst rows of different-colored carnations, the flower beds spilling with all different sorts of blossoms—violet bellflowers, blue foxgloves, white gillyflowers, large pillowy lilacs, purple stalks of lavender, bright yellow and white daisies, entire rainbows of tulips, as well as every color of Daffodil imaginable, Draco's favorite. The flower never failed to remind him of his mother.
him to house three old schoolmates—none of whom he had gotten along with in the past—before they just moved right in.
"Then why?" Draco tried to mask the hurt in his voice, he really did. But the two syllables he had uttered had been dripping with confused pain and the bruising hold on his arms was loosened considerably. Assuming that Potter had recognized the pathetic emotions behind his words, he closed his eyes and waited for the other boy to leave, run away, possibly straight to McGonagall to have him expelled so that he was no longer forced to even reside in the same building as the blond.
Striding quickly to the blond, Harry grasped his upper arms in a grip tight enough to bruise. "Draco! Please! Is there any other way out?"
As Harry was leaving, Neville followed him out into the hallway. "How are Malfoy and Greengrass doing?" he asked quietly.
Turning his head suddenly, Draco caught Potter's lips with his own, reaching up to tangle one hand in the man's black hair to hold his head firmly in place as he kissed the brunet with a savage passion. Draco dragged the hand still caressing Harry's chest down his perfectly flat stomach and farther, cupping him through his jeans. A triumphant smile slipped across his face at Potter's reaction; at the firm touch, the man released a startled gasp that melted into a drawn-out groan, the sound igniting Draco's blood within his veins and sending it racing through his flushed body. Squeezing the thick bulge in his hand and earning another low groan, Draco shifted against the man held so tightly in his iron embrace, sliding both hands to Harry's waist in order to grip tightly and press his own groin more firmly against him.
