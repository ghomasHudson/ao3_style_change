Trusting him was hard to do. Everything about him shocked me, finding out he led a huge company was just the tip of the iceberg of what I didn't know about him. I could only imagine the hidden life he lived went far deeper than what I assumed, especially considering how at ease he seemed to be getting arrested. They didn't even bother restraining him as if just knowing he wasn't going to try to run or anything.
"I don't suppose you could wait an hour or so?" Severus said lazily not getting up to greet them.
"Well then. She seems to have made up her mind. Teacher's Assistant it is." The Headmaster said clearing his throat giving me a look of happy shock and motioned for me to go to the head table.
It was nothing like Snape. It was cold and unyielding. He was harsh and I had never been more disgusted in my life, even when Ron had kissed me.
I stayed still.
Happy today?
"You have done well bringing the Granger girl to me. I was hoping Lucius would take the hints and bring her, but I anticipated it being harder than it was. He said she was in your office when he arrived." He said surprising me in more than one way. He had planned her being kidnapped? It was a setup?
“Ron, that’s fine. No hard feelings, I have to go.” I said trying to push around him to figure out what Snape wanted. Ron grabbed me and swung me around and into his arms, his lips locking with mine in a kiss.
I turned the page in the old dusty tomb I was reading on old spells that were good for combat type situation. Everything I was reading assumed you were in one on one combat though. A fallacy of magic I supposed the death eaters took advantage of. They never worked alone.
I thought I had gotten off easy, but when it came time to put our potion sample on his desk he looked up from the work he was marking, his anger still radiating from him.
"The ring." I said feeling my chest noticing its absence. He pulled out the ring from his pocket taking it off the chain.
Snape was glaring down at me, his mood dark and I knew he was pissed I was avoiding him.
“You can’t kill me! You need me. You know what I bring to you is invaluable. Isn’t that just irony? All this time I thought YOU were in control. Yet here I was…wow. How the tables have turned.” I said with delight at the power I had over him. He stood up towering over me. The crucio curse hit me before I could prepare myself.
“Wonderful. As if Potter didn’t do enough to try to get me killed already. Fucking idiot.” He muttered his sour mood returning thinking of the danger their relationship put him in. I couldn’t deny he was right. One whispered to Voldemort and Draco would be dragged down to be killed, or worse, used as a pawn to kill Harry.
"She's underage Severus." She said more quietly now unable to deny my statement.
“I take it you were with Voldemort?” He asked sympathetically having noticed my shaking from the crucio curse after effects.
“Be that as it may, I think maintaining your control is important. Using magic while angry can have devastating consequences for all involved. Controlling your magic is very important.” He advised me sagely. It took me a second to catch up to him.
"Then there will be a fight! We are not letting you take them!" Tonks said full of attitude and about to curse him, but I stopped her.
A blinding white light was the last I remembered before total blackness.
“I don’t know what game your playing at, but I would be careful who you talk to like that. You want dark? I can show you fucking dark.” He whispered harshly, his anger tangible in the small book store. His dark eyes flashed dangerously and I knew I had crossed a line. I wanted to make another smart comeback, but my thoughts went into another direction entirely. I felt myself blush and I wriggled trying to escape his grasp.
Harry, Draco and I trudged down to care of magical creatures Monday early having woken up quite early unintentionally. I was extremely nervous about my meeting with Snape later today, but they seemed highly energy without any real reason.
I expected the holidays to go by slowly staying at the castle, but they flew by so rapidly I barely had time to catch my breath before school started back up. Mainly it was trying to find ways to destroy the diadem and pocket watch, but I also spent quite a bit of time just relaxing with Harry and Draco.
“Ah, so that’s why Potter keeps falling asleep in class.” He mused nodding appreciative of the ammo for the next lesson. I felt my annoyance getting stronger at his twisting of my words and the exhaustion from studying all night trying to learn enough to stay alive in this war started to eat at me.
His black eyes met with mine and I knew without a doubt it was him.
"I have to go to the loo." I said softly to Snape who was so busy talking to Lucius and Antonin that he didn't even notice me leaving.
He then put my clothes on for me, his movements confident, yet gentle. It was as if I were simply his doll he had finished using and wanted to put away. I wanted to cry. I wanted to yell at him and tell him how messed up this all was. I opened my mouth to yell, but he looked at me with a deathly silent warning glare daring me to make a sound.
“She’s a student. The headmaster…”
“To what do I owe this pleasure?” He asked me giving Fawks a note he had just finished writing with his quill.
It was only then that I remembered the hundreds of students and teachers watching in total and utter silence, their mouths quite wide open.
“Long day, I hope you're feeling better?” The Headmaster asked, eating his own food quite slowly with his one good hand.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. I just had to make sure. With your power, you would be unstoppable if you went dark." I explained hoping she would take it as a compliment. She didn't.
She didn’t respond back any words, but somehow I understood what pained her. Me. It was the strangest feeling of longing that I had ever felt before. I wanted to fix it for her, take away that feeling, but didn’t know how.
"I'm looking for something obviously. What are you doing?" I asked, falling into pace beside him yawning widely. I didn't even know what time it was.
“Hagrid I don’t think that’s…” No sooner had the bird landed in Dean’s hands, than the skies turned an angry dark black and the wind picked up almost knocking us over.
He sat up shakily and looked around at the fighting quite alive.
"Harry said Draco has been getting called away more and more lately. I think they're gearing up for something personally." She said quietly and more seriously.
"I barely talk to him really. I have other things to focus on." I said refusing to play the love sick helpless girl I knew he wanted me to play. He had promised the Dark Lord I would bond with him, but I made no such guarantees.
"I'm sorry it's just hard to trust you." I said realizing I had hurt his feelings.
Their value had to be more than 100,000 gallons, but where he got this money was a mystery. He certainly didn't earn it from teaching, that was for sure. Not to mention the manor was in the millions of gallons, it was expansive and well cared for in a way that put Malfoy manor to shame.
Abnormal intelligence
"AGH!" I was so bored and sleepy I had walked right around the corner and into someone knocking them over.
It was snowing fast and furious and I could barely see a foot in front of me in the darkness. I had no idea if she had gotten through the long walk from the gates or not to leave, or if she was lost somewhere here.
“True. Severus, your up.” He announced directing Snape to me like a prize up for the winning. I tried to scream out, but my voice was gone somehow even though I hadn’t screamed. Voldemort chuckled at me suddenly finding energy to protest.
“Of course. It's worth it.” I said with an air of triumph that only angered him more. Harry gave me a pitying look, but in a manner of minutes Snape and I were the only ones left in the room.
I couldn't give up on her. There had to be a way. I would do anything to wake her back up.
"Nonsense. I want to destroy it." I said having no interest in wearing a piece of Voldemort's soul. The very thought sent shivers up my spine. He relaxed a bit at this.
I drifted to sleep worrying about the future, soaking up his warmth and his magic around me.
"You figured out what the horcruxes are? The Headmaster has been struggling to figure it out for years. You truly are the brightest witch of your generation, aren't you?" He said, impressed zipping my dress back up a bit roughly not knowing what that did to me.
We got to the front doors and froze. There he was. Standing against the side of the front doors, shaking and pale as death. His eyes locked with mine and I felt my heart leap.
"Age freezing potions. Each potion only lasts thirty days but stops the aging process for that time. Each bottle costs five thousand gallons so it's just for the elite clientele or those wishing to spend just a little more time with their loved ones. Brewing the potion is finicky and its one of the few I brew myself personally." He explained. I could never imagine spending so much money on vanity.
Maybe it was the wine, or whatever it was spiked with, but I felt a sharp stab of guilt for having ignored him for weeks. He had opened up to me sharing a personal detail that he clearly hadn't shared with anyone else and I just walked away. I was horrid.
"Getting into trouble yourself eh? Better be careful Snape doesn't find out. He's quite possessive." Draco said amused. I scoffed at this almost walking into a statue in my sleepy state.
"He wasn't alone." I said harshly, but so quiet he was barely able to hear me. The burning anger I had for the man and every time he tortured me flooded back. The horrid things he stood for, and most importantly him taking Severus from me churned within. The magic from Severus had melded with mine and begged for release.
By the time I made it to the castle she had gained some of her color back and I could see the bruise from my hand quite nicely on her cheek.
"The plan? You intended to make me fall for you. I'm just one of your pawns aren't I? Forget the headmasters plans. You're the real game player here, aren't you?" I said horrified, taking a step back realizing I was being played. He was absolutely brilliant. I didn't even see it coming. The headmaster at least was obvious in his games.
"It's always been part of the plan. A final fuck you to the Dark Lord. Lately though the plan has taken on more meaning. I know how much he means to you." He said with a bit of a grin musing at how ironic it would be for the Dark Lord to be killed off by some kids and his most trusted servant. Irony was bright in this plan.
She was right.
"I suppose you're now her personal speaker are you? Since your busy helping her with hers, I assume your is perfect?" He paled a bit giving a shrug.
He pulled me towards him not concerned with someone seeing us with how dark it was and before I could stop him, kissed me in a way that made my heart soar.
"Quite alright." She mumbled more to herself than me as the students started to trickle in. I counted down the minuets until class was over making sure not to make eye contact with Ron at all. Harry, ever the sweetheart sat by me and drew funny cartoons of Ron flying off his chair and animating them to cheer me up, a tactic that actually worked slightly.
“What are you doing down here?” He seemed surprised to see me, but when I got down I noticed he was not alone. Lavender was at his feet reading a story to him from her gossip column.
"There are seven billion other people I would rather have dinner with than him. Trust me." I said shaking my head. He had a glimmer of a smile, but it was quickly gone and we walked rapidly down the hill.
“Lucius came to my rooms directly. Saw her. Got the idea to bring her. The Dark Lord has been bugging me to find a way to get to Potter. I’m in his good graces and she doesn’t die from Lucius at least.” I said emotionlessly.
“Somethings have to happen naturally.” He said cryptically watching me calmly.
He wanted me, that was for sure. It was like the line of decency had been crossed with such a force he couldn’t even see it anymore, or maybe didn’t care. I didn’t think the teenagers would be able to keep my attention now that I knew what experience looked and felt like. I had tasted the forbidden apple and I couldn’t forget it.
“Granger, the Doctor.” Snape teased, but without his usual anger.
The curse stopped just short of me and the dark energy I had taken from Snape seemed to recoil realizing its master was dieing.
“I know. He comes in often. He might be rude to everyone, but he doesn’t look at anyone else like that.” She said  with a wink giving me back my change. I left hurriedly not wanting to discuss his habits with a virtual stranger in public.
Was it possible my mind was changing about fighting for Dumbledore or the Dark Lord because my loyalty had shifted to Severus? It wasn't just logic, but a natural innate desire to protect him at all costs? I wondered if that was why he had lost his temper and transformed when he saw Lucius with me. The bonding clearly didn't work one way. He was completely out of his mind with anger at someone for touching me, but recalled back to me at my slightest wish.
The decorations donned every inch of the cold castle and the red and gold colors overwhelmed even a Gryffindor like me. I would have been fine with a bit of silver here and there, but the color scheme was two tone only.
I mulled over this idea and had to admit, it had merits. I was all for freedom, but he was right. It was one party system right now. There were no checks and balances and no way for it to remain incorruptible. I hated the idea of being a part of overthrowing an entire government, but in this case it was needed.
I didn't even realize I had spoken to Snape until he responded.
He was stunning.
"I'm not hungry." I said with a sigh pushing the plate away and pulling out my transfiguration book.
"Ah Severus! You have brought our guest." Voldemort said with a hidden drawing everyone's attention to me. Snapes arm was tight around me not letting me shy away from the attention, so I just leaned in closer to him.
I didn't know what to do with the diadem, Ginny wasn't here for the holidays thankfully but I knew she would have even less control than I had. I couldn't let her be around it, so it had to be destroyed within the next two weeks.
I slammed my fist into his face as hard as I could feeling a satisfying crack under my fist I was fairly sure I broke. He screamed like a girl and grabbed his nose that started bleeding profusely.
“Please kiss me.” I mumbled finding my voice unintentionally. I couldn’t even focus on the snickers from the audience at my request. The world melted around me as he kissed me taking my breath away quite literally.
I looked at the top section of the bookshelf realizing in my short stature I was missing out on a whole realm of books.
"Severus would be more appropriate." He reminded me gently, chuckling a bit darkly to himself.
“Not really. All the spells I know are targeted for just one person. I need something that would take out a whole group of people.” I said with a sigh getting up to go to our dormitory.
And I wanted more.
My reflexes were slowing down with blood loss, but I did my best to help everyone out. We were severely outnumbered though and the order members were quickly stunned or bound.
He said having the audacity to seem amused by the whole thing. I had no idea how easily he could put on an evil professor front. It made it even more so apparent how much of his personality was for show. I couldn't blame him since any wrong move would mean death, but it was difficult to digest anyhow.
"Will you forgive me? I miss my best friend." She begged me, grabbing my hand for emphasis, giving me a puppy dog pout. I smiled, sighing and closed the book.
I walked back to him and laid down nervously on the couch next to him. I wasn’t about to sleep in his bed without permission and the couch was more than large enough for us to share. I worried he would get mad, but he stirred slightly and pulled me up to him tightly, his arms winding around me perfectly.
"Some welcome. You invited me just to curse me?" I asked with amusement. He relaxed slightly, putting his wand away, but still seeming on edge.
"Ab intus interficere!" Voldemort yelled to kill me. I spun around and saw the green light fly towards me sharply, my fate accepted.
He was at first shocked, but then he returned the hug with a hum twirling me a bit with a smile.
“Practicing to become a death eater?” He asked with no small amount of anger. I was at least his same height for once on the stool for one of our arguments.
I didn't have the chance to stop and think, he kissed me deeply, drowning out my thoughts, overpowering any objection I would have come up with.
"That is the most intelligent thing I've ever heard a drunk person say." I admitted letting my hand grasp her waist to stabilize her so she wouldn't fall on me. Her smile was infectious.
He kissed me once more before stopping much to my dismay.
"He hates kids." I reminded her, sure that she was totally mental.
I stood in silence watching the panther for a moment taking it in. He was gorgeous, his fur was silky black and when he stepped over to me it was silent even with massive paws on the marble.
"Just what Granger? It's not like I risked my life every time I told him no when he wanted me to bring you. It's not like I have given up years of my life for ungrateful people like you. Yes, I did horrible things, but surely your not so stupid as to see WHY I did them." He said angrily, shoving me away when I tried to grab his arm. I didn't know what to say, but he stalked off before I could even formulate a coherent response.
“Why are you smiling you know it all? You want to be tortured until you're ready to beg for mercy? Do you get off on that?” I asked her, shoving her against the wall and pinning her there with one hand. Her eyes looked me up and down and hovered for just a split second on my mark and my silver chain curiously.
The next curse slashed across my arm and my body poured out.
She looked at me with the strangest look of confusion I had ever seen on her.
“Eh…I guess. Don’t go causing no trouble though.” Hagrid said rubbing his beard nervously before waving us off.
I was seven eating a small snack in a corner of my room trying to remain unnoticed. I had been starving and my mother had forgotten to feed me yet again so I had stolen the crackers.
Oh shit.
I was in a black box of nothingness totally separate from the world and pain around me. A fireplace appeared slowly in the center of the room and I felt heat. I had always loved fireplaces, ever since I was a kid. My parents fought all the time so I would sneak to my friends house and would roast marshmallows in their fireplace. The sound of the crackle from it lulled me into a peaceful state and I stared in it just watching it flare and flicker for an undetermined amount of time.
“Yes Professor.” I responded nervously suddenly feeling all eyes on me curious why he wanted my potion specifically. I was sure it was to taunt it and ridicule it even though I knew it would be passable.
“I think that’s enough.” He said with a chuckle backing up leaving me alone on the pedestal desiring him even more. It was only then that I remembered the audience.
The students had mainly gone home for the holidays, but my family was doing a mission in Uganda so I had nothing to do but stay here. Since becoming a witch we had slowly drifted apart as our worlds became less and less similar. They didn't want me to stay when they found out about Voldemort, but I knew I had to stay. This was the only place I felt at home. Not to mention, it would put them in danger for me to be with them. I could leave, but we would be found.
He couldn’t kill me. I was far too valuable. The realization that I had worried all this time about him killing me when I was far safer than I had realized came to me. I couldn’t help but laugh. I stood up laughing feeling triumphant even as his anger increased.
"Yourself."
He followed behind me quickly offering me a seat on his soft red sofa. He pulled up a kitchen chair so he was sitting directly across from me, sitting backwards on the chair and taking sips of my potion. His gaze was intense and I shifted uncomfortably.
"I didn't want Granger to ask about it. Some things are too personal for me to share my Lord." I explained changing a glance up at him. He was calmer for sure, and I thought I might have noticed a hint of regret. I was quickly feeling dizzy and I tried to raise my wand to heal myself, but the Dark Lord himself started the healing charm, quietly and thoughtfully.
"We should have Miss. Granger pulled out of classes. I think that would be the best thing at this point." The Headmaster said levelly as if this was an everyday decision. I snorted in humor at that.
My arm burned and I was called.
“I will meet you in your office in five.” He said waving the old man away after giving in. Once he left Snape looked at me for a long moment seeming to take in my disheveled appearance without emotion.
"Make your breakfast then get to class." He said backing up lost in his thoughts before turning to leave. I barely caught him before he got out of the office.
I hated potions with a vengeance that Harry and Ron would never understand. They assumed that just because I got good grades in the class that I loved it, but the way Professor Snape always made a point to make me miserable had rubbed me the wrong way for so many years I dreaded his class.
"So did you guys...you know...I've always wondered what he looks like under his robes. He clearly takes care of himself, you know?" She said grabbing some of my popcorn I had gotten from the kitchens since I missed lunch again and eating it loudly.
I'm so sorry Granger.
“Look, I have far more pressing things on my mind. If this is all you have, I’m leaving.” I said standing up and walking out.
"Hermione...Hermione! HERMIONE!" I yelled, becoming more and more panicked with every second. I could almost feel the seconds ticking by in my mind slowly passing, taking her life with it.
"Granger. You're drunk. Don't say such stupid things or you will find yourself in more trouble than you can get yourself out of." I warned her darkly, me control slipping more and more every second. I needed to get away from her, but she was right. I was drawn to her as if she were my magnet.
Relax Hermione. Nothing bad will happen.
“Severus, what are your thoughts?” Professor McGonagall asked with a huff after arguing with Pomona for a solid twenty minutes.
I couldn't understand how if Snape hated me, why did he take care in how he went about Voldemort's orders? Looking back he was clearly decisive about doing things his way.
“Thank you Minerva, if you don’t mind I would like to speak to Hermione alone.” He asked her kindly. She gave a flustered huff and gave me one last annoyed glance before leaving us alone.
"You idiotic filth! Now because of you my most trusted servant is dead! You disgusting trash!" He roared, shaking me violently. My anger couldn't not have been higher than at that very moment.
Snape pulled out a seat for me and I sat down nervously, happy when he sat right beside me.
"So has Snape said anything to you. I personally thought he would skin me alive." She said rummaging through my notes absently. My mind went back to us fucking.
He had never said anything nice. Ever.
"Your secrets are safe with me." He said confidently.
"Careful what you ask for Hermione. If we continue I might not be able to stop." He said with a dark grin, kissing me again deeper and more demanding pulling me to him giving no escape.
I was a nervous wrecking taking it to Snape and I had to take a deep breath before handing him the glass bottle. I knew he would hate it.  He was going publicly humiliate me, I was sure of it. He glanced up from his grading finally noticing me lingering and took the bottle. Without even checking to make sure it was decent, he opened the stopper and swallowed a large gulp. My hand shot to my mouth in shock.
"Turns out I was a Horcrux or something. Basically I had a piece of Voldemort's soul. Quite disgusting if you ask me. So he just killed his own soul. Quite ironic if you ask me." He said with a grin. I had never anticipated such a thing could be possible.
Empaths were forced to work for corrupt witches or wizards they bonded with and this is how the dark arts came to be." He finished reading the passage and looked at me ashen, his mind thinking the same thing as me.
“I like guys, thank you very much. At least that’s something we have in common Draco.” I retorted with a grin. Just then Ron came down the hill and he immediately glared at me then went to the other side of the grass area we held classes at with a few other lingering students.
“Crucio.” The slick words were followed by the most immeasurable pain I could have ever felt. My body writhed and I collapsed to the floor rolling up in a ball instinctively trying to fight the pain. I wouldn’t scream. Not for him. I wouldn’t give him the pleasure.
"She's normally very sweet, pregnancy makes her mental though." Severus said drinking the hot chocolate slowly, enjoying the warmth.
“A spell Snape has used a few times. I think it silences us to other people.” I said hoping I had cast it right. He only ever seemed to do wandless magic so it was hard to tell.
"Fine." I said unlocking the classroom and letting him come in. I grabbed some pain reliever and a blood replenishing potion and sat behind my desk sourly.
"Like what?" I said not moving from his lap even as he slowly dressed me again.
I put the necklace on, rubbing the ring gently able to feel his magic enveloped in the metal object. It was the only tangible thing that connected us which made it even more perfect. It was the most thoughtful present I had ever received and when I slept, the warm magic enveloped me keeping my dreams happy ones of him and I.
"I can do it as long as needed." I said firmly, refusing to admit how close I came to my own death today. The Dark Lord knew he needed me alive, but he was also exceptionally careless when angry and he was royally pissed today.
“Why?” He asked me not giving any indication if he thought it was a valid concern or not.
I jumped in helping Tonks with Greyback who was cursing her so rapidly he was quickly becoming overwhelmed. I cursed him from behind stunning him.
"Perhaps." I said vaguely, wanting to get on edge because he was there, but the spiked wine kept me fully relaxed in the best of ways. His dark gaze lingered on me knowingly.
I got in my room and sighed, truly exhausted from the emotional turmoil of the day. I started to plop down on my bed, but a small box caught my attention. I picked it up and was caught off guard not having expected anything for Christmas since my parents were barely talking to me and Harry and Draco were not exactly the most festive people I had ever met.
“I need some thistle elixir and you know Professor Snape has never liked me much. Harry mentioned you had detention with him today so I was hoping you could get some for me, just say its for sum potion your working on.” Hagrid asked nervously as if we hadn’t been friends for years. I relaxed instantly.
"Oh. I almost forgot the bribe. Don't worry. The bank will transfer a hundred thousand gallons to your account before the end of the night. How foolish of me to forget." He said with a mock bow walking past the aurors pushing their wands aside uselessly.
“You want more?” He asked me breaking the kiss, out of breath himself. I started unbuttoned his shirt my intentions made clear. He was my professor, but here he wasn’t. He was just another person and quite an attractive one at that.
He led me through the massive gardens with the bushes and trees covered in snow. I could imagine it was beautiful on a summer day.
"What's wrong? Surely you don't regret this?" I said hopefully. I had enjoyed myself quite a lot and wanted more. He looked at me shocked.
“I hardly think you saw my inner most desires Granger. You just saw a fireplace and yourself.” I said with a sarcastic grin folding my arms triumphantly.
I stumbled to my feet, but I didn't stay there long. He hit me with a sectumsempra, my skin ripping open horrifically. I immediately started bleeding out, but he grabbed me by my collar, his snake-like face inches from my own.
"No. I'm coming with." I said stubbornly. The aurors gave each other a surprised look, but then shrugged.
“Detention.” I explained wryly. He nodded and glanced at Snape before leaning in and whispering.
I shut the outside world out and used my legimancy to separate myself from the pain. It was the only way I could make it through this without going insane. Or perhaps that’s what happened right before you went insane, compensate disassociation. I wasn’t sure.
"What were you REALLY doing down here? I know you weren't sneaking around with a boy, so come on. Spill it!" He said changing topic, which was fine by me. The less I worried about the death eaters, the better.
“I hope so.” I said breathing a deep sigh feeling my tension leaving. I got up and went over to his table of knick knacks absent-mindedly the lecture over.
I had to be dead then.
"You laugh, but I know he's always wanted a child to carry on his name and pass on his inheritance to. Its quite important to him." She said with a longing tone obviously having hoped it was her.
"Don't be silly Severus. How would I have arranged such a thing?" He said in a way that only made me more sure I was right. I knew he was a master puppeteer, but I had always assumed all his plans were for his own personal glory.
“Dumbledore only has two more votes than us. I tortured Rowley and Quinton and they agreed to switch sides and give us the vote in exchange for their families protection. That leaves just McKinney, who I was able to bribe which will give us the majority. The plan is take control of the parliament seats first, give away lots of money to everyone and show good will and acceptance. Once the next election comes up Lucius will be put forth and we will secure the Ministry of Magic.”
The sound of my hand slapping her reverberated in the otherwise empty hall and I felt shock go through my body.
That moment I promised myself I would never hit my child or wife. I would never hurt someone like he hurt us. I would be better than him.
"I SAID NO KILLING CURSES, WE NEED THE GIRL ALIVE." The Dark Lord screamed at one of his followers who sent a killing curse at Lupin. He thankfully was able to dodge it, but it came within feet of me.
“You should go Miss Granger.” He advised me in a warning way.
The fact that she was apologizing to me was laughable.
“Granger, when did you last eat?” Snape said from somewhere to my right. I took a few deep shaky breaths and my vision came back slowly as well as a pounding headache.
"Time to go home Miss. Granger." He said harshly walking with them willingly.
“How the fuck do you get them to submit like that?” One of the masked men asked from not too far away from me. I blushed and tried to get dressed ashamed, but Snape stopped me with a quick slap.
"Coming into class." She said unsurely after a moment. So it wasn't a long term thing, just short term. That was a relief at least. I walked to her slowly pulling her up against me savoring her warmth after such a troubling day. Her smile returned and she looked so innocent having no idea how close she had gotten to death in her stubbornness and Gryffindor recklessness.
Bonds with just one person and their magic will come together
I stormed through the halls barely containing my anger at the idiotic brunette that was ruining all my plans.
"When your father died? And you always wear it?" I asked nervously. He fed me a bite of the french toast. It was absolutely divine and erased the icky feeling the watch gave me instantly.
"Yes. Precisely." He said in a matter of fact way.
I also mused why Snape wasn't addressing what happened at all. He seemed quite content to ignore it and pretend everything was normal. It wasn't. I didn't know if I wanted to talk about things, but it would be nice if he offered at least.
I didn’t even get to counting to ten in my head, he was out like a light.  I couldn’t sleep. I had studying to do now that he was asleep. I waited until the headmaster left before setting my sights on Snape’s massive collection of books. Most of his books were old and covered dark subjects, which was exactly what I needed.
"You have blood on your shirt still." He said pointedly. I had tried to spell my clothes clean and fix the rip, but I had missed some. Of course he would notice since he could smell even the slightest amount of blood.
“You know perfectly well I would never lay a finger on a student under normal circumstances.” He ground out lowly, his eyes flashing dangerously at the accusation.
“Enough Potter. I’ve already arranged for her release.” Snape said as if he were the hero of the evening. Harry drew his fist back to punch Snape in the face, but Snape grabbed his fist midair and threw him back effortlessly. Draco was standing back watching everything unfold angry, but calm, his grey eyes flickering between Snape and I as if he understood something maybe I didn’t even know.
"Oh, it won't hurt one bit. I will take things slow." He said with a wicked smile running his hand up my dress.
Spelling your blood to boil yet you were unable to die so you were subjected to the pain continuously, removing teeth through the top of the head was another one. A particularly disturbing spell would enable the witch or wizard to only be able to procreate with beings of a different species and would create an insatiable desire to do so until the women conceived. That was how werewolfs and vampires started. They were both originally entirely feral creatures until bred with humans giving both enough in common with witches and wizards to make their bites transfer some of the DNA and for it to stick.
It proved a point, but also I have wanted to do that for so long. Kill two birds with one stone type deal. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I've created a whole mess for you I'm sure.
Controlling magic wasn't about brute force, but rather connecting with the magic and letting it consume you. Something the Dark Lord and even the Headmaster would never be able to master. I smiled at the thought and opened my eyes knowing I was successful before I even looked.
"Please Severus, I'm sorry, it was like she was drawing me in! I couldn't control myself. Please don't kill me!" Lucius begged quite comically. I gasped in shock and stood up shakily.
"What are you doing Granger?" I dropped my cereal box shocked and I turned around fast almost loosing balance. Snap was standing there still in his death eater robes, no mask though thankfully, arms folded and his displeasure evident in his glare.
“Surely you realize it? The headmaster needed you to watch Potter. He couldn’t let you graduate early, which you deserve. No. He gave you the time turner and still made you wait out your time to watch Potter. Lord knows he would be dead if he didn’t have you to rely on to keep him focused.” He said matter of factly. I had never considered this before, but he was right. It was strange I had never graduated even though I should have had plenty of credits. Not that I wanted to graduate early, but the offer would have been nice.
His words came into my mind soothing me and reassuring in an unexpected way. I looked over at him, but he was engaged in a light conversation with the tall dark auror about some Quidditch team, the complete epitome of relaxation.
I expected Severus to complain more, but he just rolled his eyes at my stubbornness and sighed, resigning himself to the fact I wasn't going to leave.
INTRODUCTION TO THE DARK ARTS
"He is going to be pissed." She said a bit sympathetically for me. I tried to steady my breathing knowing the chances of the ONE time we had sex causing a pregnancy couldn't be very high at all.
In a split second I wasn't with him anymore, I was in the room but he was gone. A handsome man stood in front of me, a smirk of his own playing on his perfectly formed lips.
"You're her teacher." He reminded me gently. My glare narrowed.
“So, how do I do that?” He waved me out of my seat and removed his cloak, rolling up his sleeves. I caught a glimpse of his dark mark, but I tried not to stare. He had never shown it before to me, but it looked rather hot much to my dismay. I shouldn’t have thought that over such a dark tattoo so I tried to block out my thoughts on it and focus.
"I..I was just..."
“Boys. Its been a long night. I will make sure Miss. Granger makes it to her bunks safely.” The headmaster said trying to get some privacy for us. I didn’t look at either of them as they left. I was transfixed by how sweet and innocent her round face was. Remembering the trusting way she leaned back when I told her to knowing the moment I saw her face I wouldn’t be able to control myself. I was a demon.
"Of course my Lord. Anything you need." I said bowing out when he flicked his wrist shooing me away. I had to convert Granger to the dark side. No problem. She was only one of the most staunch supporters of the Order.
“Miss Granger, what a welcome surprise.” The Headmaster said with a warm smile.
“Something? No. I felt everything. She’s going to wake up tomorrow and hate my guts and I will not be able to move on.” I explained staunchly knowing there was no way around it no matter how badly I fought it.
“Not to do it.” He was silent for a moment.
She wasn’t looking at me and I didn’t know how exactly to make my thoughts intentionally get to her, but she glanced up at me almost instantly and I knew she got my message.
“Severus, wait up.” Lupin called running after me. I sneered and walked faster.
“She wants me to teach her how to make spells. I found her creeping in the dark arts section of the bookstore trying to learn by herself.” I said grumpily. The headmaster grabbed me a coffee cup and tapped his wand to it filling it with hot chocolate before handing it to me which I accepted with a shaky hand.
"What potions ingredients did you take?" He asked, shocked.
After what felt like forever his onslaught stopped, his attention turning to a commotion at the doors.
When he finally drew back for a breath he was thoughtful and he let his hand tangle in my hair gently.
“Okay.” I said a bit unwillingly. Part of me wanted to keep his magic. It felt so untamed and playful. He grabbed my wrists and focused on me, his dark eyes focused on me. I felt my breath hitch in my throat not used to anyone paying so much attention to me.
You better hold your chin up. Every man in this room wishes they could have you and every women wishes they were you.
“Dobby is happy free, but not all elves want to be free Misses. Just like you don’t want to be free of Professor Snape.” I choked on my food a bit taken aback by his assessment.
"Absolutely not. They have nothing. This picture shows me touching her chin. That's it." I said shaking my head.
"It would be worth it." Harry blushed but smiled a bit trying to hide his embarrassment behind his drink.
"Severus...you won't die. We will find a way to save you." I said shaking my head refusing to accept defeat. I couldn't lose him, I had only just started to fall for him. I didn't want to move on, I wanted to stay with him forever. He smiled softly, kissing my forehead.
"Of, of course your honor. Yes. The same legal system that did nothing when I reported the broken bones Elijah came back with after every vacation, every break. The bruises that were ignored and my countless pleas for assistance ignored." Severus said harshly, his lighthearted attitude gone for the first time since he was arrested. The mood in the room shifted and whispers floated down the stadium style seats.
We walked in the snow together slowly towards the evening, the cold nothing compared to the warmth being with him brought me.
“Fine.” I said gruffly.
“Its weird for red to be the first color that pops into your mind.” He said pointedly.
"That sounds like exactly what I want." I said nodding at his idea enthusiastically.
I had only ever been kissed by teenage boys up until then. They were sloppy and quite gross.
“I should hope he wouldn’t kill you. We are about to hand him the Ministry of Magic! He should be worshipping the very ground you walk on.” The Headmaster said quite annoyed by the whole thing.
“Hermione! There you are!” Ron came up unexpectedly stepping between Snape and I oblivious.
"She's not poisoned! That won't work. We need an antidote." Draco said pointedly to me. Every potion I had ever brew came to mind in my panic rushing through in a chaotic jumble.
“I’m fine.” I insisted, but by the time I got out of the common rooms Lavender had shoved Ron after me.
He was silent for a long pause.
"God dammit, wake up woman!" I yelled furiously losing control of my magic for the first time that I could remember since I was a small child. It flowed through my hands into her shocking her with an electric shock that opened her eyes immediately.
"That's impossible." I stammered sure I couldn't do it. His red eyes narrowed on me threateningly.
"A diadem?" I asked, confused. First his anger was over his horcruxes, now some sort of tiara? It was insane ramblings.
“The Ministry of Magic is a new change to how we handle laws. We used to have a monarchy we plan to bring back to life. A new leader and new sign of hope. They would have a new council to replace the ministry of magic with certain rights, so some separation of power. Giving all the power to one group of people is clearly not the way forward. ” Snape explained rubbing his head, a headache clearly building from the cruciatis curse.
"Of course. He said to do as much. Never take it off." He said, he light mood darkening a bit at the memories. I hummed struggling with finding a way to break the bad news to him.
"I knew it was cursed, it's a bit of a research project on the Dark Lord. Draco helped me find the diadem, but I haven't been wearing it. I wanted to destroy it actually." I insisted putting the diadem in my luggage and locking it before someone else stumbled on it. Ginny's eyes widened even further.
"It's not me that you desire, is it? Tell me one good reason you should deny yourself your desires Hermione." His voice was soft yet kind. Accepting. Enticing. I found my thoughts running much slower than normal.
“Look me in the eyes and tell me you don’t have feelings for him.” He demanded harshly.
Better not to start when you knew you would I fail I supposed.
"Finally! You were out cold my girl. How are you feeling?" Poppy asked her to try to gage her mental health. She looked around confused and sat up abruptly realizing she was in the hospital wing. Her eyes locked with mine and I expected anger, but I saw just pain instead.
"Somewhat. They are a bit early I think, though someone took my pocket watch so I can't be sure." He said with a pointed glare at me without any real venom.
Just trust me.
"Because the Headmaster asked me to. I'm sure there's a valid reason." Professor McGonagall said, her own tone disproving. They didn't have time to argue. The Dark Lord's ranks came forward, their masks on and wands out.
“Here.” I said simply.
Then I noticed the slight hand tremor in his hand as he waved me back to my seat. He wasn’t asking for it because he wanted to taunt me, he obviously had been tortured recently and actually needed my potion.
"I don't really drink." I said smelling the wine carefully.
It's so normal.
“Professor?” I pleaded starting to get a little panicked by his lack of action. He paced towards me and I was sure he was going to save me, but he grabbed his mask from a drawer I was standing in front of and nodded to me.
"Hermione isn't dark right? She helps me with my homework a lot. I wont get dark if I practice spells with her, right?" Elijah said, unsurely putting down his books. He was only a second year, but he was far more mature than most second years. I went to my desk sitting down defeated and poured myself a whiskey.
I shouldn’t be so tempted by his offer to show me the dark. I needed a therapist, I was sure of it. And a nice light, not death eater boyfriend to distract me. ASAP.
"Azra?" I asked, confused.
Why are you pleading guilty to a crime you didn't commit!
The moment the magic flowed through my hands I felt it in a rush. The energy was dark, yet so enticing. I could feel it bending to change the mouse to a floating state responding to the command before flowing back through the wand and to me. It was heavier than I would’ve anticipated and it felt more playful also. Dark yet playful.
"Yes. Detention." I explained evenly wondering where he was going with this.
The number of times I had watched Severus drink it after meetings, just casually knocking it back dwelling in its pain relieving properties shot to the forefront of my mind.
"Feel his magic? Of course. It courses through you like an unstoppable waterfall." He said with a sarcastic laugh feeling the air around me feeling what I supposed was my magic.
“Why did he torture you?” I asked curious what could have made him so angry. I could tell he didn’t want to answer. He was a private person and never answered any question that was more than surface level deep.
"I think that's why they were killed off. People like him getting control." Dumbledore said quietly. I walked over to his table of trinkets, my mind reeling from what this meant for the war.
I had taught Veelas before and had no trouble keeping my thoughts straight. With her though, my mind knew how soft her kiss was. How sweetly and innocently she played into my whims. So strong, and yet she melted just like ice on a hot day.
"Shh...I got you." He said controllingly somehow managing to force me to stay in the heightened state of arousal but refusing to let me cum. He thrust in and out harder and faster, his pace picking up, moving my hips to suit his needs.
The last time I was at the ministry of magic was a very unpleasant one, so I felt chills go down my spine walking back into the familiar building. Memories of the horrid day we lost Sirius ran through my mind making me waver in my desire to be there for Severus. I had assumed I was over it, but my breaths started coming in quicker and the oxygen in the large building seemed to drop.
But a part of me had believed Snape when he promised to get us out of this alive.
His black eyes darkened and he picked me up getting up and dressing himself quickly making sure to hide his mark first.
“All I’m saying is, be careful with her. She seems tough, but she has the weight of the world on her shoulders right now. One little breeze can knock her over.” He warned me, then left leaving me with dark thoughts.
“The headmaster knows?” He asked without an accusing tone.
His tongue danced with mine first gentle, but quickly harder and when he bit my lip it sent a wave of pleasure through my body. I hummed wanting more even as he pulled back.
"We don't come for a fight. We want only Potter and Granger. If you give us them, we will spare your pitiful lives." The death eater said harshly. It was Antonin. Harry and I looked at each other frightened, but ready.
"Tell me you didn't figure out the horcruxes by thinking of what you yourself would use." He said challenging me. My mouth opened, but I just as quickly closed it realizing there was more truth to his words than I liked.
My mind wandered during my classes and I barely managed to take decent notes on the topics we covered. Even defense against the dark arts struggled to keep my attention. It wasn't like we were learning anything useful anyways, should learning how to destroy dark objects be somewhere in our syllabus? No. It was nowhere to be found.
"POPPY!" I called barging in, the doors slamming open in front of me. She rushed from her office in her gown looking disheveled and exhausted, but she perked up quickly seeing Hermione.
"Hermione? Why did you put that on! Are you mental?" Draco yelled, taking it from me as shocked as I was.
"Three. Confundus!" The room seemed to lose air in an instant. It was like a vacuum had been started and every ounce of oxygen had been sucked out with the flip of a switch. The spell had been heading towards me, but the magic vanished with a wisp of gold color extinguished by some unknown source.
"No." I said with a shrug having considered that but fairly sure that wasn't what it was.
It was a gorgeous blue and silver piece that looked timeless and yet so beautiful I had to admire it. The moment I touched it I could feel the darkness it held within it.
"Fine." I said shortly not wanting to elaborate.
"Trying to what?" I pressed harshly, having a hard time holding back with her. Some part of my brain told me to hold back, I would regret hurting her, but the other part wanted her to fear me and the dark magic she stole from me.
I wanted to last longer, but the way he took control, his eyes filled with desire and even his dark mark all just turned me on even more than I could handle.
"Luckily Neville's family is rich so I will be able to hire a maid to do my housework." Ginny said only slightly teasing. I knew she would do it in a second.
"He made me dinner on the astronomy tower, one of my favorites actually. It was just divine." I said a bit sadly. Her mouth dropped from shock.
I was fine with that and leapt up from the bed throwing myself into his arms relief of magnitudes I had never understood flooding through me.
"So do you love her?" His question caught me off guard and I sputtered a bit on the whisky.
"What's this?" Ginny said distractedly looking under my bed now. I felt my heart stop seeing the glint of metal under my bed realizing a split second too late what I forgot. She picked it up and I knew she could feel the dark magic that radiated off of it. Her expression darkened and she dropped it as if burned standing up angrily.
"What so every stressed student is a death eater now? I don't think the Dark Lord realizes how strong his ranks are." I said sarcastically swirling her pain potion savoring the relaxing feeling it gave me.
The order immediately started to get their wand out ready to fight, but one death eater stepped forward holding up their hands.
“So feisty. You know…the Dark Lord has been asking for a way to terrorize the little brat. Stealing his girlfriend and torturing her would do quite nicely.” He mused backing up to discuss with Snape.
My hands went cold seeing Voldemort’s smile and I didn’t even have time to prepare before I was hit with his first curse.
I felt my energy draining and I wasn't able to deflect even half of the spells. Strangely enough the ones I couldn't block didn't seem to hit me. I had to assume it was my empath magic working, but I was too exhausted to think too much.
Fuck.
"Doing what exactly?" I asked firmly, trying to not let myself feel anything for her. I needed to stay distant, cold. I managed it with everyone else, why couldn't I manage it with her.
“Your fine. I promise.” I said thinking about the stark difference between Neville and Snape. Obviously I SHOULD have gone for Neville, but he just couldn’t keep my interest comparatively.
“Perhaps there’s something she fears more than pain. I can’t imagine someone like her has gotten around much.” Malfoy Sr. said eagerly to get his hands on me. I had little doubt that was his plan from the beginning. Voldemort appeared to consider and came over pushing me with his shoe making sure I was still alive.
"HOW DARE YOU DEFILE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, INNOCENT SOUL YOU DISGUSTING LEECH." She yelled full of a fire I didn't even know she possessed.
I trekked down to the lake under the invisibility cloak I had borrowed from Harry trying not to get caught. I could only imagine how it would look to be caught meeting up with a professor after curfew, but luckily I saw no one on my trip down.
He had grown up enough to realize my hands were tied in certain cases like these and I didn’t want to do the things I did.
Her body called to me like no woman’s had before. If I could have developed the perfect woman for me, I couldn’t have come even close to how much I obsessed over her every curve. The soft smile on her face, the way her intelligent eyes held such depth that was lacking in most women. She wasn’t a normal witch at all.
"Is something the matter Miss. Granger?" She asked in her thick accent, adjusting her spectacles to see me more clearly.
"That's a way to start the holidays I suppose." I said with a sigh once the coast was clear.
“I’m here alone because…I’m here, aren’t I? No boy wants a bookworm.” I said amused at her ridiculousness.
"Hermione!"
‘Severus…please. I need your help. I just don’t have the expertise.” The headmaster asked again. Snape looked at him finally taking his attention off me. After a long moment he nodded seeming to finally understand whatever the headmaster was hinting at that was so important.
"She's an empath." I said watching his reaction. I expected guilt, but he actually seemed surprised.
If I wasn’t in a room full of people I was sure he would have killed me for my insolence. I didn’t have to look at his fiery expression long because he swept away angrily, his cloaks billowing behind him.
“I dunno.” I said hazily. He was standing to my left and seemed reluctant to touch me to help me up, but also seemed unwilling to let me die on his floor unattended.
“What kind of bad feeling?” He asked sounding more concerned than I anticipated. I bit my lip nervously to vocalize it, but at the same time needing to say my fear aloud.
I contemplated telling Harry, but he would no doubt freak out about having a piece of Voldemort inside him. It was up to me to track down the remaining pieces so we could kill Voldemort once and for all.
Yet, the burning light of life woke me from my deep painful sleep refusing me the death I wanted so dearly.
"You should write to the Prime Minister. Complain. Maybe you can get him sent to Azkaban." Ron mused swallowing an unearthly amount of food at once. I cringed wondering how I used to have a crush on him at all.
"I'm pretty tired. I need to go to bed, Good night you guys!" I said with a fake smile kicking myself internally for acting so damn suspicious. Severus was over here faking an entire personality and I couldn't even get a shred of information past two very oblivious people.
“Levimus.” I called out hoping I didn’t hurt the little mouse who was now scattering around the container he was in.
“She did?” I asked, surprised how I could have made her cry. She was tortured for an hour and had stayed silent the whole time. I had barely even insulted her. I could be so much more cruel than I had been to her.
It's just mixed with a relaxation potion.
"I'm happy you're awake. I was worried you would sleep forever. Not that your tiredness isn't expected, all things considered." He said happily coming to the bedside looking me up and down curiously.
I had never seen something so beautiful. Every hall we went down was carefully decorated with the shite marble floor and hand carved marble trim. Even the lights were stunning, when I looked closely I realized the hundreds of light holders were actually white panther figurines. All the lights made the halls beautiful and bright instead of dark and dreary like most manors I had been in, including Malfoy manor. I could tell great care was put into making it a quality home.
“What? I’m not out sleeping around if that’s what you think!” I snapped thinking of the many couples my age that did exactly that. He smirked a bit playfully almost leaning back watching my annoyance with humor.
"I'm afraid it does look like he has been pulling the strings. I suppose for now there's nothing we can do but go along with his plan. He will kill you otherwise. We just have to hope she doesn't become obsessed with the dark side and can keep up the ruse as just a ruse." He said sullen at the very thought that we were powerless right now.
“I don’t think you see her brilliance really. She’s not just intelligent, but she applies herself too.” Minerva continued fussing me out over her potatoes.
“I will teach you…if…you never touch one of these books again. You can stay after class on Mondays.” He said holding up the dark arts book.
“NO.” The words escaped from my mouth before I could catch myself. My head shot up and I realized a second too late he had been testing me. His smile was dark and sinister.
"Of course I did. They are controlled by the Dark Lord primarily unfortunately. They had to arrest me or the papers would've had a field day, but reality wise they know they can't put me in Azkaban. They would be dead before I even got there." He explained his mood lightning very slightly, but still much darker than before.
Then why did it feel so right? I should have protested when he slid my robes off smoothly off my shoulders, but I just hummed in the kiss letting him undress my deftly working with one hand and using the other to explore my body.
I needed to know more. I was sure there was a spell, something that could protect me from them. Voldemort had used me as a toy, something for amusement, and I hadn’t even fought back. I should have fought back, but I was just too weak. I knew I couldn’t overpower them all.
"We need to destroy it." I said afraid to touch it again.
Is that why you joined him?
"I was thoroughly impressed by her self control. Not screaming after nearly an hour being tortured? I have never seen anything like it before." The dark lord mused glancing at quickly book on a small table near his throne.
"Oh? What effect does it have to not add fairy wings Potter?" I questioned him silkily. He was silent, his gob smacked expression quite hilarious.
I felt like I would die with the pain. I kept waiting for him to end the curse, but it went on and on, the pain overwhelming my every nerve.
“Detention Granger.”
He looked at me darkly observing my reaction before drinking more as if daring me to confess what I did. He was literally insane.
Ability to change how magic responds to new spells. Normal witches and wizards had to work within the confines that empaths set for magic control
"Your baby needs rest. Not chaos. You only have two more weeks left, enjoy the time without a screaming elf to watch." He told her a bit harshly annoyed with her defiance.
"What the fuck are you talking about? Will someone tell me what's going on" I asked my own anger flaring at her outburst.
"I'm just saying, you put the diadem on remarkably fast. It was kind of scary how little control you had." He said worriedly glancing over at me with more than a hint of suspicion. I didn't want to explain I was sure I wasn't evil, it was just Snape's magic controlling me, but I didn't think that would go over well, so I just kept quiet and let the subject go.
"Miss. Granger. The Headmaster has been looking for you." She said, her lips a thin line.
"What? Are you going to hit me?" She asked with a teasing smile, her humor still alive.
"When I was brought back I lost my charming good looks, something I'm sure you can attest to with having worn the diadem." He mused darkly.
If I thought we were going in alone I was mistaken. At the entrance of the ministry the entire order waited for us.
“Of course not. I just wanted to stop in and see how things were going before our meeting. I know you have a lot on your plate trying to figure out why the Dark Lord can’t kill potter.” He said pouring Snape his own whisky. Snape took it gratefully and turned so that I couldn’t see Malfoy. My mind turned processing what he said. So Harry WASN’T killable?
"Thanks." She said out of breath, but the success was quickly forgotten as another death eater attacked. It took everything in me to keep cursing dancing around the quick shots of light in all directions.
I struggled not to laugh at his sarcasm.
"Fine." I gave in reluctantly. He waved his wand down me and my school uniform changed into an elegant light white dress that covered every inch of me, yet showed off my figure in a slightly scandalous way. I loved it. It was perfectly safe, yet still a hint of adventure.
I waited until break started and snuck out after curfew using Harry's cloak wandering the halls trying to find some room that hadn't been explored. It was boring, tedious work.
"He will kill you if you hurt me." I yelled trying to pull myself free. Between being a fraction of their size and the wine it was a hopeless cause.
“Now, let’s say we want to change things up. I want to levitate this mouse, but wingardium leviosa doesn’t have the desired effect. Wingardium leviosa will make the object fly up, whereas I want the mouse to levitate slowly. I would use levimus" He said showing me a mouse in a plastic container he had prepared for my lesson. It was cute and brown and I just wanted to let it roam free instead of being all caged up.
"Of course My Lord. A deal is a deal." He said formally, giving a small bow. Voldemort waved us in and welcomed us to the feast.
“I have to go.” He said standing up.
"It's just...immoral. He's my teacher. He's a death eater, you people kill people like me normally. I don't get why you haven't killed me yet." I said trying to sound more confident than I felt. He raised an eyebrow questioningly.
The locket caught my attention and I cleared my throat ready to move onto less weighty matters.
“Strange that she would be so hurt by such a comment.” The Headmaster said pointedly, happy she was clearly developing some sort of feelings for me.
“Where I want to be forever. Your arms of course.” I said relishing the freedom of being able to be with her without guilt. Without worrying about other people’s desires. It was serenity.
"What's the most profitable potion?" I asked curiously. He was thoughtful and contemplated my question.
“I’m fine.”
Lucius stalked to me dangerously, his smile dark and sinister.
I smirked in a very Snape like way and laughed ironically. I felt Snape's power flowing to me and I felt crushed realizing it meant he had passed, but that same feeling empowered me in ways I had never dreamed was possible.
I gently slid from behind her making sure to not wake her and went to change and drink some more of her miracle potion needing to distract myself. I was so sore, but I managed to get a shower and put sweat pants on. I didn’t bother with a shirt since I was just so pained even after the pain potion.
As if in slow motion her movements slowed dramatically and she looked at me with surprise. She opened her mouth as if to gasp for air, but then fell back passing out, her body not moving at all on the cold stone floor.
"Get Madame Pomfrey." Draco told Potter who immediately ran off to go get help. It wouldn't help, he wouldn't be back within three minutes so she would suffocate. Her total paralysis included her breathing which had fully stopped.
The fuck.
We were barely touching, yet the intimacy of the moment was vividly apparent. The small smile she had was simply divine. Lost in love. Even my expression was calm and happy. I had just saved her from dying, it was a moment of weakness, but that picture managed to capture my heart on my sleeve. I felt the air in my throat catch remembering how I felt in that moment.
“I was just looking up spells and such. Studying. Nothing much.” Harry looked me up and down noting my disheveled appearance with my hair taken down and my shirt untucked. I blushed and hurriedly put my hair back up.
"Who is it that you think I serve then?" He asked, pulling back annoyed.
"I thought you would never wake up." He said cooking what looked like French toast skillfully. The smell was delicious and made me realize I was absolutely starving.
I remembered reading about the wars they started controlling magic and creating havoc. At the center of almost every war was their bonded. If I was an Empath I would bond with one person and would fight to the death with them.
"I have been a gentleman this far Hermione, but I can't see myself resisting temptation much longer." He said lowly, the dangerous way his dark eyes flickered, grazing over my body, enough to keep me warm in the coldest of winters.
My thoughts, or lack thereof, were interrupted by a familiar voice from behind me.
“Why?” He asked actually taking me seriously. I shifted nervously.
I raised my wand.
“Why me?” I asked aghast. My guilty feeling increased even more.
"History books obviously." He shook his head and his eyes roamed over me hungrily in a way I was quite unfamiliar with.
“Where is here?” I quirked my head unsure of how to reply. Why would my own mind be so worried about where I was? It was aggravating to say the least.
“I wont do what he requested with you. I can’t give details. It’s not your fault. It’s mine. I can’t always please both masters.” He said with a shrug drinking some more. I had never seen him so relaxed and casual. He always held himself up with such a regal manner seeing him calm and at ease was bizarre.
He had a dozen cereals, it was like my paradise. I couldn't decide which one looked better, they all looked delicious.
"The way you looked at her." He said sitting down ready to talk about whatever was bothering him. I had unofficially adopted him, even though he was a Ravenclaw. I saw so much of my past in his story and knew how hard it was to grow up without any guardian's.
I was dreading yet another day of failed spell making, but I tried to keep that out of my head as I got dressed for the day. Ginny was going through my trunk under my bed trying to get a clean shirt out since she had forgotten to wash hers and I was the same size.
The hushed whispers flowed through the room shock I had actually managed to change him. I couldn't stop myself from smiling a bit arrogantly at my own power.
Yet I knew watching her be with anyone besides me would kill me now. She was supposed to be mine. I always thought the war would be the death of me. Here I was completely oblivious to the real threat right in front of me.
"That locket, where did you get it?" I asked curiously. He glanced down at it surprised by the change in topic.
"The Dark Lord wants to do a hostile takeover. In just a matter of a few weeks. You will be his shiny trophy helping him do exactly that. He wants to place himself as the new ruler, whereas the Headmaster wants to be the new ruler. The ensuing battle will determine the future of our very society." He explained calmly, but his eyes held more worry than I had ever seen before. My breath hitched a bit realizing how serious that would be.
"How did you afford this house anyways?" I asked curious how he managed to afford such a thing. He glanced up at the large manor and shrugged nonchalantly.
He was waiting outside when I left though, giving me pause to my thoughts. He was leaned back against the window of a store opposite of me and as soon as I came out he started to come to me, his dark look full of emotions I couldn’t read.
"Why would you search for that cursed object? You're already the smartest person I know. No need to go searching for more intelligence. Remember, everything comes at a cost." He said harshly, assuming I wanted it for myself.
"Would never disobey me? Missing something Severus?" He sneered pointing at my chest that only had blood everywhere.
“If its that easy, why doesn’t everyone just make their own custom spells for everyday life?” I asked curiously.
HOGWARTS SCANDAL
“What did I say about putting your head down Granger?” He asked quietly watching me with an unreadable expression.
I went immediately to the spells section and looked for anything that could help me in my task. I was looking to explore the idea of using existing spells to combat multiple people at once and I was sure there had to be a workaround.
She was still sleeping when I got out, so I went to make breakfast when the bookshelf caught my eye. The books were out of order. I sighed seeing that every single one she had pulled out was dark magic. My magic in her was undoubtedly pulling on her trying to get her to release it. Obsess over learning more magic in such a subtle way you didn’t even realize the darkness was manipulating you.
“Decency Granger? Who cares what is decent.” He said loudly annoyed at my bringing up rationality.
“Well, guess I get to keep some of your magic then.” I said bemused by the sudden change in events. He growled annoyed clearly not finding it as funny as I was.
I tried to force the curse off of myself, desperate for some relief, but he only intensified the pain with every attempt, his scream audible vaguely from my distorted place in my mind.
"They both groomed you from such a young age to be exactly what they wanted. Its...horrid." I said tearfully. He came to me and brushed away my tears, smiling a bit his head quirked.
"Fuck you. Fuck this." I said under my breath turning and leaving him alone. He called my name , but I ignored him and ran until I found the door and left not caring where I went to. It was freezing and I had no wand on me, but I was so angry I went out into the cold anyways desperate to get away from him.
"Granger. I need your presence." Snape said, interrupting seeming urgent. I humphed, folding my arms glaring at him and ignoring the library's pointed glances. Snape just seemed confused why she was staring at him so creepily.
My potion was one of the few in the room that didn’t have gooey sludge in the works besides Draco of course. I had ten minuets before my potion would be ready for the next ingredient so I took a deep breath watching the blond bully glance at Harry between making his own potion.
"Severus. Up." He hissed looking down on me from his throne. I obediently got up and looked at him trying to read his mood. Sometimes he would just start torturing with little to no reason when he was in a bad mood. Today though he seemed calm looking at me thoughtfully toying with his wand.
"So what? I'm supposed to forgive you for intentionally making me develop feelings for you just because you didn't think you would get feelings? Sounds like a personal problem. Sorry the plan didn't work out for you." I said curtly turning again and twisting myself out of his grip. I had actually made it part way back up the hill to the castle when he called for me.
Nonsense. We can do a replay anytime you want.
"What the hell is wrong with me?" I muttered to myself angry I was feeling anything but hatred for him. He was a selfish jerk who had used me for his own good. He could have fought Malfoy Sr. on the idea to go.
He toyed with his wand relishing my panic. I looked to Snape, but he stood there motionless. I could tell he was as surprised and frightened where this was going based on his cold empty mask he wore when he was holding back.
"You know dearie, you should really get a social life." The library caretaker said coming over and seeing me still there on lockup time. I had just found a book outlining the destruction of an early version of the philosopher's stone which was the most promising thing I had read in a while. They had used fiendfyre.
"Your chosen one is dead fool." Voldemort said, his smile cruel and his attention off me finally. I was losing blood fast and I knew I only had a few minutes of life left. I tried to heal my wounds, but whatever dark curses they were wouldn't heal with normal spells.
You have to ask for it
"Technically, yes. Its rarity is what makes its value so high. I created it myself. So no, you wouldn't ever read about it." He said with an amused smile. It was only then that I looked at him, more than just looked at his individual features but rather the whole picture.
“Ah…Severus. You feel better. More…energetic.” He hissed joyously taking in Grangers magic around mine.
"That's true." I said wincing at how annoying of a student I must truly be.
“He had a meeting with Tom.” He said pointedly trying to speak in code. As if it mattered. I sighed, throwing up a Muffalito spell.
"Should we?" One of them asked the judge, but he shook his head and we passed untouched. When we were in the hall I let out a deep breath I didn't even know I had been holding in.
Nothing happened.
"Aha! Here it is. Empaths were generally more powerful than a normal witch or wizard. Their power was something that inspired legends, but also inspired fear. They were heavily prosecuted during the early 1200's until the last one died out. The differences between a normal witch or wizard and an empath was subtle.
"Good. Get some sleep. You need it. You too Severus, I'm sure its been a long night for you too." She said with pity that I didn't deserve knowing what typically went on at meetings.
"What did she think of that?" The headmaster asked surprised since that wasn't in the list in his book. It was hardly a comprehensive list.
“You are a pawn in the Headmaster's game. Same as Potter. Same as I. So when I say I don’t give a fuck if I cross a line of decency, realize I mean it.” He said with the upmost sincerity. I felt conflicted. One side of me wanted to follow the rules and ignore Snape, but the other side heard the truth in his statements and was so pissed I would have done anything wrong just to anger the headmaster.
“Who exactly do you think you are you little mudblood?” He asked so softly and quietly only I could hear him. He was baiting me. I was sure of it. He wanted me to yell and make a fool of myself just to make me look bad. Hearing him call me a mudblood though seemed to do the opposite. I felt my heart race thinking of every way I wasn’t good enough. Every time I had failed. Every person who hated me at the school just because of my parents.
"Well, who would drink one of Potter's potions anyways? Everyone knows he can't brew a potion to save his life." Draco said turning the heat off me, laughing a bit. Potter looked up from tending to Hermione overhearing Draco's comment, but he just rolled his eyes.
“Out of my way!” I yelled at a group of annoying third years who were hanging out in the hallways like this was the kid zone. I managed to make it to the headmasters office in record time and slammed open his door seething still. Blaise was in the headmasters chair and jumped up at being intruded on.
"Professor, ummm, I think perhaps you shouldn't..." Draco tried to step in alarmed, but I silenced him with a deadly glare. Potter looked at the potion nervously adjusting his glasses clearly having no confidence in his own potion making skills.
"Now we can plan our forever." He said quite happily once I pulled back from the hug. I wiped away my tears.
"I forgot it was there really." I said lamely.
"What were you doing with Snape?" Harry asked with more than a hint of suspicion not as oblivious today as Draco was. Usually Draco was the suspicious one of the two of them.
“I see…I know what this is about…you have feelings now for him, don’t you? I was wondering why you didn’t get him arrested.” He said looking at me disgusted. I didn’t have to ask who he was talking about.
I tried to talk to her, almost unwilling to do it and not get a response.
My mind ran through the possibilities and I knew this had to do with my magic consuming her. It would pull her to the dark and wouldn't relent until she went full dark. My worst nightmare.
"Fuck, Hermione!" I ran the rest of the distance to her and picked her up. She was limp and lifeless. I whispered the incantation for hot air and let the air hover over her slowly warming her as I rushed to the gates.
Where are you?
“If this is what he does to his supporters, imagine what he does to people he hates.” I said sure they hadn’t grasped the reality of what they were suggesting.
"She's making a potion to fix the headmaster's hand." Potter said, giving me a hard glare for her telling me to back off in his own way. I let my icy glare linger on him, but he was unfazed.
“Its my fault. I should have found a way out. I thought she was underage though and you know the Dark Lord takes a hard pass until they are of age. I didn’t know she used a time turner.” I said wondering how I could have miscalculated so badly. The headmaster sighed and brought me some whisky and a glass knowing what I needed on a night like tonight.
Whatever I thought would happen next didn’t. He seemed to remember himself and pulled his hand away taking a large drink of whiskey, his mood changing.
My hand grazed over his mark and I could feel the dark energy coming from it, twisting and turning around my hand. I broke off our kiss and I leaned down kissing the mark gently my feelings made clear. I didn't care about the mark, he was exactly what I wanted.
He pulled up a chair and sat beside me and cast two wandless spells to ensure our privacy I assumed before turning to me.
I was going to hell for what I wanted to do to her, but she was heaven itself so worth it in every way.
My arm burned and I quickly left her needing to get away before she realized. I couldn't let something so bright and full of life be burned by something so dark and evil.
“Muffliato.” I said waving my wand around us to avoid eavesdropping.
I was in the hallway with her and my hand was raised, the anger of her actions fueling my anger in an indescribable way.
"DON'T LIE TO ME. I know when they are moved. You have been moving them!" He roared, dropping me to my knees, kicking me for emphasis. I had to think fast and figure out a way out of this. Unfortunately blood loss made that damn near impossible.
"A teacher's salary isn't much to get by on." I responded knowing there was no way he could support two people on his meager earnings. Her eyebrows went up dramatically.
"Hermione!" The name woke me out of my trance and I realized Professor Lupin had been calling my name for some time. He sighed dramatically.
His hand trailed down my cheek slowly and I fought the urge to throw up.
He ended the curse and changed tactics, the curse whispered with an urgent air under his breath. I felt my body slam into the wall opposite of me, several bones cracking in the process.
“Nonsense! He doesn’t even like girls. Surely you realize that?” I snapped over his childish tactics. His eyebrows went up at my statement not having known that.
Snape glared at me, his normal loathing coming back full force. Of course it would, we were enemy's. Nothing more of course.
"Harry!" I said going to him, but as quickly as the pain came it seemed to vanish and his green eyes were wide with fear.
"Nevermind. Sorry for the attitude Professor. It's been a long night."
“Stop.” He commanded to me, his dark eyes somehow dangerous enough to quiet m down. I felt weak and shaky from being held under the cruciatis curse for so long, but managed to sit up on the stone pillar he set me on. I was perfectly aligned to him, but even with the prop of the pedestal, he was much taller than I was.
Her eyes widened and she backed up slowly, her smile nervous but also still there. I shut the door behind us and in a second had her on the edge of the large four poster bed,
"Well, obviously. His personality is dark and nothing like yours. What other reason could you have for liking him? Don't think I'm judging you, we all have tried our chances with him here. He's quite the looker, isn't he?" She said bemused glancing at Snape with a look that betrayed her own thirst.
I digested what he said realizing what he was implying.
"You've been very busy today, haven't you little princess? Killed my snake, my goblet, and my diadem!" He snarled dangerously, every step he came closer I knew I was getting closer to death. My mind reeled a bit. Someone had killed Nagani and destroyed his goblet?
All I could remember was the pain. So much pain.  Never-ending pain that flowed in endless currents through my whole body.
"Why did you bring the children?" Molly said horrified seeing us coming.
The holidays came up with a speed that gave me some much needed alone time without him. I spent much of my time in the library looking up possible horcruxes and going over history that would help me figure out what he had been up to.
Trees.
“I think Voldemort had Snape bring me on purpose. I think the entire kidnapping was staged.” I admitted reluctantly. He stiffened at this.
"Yes, well he loves history doesn't he? The horcruxes are as much vanity objects as they are safeguards for his soul." I said with a smile.
"Now, now there Snape. She was just tryin' to get some potions ingredients. No need to get so worked up." Hagrid said giving me a wink so I could slink away while he talked with him.
"Oh. Well, then I can help you with that." He said changing directions back down the stairs after I just spent so much energy climbing them.
There were countless trees on my property, but I headed towards them looking for her in their midst.
I sent a quick patronus to the Headmaster to let him know I couldn’t cover my classes before going through the familiar routine of going to the Dark Lords throne room.
“Take the edge off.” He said before pouring himself his own nightcap. I drank it slowly letting the warmth ease my aching muscles.
When he appearated back at Hogwarts grounds I tried not to feel sad knowing we would have to go back to how things were, but I still hesitated at the gates biting my lip wondering if we had to go back already. Severus gave me a questioning look, but seemed to read my mind.
"What do I get out of it? You think I'm a gold digger? What kind of nonsense is that?" I spat angry he could think such a thing of me.
"Empaths died out ages ago. You've been locked up for far too long Tom." I said moving to take the diadem off. He stopped me, his expression becoming serious for a moment.
He just wanted freedom for everyone.
"That was interesting. I could feel the heat between you two. Things aren't settled at all clearly." Harry said grabbing an apple and biting into it eagerly.
"It's a girl." He said, glancing to my stomach pointedly. My mouth dropped open. I had only been trying to get him to hold on so I could save him. I never thought I was ACTUALLY pregnant.
"They are wrong. Take it from the most powerful person you've ever met besides yourself." He said seriously before releasing my hand allowing me to take the diadem off.
"It's over." He said quietly, sitting beside me enveloping me in his embrace. His warm magic swirled around me and inside me calming me and soothing me gently.
My racing heart skipped more than a few beats as relief overwhelmed me and I sat back letting her sit up. She was alive.
"Of course. Your curse or whatever seems to only affect the death eaters. Not all of them either, Draco was perfectly fine. I've never seen magic like that before, the whole room collapsed in on itself. It was awesome." Harry said with a mixture of pride and awe. I felt nothing but dread.
I said rubbing my arm heading up to Gryffindor tower a bit sour.
Nothing would work with the combination she drank. Who would invest an antidote to a slightly mis brewed potion anyways?
I didn't know what I would do with a child. I had done so many crazy things through the years, breaking curfew, fighting dark wizards, sneaking around getting into mischief.
I joined to bring him down. Not to say I didn't get anything out of the deal of course.
"He hates that he doesn't have his own." The retort actually stuck pretty hard. It made sense. He spent all day caring for other people's kids and had. None for himself. It would make anyone bitter.
“I know.” I said watching her interact with Ron, who she seemed to have fixed things with. She seemed slightly less happy around him, but her smile was still there. She glanced up at the head table and saw me watching her.
“That’s enough, no need to make a spectacle. Mr. Wesley you need to go to the infirmary. Miss Granger, straight to the Headmasters office. I have never seen such a barbaric…” I zoned out not caring about her ranting. I felt better than I had in days. I was tired of people deciding what would happen to me in life. I had at least made one decision in life and that was to make sure Ron never insulted me again.
“You missed class twice now. Why are you in the library at ten at night when you can’t even make it to a ten am class?” He asked folding his arms and glaring at me accusingly. I could smell the bourbon on him still, a smell I was familiar with from the copious amounts of bourbon Hagrid drank when we visited him. Hagrid became loud and annoying when drinking, but I could barely tell the difference with Snape.
“You rarely ever talk back. It’s unlike you.” He said with what could be viewed as something resembling concern if I didn’t know he was a cold selfish bastard. I just scrubbed the cauldron harder.
“Why are we going to the Headmasters anyways?” Ron asked curiously thankfully changing subject.
Of course he would keep it close to him, he would want extra assurance that he knew where the horcruxes were, especially if he thought I was trying to find them. I had to hide my smile, the meeting not a total waste of time after all.
"I shouldn't have said anything. The things they wrote about you were horrid. I don't know why they would assume you guys were sleeping together just because I took a picture of you looking in his eyes. I took the picture originally to prove Ron was wrong. He thought Snape was using you, but the way he was looking at you was so...protective. Caring." She explained, filled with more regret than what the situation deserved. I was quiet letting my own anger at her simmer down. It seemed like she really didn't mean for it to happen.
"Snape..."
There was no response. I put a heating charm on myself while I looked, but I didn't see her anywhere. The snow was piling up fast and I struggled to walk through the thick snow banks.
"Stop holding back. I know you desire him. Your so-called morals are pointless. You have one life, you might as well enjoy it." I nodded breathing a sigh of relief only when he was gone.
“Studying…I see.” He murmured as if he didn’t believe me at all.
"He put the thought into Lucius's head to get her. I'm fairly sure he was having some of the Slytherins annoy her to get her in detention so she would be an easy target. He suspected she was an empath, but he wanted to see for himself. I tried to connect with her as much as possible when I…" I trailed off unable to finish my statement.
How the fuck did he know?
He smiled darkly watching me drink.
I went to the common room and the only person there was Ron unfortunately.
“I see.” I said not sure if I was ready to start, but also needing to start or I would back out. He sensed my nervousness and stepped in front of the mouse container.
"So why didn't he just knock someone up? Surely it can't be that hard." I said brushing it off.
“Miss Granger, I know you have had a rough few weeks, but taking it out on your friends is not becoming of someone with your brilliance.”  The headmaster chided me while still managing to give me a compliment. I tipped my chin up like Snape told me to, my confidence somehow growing even just with not hanging my head .
I felt like I was in a fog. It didn't seem real that in just a few moments we would battle the darkest wizard J had ever seen.
"I don't know what you mean." I said dismissively drinking the disgusting blood replenishing potion then savoring the pain relieving one, drinking that one more slowly.
"Where are we going?" I asked, getting more concerned as we climbed the spiraling stairs round and round up through the tower.
“I regret what happened.” I winced at his sharp honesty, but he shook his head.
"Dead. You didn't kill him, but weakened him enough for Potter to kill with a single spell." He explained with a shrug. As if his entire adult life hadn't been devoted to getting rid of the monster. As if he hadn't almost died by the hands of the very same monster.
“Mine is done.” Draco announced proudly, his potion looking quite competent and the first one finished.
Defense against the dark arts had been canceled for the first part of term since we didn’t have a teacher, but after the parents got desperate enough to not have their students unprotected during a war, they finally agreed to let Lupin back in as our teacher.
The Headmaster and Minerva had started a conversation about gardening that I toned out so my focus was just on her.
“You know, it’s strange he likes ya so much. He seems to be drawn to ya.” Hagrid said watching the little bird try to get out of his cage to get to me.
He wasn't fighting this war for himself. He would have begged for mercy and his life.
"He wanted the child to have a good mother. His own was very cold and distant. I would have pampered the little brat, but I could never convince him." She said looking at him with annoyance even though he wasn't even paying attention to us.
"Ah, quite a little thief, are we?" He asked playfully, but without anger.
"I didn't realize you wanted me to. Pretty sure we have to do more than kiss for that." I said with a laugh. He smiled, kissed my cheek and went back to his cooking.
"Yes, well he paid for it heavily." He said, a bit sad remembering it. I felt my throat clench up wondering what he endured just to keep me safe.
"What took so long? You left last night." Harry said sounding honestly relieved, dragging me over to the warm crackling fire they had made camp at.
"You went through my memories." She said startled and angry in a split second. I tried to reach for her to pull her back to me and calm her, but she lurched away glaring sharply.
"Sorry." I said a bit embarrassed at having forgotten that. I was raised as a muggle so magic generally came to mind during school, not everyday life.
“You can tell I have his magic?” I asked shocked. He nodded empathetically.
Harry had told me that he thought Snape was a death eater and mean to keep his cover, but I didn’t believe that for a second. My mood was already sour from tiredness and dealing with the Slytherins bullying me on the way to class since I walked alone instead of with Harry.
"Finally, at last. I get to taste the coveted fruit. You know we have all been quite obsessed with you after your performance with Severus. It's like you draw us in, only for him to be selfish and refuse to share." He said smirking at me struggling against the two death eaters holding me against the wall.
“Sana Laxo.” I whispered tapping my wand to the potion pot. The only indicator that I had made any changes was the slight shimmer it seemed to add to the potion. I put out the fire and letting cool before making my sample bottle.
“No clue.” Snape said evenly. I focused on him and imagined him dying a thousand painful deaths.
"Have you lost your mind? Do you realize what would have happened if I didn't find you? You foolish insufferable idiot!" He yelled loudly, his voice echoing off the walls and marble.
I had to assume it was due to the empath DNA in her that made her different. Much like a Veela, people were drawn to her in a way that wasn’t logical. She was oblivious, but I had seen the envious glances from the male population and heard the horrid things they whispered after she left. I wasn’t the only one who’s mind wandered in an unsafe direction when she was around.
"It will only be a moment." He insisted, the look in his eyes bothered to a degree that I knew there was no shaking him off.
"Draco, it's me." I whispered trying to hold back my laughter at his horror. He called down when I took the cloak off so he could see me.
I wanted to argue that a monarchy was a bad idea and would silence the voices of those under its rule, but a monarchy carefully chosen to be honorable and charitable could actually help the discrimination that minorities felt. Many monarchy’s focused most of their power on civil rights violations and equitability for all citizens. They had no political stake in trying to appease the majority to win an election. They could appeal to the smaller groups as well and help create a voice where there wasn’t one.
I got up and put on his shirt since I couldn't find my dress and padded out of the room trying to find where he wandered off to. After a bit of exploring I found myself back in the dinning room where the party was.
My smile fell and I could have kicked myself for my stupidity. I had just willingly become the biggest tool for the Dark Lord that he had yet. We were supposed to be ready to kill him before that happened.
My very heart felt like it had cracked open painfully and I was sure I would never recover.
"Oh he's been positively horrible to you, hasn't he. I'm so sorry." She said groaning a bit. I debated if I should say anything, but then decided it didn't really matter at this point. The whole school thought I was a hoe anyways.
I didn’t need to hear more. I didn’t want to hear more. I just nodded and left not even saying bye. He didn’t want to share with me what he knew so I wouldn’t ask. It didn’t change my plans anyways, I was still researching ways to protect myself from the death eaters in the future. Now that I had Snape helping me I might even be able to make progress. At least I hoped so.
They took us silently to a large round room we had never been in, the ranks of death eaters closed in around us pushing us forward to the Dark Lord, who sat in a make-shift throne in the center of the room.
“What I do in my free time is none of your concern.” I said dismissively.
“I did as you asked.”
The wine was bitter, but that only complimented the pasta even more. I was in heaven in every way and I couldn't stop myself from smiling.
If he had tried to kiss me a month prior I would’ve swooned happy to have the attention. He’s not bad looking either and had filled out over the last year almost as much as Neville.
The curses continued and I realized he was trying to weaken me from blood loss. It was working. I couldn't even gasp between the curses he hurled at me furiously let alone mount a defense.
It was time.
It got dark outside before I was even halfway done and I didn’t realize how exhausted I was until I stood up to go to the next cauldron and I felt my feet buckle under me and my vision black out. I fell to my knees catching myself somewhat, the air feeling thin around me all of a sudden.
The Dark Lord finally turned around, his smile enticing on his perfectly formed lips now.
“He took notice of your strength last time you were there, yes. It was mentioned.” The headmaster admitted.
"That's surprisingly sweet." I said wishing he could have his wish. He was going to die before he could ever get what he desired. It was ironic and twisted.
"It seems you and I will have a very fruitful relationship to come." He announced the wicked thoughts he was having apparent for everyone in the room.
“Not surprised with how much crazy stuff he gets up to. Double spy and all. One of these times, he’s going to get himself killed.” Ron said having no idea how much that idea stressed me out. I didn’t even know why it stressed me out.
I was in awe of the huge panther, both in fear and amazement. It was much larger than what I ever thought and the way it growled at Lucius sent a shiver down my back. I was terrified.
I looked at the glass of wine in my hands and took a deep breath before drinking it.
"You can't tell anyone. I have enough difficulty beating off the suitors as is, not to mention the student's constant advances." He said with a mockery of seriousness.
"You forgot to chop the Lady's mantle before adding! She's paralyzed!" Draco shouted realizing what happened before I could.
"Your admires. We had so many gifts we had to use one of the store rooms." Harry said unabashedly while eating my candy. I wasn't a fan of sugar anyways so its not like I would ever eat it.
"AGH!" Harry screamed falling to his knees grabbing his scar.
“AND…and…your not thinking straight.” I said stammering loosing my focus as his hands traveled across my skin igniting a fire within me. Why was this a bad thing again?
"We want to preserve magic Hermione. The more diluted it is, the weaker it is. Is that such a bad thing? I'm not thinking of what happens in five years, I'm thinking of what happens in a hundred, thousand even. You've read the books describing the power we used to have. We are a shadow of our former selves." He explained logically. I tried to think of a way he was wrong. Discredit his theory. Yell in his face that this wasn't the right way.
"No. I can't." He said pulling me in a bit more now that I had relaxed a bit. I wanted to be angry still, but my tension was leaving me fast feeling his calmness rubbing off on me.
“Obviously. Nevermind that. You need to stop worrying about her daily activities and focus on the bigger picture of getting her to bond with you.” He advised as if I hadn’t already considered this.
“Oh no! Why didn’t you tell me? I could have covered your classes.” Minerva said quite worriedly over her owlish glasses. She always seemed to think she was my mother, which was nice at times since mine was trash. Now was not one of those times.
“Severus, she is a fun one. How long do we have before Potter shows up to rescue his beloved pet?” He asked stalking around me like a lion on his prey.
"Your robes." I said taking the death eater robes off him at the silver skull clasp quickly before he left giving himself away. He ran his hand into his hair, the stress showing. I had never seen him frazzled before so seeing his weakness was confusing. He could stand there while I was tortured senseless, but he couldn't be around me? THAT stressed him out.
“I didn’t. My moneys on Malfoy. You know the saying…the closest thing to love is hate.” He said guessing it right somehow first try. My jaw literally dropped open surprised he had figured it out that fast. He sighed seeing my reactions.
"You think I don't want you? Hermione, how can someone so brilliant be so idiotic?" He said darkly, focusing on me finally.
He was right though.
Severus took off his mask finally and took my hands seriously.
"Kill him for me." He whispered, his black eyes losing their light quickly.
“I’m sorry for barging in, I just thought…I wasn’t thinking clearly.” I said for once not being fully composed. Something about her made me loose my composure.
“I think you need to woo her Severus. You’re a ladies man, I hear about a new girl every week for you. You don’t do commitment.” He said matter of factly.
"Why?" The Dark Lord asked after a long pause seeming surprised and slightly less angry realizing I hadn't entirely disobeyed him.
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that if I were you. Miss Granger here attacked Mr. Wesley.” She said getting right to the point pushing me into the chair opposite of the headmaster firmly.
"Oh no Granger. Your secret is safe with me. There will be of course a cost." He said watching me excited at the very prospect of whatever he was going to demand. My mind went to dark places thinking of all the vile, gruesome things he could request of me and I started to regret my plan. Perhaps being tortured to death didn't sound so bad after all.
“She’s in love with Weasley.” I said angrily pacing the room again in the familiar path I took when I was stressed.
"Maybe that's exactly what I want." I said unabashed slowly unbuttoning his cloak. He looked like he wanted to stop me, but his more impure impulses took over and one of his hands trailed up my thigh under my dress.
“My…haven’t we grown up.” He said hungrily, his eyes raking me even though I was fully clothed. I used to have more curves before stress kicked in, but apparently I still had some left thankfully. He tried to reach for me, but I smacked his hand away forcefully.
“Obviously not. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t...I guess I forget you probably had other people you would rather do that to anyways.” I said with a depressed sigh deflating refusing to meet his eyes shamefully. He was just as much of an unwilling participant in Voldemort’s plans as I was. I couldn’t judge him too harshly.
"Severus would be more appropriate." I reminded her kissing her neck softly taking in her smell, her soft skin, the way she melted into my touch.
It was amazing to have that kind of power over someone, but also terrifying. What if I made bad decisions and brought him down with me? He was a key part of ending the war and if I distracted him in the wrong way he would end up ruining everything. A world with the Dark Lord as leader. It would be a nightmare.
"I suppose so. How old were you when you started taking it?" I asked, feeling slightly less guilty about our age difference now. I had sped time up, while he was stopping time.
"I'll keep it to myself. It's not like anyone would believe me anyways." I said wondering how no one had figured out who he was yet. Perhaps years of being a spy just made him that much better at hiding personal details.
"I was performing legitimacy on her. I assure you, her innocence is intact." I explained quietly.
She was too bright to lose to the dark side. I grabbed a book and threw it at her, roughly waking her up unceremoniously.
"Everything was planned. He's been five steps ahead this whole time." I said turning to the Headmaster smiling sarcastically.
We stopped when we got to a large dining room already filled with people laughing and chattering away. On the large mahogany table was a feast fit for a king with every inch covered in delicious foods that would put Hogwarts food to shame.
"Get up foolish girl. He was never going to vanquish me. Surely you knew that, right? He is a weak wizard at that. I can spare your life if you don't want to end up like him and overlook your betrayals. For a cost of course." The monster said coldly watching the scene play out without a shred of emotion.
“Who would’ve thought the rule following know it all would be so easy to corrupt?” He said clearly enjoying himself. I laughed a bit despite myself.
"Kill him and I will give you anything you want. I see the desire in your eyes for greatness. You would be a hero to our side." He said enchanting from about ten feet behind me.
“I don’t think that’s really all it is. You called me to your mind. You can deny it all you want, but I know some part of you doesn’t just think of me as another student. I saw your innermost desires.” She said softly, her tone more serious now. She was right, how could I be so weak to allow her into my mind willingly?
“Its only going to get colder. I prefer the cold honestly. I would rather sit in front of a fire reading a book than sit in front of a lake with bugs and people annoying you.” I said shaking my head. He sneered at me.
There was a black figure coming towards me quickly, a glint of light off their bone mask the only giveaway. I opened my mouth to scream, but their hand covered my mouth silencing me, my fear dying down catching the familiar musky, intoxicating scent of the death eater.
"Let's go."
I knew he had to die.
I had many unforgivable Christmases before, but that one would be the best. All day we spent together relaxing in his manor away from all the stresses of life and reality.
"I am going to die. That was the plan." He said. I stopped cold. He was behind me, but I knew he was watching me intently.
"He bought you time. Until Christmas Eve. So prepare yourself. You'll have visitors." He advised quietly pausing for a moment while a professor passed by before we resumed our trek.
What I felt for him wasn't logical, but it was there. My mind wandered back to Riddles comments about me being an empath.
Her light magic practically left from me reminding me of its presence. Of course I held some of her magic with me, but what could that do? I shook her trying desperately to wake her.
"The war is going to be intense, just remember whatever happens I will make sure you are not killed. You CANNOT let him take power. I can't guarantee he won't torture you, but he will try to kill you, and I will stop him." He warned me firmly, his eyes locking with mine trying to make sure I understood the seriousness of what he was saying.
As if he was the one to accuse someone else of becoming dark. The irony was not lost on me. Not to mention the invasion of privacy of going through my mind. He could have just asked me what happened.
"Why can't you just not anger him Severus?" She said accusingly. I started to cry with my own guilt and she gave me one last glare before picking herself up and leaving me sobbing alone.
“You.” He said softly.
"That's not all you are, it's just..." He spun on me, his anger palpable.
“Look. I’m sorry about the things I said. I was jealous. Lavender said I can be a jerk sometimes.” He said finally. I let out a snort of amusement.
"The last time we talked didn't go so well either. I'm not bringing it up." I said decisively not wanting to bother him with what I was sure was nothing. I had a whole war to worry about anyways.
The first day back was a Monday so not only did I have potions, but I had my training afterwards. I hadn't made any progress really trying to create my own spells. It was as if my magic was so used to following the rules that it just refused to disobey them.
"What was that Hermione? He is pissed. Very, very pissed." Harry said shaking a bit. I helped him back up, urgency picking up now that he knew we destroyed the horcruxes.
"Miss. Granger, you should know better than to be sneaking around outside the grounds at this time of the night. Holiday or not." He snarled, grabbing me roughly by my arm and shoving me inside. I only then realized Hagrid was outside coming to us curiously.
Draco looked at me like I lost my mind, but I also earned myself an admiring glance from Harry who just loved to see Snape suffer in any way.
"Come in Elijah, let's talk." I said kicking myself mentally and shutting the door warding it from lurkers.
"No. He's too important. He brought me back alive and sane, that's all that matters." I said wishing the world wasn't as cold as that, but it was. Not that I wanted him fired obviously.
They were sworn enemy’s but I had made them penpals of sorts sending letters to each of them pretending to be them until they stopped insulting each other and learned to be friends, then I started letting them really talk. In public it was only fighting and hatred, but behind closed doors they were entirely different. Harry actually smiled when he was around which was sadly rare for him anymore.
I wanted him to be wrong since I knew he was a horrid person, manipulative and cruel person. I wanted Dumbledore to be right and have only done the things he did out of kindness and love. That wasn't reality though. The more I thought about it, the less realistic the traditional black and white way of looking at things seemed.
"I was looking for Ravenclaw's missing diadem." I admitted taking the stairs up to the Gryffindor common room much slower than usual in my tired state.
“Ten points to slytherin for being first done. Bottle and put your sample on the table.” Snape said distractedly, not really impressed with the blonds accomplishments.
“Of course. It was his idea.” Lupin raised an eyebrow to that, but nodded.
“He’s quite a little champ eh? Who wants to hold him?” He offered taking the baby bird out.
"Yes." The confession lingered in the room, the shock quite tangible in every death eater, including Snape. I was better at this than I thought, I thought wryly to myself.
"Hermione is practicing the dark arts. It's not my foray obviously so I was hoping you could talk to her. I'm rather concerned. She's been seeming stressed lately and has been ignoring her friends. All the signs that generally lead to the dark arts." He explained. I let out an amused chuckle at his ignorance.
I was sure he was going to die. He never tried our potions. What was wrong with him?
“Exactly.” She said.
"You think Granger is an empath? There's no evidence to support that Dark Lord. She talented sure, but there would be other signs… not to mention there hasn't been one in many generations." I said shaking my head wondering if he lost it. His sneer grew in darkness and humor.
“Miss Granger! What is the meaning of this?” Professor McGonagall asked having caught sight of the drama and rushing to Ron’s defense. She glared at me accusingly when I was silent.
He chuckled a bit darkly at this, the wine clearly relaxing him.
"The Dark Lord wanted to bring you to the last meeting and he said no. You were his. Pretty sure you couldn't be claimed anymore than that." He said haughtily. I stumbled in my steps surprised he had protected me.
"Miss. Granger, will you marry me knowing I WONT die, at least not of any immediately foreseeable circumstances of course." He asked, chuckling a bit at his dark humor. I nodded, smiling sure I wanted nothing more than that.
"Of course." She smiled evenly and engaged Bellatrix in a conversation about her husband's upcoming election for minister of magic.
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” The headmaster said optimistically with his characteristic smile. I sighed and looked back to Hermione feeling my self loathing grow by the second.
"Just what? Just NOTHING. You want to steal? I will show you what happened to thief's!" His hand hit my face before I could duck to protect myself, his full force leaving a large bruise instantly. I covered my face with my hands begging him to stop so he punched my stomach next pushing the air out of my lungs.
“This is not the answer. There isn’t a spell to do that.” He said sharply.
Harry yelled with a fury I had never seen out of him before when he saw my state. He turned his wand to Snape and charged slinging every curse he could think of at the man. Snape just rolled his eyes and waved his wandless hand making Harry's wand fly into his hand and brushed away all the spells that were carelessly thrown.
"Hermione!" Harry gasped, very much alive from a few feet from me playing wizards chess with Draco. He rushed over and gave me a hug that I gingerly returned.
"Its not love. That's for sure. I'm pretty sure he was plotting my death and that's what the intensity was for." I said softly not entirely convinced that was what it was.
I could hear his footsteps coming and I hid the food as fast as possible, but it was too late.
“Any specific reason why?” He asked me curiously.
"You just stood by while I testified that I killed a man in cold blood for revenge. Your price may no longer be monetary, but I think you have been bought out nonetheless." He said quietly looking up at the wall in the elevator refusing to meet my eyes.
"Let's go. Wear something warm." He said quietly, pulling me out of bed easily. I nodded nervous about the impending death eater meeting hoping nothing too dire was requested of me.
I had to keep a level head. He was right, there was no way he would survive the war. He was a dead man walking. Even if I learned to trust him. It would be a short lived change. I would lose him anyways.
"I don't want to do wicked things to you just to abandon you Hermione." He said finally using my first name again. I smirked taking one last long drink of the wine, the liquid courage helping tremendously.
"He definitely takes care of himself. No complaints there." I said knowing I was blushing furiously remembering his well toned chest. Her eyes went wide.
"Not everyone is all good or all bad. I picked the side with the least comparable evil. I don't fight just for the Headmaster. I fight for our entire side. Freedom to marry who we want and love who we want." He said tipping my chin up gently looking in my eyes with such a depth that I couldn't look away.
"You know the rules Hermione. I can't go further until you ask for it." He said letting me unbutton his white button up shirt.
“Is that what your plan was for tonight? Corrupt Granger so you get bragging rights?” I said with amusement drinking slowly.
“Do you think he invented them?” Harry asked curiously glaring at a picture we passed that was wagging their finger at us disapprovingly.
We started the walk back with the cursed diadem slowly to get some sleep.
For a moment I could almost believe the fantasy. Us there together, happy and looking forward to a bright future together. It was so close, yet neither of us owned our own destiny. We only had that day knowing it was all we would ever have.
I was at home. I wanted to hate the death eaters and everything they stood for, but I could see myself also being happy here. A family. Light conversation that was filled with happiness. It called to me in a way that I had never expected and I knew tomorrow I would feel a deep gash knowing what I couldn't have.
The fuck.
“I suppose he learned his lesson then, didn’t he?” The headmaster said amused at my tactics relaxing weirdly relieved I wasn’t using my magic. I was just relieved he wasn’t angry and wanted to kick me out.
"Surely you jest? I would know if I was wearing a horcrux."
His body was well filled out but without being overly muscular and he had to be using some sort of potion to stop aging,  or maybe all that potion steam did him good, because he looked like he was in his twenties, not thirties. I had never considered him in any indecent way but had heard the girls gossiping quite often, even going so far as to flirt with him. Something he heavily punished yet they did anyways.
"What is this? Why would you have something cursed under your bed?" She asked, horrified. I knew the memories of the diary must have come back to her.
"Ah Professor Snape, should've known it was you out here. Always making sure everyone's indoors, are ya?" Hagrid said bearishly before his eyes caught sight of me.
“Your welcome. Get some sleep Severus.”
"Is that what this is? You're going to kiss him because I won't kiss you?" He said angrily, his hand going across my face in a split second. The feeling of his hand across my face stung sharply and I gasped in surprise.
“I see. Thank you Dobby. I learned something new today.” I said patting him kindly on the head. The other house elves excitedly jumped up and down gathering around for me to pat their heads too. I laughed and obliged them unable to deny their adorableness.
“Out. Now. You can finish your whining about  failing another class tomorrow I have business with the headmaster.” I snapped angrily shoving him out of the room and slamming the door in his face.
"That bastard needs to die. You were supposed to be for me." Ron said horrified Snape had taken his property. I glared at him unimpressed by his assessment.
“Knowing you, you probably planned this just to have a reason to continue aggravating me even more.” He snapped giving me a little shove. I smirked.
"We have to destroy all the horcruxes before the battle. I have the diadem. You have the pocket watch. I know that he has the Helga Hufflpuffs cup with him and I'm fairly sure Nagani is another one." I said, my methodical brain going through the list quite quickly. The look of shock on his face was priceless.
“You helped me when I was in a bad place finding me. I got you out of the Dark Lords grasp mostly unscathed. We are even Granger, don’t flatter yourself to think otherwise.” I said harshly. I wanted to bond with her, but the way she looked at me made my desires too hard to keep at bay. I couldn’t encourage her too much without risking hurting her. She was quiet for a moment.
“So your upset that you felt something." He said thoughtfully rubbing his beard.
The entire order was behind him ready for a fight.
“Reds fine.”
“What, have nothing smart to say now?” He asked louder with a smirk earning himself a few snickers from the Slytherins.
“In war sacrifices need to be made.” The Headmaster said sagely reading my mind without reading it.
“I’m fine.” I snapped turning the corner hoping he would get the hint. He didn’t.
"Good. The house elves will be able to make it for you anytime you wish. Just remember they want to be tipped accordingly." He advised me referring to the manor he was leaving for me on his death. The cold gold ring hung around my neck as always and I found myself fidgeting with it at the very thought.
In a weird way it almost made sense. Cold blooded death eater was his alter ego almost. A façade that he hid behind to protect himself from the terrible crimes he had to commit.
I barged in the Headmasters office without knocking my anger barely reeled in. I paced in front of his desk barely controlling myself processing how this changed everything.
In a flash Hogwarts was gone and I was at the entrance of a beautiful snow covered brick manor. It wasn't Malfoy manor, that was for sure.
“Oh no!” Neville exclaimed as his potion started emitting a black thick smoke that smelled rancid.
“Levimus.” I said again more instantly. He jerked up and down fast, but the result was nothing like Snape’s.
I screamed and tried to kick him so Yaxley and Igor stepped on my feet holding them down quite painfully.
I wanted nothing to do with anyone for the next week after Snape accused me of practicing the dark arts. I poured myself into my studies and my research for destroying the horcruxes. I couldn't find anything specifically about how to destroy them, but I had some ideas from various books that described other ancient artifacts that had been destroyed. Most normal means wouldn't work, but I did see one that was destroyed by a special kind of fire that wasn't described.
“What colors do you prefer?” She snapped her annoyance increasing knowing I wasn’t paying attention.
"Kill him." The Dark Lord hissed at me commanding me to do his bidding. I looked up at Dumbledore, horror building. This is what Snape had warned me the Dark Lord would command of me.
“Self defense.” I said uncomfortably. I wanted to yell at him YOU. I didn’t think that would go over well though. I didn’t need to verbalize it though, he seemed to understand even though I hadn’t said it and his anger eased up heavily.
I entered the common rooms eager to get out of the halls and saw everyone gathered around, faces ashen. Professor McGonagall was standing near the fire mid sentence and she stopped seeing me.
"You took it to wear it?" He said with more annoyance than anger. I looked up at him regretfully feeling the tears welling up in my eyes.
I was dead.
I didn't have a chance to react when she tipped the glass back quickly drinking it with a smile. Potter's jaw dropped open and he snatched the bottle from her before she could drink more. Her hair color left starting at the roots and going all the way down to its tips in one soft swoosh.
"You aren't dead you foolish girl. I'm just alive. You're still healing, you need to lay down." He explained calmly as if people rose from the dead all the time.
"Don't worry. I'm just kidding. If I thought for a second I would survive the war though...well you would already be quite knocked up." He confessed with a shrug thinking about it. It took me a bit to get my bearings realizing the magnitude of what he said. He had said he loved me, but I kind of figured it was the heat of the moment type thing. He was over here clearly wishing he could spend forever with me and I couldn't even say I loved him back. He didn't seem to care or need my confirmation.
"Of course not empath. You're immune to its effects. It's your bonded's magic that is controlling you. I can feel it." Tom said coolly, turning a mirror towards me so I could see my reflection.
“So you think I’ve bonded with him?” I asked unaware witches could actually bond with a wizard. He would be pissed when he realized this. If it was one thing he wanted, it was control, so for me to have bonded with him without his consent, it wouldn’t go down well with him.
“Clean all the cauldrons by hand.” He said scribbling violently on a paper he was grading taking out his annoyance on the scroll.
“I’m fine. It's best to keep my mind off things.” Granger’s laughter stood out from the sound of the rest of the great hall. She was laughing at something Potter said, her expression animated and so carefree. I was jealous, not because I thought she had feelings for her very gay best friend, but because I knew she didn’t feel that happiness around me. Nor should she.
"The stress would make you get wrinkles. You couldn't keep a rich wizard with wrinkles you know." I was saved from blowing up at her by the library doors slamming open.
"Or I could get a good job and earn my own money." I said resenting how unequal Wizarding society was. She hummed disapprovingly tapping her wand on her hand.
“A thunderbird.” I said without hesitation.
My anger from earlier seemed so foolish feeling her lifeless form in my arms. I had just wanted an excuse to give her detention, not to have her killed.
"I am a controlled person, but surely you realize how difficult it is for me to restrain myself when you do this Hermione." He warned me darkly, his eyes glazing over my body, his desire apparent.
His rooms were warm reds and old traditional furniture. Nothing like the modern traditional Slytherin house. I would have assumed he would have lots of green at least in his decoration, but it was surprisingly inviting. I carefully detached my legs from him to sneak to his kitchen to grab some food.
Snape clarified giving me a pointed look. I wasn't allowed to refuse.
"Yes. I forgive you. It's fine. All for the best really. Sitting in classes to correct the teachers isn't exactly my best choice of time spending." I said with a grin. She laughed relieved.
"Can you let us pass Professor?" I said with no small amount of snark annoyed at his existence. I wanted to hate him which was hard when he was around me making it hard to think straight. Him not existing would be wonderful. He raised an eyebrow and I realized too late he was reading my thoughts. Crap.
"I'm sorry...I shouldn't have touched it...it called to me...I wasn't strong enough to resist." I said with a choked whisper playing on the dramatics as much as possible.
“Sometimes?” He rolled his eyes but grinned at the joke.
"If I desire your heart?" I said cheekily.
My pulse sped up and I had a harder time focusing than before.
She was dressed up in a white light dress that went to her knees and fit her curves perfectly with a gold belt around the middle. Her hair was down, but she had a crown of small pink and purple flowers on her head like a tiara. She looked like a goddess to me.
“Bonding with her? She hates you Severus. Maybe you should try not insulting her for a few days if you want her to not hate you.” Minerva said with a sardonic laugh.
"A year without him trying to kill me. Refreshing." Harry said way too happy to accept the rapid change of pace.
"You use the potion yourself. That's why you look so young! You don't look a day past twenty-five." I announced with a giggle. He gave me a curt nod.
The future of what I was about to do had flashed through my mind In a flash of blinding realization. I almost hit her. I almost made her hate me with an unforgivable act of violence that she didn't deserve.
"Prince was my mother's last name."
"I thought you were a goner for sure!" Draco announced sounding entirely uncaring of my return safe and sound. Harry gave me a slightly better welcome and ran to me throwing his arms around me for the biggest hug possible.
“Neither one would tell me!” Professor McGonagall complained frustrated by our silence on the walk over.
"You truly love her, don't you?" He asked.
"Indeed. Well, she's fine, but she will need to take it easy for a few days. She seemed more upset about that then having almost died." Poppy said with a disproving risk before leaving, giving Hermione one last warning not to overdo it, even though we all knew she would ignore it.
"Volde..the Dark Lord's house?" I asked unsure since he hadn't specified. She looked at me like I was the insane one of the two of us.
“What bonding?” Minerva asked curiously looking between Granger and I having caught the way I was looking at her. I mentally cursed to myself forgetting I had included her in the muffalito spell.
A slightly easier possible horcrux was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. It had a long history of being stolen and then hidden or lost and would have attracted Voldemort since it supposedly made the wearer more powerful. I knew if my suspicions were correct, that Riddle hid the diadem here at Hogwarts. No one would go looking for a horcrux under the very roof that his greatest enemy inhabited.
"If you're going to arrest him, surely you have to tell him the charges." I said running to keep up. The skinny auror snickered a bit at this.
“Why would you do that Severus? Surely you don’t doubt his willingness to torture you?” The Headmaster chided him carefully helping him get on the sofa. I brought back the potion. And sat beside him running a few quick diagnostic spells I had studied up on for this exact sort of thing.
I gasped and he took advantage, kissing me deeply, his body pressed against mine. I knew I couldn't have gotten him off me if I tried, but I didn't want to either. He was addicting and I wanted more than just kissing. All rationality had gone out the window and my mind was ready to go all the way.
"You're saying you want me to refuse him knowing he will try to kill me and trust that you WON'T let him kill me?" I asked for clarification. He nodded.
Today has been a horrible day, I just want to sleep.
Meet me at the lake after curfew.
"Well, I suppose we best go check on her then. She should be eating breakfast right about now and I'm sure she will be quite upset." He said with a clap getting up happily leaving quite abruptly to go check on her. I followed realizing as we walked that his plans were far more thought out than I realized.
"You should know by now who you are...what you are. There isn't a spell to fix me yet. I want you to create one and do it for me." He said, his vanity evident in the obsessive way he recalled his former beauty. I couldn't blame him, I wouldn't want to look like a snake either. My mind flashed back to the countless failed lessons with Snape trying to create even the most basic of spells, and he wanted me to fix his entire body disfigurement?
"Go home Granger." He said to me again more firmly.
"You realize you're a death eater." I said plainly. I loved him, that much I was sure of. I knew though the horrible acts he had committed and I couldn't help the small worry that he was just using me. He manipulated the most brilliant wizards I had ever met and then just went about his day as if it were nothing.
"Perfect, let's give yours a try, shall we?" I snapped, grabbing a glass flask and filling it quickly with some of his beautification potion.
Instead I just felt his kiss was gross and sloppy. I pushed him away as soon as I came to my bearings. Snape had vanished in that few seconds it took me to end the kiss.
"Headmaster, you know that's not how this works. No one gets a taste of the dark arts and DOESN'T convert. They are more powerful than any drug you could take." I said shaking my head knowing it was a useless cause. He gave me a pointed look.
I was shaky from the cruciatis curse and my muscles were sore from tensing up so long, but I made it somehow. Looking around I finally found his cereal in the upper most cabinet. There was no way I could grab it with how short I was so I got up on the counter to grab it.
"How dare you? What is wrong with you?" She snapped gasping a bit for breath and shaking slightly. I felt incredibly guilty.
"It's already yours." He assured me by giving me a kiss on the cheek.
So it was just to prove a point?
By the time I got back to Gryffindor rooms we were both exhausted and ready for sleep so gave a quick hug and a goodbye.
I felt nothing bowing at his feet, my submission a normal part of life at this point. Whatever it took to stay alive.
"He was going at me, I never saw him that angry before EVER. When I told him I was gay he didn't even flinch, he just said 'obviously' so I hoped he wouldn't flip his shit too much, but DAMN. My mom had to step in to give me time to explain." Draco said shaking his head remembering his dad's blow up.
“She views you as her cold uncaring professor. You have to change how she perceives you if you want to have any chance of bonding with her.”
“I don’t want any interruptions this time.” He explained throwing the powder in the flames and calling his rooms for me. I was sure students were not allowed in professors privates rooms, but I had been in them already so I didn’t complain.
"Two." The curse that Antonin had cast on me leapt to the front of my mind, the purple streak across my chest causing a blinding pain.
Their expressions were hard and Professor McGonagall led us towards the door.
I was silent and began working trying to hold back my thoughts that threatened to overtake me in the silence of the room. I had gotten by on the loud chatter of the castle for the last few months and managed to avoid silence, but now it hit me like a freight train.
"What is this? Sterling silver melts with the incendio spell. Someone must have placed some sort of protections on it." Draco said annoyed. I hadn't thought of how to destroy it, just that I needed to get it.
I let him finish dressing me in silence, my head falling to my chest not wanting to see the room and trying to block out the comments I heard from the onlookers. Whatever trance he had put me under was entirely broken and reality seemed to settle around me. He tipped my chin up when he was finished dressing me and I could see the smallest of smiles flitter across his lips.
“Nothing.”
"Bloody hell! Get off me ghost! Be gone with you!" Draco shouted, panicked trying to push me off him and waving his arms around idiotically trying to hit his attacker but failing miserably. I put my hand over his mouth silencing him before he alerted the whole castle of our whereabouts.
"Yes. The only thing left to do is give you what you want, right?" He asked with a bit of a devilish implication. I blushed finishing my plate and drinking some more wine. The goblet filled up automatically so I had no idea how much I had drunk.
"Tipped? How?" I asked curiously.
"Mmm...you know why you're here, don't you?" He asked me silkily, the threatening nature of his anger only thinly veiled. He paced around me slowly like a lion with its prey ready to pounce.
I woke up sore from head to toe, every inch of me aching with the lingering pain from the cruciatus curse. I tried to move to get some of the soreness from my muscles out, but my eyes shot open instantly feeling a lump next to me.
“Yes, how IS she doing this Severus? I haven’t seen anything like it before. The self control is just remarkable. You know for a mudblood she is quite impressive.” Voldemort said reluctant to give me a compliment, but unable to deny how quiet I had been.
I could sense bitterness in her response, though it didn't seem to be for me. I had to assume it was for Ginny based on her attitude towards her earlier.
My mind flashed guiltily about drawing out teasing her for my own enjoyment. And hers of course. I had never seen someone so fiery fold so easily into my will. Bending at my every command so willingly. She was younger than me and far less fucked up. I had no business being around her.
He had so many different figurines and whirling contraptions it was almost like he himself had anxiety and needed them. Or maybe he kept them for students, he was so calm it was hard to imagine him having anxiety. I spun a gold wheel distracted by my own thoughts momentarily.
"Finally. I thought you had gone mad or something. I was asking if you would be so kind as to do a duel with me? I wanted to show the proper defense against the confundus charm. If you will?" He said not leaving much room for argument, waving for me to stand up. I swallowed thickly hating how everyone's attention had shifted to me.
WAKE UP, fight the paralysis!
Of course he didn't understand why I wouldn't give in to him and betray my friends. I would rather die than willingly let everyone I knew be enslaved by him.
"Good luck." Neville said as we passed. I gave him a weak smile.
"It's everything you wanted, isn't it?" I didn't have to turn around. It was the Dark Lord. I could feel his presence behind me like a dark cloud moving in.
"She looks happy." I said quietly, only looking back at Minerva after a long moment, letting the words linger.
“I understand. But you can’t use the same tactics with Granger as you would a one night stand. You have to be kind to her. Woo her.” He explained as if this should be common knowledge.
“She will forgive you.”
“The urge to do more advanced and unbound magic will only get stronger the longer she puts it off. I think learning to control the power surge she will have will be important to prevent anyone from getting hurt.” He explained kindly looking me up and down.
No need to be so fucking believable
"Of course you do. All this time...I thought my trusted servant Severus was working against me to destroy my horcruxes. I almost killed him you know?" He asked me, his smile widening at my horror realizing where this was going.
“I need to see the Headmaster.” I said curtly. Lavender perked up curious closing her magazine.
"Severus?" The massive panther had just drawn his claw back to slash Lucius across the face and kill him, but it froze, seeming to realize I was still there.
"How can they just turn a blind eye to murder! Child abuse! Its horrid. I can't believe someone can just stand by and let it happen all for money." I said disgusted at the vermin that filled this place. He smiled wryly at me closing the metal gates on the elevator taking us back out.
“Granger, you have to control the magic. In a way magic is much more alive than you or I. It needs to be tamed though, and you are its master.” He said quietly. I didn’t have time to respond.
"Severus...are you sure we should do this in his house?" I asked not sure if the Dark Lord had some sort of monitoring setup or something. It was the creepy thing he would do. Severus hummed against my skin and stopped for a moment confused.
His smile was light and genuine like it had been at his manor and it was only then that I realized how dark the cursed pocket watch had made him.
"I don't want to be without you and Azra." He said giving me a hug relishing the complete feeling I had hugging him.
"That's a pity. Unfortunately in war there are sacrifices." The Headmaster said only glancing to me for a brief moment.
"Who's this?" He said not unkindly peering at me over his glasses thoughtfully.
I skipped all classes the next few weeks between the rampant gossiping and wanting to avoid him. The Headmaster asked me to pull out of the classes and become one of the teachers' apprentices anyways so it wasn't like my Professors should care about my attendance anyways. I couldn't decide who I wanted to apprentice with, but both Professor McGonagall and Lupin had offered.
“Ow! Okay women. Bloody hell.” He said gruffly, still following me like an obedient puppy. We walked in a quick silence for a while and I assumed we wouldn’t talk at all which was fine by me until he broke the silence.
I started to come around feeling weak but at least well rested. My body was desperate for some food after being starved for entirely too long. I opened my eyes and to my surprise I wasn't in my bed. Snape was sleeping at the end of the couch, his head on his chest looking quite powerful even asleep.
“I will consider it. Your advice is helpful as always.” I said finishing the hot chocolate and giving him his cup back, my hands shaking slightly less now.
This ring is my mother's. It opens the door to my home, a place I always wanted filled with laughter and happiness, even if the laughter won't be my own. It will also open my vault. Every moment I spend with you I find my breath taken away by your beauty, inside and out. I know you will one day find your true love that will feel the same for you and will give you the future you desire.
"You can feel his magic? Bonded to an empath? Surely you don't mean...I'm not an empath. I create spells, yes, but I can't control magic." I said finally getting my thoughts away from my own reflection to focus on what he was saying.
"NO." He looked almost as surprised as I felt hearing myself tell him no.
I would ignore him next time I saw him. I would be strong. I had to forget him. It couldn't be that hard, could it?
"R.R." Draco said once class dismissed coming over to us once we were the only ones left in the room. It was our code for room of requirement that we made incase there were nosey students lurking around d us.
I loved it. It was so perfect for me, it was as if it was designed just for me. I walked along the bookshelves touching the old tombs, letting my fingers drift over them and smelling the crisp parchment that they contained.
"My Lord, I would never disobey you." I pleaded with him. He smirked evilly before ripping open my shirt with one swoop exposing my bare chest.
As if I could sleep with her on my mind. I knew it would be a long restless night so I poured myself some more whiskey ready to be drunk at least so the guilty feeling stung slightly less.
I couldn't imagine raising a daughter just like me. It would be the ultimate payback for all my troublemaking.
"Oh? It would have to be Prince potions with how big this place is." I said with a laugh shaking my head. He was silent for a long moment.
I didn't expect him to jump at my offer so quickly, but it was like every part of him had been just waiting for me to be ready.
He knew nothing of love.
I indulged in the pain and let it consume me. I didn't have the love of my life anymore. I was alone and it was all my fault. I had doubted him and wasted precious time we could have been enjoying together letting him be mad about such a stupid thing.
"You can't be seen in that. These guys are creeps." Snape said, releasing me instantly, his eyes grazing me over in an not appropriate way for the first time since the lake talk. My clothes had become messed up in the spin and my shirt was showing more than what I typically allowed.
"Explain? What could you possibly have said that would have helped?" Harry asked surprised.
“It’s no fun if she doesn’t scream.” One of the death eaters said depressed. I didn’t recognize his voice, but then again everything was like I was viewing someone else’s life now, not my own.
I took the cloak off when I got a few feet from him and he instantly spun around with his wand out and a curse on the tip of his tongue.
"That's sweet of you to make sure they get what they want."
"Hermione!" Ginny yelled, running to me and giving me a big hug.
“He’s not bad looking at all.” I mused thinking of how fast he had gone from plump kid to chiseled with a little help from puberty over the last few years.
“Maybe. Its just…Professor Snape won’t talk to me, but I just have this bad feeling.” I said with a sigh. The gold wheel only kept my attention for a few moments before I moved onto a tiny silver bowl of balls that stuck together.
"Severus, please be serious. I can only turn a blind eye to your behavior so many times. We can't have you going off being a vigilante making yourself jury, judge, and executioner. We have the legal system for a reason." The judge said impatiently. Severus snorted in humor.
"You realize now he will want you to spy on me…right." Harry said sharing a concerned glance with me.
“What? I didn’t use my magic! I used my fist!” I said indignantly holding up my bruised and quickly swelling fist. Even I wasn’t that stupid to use magic when so angry. He had the audacity to chuckle at this once he recovered from his shock.
"Ah, my two favorite people. The reckless Gryffindor and the betraying idiot." He said, his anger evident despite his smile.
"Severus mentioned the events of last night. You don't have to stay for class if you need some time alone." She said kindly after a moment.
"Who's house?"
Granger.
Harry poked her in the side and got her attention again and just like that the feeling was gone. Her smile returned and it was only then that I realized it was fake.
"Everyone out!" Draco shouted, startling me out of my reverie with a sharp jolt. I was to her side in an instant the panic hitting me full force. She wasn't breathing, her eyes were closed as if dead and she was limp when I lifted her up a bit.
I normally didn’t allow that kind of touching since it would lead in directions that I wasn’t ready for, but something about how he was holding me made me stay. I felt safe, secure, like I could finally relax even if only just for a few hours and knew he would have my back. I drifted off so fast I didn’t have nearly enough time to savor the feeling as I sunk into dreamland.
I expected him to be beside me when I woke up, but I was alone in the large bed. I took the chance to look around his rooms wondering how I could have missed it being his. It was exactly reminiscent of his Hogwarts rooms. They were warm and inviting in the best of ways. Opposite of the bed was large bookshelves filled with books that had to be hundreds of years old.
All at once he was gone and I was freed, collapsing to my knees in shock.
“How did you get one?” I asked curiously knowing they were extremely rare.
"Thanks Sev. I'm sure it's just her curiosity getting the best of her." He said a bit lighter trying to convince himself as much as me.
What I was really interested in was healing though so I was debating asking Madame Pomfrey for an apprenticeship instead. Rather than bother with that, I hid out in the library and studied healing on my own just wanting to be alone.
“He has a few he has used around me. I haven’t found them in any book though.” I said not having really paid much attention to it before now. It was really peculiar he had so many spells he used that I had never heard before. Half the time he just flicked his hand and didn’t even say anything aloud casting magic effortlessly. I think the only time he actually verbalized them was when he was distracted with something.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know you would drink it.” I blurted out suddenly feeling so guilty. He just chuckled.
"Yes. It's odd. Only one has been destroyed, and I know Dumbledore did it. Yet the other one was simply moved. Perhaps to use." He said, his thoughtfulness giving way to a happy smirk.
"Hermione, wait!" I called after her trying to follow her, but she was gone.
She looked the epitome of happiness. How could she be anything but happy?
"Severus." I stopped, the name sounding so foreign coming from her.
“You need to eat. Lord knows if you die everyone will blame me even though its your own idiotic fault.” He said with an annoyed sigh leaving momentarily to get me something from his drawer. A granola bar. I took it hesitantly wondering what the chances of him killing me with poison would be at Hogwarts itself.
"I was supposed to get to choose. I wasn't yours." I snapped irritated moving to push past him.
"That's just for me to know. You can't judge too harshly anyways. You've been playing with time quite a bit anyways yourself." He admonished me playfully. I wanted desperately to know his actual age, but didn't push things. I had used the time turner so much the ministry of magic had recorded my age as nineteen. Most of the extra time was spent studying which wasn't an approved use of the time turner. The headmaster thought I had returned mine in third year, but I had kept it just in case, and used it more than what I should have.
Malfoy's house was grand and had exquisite marble everywhere we walked. I didn’t have time to process. I was at the feet of Voldemort in seconds of coming in, thrown in a heap like garbage being tossed to the curb.
"Who else would we have to correct Professor Binns on the war of 1103 between the goblins and witches?" She asked me relaxing.
“I’m not his toy. I was doing detention.” I snapped annoyed at his vulgarity. He smiled and looked me up and down vulgarly, his blond hair shorter than before. If he wasn’t a death eater and horrible human being I might have been flattered
I rushed back down grabbing my own cloak and nodding to the boys.
"Severus. Hold on. I will figure something out!" I said panicking sure I could save him. He reached up and touched my cheek shakily, his warm hand growing cold.
“Oh, you think your funny, don’t you?” He snapped.
"I didn't want the magic from the ring to interfere with the healers spells. I think it's time I do this properly anyways." He explained getting down on one knee making my already overpowered heart stammer.
"My Lord. It's...it's in my pocket." I breathed weakly. I pulled out the pocket watch showing him it, the silver heirloom falling to the ground, my hands had seemed to lose their grip.
He threw me down at the feet of the Dark Lord, the room filled with a ring of death eaters all wearing masks and waiting with anticipation.
"Please. Let me finish." He asked me, showing an uncharacteristic vulnerability. I was angry and hurt and wanted to punch him in his face, but nodded reluctantly.
The thought was hilarious. Here I was sure I was totally incompetent with everything in life and the darkest wizard ever felt nervous with me touching him scared I would try to kill him most likely.
“Of course.” He said with a sigh.
"Of course. You have a whole monarchy to plan." I said with a snort of amusement at the thought of him trying to create a whole new government system by himself. I was sure Dumbledore would help, but he was the brains of their plan it seemed.
"I know you have Severus's darkness. It calls to you. Beckons you. To use his power without fear...I know you want it." He said quietly, his voice barely more than a hiss.
He responded back drinking his whisky, swirling it absently not even looking at me. It made sense, but I had never considered them just having normal festivities. I assumed they met for rally's and that was it. Looking around the room I could see what he meant. They were exceptionally close, the casual laughter and feeling of warmth in the room was infectious.
It called to me, like a siren, beckoning me to put it on. I had always thought I was the strongest person I knew, but the dark magic I held onto from Snape was far more mischievous and I felt a smile come over my face that wasn't entirely my own.
I glanced over the article, but got the main gist of the scandalous article quickly. The picture itself was pretty self explanatory. It was of Granger and I staring into each other's eyes. My fingers were tipping her chin up to look in her eyes to read her mind.
I wanted him to make it through this war so we could enjoy a future together, not just passing moments. He seemed resigned to the fact that he would die, but I knew I had to find a way to save him. I didn't want to spend my life with someone else. I wanted to spend it with him.
"Ignore her, she suffers from a poor memory. I plead guilty." He said, giving me a glare to shut up.
"Granger, surely you must join in the festivities. Please, drink up!" Voldemort said with what could almost be misconstrued as a smile. I took the fancy goblet nervously glancing to Snape to make sure it was safe. He nodded, but I could tell it wasn't just wine in the goblet. It was spiked with something, I just wasn't sure.
I didn't go to him or try to make up for the horrid things I said. I had been entirely selfish while he had been absolutely self less thinking only of me.
“Not yet, but I should have something soon. I was actually in the middle of something Lucius.” Snape said tersely drinking his whiskey quickly from what I could see. Lucius seemed to finally notice me slumped against the cauldron still gathering myself from almost passing out. His excitement was almost tangible seeing me.
“My mind princess. Your just a figment of my imagination. A beautiful. Wonderful. Enlightening figment.” I said brushing her hair behind her ear . She smiled, but not as brightly as I expected.
This life isn't my own to live, but with my actions I hope one day you will get to enjoy yours to the fullest. I can't give you myself as we both know where the future will take us, but I can give you everything else you desire.
"I have no idea what you mean." I said honestly watching him hating myself for actually being curious. He laughed maniacally, his humor as fake as his body.
I hadn't seen Snape all day, maybe he had gotten out of having to bring me. I wouldn't know and didn't really care. I went outside by the lake and sat in the snow after casting a warming spell on myself so I wouldn't freeze to death.
"You see my faithful servant. I have noticed changes in you. Your temper has been more erratic lately. I can feel her energy pulsing around yours not mingling, just dancing with it taunting me. The moment she came of age I knew she was one." He said reaching out to touch me but stopping just short. I knew some wizards could feel power, but he had never admitted he was one. It made sense now why he was obsessed with purity. People who could feel the power usually became obsessed with it, feeling the many varieties and temperaments of magic.
"Indeed. What do you want this time?" I asked, meeting his disapproving glare with one of my own. He smiled evilly taking pleasure in my defiance.
He sat on his throne and took a drink from his goblet thoughtfully watching me unsure of how to proceed clearly. The emblem on the goblet stood out to me.
He grabbed me by my waist and put me on the ground ending my height advantage for the argument. He had only done so to grab me by my coat and shove me into the bookshelf hard enough to cause some books to fall off.
"So you see the signs too? I was sure I was mistaken, but I tried to perform a basic spell on her and in a split second my magic evaporated. Her expression was entirely blank, it wasn't like she was shocked to see it vanish. I think she's practiced before." He said with a sad sigh. Hermione. My Hermione. I couldn't let her go.
Snape moved past him with a curt nod and was gone.
If I didn't know he had several more horcruxes I just might have tried also.
"Well, you truly are oblivious, aren't you. Surely he told you where we are, didn't he?" She said with a wry laugh. I shook my head looking around.
Large amounts of power
I opened my eyes looking around gaining my bearings and seeing white everywhere. White sheets, white walls, white clothes draped on my body. I was in the hospital wing.
"You are the only person I know that organizes their trunk. Just really! Your socks are actually matched! What kind of voodoo is that?" She asked jokingly, distracted from her original intention and just going through my things now.
"I need to fatten you up. You're nothing but skin and bones. You can't carry my baby like that." He said squeezing my side playfully. I choked a bit on my food remembering what Bellatrix said.
"I can talk to her. In my mind. At first I thought it was legimancy related, but then I realized I don't have to look in her eyes to do it." I said quietly wondering why I hadn't thought more of it.
Snape appeared in front of me, the invisibility charm he had used fading away as his body slumped forward.
"Think you're so clever, don't you? Think you're going to kill me, eh? Well guess what mudblood. You missed one. And you will never. Ever. Find it. My most trusted servant has kept it safe all this time. I'm still immortal, while you...you are not my pretty." He said stopping mere inches from me. My eyes widened realizing what had happened.
I gasped a bit and felt the overwhelming pain fire up every nerve as I gained my bearings.
Minerva caught who I was watching with a fresh wave of pent up annoyance.
This was only the beginning of what he would ask me to do.
“Oh, Severus. How we have fallen? I expected better from you. Yet clearly you have feelings for the girl.” He said twirling his wand, the threat of torture or death lingering. I swallowed thickly bringing my emotions back in check.
"If you won't tell, neither will I." I said softly. That was all he needed to hear. He kissed me pulling me back to him hard, but this time thrusting into me. I felt myself gasp in surprise, but he refused to let me out of the kiss continuing to move me against him and fuck me slowly.
"If I may My Lord. She is generally more receptive to torture." Snape said stepping forward from the ranks. My anger turned towards him, seeing his cold expression watching Harry die.
"Voldemort?" I asked quietly, digesting everything very slowly.
“I can smell her on you.” It shouldn’t have been such a terrifying statement, yet it was. I fidgeted with my wand absently debating how to respond.
“What Miss. Granger? All talk and confidence, yet scared of me? Its almost like you like playing with fire more than you will admit.” He said darkly, the lack of space between him and I taking my oxygen away. His hand went to my face and I flinched back expecting him to hit me, but he gently ran his fingers down my cheek instead. I closed my eyes instinctively and let the sensation wash over me.
"The Headmaster is alive?" I said thickly, my mind finally slowing down enough to grasp what was going on.
"Why do you think that?" He asked curiously. I bit my lip nervously not wanting to confess about the horcruxes knowing he would tell Harry.
"You took a contraceptive potion, right?" She asked more seriously. Every single thought in my mind stopped in that very moment. Her eyes couldn't possibly have gotten any wider.
It seemed I wasn't the only one who had enjoyed the day, minus the whole getting arrested thing of course.
The statement hung in the air thickly. It was impossible. She wouldn't study the dark arts let alone perform them on a teacher. She wasn't that stupid, was she?
The little bird squeaked up at me and nuzzled me fondly.
"You have utterly failed. Congratulations Potter. You get a zero." He groaned loudly and whispered some apologies to Hermione who just giggled and looked at her hair amused.
"As if." I said sure I would not ever end up in his bed, let alone expecting his child. The thought was so humorous I found myself laughing despite myself. Voldemort heard it and smiled pleased I was enjoying myself and I was finally relaxed enough I didn't even care.
“Winnefred.” Harry said to the fat lady going into the warm Gryffindor common room thoughtfully. Ginny was still waiting up reading a book and brightened up seeing us.
By dinner time I was eating my Yorkshire pudding in peace happily ignoring her existence and drinking down the whisky in my goblet feeling the stress of the week leaving.
"I think the Dark Lord killed your father Severus." I said hesitantly. He had the slightest smirk and he leaned on the counter opposite of me folding his arms.
“Were you sick?” Minerva asked worriedly, always sticking her nose where it doesn’t belong.
"She has enough credits to graduate. I hardly teach her anything of use. Oh by the way. She was the one who created the potion to fix your hand. Not me." I snarled angry motioning to his now healed hand. I didn't understand how he was turning his back on her so quickly. She would be devastated.
I wouldn’t live past the war though. Even in my dreams, I wasn’t there. She was there, alone. Happy without me.
"What's going on in here?" Poppy said rushing back in with Potter just to see Hermione sitting up shakily, dirty from the floor but alive.
"POTTER! WHAT THE FUCK...nevermind, come here girl." He said grabbing me roughly evidently just realizing Harry wasn't dead. I fought against him, but he dragged me, throwing me at the feet of Dumbledore, who was bound by what looked like thick green snakes around his hands and his feet. He was floating in the air suspended, but he was calm even as he faced his death.
I thought back hoping he would get the message somehow. His back was to everyone so I was the only one who could see his face under the mask, but I was still stunned when he smiled amused. He never smiled. Something about the way he pulled me up closer to him and looked down at me daring me to challenge him changed my entire mindset in an instant.
She took a deep gasping breath and looked around stunned, her color slowly coming back to her.
I was sure I was in one of my nightmares. She couldn't be lifeless on the floor pale as death not breathing. Not my Hermione. It wasn't real, I was sure of it.
"You're not dead yet Hermione." The soft words startled me in the loud screaming curses and hexes from the two sides.
I smirked at her quitting my head and folding my arms realizing I quite liked the look actually.
Yet she was going to survive. He couldn’t kill her, because he knew he would loose me. He needed me. My voice vanished as I screamed under the intensity of the pain until it was a soundless scream. I had only ever seen him torture someone so horribly once before, and it didn’t end well.
"How would you know Severus? Your magic is almost as dark as his." My reply lingered and his amusement died down a bit realizing I was right.
"No. He's a maniac, he always thinks someone is out to get him. I mean, usually someone is, but it's Christmas for heaven's sake. Who would go pissing him off today?" Draco brushed off his leader's sanity. I gulped hoping that's all it was, paranoid mania.
"Let's go raid the kitchens. This popcorn isn't nearly enough for a growing baby. You need some real food." Ginny joked rubbing my stomach playfully. I sighed, but smiled waving my hand, sending all my books back to their shelves, feeling my mood pick up since I had my best friend back.
"Nevermind him. So did I tell you what Longbottom was doing while I was…" I zoned out of the rest of the conversation, my mind taken over by thoughts of what Voldemort's plan could be now. I seemed to be apart of it, but why?
"So...umm...what exactly happened?" She asked blankly. My mind stammered at this.
I packed up my things to head to lunch over the day already, and the worst was yet to come still. I had to deal with Snape from two until it was almost time for bed, and he had ignored my existence for the last week after giving me my Christmas present, so I didn't expect that to go good. Life couldn't get worse.
“Ow! What was that?” She asked groggily, waking up and looking around getting her bearings.
"Minnie is not exhausted. Minnie is tired of doing nothing all day. Minnie wanted to see Mister's friend which Minnie cannot do from bed." She said, giving me a smile quite happy with me, but giving Severus a glare. He returned the glare evenly.
"That too was his plan. Force me to cross that line he knew I would never cross. He knew I wouldn't be a bastard like the other guys and that would only spur her to bond faster." I said finally seeing the brilliance of his plan. It was a beautiful plan. The headmaster shook his head slowly thinking over the details also.
"Is that so? Well it's clear to me that the law only applies to those that don't hold a seat on the election board that keeps you in power. Finnely was one of your staunchest supporters and part of the reason you were elected, was he not? Clearly the law doesn't apply to him." Severus said silkily, his voice so smooth it could cut ice. The judge's jaw dropped a bit and he stammered for words shuffling his papers.
After what felt like forever I took a deep breath and pushed my racing thoughts away needing to focus on getting back to Snape. I tried to wind my way through the many halls, but every time I was sure I was in the right place I would end up back where I started. It was like they were enchanted to keep me lost.
"Let me have this one night Miss. Granger." He said formally, leading me to the table. The meal was an Italian pasta in a beautifully sweet red sauce, one of my favorites and something they never served at Hogwarts.
“I never felt…I could literally feel my magic that time.” I said bewildered. He raised an eyebrow to this surprised at my statement.
“Not one that was good looking. It’s a good thing too, I was starting to wonder if I wasn’t straight or something. Definitely straight.” She teased with a smirk. I released her abruptly realizing where she was going with that.
I reached out to pet him, but in a flash the panther was gone and replaced by a very angry Snape.
We were almost to the room when Snape came down the hall, his dark mood evident before he even got to us. He didn't acknowledge Harry or Ron, he looked me up and down seeming to take in my stress from the day. He stopped in front of me not letting me pass, the musky scent he had taunting me.
She looked up at me with wide brown eyes looking quite terrified. Good.
"None. Some are pretty severely injured and still at St. Mungos, but Voldemort seemed unwilling to kill them and risk killing you before he was done with you, and your curse only seemed to affect certain people. It was out of control. Yet perfectly controlled." Harry explained grabbing some of the chocolates that were left on the table next to me. It was filled to the brim with gifts and candy.
"I used to fight just to make it to the next day alive. Now, I fight for you." He said, his voice barely above a whisper. He leaned in and kissed me, soft and longing, his emotion felt entirely by me. My hands came up around his neck and I unclasped the pocket watch in a quick motion. He drew back surprised, but amused.
Professor McGonagall looked at me quizzically, but stopped seeming to understand I couldn't go without doing this.
"Why save Harry? Is it because you loved his mother?" I asked remembering Harry said they were close during school. He shook his head.
