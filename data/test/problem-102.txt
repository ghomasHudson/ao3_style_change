“How can you ever have thought that, Harry?” Draco’s face is cracked open by a bright kind of pain, and Harry finds that he can’t remember how to breathe. “I loved you so much. I loved you more than life itself. It wouldn’t have hurt so much if I hadn’t loved you with everything I had.”
"My colleague Ermelinda already did when I first saw them. She’s pretty good at diagnostic spells too. She couldn’t find a magical signature. We couldn’t come up with a counter-spell either, as you can see.”
PS: I don’t think Pansy’s very happy. She says you’re to bother Blaise. Something about stopping him from making the worst decision of his life.
Draco pushes inside, and the entire world melts away until there is only the sensation inside Harry, pulsating and warm and entirely overpowering. Draco stills, his cock entirely sheathed inside Harry, and Harry shuts his eyes, covers them with white-jointed fingers pressing against his eyelids because it’s too much, that feeling. It’s too much for him to bear, too much for his body to contain. Draco pries them away gently.
Draco nods and cries and doesn’t say anything else. Harry kisses his hair, then slowly lets his arms fall to his sides and takes a step back. Draco doesn’t look at him.
He pulls you into his bedroom and pushes you onto the bed and you don’t resist. Every cell of you is alive with the sight of this beautiful boy, every inch of your skin is singing from his touch. You run your hands all over his body, and your mouth, and your tongue. You pour everything you feel for him into working him open. He moans and writhes under you and it fills all the holes in your chest.
In the upstairs conservatory, he finds Draco sitting cross-legged on the floor, a mess of glowing lines and figures around him and suddenly,
They’re in each other’s arms. How did this happen? It doesn’t matter. Draco’s skin is fire-soft; Draco’s hair is ember-bright. The fog in Harry’s chest turns to woodsmoke as Draco trails a warm tongue on the side of his jaw.
There are nights when feelings drain away from you entirely, and the world turns monochrome, all cotton-wool and wrapping foam. There are nights when you feel so empty you can’t believe anything would ever fill you up. You feel so empty you wish the fire ants were back in your veins. You feel so empty you want to claw at your skin until you see your blood, until you’re reassured that it’s still there, that you’re still alive. And you can’t remember how to exist anymore. You can’t remember how to be human, how to smile or how to cry. All you know is the pulsating emptiness behind your ribs and the unbearable feeling of loneliness and pain, and you can’t live like this, you can’t.
Then, they’re both naked, and the contact of Draco’s skin on Harry’s is electrifying and they crash together again like magnets or tectonic plates.
That evening, Harry has spent hours slowly meandering through picturesque streets and beautiful little shops, has gotten coffee and soaked by two separate rainstorms, and has spent several hours sitting on jagged rocks and staring at the sky while the splash-cold sea lapped at his feet and covered his skin in white-scrub salt. He’s seen people too: families and off-season tourists, shopkeepers and innkeepers and casual sailors stepping off white boats, but no one with starlight hair or quicksilver eyes.
Harry’s voice echoes in the hallowed space like a gunshot, violent and loud and entirely out of place. Iris’ features harden and she furrows her brow.
“You think you’re so smart, don’t you, Malfoy?” you spit, and you can feel the tension between you, and you can taste the hate and the violence in the air. (You are entirely drunk on it.)
“I’d like you to give both,” Harry smiles as he stops in front of the front doors. “But informed consent is important. I want you to agree with my vision for the place.”
Harry walks back to the inn. He crawls into bed and tries to forget he’s awake and breathing and alive.
I’d take your finger into my mouth. Suck it gently until your breath turns uneven and your skin turns hot.
“We’ll need a full list,” Ron says. “But this is good, it really is. From there, we can narrow down who had both motive and opportunity and we can figure out who did this.”
“I didn’t tell anyone,” Harry replies. The words are fragile and quiet between them, now. Their voices careful, their bodies still. Neither dares to move or breathe or speak too loud, afraid that it might break the spell, this blissful island of calm and warmth among the infinite ocean of pain and grief that somehow became their lives. “I couldn’t, you know? It hurt too much, coming back. I couldn’t bear to even think about it. I couldn’t bear to think I got to come back when Remus and Tonks and Fred didn’t get the chance, not when I wasn’t sure I even wanted to live.”
Harry didn’t realise how much it hurt him, at first, as he loved Draco through sleepless nights and cold shoulders. He told himself it didn’t matter if Draco never said
I try not to think of how distraught Pansy was yesterday because I can’t entirely bring myself to believe this man, however disagreeable I may find him, is the type to be running an illicit potion trade, which means I have no lead on her case.
“I want you inside me,” he whispers into the crook of Draco’s neck as his roughshod fingers work open Draco’s trousers. There is something, dancing at the back of Draco’s eyes when Harry leans in to kiss him. Something hotter than the sun and sharper than flint. (Something dangerous and bright, like fire or hope or desire.) When they kiss, it’s urgent and rough, and the lightning in Harry’s chest spills out entirely, in bright-burn arcs. Harry places a careful hand between Draco’s legs, stroking at the hardness through the fabric with infinite reverence. It steals his breath from him, that Draco wants him.
Draco’s words go straight through your chest. He’s always shown you his own mask, you realise, and you haven’t noticed because you’ve been so worried about protecting yourself, because you’ve been so worried about painting yourself in all the appropriate lies that you’ve never stopped and considered the possibility that he was doing exactly the same. You feel defeated. You’ve done all the right things, and you’ve taken all the risks, and you’ve opened yourself up—and still, it might not be enough. (What if you still can’t let go of the armour you’ve worn your entire life? What if you still can’t heal?)
Grimmauld Place is dark and empty, and the loneliness of it sits heavy in my chest as soon as I’ve stepped foot on the old flagstone floor. I have no idea how I am going to make it through another night of not seeing Draco and I have no idea how I’ll survive seeing Draco again. I’m about seven coffees into not thinking about it when the Floo blares open.
It might have ended there, reader, but it doesn’t because in the aftermath of the explosion Draco Malfoy comes out of his shop.
Then, every ghost is speaking at once, assuring Harry of their consent and talking excitedly among themselves about how it will feel to share their space with the living once again.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” he concludes after a solid hour. He’s done countless spells, he’s taken my pulse, and my temperature, and a vial of my blood. “Everything is perfectly fine.”
I think I could find a man beautiful no matter what he looks like, but if we’re talking about purely physical criteria, my ideal partner would probably have dark hair. Striking eyes. A gorgeous smile. I imagine he’d be quite muscular, too. The type of muscle you get from an active lifestyle, mind you, not the type you get from the gym. More importantly, he’d have to be kind. He’d have to be able to remind me to be brave when I’m not. I think I’d want him to be passionate too. Able to learn from me and teach me new things in turn. It would definitely have to be someone I could talk to, about everything. Someone I could trust blindly and who would know how to make me feel loved.
We make small talk as he works. I learn he doesn’t have any children although he would want some in the future and that he dedicates all his free time to this shop until he can find a suitable girl to marry and settle down. I hum a vague sort of agreement. For all his commitment to his business, I can’t help but feel slightly ill at ease. It’s not something that I can pinpoint exactly, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to settle down, but he’s using turns of phrases that remind me of how people used to talk before the war and it’s apparently enough to make me feel faintly sick. I tell myself that it’s perhaps just that I am not yet at the point in my life where I can imagine a future that isn’t just another version of the present.
For a long time, no answer appears. Then, later that night, I feel my shin grow warm. It’s almost time for bed then and I’m sitting in the soft light of my bedroom, listening to the wireless and absentmindedly stroking Freya, my favourite kneazle
Harry hesitates for an instant. It was not supposed to go like this, Draco was supposed to be at the door, and Harry was going to tell him that he loved him, and that he couldn’t live without him, and that he was tired of not fighting for the things that mattered. He knows he shouldn’t tell Draco’s mother any of this, not when she’s standing in the doorway like a Greek statue, beautiful and dignified. Not when the truth is messy and painful and shaped like a secret you lock away behind your ribs and never speak of again. But Harry’s come this far, and lies have been eating holes in his chest like worms for years, so he answers:
That night, when Harry slips underneath the crisp cotton covers, he thinks the man might have been a powerful legilimens too, from the way he smiled and winked and always seemed to know exactly what Harry wanted to say.
Nott is silent for a little while and massages the bridge of his nose, standing in the makeshift examination room. I stare at the passé flowered wallpaper and try to think of what I could say to convince him to look again, to look harder.
Fuck you. Fuck you for making me feel like I do. Fuck you for making it impossible for me not to love you when you went a rejected me. Rejected me, Harry. Do you have any idea how that feels? I loved you so much. I loved you. I still do. I can’t stop loving you. [words angrily traced.]
(Because this is the thing about words: they make things real. And you’ve been thinking about what happened in indefinite articles and vague terms since yesterday, you’ve been carefully avoiding naming it, defining it, describing it, for fear that you might make it unforgettable. And still, it is all you can think about.)
At these words, Iris swoops down until her ghostly face is almost touching Harry, her eyes wide and bright under her line-thin eyebrows.
Her face turns serious, as she draws her small dark mouth into a pout. Harry thinks she looks like the star in a silent film, with her carefully applied makeup and the way she flickers in black and white in the stillness of the room.
has stepped in and agreed to beta the rest of this fic. Her input and her kind words of encouragement have been invaluable from the very beginning, and I certainly wouldn't have written as much without her reliable presence in the sprint channel on discord. Thank you for making it all happen.
His father broke the silence the day before he was due to leave. Draco was in the library, trying to find some works on time travel to understand what exactly was going on when Dobby had called for him. His father was waiting for him in his study. Draco remembered the upcoming conversation from the first time round, he was told to always maintain the Malfoy name in public and to never let his guard done. He was also told that Harry Potter would be in his year and that he should stay far from him.
The thought of younger, well older Draco calling Hermione a mudblood mad his skin prickle, she hadn’t deserved that. No muggleborn deserved it and perhaps this time round he could be better, if nothing else. He could treat Hermione Granger better.
“Well, Godfather. I saw it in a book, before arriving at Hogwarts, in the main library at home. I had just gotten my wand and wanted to practise some magic, and well I practised the wand movement and incarnation at home. Of course it never worked in the manor. I suppose when I saw what damage the troll could do I panicked and it was the first useful spell that came to my mind. Trust me I am just as shocked as you see that it actually worked.” Draco rambled out, trying to keep some Malfoy composure.
As soon as he heard the words he sprinted toward the second floor girls bathroom. His head was pounding - his mind yelling at him, repeating. She can’t die. She can’t die. She can’t die.
The one thing Draco never let himself think about was his time in Azkaban, he had only been there for two months but even that was too many. It had been one of the worst experiences of his life, and that was saying something. Draco had gone through torture and assault, cursed by his own father and family, been deluded enough to take the dark mark and had had a mass murder live in his house. Draco knew that he had been a horrible, slimy git and deserved everything he had done to him. His time at Hogwarts had been ruled by jealousy and hatred towards himself and others, his time at him had been ruled by manipulation and sneering from his father.
“Oh sorry.” Of course it was Potter. “Oh hi, Draco. I didn’t know if anyone was in here but I’m glad it’s you. I was going to look for you on the train but I guess I won’t have to now I’ve found you. I’m sorry for rambling, can you tell that I’m nervous ?”
“Draco.” Hermione starts, “I just wanted to thank you, again. What you did was amazing, you’re so powerful it’s incredible really and you saved my life.”
Draco had barely been paying attention to the match, and definitely wasn’t watching Potter throughout so he didn’t really understand what Hermione was talking about. However he somewhat remembered Potter having difficulties the first time round but the boy not being able to control his nimbus was hardly cause for concern and he really didn’t see how it was relevant.
The welcome chill of November continued until the opening match of the season. Potter’s first quidditch game. Draco somewhat remembered the event, he had jotted down in a notebook when he first woke up in the past. His hand writing scribbled about Gryffindor winning the match after the boy had caught the snitch - Draco remembered being sure that if he was deemed for Slytherin there would be no way Gryffindor would have won that match. His notebook was detailed with every little event that Draco could remember, he had seven different books for each year at Hogwarts and would carry his frost year one with him. At time he would suddenly remember a detail that happened, and event that had occurred and rushed to fill in the pages.
This definitely didn’t happen last time. Potter didn’t smile at him last time, he hadn’t spoken to him for this long last time. He hadn’t asked for his name last time.
“We aren’t sure.” Hermione stared, “But I know what I saw. Plus, Harry’s broom worked perfectly after I distracted Professor Snape.”
Hi guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the support again :) Also, I feel like this chapter took longer to get out then usual (sorry!), I started my summer job again - it’s full time and is absolutely draining :(
Potter coughed and the three directed there eyes towards him. “Anyway, we, well I - I wanted to ask if you would help us, incase anything else happens. I’m not saying, I’m not saying anything else will happen but well just incase. You’d be a great help -“
“We were looking for you on the train.” Goyle spoke, sliding up to the blonde. Potter and Weasley were still standing beside him but Draco only had eyes for Crabbe.
Draco hadn’t used his wand since Potter took it, he had been using his mother’s for some time now. She didn’t enjoy using magic in her final months, not after father. So Draco had used her wand, and while it was good and somewhat trustworthy it wasn’t his.
“I will not punish you for your behaviour early, defying orders and sneak off. I will not reward you either. But you should know that I am proud of you, Draco.”
“Yes, well. I don’t see how that is relevant.” Draco said. “I didn’t serve him, I was just a baby when he got defeated. I’m not my parents.”
The last time Draco had seen Hermione was after the battle, she was hugging and stroking Weasley’s hair, he had seen that one of the twins had died, the sound of the family’s muffled cries flooded the great hall, Draco ha turned his head quickly away from the two, he knew in those moments that he would have to isolate himself from the wizarding world, he would never be able to walk the streets of Diagon Alley without seeing someone who he had hurt, wether intentional of not. His mother had told Draco a few months later that Hermione and Weasley were at his trial, but he never saw them.
“Why would you think that.” He asked, nodding for the two boys two sit on the couch that was adjacent to his chair.
“Of course.” Potter smiles. “And then we can figure out who would want it. Merlin, Draco, you really are a genius.”
God what if he really didn’t get Slytherin, how could he be Goyle’s friend if he was in Hufflepuff, how could he convince Pansy that blood status didn’t matter if he was in Ravenclaw, how could he save Crabbe’s life if he was in Gryffindor.
Draco was standing being measured when he heard the bell ring on the door, and Harry Potter walked through. Draco didn’t remember Potter being this small, this thin. He supposed be hadn’t thought about it the first time they met, the first time they met he didn’t know who he was. Draco could hardly stomach confrontations with Potter in the future, every time he saw him it reminded him of his scar and how he looked.But now his scar was gone and if this was real, surely it would be better to try and get along with Potter. No matter how much he disliked this boy.
Draco had made it a point to call Hermione by her first name while the man was staying in his home. Draco would think about Potter, weasel and Hermione often during those long days, the thought of using her first name felt like a sort of rebellion even if no one ever heard him say it. Hermione. Those long days hearing her cries was when he truly realised that the man was wrong, his father was wrong and everything he had been taught was wrong.
First he heard the doors slamming open, and then the professor screaming, yelling  about the troll. Then he heard children screaming and panicking, everyone standing - scared. Then he heard Dumbeldore declare everyone should return to their dorms. But then. Then something different happened.
Summer went slowly for Draco and he was so glad for it. He hardly saw his father which was a blessing, Draco didn’t thinking he could handle properly seeing him. He saw him at breakfast and dinner some days or he would see him sitting in his study but Draco would never really see him, he wouldn’t really talk to him either. The last conversation Draco had had with his father in the future was not a pleasant one, his mother cried behind him. He didn’t want to remember that day, not yet at least. For now Draco was happy relaxing in the summer heat, the smell of grass on his fingers and mud in his hair.
“Thank you. Dobby.” Draco Smiled. “Now, I suppose I will have my breakfast in my room if that is okay. I don’t want to face father just yet.” He hummed to himself. “And Dobby, you should join me for breakfast. Yes. That would be wonderful.”
“No.” Weasley spoke. He had been attempting to show Draco and Potter some magic. Draco himself was reluctant to show off, the spells he had performed over the summer had all been unusually powerful especially for an eleven year old.
“But why should that matter ? Why did you do what you did today, I could see that you didn’t want to and -“
Draco took his wand in his hands and the magic was instant. That feeling of pure innocent magic, how he had missed that feeling. The magic Draco had felt in recent years had been angry and harsh and sad. But here he was. Eleven. With pure innocent magic. He was so happy, his toothy grin plastered on his face as his lifted his wands box up and placed in back down with his magic.
He had hoped his absence int he Slytherin common room had gone somewhat in noticed, this was delusional of him. He had been friends with most of the first year Slytherins before they attended Hogwarts, and they were aware of what sort of child he had been. His clear change in personality had come to a head on a Wednesday in early November. He was for once actually int he common room, sitting on his old chair studying. And then Greg and Vincent made there way over.
He had come to terms with how his chest had looked somewhat quickly, it was hard but necessary, but the scar on his chin that led to his neck - he had never come to terms with. He  had hated it, and still now even though it wasn’t there he still felt insecure and ugly like he did before. His insecurities would find him in the worst moments, when Pansy was simply talking to him or when Severus would look at him in Potions. He felt it when he was lying by him self in bed with the curtains closed. Whenever someone really looked at him his mind regressed, in his mind he still had his scar, had a reminder of what he had done, of what Potter had done to him. It hit him worst of all whenever Potter really looked at him, all he could do was try and ignore it but when Potter was staring at him like that, he could never really forget.
Sometimes it felt like his scar was still there, that when people looked at him it was all they could see.
Draco woke up with a jerk. His hands felt numb and his legs felt too short. The duvet wrapped around his body, and surrounded him in heat. His heart was beating, scared from his dream. His dream he couldn’t remember. Draco sat up, and yawned, he rubbed his eyes opened and moved his feet to the floor. That’s when it hit him. He had wooden floor, not carpeted. He hadn’t had carpeted floor since the manor. And he hadn’t been to the minor since the man died. Draco’s eyes finally focused, but they focused on a room he hardly recognised, a room he hadn’t needed to recognise. Not since he was thirteen. At fourteen he had begged his mother to change the colour of his room, from a deep vibrant green to a dark blue, he had hated the green, hated how it reminded him of his Hogwarts dorm, hated how it had reminded him of magic and of Potter. During the summers he didn’t want to think about Hogwarts and magic and Potter, until he did. He would dream of Hogwarts when he was sixteen, he would pray that he could be back. Be real and safe again. Be away from him, the man who destroyed it.
The sorting ceremony went the same was as last time, Weasley, Hermione and Potter all being sorted into Gryfinndor. Draco ignored Dumbledore’s ‘speech’, he couldn’t bare to look up from his hands, the ‘speech’ was short anyway just Dumbledore being mental like he always was. Draco didn’t realise how hungry he had been until the feast commenced, the other Slytherins were making idle chat but he didn’t want to bother with conversation, he didn’t really want to look up from his plate. He couldn’t chance looking at Severus again, if he did he feared he might cry, and it had been drilled into his head from a young age that a Malfoy shouldn’t show that much emotion in public.
This time round he found it hard to pretend to be eleven -  even tough he was. He found it hard to laugh with his friends or relax in their presences. He found it hard to feel happy at the feast, he knew what was coming and he knew it was the beginning of the end. It was Quirell who was a follower, it was the beginning of that man ruining him.
Draco had stopped gelling back his hair years ago, his hair was now parted somewhat to the side and dangled in eyes. His mother racked her hand through it. Her touch was so soft.
“No Dobby you shouldn’t. And I can only apologise for my behaviour, you need to know that I am sorry. Do not hurt yourself because of me anymore. “ Draco pleaded. “I am glad you woke me, I am glad I am apologising and I would be glad if you accepted that apology, but of course you don’t have to.”
Asking Potter to be his friend was Draco’s first real rebellion from his fathers rules. He had been told stories of the boy-who-lived throughout childhood and so wanted to be his friend, when he was rejected it stung. He hadn’t wanted to try and rebel for some time after, his father was right about Potter so surely he was right about other things.
The week went by slowly and uneventful as it did last time, memories replaying themselves in real time over and over again. He sat through Potter staring at him during meals, Longbottom melting his cauldron in potion’s lessons and Weasley being an downright idiot.
“Wicked. I’m Ron, Ron Weasley” Weasley spoke well steeping into the compartment and sitting next to Draco, so he was facing Potter. He didn’t seem to even notice Draco was there until Potter looked over to the blonde. The ginger visibly tensed.
“Do not try and fool me Draco, me and you both know what I am referring to. I know that you understand what a powerful spell that was, and how you - an eleven year old boy should not have been able to perform it.”
“What no explanation Potter. Just expect me to drop everything because the boy-who-lived has asked me to?”
“Are you seriously angry at me for saving the girls life, Weasley” Draco drawled, he was tire of this conversation already. “I really don’t have time for this.”
Diagon Alley was more alive then Draco had seen it in years, it was noisy and crowded and Draco loved it.
“No. Of course not, I was trying to stop them from breaking the rules. Ron wanted to practise magic in the trophy room, I was trying to stop them.” Hermione whispers, not taking her gaze off Draco the entire time.
This was good. Walking into the great hall with Crabbe and Goyle by his side. He kept making glances toward Crabbe during the time, but he was determined not to freak out. He couldn’t start crying, not here not when he was at Hogwarts.
During the train journey Potter was being too kind to him, laughing at some of his comments and beaming whenever he looked at him. Draco couldn’t let Potter get too attached, he wanted to save people and he didn’t want to get up with the mark this time round but he couldn’t become friends with Potter. The first reason he couldn’t become friends with him was because well, they hated each other, sure potter didn’t seem to understand that but it was just the way of life. The second reason they couldn’t become friends was because it could change things, what if becoming friends with Draco meant that Potter wouldn’t kill him, the man who ruined it all. Potter had to defeat him again. He had to. Draco couldn’t get in the way of that, he would risk it. And, Slytherins and Gryffindors could never be friends anyway, even if Draco wanted to. It just wouldn’t work.
“Hello my little dragon.” She said, walking across his bedroom floor into his bathroom. “Are you okay? Your father and I have been waiting for you at breakfast.”
Shit. Shit shit shit. What if Draco didn’t get sorted into Slytherin. What if he got put into Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff or god forbid Gryffindor. What if - what if his mother never wanted to see him again. He had only just got her back, he couldn’t lose her again. Not because of that stupid hat.
“No, no Dobby.” Draco spoke softly, wiping the sleep from his eyes and turning to fully face the house elf. “I want to apologies. And I want to say sorry.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to-“ he shouldn’t have said that, he was only saying it so Potter would stop looking so devastated.
Crabbe had been the one to call his name, it felt weird. Hearing a dead man speak to him, he couldn’t stop picturing Crabbe’s burning flesh and the sounds of his screams, couldn’t stop hearing Goyle’s loud cries. Goyle hadn’t been well after Crabbe died, Draco was already fading by that point but he had still cried. Crabbe definitely wasn’t the smartest or the nicest but he could be funny and caring and he was Draco’s friend and Draco had loved him like a brother. Seeing the boy now set his mind on fire, he began counting in his head to calm himself down.
“Okay. I have your letter here. We will collect your things and if you behave ,well I will treat you to some ice cream before we return, how does that sound ?”
“Master Draco, Dobby has been sent to wake yous sir. I is here to ask if you is joining Master for breakfast or is youse is wanting it in bed.” Dobby the house elf spoke. Draco hadn’t really considered him yesterday, He had seen him with his mother but he hadn’t truly registered the elf. Draco hadn’t really seen him properly since 2nd year, he knew Potter had something to do with it, something about Potter freeing him but he couldn’t remember, or perhaps he was never told. The last time Draco had actually seen him Aunt Bella was throwing a knife. He presumed it had hit. Draco hadn’t heard anything about the elf after that. Although maybe he did survive, Draco wasn’t really in the right frame of mind back then, in that future. Bella had used crucio against him that evening, she had blamed Draco for letting Potter escape. He remembered crying, the tears staining his cheek and thinking of Dobby, thinking how much he wished Aunt Bella would mercy him with a knife to the chest.
They were only sitting together for a matter of minutes until the compartment door opened again. Potter had been rambling about how amazing the magical world seemed when Weasley stepped through the door.
His panicked thoughts where snapped when he was manhandled walking towards the Great hall at lunch, he had sat through lessons that he didn’t not pay any attention to all morning - not that he needed to pay attention, first year was easy enough and he was excelling in all his studies, he had managed to brew perfect potions each time, transfigured flawless and had constantly been excelling in his essays.
Professor McGonagall had began leading them into the Great Hall, it was even more beautiful then he remembered. The last time his eyes had seen it it had been destroyed, but now, in the past it was amazing.
“Malfoy - I, can I speak to you please.” God Potter really didn’t understand when was and wasn’t a good time to stand and chat.
“Do you really, Draco ?” She questioned. “If you do, why did you spend so much time with us, with Harry ?”
Draco worked tirelessly to ignore Potter over the coming days, the boy was always staring at him, it wasn’t liked e pointed daggers he had got used to during his first time at Hogwarts. Harry’s states this time we’re unnerving, they were filled with curiosity and wondering. Draco hated it. He had been spending his days trying to formulate some sort of plan on how he he could change things, if he was stuck here, a part of his mind was sure he was probably sleeping or in some sort of coma but the rest of his mind was hopeful that this was real, because if it was real it meant he really didn’t have the dark mark, it meant he didn’t have scars all over his body, meant that his friends and classmates and godfather were actually alive and they could be saved.
Before waking up in the past Draco had had an unproductive day, he had used his mother’s wand to clear some water he had spilt in the morning, then he showered and lied on his chair, his feet resting on a stained coffee table with the television blasting in the background. Draco hated the television, but it drowned out his thoughts and it was far better then his own mind. Draco had then spoken to Claire in the flat opposite him, she was pretty and young like him and she was on her way to the job centre that day, he had smiled at her and waved her goodbye. After that Draco feel asleep, and the woke. Cooked a simple meal, ate it with the television still blasting in the background. Draco washed his plate. Poured a glass of cheap wine, drank the wine. Cried. Made his way to bed, cried some more and the slept. And Draco had woke up eleven again, on the 31st of July and was now standing at the foot of his fathers study.
“Oh.” She sighed, “I’ve never had a lot of friends before, but they’re supposed to help each other, I think. And I need you’re help with this. So, would you do It for me ?”
“Bastard,” Draco said under his breath, retreating to his bed and flopping down upon it. He wanted to disappear, to forget about everything; perhaps he’d have released his memories into his Pensieve if his wand hadn’t been confiscated.
“Oh, but you do! Surely you could fall in love with such a beautiful prince. And don’t you remember your dance lessons with Aunt Marge?”
On September 19th, Prince Malfoy will be hosting a celebration of grandeur and festivities. We humbly beseech you, witches and wizards alike, to attend his masquerade ball on this date. In order to find a suitable heir for The Prince, dueling will commence between six and nine o’clock. The ball itself will begin at 5pm-3am.
Potter laughed and leaned over once again, placing a rough hand under Draco’s own. Draco repressed a shiver. “What are you doing now?!”
“No!” Draco yelled rather loudly. Harry raised an eyebrow and looked at him strangely. Draco cleared his throat. “I mean, er, no. I think I can handle walking home by myself, thanks.”
“Scorpius! That’s right, you don’t have tutoring this morning!” Harry grinned, taking his son into his arms. He was so tiny, so breakable; at age three, Scorpius was much smaller than most toddlers his age. “How are my favorite boys this morning?” Scorpius squealed when Harry kissed him on the cheek, and Harry’s heart swelled. Draco rolled his eyes, repressing a grin.
“Potter! I’m hungry,” Dudley barked at Harry from where he was surrounded by silk comforters and plush pillows. “Fetch me something to eat.” Dudley paused. “Also, I will to be visiting the emporium with father in an hour. While I’m gone, I want you to clean up this mess,” He gestured with a pudgy hand glittering with rings at the mess of toys, books, and clothes that completely covered every inch of Dudley's tacky, purple carpet.
Hermione looked at Ron, who grimaced. “Well, erm, that’s a bit complicated, mate…” He trailed off, trying to find an answer in Hermione’s eyes. She shook her head, aghast at Ron’s uselessness.
Draco calmed down, body relaxing, and he nodded. Harry kissed the side of his mouth tenderly and Draco’s hips bucked involuntarily. He was going to lose it, too soon, and He hadn’t even felt Harry’s cock yet. He wasn’t having that, so his trembling hands found their way to Harry’s fly and pulled his thick member out. It was heavy in Draco’s hand, just the right size to fill him up and fuck him properly.
“‘Something you’ve noticed?!” Ron said incredulously. “Something you’ve-- this is Draco bloody Malfoy, Harry! He tormented us all through school, remember? He has the Dark Mark, remember? He served Vol--”
Draco crosses his arms, all traces of vulnerability gone. “I want you to take me home and show me, Potter, you oaf.”
“Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess right now,” Harry mumbled, clearing some coffee-stained documents from his desk. Malfoy snorted.
“He just started last week,” Hermione grumbled, and Ron shot her a glare. Harry pretended not to hear that part.
“Neville, do you mind if Harry here borrows Hermione for a bit?” Ron cut in, earning him a sharp glare from the witch.
To his disappointment, Harry finished the book quickly; however the conclusion was perfectly satisfying. A clever wizard, still just a man, had become equals with Death himself. It was fantastic.
Pansy stood up, practically forcing Draco off. Her chocolate brown locks bounced around her shoulders as waved daintily before making a swift exit to Merlin knows where, heels clopping down the corridor.
It was obvious that he had, being that his hands were still glowing with...something, but Harry didn’t feel as though he could have done such a thing. How could he, probably a Squib, have caused so much destruction without a wand? He shook his head, trying to quiet the ringing in his ears, to no avail. He supposed that he’d be executed even sooner now as punishment for causing such damage. Although that’s probably a good thing, he thought. I won’t have time to wallow in my self pity.
“Tomorrow you’ll be going off to Hogwarts, Draco and shouldn’t have to tell you the importance of maintaining our name and upholding our beliefs. When you arrive you will meet and sit with purebloods only. You will uphold the Slytherin traditions throughout your time at the school and you will not fraternize with those who are below us. Do you understand?”
“When you two are done flirting.” Weasley says, flatly. Draco she’s Hermione blushes, her face almost crimson.
“Good morning mother.” His voice was high pitched and younger than it had been in a very long time. “I’m sorry. I-I I had nightmare and I felt sick and I can’t eat right now. I’m sorry.” He spoke in a small voice, it was earnest.
“Right my little dragon, that is all for today. We should be getting back soon. Your father won’t be home for dinner but we really shouldn’t stay out too late.”
It was the same somewhat comfy chair from last time that helped calm Draco’s nerves. The feel of it beneath him reassuring him that it would all be okay. He had been trying hard to ignore Severus, the sight of the man still bringing flashes in his mind of the Astronomy Tower and his godfathers too soon death. Severus’ death had hurt Draco more than most.
“I just - I just meant that you’re kind and I thought we were friends and you’re cool. Like really cool, amazing at magic as-well, amazing at potions.”
“Did you trap me in this conversation just so your friend could question my love life or was there something more important?” Draco imposed.
Draco knew that soon enough this would come to an end, maybe he would wake up and be nineteen or maybe he would find himself on the Hogwarts express.
“You, you were my first friend. You were nice to me and then you just stopped and I don’t understand what I did wrong.” The boy muttered, why did Potter care if he was his friend ? He had Weasley.
They weren’t spending too much time trying to figure out the situation on the third floor corridor, too little information to go on, but they were at least trying to brainstorm ideas. While Draco would spend time with the trio it wasn’t as if he was a member of their group, he wouldn’t meet them everyday int he library and would hardly interact with then outside of that room. However, that didn’t lead to him spending time with his actual friends either, at first he was glad to be around his childhood friends, before the war had got to the, in the future they were hurt, abused adults but in this present they were somewhat innocent again. He had been glad to get the the chance to spend time with Vincent again, he truly had missed him but seeing the boy now was just too much. And so, Draco spend a lot of his time alone. He would spend his time in small, hidden alcoves he had found during the war (he had been unable and unwilling to fit in the spaces then) or he would simply spend time on the grounds of the castle away from other students.
“I don’t know what to say, Harry,” Draco finally says, and the sound of your name on his tongue for the first time fills you up like lightning or high tides. You’ve been calling him Draco since that first time in the dirty-dark of a back-alley, but he’s called you Potter all the while. (
Hermione lets go of me to wrap an arm around him and pull him in the hug. I hold them both tight as Hermione’s breathing gradually grows calmer again, more regular.
Draco’s almost done packing when Harry barges into his room, and the sight of the suitcase punches the air straight out of Harry’s lungs. Draco steadfastly doesn’t look at him; he folds another shirt instead.
I pretend I don’t know where I’m going. I pretend that a bit of air will do me good. To tell the truth, all the talk of Malfoy’s funeral affects me more than I expected. That’s saying quite a lot, really, since Malfoy’s death has been hanging over my head for the past two years. It’s not even that we were friends, Malfoy and I, not strictly speaking. We were—friendlier. After the war. We spoke to each other when we met at Ministry functions, swapped a couple of awkward platitudes here and there. He used to work as a potion expert for the Aurors, I’d bring him samples to test every now and then, and I’d wish him a good day. It makes no sense that I’d miss him so much, and I know Ron and Hermione think I’m somehow using his death as a shorthand to talk about all the others—Sirius and my parents, Fred and Remus and Tonks. It’s not entirely wrong, but it’s not entirely right either.
“Oh Draco, Draco,” Harry moans. He’s entirely undone and entirely open, laying on the bed half-delirious with ecstasy and entirely consumed by every feeling he’s desperately been trying to forget for years. (It will ruin him, this love. It will make firewood out of him, it will reduce him to ash.)
Cousin Gnorothy found the noise button next to the door and threw rocks at it until maybe-Draco came out. Dragged parchment inside and left it on the floor. Took maybe-Draco’s scarf and heaped it on top, so he would see. Bit a small hole in it too. Cashmere and silk. Very satisfying but not as tasty as fudge. Strongly dislike human burrows: nowhere to dig. Was happy to get back out.
If you were to ask him what he feels for Draco Malfoy, he’d tell you he hasn’t thought about him since the end of the war. It’d be a lie, of course, but this is what he would tell you anyway.
“You complete and utter madman,” he whispers again, “you have no idea exactly how in love with you I am.”
“Instead, I decided to come back and found myself alone on a battlefield and every single cell in my body screamed for days. Instead, I came back and so many people died all the same and now I have to carry that grief everywhere I go and I have no idea how to do it. It was the right thing to do, I know, but I regret it, somedays.”
Piss off, Draco. You know full well I’m on a date with Lavender tonight. If Pansy put you up to this, she will pay. If this is about Potter,
where women had come to stay in hopes of curing lung conditions under the watchful eyes of nuns. It was turned into a summer camp after that, which in turn had closed ten years ago; the building had been sitting empty ever since. It broke everyone’s heart, seeing it in that state. It had once been the pride of the entire valley, the most modern sanatorium in the whole country. T
There are pictures of me too, looking… well… sad. I guess that’s one thing they didn’t have to make up. It’s not that I am not happy for Ginny, I am, I really am—it’s just that lately I’ve been finding it a little harder to smile. There’s no reason for it, not really, Luna talked me into working at her sanctuary and rehabilitation facility for magical creatures after I quit the Aurors and I love it more than I’ve ever enjoyed firing spells at people and getting yelled at in training sessions—it’s just that I’ve grown increasingly unsure that it’s all that I wanted or hoped or expected out of life. Watching Ginny in her white tuxedo, with her arms wound tight around a beautiful girl and happiness all over her face, I wondered if I was ever going to find someone too. I wondered if I was ever going to be this happy, this certain that I’m doing the right thing. And as much as I tried to hide it, I still look like a wet, miserable cat in every single picture.
You don’t recognise your life anymore. Inside your chest, winter has turned into spring. The frozen grounds of your ribs have thawed and there are all sorts of things growing on your lungs now.
He collapses down onto the bed, and you’re still for a while, the both of you. He’s stretched out with his arms above his head, all long, graceful limbs and glorious expanses of ivory skin, and you try to commit the intimate softness of him to memory. You want to hold him. You want to kiss him. You move your hand to caress his skin but you think better of it before you touch him—he’s not in love, you remember. He’ll remind you often enough, with knife blade words and throw-away comments that feel like blows to the teeth. It’s just sex for him, you remember. You’re just a pretty face to fuck, just a schoolboy fantasy to have and to discard.
May has covered the grounds of Malfoy Manor with lush leaves and fragrant flowers. There is beauty to be found in every corner of the park: everywhere, lupins offer their pastel-soft, pepper-scented flowers to the sky, and peonies bloom lazily, heavy and fragrant and pink. As Harry walks the path to the house, slow and unhurried, he notices every single one of them.
Much has been speculated on how much the rise of the sacred twenty-eight influenced its falling out of favour, and it is the subject of heated debate in academic circles. One thing we do know, however, know, is that in 1726, a young man by the name of Thaddeus Syrenus Travers, who was engaged to be married to a well-born young lady, found himself under the influence of the spell. His family went to great lengths to keep condition quiet but scandal broke out when it turned out the family’s milkmaid had his handwriting all over her skin. Thaddeus’ uncle, Perseus Travers gives the following account of the incident in his personal diary:
Lee doesn’t understand a word of your grief-drunken speech. And you must look entirely insane, in that moment, standing in front of the fireplace in nothing but your boxers and an old, alcohol-stained t-shirt, half-sobbing and half-screaming words he doesn’t have the context for.
. This story starts with a door slammed shut and your own tears, heavy and hot behind your eyelids. You don’t know when it came to this. You don’t know when things went to shit between the two of you, you don’t know when you started fighting in the kitchen and ignoring each other at the dinner table. If you thought about it, it’d frighten you, because the only future you ever saw was you and her with rings around your fingers and a house full of children. It’s all you ever thought you wanted.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry replies, instead of telling him he understands him or forgives him or loves him because he’s been avoiding thinking about their failed relationship ever since it ended, because the memory of it still splits  his chest into splintery halves, an ancient oak struck down by lightning.
Harry decided to start with a fresh coat of paint in the downstairs rooms. He bought white paint and stashed it in the piano room overnight. But by the time Harry stood there in the light of morning, dressed in an old pair of jeans and his hair gathered into a messy bun, the paint had vanished entirely.
Harry turns the key in the lock and pushes the door, Iris goes straight through the wall and swoops a few times in mid-air before disappearing again.
After a lot of yelling, blond-haired and black-haired made water come out of their eyes and joined hands. Then, they engaged in the human ritual of licking each other’s mouth. Very entertaining, we all came out to watch. Cousin Gnorothy said it is how human babies are made. If it is true, I hope the new human will give me biscuits too.
When he closes the door, Harry falls back onto his bed and closes his eyes, trying to imagine there’s another body here with him. He does not even pretend he doesn’t want it to be Draco.
It is plain to see from that extract, that the performing of the spell would have been a familiar occurrence for its readership, as none of the particularities of the spell are explained. Furthermore, it is not only well known but it is also extremely ritualised and codified: not only do the young people not cast the spell on themselves, instead relying on the elder to do it for them, there is also the existence of a sacred book in which each one of them must write their name in order to be assigned to their soulmates. It can be said that the ceremony is very much a part of the social mores of the time and that it would have been a milestone in a young person’s life, an important aspect of coming of age. Less than three centuries later, however, the practice has entirely disappeared from wizarding society.
“You’re everything, Draco. You’re everything, and you’re worth fighting for, and I’m so sorry it’s taken me so long to realise. I know you’re always going to be the same person, Draco. And I’m always going to love that person, whether you’re by my side or not. And yes, we might make each other miserable sometimes. Yes, we will fight and we will cry and we will want to quit, because that’s what love is. And when we do, Draco? When we do, we will fight for each other. We will fight for our relationship. We’ll talk it through, and we’ll listen, and we’ll put in the work. And it will be beautiful, Draco. You and me. It will be beautiful despite our traumas and our hangups and the cracks on our souls. I promise you, Draco, it will be beautiful because we will make it so.”
“I remember Draco’s funeral. I remember coming home with Luna afterwards and I remember two weeks after that, maybe three. I asked Luna to move in with me, and she said yes, and I remember it was the first time I thought maybe I was going to be alright.”
“It’s nice to meet you,” Harry says after a while. “I mean, it’s not nice in the sense that I wouldn’t be meeting you like this if you hadn’t—you know—died, and I’m not saying I’m happy that you’re dead but I… Oh, I’m making a mess out of this, aren’t I?”
Every word is an ice-cold storm-wave, crashing over Harry’s lighthouse heart until it’s extinguished entirely (black with soot and drenched in salt, crumbling and broken: a ruin.)
It’s not that you’ve carefully planned it, of course it’s not, because grief takes up all the space inside your skull, heavy and thick. (A sponge sodden with dirty dishwater.)
They did not stop looking at each other, not throughout the ceremony and not during the feast afterwards either. They did not talk about their letters or their late-night secrets. Instead, they talked about school, about the future. About Quidditch, too. But all the while, their eyes kept repeating like a prayer or a litany:
Draco isn’t anywhere to be found on the ground floor. The paint strips are still sitting in sad little heaps along the walls. Harry breathes.
Iris pauses, her finger pressing hard and painful against Harry’s sternum for a second before her hand turns intangible again, going straight through Harry’s chest like fog. She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose as she continues:
“I keep having hallucinations of a dead man. Or a man who’s disappeared at the very least. I keep falling asleep on the floor and dreaming about the same thing over, and over again.”
Around them: smooth flat stone, and small patches of sea-grass, and the endless crashing of wave after wave after wave. (In the lighthouse, the lantern burns in dotted lines across the minutes.)
I’m not sure I believe the spell works. I’m not even sure that I believe in the concept of soulmates if I’m honest. But all I thought I knew turned out to be wrong so maybe I should see where it goes. Maybe we should see if perhaps we’re meant to meet now, to… fall in love or help each other be happier. I don’t know. I figure, that if we hate each other, fine, we’d know that stupid spell didn’t work, and then we can share a kiss and be done with it forever, but what if it worked? What if we’re missing out on something beautiful?
“Okay,” Lee says softly. “Okay, Harry. It’s your choice, and I respect it. I’ll see you tomorrow for the interview.”
“We don’t have to live here, not if you don’t want to.” (And it breaks Harry’s heart, the thought he could leave this place, but he’s desperate and he’s falling apart, so the words tumble from his mouth all the same.) “I’d leave this behind for you. We could go anywhere you wanted. I’d follow you. I’d never complain, not as long as I could hold your hand and kiss your hair. We could go live at the Manor. We could never go back to England again. We could start anew anywhere, Draco, anywhere you wanted. I would be good, Draco. Oh, I would be quiet and soft and I would never hurt you again. You wouldn’t even notice I’m there, I promise, Draco. I promise. Just don’t leave me behind. Oh, please, don’t leave me behind. “
Harry knew those trees when he was a boy. Harry feared their twisted trunks and gnarled branches when it was still the Forbidden Forest, dark and gloomy and full of danger. He reaches out and touches the rough, grey bark. There is nothing of danger, now. The fog wraps around him, soft like a woollen blanket, tender like a mother’s embrace.
“I’m not saying the world isn’t full of misogynist pricks. Believe me, I’m not. But we’ve established that whoever drugged me had both a despicable sense of moral and an impressive mastery of potions. And that’s exactly the kind of person who’s behind the potion Pansy’s dear father thought acceptable to drug her with.” Hermione sets down her beer on the side table and twists her hair up into a bun that she secures with her wand. She sighs, then adds, “Besides, do you really think it’s a coincidence that Harry followed a lead while investigating Pansy’s case and now there’s Draco all over his dreams? You know it has to all be linked!”
“Draco…” Harry starts, feeling like he’s standing in the epicentre of an earthquake (wishing the ground might do him the kindness of swallowing him alive.)
“Might as well be,” Draco answers in a voice that sounds like someone cut him open and hollowed him out entirely (scooped out the heart of him, the blood of him, the lungs and the breath of him.) “It’s not living, is it? Being trapped here, alone.”
I decide and pick up my pen before I can think about the fact they must have read my pitiful attempts at journaling.
“You disappeared from your bed the instant you fell asleep,” Nott says as he waves his wand over me in a series of complicated diagnostic spells. “Completely gone. No trace of you. Not even a magical signature.”
Draco doesn’t turn his head towards Harry. Cows are grazing in a lush green field, their bells echoing throughout the valley. The mountains are still snow-capped, a stark contrast to the way spring unfurled wildflowers and thick grasses at their foot. He lets out a long breath.
Draco kisses you. It’s not a pretty kiss. It’s not gentle and soft and romantic. You bite his lip. He claws at your shoulders, bruise-hurt fingers digging deep into the flesh. You moan. You writhe underneath him. He pins you to the floor and kisses you harder. You lose yourself entirely.
Black-haired nuisance came again. Caught uncle Gnomas and cousin Gnolivia and threw them over the fence. Very frustrating. Would not have gone to the bother of digging a new burrow, had I known the old one would get empty. Peed in the prize roses as retaliation.
Jemima Graves swoops in before Harry can think of a good answer. She needs eyewitness accounts. She’s soaked, and the left side of her head is covered in dark patches of burn-frizzled hair. Both of her shoes make soft sloop-gush sounds as she walks, but still she needs them to fill in form 562-37 A. She also needs a signature, if you please, here, and here, and here.
“The public wants to know about you, Mr Potter, about your life. Such a great hero for the wizarding world, people look up to you, they care about you. They’d love to hear about your new boyfriend.”
There were days that didn’t hurt like being burned at the stake, of course, there always are. There were days when Draco let Harry be there for him, when he inevitably broke down under the unbearable weight of being alive, when he let Harry hold his hand and talk him through the tears. There were soft moments of silence as they sat on the floor in a bedroom or a bathroom and slowly cast a myriad of spells that glittered around them like fairy dust. There were rare moments when Draco melted in Harry’s arms too, where he let himself be touched and be kissed, and when Harry almost believed it didn’t matter that he always loved more than was loved because this was good, wasn’t it? This was good, and it was beautiful, and it filled Harry with light and hope.
Harriet laughed breathily. She’d barely seen any of Draco, only felt her under her robes, and she was already ridiculously turned on. And by the looks of it Draca was too; her pupils were wide and lust-blown and her body was absurdly pliable in Harriet’s arms.
Harry cleared his throat and Draco whirled around, eyes wide. He was wearing a black cloak, dark and simple; the exact opposite of anything Harry had ever seen him wear before. He looked tired and even more gaunt than usual.
“No one else,” Harry murmured into the crook of Draco’s neck,breathing him in. “I wouldn’t want to spend my life with anyone else. I’m in love with you, you ponce.”
Draco tried to speak, but his voice failed him. Harry seemed to notice and  smiled down at him reassuringly, beauty wild and otherworldly. He tucked a strand of Draco’s disheveled hair behind his ear. Draco's breath caught in his throat because Harry’s eyes were impossibly soft and tender, full of...love?
Draco felt a bead of sweat drip down the side of his forehead and into his shirt. He wanted to get up and run, to grab Potter and travel far away and never return home.
Malfoy sighed, looking at Harry through long eyelashes. His skin was a flawless, milky ivory that left Harry a bit breathless. “Of course I did well. I’m a Malfoy.”
Harry cut him off, placing his large hands on the back of Draco’s head and pulling him in for a rough, uncoordinated kiss. His lips were warm, and they slotted against Draco’s perfectly; he instantly craved more of it. Draco's prayers were answered immediately when Harry deepened the kiss, curling his fingers at the base of Draco’s neck, and sighed. Draco shuddered at the rush of Harry’s breath against his cheek, and Harry smirked against his hair. Draco made an embarrassing noise (how could that even have came from him?) when Harry slipped a hand under Draco’s thick robes and began tracing his fingers across the pale skin of his abdomen.
Draco sighed and reached out his hand again-- but rather than caressing Potter’s cheek or winding his fingers through his hair like he so desperately desired, he simply poked Potter’s shoulder with an unnecessary amount of force. Potter snorted and startled awake, blinking at Draco in confusion.
So Harry placed a gentle kiss to the Prince’s lips. They were softer than the chemise scarf around his neck and Harry instantly felt the urge to fall into them, to taste them further, only to remember that this was the fucking Prince. So, despite himself, he pulled away, breaths quick.
Moments after Dudley polished off the remainder of his eggs, Harry yanked the plate out of his chubby hands and practically bolted out of the bedroom. He peered into Uncle Vernon’s bed chambers, only to observe that the plate of breakfast had been left untouched; Harry quietly shut the door.
And so, Harry was pleasantly surprised when he heard a stone bounce off of his chamber window that night. He rushed downstairs, booming footsteps disrupting the silent evening. He yanked the door open only to be greeted by a very-fancy Ron. He donned a sparkling, golden placard engraved with a grand “M” and glittering gauntlets.
“There you go,” Harry said. He allowed his hand to wander, placing it against Draco’s firm, clothed chest. “Now you're getting it.”
Harry stilled inside of him and Draco cried out in anguish, grabbing at Harry’s shoulders in an attempt to coax him into movement.
“Off,” Harry said, practically ripping off Draco’s pants. Draco simply sat there, staring at Harry with wide eyes.
Harry mimed zipping his mouth shut and decided that he should show Draco how it was done. He took off his own shirt and practically flipped into the water, immediately emerging. He shook the water out of his heavy hair and smiled, sucking in a breath of cold air and relishing in its crispness.
Strangely enough, before Lucius died he and Harry had become almost friendly. Initially, Harry had had trouble looking past Lucius’ bigoted nature and controlling demeanor, but after many awkward conversations over tea Harry had realized that really, he was just a very powerful man with a very large inferiority complex. As such, Harry had put in minimal effort to get to know him, for Draco’s sake; and the two got along surprisingly well. The Late King had passed two months ago from a nasty plague; Harry still vividly remembered holding Draco as he cried, kissing the tears away and assuring him of his father’s love.
The door swung open, scraping against the polished wall and making Draco grimace. The Queen always had to make an entrance, no matter the circumstances. Draco turned around to greet her. Narcissa’s black and white hair, tucked behind her bejeweled ears, was plaited into a complex network of braids. Her robes were floaty and shapeless, crafted from the finest silks in the kingdom.
Harry stood up, brushing his hands on his trousers, and made a show of unbuckling them. Draco visibly swallowed, eyes flitting back and forth over various areas of Harry’s body. He cleared his throat and turned around, ears slightly pink.
Before Draco could question him, Lucius continued speaking. “You will be married tomorrow morning. I’ve gathered our finest scribes to craft the invitations and our most skilled chefs to cater. The celebration shall be grand, Draco. I’ve decided to invite commoners as...compensation for my previous doubts.”
“I know what laundry is,” Draco snapped. “I was just wondering what you were doing with it. It’s servant work.” Harry turned around to give Draco a deadpan look.
Draco’s pale cheeks reddened in fury and Harry noticed him clenching his fists. “I’ll have you know that my father is a very influential man. He’ll have you arrested in a heartbeat.”
Ronda and ‘Mione stood at her side. Ronda’s freckled face was turning pinker at every one of Draca’s snickers; her straight, orange hair paled in comparison to her cheeks. ‘Mione stood still as a statue, jaw clenched; Draca observed how tightly his fists were clenched at his sides.
“Ronald overheard his colleagues speaking to The King this morning. They plan to find you and…” She swallowed, dark eyes locked on the ground. “Execute you.”
“He's not dead, Your Highness. Your father requested for him to be brought back alive, so that he himself may witness the execution.”
“No,” Potter replied, standing slowly. He immediately fell back down into the cot and began laughing like an idiot. “Er, yeah. I suppose I am a bit drunk, aren’t I?”
“It'll be okay. I want you to find someone who loves you like you deserve, alright? Someone who'll treat you right. And I--”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry mumbled, feeling awkward now. He seemed to forget that Hermione was a Muggleborn. Hermione didn’t seem fazed, however; her glossed lips still formed a gentle smile.
“Sure, sure,” Ronda finally chimed in, smiling broadly. “Everyone here knows what gender you prefer, Malfoy. Who wouldn’t want a piece of Harriet, am I right, ‘Mione?”
Harry cringed, groaned, and stood up. The wood floor was cold against the bottoms of his feet. He stood over Malfoy who was now actively kicking someone in his sleep. Harry thought back to the last time he’d seen Malfoy crying, many years ago, and how he’d practically killed him with that dark hex. Guilt and shame practically knocked the wind out of Harry as he stared down at the terrified man below him. Perhaps it was time to act.
“Someone knocked on the door and mum opened it. She practically passed out, Harry, I think it’s him! I’ve only met him once, but it’s gotta be, he has the blond hair!”
“Oh shit,” Harry yelled, “Oh shit oh shit oh shit.” He yanked off his shirt, and dove into the river. He quickly retrieved most of the clothes. Although a few garments got away, he doubted Dudley would even notice what with his copious amount of ornamental rags. Harry sat down on the riverside, closing his eyes and basking in the sun in an attempt to warm his shivering muscles.
“I know you well, my Prince,” Narcissa said, cupping Draco’s cheek. “But no matter. I won’t press the issue.” She stood up, black robes billowing around her. “Just remember, darling, that blood and love come hand in hand.”
“No!” Harry yelled, and Draco winced slightly. “Of course I want to marry you, you imbecile! What happened to your crippling narcissism all of a sudden?”
“Want more?” Harry asked, voice rough with desire. Draco nodded, fingers flexing against Harry’s back. His grey eyes were a bit unfocused, but they were on Harry; impossibly wide and lust-blown. His lips were parted slightly and his cheeks were flushed; He looked completely and utterly debauched despite the fact that Harry wasn’t even fucking him yet. Draco looked so good like this, impossibly good, and it took all of Harry’s self control not to shove into him all at once. Though, judging by the way Draco reacted to a second finger inside of him, that wouldn’t have been a problem; Harry could find no indication of pain in his sharp features.
“Ah! Aurors. Always a pleasure. You’ll be in room number three. Right across from the lavatories.” She handed Potter a rustic silver key. He grabbed it and turned towards Draco.
The knight, apparently named Ronald, was about to mumble something else before Hermione noticed Harry’s presence and spoke.
Harry felt his ears burning with embarrassment. Normally he could take Vernon’s insults without a problem but today he had a guest. A guest who just so happened to be a wealthy noble. Harry shuddered.
As always, I really hope you enjoyed!! Please please comment below and let us know if you did, it means the world to us!!!!
Draco, trembling now, allowed Harry to manhandle him onto the ground. Before he had time to whine about the condition of his clothes, Harry was on top of him, heavy and warm and strong and--
Harry conjured up some lube and quickly inserted a finger into Draco, who moaned obscenely at the intrusion. He never seemed to be in pain, no matter how quickly Harry went; that, or he just didn’t mind it. After fingerfucking him shallowly for a few moments, Draco lost his will and began begging, chanting Harry’s name and pushing himself onto Harry’s finger.
Draco huffed and stood up, brushing off his now-soiled white pants. “Shut your mouth, Peter, or whatever your name is. If you keep disrespecting me like this my father will hear about it.”
“And I thought you said that I couldn’t,” Draco said, shooting Harry a pointed glare. A faint, embarrassed blush dusting his pale cheeks.
“Don’t say that to Dad, Dadda! Be nice!” Scorpius' voice was small, but stern. At the tender age of three, Scorpius was already becoming a carbon copy of Draco, who allowed himself to smile this time. It was bloody contagious; soon the three of them were giggling like fools. Draco scooped Scorpius up, and he screeched in delight. “My little Prince,” Draco hummed, squishing his son's chubby cheek. “What do you want for your fourth birthday? A house? A stallion? A--”
Draco turned away, flushing all the way down to his slender torso, and crossed his arms. “Potter. Hurry up.”
Harry lets go of Draco who seems to deflate immediately at the loss of contact. His eyes are fixated on the white-brown sludge under his polished shoes. With chilled wind in his ears, Harry barely hears Draco’s broken whisper.
“Erm,” Harry said stupidly before standing up a bit taller. “We’re part of the Serious Organized Crime Agency. Official business. Classified. Sorry, ladies.”
“Oh yes, I am. My mother would be appalled if she knew I’d messed around with a Muggleborn at the ball!”
Harriet put her hands up in a surrender, stupidly giddy. She was sure, then, that she and Draca would get along fine from now on.
Draco stood there for a moment and dipped a dainty toe into it just like he had before. Harry laughed at the action.
Draco felt heat rising to his cheeks. Merlin. Never had he truly craved the sweet embrace of death until this moment. It was Potter who broke the momentarily awkward silence.
Additional Details: Chest carved into with sharp object. Words written: FILTHY BLOOD MUST BE DRAINED.
“Don't you look at me like that, Draco,” Harry whispers against his mouth before he can protest. Harry can just barely feel the slight hitch of Draco’s breath beneath his thick sweater. “I am lucky to be with you. You're the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
It took Draco a moment to realize that Potter was right. He grabbed his quill and drew a line between the last three attacks. There
Harry snorted, waving a dismissive hand. “That old thing? Of course not,” Harry’s eyes widened as he took in what he’d just said. “Oh, God, I even sound like one of you royal arseholes now.”
Extraordinary, was what it was. Harry yearned to meet the rest of the family, all of Ron’s brothers and sister, but they were either in school or had places of their own. Hogwarts, the most well known Wizarding academy in the world,was home to their youngest child, Ginny. Ron practically lost his marbles when Harry revealed to him that he had never heard of such a school.
If Harriet’s eyebrows could have risen any higher, they would have been floating in mid air. “Okay, and what are you going to tell him exactly? That I didn’t fall to my knees and beg for your approval like all of your other kiss-arse friends?”
Harry was deep within a dream. His mother and father had returned, all contagious smiles and comforting words. However, he was soon yanked from his warm thoughts by what felt like a cold water droplet hitting his forehead repeatedly. Harry gasped and sat up, eyes shooting open, only to sigh and shrink when he took in his surroundings. The walls were made from haphazardly stacked grey bricks and the soft ground beneath Harry's body consisted of wet dirt. The smell of must was overpowering; yellowish water dripped from every crack in the wall.
“Yes, Draco! Did I stutter? A Muggleborn. Smarter than any other witch of her kind I’ve ever come across.”
Harry seemed startled by Draco’s appearance only for a moment. He whirled around and waved awkwardly, meeting Draco’s eyes. “Oh, hello, Draco. You actually showed up.”
The word ‘Squib’ curled off of Draco’s tongue with such venom that Harry could not help but recoil. “I don’t know, I just--I can’t use magic anymore.”
Harry was dozing against the kitchen table, head sinking further and further into his own arms. He had just finished his most grueling chore, which was scrubbing the permanently stained marble floors (Vernon would never stop pestering him no matter how hard he scrubbed; he didn’t seem to understand that they were impossible to remove). His entire body was lethargic and he craved sleep almost as much as he craved water. The well was closed off today due to an infestation of gnomes and it had been ages since he’d last had something to drink. His mouth was dry and the air, still sticky, was practically choking him to death. When he heard Dudley’s heavy clomping, however, he suddenly found his energy, shooting up out of his chair and bolting out the door. No more chores today, he thought as he tied his left boot. I’d rather be executed by the King himself.
Draco clawed at him, aiming for the dark and unfeeling eyes, and the knight barely flinched. “I WILL NOT ALLOW IT! AS PRINCE OF YOUR KINGDOM I FORBID IT!”
Harry led Draco back out through the oaken front door and down the tree-lined walkway leading back down to the road.
Draco, after taking a carriage in town, arrived back at the castle. Its white spires contrasted with the cloudy late afternoon sky. A long marble bulevarde led to the main gate where Draco was greeted by the palace guards. He alighted in front of the castle’s wide steps. As Draco strode through the golden gem encrusted front doors, he was stopped by one of his father’s retainers.
‘Mione glared at her pointedly, and Harriet smiled at the display. Draca, however, was still wallowing in her own shame.
Woohoo! This was a super super long chapter, hopefully made up for the last one! I really hope you guys enjoyed this, uGH I LOVE WRITING THIS!!! It is so so so much fun for me. I introduced Ron, I hope you guys like how I write him! He's such a cute lil dork and i love him. Thank you for reading and sticking with us, please tell us what you think!
Potter turned around and immediately burst out laughing. Though the laughter was indeed a pleasant sound, it still made Draco's blood boil.
Harry had been waiting, waiting, waiting for his death for about half an hour when a ridiculously loud knock broke the tense silence of his mind. He’d been sitting on the floor, feeling strange doing anything else, and when he stood up he felt slightly woozy. It had been days since he’d eaten.
“So?” Hermione snapped, arms crossed. “What was so important that you had to interrupt our quest for knowledge?”
There's going to be an epilogue chapter coming by the end of the week, so stay tuned. I hope you guys enjoyed this ending.
“What now?” He snaps, eyes as sharp and cold as the slippery ice beneath their feet. Harry, after all these years, is unfazed.
Vernon looked as though he was actually considering this idea, forehead wrinkling in thought, and Harry felt a flicker of hope.
“Just--just let me look, you arsehole,” Potter slurred, grabbing one of the papers from Draco’s hand and practically falling on top of him in the process.
“You did, didn’t you? Always so pretty for me, Draca,” Harriet said, voice dripping with sweetness and lust. She slipped a finger inside the panties, marvelling at the hot wetness that immediately met her skin.
“Of course we remember, Harry,” Hermione said, more serious now. “But he loves you. I’m sure of it.”
“Don’t take the bait, Harriet,” ‘Mione said, voice eerily calm. He’d always possessed the unique ability to remain composed in any situation; aside from that one time he’d given in and given Draca a hard shove. Ronda, on the other hand, seemed past the point of words; if Draca didn’t know any better, he’d say that she’d go up in flames at any moment.
“You’re not going to the ball, boy, and that’s final!” Vernon shouted at Harry from the kitchen. Harry had tamed his hair as much as he could, and although he had failed miserably Vernon had still picked up on the change. When Harry told him that he was planning on attending, he had laughed in his face.
Hermione laughed ruefully and rolled her eyes, subtly gesturing towards the Knight with her slim shoulder.
Silence. Ron seemed to be calculating, eyebrows scrunched in confusion.  Hermione, on the other hand, was on the cusps of laughter; she was covering her mouth with her dark hand. “Harry,” She said. “That’s...incredible! I can't believe this!”
“Maybe you’ll meet a nice bloke who’ll put up with your crap,” Ron mumbled under his breath. Hermione sniffed.
“Eager, aren’t you?” Harry asked while struggling with the buttons.  “God, why do you wear so much fucking clothes all the time?” He hissed, practically tearing Draco’s first layer off in frustration. Draco took in a shuddering breath, feeling the hot outline of Harry’s cock against his thigh. It...was a generous size, Draco could tell, and suddenly his legs turned to jelly. But Harry couldn’t know that, he’d already humiliated himself enough, so he gathered every ounce of self discipline he had left.
Despite the intense urge to run away and go lock himself away for eternity, Harry maintained eye contact and nodded.
“What?!” Draco said, sudden panic squeezing his insides. “I won't let them! And we've put plenty of charms on the tent, haven't we?! They won't see us!”
“He’s not?” Hermione asked with a sly grin. “Seems to me that he fancies you as well, Harry. Why else would a filthy rich noble ask you for swim lessons?”
Malfoy snatched the shoe back with unnecessary force and Harry just barely caught a glimpse of  the blond’s shaky hands. He pointed with one long-nailed finger.
“Why’re you…” Harry began, trailing off when his eyes fell upon Draco’s exposed collarbone. “How come you came to find me?”
"In case you haven’t noticed, Mr. I’m-the-Prince,” Harry chuckled at the sheer hilarity of the idea, “I am a servant.”
Draco’s legs were spread lewdly, and Harry groaned at the sight. “You’re always so pretty for me, aren’t you?”
Draco shrugged. Harry was about to question further when Draco lost his footing and fell onto the basket of dirty clothes dumping the basket’s contents and Draco into the river.
“You just-- for fuck’s, sake, Potter! You’re embarrassing yourself.” Draco’s heart was in his throat. Draco? Why the bloody hell had Potter thought to use his first name? He wanted to hear it on repeat, a recording to use as wank material, maybe--
Draco laughed, genuine and light, tracing his fingers against Harry’s exposed chest. “You really are an idiot.”
Draco pounded on the rickety door of Potter’s house and tapped his foot as he waited for a response. When no one greeted him, he knocked once again, Harry’s loafer in his left hand.
“You’re just as bad as them, you know,” Draca grinned slyly, white teeth contrasting with her pink lips. “For spending so much time with human dirt.”
Draca’s eyes narrowed, and she took a decisive step forward. Soon, she was only inches apart from Harriet, and could make out every fleck of blue sprinkled in her otherwise green irises. Her voice was low, challenging; and...something else. “You’ve got some nerve, Potter. Meet me in the girl’s lavatory after Herbology. We’ll finish this there.”
“Fantastic, aren’t they! First thing I thought of when I saw them. And we can have as many as we want!” Ron said dreamily. “Can’t believe I got this damned job, Harry. Best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Harry laughed and shook his head, ironic warmth suddenly filling his chest as the thought of the Royal Family. Draco. Draco, Draco, Draco. He’d never repeated a word so many times in his mind. Although a bit concerning, Harry couldn’t help but feel giddy over this new infatuation, no matter how futile it would surely prove to be. At least I know he’s attracted to me, Harry thought with a dim pang of fondness and arousal as he remembered the hopeless look in Draco’s eyes the first time he touched him. Perhaps, Harry thought with a ridiculous surge of hope, he’ll choose me.
“Merlin,” Ron seemed to calm down, then, and he smiled. “All the more reason for you to enjoy a fancy night, then.”
“It’s not bad, Draco, you priss, just get in!” Harry shook his head, water droplets spraying about, and Draco was momentarily reminded of a wet dog.
Draco was throwing himself quite the pity party as he sat at his mahogany desk mulling through his Potions homework once again. He’d gotten a short but pleasing flight in before his lessons, but somehow it didn’t seem to be helping clear away his inner turmoil like it usually did. Why Potter? Why did he have to be painfully attracted to him, of all people? For as long as he could remember, Draco had been able to get what he wanted with a swish of his hand and a curt request. But Harry? He couldn't have him, ever, and he felt like throwing a hissy fit. Unless, of course, his rather hopeless plan succeeded. (Which, Draco thought. It won’t.)
Harry shook his head in an attempt to snap himself out of it. Whether he liked it or not this was his life, and there was little he could do other than grin and bear it. The only activity Harry sometimes looked forward to these days was his daily trip to the marketplace. He lived in a large city and most people knew little of his lack of magic, earning him the treatment of an actual human being. On days where there was little shopping to be done, Harry would pace around the city and savor the blissful feeling of freedom. Maybe today, if he was lucky, he could clean the war zone that was Dudley’s room in time for him to make his run to the market. However cleaning it would be a nearly impossible feat in itself; he didn’t know if he could survive it. Some of the stuff strewn on the floor, Harry had observed, were definite health hazards, such as those pretzels that grown several strange, green, furry masses. Harry shivered in disgust while scooping the burnt, misshapen eggs onto the fine china plates that his stepfamily insisted on using. After placing them on a serving platter with two cups of lukewarm tea, Harry began his ascent. First he dropped off Vernon’s plate, leaving it on the nightstand with only a fat hand leaden with jewels waving him away as acknowledgement. He dropped the remaining platter on Dudley’s lap, giving Dudley, who had nodded off, a rude awakening.
The sky is the same color as his eyes, Harry thought absently. Grey clouds basked the Muggle beach in a dim, cool light. The tide was low today-- the waves were small and steady. A few muggle women, university-age, sat towels a few feet away. Harry leaned over towards Draco’s ear and kept his voice low.
“Oh. Do you...want me to…?” He asked throatily. The Prince nodded, still keeping quiet. Harry took a cautious step toward him, head spinning. The Prince, the second most powerful, prestigious man in the entire kingdom, wanted a kiss from Harry? Harry? Well, Harry thought as he rested a tentative hand on the Prince’s waist (again) , I’m not going to turn him down.
The boys had the Gryffindor common room all to themselves today as a result of the campus' Christmastime lull. Despite copious amounts of available space, Draco and Harry had chosen to sit together on a plush, small sofa. Draco had his head in Harry's lap like the princess he was, and the crackling fire warmed their bodies.
That was when Potter stood up, dusting his hands off on his slacks and leaning in towards his friends for what looked to be an embrace. Fuck. Draco crept up the stairs as quickly as he could, practically threw himself into the bedroom, and took a seat at the desk. The chair wobbled under his weight and he tried to steady himself. He took a breath and began shuffling through the case files in an attempt to appear busy. Though mentally bracing for it, he was still startled by Potter’s noisy entrance. Potter flopped onto the cot, practically snapping the thing in half with his weight.
Harriet stopped in her tracks. Her eyes, inhumanly green, locked onto Draca’s; she would have shied away if it wasn’t for the sake of her dignity. Harriet’s chin-length bob was a mess as usual, but still framed the soft structure of her face. Round glasses sat, slightly crooked, on her small, button nose. When Harriet spoke, her gaze never wavered.
Harry took the sandy item from Malfoy’s hands and dusted it off with his own. It was indeed a child’s sandal, made out of leather. A small white flour was sewn into the strap.
Before Draco could snap back with an insult of his own, Potter was already flagging down the barkeep. Fluffy black hair covered her eyes and she wore a tattered apron.
Narcissa put her nose in the air in a gesture of mock-offense. “Are you implying that I can’t visit my son and his wonderful husband when I please?”
“Hello,” Harry nodded. The Knight nodded back, making his way over to Harry and shaking his hand heartily. Harry’s eyes widened when he noticed the particularly large sword hanging heavy on Ronald’s thigh.
Harry blanched , throat tightening at Hermione’s explanation. “Shit,” He said, stupidly hoping that this was just one big, cruel joke.
“I’ve suspected that The Prince would be showing up any day now. The King would never let him come find Harry, of course, considering Harry’s a wanted man and also scum in His eyes.”
“I guess,” Pan said, shrugging his broad shoulders. He scrunched up his pug-like face. “Can’t bear those fucking Mandrakes. They’re the spawn of the devil.”
“WHO THE BLOODY HELL IS KNOCKING ON MY DOOR AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?!” A booming voice met Draco’s ears and the muted light of a candle flickered to life behind the dusty stained-glass window.
And then he was off. Despite the servants and knights that practically begged to follow him around whenever he so much as left the castle, Draco held up a dismissive hand and continued on his way, alone. The bustle of commoners outside of the castle gates parted ways for him like the red sea, and Draco beamed. That right there, he thought, is something I’ll never tire of.
“Shh, it’s alright, you idiot. I understand,” His voice was low, musical almost, and Draco's chest ached. “But I won't give up, I hope you know that. Magic or not.”
“Draco,” Lucius said clearing his throat, “I expect that you will be getting married within the year as your mother and I are getting old, and you are the only heir. You must find a strong partner and continue our bloodline immediately, for the sake of caution.”
The tent was ripped apart by two large men donning thick chain-mail. One of them bellowed, “I’VE FOUND THEM!”  And Draco watched in horror, screaming Harry’s name, as the boy he loved was hit with an electric green spell and sent flying. Harry landed a few feet away from what were now the ruins of the tent, body limp and lifeless.
“You’re so fucking hot like this, Draco,” Harry murmured, grinding against Draco only slightly. Not enough, Draco thought desperately as he grabbed onto Harry’s collar and yanked, hoping to get the message across without words.
“Alright then,” Harry picked up the first paper, pushed his glasses up on his nose, and scanned it. He grimaced slightly and then handed it over to Draco. “Autopsy report. Seems this Muggle didn’t die a quick death.”
He managed to get there in a few minutes. The moon was full, illuminating the scene in front of him. And sure enough, there was Harry, staring up into the endless sky like Draco had seen him do so many times before. Green, Draco thought for the hundredth time as he quietly took in Harry’s glowing features. He’d never seen eyes so green. As Harry continued craning his neck upwards, sloshing his feet about in the black water, Draco wondered if perhaps he was wishing for something, or flying somewhere else. Maybe he needed a broomstick.
Draco tried and failed to obey, slipping on the slimy walls of the river and staring distastefully at the mud on his hands. Harry groaned, hoping he sounded repulsed at the idea of touching Draco’s bare skin again. Because frankly, he wasn’t.
Harry gestured to the extravagant, pale blue robes falling loosely around Draco’s slender frame. Harry had to admit that they looked damn good on him, despite the fact that they were a completely and utterly ridiculous wardrobe choice.
Draco seemed to realize how enthusiastic his reaction had been, cheeks coloring as his face returned to its usual hardness. “Er, I mean. I’m pleased to have found you here, Potter.”
“Afraid you’ll mess up your clothes?” Harry said patronizingly, eyeing Draco up and down. “Ron tells me you have an endless supply.”
He sat for a moment, eyes flitting between the mountain of paperwork and his own shaky palms. He stood up stiffly and locked his office door.
“I’ve come for our lesson, Potter. With a substantial amount of payment. How much you receive will be based on your performance.”
All Harry could think to do was run. He turned around, ignoring Draco’s calls of “WAIT” and “POTTER!”. He didn’t look back, noticing absently that the large grandfather clock above him had just struck midnight. He laughed ruefully when one of his shining loafers flew off. He did not stop to pick it up.
Scorpius practically vibrated out of Harry’s arms, wiggling around in excitement. “I want circle glasses like Dad!”
“My dear boy,” Narcissa said, kissing the top of his head. “How I’ve missed you.” She had been on a diplomatic trip to the American Wizarding Colony, and had only just returned after two weeks.
Neville revealed the news enthusiastically. “Her name is Granger. Hermione Granger. Smartest witch you’ll ever talk to, I swear it! She’s young, like us. Just graduated from the School for Muggleborns.”
The King crossed his arms, brows furrowed. “It seems that your original beliefs were correct, and that my doubts were unjust. He does have power, my son. Copious amounts of power.”
Harry rolled his eyes, grasped Draco’s shirt collar, and kissed him with everything he had. When he pulled away, he net Draco's wide eyes and sneered: “I look like a beggar? What about you? Wearing normal clothes must be killing you.”
“Shitting on them?” Draca asked, feigning naivety.  A thrill coursed through her veins at the heated loathing in Harriet’s eyes. “Me? I’m only stating a fact, Potter. A Mudblood boy and a Blood Traitor girl. Bet they’d have some pretty nasty looking offspring, wouldn’t they?”
“Places to be, hmm? Can’t I come with you?” Draca asked sweetly, wrapping a teasing arm around Harriet’s slim waist. After getting a good whiff of Draca’s flowery shampoo, Harriet raised her eyebrows.
Harriet waited for a few moments so as to avoid suspicion, and then made her way out of the classroom, shadowing the remaining students. After the coast was clear, she stealthily made her way to the unused lavatory down the hall, where she hoped pathetically that Draca was waiting for her.
Draco snarled, clearly insulted by the accusation. “Of course not! Servants may be inferior, but we aren’t savages. We don’t
“Shut your good for nothing mouth, Potter, or my father will hear about this,” Draco said sternly. He continued before Harry could retort. “However, you were indeed successful in teaching me the rudimentary skills I’ll need to become a swimmer, so I believe some payment is in order.”
“YOU’RE BLINDED BY YOUR OWN IDIOCY!” He bellowed. His words were pure anger, pure ferociousness, and yet they still contained a calm, even control. “You've brought shame upon the Royal Family. Every ancestor, every pureblooded witch or wizard who has shaped our legacy for centuries, betrayed.”
Harry stared, dumbfounded, as the pair grabbed their personal belongings and walked away towards the car park. Draco Malfoy liked men? Harry never would’ve thought. Though, he supposed he hadn’t known that fact about himself until recently. Once the girls were out of earshot, Malfoy turned to Harry with a defensive glare. Only then did Harry realize that he had been staring at Malfoy stupidly.
Harry continued his day with yet another trip to the market. That seemed to be all he’d been doing these days, and frankly he was getting rather bored of it; however anything was better than being stuck at home with his uncle and cousin. Having nothing to buy and no chores to complete, Harry thought that he might stop by the library again despite the fact that he hadn’t any books to check out or return. Something about the sincerity of the place drew him in.
“Yes, I am suggesting that you chase him down. Apologize. Explain to him that he shouldn’t treat you any differently. Isn’t that why you kept it from him in the first place?”
Scorpius ran to her, delighted, and hugged her as hard as his tiny body could allow. “Gramma! Gramma! Gramma Nasissa!” He said, still unable to pronounce the Late Queen’s name properly.
“So are you going to come over here or do I have to push you into the river to get my hands on you?” Harry smirked, suddenly sly. Draco sputtered, face hot, but said nothing and walked awkwardly towards Harry. He sat down cautiously, grimacing at the scrape of his embroidered robes against the dirt and grass.
And yet, he had an aching need to show up and prove to* ...what was his name again? Potter) that he was superior than him in more ways than just status; he was born better, and he would surpass him in even something he didn’t quite know how to do yet. But there was also...a fondness? Something about Potter’s uncivil behavior towards him  made his stomach flop,  made him feel...normal. Not that being normal is a good thing, he thought as he stripped off his satin pajamas and began to dress himself.
“PLEASE! LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE, KILL ME. JUST KILL ME! PLEASE, KILL ME!” Malfoy was looking through Harry, true panic in his moonlit eyes. Harry panicked and backed away until Malfoy grabbed his hand with such force that Harry’s fingers throbbed.
“Yes, I do. Now listen. You need to use your legs. They aren’t just dead weight, you know. They’ll keep you afloat.”
Harry swore under his breath, caught off guard. Merlin, Malfoy was hot. And not in the way the blond viewed himself, what with his own pseudo ego and all. No, Malfoy was hot because he was so embarrassed, and so needy, all in one. Harry allowed his eyes to flutter closed for a moment.
“What?!” Ron seemed have worked it out, now. “ You mean...the Draco you’ve been talking about is the bloody Prince?!”
“Yeah, well. Not like I was at all prepared to have such an esteemed guest in my office today,” Harry pulled up a chair and shoved it towards Malfoy. “Sit.”
Harry placed a confident hand on Draco's soft, freshly-shaven cheek and gently pulled him forward, connecting their lips. They had kissed on multiple occasions since they had become official two weeks ago, but that was all. Harry struggled with keeping his pent-up desires in check.
Harry quickly threw on a pair of clean robes and bolted up the stairs to his stepbrother’s room. He knocked on the door a few times, trying and failing to tune out the obnoxious orders being shouted at him from all different directions. Sometimes Harry felt as if these people forgot that he barely possessed the ability to use magic. Well, unless that fact was being used to belittle him. Harry had been called every bad name in the book by his step family: Squib, muggle, and even a mudblood despite the fact that he was none of the above.
Pansy just shook her head, silver earrings dangling about. Draco was about to get up, only to remember something and flop back down onto Pany’s lap.
The rest of the night consisted of merriment and laughs, recounting old Hogwarts stories and reminiscing. Harry, though pleased to see his friends, found that he couldn't stop his thoughts from wandering to the other man upstairs. What was Draco doing up there, exactly? How did he look sitting at that old desk? He would stand out quite a bit, Harry thought absently. Such an affluent-looking man sitting at a rickety old desk.
“I shouldn’t be wasting my time with a lowlife like you,” Draco said. “But I suppose I’ll do it for the experience.”
“Bloody Gryffindors,” Draco says under his breath, still refusing to meet Harry’s eyes. “You're all complete and utter imbeciles.”
“Hmm…” Harry began, barking out another laugh at Draco’s horrified expression. “Kidding, kidding. Of course I have.”
Draco looked hurt for a moment, shrinking back, but then his eyes hardened. “If I were to find a companion in any insignificant Squib, Potter, it would have been you. But you’re not. I’m sure of it.”
“Hello, Harry! Where are you off to today? I don’t see any laundry," Neville said. Harry smiled at his soft features. His teeth were a bit too large for his face and his eyes were kind and warm. A fondness for the boy hit Harry, then; he was glad to know Neville, no matter how fleeting their conversations might be.
“S-Shut your mouth, you sad sap,” Draco mumbles, cheeks glowing. There’s a snowflake on his pale eyelashes and Harry almost wipes it away. It melts, however, so he settles for cupping Draco’s cheek and stroking the soft skin there. Draco is rigid for a moment, shocked by the tenderness of the action. Harry sighs, brushing clumsy, mitten-glad fingers through white-blond hair. The two have been an item for months now and Draco still is not used to being treated this way. Not used to being loved.
“But Draco, he’s basically treating you no better than a whore, ready to sell you off to the highest bidder-”
Draco’s smile fell at Harry’s apparent shock. He was silent for a moment, face reddening, and suddenly he looked like he was about to cry, blinking rapidly and tensing up. “You don’t..?”
“You need to work on your patience,” Harry bluffed, although he was close to caving himself. He made quick work of Draco’s last layer and grinned hugely when he saw how hard and wet Draco already was.
An image of the servant from earlier, Potter, all powerful muscle and copious amounts of magic that had made Draco’s stomach drop (although the commoner had never seen fit to use his magic for some reason in front of Draco) flashed through his mind.
Over the past few weeks, Harry had visited the library multiple times. It was nice having friends; for most of his life, the only company he had were his action figures and the kitchen rats. Of course, he’d talked to many people in town, but never had he had actual bond such as these. Ron and Hermione were easy to talk to. They had shared many laughs throughout the week, and Harry was grateful for that. As such, he found himself at the library yet again after his afternoon chores were completed. The two were bickering amicably and Harry smiled; this scene was becoming oddly familiar to him after a week of witnessing it.
“I can’t believe you’re making me do this,” Draco moans, scraping his manicured nails against Harry’s palm for emphasis.
“Of course I can. You don’t really think I’d allow myself to be trapped in this wretched tent in the middle of the wilderness without necessities, do you?” Draco swished his wand a few times, pointing it towards a cracked teacup resting on the table. The cup turned to unblemished porcelain in an instant.
“Someone must’ve had a good night’s rest,” He mumbled, cracking an egg into a stone bowl. Harry noticed that Draco’s satin blue apron did wonders for his figure. His hair was mused from sleep, sticking up this way and that, and he looked impossibly gorgeous.
In the past, Draco would have made a stink about Hermione’s blood status and her biological inferiority, but today he decided to keep his mouth shut. And if that had something to do with the image of Harry that suddenly appeared in his mind, no one would ever know.
Draco was positively beaming. His eyes, normally sunken and sad, shone brighter than anything Harry had ever seen. He donned his usual attire (Harry found that he’d gotten rather used to Draco’s unexceptional disguise) and wore heeled boots.
Draco glared at Harry, but without malice; their friendly tormenting of one another hadn’t ceased in the ten years of their marriage.
A small, almost inaudible whimper escaped the Prince’s lips at Harry’s words and his grip went lax. Harry took this opportunity to gently press the Pliant Prince against the wall. He was so delicate, so pristine, that Harry thought he might break him if he used anymore force. The Prince, however, almost demanded it, practically yanking Harry closer and placing his hands on his hipbones. Harry blinked quickly, trying to clear away the sudden heat pooling in his groin. The Prince was just so needy, Harry could probably make him beg if he wanted to, just like he had imagined he could do with Draco. The Prince was blond, too, and a similar height; so naturally Harry could not help but allow his thoughts to wander. And when the Prince allowed himself to be manhandled by Harry, it was almost too much; Harry granted himself the pleasure of abruptly slotting his thigh between the Prince’s legs and biting a kiss into his pale neck. The Prince moaned, allowing his voice to be heard for the first time during this encounter, and fuck, he even sounded like Draco. Part of Harry wanted the Prince to keep the mask on so that Harry could immerse himself in his own twisted imagination, but he knew that would only serve as fuel for his unwelcome desires.
“Master Draco, Dobby would very much like to accept that, no one had ever said sorry to Dobby before and Dobby is accepting you little master.”
Draco had made his way to the library after classes, like Potter had asked him to. He felt piercing green eyes on him as soon as he stepped through the door, it wasn’t hard to find the table either Weasley’s hair stuck out like a sore thumb in the sea of brown that made up the library. Draco was only somewhat surprised to see Hermione sitting with the duo, of course he knew they had become friends during first year he just wasn’t sure what the uniting factor was, now he supposed it was the troll attack. He decided not to think too deeply into what his involvement in the matter could change about the future.
Draco stepped down and hesitantly faced Potter. When he saw potter was smiling with a crooked grin he smiled back.
“Mr Malfoy, welcome. Let’s see, let’s see. Now your mother’s wand is an 11”, Blackthorn, unicorn hair. I wonder, I wonder. And your father of course...” the old mans voice trailed off as he descended further into the shop, he was scanning boxes and then reaching up and then. Then. There it was. In Ollivanders hands. His wand. His wand.
Looking at the man now, he looked like he had before Bella had got to him. He looked mental and happy, and his eyes weren’t glazed over and he wasn’t crying. That was good Draco thought.
“If this is true, then let me say that I am very impressed. It was a difficult shielding spell indeed that perhaps saved your life - along with the Granger girl. I will ask you now to make your way to your dorm room. But know Draco that I am always available, should you need to talk. You know how I care for you don’t you ?”
Draco nodded, looking straight at his father. He had learnt when he was younger to always maintain eye contact with the man who sat in front of him now. He was five when his father smacked his across his cheek for looking at his nails while he was being lectured.
Draco was aware that Professor Quirrell should be monitored closely, closer than other professors. But he wasn’t doing anything abnormal, as the days in November began to fewer, nothing was out of the ordinary.
Time went quick while reading and writing for Draco, he didn’t notice his compartment door opening until a voice snapped him from his journal.
Severus Snape had always been good to him, he wasn’t necessarily a good man - he was complex and layered, but everyone can be complexed and layered. He could be horrid when he wanted to, he had the ability to be a biased, slimy git when he disliked someone, but when he liked someone he cared, with all his heart. He cared about Draco in a way no one else did. Draco’s mother had cared for him, but not in the same way, she cared hesitantly and in secret but Severus cared loudly and with great might. He stood up for him against his father, he battled Lucius with words when he believed the blonde man to be too cruel to Draco. Lucius could be cruel like no other, he would humiliate and frighten Draco because Lucius believed it would make the boy a stronger man but Severus knew different. He wasn’t afraid of others, of what people thought of him.
The day after Halloween his mind had been consumed of Azkaban, he hadn’t eaten at breakfast and was unlikely to eat for the upcoming meals either. He had nearly considered telling Severus about being sent back, and while he knew that his godfather would help him and would never got to the ministry, he was still unwilling to tell.
Being sent back had made him unbelievably scared again, scare that if anyone found out he would be sent back to Azkaban, the ministry wouldn’t believe him if he said it was accidental and that he wasn’t the same man he used to be. Apart of him knew this thinking was childish and idiotic, but he was a child again and he was allowed to be scared.
The manor was bigger than he remembered, he supposed it was because he was eleven and shorter than ever. The last time he saw his childhood home the man was there and Draco was in pain. The last years Draco spent in the manor he was always in pain. His youth his home had been one of happy memories, of Pansy being chased by the peacocks and his mother humming in the morning. His later years in the manor had been nothing but pure dreadful pain, it wasn’t really his family home those last years . The man had take it over. The man had ruined it.
“There was this dog. It has three heads. And we’ll, we think it was guarding something. It’s just, Dr- Malfoy, you’re so smart and powerful and well we don’t know what to do.”
The day was the 31st of July, he remembered this day, when he lived it for the first time. It was the day he met Potter. The day he had first saw him, in madam malkin’s. And Draco was reliving it. Why, he wasn’t sure.
Had this happened last time?Had Hermione been there last time as well? Had Potter saved her? What if this was new, what if she died? She couldn’t die, not like this. Hermione had survived being tortured by his family, she could die at the hands of a troll.
He didn’t know what to do, he hadn’t been here last time- if this had even happened the last time, he just needed Hermione to be safe and not to be killed by a stupid troll. He raised his wand and muttered ‘protego totalum’, he knew as soon as he had done it it was a mistake - he was meant to be eleven, his magical core wasn’t meant to be strong enough to create that sort of shield yet, he shouldn’t even know that speed but he didn’t care, Hermione was safe by his side and Weasley and Potter were fighting the troll.
“Right.” Potter coughs, gaining his attention for the first time since Draco sat, ignoring Potter is easier than dealing with that look on the boys face, the one that makes him want to cover his scar-the one that isn’t there anymore. It’s the way he looks at Draco, like he’s actually looking right at him, it’s unnerving and unwanted and so hard to ignore. “We need your help.” Potter says.
His heart pounded and his hands went straight up to grip his face. He wasn’t him anymore. He wasn’t nineteen anymore. His hair wasn’t past his shoulders, it wasn’t near as long and he didn’t have that god awful scar that started on his neck and moved to his chin, the scar that Potter had left him. He traced his fingers across his face, touching the shadow of where that scar sat. The scar that he hated so much, the scar that made him cry so many nights. Draco moved his hand down his chin and then onto his neck. He breathed. In and out. Then he made it to his forearm and looked down. It was gone. Oh. It was finally gone. The mark that he had tried to burn off, tried to cut off. It was finally gone, and left was his smooth pail skin. His skin felt so soft beneath his touch. So young.
“I’m Draco Malfoy.” Weasley laughed, like he had before. Seeing his face closer than last time Draco supposed the laugh was out of nervousness not real hate.
“I knew you’d protect your precious head of house, Malfoy.” Weasley groaned, “But you weren’t there and we -“ he gestured between himself and Hermione “we know what we saw.”
Draco supposed this made sense, Potter had always favoured loyalty - while Draco would protect those he cared for fearlessly- he wasn’t one to just be loyal, he had to care about the person or understand how his loyalty towards that person would benefit him. Making certain changes this time round would not be easier because if Potter. He wanted to save Slytherin, wanted to save Vincent and Severus. His mother. He didn’t want to be scared. Potter couldn’t help him.
“We will be taking you by floo an hour before the train is set to leave, your mother and I will see you off. Is that understood ?”
His second time at a Hogwarts began to feel like his first time all over again, with Potter shooting him glares in classes, across the great hall and every over place he saw Draco. It wasn’t exactly like his first time, he cared a lot more, he was a scared eleven year old boy who was unsure of himself but this time he knows. He’s still scared but he knows and he can do good, he doesn’t care about the same things, not about grades or status, he doesn’t care about Potter in the same way either. He isn’t obsessed with the boy-who-lived this time round, he knows the boy is important but he also knows that he won’t help Draco. The decision to not help the trio was selfish, he wants to spend more time with the people he’s lost but Potters attitude towards him seemed like a complete change after the day in the library, at first Potter was inviting him everywhere and constantly wanting Draco to help him but now it was full of far away glares and hard shoulders.
He assumed Mcgonagall had just placed Potter on the team, which was completely stupid and irresponsible as it always had been - first years weren’t allowed to play for a reason, when he heard his name being yelled.
“I was invited, Weasley.” Draco drawled. He looked towards the table wondering wether he should sit, Hermione was sat next to Potter on one side and there was and empty chair opposite Potter next to Weasley. He sits.
Then, of course, at two in the morning, I write back. I can’t sleep. Every stupid thing always seems so much smarter when you can’t sleep. Every stupid thing always makes so much more sense in the dead of night than in the light of morning. I take out my journal and open it.
Harry would like to say it was easy, loving Draco Malfoy. He would like to believe that it was one of these love stories that inevitably end because people change and ways part, but that was beautiful and soft and full of light before it was over.
Instead, I busy my mind with work and try to forget that I am increasingly unsure of what I want to do with my life. I don’t always succeed. I try my hand at journaling again.
“Nice to see you haven’t changed either, Draco. I almost thought you’d grown a heart when you agreed to help, but I should have known better. I should have known you wouldn’t understand what it means to love something, to want to save it or fix it. My bad.”
“I’m not homophobic or anything!” is your brilliant reply, and you’re not entirely sure you should be allowed to speak ever again, not when you keep saying the worst possible things at the worst possible times.
I sit. The corridor is clean, if bare, and dimly lit. There certainly aren’t any signs that someone is living here but I can hear several voices coming from another room. Before I can change my mind about being here, the witch appears again.
There are a few teens too, those whose home life was dire enough that Harry was compelled to ask them to come and help with the renovation. “As a favour,” he said, remembering that kindness is sometimes barb-covered and cutting when you've known nothing but indifference or violence your entire life. They’re good kids, the lot of them. Each of them hurts in their own way, with the spiderweb cracks of abuse and loneliness visible on their souls, but they’re full of life and laughter, and they’ve all started to heal.
She absentmindedly plays with the understated strand of pearls around her neck. Despite her serene face and her gracious posture, this is not an easy conversation for her, Harry realises. (It is not an easy conversation for him either, learning of a past he’d never looked close enough to see. It’s not an easy conversation at all.)
, Draco’s waiting for him on the balcony. It’s a beautiful day, the spring sunshine warm and generous and flooding everything with light.
“I want you,” he whispers all the same. And it is all he ever wanted—this, just this. Draco and him and the trees above their heads, this hushed-soft intimacy of brokenness and desire. It’s all he’s ever wanted, it’s everything he thought about when he came into his own hand in the darkness of his room, when he cried into his pillow at night—and it’s finally happening.
You end up at the Unicorn and Thestral. It’s not a choice, not really, it’s just warm and loud, it’s just got alcohol and your friends, and you hope you can lose yourself in it all. You can’t, of course, the alcohol just fuels the dark, heavy cloud of rain and hurt pulsating just behind your ribs. Ron makes a joke, and everyone laughs, and you just think of Ginny’s words, of how their sharp points have pricked right through your skin and lodged themselves in your bloodstream.
The words hit Harry like a punch to the lungs. He sprang to his feet and stared at Draco. Draco’s face was a forest fire or tidal wave, and all Harry’s words left him.
I couldn’t go to Saint Mungos, Ron insisted. Not until we knew what we were dealing with and who we were against. I was only too happy to agree. I didn’t particularly fancy my boss knowing that I spent my lunch hours in shady shops, drinking unknown potions made by suspects. But I still needed to get a proper check-up, and at some point in the discussion, Hermione said something about Theodore Nott. I remembered him from school, barely. Slytherin, friends with Draco. A bit of a wanker. He was different, now, she insisted. He was in a relationship with Lavender and ran an activist clinic for werewolves in a discreet part of town. He was a trained healer, and he wasn’t going to tell anyone about me. And he was my best choice, wasn’t he? My only choice, too.
“I guess I haven’t been that reliable, have I?” you say, hands falling away from Draco’s face and down to his shoulders, his arms. You can’t bear to stop touching him, so you let your hands take his instead of falling limply by your sides. “Maybe you were right before, maybe I am too broken, but—”
“Draco. Draco, listen,” he says softly, the words unhurried and unstoppable like water gushing from an alpine spring, like the endless motion of the waves, “I know you said we couldn’t work out, and I know I said I’d respect that, and—I’m sorry, Draco. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you how much I wanted you to stay. Let me do it now, Draco. Let me fight for you.”
“I, oh, I love you—oh Harry, oh love, oh love, oh,” Draco cries under him, grabbing the mattress with both hands as he lifts his hips to meet Harry’s thrust. “You feel so good, oh you feel so good, oh Harry, you make me feel so good. Oh, Harry, I’d forgotten. Oh don’t stop, don’t stop...”
So this is the chapter that earns this fic the tag "Quite a mess with POVs really" but I think it's also where things start to get interesting. I hope it'll work for you.
“I wanted to, you know?” Draco’s tissue paper voice is barely louder than a whisper, all tear-stained and fragile. “Fix you. Make you happy. Deserve you, even. I really wanted to. I went about it all the wrong way, though. I’m sorry.”
And she is not wrong, reader, but this is not where this story should begin, is it? No, if you are to share her anger, if you are to partake in her righteous outrage, we ought to start at the beginning. We ought to start with Harry Potter.
You come hard, face pressed against Draco’s collarbone. For a blissful moment, your brain is entirely silent, entirely empty, entirely bathed in light and warmth and happiness.
He’s done it, he thinks. The house is his, now. His to love and cherish and restore to its former glory. It’s what he’s always wanted, isn’t it? He should be happy, now. Grateful, at least. Counting his blessings and finding silver linings.
. He walks through every room, opens one of the numerous pots of paint sitting like silent soldiers against the wall in the corridor, paints a room, or two, or three, or however many he manages before pain breaks him in half again.
“So you’re telling me that if I promise the ghosts they can stay and if the house believes me,” Harry answers slowly, “it’ll let me bond with it?”
Harry feels strong hands at his shoulders, guiding him gently towards the ground. Under his naked back: Draco’s heavy wool robes. Scattered in his hair: yellow-crackle leaves. Hanging about his head: the fog-cotton skies. And all around him, oh, all around him: Draco. Draco. Draco.
“And I don’t think I can make it through another breakup, Harry. Not again, not with you. It hurt me too much the last time. Believe me when I say I barely made it out alive. I can’t do that again, Harry. I just can’t. I’m sorry.”
“I think I’ve figured out what I’m going to do about the house,” Draco tells Harry the next morning. “I’ve been thinking about Wilmine Witbooi’s work on buildings with what she calls a
The same is true for you. I can assure you we definitely know each other. I’ve known for a while, since you’ve told me your age. I'm twenty-six too. We were in school together. Please… Just… Please. Give me a chance too.
The ghosts move away from Harry as Draco starts the intricate incantation. The glittering gold patterns that shoot from his wand climb like ivy on every wall, gorgeous and mesmerising. Harry casts his half of the spell too, then: cool blue light washing over him and diving deep inside his flesh to pool in his magical core.
“How does it feel, Draco?” you coax him. “How does it feel, fucking the golden boy? How does it feel making him come undone underneath you? Do you like it? Do you?”
Harry walks through the bushes and the brambles that now grow wildly in what was once an immaculate park. He should not have snapped at Draco, he knows this.
She stumbles into my office on a Tuesday morning, all perfect makeup and sleek shiny hair, her stiletto heels striking the flagstone floor in sharp, short, deafening taps.
“I hate that I can’t seem to make the words go away,” she adds after a beat. Her voice is small and wet and radiating with pain.
There is nothing I’d love more. I’ll be waiting for you in front of that whatsitsname shield. Meet me when you’re ready.
Sometimes, what everyone sees in you is not who you are. Sometimes, you live your entire life thinking you know yourself and then, you realise that you really don’t. Sometimes, you think you have your entire life all figured out and then everything you thought you wanted turns out to be everything you hate and you don’t even know what to do anymore.
Draco doesn’t move, and you think he’s going to push you away, so you murmur into the skin of his neck: “Don’t you want to take the golden boy apart, Draco? Don’t you want to stain him, to taint him? Don’t you want to show him exactly how dirty he is? How inept a saviour? How much of a sinner? Isn’t it what you want, Draco, what you’ve always wanted?”
You bring your pint to your lips, draining the amber liquid in one swallow. The alcohol sets fire to your bloodstream. It doesn’t make anything better. Ron is still laughing, and Draco is still looking at you with his metal-heavy gaze, and your chest is still about to burst from the firework explosion of every human feeling at once.
“I knew I’d see my mum, you know. And my dad. Sirius too,” he continues because the words have turned into a waterfall, now and because he’s been drowning in the ocean of that story since the war ended, “I knew I’d be reunited with every single person that ever loved me in the entire world. I knew I could decide to walk into their arms and never have to fight or hurt or bleed again.”
Everything smells of smoke, as they kiss in a half-burning street, hungry hands fisted in each other’s shirts and robes and hair. Everything around them is burning, and still, they kiss and kiss and kiss, and the world could be ending, they wouldn’t stop kissing because, reader, they’ve waited so long for this moment to finally come, they’ve wanted this for so long, and they’ve been so ashamed and afraid of wanting it, and it’s here, oh, reader, it’s finally here.
Draco is sitting cross-legged on the floor again and talking to the ghost of a young woman. She’s dressed in an old-fashioned, knitted dress with ruched sleeves and a large bow at the collar, and her hair is all done-up in curls. On her face is a large, delighted smile as she talks. When she throws her head back and laughs, the sound is crystalline and joyous, and Harry thinks he’s never heard a sound quite as beautiful in a long time.
I don’t notice the writing on my skin at first. There is much to do here. The litter of kneazles Luna brought in last week need to be fed every hour, and I’ve been preparing the Erumpent’s winter feed. By the time I finally see it, others have already started to appear on my skin. I catalogue:
“Could have fooled me, Potter”, he spits, before opening the door and disappearing into the empty darkness of the hallway.
“Hello,” Harry says, feeling oddly out of place in his own house. Like he’s interrupting a reunion between two old friends.
I would anyway. Touch you. I would explore every part of you. Every inch, every fold, every hill and valley. I’d take you into my hand whispering soft words of praise all the while. You’d let me do that, wouldn’t you? I would caress you, taste you, worship you. I would make you come as I stared into your eyes and whispered your name.
It has long been pointed out by scholars that certain spells might fall out of use, not because they are harmful or because they are rendered inefficient or inadequate by the progress in magical spellwork, but because they don’t fit with the social mores of the time. Amorae is a perfect example of such a spell.
And yet, this is exactly what he does. I find myself alone in room 50, staring confusedly into a piece of embellished bronze.
is the reason I’m being threatened. They want me to stop looking into Draco’s disappearance. But see, I think that if I had been a man, I would only have gotten that one. The one about minding my place, that one is about hurting me as a woman. It’s about making me feel scared, and violated, and intimidated.”
“A lot of things are fucked up when you’re a woman, Ron.” Hermione’s voice is brittle. “I am frustrated and angry and scared. I am a lot of things right now but you know what? Surprised is not one of them.”
it has white and blue flowered wallpaper, a white-painted desk, and a view of the sea. There is something calming about the air here, about the way the architecture is delicate and gorgeous, with white lattice-worked wooden balconies and pastel-painted facades; Harry feels almost at peace for the first time since Draco left him in an alpine inn, alone and heartbroken with an empty house that was always meant to be shared.
When Harry makes his way back to the house, drenched in sweat and rain, he finds Draco still in the piano room. There is someone with him, Harry realises as he opens the French doors and the sound of animated conversation immediately wafts into the wet morning air. Harry steps inside.
It started with the weight of expectations breaking Harry’s back as Draco and he were putting the finishing touches to Grimmauld Place (the house entirely habitable by then, with every dark spell washed away from the walls and every awful portrait safely burned or hidden or locked away in a vault.)
“And what did he come here for exactly, to break your heart? Was that your deal? I’m not one to judge, but that sounds like an incredibly ill-conceived plan if it was.”
I am not going to ask how you got into my home. I am also not going to ask why the letter you left is full of teeth marks and smells like gnome.
The second time the exploding extension explodes, Harry Potter has been sitting at his desk and thinking about Draco Malfoy for longer than he cares to admit. In fact, Harry hasn’t been able to think about anything but Draco since the first explosion, seventy-four hours, fifty-one minutes and twelve seconds ago. And all the while, the blinds to the office of “Patrician Potions” have been closed, and Harry thinks he’ll go entirely mad if they stay closed any longer.
Harry didn’t have a plan for the refurbishment, but he had money and an obsessive sort of fascination for the large, empty sanatorium. Eventually, the historical building committee decided it was enough, and less than a month later, he was handed the keys to his new home.
“It didn’t ruin his relationship with me,” Harry answers because what else can he say? Despite her graceful posture and soft voice, there is unbearable pain in Mrs Malfoy’s words. There are admissions of guilt like bruises on her skin. (Regret like broken bones just underneath the surface.) “He could have come back. I would have forgiven him in a heartbeat.”
Someone must have cast the spell on me, I realise. I push myself to my feet. And the people who love meddling with my life, I know only too well, also love informing me that they have. I walk to the pile of unopened letters sitting on the small wooden table in the kitchen and I take a deep breath. This is going to take a while.
The voice is deep and male. The question startles me. I turn around. Behind the counter, the wizard repeats:
“Oh, don’t worry, Potter. I’m not here for love. There’s nothing but sex between us. Absolutely nothing but sex.”
“I want this place to be a safe haven for magical and squib teens who need a break from the world while they deal with stress or trauma or any kind of mental illness,” Harry answers, his voice suddenly more serious than he would like. (
(Later, you’ll throw up in the Ministry loo, shame and want and anger leaving your body all at once. Later, you’ll punch the wall, and it’ll stop you from crying, and you’ll pretend that it counts as being fine.)
“Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself, Potter. It might have escaped you, but the world does not always revolve around you. You do know that my good friend Pansy works in the Ministry, right? You do know that you are not the only human in the building?”
“I’m afraid you’re going to pull out at the first homophobic slur thrown at you because those are bound to come. I’m afraid people will be angry with me for stealing you, for having the gall to tarnish you. But mostly I’m afraid that—I’m afraid that if I get what I’ve wanted for so long, I’ll end up losing it, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to recover from that.”
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
When I finish writing, my eyes grow heavy. I don’t even read my words again. I feel satisfied that I’ve helped fate along, free now that I’ve opened my heart. Nothing to lose, I tell myself as I slip underneath the covers of my bed, and quickly fall into a dreamless sleep.
You turn away from him, cradling the bottle in your arms like a petulant child. He crouches beside you, tries to pry it out of your hands. You won’t let go, and the amber liquid sloshes dangerously behind the cold glass. You give the bottle a sharp tug, and then, all of a sudden, you’re flat on your back and Draco’s lying on top of you. The bottle rolls away from you, the liquid slowly spilling on the floor in small, sticky puddles. Neither of you notices.
Pansy’s eyes are bright with tears when she stops speaking. She reaches over my desk and covers my hand with her delicate fingers. Her skin is cold and smooth on mine, and I look up from the notes I wasn’t taking anyway.
Pansy, if you’re not on a date, can we talk? Potter left me a note in the middle of my living room, and possibly bit a hole into my nice scarf, and wrote about the proposal debacle, and—he still loves me, Pansy. He still loves me. I have no idea how I feel about that.
Pictures. Shit. You try to think when they could have caught you with Draco. You remember you knocked on his door in the middle of the night, dishevelled and frantic. Of course, you know what it looked like. It looked like exactly what it was.
His words are quick. His face is pained. You stifle a laugh. Of course, you’re both broken. Of course, it was never going to be easy, you and him, because there have always been expectations placed heavy onto your shoulders, heavy and cold, because you grew up around a war, like trees around metal fencing. There are cracks in your sense of self, and they run too deep to ever heal without leaving pink-ribbon scars, raised and smooth and shiny-skinned. Of course, you’re afraid and hurt, but you’re never going to be any different, you realise. This is who you are: broken and half-healed. You can’t be anything else, not right now, not when you’ve only just started to put dow your shield and show yourself to the world.
Iris is smiling as she floats towards them, her arm around the waist of a pretty girl with bright lipstick, several piercings and outrageously pink coloured hair.
“It’s you,” Draco whispered back, and in that moment, Harry could have sworn they wouldn’t ever part.
“The biscuits might have been laced, though,” I interject. “They were in your desk. No one except you was going to help themselves to them. Do you keep your desk locked?”
When Jemima Graves makes it to the scene of the explosion, it’s four in the morning and half the street is on fire. As she steps gingerly over the flames to inspect the faulty charm-work attached to what was once a gaudy yellow and orange facade but is currently a jumble of charred wood and a thick layer of soot, her left shoe catches on fire. If Jemima Graves were a different person, a less professional person, perhaps, she’d decide this is not worth her time. She’d take her shoe off and throw it at the burnt facade, she’d promptly Apparate back to her own pristine home to lie down in her soft bed and leave this awful, flammable mess to be dealt with in the morning. But Jemima Graves is not that person, so she settles for casting an Aguamenti at her feet and pointing an accusing finger at a tired, confused red-headed man in happy-hippogriffs pyjamas.
“I’m looking for Theodore Nott?” I say, despite the nagging feeling that I’ve gotten the wrong address. “Is this… Is this a clinic? Hermione Granger gave me this address.”
He moves, then, just a little. Harry whimpers and grabs Draco’s wrists, kisses the palms of his hands and sucks his fingers. He moves again, and again, and again. The motions slow and gentle but unrelenting like a rising tide or a setting sun.
“Wait… What happened?” I ask because I’m suddenly flooded with the nagging feeling that whatever happened, it is serious.
), and you feel him push into you, slowly. The feeling is bright-sharp, heavy with pleasure and edged with pain. Draco moves tentatively, and the sinful sounds he makes are almost enough to bring you over the edge.
It wasn’t a conscious decision, breaking up with Draco; it was one Harry only realised he’d taken once it was over with, and by then, he was already too far gone to do anything about it.
Dug another few inches. Had a nap. Blond nuisance came out today and made quite a racket. Thought my ears were going to fall from the yelling. Strongly dislike him.
The next day, the paint sat on the floor in clean stripes, like an invisible hand had pulled it off the walls.
Draco lets out a soft little whine, the kind that sounds exalted and anxious and lightning-struck all at once.
he told himself.) Instead, in the gold-pink light of late afternoon, he took off his shoes and spread the paint in thick layers on the wall, white as the snow outside and just as glistening too. It was dark, by the time he was done, and every bone in his body hurt but as he sat on the floor paint-speckled and work-satisfied, every room was brighter than it had been at the beginning of the day.
“I’ll make you feel so good, love. Just you wait, darling. Just you wait. I’m going to make you feel so good.”
“Draco, as my heir you realize you have a duty to marry a powerful witch or wizard that will strengthen our bloodline.”
“Normally I’d rather die than go to a royal ball. But I promised that haughty arse that I’d show up, so. Thanks Ron.”
Ron shrugged at Hermione as Harry turned around and walked out, trying to calm his rapidlybeating heart.
Harry shrugged and climbed back into his stiff cot. Just as he was about to fall back into a dreamless sleep, Malfoy whispered:
Harry snorted and cut Draco off with a much bolder kiss. He laced his fingers through Draco's hair and waited for a complaint or protest, but none came. Draco simply shivered and responded with a dart of his own tongue.
Draca’s body went slack, and Harriet struggled under her weight for a moment before both of them sunk to the tile floor, breathless.
“I never admitted to having feelings for someone!” Draco swallowed, palms suddenly clammy. Harry was...a Squib, wasn’t he? The powerful magic Draco must have sensed was surely a trick of his mind, a grasp for straws; however his mother did have a point. Malfoys were notorious their magic-sensing capabilities, after all. If Potter had been able to use magic as a child…
HERE IT IS!!! THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF SMUT. i was so happy to finally RESOLVE THE SEXUAL TENSION! sort of.
The Muggle woman’s face fell a bit. “Ah, it’s always the handsome ones isn’t it? Well, have a good day then.”
Draco would have sworn on his own future grandchildren that he’d only gone to spy on Potter and his friends for research purposes. To...further understand the man he was being forced to work on this case with. That was all. He’d thrown on a t-shirt and a pair of work pants after trying and failing to actually learn anything from the case files. Now, as he walked down the stairs into the taven, he felt as though he was being puppeteered by some invisible puppet master-- one who got off on his suffering, apparently.
“Merlin, what’s gotten into you?” Draco says halfheartedly, breathing on Harry’s unruly tresses causing them to flutter about. Draco does not pull away; his flush deepens as he pulls Harry’s body closer.
Harriet cupped her face before she could finish her sentence and kissed Draca with everything she had. This wasn’t the first time they had shared a kiss, but in the past they’d always been violent, careless, and without tenderness. Now, however, Harriet took her sweet time, worrying Draca’s plush lip with her teeth. Vanilla, Harriet thought. She tastes like vanilla. She hummed, placing her hands on Draca’s slim, boyish hips.
“Oh,” Harry replied stupidly. “Yeah. Your kicking is off again. Last time I was just trying to keep you from drowning but now I think you’re good, so. You’re just flopping your legs around so you can stay afloat. That’s why you’re not getting anywhere.”
“Father,” Draco protested, “I cannot just marry anyone just because you deem them powerful! You’ve given me a year to meet someone and marry, you practically want me to marry a stranger.”
Harry breathed out a sigh of relief. Ron didn’t mock him, didn’t seem to be looking down upon him, and Harry felt like flying.
Draco was nonplussed by the fact that Pansy seemed to know exactly what he was thinking. She had always known Draco practically as well as he knew himself.
“Do you...have me confused for someone else? I’m a servant, you know. I can’t use magic,” Harry said.
“Oh, dear,” Vernon said quietly, eyes widening as they scanned over Draco’s partially dry, expensive clothing. “My deepest, most sincere apologies. Please, do make yourself at home.”
“I can help you there!” Ron said, puffing out his chest proudly. “Each employee of the castle is given access to the Royal Wardrobe! I’ll get something nice for you.”
“You...you too?” Draco asked in his post-orgasmic haze. Harry nodded sleepily against his neck, and Draco could have sworn that he’d never felt so content in his entire existence. With the welcome weight and warmth of Harry’s body, Draco felt himself dozing off despite their current location. He shook his head, trying to clear away the cobwebs, but Harry kissed him gently, almost pulling him back into his trance.
“Shit,” Harry said. “What do we have, evidence-wise? And, erm,” He gestured towards Malfoy. “Why is he here? No offense.”
“S-Sure,” Neville said, looking rather dejected. Harry couldn’t bring himself to feel guilty; Neville could get his herbology books later. Hermione sighed but begrudgingly followed Harry and Ron outside. The air was warm and soupy, immediately making Harry a bit sleepy.
Harriet tilted her head to the side, green eyes determined and silently belligerent. “Sure, if it’ll shut you up.”
There was that laugh again-- the most incredible sound Malfoy had ever heard.  Then Potter sighed. He sunk down and rested his head on the desk, eyes falling closed. Draco, just half a foot from him, could not tear his gaze away. Potter’s breathing began evening out as he fell deeper into his slumber. His dark eyelashes were long and curled. Draco reached out his hand, almost touching Potter’s hair, before yanking it away and mentally chastising himself. Fucking damnit.
Harry found it hard to breath. Despite being doused in river water, Draco still smelled clean and flowery, like an expensively manufactured cologne, and it was making him dizzy. A charm, perhaps?
“We gotta get the Muggles out. I’ll--I’ll call Kingsley,” Potter took out his Muggle cell phone and began to push some buttons. Draco snatched it from him with a grin.
Soon, Harry was lost in the music. The Prince’s muted perfume and gentle, repetitive melodies lulled him into some sort of stupor; soon the absurdly grandiose clock above him chimed eleven-thirty. He was startled when the Prince leaned impossibly closer, mouth ghosting against the shell of Harry’s ear, and whispered: “Follow me”.
“That won’t be necessary,” Draco said, holding up an elegant, thin hand. “I do, however, have a suggestion.”
“Yes, Ron, that’s what he said,” Hermione said, tapping her heeled shoe against the pavement. “This is fantastic!”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Is that what they’re calling swimming nowadays. Sorry, but that looked more like drowning to me.”
Potter chuckled and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. The other man’s voice had gotten deeper, raspier even, since they had last spoken properly, and that laugh was...well, it made Draco queasy.
“You can look, if you'd like,” Harry said rather cockily, moreso than he actually felt. He’d never given much thought to his own body before, never really cared, but apparently his overly muscular frame (from years of manual labor) appealed to Draco.
“Come on, Harry,” Ron chimed in with a sly grin. “He came all the way here in secret for a reason, yeah? Get going, mate.” He practically shoved Harry out the door.
He sat there for a moment, mind blissfully blank, until the severity of his situation hit him like a freight train. The acidic ache in his chest was not caused by his impending doom; rather it was a result of Harry’s knowledge that he could never, ever be with Draco. If he was dead, he couldn’t kiss him, couldn’t hold him, couldn’t cuss at him. Aside from this, however, Harry’s mind was buzzing with natural adrenaline, the kind that oozes from one's hormone-secretors whilst near death. Soon, he would cease to exist, and Harry’s body knew that; his veins were on fire. Only, as Harry clenched his fists and stripped off his sweat-soaked shirt, he realized that something was not right. He was twitchy, stomach flopping around obnoxiously, and every part of his body felt out of his control.
“Really? You’ll do it?” Draco asked, grey eyes flickering with something Harry might have labeled as eagerness. Harry smirked.
“Father knew right away! The damage you caused...it was incredible!” Draco said, voice trembling with excitement. Harry had never seen him like this, never seen him so happy; and the fact that he was the cause of this happiness had him weak in the knees, panic subsiding.
“I…” Harry’s voice broke, because it was impossible. They were impossible. Soon, they would be found, and Harry would be killed. And that would be the end of it. The end of everything. Harry knew that he should have at least been unsettled by that fact, but his aching chest wasn’t a result of his impending doom; it was all because of the willowy man in his arms. “Never-mind.”
Harry sputtered. “Probably because he’s too ashamed to admit that he can’t swim to someone else of his status.”
“I don’t trust it,” Ron declared, crossing his arms. “He’s the biggest arsehole I’ve ever met. Nothing about the man is pleasant.”
“More,” Draco begged, attempting to shove himself farther onto Harry’s cock immediately, without an adjustment period. Through his cloudy lust, Harry had the mental image of Draco fingering himself, calling Harry’s name. God, Draco’s desperation was going to be the death of him.
“Got it,” Harry said, eyes flitting to the door. He was suddenly queasy. “Should I...go down there? What’s he doing?”
Harry said nothing, pressing his lips against his husband’s once again, backing him into the wall. Draco groaned, pulling eagerly at Harry’s hips. Harry swiped his tongue over Draco’s plush bottom lip, and then took it between his teeth and bit down gently. Draco shivered all over; Harry could feel him getting hard against his thigh.
“Yeah, alright. You've been saying that for years. Now come on, before it gets dark! Honeydukes’ll close soon.”
Upon returning to the Dursley’s, Harry’s positive mood began to dwindle into a somber boredom. As he completed his chores, all he could think about was the infinite amount of tasks farther on his list. They were never ending, it seemed to him. And then, as he splashed his hand about in the warm water he’d brought from the fire to clean dishes with, he was reminded of tomorrow’s plans. The swimming lesson with Draco, that obnoxious nobleman.
Draco shrugged and followed Potter up the rickety staircase. When Potter unlocked the door to room three, Draco was greeted by the scent of must and old wood.
“This is the country. There’s no other wizarding towns around, and this is the only inn for twenty kilometers. Unless you’d have preferred to stay in a Muggle hotel?” Potter would not wipe that stupid smirk off his face. It was maddening.
And then she was gone, heeled shoes echoing down the marble hall of the walkway outside of Draco’s bed chambers.
Pan snorted, clearly deeply amused by Draca’s antics (he’d always had quite the crush on her, after all) while Blaise leaned on a statue of some famous wizard, yawning and picking at her split ends.
