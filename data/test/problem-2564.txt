What in Merlin’s name? He lets out a choked breath. “Why?! When did you do this?”
They get detention for being out of their dorms past curfew and Draco is outraged: it’s his first detention since the Forbidden Forest adventure in first year (any detention in sixth year does not count. Extenuating circumstances). Harry just finds it funny.
“Okay, then why do you think I said that?” Potter smirked, and Draco was overwhelmed by the need to be closer to him, so he nuzzled the crook of his neck and tightened his embrace, rewarded by Harry’s arms strengthening their hold on him.
Harry’s eyes followed him until he disappeared at the corner of the corridor. His attention moved to the bed, and to himself, sticky with sweat. He left the comfort of the mattress and cast several cleaning charms, opened the window, and headed to the bathroom for a quick shower. He’d already fallen asleep after sex, which should not have happened, so there was no way he’d keep lying on the same sheets after tossing and turning in his sleep. Draco appreciated the gesture, as evidenced by his grateful kiss when they both returned.
The next morning, when Harry caught sight of his face in the bathroom mirror, he winced. Draco refrained from commenting on his exhaustion and brushed his teeth quietly, but he ensured Harry ate a substantial breakfast and didn’t let him wash the dishes. With a full stomach, Harry was ready for whatever came next. He followed Draco into the parlour.
Harry’s life had never been normal. He’d gone from a crappy childhood to fighting in a war, and when it was all over, he began seeing things. But without the looming threat of a grinning blob of darkness, this was as close to normal as it’d ever be.
Malfoy looked back at Harry with wide eyes. “Potter! I’m being kidnapped!”
“Potter, I look atrocious, what are you doing?”
It barely took five minutes: the employee hadn’t lied when he’d allied himself with Harry. With his marriage officially recognised and the adoption papers validated, he barely refrained from hugging the life out of the man.
“You’re fine, Malfoy.” He watches the fire’s erratic dance and scratches his head, turning his hair into an even bigger mess. “I was supposed to be in Slytherin. Begged the Hat to sort me elsewhere.”
He didn’t dare hope.
Draco sealed the vial and stood up in all his naked glory. “Don’t fall asleep without me,” he said, and left the room.
“The Peverell family, on the other hand, is related to me,” Slytherin added, and Draco gasped. He didn’t know that!
He stepped aside and heard a muffled sound indicating that Teddy had thrown himself into his godfather’s arms.
It was a great day.
“Sweetheart, come here, please.”
Harry sat down and scooted closer to the hole until his legs dangled in the void, then placed Noodle on the sand and told him to stay there to keep him safe. He met Malfoy’s grey gaze and blew him a playful kiss before dropping to the floor below.
Draco kept his gaze locked on the text and reminded him to use a Glamour. The ones they’d chosen to hide themselves were subtle: the shape of their eyes, the colour of their hair—a shade darker for Draco, a ruby undertone for Harry. It was more than enough. Harry had abandoned his obsession with round-shaped glasses a few years back, and with his long hair and beard, he wasn’t his father’s mirror image at all. Draco, with his short, artfully ruffled hair, pierced ears, elegant borderless glasses and full sleeve tattoo concealing the Dark Mark, didn’t look like a Pureblood prat anymore, so Glamouring himself was almost too much. They were safe.
Draco made himself at home on the other couch. “No, thank you. Hangover Potions and hot drinks don’t match.” He sniffed and glanced at Hermione’s book, his arrogant air more endearing than annoying now that Harry knew that his hair looked like dandelion fluff in the morning (Draco had sworn him to secrecy. He’d never survive the shame if the public knew). “Were you trying to map something?” His eyes switched from the book to Harry, and his eyebrows rose.
“What were you trying to do before I got there?” Draco wondered, eyeing the state of his clothes.
Teddy scrambles and slides under the couch. Chuckling, Harry peeks at him, and Teddy frowns. “Go ’way! They can see you!”
Harry tried taking a peek, but his eyesight betrayed him. “Is that for the kitchen?”
He rolled his eyes and extracted the relevant memories once he found his wand, which had fallen between the bed and the nightstand.
They planted it together last summer, and it grew at an incredible rate after Luna told Draco to use a special fertiliser on it. Draco nods. “It is. And yes, Slytherin is like that. Not the cosy, comfy, bright Hufflepuff. Sorry.”
“Yes, Kreacher.”
“If you’re dating, please introduce us, I want to meet whoever makes you smile like that!”
The Golden Boy’s frustration was growing, though. He tried to drink on his own but spilt his glass. His attempt at cleaning it up failed when he dropped his wand while a spell was already shining at the tip, and only Draco’s quick
“Do you need help with something?”
“You look surprised, Potter.”
Harry empties himself in Draco’s fist, and he follows soon after. Then he laughs because he can’t do anything else, because he’s just so damn happy, and Harry kisses him over and over again, a beautiful smile on his face.
Again, that twitch of his lips. Harry found himself glancing at him more as the minutes went by, catching the many expressions he tried to conceal. Malfoy wasn’t good at the whole Pureblood mask that some, like Nott or Greengrass, excelled at. He was too quick to anger. But over the years, he’d always been trying to impress someone or project a particular image, only letting out his emotions if they were negative—if something pushed him over the edge. “Something” usually being Harry. The way his eyes roamed across the walls, how his lips parted slightly, the lack of scowl or sneer—it made Harry curious. What was Malfoy like behind closed doors? With his actual friends, if he had any? Goyle was more like a minion, it seemed. Maybe Parkinson? She was a harpy, but perhaps only in public.
It didn’t take long. The shadows gathered and grew. Harry stood his ground.
It takes a few seconds before Draco raises his head. He casts a brief glance at Harry and sniffs. His hair falls into his face, so Harry can’t see his expression for more than a second, but it’s obvious he’s been crying. Before a contingent of Aurors comes to his rescue, Harry casts his Patronus. “Tell Hermione the Manor didn’t eat me, and I’m fine.” Prongs vanishes, and Harry’s attention switches back to Draco, who is now peering at him with red-rimmed eyes.
Harry blinked, confused, and almost refused, but something in Ron’s eyes caught his attention. A gleam he’d often seen in Fred and George’s gaze when they were planning something. “I’d be happy to. I’m free for a few hours.”
It was December now. For the past two months, Harry had lived the life he should have had from the start—and he still struggled with the truth, the fact that he was not a freak, that he deserved to be happy and loved, but it was getting easier every day. Jim and Draco had taken care of everything, taking him out of the school system by using magic on Aunt Petunia to make her sign some papers. Because he willingly called the basement home, the blood wards were strengthening. He spent most of his time learning with Jim and Draco, who must have been very rich not to have jobs to go to. He was getting a normal education (Muggle was the word, apparently), but the best part of his days was when magic came into play.
“Why, Potty, I’m touched. What makes you think I want you behind me?”
“No keys, just wards. I’ll add you.”
That could work. He stared at the man expectantly.
“You heard me.”
They don’t find much, but still more than they expected. The Chamber has areas where large groups of students could hide. It has food reserves under centuries-old stasis, general supplies and a considerable number of unmarked barrels - a sensible idea at a time where magic was starting to be looked at more closely by the Muggles. While the church-sanctioned killings didn’t start until the Founders and their children’s children were dead and buried, they still happened occasionally, and Hogwarts had been under siege - not because of magic, but because of the insanity that was Britain and its numerous kingdoms at the time.
Draco opened his eyes with a soft gasp and twisted his body to make sure it wasn’t a dream. Then he scoffed. If he’d been dreaming, Harry wouldn’t have globs of drool in his short beard. He was so scruffy in his sleep. Merlin, but Draco loved that prat. And he wasn’t scared, which astonished him since he’d always been terrified of opening himself to others, of letting them see him. But he’d never had that issue with Harry; he’d shown him the worst of himself, the darkest parts—was that why he was okay with this? With being vulnerable? Draco pushed people away before they could know too much, but that wasn’t a problem with Harry, was it? Draco had nothing left to hide from him.
“Yes, you’ve said so before.” She started smiling with a slow tilt of her head. “Blood adoption is still an option. How is Mr Potter?”
. “The ones we had at Hogwarts were more impressive.”
Resentment runs deep in the Ministry, and children of Death Eaters are not always treated kindly. It’s an excellent reason to avoid renting from a magical landlord, but luckily for Draco, there’s a much bigger world around them. Harry can’t help but smirk as he tells him to widen his horizons. “You should hunt for a Muggle flat.”
Harry blinked and chose to face this head-on, quite certain he’d decrypted his snake’s words. He tightened his hold on Draco’s wrist, just enough to check his mood. If Draco didn’t want to talk, he’d tell him off. Since he didn’t, Harry’s Gryffindor boldness surfaced. “It’s the laws, right?”
“As I was saying, the wards are loosening, and I believe they should let you through. When you are rested, with your bellies full, the carvings will guide you through the old evacuation route.”
“You’ll be happy, Harry. So very happy. I want to give you what I didn’t have.”
Draco sniffs, and eats the last of Harry’s calamari. “We’re not sappy, we’re supporting each other in the face of your incessant blabbering.”
Without the memory in his head, Harry didn’t struggle to close his eyes again, but he let himself be the little spoon, loving the feel of Draco’s soft tummy against his back and the pressure of his palm on his chest.
Draco was the kind of person who never invited anyone into his home unless it was cleaned and decluttered, and since he was such a messy tenant, he rarely had his friends over or, Merlin forbid, his mother. But he thought nothing of it when Harry stepped into the hallway for the first time and had to dodge a pile of shoes that Draco could've put on the shoe rack but didn't. No, all he did was look around with his mouth open.
After smoothing his wrinkled trousers, Harry started biting his nails. Draco gave him a gentle slap to make him stop and Harry blew him a raspberry in return. Then Harry stood up. “I can make pasta. There’s cheese, but no tomatoes.”
"Ah, the joys of central heating." In Draco's imaginary future, Noodle would bask on those tiles every day, and Harry would fill their shared wine cabinet with low-quality beverages from Lidl. He chased those images away, but they were soon replaced by explicit ones as Harry moaned at his first bite of pizza. "That good, huh?"
He wondered what his ancestors would say as he settled in comfortably beside his partner and started to read.
“Go, then, but don’t take too long.” Draco sighs at his son’s insistence that every house-elf must be talked to. He keeps the backpack close to his chest and tells Mother about his and Harry’s weekend trip to the Faroe Islands. They’ve seen parenthood take a toll on more than one couple, and they’ve sworn to do their best to keep the passion going. So, once a month, they travel somewhere together for two days, leaving Scorpius with his grandparents. Once a week, they have a romantic evening and ask one of their friends to watch their child. If there’s a Quidditch match or another impromptu event they want to attend, Astoria is always delighted to babysit the boy she carried. Scorpius loves everyone; unlike Harry and Draco, who cried the first few times their baby was away from them, he doesn’t mind one bit.
.” He flicked his wand at the Basilisk, making it glow. “Then, when we need to come back, it’s
Advice is on the tip of his tongue, but is it the best time? The Ministry and the public can go fuck themselves, as far as Draco is concerned, but Harry’s mind doesn’t work that way.
“Okay.” Harry takes the toy and adds it to a growing pile of items he’ll buy in advance. “Thanks.” He chews his lower lip, and says, “Did it hurt? Your tattoo.”
Prompt for this chapter:
Harry couldn’t let go of the wardstone anymore, he didn’t want to. He kissed Draco breathless, unable to figure out what else he should do, and happier than he had ever been. He’d never be alone again; Draco had given him the most wonderful Christmas present.
There’s a part of Draco that is now strutting like a proud dad; it’s seriously impressive. It’s also his baby’s first real display of power, though the anti-carrot shield Scorpius once cast around his mouth was rather clever already. There’s another part of Draco that now worries about Albert targeting the little boy for the next decade if he sets foot outside.
They kissed softly and headed to the bathroom, not letting go of each other. Draco left a trail of clothing, flour and egg behind him, and almost forgot to remove his socks because Harry’s mouth was
“Outside?”
He decides on another course of action. He lets go of his hand and wraps him in a gentle embrace. “Whatever you decide, I’ll be there. I’ll support you.”
Draco smirked at the mess and went back to his work, even if the effect of the wards on his arm was uncomfortable. The bathroom was done a few minutes later, as were the floor and walls of the bedroom. He added a closet, desk, chair, bedside table, double bed, bookshelf and even an incredibly fluffy carpet under the bed, then placed magical windows that would show the back garden despite being underground. He could spell them to display anything, like some of the windows in the Slytherin dorms, but preferred to keep it simple. When he was finished, he looked around, wiping sweat off his brow. He couldn’t wait for Little Harry to see this. Now, all he had to do was go shopping (and help his husband with the rest of the house).
Harry shuddered as his mind replaced what had been taken. He’d been so safe here. Why did his head have to open itself to an intruder again? What would it take to earn the right to a normal life? He welcomed the grounding heat of Draco’s hand on his knee, unsettled by the intensity of the feelings in that silver wisp.
He didn’t think skating would be so hard. But the rental skates were clunky and hurt his feet, and it was a lot harder to stand than what he’d believed. Teddy was much more agile. Draco, the prat, had disappeared with his mother so they could ride the Ferris wheel.
Draco stood on his knees, wearing two blankets like a cape, and grabbed Harry’s shoulders. “I’m going to kiss you, and do so many things to you tonight that you won’t remember your own name, so I hope you can keep up.”
Draco swallowed and raised an eyebrow. “I’ll have you know I made it my mission to fill your cupboards with palatable food. And before you say anything, no, that salmon is not top of the line, nor is it more expensive than that whiskey-and-honey ham you bought last week.”
“I don’t?”
. Of course.
“No,” Slytherin replied with a defeated huff. “Someone else could stumble upon it, and I’d rather not risk it. Is the enchantment active?”
Harry was still emotional about the incredible Almanac of Mischief, and he wondered what else Draco had gotten him that required going back outside. Thank Merlin he hadn’t given him the book yesterday at the Burrow, because Harry would’ve bawled in front of way too many people. Narcissa, Andromeda and Teddy witnessing his tears had been enough.
Wizards weren’t immune to Muggle diseases; they were just less likely to catch them since magic gave them additional protections or fought viruses faster. He’d known that he could suffer just as badly as Abel after both of them caught the flu two years ago. Learning about immunisation had been a revelation. He and Scorpius were now vaccinated against every recommended Muggle ailment.
Arms hugging his right leg, Draco tilted his head and smiled. “You’re right. Birds are much smarter.” If this was supposed to distract Harry, it worked. No hint of fear lingered when his partner acted like a lovable prat.
Malfoy lit up. “Lead the way.”
Harry shook his head. Kreacher was one of a kind. He watched the empty wardrobe fill with elegant robes that should hopefully fit Draco, and he decided to check the pantry. No doubt Malfoy would appreciate a snack.
“Malfoy,” he said, “you’re bleeding.”
Harry didn’t want to listen. No, he did, he just didn’t want to be so obvious about it. That break-up had been in the papers, because at the time, Draco was still gracing the pages of the
“Is it Draco?”
Hermione shakes her head. “Ron, we just ate, I’m sure Harry doesn’t feel like flying.”
“I thought you hated it,” Harry replied, lips stretching into a small smile.
It had been easy too. He’d believed in the shite he’d been spouting.
“Oh, I just really enjoy staring into the void with a book close to me,” Harry sighed, rolling his eyes. “I can’t read, obviously. Turning the pages hurts.”
Standing at the window with a glass of wine in his hand, Draco watched the fog gather on the surface of the Black Lake. Pachelbel’s Canon in D Major echoed in his quarters, bringing him some much-needed peace after a long day. He despised Tuesdays. His third-year Hufflepuffs had been in an experimental mood. Melted cauldrons, ruined desks and unusable ingredients had been the least of Draco’s worries because three students had ended up in the infirmary after breathing in the toxic fumes they’d accidentally unleashed.
When he was little, Draco loved walking in the gardens of the Manor, pretending to be on the way towards a magnificent adventure. Lucius blamed Tolkien, one of the rare Muggle authors he didn’t despise, because Draco spent weeks looking for the One Ring and fighting the peacocks (“They’re not birds, Father, they’re Orcs!”).
Sirius focused on Harry instantly, saying his name with a broken voice, as if he hadn’t talked for a long time. “You—you look so much like James!”
“We spent a week cleaning up, and some of the stains are still there.”
“Harry, is Salazar here?” Hermione asked, her eyes locked onto the small print of a thick book.
From his seat, he could see the street when someone entered the bar and could only stare at the gaudy letters of McLaggen’s Pride on the other side of the alley. He arched an eyebrow, curious as it hadn’t been there three months ago. “McLaggen—Gryffindor? A year above us?”
If Draco wanted news of the Golden Duo (sans Potter), he just had to ask. Pansy and Granger worked for the same law firm and had become closer over the years, to the point where Pansy had been the first person aware of her divorce from the Weasel. The worst part of it? She hadn’t told Draco, out of loyalty for her colleague.
“Have a safe trip! Chereka has your rooms ready.”
“Shut up.”
Draco Disapparates. Lightning strikes again, there’s a whirring noise, and suddenly the apartment is so dark Harry can barely see. The clouds are thick and make it seem like it’s the middle of the night. Through the rather thin floor, Harry hears a loud thud and a muffled “fuckity fuck fuck fuck” and he can’t help it, he bursts into laughter.
Draco asked, despite knowing the answer: “Why are you smiling like that?” He hugged Harry from behind and kissed the back of his neck.
“Really?” he whispered, struggling to comprehend what was happening. He had a vision of her as a tiny little girl in the Hogwarts library, surrounded by a tower of books and admonishing him and Ron for not reading
Damn, thank Merlin there was no alcohol involved tonight. Why was he such a blabbermouth? Was it the Malfoy effect? Or perhaps Harry was just too lonely. That was more likely. Neville had teased him about his tendency to talk too much when he spent long stretches of time on his own. On the other hand, it was funny to see the Prince of Slytherin so gobsmacked.
took care of his thirst. He then attempted to stand up and winced at the dull pain in his hips. He ruffled through his bag to find a kaftan, selecting a white one to fight the heat of the desert. A few more spells and he was clean, even if magic couldn’t replace a shower. After getting dressed, he rummaged through Draco’s belongings, still looking for his lost sock. This fruitless endeavour had caused a fight the previous evening (Parselmagic did not, in fact, help in finding errant pieces of clothing).
“You’re an evil git,” Draco declares, drying his shoe with a spell.
Draco knows that, but it’s fun to rile him up. He walks into the bathroom, all black marble and wide mirrors, sheds his clothes and steps under the shower, the water just a little bit too hot on his skin. He washes his hair, eyes shut. Even with the Dark Lord at the Manor, the movement of his fingers on his head always soothed him. Now, it’s a habit that he doesn’t wish to break. He takes his time, enjoying it until his traitorous brain chooses to imagine Harry pushing him against the wall.
But Malfoy is already leaving. “Nice seeing you, Potter,” he calls out as he walks away.
(image: A man wearing a Christmas jumper with a text saying Jingle My Bells)
He knew he wasn't hallucinating: Harry had become more tactile lately and his eyes often lingered on Draco's body. But Draco didn't want to deal with the awkwardness of a one-night stand, and he wasn't quite sure what to do. He couldn't forget that Harry had been hard when he'd hugged Draco in the desert, and the sizeable bulge intrigued him, but what would be the point if it was just sex? Draco wanted Harry to himself all day and night, forever. So what if he was possessive?
Draco braces himself when Harry opens the next door, but the sight is so shocking that he can only gasp and cling to Harry’s hand.
He rummaged under the bed, unable to see anything until he touched the small box he’d hidden there under several Notice-Me-Not and Repelling Charms. Not that anyone could touch it without his consent; familial artefacts of that sort were impossible to steal without their owner’s approval.
Nodding, Draco flicked his wand. “
The elf peered at him as if he expected to find some kind of deceit in Harry’s expression. “Master Harry wishes to endanger Master Draco?”
Titbits of information on Malfoy’s life were strangely thrilling. Harry liked taking his mask apart, had always enjoyed it, even at Hogwarts. Hopefully, he was no longer obsessed with him whenever he acted out of character.
It leads him down a narrow corridor where only one door is open. There’s light inside, the curtains are partially open, and it makes all the dust stand out even more. Harry notices a wall of empty bookshelves, but it’s not what he’s here for: Draco is crouched in a corner, next to a vase filled with dead flowers. It’s like he’s attempting to blend in with the wall, or to appear as small as possible. For the first time since they met in March, Harry truly gets it.
Potter. Scarhead himself, wearing a blue jumper and jeans that, for once, fit him like a glove, steps into the common room. He looks around, sees Draco, and asks if he’s bothering him.
“Can you set the table?”
Narcissa found the carousel charming, and Harry heard her say she wished she’d known those existed when Draco was small. There was such a soft smile on Draco’s lips after that! Harry could barely stand the adoration fogging his brain. Andromeda was smirking, so as soon as Teddy left the carousel, Harry thought the most brilliant idea ever would be to go to the ice rink. He needed to move a little if he wanted to clear his mind enough to stop acting like a fool.
“Can you stop- just- no, Scarhead, I don’t need help!” That unimpressed stare is amazing and unnerving at the same time. Yes, he can take a shower on his own. He can take off his clothes, too. “I’m not infirm!”
“Bellatrix had a Horcrux in her vault.”
“Think she’ll still be alive? She’s what, a hundred and fifty?”
The gasp he lets out pains him. He blinks back tears, letting his vision return to normal. The wind blows his hair away from his forehead, but as there’s no one around to see his scar and ask for an autograph, he’s not bothered. He’s outside, far from the noise and the heat. Everything is fine. Well, the ball in his throat is still there, and he knows what’s coming next. He needs to sit down. There’s a short wall to his left, a few steps from the establishment, hidden in the shadows. His entire body is stiff as he walks there and hoists himself up on the wall, letting his legs dangle. The concrete is like ice under his thighs. It brings the weather to his awareness, and he shivers. The constriction in his throat tightens. He’s no longer about to pass out, he knows that, but now he’s stuck in a whirlwind, and all he wants to do is cry.
“You’re showing off.”
’s offices. It’s a few doors down the street. He thanks her and casts a
“Excuse me, sir, but why do you look so different from your other portrait?”
Harry tuned out their conversation. Every year, H.E.A.L.E.R. took a week off for the holidays, but many customers refused to understand why. It wasn’t like Harry could accomplish much if he took on a case, anyway. Like Malfoy Manor, most of their houses were equipped with a Weather Charm, so all Harry could do was work on the inside of the building. If those people hadn’t wanted to expand their homes, it would’ve worked, but he had yet to encounter a customer who didn’t wish for more space.
“It’s fine, Harry.” He kisses him until he relaxes.
Harry is already lounging on the bed, reading a Quidditch magazine. He wears blue pajamas that have seen better days. It takes Draco a minute to adjust to his presence. He slips his legs underneath his fluffy quilt and grabs a book without intending to read it. It would be a waste. He wants to know Harry better, but where to start? They might appreciate each other’s company, but they don’t talk about private matters.
“Ernie’s mum?” Harry shuddered. Spiritual leeches were on the same level of nastiness as parasitic entities, albeit much easier to get rid of. “Should I go now?”
“Malfoy—”
“Leeches,” Draco declared with a grimace, leaning against the doorframe. “On Mrs Macmillan’s hands.”
Harry thought a sleepy Draco was the cutest thing ever, and that included the moody, cranky man he turned into when he woke up too early. Draco was like a cat; perhaps his Animagus form would be one. He enjoyed sleeping, lazing around or napping, and wasn’t keen on going to bed after midnight. Christmas had tired him out even more than usual, and Harry had expected him to doze off on his shoulders. Yet it was past his bedtime when he’d asked Harry if they could go to the Manor again. Draco had sounded solemn and Harry, intrigued, had agreed to go back outside in the cold and call the Knight Bus since he could still feel a pleasant buzz after drinking.
An hour later, when Ron and Ginny were trying to stall Molly’s questions about their own love lives, Harry brought Draco to the garden. They both had a fresh mug of mulled wine, though Draco wasn’t drinking it too fast and would likely not finish it.
He, on the other hand, had been taught Pureblood genealogy from the cradle. And Slytherin knew it, given the way he was looking at him. So, Draco took a deep breath and started talking, eyes locked on his hands.
“Oh.” His brief smile makes Harry’s insides flutter. “Thanks.”
“I said I was sorry, I don’t know what you want me to do.”
“We love you too, Malfoy.”
“Already?” Harry’s laugh was barely more than an exhausted wheeze. “I don’t think we can.”
Draco stepped back and smirked. His cock, hard and leaking, was such a mouth-watering sight that if Harry hadn’t known he was bi, the mere sight of it would’ve made him fly out of the closet with a rainbow cape on his back.
There’s one thing Draco doesn’t like about the third Sunday of the month, and it’s visiting Malfoy Manor to pick up his son. He knows it's all in his head at this point, but he can’t shake the memories of the Dark Lord’s rotten magic seeping through the walls and poisoning the air he breathes. Unfortunately, after years of exile, Mother and Father have chosen to come back, purify the grounds, and settle there permanently. So, regardless of how rude it is, Draco Apparates into the main hallway so that he can avoid looking at the house looming over him from the top of the hill. Mother understands and never says a word about it. Floo travel is out of the question; Scorpius is allergic to Floo powder.
She transferred the biscuits onto a plate, forming a messy tower, before glancing at him. “Harry James Potter, that was not subtle.” She rolled her eyes when he grinned. “He’s adorable, of course, but you knew that. Blaise is still a mother-hen.”
“I am not dense.”
Draco laced their fingers together and gave Harry’s hand a little squeeze. “Come on, I want cotton candy. You’re paying since you dared exhibit such uncouth behaviour in front of all these people. Public indecency, I say.”
His lips curled as he replied, “Well, how hard can it be, really?” in a lazy drawl. And it was true, wasn’t it? Draco’s talent lay in potions, and he’d always imagined that cooking had to work the same way.
“Well, what about a quiche?” How hard could that be?
Harry’s cheeks are warm, and he bites his lip, grinning. “Okay. Call me Harry.”
was what ate Potter alive?
Draco had no idea how the Burrow looked, for all he’d criticised it as a child, but he was mildly horrified by the comparison. “So, you see why I need your assistance.”
In his head, Draco’s voice tries to convince him to take the bait. That’s the first time in years Hermione gives him such an opening, and the emotion in her eyes is so obvious Harry can’t help it. He hugs her, and she latches onto him. Is she okay? Has she been pretending to have her shit together all this time? Was Harry wrong about his friends? He lets her go but keeps a grip on her hand. “Promise to listen?”
“Do you want a quiche or not? If you’re not comfortable making one—”
Cooking in the wizarding world could be a hazardous occupation. When a regal Eagle Owl dropped a letter in the bowl of icing and proceeded to shed feathers all over the kitchen counter, Harry threw a shield charm so potent it made Teddy’s blue hair stand up straight. Biting back a string of curses Teddy was too young to hear, Harry grabbed the bowl as sticky little fingers reached inside.
Harry snorted, and Draco flushed. “Fuck you, Potter.” That psychotic elf would be the death of him. “Kreacher, get my lab ready.”
“Hey, I haven’t seen you in ages, Harry!” She scans his books with her wand. She doesn’t ask how he is, or if he has been sleeping, or eating, and he doesn’t ask her either. There’s a ring on her finger, and Hermione often tells him about her, as if hearing about his ex’s life could push him to get his shit together. It doesn’t work. “Oh, I love this series,” Cho adds, and hands him the books back.
“I want it.”
He could hear Malfoy muttering about brash Gryffindors, so after a few spells cast in quick succession, he told him there was nothing down there aside from a pulse of neutral magic. Malfoy sent floating lights his way, and they scattered to illuminate a wider area. Harry noticed a short tunnel to the right and could see the end of it. Instead of acting rash and walking straight in there without thinking, he closed his eyes and chanted, welcoming the familiar darkness in his head. He found a soft glow at the back of the tunnel, matching the magical signature his spells had detected.
Slytherin smiled, soft eyes only confirming that Harry was absolutely, completely gay. “You can do anything. I’ve seen it in the past few days. You boys have so much potential. Never doubt it.”
Mother would love her new scarf and Andromeda would be grateful for the set of cutlery—she’d complained that her current one had sharp edges and bent too easily. Teddy would, hopefully, fall in love with his Apprentice Potioneer Kit Volume II. Harry—well, there were a few enchanted lubes and massage oils Draco would give him in private, thank you very much, but Draco had also asked the Hogwarts Headmistress if she could send him every detention slip from the Marauders, minus Pettigrew. He’d bound them into an entertaining book he’d titled Almanac of Mischief. Harry didn’t care for
Unspeakable Draco Lucius Malfoy says yes.
She hovers behind them, placated for now, then Harry fucking hisses at the sink and Draco’s heart leaps out of his chest. Only years of learning to hide his emotions prevent him from showing how surprised he is. He waits for the fear to come, and when it doesn’t, he takes a deep breath.
article would be necessary; in five minutes, everyone in Diagon Alley would know.

“Wine, Potter?” He snatched it from his hands and frowned at the label, before pushing the bottle back into Harry’s hand with a mildly horrified gasp. “No bloody way. Who bought this? There’s a 1985 Malfoy Apothecary in the cellar.”
Malfoy shifted and eyed him, expression neutral. “I expect payment for every bottle you open, touch, or smash in your drunken stupor.”
“Anyway, a few days ago, I found listening spells in my and Anthony’s office. I was furious and complained to Robards, who told me to speak to Ron and Terry. That’s how Anthony and I were brought into this whole operation. Lisa is our contact in the Department of Magical Transportation.”
“More for me, mate. Cheers!” Ron says in delight.
The Yule tree (okay, fine, it had been a Yule tree for Yule, now it was a Christmas tree) was not flamboyantly gay with rainbow paint, which would be a shame if Harry hadn’t been so fascinated by its flickering lights. He was trying to appear collected like any adult would, but Draco knew that look. Draco had seen the wonder on his face each year when Hogwarts was decorated for Christmas, and it had been something he would’ve expected from a small child, not from a teenager.
“See anything?”
“All of you!”
“Of course not. Theo looks down on any establishment deprived of pool tables. They’re at the Old Batty Bat.”
“My recovery happened so fast that the corpse was still warm when I realised I’d been manipulated. Rowena confirmed that most of the students were free of this influence, but some of the youngest had died—Helga had figured out who was responsible and took offence.

Prompt for this chapter:
” had an honourable spot on the back garden door. It was weird, and bloody cute, and Harry lived for it. On the rare occasions Harry left a reminder to himself, it was so cryptic he got mad afterwards for being unable to remember what it referred to. Even if it was a recipe. Luckily, he knew his duck recipe well, because it was Draco’s favourite.
Potter barked a laugh, and Draco smiled. Scarhead was unfairly handsome when he was happy.
cold!” Draco whined.
Harry chews on his lower lip. Where is his biting retort? He’ll probably wake in the middle of the night with a glorious comeback in mind, but his head is currently blank. “So, um, what are you doing?”
He didn’t want to discuss what he’d learned while Scorpius could hear him and intended to wait until he was asleep. Malfoy nodded, read the parchment, stared at both signatures at the bottom and at the Ministry seal, and finally relaxed again. A few seconds later, the parchment was tucked into a warded box where Harry kept his most precious documents and the men set the table together.
“I’ll bring you flowers every year.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t see what’s so funny.”
Prompt for this chapter:
It was so quiet. No wind, no animals, just the sound of their steps. The night was clear, the stars breathtaking, away from any artificial source of light. Harry tried to recognise a few constellations, though he’d never paid much attention in Astronomy. He didn’t know why Draco wanted to be there tonight, but he loved every second of it. “Thanks for bringing me here,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “It’s lovely.”
“I have a vested interest in this whole story,” Cho eventually said, her dark eyes boring into Harry’s. “I knew about the children’s relocation program—who doesn’t? But they made it sound like social services, with wholly unsuitable parents getting their kid taken away.”
“Perfect! Lav, next year, you’re the one handling Mrs Edgecombe. She can’t believe we’re closed next week, and I’ll lose my mind if you make me have this conversation with her again.”
Draco snorted at the sight of his son’s feather crown. The giggling boy was playing in the grass with Fawkes, who kept placing loose feathers and twigs in his hair. Scratching behind Thor’s ears, he wondered why he couldn’t sit still.
Those giant eyes stared up at him in wonder. “All mine?”
“Fuck.” He turned around to grab his scarf but realised it was Potter’s, and worse, it was his school scarf. He didn’t need to see Ginny to picture the shit-eating grin she’d be sporting.
“I kept some of them. You were so talented.”
Harry stilled and held his breath.
“I’m thinking about it.” Harry once hoped to commemorate Sirius this way, and he forgot about it when he lost interest in everything he enjoyed or wanted in life. Now, Malfoy’s question is bringing him ideas. What if he doesn’t go small? What if he covers his scars with art? Mind whirring, he finds himself asking for advice.
“No no no no no... please let me out, please let me go!” He looked around and gasped as if he couldn’t breathe.
“How’s Potter?” Draco asked the portrait when that question started to overwhelm his thoughts.
Deciding to investigate, the black-haired man joined him in the kitchen, casting glances around. He spotted apple compote in a bowl. “Thank you. I’m sorry, I didn’t tell you when I’d be back.”
“Harry, I’m allowed to drink water once in a while.” She bit her lower lip but couldn’t prevent the spread of a smile, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
At least the Wizarding World and mobile phones weren’t compatible yet. The thought of his friends getting a hold of social media and sharing Draco’s antics for all the world to see terrified him. Most of them had no idea Internet even existed. Still, if they kept rejecting their old ways and dated Muggleborns, or chose to follow Draco’s footsteps and study in University, there’d be no haven for him anymore. Not that Draco was an expert in technology, but he
“So. Moving out. Still up for it?”
Harry wasn’t much for casual dating anymore, truth be told. He’d done enough of that, so Draco’s preferences suited him just fine. He thought about the best way to woo him—he could ask Parkinson. Ona and Cassius only knew Draco because they’d shared a common room (and a Quidditch team), but Parkinson was privy to his deepest secrets. The only problem was that Parkinson and Harry loathed each other. Nott would know, too, but that would be awkward, even if he was happily married to Padma, who’d given him two children. Ron would laugh, and Hermione would suggest a romantic dinner, which wouldn’t work because Draco was too particular, and what if Harry chose a restaurant that wasn’t good enough for him?
“If those things can detect magic, I should get one as a pet,” Harry said lightly, guiding the creepy creature away with a spell.
Why were Harry’s cheeks burning? He clenched his fist. “I don’t have my wand.”
Unlike the child’s room, this one was bare. It was very small: the double bed took most of its width and the ceiling dipped on both sides. He had a large window above the bed, which made him smile as it meant he could see the sky at night. At the foot of the bed, there was enough space for a cupboard. Two shelves were screwed into the wall. It would be too small if he had to live in there all the time, but for a bedroom, it would do, and to be completely honest, Draco thought it was a beautiful place, with the wooden beams of the roof visible and the whiteness of it all. Only the shelves were made of the same wood as the beams. The bed looked very comfortable.
Shaking his head, Harry took a step forward, then halted and turned around. “You go ahead.”
Malfoy limped ahead, and Harry grabbed his arm before he could help it. Grey eyes blinked slowly.
Draco wrinkles his nose. May the lost cucumber at the back of the fridge rest in peace. Harry never forgets food anywhere, because he never had enough to eat at the Dursleys, but Draco? If Harry didn’t check his fridge from time to time, it’d be a mess. There are two reasons for it: one, Draco lacks some essential life-skills from his pampered childhood, though he’s had to learn a few the hard way in recent years. He buys vegetables because he thinks his belly is too soft and then forgets about them. Two, Draco is used to magical cupboards that keep food in stasis. They’re still trying to figure out how to mix magic and technology, and so far they’ve succeeded unless their spells touch an item that requires electricity. They have plans to replace most of the Muggle appliances with magical ones, but Draco is weirdly hesitant about it. Harry offered to take on the burden, thinking it had to do with Draco’s money hoarding, but Draco threatened to Transfigure him into a turnip.
Malfoy interrupted the snooping by catching him in the act. It resulted in a bargain, followed by an agreement, and now Harry worked for his childhood nemesis and fetched him ice cream every week. And kissed him. Quite a lot. How the tables had turned.
Harry shook his head and kept reading.
Draco’s hands travelled down Harry’s back, dipping below the waistband of his jeans; when he felt Harry fingers around his cock, Draco moaned and arched his back, tightening his hold on the soft flesh of Harry’s arse, the tip of his middle finger teasing Harry enough to make each of his strokes shaky. Biting and sucking on Potter’s neck, Draco sneaked one hand between them to release his partner’s cock and pressed it against his, his palm joining Potter’s in a frantic rhythm.
As the endless procession of entities carried on past the horizon, Harry recognised leeches, following along by flopping on the path, and parasitic caterpillars flying above the crowd. His eyes spotted a small distortion on the side, and a group of leeches abandoned their lanterns, slipping into the human world.
“There was snow in those mountains.”
“Green is great, look!” Teddy’s hair now mirrors Harry’s eyes.
And in this whirlwind of activity and mind-numbing research, he still found the time to miss Potter.
“What?”
Shrugging, Draco follows him to the car. It’ll be a cold day in Hell when he learns to drive, but Harry is enjoying having his license.
Draco sits up, reaches into the bag Harry hadn’t seen him carry, and hands him a can of cider. Wizards don’t use cans; Harry is fascinated by the idea of Draco going shopping at Tesco. He sits cross-legged, takes a sip and decides he has a new favourite brand.
“Got the plans you asked for.”
“Shut up, Pans!”
“No!”
By sundown, she’d caught him up on current society gossip, including the latest scandal involving Millicent Bulstrode and Susan Bones’ first appearance as a couple at a Ministry event, and Gin Weasley making headlines as the first known non-binary celebrity in their world. Mother seemed quite confused at the news, so Draco promised to explain what he could as they walked out of the sunroom.
The bird chirped and vanished in a ball of flames, taking the child away.
Draco grinned and pressed his lips against Harry’s.
The kiss at the Christmas market. Sharing cotton candy, then another kiss, a soft, quick one, that felt like they’d always been doing that, like it was normal and right and why the fuck hadn’t they done it earlier? Harry’s weight as they leaned on each other, the awkward moment when they came home and didn’t know what to do, Draco taking charge and making hot chocolate then getting distracted and almost burning the house down. A silence that shouldn’t have been so comfortable, in front of a roaring fire, and then more kisses that tasted like chocolate and candy. The smell of Harry’s skin, his fingers that were just on that side of cold, his body pressing down on him. Clothes being in the way, then a tongue in all the right places, a slight tug on his hair, an aching need, blown-out pupils in a sea of green; the feel of a hard cock against his own, a burning ecstasy and all of Draco’s wishes coming true—then again in the shower and again between the satin sheets, and Harry choosing to sleep there with Draco, not going back to his room.
He caught it, and the evil shade grew so fast it got a hold of him. Harry heard Draco call his name, and one of the grinning mouths opened wide, closer, closer, obscuring Harry’s vision—until it crashed down on him like a wave. He gasped as dread sent ice down his spine. His mouth filled with a tasteless liquid, he was drowning, Draco would see him die, he’d never get over it, fuck —
Harry stood up, stretched his back and rubbed his sore shoulder and hip. He gathered the empty cups, headed to the kitchen and washed them without magic, the pipes groaning in protest. The plumbing of Grimmauld Place was one of the things Harry hadn’t tackled during the Great Renovation of 1999. As he set the cup aside to dry, he felt eyes boring into his neck and turned around, finding his friends in the doorway with wide grins on their faces.
As soon as he was alone in his new room, he hunched over and shuddered violently. He stayed there, staring at the ceiling, until he became restless and decided to personalise his living space. His clothes went into the cupboard, his Muggle pictures of Scorpius on the nightstand and shelves, his son’s artwork on the wall. He grabbed his books and after a short hesitation, decided to face the music, and went back downstairs.
. Scarhead, with his ridiculous hair and otherworldly eyes, was about to enter his bedroom—no, bedchamber, that was how it was called.
cauldron! It was shiny, and Harry wanted one.
“Potter, I thought you were going to give me bad news!” The tension left his body. “What’s Hamleys?”
“Shabby, too,” Susan added. “Not very clean. Cormac’s customers are either people Parvati threw out of here or people who hate Slytherins. They can’t go in, the magic at the door kicks them out.”
From the stone bench by the pool, Harry watched the sun disappear into the nothingness beyond the walls of the property. The baby Puffs rumbled around his feet, sluggish from the heat of the day, and the rustling of leaves in the corner of the cabbage patch betrayed the presence of the Niffler.
“As long as this stays between us, Golden Boy, I want to suck you off.”
Harry thought Jim must have been very unlucky not to have a Jim and Draco of his own to learn potions properly: potions were so much fun! He liked it when they changed colours and bubbled. Sometimes, they made noises that sounded like farts and Harry would laugh hysterically. And Draco had a
“I’m so sorry that my healing mastery isn’t up to par. If you want a scar, ask me again.”
.” Malfoy’s wand showed a depth that didn’t scare Harry in the slightest. “Potty, if you can’t get back out, I’m leaving you here.”
Potter laughed. Draco resolved to make that happen more often.
Draco wasn’t in the bathroom either; Harry took a quick shower and wrapped himself in the fluffy bathrobe Lavender had given him for his birthday, before slipping on a pair of clean pyjamas and calling Kreacher.
Draco had so many questions. He settled for observing his surroundings and being a good Slytherin. It would be easier to ask the Weaselette or Potter, but his brain had turned to mush, and he didn’t feel like it. His emotions, the exhaustion of staying awake during the day after a restless night… he couldn’t put his feelings into words and speaking to his personal saviour could result in an embarrassing display of weakness - because sometimes, when he was so out of it that the only thing keeping him awake was the fact that he could only sleep if he was laying down, he blurted out truths he would rather hide forever. Pansy and Theo had sometimes taken advantage of this at Hogwarts, because they thought it was hilarious (it was not!). Thankfully, they never did it outside the dungeons. Talking to a tired Draco was like playing Truth or Dare with Veritaserum.
decorations around London. Similar frames dotted the other walls, each depicting a scene in a famous location around the city, and each fully decked out for Christmas. After looking at each of them and not understanding why this place was so over the top for the holidays, Harry glanced at the empty seat by his side. “Where’s Ron?”
Without sparing a thought for the other, still unknown being that would spot him, Harry quickly revealed his presence.
Harry pushed himself away from his shelter and approached him. “Letting you take the curse in the face if something happens?”
Harry’s incandescent happiness at the Burrow yesterday had contaminated Draco, who hadn’t been able to keep his eyes off him. Harry had explained about the strange clock on the wall, about the gnomes in the garden and the ghoul in the attic, with so much fondness, so much love… and now they were back here, in a home where Harry’s godfather had been miserable his entire life, where he’d been kept captive to avoid being caught by the Ministry—a dark and depressing house, no matter how much work Harry had done on it.
or any kind of light. Then, he petted Noodle, who was sleeping around his neck and sat on the ground. Draco had already removed his shoes.
“Not if we put it under a Fidelius.”
“What the fuck are you trying to do?” he spat.
“I do.” A new cigarette is lit.
“To them, I’m a traitor. This is larger than just Smith and his cronies, Harry. There’s something rotten that was allowed to fester in the chaos after the war. The public endorsed these despicable actions—and I’m sorry to say, but Hermione made her feelings quite clear when you freaked out, and the
Around midnight, when Teddy was asleep, and Mother went home to her grumpy husband, Draco asked Harry if he wanted to continue the celebrations. That was how they ended up drunk in Draco's living room, playing Exploding Snap and arguing about the colour of the murder birds from Addis Ababa.
“Merlin, that was embarrassing,” Gabriel groaned. “I am sorry. Can I help you choose something?”
“You don’t believe in blood purity or hate Muggles?”
He left Diagon Alley and its early evening crowd and entered the much quieter Horizont Alley, which was less about shopping and more about eating and having a good time. Well, his favourite bookshop was there, too, and he only liked it because they didn’t treat him like royalty, but to be fair the shop could use some cleaning charms. He glanced in the window when he passed by, noting the lack of decorations and wondering if he should move H.E.A.L.E.R. to this street. He’d have to research it first; perhaps the local business owners had another association breathing down their neck. Did Knockturn Alley have one? Requiring each shop to be as dusty and sinister as possible? Creevey and his goonies weren’t that bad, though. They’d accepted his stance against Boy-Who-Lived-related Halloween decorations without any fuss, at least.
Harry had never been good at feelings, or at approaching someone he liked. Every fibre of his being screamed that it was now or never, and his brain was in full Gryffindor mode when he said, “Why have  you stopped?”
The black-haired girl sneered. “Can you leave? We don’t need your sort here.”
Smoke clouded Draco’s head. Harry sat quietly until Draco had seen enough. A puff of smoke reached the ceiling, and he turned to Harry. “That lantern. It should allow us to follow that thing on the other side and figure out how it keeps slipping into our world.” He retrieved the memory and gave it back to Harry. “It’s too powerful, it shouldn’t get through. We need to do it now because it’ll keep finding you. I don’t think it can cause you harm through a vision, but you still don’t want it to have access to you.”
Names swirl in his mind and he’s stuck in a loop, reliving the memory of his sacrifice, his walk into the forest with the spirits keeping him company, and that choice he had to make. He’s still not sure no one else could have killed Voldemort at that point, and he’s quickly getting back to his darker moments, wondering if he’d make the same choice if it was offered to him today.
“Magic’s generous gift. My recently acquired belongings. Otherwise known as, why did I get rid of so many clothes when my vault is frozen until 2010?” Draco kicked an empty box of fish bait and crossed his arms on his chest, only relaxing when Potter’s Warming Charm hit him. He tilted his head with a question in his eyes.
“Ineffective?! Not everyone who got caught had a wand or enough training to cast spells on the flames and escape,” Malfoy spat, narrowing his eyes. “And you know it’s still happening in other countries today!”
Draco hesitated, but his cock won. He grabbed his wand, cast the spell on his mouth and on Harry’s, and flipped Harry over, pressing his pelvis against the very hard, very noticeable bulge in his pants. “You have good ideas, sometimes.”
He didn’t know, but he nodded. His throat was tight. He was going to meet his Godfather, Sirius. Until last week, he didn’t even know he had one! Jim had been very stressed but hadn’t told him why, except that Sirius was in prison because of Peter, the one who had betrayed Harry’s parents.
“Shut up and write your letter,” Draco drawled, before tugging Harry towards the stairs. “Don’t come upstairs, we’re busy.”
Harry figured he might as well respond to Hermione’s latest letter, and he did, happy to use a pen to do so.
He let Harry drag him into the kitchen, bitten nails scratchy against the sensitive skin of Draco’s wrist. The fridge was thrown open, Harry bent down to look at its shelves, and Draco couldn’t resist pinching his arse cheek. Harry didn’t even react, the git. Maybe Draco did this too often. He blamed that delicious, muscled backside for his occasional slips into childish pestering.
Harry looked at the drawing and frowned. “You know, that means his room will be in our basement. That’s creepy.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the number of decorations and lights marking the entrance of the Drunk Thestral Inn; they made up for the bare establishments of Horizont Alley, for sure. If this were a Muggle pub, the electricity bill would be outrageous. They even had a life-sized Santa climbing up and down the wall.
“I want to learn all of it. Curse-Breaking, Parselmagic, my heritage, everything.” He blinked, then turned to face Draco. “What—what about the Malfoys? Can I learn that, too?”
By the time they met up, about twenty minutes later, Harry’s clothes were soaked from spending more time on his arse than on his skates. Teddy was irritable because he was tired and cold, but Draco gave him a bag of candy to improve his mood.
“Listen to me, Malfoy. You can still breathe. Come on. Try it.”
Draco had to excuse himself when he opened it and caressed his long-lost hawthorn wand. It wouldn’t do to cry in front of his childhood nemesis.
Harry had shown Draco around after a nerve-wracking introduction, and Draco had promptly been given his very own Weasley jumper depicting a dragon eating a giant parsnip. Molly had cooked a feast, serving Draco three times because he was too thin and making Harry, Ron and Ginny snicker. It was a wonder Draco could still move afterwards. He’d collapsed on a worn couch next to Charlie and hadn’t budged since. He hadn’t talked much either, but he’d watched the kids tear into their presents with a small smile on his face, and he'd let Harry wrap him in an embrace after Harry discovered his gift and was too choked up to speak. The embrace didn't last; after all, Harry knew, from having experienced Molly’s feeding frenzies, that Draco must’ve been a bit sick. So he stayed by his side, careful not to move him, listening to Gabriel’s stories. Victoire and baby Dominique, Bill and Fleur’s daughters, hung onto his every word.
The apartment below has a similar layout, but less light, and Harry wonders if he would leave it like this for a friend, or get rid of one of the kitchens to free up some space upstairs and turn both apartments into one.
Harry broke the kiss in shock, and Draco flipped him on his back. Holding Harry’s thighs open, he proceeded to fuck him with long, torturous thrusts. Harry’s toes curled each time he found the right angle, his back arched off the bed and he didn’t know what to do with his hands anymore. So he just gripped the nearest pillow, trying to bring Draco even closer by crossing his ankles behind his back. Draco lost control of his movements; a drawn-out moan and a jerk of his hips, and he pulled out slowly, before falling against Harry’s chest.
Harry grins, and Draco reaches for the glass of juice, drinking half of it before Harry can stop him. “That was mine,” Harry tells him, eyebrows raised.
Draco squints in the orange light of the sunset and holds out his hand. “I’ll take three-quarters of the garden.”
Harry dragged him away from the Furbys because he didn’t want one of those things in his house. Hopefully, by the time Draco got his vault back, he’d forget all about them. “Draco, there’s a really cool Lego statue by the escalator—”
“What else could I do?” He felt more comfortable now. Perhaps his insane luck was still working.
They part reluctantly when their hands begin to reach under their clothes. Harry looks around and takes a step back. “Sorry, it’s just — neighbours.” Muggle-repelling and Secrecy Charms cover the entire property, hiding them from prying eyes, but Harry still feels like everyone can see them.
“Hey,” he says, but his voice doesn’t work. That’s inconvenient.
publishes a picture of his tear-stained face? Mrs Weasley would swoop down on him like a mama bird and never let him leave the Burrow. He contemplates the idea of going home, but he’s not sure he can Apparate yet. He’s still a bit wary of his stomach. So, he stares at the pub, located where Borgin and Burke’s used to be. The facade is decorated with hundreds of fairy lights from a Christmas ornament contest two years ago. Nobody questions why the owner chose to keep them there: it turns the Brewtiful Mandrake into a beacon in an otherwise unwelcoming street. If the sight is supposed to bring some Christmas cheer into Harry’s heart, it’s failing, and not only because it’s early March. He’s so bloody lonely.
When the locket was only a pile of ashes and melted metal, he vanished it and asked Dobby to bring him back home.
“Maybe they can swim!”
She and Ron helped him move here; the Slytherins assisted Draco. What could have been an awkward encounter ended with an inaugural barbecue, and while Harry felt a twinge of unease and dissociation, he bore it. It was new. Parkinson, Zabini, Nott, Greengrass and Goyle didn’t expect anything from him, so it was easier, and Ron and Hermione’s presence brought him some support, until Ron had a few drinks and began flirting (badly) with a supremely uninterested Parkinson. Draco and Hermione’s eyebrows competed for which pair would reach their hairline the fastest, and Harry found common ground with Nott, who recently read
The door closes, and Draco hears Scorpius babbling, an endless stream of words muffled by the walls.
“Maybe. You’re not mad?” Harry ducks as she swats at him.
Smoke swirls above them as Draco drags on a cigarette and releases the smoke. “You’re right, by the way, the band sucks.”
Draco was burning in shame, but he was also ridiculously proud that Potter had kept something from that time. He sniffed and raised his nose in the air in Malfoyesque fashion. “I’m relieved to learn that you knew their value back then.”
Ironic, that it took the Dark Lord coming back to life for him to realise that he didn’t want any of it.
He takes the Floo, lands in the Leaky Cauldron, and flees into Diagon Alley before the patrons can realise who he is. He keeps his head down; he’s done that a lot since the war. The uneven pavement keeps him in a safe headspace. If he looks up, he’ll see the shops, standing tall and proud, rebuilt on the rubble of a tragedy, he’ll see how life goes on for the entire world, and he’ll retreat into his shell. As he passes by Potage’s cauldron shop, he tenses. There’s too many people around. They should be at work, it doesn’t make sense. It’s too late to go back though, it’d look weird if he left. Ron would say no one’s watching anyway, but he’s Harry Potter, everyone is always watching. With his heart in his throat, he slips into Flourish and Blotts and heads to the fiction section behind the small stage where Lockhart declared he’d be Harry’s Defence teacher.
He stood up and turned towards his mother, grinning. She glowed, healthy and happy, and he let the embrace linger a little; he’d missed her. By the time they sat together, another cup of tea awaited them. “How’s the museum?”
“So, I told her, you see, lady, magic has a will of its own, and I had nothing to do with the tree that burst through the bedroom floor!”
“What, did you think I’d say something different?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, and he stared at the dog. “I knew you weren’t sleeping, mutt.”
“Life is about to become a whole lot more complicated,” Harry pointed out, walking up to Draco and feeling a pleasant warmth spreading in his chest at the sight of the Gryffindor scarf around Draco’s neck. “Did you steal this from my closet?” Harry took the end of the scarf and flapped it in Draco’s face. “You’re about to get a taste of the Being Harry Potter experience. Unless you’ve changed your mind.”
“I don’t need a bodyguard.”
“Master wouldn’t dare!”
And suddenly, it made sense, and Draco rolled his eyes and tilted his head. “It’s sappy, isn’t it?”
“Wilce’s?”
distracting. And it became even more so when it latched onto Draco’s cock and proceeded to taste him as if Harry had never put anything so delectable on his tongue, letting him harden between his lips. Draco forgot his empty stomach. He could only focus on the sensations, on the glint in Harry’s gorgeous eyes as he glanced up at him, on the way his hair felt between his fingers. Then Harry let go with a pop, stood up and soaped up his hands to begin washing Draco’s body.
“That reminds me, I have to introduce you to Minitree. You’ll adore it.”
Draco nodded, stiff and fidgety. Harry was relieved to see the owner, Baalu, coming closer and handing them a Portkey. The owner of the inn had been delighted to tell them that the hotel on the Blue Nile banks belonged to his eldest daughter.
“Perhaps we shouldn’t work on pipes at the same time,” Draco proposed, and Harry flicked water drops at him. “What are you doing?” The kitchen was an absolute mess. It wouldn’t surprise him if Harry decided to redecorate with a hammer.
magazine after an accident ended his career with Puddlemere United, would understand. He might even send him a get-well-soon card. He was the quintessential Gryffindor, which suited Draco just fine in these circumstances. All his coworkers were. Draco had no idea what he’d done to warrant being surrounded by Gryffindors all day long, but at least the Weaselette liked him, and Katie Bell had stopped staring at him like he was about to hex everyone she loved.
“I’m sorry?”
“I should hope so. I understand why you love them.”
Teddy applauds him, and Harry mutters about Hermione finding out and setting him on fire, but Draco won that one for sure.
So far, he knew that he wouldn’t touch most vegetables unless they were raw (he loved munching on crispy, fresh bell-peppers), but was fine with potatoes, carrots and pea puree. Squash would be new. He thought it would work.
“That thing looks nothing like a fruit.” Draco squinted at it. “Not even if a cucumber mated with a pineapple. What is wrong with Muggle scientists? Imagine if Scorpius had developed an interest in them when he was younger. The confusion would be traumatic!” He’d chosen not to introduce him to the platypus for this very reason. A sentence caught his eye, and he leaned forward, pushing Harry’s hand away from the page. “What do you mean they have lungs inside their—they breathe through—no.” He crossed his arms on his chest, and Harry snorted. “You’re having me on,” Draco insisted. “You’ve Charmed those books.”
Sirius and Little Harry were thick as thieves. The ex-convict could sometimes appear childish, but Draco’s fears on that side had been settled when he’d heard him convince the child that attempting to become an Animagus before he was at least thirteen was idiotic. Knowing that his adult self could turn into a snake had created a slight obsession that Sirius had successfully dampened, for now.
Harry blinked. “Did I zone out again?” At Draco’s exaggerated nod, he snorted. “Okay. I still agree it’ll do more harm than good to kidnap me—err, Little Harry.”
He placed the locket in the centre of the spiral, where the cup, the ring and the diary had burned. Activating one rune out of three with a drop of his blood created a trap so the soul shard couldn’t attempt to attack or ensnare him. He’d developed this technique with Harry’s help when they’d removed the Horcrux from Little Harry’s scar a week after he came to live with them. Without this trap, Privet Drive would have gone up in flames. It was much easier to have a curse-proof room available, though.
Teddy dips their head and bows, smirking. They’re such a little shit; Draco loves them. Then their Hogwarts trunk nearly crushes a tomato plant, and Draco loves them a little bit less. He still hugs them but mutters about genetics. It delights the teen, though. Any mention that they’re like their mother makes them beam. Not that Draco ever knew Nymphadora, but he’s heard enough about her to paint a good picture.
“Never.” Harry kissed his cheek and headed towards the kitchen, floor plan in hand. “I’ll let you dig if you want a basement for Little Me.”
Dennis waved and directed them to their favourite table in the corner, looking much older than his twenty-seven years, profoundly marked by the war. “Hi, Harry! Hi, Ron!”
Harry grabbed the Death Star. “Ready to pay?”
Harry Vanishes the soot off his clothes just as Hermione appears in the doorway, attempting to wrestle her hair into submission. She blinks owlishly.
Harry started laughing, a child with bright blue hair clinging to his waist, and Draco’s smirk turned into a relieved smile when he looked around.
They head outside and Harry fills a small inflatable pool with lukewarm water. Teddy is so excited he jumps into the water before Harry can put him in his swim trunks. Loki, like all self-respecting birds, notices the pool from wherever he was hiding, and decides to join the kid and play. Teddy squeals, delighted, and talks about his Kneazle’s love of water, which baffles Harry. His only experience with Kneazles is Crookshank, and Crookshank attempted to maul Ron’s face when he spilled a glass of water.
Malfoy’s presence could already be seen here and there after the first night. A nice black coat and a Slytherin scarf had joined Harry’s parka on the mantelpiece, a pair of sneakers, sturdy boots and elegant but cheap shoes had been placed under it. Scorpius’ shoes looked tiny and adorable next to them. In the kitchen, Harry found toddler tableware and a mug with the hostel logo printed on it. The bookshelves now had a dedicated space for Draco’s books. He didn’t have too many of them, having been unable to retrieve any from the Manor, but he did have his Seventh-Year course material and fifteen Muggle novels. Children’s books had been added to the shelves in his son’s room.
.” He squinted and readjusted his glasses, coughing as puffs of dust swirled around him. All was quiet now.
It was late, judging by the yawn the other boy attempted to stifle, and Harry was already in bed, wearing that undershirt that made him look a bit ridiculous. He and Malfoy were now sharing a bedchamber.
“What the fuck are you wearing?”
Muttering a reply, Draco fished a bottle of water out of his bag and drank a few large gulps, almost choking when his eyes met Salazar's. The Founder was grinning like a loon. They'd forgotten to put him back into the bag and he'd probably seen Draco drooling on Potter's shoulder all night long. Ugh.

“So, wards,” Draco repeated, an idea forming in his head. “Temporary?”
Harry put the probe in his pocket, bent down, grabbed a fistful of snow and let it fall back to the ground. “I’ll accept it.” He was wearing a grey hat, and Draco loved it, it made him look cuddlier, and it kept his hair away from his face. Harry had such attractive features. Even the scar, with everything it meant, had a certain beauty to it, even if it covered half of his forehead and went down his temple like the odd marks left on someone who’d been struck by lightning. Harry then tilted his head and asked, “Any idea how to make that ice statue?”
Once they realised he could see them, they started watching him too. And that was how Harry James Potter, age twenty-three at the time, found himself on indefinite leave from the Aurors, and back on the front page of the
Draco made a mental note not to buy any, and to prevent Potter from doing so because he had no wish to cause a house-elf meltdown. He finished his meal and walked over to the sink, but unlike Potter, he didn’t use a sponge to clean his plate. Potter had said it relaxed him, once, but Draco didn’t understand why. Washing something by hand—touching wet bits of food… No thanks. Maybe it wasn’t about the action, but about the repetitive movement. Or maybe Potter just forgot he had magic. It happened quite a bit with people who hadn’t grown up around it.
He chose a wooden pendant that looked like delicate branches twisting around the stone to cradle it in an embrace. As the shopkeeper wrapped it in a protective fabric, he bit his lower lip, and breathed out, "What stone would you choose for someone with a holly and phoenix feather wand, who won the allegiance of another wand made of elder and thestral hair?"
Instead of hitting Malfoy, the spell threw him violently against the sink, breaking the porcelain before an explosion of light made Harry’s grip on his wand falter. The rumble that followed, echoing through the stone walls, startled him badly. Blinded and deafened, he lost his balance as the floor undulated under his feet, and the tiles shattered into dust.
A warm kiss on his cheek brings him back to reality, where he finds Harry looking at him in a way that is reminiscent of a patient parent. “Earth to Draco.”
Silence settles, and it’s comfortable when it shouldn’t be. Potter is reading what appears to be a Muggle novel. Draco struggles to focus on his work; it’s the first time they exchange more than a word or two in a friendly manner, after all. Potter has been decent with him, but until now there was no sign that they could interact beyond basic greetings. To tell the truth, Draco is immensely curious. So many rumours about him have been proven false, what else is he mistaken about?
“I wasn’t ready, you know.” He messes with his hair again, which really doesn’t need any help in Draco’s opinion. “Gin understood that. She never pushed.”
brains. But Draco was smarter than them and didn’t let her speak, already figuring it out. “Oh. It’s the same object, even if it’s in pieces. The same spell ties the pieces together.” This time, he managed to take the book away from Hermione’s grasp and settled comfortably, one finger tapping his pink lips attractively. “Whoever invented that thing had no idea how Arithmancy works. If we follow their reasoning, we need a three for the full thing, but remove or add one for each piece—five or four, depending on the magic’s stability—that has nothing to do with Arithmancy, were they
Tempting as it was to get one for himself, he admitted it'd be a present, which prompted the man to ask about her wand core and her ability to cast what the Translatall called a guardian. A Patronus, then. Evidently, not everyone used Latin.
He already missed the little urchin, Draco realised with a sharp twinge in his heart.
Draco landed beyond the weave of charms protecting their tent. “Potter, I’ll strangle you in your sleep.”
“Can I use it?”
Ona peered into the office from the backroom. “Is he gone?”
“What happened?” He asks, and he tries not to laugh, because Albert will know, and it will find Draco and eat him in his sleep. Albert holds grudges.
A screeching albino peacock flew at Draco with only one intent in its creepy red eyes: murder. The young man ducked and stumbled forward on the wet grass, then ran until the bird stopped chasing him. He pushed open the door of his childhood home and closed it after one last glare at his attacker. A twig hung in his hair. He untangled his blond strands and flicked the twig away, thanking Merlin and Morgana that Potter hadn’t witnessed his ridiculous escape. He’d seen enough of them.
It made Harry gleeful: Padfoot liked shiny things too, that was one more thing they had in common.
Draco was beautiful. Was it okay to say that about a boy? Harry didn’t know, but he couldn’t believe his future self was married to him. He was so lucky! Would he end up marrying the young version of Draco when he grew up? Would they be friends?
As they walked back, Harry listened to Amanuel’s stories about the Afar people, but he kept looking at Draco. He might have a heat stroke, but it was more likely that he’d found the Compass and didn’t want to linger. What if the guards saw it?
Harry, on the other hand, had been quieter than usual since then. Draco should have known he’d been thinking about the possibilities arising from his position much earlier.
Hogwarts students are flying on the Quidditch pitch, talking with their families, or playing Exploding Snap on the shore of the Black Lake. Professor Sprout is proudly showing the various flower arrangements at the foot of the monument to the fallen, the choir is singing, parents brought their young children and they’re running around, playing, laughing. Did he land in an alternate dimension? Over the past three years, this anniversary went from a solemn event to a festival, and Harry isn’t sure what to think about it. It’s a bit like hearing about the pure joy spreading in the wizarding world in 1981; it’s odd. But just because Harry feels that way doesn’t mean it’s wrong. When she spots his frown, Hermione says it’s about honouring the dead and their memory.
“Take me where?”
“S—so I’ll live here? Always?”
He admitted, without sugarcoating it, that their travels so far had surpassed his expectations, and that his ridiculous crush on his friend had now gone beyond reason (Merlin, referring to Potter as a friend was odd). In a way, he was glad they’d found the Mind Compass; it’d force them to keep wandering the Earth side by side for a while.
According to Hermione, misery loves company. Harry wishes that were true. His friends mean well; they just don’t understand him. It’s okay; Harry doesn’t understand them either. Actually, that’s bullshit. It’s not okay. If it were, Harry wouldn’t be sniffling, alone in the dark, sitting in the new and (slightly) improved Knockturn Alley.
Draco knows Teddy’s presence won’t help Scorpius one bit; Scorpius will want to show off. But it’s one more person who can help if Scorpius ends up on the ceiling again. He sighs and levitates the trunk into the house, Teddy skipping behind him.
Amused, he watched the employee prepare a gooey mess. At the other till, a young teen with a lip ring and heavy make-up stared at Harry in disgust before ordering a coffee (“make it dark, like my soul!”) and sneering in an attempt to appear intimidating. Harry bit his lower lip so he wouldn’t laugh.
He receives an unholy amount of hate mail until McGonagall readjusts the wards to block post coming from within the school. Threats are whispered in the corridors, and he’s hexed by jealous fans who team up with those who want him dead for the mark he bears.
“Mum, you’ve framed it.”
No one knows what Harry’s drinking. His glass is opaque; it stops the teasing. It’s not that his friends would force him, but Harry doesn’t usually shy away from alcohol, and they would question the change. He doesn’t want to explain that if he drinks tonight, he’ll never stop. Hell, he doesn’t even like sparkling water. It’s not his fault the barman almost had an aneurysm and refused to give him plain, still water.
He won’t last long.
Draco had taught Harry’s classes, likely traumatising seven years worth of students by talking to them about what being raised worshipping the Dark Arts meant. Some of them might even sleep with the lights on for a while. At least, they’d be motivated to learn how to defend themselves. He’d taught his classes, adjusting the schedule of his NEWT students as much as possible and letting the best of them take over his first and second-year lessons. He’d dodged questions from his colleagues, obtained the soothing sap of Longbottom’s favourite plant to use as a massage oil, and had to swear to the Headmistress that he would not use Potter’s limbs as potion ingredients.
Harry glared at his hands. “I hate this. I’m going to bed.” He stood up, shook his shoulders to dislodge the blanket, and stomped towards the bathroom, closing it with his foot. A muffled “Fuck!” could be heard through the wooden door.
“Cannons match Sunday?” Ron yells from his spot on the other end of the table. He’s stuck between a very drunk Dean and Pansy, who is flirting openly with Ginny.
“Stand aside, then. Blasting curse?”
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat. “You—what?” He must have misheard. Draco wouldn’t commit to such a permanent bond yet. Right?
Draco looked at him, helpless, in the oddest state of mind he’d ever been in. His head was blank, yet he was aware of a myriad of muted emotions threatening to burst out of him. It shouldn’t have happened this way! Scarhead should’ve asked him during a romantic walk on the beach, with an expensive ring and mind-blowing sex. Not here in Draco’s living room after some nonsensical research and a handjob. But the orchids were beautiful, and Harry had brought so much material so that Draco could tell Scorpius about sea cucumbers, just because he cared... They did have their romantic dinner under the stars, and the beach was right on Draco’s doorstep, and they’d laughed so much—Merlin, it was such a Gryffindor move. And Draco heard himself respond before he could even realise it. “Yes, I’ll marry you, you nutter.” He took a few steps forward and kissed him, then smiled, melting at the pure joy in Harry’s eyes. As Harry opened his mouth to talk, Draco pressed his fingers on his lips. “On one condition: you tell Scorpius about those butt lungs fiends.”
“I like your hair, Potty, and I’ll Obliviate you as soon as we get back to Hogwarts.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He’d found a Christmas jumper in the warden’s cupboard. It was bright red with two male reindeers in the process of
Draco readjusted the strap of his bag. “What?”
Harry looks down and nervously rubs the back of his neck. “It’s mass-produced. It’s just its name. I was looking for something for my godson. I just- when I saw it, I couldn’t resist.”
With that in mind, he’d reached out to Mother, claiming to wish to meet his long lost family. Just as he’d thought, she hid their correspondence from Father. After finally agreeing to see him and testing him with a vow, she was seemingly satisfied. Draco swore he was part of the Black family. Mother always knew more than she let on and might already have guessed who he was because she agreed to let him see Little Draco.
"Fine." Running a hand through his hair, Potter frowned, deep in thoughts, then smiled. "I'm in the mood for pizza."
“But McGonagall-”
“If you say so.”
Harry grinned. “Blame Ron. Git.” He let go of him and turned towards the Aurors. “Do you still need me?”
“Hm?”
Harry leaves his chair (it was indeed leaning back a bit too far), and wards the cake before critters decide to have a taste. Draco is heading towards the oak tree, waving his wand in a complicated pattern which creates dozens of small lights that find refuge in the thick branches. He waits for Harry, who joins him with anticipation in each of his steps. Draco’s palm presses against Harry’s hip, and Harry refuses to wait any longer.
“So, tattoos,” Harry announces as he joins Malfoy in the back garden later. It’s getting late and Teddy is fast asleep, exhausted from the food and the fact that he’s been so active all evening. Malfoy is smoking, leaning against the back of the house. Loki is nowhere in sight.
Then he saw Draco, and the world stood still. He was tiny and had a weird haircut, and his nose was very pointy. Draco’s expression was a mixture of horror and interest, and he was trying to flatten himself against the wall because the girl would not stop leaning over him to look at the book he was holding. Fortunately, he didn’t have to tell her anything, because a girl with short black hair pushed her away from him.
George said Malfoy was a glorified fortune-teller who was always high on Gillyweed. Harry knew better. First, Draco didn’t smoke Gillyweed, he wasn’t stupid. He smoked a blend of dried shrivelfig and Mandrake root, which had no effect on him aside from keeping his Sight clear. Perhaps Trelawney should have tried that instead of choking her students with incense.
Time slows, but ultimately, he decides he can’t stay. The
“Still not showing them.”
He slapped a hand against his neck.
“Teddy Teddy Teddy!” Scorpius yells, bouncing in Harry’s arms. Harry groans and lets him go, and the four-year-old grabs his cousin’s wrist and drags them into his room. “Come and play!”
He strolled, the sheer size of the place stealing his breath away. The vaulted ceiling was high and wide, so the room didn’t feel too cramped. He went around the mead barrels and joined Malfoy in front of yet another door. This one shared many similarities with the Great Hall’s, but the metal bounds weren’t iron and were shaped like snakes.
“Why are you all loitering here, close the door, you’re letting the cold in.” Andromeda embraced Draco, who noticed the softness of her thick burgundy jumper and decided he needed one. She seemed a bit younger than when he’d last seen her, and he realised she had hidden her greying hair under a black dye. Grief had taken such a toll on her; she still looked much older than her actual age. “It’s so good to see you, Draco.”
The front of the house is unremarkable. It’s a two-stories property made of grey stones without any trapping, but it’s detached, and it doesn’t look like Privet Drive. There are two doors, which strikes Harry as odd.
The gleam in Hermione’s eyes makes him groan, as she seems to read his mind. “Are you afraid of Ron?”
“It won’t multiply?” Harry asked, and it was a valid question, as was the one that was now running through Draco’s mind (
Wide grey eyes stared at him. “Potter, this is—that’s History!”
He learned a few things tonight. Mainly, that Neville isn’t fond of big gatherings either, that George drinks too much, and that Ron isn’t as obtuse as it seems. It’s thanks to him that Harry could leave without attracting curious or disappointed looks. Despite Harry’s fucked-up brain telling him he doesn’t matter to them, tonight proved how skewed his perception of things is: Molly’s thoughtfulness, Ron’s gift (a weighted blanket), Katie’s lingering hug, Ginny’s subtle changes of topic when they hit too close to home… He’s so bloody lucky to have them. Perhaps they’re not seeing what he wants them to see — but perhaps he’s the one who was blinded by his declining mental health.
He’d almost forgotten he wasn’t alone anymore. It was 6pm when he closed the door behind him and noticed that Scorpius was busy drawing. A glance to the side showed Malfoy, dishevelled but smiling, wearing Harry’s apron and looking- well, Harry’s lower regions liked what he was seeing. The flutter in his stomach was quite unexpected, but impossible to avoid, not when those grey eyes shone so brightly. He’d never seen Malfoy like this before. Teenage Harry would have been mortified. The adult, not so much.
Harry, who was drinking his juice, almost chokes, and begins coughing his lungs out. He doesn’t hear Draco’s answer, but when he catches his breath, Draco is watching him with a playful smile and his cheeks are pink.
He goes to the bathroom first, cleans his teeth and drinks some water, then comes back and sits on the floor and quietly unwraps the first one. It’s a book on Aztec Magic from Pansy, who finished her schooling in Ilvermorny with Theo (who signed the card with a drawing of an owl. Good to see he’s still inspired and getting better. Draco believes he’ll succeed in his dream to become a magical illustrator). Draco’s friends fled the country in fear of retaliation after one too many threatening letters, despite not being Marked.
Turning the book slightly, he gestured at the picture of a rather phallic creature. “Look at it!”
He expects something like a scarecrow dressed like Harry, or Mother’s dogs acting silly, but no, what he sees leaves him speechless. It’s a peacock—well, it’s Albert, the oldest and meanest of them all—but it looks like a giant pincushion with a long tail and a neck. The bird is acting like nothing is amiss, pecking at Mother’s hydrangeas, but it has more than two legs. They’re all around its body, sticking out like stiff, thin arms, clawing at nothing—if the peacock were to attempt to roll down a hill, it wouldn’t roll at all, it would just walk.
Chuckling, Harry casts
Harry gives him a gentle smile, and the sunlight shines behind him like a shroud. “Hey, love. I miss you.”
“Love you too, Golden Boy.”
Draco exhaled in mock outrage, a hand pressed on his breastbone. “How dare you!” He wiped the triumphant grin from Harry’s face with a quick kiss. “Cast your Patronus.”
“Wait here, I need to travel back in time and tell myself that Harry fucking Potter wants to adopt my son to keep both of us safe.” He almost dropped his Butterbeer in an attempt to put it back on the table. “Fuck, that’s not a fitting drink for this conversation.”
“Everyone deals with trauma differently. Your friends may be lucky, free to enjoy their lives, and I would wish that for them, but perhaps it’s their own way to heal. I don’t know them. But I get it,” Malfoy adds with an unsettling intensity in his eyes. “It’s very lonely.”
The clock on the wall isn’t functional; Harry notices after staring at it for five minutes, wondering why time stopped. He’s holding a veggie skewer, the tomato at the tip sliding towards its impending fall. He’s hungry, but his stomach is in knots and he can’t bear the thought of eating anything. Tearing his gaze away from the unmoving clock, he drops the skewer onto the tiny metallic plate in front of him and takes a sip of sparkling water. It soothes his parched throat, but there is a bead of sweat running down his spine, and as soon as the water is gone from his tongue, he’s thirsty again. There’s a buzzing in his ears from the noise around him and he wants it gone. A live band at the back of the Brewtiful Mandrake pub is playing songs that all sound the same, it’s driving him mental. Booming laughs keep startling him, a glass shattering makes him bite his tongue. He’s stuffed into the corner of a booth with backrests high enough to enclose him and his friends, and they’re all crowding around the small table. Ron and Dean keep pushing him around every time someone sits down and forces them to scoot closer to Harry. Parvati’s perfume smells like caramel and chocolate and honey, it’s so sickeningly sweet, Harry hates it.
“It’s good to see you too, Blaise,” he offered in return, getting comfortable. Taking a moment to observe his year mates, he noticed the dark circles under Greg’s eyes, Millicent’s adoring gaze that wouldn’t leave Susan (currently chatting at the bar), and the blue paint on the side of Blaise’s right hand. These small details indicated normalcy he’d gotten used to: Greg’s exhaustion came from his newborn daughter who possessed an impressive pair of lungs and an aversion to sleeping. Millicent and Susan had opened a bookstore in Brighton and shared the space with Finnigan and Thomas’ coffeeshop. They were successful and rubbed their happiness in Pansy’s face because it amused them. Blaise had a six-year-old—born to none other than Gin Weasley when they were still dating—and Draco rarely saw him without any smudge of paint on his clothes or skin. Out of all of them, Draco sometimes felt like he’d been left behind. Unlike Pansy, who refused to settle down, he was a romantic at heart and wished he could share his life with the same person until his death. It wasn’t his fault if he’d never found anyone who could make him forget Scarhead.
As it was Sunday, they decided to stay in bed. A very productive weekend. They took a break from fooling around after Kreacher brought them food and complained about unseemly behaviour, which made Harry laugh until he spat his drink all over the bed. Thank Merlin for cleaning spells.
quiet, not since the start of the Pygmy Puff mating season. The little buggers loved this place; as Harry reached the heavy front door, a dozen of them squeaked and rumbled, climbing all over each other on the front porch and leaving pastel-coloured hair on Harry’s black jeans. “This isn’t for you,” he said, tapping the ice cream. The squeaks intensified, taking on a distinctly outraged tone. “No. Remember what happened last week?” Rumbles. “The brain freeze?” The Puffs stared at each other with shiny eyes, then cooed and scampered. Harry shook his head and entered the house.
Malfoy stood up. “The Portkey activated—”
“So much for the great hero.” Malfoy’s observations continued while Noodle dozed off around Harry’s neck. He wove layers of Muggle-repelling charms around the area and hit the rock with several detection spells “Alright, Golden Boy, your turn. I have no idea why it’s doing that. It’s just a rock.”
Draco does exactly that. His fingers twist and tug on the hair at the back of Harry’s neck and he rotates his hips, grinding down on Harry’s cock. Harry’s breath hitches. The pressure increases, and it feels bloody amazing, it’s nothing like he expected. Harry is aroused because Draco is doing this to him, not because an imaginary Draco does it to someone else. Harry wants this. With him. Emboldened, he chases after another kiss, and tentatively reaches below the waistline of Draco’s trousers. Draco cants his hips back, inviting him. Harry massages his arse and even dares to run a finger along his crease. His face is on fire, but he likes the shuddering breath he receives in return.
Teddy doesn’t believe him until Harry does it, and he forgets about it when he opens his presents. Luckily, he still thinks Pinecone is the most brilliant present of all, even if he got her early, though the toy dragon is a close second.
“I thought it was mine!”
“Potter, there are bugs in that tree.” Despite the complaint, Draco doesn’t try to push him away, but tugs him closer, until they’re flush against each other.
“Sorry, were you asleep?” Harry’s attempt to sound like he hadn’t gone through a terrifying situation failed as his voice sounded so pitiful. His sleep had been mostly free of nightmares, but when they happened, Draco always cared for him. His expression now was quite unusual, however.
He sat on the ratty couch in his friend’s office. Aurors sometimes slept on the job, so most of the higher ranking ones had a place to rest. The sofa looked like it had seen better days.
, please! I need to protect my soul. Oh, Merlin, you’re bringing him to the Burrow aren’t you?”
would call them boring; but Harry thought they did well, considering their history.
Wait, he was right? He hates how Potter can still surprise him. “I guess even Lockhart needs a break.”
“Let me guess: Granger helped,” Draco said, flipping through the pages and glancing at the colourful pictures of starfish and sea lilies. “Okay, so, invertebrates. Got it. Not sure what I expected.” He found the relevant page and his eyebrows rose. “What the—how do I make these things child-friendly?”
He slowed down to peek into each compartment. Some were open, and others had the blinds shut. He didn’t want to bother people, so he didn’t knock. When he reached the end of the train, he was a bit disheartened and had gained a companion, a girl with hair worse than his, who talked so quickly and so much that she was giving him a headache. He just figured out she was looking for a toad. Having no sense of propriety (like Draco would say), she barged into the next compartment, asking if anyone had seen the wayward animal. Before Harry could apologise on her behalf, he heard her gasp.
“Thanks for not slapping me,” Harry said, slightly out of breath.
Draco’s hand rested on the small of Harry’s back, pressing gently against the soft fabric of his robes. He briefly closed his eyes to appreciate the heat of the sun on his face, knowing it was the last time he’d feel it in this timeline.
Draco turned it off with a flick of his wand. “What happens in a few years? Us being back where we should be?”
Oh, indeed. Harry stares at the spiky handwriting that tries and fails to be elegant.
(Image: people pulling on a party cracker)
The wooden foot of the couch Harry is leaning against is very uncomfortable. “I try to clean the places I’m in the most,” he retorts, and it’s true. Harry’s room is pristine. That’s because it only takes a few waves of his wand; if Harry had to vacuum and mop Grimmauld Place, he’d live in filth.
Adrenaline was still rushing through Harry’s veins. He looked back, finding the distorted portal, but no sinister entity. It must have worked. He couldn’t help it; he laughed and hugged Draco, who returned the embrace instantly.
“Harry! I thought I’d have to drag you here!” Three steps, and she’s hugging the breath out of him. “Oh, I’m so glad to see you!”
“Andi Floo-called,” he said, veering from dangerous topics. “We’re invited to lunch tomorrow.”
“Harry, what if—” Whatever she was about to say, she changes her mind. “Send me a Patronus when you get there.”
“I’m okay,” he breathed, losing himself in those grey eyes.
A quick nod follows, and Harry walks to the small fireplace, grabbing a handful of Floo powder in the process. He looks back at his friend, whose lips are pinched, arms crossed on her chest. “Sorry. I think something’s wrong.”
“It’s more romantic than Grimmauld Place!”
“Yay!”
Did he care? Denying the panic he’d experienced that morning would be useless. He didn’t know anyone who was openly gay. What if he couldn’t find support anywhere? What if Ron and Hermione didn’t accept him? But once the panic went away, he’d felt a sense of peace he’d ever only experienced when Sirius hugged him.
In the end, Harry beats him to it and asks, voice a bit muffled by the Bubblehead charm, “Do you want to use it for potions?”
“Potter, no.”
Then he gave the letter to the cranky owl and focused on decorating more biscuits, even if his worry was growing.
“You cooked us a feast earlier, Andi. I’ve heard Muggles deliver food, why not do this?”
“Gross,” little Harry groaned, and Padfoot barked in agreement.
“I suggest we get those creatures out of the way first.”
“Got a message from the Diagon Alley Storefront Association,” she announced, looking like she’d smelled a Dungbomb.
Oh. So that’s what the smile meant. Harry should’ve known better. Reading Draco’s often ambiguous behaviour hadn’t become any easier in the few months since they’d exchanged letters. However, so far, Harry still thought he knew him well, from years of observation. It didn’t mean he didn’t read his mood wrong, though. Draco wasn’t sweet, or soft, or anything of the sort in the morning. Harry looked at the spot Draco was pointing at and understood instantly, suppressing a full-body shudder at the sight of the giant camel spider that appeared to be obsessed with Draco’s shoes. Dealing with creatures hadn’t been Draco’s strong suit since they’d left England; his charms rarely managed to keep bugs out, and his magic attracted all kinds of strange, many-legged creatures.
“Fuck him,” Theo muttered with a frown.
The chill of the room didn’t last, and soon Draco’s back glistened with sweat. Harry was a bit rougher than he’d been before but paid close attention to Draco’s body language to ensure he enjoyed every moment of this, especially after he came and was so sensitive. Harry had honed his observational skills from years of spying on him, and it was second-nature to be aware of the smallest tension in his shoulders, even as he slid in and out of him. Draco had tried to stay in one position, holding himself up, but he’d abandoned that idea and was now laying on his stomach with one of the blankets muffling his voice. He was so, so beautiful. Harry would never get tired of this.
He’d felt it when Cedric died, when he’d been railroaded at his disciplinary hearing, when Umbridge tortured him, unpunished. Righteous fury. His nervousness vanished, and he straightened his back, just in time for Ron’s return.
Now was not the time to forget where they were. They needed to focus and work together to find a solution. Because they were stuck. In a wine cellar. There was a single torch on the wall, most likely enchanted to burn when someone was near, and its light cast sinister shadows all around them. Malfoy twisted the doorknob and tried to push the door before kicking it with a frown and turning around to face Harry. He jerked his chin at him. “Now would be the perfect time to show off your brilliant magical talent, Potty.”
“I said it first!” Draco whines with a cute pout on his lips.
He stepped into a beautiful bathroom—and honestly, all that mattered was the toilet.
He washed his hands after using it, and the snake looked at him.
“Merlin,” Draco breathed out, and Amanuel grinned, stepping aside to let them through. “What the fuck is this?”
“Aside from listening to your artist? There’s too much to think of. I’ll send you the phone number once I get home. Make an appointment for a consultation; ask for Diego.”
It took him a few minutes to find the appropriate recipe, and he started preparing the ingredients with Barber’s Adagio for Strings filling his ears. He worked efficiently, cutting, splitting, crushing. He had to focus on his movements and timing because he kept thinking that Harry’s wrists must be hurting him, and what if the nincompoop decided to bathe, and
Harry didn’t know why, but he trusted him instantly, and he did not trust adults, ever.
“I did.” Draco tapped his finger on the magazine. “Why do you have a crafts magazine with pictures that don’t even move?”
to! Oh, Merlin—I can’t, I can’t, I can’t!”
The stairs spiralled down for so long that Harry worried about Malfoy’s pain. The Slytherin was shaking. What if the wound got infected? There must be some potions here, hopefully, because Harry wasn’t sure what to do with medieval healing supplies. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves in a long corridor similar to the dungeons, just with more snake statues and carvings. Two doors were already open, and Malfoy shut himself behind the first one. Harry promised himself to check on him in a few minutes and entered his own room, which looked like a museum with several large—but short—beds, lumpy mattresses and pillows, and a scribe desk. A bookshelf with rolled parchments and leather-bound books in the room intrigued him, and he felt slightly like Hermione as he examined them.
Harry pressed soft kisses on his neck, along his jaw, then on his lips, gorgeous green eyes gleaming. “Sirius will get it for us next year. I’m so proud of you.”
Scarhead sounded different in Malfoy’s mouth.
“Yeah, that works. Sweet, please.” He cast a Tempus. Five. Perfect, he still had time before meeting Draco, who would undoubtedly judge his life-choices. After Hermione had left Grimmauld Place, Draco had advised Harry to rest for the next twenty-four hours, not visit Teddy at Hogwarts in the morning and attend a Quidditch match later. Given Harry’s exhaustion despite a good night sleep, he had a point. “I’ll take a portion of fried mushrooms.”
“I’m your git.”
“Sure, Draco.”
Harry agreed with her until he saw more of those things.
“The Time Chamber!” he’d said, grinning. “Draco, we can change everything!”
“Malfoy Manor, Draco dear,” Mother said.
“I don’t know! Where’s yours?”
“I have it. Come up; there’s a car coming.”
The wizarding world was strange. He remembered when Social Services came to the hostel to check on him and Scorpius. Comparing them to the new Ministry deciding to take away his child for a seemingly random reason made him want to send flowers to the Muggle woman who had taken the time to listen to him, to talk to Abel and to the owners of the hostel, and who had deemed him stable enough to take care of his boy.
Harry stops paying attention. Soon, Molly is sitting by his side, a reassuring hand around his wrist.
Tension bled out of Harry’s body like melted butter, though he was still worried. He would have distracted himself by asking his ex-girlfriend how life had been and when the baby was due, but right now, he didn’t care. He smiled at her, quite sure he looked constipated. Ron, more gallant than Harry had ever seen him, let Cho sit in his place and even offered her a sandwich. She accepted gratefully.
He bit his lip to keep from laughing at Harry’s stricken expression, and then he froze at the whisper that followed. “Sorry, could you repeat that?”
A few minutes later, he ate his first dinner with his new housemates, cutting Scorpius’ slice of pork and sharing a smirk with Malfoy as the child gobbled up his vegetables. He then volunteered to clean up.
Also, it reminded him that Potter should have been wearing green and silver, and wasn’t that absurd? He’d have been killed in his sleep.
Draco stood up, surveying their surroundings, observing the shimmer of the wards beyond the picket-fence. He held his wand tightly, his whole body tense, ready to take Scorpius and run. “Fawkes,” he said between gritted teeth, “If you understand me, protect Scorpius.”
The discussions switched to Mother’s presence once more, where she informed Draco of her plan to stay here for the winter. She’d gone to the Manor thinking she’d have to put up with the memories, discovered it was gone and had Apparated to her sister’s house to take up residence in Draco’s old room. Good riddance, she’d said.
His jawline is lovely, Harry thinks, sitting on the threshold after closing the door behind him. Some time passes in complete silence, with Harry peering at the black sky and shivering in the breeze. He ponders Malfoy’s revelation without asking why he didn’t find a magical tattoo shop. He’s pretty sure he’s guessing right. When Malfoy speaks next, Harry feels his eyes on him.
Her smile was positively feral. “Oh, you poor, innocent soul. Draco is attached to Pureblood traditions, but not that much. If you court him that way, he’ll expect you to marry him in a week. No, just don’t start anything if you’re not serious. He was brought up a certain way—he doesn’t do casual. At least I don’t think he does.”
In the Burrow, it’s quiet. Harry sits cross-legged on the worn couch and stares at the pictures on the wall. His mind is blank. He hears Andromeda, Fleur and Molly talking in the background — apparently, Victoire and Teddy are napping, and Andromeda isn’t happy about it, because it’s still very early. Either Teddy won’t sleep when they go home, or he’ll wake her up at 4 tomorrow.
! Draco had felt the sensation of tiny legs running over his limbs for weeks because
Harry glances at Draco, who looks him in the eye, confused.
Under the parchment, Harry had drawn a heart, and written “Yes.”
“Congratulations, Potter, on getting invited to such an exclusive event. You’re now a Malfoy.”
Malfoy takes residence in a corner of Harry’s brain; the memory of his nonchalance sticks with Harry, and he’s not sure why. It doesn’t haunt his every thought, but it’s a distraction. On Monday morning, when Harry receives a list of job openings from Hermione and a pamphlet from the Ministry, it’s that same distraction that prevents him from breaking yet another cup in anger. Instead, he stays calm, and Vanishes those well-intentioned gifts. They’re his weekly annoyance coming through owl post. Kingsley always attempts to convince him that the Ministry would be delighted to have him. Hermione hopes he’ll follow in everyone else’s footsteps, start working, and go back into the world. Today, Dean’s letter is absent. A blessing. Harry isn’t in the mood to read another description of a potential date. Dean, who is surprisingly sappy, wants him to find love, or at least get laid, but he knows better than to set him up with someone — he tried once, and Harry was so furious, he holed himself up in Grimmauld Place for a month.
“Now who’s a sap, Zabini?”
He gets another hideous Weasley jumper, a book from Granger, sweets, and a tiny cactus (he laughs and says he can’t keep plants alive, so Longbottom chose well). He also gets a preserved cucumber from Lovegood. Not a surprise. She believes many vegetables have pest-repelling properties. If said pests exist is another story.
“I was.” Harry shifts, tearing his gaze away from the sky so he can kiss Draco’s chin. He settles back just in time for more trails of light to appear. “I still am. Maybe I could have lasted til the end.”
“If you have books or- well, it’s tiny, so if you don’t want to put all your stuff here, feel free to store them somewhere else. I’ve freed up space where I could.”
is that?”
“Malfoy, I— I don’t mind.” Harry took a deep breath and looked at him. “It was nice.”
Blaise tilts his head in Harry and Draco’s direction. “They’re being sappy.”
Slytherin’s smile turned into a smirk. “Your legendary rival slept late. He was quite worried about you.”
Prompt for this chapter:
Her eyes shone in delight. “Augusta Longbottom approved her part in the familial heritage display.”
“There’s a time for remembrance, and that’s what the memorial service is for,” Hermione adds primly, tightening her light scarf, and Ron gives her a smug look. They still have so much chemistry, even after breaking up (and getting back together four times), and Harry is grateful for the lack of tension.
Draco had grown up hearing tales about the grandeur of that man. He’d seen old pictures of him, tall and striking, with the most attractive bearing, face, and body that made him realise he liked men (how embarrassing, to have a crush on a young Dark Lord). So, Draco went to Hogwarts believing he was worth more than most of his schoolmates, because he bore the Malfoy name—because his father was so trusted by the Dark Lord back then, and so influential in the government. He was important and untouchable—until a scruffy, speccy boy in rags turned down his offer of friendship.
Harry hears Hemione mutter something about the password, but he’s not paying enough attention to understand her exact words. A shiver runs down his spine. The handwriting is too jagged, too uneven. A sense of urgency builds up at his core, and he stands up as Loki flies away through the still-open window. “I have to go.”
Eyebrow raised, Harry twists around to look at him. That’s a surprising answer, since Harry was expecting something along the lines of You’re twenty-one, Potter, and a wizard. You’ll live to the ripe old age of one-fifty. Why would you be in any hurry to marry? and he’d say his friends didn’t get the memo and are all rushing. “You don’t think it’s weird?”
“Yes! Grandma!” Teddy flees on his small legs, reaching the regal-looking woman speaking to Fleur. “Grandma! Harry wants to see my ship!”
Neville took a step forward and aimed his wand at the ground. “
“Astoria Greengrass. We were betrothed as children, and her father was inflexible until I proved inadequate. Astoria is now happily dating a woman, and Mr Greengrass is drowning his sorrow in Firewhiskey.” Another drag on his cigarette. “Your friends are not Seers, Potter. Well, Lovegood might be, but you know what I mean. I’m not saying you need to do it now, but you’re traumatised, and probably depressed, and whatever they’re doing isn’t helping. If they don’t have a clue where to start, how are they supposed to get it right?”
Harry sighs and nods. It’s fine, they’ve been here for two hours, and Harry enjoyed himself. He drinks his mango juice during the first song, as does Draco, then slides off the booth. He positioned his body strategically to avoid feeling trapped. Nobody asks why they’re leaving; nobody makes any kind of remark that could trigger Harry’s guilt.
Someone coughs nearby, and Harry is immediately on alert. He twists his body around, scraping his jeans on the wall, and his breath catches. If there is a god, they must be laughing at him. Sitting about five feet away, a cigarette in his mouth, is the Pointy Prat himself, Draco fucking Malfoy. No, Harry is being unfair. Malfoy has been civil since his trial. Not that Harry is spending any time with him, but if they run into each other, there is no snarky insult exchanged. So, Harry moved Malfoy out of the “Evil Git” category. He’s not quite sure where he should put him now.
Prompt for this chapter:
“I’m sure she is.” And she was, he knew that. She would even let him live his life without bothering him and would expect the same privacy in exchange. They’d talked about it enough. It would solve everything: they’d produce a child, would love them to the moon and back, raise them together, and they’d never have to touch one another again. But the thought of marrying anyone out of a misplaced and obsolete sense of duty had lost its appeal long ago. He could bet that Astoria shared his opinion. He knew her well: she was part of the tight-knit group of Slytherins who still met regularly since the war, most of them from Draco’s year or below—those who had been at Hogwarts during the war and suffered together. “I still don’t intend on getting married, Mother,” he added.
“Afraid you’ll need even uglier glasses? I say, anything would be an improvement.”
“Shut up, Malfoy!”
Mother had told him that a three-year-old Cousin Regulus had made a similar mistake, stealing a jar of pickles while the adults were busy enjoying the “boring part of the holidays” (aka that stretch of time between lunch and dinner). He’d hid in a corner and proceeded to eat every single pickle in one sitting and was miserable for the next twenty-four hours. Following this incident, he’d never been able to even think about eating a pickle.
“Thanks. It hurts to breathe.” He drank and handed it back to Harry. “Either we come back here at night—mirages in the dark aren’t common, so magic should work—or we just try and summon it.” He lowered his voice and flicked his wand arm. He also wore a long-sleeved shirt, enchanted to keep him as comfortable as possible and protecting him from the sun, so no one could see his holster. “
“Have a safe trip back, boys, and I’ll see you both for Yule.”
He pictures him standing by his side. It’s so vivid he can feel the ghost of his hand on the small of his back. He feeds off the sensation, and his mood swing doesn’t impact him as much as it could have. Hermione clings to him, and he focuses on his thoughts because he’s edging towards a meltdown.
When he looks into the mirror, he knows he made the right choice. His tattoo is cathartic. Of course, it’s not a cure for his depression, but he has to admit he hasn’t felt too bad recently. He also credits the potion and his correspondence with Draco for starting some sort of healing process, and for giving him enough courage to agree to see his friends, one week after the Hogwarts fiasco.
“I’m glad he didn’t make a fuss tonight.”
Banishing the notebook, biro, and unfortunate scroll back to where they came from, Draco grunted and sat up more comfortably, having slipped a bit too far down. Harry watched him, lips quirking into a smirk, as he remembered Pansy and Ginny agreeing on their assessment that Draco did nothing all day but lounge on velvet cushions while Harry served his every need. They thought Harry had willingly enslaved himself at first. Now they believed they had an odd relationship and had wild guesses as to the nature of the rewards Harry got for catering to Draco’s whims. Whoever decided it was a good idea for the two women to meet should be ashamed of themselves.
“Carrot cake.” Draco pauses and bites his lower lip. “I think it ate the candle.”
“Jabini ‘ow ’at?”
“These biscuits are excellent.” Hermione dropped onto the sofa after placing the plate on the table.
“Perhaps not.” Malfoy slides off the wall, bringing awareness to the fact that he’s dressed in tight, white jeans. Harry catches himself staring. Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice, too busy squinting at the lights on the Brewtiful Mandrake with his lips curling in offense. “Is the inside also pretending to be a Christmas tree? Because I’d understand your need to get away.”
It should always have been that way. If Draco hadn’t been such an arse, if he’d even dared to chance it—but his father’s disapproval was what he had feared the most, so he’d acted the part.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
“Snakeling, what can I do for you?”
After a long-overdue exchange of brief letters a few months ago, Draco had travelled to Hogwarts, knocked on the door to Harry’s office, ordered him to pack, and they’d left for Turkey. There, Harry swam in the sea for the first time, ate incredible food he’d never even heard of before and enjoyed the luxury of the resort Malfoy had booked. His skin darkened, revealing freckles he must’ve gotten from his mother, and he’d felt free and happy. And if Malfoy’s bursts of laughter and carefree, yet still rare smile were anything to go by, he, too, thought travelling was a brilliant idea. But a resort and spending money weren’t what Draco had studied for, and he’d astonished Harry when he’d been the first to mention it. They’d bought the tent the next day and headed straight for the Taurus Mountains.
Don’t get caught.
“Make me.”
At the bottom, there was a short corridor in which he could easily stand. It was clean, made out of concrete and lacking any spider or other many-legged creature. There was another door there, which he pushed open while the snake
After that, Potter becomes Harry.
Detaching his eyes from Malfoy’s long legs, Harry shakes his head. “I can only take so much bagpipes before going mental, so I’m taking a break.”
If Malfoy had friends, why did they let him fall apart? Why wasn’t anyone with him during the war, in sixth year—where were they, now, when Malfoy was alone against the entirety of Hogwarts? He’d watched him on the map enough to see that he was almost always by himself. Perhaps he’d driven them away.
“Godric and Rowena wished to keep the Compass. Its healing capabilities alone could save so many, yet in the wrong hands, it’d lead to disaster. Imagine what a corrupt monarch or a conqueror could do with it. Helga and I convinced them. We discovered that no magic could permanently destroy it. We even treated it as a Horcrux, to no avail. Even broken into pieces, it still worked, but the pieces had to be close together. We entrusted their fate to Helga and never asked her where she sent them. We swore to keep its existence a secret.”
He wakes again; he’s standing up, and his legs don’t struggle under his weight, so he guesses it’s a good thing, and he looks around. It’s Diagon Alley, but it’s empty and too clean, and the colours are muted. It’s like someone took a picture and reduced the contrasts, but added more light. Draco’s also very short, because he can’t see above Fortescue’s ice-cream counter and that’s just nonsense, isn’t it?
But Harry is sorry. Harry apologises to the Basilisk because it was starving and manipulated and- alright, Draco gets it. It makes sense. If the Basilisk had been a murderous beast all along, Myrtle wouldn’t have been its first victim. The Dark Lord did something to it. Bound it to his will, perhaps.
Draco shakes his head, drops his messenger bag in the grass and rubs Loki’s head. “You have no idea what Diagon Alley was like. Pure madness.” He puts the camera back into the bag.
When they take a holiday to Spain the week after, Harry is more excited than Scorpius and gives an embarrassing display of emotions when the wandmaker shows them his best child-friendly wands. They’re short, made of wood associated with peace, friendship or kindness, and they each contain a stone. Scorpius is chosen by a rowan wand with an Amethyst core. The dampener is woven into the wood and looks like a thread of gold.
Draco blows smoke through the window, and Harry can’t resist anymore. Each step he takes is slower than the previous one. He stands next to him, and the words are no longer stuck in his throat.
Draco’s plan to decorate his land was working quite well; many of his and Harry’s friends had offered their help, so Harry and Draco were Apparating to the Manor each time they had a minute to spare, and if it weren’t for Teddy, they’d have cancelled the entire thing after the first few trips: it was exhausting.
“Master Draco called Kreacher? And Master Harry is back at last.”
Harry has bottled his emotions for years, and if he pictures them as water in a cup, the water is ready to spill over the edge. He wants to talk. Malfoy makes it easy, which is utter nonsense, so Harry takes a deep breath and jumps right into it. He’s still careful; if the water starts spilling, he’ll never stop, and he doesn’t want to bawl his eyes out or sound whiny. “Nobody else does. They all went on with their lives. They’re functioning adults, they have jobs or they’re at uni and partying all night, or they’re getting married and having kids and I—” he swallows around the newly formed lump in his throat, “I have no idea what I’m doing.”
It was official: Draco could be the sweetest, kindest lover one minute, and a devious imp the next. He enjoyed playing with his food, so to speak, and Harry couldn’t get enough of it. Driven to near-madness, Harry watched him suck on his cock, swallowing every last drop when Harry came, and looking up at Harry with those enchanting silver eyes, reddened mouth stretched wide. Harry could feel himself soften, his hypersensitivity requiring tremendous efforts to keep standing. And because Draco could read him like an open book, he stopped sucking just before it became painful. Shaking, Harry pulled him into a messy kiss. “You,” he bit Draco’s lower lip and drank his gasp, “are spectacular.”
Malfoy had taken so many notes that he’d started swearing when his hand began to cramp. Harry had laughed, then apologised, and they’d gone back to the lesson.
Harry’s voice in Parseltongue doesn’t sound like the Dark Lord’s. That must be why he doesn’t go past “startled”.
Draco’s eyes were wide, and his nostrils flared. “How dare you? I understand it perfectly well! I’ll have you know Mother and I visited the Kennedy Space Centre, can you say the same?”
He stretched his hole, soft and slow, hooking his fingers to find that sweet spot. His breath shuddered. His cock leaked on the sheets, no longer hard yet getting wetter with each push against his prostate. He couldn’t help but moan, wrist aching. He loved this. To avoid a humiliating reveal of his sexual prowesses on the front page of the
Now, what to do with this milk? What could give it some texture? He mentally reviewed what he knew. Cheese would be nice, but it wouldn’t be a quiche lorraine then, would it? A runny potion needed heat; he figured milk would be similar. He transferred it into a pan, turned on the heat and let it warm up. It boiled a lot quicker than he expected. He lowered the temperature and chose to add some flour. The results were encouraging.
Clean the bathroom. Start the laundry. When he entered the kitchen to see what recipe his aunt wanted him to follow for dinner, he found her already busy cooking, three plates on the table. Harry wasn’t allowed to eat at the table unless Aunt Marge visited, but Aunt Petunia never cooked if she could avoid it, so what was happening? Worried, he called her name, but she didn’t even look at him. He tapped her gently on the arm, yet she didn’t seem to feel him.
“I’m not sure why you’re not doing it yourself.” Potter’s inquisitive gaze did
I hadn't planned on turning that ritual into some sort of sex magic insanity, but there it is.
Draco disagreed. Sure, it was lush and thick and not as gaudy as it could have been, but that was it. Not to mention, it had been there on Saturday already, it wasn’t
Draco stares at him and smirks. “Turn to page 394,” he drawls, and Harry grins.
Each type of creature felt different when they watched him, and today marked yet another encounter with the kind that reminded Harry of his walk into the forest to sacrifice himself. It wasn’t pleasant.
Now, that was interesting. Harry looked at him until Malfoy told him he wasn’t a mind-reader and he should speak if he wanted to keep the conversation going. They might not be enemies anymore, but it was still awkward to be together.
The look of disbelief on the child’s face is priceless. “Boats,” he replies slowly, as if he never heard such a stupid question in his short life.
With a glare at the garden, Draco sneers. “Harvesting. I have a Wiggenweld Potion to brew.” With a dramatic sigh, he brushes his hair away from his face. “I’ll be right back. Unless you are against the idea of me studying in your living room.”
Harry grinned. “You’ll regret this.” And he pounced first.
“Bad idea,” Draco replied with an air of mischief. “Wood and Bell are stuck under the mistletoe. Looks like they’ll stay there all night.”
They packed the tent after a quick breakfast. They could stay for the rest of December and still have a myriad of places to visit, but they both agreed to go home because they didn't want to travel for too long with the Mind Compass in their luggage. So, with the melancholy associated with the end of any successful trip, they made their way back to Addis Ababa. Draco left Potter's side to buy a few gifts for his friends, remembering that he still didn't know what to give Mother.
“Let’s not pretend damaging human property can ever affect a balance that exists since the dawn of time, shall we?” Croaker drawled, before nodding towards the door. “Please see yourself out, Unspeakable K.”
“Okay. Malfoy, I’m off. Thor will need to go outside for his walk. You can just open the door; he’ll run around the fields on his own. Or you can go out with Scorpius, your choice. Don’t worry about Thor getting lost, he’s too obsessed with food to venture far.”
“Potter, I’ll hex you!”
Suddenly, the paper disappeared, lights came on where the door had been, revealing a hole and stairs. There were no lamps, only floating bubbles shining in the dark.
“The young ones will listen to your orders if you only try it once, as they don’t belong to any specific human. Afterwards, they start to wonder who you are, so it doesn’t really work more than once with the same owl. We used to breed them at the Manor.”
fountain pen and parchment,” he said, catching the items when they flew across the kitchen.
With that, he pays, and leaves Harry alone with a Fwooper eyeing his hair in interest. Harry wishes he’ll run into Malfoy again.
Laughing, Harry opened his backpack and reached for the temperature regulator.
Sharing every meal helps with that for sure: recently, he hasn’t tightened his belt like he used to, his hips aren’t as bony, and he’s discovering a wide range of flavours thanks to his desire to push Draco’s taste buds out of their comfort zone. If it gets Molly off his back about his weight, he’ll take it.
“Well, the stove wasn’t hot enough. It’ll be just fine in the oven.”
“Well, we’re going to pretend we’re not the same person, of course. I have a fake name, Harry Jim Evans. Evans was Mum’s name, too.”
He stirs, looks to his right and smiles. Scarhead sleeps on his belly, peaceful and unfairly attractive (in reality, he’s drooling on his pillow and looks ridiculous, but Draco is blinded by his feelings).
Fuck, he can’t start bawling now! Knockturn isn’t popular, but still. What if the
Harry’s let out a shuddering breath and Malfoy tightened his hold on him before letting go. He’d gotten used to this place; returning to the surface didn’t appeal to him anymore. “Is it okay if we come back sometimes?” He felt Malfoy tense, arm pressed against Harry’s.
Potter shook his head and stared at a miniature golden bust that had chives instead of hair (it was Gilderoy Lockhart. A gift from Pansy). "I thought you'd be living in a Victorian penthouse. This looks too Muggle for you, but it suits you."
A vibrant orange, almost glittering stone with a carving of the Malfoy Crest fell into his open palms, and Harry froze. “Oh my gods Draco what are you doing!” The wardstone! This nutter had just broken the golden rule of ancestral lands! And Harry could feel the magic take hold, that tingling sensation, so similar to the rush of joy from his Patronus, so welcoming, so soft. “These are your ancestral wards, you can’t just—”
“Obviously, it’s mine! Do you think Mother would send me a Portkey to some sort of backwater Muggle dwelling?”
Then he winced. There’d be no hiding his romance novels from Potter if they shared the same bookshelf. But since Harry’s antics helped Draco cope with difficult days, living together couldn’t possibly be a bad thing. He’d even forgotten to give detention to the students responsible for turning his classroom into a toxic wasteland.
He winked. Dobby, like all House Elves of the Manor, knew his real identity, but couldn’t speak of it. Magic prevented it because they could feel that Draco should be their Master. “I need access to the ritual chamber. Are the Malfoys home?”
“No, my wand is still tugging at me.” He cast a Revealing Charm, which Harry complemented with the same detection spells he’d used on his mirror. If he put enough power in them, they’d cover a wide area.
Their first time occurs one snowy afternoon in Gryffindor Tower. It’s intense and terrifying and incredible - it’s everything Draco dreamed of and more.
“Okay.”
It saw him, and the lantern lit up. As it rushed towards him, Harry cried out, and felt Draco’s arms around him and the soft fabric of his cloak covering him; and the entity stopped. Its multiple grins were gone, and it stayed there, dripping oil-like slime all over the grass.
Draco lowered his wand but kept it ready to cast. Then the woman, whose breath had the distinct scent of cheap Firewhiskey, realised she was stuck under the mistletoe, not with Harry, but with Draco. She blanched, and her eyes bugged out. Repulsed at the idea of putting his face anywhere near her, Draco pointed his wand at the bundled twigs and tilted his head. “Ça vient de chez Wheezes
Malfoy’s frown disappears behind a blank mask. “I didn’t take you for a Weird Sisters enthusiast.”
For the next half-hour, Harry traipsed the grounds of an ex-classmate’s familial home, cleansing every nest or lone leech, until the wind brought in a sense of peace. Now, he needed to see to Mrs Macmillan’s hand.
“Git.”
“If I buy lemons, I’ll forget them,” Draco says. He wipes his mouth with his napkin. “At some point they’re able to walk on their own.”
Harry came home to a delicious smell that made his mouth water. He’d been tense after his visit at the Ministry and he’d gone to Diagon Alley, where he'd truly believed he’d strangle someone by lunchtime, so he’d fled to Luna’s for the afternoon. As usual, she didn’t need to ask what was wrong. She talked about Blibbering Humdingers, they shared homemade biscuits and listened to Tori Amos, until Harry felt ready to go home.
Smith counted down to three, and his goons started to work on runic arrays while he blasted curse after curse at the wards. Draco trusted Weasley, as strange as it sounded. Thor was barking and growling in a way Draco never thought he’d be able to, and it was the only thing anchoring Draco to sanity.
“Hedjogs have many!” Scorpius bounces in his arms, sticky fingers gripping Draco’s shirt. “Many, many, many!”
An old conversation with Draco in the Chamber of Secrets flashed into his mind. Draco had been annoyed at his lack of spell knowledge. “Not for this. I suspect the other pieces could be in different countries—”
“Of course not, your own stubbornness makes you blind to your fellow Gryffindors’ failings. I’m surrounded by overeager puppies with a righteous streak who think sliding down the bannister should be an acceptable way to get out of the building! I suffer daily, Potter, and you will never understand the depth of my pain.” The volume of Draco’s voice (and Harry’s laughter) was attracting attention, and Harry could tell that no
“I made you some hot chocolate. If you don’t want it, I’ll drink it.” And he would. He had a massive sweet tooth.
They all sleep late the next morning.
“Do you know a spell, so we don’t get lost?” Harry asked.
“Can’t tell you that.” He frowned, then hissed at the door, making Malfoy flinch and engaging the mechanism that clanked ominously in the darkness. He’d thought that the Horcrux was what had given him the ability to speak to snakes until an adder spent fifteen minutes complaining about gnomes when Harry stayed at the Burrow during the summer. Hermione had been so excited, but Harry hadn’t seen what the big deal was.
Confused, Harry opens the box and finds sixteen vials of unknown potion. “Is that poison?”
“Oh, I’m sure you can.” A kiss. “Potty.”
An exaggerated nod was his answer before his big grey eyes widened as he took in the room. “Ooooh, pweeetty!”
Since it was Monday, and still early enough to see a hint of blue on the edges of the sky, the pub was almost empty—people were still busy shopping or working. An old couple shared a pint at the bar, and a family sat at the booth closest to the window, gorging themselves on fish and chips. Harry waved at the smiling bartender and headed to the back of the room, walking around a wide pillar and finding his usual table, snug into a corner, away from prying eyes. His general good mood improved tenfold when Hermione spotted him. She jumped out of her seat and hugged him, making him laugh when her hair got stuck on his glasses.
!), but Draco kept them in a cupboard because Jim said he didn’t want to see that when they were eating.
Draco nodded. "Would that cause any issue?"
Emerald eyes pierce right through him, dark circles heavy under them.
A knock at the door startled him badly enough to make him jump to his feet and grab his wand. Ron’s hand on his wrist helped slow his breathing.
Harry has never been angrier at any kind of interruption before. He glares at the bird.
to die, like Harry had done him a bloody
Hands raised in surrender, Harry narrowly dodges her attempt at slapping his upper arm. “I’m sorry.” That’s all he can say. He doubted her. Hermione Granger, who believes so strongly in justice and argued about Draco being a child, swept in something much bigger than him. Worse, he distanced himself from her, when she stood by his side, unwavering, for so long.
Malfoy’s face lost its guard for a second; the corner of his mouth twitched as if he thought Harry was funny. Harry counted it as a victory.
“Yeah, me too. No questions about the war, either.” Harry didn’t wish to discuss Voldemort ever again. His Mind Healer had done a fabulous job, but now he knew why people flinched after hearing his name: it made him uneasy. The colour green could bring him to his knees, lost in a memory. Harry was dealing with the mental scarring to the best of his abilities, but sometimes he lost the battle. He had learned there was nothing wrong with it. Seeing Malfoy’s sneer, he understood that the young man suffered from flashbacks as well. He noticed him rubbing his left arm. “Okay, so, I’ll start. Why bartending?”
This was good news. Draco didn’t want to overcrowd his bedroom, not that he owned many things. “Any rules you want me to follow? Anywhere I can’t go?”
The door opened, revealing Draco with his fake face, and another man who was very thin and very pale, with long hair like Jim’s. He had Draco’s eyes. Harry remembered the stories about Draco’s family; Sirius was his cousin, and he was the brother of Regulus Black, who was a hero in many of Jim’s stories and owned an insane elf. Harry liked hearing about Kreacher.
“The noise, too. I wasn’t expecting it. I just — can we go somewhere that is not Hogwarts or Hogsmeade or London?”
When Harry comes home from work, Draco grabs his arm and hands him a wooden spoon. “The bolognese is almost ready. I broke the shed and kitchen windows, but they’re fixed. Scorp is watching
Harry groaned, and Draco sat up quickly, dislodging the arm around his waist and scooting away in his sleeping bag. Green eyes blinked and squinted. "Morning, Malfoy."
— who rolled his eyes.
Narcissa sighed. “I owe the Headmistress twenty Galleons. Please Floo back to school now.”
The Weasel bound Hestia Carrow with magic-suppressing shackles, while the others, who looked familiar, stunned the men trapped by the plants. Longbottom broke the spell, putting these terrifying guardians to sleep once more, and Harry walked up to Draco, worry etched on his face.
Harry glanced at the area he pointed at. This desert, like many others, hid the traces of old magical villages or cities—ruins invisible to Muggles and often undiscovered by modern witches and wizards. The world was too vast; there were few magical beings around, even less with the required qualifications. Archaeology in their world uncovered secrets at a snail’s pace compared to the Muggle world, even with the different spells that should’ve made the process easier and faster. The study itself wasn’t popular. The lack of a museum dedicated to magical history spoke for itself. Instead, the nations under the International Confederation of Wizards formed Unspeakables—too busy with other matters, like the mysteries of magic itself—or Curse-Breakers, whose job was more about disabling traps than finding broken pieces of antique pottery. Those who wanted to get involved in archaeology went to Muggle universities and usually worked in the Muggle world afterwards.
Stepping in front of the welcome witch’s desk, he handed her the wand Ollivanders had created for him after the war and refrained from rolling his eyes at her exaggerated gasp. He couldn’t stand it. The glimmer in her eyes, the heavy breathing, the tremor in her voice. He was still revered, and he hated it.
Oh, that was
“Are you trying to kill me?” Draco answered between gritted teeth. “Ask me again after I’ve digested, please.”
Draco applied more pressure on his wand. “He didn’t come to save you. Leave!”
Draco was uncharacteristically quiet for the next few hours. They dressed in Muggle clothes, rented two bicycles and spent the entire morning cycling on wide avenues, trying not to get into any accident (Draco’s skills on two wheels had improved, but still, he’d never ridden one before Harry taught him when they hung around the Antalya Coast). Harry loved how green the city was; thick trees rose at every corner, sheltering birds of all kinds and providing shade when Draco needed a break from the sun. They took pictures on the shore of the lake, avoided persistent street vendors and played their part as tourists by joining one of the cruises on the river. They had grilled fish for lunch, then headed back to the hidden magical street near the university. From there, they rented brooms equipped with Notice-Me-Not and Muggle-Repelling Charms and flew over the Blue Nile river. Harry kept glancing at a beaming Draco and got distracted by his gorgeous smile, losing the race to the falls. They joined a game of pick-up Quidditch and took a break from the Compass and the thing in the mirror. Harry caught the Snitch, Malfoy unveiled a talent for the Beater position, and they were invited to dinner by their impromptu teams.
“Yes, and I’ve asked Filius and Minerva, and they can’t help. I think I need a potion.”
As expected, Malfoy Manor sells quickly. Draco is at a loss, like he never expected to have so much money at his disposal so soon. He doesn’t seem eager to spend it, either. A few years of surviving on his apprenticeship wage taught him the value of a coin, and Harry expects he’s going to hoard those new riches. He doesn’t even need to use them for the house: Harry pays for it, because there’s no way they’d make a joint purchase. The mere concept is ridiculous. Draco is too proud to live there rent free and insists on paying him anyway. Harry decides to donate that money to a local charity.
bad. He glanced up at the menu above the till, which boasted a “make your own drink” option, then thought back on Malfoy’s sugar addiction and decided to let the worker’s creativity flow.
“I can make badges. Potter, Solver of the Mystery of the Slow Comet.”
“It’s not the rock, Malfoy.” He took a few steps around it, then peered at his confused companion from the opposite side. “There’s something beneath.”
Harry lathered a piece of bread with his favourite jam and ate quietly, glancing at his friend until his shoulders sagged, indicating a better mood. Food always helped. And because Harry also knew some tricks to deal with him, he served him a cup of tea, just how Draco liked it. It worked.
“Moving in.”
“Insanity. Come on, I’ve bought something for you.”
He also tried to lower his stress levels by drinking coffee, and yes, he was aware of the contradiction.
“Is that the kind that requires French kissing? Because I asked George to stop selling it—”
Draco twisted his body to lie on his side, propping his upper body up against the armrest. “Someone’s coming.”
“I do not know what ailed me, Snakelings, but I know my reputation from the murmurs in the walls. While I cannot visit frames outside of the Chamber, Hogwarts speaks to me. I am afraid the stories you have heard about me are true, though they come from the ramblings of a madman.”
were located above Mulpepper’s apothecary with a separate entrance at the back. Harry slid into the narrow gap between Mulpepper’s and the cauldron shop, just in time: the door opened and out came a giggling Ginny, followed by Draco.
“I promise. We’ll make pizza; you can’t mess that up.”
“I promise to apologise if I get you killed.”
He could’ve left it at that. Could’ve discarded the idea that had sprouted in his brain after hearing his family history—after learning that he owed his olive skin tone and unruly hair to ancestors who’d dwelt far from England. He’d almost done it; he’d nearly forgotten his plans. But he didn’t, not entirely.
wooden lantern.”
“No one follows me in here.”
“Fuck, do that again!” He kisses him deeply, tasting the sweetness of treacle tart and chocolate mousse. He’s so hard he can’t think. His fingers explore and tease. Harry calls his name in that breathless way that almost causes him to come.
❄️Happy Holidays! ❄️
“It’s effective.” Draco paused and squeezed Harry’s wrist. “Are you cold?”
"Her Patronus is a dragon." He tried to remember what her wand was, as she's gotten a new one after the war. A memory of a trip to a French wandmaker came to mind—vine and dragon heartstring.
“Me neither.” Harry sneezes again and decides to take the bull by the horns. “I’ll go with you.”
Good. Harry would’ve been furious otherwise. So much time lost, hiding in the woods—and for what? Sometimes, Harry wondered if camping for so many months had been necessary. It wasn’t like they’d found a Horcrux in the forest of Dean; they hadn’t even been
“Well, good thing the house didn’t come crashing down on us.”
Little Fred, who’d recently learned to walk, was toddling around the living room with his mum close behind in case he lost his balance. For a minute, Harry missed Teddy fiercely, but he buried the feeling as fast as he could. It was nonsense. He’d see him tomorrow.
Malfoy is busy petting Pinecone, who purrs like a motorbike, when Harry finally sits by his side after being shooed away from the kitchen. “I thought you only had one tattoo,” Harry says, judging it a safe topic.
Two mugs, shaped like Santa and an upside-down snowman, waited for them on the table when they parted. A random fleeting thought struck Draco then: he was happy, and he’d never felt better.
“Yes, I can see that, but why did you stay in here? You’ve been gone from Hogwarts for hours.”
The piece of parchment vanished in a tiny burst of flames, and the house shimmered into view. Anyone looking at it would see the same house that had always been there and none of the changes Draco and Harry planned on carrying out. Even the real garden was hidden under an illusion.
“Did you just compare me to that peacock?”
Harry stares. Malfoy has a pet crow, and is dressed like Sirius, and — that’s a tattoo peeking out from under his sleeve. He glances up and notices Malfoy is waiting for something. Shit. Did Harry stop listening? “That’s, er, a good name for a crow.”
