Ron did not look happy to be there at all. He had been hoping to spend the day alone with Harry, and that hope was foiled by learning there was another boy there. He always had to share, but he thought maybe this time it wasn't entirely anyone's fault. It's not like the rest of his siblings asked to be sick. He looked at the blonde boy curiously, sitting through his introduction.
"Oh this letter is addressed to Draco, it must be from your new friend. Why don't you finish your breakfast and then you can go upstairs and work on your response. While I write to Remus to see when he is free for you to come visit them again." Narcissa said as she looked at Draco, who seemed about to leap out of his chair.
Harry nodded. "I'm not giving it to you so you'll be my friend. I'm giving it to you because you are my friend, Draco."
"What the bloody hell, Potter?" Draco asked the letter in confusion. He honestly wasn't sure how to respond to it. He supposed it was someone's idea of a prank. There were people who forged Potter's handwriting and signature now, so it could just as easily have been one of them. He hadn't recognized the owl after all.
Draco finished speaking and finally looked back up at Remus, hoping the man wouldn't judge him for his parents' name, and wanting Remus to see the true happiness in his eyes as he spoke about Harry.
He hoped that was good enough. Remus came up and read him a story, and then he laid down in his bed and snuggled Wolfy. He was briefly surprised when he fell asleep, but then he was asleep and dreaming of what he and Draco would do next time they were together.
Draco knew his mother would come get him in a little while but he just didn't care anymore. He was sad and lonely and a little scared of losing this new world of his...so he just let himself cry. In between sobs he said, "Can I really be friends with Ron too? Do you really think so Remus? And I'm sorry I mentioned sleepovers, I know those are just for special occasions when it's guaranteed safe and super planned out...I just don't like to sleep in my room. It's always so dark..."
Draco accepted his gift from Harry, and put it into his pocket before going down the stairs, following Remus. Curious, Draco looked down to see who had come to get him, and he was unsurprised to see his mother waiting. She only looked a little annoyed though, mostly she seemed impatient.
Within minutes they stepped out into their own house, dark and dreary as it usually was and at his Mother's request Draco went up to his room.
Remus had prepared his lesson plans, figuring that Lucius would want Narcissa to look them over. He had modified them a bit for two boys, instead of one, but it was fairly simple to do so. "I hope you're well this morning." The older werewolf offered, showing the respect due a Lady, even if he disapproved of her personal choices.
He blushed when Draco called him the nicest person, though his darker skin made it so the blush didn't show nearly as much as the blonde's did. His skin had gotten darker after the funny dog - wolf, Remus said it was a werewolf - had bitten him.
Harry had almost forgotten that he had written to Draco and was waiting for a reply when the owl came. It was a much fancier owl than the one he and Remus had, though Remus had told him that he could get an owl when he was older. That way he could send mail all by himself. But he had to be old enough to handle the bird first, and that made sense. He hoped he was old enough soon.
"So a joke is supposed to be funny, right? Maybe you could tell me about some of your favorite pranks your friends have done? I might understand it better that way." Draco asked curiously, holding tight to Harry's hand as he led him through the joke shop, a store he had never been in before.
Harry, now cleaned up, bounced over to Draco's side. "C'mon, you can play with me, in my room, while we wait for your mum or dad to come get you." He was highly excited, wanting to show the blonde all of his toys because he'd never had any before Remus and he loved them a lot. He also wanted to show Draco his secret pet. It was a secret, because Remus had said he wasn't old enough for a pet yet, but this one talked to him and he made sure it stayed warm.
Plus, after the war, they'd not been the same people that they were before it. Harry was more jaded, and less flexible. Surviving death twice would do that to a man, he guessed, though. His abnormal childhood had probably had an effect on him as well. He'd gone through four Mind Healers before he found one that didn't try to leak his personal information to the press. The fifth was good as her word, though, and he was working through his past traumas.
Draco looked confused at Harry saying Remus was coming upstairs but he assumed that Harry's hearing was better than his and so he just nodded and watched as Harry put his pet back outside. Draco looked around Harry's room again, his spirits sinking because if Remus was on his way up, that most likely meant that his parents or at least one of his parents had arrived…
That was three years ago, three years ago they got that awful news.  three more holidays, three more years with the kids.   As Hermione laid in bed gasping softly for the next breath. "Sev.... Severus," She whispered breathless as she reached for him.  For the first time in his life Severus Snape was grateful his son and daughter had decided to come home from the holidays.   As Severus walked over to his wife opening another potion as he forced down her throat hoping it made it easier to breath.   He watched as she took it happy she had.  "Severus, I" Severus had cut her off 'Say hi to lily, give Fred a hug for me ok? They will protect you until I can. Don't you worry about the kids. I can hold down the fort here," Severus whispered kissing Hermione softly.    Severus couldn't bare to watch his son and daughter say goodbye as he walked into the kitchen.
When morning came Severus got to work, making the potion to manage the wolfs symptoms caused by lack of care.   As Severus worked trying his best tp ignore the man who was hovering.  It was no east task. "Can I help you or do you like watching me work?" Severus asked in the same cold tone.  Remus didn't speak for a moment or two.  "I cant leave you," He said as he watch Severus turn on his heels.  "Oh?" He asked in a voice that seemed more annoyed than anything.
Albus was always sending Severus on stupid missions when the man needed nothing but peace.   Tugging on his robes and vest as he stood there.  This style was something he had to admit it hid his growling middle well.  Bagging up his things and shrinking them to fix in the pocket of his robes, taking one last look around his home.  A sigh left the mans mouth as he held his hand to his stomach feeling the movement within.   Giving his house elf one last order he apprated to Grimwald place.   Raising his hand as he knocked on the door only for Mrs. Black to announce his presences before he could knock.    Remus Lupin appeared from behind the door, looking like hell.   His suit was tore and dirty.  "You look like hell." Remarked the potions master as he stood there to be let in.   Watching with a concerned look as the werewolf stepped aside Severus hand still tried to protect his baby bump a little.   Of course to Remus that wasn't obvious with the clothes and the glamor.
As Draco came home, to find his girlfriend curled up in bed. Draco’s cloak wrapped around her as she shook and shivered.   “Hermione?” Draco asked rushing over.  Feeling her forehead he sighed her temperature was raising fast.   Draco rushed off coming back with a potion that should of reduced the fever.  Expect Hermione wouldn’t take it.
“I can’t take that. It’s bad,” she whispered to Weak to raise her head more than a centimeter of the pillow. Draco now recognized as his own.  “Bad for what my love?” He asked softly wondering in panic what she meant.
When his transformation was complete and he was once again human Severus handed him the potion.  "This is all of it you will need." He said as he beginning packing up his things to leave the Black home.  "wait, Severus you cant just go! I know you can feel it too!" Remus yelled Severus just sighed as nodded.  Sighing recently Severus would bring the wolf back to Snape manor.   Appearing the yard again with a pop Severus began his walk through the snow to the front door.  Once inside Remus was showed to a room that Severus had a feeling he wouldn't use.  The house elf Mimsy appeared asking Severus if he needed anything and again he told her he was fine.   "Where shall I" Remus asked not needing to finish the sentence.  "The grounds and house are warded you can transform outside if you would like run off the energy." Severus said.  Remus nodded and headed out to the lawn.   He ran and played like a dog for a while before movement in the house alerted him.  Someone was at the back door.  It looked like Severus.  Something look wrong as the black figure stood there holding on to the doorframe with all the could before falling to the ground. Remus had all he could do to get over there fast enough.   Severus Snape was kneeling on the ground calling for the wolf.  "thought you might like to come in its cold." Severus said as he got to his feet again.  Walking beside him as they slowly made their way to Snape's bedroom.  Remus curled up on the rug and that is all he remembered when he woke beside Severus.
The wolf tilted its head to the side as it inched its way towards him.  Panic began to build in his blood, his heart pounded.   His daughter kicked fiercely back at her father.  His breathe now came in sharp gasps.  The wolf walked over his throat exposed and its tongue laying out to the side.  Severus knew he meant no harm bit panic attacks and PTSD were problems for even wizards.   Severus smell was different, it burned.   Remus sat there confused for a moment or two before pressing his nose to Severus's abdomen.   Immediately the wolf knew it had done wrong as the man had stopped breathing.  Backing up a pace or two Severus just sat there then slowly moved to lay down on the creates.    The wolf knew the man was pregnant. The man inside the wolf was clueless.  Severus slept peacefully for the first time since the attack with the wolf at his side.
Hanging his head he looked up at the sky.  "Please... lily.... care for her.... protect her.... I need to know she is safe," He whispered crying.  Severus Snape had failed his wife, his job was to protect her and he couldn't.    That night as Severus hugged his son and daughter good night, he looked at his wife.   "Why Mrs. Snape, you still are so beautiful, you look just like you did that day when I proposed." Severus whispered crawling into bed with her.  scooping up her small fragile body next to him.  taking a deep breath he kissed her head. The fuzz of her hair starting to grow back tickling his lip.   They laid like this for hours, wrapped in each other and blankets.   Hermione granger-Snape took her last breath on the tenth of January.
Draco Malfoy was always hated, always.  The thing was in sixth year a year after he had admitted to the one, and only Harry Potter that he loved him. Draco stood in Remus Lupin’s classroom facing that wardrobe.  “Now class you remember the spell don’t you?” Lupin said the class nodded.  Draco stood there trembling he thought he knew what the bogart would be. Instead he was in the for the shock of his life.   Draco let out the breathe he had been holding.  He had expected to see Harry’s dead body fall out of the wardrobe. Instead he was faced with his father.  “On your knees boy,” Mr. Malfoy said. The class watched in horror as Draco obeyed. Kneeling, his head down, his hands on his thighs as he waited prayed silently.   “Look at me, look at him. Look at what happens when you defy the dark lord! You will be punished boy!” Mr. Malfoy yelled Draco didn’t even look up. The class stood paralyzed as they watched. “You have to help him Harry,” Hermione whispered watching the boy who had bullied them for years fall apart.  Harry shrugged until he saw his own body fall out the wardrobe. Draco leapt to his feet, his wand in hand as he stared at his father.  “But I love him, please don’t,” he whispered. His gray eyes filling with tears as Lucius  didn’t even move. “Kill him, kill him and server your duty to the dark lord,” Mr. Malfoy whispered.  Watching Draco crumbled at Harry’s feet as he begged for his forgiveness was enough for even Ron.  As Ron yelled the spell vanishing the Bogart as he looked at Malfoy on the floor.  “Come on,” said Ron as he helped Malfoy to feet. Draco had let it happen. what else was left to live for now? Everyone knew how he felt about Harry.  As Ron walked Malfoy outside he finally found the words to say. “It wasn’t real, Harry is alive.” Ron said as he watched Draco slid down the wall to the floor.  Silently they sat there for a while.  Harry and Hermione finally catching up as Draco poured his heart out the Weasley. “He will never love me, he will never care that I won’t kill him.” Draco mumbled as Harry sat down beside Malfoy taking his hand in his own.  Silently Harry sat there holding Draco’s hand.  Harry didn’t need to say I love you too, or he cares. The simple gesture had been enough.
Severus Snape is sent to look after a sick werewolf.   Only problem is Snape is hiding a secret.  One that human Remus seems to know nothing of, but the wolf is all to protective of it.
Werewolves had mates, even if human they felt a pull a need to protect that person.  Remus couldn't explain why but he felt the need to protect the man.   Remus was sure Sirius had been his mate but than again he had never felt this way towards his lover.  Never felt like the other might die if Remus wasn't close.    While Severus was distracted Remus tried to remove the glamor.  Severus ignored the nauseous feeling that over took him.  unaware that Remus could now see his baby bump in full light as he worked.
Draco watched Harry curiously, wondering what kind of pet would be hanging out outside a window. Maybe it was a bird?
On the same day that Draco Malfoy first saw the Weasley family and envied them for their love and affection, Harry Potter was introduced to them by Remus Lupin. They met Molly Weasley with Fred and George, Ronald, and little Ginny. Harry was fascinated, as he'd never had other kids want to be his friend before. He wasn't sure what to do with Ginny, and noticed that Ronald liked to be the center of attention, but he was quite taken with Fred and George. He had never met twins before, and they seemed to understand that he was out of his element.
Harry giggled happily, glad Draco was feeling better. He was happy to go and play with Draco until his mother arrived. From there, Remus and Molly worked on making sure that Draco would be able to attend Ron's birthday, and be friends with Ron, without upsetting his parents. Ron was equally pleased, and fiercely loyal to Draco and Harry. He loved that they were his friends, and only he got to be friends with Draco and Harry.
Harry frowned at Draco's explanation of his mother. "She really, really reminds me of Aunt Petunia now." He wondered if he could talk Remus into letting Draco stay with them, or if that would get them into trouble somehow. He knew he was allowed to stay with Remus because they had gone to a large building with lots of people, and there had been tests, and his name had been put down on some papers as something called a Werewolf. He guessed that was turning into the strange dog when the moon was full.
"Hullo. I'm Ron. I guess it's nice to meet you too. My favorite game is chess... it's when I get to spend time with Dad alone." He fidgeted a bit. "I like adventures, too... Maybe I could come?" He decided to be hopeful instead, and shook the blonde's hand.
Draco debated hugging him, but thought better of it, that wasn't really allowed in his household, no real signs of affection were. Lucius then told Draco good night, and left the boy to his dreams. Draco hopped into bed, excited about his day. He dreamed of more fun times with Harry, and wished to learn more about his new friend.
Draco tentatively reached a hand out towards the snake, not sure if he should try to pet it or not so he spoke to Harry. "Umm can I pet it? Or do they need to sniff me first? I have never met a snake before. But my family has loads of pictures of snakes around the manor. Apparently it's the symbol of our family's usual school House. Whatever that means." Draco said with a shrug, his hand was still reaching towards the snake but hadn't quite reached the animal yet.
"Umm. I have a book about snakes. I know that they lay eggs, and that there are magic ones, and that some have poison and some eat by squishing things to death. And once in a while they shed their whole skins! Even over their eyes!"
Harry beamed brightly. "You're welcome, Draco. Thank you for being my friend." He wriggled, and if he had a tail it would have been wagging madly.
Narcissa glared a warning at Remus before replying. "My parenting techniques are none of your business. Though I am glad that Draco was somewhere...safe." She rolled her eyes at the smallness of the apartment. "I will just wait here then, shall I?" Narcissa said as Remus left her in the main room.
Harry's word proved true. Molly came with a boy close to their age, with bright red hair. The boy didn't look very happy to be there, but Molly said something about the rest of the kids having some sort of sickness and Ron being lucky not to catch it, and wanting him away for the day so that she could brew remedies and Floo St. Mungo's without worrying that he would be bored or also get sick.
Draco looked his new friend over, trying to get a good read on him. He seemed to really want to be Draco's friend, for whatever reason, and he seemed sincere about his Uncle being a good person. Harry also seemed determined to be friends with Draco regardless of what anyone else thought, and he seemed capable of sticking up for himself. So Draco shook himself a bit to get some of his fear to go away, or at least lessen it, and nodded to Harry.
Draco danced about, he had stopped hugging Harry, but had grabbed his best friend's hand, still craving some form of contact. He danced while he waited for Remus to respond. Grey eyes alight with joy and hope.
"I do live near here, with Uncle Remus. He's the best. I don't mind you sticking with me." Harry grinned a bit and tugged Draco down to the joke shop.
Draco giggled a little at Harry's happy dance and bounced up and down as his friend danced. He felt happy for the first time in quite a while, and while he was still nervous, he felt hope that it would work out. Draco looked Remus up and down, trying to size up the man, and read him as well as he could. Remus seemed kind, and non threatening. So Draco smiled at him shyly.
The young boy known as Harry Potter lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin until he was about four years old. While he was there, they didn't treat him kindly at all. They were horrible, and starved him, and generally neglected him, favoring their own son instead while the boy in question took all of Harry's things and blamed him for all the problems. At least, that was up until he got bit by the funny looking dog after they locked him out on a full moon.
Ron danced a little as well, Draco's energy infectious. He had enjoyed passing the list around, and giggled along with Draco. He liked being part of this new group, even if his Mum had told him to be careful of the other boy at Harry's. He didn't see what was so wrong with Draco. He seemed nice, and friendly, and he thought maybe his Mum could be wrong sometimes.
Ron perked up a bit at Draco offering him to go first. He glanced over at Harry too, but smiled. "Yeah. I don't mind needing a little help. Mum says help is how we learn." He took the quill and let Remus help him spell out the first thing they needed on their list. His handwriting was a little sloppy, but readable. Remus smiled to see the two getting along.
Realizing he still hadn't finished answering Harry's question, and that he was still holding the boy's hand, Draco dropped his arm suddenly, scared he would seem odd to this boy who seemed to be friendly. Draco had always wanted a real friend and so he didn't want to mess this up. "I am okay, just a little in shock I guess. I didn't pay attention to where we were walking. Are you okay?" Draco asked earnestly, hoping that he hadn't hurt Harry.
, or Siau Scops Owl. Harry liked him quite a bit. His spotty brown feathers and large round face made him look distinguished. He also enjoyed the bird's small 'horns.' That was another difference between Hedwig and this owl. Hedwig had never had those feathers that stuck up on the sides. But then, she'd been an entirely different sort of bird.
He found it, and started calling to it. His voice sounded different when he did, more slippery and sibilant. "Hey, you can come in. Uncle Remuss isn't here. I want you to meet my friend, Draco." He reached for something just out of view, and came back in the window with a small snake wrapped around his arm and bright eyes.
"Well I don't think you are a freak, I think you are the nicest person I've ever met!" Draco exclaimed and then blushed because of his words. His face was pale and the pink really stood out on his cheeks. Draco looked down at his feet as he continued talking.
Narcissa rolled up her scroll and waited for a few minutes before going to check on Draco. "Draco are you done with your response letter? I have written to Remus about seeing when you can visit them next, but I wanted to send my letter with yours."
Draco giggled happily at the snake and bowed his head as a sign of respect. "I am sorry friend, I didn't realize you could understand us. But I am glad you do. It's nice to meet you, glad you are okay with me petting you." Draco said and then he proceeded to scratch the scales on the snake's hood. He did it softly and carefully not wanting to be too rough with the snake.
"Have a good night Ron, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow!" Draco said as happily as he could while still recovering from his crying. Draco waved and watched the Weasleys leave Remus's. As soon as the door shut behind them Draco lost his control, ran to his bag of toys, grabbed his favorite white cat plushie and curled up on the floor, crying into it.
The man, Remus, took some kind of medicine every month, but said that it would hurt Harry's insides, and so Harry couldn't have it. He saw how it made the man-wolf-man lethargic, and decided he didn't ever want to take it. He would learn how not to bite and scratch and be bad. After all, whatever made him change was good. It had brought him to Remus, and Remus was good and kind.
It was while Draco was reading an illustrated version of "Tales of Beedle the Bard" that Narcissa received a letter from Remus. She read it, and thought about the idea of just dropping Draco off most days before she left the house to socialize and what have you. Narcissa was certain that Lucius wouldn't mind if she did this since they had already agreed to let Draco be friends with the Potter boy, hoping that in time it would work out in their favor. Thoughtfully, Narcissa consulted a watch on the wall that showed the time in terms of the Lunar Cycle. The full moon was still quite a ways away. Narcissa nodded at the clock as if it could see her thinking and pulled out another piece of parchment.
Remus smiled brightly. "Yes, we really can have ice cream now." He was happy to see the small blonde boy so happy. "I don't mind that you don't know what kind of ice cream you like. I'm sure we can help you either remember, or pick a new one." He gathered what he needed to go out.
Draco giggled at the accidental sweater magic, it sounded like it had been a good thing for Harry at least. He was awed by Harry's ability to do magic randomly, he rarely saw other kids so he didn't realize it was that common. Draco also was able to do magic at random times but nothing as cool as shrinking something he didn't want to wear or heating up a branch forever. Draco was impressed by his new friend, and to make things better Harry was really nice.
"Well I don't think that you are evil, even when you transform into a werewolf, you are still a good person. I am sorry that transforming hurts you though, that can't be fun to live through all the time. Is there a way to make it less painful? I know you won't bite me, I trust you Harry. Do you have to be alone when you transform? That sounds worse than just having to transform. Can friends be with you? I don't like the idea of you being alone when you are in pain..." Draco said with empathy in his voice.
"I'm okay. I know I look all skinny and stuff, but I'm pretty tough. I don't see your mum anywhere, so maybe you'd better come with me. Uncle Remus will know how to find her again, but you'll be safe if you stick with me here." He smiled. "I'm getting something for a Christmas present for my friends, Fred and George. They like to play pranks. You want to help me?"
Harry noticed Draco looking at the joke items, and picked up a couple of extra ones for him to try. Ones that shouldn't get him into trouble with his parents. They mostly changed into something else, or sent a spray of harmless sparks somewhere. He liked those ones best, sometimes, when he just wanted something silly to laugh at.
Harry bit back a giggle. "It smells with its tongue. Isn't that cool?" He smiled brightly, watching Draco's face to see how he reacted. His own lisp wasn't as noticeable when the snake spoke. He watched, waiting to see how Draco would respond to his pet. He hoped that Draco liked talking with it just as much as he did.
A few weeks later, Draco's mother said they were going into town for the day to do some Christmas shopping. Draco's eyes lit up at the thought, and he rushed to make sure he was presentable before his mother could change her mind. Narcissa looked Draco over before they left the Manor and gave him a curt nod of something close to approval, but definitely not love. Diagon Alley had more people around than usual, but Draco's eyes scanned the crowd hungrily regardless, looking for that flaming red hair. Draco was so distracted that he wasn't watching the path ahead of him, and sadly neither was Narcissa. She was merely dragging Draco by his arm, forcing him to move along behind her, not worrying about whether or not he could keep pace. She was a woman on a mission and nothing was going to stand in her way, not even her son. Narcissa had only brought Draco along to pick out his presents for the holiday, and then they would return home. As Draco's eyes scanned the crowd frantically looking for that nice family, he lost track of where he was going completely but didn't realize it until he ran into something. Or more accurately someone. Draco's mother kept walking, unaware that her contact with her son had been severed. Draco, stood up shakily ready to murmur an apology to whoever he had walked into, and race to catch his mother, when his eyes finally took in the kid in front of him. He had to be the same age as Draco, or very close to it, and his hair was jet black. Draco thought he looked familiar but couldn't quite place him.
Draco shook his head, and set the now wrinkled piece of parchment aside. He'd been awake too long, and really ought to go to bed. He'd finish job hunting in the morning. He got up and took himself off to bed, unaware that this was only the first of many deliveries.
He sighed a bit. "I used to live with Aunt Petunia and her husband and son. They're a lot like your mum, I think. They didn't want me to have any friends, though, and I didn't really pick the Weasleys. Uncle Remus said I needed friends, and took me there. You're the first person I wanted to be my friend that I can actually do something about."
"Well thank you Remus, sir, that means a lot to me. I have never been told that before. But I think I would like to come here to visit more often if I could...but that depends on Mother I guess..." Draco finished speaking with a  resigned sigh.
"Well then I am glad that you both have found each other. I hope that you never have to go back to your Aunt and Uncle's they seem very bad indeed. I am sorry you had to be with them at all. But Remus is very kind and he seems to truly care about you so that makes me happy. And yeah we could have nightly sleepovers at school though if we are in the same House! That would be so cool! But we will always be best friends, I can just tell."
"Good morning Remus, are those the lesson plans?" Narcissa asked, looking at the papers on the desk. "I am well, I hope you both are too. If you don't mind I will take them home to look them over? Especially if you have them for the whole week? That way I can just look them over at the same time. If not that's fine for today. But if possible I would prefer to have the lessons for the week in advance, if that's not too much trouble. I know that Draco is excited for these visits. So other than looking over the lesson plans I think we are good here." Narcissa said quietly. She clearly was out of her comfort zone in this place, but she was also treating Remus as respectfully as she could so it seemed like progress to her.
"Oh your friends' prank sounds funny to me! I think that's a good way to get back at their brother for being mean, but I don't have a brother so I guess I wouldn't really know...." Draco said with a giggle at Harry’s story.
Harry yawned and looked at Draco, who was sitting on the ground next to him, a blanket covering his legs- it wasn't really clear, but Harry could see the pillow laying on the floor and the rug wrinkled under it. Connecting all the dots was easy.
Draco tried to push again, but Harry was holding him strongly. If he wanted to, he could have used a spell to get free of his grab- but it was rather comfortable to lay there. For a recently injured person, it was surprising Harry wasn't complaining about how he was closely brushing his wound, “What about the wound?”
And the destiny was totally in his favour (or against him, it depends) when he collided with the person that was owning his thoughts. The one and only, Draco Malfoy.
“Harry’s got a little crush,” claimed Ginny, who appeared out of nowhere, claiming her place next to Hermione, “It’s pretty evident.”
Draco mumbled something and grabbed his wand that was laying next to him and muttered some spell. It took a few seconds for Harry to see it, there was a long scar going up from his neck to what it seemed down his chest. It wasn't really striking, but it was noticeable at a close distance. That's why Draco used a glamour charm- they were always working side to side, Harry would have already noticed and asked about it.
And Harry swallowed, because he actually did not want to remember it. He was trying to keep an interesting conversation, but he had exposed himself without noticing.
Harry lifted his head, staring at the blood pooling from his torso. , “Yeah, it’s really bloody,” he agreed, “in case you couldn't tell.”
Harry chuckled to hide the fact he was becoming as red as a tomato, “Thank you,” he scratched his neck, “I guess.”
Draco laughed, his head going back with it. It was the first time Harry had seen him laugh since the war, and he loved it so much he wanted to push him against the wall and steal his air in the most desperate kiss ever.
Harry knew exactly what he was talking about- the whole sectumsempra thing. He knew Draco could not have healed himself that time because of how badly injured he was at the time, but he assumed he had to learn how to treat his own wounds after it happened.
“For the start of the year, they are really pushing us, huh?” Harry rolled his eyes, “What is it about?”
“I have survived with less, thank you very much,” and with that the conversation was done, of that he thought until Harry tugged on his sleeve a little bit stronger that Draco could have expected, making him fall against Harry's body, he blushed instantly, pushing, “What are you doing?”
But Harry was still staring at him to what looked like his attempt of puppy eyes- how old was he again? ten?
“Hey, Potter,” one of the guys called him, and Harry rolled his eyes because he knew he was one of the main assholes in his same year, “We were waiting for you.”
“...Are you mad at me and Ron? Because I promise you we won’t fight that much if you come back and spend time with us. We are worried about you.”
Harry was already regretting his words after seeing the opposite reaction, so he quickly shook his head while moving his hands awkwardly, “I'm sorry! I don't know why I said that. Just forget it, okay? maybe I should go and get something from the kitchens-”
“Once a Death-Eater always a Death-Eater,” Harry could swear he saw a strange mark sticking out the guy's arm, “Did you forget that?”
All of the group laughed, taunting their pockets for their wands. Harry didn't want to fight anymore after the war, but they were surely testing him.
“I...I do have more words of wisdom.” Harry broke the silence, screaming internally because he was holding hands with Draco Malfoy.
Clearly, they had something going on, but it didn’t have a name. Harry knew from the first day that he wanted to leave everything in the past and start again his story with the Malfoy, but was Draco on the same page? sometimes he would lay down next to Harry and laugh at funny clouds, or even play with Harry’s hair when he was falling asleep after a difficult match of Quidditch. All the signals could be read as something evident- but were they ready to take another step...?
Harry tried to remember. The only thing he retained for that class was how closer Malfoy was sitting from him and that he smelled really good, like lemons and something fresh.
It was the wave of shame that hits someone when they notice their crush is staring back at them, or the tension when they are sitting really close and their thighs touch with each other. When someone says something funny and that person laughs big and loudly, and the poor unfortunate soul that's in love with them can't help but wish that smile was for them and only them. Yes, that kind of nervousness.
“I just think he deserves to be happy after so much shit,” she excused herself, an apologetic smile decorating her face full of freckles. Ron frowned when he heard her say a bad word “I’m sorry, Harry.”
Harry glanced at the blond boy that was sitting alone at what used to be the Slytherin table (because now everyone could sit wherever they wanted) and thanked every spiritual being he could think of that he wasn’t looking at their table. If he did, Harry would die right there without having time to react.
“'m fine,” Harry insisted, but he let Draco wrap his arm around his waist anyways, "What about my glasses?"
Ah, yes. Harry hadn’t talked about the crush thing with his friends since the first breakfast in the Great Hall. He was sure Ginny had seen him walking with Draco one or two times, but Ron and Hermione just received the I have things to do explanation and Harry would then leave. After one week or two, it was okay, but a whole month had almost passed and they didn’t have any idea of what Harry was doing in his free time, they respected his privacy, but it was becoming weird not to see that much as they were used to.
“So you know who is Harry’s crush, Ginny?” Asked Ron, one of his hands on his chest, “I thought we were your best friends, Harry. And you told my sister first?”
He breathed, trying to come up with a summary of everything that had happened, “Remember the conversation about my crush that we had on the first day? well, I’m… making some progress with that person, okay? we have been meeting these days and It’s going really well.”
Hermione blushed, ignoring the now amused Ronald Weasley that was watching her expression with too much interest, “You were going to say something, Harry. What was it?”
His eyes tried to focus, but it was hard when his classes were nowhere to be able to reach them, “Did you get my glasses?”
Sometimes Draco would rant about how funny was the fact that the only spell Harry always used was Expelliarmus, and Harry would laugh about the fact that Draco used to come to school on a suit (that he looked very good in but Harry wasn’t going to say that out loud yet).
As Harry was walking down the hallways, he remembered the conversation he had with his friends two weeks ago. They did have some good points- he wasn't that bad. And really, everything could happen, he didn't expect Ron and Hermione to be together, but they were. He also didn't expect for Ginny to get in a relationship with Luna in the two weeks that had passed, but she did.
Hermione took her special edition of The Ministry of Magic; A guide and smacked Harry on the head with it, making a soft thump sound. He was about to complain when she shut him off with her finger.
Harry quickly put himself back together and muttered a low Thanks while picking up his wand. Draco was still standing there, watching him.
“Somebody once told me that we've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.”
The girl rolled her eyes and hit playfully one of Harry’s arms, a smirk appearing on her lips, “Oh, c’mon, do not play the fool. I can read you like an open book.”
They both started walking towards the black door that opened itself with a flick of Draco's wand. Harry felt a wave of warmth envelop him as they passed the threshold, like a welcoming hug for his shivering body. From the outside, Draco's house looked like it'd be similar to what time ago was the Malfoy manor, but on the inside, it was the total opposite. Rugs covered the dark wood floor under each piece of furniture, and despite the monochromatic (green, of course) colour scheme, it was still very home-like.
“Morning...?” Harry mumbled, looking around for a window to check if it was truly a new day, “How much time did I sleep?”
The candelabrum hanging above the living room was what reminded Harry the most of the Malfoy manor, with its expensive design and sparking metal accents. The sofa that Draco lead him was clearly expensive, too- and there was a certainly reason for its price. Harry sighed with relief when his body hit the soft cushions. It even smelled good- he sighed deeply as mil citrus scent- Draco's scent- surrounded him.
“Yes…..?” Answered Harry, not knowing if Hermione’s expression was good or bad, “I’m sorry if that bothers you, ’Mione.”
“Harry?” Hermione called his attention, it seemed like she had been speaking for the last few minutes but the boy wasn’t paying attention to her, “What’s on your mind?”
Draco staunched the bleeding with a flick of his wrist and sighed,  trying to assess the damage. How did I end up here? He asked himself for the hundredth time. Finding your Auror partner bleeding out on your driveway should be a strange sight, but it was one that Draco was all too familiar with.
And of course, when the guy noticed his friends had left him alone, he ran to the castle so fast that someone could have thought something was chasing him.
“It’s… surprising. And I'm sure is going to take Ron by surprise too when he finds out. But people can change, and if he makes you feel happy. I’m all about it.”
Harry opened his mouth to say something but he got cut off when Ron sat next to him, big dark circles under his eyes.
Harry was about to turn back and run to the Black Lake when Hermione grabbed his wrist, narrowed eyes scanning Harry, “Your crush is…. Malfoy?”
“Yeah,” agreed Ron, “you’re also an extremely caring friend and fun company to be around, I always have fun when I’m with you.”
Harry noticed the knots on his stomach one more time, but they felt more like an elephant stampede rather than butterflies, “Maybe.”
Harry was already closing his eyes, “I save my tiredness in a little box in my brain and then I set it free.”
Draco huffed and slipped an arm under Harry's back to help him sit, cringing inwardly at the blood that soaked through his robes. He just needed to get Harry inside and make sure he wasn't about to die- and then he could worry about the states of his clothes.
Draco pointed his wand at the wound, forcing his arm to stop shaking as he began muttering an incantation that made Harry wonder if Malfoy was singing to him at that moment by the tone every word was pronounced, the wand tracing the long injury slowly, it seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing, coming from some knowledge buried deep down in his memory. The flow of blood got slower and there was less, provoking a breath of relief from Draco, the spell was repeated one more time before the wound started to knit itself, making Harry flinch in discomfort for the suddenly burning sensation in the area.
“Well, hello to you too, Ginny,” he spoke, trying to redirect the attention, “I didn’t know you were having breakfast with us today.”
Draco nodded and that was enough for Harry to grab his hand, intertwining their fingers slowly. Draco squeezed softly as a response and they felt the wonderful emotion of knowing that something greater was about to come. They had found that place where they felt comfortable, where they felt like they fitted for the first time in so many years.
Draco pushed him against the tree (Harry couldn't deny he quite enjoyed that) and asked a new question, this time sounding more confused rather than surprised, “Did you mean to say that?”
Harry giggled a little, looking at his two friends. Not even a war could change who they were as people.
Draco ignored the comment and cracked his knuckles softly, his gaze noticing how messy Harry's hair got. It was cute seeing it sticking out in different positions and falling in a funny way on the man's face, “You were saying I'm good at healing?”
Harry grunted but nodded anyways, letting himself relax a little. You almost die a few times and you get all sappy he thought, brushing the thoughts away. They stayed in silence a few seconds, and Harry could sense how his heart was beating a little bit faster than usual- how was he still paranoid after what happened yesterday? It was Draco's house, both of them were there, it was safe. Yet he still could hear his heartbeat bouncing around like it was a goddamn party in his chest.
“But here I am,” Harry tried to play it off, but it was noticeable the subject was affecting him somehow, “all okay.”
Harry accepted the apologies, nodding, “Don’t worry. Just… don’t make a big deal out of this. I don’t have a chance.”
Harry kept the silence for a minute, admiring the views that Hogwarts offered. It felt like home, this school was his home- and he had to leave it after this year. Everyone felt nostalgic after spending most of your time in a place and then leaving it, but there was so much more to it. Harry lived his most life-changing experiences there, he met the people that filled his heart.
Draco nodded and they stayed in an uncomfortable silence until he yawned, gaining Harry's attention- if he slept like fourteen hours, how many did Draco?
Harry managed to see Draco's silhouette casting the spell before the guy on top of him flew and fell unconscious next to him, his friends staring at his motionless body with surprise. Draco was getting closer, and with each step he took the students acted more and more anxious, deciding at the end to run in different directions to escape from the cold gaze the boy was giving them.
“I know, but it will hurt a lot more if you keep moving. Just listen to me for once in your bloody life.”
Draco aimed his wand at the running student, but Harry stopped him by grabbing his wrist, denying softly “It's fine.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione left her books on the ground to jump a little and hug her friend, scaring him a little bit on the process, “I’m sorry for making assumptions. And I’m really proud you’re chasing what you want!...but Ginny told us she has seen you with Malfoy a lot.”
Harry tried to laugh, but he felt dizzy instead- like the world had stopped for a moment before getting back on route. His eyelids dropped, and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was the worried expression across Draco's face.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, “Well, that’s what you get after you were mean to Crookshanks last night, no help coming from me.”
When the question came off from Harry's lips Draco let out a little yep and almost jumped back in surprise, releasing the grip he had on his wand, “What...?”
Harry giggled softly, making Draco smile a little when he saw he had enough strength to do it. “Well, what was the first memory?”
Draco denied softly and sighed, maintaining the charm drained his energy sometimes, “It's okay. Stop worrying about stupid things.”
“But that doesn't make sense,” Draco was expecting answers, but he wasn't going to get anything when Harry was looking at his lips every time he talked, “You react pretty fast to attacks.”
Ron acted confused, “But you are Harry Potter! You are practically a legend! who wouldn’t like to be with you?”
“And if you were insecure,” Ginny was the last to say something, “You’re a very good boyfriend. Very pleasant kisses.”
“Harry, you’re a lot more than that. You’re amazing at Quidditch! you’re also very good at defensive spells. You’re creative, brave and a good leader.”
Draco nodded, “True, but you had the right to be. You were new to the wizarding world and everyone was expecting you to be the greatest wizard in the whole universe. That’s a lot of pressure.”
Was he waiting for something? thought Harry, Maybe this the chance I have been expecting all this time.
Harry had been fidgeting with a weird toy Ron had received from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes as a gift after he helped George with the store for a whole month, it was small and shiny and since nobody had any idea what it did, Harry got to keep it, it helped him with his nervousness. But, how could the boy who lived be nervous? After facing deathly experiences so many times?
“Harry!” Hermione called him, running to keep up his pace, “Merlin, you’re fast. Where are you going?”
“You're really funny without noticing, Potter” Draco said while viewing outside the castle, “What do you think about working outside?”
Harry felt himself blushing, but he couldn’t deny that Ginny was in fact, saying the truth. They tried to have a thing for a while and even if it did work out, they decided they were better off as friends. Soon, Ginny discovered she had a crush on Luna Lovegood and time later, Harry noticed his attraction to Draco Malfoy. Ginny’s situation was a little bit easier considering she wasn’t enemies with Luna before all the stuff that happened. People wouldn’t be too shocked to see them together or if the Ravenclaw reciprocated her feelings.
Draco arched an eyebrow, the corner of his mouth quirking up in a smile, "I noticed," he said, rolling up his sleeves, and kneeling on the ground next to the sofa, "You look like a mess."
Draco decided to get up, stretching his legs while Harry was getting ready to say whatever he was thinking about. His eyes were squinted as he searched for the memory probably already forgotten, but when the light hit his eyes Draco saw it- he remembered.
Harry let out a small nod and got up carefully, observing how his shirt was getting stained by the blood that was dripping from his face, “I have to say, this is not the first time someone broke my nose, but yes, I'm okay.”
At the end, Draco stopped trying to ignore the idea. “Fuck it,” he mumbled, closing his eyes and letting his head rest on Harry chest, hearing his heartbeat.
Draco giggled a little at Harry's fierceness, not sure how else to respond. He hugged Harry back tightly and whispered "Thank you for being my friend," before letting the other boy go.
"Yeah, I don't know how I made it stay warm, but I did. Sometimes I can make things float, and sometimes things just disappear if I get afraid, or if I don't like them. I made a sweater shrink once, before Uncle Remus came to find me. At least, I think I did. Aunt Petunia was trying to put it on me, but it was ugly, and I didn't want it. When she stopped, it barely fit her hand. She said it shrunk in the wash." He was avoiding answering the last question, and knew it, but the story was pretty good he thought.
Draco pushed aside the pile of papers on his tiny table (he'd been futilely searching for a job, yet again) and uncrumpled the ball of parchment. His brow furrowed as he read it, confused as to why someone would send him something like this. He scanned to the end, one elegant brow raising as he took in the signature, before going back to read it over properly.
"Well thank you Remus! I tried really hard to get it all, I have to always be clean at home. But sometimes I miss spots, so thanks for helping." Draco said with a genuine smile, no longer afraid of Remus, though still a tad tentative.
"You know how to make potions on your own? And one of them tastes like chocolate! That sounds so cool! You can fly on a broom already too? Wow! Maybe sometime you could help me learn?" Draco asked excitedly. "And we could make potions together sometime! I am sure we will have lots of fun together!"
"Yeah, jokes are supposed to be funny. Like... Like..." Harry  had to stop and think of a joke before he could ask it. While he was thinking, he led Draco around the store, showing him all sorts of things that made you float, or smelled bad and made a mess for a while, but were relatively easy to clean up. "I'm not good at jokes... Not yet. I'm still learning. Sorry. I'm having trouble thinking of one."
Draco jumped a little at his mother's voice, he hadn't heard her come up the stairs. He looked up at her as he answered. "I am almost done mother, just need to put my name on it." Draco turned back to his parchment, his tongue sticking out a little in concentration as he finished writing his name. "There! I am done! Can I put one of those cool sticker things on it?" Draco asked his mother excitedly.
"I'm not very good at letters yet, either." Harry confessed to his friend. "A-and if we can't write letters, then we'll still be friends. But I bet we'll be able to write letters." He was very confident, and sure that they'd be allowed to spend time together and keep in contact.
Harry meets the Weasleys! It's a brief description, as this fic is primarily a Drarry and will focus more on how they grow together. We'll eventually get into longer chapters as more characters are met and Draco and Harry grow together.
Harry looked back, fidgeting a bit, his eyes watery. He was smiling though, and happy to tell his friend what he knew. He was glad that Draco wasn't afraid of him, and that they could still be friends. He hoped they would be in the same House when they went to Hogwarts.
Draco hugged Harry and Remus back tightly and slowly broke apart from them, as he tried hastily to wipe his eyes before looking back at Ron and his Mum.
Remus didn't let Draco see his frown, watching the two boys go off to the bathroom. He sighed softly, wondering if there was something that could be done that wouldn't drastically change Draco's life the way Harry's had been. He didn't want to cause Draco pain, or Harry. He decided to put off writing the letter to the blonde's parents until after they had eaten and the boys were playing happily. He hoped they didn't get rid of it on principle because it had been written by a Werewolf, but at least he'd have tried.
Cajetan returned home, his duty complete. He re-settled on his perch, having taken the time to go hunting on his way back. Maybe his humans would get it through their heads that they belonged, now. If not, well... he'd just have to take more steps. He hoped they'd figure it out soon, though.
Draco woke up the next morning excited to hear when he could see his friend Harry again. Dobby had made breakfast by the time Draco had made his way downstairs. Draco sniffed the air happily at the smell of bacon and sat down at the table. He pulled a plate towards him as his parents talked in the kitchen. Draco ate his breakfast quietly until an owl arrived. He got excited when he saw the owl, but he knew better than to get up from the table before he was dismissed. Narcissa jumped at the sound but went to the window and let the owl in.
Harry and Draco had respectfully avoided each other since the Malfoys' trials. Harry had, of course, spoken on behalf of Draco and Narcissa. Draco, because he'd been a teen with as little choice in the matter as Harry himself. Narcissa, because she had spoken up for him when Voldemort thought him dead. He had not cared one whit about Lucius, but had argue that he receive a reduced sentencing. Having Voldemort live in your home had to have been at least partial punishment for all of them.
Ron grinned brightly at the other boys. "Yeah!" He bounded out of the house with them, laughing as Harry led them helter-skelter to the bookstore, where they had to traverse the Mighty Book Jungle to find the titles that Remus wanted. He liked that he was included in an adventure this time, completely oblivious to the awe of some people as the three of them ran through the streets; a Malfoy, a Potter, and a Weasley, playing together happily.
Harry grinned, keeping an eye on both of his friends. He was glad they were getting along, and hoped it stayed that way. He didn't like it when his friends fought. He had noticed the funny looks and whenever he could looked back until the adult looked away in shame for staring at kids. He took care of his friends. "Umm... We gotta go to the potions shop, so we can have stuff for potions next week. We're gonna make the chocolate potion I told you 'bout, and a new one." He grinned. "To Ingredient Mountain!" He ran for the apothecary.
Wow! The responses to this have been so great! Thank you, everyone! Sorry it took so long to get this chapter up. We wanted to make sure we got the next plot point across and didn't miss anything in our massive backlog of text.
I like to think that, since wixen use owls for mail, that maybe the owl species that we think have disappeared have simply been cultivated by them.
DISCLAIMER: Still don't own. Owls are neat, though. I'm taking liberties with the species, since I have no clue what they eat because we don't know a lot about them.
Harry gave a happy wriggle of excitement, settling in to read, wanting to get it done so they could go on their adventure. He was completely on board with asking Mrs. Weasley if Ron could come and study with them. He knew Remus wouldn't mind, because he knew Remus really loved teaching. He wished that Remus could be hired as a teacher, because he was really, really good at it and he deserved it, but he was also happy that Remus was his teacher, and now Draco's and maybe Ron's.
"Well I am glad you are okay, I would feel awful if I had hurt you... Do you live near here? Is that how you know the place so well? I think I would like to stick with you if you don't mind. But what are pranks?" Draco asked uncertainly, he had never heard the word before.
Draco's eyes lit up as they played together, and he looked more alive than he had when he had first bumped into Harry. His face had a smile on it and he loved watching how his and Harry's magic intertwined while playing. Neither of them could really control their magic yet but it was fun to see. Draco looked at Harry curiously when he mentioned a pet. He looked at Harry and knew he would never betray his friend especially over something as simple as a pet.
It had taken a few sessions, but Harry had finally come to terms with the damage that Vernon Dursley had done to his psyche in terms of his sexuality. The Dursley's insistence that everything be, "normal, thank you very much," had convinced him that he had needed to find a girlfriend and caused him to suppress any interest he might have had in men. Harry didn't think he was very good at being gay, but he did think that he was gay. How else did you explain sixth year?
"I don't think he'll care who your parents are, Draco. He's a nice person, and he looks at people for who they are, instead of who they came from. Or at least, that's what he says. He seems to do it, as far as I can tell. I mean, he took a freak like me in, so he's gotta be pretty awesome."
Draco nodded at Remus's comment and said. "Okay well thank you Remus!" Draco looked at the older man happily, taking in the lines on his face but even with those lines, Remus seemed genuinely happy. His parents' faces had similar lines, but mostly from frowning and glowering all the time. Remus's lines must have been caused by something different.
Harry had already picked his book, and had one for Ron as well. The redhead accepted his book, happy to sit with the other boys and read. "Yeah." Ron grinned happily. "I'd like that. For us all to be friends." He was determined now, to make Draco his friend no matter what, and to be a better friend to Harry. This was something special, he felt, and he was being allowed to share in it. It was something just for him, Harry, and Draco, and none of his brothers would be able to say they had it. He just knew they would all be best friends. He could feel it.
Draco smiled happily at Harry and Remus, glad to see that they were indeed truthful to their word. They had said to him that he was welcome at any time, and here they were saying the exact same things to his mother. Clearly Remus wasn't super comfortable around the woman, but he was fighting for Draco and Harry to remain friends. This gave Draco hope. He looked up at his mother, happiness radiating from him as well as hope.
Draco stared at Ron as he talked, curious about some of the things he said. "Where would you have the party if not at your place? But if you are sure that you won't get into trouble, then I would love it if you asked your Mum if I could go to your party! But I am still not sure if mother will let me go. But a formal invitation might help her agree. I don't know if you were planning on sending out invitations but if you can get me one that would be great.”
"When? How?" Remus said as he looked at Severus's back.   Without missing a beat the potions master spoke. "The how is self explanatory. Seven months. I am merely a carrier like many wizards." Snape said as he worked.  Feeling that was his cue to leave Remus pulled himself away from Severus.   Walking up the stairs past Mrs. black Remus sighed as he walked into the room he had shared with his boyfriend Sirius months prior to his death.  walking over to the dresser, he began searching for something anything to take his mind of the fact he might be mated to the potions master.   Finding nothing in the drawers as he looked until he came to the last one in the left corner. It was locked. "Alohomora," Remus said but the drawer didn't move.   Sighing he tried a few more spells before remembering the favorite spell of all the Marauder's.  The drawer opened to reveal a pentsive.
Many years later Severus hang on the wall in the headmasters office.  the picture of him wearing the same pissed look. until a girl walked in.   "Mr. Snape?" She asked softly as Severus cleared his throat.    this girl standing there had Hermione's eyes, and Severus nose.  "Can i help you?" Severus asked as the head master walked in.   "I see you had to find him Miss Snape.  That is Severus Tobias Snape or your great grandfather." said the professor as Severus just smiled.  watching the girl leave.   The real Severus Snape held hermione granger in his arms tightly.   "we did ok, they will be ok I hear this potions master is nicer." He drawled in the same voice that used to piss of Hermione.
carefully picking up the bowl Remus knew this had to contain Sirius's memories. Something he wished to keep secret or maybe something he wished to no longer hold on to.
Draco Malfoy always suffered in silence its what he was taught to do. That is until a boy with a lighting scar shows him he doesn't have too.
"I thought you were..." Draco said hugging his husband tightly.  "don't do that to me again," he whispered into Harrys neck holding him tightly.  " Draco Malfoy potter I'm not going anywhere and it will take a lot more to get rid of me." harry said kissing the blond hair wizard once again and thanking Hermione for taking care of his husband.
The room, was cold and dark, a few wood creates in the corner.  Severus sighed locking the door behind him as he swore he would never allow this to happen again yet here he was. Slowly he walked over making himself at home with the creates and trying to ease the pain.   Severus watched in horror as Remus changed hearing him scream even thought most of the time there was no sound produced still hurt.   The wolf now sat peacefully several feet away from Severus.  He wouldn't say it out loud but he was grateful.
The witch Severus had grown to love laid her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes.  "You will be ok, The kids will be home in a few months and you can turn in to Molly as you cook and make Christmas feel like Christmas." Severus said kissing her head.    As the doctor called Hermione's name, she stood leaving her husband behind her.   The wait was killing the potions master, he had began pacing about ten minutes ago.  Hermione still wasn't back, what could be talking so long?
“Just take it, then we can snuggle or do whatever you want.” Draco pleaded trying another tactic.  “If it tastes bad you can chase it with juice, or butter beer if you want... please love,” he whispered his hand resting on her forehead feeling the sweat forming on her forehead.
Draco tried again, trying to not to lose his cool with the stubborn witch.   “Please, my love. Please Hermione I am begging you. Please take it. It will break the fever. It will help you feel better.” He pleaded again getting now where.
Even as a potions master there are certain illness they cant cure.   Cancer seeming to be one of them
"come on in Severus," Remus said showing him to a room down the hall from his own.  walking past Mrs. Black was something he had heard before so he didn't even turn to look as he tried to brush off the panic bubbling up inside him.   As Severus put his things away, walking slowly back down the steps with his hand cradling his seventh month pregnant belly as he sighed.    "So, have you been taking the potion? What are your symptoms and be honest with me Remus for this to work."  The potions master asked as he took out the journal to record his information for Dumbledore.   "Been feeling like hell, I don't sleep, cant get warm." Remus said as he watched Severus scribbling away.    The older man sighed knowing he had made the potion that meant he would have to watch the transformation.     "Where do you usually transform?" Snape asked as it was nearly night fall.   Remus got slowly to his feet sensing somewhere within him that quick movements would scare the man.   Walking behind the wolf several paces he followed him down to the cellar.
After many minutes of begging and Severus finally pulling out the professor voice when Hermione thought she was missing classes.  She finally took as Draco took Hermione to the healer.    Only to find out Hermione had the flu on top of being in the early stages of pregnancy.  The next few days were horrible for Draco.  It was like hearing hermione screaming over and over again as she begged for him to stop the pain.  He was helpless, but as least he knew Hermione would get better.
His arm wrapped around his belly.  Severus groaned sharply holding Remus's hand in his own.  Remus gasped feeling the other man's stomach tighten.  He wasn't a doctor, not even a nurse but he knew contractions when he saw them. Severus seemed relatively unbothered when it passed.   "Just my body preparing." He whispered sensing the panic in Remus touch. When he finally did open his eyes he wasn't surprised to the see Remus's face mere inches from his as he leaned up closing the gap.  The kiss was soft and sweet and about all Severus was willing to let him do.  Remus could work with that as he hand rested on the other mans stomach.
three years, with the family and grand babies, even tough her body fought to kill her Hermione granger fought against that.
"Harry let your father sleep, go play with your cousins," Hermione's scolding voice came as Draco set up. Shaking his head he ha tried to piece together the last few years. As Draco got out of bed smiling softly as a small boy who looked just like harry played with Ron's son.   "Harry went for breakfast he will be back," Hermione said as she looked at Draco. seeing the mark out of the corner of her eye. sighing she got to work patching him up.  Of course getting him to sit still didn't work to well when harry had picked that moment to walk back in to the burrow.
“Bad for the baby...” she whispered softly.  Those four words insuring panic in the youngest Malfoy.  He stood up in a hast doing the only thing he could thing as he grabbed his wand casting his patronus.  Snape had to be able to help, hell it was his job.   Sure Draco and Hermione were adults but this didn’t make it any less scary.  As far as Draco was concerned pregnant women were not supposed to have a fever and chills.  Snape let out a heavy sigh but went to Draco’s aid anyway.   “It’s Hermione! It’s bad! She is burning up and won’t take anything keeps saying it bad for the baby. You have to help.” Draco said panicking.   “Breathe,” Severus said as he walked in the bedroom needing to see if it was true. Draco did tend to over exaggerate things.  As Severus walked in he was met with Hermione curled up in bed shivering. Begging for Draco.  “I can break the fever but she needs a real healer something could be wrong,” Severus said as he made up a potion quickly. The hard part was getting Hermione to take it.
Draco laid there watching his wife sleep peacefully before his lips landed on the old scar. “I’m so sorry,” he whispered kissing it again. Doing the same as she would when his mark seemed to cause him pain. All Draco could do was watching in horror as he held her arm. The guilty eating him alive. Hermione stirred a little confused. “What’s wrong?” She whispered wiping away the tears as she took a deep breath. Starting to sing the wizards favorite song. Draco smiled kissing the mark. “I forgive you, do you hear me Draco Malfoy I forgive you.” She whispered softly kissing him as she placed his hand on her baby bump. “Listen to me, and listen to me good. I love you, I love you. All of you even that mark. Even that stupid way you call out my maiden name when your mad. I love you so much. The Malfoy line will continue, and your son will know how much his mother loves his father. You don’t get to get out of this easy. Now go to sleep you have work in the morning. Make Severus proud,” Hermione whispered running her hand through Draco’s blonde hair. Draco nodded holding his wife to him as he slept. Dreaming of the night she got the scar. Hearing her screaming as she begged for him, pleaded for Draco to make it stop. He woke early the next morning with no intention of going to work. Instead today Malfoy had planned to make Mrs. Malfoy’s morning the best morning yet.
Years after the war. Years after the incident that left Hermione with a Mudblood scar draco finds himself still feeling guilty. How does he make it up?
The pain in her chest, and armpit was something Hermione thought potions should cure.   The fatigue, difficulty breathing, and the lump under her arm seemed to be things potions cant cure.    Much to Severus dismay Hermione had dragged him out to a muggle doctor with her.   As Severus looked around the pale white room, sat in the uncomfortable chair.
Remus looked in Severus room finding him sitting in a chair by the fire reading.  "I am sorry, Severus for what he did to you," Remus whispered as he looked at the back of the potions master's head. "What you weren't in on that prank too?" came Severus's snide remark.  "Severus he.... he raped you." Remus whispered.  "I know that wolf! Every day I am reminded of it!" Severus yelled as he got up crossing the room to Remus.  It was nearly nightfall and Severus still had to watch the transformation. Removing the glamor and letting his belly be free he watched Remus transform again.  Feeling calm when around the wolf.  Softly patting his head the wolf laid its head on Severus's leg.
Harry grinned a bit, extremely happy that Draco had hugged him back. He was sure they were going to be best friends, and that he'd chosen very well. He could tell Draco had liked the hug, and was glad. He would definitely have to give as many of them as he could to the blonde. No one should ever not know how to react to a hug.
Turns out Harry's pet was a snake. It was indeed a pretty snake and it wasn't super long so Draco didn't feel scared of it. Not sure if he should approach it or not though, Draco just stared at Harry and his pet for a minute. Harry was clearly comfortable with the snake and it seemed friendly enough.
He fell asleep writing his letter, head slumped to one side of it, and Remus had to put him to bed. There, he snuggled his Wofly, dreaming about all the fun he would have with his best friend, and all the adventures they would have together.
Harry was a royal mess by the time dinner was done, but beaming brightly. He tolerated Remus helping him clean his face and hands, and the adult in the room didn't seem to be upset that he was messy at all. It didn't exactly help that Harry had played with half of the last piece of lasagna instead of eating it, but he was still going through a phase where he was exploring textures that he had missed when he was smaller.
Harry hugged his friend tighter at the confession. "I wish you could live with me and Remus." His words were a soft whisper just for Draco's ears. They held each other, drawing comfort. Remus hugged them both, having heard because of his superior hearing but not letting on.
So Harry had dutifully gone out and scoured all of the magical menageries that he knew of. He'd learned of a few more, for sure, since he'd come to the wizarding world. At first, his friends had forced him out, with him dragging his heels over the task. They pushed, and he dug in. Slowly but surely, however, he began to enjoy going out simply for the sake of going out. He even started to look forward to seeing owls, if only to visit them and have them not look at him shiftily. Okay... so maybe the Owl Post people were not entirely happy with him, and the owls knew it.
Draco wiggled happily in his chair, excited to help Remus write a shopping list. He wiggled a lot more when he was Remus's place because he was happy, and he knew he could be himself without getting into trouble. So Draco had fun and played and let himself move when he wanted to instead of trying to be as still as possible at all times. Draco waited happily by the parchment and quill, excited to practice his letters while also helping Remus.
During some hurried holiday shopping within Diagon Alley Draco gets separated from the unobservant and uncaring Narcissa Malfoy. He runs into a dark haired boy, that seems to be the same age of him and really nice. Draco swears he has seen him somewhere before...
"I thought it was a good way, too.” Harry said, changing the subject back to pranks. “It didn't hurt him, just made him angry at first and made him look silly for a long while." He smiled, cheering up again. "Uncle Remus said he'd accept any friends I made. So he'd better accept you. C'mon, my house is this way." He tugged Draco along to the turn off, and then down the back-alley to their apartment. It wasn't fancy, but it was liveable and everything worked. That's all Harry cared about.
Once outside the door, Narcissa walked to the Leaky Cauldron, pulling Draco along behind her roughly. "Well I am glad that you were well taken care of Draco. Sorry I didn't come get you sooner. Mother was....busy. But I got some of your Christmas presents bought, so that's nice right?" Narcissa asked as they stood near the fireplace in the Leaky Cauldron.
Harry loved Cajetan quite a bit. It wasn't the same love as he'd shared with Hedwig, but he was pretty sure that Cajetan loved him back. The bird went out of his way to be affectionate to Harry, and Harry had wholeheartedly returned it. He thought perhaps he had space in his heart for two owls. Plus, no one would expect a bird that behaved like Cajetan to belong to their 'Savior.'
Draco waited for his mother to leave his room before he celebrated. He jumped up and did a happy dance around the room, hugging some of his favorite toys and dancing with them as he did so. He was excited that Harry had written to him so soon and he hoped that Harry could read his reply.
"Yes why don't we talk about sleepovers and such another time boys. Let's see how these next few weeks of lessons go and then we can discuss sleepovers in further detail. As for your party Ronald, we will have to see about locations after I talk to your father, okay? I am not saying no, I just don't know what the Ice Cream Parlor will cost. As for a drop off time, if you are up that early Remus, and if Mrs. Malfoy is the only one who comes by, perhaps Arthur could bring Ron by on his way to work? I will talk to him and see how he feels about that. But for now I do think we have to get going Ron, before your siblings tear up the house." Molly said kindly, smiling at the boys.
"Oooh!! Maybe we could all have sleepovers sometime too! Harry and I are supposed to have sleepovers at some point...maybe you could join us! Oooh maybe your birthday could be a sleepover day!!" Draco said practically bursting with excitement.
"Maybe we could spend time together again soon though? And then the letters won't be so necessary?" Draco looked at Harry, eyes hopeful, and he turned to Remus with that same hope as the man entered Harry's room. Draco looked at Remus and whispered; "What if my parents won't help me write the letters? Will we have to stop being friends?" Draco felt tears in his eyes and so he squeezed them shut tight. His parents hated it when he cried.
Draco murmured sleepily and woke up easily, getting out of bed quickly so as to not get yelled at. He knew better than to dawdle when getting out of bed. Draco got dressed hurriedly, full of excitement to be spending the day with Harry, but also to be getting out of the Manor. It was such a lonely place to spend the day by himself. Draco packed his favorite kitty plushie, and a few of his other favorite toys, most of them animals or miniature Quidditch gear toys. Then Draco grabbed the bag and headed downstairs to get to the kitchen. He could smell the bacon and pancakes and his mouth started to water. Dobby placed a plate on the table as Draco sat down and he started to eat.
Narcissa got the letter as she was getting ready to head for bed. She read through it and decided she would respond in the morning when she dropped off Draco. Lucius came home and agreed that the politics should be left open ended, and threatened to go to Lupin's house if it ever seemed that Draco was being force-fed Lupin's ideas. Narcissa got him to calm down a bit by saying she could get lesson plans to read over beforehand. Lucius deemed this to be enough but also told Narcissa it would be her job to monitor their lessons then. Narcissa agreed without really thinking about it, and then promptly decided a quick lookover would suffice. These lessons didn't need to take over her life too.
Remus followed after the boys, and sat to gather them both into his lap. "I'm not mad, Draco. I know you're excited. And you didn't give away any secrets, you were very excited, but you also were careful. That's a very good skill. I didn't say we'd talk about sleepovers because I don't want you to have them, I said it because we do need to talk and plan for it. We need to make sure it will be alright. And I more than think you can be friends with Ron. I think you already are, and he's not about to let you stop being his friend."
Remus nodded to Narcissa. "It was a pleasure to have Draco visit. He's welcome anytime, with some forewarning. An owl should be plenty adequate to contact me." Remus answered her before she left.  Harry chirped out a pleasant "You're welcome!" before Narcissa had left. Once she had, both Werewolves looked at each other, then burst out laughing.
Harry helped Draco get cleaned up, and then took him to the kitchen. It was much smaller, and they didn't have a house elf at all it seemed like, but there was a lot of food and it smelled good.  Harry tugged an extra chair to the table for Draco to sit, and got out a plate and silverware for him. "Uncle Remus made lasagna tonight. I love his lasagna. It's really, really good." He made sure Draco had a cup, then climbed into his own seat, bouncing in it a bit.
Sure, Harry had been right about Malfoy being up to something as well. But that didn't mean he'd had to stalk the boy (man now) for the whole year. Maybe if he'd spent less time stalking Malfoy, he might have actually stood a chance of helping him sooner. He'd done his best to make up for it, though. He'd spoken up at the Malfoys' trials, doing his best to reduce their sentencing.
"Of course I forgive you Remus, you didn't mean to make me feel bad. It's really not you that makes me feel bad...it's my parents. I feel like because of them...I am automatically considered mean and bad and it makes me sad. I want to be friends with Harry, and Ron, and I think I can be a good friend to them, I really do. But I don't want to get them in trouble, or make Ron's parents mad at him because my parents are mean. But I don't like the idea of my parents yelling at Ron's parents either, so you can definitely make sure that mother doesn't see Ron's parents... I just want to be friends with everyone and go to Ron's party and feel safe." Draco said somewhat quietly as Remus hugged him, though his voice got louder as he talked about how hurt he felt.
Draco saw his mother waiting and her foot was tapping, showing her impatience. She listened to Remus talk about the boys with only a small amount of interest. "I am not sure my Draco knows how to write and read well enough to send letters but I am sure he will be able to learn soon enough. Thank you for watching Draco today, I am glad you were home when we got separated. He seems to have had a good day so maybe at some point the boys could do this again. I will talk it over with Lucius when I get home. I am usually busy during the days and so is my husband so Draco spends most of his days at home. Maybe this way he can get out more and interact with people his age. We will have to see."
Remus smiled at Draco. "You don't have to call me sir. Remus is just fine." He served himself and Harry, then sat down to eat, wondering if Draco thought he had to call all adult figures in his life 'sir'. He hoped that Harry would help him get past that.
Draco Malfoy sat in his room in a tiny flat off of Diagon Alley. He hadn't been able to stomach staying in the Manor for longer than he had to. It was too full of memories of the Dark Lord and the mistakes and stains on his family name. He wasn't really expecting any mail. Hardly anyone wrote to him. Occasionally Potter would write, checking in on him and his family.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand, listening to Uncle Remus talk to his friend. He had just known that Remus wouldn't be upset with his choice, and was glad that Draco could hear him say it. He was going to write to Draco lots when the blonde went back home, so that Draco would know he was thinking about him. He would make sure to learn Draco's birthday, too, and send him a present for it. Nothing in the world was going to stop Harry Potter from being Draco Malfoy's friend now!
Harry started speaking again, this time telling his new friend more about himself. "Uncle Remus isn't actually my uncle. He was best friends with my mum and dad when they were in school. Even though he gets sick a lot, they were really nice to him, and didn't shun him like a lot of people do when they find out. I get sick, sometimes, too. That's why he's taking care of me, we have the same thing. But don't worry, I won't get you sick by touching. Uncle Remus says it's to do with DNA, whatever that is. I don't mind you staying with me at all. I bet Uncle Remus won't mind either. Even if she's mad, at least you'll be safe. She can be happy about that."
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry watching him and he felt empowered by that. Harry being nearby gave him hope as usual, and so Draco was able to put a smile back on his face and look around them, prepared to go to Ingredient Mountain, feeling hopeful again.
Draco finished speaking and bowed his head. He continued subconsciously rubbing his wrists and lower arms as he looked around for his mother. Not finding her, he looked back up at Harry, grateful to have someone to talk to.
Harry cheered along with his friends and dashed for Ingredient Mountain. After that, it would be the Ice Cream Palace and a mad dash home to make sure nothing melted, even though he knew that Mr. Florian would charm it to stay frozen until they got it in the freezer.
Also, keep an eye out for satellite stories that will either fill in plot holes or provide some neat background information for events that are mentioned, but don't change the main narrative.
"Good night, Cajetan. Enjoy your hunting." Harry waved to his owl as he headed to his bedroom. He did feel a bit better, having written that letter for his assignment. He'd have to let his Mind Healer know. And write another one soon.
He waited impatiently for his friend to write, or to hear from Draco's parents. He wanted very badly to be able to spend as much time as possible with his best friend, and hoped that his parents would not be awful about it. Aunt Petunia would have been, but he hoped that maybe they weren't as much like her as Draco's mum had seemed.
Narcissa had put Draco to bed by the time the letter came in, merely a quick good night story, and then she shut Draco's bedroom door. He had a small, snake shaped magical light that turned on as the door shut. Draco heard his mother's footsteps get farther away and whimpered a little bit to himself and snuggled his cat stuffed animal close. His kitty made him feel safe even during the darkness and loneliness of his room. Draco rolled about in bed for a while, sad because he was alone and had wanted a hug-and partially because he was excited to see Harry again. Eventually though, Draco managed to get comfortable enough, wrapped up in his blankets to fall asleep. His warm blankets and plushie helped him to feel safe enough to sleep. Draco had fun filled dreams about playing with Harry and all the fun shenanigans they could get up to.
The snake itself appeared to be some kind of magical hybrid, though neither of the boys would understand that yet. It had markings like a python, but was built like a venomous snake and had a small hood. Harry adored it, and did his best to take care of it. He looked at Draco hopefully. "It won't bite, I promise."
Harry got the snake settled and closed his window, going to hug Draco. "I'll write you a letter about how I talk to my wolf, okay? You can write me back. Friends do that, yeah?" He hugged his friend tight, not wanting to let go of him, but knowing that he couldn't keep him there. Not yet, at least. But maybe someday, he could.
Harry grinned brightly, his eyes sparkling. They gathered the books and had the shopkeep ship them to Remus, then they headed off to the next place. They had to get some groceries, and Harry was happy to lead them off to the Lands of Abundance. He was excited, because the last item on the list was a stop to bring home as much ice cream as they could afford after everything else.
Draco hugged Harry back just as tightly, not wanting to leave his new found friend. He also wasn't excited to be going back to his house where it was cold and dreary and no one really talked to him.
Draco looked down at Harry on the floor amidst his toys. Harry was clearly inviting Draco to play with him on the floor. Draco shook himself to get rid of his bad feelings and sat down next to Draco. He grabbed the nearest toy and started to play with Harry. Enjoying the feeling of having a friend to play with, and excited to play with Harry for as long as he could. At this point he hoped his parents didn't come until really late because Harry was his friend and he just wanted to play with him.
Harry giggled with them, and accepted the money and the list. He looked at the list. "Lets get all the things that don't get bad first! So we need... some new books!" He struck a dramatic pose. "Let's go, adventurers!"
Remus read over Narcissa's letter before handing Harry his, considering how to reply. He was pleased that Draco had been able to write back, and pleased to know that the little blonde would be permitted to visit Harry. He had hoped so, and was glad he didn't have to disappoint his pup. He shooed Harry up to his room to answer Draco while he wrote a reply to the boy's mother.
Harry grinned back at Draco. "Its scales are very soft, aren't they? It keeps the rats out of the house. I hope Uncle Remus will let me keep it inside soon. He said maybe when I turn six, I can have a pet, and that's less than a year away. I made a branch on the tree in the yard stay warm for it, though, so it has a safe warm place. Snakes need warm places." He was excited to tell Draco all he knew about snakes.
Draco looked up at his mother and said. "Oh well thank you Mother for thinking of me. But I think for the rest of my gifts this year, I would like to just be able to spend time with Harry. It's nice to have a friend to play with! I would also like to maybe get him a gift or two? I think that would be nice. Would that be ok Mother?" Draco asked hopefully.
Harry grinned brightly, plopping himself near both of them. "Remus says, since Ron is visiting, we don't have to do any lessons but the reading ones. And they're really short. He sent a note to your mum, Draco, explaining why. So after we've read, we can all go on an adventure." He liked that they were getting along, and thought maybe Draco could be good for Ron too. He hoped so.
After the war, one thing that everyone could agree on was that Harry Potter definitely needed a new owl. Well, everyone but Harry Potter, of course. He was still mourning the loss of his beloved Hedwig. She had been a grand owl- everyone agreed on that- but she was gone and Harry definitely couldn't keep using the Owl Post owls forever. For one thing, he inevitably got mobbed whenever he went out to send mail. For another, if another owl came back injured he was definitely going to have to pay a fine. Being a hero only went so far.
Draco stared at his friend, trying to show his compassion and caring as he listened. He didn't want to make Harry feel bad at all, but he was curious about what werewolves were exactly. He hadn't really ever heard the term before.
"Oooh potions! I am super excited to make potions with you and Remus! That sounds like it will be super fun. Maybe your Mom will let you come learn with us more often Ron? And you can do potions with us! We won't blow them up, at least not on purpose and I am sure that Remus won't let us make anything dangerous at this point either. We are too young for that. But I am excited for you to help us find things at Ingredient Mountain! And then ice cream after, for sure! Remus always lets us get ice cream which makes me happy because I don't ever get ice cream at home. We don't really do parties or well fun at my house..." Draco tapered off, looking down at his feet.
Narcissa spent most of her time socializing and playing the dutiful wife about town, while neglecting her motherly duties at home. Lucius, the man Draco knew only as Father, worked long hours all day, and when he came home he was generally grumpy. He yelled often and sometimes took out his frustrations on his family. Though Dobby took the brunt of his anger, Draco's Mother had also been targeted at times. Draco longed for the hugs he saw kids in the streets get from their parents.
Harry was utterly baffled the next morning when he came in to check on his post, and found that the crumpled up ball of paper that had been his healing assignment was nowhere to be found.
Harry nodded to Draco, eyes bright. "I'll write you really soon!" He held in his desire to dance, sensing that his friend's mother would not appreciate it.
Around this time, an owl found Narcissa, as she left her favorite witch beauty supplies shop. Narcissa was startled out of her shopping fervor, and nearly dropped some of her bags. She cursed at the bird but still bent down and grabbed the scroll it was carrying. She read it, and cursed again. She knew something had been missing but she had just gone about her day as if she was supposed to be alone in Diagon Alley that day. Apparently Draco had somehow managed to run into none other than little Harry Potter. And now she had to go to the house of a werewolf to pick him up. That was just great. Narcissa finished her shopping, apparated home to drop everything off, and then went back to Diagon Alley. She followed the instructions in the letter, and found the apartment easily. She sat outside for a little bit, unsure how best to succeed. But then sighed and knocked on the door.
Thanks for sticking around for the first chapter! Sorry it's so short. This is just Harry's Introduction. The chapter lengths will likely vary quite a bit, as I'll cut them wherever we feel is appropriate as we edit. We're editing together, to minimize mistakes.
"So today is just a day of fun and play? That sounds awesome! Oooh I wonder what stories we will have today? They are short but I like them, do you like to read Ron? Ooooh! Maybe we could work writing into our adventure as well?" Draco said, and then realized he might sound like someone who liked learning too much so he tried to settle down. But ended up dancing in place instead.
"Sure! I would love to see your pet. What kind of pet is it?" Draco asked curiously but quietly. He had never had a pet before and his dad just had those weird birds outside the manor…
Ron broke away to hug Draco when he looked sad. "It's okay. I'm still gonna be your friend. You're nice, and I had fun."
Draco nodded happily and then went back to his book. He knew his mother was on her way out and he didn't want her to feel like he was holding her up by talking. Narcissa nodded at her son again and left the room. She called out to Dobby and instructed him to make whatever Draco wanted for lunch, and then she left the Manor.
"So I have some news to relate to you Lucius. I may have gotten separated from Draco today in Diagon Alley. Apparently during this time he literally ran into Harry Potter. That's right THE Harry Potter. Harry is staying with Remus Lupin now, so he is inside the magical world once more. Anyways, Draco and Harry seem to have become best friends during their afternoon together. Remus assured me that Draco had been on his best behavior and that the boys had a great time today. So Draco wants to go back to visit Harry and Remus. I just wanted to see what you think about it." Narcissa informed her husband.
After a little while Draco settled down a bit, the excitement of writing to Harry had passed. Now he realized that he was still in his room in this big empty house alone. He sat on his bed and snuggled his favorite white cat plushie to hold back his tears. His mother would leave soon and maybe then he could cry about being alone. But he didn't dare cry for real with her still in the Manor. If she heard him there was a good chance she would ban him from Harry's place until he got used to being alone. Draco didn't think he could handle that so he squished his kitten plushie hard and stroked its soft fur.
"Thank you for forgiving me, Draco. No one will stop you from being friends with Ron and Harry. We'll do everything we can to make the party safe and happy for everyone, I promise."
"I am going to do that then. I will make it so that no one will think I am like my parents. I will be the nicest person ever! I can't change the way I look but I can be kind, and hopefully that will be enough." Draco said as he stood up, unable to stay sitting in his excitement. As he finished speaking Draco punched his fist into the air, to show his determination. He would do it, no matter what his parents thought or did, he would be kind and good.
Ginny didn't want to work through her trauma yet. She wanted to leave it behind. Harry hadn't agreed with that, though he did see that it was her choice. That had been another sticking point between them. Harry wanted to deal with his pain, and learn how to be himself. Ginny wanted him to bask in his fame and run away from the past with her. They just had been fundamentally wrong.
He looked down at the ground for a moment before answering the last question. "I... Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon always called me that. Uncle Remus says they're wrong, and I'm still working on believing it." He looked back up again, breathing deeply and accepting Draco's hand. He squeezed the other boy's hand gently.
Ron grinned. "Yeah! The best! And you're welcome, Draco." He had had the best day he could remember in a long time, and he was looking forward to spending more days like this. He helped Remus put things away, then sat to eat his ice cream with Harry and Draco, chattering away with them about their adventure.
"I'm sure!" Harry beamed brightly and returned the hug. He liked hugs a lot, and he had a feeling that getting hugs from Draco would be something extra special.
A tap on his window drew Draco out of his thoughts, and he looked up to see an owl at his window. He didn't recognize it, but he got up and let it in anyway. The owl hooted at him, butting his hand with its head like a cat before holding out what was clearly a crumpled piece of parchment. Draco took it with bemusement.
"Oh, ok, if you are sure...Draco said in response to the gift. Then, completely surprising himself, Draco gave Harry a hug in thanks and well appreciation. He had never felt so wanted before, and he was grateful to Harry for it.
Meowfoy's Disclaimer: I also do not own any Harry Potter characters, they are property of J. K. Rowling, I just love to play with them. Especially with Draco!
"Uncle Remus says I'm only supposed to do the potions in this book, until I'm bigger. He says these ones are safe and can't hurt me." Harry tapped the book gently. "Maybe we can make the one that tastes like chocolate sometime. I'm out of all the imgridanents, but Remus said he'll get more for me." He wriggled excitedly. "Yah! I can help you learn. It'll be awesome. Uncle Remus sometimes takes me to a place he knows, and I can fly out there!" He beamed brightly.
"I always do my best to have lots of fun with Harry because it's nice to be around friends...and honestly other people. I am glad you are here with us today Ron, you are a good friend too, and I think having you here has added to our fun. And I would like to come to your birthday...but I don't know if mother will let me, and well most people don't like my family so your Mum may not want me either...and I don't want to get you in trouble, especially not on your birthday..." Draco finished speaking looking at the ground again. He was rather ashamed of his family, even though he couldn't quite figure out why, except that they weren't really nice or friendly.
Draco looked between Remus and Harry, trying to make sure that they were indeed being serious, before speaking.
Harry was really nervous about telling Draco his big secret. Remus had told him not to tell people, but he wanted Draco to be his best friend, and Remus said you didn't hide things from best friends, too. He took a deep breath, hearing the trust and the smile in Draco's voice.
Ginny nodded furiously with the brightest grin on her face, while Hermione and Ron just seemed surprised, of course, they were acting. They were trying to make their friend feel more comfortable, but it was crystal clear they believed it before Harry said it was the truth.
“Be more careful next time, Potter,” he said, not as harsh as Harry expected the answer to sound, it actually sounded gentle “also, your wand fell.”
“I hate Potions. I hate Potions so much that if I could go back in time to kill whoever invented the subject- I would, no doubts.”
“I thought after saving the whole Wizarding World you'll be smarter, Potter. He's a Death-Eater, remember?”
“I'm really sorry...Draco,” Harry tried to sit correctly, groaning when he felt a pull to the side due to the wound, “Can I see it?”
My partner. Draco was thankful that the streetlights were dim enough that this blush was hidden. "Luckily, it seems like no one saw anything," Draco changed the subject, "so if you could get up-" Draco cut himself off as he got a better look at Harry's face. "Is that a black eye?".
“Go to your date before I hex you,” she elbowed him playfully, “and tell….Draco, that I’m sorry for punching him a few years ago. But he deserved it.”
And then Dracos free hand was grabbing Harry's face by his cheek, his other wand pointing at his nose, “Episkey,” the blood stopped dripping.
Hermione (who had been looking at Harry since he started to act more and more nervous) hit the table gently, drawing the attention to her, “Harry, if you do. You don’t have to tell us who it is, but…” she laughed softly, “remember you are a terrible liar.”
“Potter…” Draco tried to convince him subtly to change the subject, but Harry was a stubborn bastard and he was about to start complaining again if Draco didn't tell him, “Yes, it did. Only one though, It wasn't healed fast enough I'm guessing..”
Harry wanted to slam his head against the table since the topic had arrived in the conversation, “I don’t have a crush,” he assured, “And if I did I wouldn’t tell Ginny.”
“Well, it has to be since,” she spoke in her most reprimanding tone possible, “I was talking to you about this assignment we have to do in Defense Against the Dark Arts. and it’s very important.”
Draco released the air he was holding and arched an eyebrow to the guy laying on the ground, falling on his back probably hurt, but he didn't care to be honest, “What an asshole.”
“I hope you don’t… blame yourself for everything that happened, Draco. Because I don’t blame you. You were a child, you just were trying to do what was best for your family and your pride. And I did the same.”
Harry stopped walking, his hands shyly gestured to Hermione to stop too, she did, a confused expression standing out on her face.
The guy woke up disoriented and unstable, falling to his knees when he tried to get up. His eyes followed Harry's face and then Draco's, both of them watching him with unreadable expressions, but definitely not friendly ones.
Well, the good thing was that he did faint once, so it wasn't that probable for him to do it again. And seeing how the wound was already recovering thanks to what seemed like Draco healing abilities, Harry's spirits lifted up, it looked so much better and it also didn't hurt half as much. It was a really well-done work.
When Harry finally reached the spot where Draco was supposed to be waiting for him,  it caught him by surprise the fact he wasn't. Instead, some students were laughing under the tree, throwing rocks at the Lake.
“I have a lot of wards to keep things warm,” Draco explained, slowly guiding Harry to the sofa, "mostly for when winter comes around since I'm generally a pretty cold person.
After she spoke, no one else said something. Harry just wished that the earth could swallow him so he could escape the conversation, but just standing up and leaving the Great Hall when it was at its fullest looked too suspicious, and the thing he wanted to evade the most was people staring at him.
Harry tried to shrug, wincing from the movement and biting back a whimper, "I was just checking on you."
“Merlin's beard,” Draco eyes got wide, “You were a child, Harry, of course it stuck with you.  And who in their right mind makes a seven year old cook?”
Draco searched for Harry's glasses and handed them over to him, they were shining clean and looked more new than ever, “I fixed and cleaned them. They probably broke when one of the … assholes yesterday hit you.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. Did Harry have any survival instincts? He'd survived dozens of harrowing situations- both during and after Hogwarts- and yet here he was, bleeding and bruised on Draco's driveway. If Harry always acted like this when his life was at stake... it was a wonder what he hadn't been killed yet.
Harry was quivering with excitement, and he subtly squeezed Draco's hand. He waited for the grown ups to stop talking, so that he and Draco could run off and play. Remus always let him play after breakfast, at least for a little, so that he wasn't as distracted from learning. He was sure that wouldn't change with Draco there.
"Oooh! I think a three person adventure would be awesome! I am sure we could go on a fun new adventure sometime today if Remus is okay with it that is." Draco said with a smile on his face.
He nodded, listening intently when Draco talked about his cat he cuddled. "I hope she's not too mad at you for getting lost. I'll be sad if she is. I hope she doesn't get mad at me for helping you, and being your friend."
Draco's face fell a little at the mention of his mother, clearly worried that it would make her mad. And well nothing brought Draco's mood down faster than remembering his mother and how she didn't seem to like being a mother. Draco shook himself to clear out the bad thoughts, and put a smile back on his face.
He hoped that Draco would write back soon, though he knew that it was probably silly to expect a reply immediately. He hoped Draco could visit soon, too. It would be so much fun! And he could take Draco to meet the Weasleys, maybe, and then if they got caught up in their own games again, he would have someone to play with too! Harry knew that the Weasleys didn't mean to leave him out of their games and things, but it still hurt when they did it. They just weren't used to playing with him yet, even though they were really nice and friendly.
Later that day, he met the rest of the Weasleys, and he and Remus went and had dinner at their house. Harry loved the Burrow. It smelled of safety, love, and home. He had always wished to find a place like that, but he had never expected to. Now, he had, and he was awed by it. Remus said they'd visit a lot, since Harry seemed to fit right into the madness that was the Weasleys.
While his two friends talked, Harry got everything they needed, and had those sent to Remus as well, bouncing a bit. "Now, off to the Ice Cream Palace!" He zipped out, laughing, causing his two friends to have to tear after him, heading straight for Florian's. There had been some unexpected deals today, so they had a lot of money to bring home ice cream!
Sensing Draco’s distress, Ron grabbed the blonde's hand and squeezed it before letting it go. "To Ingredient Mountain!" He cheered.
After a quick breakfast, Draco was ready and practically dancing in excitement in his chair. Narcissa came down, grabbed her own plate, and ate hurriedly whilst drinking a mimosa. Narcissa watched Draco quietly, not a fan of the dancing he was doing, but she was still glad to see him more animated. This showed promise already, to make him appear to seem more normal and happy. Naricssa finished her breakfast, got up, and grabbed her bag. "Well Draco are you ready to go? If so let's head to the fireplace."
Remus smiled as well. "We would be happy to have Draco over more often, if that's what you decide. He was very well behaved and polite while here, and seemed to have a good time. Please do let me know what you decide." He patted Draco's shoulder gently, reluctantly giving him over to his mother.
Narcissa nodded at Draco's response to her look, thanked Remus again, and took her leave. "I really must be going now, lots of errands and such to do. Draco you be good and mind Remus okay? Have a good day." And with that Narcissa left Remus's place to go and do, well, anything but be a mother.
Draco hugged Ron back as well and returned the compliment to his new friend. "I am glad we can still be friends, and you are nice as well, I had a great time today. I am glad we met."
Harry frowned, though, when Draco talked about Uncle Remus not wanting to meet him. He wouldn't think Uncle Remus would feel that way.
Remus answered the door, keeping his expression neutral. "Lady Malfoy. You received my letter, I see. Please come in. I apologize, as my home is nowhere near your standards, but I hope that it will have been adequate enough that we kept Draco off of the street, where any kidnapper could have snatched him." He moved aside, letting her in, while not-so-subtly chiding her for losing track of her child and not looking for him. "The boys are playing in Harry's room. I'll just go up and let them know it's time for Draco to go home." He headed up, taking his time.
Harry was working on something for his Mind Healer now, actually. Since they'd been examining his memories, she'd noticed several crushes. Harry had thought noticing them was enough, but she'd insisted that he write out what he'd been feeling at the time. He could do it however he liked, but she thought it would help him process and internalize parts of his childhood.
"So if you are in control of yourself, why is Remus scared you will bite someone? And how do you listen to your wolf? Does it like speak to you? Or is it more of a feeling? Sorry I am just very curious. I am glad you don't have to drink the poison smelling potion though, that doesn't sound good. And I promise I won't tell anyone about Remus's secret, though I am glad you told me. I would hate to think of you alone during such a painful time, I would have to try to sneak away if you were going to be all alone and in pain. And oooh! School together! That sounds fun for sure! Maybe as we get older we could do sleep overs and such and then try on a full moon. I would like to be there to keep you company sometime. You are my best friend Harry, and I want you to feel safe and comfortable whenever possible." Draco took Harry's hand again and gave it a friendly squeeze.
Draco nodded and followed his mother to the fireplace where they used Floo Powder to travel to the fireplace of the Leaky Cauldron.. Narcissa threw a fit over cleaning off Draco, he still had to look presentable at all times. Especially when they were out in public. Draco could have fun and get dirty the way small children do, when they played at Harry's. But being a kid wasn't allowed anywhere in public, at least not in front of his Mother. Draco held back a sigh as he let Narcissa fitfully clean him. Then they left the Leaky Cauldron together, heading to Remus's place. Draco had to hold in his excitement as they got closer. Narcissa knocked on the door and waited for it to open.
Remus held both boys close, snuggling them. "You are a very nice person, Draco. And you shouldn't ever stop trying to be a nice person. I think, if you work hard enough at it, you'll prove to everyone that you aren't like your parents at all." He very much wanted to take the poor lad in and lavish him with all the love he so clearly deserved, but knew what a fuss would be made if he did. He did plan to make sure that the blonde would always be welcome in his home, though.
"Can we really have ice cream now? I would love that! That sounds awesome! I...I don't remember what kind of ice cream I like though...is that okay? And oooh you get extra ice cream? That's super nice of him to give you that!"
Their lessons progressed, and they did quite well. In fact, Draco learned more from Remus than his previous tutors had been teaching him, and in a more neutral light. Remus truly was an excellent teacher, and Harry enjoyed having other boys to learn with.
"Draco, I am about to leave for the day, but I wanted to tell you some news first. Remus has said that you are welcome pretty much any time, so I am hoping that you will be able to visit him and Harry again tomorrow. Isn't that great?" Narcissa said in a voice that seemed higher than usual, as if she was trying to be happy but didn't quite know how.
Draco hugged Harry back and allowed himself to stop worrying about what his mother would say. He was at his real home currently, and he knew he was safe for now. Draco smiled happily at Harry and Ron, glad to be with friends. Draco was still a little worried that he might get into trouble when he got home for some reason, as his mother was good at yelling at him, but for now Draco decided to live in the moment with his best friend Harry, and his new friend Ron.
Draco saw Harry's eyes watering and that made him cry harder for a minute because he was making his friend cry and he didn't mean to. But then as Remus picked them up and held them, Draco's breathing started to return to normal, and his tears started to slow. Draco snuggled into Remus as well as Harry and listened to the older man talk. He let himself believe in Remus's words as if they were indeed a magical guarantee. Remus telling him that he wasn't mad at Draco made him feel better. Draco hiccupped a little as Remus stopped talking and just sat in the man's arms for a bit, not quite sure what to say but enjoying the feeling. Draco also wanted to bask in the compliment Remus had given him.
Draco loved spending time with Harry and Remus, it felt like home. Draco got happier and a little more confident as they spent more time together. His parents were happy with his reading and math improvements. Draco and Harry learned well together, and had a ton of fun playing as well when the learning session part of the day was over. One day, when Draco was dropped off, he heard that a friend of Remus and Harry’s would also be stopping by, which made him curious but also nervous…
Remus offered her a polite smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. He wasn't worried about her noticing it, as she wasn't exactly meeting his eyes. "It's my pleasure. Draco was on his best behavior last time, and I know he will be in the future. He's a good boy, and I look forward to teaching him. If I need any help with lessons, in any way, I'll be sure to ask. Have a good day, Lady Malfoy." He escorted her out the door as she left. Once she was gone, he turned to the boys. "What do you say we be very, very bad for just a little bit? How would you like ice cream right after breakfast? I know I want some, after that." His smile was kinder, and did reach his eyes this time.
"Well this smells delicious sir! I am excited to try it!" Draco said sincerely as Remus dished some lasagna onto his plate. This, Draco decided, looking around the apartment once more, this is a home.
“I really hope Mother isn't too mad at me this time, I don't want you to be sad. Whoever comes to pick me up I hope they are nice to you and Remus. And if they aren't...well I will be sad and very sorry." Draco stared down at the ground for a bit before allowing himself to focus on playing.
Draco looked a little crestfallen at the mention of his mother and the idea of avoiding her made him worry that Mrs. Weasley would decide that Draco shouldn't be friends with Ron. But Draco did his best to smile at Mrs. Weasley and make sure he seemed like a nice kid. Draco really wished he didn't look like his Dad and he wished he had a different name. But unfortunately, he didn't. Draco squeezed Harry's hand, hoping for reassurance that his excitement hadn't been bad, he hadn't mentioned Harry's secret, just that he wanted to do a sleepover sometime. Plus with his mother being who she was he figured that it made sense for them to need to plan a sleepover, because well she wasn't known for being nice...Draco spoke quietly to Mrs. Weasley before she left.
Ron laughed breathlessly, not able to answer Draco until after they'd caught up with Harry, feeling brighter and happier than he had in awhile. "I think Mum still knows how to do formal things. We only stopped 'cause Mum and Dad got busy, I think.  I'll tell her I want formal ones. That way no one is left out." He panted softly, eyes bright. "I bet, if I'm really nice and polite, she'll say yes. I promise I'll be good." He was very determined.
Harry squirmed his way into the hug as well, comforting Draco. "Uncle Remus just doesn't want them shouting. I don't like shouting much." He snuggled the blonde boy.
His room was painted in neutral colors with hints of earth tones and greens, and he had a small children's potions kit, some books, and a toy broom. On his bed sat a single plush wolf with bright green eyes. He loved his room, it was much better than the cupboard at Aunt Petunia's house, and he was very glad that he never ever had to go back there again.
Harry hurried up to his room to write Draco a letter and get ready for bed, though he wasn't sure how much he was going to sleep. He got his paper and ink ready, and started to write. It was messy and childish, but readable.
Draco’s magic mixed with Harry's as they played, allowing more than one toy to fly at a time. Draco played with Harry giggling as the toys flew sometimes. He wanted to play with the rest of Harry's plushies, the ones besides Wolfy. And during the time that they played with plushies Draco managed to make a cat one move on it's own with his magic. As it started to walk on it's own Draco realized he was controlling it and tried to get it to pounce playfully on Harry. It kind of worked? But the cat did more of a flop as Draco lost control of his magic again. The flop made Draco burst into a fit of laughter because the cat plushie had just looked so cute and silly. He grinned up at Harry, grey eyes shining with friendship and hope.
"Good to see you have been using your manners Draco, we do our best to make sure you know how to act around others. Glad to see it has paid off. As I said I will talk to your father but at this point, with the way you look right now I doubt he will be able to say no. Which means we will be in touch soon Remus. Is owl the best way to contact you? I will talk to Lucius as soon as he gets home tonight and write you afterward. Thank you for keeping Draco out of the street while I was away. Harry, thank you for being kind to my Draco, and for being a friend when he needed one." Narcissa finished speaking and nodded at both Harry and Remus before dragging Draco out of the door behind her.
"Umm should we play for a bit more before my Mom comes to pick me up?" Draco asked Harry as he realized his arm was still in the air. Draco blushed slightly as he put his arm down. The boys played for a bit longer until Narcissa came to pick him up. Draco told Harry bye, with just a brief hug, scared as always to show too much emotion with his mother present. Emotion was frowned upon in his family, unless it was an emotion that could be used for power…
Draco looked at his friend and wondered why he seemed uncomfortable all of the sudden. Draco reached out and took Harry's hand, squeezing it in comfort, hoping to ease Harry's nerves. "I promise I won't scream and I don't think you could say anything that would scare me. I already know how nice you are Harry." Draco finished talking and smiled at his friend.
Draco watched his new friend speak and felt his heart breaking for him, he didn't want Harry to have to feel ashamed of who he was. And the fact that Harry felt scared to tell Draco made his heart hurt as well. Draco closed the gap between them and pulled Harry into a tight hug. Still hugging his friend, Draco chose his words carefully.
Remus got down on Draco's level and hugged him. "I'm sorry, Draco. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I just thought that perhaps it would be better if your parents and Ron's parents didn't have to meet a lot, because they fight and can say mean things. I didn't want that to spoil your friendship with Ron, and make any of you feel bad about being here. Will you forgive me?"
Harry loathed that title. Almost as much as he loathed the 'Boy-Who-Lived' title. Three years after the war, at 20 years of age, you'd think a bloke could at least be upgraded to Man-Who-Lived. His disdain for his monikers had been a stressing point between him and Ginny. It was why they'd broken up again after giving it another go.
Apparently, no one else thought that his new owl was as lovely as Hedwig had been. Sure, the Snowy Owl had been out of place in Britain and very noticeable. She had also been loyal, elegant, and proud. She had been with Harry through many things, and was an excellent companion. And upon finding his new owl, Harry knew that this bird was going to be an excellent companion as well. He just wasn't sold on any of those other things for him. In fact, Harry was pretty sure that this owl was going to be the exact opposite of Hedwig in many ways.
"Who's this with you, Harry?" The man asked, squatting down a bit so he wouldn't seem as tall. Harry did a happy little dance of joy before answering him.
Draco returned his attention to his plate and tried his first ever lasagna. It was heavenly. Draco had never had something so good! He quickly complimented Remus and told him it was the best food he had ever had, his voice ringing with the sincerity only a child so young seems to have. Draco loved the food so much that he was soon dancing in his seat, happy and relaxed for a change. He felt...safe here.
