London was usually bustling with people from all around the world; however he found the streets surprisingly empty, with only a few people walking from one building to another.
"Where's Granger? Surprised to at least not see her here," Draco said smugly, somehow oblivious to the fact that they were practically pushed up against each other. "I always expected she'd find a way to transmogrify a book into a human so she could marry it."
I’m done being their puppet, Draco thought as he started through the nearby woods.  I’ll find my own way if I have to.
"Yerghh," Draco replied, saying what Harry imagined was the same thing, but with a mouth full of candy.
Running his hands through his hair, Harry turned back towards the direction of the Durlseys’.
[Earlier this day]
The sound of a snapping twig behind him snapped Draco to his senses.
The first thing Harry noticed when boarding the train was a short table filled with Cauldron Cakes, Chocolate Frogs, and small bags of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Bean. A small sign was posted at the side, saying:
"That was low, Malfoy, even for you," Harry sternly replied.
Wow! We're being taught by an Animagus? Harry thought, almost shocked until he remembered that Professor McGonagall was also an Animagus, though turning into a tabby cat was considerably less dramatic than being able to grow wings.
For a moment I thought this ride was going to be a little more pleasant, Harry thought, with a soft sigh. Something is bothering Draco, I feel it. But I'm sure he'll open up to me about as quickly as he'd open up to Hermione.
One face he did recognize, Professor Magareous stood at the podium in the front, where Dumbledore had usually made his announcements.
Harry shivered and looked around him again. Everyone he could see moved as if they were at least almost-late for their departure. Nobody, at least in the immediate vicinity, was slowing down; nobody, at least nearby, even looked his way.
“Hogwarts summer school,” Draco said aloud.  “Why have I never heard of this before?”
If you’re an agent of Voldemort, this would be a bad day to pick a fight with me, Harry thought, still fuming.
"If you're trying to apologize, you're doing a shoddy job of it," Harry said with a light groan.
"Welcome to Hogwarts Express. Please everyone, find your nearest seat," a voice echoed about the train.
"I wrttgh gueing thrr athkh tbprrblh sbth tnggtng," Draco hissed in response.
"Mr. Potter, I presume?" the man inquired, with a slight tilt of his head.
He might have walked for minutes or hours, he didn’t start to notice the passing of time until his frustration began to ebb.
He didn't even recognize the staff. Friendly unknown faces had escorted them through the school, as if they'd never been here before. Where was Professor McGonagall, where was Hagrid, where was Dumbledore? Merlin's pants, he almost even missed Snape.
"I'm not apologizing!" Draco shouted. "Look, I wasn't even trying to be here, okay? I thought someone was following me in the woods, and I stumbled across this flier at Stonehenge."
The bus ride itself was pretty normal.  A dark haired man in the back of the bus kept looking at him, but never said a word.
The ride wasn’t terribly long, and his anger must have made it pass quicker because they arrived at the city in half the time he would have imagined it would take.
This is unfair! He thought to himself with clenched fists.  I want to do more with my life than be a servant of Voldemort. What if I don’t see eye-to-eye with their vision?  What’s wrong with that?  Why is that a crime?
Still, it sounds like we've had similar experiences, Harry thought as he leaned back and looked out the window at the rolling hills.
The whistle of The Hogwarts Express pulled Harry back to the moment, and he quickly pushed forward, feeling more confident. His conversation with Professor Magareous, while indeed strange, had helped him finally break free of the eerie feeling of being watched. If something was indeed following him, it hadn't yet dared to venture onto Platform Nine and Three Quarters, or even better yet, perhaps it didn't know where Harry had gone, and walking through the hidden wall had allowed Harry to evade his stalker. Either way, Harry felt a bit safer now, and that's what really mattered.
"It means that we noticed that you have fantastic potential and a great opportunity for growth," Magareous replied with a warm smile.
Quickly pulling out his wand, Draco whirled around.
Everything just seemed very strange.
"That's the Weasley-est thing I think I've ever heard you say," Draco replied.
Whoever is here doesn’t want their presence to be known, Draco thought, swallowing hard, which means that it’s probably not my father or one of our servants.
This is a voluntary supplemental program for only the most courageous and ambitious students.  If you find yourself interested, proceed as you normally would to Hogwarts.  No need to confirm your attendance, or acquire supplies.  We already know who is coming, and arrangements have been already been made on your behalf.
"What foul language was that? Was that some sad attempt of you trying to speak Parseltongue?" Harry questioned.
"I'm sure another compartment — any compartment — would have better company than the likes of you," Harry said.
"Yeah," Harry said, deciding it best to let the conversation drop for now.
“Whoever is here, show yourself!  Or I’ll make sure you don’t live to see the sun set!” Draco threatened, hoping his bluff sounded convincing.  It didn’t to him at least.
"Do you?" Draco asked.
Draco glanced back in the direction he was initially heading.  He could see an opening in the woods ahead.  He pushed forward; as he exited the woods, his brow furrowed and he stared ahead.
Maybe I took it too far this time, he thought as his temper finally began to simmer down.  They can be wretched people, but I still need a place to live.
"I think she'd sooner turn you into a toad," Harry shot back.
"Oh, well… the feeling is mutual, I guess," Harry replied, still a bit confused. "But what are you doing here?"
Silence fell over the compartment again.
Harry came to an abrupt halt as he entered the Platform of Nine and Three Quarters. A tall, dark-haired man with a short, pointy beard stood in front of him. The man wore a suit and top hat, with a long, black cane to complete the ensemble. He looked like he had been waiting for him.
"Whatever," Harry said with a huff; he sat down on the opposite side of the compartment, with as much distance from Draco as he could manage.
"You arrogant little — well, at least I have a father to look out for me!" Draco snapped.
“I never wanted you to be my enemy Malfoy, I just didn’t like how you treated other people. When you insulted Hermione because she was muggle born, or Ron because his family wasn’t as well off as yours I felt like I had to defend them. When I found out what Voldemort was making you do I was told you had to be the one to decide whether or not to go through with it; that I couldn’t save everyone,” Harry replied.
“Malfoy surely she can apparate to her appointments from there?,” Harry puzzled.
“I’m staring to think maybe I should have paid more attention in Divination class, it’s no wonder Ron and I kept seeing death omens in our tea leaves. Though I never could get the hang of reading the crystal ball, it always just looked foggy and unclear,” Harry said.
"Two stores up and on the left," Draco replied, hoping his own growling stomach would stay quiet until this last delivery was taken care of.
Harry gingerly sat on the edge of the couch next to Draco, knowing the man was most likely at the end of his emotional rope. “Scorpius?”
"Yes of course. If you require anything else you know how to reach me," Draco replied, and with a brisk nod the dwarf disappeared back through the door with a resounding slam.
“But I thought they were going after old Death Eaters and their families, why random half bloods now who were never involved in the war?” Ron asked.
“It’s just me Malfoy, you had some sort of shock and passed out. We’re in your backyard on the patio,” Harry supplied, giving the hand in his a squeeze.
-Malfoy”
"Why else would I be here?" Draco drawled, thrusting his briefcase forward.
-Hermione
"Apparently after we graduated McGonagall couldn't find decent teachers worth their salt, certainly none good enough to brew healing potions. And the apothecaries nearby couldn't make large enough batches quickly enough so she asked me if I'd kept up with my potion brewing and if I'd be willing to help out. The current potions master is good enough with a book and can muddle through some of the basic potions but anything past second year I help brew, so he doesn't blow everyone up," Malfoy replied.
Harry was really beginning to hate that four-letter word, so innocuous and yet overloaded with unsaid things.
The next morning only two hours after he'd arrived at work Harry received a letter from Draco via his Eagle Owl.
“Did you ever try holding a conversation with a Ravenclaw? They either spouted absolute nonsense like Lovegood or prattled on incessantly like they were trying to quote every book in the library from memory,” Draco argued with a scowl.
“Malfoy, does that happen every time you go into town?” Harry asked later as they tucked into the meat pies he’d bought.
“I had lunch with Hermione today, managed to turn her onto a few new possible leads for the attacks. Though she said it could take awhile longer for any answers,” Harry said, knowing he was risking the almost jovial mood by bringing it up.
“Why are you risking your family’s safety Malfoy? Can’t Astoria and Scorpius stay at her parent’s until school begins at least?” Harry asked.
“Hermione has always been better at multi-tasking then anyone else I’ve known. McGonagall gave her a Time-turner one year so she could double up her classes,” Harry said.
Hermione sighed heavily. “It’s not like the pure bloods didn’t attempt the same sort of thing years ago with the muggle borns and squibs. Now however they’re badly outnumbered, most of the families were decimated during the wars and those who remain are either children or grandparents.”
“I know Harry, and the best thing to do is just to be there and let them know you’re there if they need you. It can be really frustrating just sitting back and waiting, but if you force it they might run. Ron hates showing me whenever he’s hurting, he’d go to his mum or Fred and you before he’d talk to me and I hated being the last to know,” Hermione explained.
"Malfoy, stay here a moment, I'm going to run down the street and grab us some early dinner," Harry said, glancing around the antique store they were currently in. Thankfully it was a fairly quiet shopping day and most of the stores they'd gone into had less than three people inside.
"I was running down family trees in the Hall Of Records all afternoon, making sure we don't miss some great aunt three times removed who may have linked some of the more obscure pureblood families," Harry replied irritably.
-Hermione
Harry chose to ignore the criticism since it was sadly a sentiment he shared. "They haven't failed before, and each attack was more carefully planned than the previous ones. I'm sure they came here with enough explosives to take the entire manor down, they just didn't know about the wards. The only way to get to you and your family is to break the magic or catch you outside your home. If they're really trying not to use magic that might be traced then they probably won't try cracking the wards, especially since that'll take a lot of time and they're usually in and out in under 20 minutes. So that may mean that they'll wait until you go into town, leave the protection of the manor."
"Yes of course, he really has quite a green thumb. He has a whole plot of Fanged Geraniums that just bloomed, very touchy to grow without just the right amount of sunlight but they're doing exceptionally well," Madam Pomfry replied with a proud smile.
Draco turned with a scowl, “Port Key.”
-Harry
The entire day had seemed surreal to Harry and for a moment he was looking forward to sitting down for dinner while telling Ginny all about it. That is until he opened the door of his very quiet and very empty flat. Harry hadn't actually spoken to Ginny in eight months since they had decided that between her demanding Quiddich career and his chaotic job as Head Auror they would be better off living alone; without the expectations of their marriage getting in the way. Their children had taken it hard but conceded that if their parents weren't happy together then at least they wouldn't be fighting while apart. Ron had been surprisingly supportive when Harry had broken the news to him, simply saying it was better that they take a break now while they were still friends then drag it out until they were enemies with broken hearts. Hermione had understood as well, reminding Harry about how Ron and she had been in a similar situation early into their marriage.
“Are a book and a bookmark appropriate?”
Harry nodded as the whole memory slid into place again, Draco, his dying wife, his crying son, the man collapsing on his patio, the book.
"You're a murder, you have to pay for your crimes! You killed innocent children for the Dark Lord, why aren't you in prison?" the man bellowed, as a ripple of unease rolled through the others surrounding him.
Draco's eyebrows raised in surprise. "Then what exactly did they try to blow my house apart with that managed to kill four other pureblood wizarding families? They weren't exactly helpless and I'm sure they put up a fight."
“I suppose, and as far as I know most explosives experts are either muggle military trained or self taught, and those either blow themselves up or wind up getting caught and then thrown in jail,” Harry replied.
Nearly 20 minutes later Harry had the entire top of the Medusa crown free of Draco's hair. "Alright Neville we're good here, now what?"
Sincerely,
P.S. You’d look great in green and orange”
‘No, don’t say anything! Just keep your mouth shut and go inside,’ Draco’s brain commanded, though his body stayed stock-still.
"Don't suppose telling them the attacks have all been centered on Voldemort's supporters would get them off your back a bit, eh?" Harry smirked.
"Then remove the restrictions on Malfoy so he can join his family on their holiday and we'll set up a trap without the possibility of any casualties," Harry requested.
I will be making my usual run this evening and was curious if you’d like to discuss what I’ve discovered about your suspicions? If you have anything to add I’d be very interested to hear it. Let me know before sunset.”
-Harry
“So anything new on our bomber case?” Harry asked, desperate to put his mind on something other than Draco.
"Oh that's fine Mr. Malfoy, thankfully I've only had one student who's needed it so far this year. I've never gone through potions as quickly as when you and Mr. Potter were students and I dare say I hope I never do again," Madam Pomfry nodded briskly, taking the vials and whisking them away to her storage cupboards.
Harry sat rather dumbfounded while he re-read the letter. It was quite clear and abrupt and yet he was still confused. What could Draco be so busy with suddenly? Why the sudden disinterest in the case? Was Harry supposed to be concerned over Draco’s sudden change in demeanor? If it was Ron or Hermione he’d have already trashed the letter and floo’d straight to their house to find out the answers. However this was Draco and he was rather prickly at best when someone went against his express instructions. After a bit more thought, Harry supposed perhaps it was better this way. The news he would have shared with Draco was not exactly exciting nor groundbreaking. As far as he could tell most of the Wizengamot council members were clean of any actionable wrong doings or suspicions. There were only three members who had either direct ties or previous affiliations to a prior Death Eater or Voldemort supporter. The evidence was tenuous at best, nothing Hermione would have allowed him to pursue at any rate; especially considering their status. Even so, Harry added the names to the bottom of the list and went to personally check in with the Aurours who were keeping watch on their possible targets.
Harry could barely pull all the events out separately, so tangled up in a million smaller things as they were. Dates blurred together until suddenly they were celebrating Albus' tenth birthday and Harry couldn't even remember him turning nine. He'd so desperately wanted a family, and yet as he sat listening to the four people closest to him sing Happy Birthday, Harry felt like he didn't even know them. Unfortunately, as Albus started school at Hogwarts things only got worse, Ginny was gone for weeks at a time for training and games, and no amount of trying to reconnect with either his wife or children seemed to work.
“Nobody would have suspected you sneaking around letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts, it would have been the perfect ruse,” Harry replied with a smirk.
Harry chose not to argue the point, figuring pushing Hermione right now would only cause more unneeded strain. She'd promised him a few days of protection for Malfoy, but that didn't mean he couldn't keep the extra wards going until the attackers were caught. He'd just have to work even harder following the leads Hermione had for him and finish tracking down all the Voldemort supporters who had escaped imprisonment. It was days like these when he was relieved he wouldn't have Ginny breathing down his neck about never being home.
"They're a pretty big mess once you go back a few generations. Several families had at least a dozen kids, some of which married into other pureblood families, some never married and a few married muggles and were completely disowned. They stopped keeping track of those family members and there's no records of what happened to them," Harry said.
"Well, well, well, the Head Auror coming down from on high to sully his hands in such a mundane task as interviewing me. What's the special occasion Potter? Your secretary was handling things surprisingly well," Draco Malfoy said, his familiar sneer across his lips and derision in his voice.
“She’s probably as stressed as you are right now Harry, heavens knows when the last time you managed a decent meal or night’s sleep and Hermione’s more often at the office then home nowadays. Come to our house for dinner tomorrow, I’ll cook and you can spend the night so we can have breakfast together. We’ll get this all sorted, I promise,” Ron replied with a smile.
“No, everything’s been…”
Hermione’s face softened and her shoulders relaxed. “You’re right Harry, I don’t need to concentrate on the pure bloods anymore, I have a new lead to follow. Thank you, I just need to take a short break to re-group and get organized with this new information.”
“Lose something, Potter?” Draco drawled, trailing behind Scorpius and Albus.
The book sounds like something worth borrowing, I may just have to take you up on the offer. I’ll have to look more into the American teams; they might be fun to watch.
Harry grabbed a nearby metal tray and held it up so Draco could see his reflection.
"Harry! I didn't expect to see you today. Is something wrong? Is that why you're here with Draco today?" Neville asked, eyes flicking from his to Draco's and back again anxiously.
Harry smirked, “I know the feeling, even being related to Ron and Fred now, I spend more money here when I bring the kids then all the years’ holidays combined. Good thing I’m part owner.”
"And was there?" Hermione asked, still able to get keyed up over a good research project.
Harry understood where Malfoy was leading with his questions, but he'd been honest with his answer and he didn't agree with Malfoy's insinuations. "I'll admit I was skeptical when Albus came home telling us he'd been placed in Slytherin and had met, of all people, your son to befriend. I know our assumptions of each other are hard to get over after all these years but I don't want to live in the past anymore. Others may doubt Headmistress McGonagall's motives Malfoy, but next to Dumbledore she was the only adult here at Hogwarts I trusted as much. So I wouldn't care what others thought about you teaching, if it was something you wanted to do then you should've done it. You may have been a git in school, but Professor Snape was never wrong by saying you were his most accomplished student. My kids would be lucky to learn potions from you."
"I don't know that they are muggles, probably some group of witched and wizards who are hiding their magic so we can't trace it back to them," Harry replied.
He hadn’t been sure after sending his response to Draco’s letter what to do or where it left them. Clearly Draco wasn’t feeling hostile towards him, he’d revealed his biggest secret and Harry hadn’t run to the tabloids. Honestly he’d been a bit put off that Draco would even think he’d do such a thing, they obviously still had some lingering misconceptions about each other. Pushing Draco was always a bad idea, Harry knew the man could strike back as fast and lethal as any viper but he felt impatient knowing there was a problem, that people were hurting and not being able to do something about it.
"Diggory said he was acting as liaison between the field Aurors and you, so I'll have him cross check any of the names of the families that they manage to track down," Harry replied, getting an approving nod from Hermione.
-Harry
"Potter you're bleeding and what the devil have you done to Neville, he looks like he's hyperventilating. I knew being around this many plants wasn't healthy, there's something poisonous in the air, isn't there?" Draco asked, eyes scanning the greenhouse in suspicion.
“I didn’t think to get it signed, is that important? I think the bookmark is only gold plated, didn’t cost that much”
“What if he’s not here?” Albus asked suddenly, the question catching Harry off guard as they piled the boy’s trunks onto a trolley.
Unfortunately for Draco, this only cemented his confirmation that there was something wrong and doubled his resolve to fix it; whatever it was. Harry had learned from both Ron and Hermione that letting problems stew for long periods of time never actually accomplished anything other than making them grown and eventually boil over like a badly brewed potion. However, getting into this conversation at a crowded train station wasn’t the right place, especially since Harry fully expected it to devolve into a screaming match, as was to be expected for the two of them.
“I think I looked about the same way you do every year after school would end I had to leave Hogwarts and spend the summer with my aunt and uncle. It was months before I’d be free to see Ron and Hermione again, and I was fairly miserable the entire time,” Harry commented softly as Albus lost sight of his friend.
The front of the large manor was still as imposing as Harry Potter remembered from years previous when Death Eaters had dragged his friends and him here to face Voldemort. However, dinner-plate-sized scorch marks now marred the large entryway steps that led to a set of double doors that stood wide open as Aurours came and went. The men and women nodded briefly to him in passing but swiftly continued on with their work. Harry entered Malfoy Manor and quickly followed the sound of voices coming from further within. The open foyer led to a vastly oversized dining room with a fireplace that dominated the far wall and a long table that could seat twelve.
“Mister Harry Potter for you Master Malfoy,” the house elf announced later that evening.
“Thanks Malfoy, guess I could use all the help possible,” Harry laughed, seeing Draco’s smirk turn into a full-blown smile.
"Where were you when the attack started?" Harry asked when Malfoy remained quiet.
Draco stopped mid-step, looking over his shoulder as Harry caught up to him. His temper felt frayed, his nerves agitated and he snapped irritably at Harry. “Spit it out Potter!”
“I thought I was quite clear before Potter, what on Earth could you need help understanding?” Draco snarled.
“That’s why I think it’s a diversion, to scatter our forces so far apart that we have no choice but to pull them away from the targets we’re protecting so they have plenty of time to attack,” Harry answered.
Harry had been anxious when they'd first apparated into town, but except for a few sidelong glances from people they hadn't been bothered. He was sure what he expected walking into these places with Draco, especially after the man had basically said he'd become a shut-in after how people had treated him. Obviously though people were willing to overlook any previous wrong doings on Draco's part once they realized he had their requested potions.
"How did you even know I was here Malfoy?" Harry asked curiously.
Malfoy resisted sneering in contempt, knowing Harry was only doing his job and had it been anyone else they may have refused to help him at all. "I don't need a babysitter Potter, the manor's wards were quite sufficient and I won't need any errands run for some time yet. Though if you'd like to accompany me whilst I make my deliveries I'll send you an owl when I'm ready."
“Yeah all right, just wait until the rumor mill catches you two leaving the ministry together. Rita Skeeter will be bashing down your doors come Monday morning,” Ron scoffed.
Did you know they rarely play any international games and each one of their states had at least one team? A state called California has 2, one in the south and one in the north. America splits their teams up by regions, north, west, east and south and the top 2 teams who have won the most games overall play against each other.
“Can I get you anything? I could make some tea?” Harry tried.
Harry laughed and squeezed Ron’s shoulders. “Don’t worry Ron, your wife can demand a gag order. Your purity will remain intact.”
“You know the best way to get results from Hermione is to be direct, honest and catch her when she’s not distracted. Take her out to lunch, talk to her Harry. It’s not like she’s going to fire you mate,” Ron said consolingly.
So caught up in his magic, Harry missed when Draco began walking away. “Malfoy, wait!”
Draco beamed proudly at Albus and James thanked Scorpius, offering their own sweets in exchange. As strange as it was to think his son was friends with Potter’s and Weasley’s, he had to admit none of them seemed overly bad influences and so far even their parents seemed more tolerable then they had been during their school days. Although he’d looked forward to spending the day with Scorpius, being so easily included into this slightly rambunctious group had been a pleasant change of pace, especially getting to see Scorpius interacting so happily with his peers.
Harry passed on the information to Hermione, leaving how easy it was learning how to make bombs via the internet was, as soon as he returned to the ministry, noting her slight disappointment.
Muttering had started throughout the group and Harry was able to discern his own name and Draco's as well as questions as to why they were together. Harry had no interest in answering and quickly followed on Draco's heels as he continued down the street. The old man however was not content with letting it go and started shouting again, following several paces behind.
Harry felt his stomach flip over uneasily. "You want to use Malfoy as bait?"
“Don’t say it Potter! I won’t say ‘I’m fine’ as long as you promise you won’t say ‘I’m sorry’. That’s all anyone who has come into this house this past month has said to me,” Draco snapped, his voice hoarse with pent up emotion, eyes glazing with tears he refused to acknowledge.
"I was downstairs in the basement, prepping some potions for delivery this afternoon to Hogwarts. Which I'm going to have to re-brew now," Draco replied with a sigh.
"I didn't say that Malfoy. You and your family's safety is my priority right now. For the time being, staying here in the manor would be the best idea. I and several other Aurors are going to place more wards around the perimeter to monitor anyone who might try to apparate onto the grounds and we'll be alerted the moment anyone uses anything but the most basic magic that isn't your wife or son," Harry answered patiently.
Harry laughed. "I'm plenty keen, you tosser. But this is . . . this is good too, isn't it?"
“What makes you think that?”
"It would do, yes."
“But you'll enjoy lording it over him.” Lucius was back to snarling. “How does it feel to have a Malfoy sworn to obey your every command?”
“We’d like to keep that quiet for now,” he answered. “I don't mind them knowing about the life debt, though. What did you tell that reporter, by the way?”
"I can see why." Harry smiled back at him. "Did you choose everything for this guestroom? You know, the colours and furnishings and such?"
“No.” Draco rolled his eyes, making it clear that he shouldn't have to state something so obvious. “I want to serve him too. And stay with him for as long as he’ll have me.”
That didn't seem to comfort him. “So . . . what do you want to ask, then?”
"I wanted to borrow my father's new car—you know the Ford Focus he just magicked up?"
He shrugged. “Curse-breakers need to know a lot about different languages.”
“Muggle courses. I’m hopelessly behind.”
He took a deep breath. “I did. Seventh year.”
Hermione favoured Draco with a sidelong glance that promised more questions to come and then turned back to Ron’s Dad.
“I’m not,” Weasley agreed, gently scratching Draco’s neck. “We’re mates now.”
"I don't care that you were a Death Eater! That happened when you were a teenager. Fuck it, Draco. You stood trial for any wrongs you committed. It's over."
Harry followed Draco toward the back of the sanctuary, his mind racing. Thus far, Draco had been surprisingly open about his past, allowing Harry to peer into his—which was the right word to describe it? Rebirth, yeah. His rebirth in New York.
Kreacher was waiting for Harry when he finally arrived home, but Harry merely nodded at him before taking the stairs two at a time to reach the master bedroom.
"Well, put it back on track, because I do have an idea concerning Arthur and Molly Weasley and how to, er, convince them to tolerate me."
“This Benjamin and Noah.”
Fuck. It was hard not to roll his eyes at the sarcasm dripping from Draco’s voice. “There’s that, yeah. But I want you to be sure.”
“Of course he did. They’re genuinely sweet, and they didn’t mention the BDSM thing. And he didn’t notice anything peculiar about their clothes. Well, he wouldn’t, would he? Half of the wizarding world still dress like Victorians . . . .”
“Perhaps. But Draco committed some very adult crimes.”
Draco had been leaning sidelong against one of the pews, but he straightened up now and moved to join Harry on the step of the bimah.
Harry seemed to consider that. Then he put his hands on the table and leaned forward. “If you’re serious, why not give me a go right now?”
He wasn't lying, Harry decided. Which made sense: Draco wasn't inherently a violent person. Well, he had relished breaking Harry's nose that one time, but apart from that.
“But that’s terrifying!”
He stepped aside, but Harry didn’t follow.
“Don’t worry, my lord and master.” His Malfoy sneer was back as he stood up too. Back and in full force. “I’ll give you plenty of hints.”
There was a long moment of silence. “Dunno,” he said at last. “But I already hate being the boyfriend of one.”
“Right,” George said. “So this is the Baumgarten clan, yeah? The one Draco is so tight with?”
“You need to understand this, Harry.” At the moment, Draco didn’t care that he was interrupting the man who was, rightfully, his master. “This life debt is legitimate for a reason. Without you, I’d be dead twice over, at least. I might keep stressing that it’s not legally or magically binding, but that’s just for Granger’s sake. And the public’s.”
“Shame that Labour seems so unassailable right now.” Draco put down his fork with half the food left on his plate—he didn’t seem to have much appetite tonight.
“A position would need to open,” Malfoy said at last. “And Robards would have to agree to hire me. And then Harry would have to give his permission.”
"No, but—"
Five in the fucking morning. Why?
"Fuck me, you're so annoyingly perfect."
But ‘Master Draco’ chose that moment to stroll into the bedroom. “Oh good,” he said. “You’re finally up. Are you planning to shower or just scourgify yourself—“
“Very funny, Scarhead.”
Not exactly subtle.
“For peace in the home?” Harry nestled closer. The office continued to bustle around them, taking no notice. “So that’s the password? Much better than your last one.”
“Right,” Shira scoffed. “Because we so blend.”
"Are you?" He didn't look surprised as he helped himself to a seat. "The Prophet tried to out you once—claimed you'd been seen in a muggle gay club in New York—but, well, it's the Prophet."
"Oh. Right. Of course. I'd like to come too, if that's all right. Unless you want quality time alone with them." It was fine either way, really. He could survive another dinner at Malfoy Manor, but he didn't mind if Draco wanted his parents to himself.
“Muglfineces.”
Harry laughed and smacked his arse. "Off."
Narcissa bit back a smile. Oh, to be twenty again. “That’s true,” she acknowledged. “But you’ve always brought out the worst in each other.”
“Look, I know things went badly at Hagrid’s.” Harry pushed himself up so that he was sitting. “I, um, might owe you an apology.”
“Would marrying me wreck your life?”
“What does—”
Draco gave him his best what-the-fuck look.
She didn't say anything. Was she waiting for him to say something more? Would Potter expect him to apologise for every cruel comment he'd ever made about her? They'd be here forever.
Fuck, that went straight to Harry's groin. But he had to make one thing clear. "Only if you promise to enjoy every smack."
Instead Draco just favoured Harry with a small, sour smile. “Fair enough.”
“I, uh, can’t apparate any longer," Draco managed. "And I think there’s a connection between that fact and those transactions. In my head, I mean. In fact, I know there is.”
Harry grunted. "Me holding Malfoy Manor as a life estate sounds legally binding—wait. Is that what this about? Is the ministry threatening to seize your family's property?"
“Pardon, but Master Draco says if Master won’t get up for the sake of his job, then Master must be reminded that Mr. and Mrs. Ron Weasley are to be arriving.”
"No. I don't understand how that's possible, though. Weren't you seeing the Weaselette back in sixth year? Though I suppose you two never did anything but snog."
“When? We haven’t seen each other for three years. And you’ve only just discovered that you’re a little bent.”
Draco had only just made it to the bedroom door when Harry caught up with him. Harry grabbed hold of the prick’s shoulders and forced him to turn so that they were face to face.
“Don’t you dare be reasonable about a thing like that! I don’t want you hurling yourself into danger, not worrying about me just because you think I’ll live happily ever after with your friends. Or with any other decent person. I won't."
“Isn’t it obvious? I came back from the dead, Draco. I don’t want anyone thinking . . . well, you know.”
“You’ve said there’s more than just a deal between them,” his dad pointed out.
"Oh?"
“It’s already here. Upstairs.”
Draco was pretty sure Granger agreed with him on these points. Someday, when she was out of earshot of both Harry and her husband, he would have to ask her.
Hopefully.
Draco's expression was curiously neutral. “So you've never seen one before?”
Draco was even willing to admit that Hagrid possessed a legitimate talent when it came to magical creatures. But that did not make the man a qualified teacher. He had no idea how to conduct a proper lesson, and he had no business introducing his students to the most dangerous monsters he could find or breed.
Draco was underneath Potter now. They were still clothed, but he knew each could feel how hard the other was as they kissed and rubbed and frotted.
“No, really. It's impressive. What did you need to, uh, ferret out of that little hidey-hole?”
“Done eavesdropping, Potter?”
“I know the one.” There was a nostalgic smile in Draco’s voice now. “Excellent omelettes.”
“It isn't, Potter?” Malfoy stirred enough to grin up at him. “Were you just toying with me last night?”
Draco seemed at ease with that. "I do, to an extent. I know what it's like to share their view of the world now. Our sight is shit but our hearing is magnified and our sense of smell is extraordinary. Each person has a unique scent, did you know that? I really like yours, by the way."
“Well, yeah. So do I, Ferret, for your own safety. You’re going to have a target on your back for a long time.”
“Can do, I suppose.” Hagrid stiffened his shoulders, as if he had sensed the shift too. “Just don’t go putting your faith in him, Harry. He’s still a selfish git, I reckon, and he’ll only hurt you in the end.”
“Are you mad, Potter? It was a God-awful experience.”
“The place to be rigged for a muggle explosion?” Granger finished for him.
"Sorry." Draco knew his face was probably turning red, so he stood up and collected his jacket. "Bad place for two blokes to do that?"
“Really, Harry? Are you honestly going to begrudge me a little revenge?”
It was a fair point. Especially because Draco belonged to him now, and some twisted, possessive part of Harry believed that he wasn't really a Malfoy anymore.
“No.” Draco hesitated. “Actually . . . possibly? In a quite technical sense, as I can’t see how it matters now, legally speaking.”
Harry sat up too. "Yeah. First time I've ever had a pet who could curl up in bed with me. First time I've ever had a pet at all, really, who wasn't my owl."
“Oh, it will never get old,” Harry promised. But he stopped needling him. There'd be plenty more opportunities for that.
Draco's eyes shot up. He'd been so deep in thought that he hadn't noticed Granger creeping up on him. Nonetheless, he collected himself enough to stand up as he nodded toward the chair next to him.
"Yes, well, before that." He sat up too, but then hesitated. "My birthday is next Tuesday."
"I was on the wrong side of that war," he said at last. "I went in there to—well, I didn't actually want to . . . fuck, it doesn't matter now. But you had no reason to go back for us."
“Meanwhile, um, why are we here, exactly?”
Meanwhile, it was Ron’s turn to raise his eyebrows. “Why, Shira? The Malfoys are all about pure-blood supremacy. Except for this one now.”
“Yeah, I noticed.” He had given Draco his wand for that second duel. “The wands must sense some kind of connection between us.”
"No one's forcing him, Mione!"
“Look, just think it over.” Harry raised both his hands to his lips and kissed them. Which might have been a stupid, over-the-top gesture, but Draco didn’t call him on it. “If you talk that memory out, maybe we’ll discover why you won’t apparate.”
“Oxfam!” Toffee uttered the word proudly. “That is the person Master Draco is naming: A Mister Oxfam.”
"Shira's his ex-fiance. Sort of. It would be weird."
But all that was done now. Robards was satisfied and promised Harry he'd speak well of Draco's service. The Improper Use of Magic officials were finally satisfied, after taking forever to confirm Draco's status as a former agent and making him demonstrate his animagus form over and over.
He yawned. “For what it's worth, I've never been to a muggle cinema.”
"Because that worked out so well for you in your childhood?"
"You shouldn't be apologising, you know. You should be plotting some appropriate punishment."
“I don’t think you have to tell Harry about every partner you’ve ever had or anything. Or even about this Death Eater. Like I said, you’re entitled to privacy about your past.”
Didn't matter. Malfoy was willing to stop working undercover because of it, so Harry was willing to play along.
Harry fell quiet for a moment. “Would you like to be a house husband? Or, er, homemaker, if that’s the proper term?”
Those last infuriated Harry. Ron understood that—and he felt the same. He might still have some issues with the ferret, but he didn't want to see him abused. But a lot of people did, and Harry would have to learn how to deal with that kind of hatred. If he really wanted to make a go of it with Malfoy, he'd find himself confronting it often enough.
They lapsed into silence. For a few minutes, all Harry could hear was the ticking of the ghastly old clock that he kept meaning to give away. Or destroy. Or otherwise dispose of.
“You can’t apparate.”
He had barely complied when Draco hurled a pillow at his face. Harry caught it easily and swung it back at him, but Draco grabbed the other one on the bed first and used it to block the incoming blow.
Hermione knit her eyebrows together. “How do you mean?”
Her husband snorted. “He might well mean an end to the Malfoy line. You realise that, don’t you? He could not have found a more complete way to avenge himself on us.”
And with that, Harry made good his escape. He owed Shira for this intervention, but he pushed any fascinating but preposterous thoughts of her upcoming conversation with Hagrid from his mind.
“No.” His face took on that determined look Draco knew all too well. “Tonight, Malfoy.”
"Of course. I—” he broke off awkwardly, remembering that Draco didn't want him professing his love yet. "Goodnight."
Draco chose that moment to transform. It took only a second; suddenly George had a lapful of a very human Malfoy.
Bill stood up and held out his hand. "See you on Tuesday."
Draco noticed his prolonged silence. "As I expected," he drawled. "You will never think of yourself as a Malfoy. Nor would you consider me a true Potter."
Harry snorted. “I suppose we can remedy that.”
“This is not me being impulsive! Fuck, Draco, I love you too—”
Harry blanched. “Same. And I can hardly see—glasses are missing.”
“The media swarmed us.” Harry was rolling his eyes. “Mostly reporters from the Daily Prophet—we were all advised to work from home today. And tomorrow. And probably for the rest of the week.”
“Hello, Toffee.” He reached for his glasses. “So, ah, who are you, exactly?” He wanted to ask what she was doing in his house, but Draco must be to blame for that.
"That's not an answer.”
Draco glared down at him. “Thank you for assuming you understand what’s going on in my head better than I do.”
"What? No!"
“From what Ron told me yesterday, I’m pretty sure it was Arthur’s idea. I think he just wants to get the lay of the land, so to speak, so he can smooth things over with Molly—Ron’s mother, I mean.”
“We managed two games—uh, Harry, what is your boyfriend doing?”
Granger narrowed her eyes at him, but she didn't snatch it away. Draco raised her hand to his lips and kissed it. In fact, he overdid the courtliness enough to break through her anger and bring an exasperated smile to her face.
“And she still needs her family’s financial support, so she can’t push them too far,” Jamie put in.
They were in the dining room. Earlier, Draco and Granger had banded together to ensure that their romantic counterparts finally got a start on their paperwork for the Auror Department. By Draco’s reckoning, said counterparts had lasted about three hours before demanding a break. So Harry was now in the sitting room, confessing his tyranny to Granger, whilst Weasley was downstairs clobbering Draco at chess.
“But you—you’re the one who’s afraid this won’t work! If you already . . . I mean, why do you keep trying to slow us down?”
"Here," he said instead. He turned the laptop around, so that it was facing the Golden Trio. "All the information on that flashdrive. Accounts, passwords—every shred of financial evidence I collected on that lot."
"It went, ah, mostly well." Potter paused to run his fingers through that impossible hair of his, mussing it up even more than normal. "Let's find some place to talk."
"Female," Harry provided.
"No! No, Malfoy, we're done with fist fights. And that's—that's not how I wanted to wipe your sneer off." He took hold of Draco's wrist again, gently this time. "Come here."
"Potter figured out how to release me and apparated us to his home."
Draco just glared at him. “Piss off, Potter. This doesn’t concern you.”
“Yeah.”
Well, that took care of Potter's glasses.
"She did, yeah. They said not to risk apparating until they know what’s wrong."
“Good. I’m only sorry that someone found you before the Hogwarts Express made it back to King’s Cross.”
Shit, there was a sliver of real anguish in Draco’s voice. “Tell me what happened, love.”
Lucius put down his wand immediately. She should have known that he, at least, would never harm her.
This is not how he expected the day to end: lying here on the floor at Grimmauld Place—covered in dust, soot and probably some dried blood—with Draco Malfoy, of all people, sprawled on top of him.
Harry found himself grinning at that. “Perhaps. Or maybe we’ve all got a bit of each house in us.”
Had he known that Draco was so keen on debates? The good kind, where there was no ill-will on his part and no intention to humiliate anyone?
But that was a tricky subject, because you had to be flexible with legilimency. As Snape had explained long ago, reading a mind wasn’t like reading a book. When you were invading someone’s head, it was all about interpretation.
For a moment, Harry couldn’t breathe. Or perhaps he forgot to breathe. Or perhaps he forgot how to breathe.
"No, I meant—I don't know. Sort of playful? Still realistic, but, yeah, playful."
“Obviously.” Draco climbed to his feet and then offered George a hand. “I’ll stick with the saviour, thanks. You clearly want a pet, not a third.”
Fortunately, they were in a smaller, cozier dining room tonight—what did you call it? The second dining room? The family dining room? He would have to ask Draco later.
Weasley didn't say anything. The silence was oddly encouraging.
And asking for advice was an effective way to compliment someone. Harry would accuse him of sucking up if he understood Draco’s thought process, as would Weasley. Neither of them had mastered the skill, hence they denigrated it.
Draco rolled his eyes with an air of long-suffering. “Edward Remus Lupin is my first cousin once removed.”
“Boyfriends? No, Harry can tell her that himself.”
"Right." Ron forced himself not to roll his eyes. He never thought he’d hear old Kreacher—who was as tough and hard-bitten as they came—sounding as forlorn as Dobby used to over some imagined failing.
Draco woke up with a gasp, his heart pounding in his ears.
"You did poison me," Ron corrected, his voice wry. "I just survived it, thanks to Harry."
“Potter?”
Fortunately his mother spoke up first. "We are very grateful to you, Harry. Draco told us about what happened in the, ah, Room of Requirement, I believe it's called? How you and your friends risked your lives to save him from the fiendfyre—”
"Fuck yeah," Ron said. "But—all right. If you want to, er, just be normal mates, without any of this subservient shit, that can happen."
“Shhh.” Draco licked his lips in anticipation. “You've made it clear to everyone that you won't allow your humble servant here to enter an arranged marriage.”
Harry released him. Draco scrambled off his lap and ran to George, though he took a strangely circuitous route that led underneath some of the furniture. Bill understood; Draco was giving him and his wolfish scent as wide a berth as possible.
“And neither do we. But you two really should give yourselves some breathing room before you allow the press to comment.”
“It’s, um . . . .”
"Twenty quid says Kreacher will be horrified by this whole scenario."
“And, really, me and Bill are the ones who have the most reason to kick the ferret’s arse. Out of my family, I mean. And you—”
Harry let out a sigh that still sounded annoyed. But he also reached across the table to place his hands over Draco’s. “Look, I know you were brought up to think—”
Skeeter pretended to look chagrined. “Of course, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. Perhaps Mr. Potter will tell us instead just why, despite his heroics, he is reportedly assigned to deskwork for the foreseeable future?”
Potter answered before he could. "Robards blackmailed him. He couldn't resist making better use of a former Death Eater with a flair for occlumency. So he threatened to seize your home and send your husband to Azkaban if Draco didn't comply."
That was good, Ron supposed. Maybe Malfoy wouldn't even take a piss now without Harry's permission.
"Yeah. I recognised Benjamin from, er—”
Draco was the first to break the silence. “Safe flight and all that.” He stared down at Harry’s hand—the one still holding his. "I’m sorry I haven’t gotten you to a proper nail salon yet. You still need a manicure.”
"No." Harry shook his head. "I don't really expect you to sign over your personal accounts to me."
Not that Ron minded ordering Draco about. And not that he hadn’t done so already. But he shouldn’t have done it in front of his father—especially when there was such bad blood between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy. Ron almost wouldn’t blame Draco if that perfect sneer of his crossed his face.
“Yes. I didn't expect—”
Draco remained standing, struggling to form a response. He wasn't unhappy. He wasn't furious. He was more . . . bewildered. “I'm—do you know what you're doing?”
"I thought Draco, Hermione and I could use it to pick up Shira and Jamie at Heathrow. Apparation points are tricky there, especially with a squib in tow. And, anyway, if they have a lot of luggage—I mean, Draco says they have really elaborate Goth gowns."
“You’re visiting Lucius Malfoy?”
“Apparently,” Harry yawned and leaned back against his chair so that it was balancing dangerously on two legs. “So what about the rest of the house? Have you thought about how to redecorate it?”
“Soon then,” Harry promised.
Draco, however, seemed unimpressed. “Not personally. Kreacher saw to it. A couple of frum wizards went into the kitchen with those muggle blow torches—”
"All right?"
“Will Master Draco also want the kitchen kashered for our guests?” Kreacher continued.
“Yeah.” Harry grimaced as he stood up, wondering if he could get to the owl before Draco even noticed it—but no such luck. Draco was already walking to his side, eyeing the owl with a combination of dislike and fear.
Draco shrugged. “I’ll admit to some curiousity.”
Harry shrugged as he collapsed into a chair. “It’s fine, I suppose. Not sure why everyone needs to know our business—”
"Of course!" She nodded enthusiastically, her upcoming lecture momentarily forgotten.
Her eyes widened. “Has he?”
“You’re wrong, Hagrid.” Harry bit his lip. “But at least it was effective. The coercion, I mean.”
He was still furious, Harry reckoned, but that nod was enough. Harry apparated without another word.
“You just what?” He didn’t offer Harry a hand.
“Well . . . yes.”
She had a point, but Harry was loathe to admit it. “Maybe. Draco doesn't think highly of Dumbledore—not as a headmaster.”
“Really?”
Harry sank into the mattress, arms wrapped around the pillow that supported his chest.
There was a moment of silence. A long moment. “You’re the most convenient person to blame,” Draco said at last.
"You're pointy and angular in a really hot way," Harry clarified.
Harry threw him a sharp look. “With Dobby?”
"How about that one?" Draco pointed to one of the film posters.
Harry glared at him. “I’m going to take them down eventually. And no, Toffee, neither your head nor Kreacher’s will ever be up there. But we can’t tell him that.”
“No. I don’t have any.”
“If you don’t outlive us, he’ll entomb them at Malfoy Manor, of course. After your natural deaths,” Draco clarified. “In the house elf part of the catacombs.”
Ron tore his eyes away from his father to see Draco standing back at the bedroom door. Fuck, he should have heard the git walking up the creaky stairs of Grimmauld Place. He couldn’t decide whether to be annoyed by his stealth or impressed with it.
“Yeah, that's one way to put it.” He choked out a half-laugh before turning serious again. “Harry, what are you thinking?”
Hermione smiled. “He does, he’s just owned up to them.”
He took a deep breath and stared straight into Draco’s eyes—which, right now, were the haunting grey of the sky just as a storm clears. But they were also wide and and deliberately inviting, as if Draco were just waiting for Harry to begin.
“Our minds were linked for quite a while.” Harry’s face was bright red now. “Once he realised that he turned it against me, but . . . well, that link remained a factor in the war.”
Draco bit back a sigh of frustration. “I'm not a submissive. Serving a life debt is a completely different—”
"A lot of people will disagree with you on that. There's this little mark I've got on my arm . . ."
“Serving as a therapy pet, apparently.”
"Long day, yeah?"
Well, there was nothing for it. He’d have to ring Draco back and apologise for the teasing. Then he would have to find out what happened and calm his lover down a bit.
“That’s good, Draco. Really good.”
“Good, good. I look forward to hearing about your experiences there on the way to Heathrow. You learned something of muggle life in the States, I believe?”
Harry moved to grab Draco by the scruff of his neck—but Draco was fast enough to counter with a real bite to his hand. A sharp, stinging bite that drew blood.
"What?" Harry gaped at him. "No, I don't know that. Neither of us know that."
“We are giving him a chance. That’s why I’m driving him to Heathrow.”
Harry was about to grumble something more—until Draco's words suddenly and startlingly sunk in. He bolted up and practically leapt out of bed.
“You didn’t tell me you were summoning a house elf here! You just whinged about the house being too much work for you and Kreacher—”
But, in the end, he would have died undercover if Harry hadn’t intervened. And there was a target on his back now. And, for all his changes, Draco was still, er, Draco. So if he was willing to answer to Harry’s best friends, so much the better.
He didn't actually add 'as well he should,' but Harry was sure the unspoken words were intended.
"Oh, we can do better than to bet money." Draco looked thoughtful. "If I'm right, the end of this date won't be platonic."
The smirk turned into a scowl. "What? Not keen?"
"What do you mean?" Draco's voice was suddenly sharp.
Harry smiled too, but he tightened his grip on Draco's wrist. "At that point, I couldn't figure out how to get into the room and see what you were up to. But I also knew you couldn't afford to get caught in there. I knew you'd be hiding and squirming for as long as I stayed on the other side of the wall."
People were perched at their desks all around him, typing frantically on their keyboards as they spoke on their phones in American English, spewing jargon that Harry vaguely recognised as financial. More people rushed past him, carrying paperwork in one hand and their pagers in the other.
Shit. So he was on about that again. "I think it's your power trip that we're not done talking about."
"Ron!" Granger sounded outraged by whatever was on the tip of her husband's tongue.
Ron snorted. “Ah, prejudice against muggles and muggle-borns is a form of racism.”
Harry watched as Draco followed Ron out of the room; they were off for a chess match downstairs. Two, probably, if they didn’t spend an hour reviewing the first one. They were becoming more and more serious about playing: Harry had caught them notating their last game.
But Bill shouldn't think of it—of him—as an animal. This was obviously Draco Malfoy, ferret animagus and, according to Ron, not only Harry's servant, but his boyfriend too.
“Right.” Ron rolled his eyes. “Look, Dad, Draco is Harry’s servant. That was his own choice. And sometimes he chooses to listen to me too, that’s all.”
She turned to Jamie, who offered her a shrug. Apparently Jamie agreed with Draco's assessment.
“Er, yes. But that’s expected in American synagogues. I might have gotten carried away once or twice—especially as one of the very few political conservatives in this shul—but it’s all part of the culture, I assure you.”
The best place to talk turned out to be Hermione's cramped office at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Harry collapsed into one of the two chairs in front of her desk. Then he reached for Malfoy's arm in order to tug him into the other one.
But Draco shook his head. "I want to see if you reach the same conclusion I did. I doubt the twats at the ministry will. Except maybe Robards and Shacklebolt—we'll see."
“Harry . . . Harry, you can't be serious.” That was Granger. Draco wasn't facing her, but he reckoned she was wide-eyed and outraged now. “You didn't transfigure him!”
“How likely am I to figure out the next password?”
“Ah, but you are?” Harry asked.
Ron grinned. “If I have, it’s not your problem. Your only job right now is to survive the ride to Heathrow with my father.”
“Yes.”
“Malfoy, don't fall asleep.”
“Yeah, I tried to. He shut me down and kicked me out of his head.”
“Going to see your parents. I need to talk with them.”
“God, no.” Draco’s tone was half contemptuous and half soothing. “I’ve switched about my memories and codes since that time, I promise. Focus, Harry.”
Malfoy turned to stare straight ahead. “When is this supposed to happen?”
Harry smiled. “Yeah, yeah. That was one of your more complete victories.”
Draco actually smiled, something he hadn’t done all evening. “It’s in New York—well, New Jersey, actually. But, trust me, I don’t have to go all the way to Tel Aviv to find some unrest. I can get myself blown up anywhere.”
Potter laughed too. "Good. Because this is—fuck, this is really good."
"All right, then. Guess I'll warn Draco now."
They were in the sitting room at Grimmauld Place. Harry was seated on the small, two-person couch. Draco was lying on it with his head on Harry's lap, his knees up over the arm, and an I-told-you-so smirk on his face.
Any other time Harry would have been equally delighted to see his old friend, despite that last disastrous visit. But not now. Not here. Nonetheless, he forced a smile onto his face as he looked Hagrid over.
Nonetheless, Draco managed a shaky nod. "Thank you. That sounds . . . lovely."
“But you didn't? I mean, we joked about you calling Skeeter . . . .”
Harry shrugged. “He said he couldn't go to you about this. You don't respect the idea in the first place.”
“I still think you ought to let me return the favour.” Harry reached out and smoothed his hair, because anything that messy looked wrong on a Malfoy.
Draco stared at him for a moment, as if weighing something in his head. Finally he shrugged again. “I can’t apparate.”
“Yeah. There’s a Hebrew term for that, actually.”
"Women in our society—who presumably, by and large, also love their parents—give up their family names all the time, you know."
“It’s fine; no magic required. We’ll just clean the wounds properly. Then I expect you back in ferret-form; you need your nails trimmed.”
Ron spoke up again before Harry could answer. "It isn't, though. No one's forcing Malfoy."
“From digging into my memories?”
Draco bit his lip. He had known from the start that he would have to give Weasley something. Besides, it might be prudent to judge his reaction, as Harry’s would likely be similar.
“Exactly,” Jamie agreed. “So where do you suggest?”
“I expect you not to bite me in your animagus form!” Harry rolled his eyes. “That’s all I’m asking. I’m pretty sure there are a lot more requirements for sainthood.”
Shit. Harry had forgotten she was there.
“I wouldn’t object to that. In fact, I wish we had more of them in the wizarding world.”
That was worth a triumphant grin. “You never could fight without magic.”
“Somewhat, yeah.”
“But you do.” Harry refused to back down. “Vote in muggle elections, that is.”
“No, it wasn’t suited to it. The camels really wouldn’t have worked.”
Harry ignored that, thinking back over the past few days. When he’d rescued Draco, when they apparated to the ministry, even when they’d apparated to and from the gate at Malfoy Manor . . . each time Draco had side-alonged.
Harry opened his mouth, but no words came out.
"Yeah?"
“Draco and I can celebrate privately, you know. Or just with you lot. And Shira and Jamie. I don’t have to go.”
“All right.” Draco selected a chair—one that was near Bill but not too near—and, after lifting the legs of his trousers, sat down stiffly. “Where do you want me to start?”
"We're not friends."
“Okay.” Harry took a deep breath. “That's fair. But at least tell me this: do you want us to work out? Do you want to be with me long-term?”
“Kasher it.” Draco’s voice was toneless. “Make it kosher, that is. That will keep Jamie happy.”
“Yes.” To Harry’s astonishment, Draco’s face lit up. “I’m strongly tempted to go for a true rococo feel—this house would take to it perfectly, don’t you think? Just look at the chandelier above us. There would be brilliant lighting throughout this room if we restored it and fixed the mirrors, which are obviously rococo themselves. And imagine a toile de Jouy wall covering. There’s hope even for this table, honestly . . . .”
“Yeah. That’s my plan.”
He was obviously being as vague as possible, but Draco decided not to push him. Harry was too skittish at the moment. “All right. But whatever this link was, it didn’t constitute proper training in legilimency?”
Draco's eyebrows shot up. "Pet?"
"I'm thinking that you seem—I dunno. More comfortable in your own skin?"
But Harry was having none of it. “You’ll be welcome, Draco, I promise.” He put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hagrid’s a grown man and a teacher. He’s not going to hold a grudge about the stupid shit you did or the stupid shit you believed as a teenager.”
This conversation seemed to open his eyes and make him realise that there were opportunities in the muggle world, even for wizards. That the muggle world could be a place where even a wizard could build a life.
Draco, meanwhile, had successfully penetrated the shirt by sacrificing a button up near the collar. He had even turned himself around, temporarily, so he could peek out the top of the garment, facing Harry.
"Right," Ron agreed.
“I’m not sure that was possible by that point,” Harry said softly. “Besides—look, he’s happy now. All the pressure is off: Voldemort is dead. Robards has no more power over him. And I mean to keep him and his family safe.”
->*<-
“Not officially, but they might have suspected.”
“I dunno if—Harry, I need time to think this through. And I don’t even know if you’re religious. Did those muggles bring you up to be a proper Anglican? Or a proper anything else?”
“No.” Potter remained standing. “I need to know—did you contact the Daily Prophet about the life debt between Draco and me?”
“Yeah, but I reckon Harry's okay with it." Ron shifted to look down at Draco. “What's this about, though? I know you’d have converted to marry into the Baumgartens. But that’s—well, it's not likely now, is it?”
“What can you do here?” he demanded over his mobile. “The healers haven’t woken Father yet. He’s still in that magical stasis.”
“Good. I mean . . . I just don't want him to take advantage—”
Harry left Draco alone for a good hour after their little—what should he call it? It didn’t seem serious enough to be a fight. Draco was just being prickly and melodramatic and . . . well, he was just being himself, really.
“Yes, Mother. Shira already invited me.” He nodded at Harry. “The Baumgartens are an old American wizarding family.”
In that case, Draco would retain some dignity by excusing himself from the wretched hovel. He would find out if McGonagall was willing to see him; he wanted to speak with another animagus. Failing that, well, he owed Myrtle a visit.
“Draco—”
"There was nothing religious about taking the dark mark," he continued, "And no religious ideology amongst the Death Eaters. As far as I know, most were atheists—if they ever bothered to think about it."
"Yeah. I don't think I've ever been hugged so much in my life. But I like them, Draco.”
“Yeah.”
Harry blinked. "You would?"
“A muggle financial services firm, yes.”
“Of course we do,” Narcissa said in that posh, deceptively polite voice of hers. “As much as we would enjoy living in a wizarding bubble, Harry—is that short for something, by the way? Harold, perhaps, or Henry?”
“Well, I’ve no desire to make a career out of repairing near-hopeless magical items.” He paused and shifted again, pulling Harry a bit closer this time. “I’m not sure I want to be a homemaker, though. It’s a possibility, but there’s something else I’d like to explore first.”
“Yes.” Harry tore his eyes away from the window and looked back at him. “But we can’t spend our lives talking around it.”
Could Draco even cast a patronus charm? It was a rare spell outside Dumbledore's Army and the aurors, but Robards should have made sure it was in Draco's arsenal before sending him into dangerous undercover work. If he didn't know the patronus charm, Harry would teach it to him. Even if he was free of working for Robards, anything could happen. And Draco was, well, Harry's responsibility now.
"Casting you in the light of the oppressor? That should be fun." There was a sudden gleam in Draco's eyes. "Maybe I should call Skeeter—just think of the stories I could make up about you this time."
He had worn a mask all through school, then. Draco had never really been the bully he pretended to be. It was much more likely that he'd been attempting to emulate his father.
Hermione stared at him, and then, despite her mouth contorting as she tried to keep that disapproving look on her face, broke into a laugh. “I suppose that shut him up.”
“Awesome make-up sex?”
"Well, it was an unauthorised rescue."
But Harry did understand, sort of. He knew those three years must have been the making of Draco, because he had changed during them. No, that wasn’t fair. Maybe some of those changes had started earlier. Maybe he had dropped some of his prejudices earlier. And some of his cruelty.
Right. These were Draco’s private memories. He wasn’t willing to share here, except for the ones connected to Dobby.
"Of course, but so what? So is Shira."
“Benjamin and I are bringing them to the airport in a bit. We’re picking them up in Hoboken. Which is apparently an adventurous place for a car to go.”
Draco took Toffee’s hand and nodded at everyone in the room as they left. Toffee, meanwhile, performed a little curtsey on her way out the door.
When Harry finally spoke up, his voice was warm enough, if a little flat. “Hagrid,” he said, “You don’t have to like him. But Draco is, um, important to me, you know? I won’t bring him round your home again. Not unless you say it’s all right. But you’ll see us together a lot and, well, please be civil to him.”
->*<-
“I’m not discussing this.”
“Potter, what are you doing?”
Too late. His white-blond hair transformed into white-blond fur. It happened so fast that Harry scarcely noticed as Draco scrambled onto his lap.
“Pretty sure ‘boyfriend’ is a better term to use around mum and dad,” Ron muttered.
“No.” Robards was in charge of the operation. Harry's own boss.
“We're both subs.”
“Which is not true.”
Hermione, meanwhile, was looking curiously at Draco. “Do you actually like this furniture?”
Suddenly flashes of Manhattan filled Harry’s head. For a few seconds he was standing on a pier opposite this city, looking up at the Twin Towers instead of out from them. He was squashed between Shira and Jamie, shaking his head in disbelief and going on and on about how ugly the towers were, objectively speaking. How shoddy the architecture was—just two long, narrow boxes.
Ron was off the bed and on his feet now too. He positioned himself next to Draco to—to what exactly? His father wasn’t about to attack Draco. All the same, Ron felt better taking a protective stance.
“Ron!” Granger glared at him.
“So Robards . . . he sent you out into the field without you knowing how to apparate to safety? And without you being able to send your patronus with a message or a plea for help?”
"Far from it. You know that."
“And the veins of their ancestors—don’t forget that.”
“Harry, then,” she continued smoothly. “That bubble is not our reality. Muggle politics affect all of us.”
“Graceful as ever, Potter.” Draco’s voice was dripping with sarcasm.
With that he stood up, nodded at everyone, and sauntered downstairs.
“Next page,” Harry said. “And don’t worry. It’s just about you registering as an animagus. And there’s, ah, another picture.”
Granger, meanwhile, was setting down her briefcase and pulling a pile of paperwork out. “I think I’ll go down to the dining room to work on this. Draco, there’s another article in there about you.”
“Well, Kreacher has seen their flat,” Bill said in a judicious tone.
“Perfect!” Weasley was all enthusiasm. “There won’t be any reporters waiting at his hut.”
"Yeah, that's it."
"The information dried up," Potter went on. "I assumed that Robards had pulled the agent out. Which was fine—it's what he should have done. But I overheard . . . well, the details don't matter. I found out our agent was still there. I couldn't imagine how he had kept his cover. And then, after, um—"
“Oh.” Harry blinked and forced himself to sit up. “Sorry. Feels earlier. Must still be jet lagging.”
He arranged himself cross-legged on the bed, somehow looking elegant as he did so. "Morning, Potter. Sleep well?"
But Draco had to endure a private conversation with his father. The man had made it clear that he did not believe Draco's relationship with Harry was platonic. He was willing to make his peace with that, so long as Draco still made a respectable marriage and still produced heirs.
“Good game.” Weasley looked Draco in the eye. “Even if your mind wasn’t on it.”
"Not yet."
“But—”
“Just what I said. He kept telling me to clear my mind, but he never bothered teaching me any sort of meditation or anything. Didn’t even send me off to the library for a book on it.”
“No, Harry, I didn't. But whoever did might have done us a favour.”
"There's no official exchange rate, so—" Draco broke off. Then he sighed and lowered his voice. "Look, I have plenty of quid. And it's all yours now anyway."
“You don’t understand, Benj,” Harry sighed.
Hermione caught his eye again and gave him a questioning look.
“Mostly he was pressured and coerced,” Harry said at last.
Hagrid stared.
"I know what you mean." He kept up the massage, working his way toward Harry's lower back. "You're worried about the fallout if Skeeter publishes the truth. And what will happen if the public discovers just how you came to pull my arse out of the fire again."
"Which means resting, not driving to Hoboken and then back to Newark Airport."
"And then left you to die?"
Harry looked down at Draco, who chuffed at him in a pleading sort of way.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You're going to be sick of me come September, don't you know that?"
Granger, Draco noticed, did not harp on slave labour or freeing house elves in front of Kreacher; she thanked him politely instead. Just as well. The idea of freeing house elves was ludicrous enough without forcing it on a traditionalist like Kreacher.
There was a flicker of surprise in his Dad’s eyes. And a flicker of hurt. “Well, I hope Harry will be patient. This is a new relationship for him—very new.”
Malfoy didn’t even hesitate. “Yeah.”
Draco did that thing with his eyebrows again. "Could you be more of a sap?"
His boyfriend rolled his eyes with a pained, disbelieving look. "When you arrive, Potter. Which airport when you arrive?"
“None who sent their kids to Hogwarts.”
He reached out and squeezed her hand. “You never have to.”
Harry squinted his eyes, tried (unsuccessfully) to bite back a yawn, and spoke with a casual sympathy. “Um, okay. Any particular reason?”
“But don’t you feel—I mean, isn’t it draining to be like this?”
Harry cringed at the change of subject. “Er, no. I haven’t unpacked yet, sorry.”
“Draco.” Harry put a warning note in his voice.
“Arranged marriage?” Suddenly Hermione sounded wide awake.
Draco smiled at that, apparently forgetting how annoyed he was with his lover. “No. I imagine they're tutored in magic at home—and I don’t think they even call it magic. But I reckon Kreacher knows who to speak with.”
He was testing the waters here. Hermione had never said what she thought of the ruthless way their old headmaster had used school children. And not just Harry.
Instead Harry turned back to Toffee. “Would you go and help Kreacher, please? He might need a hand with breakfast.”
With that, Draco ushered Ron’s father out the door. Hermione followed him, but Ron grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him further inside.
Fuck. Potter was about to blow his cover.
Harry refused to feel any shame. “Yeah. For now.”
“It will hurt your chances of advancement!” Draco was rolling his eyes now; Harry could tell. “The Americans set up these meetings just for a chance to meet you. You’ll have to stay put and play diplomat.”
"Not nearly," Ron said. "When duty calls and all that."
“I don't care!” Fuck, was he shouting? Where had he even found the energy?
Harry furrowed his brow. "Fair point. So, er, how did it go between you and Arthur?"
"Good. You can start by telling us just what you ferreted out of that hidey-hole before we escaped the explosion."
“Right.” Harry turned back toward the window. “Imagine flying a broom this high? One time, during the war, Moody—the real Moody, I mean—took us up so high that . . .” He let his voice trail off as he remembered the circumstances.
“Draco?”
“Right.” Harry sighed. “So we’re just going to lie here, then?”
The prospect of an afternoon with Hagrid did not fill Draco with joy. But this visit, he reminded himself, was for Harry’s sake. Harry clearly wanted him to get along with the oaf, so Draco would oblige.
“Hey,” Harry said, keeping his voice soft as he answered.
“So this life debt.” Shira was looking straight at Draco now. “You're both serious about it?”
"It's all part of the life debt I owe our master, Kreacher." Draco was obviously enjoying this. "And I'm not signing my fortune over to him, I'm merely adding him to my accounts. He can draw on them when or if he pleases. Or order me to support some worthy cause, if he must."
“I’m glad to hear it.” His father’s voice was gentle now and not particularly judgmental. But it was also careful. “I don’t pretend to know whether Draco’s change of heart is genuine, but I hope it is. Just remember that he might have learned a thing or two from his father. Lucius is quite good at putting on masks for personal gain.”
“Come here,” Bill said at last. “I'm not angry with you. As far as I'm concerned you made up for your time as a Death Eater by serving the aurors afterward.” He paused again. “But I do have a few questions.”
"Merlin, no more politics." Harry elbowed Draco. "And remember, that personal fortune of yours belongs to me now. I can make sure you use it for good causes."
“Yeah, but they’re all simple. Don’t use words like ‘mudblood.’ Don’t insult the Weasleys—”
And somehow she was standing between the two men, who both looked more than willing to hurl unforgivable curses at one another—and both were perfectly capable of it. She, for one, understood that Harry Potter was not the saint everyone thought he was.
“True,” she said. “Except that you did learn to suffer in silence, from our sixth year until the end of the war.” She paused. “ At least some of the time.”
It was official now: Harry had gone mental. “You know what he said about Hermione back in school. And he poisoned me once. Almost killed me. You remember that too, yeah?”
“Yeah, I got that. And, actually I'm okay with it, as long as you promise to treat him like a house elf.”
“Right. Shall we see what that thing wants?”
"Oh." Harry felt his face turn hot with embarrassment as he turned back to the note. "Er, looks like John F. Ken—"
Harry should have realised, though. If he were a better boyfriend, he would have done. So much was happening at home: Harry’s job taking him all the way to the States, Draco’s private chat with Arthur Weasley, Shira and Jamie arriving, Ron and Hermione staying on at Grimmauld Place . . . which of those had set Draco off?
Draco rolled his eyes and made a muffled noise.
“Right. And he risked you accidentally killing Ron and Katie in your idiotic attempts to assassinate him.” He hesitated. “Ron’s the one who worked out all that about Dumbledore, actually. He’s not so fond of the man’s memory anymore.”
Harry laughed again and put all thoughts of life-debts and confessions out of his head. Plenty of time for that horror show tomorrow. Right now, the warmth of Draco's skin and the cool-yet-aroused look in his grey eyes reminded him that they still had so many new things to try together. And Harry had the remainder of the night to make a dent in that particular list.
Harry was staring at him, he realised. There was a puzzled expression on his face, as if he were trying to work out what Draco was thinking. Fortunately, he didn't ask. He just interlaced their fingers as they vacated the cinema.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “That must keep him highly motivated to please you.”
“What?” Draco didn’t bother to hide his outrage. “You’re bluffing.”
But this was a first. Harry had ever seen Draco like this: grey eyes narrowed, not in judgment, but in a combination of curiousity and concentration. His entire body tense with focus as he paid heed to each word Harry spoke.
Draco snorted. "We're still not discussing kink. Not at the moment."
After a moment, Draco took it. Not only took it, but pulled Harry into a hug as well. Harry didn’t fight him.
“Does Ginny know that Harry and Draco are, er—”
“Draco?”
He hadn't even seen Draco since his trial, three years back. Until earlier today, he had stupidly believed that he was avoiding London and the British wizarding community. That he was traveling to places like Paris. And New York. And Buenos Aires.
“Depends. Have you committed any crimes he doesn’t already know about?”
He didn’t hold anything back; the name Malfoy didn’t mean as much to her as it did to Britain’s magical community, so she was less inclined to judge their relationship. And she didn’t bat an eyelash at the fact that Harry was involved with another man. Instead, she agreed that the diplomatic meetings could wait—as long as Harry was willing to reschedule them.
“Your hair smells like petrol. And my ears are still ringing. And my back is killing me.”
That shut Potter up, at least for a few seconds. "She's . . . she's a lesbian?"
“Yeah, your life is rough.” He leaned forward and planted a light kiss on Draco’s mouth. “Now listen, I’m not going to find another witch or wizard. And I’m not going to get tired of you. And we are in a relationship. I promised your parents I’d keep it quiet for now, so we don’t have to deal with the Prophet finding out about that too, but I also told them there’s no way I’m letting you go through with this arranged marriage—”
“Yes.” Her quill was floating in front of her now, scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment. “How interesting, then, that he waited until this last rescue to call in the life debt.”
Bill hesitated and then placed a brotherly hand on his shoulder. “Just remember, Harry. They are friendly with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.”
“Is that so?” she managed.
“What are you lot doing back here?” Draco stepped into the hallway and kicked the door closed behind him. Draco wanted no further objections from Harry on anything unwearable. And Kreacher, no doubt, could just apparate out.
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but changed his mind. Instead he settled for a stiff nod.
“Compartmentalising like that. Draco reviews all his memories and decides which he wants to lock away somewhere in his mind. Even now, when he’s not under any threat.”
“Nothing, it’s just that—well, if you and Shira had kids, they’d be Jewish, right?”
"Right." Harry bit back a grin as he decided not to introduce Draco to the possibly condescending term 'chick-flick.'
"Wait. You drove?"
It was such a mindfuck, though. This was Draco Malfoy, who tormented him for years—sneering the whole time, except when he was laughing at someone. Yet here he was, content to go on and on about the dining room’s potential.
"No." Harry pushed himself up a little, his anger getting the best of him. "Look, Robards deserves to be exposed. He had no right to leave you to die like that!"
“That’s a ridiculous idea!” She was sitting up again. “I’m glad they refused.”
Draco's chief weapon, really, had always been words. He'd always had a clever, cutting tongue. And a cruel one. In fact, the lyrics of one particularly insulting and ironic song were no doubt his brainchild.
"Well, yes. I'm not saying there aren't obstacles. But that’s beside the point. They don’t compare to you, although if you get yourself killed in some auror raid—”
“Hear me out.” She swallowed. “Because you both acknowledge this life debt, Harry has considerable power over you. He wouldn’t purposely abuse it—”
Draco sat down again, adjusting the legs of his trousers as he did so. "Saint Potter is pouring out his righteous anger on my behalf. When I left, he was threatening to expose the way Robards blackmailed me into becoming an agent."
He let go of Draco's wrist. "So your father. You don't, ah—"
That was true; Weasley was a bit of an awkward listener, but a good one nonetheless.
"I might just," Draco retorted, following him out of the room. "The Prophet has been fawning over your arse for far too long now."
Draco shrugged. “Why stop at my nails? You might as well behave as a proper pet owner.”
“No, Kreacher. I’ll talk to Robards myself.”
“Are you sure?”
Harry managed to move his shoulder enough to nudge him with it. “Let’s not keep score.”
Draco laughed, sounding much more relaxed. “If character means ‘in a constant state of disrepair,’ I suppose so. Shira loves that house—says it’s so peculiar that it must, at some point, have been owned by other wizards. But there’s no evidence of that.”
“Hermione’s going to say it’s slave labour. How am I going to explain this to her?”
Most importantly, Draco's parents were satisfied. They had swallowed their pride and agreed to sign over a life interest in Malfoy Manor to Harry. The paperwork would take time, but Draco was fairly sure they would keep their promise to see this through. The manor was too vulnerable to seizure without Harry's protection. And they seemed to take Harry's word that he would not try anything underhanded—that the property would be left to Draco's heirs.
“No, but you shouldn’t have been so polite.”
He stared at her. “When have you known me to suffer in silence?”
“Dunno; you’re a decent player. So what’s eating you, Ferret?”
But Draco didn’t give them up. He tugged back instead, sparking a wrestling match that Harry won easily. It took all of thirty seconds to pin the git to the bed.
Although their dresses were shorter and rather less modest, Hermione thought, than an actual Victorian woman’s would have been. That wasn’t a bad thing, of course. Hermione admired their ensembles, though she couldn’t imagine flying across the Atlantic in them.
Draco shot him a suspicious glance as he turned the page. Harry had turned bright red when he mentioned the picture. A second later, Draco understood why. It was almost sickeningly sweet. He was in ferret-form, curling up in Harry’s arms and gazing up adoringly at him. Harry was smiling down at him before looking up at some ministry employee.
Harry leaned forward and planted a kiss on his forehead. "You're not ruined, Malfoy."
Potter grunted. “Maybe we've turned a corner in our relationship. Bet he's cross with me, though, for outing him as an agent.”
“And this is news to you?” Draco scoffed. “Really, Potter?” He tightened his grip again, pulling Harry’s back even closer to his chest.
“I know.”
Fuck. That answer shot straight to Harry’s groin. “Er, what did you have in mind, then?”
"Salazar help me." But Draco was more smiling than sneering now. "That only applies if you've kept up your part of the deal."
"He's agnostic," Shira said with a huff. "Not that it matters, but there are a million other reasons he shouldn't convert to anything."
Draco felt an infuriating mixture of anger and guilt and panic rising in his gut—and then he caught a whiff of wolf. So the other Weasley was Bill, and it was really better that Draco be anywhere else in the world but here. He needed to break loose or transform or something . . . .
“No. They might be pure-bloods, but they’re not as moronic as my family.”
"Not really what I'm looking for. So while I was snogging Ginny, were you shagging Pansey? Or, Merlin, was it Blaise?"
His tone was reasonable. Annoyingly reasonable, and Harry was in no mood for it. “When I see Robards—”
Hopefully Ron and Hermione would see the difference too.
Her forehead crinkled. "So you think you can legally finagle a way to transfer the property to Harry before the Ministry can seize it."
Harry did push away from him this time. And he opened his eyes as he spun around to face Draco.
Harry cocked his head at him. “Why? You don’t dislike this place, do you?”
“Picked it up from Shira and her family, did you?”
"You were in the Room of Requirement, secretly fixing that cabinet. I scared Goyle off guard duty, but he was noisy about running away. So you must have known someone was just outside the room."
“How is Shira?” Lucius asked. “You’ve been in touch, obviously, since your return?”
“I don't believe that—”
"That's a massive job at Grimmauld Place, actually." Harry looked thoughtful and a little apprehensive. "Before you start, I need you to figure out exactly what, um, interesting items are still there, what they're supposed to do, what they actually do, and whether they can be salvaged."
Harry stared at him for a moment. A long moment. Then he used his hand to bat Draco’s finger away before placing it back on his shoulder, pinning him again. “Wait. You get to say it, but I don’t?”
His dad raised his eyebrows. “It sounds as though Draco will have quite a bit of company.”
"Yes you are!"
“You must.” She paused to put her hands on her hips. “I notice you and Ron didn’t bring any paperwork home.”
Draco finally sank into a chair. “All right. But there’s something else we need to discuss.” He paused again, this time to look over at Toffee.
“Do any of them involve Dobby?”
“Yes. I was . . . I was rather surprised at the feeling myself.”
“You could learn a thing or two from muggles, ill-bred or not.” Harry leaned down and kissed him. “No more stealing covers.”
A murderer, Harry wanted to say. That’s what Lucius was, whether or not he ever got his own hands dirty. No point in saying that out loud, though.
"Fine. Then tell me what else this is about."
“Can’t say I blame him. Though I suppose it’s just as well that his memory is a blessing for you.”
Draco didn’t know how to reply, so he simply nuzzled his nose against Harry’s neck, as if he were in ferret-form.
Draco actually laughed at that. "I wouldn't mind, if it’s all right with Harry. So, ah, we’ll talk?’
Harry scratched him behind his ears, as if he were in ferret form. "I'm aware. Which is why we need to break your nipping habit."
"No." Draco sounded almost regretful. "It didn't break."
“Why the fuck didn’t you do it right after the trials?”
Harry coughed a little to hide the fact that his head was spinning. An arranged marriage? To an American witch? Somehow he pictured the Malfoys insisting on an English pure-blood. A nominally Anglican one.
The Prophet had carried the story about the rescue. The Auror Department—advised by PR types, probably—had led the public to believe that Harry had been acting under orders when he rescued Malfoy. Robards couldn’t admit that he’d left an agent to die, or that Harry had risked his life to save said agent without permission. Hell, Harry shouldn’t have known who the agent was or where he was being held.
Benjamin was silent for a moment, his face grim. “It doesn’t matter. Yeah, you should regret the stuff you did. But the regret, by itself, doesn’t help anyone. It’s not productive.”
But that was to be expected. When had Draco ever managed to impress his father?
Harry ignored that too. “You worked for Robards as a spy.”
“It's serviceable.” He shrugged. “It's from the ministry, courtesy of  Robards. Olivander won't sell a wand to any Malfoy now. Why?”
"Possibly." Harry thought back to the Sorting Hat.
Nonetheless, Harry seem flabbergasted. “Buckbeak? That’s not the same thing—” Somehow he stopped himself from finishing that sentence. He swallowed instead before continuing. “Look, I love Buckbeak. You know that. And Draco was wrong for what he almost let happen to him. Completely wrong. But Draco was only fourteen.”
Lucius snorted. “You’re pleased to have your childhood enemy under your thumb, Harry. Don’t pretend otherwise.”
Harry snorted. “He’s prejudiced against blood traitors, remember? I doubt he admires me.”
She didn’t dispute that. “What does this have to do with you overstepping?”
"No." Draco felt his lips curving into a soft smile. "Potter—and that hero complex of his—rushed in to save the day, of course."
It didn’t have to wait long. There was a rumble beneath them and then the whole place started shaking. Draco’s grip on Harry—they were still holding hands—tightened. He didn’t let go until the shaking stopped.
"He's right, Granger. I am an adult." Draco hesitated. "And I do owe you both."
"Shut it, Ferret." Ron's voice was firm, but not angry. "Now come here."
“Yeah. I wish you hadn’t put it to that use, but—well, you heard Bill. Even he’s impressed with your spells and your craftsmanship.”
Hermione, who had been suspiciously quiet until that moment, gasped out loud. "Harry, no! You two are talking about . . . ." She stopped and shook her head. "This life debt sounds as bad as what the wizarding world does to house elves."
Harry seemed to take their words seriously, because he turned to Draco with an apologetic smile. “I know you and Hagrid didn’t get on back at Hogwarts. But—I’m really close with him. And I want him to know how much you mean to me. I know he’s not always discreet, but . . . look, I think he’ll keep this quiet.”
Harry let out a noise that was halfway between a chuckle and a cough. “Oh, um, that’s not a problem. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with—I mean, it’s not even my business!”
Malfoy favoured him with a thin, sour smile. “Keep insulting me all you like about that. You’re not going to break any bones of mine.”
“Draco, you're lying on top of me.”
“All right.”
Draco rolled over to face him. “No?” He traced the outline of Harry’s face with one finger. “I think you’ve got a thing for power imbalances.”
“Robards has made some more arrests,” Ron added at length. “That’s mostly thanks to you. So well done and all that.”
All right. Harry had to chuckle at his rough mixture of sincerity and exaggeration. But he still didn’t think Draco had a right to posthumously take Dumbledore to task.
"Yes, yes. That leaves you two up."
Draco leapt down and draped himself around Harry's shoulders. It was impossible not to smile at that, so Harry didn't bother trying to look stern.
"I'd argue, but I'm more interested in the fact that you just said 'we'—as if you were identifying as part of the ferret population."
Ron thought about it and then shrugged. He honestly didn’t care how Malfoy felt about the almost-marriage. The ferret had freely given Harry the right to run his life. End of subject.
Harry shot him a playful glare. “I suppose you have an important memory hidden here somewhere?”
Hermione sat down on the arm of the couch. "That's actually quite clever."
“And he went to Ron?”
"Shira.” There was a warning note in Jamie's voice. "I’m pretty sure Draco did this for me.”
Ron nodded as he stood up. “Come on, Ferret. Let’s go find McGonagall.”
Draco didn’t say anything.
“Despite the fact that he’s gay?” George asked.
All he got in reply was a noncommittal grunt.
Draco stared down at his hands and forced himself to take a deep breath. The temperature in the room, which a moment ago had felt cozy and comfortable, seemed to plummet.
“That was an order, Malfoy.”
Weasley scoffed. "Maybe you should stop flirting with Malfoy and tell us what's going on."
“I know his birth-name. A few of the histories mention it.”
But the ferret had only bought them a brief reprieve. Somehow Skeeter had sniffed out the scandal at the Auror Department, and nothing Harry, Hermione or Malfoy said was going to dissuade her from pursuing the story. Ron didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad one, but he wished it wasn't Skeeter.
He wasn’t invading anyone’s head right now, though. Draco had invited him in. And he was standing right here to guide him.
"For your information, there's no shame in a Malfoy paying his debts."
It seemed an even worse idea when Shira informed him, agog with curiousity, that she would never settle for just talking to the famed Harry Potter. No, she insisted on seeing him, so they had best set up a video conference on muggle computers.
Draco muttered something incoherent. He was probably back asleep.
"—And you've got your own brand of cruelty."
“Because I knew I’d probably be sacked for this! And I thought it'd be a simple extraction.” Potter kept stroking Draco as he talked. “They had figured out that Malfoy was a spy. He was magically restrained when I found him—but I swear, Ron, that was the only impressive magic they used. Their wards were shoddy, their . . . well, it doesn't matter now.”
Draco was perfectly capable of surviving a week without Harry, so that hadn’t set him on edge. And despite all the drama about familial expectations and arranged marriages, he’d been looking forward to seeing Shira and Jamie; he hadn’t been stressing over their arrival. And Draco seemed comfortable with Ron and Hermione, even accepting Ron, to some extent, as an authority figure.
"She tried to," Harry answered. "But Jamie wouldn't let her. We had a proper conversation instead, about—oh, all sorts of things. The fact that I shouldn't suffer any culture shock here, for instance."
She frowned. “Do you have charges that will stick?”
“No, let me finish. Malfoy’s parents brought him up all wrong. They indoctrinated him into all that pure-blood superiority and Death Eater bullshit. But Percy was brought up the right way. So what’s his excuse for siding with a corrupt ministry all that time—against his own family?”
Harry forced himself to gulp down a lung’s worth of air. “You’re fucking cruel, you know that? You’re pissed off because you think I insulted you. But I didn’t mean to, and you’re lashing out anyway.”
Weasley, meanwhile, was pestering Potter again. “Come on, Harry, what did you do? And how much are we going to have to hide from Robards? And what possessed you to get a look-alike Malfoy ferret?”
"Because—look, this isn't on you. I think, left to yourself, you'd always choose words over violence."
She refused to back down. “You two do have a history.”
“No! This . . . I don’t think it was a crime, because no money was ever exchanged. But it was certainly untoward. And Harry won’t like it. I don’t think he’ll judge me harshly, mind, but—”
"It's not pity—"
"Ah, Potter?"
He gave a prim little nod.
But he shouldn’t have worried. Whatever the man’s misgivings, his father was clearly determined to be polite. He even stepped forward with his hand outstretched. “Yes, we’ve met. I understand you’ve spent quite a bit of time in New York?”
Kreacher, somewhat to Harry’s surprise, nodded approvingly. “Yes, Master Draco. Shall Kreacher and Toffee arrange the third floor as a guest room for Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley?”
He gave Harry a look. "I've been waiting a long time to put you in proper clothes. There, you do look good in that colour. Brings out your eyes and all. I suppose nothing can be done about your hair?"
“Just—” Harry cut himself off to yawn again. “Just wish I knew why I’m so tired.”
"Of course not." She paused to kiss first Draco's head and then Ron's. "He can stay."
"Any particular reason you're holding the ferret's hand, 'Mione?"
"Yes."
“Bastard,” Harry muttered.
“Listen, I'm living with you now. We’re going to be seen together. Plus your rights to Malfoy Manor will be a matter of public record.”
But Harry wanted Ron and Hermione to, well, look after Draco. He knew it wasn’t really necessary; Draco was an adult who had taught himself how to reject his parents’ prejudices. Who had built a new life for himself in New York. Who had also survived for three years undercover. He was obviously capable of looking after himself.
The legilimency spell was broken. Draco had expelled Harry from his mind.
“But he must always have felt that connection.” Harry was quick to follow Hermione's lead. “You don't choose your animagus form, remember. It's always just been a part of you, don’t you think?”
“Well, then, that’s sorted. No arranged marriage for me. Unless you change your mind come September.”
"Were you imagining it smashing into me?"
But Hermione didn't commit herself. “Are you angry with Draco because of that?”
“I’m aware. But it's not so simple. And the reason behind it will upset Harry. I don’t want him haunted by this part of my past. I don’t want it in his head whenever we—”
“Harry? Are you still there?”
“Possibly, but I also suspect he’s far more ruthless than he lets on. Eventually, even muggles will notice.” Lucius paused. “Whether the Tories or the Lib Dems will have the wherewithal to take advantage of that remains to be seen.”
Harry took a gulp of his own wine before he remembered that he was supposed to be sipping it. He had no particular opinion on Blair or any other politician, muggle or otherwise, but Lucius was sounding as canny as ever. Did the man still have influence in the ministry, even after his fall from grace?
Some of Harry's own anger evaporated. “Draco, would you lie to me?”
“But that's where it's complicated, isn't it? I know you were acting under duress. And you weren't even of age at the time.”
“You could have had them! You could have had that time in Paris and New York and Buenos Aires and wherever else you went without being blackmailed and without putting your life at risk.”
“My parents would never accept adopted children or children by a surrogate.”
But Harry shook his head. “They’ll have to interview me for the investigation, won’t they?"
Draco snorted. “I know about two particular, quite eccentric Victorian Goths who are into BDSM. How well would that go over?”
“All right, all right. He’s a cute little fellow, though. Wait, is it a him?”
She chewed on her response. “I don’t know. I want Harry to be happy, but—”
->*<-
Once again, Hagrid struggled to form a response. He probably wasn’t keen to take a stranger for coffee, let alone a stranger who referred to Narcissa Malfoy as ‘Aunt Cissy.’ But he couldn’t seem to piece together a polite refusal.
"Or you can just, you know, not get yourself killed."
"No." Draco's voice was sharp. In fact, he looked a little abashed because of it. "You're right about me, Potter. I've always lived under someone's thumb—I'm used to it."
“Ron?” Both his father and Hermione were staring at him.
"Yeah." Draco blinked, allowing his mother's words to sink in. "He collapsed, but he's still breathing. I don't know what's happening. It sounds like heart failure, but—"
“I’m not. At least you won’t have any improper techniques to unlearn.”
"Draco was working undercover for Robards," Potter said. "He must have been at it for some time, because he was a proper agent—even became an animagus while he was in New York."
“It’s only what? Half ten there? Half eleven?” Harry asked. “Won’t she still be up?”
“He hid it well, then.”
“You know our master,” he chided the elf. “I’m bringing these things to a charity shop, remember?”
Narcissa favoured him with a sly grin. “Why, whether Potter is trainable, of course.”
“But that’s—” Draco shook himself and then clambered off the bed. He started pacing the room as Harry watched him. “I understand your difficulties with occlumency. It relies on an ability to compartmentalise. And you would hate that. You’re too . . . you’re a seamless whole, you know? You’re not the sort who would lock parts of himself away.”
Kreacher was on hand to give them each a bag with an onion bagel packed inside, prepared to taste. Apparently Granger preferred a prim amount of butter, Weasley liked his over-stuffed with traditional ‘lox and schmear,’ whilst Harry took egg and cheese.
“I know, Harry. It switched its allegiance to you.” He rolled his eyes. “Merlin, you were so fucking gentle when we both realised there was no point in me taking it back. I almost started hating you all over again.”
That left his private chat with Arthur. Harry sighed. Ron had probably been correct. There really was no way for that conversation to have gone well.
"Well, that's reassuring. You also have an appointment with Robards today. I want to be there when he thanks you for your services. Then we'll go register you as an animagus—you don't have an excuse to keep that hidden anymore."
“And you’ll tell us at once when he returns,” Draco continued.
“Oh.” Harry looked weirdly crushed on Draco’s behalf. “Of course, yeah. That makes sense.”
“So Malfoy’s the one who provided all that intelligence?” Weasley was asking. “And when you found out, you went to rescue him alone?”
Draco stared. “Not a good idea. If you're determined to go through with this, at least let me come—”
"He had better be in ferret-form."
So Harry stepped forward and tugged Draco into his arms, kissing him long and hard.
Draco snorted. “If I was, I must have been the least successful bully in Hogwarts’ history.”
Ron put an encouraging arm over his shoulder. “My dad just thought—well, seeing as you and Harry . . . .”
“What?”
“What the fuck, Draco? This was before Snape came to the rescue. Did you want to die?”
“We'll fix that,” Harry promised.
But he had no business risking his life for a ministry that didn't even value it.
“And I’m pretty sure you have more requirements for me.”
"No. You changing your surname to Potter might do the trick, though."
“Don’t bother sending her off next time. She’ll only eavesdrop anyway—they all do.”
She reached out and squeezed his arm.
“Come on.” He gave Malfoy a nudge with his elbow. “That’s partly why what?”
“That’s it, isn’t it?” Harry let out a snort of laughter, even though there was nothing funny about this. “What are you, Draco? A two year old testing his boundaries?”
The words, put like that, sounded casual and matter-of-fact. But Harry felt each one—no, Draco felt each one etch itself into his brain.
Skeeter raised her eyebrows “Does it? How friendly you make servitude sound.”
Harry pushed himself up and stared. Draco was standing over him, gloating. But he was also holding out his hand. Harry took it and allowed his nemesis-turned-boyfriend to pull him to his feet.
But Shira had somehow accounted for that. “Hagrid, you must know London. Please take me away from this place—I hate hospitals. And I need coffee that’s blacker than a dementor’s soul, or I will die. I will literally die.”
Draco made a chuffing noise. He couldn't imagine the powers-that-be promoting Harry from the field straight to the top, but perhaps an intermediate desk job would open up. Preferably for both Harry and Ron.
Draco grinned. “Don’t worry. I don’t expect your taste to be as refined as mine. You’ll prefer something more neo-classical, no doubt.”
Potter took that as permission to continue. "I didn't know about this. All I knew, as an auror, was that someone had infiltrated a neo-Death Eater cell. And they'd given us good information. We were able to make several arrests."
“That I could be a murdering bastard? That’s what you understood?” Harry clenched his fists again, furious with himself. “I was a stupid bastard, Draco. I would never have cast that if I’d known what it did.”
Of course. Harry knew his testimony had saved Draco and his mother from prison, but he'd always wondered how Lucius had kept his freedom after the war. Ratting out other Death Eaters had helped,  but it hadn't seemed enough.
Draco sighed as he sat up. "Fine, Harry. You want that much control? All right, then."
Harry groaned in delight. "Perfect. Keep going."
Malfoy shot him a venomous glance. "I don't care whether he wants it, Weasel. I care that he doesn't demand more than a life interest in it."
"Yes it is. And don't look at me as if I'm some down-trodden house elf in need of your activism. As your husband pointed out, I make out quite well from this deal."
Harry felt oddly shy as he changed back into yesterday's trousers and then waited, topless, for Draco to lend him a fresh shirt. Merlin, what was the matter with him? He'd changed in front of Draco last night without a second thought.
“I warned you this morning. You know, the first time I tried waking you up.”
“Oh, we parroted what you told us: that this is an agreement between two consenting adults. That there’s nothing legally or magically binding about it.” She paused. “We said it was all very friendly and respectful, on both your parts.”
The war was over. Voldemort was gone, permanently. Draco was safe in Grimmauld Place, in Harry's bed. And Harry himself was snoring softly at his side. Or had been, a moment ago. Now he was yawning and stretching his arms out toward Draco, looking to tug him closer.
“Yes!”
“You can’t—what do you mean?”
“Yes. Most old wizarding estates do. Ours are rather small, though.”
But Ron held onto the back of his neck, despite all of Draco's squirming and wriggling, and brought him in closer to his chest. “Easy, Ferret,” he whispered. “I think this will all go better if you stay right here and stick with your animagus form.”
"Hey!" Ron pretended to be offended, but ruined the effect with a grin of his own.
But she had gone to the Burrow to see her in-laws about something or other. Hopefully that had nothing to do with him. It shouldn’t have anything to do with him, but Draco couldn't quite shake the feeling that both Weasley and Granger were worried about how the rest of their clan would react to the former Death Eater who was now both Harry's servant and boyfriend.
Draco did that thing with his eyebrows. “I suppose, but don’t they have their own flat?”
“Presumably because he deserves a rest from said heroics.” Malfoy put a hand on Harry’s back. “Now if you’ll excuse us.”
“I did have to die. And Dumbledore knew it.” Harry smiled a little, knowing full well the smile was a bit sour. “You know Snape gave me his memories as he was dying?”
Draco, meanwhile, did not look much impressed. “It’s not my fault you haven’t initiated your lessons. And that lack of lessons has nothing to do with you trying to barge into a private memory of mine.”
“But,” she said, “I’ve never heard of any Death Eater—or former Death Eater—casting a patronus, have you?”
His boyfriend was still hesitating. But it didn’t matter; Harry had just figured it out for himself.
“Whatever it is, then. I still like it. It has character.”
He cleared his throat, breaking the silence that had engulfed the room. "You said you had conditions, Malfoy. Name them."
Harry gave him a look.
“Just what?”
Draco swallowed. “It wasn’t a lie.”
Fortunately Crookshanks was still ensconced in the flat—but Ron knew that if he and Hermione stayed longer than a few days at Grimmauld Place, Hermione would insist on him joining them. And how, exactly, would that work? Would that horror play nice with Draco’s ferret-form?
“Might have done.”
Potter made a strangled noise.
Hermione stared back and then found herself smiling again—something she seemed to be doing more and more often in Draco’s presence. But she had an excuse this time: she could remember him shamming and exaggerating various injuries at Hogwarts.
“I’m not worried.” Draco let himself fall backward on the bed, dragging Harry on top of him. “I hear you’re really good under pressure.”
“And, um—is marriage eventually in the picture?”
Bill stared at his youngest brother, who was holding a rather beautiful white-blond ferret in his arms. He seemed to be comforting the animal and holding it firmly in place at the same time.
“Harry, his parents—”
“Draco shared a flat with their eldest daughter whilst he was in New York,” Narcissa explained.
Ron laughed again as he picked up the button, pocketed it, and then scratched Draco behind the ears. “Burrowing. Right. Stupid question. And of course I would choose today to finally wear a proper shirt . . . Anyway, I won the first match, but Draco’s mind wasn’t really on it. He won the second one, though.”
Draco perched up, intrigued.
Harry narrowed his eyes at her. “He never wanted to be a Death Eater. Not really.”
“Trust me, this hasn’t felt like home for a long time.” Draco’s eyes seemed to look through him and straight into the past. “Not since that monster took control of it. I’ll visit my parents here, but I’d as soon live elsewhere.”
“We were, Arthur.” Hermione smiled. “And this floor—well, you can see it’s a suite of rooms now, really. Almost a flat, but without a proper front door. Harry and Draco had them fixed up for us. And I’m sure we have Kreacher and Toffee to thank too.”
Harry took Draco's wand back for the second duel. The hawthorne with the core of unicorn hair still seemed to recognise him as well. He'd been oddly comfortable using that wand ever since he took it off Draco—and not only because he had carried it against Voldemort.
Draco swallowed. He couldn’t imagine wanting to be inside that warped, sadistic mind. “Fuck, Harry!”
“Not long.” He pushed himself up a bit so that he could see Kreacher. “You served my great aunt? So this is the old Black place, is it?”
They fell quiet.
Ron laughed. “That true, Ferret?”
This was a terrible idea, but somehow Draco managed a nod. “That’s fine. You, ah, you should tell whoever you’d like, Harry. And if it gets out—well, it gets out. My parents will survive.”
The ferret paid him no mind, keeping his attention on George, who returned the favour. And then . . . then it was ludicrously difficult to describe what happened next. It all happened faster than even Bill, with his heightened wolf senses, could keep up with.
Draco raised his head to look up at him. There was a half-smile playing on his lips. “My romantic liaison, not my bit on the side. That’s better, surely?”
“Good.”
“No!” He still wasn't looking at her, and his face was bright red now. “Sweet Salazar, I’ve wanted him for years.”
"Yeah," Ron agreed. "So, anyway, you don't owe us any debt. You understand that, yeah?"
Ron snorted. “I like this obedient side of you, Ferret.”
"Ah, speaking of birthdays . . . ."
He let out a little chirrupy, chuckling noise as he nuzzled against Harry's neck. Perfect way to communicate his contentment. No way to say it in human form, really. Not without sounding like an utter sap.
Potter jumped in. "I don't think Draco's told you what crucial work he's been doing on behalf of the ministry and the aurors—"
“Why?”
“So, Malfoy. About your animagus form . . . .”
Kreacher bowed and then disapparated with a little pop. The tea mysteriously disappeared at the same time.
“Well?”
"That too. Robards wants to fire him for going rogue, but can you imagine how that would play out in the Daily Prophet?"
“Oh yes.” Draco’s voice was sour now. “Aboard the Hogwarts Express, of course. When you were using your invisibility cloak to spy on me. And Blaise. And Pansy. And—”
“But that was never my motivation—” she broke off and bit her lip. She couldn’t read Draco at all right now.
Oh, right. Those.
One thing Harry would say for Malfoy Manor: the guest room bed was the most comfortable thing he could imagine. He draped himself across it, still dressed in the shirt and trousers that Draco had deemed appropriate for the evening, and relished the feeling of sinking into a cloud that somehow gave just the right support.
Bill paused. He could feel Harry's eyes boring into him. And he could still smell Draco's fear.
On the other hand, Saint Potter here was the one who had risked his neck to save him, not Robards or Shacklebolt. And Potter wielded considerable influence. No one had forgotten his status as saviour.
“Look, whatever you decide about all this”—Harry waved his other hand, presumably indicating not only the shul but the whole question of conversion—”is all right with me. I’ll support you.”
Draco seemed to weigh that possibility. "Unlikely. They would be prime suspects. And they do like you a bit, you know, for saving me."
Shacklebolt. Of course. The wards here would only allow an owl from a close friend or high-ranking ministry official. “What does it say?”
Kreacher looked as if he were about to burst with pride from Draco's selflessness. "Master Draco is an honourable wizard who repays his debts! Only the most noble of pure-bloods understand—"
->*<-
"Wait! You won't have the heart to kick him out, will you?"
Harry finally smiled. “Yeah, that was rather brilliant of you, actually. If the aurors hadn’t been looking for me, I would have ended up back in London. But that’s not the point.”
"So you've made sure that Draco is no longer under Robards' thumb, Mr. Potter." Draco's father finally put his wine glass down.
Buttle? Was that seriously a word? Ron shook his head. "Well, she said you were sleeping . . . ."
Harry had no idea what he was doing. He had only called in this life debt because it seemed to mean something to Malfoy, not because he understood what it actually involved. With his luck, it was some ancient pure-blood tradition with a zillion protocols.
"I don't trust his judgment. Besides . . ." He paused to shrug. "I know what my father is, all right? And I know I'm like him, but—"
Privately, Draco doubted that. That oafish half-giant rarely seemed to put much planning into his lessons or exams. It was more a matter of his students surviving whatever dangerous monster had most recently captured his fancy.
Harry didn't seem to know how to respond, but he was clutching Malfoy's hand. And Malfoy was just standing there, sneering—as if a Weasley’s opinion about their relationship couldn't possibly matter. But he was clutching Harry's hand back, so he wasn't as calm and contemptuous as he was pretending to be.
Okay, Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Of course she does. All right, then. Kasher away.”
Draco shook his head. "No. I mean, I've benefited, obviously—"
“But that’s different—”
Yes. Yes, he absolutely was.
Perhaps. Harry stopped looking him in the eye as he continued his story. They were still sitting in the sanctuary of the synagogue, on steps that led up to a raised platform. Since they were side-by-side, Harry could look down the aisle, or even at the floor, without appearing rude or frightened.
Draco wished he could roll his eyes. Trust Potter to be a sap and have no shame about it. But that was rather endearing.
“You were forced to become one before you were even of age!” Harry stopped and took a deep breath. “Besides, the war’s over now. Hagrid knows that. So will you come?”
->*<-
“Do you not have eyes, Draco?” Hermione asked. “Harry’s rather attractive.”
"Tuesday."
“Umph! What the—”
“I can see that these neo-Death Eaters intend to manipulate our currency, but I don’t think I understand their plans as well as you do. I’ve never properly studied finances, and this requires a sound knowledge of both Gringotts and muggle banking—”
And now Draco was only alive, once again, thanks to Harry Potter. The chosen one was making a habit of saving him. Which meant that Draco was even further in his debt.
Draco nestled closer. “If you need to, I’ll be happy to listen.”
Draco swallowed. For Potter to say he didn't want to break up with him—that meant he considered them to be in a relationship? Which was fine with him, just . . . unexpected.
Draco kissed the top of his head in response. “So,” he said, “are you giving me my wand back?”
“Hagrid’s angry because he didn’t serve any time in Azkaban.”
But he shouldn’t have worried about that. He should have worried about the poisonous tongue of Rita Skeeter instead.
Shit! He moved to push Draco away, but Draco tightened his arms.
Still, he didn’t relish the idea of confessing his mistake tonight to Hermione. And he couldn’t quite explain why his stomach was churning at the thought.
Harry furrowed his brow; he couldn’t hear any background noise. Draco was somewhere in St. Mungo’s; he knew that much. Was he properly protected? The Malfoys had so many enemies . . . .
He left off ‘for anyone but Harry,’ but Ron still grunted at the unspoken words. Then he changed the subject. “You’re serious about seeing McGonagall, yeah?”
“Change back,” Harry ordered, “or I will throw you into that cage.”
“Don’t we all? Half of us probably have some form of—what do muggles call it? PTSD or something. But there’s no professional we can talk to about the trauma of surviving a wizarding war.”
It was, at least, much better than sleeping with Crookshanks on the bed. Draco burrowed and squirmed a bit, but he didn’t drape himself on anyone’s face.
“Dunno. I suppose I’m not immune to it.” His voice sounded judicious. And surprisingly honest. “But I never hated Harry for his Anglo-Indian grandparent, if that’s what you’re asking. Or Granger for whatever amount of African heritage she has.”
“He’s beautiful,” Granger said. “And look how attached he is to you. What's his name?”
Brilliant. Just brilliant.
Besides, Draco's reaction was more important than George's or Bill's. And he was giving Harry an odd look that somehow combined both longing and disbelief. At least until he tucked that look away and turned his expression neutral.
“Of course!” Hermione said.
Hermione sat down behind her desk as Ron took a seat on the edge of it. "Harry," he said, "have you still got a job?"
Harry grinned at the way his customary drawl had almost disappeared in the midst of his enthusiasm. Draco was bright red now. He was obviously embarrassed, but obviously sincere as well.
Hermione bit her lip, trying to squash a feeling of gratification. A great deal had changed over the past week. Draco clearly respected her husband now and had proven, in small ways, that he was willing to accept Ron's authority while Harry was away.
Ron shifted to pull her closer. “I like him better all subservient and repentant. Hell, right now I like him better than Percy.”
Hermione, meanwhile, was sinking into the ugly chesterfield with a crease in her brow, as if she were thinking about something else altogether. "This entire consult business is odd,” she said, proving that her mind was back on Shacklebolt’s note. “I suppose our Ministry wants you out of the country whilst the scandal plays out. It looks as though Robards will be forced to resign."
Harry smiled at the memory of that painting. “The Reuvin Rubin, right? Is that going to move here?”
"You're wrong." Harry swallowed. "I mean, there is a part of me that—but it doesn't matter. Everything you just said is wrong."
“I know, but they’re much more, er—
Harry raised his eyebrows. "This isn't the sort of thing I'd give you a time out in your ferret cage for, Draco."
“Planning to?”
“He must always have done; he's said before that he was jealous of the sort of friends I made.”
But it was not Harry on the line. Draco's eyebrows shot up at the sound of his mother's voice.
"Oh, the ministry's too smart to seize it under the pretense of reparations." Draco curled his lip. "They'll seize it because of our violations of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy."
Harry took his hand. “I won’t.”
“Of course. Your humble servant, et cetera.”
“He banished it, Master, to a spare room downstairs. Master Draco laid out Master’s clothes first.”
“Draco?” he tried. “Draco, come on.”
The owl gave him a despairing sort of look and then flew out the window.
Hermione finally found her voice. “Surely you realise that Harry can’t comment on an auror mission! Especially one that’s related to an ongoing investigation.”
Harry folded his hands in his lap after he finished the first course—ahead of everyone else, which probably wasn’t a good thing. But he wasn’t about to be caught with his elbows on the dining room table. Not at Malfoy Manor.
“I didn't call anyone from the papers.” He hesitated. “Why are you upset about this? I told you I wanted it public. You never said you minded.”
Draco nodded. “That was my most recent brief.”
“You’ve never been on a plane before, have you?” Draco’s voice was flat; he was clearly not happy to let Harry go.
“Right.” Harry yawned and placed his hand over those tapping fingers. “This isn’t a dangerous mission, Malfoy.”
"Don't throw those words back at me! This is different—"
“I know.” He walked over and knelt in front of Draco. “I didn’t mean to pry. I just . . . I caught a whiff of that memory and then I couldn’t let it go. And I wasn’t trying to puzzle out your password or anything like that.”
“Hardly.” Draco’s tone made it plain that he had no intention of breaking things off. Ever. “I’ve known about your penchant for hurling yourself into danger and rescuing people since first year.”
That was, presumably, a rhetorical question, so Draco just kept nuzzling and chirrupping away. Potter kept stroking him and even pressed his mouth, briefly, to the top of Draco's head.
"Oh!" Harry sat there blankly, his mouth hanging open, as his brain raced ahead to do the maths. So Draco was born on 5 June. In 1980, of course, same as himself. And like Harry, he was turning twenty-one this year.
Draco stared at him, not bothering to hide his surprise.
Hermione sensed the awkwardness too. She took a seat on the bed again and gave Ron’s dad a pleading look. “Arthur, I can tell your head is spinning. But you must know that there was nothing untoward happening when you walked in.”
“And if I refuse?”
“We don’t need one. You’re an auror, Harry. You must have some training in legilimency.”
“Yes.” He sounded matter-of-fact now. “You being an unintentional horcrux fits the facts perfectly. When you died, so did the horcrux in you. Then you were, er, allowed to come back. I’m only surprised that . . . .” Draco paused. “Well, it doesn’t matter.”
Harry's lips twitched. “Yeah, but he's not my sex slave in his animagus form, obviously. And we prefer the term 'boyfriend.’”
"No." Harry forced himself to look like this was a normal conversation. He had no intention of letting Draco know how out of his depth he was. "No, that's all right. This stays between us."
“Should you be reporting to work?”
“All of that should lead people to assume that we're together, not that—”
“It was a half-truth,” Draco insisted. “There was a deal for my father to give information on other Death Eaters to the authorities. Me working for Robards was a secret part of that deal, that’s all.”
“But,” Draco continued, “Robards knew I was doing some minor financial work for this group.”
"I'm still filthy from the explosion, Granger, that's all." He lowered her hand, but didn't release it. "And I don't believe that crap about muggle-borns anymore."
"You don't play fair, do you?" Harry asked, stroking Draco's head.
"Oh. I thought—I dunno. Thought you might want me to have your mark too."
“Blaise’s chief requirement is that his partner be as beautiful as he is. And, trust me, he won’t miss an opportunity to shag someone who shagged the Holy Saviour of the wizarding world.”
“I thought we’d have time, Draco! I thought only our friends would know for now. I didn’t think the Prophet would hound us about this so soon.”
“Two blokes?” Harry gave him a blank look.
"That's fine."
“No, but . . . I sort of, you know, found you attractive before. Before now, I mean.”
“Well, I’ve absolute faith that you’ll become head of them one day.” He didn’t look particularly happy about that, but he looked as if he meant it. “And just as much faith that Granger will get herself elected Minister for Magic.”
They had been obsessed with each other during their years at Hogwarts, getting under each other's skin in all the wrong ways. God, how Harry had hated him. But only until sixth year. Granted, he still despised him after that. Sometimes. Mostly he pitied him.
“No.” Harry shook his head decisively. “Dumbledore might even want the truth to be told; he knew his shortcomings.”
Fortunately, Weasley’s brain seemed to be working just fine. “You want to bring Malfoy? Are you barking, Harry? Hagrid doesn’t want to see him.”
“Might order you to.”
“She can’t be the one setting those boundaries.” Weasley paused to roll his eyes. “Fuck, Malfoy. I dunno how good I’ll be at this.”
“Draco?” Weasley let out a startled and delighted laugh. “You actually named him after Malfoy? That's just cruel, mate.”
Draco shrugged. “To the best of my knowledge, he only made it through two layers of my protection. He didn’t think I was capable of hiding anything deeper than that.”
The tears vanished, replaced by a shrewd look. “I wish to serve here. There be many elves at Malfoy Manor—here, Toffee will shine!”
Hermione focused her attention on the laptop. She was seated directly in front of it; Draco, meanwhile, was leaning sidelong toward the screen.
“Yes. I will.” It was a promise.
"Kreacher curses his ancient bones!"
Draco obligingly shut it.
“Harry, he does know how to press buttons, remember? Yours especially.”
“I imagine that will change soon enough.” Lucius still looked thoughtful. “I don’t believe Blair is quite the man Labour thinks he is—and sooner or later circumstances will out him.”
"You're going to hurt yourself, you know. Come down here." Harry held up his arm to him.
He felt sick to his stomach, just remembering. It was the night of Dumbledore's death. The night he was supposed to kill Dumbledore. The night he watched Snape do it for him.
->*<-
They spent the next half hour discussing the furniture in Harry’s room while they sorted the rest of his clothes. Kreacher mostly agreed on what to consign to the burn pile, although Draco stopped him from actually putting any of it in the fireplace.
“Draco did try with him. Even if that was only for your sake.”
“Oh, I haven’t forgotten that Weasley and Granger saved his life. He ought to repay that debt.”
Salazar, Potter looked furious. But that fury wasn't directed at him. Draco stood there stupidly, as if he were rooted to the floor. He hadn't ever expected to see Saint Potter so righteously angry on his behalf.
"And, of course, I'll need a weekly appointment with my new therapy ferret."
"That's not the point, Ron!" She was on her feet now too—they were all standing in the centre of the room—looking as if she wanted to assign detention to the lot of them.
“We already gave it to him.”
She still didn't approve. But since Draco seemed satisfied there wasn't much she could do, apart from making certain that Harry squashed his tyrannical tendencies and Ron remembered that Draco did not actually owe him anything.
But Harry shook his head to stop her. “No, it’s fine. It worked out really well, actually.”
“All right, all right.” Weasley stared up at the ceiling again. “Merlin, Draco. Nothing’s ever easy with you, is it?”
Harry blinked at the spot where Kreacher had stood just a moment ago. “All right,” he said. “I’m guessing ‘frum’ means, uh, observant or religious or something?”
“Just by how much magic flows through their veins.”
“Fair point.” Harry wondered how much Draco knew about his time with his muggle family. A few facts were public knowledge now, thanks to a spat of unauthorised biographies. And Harry had told Draco a bit, though they hadn’t discussed the Dursleys at length yet.
She smiled. “I’ve never heard you call him ‘Harry’ before.”
“All right, all right!” He was still smirking, though. “Your wand responded to me too. Not the way my own did, but . . . more than just functional?”
Draco's grey eyes widened. He sat up, drew one knee to his chest and then reluctantly shook his head. "If you are, I'm not ready to find out. Not here."
She smiled, but then both their eyes darted to the window, where a horned owl was clawing at the glass. “Isn’t that one of Shacklebolt’s?”
"It's not what you think. He wasn't destroying their bridges or using them for target practice. It's all about muggle finances, actually."
"Tell me, Malfoy. Now."
“It is. I answered all his questions about New York and muggle life there—and I didn’t sound like some blood supremacist, I swear it! I don’t look down on muggle culture anymore.”
Hermione looked interested. "Are you on the electoral register, then?"
“I appreciate it Potter, but it’s not the shop per say that I dread, just the thought of trying to get Scorpius to leave without spending his entire inheritance,” Draco said, shaking his head.
Harry smiled at the kind, thoughtful gesture. “That’s very nice of you Scorpius, I’m sure Lily would love them.”
"Well I would have discussed it with you but you left before lunch and nobody had the foggiest notion of where you'd gone or when you'd be back. I told you days ago we couldn't afford to keep round the clock surveillance on the Malfoy's for more than a short while. Besides, it sounds as though we may have piqued their interest if someone was already snooping about," Hermione replied confidently.

"Come stand behind me Harry, I think if we start carefully pulling away I can get the last few pieces loose," Neville said, weaving his fingers between the vine at the base of Draco's head and hair.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's teasing, clearly, the attack hadn't fazed the man too badly. After checking with all the other Aurors that the entire manor had been cleared and the scorch marks cleaned, Harry set about covering the entire perimeter with several of his own wards before he left.
“I’m sorry. For whatever’s going on Malfoy. I know it’s none of my business and you’ve told me to stay out of it but you’ve been acting strangely these past few weeks and Scorpius never returned any of Albus’ letters, which clearly wasn’t normal. Albus was afraid Scorpius wouldn’t even be at the train station today,” Harry rushed, pretty sure if Draco had his wand he would have been hexed on his arse already.
Harry deeply regretted how quickly it went downhill from there, but he just didn't seem to know how to get out of the giant hole he'd dug for himself at the time. The only resolution Ginny had been able to come to was for Harry to follow in her brother's footsteps and quit being an Auror. Considering he'd already dedicated the better part of his adult life to his career and was up for a position as Head Auror, Harry had steadfastly refused. Without being able to come to an agreement, they'd both sought separate council in respective family and friends. Ginny had asked her mum how she handled having her husband working for the ministry so much and Harry had gone to Ron and Hermione for guidance. The three had sympathized with the couple, but none had come up with a foolproof way to juggle both time-consuming careers and home lives. Mr. Weasley made it a point to eat breakfast and dinner with his family nearly every day and Ron had given up his dream of becoming an Auror in order to be more available for his family.
“You’d make a horrid Soothsayer, Potter,” Draco replied.
Realizing there really was no way to salvage the semi-decent mood they'd been in before the Medusa Vine fiasco Harry nodded and dutifully apparated them to Diagon Alley as soon as they stepped outside of Hogwarts wards. Draco made several random seeming detours into shops, sometimes buying things but more often speaking quietly with the shopkeepers and exchanging a few vials from his briefcase for money before moving on again. By the fourth store, Harry's stomach abruptly announced that lunch had been skipped and dinner was fast approaching. Suddenly it was as if his nose had a direct connection to his stomach and he would swear he could smell the pastry shop at the far end of the street.
Draco’s breath came out in a muted sob and he quickly used the sleeve of his shirt to wipe the tears away, still avoiding eye contact with Harry. Harry gave Draco’s shoulder a gentle squeeze, wishing he were better at these types of situations. He felt hopelessly useless at comforting those who were grieving and he highly doubted that Draco would take a hug or physical comfort very well at all.
“I escorted him while he made some deliveries. It’s not the first time that’s happened either, they still think he was a willing Death Easter and blame him for the wars,” Harry replied.
“Malfoy, how did you and Scorpius get here today?” Harry asked, trailing after the man.
I am currently quite busy and will be for the foreseeable future. If I am in need of your services I will be in touch, until such time arises do not feel it necessary to contact me.
“Dear Malfoy,
Draco gave a wave of acknowledgement but otherwise stayed fully engrossed in his conversation with the shop keep.
-Malfoy
Harry was about to shrink the food bags to fit into his robe pockets when an older man nearing his 70's burst out into the street just behind them from the store he was in.
“Luna was surprisingly astute when she stopped talking about Nargles and whatever a Crumple Horned Snorkack was; even Hagrid hadn’t heard of that one before. Most of Professor Trelawney’s favorite students were Ravenclaws, she said because they only believed in the truth, that their minds were more open to the spirit’s messages,” Harry explained.
“Chicken noodle soup”
"One more thing Mr. Potter, bombers take such care and time to perfect their craft that they have to practice beforehand, and usually their targets are abandoned buildings, similar to what they want to blow up. Check out any similar explosions in the general area, if you find the same explosive device you've found your bomber," Mr. Denton added, as Harry moved towards the door after thanking him for his help.
Harry smirked at the idea of Draco flying for the Irish team, who were usually loud, brash and nearly reckless in their games. They “drank, as much as they played, which he figured couldn’t help their scores much, but their followers were ridiculously loyal and their garish green and orange would overwhelm any stadium.
Harry closed the distance between himself and Draco and perched on the corner of the coffee table. “I really mean it when I say I’m here to help Malfoy; not just as a Ministry Auror either. I know our history isn’t exactly friendly, but I think we owe it to ourselves, and perhaps even our sons to give it at least a chance. We aren’t at Hogwarts anymore; we don’t have separate houses and mates to impress. We had a pretty good go of it while shopping for the kids’ school supplies and it didn’t even lead to front-page newspaper articles the next morning. I can’t say I know exactly what you’re going through Malfoy, but I do know what it feels like to lose people you love and trying to shoulder that alone is a million times worse then letting someone in to help share the burden. So even if you’d just like someone to debate Quiddich teams with over dinner, know you can always count on me.”
Although Harry didn’t believe Albus had any reason to worry, as they crossed onto the train platform he found himself once again scanning the crowd for two heads of blonde hair. Only a heartbeat after he saw Draco did Albus launch into a sprint, squeezing past families with hurried apologies before throwing his arms around Scorpius in a hug that clearly surprised both him and his father.
Harry wondered if Hermione was being purposefully thick at this point and crumpled the letter up to toss in the rubbish bin before scratching out another one.
"Your Aurors are careful enough to stay outside the manor's wards, you however cross right through them without any regard to letting me know if it's you or my attackers come back to try killing me again," Draco replied.
Ron and Fred quickly shuffled the group towards one of the newest displays, effectively keeping the kids’ attentions as Harry slipped away. Harry knew Draco wouldn’t have gone far with Scorpius out of sight but this was a deceptively large store and it was nearly impossible to see past everyone. Ascending the large central staircase that would it’s way up along the inside perimeter of the store, Harry looked down on the main floor, however Draco was nowhere to be seen. A few minutes later Harry had to admit defeat as the rest of the store appeared empty of the man as well. Slipping out the front door Harry was nearly frantic by the time he spotted Draco around the corner, tucked between the joke shop and the hatters’ next door. From a quick glance Draco looked cool and aloof, but as Harry got closer he could see the tightness in the blonde’s face and how his hands were clenched into fists at his sides.
For a long moment Draco said nothing, his mind a tumolt of thoughts and his heart a writhing enigma of emotions. He’d tried to keep Harry at arm’s length, hadn’t wanted him to see what a mess his life had become and certainly hadn’t wanted Saint Potter to try and save him. Even now he was about to brush all the man’s rightful concern away with a dismissive wave of his arm and insist he go find someone else to rescue. However, the truth was twisting him up inside, if Harry left he’d be utterly alone to face the near insurmountable grief of his dying wife, the paranoia that some unknown group was out there, lurking in the dark waiting to blow him up and the heavy burden of trying to take care of his son through all of that. Draco felt the truth of this settle over his body like a cold, wet blanket and he nearly shivered.

“I think so, I mean I haven’t really talked to them since then. I got a note though, sort of a thank you, I think,” Harry said.
Malfoy”
Hermione rolled her eyes with a laugh at Harry’s worried expression. “I’ve spent the better part of my life with you and Ron. Neither one of you accept help of any kind easily, except with your work. I practically have to tackle you and force it onto you.”
“Remember, whoever is supplying them is linked to the muggle military, either Marines or Army is most likely from the explosives,” Harry added, as Hermione grabbed another napkin and kept writing.
"I believe him Malfoy, everything in here is really quite pretty, nearly fit for royalty in fact," Harry added, tears streaming down his cheeks as the Medusa Vine coiled in triple spires across the front of the organic crown it had created.
“So is your friend feeling any better?” Hermione asked a week later as they sat down to a rare opportunity to share lunch.
But what exactly friendship to Draco meant Harry wasn’t sure. Hopefully less insults at the least. They’d managed a meal together tonight, though neither one had actually done much eating. Perhaps he could take Draco out again for a more enjoyable meal, one without witches and wizards glaring hatefully at them. He often brought Hermione and Ron presents on the rare occasions they got together, so that would require some more thought as to what Draco would enjoy. Harry’s schedule was so full already he wasn’t sure how he’d manage to find any time for anyone else.
“You still haven’t answered my question about why you stood up for my parents and me at the trials, or why you’re here now, Potter,” Draco reminded.
Harry’s heart gave a painful twist at the dejected admission and he took a slight step towards Draco. “You don’t need to worry about it Malfoy, my wards will stay up as long as necessary and we will catch whoever is responsible.”
Malfoy”
Harry nodded, tucked the book inside his jacket pocket and went home feeling as though he might have something to look forward to.
“I was curious about that Quiddich book you offered to lend me. I have to admit I don’t know much about the American teams,” Harry replied, trying to seem as casual as possible even though the man had been on his mind solidly since lunch.
Clearly Draco’s stubbornness knew no bounds and if it were only himself perhaps Harry could have let it go, but as the summer holiday was coming to a close that meant both Astoria and Scorpius were likely home and now involved. Harry supposed Draco could have withheld the information about the attack on the manor from his wife and son so as to not frighten them but it could prove to be fruitless if they were attacked once more. Deciding letters weren’t going to gain him the sort of answers he was seeking he vowed to speak directly to Draco that evening while on patrol.
“You’re right Harry, when they failed to destroy Malfoy Manor I was a hopeful as you, but I can’t discount all other possible leads either. We don’t have nearly enough Aurours to protect everyone and now with all these attacks on half-bloods we’re completely swamped and I don’t know what any of it means yet,” Hermione said, knocking back the rest of her drink in one gulp.
“Start small, especially if they don’t have a lot of money themselves or if you’ve never exchanged gifts before. They may feel obligated to return the favor”
"What sort of potions are you delivering Malfoy?" Harry asked skeptically.
"No, there are several layers of protective magic surrounding the entire manor, placed by generations of Malfoy's. That's why Voldemort chose our home to use as his hideout, no simple witch or wizard would ever be able to get through the wards," Draco explained.
Once the door creaked open, a small, pointed face peeked out, glaring up at Draco. "You better have my potions."
Draco chuckled mirthlessly, his eyes opening to stare blankly at the ceiling. “Scorpius didn’t want to go back to Hogwarts yet, he had to say good-bye to Astoria, knowing it was the last time he’d see her.”
"Malfoy I think we'd better leave," Harry suggested, as nearly a dozen onlookers now lined the street, more spilling out around the old man from the store he'd come from.
“I can understand that. Ron was much the same way, he’ll defend his family and friends until his last breath but going out and purposefully fighting strangers day after day was too much. But it’s not just those closest to me that I want to protect; it’s the entire wizarding world. I’ve found a place that accepts me, showed me who I really was and never once called me a freak or locked me in a broom cupboard. So for that, I’ll protect it against anyone or anything,” Harry replied stoically.
"Oh come on Neville, one picture would make Ron's year," Harry pleaded quietly.
“The that leaves what, the entirety of muggle London? I can’t believe someone like that would be capable of all this. The Dark Lord’s supporters were in hiding, they were keeping completely to themselves, how did a muggle find them?” Draco asked, irritation lacing his words.
“I don’t know if I can get personnel files from either of them, that’s thousands of possible people and it’s not like it’s going to state that they were born a squib and their wizarding parents sent them away,” Hermione groaned, a look of utter frustration on her face.
Harry ducked his head in embarrassment, “We’re not that bad Hermione, I mean we are guys, you’ve got to give us some slack.”
Draco nodded and the boys waved half-heartedly at each other as the two blondes disappeared further down the steet.
“Of course they are, most pure blood families believe The Ministry should act like their personal lap dog. They wouldn’t have even voted Granger in at all, no sense in her bowing to them now,” Draco said.
“No!” came a chorus of answers from all the occupants, much to the young boy’s dismay.
Harry could feel his stomach tightening into knots. How many times was ‘fine’ going to be Draco’s answer when it was clearly anything but?
“Potter,
Hermione swallowed her drink hard and tried not to snap at Harry. “Being Minister of Magic isn’t as easy as Fudge made it look, unless I’m willing to stick my head in the sand and lie to everyone that everything is fine when it’s clearly not. I know I can be rather controlling at times, but it’s frustrating when everyone is looking to me for answers and I can’t give them any. I only wanted to help Harry, I hoped I could take the brunt of this case to pacify everyone else that I was doing something and help lighten your load so you could get more accomplished. But you got so hung up on Malfoy that you barely even focused on anything else.”
“Hermione, I invited Harry over tonight and made sure you can home early because the two of you are working yourselves into early graves. Harry hasn’t eaten properly in weeks and you’ve barely slept in at least that long, and neither one of you has said two words to each other that isn’t work related. You two need a small break, otherwise you’ll be no good to anyone and people’s lives depend on it,” Ron replied, pouring a finer of whiskey into two glasses and handing one each to Harry and Hermione. Harry knew Ron was again right, enough years of friendship had taught him the man was the one to call their bluff and be right. Hermione opened her mouth to protest but closed it with a resigned sigh, accepting the glass.
Harry nodded.
If you haven’t had a chance to read this book you’re welcome to borrow it anytime, but be gentle with the bookmark.
Harry looked thoughtfully concerned for a moment. "How many people know your wife and son were gone Malfoy?"
Harry stopped in the doorway as Ron and the boys eagerly hurried inside. “You don’t have to come in if you don’t want to, Ron and I will keep an eye on Scorpius.”
"No, never. Professor Sprout always said plants respond to the kind of people and energy they're around. So if you're really negative and angry they can become that way as well or they can wither and die," Neville replied in a hushed whisper.
“Malfoy, please, is Scorpius alright? Are you alright?” Harry pleaded, his eyes desperately searching for the answer in pale grey eyes.
The next few days passed in a similar fashion, Harry reported to Hermione to see if she had any new leads, he sifted through dozens of old reports of former Death Eaters, their associates and families, tried to find them and checked on Malfoy every night. He had so many different tasks going at the same time that he had nearly forgotten about looking into where the bomber had practiced until one of his younger Aurors came in with a list of addresses that momentarily baffled him.
“Right, you two better get on the train or you won’t find a good seat,” Harry said with a shake of his head, pointedly ignoring Draco’s comments.
“Working for her must be horrid, how do you keep up?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, suppose I lost touch with a few of my housemates as well. I haven’t seen Neville since New Year’s, and even longer for Dean or Semus. I’m only able to keep up with Luna because of her articles in The Quibbler,” Harry sighed, wondering if that was why he’d felt so out of touch lately.
Harry glanced at his wrist watch, noticing it was barely eight a.m. and then glanced at the piles of paperwork covering his desk, hoping he could make a sizable dent before lunch. By the time the clock struck 12, Harry had to admit defeat, as many reports as he'd finished reading, files that he'd submitted to their correct offices and orders signed, at least that many had come in and taken their place. It was frustrating enough that for a moment Harry had the wicked idea of setting it all ablaze. Unfortunately, Ministry paperwork was carefully warded against ripping, crumpling, water or fire damage and being lost for too long. Sometimes Harry thought magic took the fun out of everything.
The blonde poked listlessly at the crust of his pie. “It was nothing Potter, he didn’t even have his wand out.”
Ron began waving frantically as they got close enough, trying to signal to a waiting Hermione, Ginny, Molly, Rose and Lily who sat on the patio. Lily stood from her seat and pointed, waving back eagerly as the group converged on the table. Harry was brought up short as Albus stumbled to a stop right in front of him, looking behind him as his father held Scorpius back.
Albus gave a relieved smile, the tension draining from his shoulders. His dad was Head Auror, if he couldn’t get Scorpius to school then nobody could. And he supposed if his dad couldn’t, for some unfathomable reason, then his Aunt Hermione definitely could, nobody disobeyed the Minister Of Magic.
“Maybe it’s taken this long for them to plan it all out. They’re not using magic, which means they’ve had to align themselves with muggles who are proficient in explosives; that can’t be very many. You said it takes weeks between attacks, then it may very well have taken years to get started,” Draco mused.
As activity at the manor seemed to inexplicably pick up, so did activity at several other houses they were monitoring. It caused a flurry of confusion with the Aurours and several arguments between Harry and Hermione on what to do about it. Hermione’s watch and wait tactic was grating on Harry’s nerves, afraid they were once again going to be trying to pick up the pieces after they were too late. Feeling as if time was steadily against him and unable to do anything Harry picked up his quill once more.
-Hermione
“Hermione, do you think people can change? I mean, if given a clean slate and a second chance?” Harry asked.
The look Draco shot at Harry was somewhere between exasperated and pitying. "Honestly Potter, what would your first thought have been if your child came home telling you his potions professor was me?"
"I'm sorry Malfoy, I'll owl you before I head over and let you now exactly where I'll be apparating in so you won't be surprised anymore," Harry apologized.
Hermione quickly traded looks with Harry and they both stood up. Hermione put her arms around Ron’s waist, giving him a seductive look from under her lashes. “Until they learn we’re both coming home to you Ronald.”
“Ginny’s gonna have my head,” Harry muttered crossly, hurrying the kids down the street towards the café they’d agreed to meet at nearly 20 minutes ago.
"I don't want you to Harry, I know it seems cruel but I don't see any other options at this point. You need to focus on finding out more about the explosives they used, I have a muggle military contact at the British Embassy who you can talk to. I'm fairly certain whoever is behind this is either muggle-born with family who were military members or a squib who was in the muggle military," Hermione explained.
Harry nodded wordlessly and with painstaking slowness got Draco to his feet and shuffling across the patio. By the time Harry cast Alohamora on the patio doors Draco’s head was cleared enough to remember the panic that had set in just before he’d fainted. As if being the sole focus of Harry’s unwarranted savior complex wasn’t bad enough now he’d never believe Draco when he said they were fine. Though obviously Harry hadn’t believed it before much anyhow. A long-suffering sigh escaped him and Harry stopped their progress through the house.
“Well, I’m done with it a any rate so it’s yours, and I’m not surprised, there’s hardly anything published about them during the season and I don’t know anyone who follows them regularly,” Draco answered, bending swiftly to pluck the book from the coffee table.
“Harry stopped by for a chat and I made him join me for dinner,” Hermione explained.
“Doesn’t take much when you haven’t drank in awhile ‘Mione. I wasn’t kidding when I said you and Harry needed a break,” Ron replied.
Neville's chuckle turned into a hearty laugh that kicked Draco's sneer up several notches. "It can't really turn you into stone Draco, the perfume from the blooms can temporarily paralyze you though. I was curious if it was only the perfume or if the flower and perhaps its' seeds had the same effect. Would you be willing to try brewing a potion with them Draco? I also just got in some new rare aquatic species, but I haven't finished researching all their possible uses. If I give you a list could you see if any have medicinal properties?"
Harry nodded in understanding, it was far more information than he'd come in with even though it did nothing to whittle down the suspect pool for him. The idea that anyone could learn how to blow up an entire building full of innocent people with just a few keystrokes on a computer made him feel queasy and more paranoid than before.
“Something to do with Quiddich”
Both Ron and Harry laughed, neither one was nearly as bad off as she currently was.
“Merlin, you don’t know when to give up do you? Do you plan to nag me to death then? My kingdom for my bloody wand so I can befuddle you straight to St. Mungo’s,” Draco growled angrily.
“How much would be appropriate to spend?”
“I believe in second chances Malfoy, or maybe for you first chances. It was rather unfair of me to refuse your hand that day when I didn’t even know you or your circumstances,” Harry answered.
Harry could feel a tension headache starting in the back of his skull and he resisted shredding the parchment into confetti out of spite. "What are you working on now?"
“So it’s current. Is it signed? Is the bookmark made of real gold?”
“Sorry to just barge in Hermione, I know it’s your first night without the kids,” Harry apologized, remembering how Ginny and he used to fantasize about a completely empty house.
"Well it's certain pieces of the main device Mr. Potter, but as it goes with bombs such as these, many smaller, less heat resistant parts can be lost after the explosion and resulting fire. Most people who build bombs practice quite a few times before, to perfect their explosives. They create a signature by doing this, all their explosives will be the same, same parts, same materials, same build because they know that it will work every time. So, if you've had six bombs all built by the same person, the components will all be identical. How they are triggered, via watch timer, mobile phone, pressure switch, will be the same every time. Have you found the same pieces at each attack?" Mr. Denton asked, glancing from the handful of scraps on his desk to Harry who was sitting across from him.
Placing the fluttering Snitch bookmark in the crease of the page he was on, Draco was caught by the delicate golden filigree of the wings. Upon closer inspection he realized they weren’t designed like a typical working Snitch’s wings, which were an overlapping hinge work of flat metal pieces. The bookmark’s wings, while still an overlapping flat design so they could fold up, were instead open in the middle of each piece, framed like a window of stained glass with a delicate golden lace like design in each wing. It reflected the surrounding light and glimmered like a fine jewel. Draco was immediately impressed by the craftsmanship and wondered if Harry had even realized the treasure he’d found. The bookmark, usually such an innocuous thing, was one of the most beautiful presents Draco had ever received.
Harry cleared his throat and nodded, “of course Malfoy, it was nice to finally get to meet your son after everything Albus has told me. We’ll see you at the train station then?”
“Harry? What are you doing here? Is everything all right? We barely saw you at the train station today,” Hermione asked, letting Harry through the front door.
“What if they don’t go to anyone, if they feel they don’t really have anyone anymore?” Harry asked, imagining Draco sitting alone in that huge, cold house, if wife slowly dying only rooms away.
Just as they reached the wide stone steps that would take them up to the expansive patio, Harry stopped. Draco paused as well, two steps up and turned in surprise. “What now?”
“In Azkaban with my father. The Wizengamot is made up of mostly pure bloods and some used to hold the same values as my parents but none of them stood up for my parents during the trials. They were just as dirty as any of the Dark Lord’s Death Eaters but they hide behind their Ministry robes like they’re better then anyone,” Draco explained, his voice thick with tired sarcasm.
Draco stared in mild, dubious surprise at the package he’s just been handed by his house elf. “This was from Potter?”
"That could be an important lead to follow, or it could be nothing," Hermione said, not sure how to instruct Harry to proceed.
"Alright, this will stay warm for a while yet. Which way?" Harry asked.
"Did you hear anyone enter your house?" Harry asked.
"Don't worry Draco we just need to untangle it a bit," Neville reassured, coming around to stand behind him. "Harry, you start at the front, lets see if we can get the top part loose."
"Well considering it's Malfoy I'm surprised it's not creating a noose. Perhaps we should start singing 'Malfoy is our king' instead, eh?" Harry snickered.
Slightly distracted by his wife’s minstrations, Ron only pulled back after Hermione did. “Bloody hell, I can see the headlines now, ‘Golden Trio Ménage a Troi’.”
Maybe he needed to ask Hermione again, but how did he explain why he needed the note without explaining what it was for and who? She’d already asked at least three times all ready, but thankfully when it came to Draco, he was used to keeping his mouth shut.
Draco’s eyebrow rose and he shoved his hands into his pants pockets. Everything in him screamed at him to blow Harry off and continue inside. Eventually he would give up, stop pestering him constantly and find something more worthy of his time and attention. Draco knew Harry wasn’t using any magic on him, wasn’t compelling him and yet he felt rooted to the stairs, his body unable to move.
The house elf nodded. “Mister Potter said to give it to Master Malfoy right away.”
"Once Astoria's parents apparated here I told them of my plans to send them all on holiday and except for some winery where Astoria's father had met her mother in Italy, there was no definitive itinerary. Scorpius has managed to send me two owls so far with brief descriptions of their trip, but the last one arrived over a week ago and I have no idea if they're still there or not," Draco replied,'
Harry just nodded stiffly while promising to keep her updated as the case progressed before apparating just down the street from Malfoy Manor.
Harry's heart leapt into his throat as he instinctively leveled his wand at Draco, an immobilizing hex on the tip of his tongue. Taking a steadying breath Harry slowly unknotted his shoulders from his ears as he let his wand arm drop. "It's only for a few days, Malfoy, but I have a few specialized wards in place that only I can reinforce, so you'll just have to put up with it for the time being. I didn't mean to disturb you, that's why I didn't announce that I was coming by."
H. Potter”
Slowly Draco’s eyelids fluttered open and he looked around in confusion. Hands lying flat on the cold stone patio began fumbling slightly until Harry gently grasped one.
“Can’t believe how big my grandchildren have gotten…” Molly continued, pulling Rose into her arms and snatching Hugo by the collar of his jumper.
“You didn’t tell Astoria about the attacks, did you?” Harry assumed.
Diggle snatched up a piece of parchment and hurriedly handed it to Harry. "It was from the Minister Of Magic. See, she even signed it."
"Fine Potter, we need to finish these deliveries if you don't mind," Draco replied shortly, spinning on his heel and stalking across the field.
Harry felt like banging his head into the marble mantlepiece at his own stupidity. If he could have wards that alerted him to anyone crossing the Malfoy Manor grounds so could Malfoy, which meant he'd been repeatedly setting them off. He'd never entered the manor grounds in the same place twice, in case someone was watching, and trying to figure out the routine of the surrounding Aurors.
Draco shook his head with a tight sneer, “I hate not being able to just confront these cowards. Not that it would do me any good I suppose, I don’t even have a wand anymore. I’m practically useless.”
Draco rolled his eyes. "What would you know about potion making Potter? Snape would have failed you except for Granger's help. I don't need a wand or magic to stir a cauldron, and selling potions is the only job I could get seeing as nobody wants to hire the son of a convicted Death Eater."
“If you say ‘fine’ again I’m going to hex you Malfoy,” Harry rebuked, giving him a stern look as he held his wand up to check the wards protections.
“Someone I want to help, I think. They’re not like they used to be, they were given that second chance and they were happy. But they’re going through something really bad right now and I don’t know what to do for them,” Harry admitted, gently pushing his dinner plate away.
Draco leaned back, his shoulders slumping a bit, “I haven’t been in contact with any of my former house mates since we graduated but I was told off quite thoroughly by both Pansy and Blaise shortly before that. Honestly surprised Neville didn’t hex me into next year the first time he saw me again. Guess he doesn’t get that many visitors at Hogwarts during the school breaks, seemed happy just to have someone take an interest in his plants.”
Harry bent low next to Neville, "It's not going to hurt him, will it?"
Unfortunately his attempt fell far from its intended mark as Draco’s breath hitched and his chin wobbled. It brought back memories of catching Draco in the bathroom during sixth year, hunched over the sink, the haggard and devastated look on his face forever seared into his brain. “She wasn’t supposed to have him.”
Harry examined the list a little more closely, there were several addresses that were relatively close together, only a few hours in distance; these could prove to be promising. The outlying ones could still be important, though the list had over 15 addresses and if the young many was correct, there were very possibly more they didn't even know about. "Start labeling a map with each of these listed, I want dates of each one on it as well. If one of these happened close to another one and within a month or so of each other we may have a pattern. I doubt there would be any evidence left but we need to examine every crime scene, speak to anyone who was there and get first hand accounts. In the areas where only one incident was reported, speak to the local muggle police and fire stations, find out if there were any smaller explosions or fires that happened in a relatively close time frame. He had to have started somewhere, he practiced until he felt he was confident enough to take on his real targets."
Harry bit back his reply, the voice in his head sounding like a petulant child’s who all ready knows he’s lost the argument. Sometimes he hated how reasonable and right Hermione could be, it left Harry without anything to say in his defense. He’d known bringing up Draco would be a bad idea; even if Hermione wouldn’t accuse him of being a Death Eater she still held prejudices against him and his family’s involvement during the wars. As difficult as it was for Harry to leave his celebrity status behind, people for the most part weren’t trying to him kill him to avenge their family’s, he had no idea how Draco coped with it. He wasn’t the monster those people thought he was, but Hermione was right in that there was no point trying to get them to believe it. The question was whether or not Draco believed it.
