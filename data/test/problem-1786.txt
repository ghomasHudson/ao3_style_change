“No, but a Nightwraith,” Sirius grins, “How different are they, really. Careful, Harry. Try not to be seen.” Sirius then hoists up the hill and sinks low to the ground, drawing his silver Lune, and skirting the large Berbercane bushes.
Crabbe and Goyle do as much as they can to non-verbally express annoyance behind Malfoy’s back. Goyle employs Malfoy’s prim step and Crabbe stifles a laugh.
Harry avoids looking at Slytherin table, at least directly. He can see it in his blurry periphery, the little blob of platinum blonde that hangs stoically between Pansy and the mass that is Vincent Crabbe. Harry gazes down at his plate, thinking again of the things that plagued him before the incident in the bathroom. He really ought to let it go.
Harry curses. Then he rams Malfoy square in the stomach with his shoulder, tackling him forward like an American football player. They crash through the doors of the Room of Requirement.
“Need help?” she whispers, low, soft. She walks her fingers like tiny legs across the water as she skirts the tub, walking in tandem, giggling. She is standing behind him when reaches her small hands around and spreads them down Harry’s scalp, past his ears, down his chest. He can feel that her hands are thickly calloused, but they have softened in the water to the point of pruning. Her hair falls in a curtain by his face, and she rests her head on his neck, fingers traveling down beneath the water. ”If you don’t start talking soon, I’ll be afeared you don’t want it,” she whines.
Could it be any more ridiculous than this? Escorting a Death Eater to the dungeons so he won’t get detention? A gesture of good will?
If Draco doesn’t do this, Voldemort will kill his parents. And he’ll kill Draco too. The Black and Malfoy lineages end right here, with him.
“Don’t be so shit at hiding then, yeah?” Harry says. He’s trying not to laugh so desperately that his eyes are starting to leak. It’s not particularly funny, though this seems, right now, like the funniest thing Harry has ever seen.
They wait a moment, listening to the birds and squirrels singing, leaves rustling, feeling the heat of the summer sun. Harry lays on the grown, breathing deeply. She scratched him, big clawing marks along his rip cage, but his bleeding is slow, and it will heal, surely. Sirius sinks to his knees and begins laughing, then cuts away her tongue as a trophy.
Harry was assigned to gather sewent mushrooms in the troll caves this morning, even though there’s a healthy stockpile of them in the basement that might last a decade. It’s something that Uncle Sirius does, makes the boys do errant tasks to keep their hands busy. The Trial of the Grasses was just last week, and Harry is only newly well. Still, here he is, pulling sewent mushrooms out of sticky mud, like he didn’t wake to find sixteen of his companions dead to the very same mutagens that have strengthened him. The living boys will have their ceremony by tomorrow evening, likely, to receive their medallions. But it will only be Neville, Harry, and five others. A good ratio, Sirius told him, a bit weary. Usually it’s only three to every ten.
The sad truth is that Draco’s hatred was a fixture of Harry’s school experience. Perhaps that’s what happens when children are orphaned and then abused the majority of their childhood; they grow comfortable with hatred and feel aberrant when they lack it’s familiar pressure. But Harry doesn’t know, because he doesn’t know who he would ask.
“That’s very neat,” Harry tells him, “And I appreciate it, but you sleep in your bed. You need a good night’s sleep to be—“
****this chapter is literally just hinny smut so squick warning.**** we do NOT know movie!ginny in this house. she does not exist. this is ~ginevra~ who is cool, and badass, and also has a personality and storyline outside of being obsessed with harry.
He smells like dead fish and Severus’ mouth is fixed into a grimace for being subjected to it for the majority of the night. But under that, somewhere deep in his tunic, or a kiss next to his ear perhaps, he still smells of Lily.
“Tell Granger I said good luck,” Malfoy says, eyes glinting, a smirk going over his face like he doesn’t have tear tracks drying on his blotched skin. Then he goes jogging off to the exit. Harry looks over at the pile of ash.
Harry follows Malfoy again. Perhaps Malfoy is baiting him, and that’s why he leaves plain as daylight in the middle of supper (and with less regularity, during breakfast and lunch). Pansy looks longingly after him, though if she were a smidgeon less oblivious, she might subsequently notice Harry.
Draco feels naked, so his spreads his hands over his face and digs into his eye wells with the heel of his palm. Potter is still staring when he drops them.
Harry draws the cloak together after Malfoy leaves it. Malfoy approaches the wall, a nondescript grouping of stones.
Pansy is walking behind Harry in the corridor, stepping on the heels of his trainers again and again. He can’t say anything to her. Somehow he evaded expulsion after nearly killing a classmate. Harry is no longer in the interest of pushing it.
“I know. So honorable. You speak parseltongue, you kill that basilisk, the philosopher’s stone.” Malfoy is fidgeting with the beads hanging from the lampshade.
“I’ve got all day,” Malfoy crosses his arms too, an unfaithful mirror. “Oh,” Malfoy glances at his watch, “Got all night too.”
Her eyes are bright blue, even in the dim light of just a few candles. She braces herself on Harry’s neck with one hand and his knee with the other, and nods down to her spread legs, some kind of cue, so he touches her, watches her flinch. There’s one spot, one that makes her breath hitch and her pupils blow, so he keeps rubbing it, if awkwardly, if a little unskilled. Even in the bath water she is slick, and it has him twitching, leaking slick of his own. He takes himself into hand, then grabs her by the hip and lines up.
Sirius hesitates, then says, “I believe the people who came to Kaer Morhen were there for someone. I think that it was you.”
Malfoy cries. He sobs so hard that his ribs contract in waves. It shocks Harry so badly that when his invisibility cloak slides off, he doesn’t have the mind to catch it, nor pick it up.
Sirius sticks a prying hand in Harry’s coin purse and picks around at the finger-full of coppers that Harry’s got left before he can swat him away.
Harry lays back on the stiff table, which is at a slight angle, so it has a foot rest to stand upon and not slide off. It’s bare slats of wood that create the support, and the nails go awry and press uncomfortably into ones skin. It’s stained with blood.
It proves successful all the way up into the seventh floor, just beyond where the Room of Requirement lies. Dobby said this was where Malfoy went, when he was doing whatever sinister plot he was concocting. Harry can hear Crabbe and Goyle echoing behind him, their apish laughter coming loudly off the stone. Harry must look behind for too long, because when he rounds the last corner, Malfoy is there waiting.
Harry nods curtly at her, then at Fred, and pushes up to the bar, mimicking Sirius’ order of a pale. He tosses three coppers down and waits.
He’s prepared to wait a good while, if the Room will even offer him such reprieve. It’s shouldn’t be such a big deal, if—
It makes Harry fall over the edge, and he spills into her, moves her body by his grip on the fat of her ass and rides out the wave. She kisses him on the nose and giggles as she climbs from the tub, then offers him a towel.
Uncle Sirius grabs a few baskets off the stack that Harry is manhandling, and together they weave around the halls to the kitchen basement. Sirius isn’t
“No, they cut our tongues out.” Harry kicks off his boots, then his pants, resists the urge to cover up.
Neville is standing in the main hall, surrounded by the other boys, who are hemming and hawing at what he is holding up for them. It’s his medallion, red-eyed, and blackish-silver, the head of a wolf. It’s a witcher‘s best tool, and none would part with theirs willingly, as it grants them a level of sorcerous detection that is needed for fighting most magical beasts. It’s also the best icon of a witcher, and being that it’s rather large and gaudy, you can tell a witcher from his medallion about a mile away.
He tries not to look too eager until he is out of the doors of the Great Hall himself. Just as soon as he enters the corridors, he spots Malfoy disappearing around the landing of a large stairwell.
“You,” Snape spits, the loathing in his dark eyes more vivid than ever, “Wait here.” He turns to leave the bathroom with Draco leaning heavily on his arm.
Malfoy glares at the space he approximates where he left Harry inside the cloak. The stones in the wall flip and shape into something else entirely, not unlike the wall in London where Diagon Alley begins.
The Noonwraith seems to be trapped inside the runic circle and she bumps against this invisible wall with such bubbling rage that Harry can feel it. He can feel her despair, her anger, her dread. It’s something they don’t tell you in the bestiaries and he wonders how many lose their last fights to these specters, these long-dead women.
Draco drops the cloak, affronted. He bumps Harry’s shoulder going to the door. He leaves, quite dramatically, and the Fat Lady begins screaming so readily that Malfoy screams back. And then he’s knocking desperately, so Harry lets him back inside.
Harry feels like crying. He may be already. He pulls Malfoy up onto his lap, pressing their bodies together to staunch the bleeding, sopping up the blood and tears on Malfoy’s cheeks with the pulled end of his sleeve. Harry is so, so done for. He will never get to finish his education at Hogwarts. They’ll probably put him in Azkaban, and Voldemort will have no trouble finding him there. Dumbledore won’t help him now.
“I couldn’t do it, either. I tried. Your aunt. I couldn’t…” Harry says, remembering Bellatrix and her sick laugh, the rattling of her heeled boots as she ran, the flow of her black coat and her mop of hair.
in. Harry contends some panic over whether the book is still there. Not that Malfoy needs help with potions class, though he’d be happy to figure how Harry swiftly became top of the class.
“Your common room is shit,” Malfoy says, evaluating the tapestries on the walls, a little crystalline lamp.
Harry fidgets in his seat. Hermione doesn’t acknowledge him more than a glance over her book. Ron has a mouth full of food so he just elbows Harry quite hard in greeting. Harry digs around in the mashed potatoes and turkey legs. There is a cranberry tart down by Dean that he feels like skipping dinner for.
“Crabbe and Goyle will be around any minute now,” Malfoy smirks, his sharp chin perched high, the corners of his mouth curved like a cat with prey in it’s jaws. Harry grips harder on Malfoy’s wrists to prove he can. Malfoy rolls his skull around on the wall.
was a grave misstep according to their peers, and they were cast off thusly as fraternizing with the poor. So Lily Evans stood one foot in alleys, orphanages, and pubs on the outskirts, and one foot in horse races, masquerade balls, and mansions, her big sister Petunia tagging behind all the while.
Severus carries the man, half-conscious, teetering on death, up a set of stone steps and into an old warehouse. It will be teaming with shiphands on the morrow, but for now it’s empty and warmer than the unforgiving sea air, at least.
There’s a patch of untouched Berbercane bushes clustered at the top of the hill, probably because the climb is somewhat steep and requires shimmying up several rock formations that look unforgiving. Harry points at them, and Sirius hitches the horses to a tree and they make towards the bushes. Harry’s medallion gives a little hum, but he’s sure it’s a mistake, until it happens again, then more consistently as he climbs the rocks.
They are nearly the same height, but Harry feels much bigger, and Malfoy recently being so waifish and wan confers the illusion of a significant disparity between them.
Harry hears the echo of his own voice to some delay, watching the pattern of his wand’s making as it blooms over Malfoy’s chest. Malfoy puts his pale fingers to the wounds. When he catches sight of the blood covering his fingers, he begins to tremble. Then his legs fail him and he lands hard on the floor.
Harry smiles, then, permits himself to. They gather the wealth of Berbercane fruit and Sirius figures he might reason with the blacksmith that the Celandine was well picked over, and he’ll have to be satisfied with the handful, though they do cross some Crow’s Eyes in the farmers field. They have to duck low and steal them, but who will know the difference?
“Stealing your style,” Malfoy says quietly, so as not to wake the entirety of Gryffindor house. Harry considers that. How would they feel about one of the most notorious Slytherins in current attendance trespassing in their grounds? Harry cannot measure how he feels about it just yet. He looks back down at his cloak.
“I won’t do it.” Draco shouts, over the sound of the pour and the thunder, “If you keep it a secret, I won’t do what he’s asking of me.” He isn’t sure that he is telling the full truth.
Crabbe and Goyle won’t be long behind him, but they haven’t come yet, so Harry must manage to buoy just between them and Malfoy.
“Do me a favor, will you?” Malfoy says. Harry can’t look away from Malfoy’s grey eyes, welled with tears. How stark a change from the whooping, gleeful boy he found moments ago. It’s like Malfoy to whine, to cry when he doesn’t get his way, purposed for manipulation. But Harry- maybe he is seeing things- discerns a horrible sadness that was never there before.
“It’s a cabinet. A simple storage cabinet.” Harry takes a deep breath, not prepared to admit that: “I’ve watched him for the last week. He puts an object in there, casts a spell I’ve never heard, and the thing disappears. The incantation is
“Not near friends, Sirius said,” Harry tells him, a little too stern for what he means, but he can’t take it back.
“Mida,” is all she says, and she stares at Silagrim when she says it. He flinches horribly, and his shoulders lift up as if he’s covering himself from something he doesn’t want to see. “It’s Mida. You know it is.”
It’s probably about Potter. Pansy won’t give up torturing him, which is good, because Draco doesn’t currently possess the energy to hound Potter as he used to.
Together they seal the front seam, and when Harry glances at them in the great mirror in the corner. they are both invisible. Though they are both tall, not even their toes stick out from beneath the cloak, as though the fabric learns the shape of its user and adjusts.
“Got to start sometime,” Sirius shrugs, “And if you play it right, we can save the coppers on your room.”
“So get on, go do whatever you usually do, and I’ll stick around here,” Harry says, folding his arms and leaning back against the door.
“What does it do?” Harry twists his wand into Malfoy’s windpipe. “Nothing? Just an ordinary cabinet?” He points his wand toward it, deliberating.
“Of course! Or, I visited him in Beauclair once too, but often we heard a little about the other’s whereabouts and subsequently ran into each other, like destiny, he would say.” Sirius still talks with the accent of a Beauclairois man, even though he was taken away at the small age of twelve. “I saw him the last time not long after your second birthday, when him and Lily had taken up refuge in some small Temerian camp. He was dressed like a common man, and so wiry and paranoid I hardly recognized him anymore.”
Ginevra does that laugh, the roaring one, way too loud and melodious for what’s been offered, but Harry isn’t complaining. She’s pretty when she throws her head back like that, cocks her hip to the side so her ass rounds in her silhouette. Harry has never seen a girl naked except in clinical textbooks wherein the are intestines exposed and discussions of rot, autopsy, and other, less than stimulating topics cover the parchment. Women are softer than those drawings, rosier, or at least Ginevra is. She’s freckled down to her feet too, just the same as her cheeks.
Some of the older witchers, the ones who went through the previous Trial of the Grasses, are sitting by the fire, knocking back ale, and looking on with deadened expressions. Their wolf head medallions hang there, sure as shit, from each neck, a little taunting thing. Harry looks over and says a silent promise to himself he will never watch this happen to someone else.
The particular thing about this gawking is that it is noticeably worse. It has been since Malfoy. Since the incident in the bathroom. If Pansy didn’t tell everyone, then Moaning Myrtle covered her failure to do so. It was no secret that he and Malfoy shared animosity, but Harry attempted murder, albeit accidentally. Even the Gryffindors who secretly congratulate him scoot further down the bench.
“I invoke the Law of Surprise,” Severus whispers, “Give me the first thing you see when you walk through the threshold of your home.” He wonders if fate will grant him this, even if he has exploited her so. A cursed and lonely man it may make him, but what else is a witcher already, than cursed, than lonely?
Harry sticks his wand in a small crack beside the portrait. “What? Who goes there?” The Fat Lady cries, “Get back to bed!”
It must strike a nerve, because Draco comes charging forward and tackles Harry to the floor. They land with a thud, Harry with the wind gone from his lungs and his glasses a decent distance thrown. Draco is straddling him, pinning his arms down with his knees and the weight of his body. He points a long finger at Harry’s face, and it’s all, from this distance, that Harry can clearly see.
It’s nearly ten minutes to four in the morning when James Potter begins coughing up murky water. His heart had returned to a comfortable soon after being brought here- Severus was monitoring- and now, it seems, his body is coming back into it’s strength, warmth returning to his fingers and cheeks.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. Malfoy blinks, then pushes the wand further into Harry’s side. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know what the spell did, or I wouldn’t have...”
“We’ve got enough for the pub,” Sirius says, not asking, and walks off to hitch his horse along the troughs on offer outside.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, regarding his fettered wrists as though noticing their position for the first time, “You’ve convinced me.”
It’s the villages leatherworker, Silagrim. He’s a stout old man, perhaps in his sixtieth year, but he’s practiced at his craft. The leather and oil smell permeates the air around his home, especially in the sun where he’s tanning new hides.
Blaise is asking questions about Potter’s invisibility cloak, probably plotting a heist in his head, when Pansy comes strutting up.
Harry is chopping his cranberry tart into very small pieces with the side of his fork when he sees the blob of platinum blonde raise up slightly and start making off toward the doors. He dares himself to look, and there goes Malfoy, rushing out of the Great Hall, his gait so long and graceful he appears to float.
Crabbe and Goyle notice the commotion due to Malfoy’s shrieking, but they miss the disappearing door by a long shot.
Harry hears the screech which makes Sirius decide so, and his heart gives the echo of a thump, but doesn’t really. Leftovers of fear, fading a bit each time.
The hooded mage lifts his head against the significant bowing of his spine, and just beneath the shadow Harry can tell that he is smiling. He is the only one in the room, in which there are maybe seventy others in total, who is smiling, Harry is sure. Harry grabs a table just by the window, where moonlight is pouring in. Neville follows.
Sirius grunts somewhere off in the distance and the small, purple runes of the sign Yrden appear around Harry and his bride. She pulls back from him in anger, shoves him away the ground and lifts her arms in the air to scream. Her white dress melts away, twists, becomes tattered. Her flesh sizzles and burns and rots. Her jaw falls limp, dangling, and her tongue flies from it’s place, a foot long and dripping with gore. She still wears her veiled crown but the flowers wilt. She raises up in the air above Harry who scurries back out of the Yrden circle and pulls his sword from the scabbard.
Harry sinks into the bath and groans, feeling the knots in his muscles un-work, the tension seep out into the water. To a small measure of disgust, he can see the dirt sloughing off his body too, clouding up the water around him, so he dips in, scrubs his face and his scalp, and rises back up. Ginevra is standing by the tub, fingers waving on the surface of the water.
Harry feels the contents of his stomach rise with a fury. He should be happy that Hermione is finally endorsing his recent fixation. He hopes his panic doesn’t show. He doesn’t
Harry once tried to use the Cruciatus Curse, but its casting was unique in that you needed a pure intention. The pure intention to truly torture. Even after Bellatrix killed Sirius, even after. Harry barely sent her flying to the ground. She stood up immediately, cackling.
“Why can’t we go back to Kaer Morhen?” Harry asks Sirius’, who’s on his side, facing away from Harry.
Harry has come to detest the absence of glaring, stalking, or otherwise tormenting. He considers who else has hated him as long or half as hard as Malfoy that he might transfer his unused energy to.
“You’re trying to sneak Death Eaters into the school,” Potter offers. His eyes go searching Draco’s expression.
Malfoy doesn’t respond. He glares, sheathing his wand, stepping around Harry, seeing if Harry will stop him from leaving. Harry isn’t sure if he should.
“Wow,” Frye says, then gets up close and stares into Harry’s eyes, examining them. Harry takes a bite of the bread.
Malfoy leans closer to his face. Harry can feel his breath, smell his cologne. Harry fumbles for his glasses and Malfoy pushes them into his hand.
It was this wild, red-headed girl that Severus fell in love with in his youth, certain he would make something better of himself than a nameless orphan so that he could give her a life she deserved, as good or better than she was brought up. One day, a Witcher clad in soot-black arrived to the orphanage to pick out strong boys, and Severus begged to be taken. The Witcher laughed at him, picked on his scrawny, lanky frame and beakish nose. He chased their cart three miles out of the city before they let him get in, heels bloodied and later infected so badly that he couldn’t stand for a month.
Harry promptly feels worse than he has in a long time. He stumbles forward and drops to his knees beside Malfoy, not wanting to look at the damage but unable to look away.
It’s as Harry expected. He is blown back with a start, across the small clearing made by Malfoy, and he lands with his spine square on the leg of an old armchair. He gets up, gripping his back, the pain shooting up and down his legs. It is not the pain of the Cruciatus Curse, but of a mundane physical impact. Malfoy looks stricken by this. “I told you,” Harry mutters.
Potter shoves by and heads for the courtyards. Draco catches up beside him and matches his stride. He can see Potter looking from the corner of his eye, the way his fists are clenching and unclenching at his sides.
, he once told Harry, and it’s true. All of the other elder witchers are just that: elder. To see Sirius, young and eccentric, next to the old white wolves is a real sight, but Harry has never questioned it. He is rumored to be one of the best swordsman Kaer Morhen had ever seen, and to no less importance, is intensely paternal.
The blacksmith answers the door in his pajamas, hands all stained in ash and grease. The forge outside is burning low, and so hot that Harry begins to sweat when they walk by. His name is Thom, and he greets Sirius with a startling amount of warmth- after he gets over being rudely awakened late at night. He has two children, Becca and Frye, who climb out of bed and dismiss their father when he orders them back to sleep. Harry sits cross-legged on the floor, and Becca handles the scabbards on his back with reverence. Frye sits close next to him, and asks why his eyes are different colors, and shaped like a cats. Sirius hands Harry a hard hunk of bread.
“Regret what?” Harry says, knowing well what Draco means, but wanting to buy time before he must reply.
“Not worth any more trouble, Harry,” Hermione says, typical austerity in her voice. She’s posturing the way she likes to when she is absolutely certain, her round chin high in the air, shoulders square. She is small, but Harry still shrinks before her, even if he rolls his eyes.
Harry doesn’t feel like answering her. The common room stoked them a low-burning fire for the spring night chill. It warms the cotton of the back of his jumper. He’ll indulge Hermione.
“You can sleep in my bed,” Frye says, “Cause I like to sleep in the loft, anyway.” He points up at a few planks and a bed of straw that are wedged between the walls of the house. There’s a rickety, homemade ladder climbing up to it.
Harry walks into the laboratory of Kaer Morhen, where the elder witchers have lined up twenty-three table-like contraptions in messy sequence along the wall. There is a hooded old man, one of the mages most like, resting heavily against a table in the center, which is covered in cauldrons that are bubbling and shining all different manners of potions. Each boy was instructed to remove their armor, wear only underclothes, and to meet here at midnight. The apprentice mages are scurrying about like chickens without heads, pushing glass potion-dripping mechanisms into their proper spaces.
Harry hangs his head back and looks up. “Should I keep it to myself that you’re a Death Eater?” He asks the sky.
After a time, Sirius breaks his silence, which had grown almost meditative, trance-like. “We’ll talk about them,” he says simply, then, “Tonight.” He turns and walks away, two swords on his back. The steel one is named Wolfbite, and the silver is Lune.
Malfoy grimaces, then he turns and kicks an old portrait until the frame comes apart. The frame’s inhabitant starts protesting in a different language, perhaps Latin, so Malfoy kicks straight through the canvas.
Sirius charges at her, turning her attention away from Harry for long enough that he can correct his footing and shake off the incredible despair that she’s bestowed on him. She has beams of sunlight coming out of the holes in her body and she is waving in and out of corporeality, one moment real and the next covered by the veil of the other world. Sirius’ Yrden ward is fading, so Harry casts it again, and the specter becomes fully corporeal once more. She wags her gigantic tongue at him, her eyes dead, white, and angry.
. She takes him into her hand and tugs, and he grips her arm and tugs back, then turns around to get a firm grip on her waist and pull her into his lap in the bath. She is wide-eyed, startled, but excited. She laughs, drawing in close to his face and breathing  hot air against his lips, grinding her hips down on his cock. Harry is glad she knows what she’s doing, because he wouldn’t know how to pace it.
Another boy takes the table next to Harry, and doesn’t so much as look at him. He’s from Lyria, Harry vaguely recalls, but he speaks to no one, and takes this witcher business all too seriously for someone only ten-and-seven, who isn’t even a witcher, yet.
Blaise looks to Draco, not in deferential way, but to inquire. So Draco waves him away, and Blaise herds Pansy gently into the hall. She looks over her shoulder in a pout.
He is supposed to be thespian in the melodrama of secondary school bullying. He is supposed to be Hogwarts considerably more attractive but equally as cruel Dudley Dursley. He is supposed to hate Harry, to give Harry something to hate. Now Harry just feels bad, like he took the game too far without trying.
“Well, it helps me see at night. Like a cat,” Harry tells him, “and I can see farther than you can. I used to wear glasses, but I don’t need them anymore.”
Harry knocks on the door twice and interrupts Ginevra singing a folk song in her mother tongue. Harry can hear the splashing of water, the smell of lavender and calendula, then the padding of bare feet on stone and dripping water. She peaks around the door, her long, wet hair swinging behind, and yanks Harry inside.
“Harry!” Sirius shouts. One of the Noonwraiths is launching at him, great spindly fingers with long, ridged nails in the shape of a claw. Harry cuts her hand off, and all of the other Noonwraiths scream in agony.
There’s a woman in the window, eyes brown, hair braided, and she’s older, and she’s quite pretty. She storms out of the front door and crosses her arms.
“What’s got you cross?” Draco says. There is an air of coolness about him that is mastered. Like Occlumency. Like wearing a mask for so long that it won’t come off.
Then, in devotion to Draco’s brilliant, unmatched fortune, Potter comes stomping out of the Great Hall like a Great Oaf. He’s angry about something, probably, his posture tightly wound, his hand tugging his tie. The Gryffindor colors are strikingly awful, Draco thinks for the hundred-thousandth time.
Harry is thrown backward. His mind is working on a serious delay; it takes him a while to realize the black cloud hovering over Malfoy is Professor Snape. Snape’s wand is weaving out a silver web of magic by a hushed incantation. The blood seeps curiously over Malfoy’s body, reversing time, re-entering his wounds like they never bled. Last, the skins stitches together on its own, the only evidence they’d been there in the clean cuts of his shirt. Malfoy’s breathing slows, steadies, though Harry’s does not.
“So I’d better borrow that cloak again, thanks,” Malfoy says. He leans over and scoops the fabric up.
“Merlin, will you two shut up?” Malfoy clips, “I’m happy to tell your fathers that you failed me because you couldn’t resist desert. Maybe I’ll tell the Dark Lord myself.”
She’s very pretty, and removed from her impressive stack of armor (which she’s piled unceremoniously in the corner) she is quite small. Her boots do well to add to her stature, but really she just reaches Harry’s shoulders.“Do you witchers talk?” she looks at Harry over her shoulder, eyebrow raised, smirking.
“Of course.” Hermione clears her throat and glances away. “Are you alright, Harry? I know how everything has been, since Sirius—“
Malfoy has become wiser to Harry’s stalking. Harry is ambushed. He feels the soreness on his shoulder blades from being slammed against the stone once more. His sweater is balled up in Malfoy’s fists, but Malfoy has to reach for his wand. Harry sees a needle-eye opportunity, and threads it.
Malfoy pulls away, then steps much farther then perhaps he needs to, and for a moment shields himself from Harry like Harry is the sun. “How’d you— not know what the spell did?” His face is flushed.
He presses into something, but there’s no give, so he adjusts a little lower and finds it, and she sinks down on him in response. Her lips part, her eyes close, then some sound comes from deep inside her belly and spills out of her mouth. She’s warm, velvety inside, soft and glove-like, and he can feel her flexing and rutting and moving. Her tits bounce in languid circles, and together they find a rhythm, Harry slamming up as she presses down. He finds her spot again, but she swats his hand away and rubs herself, and her sounds get louder and louder. Blood rushes in Harry’s ears; he could be moaning too, he doesn’t know. Not bad for a first time, he thinks, somewhere off in his mind. Ginevra bends over, bites his shoulders and moans slow, guttural, desperate, and her back pulsates.
Curiously, Malfoy lets the tiny blue bird come from within the cabinet and perch its talons upon his finger. It shows it’s wings off for Malfoy, the delicate line of it’s feathers flexing.
Harry nods, knew Sirius would punish him with silence if he spoke back. The sun sets under the horizon, the sky towards Kaer Morhen a silky indigo, and littered with bright, beautiful stars. The moon is shaped like a thin crescent, waning. In their silence, some commotion is heard, back down the mountain, carrying up the river bed.
But other than that, nothing has left him. Not the annoyance, the impatience, or the anger. Harry supposes he was led to a different impression, but all he can recall is things that others say about witchers. Witchers; Harry reminds himself again that he is a witcher. A little yellow fire lights in his belly, and it’s doused when he remembers the boys that died. He plucks a clump of mushrooms and a happy sprout of green mold, and makes off down the mountain path to the keep.
“I’m Harry… erm, of Toussaint.” It’s continent tradition to state one’s heralding country in greeting, not Skelligan, but she is here, after all. There’s no mistaking the thick accent.
“Alright,” Uncle Sirius walks up to the group of naked boys, “Please choose a table, best not near your friends, and grab a knife.”
“Right. I know. But about Draco, if anyone deserved it, it’s him, after all the tormenting he’s done to us over the years. And that
Harry heads to the chambers, small, cramped beds with little distinction between them. Some of them have been cleaned, made, reset. Ready for new initiates in the next cycle. To train for five years, every day, to learn thousand-page bestiaries to the letter, to stand for hours in the rain on a single foot. To die. Harry is lucky, in a small way.
their uncle, but they call him that, because, well, Harry doesn’t really know why. It’s just something they do. Serendipitously, Sirius was childhood best friends with Harry’s father, and in that way might as well be an uncle to him. He does little to conceal his nepotism
“I’ll see you in the common room,” Harry says, gripping his stomach and wincing like he’s really got to use the loo. Hermione’s eyebrows over her book tells him all he needs to know. He’ll deal with the fallout later.
“Your father was the least obedient a child could possibly be,” Sirius says, “And Gods, Jenny wished he would behave, your Grandmother, that is. He was their singular child, the heir to their estate, and he was wilder than a nobleman’s son should be,” Sirius smiles, recalling memories. ”We met because our families lived in neighboring estates in Beauclair, and we would hop the hedges and sneak around like bandits in our manicured lawns. We spent every possible minute together. I only made the acquaintance of your mother once, to tell it true, but James told me about her amply and she sounded magnificent.”
Most of the herbs, incidentally, are picked completely over. It is the summer after all, and it’s likely that the townspeople are hoping for some extra crowns from the herbalist, so it’s a more difficult expedition than Sirius planned for. They only have a hand full of Celandine flowers and a single Crow’s Eye by high noon. The sun is scorching, and Harry isn’t used to missing so many meals. He lays his gambeson over the back of his horse and continues shirtless, still sweating. There’s a little stream flowing from the top of a hill, so he cups some tepid water and slurps it into his mouth, then dunks his head in and watches minnows float by.
They trail silently along the perimeter of the courtyard. It looks as though it might rain. Draco knows he has to say something, since the two of them walking together for too long might draw a crowd. Being this close to him is bound to end in chaos.
Sirius’ face goes to stone, and he throws back the door to the basement stairs. Damp air floods up and carries all kinds of smells with it, what with all that is stored down there. It’s an affront to the senses. Both of them cover their noses for the descent. Sirius doesn’t speak for a while, not until they are back in the kitchens, and he’s warming his palms by the fire even though it’s the middle of summer. Harry knows not to push it.
The road to Lyria is peaceful, and much lighter and more pleasant outside the old, thick gambeson and in the new, sleeveless jerkin, which Harry says a bit of grace for often. Bless Silagrim and his wife and their children, and especially Mida, because Gods, it’s nice not to have swampy armpits.
“Clever. It’d take you maybe, dunno, a thousand years and change to rifle through all of this rubbish.”
“I’ve stabled my horses with the blacksmith in this village, once. Perhaps—“ Sirius gives his tired horse a good tug on the reins and Harry does the same, and they walk down the empty main road.
“For enemies,” Malfoy mutters eventually. He sneers and pulls his arm away, tending delicately to the cuff of his sleeve. “Do you regret it now?”
Draco doesn’t respond. His heart is racing and he’s ashamed of it, so he does the predictable thing.
Malfoy creeps to the door, stopping just when his fingers meet the handle. He contemplates something and says “Touch me again and I’ll kill you,” before slipping through the exit.
Hermione brushes hair from her forehead. Her and Ron are sitting so close together that the cushions of the couch are bucking up on each side. “I’ll see what I can find about the incantation, I suppose,” she offers
Harry wonders. And wonders again. Then he realizes he didn’t form this Room at all. So he changes the subject.
Harry is acutely aware of the ample gawking when they walk in, Sirius first and then Harry, and they are examined in such an order by most of the pub goers. A little silence comes over the room leaving the bard to fill the space with his bawdy song. Sirius walks like he owns the place, as if his pants didn’t stink of the road and his hair of sweat. There’s a set of redheads at the bar, from Skellige most like, drawing from the accent. The girl laughs- roars, really- at what may have been her own joke, and her companions laugh with her. Her hair is a deep orange, so shiny and straight it moves like a sheet of silk. She throws it over her shoulder when she turns to size up Sirius, then notices Harry.
“Speaking of, I’m turning in,” she leans forward, breathes into Harry’s ear, and whispers, “Third door on the right. Knock twice, I’ll let you in.” She gives him a friendly pat on the back and retreats to her room.
Harry can’t argue that, but he’d sooner die than give up the invisibility cloak, so he says “I can walk down with you.”
Harry can’t make his throat work. It’s difficult enough to say, “Night!” before they ascend to stairs to their dormitories. Okay. He can use
The woman began crying, but showed little indication in her hardened expression, “It’s local know-how not to go on the hill. I’ve never gone myself to see if it’s true, or just something mean some children made up.”
, they called Potter. And here he is now, just shy of a year after Severus’ return, silk shirt soiled with sea water, laying at his feet. It’s amazing how hurriedly men bend at the bribe of a bag of coin.
Aldersberg is the name of smaller city just outside of Lyria. It’s fitted with gigantic stone walls that pop over the horizon miles off and sports a healthy flow of traders in and out, so the road to it is busy, cramped even. Sirius pays the herbalist for some flasks which he fixes to his belt, and they take contracts for some river Drowners and a particular wolf from the notice board. They never do go after the wolf, even though it’s a good offer of forty crowns for the head, but they do scalp the drowners for their fins and collect the measly recompense. Sirius splits it with Harry and they each buy a saddle for their horses, and Harry scores a new set of boots from the local cobbler. He throws the old ones to the side of the road.
He runs back to Sirius, who is fighting her once more. Harry runs towards her, swords straight up in the air, and leaps. He wraps his legs around her exposed pelvis, the bones cracking and pulling apart at his weight. His sword cuts through her spine like butter, and her head goes rolling as Harry crashed down with her body.
It’s bizarre, and Harry feels guilty for the thought, but there is no reason or rhyme that Neville should have survived this long. When he came to Kaer Morhen, he was a sweet, chubby kid and so craven that it made him stubborn. He couldn’t balance a sword, he sneezed on the herbs he picked, and he cried near every night. He’s gotten better with the swords, to be sure, and perhaps he doesn’t cry or sneeze as much, but there is a softness to him that should have broken him open and split him in two. He keeps Harry from drifting too far away, as it is, so Harry doesn’t mind. There’s a great deal of relief knowing Neville somehow survived the Trial, when maybe others deserved it more, or may have been more successful swordsmen. If there are Gods, they chose Neville for something. There’s comfort in that, Harry thinks, but he hopes the Gods didn’t choose him for something too.
“Weasley did? He beat Draco?” one of the youngest girls asks. Harry recognizes her from Quidditch practice. She always sits to Ron’s position in the field and pretends to mind her parchments.
“In your dreams,” Malfoy says, then he raises up and steps around Harry like he is a pile of excrement that he’s trying to avoid.
Except when Severus survived the Trial of the Grasses and returned to Beauclair to find her, she was living in the Potter estate.
Draco’s face twists up. He trembles as he runs his palm flat across his hair, affixing lost strands.
“About that,” Harry clears his throat, “I was hoping you could tell me more about them. About what happened to them.”
The next set of stairs move abruptly and Malfoy falls ungracefully into Harry, who helps to steady him. Draco collects himself then shoves away.
Malfoy laughs, but he does not smile. “I must have missed the lesson.” He pockets his wand, still gripping it tight in his hand. He spins around and keeps on toward the Room.
“It’s my business when I’m certain you’re dealing with Death Eaters. It’s my business when you might hurt somebody else, they way you did Ron. Or Katie.”
stalking, Hermione has given up her opposition. She rolls her eyes laboriously while Harry scoots the bench back to leave. She sighs.
Harry nearly flinches, remembering the vulture-pecking, knife-tearing, molten-searing pain. “Not so bad, really,” Harry lies.
“Can’t wait,” Harry says, hoisting the baskets on top of his head, awkward as they are to carry in front of his stomach. “Could you— Nevermind.”
They are not privy to Harry who is trekking quietly behind them, bashful and invisible. It’s been a long week coming up with a decent ways to distract Crabbe and Goyle so Harry can slip into the Room after Malfoy, unnoticed. Crabbe and Goyle take their position framing the door, their hands crossed firm in front of their stomachs like some kind of muggle bouncers.
Harry looks around at the whirring mess, a cacophony of small, timeless sounds. An old clock strikes twelve every nine minutes. There is a teapot that is bigger around than Harry. Beyond the mess of it all is Malfoy, and the chirping of a bird.
Sirius knocks loudly on the wooden door, even though he is inside with them. They all turn to look, and then Neville gives Harry a great shove on the shoulder to egg him on.
Malfoy is dashing through the hall of toilets, just rounding the corner as Harry comes upon him. He throws another
“Can’t imagine the shit you’ve got up to in this cloak,” Malfoy says, glancing over at Harry, once they are clear of Filch.
“Good, Harry. The good news is if we find a bit extra and can manage to get some flasks, well, we’ve got the makings of some Swallow on our hands.”
Draco laid in bed last night staring at the ceiling, the pretty aurora of green moonlight refracting around the stone-block walls of their dorm. And Blaise asked why he was staring like he was Confunded.
“Our daughter, Mida, died years ago. She was only sixteen, but was set to be married. We had the carpenter fashion her this arch in the woods, a fairytale, like we’d read to her. She was to marry a regular peasant boy, and we had no dowry to give, so it was best that way. Besides, it was clear she loved the boy. Except, ‘fore they married, he was found to be a traitor. She loved him anyway. So they hung her too, in the tree next to him. Makes no sense. But they did it.”
were all very well and good but the items in question would need to be blind, deaf and dumb to conceal the target of the insinuations.
"Yes, Master Potter, he left a letter in the study in case you arrived before him. He was not sure what day you would be coming."
“His father would hardly afford him an allowance for the purpose,” Harry returned, and Sirius conceded the point.
Padfoot whined and looked at him reproachfully. Harry knew what Sirius wanted to say: they should have gone sooner. They could have been happy.
Nonetheless, when Ron reached out a large hand to grasp his, Harry could not help but return his friend's grin. "Harry. Good to see you, mate."
"Oh, please," Lord Draco said with a bright smile that sent unease spiralling through Harry all over again, warring with the odd warmth his presence had elicited. "All my old school chums call me Malfoy." At that he reached out and shook Harry's hand.
"Harry has never lived as a bachelor," Remus pointed out quietly. "He married almost immediately after finishing school."
Draco shrugged. "Necromancy." He shifted on the bed, loving the way his skin moved over Harry's, the rasp of leg and chest hair, the smooth satin of Harry's back. "Fancy an army of Inferi, do you?"
Draco looked down at himself again. He was looking ridiculously sexy today, if he did say so himself. “I rather think I have.”
“Hermione?” He was right, it would have been obvious but for the distance that had grown between the two of them. “Ron, I know she’s the cleverest person we know but surely someone with more experience in the field—”
Sirius, bless him, merely showed Harry to the room he usually stayed in and told him he could reside there as long as he wanted.
The breath left Harry’s lungs in a whoosh. They had done it. They had actually done it. “May I know the nature of this complaint?” Harry forced out.
“Yes, your beloved Ron,” Draco broke in. “The person you chose to befriend at Hogwarts instead of me.”
“Where on Earth did you pick up that obnoxious phrase?” said Pansy. “Still watching those repulsive Muggle television shows?”
"I know that you enjoy the popular entertainments yourself, Lord Malfoy," Harry said, desperate to ease the tension somehow. "After all, who from the highest lord in the land to the meanest servant does not regard Quidditch as the finest sport ever devised?"
Harry nodded slowly. His throat was closing and his ear buzzing. Diggory’s voice was coming to him from very far away. He felt quite light headed and almost as if he was watching all of this take place from the ceiling rather than with his own eyes. Needing to confirm what he was hearing, “So I have been suspended?”
"For the Yule Ball at the Manor," Draco said. "Did I not tell you? It is by far Mother's favourite event of the year. Everyone must wear white or palest blue, most of the Ministry will be in attendance, and the finest families in the land are all invited."
“Ah, yes, Mr Potter, the wizarding hero and the heir to two fortunes looked into renting a room for the lower classes. That seems likely. Try again, Mr Filch?”
"Quite right," Molly nodded. "These years are so precious. Before you know it your children are grown and married. But you must take care of yourself!"
At one particularly brutal thrust, Draco's arm shot forward, knocking over a candlestick on the table. Mercifully the candle went out; Harry doubted he could have stopped even if the whole world burned about them. Draco was keening now, so close, just from this – Harry had not touched his cock at all since turning him over. Harry wondered if he was hurting Draco. He wondered if Draco had been fucked by other men since Harry had been gone, and the thought set his teeth on edge.
Applauding for the end of the first act, Sirius shook his head. "Operas would not exist if it weren't for the messes people make of their lives. The characters never choose someone suitable." For a single man, he sounded rather complacent on this point.
“So that you understand. Whatever fantasy you had of a happy ending is exactly that: Draco chose you because you were out of reach but when the chips are down, he will choose himself every time. He’s not like you.”
He reeled back, clutching his face. When he straightened, Harry had found his wand and the two squared off.
Lady Malfoy was rather lovely when she stopped scowling, and to see her now, it was easy to forget that she had ever been other than perfectly cordial. She smiled at him and kissed Draco's cheek until some of the tension bled out of him.
Ernie clapped him on the shoulder in a friendly way, and re-introduced him to a number of half-remembered schoolmates: Herbert Fleet, who had been on the Quidditch team; Gwendoline Hedgeflower who he remembered fighting at the Battle of Hogwarts; Anthony Otterburn who had been a fixture in the Herbology greenhouse and remembered Neville better than Harry. Some of the conversations were interesting and other less so, but Harry was exhausted when he returned to the hotel that night.
Some of these odd acquisitions he had presented as gifts to Harry: a green enamel ring to 'match his eyes', a pin shaped like an oak tree to signify his 'arbor vitae' – Draco loved using such double entendres and watching how they made Harry's face change.
She was angry with him, but if he tried any harder to please her he was going to have the last of his will smothered out of him. He had to find a way to tell her what it was he wanted.
The Burrow always felt over-full and over-decorated but at Christmastide, with almost 30 guests in the house, both of those characteristics became more pronounced. The walls seemed brighter, the lighting more pronouncedly red, the sound of so many demonstrative people in one space larger. It was all overwhelming, Harry thought, and so far removed from Draco's description of his family's ball that Harry felt his fingernails dig into his palms before he even realised he had clenched his fists.
"I am so sorry, Mr Lynch, I find myself unused to such large gatherings," Harry said in response to the man's expectant expression. "I find myself so easily distracted by the noise and the crowd."
Blaise merely inclined his head. “I can feel the wind changing and Lucius is in the role of Aeolus. He will ruin you to bring Draco into line and Draco is not strong enough to gainsay him. This ends one way for Draco, Potter — back in the loving bosom of his family. How it ends for you is another question. If you broke with Draco now and returned to your wife, well, it might be enough. Better by far to retire to the continent.”
"But it seems I have worried you. And so," he concluded, "I am come here. I know, Sirius, that you have been continuing on the duties of the Potter estates as well as those of the Black family and it has been a great kindness, leaving me free to focus on family and friends, but I am a man grown and I should now take the reins myself."
Harry had pulled Draco back from death once. He was the master of death even then, long before he'd even heard of the Deathly Hallows. He sliced Draco open from throat to groin and watched him bleed for a while into the water on the bathroom floor. Then he'd sealed him back up and made it like it had never happened, except of course for the scar which Draco would always bear.
A memory of an incident whose significance Harry had long denied rose now from the dark recesses of his mind to taunt him; he shoved it away violently.
Draco met his gaze levelly. "I fear that another will steal you from me. I am near consumed with these thoughts and I find myself hating your friends, your godson and most especially your wife and children."
Once inside the red and gold room, Malfoy removed his cloak and handed it to Bertram to hang for him. Harry, completely out of his depth followed suit, handing his own cloak and hat to Kirke before looking around. The décor was just as ugly here, but the room was wider. Two chaise-longues were positioned carefully opposite one another; Malfoy took a seat on one. Harry had rather expected a bed, but there was nothing of the kind, just the two chaises, a fireplace and a thick-looking rug on the floor.
It was the first time Harry could ever remember being unmoved by Draco making such an offer. “I have to go to the Wizengamot.”
. Harry looked at it and wondered if he should write something more, some entreaty or greeting, something more than the bare bones. But he could think of nothing to excite Draco beyond what he had done already and was forced to be content with what he had written.
Sirius offered him a nightcap and the two moved to his study. Harry knew Sirius had something on his mind; as usual it did not take his godfather long to voice it.
Hermione had gripped his shoulder a moment too long when she'd kissed his face in greeting, her expression clearly asking,
"You might at least say goodbye to the boy who sucked your plug-tail," Malfoy remarked as they stepped back out into the street.
He loved Draco, but that love was threatening to undo all of him. He loved Draco to madness and had neglected all his duty. What would he become if this continued?
“Pack up the items belonging to Draco Malfoy. In particular be sure to collect everything overtly wizardly. Then send them to Malfoy Manor and return home. Ensure you are not seen.” With that, Blaise turned back to Harry. “See? House-elf work. Shall we go?”
"It's settled then," Sirius said, his tone brooking no argument, and in short order he and Harry were sitting down to tea. Remus was a morning person, so Harry was not surprised that he at least was fully dressed.
But Lucius was holding out his card and it would be the cut direct to refuse it before all these assembled. Harry considered it anyway, but resigned himself and took it even as he said, “I am sure I could reach you, should I find the need.”
Dumbledore had always told him that his heart was his protection. Perhaps indeed it had been, but now it was become his greatest weakness, so full of conflicting desires that he knew not which to follow.
He pressed the tip to Draco's entrance, which seemed so small despite his having inserted three of his fingers only moments before. He pushed forward just a little and the sensation of the tight sheath gripping his phallus made him lose his meagre grasp on control and he thrust, seating himself deeply within Draco's body.
"You are trying to find a new balance." Sirius nodded. "But tonight you are not facing your death! So perhaps it would do you well to remember that your family and friends love you and will forgive you a great deal."
Harry winced, his selfishness coming back into focus; Ginny saw it at once and reached for his hand.  "I'm sorry," she said gently and for a moment she was herself again, the woman he loved. "I know this sort of thing isn't easy for you, and I truly wish I could be there to support you. You'll have to settle for my idiot brother," she said, giving his fingers a weak squeeze.
Harry was shaking so badly he could barely walk from the room. He did not dare Apparate, certain he would splinch himself, perhaps beyond saving, and he had not the presence of mind to find a Floo gate. Instead he ran blindly out into the streets of Hogsmeade as though a hundred Dark Lords and Death Eaters chased him and kept running even as others on the streets stared, some even calling out to him. He had no thought in his mind at all except to outrun the terrible thing inside him even though he knew it to be utterly futile.
Harry managed to sleep a little that night despite himself. Ron was still his friend, and Sirius would be safe. That was plenty to be grateful for.
Harry twisted his fingers experimentally and Draco's body arched again. Draco's cock was fully erect now, Harry noticed with relief. His own had begun to leak.
He had in fact reminded Harry that he would have to tell Draco he was going. Harry was not relishing the prospect in the slightest.
“It feels as though everything is spinning out of control,” Harry said. He ran his hand over his face, slipping his fingers beneath his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose.  “I don’t know what to do.”
The charge of the moment shifted as Harry looked back at Draco, who had reached to untie his cravat. With one hand he tugged at the knot, his clever fingers working to loosen it. Harry licked his lips unconsciously and Draco smiled.
Harry leaned to the side in order to dislodge Lucius’s hand and to meet his eyes. “You are not on that committee.”
Harry sighed. "I know. Remus, I know. It is just… It has felt in recent times as though I have fallen out of step with all those dear to me. Ron has his career, Hermione has her causes, Ginny has the children and I..."
Draco shook his head. "Nowhere to brew them. Blaise is still in the north, but Nott will be in town."
"Do you enjoy Darjeeling, Lord Potter?" Lucius said as he sat down, indicating to the house elf that the tea should be poured.
Ginny brushed the back of Harry's hand with her fingers. "I am glad it is you, sweetheart," she said.
"Every moment," Draco echoed with a sardonic smile which didn't quite hide the fact that he meant it. "I was so bored. And Nott kept trying to get me to go on the most asinine outings. 'Malfoy, there's a new play at the Royalty. Malfoy, there's a
On their return to the hotel, Harry excused himself to the water closet. He was gone for mere moments but he could tell that Draco's mood had undergone another drastic change in his absence.
"And you," Harry replied honestly. He turned to Hermione and kissed her cheek. "Dear Hermione, how have you been?"
talk of segregating the sexes at Hogwarts if you can believe such a thing. The Founders were of both sexes, I tell the board, they have placed more than adequate protections in place. Magic is the best chaperone, is it not? This is merely a reaction to the work of so many to ensure equal rights for women. Of course, witches can sit on the Wizengamot but you recall the outcry at the appointment of Artemisia Lufkin to Minister?" Harry had drawn breath to concede that he knew what she meant but before he could she continued, "That was fifty years ago and there has been no other woman in that office since! First it will be segregation, then it will be exclusion and then it will be as if we were Muggles and left to receive no formal educati0n at all!"
It was terribly gauche of him, he knew, to think of how much these kinds of luxuries would cost, but it brought home to him again the wealth and power of the Malfoy family. His trepidation increased tenfold.
“Do you want someone who’ll be on your side no matter what happens? Someone who has read every book on every subject, who will know all your rights and all the legal precedents and fight dirty for you if she has to? Because I can’t think of anyone better.”
Draco did not come back. Harry dined in the hotel, eating quickly, and returned to a room still empty. He took a long bath thinking of the day before when he and Draco had shared it.
," and it was Draco this time, paralysing his father and sending him to the floor. His wand shook a little as he aimed it but he managed the spell and his voice was even.
Harry paused for a moment. He knew Draco to be capable of much, many terrible things, but this? “No.”
"You blame me still I think," Draco said. "For disrupting your marriage. For turning you into a mandrake, as though it was not something within you." Draco's face was pinched, unhappy, the way it always was when he displayed something he was uncomfortable with the world seeing. "You love me, yes, but would you have chosen to?"
"How do you do?" Lord Malfoy responded, eyeing the finest robes Harry had ever owned with a disdainful eye. Lord Malfoy was notoriously a class snob and the fact that he was even deigning to acknowledge Harry Potter the half-blood was either a testament to Harry's notoriety or perhaps…
Abruptly the doors opened, and it was indeed too late. Lucius Malfoy entered the room in a whirl of black robes and ice blond hair, a house elf miserably chasing after him and pleading to be allowed to announce him.
He followed Malfoy through the foyer into what seemed to be a parlour done in a shoddy attempt at the fashionable style for Greek Revival. The parlour was up a staircase and through a long corridor, and there were almost a dozen young men inside in various states of dishabille, sipping on green drinks and smoking fit to fill the entire room with heavy fog. Filch walked in behind them and closed the door even as the boys variously greeted Malfoy, some as "my lord" and some with mere nods. It was clear that Malfoy knew all of them.
“It’s Auror Weasley,” came a familiar voice. Harry laughed his relief; he had wondered if an old enemy would take this opportunity to take him out permanently or, worse, if some misguided former DA members would try to break him out, making everything worse.
Harry looked at her sharply but, sensing nothing but humour, smiled at her wryly. "At the very least you are more like yourself, which is delightful."
"Mother, please let Mr Potter alone, he is here to support his wife in regaining her strength," Zabini said in exasperation.
Draco laughed shortly and reached for his robe, pulling his wand from a pocket. Instinctively, Harry reached for his; Draco noticed the movement.
“Relevant? Perhaps it isn’t, to you. Perhaps I needed to remind myself. I let myself become so constrained by everything you expected of me – all of you,” and he could not but help a glance to Hermione at this, “that I forgot what I owed to myself. I was fourteen when Professor Dumbledore told me ‘there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right’ and I let myself become confused about what was right. And it is simply this: I will stand here and tell you the truth. I fell in love with a man.”
"Remus has always been very kind," Harry agreed. "To Sirius and I both. But Teddy is his priority, naturally."
Place the stone on the body's forehead, aim the Elder Wand to point into the head straight through the stone. "
“You could resign, I suppose,” Sirius said. “But that would give credence to any talk already existing. You could go home to Ginny.”
Hermione didn’t even look at him. “Minister, my understanding was that it is the accused’s right to choose their advocate. Is it not so?”
"I'm fine, Dobby," Harry said as he walked into the foyer. "If you can just let Sirius know I am here?"
"And there's still his friend, Lupin," said Lucius, his eyes boring into Harry's. A sense of terrible trepidation shot through him; something in Lucius' face warned of danger.
“Perhaps.” It occurred to Harry, not for the first time, that he barely knew anything about his wife’s state of mind these days. “She is I think much improved, fully recovered from Lily’s difficult birth.”
"What have you known of responsibilities wearing the soul out?" Harry heard himself retorting. "You never married, you never had children – why not? Was it perhaps you who was afraid?"
He had not been sleeping well even before Kirke and Lucius and Ginny had all struck him in quick succession. Now he was barely sleeping at all. Instead he made increasingly violent, frantic love to Draco who took everything he had to give with desperation in the lines of his body. They both knew time was running out.
Harry shivered at the thought. Yes, it was true, he knew it. He caressed Draco's hair as Draco knelt still, his head in Harry's lap. He should have been sated, he knew, and he
"Harry, we were just looking for you," Hermione began, with a smile on her face which froze as she saw something behind him.
"I am gratified to hear it," Lord Malfoy said smoothly. "Family values are so important. A pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter."
He sat down and covered Draco’s hand with his own. “Are you anxious about us being apart?” For they had barely parted for moments in days.
At twenty minutes past the hour, Harry sighed and poured himself a glass of brandy from the decanter at the side of the room.
"Those days are such a blur," Harry confessed. "Always something to do, some threat to my life or someone else's. Ginny would say I couldn't see past my nose." A flash of discomfort at the thought of Ginny, as always, but Harry let it pass.
Harry crossed the space between them, the now-familiar rush of intoxicating lust taking over. He reached for Draco's hand and placed a kiss almost like a bite to his wrist.
Harry never knew how to handle Sirius on the rare occasions when he became serious about something. "I would rather not—"
Harry was not amused by this display at all. "So you kept me waiting for two hours because you were playing at cards? I have been sitting waiting for you all that time – why? Because it amused you to make me wait?"
“Draco, I fail to see how visiting your parents for tea again will be any less awkward than last time. Particularly after I faced off with your Father over that bill Rosier wants to pass.”
“And if not this then what could the blackmail attempt have been about, madam?” Lucius demanded. “Should we not know for certain, if only to clear the accused once and for all?”
The rest of the evening passed in something of a blur, Malfoy's card burning a hole in Harry's pocket where it lay nestled against his pocket watch. Harry met admirers and renewed old acquaintances as best he could, but he could feel those smirking eyes on him every time he moved.
"I have to," Draco replied. It was true: he was an Unspeakable now, and a new breed of Dark Wizard had everyone researching magics that would have been illegal a few scant years before. The rumours flew endlessly around the Ministry, around the world: they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Harry replaced his cup in its saucer. "I will go to the Burrow; I cannot disappoint the children, and of course I am keen to see them myself. Ginny has already written to me to ask that I go to Godric's Hollow a little in advance of the trip." He smiled. “She tells me that James has grown a whole inch!”
Harry winced slightly; he couldn't imagine that life as a Malfoy servant was particularly pleasant. As he stepped into the room, his feet sank into deep oriental carpet. Above hung a pink glass chandelier, almost certainly imported from Italy.
Sirius had employed a nanny for the duration of their stay, a Scots girl named Morag MacDougal. It was with no considerable relief that Harry left James and Albus, now fully awake, in her care and closed the door to Sirius' study.
Harry kissed him back just as fiercely, just as urgently. A leap of desire rising inside, Harry clutched at Draco's hair, his face, his clothes. The exhilaration of the first time returned but it was no longer the terrified thrill of jumping from a tower - it was instead the infinite freedom of the first flight on a broomstick.
Harry, still shaken to the core, stormed into Hyde Park as though he too would spend his day breaking things.  It would always be like this, he knew. Having Draco for a lover was like feasting with panthers. Or perhaps a snow leopard would be more apt.
"Not long," she said, returning to her usual brisk manner. "I will begin immediately if you would be good enough to watch Rose?"
Terry Boot had been a boy genius and a bookworm. Once he was of age and after a bit of restructuring post-war, Flourish & Blotts became Flourish, Blotts & Boot, and it was there Draco knew to look for him.
What she would have said next Harry would never know, as the door on the other side of the suite opened and Draco emerged.
"Draco, we have had this conversation before," Harry said, a warning creeping into his tone. "I am still a man with a family. But it will be perhaps a fortnight at most..."
Sirius' eyes narrowed. "I know that you have not been quite yourself in the wake of Ginny's complications," he said, "but there is very little point in your having come to town at all if you do not present the baby to society."
"Nothing to fear," Harry echoed. Of course there was nothing to fear. Harry had once blazed defiance and strength into the face of the Dark Lord Voldemort. He had always been rather mild-mannered and this attitude had become more and more of a habit in recent years to the point where he even felt himself meek, but he had not expected that even Sirius would have been so deceived. The self-loathing threatened to flare again; Harry forced it down.
Harry looked into Sirius' eyes.  He had never seen it before, the kindness in him that was so like Remus – that perhaps he had even learned from Remus over their time together.  They had been separated for years and never ceased to love one another.  Harry feared that if he left Draco alone for more than a month the man would disappear into the arms of a rent boy and never emerge.
. He had enjoyed his marital relations, had found pleasure in Ginny's embrace, but had never known desire like this. As Draco rubbed against him, lining up their two cocks and thrusting, Harry felt crescendos and conflagrations, as though his very being would ignite and meld completely into Draco's. Or perhaps they would both be lost to the fires and it wouldn't matter because it would feel like this forever and always.
“Is that a joke? He had hundreds and an Auror on the payroll. Harry,” Draco walked around him to impress him with the seriousness of his words, “we can’t beat him. He has friends everywhere, fingers in all the pies and he is an aristocrat. You… you think too middle-class.” Harry made a noise at this but Draco persisted. “You do, Harry. You are a hero to many of course but you have not played on that or leveraged it and that was fine when you wanted to live quietly but if you want to face down the Establishment you cannot do it from your current position.”
Draco made some terrible incoherent sound as Harry ran his tongue along the rim of his hole. Fingers scrabbled at the table edge when Harry did it again, licking and tasting that most secret part of his lover. His beloved. He could think it now, even though he said it but rarely; saying the words felt too much like putting his soul into Draco's keeping, more even than when the two were connected in the most intimate of joinings.
"What are you…" Harry began, but then Draco had moved his mouth and Harry felt his testicles being licked thoroughly, first one then the other. It was an utterly new sensation and it made his whole body jerk with pleasure until Draco pulled away all together.
Harry looked at Malfoy and would not look away, willing Malfoy to look back at him. Malfoy fidgeted under his gaze before finally throwing down his cards. "Very well," he said, standing abruptly and stalking away.
“If that is what you need, Draco,” he said, tired and hopeless and not enough, not quite ever enough to be what anyone he loved truly needed from him. “If that is what you want.”
The rest of the afternoon and into the evening was a barrage of questions, spells and suggested counter-potions, interrupted only when Rose demanded her mother's attention. "Do you know when you might have been slipped a potion? Have you ruled out the
Harry sighed deeply and sank into a chair. “We could talk this through for ever and I doubt I’d grow closer to seeing a way out of this mess.”
The shield charm took the brunt of it, but Harry lashed back as a cut appeared on his chin; Draco had aimed the curse at his chest and only part of it had struck him. Harry touched the sore spot and came away with bloodied fingers. He stared at Draco in shock. Draco seemed frozen to the spot.
Lucius, Lord Malfoy stood in front of him. He was almost exactly like Draco though a good twenty-five years or so older and more richly dressed. His voice was silkier than his son's, his gaze more calculating. Draco's passionate fury had in his father been tempered either by age or by judgement into a quiet menace which lay under the surface even as Lord Malfoy took Harry's hand and shook it.
Lucius was still talking. “If Draco was here you would expect him to relive the humiliation, would you? You would need my son to tell you all the details of how Potter’s aggression made him feel before your would believe—”
Harry did not want to answer, but neither could he lie to the person who had brought him such pleasure. "No, it was not."
"I believe she will arrive very shortly," Arthur said in a kind tone. Harry could almost see the effort Molly was expending not to speak out; he was not hard pressed to imagine what choice words she must have for him, perhaps worsened by how very much she had always loved him.
Harry looked up, tears welling in his eyes. “Sirius, no. No. You have borne so much. You and Remus both. But you have one another now?”
“I don’t want that,” Harry managed. “I don’t. Just… thank you for trying to help me. But it’s over now.”
Harry slept badly that night, as he had for so many nights. When he did manage to sleep, he dreamed of Draco’s memory, displayed for the world to see and judge. He heard Lucius’s voice, remembered Blaise’s warning. Some times he relived bits and pieces of pleasure-filled memory but it always ended when he recalled the expression on his wife’s face that day in the hotel suite.
Fawley had been watching this interaction and said, with a kindly tone, “I think that’s enough time, Lord Potter.”
Draco moaned low in his throat and looked up at Harry, anguished. "That is what I most desire and you know it. But Harry, I can't, not like this. I would only hurt you."
have him, Harry thought with a mutinous determination he had not felt since his brief rebellion at the age of fourteen. I shall.
"I know," Harry interjected with some force, conscious of the doorframe and the people beyond it and everything else which might intrude on this moment and make it worse, so much worse. "I have hurt my wife and I will endeavour to desist from doing so but do not tell me that you know how my marriage has been."
Harry was desperate to snap at the man but Draco's face prevented him from doing so. "Perhaps the title Lord Black will fit better," he said as mildly as he could.
That was true, too. And it was also true that he had not considered that Kirke might not like what he was doing, did it instead of starving. Harry had been jealous of him – for what?
"What? Oh - yes," Harry said, recovering himself, but not quite quickly enough. Sirius appeared to notice the slip but chose to see it as mere distraction at the thought of Christmas.
One night as Harry slipped his fingers inside a pleading Draco, the thought occurred that this was the most assured he had felt since he had commanded Tom Riddle search his soul for remorse.
Ginny spared the Malfoys another glance. "It would be no small thing to stand up to that man," Ginny said.
"Er, I see you have a pine tree," Harry said, desperate for something to speak of. "Following the latest fashions?"
"Now listen to me, Draco," Lord Malfoy said, his voice deadly. "You can indulge your dissolute habits as long as you are discreet; all men have weaknesses. But if you sincerely believe that I will not cut you off should you fail to show more interest in your family's affairs then you are sorely mistaken. I will not have you ruin in one generation what it took nineteen to build!"
Harry found the letter on the desk and read it quickly: Sirius apologised but had been dragged away to go hunting by a head of department.
In the centre of the assembly room stood Lucius, Lord Malfoy. His hair gleamed in the light, and as he turned, Harry felt a mental blast as steel grey eyes met his.
. If he could have found his voice he would have begged, as Potter began to bob his head up and down, paying special attention to the head, working his lips over the top before sinking back down again to take Draco deep into his throat.
Harry's body is almost perfect. It isn't Harry's original body, of course. They were clever: they burned that one.
The Wizengamot deliberated for four hours. Harry and Hermione ate lunch together in the little room off the court, in silence. The food at least was considerably better than what Harry had been eating in prison, and he made a point of telling her so.
Harry closed his eyes against the rising tide of lust. His body was shaking already, he could feel it.
He tried working off the excess energy through exercise, attending fencing practice regularly. But then one day the dark-skinned man with whom he had seen Malfoy talking at the opera appeared – Zamboni, was it? – and Harry did not dare go back.
"It's some comfort, though I barely felt like myself even as I spoke," Harry admitted. "Will we have much time to talk?"
Lord Malfoy and Draco were walking up from the next Apparition point; Draco was in front, evidently trying to outrun the lecture he was receiving. Crabbe was behind them, but Lady Malfoy was nowhere in sight and Harry wondered why she had not chosen to attend.
Malfoy did not speak. His eyes caught Harry's, focused and determined as Harry was sure his own must be wide and fearful.
,” Draco snarled. He whirled around, his wand suddenly in his hand and shot a jet of light at the mirror, which shattered. Harry flinched from the sound. “I am sick of hearing about her. And your great betrayal and what this has cost you, always you.”
"That explains why you reek of cigars and why you seem so tired. Did he not offer you any Pepper-Up potion?"
"You're beautiful," Harry said quietly. "I always saw that but I didn't understand why it disturbed me so much before. I know I said terrible things before but… I want to come alive, Draco and I think with you I can."

Ginny had already taken a sleeping draught by the time Harry went to check on her, so he need not have braced himself for her displeasure at going out without her. Ginny had been fractious recently, which was not at all like her, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that it was merely the effect of pregnancy.
"No?" Harry sighed. "Do you need me to say it? I want you." The words were so much easier than Harry had thought, a pleasure to say, in fact and so he said them again: "I want you. I want you to touch me. I'm so tired of denying it, Draco." Harry's voice caught on Malfoy's given name, a little hitch in the middle, but it made Malfoy's fingers fumble the billiard ball; he had to brace himself, both hands on the edge of the billiard table. His back was a rigid arch. His hair and the back of his neck glowed in the soft light.
Ron and Hermione were godparents to both James and Albus, but Harry was certain they wouldn't be offended. "Lily Luna," he tried. The baby girl in his arms looked at him with her eyes bright and wide, and Harry felt everything in the world focus on her. "Perfect," he breathed, his eyes only for his daughter. "Ginny, she's perfect."
It was the thirty-first of July. Draco waited for the date, relying on its significance to lend power to his actions.
Harry raised his eyes to Sirius, who seemed to flinch away from the expression in them. "Yes, they are."
“Right,” Hermione said, clearing her throat. “Then we’re just going to have to prepare the best defence we can. Remind everyone of who you are and what you’ve done for all of us. Meanwhile I’ll look into legal statutes, magical and Muggle, and see if there’s any kind of loophole that might get you out of this.”
“He’d have to,” Draco said, but Harry could tell he didn’t quite believe it himself. “I could convince mother, I know it, and she is the only person he ever really listens to. We could have a life together, a real life.” Draco had grown closer to Harry and took another step now, sinking to his knees. “The Blacks had a cottage in Provence. Imagine a life there, drinking wine, socialising with other men of fashion. Walking and touching in the open. It’s sunny there most of the time. You’d love it, Harry. You could get a suntan while I’d be doomed to use a parasol like a woman, I suppose, but it would be the two of us and it could be good.”
Groaning, Harry freed his own cock at last and pulled Draco's hips back to meet his. What a sight they must make, Draco naked with his clothes discarded on the table and chairs, Harry fully clothed with only his cock free, slowly sinking deep into that beautiful body.
"I know it is against all reason," Harry went on, "but I could never give him up."  He tightened his arms around himself and waited, breathless, for what Sirius would say to that.
Dobby brought Harry food to his rooms; Sirius had indicated that he would be available to Harry any time he felt ready to talk but that was unlikely to be soon. Harry felt hollowed out, hurt and furious. Lucius had beaten him, and Draco had pulled away from him. Still, he thought about a life where he had never realised this truth about himself, never spent time with Draco and though it would have been quieter, easier, it would have been half-lived.
"I've been Siriused," Harry moaned, sliding down on to the chaise longue and resting his head on Draco's lap. "He has been overindulging himself and insists that I join him."
"Potter," he snarled as Harry brushed past him. "I will give you yet another piece of advice you will not heed, though it may be the best advice you will ever receive."
Terry was behind the counter as always, all dark hair and glasses and lean lines. Draco reflected how narcissistic his attraction to Potter must be. "Terry," he said quietly.
Harry wasn't particularly enjoying the journey to London himself. Mercifully James and Albus had slept most of the way; Harry doubted his long-term ability to contain their natural exuberance in such a small space.
Harry brooded on that a little as he made his way to the Atrium. One end was devoted to fireplaces for those travelling into and out of the Ministry. At the other, beyond the ever-unnerving Fountain of Magical Brethren, was a dining hall which Harry had visited before, but not often. The space appeared to be letting natural light through from above though Harry was certain that must be a charm given how the Ministry was put together. Numerous plants hang in charming baskets from various points at the ceiling and Harry’s half-remembered Herbology lessons told him they were all edible, although some had scents intended to increase the appetite. The effect when combined with the shimmering spots of gold light reflected from the fountain was light and airy and most pleasant.
Strengths: Sexy, experienced, grasp of advanced strategy, fabulous hair, snappy dresser, smooth, sophisticated, in control.
Sirius nodded.  "Propitious timing. My cousin Nymphadora fell pregnant.  The young man in question had departed for overseas and as she was unmarried, the scandal would have damaged the family for years."
Draco flinched away. "Let's go, Harry. Mother, I apologise for the scene." And he swept out of the manor, magnificent and free.
“I requested a reward for the return of a letter written in his own hand alluding to acts such as we have discussed, that much is true.”
Draco rolled his eyes. "Lord, no. No, Father takes a great deal of pleasure in reminding me what a disappointment to him I am at every opportunity. I have been of age for years but he will not trust me with the running of any business affairs of importance, so I find myself quite idle - which in turn, brings further wrath down upon me." He shrugged, trying to appear careless but Harry was not fooled.
Harry pressed his knuckles to his mouth. "I betrayed my wife," he said and the words made her real again. Ginny, vibrant and fiery and full of joy. Ginny who grounded and centred him. Ginny who had given him children. He swallowed hard against the rising bile in his throat.
In the gloom, Harry could not tell if Kirke’s complexion changed at all, but the boy did take a step back. “Now, Mr Potter, I…”
"He will hear by the end of the month," Remus said. "But speaking of Teddy, I must get back to him and the others."
The Resurrection Stone took pride of place on the walnut sideboard in the corner of the room; Draco would have liked to wear it as a ring, of course, but the idea made Harry uncomfortable.
Harry wanted to tell Sirius that he already was, by virtue of his new-found vice; however, his resolve to behave less like a child did not seem robust enough yet to survive such melodrama. "I am sorry. I only… Nothing has quite worked out as I hoped it would."
Harry’s eyes widened in alarm as the dirty, dishevelled owner of the brothel where he’d had his first same-sex experience shambled in and vowed to tell only the truth.
Her eyes narrowed, as the clockwork in her brain considered. “I imagine he is going somewhere with this, to be certain. But I cannot see how he intends to accuse you and leave Draco out of it.”
Except the half-remembered story Harry whispered into the space between Draco's shoulder blades one night when the dreams became too much for him. For all the slaughter he had seen, it was that first death, Cedric's death, that Harry could never forget.
Harry had missed something; the Wizengamot as a whole was bursting into life. Some booed, others shouted objections, a few even seemed to be in support but were largely drowned out by the others.
Harry might be a little slow on the uptake sometimes but he was not stupid. "I told you, they are my wife's team," he said coldly. "I do not believe that would be at all appropriate."
Draco finished his cigarette and stubbed it out. He stood at once, making one swift motion to kneel in front of Harry, pulling his legs apart and leaning between them. He pressed his face into the hair growing there, inhaling deeply. "I love the smell of you," he said, his voice a little rough. "I love it best now, when you smell also of me."
He was somewhat relieved when Madam Pomfrey came to him a few hours later to say simply, "It's started. Your wife is having the baby."
Ernie was talking. “Indeed! I confess I did rather wonder what you were doing with all your time in town.”
It was nice. They used to do this all through the League season, he remembered. Ginny had wanted to play for the Harpies even though her mother told her it was unladylike. Ginny had never worried overmuch about that kind of thing and Harry had encouraged her to try out, had shared her disappointment when she was not selected. The team had invited her to return the following year but by then she and Harry were married and Harry had wanted to start a family.
Harry did not know where to look, what to think. His mind was no longer awhirl: rather it was almost completely blank. Some seismic shift had happened deep within him and he felt wiped clean, exhausted and confused and almost like weeping.
Ginny flushed a little, it not being at all the done thing to refer to her condition even obliquely, but she followed Dobby inside willingly enough even as Harry woke his sons.
Harry had been lingering in the corridor for the better part of an hour waiting for Malfoy to decide to retire. The alcohol seemed to have smoothed his usual sharp edges away. Harry reached out on impulse to touch his face.
There were some strange blanks in Harry's fantasies. He wasn't sure what two men would do together. he knew that it was Malfoy's face he saw before him most every night. In the dreams, Malfoy had replaced Ginny in that hotel bed and Harry ran his hands over acres of pale chest instead of freckled curves.
"Kreacher," Harry said and the house elf appeared at once. "I believe we will have a guest for dinner."
With a soiree of such distinction taking place in such a public area, and a place without Floo access no less, Harry knew Sirius had gone to great lengths to ensure that the guests would encounter minimal difficulties in travelling to the park. Portkey centres had been set up to allow entry at certain points around the site, with house elves waiting to take cloaks and hats from the guests. Apparition points had also been made available, but with a strict RSVP policy so that time slots could be allocated.
Draco turned, his face livid. In his hand was a letter; Harry frowned and looked to the window. Sure enough, there was an owl perched on the sill.
Harry’s fingers tightened on his wand. “I have had a very poor few days and my temper is short. I have no patience for your double-talk.”
Harry found a bench and put his head in his hands. All the choices before him were bad, and he knew it.
He saw the boy give a small pleased smile. Good. He was much too hesitant for all the brains he had in that Hufflepuff head of his.
"You know that isn't what we meant, Harry," he paused in exasperation. "Right, Hermione's going to be the only one trying to help you from now on, because I am giving up! Tell me when you want to stop being a completely crap friend and a miserable person."
"For now the password is 'bowtruckle'; you may change it whenever you like. I trust that you would like to get settled in now?"
looking equally uncomfortable, and nervously rubbing his left arm. Ah, Harry supposed he was right to be afraid that parents would say hateful things about a former Death Eater teaching at Hogwarts. Surely some would, but Harry hoped it wouldn't be too bad. If Draco had been acquitted, and Harry had found it within himself to speak in Draco's defence at his trial, then the rest of the Wizarding World should have no problem accepting that it was safe for him to teach their children.
Three hours in, and he had been making progress — perhaps slower than most days, but progress nonetheless — and he was very glad for a break when there was a sharp rap on the door. He didn't much care if it involved wrangling
They went down to breakfast together, just as they always used to — but now if they'd just been snogging fifteen minutes before, no one had to know. They often hung out with Neville in the small front room of Harry's quarters, and life was amazing.
Harry made a frustrated noise. "Then we won't let them. We've been trying way too long at this, this is ridiculous."
, you know. But the whole practise in general is considered pretty rude, so I’d refrain.” He let his magic crush the spell with more ferocity than really necessary. “
— you’re shite at public speaking!” Several people laughed at that, and Harry laughed too, making his way over to the bride and groom to hug them.
Harry checked to see if the potion was cool enough to pour, and distributed it into the waiting vials, reveling in the routine of it all. He heard the door chime faintly as he magicked the cauldron clean, and quickly quashed the bolt of hope that went through him. Every time the door had chimed all week, some part of his mind hoped it would be Draco, which made very little sense, seeing as he had just come in last Friday, and he was unlikely to have run out of anything in a week—
"I don't know that we need to do all that," Harry laughed nervously. "Just kiss me. If you're okay with it, that is?"
Fawley too, if my eyes serve me — is eyeing you up like dessert. You may want to be careful there." Draco said softly, moving the conversation back away from his embarrassment at Harry's serious compliment.
quite liked potions, if you hadn't noticed. And I had a Ravenclaw tell me today that she much preferred my teaching to Slughorn already."
Well. Whilst Harry wanted to gag at the wording, at least they were no longer pushing the idea that Draco had somehow drugged him or something.
Flopping back down, Harry listened to see if any of the other boys was awake yet. Only hearing even breathing and snores, he resigned himself to staring at the curtains as always. Strangely though, Harry felt antsy and unable to just lie and stare as he had gotten so used to doing.
Draco flopped down on the bed with a groan. "Remind me never to play drinking games with Rodya ever again."
Harry had, indeed, come armed with a large mug full of strong English breakfast tea, as per Draco's preference. Draco smiled.
Harry shrugged. "It was Draco's idea, really. Get people to stop treating me like I'm some sort of perfect, untouchable saviour, and stop treating him like a pariah."
He rolled onto his side and gestured at the mess. "Can you...? I don't have my wand." Harry waved his hand.
"I know. I know, and he knows, and he's not seeking forgiveness for any of that. But he's not his father. You know I hated his guts when we were younger, I get it. But he's a different person.
"Er...alright." Harry said. Draco seemed to have gone through many different stages of...emotion or whatever
"No, it did — as well as it could. I guess we're still friends, I don't know, we haven't really talked and I prefer it that way."
The Prophet flipped closed as he tossed it back onto the counter and stretched. He scoffed again (just as he had when he'd received it the morning before) at one of the 'sneak peek' articles advertised on the front page. Apparently, if you flipped to page three, you could read 'All About Which Witch Has Caught The Saviour's Eye'.
happening, so Draco had decided it was a non-issue. However...maybe it wouldn't be prudent to fill Harry in. He
It was close to an hour before Harry decided he'd eaten enough. He thanked the house elves again and walked back to his dorm, not bothering to look out or be covert. He was slightly disappointed when he finally entered the common room and had not been stopped a single time on the way. Regardless, he hazarded a guess that he was not supposed to
When Harry had finished looking at the plans for some of the new products and talking about the shop, he had gone back downstairs, only to discover that Ron and Draco were
"Bit dramatic. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have made breakfast, would you? Because I can smell toast and eggs, and
"Ooh is that chicken parmesan?" Hermione asked. "It smells delicious! We brought some white wine that should go well with it."
want to have to obliviate his coworkers. Or at least, that was the concern he was trying to keep his brain focused on. He tried to ignore his heart hammering in his chest.
"Well, don't forget you have invaluable sneak peeks into the next Sytnikov crime thriller in those letters. Can't just let anybody see these things, you know." They paused. "Although, my editor was not very fond of either of the scenes, so they may not make it in after all, but still precious!" They tapped the side of their head and winked.
Ron had bargained Hermione down from using full names to avoid having 'Bilius' on the invitation. The letter itself was beautiful, as he was sure the wedding would be, but it was also terribly presumptuous.
Draco unconsciously worried the side of the ring with his thumb as he thought, and he felt his goddamned snitch of a...well,
"All of you stay here and look over the notes or something," he said quickly before grabbing Harry's arm and rushing down the hall.
Draco picked up his book from the floor and quickly found his page, actually placing the bookmark in his place so he might not have this problem again. "I take it I won't be reading anymore tonight?" He questioned, gesturing towards the book.
"O...kay?" He hesitantly followed her to the nearest exam room, and she knocked lightly on the door before entering.
It had barely been an hour and he hadn't even had but one shot, but Draco felt absolutely hammered on energy alone. He wound his way through the crowd, grinding blindly on whomever happened to be nearest. A couple of times he'd ended up making out with some guy who was dancing back against him. He hoped whomever his next victim was was going to be up for a bit more than some heavy snogging because he was incredibly horny at this point.

"Draco." Harry came up behind him and covered his mouth with a hand, resting his chin on his shoulder. "It's going to be fine. I promise. It'll be good to introduce you and all that, even if we're not
"I'm fine. I live on the edge of Muggle London because I spend most of my public life as a Muggle. Which, if you're wondering, is quite a bit more difficult than you may think. Apparently Muggles need 'papers', which, as vague as they sound, are ostensibly imperative. As a wizard, I don't have them, but the man who hired me didn't ask like the others, just pays me in cash. I was told by the other places when I suggested such an arrangement that it's illegal, but what am I supposed to do? Be reborn as a Muggle?"
The lift opened and he got out, wiping the exhaustion from his face. He could pretend for an hour. For the children.
There was a short, awkward silence — a rarity in the Burrow — as everyone just watched, before Molly finally said "Well...happy Christmas, then," to Draco with a plastic smile.
"I think we need to start trying to act normally. He looked about two seconds away from going completely mad. Just try not to think about...things. I mean Professor Longbottom's
Harry managed to reach out for toast, and got it onto his plate. He didn't think he had given his hand permission to let go, but the food had made it to his plate, so he figured it was alright.
"Harry, you have to— the way you look at him sometimes, it's like you used to look at Ginny when you first started dating. And the way you two act around each other...it's strange. You two are probably some of the most guarded people I know, and yet you're so comfortable with each other. You don't find that strange?"
Molly had been noticeably less cold to him, and Draco thought Harry must have had that talk with her, which made him a bit uncomfortable. He already felt he was intruding on the family gathering, and the idea of Harry asking for more on his behalf made him feel guilty.
Harry's hand on his shoulder broke his concentration, and he jumped slightly; however, his face quickly eased into a smile once he saw it was Harry.
. But then, every time they raised their hands, they would ask something along the lines of 'Why was Professor Malfoy in your room last night?'
"Like I said, you're a big boy, learn some control," he bit out, trying to focus on slowing his heart and calming the adrenalin flooding his system.
"Really? I don't believe you for a second. Even as hapless as you were in school, nothing adds up otherwise."
Harry smiled, and Draco watched the corners of his eyes crinkle. He wondered if he could ever brew a potion that made him feel
Harry was awoken by a rather creative list of expletives being screeched in quite a close proximity to him. Obviously he was quite effectively and entirely woken up.
"Sorry," he choked out, still laughing. "Perhaps we should relocate to the room, where there is a significantly lower chance of being injured."
On a rather related note, he was incredibly surprised he hadn't gone completely grey. He had yet to find a single grey hair, which was perhaps normal for an ordinary 22-year-old, but he didn't think it so for one who had been working on saving the entire world for half of his life.
for us to wait any longer and allow you to go about unchecked when something could be seriously wrong. We've already waited several weeks, and— "
Harry woke him up gently by stroking his hair, and kissing his nose lightly so it tickled. Draco wrinkled it, and sniffed.
time anyway. He continued up to the dorm room, and was surprised to open the door to a wash of noise.
"Right." Draco grabbed the drinks and brought them back out to the living room, Harry following behind, shooting his friends a sheepish look.
Sometimes when Harry looked at him like that, all soft and loving, it took him a bit to remember how to remind himself that it wasn't real. Sure, Harry was a very loving person, and Draco didn't doubt that he cared for him a lot, but it wasn't that kind of love. They weren't another Ron and Hermione, and they were never going to be. He needed to remember that.
"Ah, we'll have to take a rain-check. I forgot, we have to see how our appearance at the Ministry Gala last night was taken," Draco said, casting about for change on his desk, and dropping a knut into the coin pouch on the owl's leg.
"I, uh...yeah, I think there's instructions that came with it," Harry told Ron. "I've not tried it either."
He looked out over all of the students from his seat at the staff table. It was amazing how he thought he'd miss a lot of them — and some of them would be gone from Hogwarts for good. Harry sighed and turned to Draco.
Draco looked over at Harry with glazed eyes and let out a small exhilarated laugh. His eyes quickly began to droop closed and Harry's followed of their own accord. He let his exhaustion take over, and the last thing he remembered was curling into warm arms before he drifted off.

"Well you're not wrong about me having been a royal prat," he said with a wry grin. "Hello Weasley," he said pleasantly to Ron's face in the flames.
"I'm glad you like them," Molly smiled at him, and directed a mug his way, before turning her attention to little Victoire, who was tearing open a similarly lumpy parcel.
The next morning, they were back at Hogwarts. They went down to breakfast late, after reading the Prophet in the privacy of their room. It would do no good to be reading it for the first time in the view of those who had already done so.
He took a small note out of his pocket, affixed it to the vase with a light sticking charm, and hurried out of Harry's office. It wouldn't do to be seen anywhere other than the dungeons, as he'd slipped away from breakfast early with the excuse that he'd needed to prepare for class.
The crackling fire in the Gryffindor common room meandered through his brain, and he thought of the evening before. Hermione had succeeded in actually getting into the swing of another intervention talk in the common room after dinner. Not that she hadn't already tried multiple times that day during lunch and in their breaks.
"Thank you, Harry dear, you're always so helpful," Molly said, waving a bowl of potatoes into the sink with her wand.
Harry blushed, but snapped back at him, "Well if we can whip up a time-turner, we shouldn't have to go
"Er, yeah, that'd be great." He hadn't expected it to be quite so easy. It wasn't guaranteed yet, though. "There's one thing, erm — there's not really a good way to say this, but I've sort of been disguising my appearance."
If there was any chance of fooling Hermione, they really had to be convincing. Or, that was Harry's rationale for this anyway.
"Hm. Okay," Rodya said again, and reached over to pat his hand. "Bring him over for dinner some time, yes? I would like to meet him properly."
good." Draco began to kiss over his jaw, down his throat. He twisted his fingers in Harry's hair, pulling his head back, and Harry gave a breathy sigh, digging his fingers into Draco's thighs.
Draco yawned. "Guess so." He slid a hand over Harry's waist, just to sit there at the dip. It was nice to have the solid reminder that he really wasn't alone in all this.
"You want to do this here?" Draco asked when Harry tugged at his boxers. They were on the floor in the front room, and they'd managed to rid themselves of most of their clothes already.
Class with Slughorn had not been particularly pleasant for Harry for a number of reasons. Firstly, Professor Slughorn was still under the impression that Harry was a potions genius because he had done exceptionally well during Sixth Year due to using the old textbook of an
"I have decided to participate somewhat in the festivities today, perhaps against my better judgement. I am trusting that this group is mature enough to handle it — do
It was Draco's turn to snort. "Who knew you were such a flatterer and a flirt? No fucking wonder you were practically friends with the whole of Gryffindor."
"Yes, actually. A group of Third Years told me I make my class so interesting and fun that it doesn't even feel like work — not like other classes, they said. And you know, Potions is another class."
"No. I think I'm more grounded than ever right now. Maybe it's that rather than trying to follow along with a plan for my future, I've gotten to a place where I really enjoy my life in the present, and I just want to keep it like that forever."
"I'm not sure. I'm afraid to look at it again." Another chuckle had slipped past Harry's lips, and he had asked. "Why?"
"'S'okay. 'S nice," Harry murmured, eyes sliding shut again as Draco planted a few more kisses over his shoulder and the top of his arm.
"I'm going to fuck you right here like an animal. You don't deserve to lay down like a person. You don't deserve a bed," He panted before kissing Draco again, biting his lip and swiping his tongue over Draco's.
Part of his brain was quite tempted by her offer of spending time with just her in quiet. The other part continued to insist stubbornly that he didn't need or even want
And then Draco was on him, claiming his mouth for his own, and stealing his breath away. And honestly? Harry didn't much mind.
"Right, you're still being a massive prick. Got it. You know, me and Hermione just want to help you."
. Draco had a lot of beautiful tattoos on his skin, and they were undebatably art, so Harry hadn't expected such a bawdy little obviously-hand-done piece, of a racing broom with the words 'FREE TO RIDE' underneath.
"Perhaps there's a bit too much excitement going on," Harry said. "I think I'll take a page out of Percy's book and just read for a bit."
Draco sighed against the back of his neck, absentmindedly stroking his thumb over the warm skin of Harry's stomach. "Yeah, okay. You have to order and get the door though."
“No pressure, of course,” Molly hastily added, leaning past Harry to direct that last bit at Draco, Cho, and Luna.
, and now that we're out of school, we're meant to be, you know, taking things seriously. You can't marry a bloke, so..."
Yeah, Harry was definitely not liking this whole intervention-esque thing going on. He was just so very,
"I think I have two that would be useful for an overview. Any certain kind, or just dark creatures in general?"
Harry pressed down against Draco as he slid their tongues together, and he felt Draco wrap his legs around him, pulling him harder against him. Draco rolled his hips, and Harry scrabbled at Draco's shirt, pushing it up out of the way to trace his hands over the smooth skin.
"Oh yeah, like a month ago. I uh...didn't put my glamour up in time, and I kept expecting them to say something about it."
Well, he didn't actually want to spend hours on a stuffy train with no one he knew and a bunch of gawking children, but he was taken in by the idea of doing things just like old times. In the end, it was silly nostalgia come years too late. He Apparated from Grimmauld Place (which he had managed to clear out a bit more in the past year, although it was still admittedly rather forbidding) straight into Hogsmeade, and walked up the the castle.
Harry looked around and noticed all of the other boys were already gone. It must have already been somewhat late.
Harry could already feel a headache starting. He'd gone out 'shopping' without a glamour specifically so that reporters could ask questions about his 'relationship' with Draco, now that it had been confirmed for a couple of weeks, but it was still bloody exhausting.
Draco blushed. "Listen, I am not at my top performance right now — my brain is a bit addled, thanks to a certain
"Yeah, I don't plan on dying," he finally said softly, "but I'm still not staying locked in the fucking flat if I don't have an
Ron rolled his eyes. "I dunno mate, like I said before, he seems pretty into you. I really don't think you'll be ruining any holidays."
"Oh shush, you're a delight," he deadpanned, although he wasn't really joking. "And it wasn't that scary."
"Well, you're clear of anything I can find." She waved her wand again, dissipating the green ring, and tucked it into her robe pocket.
"Does it work like a broom?" Ron set it down and held his hand over it. "Up." The carpet didn't move.
Taking a deep breath, and tossing a large pinch of Floo powder into the flames, he stuck his head in and announced, "Granger-Weasley residence!"
The food and drink materialised in vast platters and pitchers, which never ceased to amaze Harry. It was strange to him how Hogwarts always seemed to feel like home — so familiar and comforting.
"That was a bit odd," Draco said, sliding into the booth that Hermione had vacated across from him. "Something I wasn't supposed to hear?"
"I meant— I was...asking..." Draco casually brought his arm up to rest his chin on his left hand, and drummed his fingers. The bartender's eyes quickly darted back and forth between the rings and Draco's face. "..the other one?" he finished questioningly.
Fine, it was likely important anyway, as he was pretty sure Minerva was the only one who even knew where this room was.
The Weasley's yard was usually safe enough, so they'd always allowed the children to wander about with minimal supervision. Therefore, whatever it was that put Teddy in such a state of shock was really worrying Harry.
and obliged to help. Dear Merlin, couldn't he have a nice, peaceful Sunday ever? He had nothing against animals, per say, but he knew this was going to come back to bite in in the arse. Or in his other hand.
They ate in silence after that. Harry's cheeks hurting from the force needed to prevent himself from smiling.
The paper was from that morning. Malfoy had disappeared six days ago. If he were in danger, maybe he wouldn't have enough supplies to survive. Or worse.
Harry analyzed the animal in front of him and had to bite the inside of his cheek to prevent himself from bursting into laughter. He bit so hard, in fact, that he tasted blood. But there was no way that a being so tiny and snobby had such a name. Coincidences were fascinating, indeed.
It was, as it turned out, a snake: Not an overly large one like Nagini had been; nor a scary looking one. It was very thin, though, and it's scales glowed in the sun— a pale shade of silver, almost white, with a few green ones. When it moved, Harry saw what was causing Teddy all such worry: the snake had, near it's tail, a gash in the shape of a half circle— which probably belonged to the teeth of some cruel animal— the Burrow no longer had any of those evil Gnomes, so Harry suspected some hungry mutt.
Inside the kitchen, where he usually kept his muggle cereal boxes organized by expiration date, there was a pile of cereal and a box slithering through the floor, stopping as it hit against a wall.
"Malfoy!" he called, as soon as he walked through the Floo at his place, and felt his heart beat faster at the realization of how familiar it all felt. Just like when he'd arrive and inform Dragon that he was home. Except this time it was a person. A person which he'd imagined naked enough times to know he had a problem. A person with whom he wouldn't mind sharing such intimacies.
"Quiet. Sleep. Warm. Mine," he got as a response, which made heat rise up from his neck to the tips of his ears.
That's how he found himself, a few minutes later, on his way home through the Floo, with a new pet in hand and Hermione's burrowed books, as well as some of the Weasleys' ideas of what he should name the snake: some names included Snape the Snake and variations of puns suggested by George.
He didn't want that to happen, but he didn't want to force Dragon to stay, either. Harry didn't even know whether or not the snake had a family or something like that, and he would hate himself if he were so selfish as to make his new friend feel bad for leaving.
His quiet sobs filled the room for a few minutes after that, until he was lulled to sleep with the feeling of the snake curled on itself on top of his chest and the belief that everything would, in fact, be okay.
She always looked on the logical side of things. Too bad Harry couldn't do that. He wanted to climb to his roof and yell at the world and yell at Draco sodding Malfoy and yell at everything that ever came between them.
It sounded like a challenge, especially when combined with the smirk gracing Draco's lips and his hooded eyes; If there was a thing Harry loved, it was a challenge.
"Everything alright?" Harry asked, fighting the urge to laugh. He was almost sure the snake wasn't poisonous, but risking being bitten was, for sure, not an option. He picked up the box and let the snake out, who looked scarily close to being glaring at Harry, even without human features.
Don't get him wrong, it doesn't mean he ever rooted for Voldemort or any of the other sick sons of bitches he fought against. It just meant that he had to put other people's needs before his own, from time to time.
As he was leaving, however, Ron walked him to the fireplace and whispered, in his ear, "If I don't receive a call or an owl from you in the next half an hour, I'll go there and hex his snobby arse off, don't care if I walk in on something similar to what you walked in on."
The spell led him to his own bedroom, which was peculiar, but weirder than that was the fact that it pointed him in the direction of the closet's closed door.
for breakfast?" he asked, sucking harder on a bruise he'd left the previous night. He wanted that mark to stay there forever. He wanted that mark to replace the ones that decorated Draco's body and haunted his dreams.
The next thing he was aware of he was drenched in a cold, uncomfortable sweat, and had the memory of past curses screaming into his ears, as well as a shadow of silver blond hair shouting and begging for help. Harry's eyes were blurrier than usual and he realized there were tears rushing down his face, as well as there was something sliding up his shirt.
Harry had probably never read anything faster in his life. His eyes swept so quickly over the page, he could feel his glasses almost crack. It basically explained that Narcissa Malfoy had gone to the Ministry asking for help after her son failed to show up at home after six days. None of his friends knew where he was and no one had seen him since the last time he'd left the manor. Supposedly, one of his house elves had been the last person to ever see him, saying he'd gone out to "catch some air". Narcissa also admitted, from what the article's sources informed, that there had been some grave argument between Draco and Lucius regarding personal information and that the Aurors said they'd see what they could do.
He tried to pinch a nipple to distract Draco, but was pushed back into the bed and a binding curse locked his wrists into the headboard. Draco placed each leg on either side of his, but kept from touching, choosing to lower his underwear instead, letting his cock spring free. Harry attempted to stretch his neck as far as it would go, getting so close to where he wanted his mouth the most.
"Why does the Weasel have to ruin the first good meal I've head in ages?" It comes out condescending, but Harry finds himself laughing at the fact that his snake took such
"In fact," he answered, but proceeded to eat anyhow. Now that he thought about it, Harry was not sure how long ago he had last eaten, so decided not to push the subject. Maybe he should ask Hermione what foods were appropriate. "Dragon."
"Hermione!" he called, placing the snake on top of the empty coffee table. He was sure she'd know what to do. 'Mione always did. She rushed in, asking what was wrong, then stopped as she saw Harry pointing towards the harmed creature. "I thought you could tell us what to do."
Once they stopped, he looked around, confused, seeing nothing that could cause a child harm in any way— he was, indeed, the master of getting into trouble and hurting himself shitless, so he'd probably notice if there were any threats nearby— until he saw Teddy pointing to something near their feet.
He licked the tip, closing his eyes to focus on the taste and bliss that coursed through him. Next, the whole length of the cock was pushed into his mouth, and he did his best to breathe and keep moving his tongue, easing the passage. He loved this part: when he felt as if he could give up all the control; when he could truly relax because someone else would take care of him, or show him what to do; when his mind could go blank and his body just sought more, more,
"Well," she finally looked up, "it's not an Ashwinder, and it's obviously not a Basilisk. I'd suspect a young Horned Serpent— although, no, wait a second. This is just an ordinary snake. An
However, as he was unable to find Dragon after calling for him multiple times, a feeling of dread and loneliness settled deep in his stomach.
Next to it there was an image of Draco walking around Diagon Ally by himself, head down and sleeves long, like he'd done ever since the war.
Even so, on his way home, he couldn't stop thinking about the possibility of being alone again. Bollocks. That was such a stupid thought. He had only known the snake for a week and was already so worked up about him leaving. This had to be some sort of side effect from the losses he had suffered during the war. He hoped. Merlin, he had been so content to have a regular someone on his life to communicate with that he hadn't even thought about the fact that no paper ever mentioned Malfoy's disappearance ever again.
Weeks later, after much convincing from Harry's part, they were both going to have lunch with Ron and Hermione for the first time since Draco turned human again. He'd explained to Harry the whole complication with his Animagus form and his need to escape from Lucius.
"He's missing," was all she said, handing him the Prophet. The front page- actually, the title- was all he needed to see to know what she was referring to.
Quickly, he cast a heating charm around the room so the temperature would rise while he fed the poor snake.
Once he finally got home— take out food from the fanciest place he knew in hand— he called for Dragon.
He opened it slowly, not knowing what was waiting inside. The lights were still turned off, so he cast a weak
The strangest thing happened when they crossed a little quill's shop: Narcissa Malfoy, who looked worn and exhausted, froze as she stared at him through the shop's window. At that precise moment Dragon chose to sneak lower into Harry's shirt and hide there throughout the remainder of their walk.
Making it a habit of keeping his promises, Harry went to find the snake, not sure how deep in shit he would be if the little thing got hurt again.
He tried to remember how such a thing could've possibly happened: a drunken one night stand? Not probable, his mouth didn't have the unpleasant taste of old firewhiskey; He was still dressed, so he hadn't slept with Malfoy; and he wasn't exactly a morning person to come up with more hypotheses.
So they sat down, ignored the moment that had just passed, and he told them all about waking up next to a naked Draco Malfoy, who had proceeded to steal his clothes and leave to meet his mother's house, without so much as an explanation.
As he stared at his two best friends, he couldn't tell which had the deepest blush, but he suspected it was himself.
He left Mrs Weasley's homemade food on the counter inside the kitchen and quickly cast a tracking charm. Maybe the bastard had hurt himself again or gotten stuck somewhere.
"Out with it," whispered Dragon, and Harry was grateful for his weight around him when she finally managed to rush the words out.
Harry scoffed and gently placed the poor creature on the table, warning his briefly before casting the quick healing charm and watching the scales cleaning themselves off the blood and fusing the scales together.
Harry left, shuddering with the renewed image of Ron's ass. Maybe Malfoy knew how to obliviate someone.
Dragon— Draco— had made it a habit of sleeping curled around Harry. They'd woken up in every possible position when he'd been a snake: wrapped around Harry's neck as if he were a scarf; Draco curled into a donut shape on top of Harry's face; even the multiple occasions he'd gotten stuck inside Harry's shirt holes and had needed help to find an exit.
