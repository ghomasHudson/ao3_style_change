” Potter mouthed, wincing as he gingerly held his arm out for Draco to mount up once more, and Draco spent a good thirty seconds
Potter was leaned over, hands on his knees to put himself at eye level with Draco, and behind his glasses, his eyes loomed large and did, at least, seem contrite. “…Are you hurt? If I try and touch you, will you scratch my eyes out?” Draco didn’t honestly know
a bit…odd, though. Unsettling in a way he hadn’t felt since those early days of annoying Potter. Perhaps, he thought, because he was spending so much of their time together now as himself, a human, and not an owl. Here he was once again, getting entirely too familiar with Potter, and now without the comfortable barrier of his Animagus form to shield him from Potter’s idle chatter, his
“And I’m not one,” Ron said, rising to his feet to return his own dirty dishes to the sink. He clapped Harry on the shoulder as he passed by. “Good luck finding a new Keeper.”
close to suggesting we’re friends, Potter, and I believe I’ve already made my feelings on such insinuations well known.”
“Well, Fred and George have hired on a couple of new hands, so if we want to grab lunch with the both of them this time, we can probably swing it.”
Still, he’d vainly hoped he might be able to complete his probation and graduate without issue, and then go on to find a job somewhere that wouldn’t ask too many questions about what he’d been up to for the past few years, where no one could bother him. He was handy with Charms, he’d learned, and he had a knack for repairing magical items (never mind where that experience had come from…). Surely there was a shop in Knockturn Alley that would be willing to take him on, even if they might not pay the best wages.
He had his knees drawn up, a long measure of parchment braced against them as he scribbled feverishly, and every thirty seconds or so, he would stop and nibble on the frayed end of his quill before evidently hitting upon some genius thought and going back at it.
And now, Draco recalled that Potter had at one point had his own owl. A lovely Snowy Owl that had swooped into the Great Hall bearing fantastic gifts he shouldn’t have been allowed. What had happened to it that Potter was resorting to using school owls or borrowing friends’ birds to deliver his post? Had it died, then? He certainly spoke of it as if it were a dearly departed loved one.
, he told his owl brain: this was just a plump, delicious little golden morsel—and he was a fierce hunter about to pounce upon it and carry it off for later enjoyment. The biting wind whipped around him, screaming in his sensitive ears, and he had to squint to keep his eyes from hurting.
He knew he was whining, could hear that defensive edge to his voice, and if Draco hit back with the same energy, then this evening was going to go to pot.
Harry drew back, just enough to glance down between them—and then back up, gaze locked with Draco’s. His grey eyes carried a hint of challenge, as if to say
He circled the grounds in a long, gauging loop, and after a moment’s consideration, he bypassed his bedroom balcony altogether and made for the bell tower where he’d spent much of his holiday thus far roosting, safely stowing away his satchel of contraband to dig through later at his leisure. He really ought to check in with Blaise before returning, he decided, just in case his mother had asked after him. Blaise would have covered for him, of this he was certain, but he wanted to be prepared in case she’d left any messages for him.
"Good afternoon, two under the name Potter," he says to the clerk, trying with moderate success to modulate his tone.  The young man behind the desk nods, smiles, makes all the appropriate noises, pretends with admirable aplomb that he has seen nothing.  His name is Fouad, Draco is informed by his jaunty nameplate.
They rest for a bit, even nap, lying side by side in a bed in their clothes and stocking feet, separated by mere inches, separated by miles and lifetimes of the earth.  When they rouse themselves after a few hours of sleep, Harry's hip is clearly agonizing but "fine" he says, "fine, fine" as though it were merely a stubbed toe and not something so painful it is making him wince to move.  Draco watches as he takes his hair down from the tight braid he travels in, tying it back more naturally, and wonders why this is always his lot.  Always now he watches and waits, he almost says, he almost does, but in the end all he can offer to these moments of pain and curdled misery is a helpless gaze.  He hasn't even asked anything, but still "fine" Harry insists, biting off the word as though it itself were the problem.  His fingers are clenched so tightly on his cane Draco doesn't see how they can squeeze so tightly for so long, knuckles glowing white on the spell-reinforced ebony handle.  They pick their way down the hall, Draco fearing the whole while that they will get lost again, but discover another tiny, bitter irony; there is an elevator only a few doors down the opposite direction from which they arrived.  Sighing, sharing a glance that expressed their common opinion of this, they get in.  Is this all we can agree on now, Draco wonders idly, meeting those green eyes disgust for disgust at the thought of their previous rambling progress through the halls.  Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy's example to the contrary, Draco is forced to acknowledge that shared disdain for the world in general doesn't seem like a stable basis for a marriage.  The easy camaraderie and reliable support that was the basis for years seems gone, and Draco doesn't think scorn is a worthwhile substitute.
Harry quickly finished his breakfast and tugged Draco’s hand so the boy will stand up. Ron and Hermione followed him and started to say their goodbyes to Neville and the rest of their friends.
“Draco, don’t worry I’m sure that Rosmerta will be nice to us.” He tried to make his voice as steady as possible.
“Seeker was never my position. My father wanted me to beat you so he made me the seeker, but I was always better at chaser.” This made Harry do a double-take, but when he imagined Draco lean body holding the Quaffle and scoring a goal.
Instead of answering Harry laid Draco on the bed and before the blond could sit he laid next to him. “Harry?”
He wanted to run, to die, but then his father came back and he was even worse, he began to torture Draco thus he usually couldn’t even move. His mother sometimes healed him and because he stupidly believed that maybe she changed and she would help him, he agreed to join them and save her. This was his goal, save Narcissa and survive.
Draco’s voice startled him and made him focus on the present. “Are you ever going to pack or do you expect me to do it?”
He looked towards Harry and noticed that the boy looked like he was about to say something. Suddenly he closed his mouth and turned Draco around. McGonagall stood at the entrance to the train station. He looked at her and he couldn't stop the fear that appeared.
And so Hogwarts became his only escape from his family up to the fifth year when Voldemort was back and while his father became even crueler, his mother even more distant. Both of them started to snap at him without reason, then his father started to talk about Draco taking the Dark Mark and of being Voldemort’s follower. He didn’t want to do this and managed to hold until 6
“Maybe you should stick to hugs Neville.” Harry’s voice was almost venomous. Draco watched as Neville’s eyes travelled to the hands that held him in place.
The images of Draco tossing and turning in his bed flooded Harry’s head and the urge to shake the Slytherin came back. He watches as Draco nodded and knocked two times on the Door. For a moment nothing happened, then they heard movement and McGonagall appeared in front of them.
I love and support you all. I want you to know that every single one of you is important. Keep fighting, what you all are doing by not surrounding is huge and very single one of you is making history and fighting for a better future.
When the day finally arrived Draco couldn’t stop shaking and he had no idea what to wear. His nervousness had to be more visible because after breakfast Andromeda waltzed into his room took one look at him, walked over to his wardrobe and picked out an outfit for him.
Harry moved down and lowered Draco's underwear with his teeth, exposing his erection. He watched as Harry smiled and started to suck him off. The sensation was almost too much, but Harry knew exactly what he needed and soon Draco felt as Harry slowed the pace at which he moved over the length of Draco's cock. Draco wanted to move, but the Gryffindor still had him pinned to the bed. Suddenly the raven-haired man speeded up and Draco had too much.
The two of them followed her, he stayed close to Draco so that if one of the patrons tries to harm him in any way he would be able to stop them.
Harry looked at Malfoy and saw that he was already looking back, a silent question in his eyes. Harry realised that Malfoy was asking him for permission. Permission for friendship, he thought about what would happen if he realised what was happening to the boy in front of him. At this moment he knew what he needs to do.
Once again he got lost in his thoughts, this time Andromeda brought him back to reality. “Draco, dear could you help me with Teddy?” When he looked up Andromeda was standing above him holding Teddy by his armpits, his cousin’s legs were swinging from one side to the other reminding Draco of the old clock from the Manor. Without saying anything he took Teddy and sat him on his lap. “Thank you.” He watched as his aunt moved to the kitchen and started on the dinner. “What’s on your mind?”
When he regained some composure Harry was lying next to him, a dreamy smile on his face. “Your turn.” Draco's voice was hoarse from the moaning but didn’t mind.
I know that this is tagged as 8th-year fic and don't worry it will be In like 6 more chapters I think. Sorry that it takes them so long to go to school.
“But we didn’t even wait for it to turn green. If this is an indicator of safety shouldn’t we wait for a green light?”
“Come on, I’m sure Andy made food we can come back here and check out all the books after we ate.” Harry wanted to respond but the blond in front of him was still smiling and he was sure that the only thing that he will manage to voice would be ‘You are beautiful’. Instead, he simply nodded and hoped that Draco didn’t notice the blush that surely appeared on his face.
“Mr Black, Mr Potter how may I help you?” Her voice was smooth and Harry wondered how she looked so imperishable.
That being said he would not give the bullies the satisfaction of seeing them apart. Every time the two of them were together he would press himself against Draco to let everyone know that their relationship was not going to disappear and they are also not going to hide it. Today was no different they went to the library after the DADA lesson and this time he decided to actually study and not just glare at people that stared at them.
“Mate, listen I might not be your friend till 5 minutes ago, but you really should stop thinking like this. I get that you never had someone tell you that you deserve better, but you do and now you are part of the team and this means that we have your back. You are in a shitty place and I understand why, but we will help.” At this moment Harry could kiss Ron, he didn’t but the temptation was there.
“I think we better sit down for that tea” with that she walked to the stairs knowing that Harry was right behind her.
“Mine not.” The words were barely audible and for a moment Harry thought that he was the only one that heard it.
-year table stood just below the staff table. When Harry got closer he noticed that there was a place left in the middle of the table, just below the headmistress chair. He saw people beckoning him to this place, but he knew that this will never be his place. Still holding Draco’s hand, he caught up with Ron and Hermione and led them as far away as he could get from the waving people.
“I’m sorry. I should have done that. This was stupid, I don’t even know if you like men or me. I’m sorry.” Harry could feel tears appearing in his eyes. “Shit I will go.” His vision was blurry and the only sound he could hear was the beating of his heart.
“I’m done. You know I quit. It took a war and then almost going to prison, but I’m done.” He felt the tears mixing with blood.
“Sit down, Doyle. This is a pub not a place for public execution and if any of you have different idea them you all can leave.” Every eye was turned towards Rosmerta, the woman stood tall behind the bar her eyes were focused on the man that threatened Draco. When nothing else happened she turned to them. “Now Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy what can I do for you?”
Also, I will be glad if you let me know what you think about this chapter because I don't know if I like it or if I hate it
Draco sighed and turned to their youngest child. “Sam, do you wanna go look for frogs while your sibling waits for the potion?” Draco watched as his face lit up. The boy quickly made his way to Draco and took his hand.
When he was close enough to see their expressions the Slytherin only smiled, took Harry’s hand and started to guide the three of them towards the doors of the castle. As soon as they found themselves outside, Harry opened his mouth to ask Draco about the exam, but Ron beat him to it.
Polish LGBTQIA+ community, I see you, I support you and I believe in you. You all are strong and can change it, it will be hard but nothing is impossible. You all are fearless and amazing, so don't let an asshole convince you otherwise!
Suddenly he felt a pair of arms around his torso. He wanted to run away, but the similar smell of Harry’s shampoo made him look around. McGonagall was standing back to them probably looking for a calming draught. The chair that he was sitting on now laid on the floor. But the most important change was that Harry was hugging him.
“We should get ready if we want to be ready for breakfast.” Draco knew that they needed to wake up, but the perspective of leaving Harry's embrace was the last thing that he wanted to do.
He knew that no matter what happens Harry will be with him. Harry and his newfound friends. A small smile appeared on his face when he could feel the now similar weight of Harry’s hand in his. When he looked back at McGonagall he could swear that the witch was smiling as well.
This seemed to snap Harry out of the spell he was under. The boy looked back at Draco and gave him one the small smiles that he loved so much. “I’m sorry, I’m fine. Thinking.”
Harry led him outside towards a table with two chairs and a colourful umbrella. The day was extremely warm and Draco was thankful for the umbrella. He sat down in a chair that faced the street, he wanted to watch the muggles going about their business. He figured that finding an apartment in muggle London will be much easier than finding something in the wizarding world, so this was actually a practice for him.
Slowly they made their way toward the greenhouse, they were silent for a long time when Harry finally asked the question that Draco could guess was killing him. “So, what did she want?”
Rosmerta rose her hand to silence Draco. “I do not want to hear the pureblood Malfoy, what I want to hear is Draco.” For a moment Draco just looked at her, his right hand was holding his left forearm and by the way that his sleeve was looking Harry could see that the hold was tight.
After what seemed like forever to Harry, Malfoy’s voice finally made an appearance. “I think that this time my father will refrain from any kind of threats.” He spoke slowly as if the word pained him. “If you allow me to stay, I could use a spear bed. I think I’m not welcome back home.”
“I’m okay. I’m sorry that I scared you. I didn’t think it was so serious.” He paused. What else could he tell her?
Harry noticed that she was wearing black pyjama pants and red robe and although she wasn’t dressed she looked as if she was expecting them.
“Yes, she did.” He answered the question and turned to the door where Harry was standing. “May I know why were you hiding from your employer?”
Draco felt as if a great weigh disappeared from his chest. On the one hand, he felt relieved because he was going to be okay, but on the other hand, he had no idea what he will have to do. McGonagall said that the process will take time, he wondered how long till he will be able to feel asleep without the figure invading his dreams.
“Today I realized that I have no casual clothes that fit me and I was wondering if you would want to help me find something that actually looks good on me” Harry watched Draco’s face closely waiting for any kind change on it, but his face stayed blank. “I mean you don’t have to, I just thought that since you clearly have a good fashion sense you could help.”
With the corner of his eyes, he could see as Ron reached for his pillow and before Harry could do anything it landed on his face. He laughed and closed his eyes, this is going to be a good day.
The smiled on the blond’s face was wicked and Harry almost shivered. “Okay, Harry. You’re on, but remember no help from Hermione, Ron or any other Weasley. You are the brain and muscle of the operation.” Draco’s voice was cold and determined, somehow Harry felt as if he played right into the Slytherin’s game.
Harry just looked as Draco rub his left forearm nervously, the movement was hypnotising and Harry couldn’t take his eyes away. “Okay, so you see during the war there was a period in which Vol- Voldemort lived in the Manor. Also during this period my aunt Bellatrix was teaching me occlumency.” Harry noticed that once again when Draco said teaching it sounded like something bad as if he meant the farthest thing from teaching. Still looking at his hand he saw that the rubbing was slowly turning into scratching. “And something happened to my dreams and I don’t know how to fix it.”
Harry knew that this is a big deal for Draco, it was his first time in a muggle gallery and Harry hoped that Draco is as excited as he is. Sure he was in a gallery once, when he was still going to muggle primary school and the Dursley’s didn’t have to pay for the visit. This time it wasn’t a national gallery, so Harry was pretty excited.
Draco got on his broom and started to hover over the building waiting for the boy to exit. After 20 minutes the raven-haired boy appeared, with one swift motion Draco dumped the bag full of feathers on Harry and hid on the roof of the building. He watched as Harry tried to unstick the feathers from himself, after 5 minutes the boy went back probably to shower. Draco smirked knowing that his problem won’t be solved by a simple shower. After making sure that no one was looking, he flew towards the Great Lake, landed and went back to the dorm where he left his broom and made his way to dinner.
Draco still couldn’t believe that he was free of the stiff atmosphere of the manor. For the first time in forever, he could actually enjoy himself during this time. He loved that the first thing that he saw when he exited the train was Andromeda and Teddy. It still surprised him that now he had people that genuinely liked him and wanted to spend time with him.
Back in her office, she saw as Harry was pacing from one corner to her other nervously glancing from her to Draco. When he noticed that she looked at him he stopped and walk over to Draco, who looked as if he was going to fall.
After coming back to the salon Harry noticed that Draco was no longer talking with Hermione, who now stood next to Ron and Molly. Quickly he scanned the room looking for the blond man. After a moment his eyes landed on a sofa that stood in front of the lit fireplace, Draco sat with Teddy in his eyes looking at him with a smile and Harry’s heart leapt from his chest. The blond looked so comfortable that Harry wanted to go to him and kiss him into oblivion.
“Who I date is none of your business and if I were you I would stop with the hate full comments because my patience is wearing thin. Now let us pass and fuck off.” Harry started to walk through the group and Draco followed him, a small smile on his face. Harry actually stood up for him, he knew that Harry liked him to the point of defending him, but knowing and actually seeing him do that made his heart hammer in his chest.
Suddenly Harry’s hands were on his arms and the boy in front of him was the only thing that felt real.
“It was just too much. The N.E.W.T.s and the classes and all the people. I thought I had it under control, but then I spilt my fucking quill and the tears came rushing in and you walked in and it was too late to stop them.” He took a deep breath to calm himself.
“Draco stop, you did nothing wrong. Your parents didn’t want to be saved, I know that this may not be enough for you but you are an amazing person and if they didn’t change for you then there’s no redemption for them.” He paused and look at the boy next to him. Draco was still shaking but wasn’t as bad as earlier, his right hand was still interlocked with Harry’s and this made him actually voice the little speech that built up in his head. “ I’m proud of you because you survived. You didn’t lay down and waited for your parents to kill you, you stood up and faced them. And I spoke with Luna, she told me that you always helped them as much as you could. Sometimes a warm blanket and a hot meal are all that one can do and you did it. You deserve forgiveness Draco. You deserve to live and I wanna live with you.”
Draco was furious, finally, something good happened to him, Harry kissed him so he was sure that the feelings that he has are mutual, but then Harry ran and Draco was once again left alone.
Slowly the blond boy turned around and started to walk away. Harry could hear the woman shouting. He could make out something about how all Death Eaters deserve to die and how Harry was a traitor for being around one of them, but he didn’t care. All that mattered was Draco, who was slowly walking towards the exit from Diagon Alley.
Harry was silent for a moment then looked at him and smiled. “I was thinking about taking you on a date to Hogsmeade.”
“Do you wanna go out or stay in?” Harry planned both they could either stay in and enjoy Harry's cooking or go out to the new restaurant that just opened near Grimmauld.
“I am aware that the youngest of your little trouble makers still didn’t grace the school with his unique way of chaos. I am also the person that creates the time tables, and I can organise your schedule in a way that won’t leave little Sam unattended. I will leave you to think about the proposition, take as long as you want, but do consider it.” She smiled at Draco once again.
The silence stretched for a few minutes and Draco began to think that Harry won’t answer, but then he answered. His voice was smaller than normal. “I do.” After the admission, there was another moment of silence and then Harry spoke once again. “I can use silencing charm if you don’t wanna deal with me.”
“Harry, I think you know what I wanted to talk with you about.” Ginny sounded confident, but Harry really didn’t know what they had to talk about the fact that they were never getting back together because of the feelings he had for Draco. “I wanted you to be the first to know that I’m finally confessed to Luna.” For a moment Harry was rendered speechless, since when Ginny fancied Luna?
“At least now everyone will know that we are serious and this relationship is not going away.” He smiled at the blond and moved to capture his lips once again.
“I’m exhausted and I don’t want to go upstairs. Can I please use you as a body pillow?” Harry must have misheard because there was no way that this was the actual question that Draco just asked him.
“I know, but no one is learning anything useful about potions, the N.E.W.T.s are approaching and Slughorne hates me, so you are the only person that can persuade the bastard to let us use the potion classroom so that we can learn something that would help all of us pass.” He knew that he let all his frustration and disdain creep into his voice, but at this point, he didn’t care.
“Oh my god. You’re right, I should have chosen a better colour.” For a moment Harry looked distressed which made Draco smile.
Harry feel asleep, he didn’t know when he vaguely remembers Draco wishing him goodnight, he remembers saying it back and then he was out. Somehow his dream wasn’t that bad or he just didn’t get to the bad part yet. He dreamed about camping, but it wasn’t the dream about running away from Voldemort, it was quite pleasant, sitting in the forest in front of a big campfire. He was about to tell Ron that he actually never saw a campfire this big when he heard erratic breathing coming from something in the forest. Harry woke up a second later wondering what woke him when he heard the breathing from his dream. Turning left he thought that he will come face to face with some kind of beast, not with trashing Draco.
Draco was slowly making his way down the stairs. He was dress in black long sleeves button-down shirt and black tight pants.
Harry wasn’t sure what it was with today. First, he lost his favourite pair of trousers, then some lady spilt her coffee on him, on his way to Andromeda someone almost run him over, Draco Malfoy of all people open Andromeda’s door and now Malfoy had some sort of attack in her bathroom. For him, this day couldn’t get any weirder or, so he thought.
Draco planned his revenge to happen during Transfiguration, thanks to the fact that Harry's wand is always on the desk at the beginning of the lesson, it became an easy target for Draco. After Harry turned to talk with Ron and Hermione he quickly changed Harry’s real wand to one of the rubber replicas, that could be found in every store. Noticing that Harry's quill was also on the table, he transfigured the ink into a shade that made it unreadable on the parchment. The last step of his revenge was making the quill easily breakable, but as he was about to tamper with the stationery McGonagall walked into the classroom. Her eyes were immediately drawn to his pink form and Draco felt his cheeks redden, the Headmistress smiled and continued on her way toward the centre of the classroom
“Harry, could you help me move him. There is something extremely wrong going on.” She heard as Harry came closer. He didn’t have his wand anymore.
“Draco can you please open, you are scaring me. You know I don’t want to hurt you. Open the door please.” He was done so done. Slowly he made his way to the door.
Slowly he rose from the floor “I said I quit. If you want to beat someone to death just kill each other” he knew that he should shut up, but he couldn’t stop himself. After finally saying what he wanted for so long he felt as if a veil was lifted, he was free. “Don’t expect me at dinner don’t expect o ever see me again. I truly hope you both rot in this house.” He turned around and felt as some spell hit him. He didn’t have time to wonder what kind of spell or curse was send his way. Quickly, he went to his room, took his packet bags and apparated away from the manor.
“Draco, it’s okay. I know that this is not going to be easy not for you, not for Ron, not for Hermione, but I really want you three to get along. I don’t care how long this takes okay.” Draco didn’t understand why Harry was so understanding, so good when he was a mess all the time. “Whenever you’re ready Draco. I want you to be comfortable. And I mean what I said I want us to be friends at Hogwarts.”
Carefully he watched Harry looking for any kind of reaction, for a moment there was nothing, but then a brilliant smile appeared on his face.
Draco thought that he will never see Potter again, but the boy who lived showed up at his trial and thanks to him Draco and the fact that Draco did all of this to save his family. He took the mark so they would survive, no one knew that the family he so desperately wanted to save never existed in the first place, but he didn’t want people to know. They could send him to Azkaban if the truth comes up, couldn't they? So he didn’t say anything about the torture, about the beatings, the punishments and he asked Andromeda to keep quiet.
Moving towards Andromeda he could feel Harry’s presence behind him, he reached for his hand so that no one would distract Harry from their path. Teddy looked bigger, he was dressed in dragon onesie and he was smiling at every person that passed them. Immediately he reached out and took his little cousin into his arms.
Once satisfied Potter would have fucked off back from whence he came, Draco sailed through one of the open windows of the Owlery, spiralling down until he landed gracefully on the dross littering the bottom of the tower. He awkwardly balanced on his free leg, using his beak to pick at the ribbon holding the parchment. He didn’t want to shift back and realise he’d trampled the parchment underfoot in the doing.
, Draco couldn’t help but be drawn to his own destruction, placing his heart in Harry’s hands when there was every danger of him crushing it.
“It’s fine,” he said, wiping his face and running his hands through his hair. He cast a last look at the abandoned teapot, then stormed off. “I’m going to use the Sanctuary—go on to bed.”
amazing, he marvelled, and decided to devote the bulk of the rest of his holiday to figuring out just how this all worked. Could he pop down to London at the weekends instead of pissing around Hogsmeade with the rest of the riff-raff? Even Apparition had its limitations, after all, and a fair share of risk for the inexperienced.
?” he snarled, voice raised to be heard over the drone of rising murmurs at the scene building. “Was I not
bargain, and with little else to do to occupy his own evenings, Draco found himself reluctantly agreeing to be the Chosen One’s taskmaster. Only until Draco got bored of it, mind you; he was committing to nothing, save a few nights a week with a front-row seat watching Potter demonstrate in living colour that he’d bested the Dark Lord by sheer luck only and certainly not by a superior grasp of magic. It was the sort of affirmation that made Draco feel a tiny bit better about himself.
Harry just wanted more time—he wanted to run away and live in the mountains, all alone, for a year, and
Potter patted his hair with a frown, opening his mouth to shoot something back, then seeming to think better of it. With a sigh, he relaxed back against the sofa, eyes closed and breathing slow and even. Perhaps he meant to take a nap of his own while his godson was out.
“Because I didn’t touch a drop of that Black swill. Aged Kneazle piss is still Kneazle piss. Besides—” His shirt hit the floor with a soft
He approached, carefully and cautiously, and scanned the branches above, a tiny little noise of defeat gurgling in his throat when he found the empty branches where the Hogwarts-owned owls usually roosted. His gaze then drifted, reluctant, to Draco, and he held before himself, clenched tight in his fists, a rolled up slip of parchment.
“If you think I’m the only one in this school who doesn’t like you, it would be my absolute pleasure to disabuse you of that notion.”
But three weeks meant N.E.W.T. results had now been forwarded to interested secondary parties following their delivery to students (
. Just because you weren’t in the thick of it, throwing about flashy spellwork, doesn’t mean you weren’t handling your own battles.” She shook her head shortly. “I would
Another nod, and Weasley then looped his arm through Granger’s and tugged her back toward the house. Once they were safely out of earshot, Potter turned on Draco with fury in his eyes. “Seriously?!
…might have been a better fit regardless.” This put Draco on his back foot, and he found his eyes searching Potter’s hairline, looking for signs of recent bruising or blunt-force trauma. Potter was
So he said, careful but insistent, as a parent to a child who might erupt into a tantrum at the slightest provocation, “…No, I don’t. You’re using me, and I’m using you. We’re convenient at the moment, and once term ends, I don’t expect our paths will cross again soon. So do away with silly thoughts of reforming me or making me one of your merry band of misfits.”
And he wasn’t joking; Draco was a grouchy beast if he didn’t get his requisite beauty sleep. “I’ll take care of it discreetly. No worries.”
Draco had gone scarlet and donned his best dress robes until Harry had assured him with tickled laughter that this wasn’t the Manor and that he had to dress much more casually, else he was going to make their hosts feel self-conscious.
Hermione seemed to be thinking much the same thing, and she nodded. “I Modified their memories before I left with Harry and Ron to hunt Horcruxes and sent them to Australia. Gave them a whole new life—one without me in it, just in case…” She took a breath. “But it’s over now, and they’re none too pleased to learn what I did. Even though I still believe it was the best choice I could have made—and I was a wanted witch! Death Eaters wouldn’t have hesitated to torture them to try and get to me!”
at the holidays. Swanning about the halls with Umbridge’s blessing, Inquisitorial Squad badge gleaming on his chest, now seemed like distant, fond memories of a rosier time. One to which he could never return, not without a Time-Turner.
was not enough to stifle the feeling that this just wasn’t the same as before…and it never would be again.
His mother waved a rolled-up parchment in one hand as she brightly click-clacked across the marble floors of the entryway to make her way into the den, where Draco presently lay sprawled across the sofa. “An Owl’s brought something for you, Darling. From the Ministry.”
Harry interrupts, eyes burning.  "The 'accident'.  I fucking hate that term.  There was nothing accidental about it.  Graham Tullstone melted my fucking leg with
"Together," Harry murmurs with a catch in his breath.  With a murmured spell, the light goes out, and Draco thinks he can almost hear the voice of his younger self, repeating
Draco stumbles out of the international Portkey lobby into a wall of heat and noise, Harry trailing behind him.  "Dear blessed Merlin," Draco whimpers softly, dabbing at his brow with a grey silk handkerchief and pretending to ignore the eyeroll and sigh from his companion.  Cairo is utterly overwhelming.  People are swarming like ants in all directions, and the shouts and horns and tinny, wailing music are enough to make him wish they were back in England.  A change in the air brings an overwhelming stench of something rotten, and he gags briefly before the stench vanishes in the swirling dust.
?" he whispers angrily.  "What do you think I..."  Quick as a blink the disgust is gone, the anger is gone, and the bland public face is back, empty and mocking.  "If you want to go, I suppose we can."  Draco is horrified at himself.  Bad enough to suggest a temple, but he knows better than to bring up the subject of Harry's Parselmouth talent; even mentioning the skill in the abstract has been enough to set Harry off for years, ever since an attempt by Dark wizards to proclaim Harry (of all people) the new Dark Lord just because he had the gift of speaking to serpents.  Why would he even think of such a thing?
"Together," Harry finally says in a voice like a breath, the tiny soft flower petal voice that Draco hasn't heard for a decade at least, the voice that first confessed love on a moonlit bench, the voice that sometimes told secrets in the middle of the night, secrets so large that they could not fit into the room otherwise.  Harry swallows, gives a tiny defiant lift of his chin, echo of a long-ago boy who snatched an improbable triumph from nowhere.  "It's been a long time since we did something... together."  Draco couldn't help but laugh helplessly at how silly Harry's statement is, looking around himself at the hotel room in a far-flung corner of the world from their usual places, but... even so.  Harry is still right, he has to admit.  We weren't really here together before this discussion; we were alone in the same room.
They get to the room finally, after getting wildly, extravagantly lost in the endless shifting corridors.  Once, Draco can't help but think, this would have been funny.  They would have been laughing, joking, practically chasing each other through these just-alike halls past the identical doors stretching off in all directions.   Now they just shuffle along, not speaking, barely looking at each other, and Draco hates it, hates everything about it, cursing himself for leaving England and Harry for agreeing to this mad idea for some reason.  Even so, eventually they come to a door where the bracelet shines white for a moment, and at long last one of the serried ranks of closed doors actually swings open.  Finally, Draco thinks.  Harry looks a bit drawn now, limp a bit more pronounced, crows feet around his eyes a bit deeper, but he's still got the half-smile he wears in public places.  Draco hates that face as much as Harry once hated Draco's public face, cold and uncaring, a young Lucius Malfoy peering out into the world.  Harry's face isn't cold; it's warm, but it shows the warmth of a comforting lie instead of true warmth.  Draco looks down, tired beyond reason of that face.
"Perhaps."  He sips his tea, fighting to keep his thoughts in order.  His mind is flying in all directions at once, but he forces himself to focus, speak.  "No, I don't want a divorce, Harry.  I never have.  But I don't want to keep going on like this, either."  He pauses, makes a short gesture with one hand that encompasses the two of them, the room, their lives in one brusque motion.  "I thought for a while that the accident..."
"I..." Draco pauses, frantic to continue this moment of actual communication, clutches at something he remembers from a long-ago history lesson.  "There's a temple to Uadjet, the royal cobra, quite nearby, in the ruins of Buto; legends say that she still lives deep below it, despite being thousands of years old.  I've heard that they give free entrance to Parselmouths.  Would you like to...?" he trails off at the glare from across the table, worrying that his undesired dessert might scorch from the expression on Harry's face.
"Wh... together?  You?" he asked.  "Why would you..."  Offense vanishes in a moment.  Green eyes blink, once, twice, looking confused and lost before cutting away, more open and present than Draco has seen in... far too long.  "I..."
sound that way," Draco huffs, disgusted.  "Nor should you feel it appropriate."  The hissing of the sand sculpture seems louder somehow in the silence, and he fights the urge to turn and look at it.  He recognizes it, this fear of being so close, an old adversary that has never quite released him.  "I asked you before, and it made you angry.  I'm asking again, and I'm sorry in advance, but... Harry.  Please.  Will you see a mind healer?"  He knows the answer before his husband's lips part.  The tension, the narrowed eyes, everything shouts
and a dark maroon fez, bows, waves his arm in an elaborate salaam.  "Potter?" he asks in a heavy accent. Harry steps up smiling and nodding, so much the picture of the British tourist that Draco's teeth ache.  There he goes, Draco thinks bitterly, Mr. Popular, attempting to charm the locals even when they aren't his locals at all.  The man waves an arm towards the car, the rear door pops open with a clunk.  "Please, please!"  Sighing, Draco climbs in, not sure what to expect.  Anything to escape the filthy street.  Surprisingly, the interior of the car is cool and pleasant.  A gentle breeze wafts constantly, smelling faintly of cloves and cinnamon, easy to pick out for a potions master.  A tiled, pillared court with a fountain sprawls unexpectedly before them.  Mirrors reflect the space, doubling themselves off into infinity and making the courtyard look almost infinitely larger. There are piled brightly-colored cushions to sit on (though how Potter is supposed to get up from the floor with his bad leg is anyone's guess), green plants, even a hookah which gets a suspicious glance from the both of them as they settled.  At least they agree on that.
"That's always meant trouble," Harry says in a voice that tries for light humor but ends up sounding flat and tired, stretched.  In spite of the off tone, Draco chuckles, trying to meet his husband halfway.
"I can't be who I was."  Harry's lips are drawn down, mouth a thin gash, eyes narrowed and cut to the side.  "I can't give you what I used to, Draco.  I'm broken.  I'm always going to
"I'm right here, Draco."  Another one of those bitter, choking laughs is thrown out to lie twitching in the floor.  "What's left of me, anyway."
"Do you?" he says before he can think about it, words hard edged and spiteful.  "You have a bloody odd way of showing it, then."  Now it is Harry's turn to look confused, losing that sorrowful look, brilliant green eyes blinking behind round glasses that have gone from being hated to loved and back so many times they have lost all meaning.
"No you don't," he says, humor masking a misery that seems to go into his very bones.  "You really don't."  His green eyes are clearer than Draco has seen them in what seems forever, but what is shown there is pain that threatens to bring back his tears.
Harry eyes the cushions uneasily, but seems determined to get down to them.  Gryffindors.  Really, Draco thinks, of all the ridiculous things.  He sees himself suddenly in a mirror hanging on one of the pillars, greying platinum hair drawn back in a severe plait, unattractive sneer on his narrow face.  He had thinned as he aged, and his pride at his slender body had become embarrassment at feeling too thin.  Suddenly self-conscious, he smoothes his expression to something approaching neutral, sees the frown lines engraved from concentration and disapproval still bracketing his mouth.  Harry shuffles around helplessly for a moment and  Draco waves his wand at a cushion pile, transforming it into a couch.  Most of a couch, anyway.  It irks him that his transfiguration is so sloppy.  One side of the couch looks a little odd and patchy, cushion colors making a strange swirling pattern but Harry sinks into it with a sigh, eyes cutting across at Draco almost suspiciously.  "Thanks."  A surly mumble, as though this is some sort of nefarious plot to deprive him of the joy of being trapped on the floor.  Draco presses his fingers into his eyes, wishing for the hundredth time that he hadn't listened to his ridiculous friend with her ridiculous ideas.
Harry chuckles, and Draco thinks it may be the most bitter sound he's ever heard come from his husband.  "Isn't this where you tell me you want a divorce?"  Sound stops, other than the rattling of the cup in the saucer in Draco's hand; even the hissing from the kinetic sand sculpture seems muted.  Actually, maybe I
"That wasn't my intention.  Quite the opposite, in fact," Draco says through a mouth that is suddenly drier than the sand in the corner sculpture.  "Although if you want one, I suppose I can't stop you.  I'm clearly not what you... what..." Tears are pouring down his cheeks again now, quite beyond his control.  The only reason he's able to function at all is how shocked Harry seems.
"I miss together," he whispered back, cursing himself for hoping.  Harry shifts again, stretching his leg, but Draco slides away and then leans over, keeps leaning, too far, ending with his head resting pillowed on Harry's good thigh.  A tentative hand comes up, strokes the greying silvery hair and loosens it from the tie Draco bound it with before dinner.  This used to be a familiar thing, resting like this; the ache of the memory is so strong Draco feels it as an almost physical pain, but still he treasures the thin, restless fingers toying with strands of his hair more than gold or jewels.  "I miss together more than anything."
"But you aren't."  Draco sips his tea to have something to do with his hands.  "Your body is here, perhaps, but Harry isn't.  My Harry.  I don't know where he is."  Long, graceful fingers rise, fall.  "I feel like all you do is push me away."  He stands suddenly, holds out his hand, a half-formed idea leading him somewhere.  Harry looks up, surprised, takes his hand without comment.  It's not a lot, but it's a start.  Draco helps him stand, leads him to the couch which is surprisingly comfortable given the torturous chairs.  They sit, side by side, staring awkwardly at the carpet until finally Draco chuckles.  Even a tiny laugh is still a laugh.  "This is preposterous.  Look at me," he says, voice stronger, and Harry looks up questioningly, catches his eye, waits.  "I've... I've been thinking."
"Nevermind," Draco huffs.  Religion has always been a sticking point for Harry throughout their relationship, even long ago when they were practically glued together at the hip.  He had never appreciated or understood the Malfoy family's devotion to the old gods, or any gods really, having only experienced the Dursley's occasional perfunctory attempts at C-of-E observance to provide what little childhood religious exposure he might have had.  Far from offering a counterpoint, Hogwarts had been rendered more irreligious than a government agency under Dumbledore, despite the centuries-old shrines on the grounds.  Even had the Headmaster not been so opposed, Draco had always been aware that the cults of the old gods were considered reserved to the pureblooded.  A Muggleborn who had the temerity to appear at an offering for Hermes, Helios Apollo or Artemis would be considered the worst sort of social climber, and the consequences could have been even more dire if one dared try to attend a rite for Erebos, Nyx, or Hekate, the patrons not only of Slytherin house but also many of the oldest of the pureblooded families.  Harry as a half-blood and a Potter would have been permitted, but he was hardly encouraged or sought out by the hierophants.  Draco's faith was thus a shock to the firmly atheist Harry in the early days of their partnership and ever since had been the subject of at best bafflement and at worst disdain.
"I do too, my golden prince," Harry says in that same tiny voice, and the long-absent pet name is enough to break Draco completely.  He turns over, presses his treacherously leaking eyes into Harry's trouser-clad leg, fists his fingers in Harry's shirt, surrounded by the smell of comfort.  After a bit Harry has to shift him, ease his good leg, shift his bad one.  Draco takes the opportunity to stand.  A wave of his wand transforms his trunk into a traveling wardrobe and he changes, tucking up his hair and putting on the faded striped shirt of Harry's that he has slept in for years.  Harry catches him watching as he changes, raises an eyebrow with a challenge that was clearly called back from a younger self but with a rueful slant to his mouth.  "It's been a long day," he murmurs, and Draco hears what is actually being said.
"Sorry," Harry says quickly, tiny tells and inflections gleaned over the decades telling Draco that sorry is the last thing he is.  "Go on, you were saying?"
"Draco..." a soft whisper, breath stirring in his hair.  "I hate seeing you like this too.  I... I just..." Harry breaks off, shifts in his seat, some invisible pain inside his leg forcing him to move to let the knotted muscles ease themselves.  There is something new in his voice, something Draco hasn't heard for longer than he likes to contemplate.  He lies quietly for a moment, savoring being in Harry's arms where he hasn't been, feeling Harry's body which has almost become a stranger to him in its odd new shapes and its unfamiliar boniness, his familiar scent which is still after all these years like a benediction, a marker of safety.  Even so, even with this focus on the moment, he almost misses the shift, the changing that marks a decision.  "Were you..." comes the soft murmur, pauses, continues "you really didn't bring me here to break it off?"
"I... what?"  Harry pulls back, closing off again, and Draco can't stand it, can't stand to see him vanish again into half-smiling nothingness.  He makes an abortive attempt to leap up, then stops, settles, braces himself in the wretched uncomfortable chair.  I can do this, he thinks.  I have to do this.
Draco inhales, exhales, letting the moment sit and just be for a second before answering.  He finally leans back, setting a tiny amount of space between them but keeping Harry's hand in his own, almost a challenge.  "No," he finally says, sounding shockingly together to himself considering how he was just crying.  He fights to keep his bitterness out of his words and almost succeeds.  "I never wanted you to go.  No matter how bad it was, I wanted the situation to change, but I never wanted to be... without you."  They sit for a moment, lost in thought.  Draco is surprised to hear himself keep talking.  "I know how miserable you are."  Harry snorts at that, chuckles, and it's almost his old laugh.
It was only as they were preparing to make their way to the till that Weasley, helpful little cherub that he was, urged Potter to head over to the ‘banding station’, which didn’t sound at

“I don’t give a fig how the damn thing sees it. At any rate, I’ll be ready the next time it tries something.” He’d only been taken by surprise this time, that was all. If Granger’s cat wanted to try and maul him again…well, she’d need to find a new pet for next term.
When Potter turned, reluctantly, to focus on fixing his little scroll to the owl’s leg in earnest, Draco hopped down to the branch just above the one atop which the little Scops was perched, placing himself nearly at eye level with Potter. Catching movement out of the corner of his eye, Potter looked up, locked eyes with Draco, and then gave a startled stumble backwards onto his arse when Draco fluffed himself up in a threat display with a raspily hissed
“And what am I supposed to have meddled in? There’s rather a lot of places I’m neither wanted nor needed, so a bit of specificity would be appreciated.”
wanted there to be.” He reached for the mug, wrapping his chilled fingers around it and inhaling the aroma. It wasn’t the good stuff, but it was tea, and that was enough. “But we aren’t going to be driven from our home.”
as the matter was brought to my attention, and then they can contact me at their leisure. It’s their own incompetence that let me slip through the cracks in the first place; you’d think they’d have a big fat file with my name on it, given what sort of havoc I wrought with my first transformation.”
something. He ran a hand through his hair (a mess as usual, no helping it) and moved to relieve Draco of his boredom—
“What are you doing after school?” he asked, apropos of nothing, and Blaise choked on his scalding tea.
No sooner had his talons closed around the feverishly vibrating Snitch than he was off again, wings flapping furiously, not for height now but for sheer break-neck speed, because from the sound of it, Potter had seen the stunt and was in hot pursuit.
But when he doffed his human form and slipped into his owl shape, suddenly everything at once became both less complicated and more.
His mother gave a weak, uncertain nod of acknowledgement, and Draco wished, with all his heart, to melt right through the floor and perhaps reform in the dank cellars below where he could be alone with his thoughts. As that wasn’t liable to happen, though, he instead sank to his knees before the fireplace and placed one hand on Potter’s head (“Hey, what the f—”), giving a great shove. “Get—back—
Draco thrust his chin out, defiant. “Romantic closed up shop months ago; not even Hufflepuffs put it off this long.”

)—and then rushed forward. He swept Potter’s leg with his own, sending him onto his arse, then quickly followed him down onto the flagstones with a knee on Potter’s chest to hold him in place.
“The house-elves have proven themselves hopeless in bringing the gardens back to a seemly state after that nasty business last year. It’s clear I’ll have to take matters into my own wand if we’re to see colour on the grounds come spring.” She tilted her head at him, lifting a brow. “Now, to what do I owe the honour of you descending from your grand tower to grace me with your presence, Master Malfoy?”
Draco’s brows quirked up, and he smiled into the draw he took off his bottle. “Well, it’s mastered. So you can stop your harping.”
Potter blinked stupidly, mouth half-agape, and when Draco stopped speaking, the silence seemed to snap him back to his senses. He startled, shaking his head. “I…oh. That’s…” He scrubbed at the back of his head—his hair was getting longer and more unruly. It hadn’t been
He blinked up at her. Her cheeks were red now, flushed with emotion, and she leaned down to give him a short, sharp smacking kiss square in the centre of his forehead.
“Is she complaining about wanting to fuck me with her nonexistent cock yet? That’s usually the sign she’s done for the evening.” Draco Levitated Pansy off of Harry despite her squirming protests and shooed her towards the stairs. “She’s been working on a topically applied Polyjuice ointment since Third Year, you know. One of these days she’ll manage it, and then none of our arses will be safe.”
Fantastic; the conversation was to continue. Draco let his eyes drift up to the rafters. He’d made his apology and was, to his mind, no longer obligated to stick around. The judging stares of the other owls seemed far more bearable than a heart-to-heart with Potter. Especially when Draco was in a form where he might be expected to participate in the baring of souls that Gryffindors surely expected.
Potter followed Draco’s gaze and smiled up at the portrait with a sad sort of fondness. “Tonks said they’d always meant to replace it with a magical one that moved but never got around to it. I think I like this one better anyway.”
Ron tossed the paper aside with a dramatic huff. “Yeah, all right. I guess I want old Ferret Face to be happy. He’s pretty insufferable when he isn’t, after all.” He gave Harry a crooked smile, though, to show he mostly spoke in jest. “You’ve spent too much of your life worrying about other people already. Just have some fun—make bad choices. Make some

try one after everything came out, just to see if maybe even humans might find them tasty, and…” He shook his head. “Haven’t been able to get the taste out of my mouth since. Definitely not one of my brighter ideas.”
“Waiting for me to run away?” Potter said, voice low and soft but with a tone that was nothing short of goading. Wanker. “I walked to my death willingly, you know. Gonna take a lot more than this to scare me off.”
With nothing better to do, Draco spent most of the morning perched upon the newly repaired dome of Gringotts, watching the crowd of last-minute shoppers milling below and feeling very glad he was not puttering about amongst the unwashed masses.
“Nothing,” Potter said quickly, eyes wide and voice high—then he scrubbed at his hair and sighed. “Listen, you were acting

No, Potter was too stupid to do something that underhanded. Draco tossed the band into the air, then whipped his wand out and hissed, “
“Well, just remind your father if he gives you any trouble that you’ve got connections at the Ministry now,” Hermione said with a firm nod. “That should bring Lucius to heel.”
“No, likely not,” Draco said with a sniffing indifference. “You’ll go off and continue playing the hero and saving the day—this time with the Ministry’s blessing—and I’ll be doing my level best not to piss off the wrong sorts through whatever means I can manage. If I see you again at all once we leave Hogwarts, I dare say it’ll probably be when you’re picking over my freshly murdered corpse looking for fingerprints.” He knocked back the last of his tea, setting down the mug on its coaster next to Potter’s. “Whatever any letter I leave behind might say, hear me now when I say I didn’t take my own life, and do avenge me if at all possible. As a token of our not-friendship.”
. He drew the cloak out of Draco’s reach, draping it over his shoulders—then seemed to consider something. “…Want to come under?”
Potter’s glare went cold now, and Draco shivered, feathers fluffing up. “He…takes some warming up. But hey, at least this way no one’ll mess with my post, yeah?”
“The Burrow”, as Draco (quite against his will) learned the Weasleys called their home, was as much a mess on the inside as it appeared on the outside. Cluttered and cramped quarters, the design left Draco with the unsettling feeling of being trapped inside living walls, though he supposed a certain sort might find it
Draco gave a small nod. “It went well enough, the usual business—and then at the end of the meeting, he told me an Auror wanted to speak to me.”
“Out wherever. It’s Christmas holidays—there’s lots of shopping to do, and I’ve got friends and family I’ve been wanting to go visit since…well, everything. I haven’t been sitting on my arse here, you know.”
Potter’s brows quirked as if they had a life of their own. “Weasleys’ Roasted Dragon Nuts.” Draco took a close look at the branding on the side of the bag, which clearly said
It was Pansy, it turned out. She paused in the doorway, and he could feel her eyes on him, trying to work out just what was going on. Then, carefully and warily, as if she thought he might have been Petrified and perhaps the Basilisk that had rendered him thus was still lurking about, she approached. Her feet whispered softly across the plush area rug, and then she was there, settling down beside him on the mattress. He rolled over a little as the bed sank.
Draco lashed out, snapping up the treat but leaving Potter’s fingers intact; the satisfaction would only be momentary, he reminded himself, and Potter would raise a stink about it. The last thing Draco wanted these days was attention; oh how far he’d fallen since First Year.

the past, and moving forward. Accepting what’s changed, because that’s part of life.” He looked up, fixing Harry with a pleading look that didn’t suit at all; he was meant to be proud and pompous and larger than life, not this lost little boy staring at Harry. “It’s just—difficult, is all. When
Bragge produced a file from nowhere and Summoned a quill from his office, clearing his throat. “All right, Mr. Malfoy—if you would be so kind as to demonstrate a transformation for us?” He seemed to catch himself, belatedly adding with only a hint of worry in his tone, “That won’t be an issue, will it? Dear me, I’d hate to have to ask Mr. Potter here to go diving back into—”
With precision he hadn’t felt the need to practise since shitting on Potter’s head, he angled for the Gryffindor tables, swooped low, and dropped his parchment (and the dead mouse Spellotaped to it) right on top of Harry Potter’s Eggs Benedict.
“Don’t be ridiculous. I told her I was staying with the Zabinis, obviously. Blaise will cover for me if she thinks to ask—he always has.”
!” Nothing. “Fuck it all, I’m running out of spells here!” He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Maybe I can find some bolt cutters…” Draco didn’t know what ‘bolt cutters’ were, nor did he wish to find out, clacking his beak at Potter in an effort to keep him on task. “I know! But that’s all the unlocking and unbinding spells I know. Do
Harry concurred, stars spangling his vision. His fingers dug into Draco’s hips, leaving little crescent marks. “A little—warning would’ve been—appreciated.”
Potter then began worming his way through the crowd to each display around the shop, quietly explaining what the different products did—though there were the occasional few items he wasn’t familiar with. “So, you know. Buyer beware and all that. Might make your chest hair turn purple. Might make your bits fall off.”
“What a truly beautiful creature…” Bragge marvelled, before he recalled himself with a humming chuckle. “That was splendid, Mr. Malfoy. Full marks—and you’ve even learned to shift while clothed! Tremendous.” He ticked off several boxes on the form. “Now, if you’ll—let’s see… Give us a turn-about?” He waved his finger in a circle. “Let’s get a look at you from all angles.”
“Mm, Ron doesn’t think he’s going to go back; he’s been helping Fred and George run the shop, since they say it’s easier on the mind—and wallet, I expect—to hire family than outside work. Things seem to be picking up now that most of the other shops in Diagon Alley are opening back up again. And Hermione’s going to intern at the Ministry, which I think will surprise pretty much no one.”
Preposterous; Draco had a name, and a very fine one that spoke highly of his pedigree. Perhaps it wasn’t going to open
“Oh,” Draco said, mind drifting back along the stream of Defence teachers that had passed through the hallowed Hogwarts halls over the years. “The werewolf.” This recollection cast young Tedward in a new light, though, and he fought to keep from physically recoiling. “…Is
McGonagall found her way to the table at length, having had her own share of hands to shake, to thank him in person. “It was such a lovely speech, Potter, truly. I don’t think…” She sighed. “Well, I knew I was right to ask you to share a few words. Though I know you weren’t keen on it.”
He rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his palms, groaning inwardly, then transformed back into his owl and hopped onto Potter’s arm, allowing himself to be toted inside and pretending very fiercely that this whole mess wasn’t humiliating. He didn’t even have the soothing balm of being able to blame Potter for this cock up, because the arsehole was
, he then quickly shuffled his way out the door, heading for the fourth-floor corridor and leaving the Owlery once again quiet and peaceful.
But then the Floo flashed brightly to announce an incoming visitor, and cursing softly under his breath, Draco popped back into his owl form and launched himself at Potter, scrambling up onto his shoulder as Andromeda Tonks,
As the hour approached noon, Draco swooped down from his post atop Gringotts to perch on the sign hanging just over the door outside of Eeylops. A few passersby gave him funny looks, but they quickly moved on about their business, clearly thinking him part of the shop’s merchandise. Potter was, at the moment, just exiting the newly reopened Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour (
He ducked his head. “Yeah, I figured it was about time I actually read it. Out of, y’know, respect for Professor Bagshot and all.”
Which brought Draco here, to the Owlery atop the West Tower of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
He took a long loop around the castle grounds, killing time until he felt confident he wouldn’t run into Potter on returning to the Owlery. It was the only place he felt comfortable transforming—no one spent more time there than absolutely necessary, and it wasn’t a place groups tended to congregate. His Animagus abilities were a matter of public record, of course, and anyone could file a request to see his profile, but Draco certainly wasn’t about to
; Kingsley’s temporary appointment to the Minister for Magic position had recently been made permanent, and he waved out at them from the front page.
Three days before Hogwarts classes were set to resume with the new term, the excitable little Scops showed up once more, dive-bombing Draco’s head while he helped his mother parcel out the choicest bits of garden real estate that hadn’t been ruined by boot tracks and werewolf piss so they might plant a few Angel’s Trumpet bulbs.
But instead, she only looked…quietly relieved, bringing her hands down to clasp before her. “Oh, that…that’s lovely, Dearest.”

throwing themselves into fights. Harry didn’t see the appeal at all; how could you really get on with someone when you spent half your time fighting?
Ron didn’t seem to agree, but he kept his mouth shut, perhaps fearing any further commentary would see him assigned by Hermione to read it as well.
Draco shrugged. “It was dull at the manor—no one comes to call anymore, not that I can blame them. Then that little Snidget of yours showed up, and I thought to see if I could follow it. Figured it might be a fun challenge.” He glanced around, taking in the sad, shabby state of the shed for the first time;
it was interacting with Potter when they both knew who and what the other was, was to simply avoid him altogether. This was a markedly easier task now they didn’t have any classes together, helped in spades by Draco being able to just turn into a bird and fly away whenever he wanted.
,” he urged, seeing Harry’s obvious agitation. He offered a wry smile, too fatherly for Harry’s taste. “But he’s kind of an unregistered Animagus, no?”
Potter’s roommates, as well, had begun complaining about open windows letting the chill in, so more often than not, Draco was turned away when he came calling, which was doing
happy about having magic worked on them against their will. I think I managed to restore all the changes I made, though they still call each other Wendell and Monica sometimes.”
with all manner of vermin, and though the very idea had disgusted him at the outset, Draco had become in the months since mastering his transformation a rather adept hunter, if he did say so himself, and he began to bring fresh kills to Potter’s window, just to see what he might do. A mouse here, a vole there, and even—just once—a little white stoat that reminded Draco uneasily of the weasel form he’d been shunted into back in Fourth Year for Moody the Misanthrope’s delight.
Wentsworth smoothly navigated the conversation back to discussion of Draco’s schoolwork and how his mother was doing, idle chit-chat, but Draco’s thoughts had already strayed down the winding, snaking halls that made up the bowels of Level 2, wondering what an
He rubbed a hand over his face, taking a deep breath. Blessedly, the faint stench of Mooncalf manure that permeated Greenhouse A was largely overpowered by the night-blooming moondew blossoms and a flower Draco didn’t recognise but which smelled strongly of honeysuckle and lavender. He made a mental note to poke around later and see what it was, because it smelled
“No you won’t,” Potter said, far too sure of himself for Draco’s liking. “Because you don’t actually believe the wizarding world is worthless or that there’s nothing left for you here. You know the easy way out is to just say ‘fuck it’ and leave it all behind the first chance you get—but you also know how that would make you look. And there’s little more you hate than being called a coward.” And Potter had him pegged true, for Draco could feel his face heating at the mere implication. “Besides, if you really wanted to get away, if you wanted to be left alone with your thoughts and have no one in your business anymore…” Potter spread his arms. “You wouldn’t be here talking to me. You’d have continued shitting in my hair from up in the rafters, and that would’ve been that.”
“And maybe”—Potter said, mollifying—“maybe that doesn’t necessarily mean you want to come and take down Dark wizards with me. But I think it

at the Snitch. Perhaps if he could get Potter outside, Draco could engage in faecal warfare. It was quite literally toilet humour and therefore low-brow, to be sure, but also a tried and true way to really piss Potter off.
Draco gave an easy shrug, fluffing his feathers with a shiver and getting comfortable on his new perch.
“Come in, come in,” Thomassen said when Draco dawdled too long at the threshold. His thick Scandinavian accent somehow settled Draco’s nerves a bit. Surely the powers that be wouldn’t have entrusted the chucking-another-Malfoy-into-Azkaban to a
Harry didn’t know what those were, but he suspected it was another slight against Harry’s ostensible libido—which was in fine working order, he wanted it made clear. “You know I’m a sap; I just wanted it to feel right, is all.”
Mutely, he passed over his wand hilt-first, and she accepted it with a frown—then a small gasp of recognition. “Oh! Oh, it’s your wand! But you said you’d lost it during the occupation! Wherever did it get off to?”
This morning, though, there’d been…an anomaly. Draco didn’t get packages—not from anyone but his mother, and she would’ve sent her own owl, not Xerxes. Really,
Ron arrowed for the back door, mumbling a reply that Harry didn’t catch but was probably something along the lines of
When he woke the next morning—without his cock poking into Draco’s arse, thankfully—there was warm sunlight streaming into the room, slanted at an angle that suggested to Harry it was rather late. He strained his ears, listening for sounds of life in the house below, but he heard nothing save for the soft snuffling almost-snores of Draco drowsing beside him.
And when he wasn’t napping away lecture hours or trying to get through meals as quickly and quietly as possible, he liked to come here, to the Owlery, where he could sit in calm, comfortable silence and have all the privacy he might like. The owls generally kept to themselves, only occasionally hissing or snapping at each other if one encroached on another’s roosting space, and given his sense of smell as an owl was virtually non-existent, the stench of droppings and old, mouldy feathers littering the floor didn’t bother him at all.
Harry buzzed Draco to get his attention, earning an irritated snort for his efforts, and then it was a thrilling game of chase, with Harry weaving through the stands and under bleachers whenever Draco got too close. There was one particularly close call when Draco ambushed him from perched atop the Ravenclaw stands, but luckily enough, the sun was in just the right position to throw Draco’s dark shadow against the ground, giving Harry enough warning to take a detour before he came shooting out from under the bleachers.
What if it escalated, once they returned? What more could he do to reassure Draco of his feelings and commitment—especially in those moments when he wasn’t actually there? He doubted they would share
know about the great white dragon that fought at the Battle of Hogwarts,” Mr. Weasley continued, “but formalities do not appear to have been one of the victims of the war.” He squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “No rush—I only thought to offer a reminder, in case it had slipped your mind.”
“Slughorn asked after you,” Ron said, folding the paper and placing it off to the side. “After you—y’know. When you left to—I mean.” Ron reached for his glass of pumpkin juice, beet-red. “He just sends his regards is all.”
, that must have been it,” Draco drawled, crossing his arms over his chest. “Clearly I only wanted to flirt with you.”
Potter’s shoulders relaxed a tick, though Draco kept him pinned with one eye—he liked fucking with Potter more than he liked these owl treats, and forced to choose between the treats and giving Potter another scar to go with the one he’d earned from the Dark Lord, he’d go for the latter every time.
Instead, it would just be himself, his mother, and this dank, dark manse that hadn’t been entirely reclaimed since the Dark Lord had used it as his personal estate those months ago. Never before had the manor felt so empty, so…unfamiliar. Halls he’d zipped through on toy brooms as a child were now tainted by memories of captured foes being dragged along, screeching and begging for mercy. The drawing room rug had been so stained with old, black blood they’d had to
With the new term and new year upon them, Draco decided it was time for one of those ‘resolutions’ he’d heard of. They’d seemed like silly, insipid things before, meant for frail, frightened sorts who lacked conviction in what they were doing, the path on which they found themselves. But he was coming around to the idea of them being a sort of self-proclamation. A way to say he was in charge of his own life, he dictated his own future, and bleak though it might seem just now, he would not roll over and die.
As he heard it, the returnees in the other Houses were all bunking together in much the same fashion as in previous years—but so few Slytherins had returned that Draco was blessed with a private room, which suited him just fine. It didn’t exactly have much of a view aside from a little porthole looking out into the depths of the Black Lake, but he was certainly not complaining, not after seven years sleeping between Crabbe and Goyle in the throes of puberty.
either wanted a reaction out of him or to encourage others to take their revenge on him, vigilante style. He wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of either being so easily accomplished. “Things have largely calmed down on campus. The Headmistress has made it clear she won’t tolerate any…well, extrajudicial
But these Slytherins certainly weren’t going to make it easy—and what was he waiting for, an engraved invitation by Owl? No; Salazar had prized those who were self-sufficient, who looked out for themselves. If Harry wanted to be brought into their chummy little enclave, he was going to have to be a Gryffindor about it and
Draco stared at him blankly, evidently rendered mute with shock at being so casually addressed by an utter stranger. He quickly recovered, though, and Harry saw his walls rise up, ready to take a beating if one was coming. “…I beg your pardon?”
“Stuff it,” Draco rasped, voice thick with sleep. “I know you only just woke up a moment before I did.”
This only encouraged it to scoot closer, and though Draco dwarfed it by several fold, clacking his beak in warning, it seemed unperturbed, fluffing its feathers importantly. Draco snapped at it, but it handily dodged, continuing to burble friendly chirps at him and making a real racket that was getting on Draco’s very last nerve.
of regulations dictating its application. But it was, in the end, only magic—and thus a tool that could undo you or elevate you, depending entirely on how you wielded it.
tumble to take in so fragile a form. “…Fine,” he said, then shook a finger in Potter’s face. “But this never happened.”
Well that wouldn’t do. He took another half-step back, angling away—he had enough scars on his chest from Potter as it was, no sense making things
“I mean Andromeda’s gonna wonder where he got the idea for the colour from, you knob.” He began bouncing Tedward on his knee again, scrubbing his hair. “Come on, Ted. Let’s go back to black, yeah? Or maybe we can try some other colours! Maybe Mum’s pink? Think you can manage that?”
Potter didn’t treat him like Draco Malfoy—he treated him like a reliable if ill-tempered owl who was discreet enough to deliver letters to individuals who might or might not be secret lovechildren. And he
considering it, even—he honestly didn’t think he had a preference, not really, but well, now was as good a time as any to mull the situation over, wasn’t it? He had a pretty good idea which one he’d be better at, as he imagined doing it with a bloke wasn’t all that different from doing it with a girl, but then again, he didn’t have any experience with girls either, so did it matter in the end? In fact, with the way things had gone in the past year, he knew more about getting a guy off than a girl, which he supposed he ought to find a little funny. And he did find it funny, but it also made him feel a little queasy with uncertainty.
Draco beamed at him with a sharp smile. “Well, I’m not your owl. So I really don’t give a fuck how you feel about it.”
—not field missions. Six months of your life, that’s all. Six months for you to brush up on self-defence and get a bit more time to decide what else you might want to
, at least in the circles Draco tended to travel. And sharing Draco’s company would certainly do Potter no favours either, though Draco was far less concerned with Potter’s social standing than his own.
Draco was never going to know peace at mealtimes again, he was starting to accept. It was just a fact of life. There were certain immutable truths to the world—peacocks were always going to shit on anything that stood still long enough, Borgin was never going to part with that lovely emerald jewel he kept in a glass case over the register in his shop no matter how many times Draco’s father asked after it, and breakfast in the Great Hall was always going to be a fraught affair if your name was Draco Malfoy.
Draco did so, very pleased to return to a form that would allow him to at least hold a wand. Being an owl was really fucking great most of the time, but there were just some things that you could only manage as a proper human.
“See? We’re having fun already. Aren’t you glad you came?” And then he was gone, and Draco was alone once more with just Pig and Errol and his thoughts.
She reached out and rubbed his shoulder. “Who says you ought to be angry? You’ve been through a lot this past year—so has he. So have all of us.” Her eyes went to Ron, then back to Harry. “We just want you to be happy, Harry. That’s really all there is to it. We’ll put up with rather a lot from you, in case you haven’t figured it out over the years. Plus—” She bobbed her head. “Well, we kind of like Draco, too.”
In the end, Potter had to bribe Eeylops to just remove the band without asking any questions by purchasing a variety-flavour barrel of treats, but that was his problem and not Draco’s. In fact, Draco had really no problems at the moment, with the silver band now sitting safe and unassuming in the palm of his hand.
“What’s your problem with my being an Auror, all of a sudden? You’ve spent the past six months helping me study for my N.E.W.T.s! Complaining all the while, sure, but helping despite yourself!”
Harry frowned at the quill. “…Are you sure this is entirely necessary, sir? Draco hasn’t had an incident in
Draco made a face, grinding an old pellet into dust beneath his loafer. “…No. I had my own owl deliver them.” And before Potter could accuse him of laziness, he continued, “I wasn’t going to work myself into an early grave flying all over the British Isles. Good gad, you were posting shit at least four times a week at one point there!” Never mind that Xerxes had never turned his beak up at a request to deliver Potter’s post. He was an
So he was grateful, beyond measure, that Draco hadn’t given up. Had waited, perhaps not patiently, until he’d been where he needed to be, and Harry had been where he’d needed to be, so that they could be just what they needed from each other, precisely when they needed it most.
They wove through the crowd, a Notice-Me-Not helping Harry avoid causing a ruckus, and shortly found themselves at the entrance to
“Well, yeah, but—you know what I mean.” The thought that their situation—their relationship—might in any way be a burden on Draco, chaining him down and limiting his choices, did not sit well with Harry at all.
“Yeah; it’s been a few weeks since I visited, and I’d like to see it again before it gets too crowded with last-minute shoppers stocking up before the school year starts. Plus I’ve got to go supply shopping.” He’d done away with most everything he’d owned back at the Dursleys’, thinking he’d never see Hogwarts again—at least not as a student.
Potter gave him a look of bemused indulgence. Draco didn’t like it one bit. “…Who would believe me? You spent the better part of five years here convincing everyone I was mad.”
than Draco was plodding down the stairs into the kitchen to put on a spot of tea, throwing back with feigned casualty, “So what did Weasley’s father want?”
“They can be house-trained,” George said, sidling over to join the conversation. “And their dung makes for great fertiliser.”
Potter invited trouble wherever he went, and so long as Draco continued consorting with him—regardless of his reasoning—he would invariably be swept up in that trouble. He’d let his guard down, thought perhaps he could have a bit of fun
I know the name of the guy who I’m hoping will be my boss one day.” He now gave Draco a funny look. “…How do
Draco lifted a brow as he filled the teapot. “He was warning you off me, then? Reminding you to sleep with one eye open?”
“Nothing,” Draco sighed, still smiling for whatever odd reason. “I’m just stupidly taken with you when you say that word. I can’t stand you on the best of days, and this helps matters none.”
“You definitely should have let Granger and me help,” Draco said, leaning close to his ear to be heard over the roaring applause.
“Insufferable?” Draco snickered, shimmying the jeans down Harry’s legs. “I’ve certainly called them worse. Lift up.”
he hadn’t been allowed to choose his form—he’d fucked up enough choices in his life, it was nice to be relieved of the responsibility for once. And trusting to fate had served him well in this instance.
of the Aurors. But that doesn’t mean you wouldn’t make a good one. Plus…” He weaved a bit in place, chewing on his lip. “…Ron’s kind of getting cold feet about joining. He thinks he might be better served staying on at the Wheezes shop and helping George. His family’s been through a lot, and for him to take on such a dangerous job…” Potter reached a hand up, rubbing at the back of his neck with a wince. “I mean, I can’t fault him at all. I don’t, even. But—I still think there’s good yet that
And he had a point, so Draco shrank down into his owl form and allowed himself to be scooped into Potter’s arm, talons at the ready in case Potter got handsy.
“One, they weren’t ‘dirty tricks’,” Harry said. “And two, you raced me when I was riding one of those rickety old rigs of Perkins’s. They’ve

Potter seemed pretty proud of himself, and Draco privately commended him on actually applying historical context to his line of logic. “Well, much as you may want to
protests, and he quickly found himself set gently down onto the window sill, with Potter prodding him to move from the makeshift falconer’s glove to the cold stone bricks.
to be invited?” Ron asked, scandalised, when Harry complained about it as he was putting the finishing touches on Draco’s birthday dinner and dessert.
. Thinking perhaps that the likes of Harry Potter might have seen far worse in his years than a dead mouse or two, Draco had gone so far as to hack up a pellet once, and this had

But people would continue to want to express their gratitude, look to him for ill-sought guidance, and there was little he could do about it. He didn’t want to be anyone’s paragon of virtue—look how far Dumbledore had fallen, after all, when people built him up to be more than he’d truly been in life, turning on him viciously at the first sign he’d not been all he was cracked up to be. He just wanted to be

Draco wrinkled his nose and drew his cloak tighter about himself; how he wasn’t dying under such a heavy garment in midsummer was beyond Harry, but maybe he always ran hot these days, considering.
“Should we try some out? It’s a bit of a pain, not knowing what to call you, honestly.” Well that was hardly Draco’s problem, and Potter calling him
of Apparition, leaving Blaise alone in the courtyard. He took a few moments to collect himself, then with a huff began marching back to the manor proper. Draco swooped down upon him and smoothly transformed to fall into step beside him—taking great care to ensure that his trousers covered the ghastly cuff on his left ankle.
“Bullshit,” Pansy spat, grabbing his wrist and jerking his arm away. She shifted until she was leaning over him, her pinched features filling his entire vision. “Everyone fought for what was important to them, back then. That’s all there is to it. We were all fighting.

Had Draco been an owl just now, his feathers would have been sticking out every which way as he puffed himself up in sheer bald offence. As it was, he could only sputter, “
It had only ever been a fantasy, though. He wouldn’t have been able to leave his mother there to fend for herself, defenceless and alone, without even Lucius to stand between her and the Dark Lord’s vengeful fury at Potter once more slipping his grasp.
Potter nodded. “His dad was one of my dad’s closest friends. And something of a father-figure to me, too. I thought it only right to return the favour.”

. Draco supposed he should have been relieved he was being targeted less by nasty sorts wanting to punish him for imagined (and not-so-imagined) offences and more by pranksters who derived pleasure from puerile taunts.
"What?"  Draco looks up, knowing he is blotchy and wet and destroyed, but what difference does it make at this point?  Harry has seen him looking worse.  "You know what, exactly?"
"What should we do tomorrow?" Draco asks as the first course is delivered, tiny delicate bites of lamb spiced with sumac and mint.  Harry shrugs irritably, peers at his food as though it is suspect, finally deigns to taste one of the fragrant morsels and grunts in surprise as though shocked to find it edible.  Fighting the almost painful urge to roll his eyes, Draco continues.  "The brochure said that they do day trips from here if you'd like to go see the pyramids, or bits of magical Alexandria.  There's also a trip to a glassware factory, if that appeals; the glass here has been famous for thousands of years."  Harry doesn't look up, merely spears another of the lamb chunks and eats it.  Draco feels almost as though he's talking to himself.  He wonders for a moment if anyone else can see Harry, or if a stranger passing by would simply see him sitting by himself, conversing with an empty chair.  "At some point on the trip, I'd like to visit the shrine of Hekate Soteira in Alexandria, as it's quite old, but of course that doesn't have to be..."
Draco sighs before he can catch himself, cutting his eyes at his dinner companion.  "Why must you always..." he starts, before Harry cuts him off.
"Well, we lived through that, I suppose," he says, passing without a look into the bathroom and closing the door with a click.  The brief moment of closeness is shattered, and Draco barely makes it to the hideously uncomfortable chair before the prickling behind his eyes becomes too strong to ignore.  It is probably just Harry trying to be flip, but even so it is that one tiny thing that is the bit of too much that cracks his heart.
He buries his face in his hands.  He doesn't mean to cry, not really; for this, though, there's nothing to be done, and Draco cries because there doesn't seem to be any other option.
"You aren't," he says, and this time he forces his voice to his will, roots out that hateful, shrewish tone he can't seem to help but use, trying to remember how he used to sound without having to struggle with it.  "You're shaking, Harry.  Sit.  I'll unpack, we can rest a bit before..."  Harry whirls around, eyes flashing, almost looking like he used to, almost angry, almost... almost.
"Whatever you want to do is fine," Harry says, seeming bored to even think of it.  "Any..." Harry pauses, swallows, looks up with a tiny trace of the defiance he used to wear so proudly.  "Anything without a lot of walking.  Obviously."  He glances back down as the plates change, some sort of elaborate swirling confection of cinnamon-dusted phyllo and ground walnuts and honey appearing when Draco has never been less in the mood to eat.
"Thank you," Draco says, over and over.  "Thank you, thank you."  Finally, even clearly-not-British Fouad realizes that 'thank you' in that tone means 'stop speaking' and does so.  Draco stumbles away to where Harry stands, looking oddly small and dejected, forlorn in the middle of the lobby, passes him a bracelet.  How have we come to this?, Draco wonders.  How did all this fire and light just turn to ashes?  "Come on, then," he says, leading his way to the lift.  Harry gives him a look he can't interpret, but nods, smiles as though nothing is wrong.  Together they walk to the lifts, alone.
"Alright then, Harry, tell me, why did I 'invite' you?"  As if he needed to invite his husband, as if they weren't just traveling together!  He snaps his fingers imperiously, odd looking house elf appearing in an instant.  The elf receives his request for tea and Arab coffee and returns almost immediately with a tray, bowing and scraping until dismissed.  Harry just stares at him, acting as though there is no elf present.  "Go on," Draco finally says, waving towards the tray.  "Have something and tell me what it is that you think you've figured out."  Shaking fingers lift the steeping pot and pour a cup of tea, taking refuge in the familiar ritual.  The tea is strong and black, even the smell revealing its harshness, acrid, pungent, far too strong, cutting across the warm sweetness of the incense.  Draco adds sugar, a splash of milk to cut the bitterness, sips.  Acceptable for now.  He turns, mustering up all the long-ago social training he's ever had not to speak again, forcing himself to wait.
, dinner is extravagant, far more so than anything Draco has seen for years.  The hotel's finest restaurant is called the Bejeweled Garden and it is preposterously opulent, with the awards and international dining stars displayed discreetly in the entryway.  Variegated marble and green porphyry pillars dot a space that looks like a Roman emperor's palace, and carpeted sections link elaborate mosaics either made in the Roman style or (Draco thinks) quite possibly actual Roman mosaics, here a display of sea creatures, there the gods at war with the Titans.  They are bowed to their table by fawning staff and they sit at a table for two that seems to be an island of starched white linen and fresh garden flowers, golden utensils sprawling in a vast plaza around each setting like something Draco would have seen at a banquet with his parents when he was a teen.  He knows instinctively that Harry detests this place; anything with even a hint of pretentiousness is guaranteed scorn from 'Puritan Potter', and this restaurant has exponentially more pretention than a mere hint.  Draco had given him that nickname when they were first dating, the memory bringing a frisson of shocked loss and longing so strong he is momentarily speechless, as though Harry were dead for years and sorely missed rather than stumping over to the frilly, overdone table and glaring at it with a look more appropriate to apprehending a small-time criminal than enjoying an overdone dining experience.  Seeing his husband throw himself disgustedly into his chair, Draco fights not to sigh and takes the other seat.
They make their way upstairs, pausing in the lobby so that Draco can arrange a spa visit with the ever-loquacious Fouad.  He worries suddenly that Fouad is flirting with him, emphasizes '
massage', and realizes too late with the sudden half-hidden curl of disdain on Fouad's lip that he was badly misreading the situation all along.  All his instincts are wrong lately, it seems.  They take the elevator, the right one this time, and make their way the few short steps to their room.  When they step inside, the hissing of the sand from the kinetic sculpture is loud in the silence as Harry sighs heavily.
"You should sound that way," Harry mutters.  "It reminds me how I look now.  How I'm probably acting.  I..." Draco waits impatiently for the end of the sentence, but it doesn't come.
"It's fine," Harry says, face as smooth and unreadable as the marble of the pillar beside their table.  "It doesn't matter."
"'S hot," Harry says faux-agreeably, the way he always sounds rather than let himself say what he actually thinks.  Draco hates it, opens his mouth but then closes it again.  What's the use?  Harry leans on his cane looking decades older than his actual age.  Draco watches him glance up and down the narrow street, presumably looking around for the magical cab that they had been promised.  Go to Egypt, Pansy had insisted, it's exactly what you need!  A romantic getaway, rekindle the spark, and so on and so forth.  Thus far, Draco reflects bitterly, this trip is about as romantic as day-old takeout.  Eyeing the suspiciously organic looking detritus around the base of one whitewashed wall, he revises his estimate.  Day old takeout from the rubbish tip, more like.  A noise draws his attention, horn shockingly close.
"Don't worry about it.  That's fine," Harry says blandly.  Once again Draco sees a flicker of that strange expression from the hallway before it vanishes under the mask.  Harry looks... sad, and cold, and empty, the unfamiliar expression seeming utterly unlike anything that should live on a face that was born to be smiling and joyful, not this closed, sour mockery of itself.  He stirs, seeming to make an effort.  "The spa sounds good.  Maybe a massage.  It might help with..." he motions at his leg, clearly unwilling to even mention it.
"Yes," Draco sighs, trying to bring a pleasant expression to his face, "that sounds like a plan, then.  I'll make the arrangements at the desk before we go back up.  We should remember the right elevator, now that we know."  The look of brief amusement from Harry is like a burst of warmth, and Draco gives the first genuine smile of the trip back.  A tiny hope still flickers in his heart.  Maybe this trip could work after all.
Several more courses come and pass slowly, Potter stabbing desultorily at the food as though it has personally insulted him, staring at each mouthful like... Merlin and Circe, Draco thinks, like a bitter old man.  For the first time in a long time, he looks at Harry, really looks, leaving all his preconceptions and their history and past and love and everything behind.  It's easier to do this in this strange setting, like nowhere they have been in ages... there is no Harry-shaped hole in this place to fit him into, so Draco looks and sees only what is there.  When he does he feels his heart lurch in his chest.  Mother of Night, he looks dreadful.  To Draco's shocked eyes, the grey threading through Harry's limp black curls stands out like a flag, the lines on Harry's face, the dark sunken circles beneath shadowed eyes, the bony, veined hands moving restlessly... whenever did he get so thin?  The way he sits is nothing like the Harry in Draco's mind and memory, splayed in his chair like a lazing leopard, sprawling out to take up space, waving, smiling, active and exuberant... this Harry hunches, drawn inwards like a surly raven, wounded leg sitting askew at an awkward angle, eyes aimed only at his plate.  This, Draco thinks miserably, this is what has been hiding behind that public face... but not hiding well.  Not from him.  He could have seen this at any time if only he had looked.  Harry looks up, puzzled, catches his eyes for a moment, and Draco forces himself to speak, break this awkward moment.  "What..." he says, throat unaccountably tight and dry, sips his wine and tries again, "what appeals to you, then?  Shall we stay here in the hotel, perhaps a trip to the spa?  Go out?  See the sights?  Sleep in?"  He arches a brow in the way he always did, saddened when instead of the easy smile his heart still half-expects he gets a look of indifference.
"No need to answer now," Draco says quickly, sounding rushed, frantic to preserve this tiny beachhead in a subject he had thought surrendered long ago.  "Think on it if you wish.  So wasn't dinner grand?"  He reminds himself of one of the Weasleys with that clumsy segue, curses as Harry grins ruefully at him, flicker-fast, another expression he has missed like a drowning man misses air.  The other man doesn't point it out though, just sits quietly, fingers twitching in Draco's hand as though remembering how to be held, how to hold.  Moments pass, then minutes, in a newly comfortable silence.
Something snapped inside him. He lurched forward and grabbed Malfoy’s tweed suit by the lapels, and pulled him close until they were a hair’s breadth apart. Malfoy’s eyes were wide but his mouth had curled into a devious smile, which Harry was definitely
He gulps and bends down to grip the top of Potter’s coat, shooting Blaise a glare as he pulls down the zipper. Lifting Potter’s head, Draco pushes the coat down and away from his broad, blissful shoulders. Upon removal of the jacket, Draco can barely tear his eyes away from the soaked grey jumper that clings deliciously to Potter’s muscular chest.
At the sound of her voice, Theo turned his head to find the source, eventually locking eyes with Draco. He ran his eyes up and down Draco’s body before letting them flit off to stare at the dance floor. He smiled wickedly, “The prodigal son returns!”
Weasley went back to cleaning and Draco investigated the contents of the wardrobe that had spilt onto the floor. He found a couple of small plastic bags in the pockets of some of the jeans. After taking samples to test back at the hospital, he put them back. He was quite sure the white powder was cocaine and the greenish leaves were marijuana, but he didn’t want to make assumptions without chemical analysis. He was also quite certain that none of the compounds that had shown up in Potter’s bloodwork were from either of those drugs.
Draco continued to lightly pat his leg with the gauze. “I see a lot of patients who come in with crazy injuries and stay conscious for most of the treatment, you know, if surgery isn’t required.” Draco sat back on his heels. “Enough of them were saying
Harry rolled his eyes. “Anyway...” He ignored Malfoy as he wiggled his eyebrows at him. “It’s time for our first caller.”
Draco splashes water at him, afraid he’ll look down and see his arousal. “What in Merlin’s name are you playing at?”
Draco forced himself to meet into his father’s grey eyes but couldn’t hold the stare for longer than a few torturous moments. That was all it took for his blood to boil and his gut to twist into knots of anger, anxiety, and admittedly, betrayal. Draco kept his focus on the white linen tablecloth and carefully set his wine glass down. He took a breath, grabbed his napkin and wiped his mouth, before slowly reaching for his cheque book beneath his robes.
“Sorry, mate,” Blaise said as he shuffled through a mountain-sized stack of paperwork. “It’s been a crazy day, what with the raid.”
Where other wizards possessed varying levels of magical components, usually higher in one particular subset or elemental energy, Potter’s levels were astronomical across the board. And what was even more astonishing, they were high but showed signs of depletion, meaning the numbers were bound to rise as his rest replenished and revived him.
Draco wasn’t a General Healer. He typically didn’t see patients again after their treatment ended. He wasn’t a Mind Healer, either, and he certainly didn’t have the experience to handle someone with addictions or dependencies. But he didn’t think that was what plagued Potter, and he couldn’t for the life of him explain why. He closed his eyes and sat back in his chair, unable to stop his thoughts from supplying the image of Potter before him in his kitchen, his body tense, his eyes so green and so, utterly
He quickly explores the rather intense moments shared between the two characters: the rivalry, the hostility, the way they would goad and antagonise the other but at the same time save each other from danger. It wasn’t unlike his relationship with Potter, though they’d managed to find a sort of balance. And apart from the occasional moments of uncertainty as an Auror, neither of them were caught in life or death situations.
Draco’s theory hadn’t been that Potter’s magic was hurting him, though. He’d suspected that Potter’s magic was so powerful, it helped him stay awake, helped him heal faster, and was the crutch he was using to cope with whatever demons he was fighting. As Draco’s eyes scanned the measurements and analyses on the parchments, he quickly realised that his theory was correct, and more than that, he found that Potter’s magic was unconventionally powerful.
But what truly surprises him is the ease and flow of their dinner conversation. They talk about Harry’s current caseload, the state of things at the various Quidditch clubs, the news of new shops and old ones around Diagon and Hogsmeade and — a subject they both share most passionately — Teddy’s preparations for school.
?” Draco bites his lip and shakes his head. “A hook-up on vacation? A string of sexual encounters until you find someone better, someone worth courting?”
Draco fixed Harry with a solemn stare and pressed his lips together in a flat line. “You’re the Boy Who Lived, the Head Auror, and the man I’ve been hung up on since before I can remember.” He grabbed Harry’s hands. “And you’re terrible at paperwork.”
He summons the bottle of lube under his breath, and after a few moments, pushes in another finger. When he starts pressing in and out, he hits the sweet spot inside Draco.
Draco had almost forgotten who was lying in the hospital bed until the intern said the patient’s name before spouting off Potter’s listed afflictions. And before he could stop himself, Draco’s eyes found their way to Potter’s relaxed face. He couldn’t help but wonder if his eyes were still as green as he remembered, or if it was simply an embellishment in his distant memories.
“I think you would’ve gotten a bit too much enjoyment out of smashing Bludgers at innocent Gryffindors.”
“We have our own coffee in Spell Damage. So if anything happens to you after you drink it,” she leaned back, “take it up with my station staff.”
Draco shudders at the words and thinks he might die. Praise from the lips of Harry Potter? He shakes his head and gulps as disappointment hits him and he realizes what’s really happening.
Before he realised it, Draco was stroking his cock, thinking of desperate green eyes and the way Potter had thrown himself into the doorway earlier. It was ridiculous—Draco shook his head under the spray of the water—that he would be so turned on, so enthralled, by that show of recklessness. How could Draco feel attracted to such a grisly display of strength? How was it that Potter made him feel all of this despite everything else between them?
“Bollocks,” he muttered before heaving himself up and padding over to the window. He peeled back the curtain slowly to reveal his Aunt Andromeda’s screech owl, Pyxis, clutching a parchment in its beak. Draco shielded his eyes as best he could as he unlatched the window and let the frantic bird inside.
He blinks and dismisses the other fantasies he’s had—rolling over in bed to be met by bright green eyes and a warm smile, running his fingers through messy raven hair in a casual, relaxing tangle of their bodies while Draco reads
months. It was more than a bit daunting. So much could change in such a span. Six months ago, he would have—
It was only after stepping back through the fireplace nestled in the corner of McGonagall’s office that he realised he’d forgotten entirely to drop by Eeylops and pick up a sampler of the Peppermint Ginger Goose Gizzard treats.
now he’d nearly died in this tower; Potter was and ever had been hazardous to Draco’s health—Potter laid the parchment between them and returned to his scribbling. A casual glance between wolfing down treats that tasted like Chicken Surprise (was the surprise ‘cannibalism’?) and Boeuf Bourguignon showed Potter to be badly bullshitting his way through an essay on nonverbal spells.
Draco brushed down his robes, fixing Potter with a hard look, then said only, “Greenhouses,” in a very meaningful tone that brooked no argument.
intention of making his way to London—not for a lark, and certainly not for Harry Potter, no matter how dire his straits or pretty his promises.
Draco gave him a long, unreadable look, then sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I trust you won’t go
side by side—back across the front lawn, making their way to the front entrance. Students were milling around outside now, with no few casting wary, wondering glances their way, but Draco tried to keep his head up and not notice. Potter seemed to have no difficulty doing the same. Draco wondered if he genuinely
“No, he’s not, so don’t have a fit. He is, however, a Metamorphmagus, just like his mum.” Potter sat down in one of the easy chairs, bouncing the baby on his knee. Tedward broke out into delighted giggles, and his hair, which had been a dirty sort of dishwater blond, began to blacken and curl like straw thrown on a fire.
trusted in him and gave their lives to see his will done. There was no place for cowards on either side, so if I didn’t pick a side at all, then logically…I must be a coward.”
Potter rolled his eyes, sipping blithely from his mug. “I know it isn’t comfortable for you being here—in more ways than one. Is there
And it was as testing a question as Draco had ever heard. He locked eyes with Potter over his mug, and though the expression he found was even and passive, he’d been around this man long enough to know he had hidden depths to him that could drag you down if you underestimated him. Not that Draco had ever admitted as such aloud—he still had his pride, after all.
just as they were heading out the door. Harry suspected his timing had been planned so that he wouldn’t have to stand around waiting to see how Draco received the gift, which turned out to be a first-press edition of
. He deserved a bit of disillusionment to counter all that unaccounted optimism. “I liked you better when you couldn’t talk.”
“And why have you chosen to explore the field of Animagecraft, Mr. Malfoy?” then-Headmaster Snape had asked Draco, who had sat there in the old Potions study and felt very small and very vulnerable and very exposed, because there was a
“At any rate, I suppose you’ll be wanting an apology. I will admit I might have…taken some liberties with my Animagus form.” He began ticking off the mental list he’d prepared for this moment. “…I apologise for reading…well,
“Why?” Draco sneered. “Think I’m up to mischief again? Think I’m waiting for you to nod off so I can go and sacrifice your godson in a blood ritual to make my skin glow and my hair glossy?”
“You’re welcome,” Draco said simply. “Though I’m not sure what for. You may need to remind me of my generosity.” He rolled his hips. “Or is this a preemptive display of gratitude?”
to be an Auror? Going to make my continued freedom contingent on signing this stupid sheet of paper?”
They quickly finished up with the remainder of the paperwork and were lined up to Floo to the Leaky Cauldron by just after 1. Draco looked exhausted by the ordeal, still peaky around the edges, and Harry offered to call off lunch and just return to Grimmauld Place, but Draco was adamant they continue with their plans.
up at Draco, giving him a hard, appraising look. He could hear the rusty gears clanking about in her head as she tried to pick Draco apart, and in a desperate effort to put her off his scent, Draco took a wet shit on Potter’s shoes, doing his best impression of a disinterested owl. Potter squawked in bright offence, and Draco just blinked slowly, getting comfortable on his perch.
Even though McGonagall was doing everything in her power to help them, the number of detentions was extreme, and Harry was beginning to worry that soon Draco will realise that the whole relationship was one big mistake. Before they became a couple everything was going well for the Slytherin then Harry happened and everything Draco worked for, gone to shit, even his work with Neville was forgotten because of their relationship. Harry knew that he was overthinking, but even the possibility of breaking up the still-new relationship scared him.
because of the fact that I'm going to be at work tomorrow and won't be able to post a chapter, I've decided to do it today!
“Oh, that makes sense, I always forget what can be accomplished with magic.” He smiled and reached to open the door. “After you.”
“He said that it would be a shame if the house caught fire or if someone was to happen to Ted.  I don’t know how but Draco got even paler, and then he started to apologize, he was frantic, he was begging Lucius to not harm me or any member of my family. He was on his knees saying that it was all his fault and I couldn’t do anything but stare at them. After some time Lucius just told Draco that if he won’t be in the Manor in 5 minutes his punishment will be worse than always” Harry noticed that Andromeda was full-on crying right now.
“You won and I won’t say it again.” Draco could just nod as the boy came closer. “Now come and help me to get rid of the feathers or you will be sleeping with a chicken.” Draco started to laugh at the comment.
When he exited the class Harry was waiting for him, for a moment he just looked at Draco as if to make sure that he indeed is okay and they can go. After this examination was over Harry smiled.
But he had to go back to Hogwarts, and the room of requirements happened and he once again did everything to ensure Potter’s survival, and the fucker saved him. Draco didn’t care at this point he didn’t care whether he will live or die the only thing that matter was the fact that Voldemort couldn’t win. So he threw his wand at Potter because he needed him to win.
“You better believe it. Now come on let’s eat ice cream, and go back to our room.” The Gryffindor smiled and couldn't help kissing Harry again.
“But it is, it’s all my fault. If I didn’t talk back he wouldn’t do it. I should have known better. I told them I quit. I told him that I if they want to kill someone then they can just kill each other. I don’t know what came over me. I’m sorry” The tears didn’t stop and he was so sick of crying.
“I didn’t do anything, yet. I just need to borrow some clothes.” At this admission, Ron sat up and glared at him
“Do you miss them?” As soon as he said it he wondered who he meant, Draco’s parents or his Slytherin friends that decided to leave?
Suddenly he felt movement from his right and upon looking there he realised that the transfiguration class ended and people started to pack. Quickly he reached for his bag when he heard McGonagall’s voice.
Harry once again found himself in front of Draco’s exposed body. Having everything he needed he wasted no time in opening the Slytherin up. Slowly he started to loosen Draco up using his fingers, putting the third one he slowly picked up the pace of the circular motion that had the blond whimper in his grasp.
She didn’t know what to expect from the mind of a boy who was forced into a role all his life. She thought that she will feel anger, hatred maybe even regret, but she was not ready for the hollowness, the emptiness that came with not belonging. She looked at the boy next to her and for the first time in her life, she saw someone who is truly exhausted, someone who doesn’t know how to be himself. She knew that some of the pure-blood parents are strict, but she never suspected that one of them could break their child in so many ways. She hoped that the boy will heal, Draco was strong she knew that and with the help of friends, she hoped that the damage could be healed. With help, she hoped that his open wounds that still oozed blood would heal, she knew that some will leave scars, but at least the boy wouldn’t question all his choices.
The first trip on their schedule was going to happen on Saturday when all the other students will go to Hogsmeade they got permission to apparate to Muggle London. Last week when they left McGonagall’s office Ron and Hermione immediately cornered them and asked what is going on, after they explained Hermione started to look for events that sounded interesting. On the third day of her research, she got an owl from her parents that informed her about a gallery show in London. He didn’t know if this will be something that would interest Draco, but after the three of them told him, his face immediately lighten up and a big smile appeared on the blond's face.
Upon learning what Voldemort wants to do with the Potters, Narcissa decides to write a letter and give up the only thing that matters to her, Draco. This story will focus on Sirius and Draco, basically, the Potters live, but James cannot forgive the Death Eaters for the attack on his family so he doesn't want Sirius to raise Draco which leads to a big fight due to which Sirius moves to France with Draco and no one knows where the two are. This may seem as a gloomy story but trust me eventually James realises his mistake and the fact that Draco goes to Hogwarts and Harry has a really big crush on him help a lot. So it's kinda angst, but mostly fluff and also wolfstar because there no everyone lives without wolfstar!
“You can find a muggle therapist or a squib, I may know someone who would be willing to help you.” Surely the man was joking, why would someone agree to help him, he was a Death Eater, a disgrace. “You don’t have to agree. I’m going to leave their card, so you can contact them.”
He took the knife and started to dice the ingredient, Draco still held him as the shape started to look better and better. Harry could tell that the blond decided that he was satisfied when he once again leaned to Harry’s ear and whispered. “See you in our room, Mr Potter.”
Immediately he knew that something is wrong, he jumped out of his bed and quickly made his way to Draco’s side. “Draco, wake up!” For a moment he thought that it worked because Draco stopped moving, but then the trashing came back and Harry was almost thrown off the bed. “Come on Draco. You have to wake up!” He really didn’t want to touch Draco in this state but soon it became clear that there may be no other way.
She noticed when Draco started to look worse and worse, she knew that this time she had to do something. The talk after her lesson gave her hope, she knew how the boy was brought up and that for him asking for help was something that he still considered bad, but she reminded herself to stay positive after all a Potter was his friend. Stubbornness was in Harry Potter’s blood and it was twice as strong as it was in his father, Lilly Evans was a brilliant and extremely stubborn witch. The boy was in good hands and she was sure that eventually, he would cave in and finally she would be able to do something.
in a bright coloured letter, at first he didn't understand, but when he lifted his eyes from the title to Harry his eyes caught on the painting that shows a woman wearing hijab with a big smile on her face, next to it is a painting of another woman this time in a black barque holing bright yellow lemons in hand that created a beautiful contrast from which Draco couldn't take his eyes away.
If you wanna see something really horrible this pride month I recommend you read about the policy of the Polish government towards LGBTQIA+ community. Please if you know someone in Poland that is a part of LGBTQIA+ community show them your support, show them that you see them and that they matter and that the Polish government cannot erase their existence. If you are from Poland I see you, I support you and stay strong.
Then came the day when he was healed and Voldemort wasn’t in the Manor and Draco wanted to run, but his aunt came and dragged him to the ballroom where the golden trio was surrendered by Death Eaters. He knew what was going to happen and he couldn’t let Voldemort win, so he lied. And then he was punished for it and the worse thing was that he didn’t really care because maybe his lie gave Potter and his friends a chance at winning. Maybe finally he did something good.
“Yeah, I have the same problem. I suppose it has to do with growing up far away from the city or any kind of fumes. From what I remember Malfoy manor is located in a small village in Wiltshire so the air is much cleaner, just like at the Burrow.” He looked at Ron and smiled because this was exactly what he meant, he didn’t want to be rude, it just that he hates the city.
“You’ve got yourself a deal.” He could swear that for a moment Draco smiled at him, but then his expression melted back in the mask he wore in public.
Draco scoffed. “There were rules. No pranking while one is asleep, nothing that would seriously harm the other and the most important one, no one can help you in your prank. The war is one on one not one on the whole house. There was also the unspeakable rule of nothing gross, but other than that everything’s one the table.” Harry smiled at Draco’s words.
“Harry, do you want to do something that is probably going to go terribly?” The Griffindor’s eyes were on him in a second.
Harry knew that Draco never really believed them, but still it was nice that everyone made an effort to end the injustice and favouritism that plagued Hogwarts. Thanks to this Harry could spend time with Draco outside their room which allowed them to find what according to Draco was the best tree near the lake in all the Hogwarts. At first, Harry wanted to argue, but now sitting under the tree he couldn’t agree more, not only could they see the whole lake, but also somehow the tree was always in the shadow.
“I know that you said that you’re gonna stay just till you find your own place, but I want you to know that you don’t have to go.” This left him speechless, Draco could feel tears making their way down his face.
“You need to relax and your hold needs to be more firm.” Draco’s voice was more like a purr and this time Harry suppressed his shiver. The blond initiated the moves of Harry's hand, with the additional grasp Harry did feel more confident in his movements. “Remember to protect your thumb. Here, let me.” Harry watches as Draco slid his fingers unto the knives handle in place of Harry’s. His left hand still firmly held Harry in place, the blond’s movements were calculated and he couldn’t stop looking at the way that the moved, he swallowed loudly just when Draco whispered. “Your turn.”
“I don’t know, a lot happened that year. Bellatrix started to teach me occlumency.” Harry noticed that at the word ‘teach’ Draco grimaced, he wanted to press but knew that right now this was not the best course of action, so he let the blond finish. “My father also started to put more and more pressure on me. He wanted me to take the mark and I really didn’t want to do it. Severus started to get weirdly involved in my life. The whole summer was a disaster. I don’t really remember…” Draco trailed of which made Harry looked at him.
“Oh, no. I survived the war only to be cuddled to death.” Both of them were laughing and Harry couldn’t believe that this was his life, he never thought that he would be that happy. “Come on Golden Boy since we’re already here let’s take a nap. I imagine that someone will wake us in time for dinner.”
year students appeared in front of them. Draco looked as Harry stepped in front of him successfully making him feel less uncomfortable.
“Hermione and Harry are going to be here in a moment.” Ron looked nice, the red-head was dressed in a muggle suit and Draco noticed that his hair was styled in a way that exposed his blue eyes.
Seeing as his mood deteriorated Draco moved towards Teddy and began to play with the kids, they always managed to lift his spirits. Today Teddy’s hair was half-ginger, half-blonde and they were as curly as Harry’s hair. Teddy's weird hair combinations always managed to make him smile. Draco's already felt better, but upon noticing that Teddy's hair started to straighten in some places, it elevated even more.
Now to the Polish problem, I really hope that if you are 18 you will vote in this election, I also hope that if you will vote you will choose someone who does not degrade a whole group of people. That being said if you are a PERSON that identifies as a member of LBGTQIA+ community I hope you know that people care, I care and that you are valid and visible. This fight will never be over and you cannot give up, there still a lot to change and I hope that you know that change can start with you!
The tea laid abandoned on the table. Andromeda was still looking at the stairs as if Malfoy would walk down them any second.
Truth to be told he wanted to ask for help, he wanted to get rid of that awful small voice that sounded just like Lucius from his head. He wanted a lot, but he also knew that there were things that he was not allowed to want. And he knew that Harry was one of that thing that he desperately wanted but could never reach.
He smiled and looked at his chosen one. “Don’t worry you are enough.” Before Harry could answer he kissed him again.
It was another two weeks for Draco to feel comfortable enough to meet Harry’s friends. Although he still felt uncertain, he knew that sooner or later he had to meet them and apologize. Deep down Draco knew why he hated them so much when he was younger and he didn’t want to be this person anymore. So he agreed to come to the bar with Harry and he decided to apologize and explain.
“It’s just an indicator when their traffic or a lot of cars but usually you can just cross the road and ignore the light.”
“Yeah, this one is too long. Can you remind me who is it this week Shakespeare or Byron?” Draco laughed.
Taking Harry’s hand into his he tugged the boy towards the paintings. Looking around he saw that every single one of them shown a situation that he guessed can be seen as controversial or weird for the muggles. The paintings showed people from all the ethnics, some showed the contrast between what is real and what is fiction. Draco loves every single one of the painting, he knew what was the goal of the exhibition and he was grateful because the author showed that they are equal, that they are all humans. He hoped that thanks to this person's work the muggles won’t start a pointless war, that in their world ended just a few months ago.
Harry couldn’t suppress his rage. He moved towards Draco and hold out his hand. For a moment he was afraid that Draco will reject it, but then the Slytherin looked at him. Harry saw the emotions that passed through his silvery eyes. It was sadness, but Harry could clearly see something more, something like hope. Draco took his extended hand and Harry pulled him up and without releasing his hand led him towards the new table.
“I’m honoured, truly, but Sam still isn’t attending Hogwarts, and I can’t just leave him.” He was surprised when the witch smiled as she heard the comment.
“I hate that you are right.” Draco looked at him and couldn’t hold his laughter anymore, the grimace on Harry’s face was comical.
“Are we having a picnic?” At his words, Draco guided him to the blanket and opened the basket. ‘Yes, we are. I have your favourites and I also managed to persuade Andromeda to send me one of the better wines, I think you will enjoy it.” He watched as a brilliant smile appeared on Harry’s face making him look breathtaking.
“Look at me.” Slowly he looked up, Harry’s face was opened and Draco knew that this boy would never lie to him. “That’s true there was a lot of scared boys, but you also had a father like Lucius Malfoy, who willingly invited the snake face to your house. Different scared boys had a choice, they could run, we never could. Two sides of the same coin both melded to fit a role and both still facing the consequences of the choices that were made for us” He couldn’t take his eyes away from the raven-haired Gryffindor, no one ever put his thoughts in such a correct metaphor.
“Why would they threaten you?” Harry knew that Hermione was curious, to be honest, he was too, but he was afraid that Draco is going to retreat again.
year students were avoiding the Slytherin and Draco only talked with him, Ron or Hermione. Then during one of their study session, Neville asked Hermione for some books recommendations about potions and herbology, to everyone’s surprise, it was Draco who pointed him to a book that even Hermione didn’t hear about.
Harry’s smile grown because of what Draco said because he did want to shout this from the top of the Astronomy Tower, but now that he was given permission the prospect of actually climbing all the stairs of the tower didn’t sound so appealing. Instead, he decided that from now on if Draco is okay with it he is going to be as tactile as he can.
The Slytherin looked up at him and locked his gorgeous grey eyes with Harry's green. He couldn’t describe how perfect Draco’s eyes were, not only grey but also silver could be seen in them.
“Draco do you want to join us for a drink before Hogwarts?” Harry was surprised that it was Hermione that asked, but he was also very glad that she was taking this friendship very positively.
“Yes, these are the best days and soon there will be more and more of them. The Grimmold has a very big backyard. I’m also almost certain that if I ask for this tree they would give it to me.” The comment meant to make Draco smile, but Harry was aware of the fact that the ministry would do anything he wanted without questioning it.
Laying down Harry suddenly felt all his anxiousness leaving him, slowly he began to relax. “Can we just cuddle. I need a moment to relax. Please.” When he felt that the blond that a moment earlier was tense relax, Harry, smiled.
Holding Draco’s hand, he pulled the blond a little closer to himself and kissed him quickly. “I’m proud of you."
Draco wanted to cry, no matter what he is going to say, to do everyone is going to judge him and think that he is a fucking Death Eater. He will always be a Malfoy, a bully. “Why would I want to hurt anyone. There was a whole war to stop the hatred, the nonsensical killing of people that are not pureblood. And yet you still think that I would like to hurt someone when I finally got a second chance at life, I’m finally free from my parents, from this monster. You really think my dream is to become a killer like my parents that couldn’t look past their prejudice, like Vol-" He paused still h was still unable to say the name of the monster that destroyed his life. Then he thought about Harry, he says it and he is not afraid, maybe its time to be a little braver. He realized that he needed to used the name, he needed to stop the fear, he needed to be brave like Harry. "Voldemort who started the war just because he felt inferior?”
The blond looked peaceful and Harry loved seeing him like this, no worries, no stress. After half an hour Draco shifted a little and Harry discovered that he fell asleep. He smiled and started to stroke the blond’s hair.

Harry approached Hermione and squatted next to her. “’ Mione we’re back for the children.” At his voice, Ron awoke and sat up on the sofa.
Quickly Draco turned and faced the Headmistress, she was smiling, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder if she liked the troublemakers. “Hello Headmistress, I ask myself questions like this all the time. What can I help you with?”
“I didn’t want you to help me, Harry, I wanted to do this for you.” He watched the shocked expression that took over Harry’s face remembering that this was most likely the first time someone ever did something like this for the Boy-Who-Lived. “Also I’ve got you a present. I don’t know if you will like it, if not I understand and you can return it I won’t blame you. Anyway, here.” Quickly he took the present from behind the basket and held it towards Harry.
I'm currently trying to get my life together in order to finish this fic so please be patient with my wacky update schedule.
“Honestly Harry I don’t know. After everything that happened, I told him that if he ever needed a place to stay he could come here. He showed up a few minutes before you came. He looks like he barely holds it together. I think there’s something wrong.” Harry’s expression was unreadable and she hated the fact that these two boys that are so much alike are so cold to each other.
“Draco! Wake up. Come on!” The voice was stronger and he could almost recognise it. “Draco you need to wake up!” The forest disappeared and suddenly Draco was back in the room.
“I don’t know who you are or what you lost in the war if you want to hurt me, punish me or make me pay, know that I won’t stop you, but whatever you do this won’t bring your loved ones back, this won’t help you trust me. I also need you to know that if you think that for a second I wanted to be in Voldemort’s service you are mistaken. You may not see it that way but there were victims on both sides of the war.” Harry watched as tears made their way down Draco’s face.
“Nothing you need to worry about yet. By the way, I like your new style.” Draco's cheeks redden at Harry's laugh.
“Yes I want to, it’s been too long.” Draco smiled at him and after a moment he continued to unbutton Harry’s pants and slid them onto the floor.
Harry slowly shifted so that he was facing the blonde. With his free hand, he started to play with Draco’s hair, which caused the Slytherin to shift a little in his arms. “Draco it’s dinner.” The boy in his arms slowly opened his eyes and Harry’s heart stilled for a moment.
The situation in Belarus is awful, please talk about what is happening there and try to help in any way that you can.
“Maybe I will. Oh, by the way, don’t call him Malfoy, he kind of told his parents to kill each other and he’s currently waiting for Lucius to disown him”
The little boy always brought a smile to his face, this time was no exception. He felt as his lips turned upwards, call him weak but he couldn’t help it.
Draco wanted to pray but decided that the boy will tell him what’s going on eventually. “Do you wanna go to the library. I can revise your potion essay.”
“Harry, I’m not judging you. I promise. I forgave the ferret a long time ago. I just want to understand why did you feel the need to wake me up on this hour, when you have your own clothes” Harry wanted to laugh at this because if he thought about this he had no idea why he was so nervous.
Harry’s voice made him snap out of his train of thoughts. “So, how did I do?” Draco looked at him for a moment not comprehending. Harry gestured down to the paper that he still was holding.
I feel like slowly this fic is coming to an end, I already have some ideas for another fic I would like to write that's why with the next chapter I will provide a short summary of two or three fics I want to write and if you are interested you can help me choose which will be the first to be written! <3
“5 minutes but isn’t the manor at least a few hours from here? Was he able to apparate when this happened?”
When he looked at Harry once again the boy was laughing with him. “I will tell you a secret, you succeeded. I was so annoyed at you for this, but now I kinda find it funny. You were the only person that could rile me up like this.” After they composed Harry spoke once again. “I think we really need to go to sleep and maybe explore what else is in the room in the morning.”
Black Lives Matter, they always matter and always will matter! this is something that is a constant and will never be changed.
“Your speech at Diagon Alley. It really helped me. I never thought that I have friends or be in a friends group. This is new to me.” Draco seemed a little dazed, but there was still a smile on his face.
His mother was always schooling him on what to eat and what not to eat, how to behave and how to perfect his Malfoy mask of no emotions. His father, on the other hand, wanted him to be stronger and smarter than others, so he tutored him in his future school subjects as well as in politics and family history.
Draco laughed and hugged him tighter. “I’m here. I’ve missed you.” Hearing the confession, Harry pulled back and kissed Draco.
“The curse your father used is a nasty one. Do you know what he hit you with?” Harry moves his eyes from Andromeda’s hand to Malfoy’s hand and sees only panic and fear.

“I believe that this is all, you will be given your timetables tomorrow during breakfast so I recommend attending it. Oh and Mr Malfoy please stay for a moment.” Although her tone didn’t indicate anything bad he couldn’t help but clench Harry’s hand stronger.
“Draco, it’s okay. I forgive you, you didn’t know any better.” Harry smiled at him. “I think it’s time for the film we have shopping to do tomorrow.” He could only nod at the boy.
“I’ve never watched a movie before. As you may remember my family hates muggles and everything that is connected with them.” He can say that his tone is a little bitter, his father would smack him for it.
She heard as something fell to the floor. Something or someone and immediately she was up on her feet and on the way to the bathroom. The door was closed, she knew she could just open it but with the way, Draco acted she doubted that this was a good idea.
When the blond finally calmed down, he turned to towards Harry and leaned to kiss him, but he stopped right before his lips and spoke. “I didn’t have to. It was just luck.” Them he kissed Harry and all the worry disappeared. “But I don’t need the luck to win with you.”
Draco took one small step towards Harry closing the gap between them. He reached and placed his hand on Harry’s cheek not taking his eyes away from Harry’s green eyes. He noticed that Harry’s eyes shifted to Draco’s lips, Harry moved his arms to Draco's waist and then they were kissing. Draco moved his hands to Harry’s hair, the curls were soft and he smiled into the kiss.
He still didn’t know what to do. Deciding never was his strong side, maybe this was his downfall. But he really wanted to stay with Harry. The expression on Harry’s face did little to help him decide. The boy was looking at him as if he was the only person in the whole world. He felt as if he was drowning in the emeralds that were Harry’s eyes. He wanted to stay.
Before Draco could work himself into another panic attack someone knocked on the door and Teddy started to giggle. Andromeda opened the door and in walked Harry. He was dressed in a red t-shirt, one of many that they bought on their trip to muggle London, black jeans and a black leather jacket the origin of which he didn’t know. Draco was self-aware enough to admit that Harry looked good and that this may not be as awful as he thought.
Harry was almost sure that no one actually heard him, but then Hermione’s curiosity won. “What do you mean?”
“I promise not to hold everything inside. I learned my lesson” He felt as if the smile was permanently painted on his face, even if only for one day.
“I’ve never heard you swear in front of him, but I agree. It’s just that I can’t stop thinking that everyone will always see me as a carbon copy of my father and now I even have this stupid tattoo to prove their point.” He couldn’t’ help looking at his left forearm. “I just want to do something right for once in my life.”
Polish people, please don't lose hope, we can still fix the disaster that is happening in this country. Also polish LBGTQIA+ community, you are not an ideology, you are a person and I see you and I support you and I will always be on your side. Please keep going because you are important and you cannot let them win!
“Good, now I believe you have to go and find Mr Potter before he destroys the recently fixed doors.” She smiled at him for the last time and started to walk to the teacher exit.
For a moment Harry thought that he was wrong when they entered the whole great hall was silent. No one was moving, every single person stared at the four of them and then the spell was broken when people started to stand up and clamp. He wanted to run, but then he saw as some Gryffindor that was standing near Draco got a hold of his robe and tugged him down. Harry could hear as the Gryffindor spoke, his voice was full of hatred. “The clapping not for you, you dirty Death Eater scum.”
Draco stood and hurried to the door when he opened then he came face to face with the boy who lived. He smiled wickedly and addressed the boy in front of him. “Hello, roommate.”
The silence between stretched neither Harry nor Draco wanted to brake it. Finally, Harry gathered his courage, he looked at Draco and slowly helped the boy into a sitting position. “Draco, this wasn’t normal. What’s going on?” Harry was looking at Draco, but Draco was looking anywhere but at him.
Hello, I'm back. I don't know if I passed all my exams, but I'm exhausted and will probably sleep for a week give or take.
Another awkward silence fell on them and this time he decided to break it. “Okay. Standing is fun but you know what is even funnier Draco?” The boy looked at him with question painting on his face. “Sitting down my legs are killing me.”
“Are you okay? I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.” Harry’s eyes lathed at him and he tried to stop the shiver that threatens to go through his body.
“You know I always thought that he didn’t know. I made myself believe that if he knew then he would help me, but during the battle, I saw a memory that made me change my mind. I want to believe that he was a good person but knowing what I know now I sometimes what trouble seeing it.” Harry knew that he sounded angry and he hoped that Draco knew that it was not directed at him.
Harry was talking with Weasley and Granger about the teachers and what they think the arrangement with the dorms will look like. He tried to pay closer attention, but sitting so close to Harry was making it very hard to focus. He couldn’t take his eyes away from the boy, he remembered how soft his bird nest of hair was. He wanted to touch it again.
Draco looked up at him and Harry gave him the biggest smile he could muster. He could take his eyes away from the blushing blond. Suddenly he felt as something hit him on the forehead. He looked down and noticed o potato laying on his plate, immediately he looked up and noticed that the food appeared on the table. Harry looked up and smiled apologetically at Ron and Hermione. “Thanks, I didn’t even notice that the food was already here.”
“What are you doing?” Draco tried to sound intimidating, but the fact he was still laughing destroyed his effort.
Harry could tell that this was one of the most awkward situations he was in. nobody spoke, they sat and tried to not look at each other.
Looking up he saw, Harry's grinning face and Draco imagined punching the grin out of the Gryffindor's face. “I’m gonna get you, Potter.” This made Harry's smile widen, and Draco hated him.
“I hate your friends.” Harry looked at Draco’s punting face that perfectly complemented his messy hair.
Harry loved seeing Draco’s whole face lit up when he smiled and right now the boy looked lovely. Harry could feel his heart hammering in his chest. Draco’s voice startled him from his thoughts, when he looked at him he noticed that they were standing closer than he expected.
At this moment all he wanted was to just stop. He was eating just like always, maybe even less, his appetite still didn't come back after the horrible 6th year, but his mother just had to find something to comment on.
“What did you do?” He was expecting this question, but he had to admit that the fact that this was the first thing Ron asked still hurt a little.
Harry sounded sad and Draco knew that he had to reassure him, besides he had a proposition for the raven-haired boy. “No. I mean I don’t care. I’ve asked because I have them too like every night and I don’t want to wake you, but if you have them too then we can make a deal.”
“Yeah, that’s not the only thing he’s talented at.” This time Harry moved towards the blond and kissed him.
For a moment he just hugged the blonde then he realised what the last sentence meant. “Wait do you seriously had prank wars with your roommate?”
Now on the train back to school, he began to worry. What if Draco didn’t want anyone to know? Harry could live with their relationship being only known in their friends' group, but he didn’t want to be a secret. He was pretty sure that Draco also didn’t want to hide, hey didn’t talk about it yet, between the dinner, Teddy getting sick and then the New Year’s Party they had no time to discuss anything. Now sitting in their compartment on the Hogwarts’ express Harry knew that the first thing the two of them has to do is talk, preferably in their dorm and in between kisses, but still talk.
Draco simply nodded and once again walked to his bed, took his pyjama and walked to the toilet. He knew that he could change in the room, Harry wouldn’t judge him or make fun of the scars that permanently covered his body, but he still felt uncomfortable with the idea of showing them. Quickly he changed not looking in the mirror and lest the room. Harry was already laying under his covers, he made his way to his bed and lied down.
Draco stumbled back and fell down from the weight of it all. The interns helped him up and fussed over him until he regained his composure and batted them away.
Harry hasn’t the slightest clue that Draco has catalogued every shade of green cascading through his emerald irises; he has no real notion that Draco spends hours and sometimes days sketching and painting images of Harry. He has no idea that Draco started doing such things in service of a malicious therapy; that his implacable resolve to once again even the score with Harry Potter inevitably resulted in the illumination and enumeration of the darker parts of his heart. In his quest to depict Harry Potter on the canvas, to show him truly as he was, Draco discovered his capacity for kindness, mercy, and to his utter shock, his own twisted version of heroism.
Dreamless ages ago.” He lowered his voice. “I think it’s just been the transition. The stress of moving and a new job, especially being back here. Being back at the Manor. Even with the bloody signet removed, it’s still a lot to just be living there. But we had Aunt Andi over for supper and she said there was a remarkable improvement to the
“Potter!” Draco rushed to his side and quickly cast an assessment on his injured shoulder. It had popped back into place, only showing slight signs of bruising. “What the actual fuck!”
“We could try the Disrobe Charm?” he offers, unsure if he can physically remove another item of Potter’s clothes without bursting into flames. He’s filled with guilt that he even feels the least bit aroused in the midst of such an emergency. For Circe’s sake, Potter’s not even conscious!
In adulthood, Draco had feared the Pensieve, for so many reasons, but mostly because he couldn’t dare face some of the people he’d let down:
Potter let out a hearty laugh. “So before you realised it was from something, you thought they were crazy?”
On a Thursday in mid-October, Patil assisted on one of the nastier surgeries. They decided to go out for dinner afterwards to an Italian restaurant near the Ministry. “This place is amazing,” Patil said while they waited for a table at the bar. “The mushroom risotto…”
There was a line, and they found themselves waiting for a few minutes in the dark corridor outside the door. Eventually, Blaise leaned in and lowered his voice. “Are you feeling a bit better, then? You look great compared to a month ago.”
“Time heals all wounds?” Malfoy raised a brow, giving Harry a thoughtful, earnest stare. “Well there you have it, Imelda! Let the sting of past aggressions heal then invite them over for tea and biscuits.”
He regarded Patil. “It’s my first day.” He met her eyes. “The ink on my contract is barely dry and Harry bloody Potter is already bleeding out on my table.”
“Ta,” Blaise offered his arm, and in a blink, they were pulled through by their navels and dropped at the Apparition Point in Diagon.
Draco was assigned to the Trauma Ward at Notre Dame for his internship when he’d proven his deftness and could stomach the more disturbing, sanguinary, and unpleasant cases as they presented. His superiors praised him, gave him awards, elevated him to the coveted apprenticeship under the Healer-in-Charge, Pierre Mansouri. Draco thrived. He rose to a place where no one questioned his prowess; no one judged his skills.
“Draco,” Potter closes his eyes, a pained expression stealing his features. “I’ve been trying to court you.”
Malfoy tilted his head down ever so slightly and his lips—which Harry was definitely not starting at—curved up with the smallest hint of a smirk. “The dates are incorrect. You’ve noted the case starting three months before the crimes were even committed.” Malfoy stated, calm as you like. “Next?”
Draco is captured by the arrays of light and stardust that emanates from the folds in the veil. He watches in rapture as a dozen or so Fae dance and sing in the clearing, their voices blossoming buds of purple and blue flowers, their touch melting the snow.
“Nothing.” He turned around and began to leave the kitchen, but Draco bolted up and moved quickly to block his path.
Potter bites his lip. “See, you would think that! But it’s really Phaeden’s inability to forgive Orion that stands in the way of reconciliation.”
“Thank you,” Draco breathes. He can’t help but savor the feel of Potter’s fingers digging into his hips.
“Thank you,” Potter managed to say after they got over the flowerbeds. “I know you didn’t have to do this, but I appreciate it.”
“Right,” Draco agrees, though he isn’t sure if he actually speaks it aloud considering how winded he feels from Harry’s words.
He knew it was wrong to want the Saviour, or a patient, or a Gryffindor, or an arrogant prick, or a selfless idiot, or a man so far gone in anguish that he was on an obvious path to self-destruction. But when Draco pictured those eyes, he could see the facets of Potter’s desperation. Beneath the exhaustion, Draco could make out the nature of his ego, the pillars of which were steadfast, strong, cemented by his levels of unwavering compassion and courage. Potter was built to endure whatever came his way and he didn’t know the meaning of surrender. Draco wanted so badly to show him the power of it, the blissful salvation he could find in submission.
He joins a group of Longbottom, Finnigan, Thomas, Lovegood, and Blaise around the wireless. Blaise grabs Draco’s hip and turns him a bit, setting a rhythm and helping Draco get lost in the beat of the song. He closes his eyes and gives himself over the music. For a moment, he imagines Blaise’s hands on his hips are Potter’s, and they’re dancing together in the Fae clearing on the hillside. Draco opens his eyes and stares off to the other side of the bonfire where Potter sits watching him with wild eyes. Draco melts into the saturated warmth it sparks inside him, and gets losts in the bright, emerald green. Draco bites his lip and looks away, too overwhelmed by the stare. When the song ends, he smiles sheepishly at Blaise.
The request surprises Draco, but he nods and claims a spot in the armchair across from the couch. As he settles in and picks up where he’d left off earlier, and the room is filled with the sound of his voice and the crackling of the burning fire. Draco gets through four chapters before he looks up to find Potter asleep, the blanket a heap on the floor.
“What’s inappropriate is how much satisfaction you get by rejecting my work,” Harry breathed, “and how every—single—thing you do draws attention to your stupid—sexy—lips.”
“Hope you’re decent!” Finnigan yells and storms into the enclosure. He eyes them and winks. “Oh come on you two, s’been over an hour. Pack it in. We’re all dressed and ready.”
He and Patil finished up their assessments and recorded everything in the chart before handing it back to the intern and leaving the room. They stood in the hallway and stared at each other.
No matter how much he willed it out of his mind, when Draco stepped under the spray of scalding water, the flurry of images and emotions flooded his head and his hand fell into a frantic rhythm around his throbbing cock. He didn’t want to feel this way, but at the same time, he wanted it so badly the desire to get it was tearing him apart.
“No,” Draco said quickly. He stopped and hastily tried to come up with an excuse. “I have some notes to finish before it goes into the record.”
“It feels—” Draco starts but then Potter shifts and shatters something inside him, and all he can say is “Harry” before he tumbles over the edge and falls. He’s an erratic mess of movements and moaning as Harry pulls on his cock and takes him for everything he has.
“Me?” Harry moaned when Malfoy’s fingers squeezed harder around him. “You couldn’t wait to get your hands on my prick.”
Luna stares at him, and Draco has to look three separate times to make sure his Disillusionment charm had worked, not that he’s the least bit hard after Luna’s questions and Blaise’s glares. The conversation dwindles, and Draco’s thankful to get back to the cabin where he can throw himself into his room and hide from everyone. He takes a nap and emerges ready for a glass of wine and some lunch.
“Finish cleaning him up,” Draco ordered. “And get an intravenous Dreamless Sleep ready. We’ll administer it
“No, Merlin, Malfoy, I’m just—” he stopped and stared up at Draco. “I’m impressed. I wouldn’t have expected that.”
He closed the mirrored cabinet and stared at his reflection. His hair was still tied back but almost half of it had come loose to rest around his face. His pupils were blown and his lips were stained red from the wine. He let his gaze fall to the pale scars that ran their way down his neck, chest, and stomach before finally allowing himself to acknowledge the half-hard cock between his legs.
He hoped a few fingers of firewhisky and some peace and quiet would help relax him. It almost felt surreal to be alone in the Manor, sitting where his father used to sit, the more worn of two leather armchairs in front of a large marble fireplace. Draco had always imagined himself sitting in the armchair opposite, joining Lucius for a nightcap and discussing politics or trade news, and yet now, that entire scenario seemed unthinkable. Never in all his youth did he ever suspect he’d be where he was. Alone.
“Oh, fuck,” Blaise cursed. “That’s today? Sorry, Draco, this….mess….it has to get put right before we open for deliveries tomorrow. I’m going to be here all night.”
Blaise’s eyes went wide and he cast his gaze down to the table. The cafe’s atmosphere was picking up as morning commuters rushed in and out with their to-go coffees and teas while others settled in and claimed the remaining cafe tables. The increase in background noise seemed to quell the rise in tension between the three of them.
He clutched the note and threw open his bedroom doors, rushing to the foyer to find their eagle owl.
“They—” he began to ask, but when Weasley and Granger turned around to look at him, Draco’s eyes fell to the patient behind them.
Potter noses Draco’s cock before he spits and puts a hand to it. “I want your cock in my mouth,” he whispers. “Is that alright?”
But the auctions were something a bit different. He was able to see the responses of the casual observers, the wannabe art collectors, the serious and the disturbed, and to his utter amusement, sometimes even Harry James Potter.
You see, he realised, the losers of a war mourn death the same as the winners, though their loss and their scars are reminders of not just the inability to save those they loved, but also their failings in heart, mind, and spirit. Had Draco only stood up for the right cause sooner; if he’d only been less afraid; if he’d somehow listened;
“Can’t believe you went to all this trouble,” Finnigan says as he eyes the kebabs and various other dishes.
“Yes, of course,” Harry says. He follows Draco’s gaze. “Look, I got rid of a lot of things. But these? This is a bit of history, like the house, and you can’t erase the past or these outdated views and opinions. But you can build on it and move on from a point of understanding.” He takes a deep breath and makes sure to meet Draco’s eyes. “That’s why I have
Narcissa was on her feet and by his side in a moment, holding him up and taking him in her arms. “I know,” she whispered.
He’d made a reminder in his calendar to owl someone later in the week about it and he spent the rest of Sunday preparing for his first day at St Mungo’s.
After the eleven-hour surgery, he finished his Post-Op routine and made his rounds before locking himself in an on-call room and finally finding sleep for about six hours. But with one of his Healers out sick, the Trauma Ward needed him back in by mid-day Saturday. He picked up twice as many non-surgical Trauma patients, and with them, twice as much paperwork.
Draco fumbled for the pallet in his pocket and set it on the ground with care before charming it back to its normal size. He pulled the invoice from his pocket and got the signature from the clerk.
It had all been very serious and overwhelming, Harry standing there facing the Wizengamot, standing up for Draco. It was the first time Draco had experienced the simultaneous feelings of indignity
He found a pair of jeans and a shirt and hastily put them on. He didn’t have much time if he was going to brew the special Dreamless Sleep. Most sleeping potions took less than an hour to brew, but his formula needed to simmer for eighteen hours for the Brilhante Berries to properly permeate it. With two days off from the hospital, he would barely have enough time to prepare it and get it to Potter.
Draco smirked. “It’s so much more than a bottle of wine. It’s an experience.” He gladly told her all about the vineyard where it was made in France and the few precious days he’d been able to steal away to spend there. When he closed his eyes, he could picture the golden sunrises on crisp mornings, and the genuine smiles from people who loved the simple wine and culture that they cultivated.
When he realised how much of a difference the few shorter workdays had made, it struck him that he even
“I’m just—” Draco frowned. “As his former Healer, I’m merely stating my concern for his overall well-being.”
for Christmas. It isn’t Draco’s fault the detective series is well-written, suspenseful, and satisfying. He’s already read it in its entirety twice, but he’d never tell Blaise that.
That is what he had been doing on Saturday night—an ungodly amount of paperwork—when an intern sent their basset hound Patronus to alert him that a new patient had arrived. Draco made his way to the Trauma Station, a bit of excitement in his step, eagerly wondering if there was a surgery for him in the near future. The enthusiasm faded as he made out the figures of a tall redheaded man and a petite woman with dark curls.
hanging front and center in the main room. There’s a whole story to be told. I can’t just skip over the parts I don’t like.”
She ran her hands down the outsides of his arms. “Of course you do,” she said. “You want to help him.”
The freed hair fell down around his shoulders, the length of it covering half his chest. He fixed his part to the centre and nearly gasped when he realised how much he looked like his father. But on closer inspection, his jaw was slimmer and his nose much finer—his mother’s, he reminded himself. For as much of Lucius as there was in Draco, there was just as much Narcissa, if not more.
As the days flew by and Draco fell into a routine, he grew thankful for the events of his first day—that they’d thrown him and Patil together. She never became less abrasive, but she listened to him, she offered advice, and she trusted him with her own personal and professional confessions. And of course, there was the Spell Damage station coffee. When she brought him a cup from her ward, his day was made instantly better.
Harry’s plans were tossed out the window of a flying Ford Anglia the moment he stepped into the H.U.M.P. office to turn in said reports.
