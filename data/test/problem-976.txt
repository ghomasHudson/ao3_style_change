The woman said.
"Guilty." said Harry, raising his shoulders. "Hence my fancy outfit."
"Poor Angie, she got the worst Weasley." Bill joked from behind Harry. "Hoping he won't drive her mad!"
Pansy smiled with tears in her eyes, then she threw herself at Draco.
"Here it is, the happy couple!" Goyle's voice boomed. "You think you're so cool because you kissed in front of everyone? The truth is you're simply dirty homos."
"Can you give us a minute, Hagrid?" Harry asked.
The lunch went on fine and it culminated with a chocolate sponge cake log called a "bûche de Noël", a dessert that was usually eaten in France as a Christmas Tradition. Fleur had spent a good amount of the afternoon of the day before making it alongside Mrs Weasley.
"Ginny, I care about you," Harry said. "But we just didn't click. We're better off as friends."
He had George send him his grandmother's engagement ring by owl post and waited for the Ceremony to ask Hermione to marry him.
The birthday girl frantically tore the wrapping apart to reveal its content, it was a bonsai version of their historic tree.
The next day they woke up late. It felt like a repetition of Christmas.
"You better stay away from us, Zabini." Harry said sternly, he then put his hand on his pocket.
"So um... do you think I'm cute with your mum's gloves?" Luna asked her for a second time, as she sat in the bed next to the other girl.
Finding love and friendship had also been a very important part of her life in that castle.
"I told you, I have done nothing with him. He kissed me right in front of you just to break us apart, I'm sure. He's the one who had a plan, if anything. " said Draco, looking into Harry's eyes, risking to lose himself.
That day, said spot was free as most of the players of each team were busy revising.
I was determined not to be found out, but, apparently I let something slip - I was being too evasive with Draco.
Ginny breathed a sigh of relief. It was not that appealing, but at least it was better than being expelled.
"I don't really care." Harry replied with a shrug. "I just feel so euphoric when we kiss. Eh,even by simply being with him, really. I mean just look at him smile... it might sound shocking, but... Draco's really sweet once you get to know him."
"But it was worth it, I'd say."
Ginny was the first one she greeted, pulling her in a bone crushing hug.
"Oh I don't know if she told you, but... Luna is coming too, for Christmas. Dad's invited Xenophilius."
Draco slowly unwrapped it, Harry watching while smirking.
"Are you sure?" asked Harry, folding his arms. He had one eyebrow raised.
Harry closed a fist and when he opened it back something was in his hand, a ring box.
She asks Harry some more questions, and Harry tries to be as useful as he can, even though he knows close to nothing about Rookwood Jr.
“Nothing, thank you. I am actually looking for a friend of mine. His name is William. Apparently he works here.”
Suddenly and without warning, a beam of light appears behind Mr Diggory, and he falls to the ground, unconscious. Someone is running towards them.
Robards hums in agreement. “Indeed. This way we don’t lose valuable resources, but we also do our due diligence to protect those who don’t want to be protected,” he says, the ghost of a half-smile around his lips. “He will need to move in with the Auror in question for the time being, and tag along while they work. Have the cake and eat it too, all that.”
“I am beyond grateful you have decided to take on my request, Mr Potter,” Narcissa says, settling into the armchair across from him. Still, no house elves appear to be present, nor does an offer of tea.
“What’s this?” he asks.
Harry’s stomach drops. “What?”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He doesn’t know if it’s his attention span or his memory that makes him forget that that’s not at all how he needs to be thinking about Malfoy, but he’s getting on his own nerves now.
He does what he does, things he clearly knows to be wrong, evident from how terrified he is of the repercussions. And yet he has no problem doing them up until the moment he has to own up to them. That’s something Harry will never be able to understand, nor empathise with.
They go to Flourish and Blotts first. Malfoy says he needs ink and new parchment for writing music. Harry didn’t know he wrote his own music, and he really, really wants to ask him to play him something of his own sometime. But he doesn’t.
“Well,” Harry says slowly, swirling the wine around his glass, “I’m sure there are more surprising things about me that you don’t know.”
She looks away from Harry’s face.
He looks away from his wine glass and at Harry, eyes desperate in a way Harry has seen them before, and he didn’t understand it then, what Draco needed him to know, but he does now.
Malfoy just looks at him, presses his lips together for a second. Then says, in his quiet way, “Yes.”
“I’ve learnt a lot,” Draco continues, eyes back on the blood red liquid swirling in his glass. “I know about electricity. Putting out your hand at bus stops and shouting ‘Thank you!’ to the driver from the middle of the bus when you get off. The internet. Muggle wars that almost destroyed all of us, and the genocides. I’ve... it’s an interesting thing, you know, that horribly slow realisation that dawns on you. You only notice it when it becomes—when it becomes so heavy your back almost cracks under it. That they’re… like us. Exactly like us.”
Harry thinks. He scans the Prophet article about Nott’s murder, written by Moira Hughes—one of the less sensationalist journalists Harry has come across, but with an overbearing sense of self-importance nonetheless.
There’s a tense minute of silence. Then Malfoy, quiet as a mouse, mutters a “thank you” into the space between them.
“What—what is he even doing in Muggle London? I don’t understand,” Harry says, utterly confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Let’s move to the living room.” When Draco looks up, surprised, he adds, “I need to stretch my legs.”
Harry flinches. Bloody Malfoy and his quiet feet.
And Harry shuts up, clenching his jaw painfully lest it open on its own volition, because he knows that tone, that look. Robards’s word is final. He will have to share his flat, his
Harry looks up. Chandra—Chandra is here. Mr Diggory is disarmed. Draco is okay. Harry closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. “Chandra,” he says, his voice breaking. “Chandra, I—I really fucked up, I—he could have died.” His breath catches in his throat with the realisation of just how close he was to that. How close he was to losing Draco.
“No,” Harry admits. “Hermione gave me a book of his for Christmas, but I never read it.”
Harry looks at her. “I appreciate you.”
“What were you doing in France?” It’s out of his mouth before he can stop it.
He pauses, then, the tips of his ears flushing red, and Harry thinks,
Harry laughs quietly. “Alright. ”
Harry’s stomach flips. He can feel his jaw dropping open, but he’s utterly unable to do anything about it.
look out of place next to him?
“Draco,” he says.
Harry can’t help but think it’s anger, and maybe frustration or despair that have left their mark on this woman.
“You didn’t know you were a wizard?” Malfoy asks, eyes wide. “Sorry,” he says when he realises he’s interrupted, giving a little shake of his head, a single blond lock untucking from behind his ear. It curls softly against his cheekbone.
Malfoy takes the food from his outstretched hand. “Thank you.”
“Much appreciated,” Harry says, and sends down the contents of the vial at once.
“Malfoy, please, if you’d just listen to me—”
So Harry leans forward again and presses his lips against his, light and chaste. Draco’s breath hitches; so quietly that Harry wouldn’t have heard it if it wasn’t for the complete silence of the night; if they weren’t kneeling right in front of each other. But it’s enough to propel him on, to make him press closer, kiss him again and again, just as light and soft, until Draco gasps into his mouth and, with two quick movements, crawls into Harry’s lap, knees on either side of Harry’s hips.
Malfoy seems to hesitate, something Harry thinks is embarrassment or shyness crossing his face. But then he nods. For some reason, Harry thinks he would be even more embarrassed if he asked him what he’d like to eat, so he doesn’t. He could, and he’s not entirely against witnessing the flush spread from Malfoy’s ears, even if he doesn’t want to form coherent words for
He’s vibrating with nerves, alight with the urge to protect Draco. He’s been reluctant to let him out of his sight since the arrival of the unsigned, cryptic letter. After they came out of their shock last night and Draco announced he was going to sleep, Harry almost told him he was to sleep in Harry’s room. Then thought better of it and put up a charm in his room instead that would alarm Harry if there was any movement in or around him during the night.
He takes in Draco’s hands. The tense set of his shoulders. His collarbone peeking out from under his askew shirt. The way his lips are pressed into one hard, nervous line. How he looks anywhere but at Harry.
“That was very Gryffindor of you, Draco.”
Malfoy looks at him, then. Purses his mouth in that way that Harry has come to understand is embarrassment with himself. But he doesn’t say anything, just shrugs. And Harry really wants to say something, grab him and shake him and tell him it’s okay, that he doesn’t have to apologise for existing or requiring things, that he doesn’t have to keep punishing himself and not letting himself have anything.
But at the same time, he also feels like there’s so much more he could say, so many details he could share; and, nonsensically, that maybe he will have more opportunities to explain it all.
“I do. Your mother does. And you’re living in London, Malfoy. Anyone could have seen you. Or intercepted your letters from your mother. You’re not safe here,” Harry insists. “The Auror Department maintains that—”
Draco opens his eyes slowly. He looks around before his eyes land on Harry, confusion written all over his face. “Harry?” His voice is quiet and hoarse. Then his eyes widen, and he sits up abruptly.
“No problem,” she says, smiling. “What was your name again?”
He can’t stop looking, and his brain is so high on it that it prevents him from even considering controlling himself, now. Because why would he try and put a stop to
Harry doesn’t want to understand. Even as the fog in his head is clearing—he can’t believe what he’s seeing. Even as he takes in his surroundings for the first time, and realises with a jolt of horror where they are—he refuses to.
“Says the man whose office is decorated in Gryffindor colours! Now stop avoiding the question.”
“It’s ok. Just go pick out a bottle of wine and have it aerated by the time I get back. Thanks love!”
“Maybe getting drunk again will get me to time travel back?”
“Oh Harry!” Hermione gave him a hug. “It depends how deep the fear is but we could try. You have to understand that this has to go to a deeply disturbing point, we are talking psychological torture Harry.”
“Well it worked didn’t it!”
“I’m really worried you two are putting too much faith in me.” Hermione was nervous about how this would go down but looking between the two men she knew she had to try. “There’s also the matter of Harry’s death.”
Realization dawned on both men at the same time.
“None. I’ve always wanted to get to know you better and it looks like this is my only chance to do just that.”
“WHAT.”
“You died.”
“Can you cook or bake?” Harry asked.
My apologies to anyone named Josh.
“Oh come on, that’s cheating.”
“Ha. Ha.” Draco started rummaging around the pantry not really knowing what Harry had for him to work with. This may have not been the smartest plan since he wasn’t in his own kitchen.
“Got us some food and I borrowed a few books on time travel from the archives.” Harry handed the book bag to Malfoy and made his way to the kitchen to get some plates. Draco followed and settled himself at the table.
“Wh-what do we know so far?” Draco was really worried he was about to get caught.
Draco grabbed the book and looked at the page it had opened itself up to. “Particularities of time travel. Do’s and Don’ts,” he read out. “Well that seems specifically important to my situation.”
“But it could work?” Harry inquired, strangely hopeful.
“Harry, you need to know I love you and I never want to leave you. Whenever you’re ready I plan on marrying you and growing old with you. I want to have kids with you and go through life experiencing everything with you.”
Now standing in the rain surrounding by quiet and not so quiet sobs he wondered if it had all been for nothing. If he had missed his chance. If he had been too much of a coward to go for what he had really wanted…if it would have made any difference if he had.
“You told me when I went to the past.”
“Yeah, yeah, potions prodigy we get it.” Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Any way we could get some tea?” Draco politely asked.
“How things were?” Oh and there it was. An emotion. “What do you mean how things were? There were no things.” Anger. Yes. Good. Anger was a good emotion. Draco was familiar with anger. This he could handle.
Draco hid his face in his hands trying to cover up his blush.
-_-_-_-_-
Draco shrugged.
The next morning, Draco woke up before Harry. Feeling like his heart was shattering, he got up without waking his lover and made his way to the shower. He sat on the tiled floor as the warm water washed over him, mixing itself with his tears. He bit his hand trying to hide his sobs. He didn’t want to wake Harry up. He didn’t want Harry to see exactly how heart broken he was. He had no regrets over anything that had transpired these past few days but the thought of it ending was a cataclysm of sorrow.
“I…what?”
The next morning Hermione arrived shortly after the owl was sent.
“I don’t remember any of this,” Harry frowned.
“Hermione, genius once again!” Harry smiled, ecstatic at her idea. “Ok, I’ll go get the items needed for the potion. Don’t take this the wrong way, either of you, but I think I’m the one who should make it. I have a few tricks up my sleeve when it comes to potions.”
If you’re reading this, you must be bored for this theory is more that pure poppycock.
“My turn,” Harry declared. “If you were on a desert island with no magic and all the food and water you needed, what three things would you want with you?”
“Yeah. The giant arachnid. The first time you thought it was a boggart and things went horribly wrong.”
-_-_-_-_-_-
“What?”
“No, I don’t want to have any secrets between us. Ok, so, I have a fear of dying alone.”
“You’re up!” Harry stood at the door of the room.
“Man, we are really going vanilla with these questions!”
Draco couldn’t get over this new information. “So you’re telling me that you have the invisibility cloak, the resurrection stone and at some point you had the elder wand?”
It was Harry’s turn to initiate the kiss, making a small moan escape from Draco’s lips. The snogging session was moved to the living room where Harry ended up on top of Draco on the sofa. He eventually came up for air, sitting up and straddling Malfoy.
“Egg and cheese on a croissant,” Harry exclaimed when Draco joined him in the kitchen. “Do you want tomatoes on yours?”
“I can leave the room if you want to keep it between you and Hermione,” Draco wasn’t sure where his place was in all this. Harry seemed to be agreeing to get emotionally tortured for the benefit of their relationship and he wasn’t sure he liked it.
“Ok, ok. Oliver Wood.”
Harry nodded, fully agreeing to have one more night with the blonde man.
Harry wasn’t sure how to take this news. He just shook his head. “It’s not that simple. Can we come over?”
“That actually sounds really great. I need to go to the loo first. I’ll then go get us some tea and come back to bed. We’ll stay here as long as possible until we absolutely need food.”
“Anything that involves you is worth it.” Draco rolled his eyes at how sappy that was but was happy for the levity it brought to the moment.
His attention was taken away by a notification that Draco Malfoy was requesting permission to enter through floo.
“If we don’t do this, you’ll have gone through conversations I don’t remember. You’ll probably have to have those conversations all over again,” Harry said as he took Draco’s hand in his own. “We’ll have different memories on what our first kiss was. There might be moments where you think I know something about you but I don’t remember it. And I don’t know what it is that you know about me. I don’t want you to get bored hearing the same stories.”
“I tried to burn it off,” Draco said with no emotion.
Harry nodded. “Tomorrow. I need a glass of wine after the last couple of days we’ve been through.”
Draco didn’t say anything else. Leaving the books on the table, he dragged himself out of the room and up the stairs.
“I think you’re right. We need Granger’s help,” Draco broke the silence before taking a sip of wine.
-_-_-_-_-
“You did. I was there.  Weasley was there. Cindy-Lou was there. We were on a joint case.”
“Oh no, you better not pass out on me again.” Harry smiled.
“Malfoy what are you doing here? Are you drunk?
“Oh shut it Malfoy,” Harry responded without any bite to his words. Draco smiled.
Once again exhausted, Draco fell into a restless sleep.
“No, that’s not true. You guys have started a family and as your children grow you’ll become busier and more involved in their lives. You’ll have to focus on them and I’ll take a back seat. Don’t worry I’m not mad at you for it, that’s just life but it’ll leave me alone.” Saying it out loud, to someone else, made it all too real for Harry.
(if you need to skip i will be putting a small recap of the necessary information story wise in the notes to the next chapter!)
“Not really” was always Harry's answer. Ron didn’t always believe him but the conversation always ended there. Harry was sure he didn't expect anything close to the truth or he would push harder.
TW for mentions of abuse
“Dad thinks the minister is working with You-know-Who,” Ron said, cutting to the chase and throwing a handful of something into his mouth. He was the one who looked the most relaxed. Ginny wasn’t even looking at him. Harry raised his eyebrows at Mr. Weasly
“Stop,” Someone to his left said. It cut through the sickening glee he felt at the boy's pain. He faced the person who spoke. Harry recognized him and gasped. Voldemort became aware of him then, lurking behind his eyes and they were different people again. Everything went black as Harry was forced out of the moment.
Draco is found to be less than ready for the Dark Lords plans
“Leaving so soon?” Horace said with an air of disappointment. Harry would argue they’d been here for hours. Drinking and talking about pointless things.
Only it didn’t quite feel right when the Dark Lord was in the room. Draco didn’t feel right when he was told he’d be expected to kill Dumbledore in the following school year. The headmaster of Hogwarts who always opposed the Dark Lord. It was Draco's honor to remove that opposition.
It wasn’t like he was meant to save the whole of the bloody wizarding world or anything.
A place that looked exactly the same as it had that night, complete with a blood trail from the sink to the stall door. Had nobody even bothered cleaning up? Draco stood froze just inside the door. It felt too much like it had that night. He felt sure if he took a few steps he’d see Harry Potter lying on the stall floor. It took him an embarrassing amount of time for him to realize that he wouldn't see the boy here. That Harry was in the hospital wing. Draco felt an intense need to see what was inside the stall. Like he knew there would be something there. Something important. He forced his feet to move until the bloody stall came into view. And he almost forgot just how much blood there had been. As if his dreams weren't bad enough without that reminder. He found himself crouching down to further examine the dried blood staining the floor. He looked closer when a flickering caught his eye.
honestly Harry was in no mood for all of that rubbish. He looked between Horace and Dumbledore unsure of how he was supposed to handle this.
“Well go with you,” she said not even stopping to look at the shocked weasel, instead, turning and exiting the room just ahead of him. They walked through the hall side by side in silence. At some point, Weasley must have pulled himself together because he was now just a few paces behind them. Draco knew he must have looked miserable, and wondered if that was what people were staring at or if it was the fact that he was walking peacefully next to Hermione Granger. For good measure, he glared at a group of first and second years, satisfied when they looked properly terrified and stopped staring at him.
But it was all Draco could hear.
There were rules. There had to be rules. He’d been taught these rules as long as he could remember.
The next morning Harry left before anyone woke up to tell him what he needed to do, sure it might piss them off later if they remember. He woke and snuck out before light could even begin to touch his bedroom. He left before his uncle even started to get ready for work. Sure he was tired. Dead tired. He hadn’t much been able to sleep after… well, just after.
A door breaking open, a man filling the empty space.
He walked aimlessly for awhile not worried about running into anybody for at least another hour. He was completely lost in thought when he found himself standing in front of the very place he never wanted to see again. A place that would be stained in his memory for the rest of his life. A place he was heading straight into.
He was being stretched and spun again as they ripped their way through space. It was all he could think about until they landed. Harry breathed hard for a few minutes before he realized he was standing in water. His feet and ankles were soaked. He opened his eyes and almost fell. A mixture of despair and excitement was battling in him. It was the place he loved most outside of Hogwarts. It was the only place he wanted to spend summers. But it wasn’t the hospital wing, where he left Draco thrashing, and with Dumbledore gone he had no way to get back.
He took his time pulling himself out of bed. He felt heavy and sluggish and his head ached horribly. He pulled his glasses on, still trying to remember taking them off in the first place. He had dreamt, he was sure of it. But the figures were even more out of focus than the last time and the images were running out of his head faster than Harry could catch them. He remembered a long table. He couldn't place if there were other people. If there were they didn't materialize fully. He remembers his name, he thought it was his name anyways. But the rest was blurring wisps of nothing. He found his way down the stairs following the sound of voices. He hesitated just out of sight of the others.
“Me?” Draco asked hating the squeak in his voice.
Nobody knew what happened, in the way that everybody knew what happened. They all had their own version of what went down the night their savior almost died. Almost died, Draco scoffed at the thought. There was no almost about it. Harry Potter was dying if he was not already dead. It’s been a little over a week since anyone heard anything about the health of harry potter.
“You tell me” His voice was ragged and the hallway was spinning around Harry who was shaking his head.
“Head of Slytherin I was. Don’t you go holding it against me either. You would be Gryffindor then eh?. Like your mother.”
He thought briefly about going to visit Harry in the hospital wing but immediately disregarded that idea. He felt sure he'd be barred from entering and sent straight back to his room. Draco growled remembering when he went back to talk to Dumbledore the day after. He told him everything that happened, everything he saw. It didn't matter what Draco had to say. Dumbledore, like everyone else in this hellhole, already knew what must have happened. Draco had asked to see him and the headmaster shut him down, took his wand and sent him to the Slytherin common room. That was the last conversation he has had with anyone save Blaise.
He didn't want to keep it from Ron, he just thought a practice run and perhaps an ally would be helpful. He wanted to tell Hermione first, he thought.
“Fine. But you have a lot of explaining to do.”
But did all that mean that the boy had to die? Draco’s hands began to tremble slightly in his lap. He wasn’t ready for anything about this world he found himself in. there were so many things he knew, he just knew he couldn’t do. Things he had no choice but to do.
He wasn’t a very strong person. Not physically or any other way a person could be described as strong. But he was a determined person. It was with that determination, Harry slid his arms under the boys’ shoulders and knees and stood. He was light. But so was Harry. It wouldn’t be the easiest thing in the world. Harry wasn’t even sure where they would go yet. But he started walking anyway.
Malfoy looks up, eyes sharp. “Of course I regret it,” he snaps. Then his eyes widen slightly before he settles on the now ever-present expression of neutrality, as if he’s caught himself acting out of line without his own permission. But he tilts his chin slightly upwards, levelling Harry with a determined look from behind half-lidded, serious eyes. “Stop acting like you don’t know I’ve changed.”
Quote at the beginning of the chapter—The Good Guy by Dean Koontz
“Mr Diggory,” Harry says slowly, swallowing his panic and his desperation at seeing Draco unconscious, wand pressed against his throat. He channels the calm in the storm he’s had to use so many times before. In this exact same place, too. “Think about what you’re doing here.”
Harry deflates a bit. He doesn’t know how many times Malfoy has sort of guessed what he was thinking now, but it’s happened enough that he’s lost count.
Harry’s breath hitches. “Oh?”
He focuses so much on keeping his breathing even that he only realises Draco has finished the song when he speaks.
In an instant, Malfoy crosses over to Harry and pushes him out the door, slamming it behind himself.
“Please,” Harry says.
“You want me to go to the Ministry,” he says. It’s not a question.
“Exactly,” Harry nods. “He wasn’t. We have reason to think that this killer, whoever they are, is out for revenge. And Theo wasn’t the only victim who never committed a serious crime. This person will go after anyone who has ties to Death Eaters and hasn’t got punished for it.”
Her office was a small room with two doors. The entry one, which Harry had just used, and a second one behind her desk that led to the second keeper.
“They’re not as close as you, me and Ron are. I can’t expect them to come visit me in an old folks home. I’ll be there alone with no one to talk to.” Harry started having trouble breathing. “I was alone growing up. Yes, I was with the Dursley’s but they never cared for me, they’ll definitely not be around when I’m older. My life really started when I went to Hogwarts but what if, when that ended, everything started going downhill until I’m alone again.” His eyes were wide with tears that threatened to fall.
TRIGGER WARNING - mention of past self-harm
“We decided the best course of action was to obliviate you in order to make sure you wouldn’t go mad with the knowledge of your death.”
“He might leave.”
Instead of going away, Harry joined Draco under the falling water. He sat behind him, a tight fit but they made it work. He wrapped his arms around and simply let Draco cry. Harry felt like he should be crying to. For the loss of his love and the loss of his own life. He was too much in a state of shock to let the emotions take over. It all felt surreal to him. He had missed a lot of work which meant that he never really had to face his Draco. It would be so easy to go up to him and tell him how he felt but after forgetting all this, he would go back to being sort of friends with the snarky prat and believing he would never be loved back by him. Harry held Draco tighter.
He didn’t really like his apartment. It was dark and drafty. The money he got from selling the manor accompanied by the Malfoy inheritance meant that he had way more money than he could handle. He could afford a better place. The thing is he never really felt like he deserved to be in a good place. His flat worked for him. Gave him a roof and a place to sleep. He never had anyone over so appearance didn’t matter.
“I haven’t even thought of doing groceries since you’ve gotten here. Alright, I’ll go get us some take-away, you wait here.”
“Did you just kiss me?” Harry asked.
“Figured out what was happening and actually fixed things. Ended up being quite simple.”
“I like being told I’m a good boy,” Draco rushed out. Harry’s eyes went wide and a wicked grin settle on his face.
“What do you expect me to do? Tell you my real feelings? Freak you out and have you act differently towards the current me, causing my memories to change and have me go insane?”
She kept repeating "Best Birthday Ever!" as she did so.
Everyone gasped at the sight of a silver haired man who was carrying a black walking stick:
"Well, he said that it's something innocent in France. Maybe he really didn't think of it maliciously." Draco observed.
He would do anything for him, but only if he followed the path that was already established for him.
Draco stopped walking to give him a 'really?' look.
"Oh come on, babe, why do you care? The Room of Requirement is much bet- oh, Luna!" Ron awkwardly greeted the girl, who stopped twirling around to run to the couple.
This was his second holiday of the year that he would spend without his own family and seeing his friends being happy and cute and cuddly with their parents was becoming more and more unbearable.
The man beside her couldn't keep his tears from falling at the sight of this crying baby boy, happiness and excitement taking over him, realising he had just become a father.
His favourite moment had been when, in his fifth year, he'd become the Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team.
"Oh, I am more scared than you are." said Ron, shivering a little.
When midnight came, Draco debated using the floo powder to transport himself in the Gryffindor common room, since the new guy hadn't come yet.
Ginny took a breath. Luna was right, she had found herself thinking of her in some... ways. Even throughout her relationship with Harry, but at the time she had simply mistaken it for sexual frustration.
Her now fiancée got up and gave her a passionate kiss.
"I'm all ears." she said.
"Oh please, don't start again!" Hermione said in a reprimanding tone.
"Good, you didn't call me a mudblood, for once." Hermione observed. "Well, it just so happens that Harry is our best friend."
And so Harry did, by the evening of the day after he had his ring, safely hidden under the invisibilitycloak in his room.
Draco had become the new Team Captain, so he had to shake hands with Harry.
Hermione's Grandma was the life of the party.
The next morning, Harry and Draco were filled with anxiety, thinking of the day that was ahead of them.
Ginny was often alone in her common room, but she had managed to make friends with some girls from her year.
He took a deep, long breath, then, his whole body trembling, he got down on one knee.
Hermione nodded. Her breathing gradually slowed down until she regained herself completely.
As she said that, she pointed at the four of them. "Let's begin with the vows, shall we?"
He waved his banner frantically.
"Ew, Harry... isn't it weird that we just left the room so that Hermione and Ron could... use it at their advantage?" Ginny heard him say.
"Yeah, that." Draco chuckled. "And that he's hot." he said, waiting for Harry's reaction.
“James,” Harry says. He thanks her again and starts walking up the road toward Brockley. A
Malfoy looks away. Harry’s uneasiness grows.
Harry dutifully nods at everyone that isn’t rude enough to just stare without saying hello; every single pair of eyes is on them.
“Maybe it is,” Harry says. He says it without thinking, but he doesn’t really know anything, not when Malfoy looks at him like that, says his name—
Harry struggles against the nauseating whirlwind of the Portkey, but there’s nothing to do. All he can think, panic flooding his brain as he looks at Draco’s blurry, struggling form next to him, is that he fucked up. He fucked up big time.
“Ooh, back to last names, are we?”
When Malfoy stands up from the window to go to the bathroom, Chandra looks up from her papers.
Who is this bloke with floppy, loose hair, sitting cross-legged on the stage of a Muggle pub in London? Who is using Malfoy’s body, singing a Muggle song, wearing jeans and a T-shirt with a Muggle rock band logo Harry doesn’t even recognise? What the bloody hell is going on?
Harry frowns. “What? From the loo?” He trudges over to the cubicle and knocks. “Open up.”
And if there’s one thing Harry can’t do, it’s ignorance.
“Is he still in France?”
Harry shrugs. “Maybe. I don’t know. The thing is—the Malfoy I know isn’t a killer. But this Malfoy... I don’t know. He’s changed. And I can’t really put my finger on how he’s changed. I just—I can’t help the feeling that his reaction to this whole situation is odd, like... he knows something. He knows something we don’t.”
It’s not a question; Chandra’s voice is gentle and knowing as she takes in Harry’s expression. The hard edges of her face are softened by sympathy.
He turns back towards Harry when he’s at the door. “Sleep well, Potter.”
As soon as he steadies himself in his living room, he walks over to the kitchen and reaches for a whiskey tumbler on the shelf. One of his shittier ones.
does Draco think he is, looking like the very definition of debauchery in
Malfoy looks up at him from the little ottoman on the stone tile floor, the glow from outside creating dark shadows under his eyes in the lightless cubicle. And Harry thinks, pity spreading from his chest, numbing his elbows and wrists, that he looks so exposed like this, like all his pockets have been turned inside out after carefully hiding his secrets for years. Like he’s suddenly decided to staple his insides to his sleeves.
“Most people are horrified, though. And they are the absolute majority. But regardless of what anyone thinks, this is a serial killer masquerading as a righteous vigilante.”
Chandra rolls her eyes. “You didn’t think you were going to convince Head Auror Robards to greenlight this and then casually walk away and put the responsibility on someone else, surely?”
didn’t.”
Harry’s breath catches. “What?”
Harry hesitates for a second before nodding. All that matters is that Draco is safe. He takes another deep breath and Apparates.
“Anything?” Chandra asks him when he returns to the room. He can see from the corner of his eye that Draco is looking his way too.
“Do you think—” he hesitates, chewing on the cap of his biro, “I mean, would you—how far do you reckon this person would go? Would you put people on this list, say... bureaucrats who were working in the Ministry under Pius? Or people who weren’t Death Eaters or war criminals but... their family members? Or, like, people who were, in a way, coerced into being Death Eaters, because of their family, or... they were underage or something?”
They go out to eat in Muggle London Friday evening. To Harry’s utter bafflement, Malfoy wants to go to a Wetherspoons, of all places. “Are you serious?” “Yes, Potter, quite. What, you take everything else in stride, but won’t accept my love for shitty pub food?”
“I’m sorry, but that looks nasty as hell.”
Harry turns to Draco, pulls his face onto his lap. “Fuck,” he whispers. “
Malfoy comes out just when he’s set the mugs on the table. First, Harry notices that his hair is wet at the nape of his neck. Then he notices that he’s wearing Muggle clothes again.
“I—I just don’t.”
And God, Harry hasn’t even started drinking yet.
He hasn’t even righted himself properly when he hears something that sounds suspiciously like wine glasses being set on the table. Then the sound of a bottle opening.
“I mean... you have tonnes of money, don’t you? What’s with the wardrobe? You look like you’ve been wearing the same clothes since Hogwarts.”
“You okay?” she asks, searching his face. Harry nods.
feels out of place.
He looks at Malfoy, and he feels so awkward, because he knows what he wants to say, suddenly. The urge to say it has descended on him without warning, sneaked into his brain with the whiskey; but he can’t, he doesn’t know how. Not without it feeling overly...
But since the cafeteria incident, he hasn’t once stepped out of Harry’s flat without the glamour. And if Harry should ever exploit his status, it should be to help Malfoy feel a bit more confident, a bit more protected against the harsh reality of a public appearance when people are interested in your life for one reason or another.
his mind echoes.
“I don’t need any,” Malfoy cuts in. “No one knows I live here.”
It’s an understatement to say that he's shocked when Narcissa Malfoy opens the door, almost immediately after he tentatively knocks on it.
“Er... will you take long?”
Harry unfolds the parchment, and his eyes automatically skip to the signature at the bottom. His breath rushes up sharply from the pit of his stomach, catching in his throat.
“About most things, she’s simply just… indifferent. She likes things; she doesn’t love them. When she allows herself to feel something, really feel it, she’ll do everything to keep them, though. And, you know, she ended up loving my father, which—” Malfoy huffs out a breathy laugh, “unfortunate. Because he wanted it all. And she let him have it.”
Out of all the things he could look like on this already difficult morning, he categorically looks like something Harry wants to eat up.
“But he
. As you do when you spend every morning in the same room for six years.
“You have Fleetwood Mac!” Draco exclaims.
There’s a tap at his kitchen window. When Harry looks over, his heart stops. It’s the owl from yesterday. He hurries over to the window and slides it open, reaching for the letter.
Nonsensically, the first thing Harry thinks is that he has forgotten how tall he was. He’s wearing a bathrobe, a forest green one, his hair is sticking up everywhere like he's just woken up, and he’s holding a mug that slips out of his hands when his eyes land on Harry, crashing to the floor.
But he’s also aware of why he hasn’t allowed people like Malfoy to be part of his life for years—why he’s buried them to die under the river of Lethe. Why Hermione always wears long-sleeved shirts when she’s around him. Why Ron subtly mentions to him if Bill is going to be present at lunch at the Burrow. And fuck him if he knows what to do with these two very opposing…
“So... do you still think blondie might have something to do with the case?”
Malfoy looks somewhere next to Harry, then directly at him before settling somewhere above his eyes. “How I take my tea,” he says quietly.
“Your life is in danger,” Harry says. “Some lunatic is going around murdering ex-Death Eaters, and you are not protected here. The Aurors are prepared to offer you safety in Wizarding London—”
"I don't care, I'm still gonna kill him!" Harry shouted, in anger. He was ready to punch him when Draco stopped him.
Hence, Ginny thought it was only a good idea to teach her girlfriend how to fly properly.
"Tell you what, don't say sorry to him first. He's the one who has to come forward." His roommate said.
Ginny's birthday celebration was supposed to be a quiet gathering - Ron and Hermione having a child meant that they couldn't stay up all night or make too much noise.
They were also talking about how disgusted they were by their own behaviour and Jean Jacques'.
Yes, it was definitely possible to love him more than Draco did a minute before.
"Sure, Draco." Said Hermione. The four of them all made their way to the table.
Harry didn't need to hear it twice to approve of this arrangement.
Suddenly, he heard the drapes of his bed rip open. He lay still, eyes widened in terror. What the devil was going on? He didn't dare look behind his back.
On August 10th the six friends had to leave the house to go to France for the European Quidditch Cup, which would have taken place the day after, on Ginny's birthday.
"I will." he said, kissing her on the cheek.
"I don't know what you need to worry about!" he simply said.
Inside of it was a white gold ring which proudly displayed an emerald in its middle.
"I know that, but those were dark times. I am a different person now-" Draco tried to say, but Hermione zipped his mouth shut with a hex.
His trail of thoughts was interrupted by the sound of Harry's light snoring. As he turned his head to look at him, he wondered if there was anything cuter than that in the whole world.
So, it was obvious that something was off with him, at least to those around him. Surely Blaise had informed Pansy of Draco's continuous absence in their dorm, the bastard. There was no chance, though, that they could ever know the truth, unless Granger woke up one day and decided to sing like a bird. No, she wouldn't do this to her best friend, Draco reassured himself.
Pansy gave him the most weirded out look ever. "Um... no... Draco, as we both noticed... there's something in the air. And you were afraid I'd tell-"
Maybe that was why he had invited Ginny over, the 'closest friend' actually meant 'girlfriend' to him, maybe.
"Ginevra, I think the nargles might have made him fall in love with someone. But I don't think it's a girl." Luna murmured.
"Mmm, weird, it won't open... I guess someone is inside." said a soft voice at the other side of the wall. The boys thanked the law of the Room, which prevented anyone from stepping foot inside of it if it were full and they didn't know the reason why.
Oh, God. He had not eaten a pizza in ages. He would only eat it on rare occasions, as the Dursleys weren't really fond of him eating food that he liked. He had missed it.
No one had ever made him laugh so hard, so much to gasp for air and cry his eyes out.
"I took the potion to prove to you how true my feelings for you are." said Draco. "I need you to hear me out."
"I'm starting to think that, maybe, Jean Jacques is not so wrong, after all... he's right to say that you never make an effort." said Draco. He was now on the verge of tears.
Luna took off Ginny's brassiere as well.
"Harry Potter, from the moment that I saw you, I felt a lot of hatred for you, but that only concealed an enormous crush." Draco commenced, his eyes locked to Harry's.
At dinner, when she had seen Ron, she'd had a compulsory urge to yell 'your girlfriend is pregnant!' in his face, but she suppressed it.
Harry had mixed feelings regarding her, though.
"It shows." Draco commented, giving the bottle of veritaserum to him. "As for the punch... don't worry. I would have done the same."
"You think I'm joking because I'm calm? I'm scared shitless, mate!" Ron whined, sitting next to Harry. His face was pale and he kept hyperventilating.
Draco simply shook his head. What a tease.
Draco and Harry were happy to find out that Percy had an urgency at work,  so he had to rush to The Ministry and couldn't stay any longer.
She was Harry's ex and she was telling his husband to be how much he loved him.
He would have missed that school.
Angelina put her hands on her chest, feeling so much affection towards her ex team mate.
Luna and Ginny's studying sessions weren't that easy, as they'd spend most of their time together kissing and being cute.
Luna, Ginny and Ron all exchanged questioning looks.
Blaise gave him a disgusted look in response, but he seemed to be entertained. "So are you. Now, get to work!" He ordered.
His thoughts wandered back to their first kiss ever, under the big tree.
Draco's face whitened and all he could hear was the sound of his racing heartbeat, which was louder than his father's voice.
"But we can't just practise without him! We haven't practised in like a month!" Ginny whined.
It would be a way to observe the woman's behaviour on them being a thing.
She took a hold of it, trying to snatch it from her hands, but her girlfriend wouldn't let her.
"Well, you could make an effort. Ah famous people, always acting superiorre." said the newbie, looking Harry straight in the eye.
"I'm sure that we will be friends forever." Luna mused from inside of the hug.
Draco would be wearing a dark green suit, which symbolised both him having been a Slytherin and his future husband's eye colour.
He turned around to look at her. "Mione, I will murder him. I can't stand him, he's touching all over my boyfriend!"
Her daughter's wedding had turned into a battlefield right before her eyes not many minutes before, it was her right to be completely shaken.
"Wait till you see what the Slytherins have to say, though." Draco said, eying his house mates. He was already starting to feel worried.
After leaving the Slytherin common room, Draco made his way to the top studying spot in all of Hogwarts, under the big tree.
Harry did the thing that his husband always found cute; he pretended to be offended. He gasped loudly, crossing his arms.
Ginny smiled, apparently her mother couldn't stay mad at her for too long.
He had a chance to prove himself, now. It all lay in a special potion.
He simply went to where his friend had been seconds before.
"I'm considering this option."
As he, Harry and the professor made their way to Slughorn's office, Draco felt as if he was heading straight to the pillory. This is what people who are sentenced to death must feel like upon their arrival at the execution site.
The day the students had to take the Hogwarts express to King's Cross, Hermione wanted to make sure that everything was into place, before having her boyfriend and her friends step foot into her house.
"Potter, you can't help ruining families, can you? You're disgusting! Cru-" Lucius was going to cruciate him, but he was unable to, as Professor Slughorn disarmed him. "Mr Malfoy," he said "I have to ask you to leave these premises, now."
"I love you, Draco!" Hermione cried out while holding him.
Luna felt a bit jealous at her girlfriend's almost obsession with that Beater.
"Here you are." She said softly. "Operation starts now."
"Enough!" Hermione yelled, rising from her seat. She ran to where Harry was standing and stood there as well. "I have to ask you to leave my house." she said slowly.
"Oh, she's hot, totally fuckable." He said with a shrug.
Flashes of his good times with Harry infested his brain in a way so vicious that there was nothing in his power that would be able to numb his pain.
Romione in this chap (a bit)
In fact, 1999 New Year's Day was the best day of my life. You are the best girlfriend in the world, when you're not mad at me. I love you to death, your cupcake Lulu."
It didn't take Ron a long time to get ready; Harry, on the other hand, was having a hard time with fixing his hair.
"But guys, come on, don't be this sad. Once out of here, we'll spend the whole summer together at our house!" Ginny whined, pointing at herself and her brother.
And, besides, the Quiberon Quafflepunchers had always been Draco's guilty pleasure.
She also helped her with her hair situation. Luckily, Molly had brought her straightening potion, so it wasn't too much of a nightmare.
As the days went by, the two lovers wouldn't speak to each other, at all.
"It looks cool, doesn't it?" Harry observed with a smile. Draco nodded. The younger boy put his arm around his shoulder and massaged it a little. Draco wasn't used to affection, but he relaxed immediately. He had been stressed all morning because of Pansy and this surely felt nice, so he proceeded to hold the hand on his shoulder. They stood like that for a while, the time it took for the food to appear. When it did the pair went to sit on their poufs. Harry sank too deep into his, so Draco had to help him up. It all ended with a laugh and a 'thank you' kiss.
The couple put their respective rings on each other's finger.
"Hello." He simply said, waving his hand. The Weasley mother walked closer to him and hugged him. "Welcome to the family." She said, leaving Draco at a loss for words.
Given their unfriendliness, they decided it would be more reasonable to stray from those people.
She and Luna hadn't discussed their under-the-mistletoe kiss further, as she wasn't sure what it had actually meant. She had felt the so called 'sparks' kissing her, but did that mean that she was in love with her? Was their friendship turning into something more? Even if she didn't know what that was, that had surely taken her mind off of things for a bit.
Neither of them slept much.
"Whenever I'm suspicious of something, I always happen to be right." Harry snapped.
"I'm sorry." Said Draco, meeting his gaze. "I just wish they weren't so obsessed with traditions and purebloods, you know? Why can't we have a civil relationship? No, we can only hate each other."
Ginny giggled. Her girlfriend was truly a special snowflake, she was so pure and perfect and, well, hers. She was sure, now, that she had found the one.
"But-" Harry tried to argue. "No buts. Get to work or I'll remove more points." Miss Sivan said sternly.
Draco was quick enough to grab his arm. "None of this was a lie! Harry, what you saw was sexual harassment, if anything-"
Ginny gave him a smile and held the hand on her shoulder in response.
"Accio Camera!" Ginny whispered and a camera flew straight in her hands.
"Good afternoon." Said a stern voice.
"Exactly two and a half months ago," she said, grinning excitedly. "You finally saw the light and started dating me, forgetting about the Wrackspurts."
Miss Sivan, who was officiating the unions, cleared her throat.
"Girls..." Hermione began, happy that the Jean Jacques topic had been dropped.
"And we don't want to know, thank you." He said.
"Congratulations, Draco." a female voice came out of the person.
His best friends looked at each other in a knowing look. Hermione shook her head. "They were totally shagging." Ron said in his girlfriend's ear. She nodded. "He didn't sleep in our dorm, this totally confirms it." He added.
"Yeah, that's odd." said Ron, yawning.
Then Hagrid pulled away, not looking at his young friends to avoid getting them entirely wet with his extra large tears.
This prevented a fight. Blaise simply glared at Harry and Draco, then went back to his seat.
"Must be jealous that you're dating someone 'famous'." Pansy suggested.
Hermione noticed Ginny's uneasiness, so she turned to her. "Hey, Gin, it's ok. I'm not mad at you anymore. I can see that you regret what you did. And soon, Harry will come around."
"Oh, me too." his mother replied, looking away from him.
"Take me there." Harry managed to say. His south region was beginning to enjoy Draco's suggestions.
Obviously, the trail of glitter from the door to the table was a must.
Harry couldn't help feeling bad for his boyfriend, who looked like he would faint at any minute.
"Ah ah." Harry said, after noticing that his boyfriend had grabbed his butt. "We have to get changed. And besides, Viridis is watching." he said, pointing to the judging owl in front of them.
"Mum, it's us! Open up!" Ron shouted.
"You're an asshole. I'm perfectly able to tie it myself, thank you very much."
"Ah, well, we still hated each other up to two seconds before." Harry defended himself.
They simply remained seated at the table, watching as Draco and his father fell apart, right in front of them.
"You have no evidence." Pansy angrily spat. "No one will believe you! It sounds absurd, even to me."
After Draco, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff Seventh-years spoke as well, until the last one to speak was Ron.
Oh, damn, Hermione knew of my reaction to Malfoy's thing today... Harry thought.
She then held her skirt up and hurried out of sight.
One by one, all the attendants were woken up and set free from the petrification.
"I thought you'd get this, out of all people! You're supposed to be my best friend! And it's not like we're dating or anything." Harry said. Was it really so hard to understand that he was just exploring?
Luna's mistletoe was yet another way of reminding the redhead of their kiss, but, still, she wouldn't acknowledge it.
Harry looked at him with widened eyes. "Are you serious? You're, like, the only one who truly finds it appealing!"
Draco had not said a word up to this point.
Draco had to put up a fake smile, as he watched his boyfriend prepare himself for their double date. "Ok, shoot. What's wrong?" Asked Harry, all while putting on cologne.
"Don't do anything, Herrmione." the blonde girl whispered. "No need. You will see, we've got zis underr contrrol."
"Ugh, I really want to end that prick."
She had noticed that, ever since Christmas, the two girls seemed more... United than they had been before.
"And you couldn't resist, huh? Tell you what, meet me at the Room of Requirement tonight at 10 o' clock... I can show you incredible things. But no one must know, or you're dead."
Due to the fact that Hermione was with child the three couples had to get there the muggle way, which was by airplane.
"Hogwarts, what could I say..." he started, unscripted. "I used to hate you. I didn't like your ideals or your methods, but it was only me following my dad's doctrine. In this last year, you became my family. " He looked over to Harry when he said that.
She was very happy that her favourite people in the world were discovering her way of living - and liked it greatly.
"You're just a sore loser, Malfoy." said Ron, giving Harry five.
That next weekend, at Hogsmeade, Luna and Ginny had gone to Madam Puddifoot, as the Three Broomsticks wasn't the most favorable place for her.
"Potter!" Draco's voice called.
"None of this would have happened if you had slept in my room, for a change." Draco snapped.
"Go, babe!" Harry shouted from his seat.
"I l-love y-you." Pansy said in a hiccup of sobs. "And I-I u-understand that... we will never b-be t-togeth-her."
He took his boyfriend's hand and forced him to walk towards the middle of the room.
Weird, Luna wasn't talking about kissing Ginny. Maybe Luna, in her own little world, didn't know much about mistletoes and had only seen them as "Nargle hives".
"So, I was thinking, I could organise your big day, dears." she gushed. "You don't want to use an old tux, Draco. We need to find you something... incredible looking."
"Oh so you didn't digest yesterday's meatloaf? I'll admit it was too salty..." the blonde babbled.
And there they stood. Kissing, in the Great Hall.
Arthur, Molly and Ginny were all in her office to discuss what Ginny had done the day before.
"Draco, you would let these men incarcerate your own mother? Please, tell them I just wanted to look out for you!" Mrs Malfoy pleaded, sounding desperate.
"Oh come on, Arthur! He's Harry's boyfriend, he wanted to spend-" Molly began, but her husband cut her off.
Harry wasn't able to contain himself anymore, so he rose to his feet and went to stand next to his boyfriend.
"Well, Merry Christmas everyone!" Arthur said, happily. "Hope you behaved!" He chuckled, but his happiness was cut short when he noticed that Draco, Lucius' son, was standing right in the middle of his house.
Draco raised an eyebrow. When Harry was convinced on something, he wouldn't stop until he got what he wanted. But he was starting to abuse this power he possessed.
"Um..." Draco began, but wasn't sure of what to say after that.
"Quit the gay shit!" Blaise shouted from his seat.
"I'm trying! But you keep stomping on my foot!" Ron whined.
"Everyone knows now, so what? If any of them says something to you, I will make sure to deal with it. I promise you." Harry reassured him. "As long as you love me, I don't care what the world might say. I don't care if it will be the two of us against it. They can't touch us." This said, the black haired boy pressed his lips against his lover's, right there, in front of everyone.
Lucius put his wand down, glaring at Harry and his son."Draco, if you ever decide to come home, I swear to you I will kill you." he said, then he left.
Hannah looked like she had been told a fairytale. She was a hopeless romantic.
"Beg me." Harry growled, pulling his fingers in an out of Draco. "Oh please, please! I need you inside me!" Draco moaned.
Harry's proposal to Draco had played a part in his decision.
"Come on, shut up and dance!" Draco intervened. "Let's show them how it's done!"
"Morning, dears! Merry Christmas!" said a singing Molly as Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Ginny and Luna descended the stairs, looking very sleepy. "The journey to London killed you, eh? But no worry, the lunch Fleur and I prepared is enough to wake you up." Then she trotted to the kitchen.
Harry and Draco had not really had one of those, as they thought they were too mundane.
Note that I'm posting these chapters one after the other upon importing this story from other sites (like wattpad)
"Slept well?" asked Hermione.
"This is so ethically wrong! I wonder how you will be able to sleep at night, after this disgrace!" Draco yelled, acting like he was outraged, then the chase began.
Had they crossed paths again, he would have probably destroyed her. And he didn't want to hurt a girl like that.
"What? Fill me in, babe!" Ron said, confused.
"Stop seeing evil schemes everywhere, babe! That is my mother, she has her own sense of humour." he whined.
He had to be a very apathetic person to create such a strain in a relationship and then leave to watch things unravel from a distance.
But the scolding never came. "Look, Harry," Hermione began, "I made a mistake. I was wrong and selfish. I should have accepted it from the beginning. I'm really sorry for what I called you and for how I acted... I shouldn't have made it about me. I mean, it's your life, Harry..."she smiled when she saw that Harry and Draco were holding hands, that meant they were a couple now. "I love you, Harry, and I want you to know that, even if I'm not so thrilled about this... I'm still happy for you. All that matters to me is your happiness." As she said the last line, Harry noticed that his friend's eyes were beginning to water. She had finally seen the light and he couldn't help smiling about it. He pulled her into a tight hug and as he did so he realized how much he'd missed Hermione's hugs. She hugged back just as tightly, burying her face into his neck. "I'm sorry too, Mione... I should have known you would have reacted like this."
As Harry kissed his girlfriend he didn't feel the "sparks." Yes, she was hot and he loved her, but it just... didn't feel right sometimes. Or all the time, for that matter. He could have been kissing another girl and the feeling would have been the same.
"Me little midgets growin' up so much!"Hagrid's enormous tears almost flooded his seat.
"Oh, look who's at the Slytherenne table! Dracou! What brings you here? Fight wiz Potter?" came Jean Jaques' voice.
"Harry, you hurt me," Draco began. "You told me all those things, then you completely ignored me for days, simply out of pride."
"That your grandma doesn't know that you're a witch, therefore we have to prevent strange things from happening." said Ron, reciting it like a line for theatrical purposes. He rolled his eyes after he finished.
Draco was curious to see what a muggle house looked like as he had never seen one.
"Ginevra, what the hell did you just do?" Harry cried out. His face was becoming red in anger and the vein on his neck was beginning to throb.
"I do." said Ron.
"Wow, a strange fella." Harry said, tittering.
It brought the newly engaged back to their first date, since the place was decorated with Gryffindor and Slytherin flags, although it was also peppered with banners saying 'Congratulations Harry and Draco'.
So, this meant that he would have to stay at Hogwarts.
He couldn't sleep much as what had happened hours before was running through his mind. Everyone had found out about him and Harry and he had found himself caught in the crossfire of the Slytherins' rage.
She was definitely teasing her, now. Ginny couldn't help staring at her cleavage.
Their talk had been fine, up to that moment.
They were that close now.
This was it, Ginny was about to lose her virginity. Now, she knew why she had never been intimate with any of her boyfriends. They just didn't have this effect on her.
But he didn't want to chicken out. It wasn't in his blood to run away from things.
At this point, there was nothing more that he could do. He had tried so hard to reason with his dad, but, apparently, his hateful views were significantly more important than his father instincts.
Everyone watched as they greeted each other with a weird secret handshake, which ended in the father flying his daughter in the air.
Neville nodded, then he grabbed his friend's hand, as he helped him up.
"Dracou, look, I wanted to apologise for ze other day. I just thought you'd be ok with zis.
Once in Paris, the couples were split in two groups, so that they could get ready.
They didn't sit close to one another. Blaise looked at Draco quizzically and the blonde boy simply shook his head. Harry didn't go sit with Ron and Hermione, he sat next to Neville.
"The curtain is down, now. Hope you're happy now. You have completely ruined me! Why didn't I just leave you to die in the Fyendfire?" Harry spat, then he disappeared from sight.
"What is he doing here? Take him away before I-" Harry tried to say.
Suddenly, the fire crackled and her lips curved into a wide smile as she saw her interlocutor, the shadow of the flames reflected on her face.
The barman and the customers all screamed and tried to chase it out of the room, but it wouldn't do it before delivering mail to the rightful recipient.
Ginny had to fight the urge to grab her and kiss her.
Both girls were finally relieved that they were fine and that the nightmare was put to an end before anyone got seriously hurt.
Harry James Potter had just asked the fateful question.
Harry didn't really care, though. Hell, he had defeated Lord Voldemort only months before. Certainly, a few angry Slytherins couldn't hurt him.
The guy was starting to seem weird to Draco, how did he know that?
"I can't see your name on it." Luna reasoned in her dreamy voice.
"Dirty abominations", he would call them.
"I doubt this will be better than the marvelous gift you received from Luna, but we, your friends, got you something very special." Said Harry, grinning and nodding at his husband.
The Gryffindor common room was much warmer, not only for its location and its fire, which was always on, but also for the presence of his boyfriend.
Surprisingly, Blaise and Pansy bought it. "Yeah, you tell him Draco! Why don't you get lost, Potter?" said Blaise.
Not much later, Harry fell, thus dragging his boyfriend along with him, who fell on top of him.
Ginny gave a sigh of frustration. Why was her brother always the last one to be ready?
Minutes later, the two of them were walking around Hogwarts grounds, hand in hand, determined to find their friends to tell them the news.
He didn't feel like leaving Harry in his mother's grasp without him, anyway.
"WHAT?" Ron almost shouted. A few heads turned to see what had just happened, but then went back to their businesses when they didn't see anything weird. Ron blushed at the attention he had just received. Hermione elbowed her boyfriend in the ribs. "Well this is quite a bit for us to process, Harry." Hermione said, glaring at a now wincing Ron.
"Ah well, I only did it so I'd get your attention... Always been a sucker for that." Draco said with a grin.
"Wow, that sounds awesome."said Ginny, playing along.
Oh, the Malfoys and their fondness for appearances.
"But it doesn't have my touch." Draco teased.
Everyone, especially the girls, gathered around Draco to look at his ring.
The last thing I was missing was a name. I thought of the most French name there was and I chose Jean Jacques. It sounded perfect.
"What are you implying?" asked Harry, sitting up.
"The Great Hall!" The four of them said in unison.
His forgiving abilities were uncanny, Draco observed. His husband to be was usually mistrustful, but, if he valued a person worthy of forgiveness, even if they had done the worst thing one can imagine, he would give it to them.
There was a moment of silence. Then, the girlfriends looked at each other. Luna whispered something in Ginny's hair, all while the others waited impatiently.
Their four friends cheered for the two of them as they both ran through the field, all while laughing hysterically.
Both boys gave her a loving look.
Ginny emitted a soft moan of pleasure, Luna knew just what she liked, it seemed.
Arthur cleared his throat. "I'd like to make a toast." He shouted, capturing everyone's attention.
"We were just discussing Christmas." said Draco, after letting go of Ron's hand.
"Harry, he didn't cheat on you! Look, he's on veritaserum!" Hermione interrupted him, pointing at the small bottle in Ron's hand.
"She means an item, babe!" Luna pointed out, impatient.
Luna's dress was blue and it featured a deep v-neck, its top was sequin-covered and the bottom was a tulle skirt, which was almost as long as the one on the red dress, but its effect made it larger and, to Luna, it made her look like a princess.
"Good on you, Potter." he spat. "What you're saying doesn't make any sense. Do you want me to kiss your feet because you invited me at the Weasleys for your own convenience? It's not like you offered to stay here with me. Because your little fake mummy would have taken offence. Cause who cares if sodding Malfoy gets offended, right?" He was now breathing heavily and crying out of frustration. "It's not like I am your boyfriend, or anything."
"I can't say them out loud..." Draco murmured.
Hugo's small ears were protected by a spell, so that the noise wouldn't harm him.
If Blaise had been drinking, he would have spat the liquid out of his mouth "What? Weasley? I don't understand your.. tastes! If you liked Potter, that would be the craziest thing ever." He laughed out loud. Oh how wrong are you, my friend, Draco thought.
"Don't have to tell me twice!" Harry said as he walked away. He managed to wink at Draco and mouth him a 'see you later' .
Their eyes were darkened with lust, their breaths quivering in anticipation.
Time to play, Draco thought. He walked even closer to him so that he was in his face.
"Oh, no, she's got a bun in the oven!" Luna tittered excitedly, earning a look of a thousand deaths.
"Don't speak to me, Ginny." Harry said in a dry tone.
If Hogwarts had only taught potions he would have been the happiest wizard on the planet. His eyes fixated back on the couple, who was now engaging in a full on make out session. This made him feel so, so jealous, though he hated to admit it, even to himself.
Draco was sitting under the tree in the Hogwarts courtyard. It was his favorite spot to study, he found it so relaxing. But that day in November he wasn't too focused on his transfiguration book, in fact, something else had captured his attention: Potter.
Not far from her was a fireplace. She walked closer to it and squatted down.
She started singing, too, but she was unable stay in tune as her laughing prevented it.
The four friends all looked at each other, trying to suppress a laugh.
"So did you." Draco said, crossing his arms and raising an eyebrow.
Draco took a bow, then he sped towards where his fiancè was standing.
“We can get it on the black market,” Draco suggested and then timidly added that he had contacts. “Might take me a couple of days but it’ll be better then waiting a month for it.”
“Yes. Luckily we now live in a word where it’s ok for same-sex couples to have children. We would have to adopt or use a surrogate though but that’s not a big deal.”
He had come to appreciate his life after Hogwarts. His father had been, thankfully, sent to Azkaban freeing Draco and his mom from his grasp. His mom had never really been the same after the war. She was more like a shell of what she used to be, never quite able to find happiness. Draco stayed isolated with her in the manor until she passed only a short three years after the war. The healers had said it had been something wrong with her heart. Draco wasted no time selling the manor after that. The memories it held of what had transpired there during the war needed to be left behind.
Harry was tearing up as Draco came in for one last kiss. Without any further words, Draco obliviated him. He then turned to Hermione who also looked like she was trying to keep it together.
“I’m sorry I can’t go get it myself. It sounds like you’ve had a long day.” Draco did feel kind of useless being stuck inside all day.
Draco shrugged. “What part of my looks are you more attracted to?” he asked wanting to put back some levity in the moment.
“Blimey Harry, this must be important. There’s always time for tea!” Ron left the room to go get the precious liquid.
“I’m so sorry! I should have asked if it was ok or given you a warning.”
“Do you mind that I’m bi?” Harry hesitated to ask.
“That is pretty twisted.”
Harry didn’t respond.
“I’m worried are relationship will change if we’re romantically involved.”
Draco scrunched the note in his hand. Leave it to Potter to be sassy in a note.
They went into the den where Harry’s liquor cabinet was. Harry took off his auror robes and threw them on the sofa.
“Is this about Draco?” Hermione asked. Harry’s mouth fell open. How could she know?
“Well first they don’t go into the future,” Draco said as he pulled out some tomatoes from the fridge. “Second, the last Time-Turner known to the Ministry disappeared from the vaults years ago.”
“I know that we’ve all worked really hard to get me back to my time. Is it ok if I have one more night here?”
The motion felt wrong. Too tight. The colour of the flames seemed off. It felt like his skin was being pricked all over.
“Not important right now.” Draco went back in for another kiss but Harry stopped him by gently placing his hands on this chest.
“Draco,” Harry started but Draco stopped him.
“I’m happy you haven’t been caught and arrested,” Draco reached out his hand to take Harry’s. Hermione knew now so there was no point in hiding it.
“We better call it a night,” Harry finally suggested. “We have work tomorrow.” Draco nodded in agreement.
“Yeah and altered the time line.” Harry sat down. “How’s the forgery going?”
Right. Harry had forgotten about that decision of theirs to erase his memory of Draco’s visit. Well this sucked.
“It’s late. I’m going to bed. I’m assuming I’m allowed to sleep in the room I woke up in?”
“Who’s-? My partner at the office.”
“Of course, I want to be with him. That’s all I’ve ever wanted for years but this might change things between us. What if we stop our banter and he gets bored with me? What if he only liked me because of our back and forth and without them the excitement dies?” Harry clutched his head in his hands and started rocking himself. Draco was going to leave him. He knew it. He could feel it deep in his bones.
“You know I’ve always hated your bravery,” Draco said while looking at the amber liquid in his glass.
“I just need a moment,” Draco stated as he went back upstairs alone.
“Draco…not sure what is happening but I think you should know that I’m seeing someone.”
Harry greeted him with a kiss. Draco asked for tea which he was denied saying they had no time to waste!
-_-_-_-_-
“Malfoy?” he called as he entered Grimmauld place.
Draco pursed his lips remembering that, yes, Harry Potter was dead. He had watched as his body had been thrown across the room and hit a cement wall with a particular crunch. He shook his head to clear his thoughts from the memory. He returned his attention to the book and read. The chapter was actually, and thankfully, quite detailed. Stating the rules and explaining why exactly one should abide by them.
If he thought about it, he would have guessed that he had been invited to the private saying of good bye because, over the years, he had become friends with the people currently surrounding him. He had even been invited to some of the Weasley’s Sunday dinners…mainly because Mrs. Weasley once found out that he eats alone at home 98% of his nights and this just hadn’t been acceptable. So yeah, Draco had entered the group of friends that surrounded Harry Potter.
“What happened?” Draco was rather confused.
“What about the Weasley’s? Don’t you think they’ve become family?” Hermione hated having to go through with this but she didn’t feel Harry had gone far enough.
“Well it’s not like you haven’t gone through trauma,” Hermione pointed out.
“You died.” A tear escaped.
“Well what if I don’t tell her what it’s for?”
“Yes, but those witches and wizards left research which you can look into, piece it all together and then figure it out?”
“No,” Harry breathed. “I don’t want to forget it. I want to do it again but this time I want to actually participate.”
Shit. He had completely forgotten about his mark. He tried to hide it under the blanket.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know why you’re making fun of me when you’ve already been through this.”
Draco breathed in. “There you go being brave again.” This didn’t stop him from getting up anyways. He stood in front of Harry and licked his lips. This was probably a bad idea.
-_-_-_-_-_-
“I’m sorry! I’m really happy for you two. Draco, we have become friends over the years so you will have to allow me a certain number of jokes about this.”
“Maybe…” Draco whispered.
“I didn’t use a time turner.” Draco held his hand out in a motion to tell Harry to stay quiet. “Yes, I know, there is no known way of time travelling without a time turner. I’m not a first year you know. We need to go to the Ministry, maybe talk to someone in the Department of Magical Anomalies…or even that boring research department.”
Harry returned home after work holding Indian take-away in one hand and a leather book back hooked around his other arm.
“Can’t you trust that his love for you is the same?”
“Fine. With a man or a woman?” Harry asked a little shyly.
“No. My love for him goes deeper than that.”
Draco stayed silent.
“You died.”
The second keeper was a witch just a little younger than Harry. She had clear skin and jet black hair. She reminded Harry a bit of the muggle fairy tale Snow White. Without looking up from her desk, she extended her hand for the paper. Harry handed it to her and she looked at it quickly to see which object was requested. As the second keeper her job wasn’t to vet the papers, that’s what Cho was for. All the information she needed from it was the title of the item.
He threw on his one outfit and went to the bathroom. He found a tube of toothpaste and used his finger to brush his teeth.
Harry smiled. He had no idea what brought this on but didn’t feel much like arguing at the moment. One thing nagged at his mind though.
“I do like research,” she stated as a matter of fact.
“How daft are you? Isn’t it obvious that her mother may have actually died and this witch may have actually gone back in time and saved her? Causing her to go mad with the memory of her mom dying conflicting with the new memory of her mom being saved?”
Draco made love to Harry knowing that, once he found a way back, he would never see him again. It was intense and filled with unspoken emotion.
Thanks to everyone leaving comments and kudos ^_^
“Hi Cho,” Harry spoke casually.
“We could also…” Hermione hesitated. “Oh, I don’t like this at all Harry!”
“I have to be honest…I don’t really do the dating thing a lot…don’t get me wrong I have hook ups, I’m no saint! But relationships, I haven’t really been lucky in that field. I’ve only been in two that could be considered sort of long term.” Draco wasn’t sure why he was admitting this.
Harry nodded. He understood but felt the need to go through this.
Draco turned around and looked at Harry as if he had three heads. “Harry, witches and wizards way smarter than us have tried to make Time-Turners go forward for years and never succeeded.”
Harry remembered Buckbeak.
“Is it true that you’re afraid of dying alone?”
“Hey mate,” Longbottom greeted him, “How are you holding up?”
“How?”
They owled Hermione after breakfast thinking it would be a little slower than using the floo network, thus giving them more time alone.
“See! There you go being brave.”
Draco was once again pulled from his thoughts. This time by a cup of tea flying into a wall and smashing into pieces. He sluggishly inspected the seen and found that Ron had thrown it.
“You’re welcome. Come back any time!” She smiled while blushing once again.
“I wish I could go to the you of my now. I don’t like knowing you spend six more years hating yourself, thinking you’re not good enough and that you have to hide.”
“Um, yes…hi. I don’t believe we’ve ever met.”
Draco got up as well, intrigued in the answer. He had been so wrapped up in comforting Harry that he had forgotten what they were doing.
With a punch to the heart he remembered attending Harry Potter’s funeral.
“This is my only chance to be with you. I’m sure.”
“We???” Ron asked curiously.
“Yes, Harry. I want to kiss you. A lot. I like you. A lot. I’ve wasted too much time keeping my distance from you and if you think you feel the same way about me, I think we should kiss some more.”
When the world settled down again, Draco tried to catch his breath. He found himself chocking on air. Everything felt wrong. His skin was on fire. The worst was his head. It felt like it was about to shatter into a thousand pieces.
“Um…my place. You drunkenly showed up last night.” Harry kept smiling as if this was amazingly and simply amusing to him.
“Malfoy, you can’t leave this house because we can’t have you cross your younger self.”
-_-_-_-_-
Draco nuzzled his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Can I just stay here forever?”
Draco let him inside so Harry could disapparate without being seen. Once the man had disappeared Draco took a seat on his couch. Ok. This was happening. This was good. What if he messed this up? No. No negative thoughts. He bounced his knee up and down until he couldn’t take sitting still anymore and got up to pace.
“Josh?” Draco rolled his eyes dramatically. “What a boring name.”
He appeared in a country field with cows munching on some grass. Draco looked up at the sky and took a moment to compose himself. H turned the item around his neck. The world started spinning.
“It has a chapter on itemless time travel,” Harry explained as he put a plate down in front of Draco.
“Wow Draco, this looks amazing!”
He casually strolled out of the ministry, politely saying hello to witches and wizards he passed. Once he was finally at the floo stations he went straight home.
That’s until they were in the thick of things. Until he was asked to identify him. An act he couldn’t do knowing it would lead to the boy’s death. Throwing Harry his wand during the battle was just the right thing to do. Fuck the fear of dying.
“Draco, if we’re going to do this, I want to do it right.”
“What do you mean real feelings?”
Draco put down his glass on the small table between them. “What are we doing?”
“Nervous.”
“Yeah.”
“What? Really? Well it’s still there now.”
“That’s the thing, I’ve done some research and unfortunately I agree with the two of you.” Hermione looked distraught which was nothing in comparison to how Draco squirmed in his chair.
“There’s nothing much to tell. One relationship lasted 7 months and the next one was about a year. They both ended because the guys were way too into…well…” Draco gestured towards his arm that bared the dark mark under his shirt.
He remembered going home and getting proper smashed.
There was a knock at the door.
“Draco you’re a genius!”
Very early Saturday morning, Draco used the floo to get to Harry’s. He had been refusing staying over even though Harry assured him it was only to cuddle. Draco just didn’t have the emotional strength right now to go through the whole mutilated mark conversation.
“Deep dark secret number one.” Harry laughed as he got up.
“Draco?” He heard his name called out.
-_-_-_-
“I’m so right aren’t I!” It was Draco’s turn to laugh. He reached over Harry and grabbed his cup for a sip of tea.
“WHAT!” Hermione looked between the two of them waiting for further explanation.
Hermione shook her head. “Witches and wizards who spent years studying time travel couldn’t do it. You’re mad thinking I can!”
“No one laced my drink because I was alone in my flat, after your funeral.”
Draco grabbed some onions and garlic. “Maybe we were the ones that stole it! Found a way to make it move forward and sent me back,” he mused.
“Fine.”
Draco took a very quick shower and with the flick of his wand he removed the stench from his clothes.
“Malfoy I can’t do anything from here. At work I have access to books and can do some research on time travelling. I’ll be back with take-away for dinner and any information I can find.”
Harry and Draco sat down together on the navy loveseat. Hermione took place in a cozy purple armchair. Ron came holding tea pot with four tea cups floating behind him. With some tea and once everyone settled Draco and Harry gave each other a look before Draco started telling his story.
“Oh good morning Harry. Bit early isn’t it?”
“I’m going to leave you two alone together. I’m sure you have a lot to talk about.”
“Yes,” Harry admitted shyly.
He used the floo to get home. Once inside his dingy flat he went straight for the Firewhiskey and took a sip from the bottle, bypassing using a glass. He fell to the ground and cried openly. Why couldn’t he have just found the courage to tell Harry how he felt when he still had the chance. Even if it was just to know if there was any chance Harry felt the same way.
“You git, you locked your floo!”
“Hermione please don’t push it. This is hard enough as it is. Our main focus has to be to get Draco back intact.”
“Harry, you said this was important, life or death! What’s going on? Draco? What are you doing here?”
“No, you’re partner is Tolkster.”
Went to work. Can’t really let people fall into comas just because you found your way trapped into the past. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. Don’t go outside.
Draco’s mouth fell open. “Potter, the bumbling idiot Tolkster was briefly my partner 6 years ago.”
The two men embraced again, kissing the way one can only do when they know they have to say good bye. Draco got up and extended his hand to take Harry’s. Harry took it, getting up from his chair. He was led to his bedroom where the door was delicately closed behind them. Draco started the kiss up again while undressing Harry. He pushed the now naked wizard to lie on the bed while he undressed himself. The passion that ensued was bursting with a desire that could never be expressed again.
“Altering the death of a human is strictly forbidden,” Draco continued. He put the book down and rubbed his temples.
“This all depends on you being the brilliant witch I know you are,” Draco said, trying to remain optimistic.
Once home, he locked his floo to any incoming visitors and went straight to his bedroom where he faceplanted on his bed. He tried telling himself that it was ok. That, at least, Harry was still alive. He knew that at one time he was loved. That was enough right? It had to be enough. Draco crawled beneath the blankets and pulled the cover over his head, willing the world to go away. He refused to cry. Refused. The tears coming out were completely irrelevant. Really.
“Will you stop cutting me off like that! Apparently, I die in six years and apparently, I die not knowing whatever you mean by what your real feelings are towards me. That means I go six years thinking that you only tolerate me. What if I promise to continue acting like you only tolerate me with the present you…well past you…the you in my present.”
“There’s no magical way to get rid of it…thought maybe by force I could remove it…didn’t work.”
Draco hid his head in his hands while Harry looked all too amused.
“So if this doesn’t work, we’re back to square one,” Harry surmised gently squeezing Draco’s hand.
“Of course it is! I want us to be on equal grounds.”
“What happened?”
Having nothing to wear to bed at this particular moment, he locked the door hoping that if Harry, for any reason, tried to open it he would get the hint to knock first and give Draco time to cover himself up. They really needed to figure this out soon.
Tears were now actively rolling down Harry’s cheeks.
“What do you mean real feelings?” Harry repeated. “And I like you. We’re friends.”
Harry laughed. “Ok, slow it down there! Can I know what has brought this on?”
“Me? I did nothing wrong! I was minding my own business prepping some tea when current you showed up and I didn’t know how to act cause all I could think of was kissing you so I got all clumsy and spilled my damn tea. You then felt like declaring that I really needed to learn to use my hands. You said I wasn’t able to do so in first year when I almost swallowed the snitch and clearly still hadn’t figured out how hands work to this day. Arse.”
“Are you going to just repeat my questions to me the entire day? You should be a bit more original but ok. Theodore Nott.” Draco didn’t wait for Harry to comment before asking his next question. “Who was your first crush?”
“Yes, of course,” Hermione took a step back waiting for the men to go through.
The Boy Who Lived, lived no more.
He opened the book bag that looked like it could contain two, three books max. Of course, this was no ordinary bag. He took out seven rather large books from it. Thank Merlin for magic!
“I want to cook for you,” Draco declared as they had finally crawled out of bed, took a joint shower and made their way to the kitchen for some much needed food. He was wearing a pair of Gryffindor pj bottoms which he had made Harry swear on everyone’s life that he would never tell a soul about. Harry had refused to lend him a shirt to accompany the pants stating that abs like those were meant to be seen.
“Maybe I just like seeing that sexy smirk you do when you’re up to no good,” Harry proposed, trying to lighten the mood.
Harry and Draco exchanged a look not knowing where to start. “Maybe we should sit down,” Harry proposed.
“You’re the master of death?” Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. “That is so hot!” Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s.
“No!” Draco panicked. “No, don’t take this away from me, please!”
Outside of Time-Turners, there are records of muggles also trying to time travel using lavish machines and what they call technology. It would appear that someone named H. G. Wells wrote an extensive account of a time traveller using one of these machines. Upon further research, I have found that muggles do not seem to take this account as real and it is an absolute waste of time to look further into it. Clearly if wizards who naturally have a superior intellect to muggles can’t figure out more than one way to time travel, muggles aren’t going to do it.
“Harry I need to you to pay attention to my breathing.”
“Look Potter, I’m not sure I should tell you anything. Not until we can figure out the rules of time travel and how it can affect the time line.” This was unfortunately very logical. Draco pointed his wand at the books on the table. “Rules of time travel.”
“Would she honestly blindly help you break one of the strictest laws without knowing why? Even if she knew it was to help me, she probably wouldn’t do it.”
“I’ve found a few spells that could alter the Time-Turner. I think if I combine some of them, I might be able to make it go far into the future. The problem is, we won’t be able to test it. Everyone who has tried it has gotten caught because the magical signature caused by the Time-Turner going forward alerts the Department of Improper Use of Magic and they come swooping in to make an arrest.”
-_-_-_-_-
“Well we gotta do something!”
“New assigned for you two,” their boss instructed them. “This turned up yesterday. Seems to be the one that went missing from the vaults years ago, but it’s not working anymore.”
Harry’s smile faded. “Ok now I’m getting worried. Should we be bringing you to St Mungo’s?”
“It’s not important. Like you said you died and I rather not go back with confirmation that the saviour of the wizarding world could have never liked me. Hurts my head to just think about it.” Faced with the option, Draco decided it was best to go back still not knowing what would have happened if he had been brave enough to ask Harry out. Not knowing was better than having your heart crushed.
“So…you want to kiss me?”
“He’s a muggle. I’ll have to apparate near his house. I’ll try not to take too much time. We haven’t been together for that long so I don’t see it being complicated.”
“Not really,” she answered honestly. “But I have Ron to comfort me.” With that she took her leave.
“Yup. First ever kiss was with Pansy and that just solidified it for me. Homosexual through and through.”
After the war things had been awkward as expected but the animosity seemed to have dissolved itself. They had been through too much pain to hold on to petty school rivalries.
He put the kettle on, not hungry for any breakfast but up for a cuppa. Once it was ready, he settled himself at the table and grabbed a book. Not really interested in Agnes Wonkerbats’ life stories he grabbed  Theories of poppycock magic. He looked at the index and found the chapter on itemless time travel.
Draco Malfoy promptly passed out.
“You can be there if you want.”
“Yes?” Cho didn’t look at the parchment and just placed it down on her desk.
“Yes.”
He stepped out into the room, almost empty bottle of alcohol still in his hand.
Draco’s partner picked it up, looking it over.
“I need to break up with Josh.”
Hermione watched silently, hating her part in what had just happened.
“Do you want to have lunch together?” the blonde asked.
Draco blinked. He definitely had a headache which was making it hard to understand what Harry was rambling about.
Draco shifted causing Harry to get off him. They sat side by side as Draco tried to decide what he should say. “You have to promise not to have me committed.”
“Draco, I love you too.”
“Well, it’s not like we can do anything and thinking about it might drive ME mad,” Harry all but yelled.
When he went down to the living room, no one was in sight. He found his way to the kitchen where a note was sitting on the table.
“Fine. Island with no magic.” Draco gave it a thought. “You know, it’s occurring to me that I rely on magic a lot. I have no idea how I would survive in a muggle world. Are you an option? Can it be me and you on the island? That would be ok I guess.”
-_-_-_-_-
“I have a theory that emotional torture could work instead of physical torture, but I don’t want to put you threw that. You would have to deal with past trauma and deep fears or insecurities.” Hermione bit her lip, she did not like this idea.
Draco blushed worried that Harry might be feeling a bit violated. “I’m sorry. Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. Maybe I should have stopped anything from happening back then. It wasn’t fair on you.”
