nightmares to start stalking him again.
Quite a few of students have turned to Harry for his support in this matter as well. Incidentally, much to his chagrin, Harry’s word (and opinions too) carry a huge sway with the magical population, and as such, is frequently dragged into settling conflicts whether he liked it or not.
Although, their situations differ immensely from each other, Harry could not help but grieve on Icarus behalf thinking about how heartbroken the guy must have been to silently bear witness, as the person he loves slipped through his fingers and settled with someone else. He wants to immediately apologize for dredging up any smarting memories but thinks better of it.
The one thing he can still count on with absolute certainty is Draco Malfoy’s indifference to Harry’s ever-rising fame and new-found authority supported by the world at large. At least, he isn’t tripping over himself, trying to get into Harry’s good graces or worshipping the ground he walks on, as though Harry truly is their saviour.
It sucks and Draco is so fucking sick of it.
Icarus has always adamantly denied in giving his exact standpoint but maybe he will make an exception, this one time?
After briefly thanking Harry for returning his wand and speaking in favor of his mother and him, the usually snarky and infuriating blond maintained a radio silence upon returning to school.
Obviously, enclosing anything else would be a dead-giveaway to his identity, so Draco only added the textbook, leaving Lily Potter’s photographs and some personal letters behind. He just wanted to gift Potter something that stands apart from his tons of fawning fans, never even imagining in his wildest dreams of getting a reply back.
“Neither, both? I don’t know. Can I ask a question though please? And have an honest answer?”
“Can I- can I see him?” Harry nodded, brushing tears away as he pulls out the photograph he always carried with him and handed it over.
“Even though she’s a ‘mud blood’?”
He spent the rest of his freedom-time Harry spent it being outside, both in the wizrading world and muggle London. Exploring, shopping. He bought an entire new wardrobe for himself, both of muggle and wizard clothes, bought enough books (again, both muggle and magical) to fill a library, and stored all of them in a huge, undetectable extended chest.
onslaught of red hair in his vision as George, Molly, Arthur, Charlie, Bill, and Ron came into the living room. He also saw Hermione appear, holding Ron’s hand.
“Don’t you ‘hi’ me young man. Missing with no visual contact for over a year and you suddenly show up, not just with a bad, but
“Yes?”
“Is that a question or a statement?” Malfoy demanded.
Harry’s mouth came off with a wet pop and he panted for a minute to catch his breath before staring up at his former nemesis. Draco was staring at him with half lidded eyes, and spent cock already filling again. Now how did Draco want to do this? Against the wall, the floor, a transfigured bed? Facing each other for arse up?
She dispelled the privacy ward and the pair made their way over to the red-heads. Currently George was holding Anton like he was the most precious and delicate thing in the world. Well, he was a baby.
He also had regular check up-s with Poppy, who was the only person he felt comfortable with knowing about his situation. She was also the only one who knew where he was staying, and she always had to come to him, and would have to perform the home-birth too.
Draco looked him right in the eye as he responded.
Stomach, arse, and skin were drenched in the sticky white fluid. An image of truly sexually used.
The blond and the black-haired boys were drunk when they met up, and so, were drunk when they went home.
Eventually June 10 rolled around, and Harry was awoken to extreme pains in his lower region. Working that something was wrong, Harry called Creature and asked him to fetch Poppy. The witch came in ten minutes later, and immediately realised what was happening.
“Alright, Mr. Potter. Your child has decided it has had enough and is trying to tell the body to let it out. However, as you do not have the right opening available for it to come out of, you are feeling the pain instead. I’ll have to perform a caesarian right now.”
Harry also came to a mortifying realisation. He was remembering their interactions in fourth, fifth and sixth year. With hormones running wild, Harry realised he’d found himself staring a lot at the other. Sometime in hatred, annoyance, and suspicion yes, but also… ugh, he was not going to name it. Gross.
“Master Draco.” The house-elf greeted. “Is there anything Kreature be getting for his three masters?”
“Are you attracted to me?”
Harry didn’t verbally respond and Malfoy didn’t say anything further, so Harry rolled his eyes and made his way over to the blond. He let out a startled yelp when the other grabbed his wrist and dragged him into a nearby abandoned classroom.
“What are you guys talking about?” Ron sees fit to finally join them, taking a sip from his cold pumpkin juice. His loud question gains the trio unwanted focus which is hardly new to them after years of attending Hogwarts.
Seamus suddenly pipes up, next to his dark-skinned best friend. “Oi, you guys interested in starting a little betting pool?” He indicates a bunch of their classmates and few other Gryffindors from Ginny’s class, who immediately acknowledge them in varying degrees of interest. Surprisingly, Neville also seemed to take part in this betting madness.
“What are the stakes?” Ron asks with a little too much enthusiasm.
Blaise has always remained a good friend of his, irrespective of the temporary changes to their status as a couple and friends with benefits or fuck buddies. Most importantly,  the suave player is aware of Draco’s unrequited affections for Harry potter and has on more occasions than Draco could count, lent his comforting shoulder and a patient ear to vent his frustrations.
Sure, Daily Prophet and other Newspapers of their Magical community are working relentlessly to capture, remind and broadcast the new age of tolerance and open-mindedness: essential changes and community values implemented to reinvent the society and Ministry of Magic at large, like a magnificent phoenix rising from the ashes.
Despite his false bravado, the tiny, pathetic and hopeful part of Draco that refuses to die no matter how hard he squashes it under his heel like a bug, pipes up questioning - whether he may just have gotten Potter’s intentions wrong?
Now though, clearly witnessing Draco blush and titter while Zabini continues to engage him in a conversation, more like feasting on his ears; Harry couldn’t dismiss the uneasiness flooding his system – the probability of truth to the gossip, Draco Malfoy plays for his home team. The information, in itself, is not terrible news if true; except for how Draco probably isn’t single or at least won’t remain so, for long if circling vultures like Zabini had their way…
Draco feels a familiar piercing gaze directed towards him and has to forcibly stamp down his habituated instinct to look up and meet the intense emerald gaze from the opposite corner of the entrance hall.
- as Draco keeps realizing, while the torturous years fly by –
“The case of the missing Slytherins, mate. Sounds like the title of a bloody murder-thriller, ain’t it?” Dean cuts in before Harry could respond, a shrewd look thrown his way, “That’s all everyone seems to be talking about. Pretty sick stunt they pulled on rest of the school. Gotta say, those snakes are sodding good at this whole teamwork spirit.”
Draco should have never sent that stupid package to Potter, in the first place.
Still, who cares how the pureblood chooses to spend his time and with whom?
Harry grips the letter tight, re-reading the sophisticated calligraphy and hurting for his friend’s sake at the barely concealed pain behind his kind words.
Instead of focusing on the delicious breakfast spread before him, he keeps spacing out. Not even the newly added comfort foods or the trusted toast and bacon combo could garner his interest, since Harry couldn’t stop thrumming in anticipation for a much awaited letter from his new friend.
A little opportunity at sparring with him ought to lessen Potter’s stress enough to postpone their eventual confrontation till tomorrow. Draco will let himself be caught unawares by Potter in a sufficiently secure location to hash their differences out verbally.
He likes the sound of that.
The light glinting off the few golden plates and glasses filled with scrumptious offerings in front of the meager bunch of odd first and second year students decked in silver and green scarves, food mostly untouched drives home how serious this entire situation is. Something really fishy is going on and the mystery of it is driving Harry spare.
Not like Harry outgrew his love for Quidditch, doubts if it that’s even possible - merely that, after what they all went through the last few years (the whole being on run from a mad tyrant hell bent on killing him), he isn’t particularly interested in expanding his energies in sports or winning the House cup, as though everything is normal.
Icarus never pushed his opinions or obviously superior wisdom on Harry, instead preferring to highlight the pros and cons of the dilemma until Harry has enough to make an informed decision.
At the end of the day, Icarus has never let Harry down yet and he could only pray the guy doesn’t decide to start, now of all times.
More furious lip biting and pinched expression follows his bewildered query. “Ah, it was the only thing I could think of that makes some sense out of this.” At his incredulity, she hurries to clarify. “I mean, the left over Slytherins are obviously glowering at you. So, I thought maybe …” Hermione carefully trails off.
Neville coughs, gaining their focus. “Er, maybe it is a contagious magical malady situation, the school doesn’t want us to know about?”
Draco gradually gets used to maintaining a secret friendship with the guy he’s in love with but could never have; when he receives that awful letter shattering last of his hopes, for continuing this charade in peace.
“-Two of her younger housemates swear they saw Snape escorting a large group of Slytherins to the hospital wing last night. Rumor has it that Madam Pomprey even closed the wing due to full house and initiated the procedure to activate a temporary medical wing on the second floor for emergencies. It seems this kind of action was last performed when a major outbreak of Spanish flu was rampant.”
The name is both a caution, as well as, a metaphor for Draco's own fucked-up situation.
Its likely, Icarus has nursed strong feelings for his friend, only to lose out on his chance by waiting too long to confess.
He turns away, as the familiar burn in his chest inches its way out through a heated glare in their direction. Stabbing his fork harder than required on the lone sausage, Harry grits his teeth, fighting to get his control back before anyone notices his preoccupation with Draco Malfoy, again.
, Draco drew the obvious conclusions; finally believing Potter’s proclamation regarding his godfather’s eternal love for Lily Potter.
And he almost always comes out of the opposite side, victorious.
Recalling Potter’s satisfying and freaking smug monologue during the battle with
Draco’s life is already complicated enough with all the wretched drama, plus a gut-wrenching stress of trying to get over several years’ worth of feelings for Potter within few months.
Ron takes this news the hardest while Hermione wasn’t even nonplussed. Being the loyal best friend he was, Ron came around eventually, even started to joke around about
Speaking of naïve idiots, Draco is surprised the chosen one is so forward and willingly to pour his heart out to a virtual stranger, seeking their impartial wisdom on confidential matters, no less.
Monday morning finds Harry Potter eagerly waiting for the Owl post at the Gryffindor table.
He cannot walk away from this precious slice of life, Potter unsuspectingly is offering him; having always dreamt of becoming best friends with the Gryffindor and later, wanting more than he could deserve and will never receive in the form of a romantic relationship.
The other, sane half berates him thoroughly by explaining, a name and face to his raging jealousy would only do more harm than good.
On his eighteenth birthday, he received an extremely thoughtful present, alongside a simple note expressing birthday wishes without a sender’s name, which passed the colossal firewall of security the Ministry and Order of Phoenix members personally installed over Harry’s mail, with flying colors. Satisfied the bulky wrapped package contains no threat to his person, Harry opened it only to be flabbergasted with gratitude.
Maybe, Draco should let Potter accidentally corner him, so the guy could get his freaking need to air out his suspicious, out of the way?
A tentative correspondence begins, Draco slowly realizing this is nothing more than a way for Potter to therapeutically vent his frustrations to a stranger, with no awkward baggage involved.
He cracks another smile, catching Blaise’s knowing smirk and rolls his eyes in retaliation. The fucker knows better than to publicly engage him in conversations regarding the golden trio.
years are disqualified from engaging in annual Quidditch matches have swept the students up in a frenzy.
along with gushing his appreciation for the time and trouble taken for acquiring them.
So, Draco is not taking any risks, now.
Except, certain rumors have surfaced over the years rendering his assumptions of Draco and Parkinson’s status as a couple, debatable at best.
He glances habitually towards the blond (thankfully now conversing with others!) and his table again, sighing every time it hits how many students have turned up against general expectations.
That seemed to break them out of their super and they immediately descended on him in a giant Weasley hug. The swishing upset little Anton, and he began crying. Immediately everyone moved away, confused and shocked. Harry immediately turned to his baby and started to soothe him. Once he settled, Harry looked back up to everyone. Arthur and Molly had the brightest smiles he’d ever seen on their faces, and everyone else (minus Hermione, who seems to always know everything) had their chins on the floor.
look.
They stared open-mouthed at him. Harry shifted nervously, rubbing his neck and running
Reluctantly, Draco agreed.
Seeing the change in body language of the blond, Harry knew he was about to get a good fucking. No doubt the past few years of animosity would add up into a brutal pace and his arse clenched in excitement. He eagerly gave control over, not caring who it was to, only hoping that by doing so meant he got it good.
Draco obviously picked up the mood of his friend, curious abut what caused this odd behaviour. He easily identified some of the key signs of someone having a good lay. Now the question was who. He eyed each person in the hall for a few minutes to see who was sitting uncomfortably. He knew from experience that Blaise was a brutal bed partner.
In sixth year he was
, he thought.
Three months old, and Poppy popped in to check in to see how little Anton was going, and give him his vaccinations for both muggle and wizard diseases, per Harry’s request.
Harry gave a weak and exhausted grin. It seems he was gathering his own collection of sex gods.
Harry nodded, still shocked simply from the fact he was pregnant at all. Poppy cast the spells.
Harry also found himself singing to his bump. It was usually at night just before he went to bed.
Draco then used his other hand to grip Harry’s face and turn it towards him to catch the plump lips in a dirty kiss. Their panted breaths mingling the few seconds their lips weren’t attached. Draco could taste traces of himself still on that tongue and it egged him to go harder and faster still.
“Do you, do you want to go on a date with me?” Harry rushed out, then held his breath, waiting to be rejected.
“Priceless one? Oh Harry, that’s beautiful. Perfect for him. You’ll tell us the father eventually though, right?”
Throwing caution into the wind Harry charged forward. He took a step closer to the blond, looking up into his grey eyes, and smirked. “So all you want is for me to have sex with Blaise? Nothing else? You don’t want me for something else? To do something else?” He said slyly.
That evening, Harry sent a message to Draco. He got a reply the following morning.
Draco agreed and they got ready for, and into bed. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s middle and breathed in his scent.
“Harry!” An excited Molly called out. “Oh Harry! It’s so good to see you. Where have you been? Are you okay? Why couldn’t we come and see you? Why couldn’t we at least fire-call?”
So he kept muttering dirty words, as his fingers began tugging on Draco’s uniform. Draco was frozen in a mix of growing lust and utter embarrassment. This was not how he’d thought this would go. Though he mused the abandoned classroom had something to do with it. He jumped as he felt his dick popping out from it’s confines and the warm fingers countering the chill of the air. He looked down to see Harry had sunk to his knees, finally getting the image of Harry below him as he’d wanted for years. Although one crucial difference was that Harry was clearly in charge. That wouldn’t do.
“Yeah. Do you want to meet him?” They nodded vigorously.
, is correct. Also yes, I agree our behaviour is both of our faults. Are you willing to look past this and be friends? I am friends with Hermione.”
“Hey Potter!” Draco called out to said boy, after classes when they were alone in the hall. Harry turned curious eyes upon his former school nemesis. After the war they both had silently agreed to just leave each other alone. So Malfoy wanting to talk could be about anything. Hopefully it wouldn’t start a fight though.
They chatted for a while longer, before the call ended.
with stalking him. sighing, he rubbed a hand down his face. He stood, finding a quip and some parchment.
“Yes, Potter. Though my friendship with her mainly stems from getting back at my father for controlling my life. One thing I’d like to know though, potter is why you asked if I remembered anything from a particular night, and then eight months later,
And fuck him he did. Hands kept Harry in place as he withdrew and slammed forwards again. Harry closed his eyes and focused on breathing through his nose as his throat was attacked. Drool escaped around the corners of his mouth, dribbling onto the floor, and Draco did not let up. Harry pressed his tongue to the base of the sex organ, hollowing his cheeks and sucking whenever Draco withdrew.
The goblin nodded and told him to follow another goblin into the offices. Harry was still nervous. They could be taking his to their dungeons for all he knew.
The week flew by, and before he knew it, Harry was preparing to go visit the Weasleys and introduce Anton to them all in person. He was incredibly nervous, but excited at the same time. He flooed in, and immediately fell onto the floor. Anton was clutched to his chest and merely whined at the disruption the floor and rough landing caused before settling down again.
Draco let out a sigh. This was coming off all wrong. “I’m not threatening you Harry. After the war I don’t want to fight with you. Whatever we do I’m not going to sell you out. If anything your kind of helping my friend, and I want you to continue that.” The last bit was added with a smirk, causing Harry’s cheeks to flame.
Harry’s jaw dropped. “Y-you mean…?” He trailed doff.
Harry let out a breath he have been holding. “Good. I think, I think I like you too. Im sorry Draco, for keeping him a secret. I didn’t know how you’d react and I feared you wouldn’t want an illegitimate child to sully your name, so I feared for his safety. I am ashamed to admit I took the cowards way out, but know that if I knew then what I know now, I would never have left.”
Molly gasped and had a hand over her mouth, tears gathered in her eyes. Arthur simply stared, stunned, until a smile broke out.
There was immediately the sound of hurried footsteps from all over the Burrow. Suddenly harry had an
The image was so tempting he had no choice but to enjoy the virility of being a teenager, taking his waking dick in his hand and tugging it to full hardness. As the blond recalled how good the past who-knows-how-long was, and then taking in the image of debauchery that was Harry, it wasn’t long before he was spraying semen again, and this time not into Harry, but onto. Where Harry’s seed was spread on one side of his body, the other was now painted by Draco’s seed.
Now 20 weeks in, Harry had moved permanently into his new house. He had called the grouchy house elf the day before, and he was just as grumpy and resentful and he had always been. Until he noticed the second magic generating in the family. He was the Black family elf, and the heir was growing. With the knowledge of a coming child, and hat the father was pureblood, the elf became a different being overnight. He was no longer as grumpy. Didn’t insult Harry, (though he still want partial to the ‘blood traitors’ and ‘mudbloods’, but Harry was grateful to the improvement. It would make the next who-knows-how-long much more enjoyable.
It felt like a dream. The angry words that he hurled at Harry, the look of hurt and confusion written clear across his face before he jumped off the tower. The fall itself was not in of itself terrifying although he supposed it should be. He felt almost a relief that his pain and all of this would be behind him as the hard ground drew closer and closer before he felt unbelievable pain which sent him blissfully into the darkness.
“Whatever. Just get on with it.” The older witch took out her ward and whispering a few words began to slowly move it down his body, stopping at his abdomen.
“Let me make it up to you Draco, please.” Harry pleaded as his face fell, disappointment written across his face.
"You little bastard!" Harry raged before reaching out and grabbing Draco by the hair and slapping him hard enough to split his lip. "You really are a snake, aren't you?!" Slamming Draco in to the wall, Harry let him slide to the floor.
Removing his hands from his nipples, Harry bites down hard and tugs on his ear lobe. "You've pissed me off." He murmured into the blonde’s ear. "Okay, then I'm going to release your binds, so I can really play with you." Harry waved his wand at the shackles on his wrists and ankles, instantly releasing him.
''No. Nothing like that.'' Draco wrapped his arms around his knees, hiding his face into them.
''Pansy. Good morning.'' He answered with little emotion in his voice. He knew why they dated, even if she refused to acknowledge that was a relationship to only please their parents, he had no real feelings for her at all.
''Well, you care too much over everything that Potter says or does. You pretend to hate him, but I know you better than you think. I know it is not hate that you feel for him, but that you like him. I am right, aren't I?''
“I can’t promise you that I won’t ever hurt you again, because there are so many kinds of hurt and pain in the world. I can only promise you that I do sincerely regret my actions. Regret that I didn’t take the time to listen to you. Regret that I left you to deal with your pain all this time.” Draco turned back to Harry, stepping closer so he was standing over him, but not close enough for the other boy to reach him, a look of incredulousness written across his face.
His mind was a blank as he was gently grasped by warm hands that helped get him to his feet, steadying him as they led him out of the gathering crowd to follow the path that Draco was taken on, not conscious of the fact that he too was being led to the hospital wing as well.
''You don't know as much as you think you do!” Draco turned away from Blaise angrily.
“What the hell Vincent?!” Draco cried out, startled at the loud noise and the overbearing presence of the larger boy at his back, as he whipped around to have his back to the hall door, looking wildly around himself. Blaise and Vincent looked on with shock written clearly across their faces at the smaller blonde in front of them.
Looking down on the blonde huddled on the floor shaking in fear, Harry let a smirk return to his features. "Maybe it is time to really teach you a lesson that Gryffindor isn't to be messed with. That I'm not someone you should trifle with."
Harry stayed on his knees numbly on the ground as Dumbledore helped to whisk Draco to the hospital wing to get stabilized. He stared down at his hands that had recently held Draco’s face between them as his heart threated to pound out of his chest.
"Well? What is it? Do you really want me to go that rough on you?" Draco's eyes grew even wider in his terror.
He could hear Blaise and Gregory whisper worriedly across the chamber from him. He couldn't hear what was being said, but he knew that he was the center of their discussion. Moaning softly, he pulled the pillow over his head, trying to block out their voices as he closed his eyes and fell into a fitful sleep.
I’m sorry this chapter is so late. I’m dealing with severe and crippling depression and I’ve just recently been discharged after being hospitalized for over a month. I’m sorry. I will try better in the future.
"You what?!"

“Draco… Draco look at me.” Draco turned his gaze back to Harry’s. “Look, I can see what you are thinking. No matter what may have occurred between us, you said you were pregnant. You don’t want to do this to the baby Draco.” Harry backed away a few steps and spoke softer and lower in tone.
“I don’t believe you… I can’t do this anymore. I’m done.” Draco swung his other leg over and stood unsteadily on the edge of the deck. He let go of the railing and leaned forward.
I appreciate any creative criticism so long as it helps to increase my writing skills. Please enjoy!
With a moan, Draco forced his eyes open in the darkness of his enclosed bed. Poking his head out of the curtains, he could see that the others hadn’t returned yet from where ever they were and that through the window it was darkening. He shook off the chill that ran down his spine and the melancholy that was eating away at his soul. I can’t do this anymore.
Draco, panicking and attempting to break free from Harry's strong hold on him, bit down on Harry's tongue causing him to pull away quickly and free the blondes wrists at the same time.
“Hey! Wait! Why are you in such a hurry?!” Harry’s voice followed him as Draco heard his footsteps following him up the winding stair case.
“Harry was that you just now? ‘Cause I’m not asleep. I can move if you’d like?” He murmured into Harrys neck.
Draco shook his head and looked down into the green eyes he loved so much smiling happily as he curled up in the warm lap, tucking his head into the nook of Harry’s neck where it meets the broad shoulders sighing happily. Time seemed to come to a stand still as he felt Harry tighten his grip on him.
“Mr. Malfoy, can you lay back? I need to perform a more in-depth examination of your abdomen to be on the safe side.” She said as she helped him to lay back. She murmured some more, moving her wand in circles above his abdomen. She started to frown as she did so. “Interesting. Very interesting.” She flicked her wand and put it away as he sat up on the edge of the bed.
A short chapter! Sorry guys.
"Yes"
''I wasn't out with Pansy last night.'' He looked up and glared at Blaise who grinned down at him. ''Where did you get that idea?''
Warnings include all the listed ones as well as an additional warning about suicide attempt.
Ten minutes later, as he was stepping out of the marvelous steam he was enjoy and pulling his fresh clothes on, a loud pounding on the door and a shout from Gregory to “Hurry your pansy ass up!”, signaling that his roommates were up and about already. Sighing in frustration, he pulled the door open, grabbed his things, and stepped aside to let Gregory into the room.
Warnings: violence, abuse, swearing, non-consent, M/M, eventual mpreg, depression, self-harm, angst, suicide, character death
“No. That can’t be!” Draco cried horrified. He took one look at the woman before pushing himself off the bed and running out of the infirmary, ignoring the cries of the woman behind him.
The warmth surrounded him once more, as the muscular arm reached around his chest pulling him back to lean against a muscular chest. The arm stayed wrapped around him, as the other hand grasped his chin and turned it gently to the side before starting to gently wash the vomit away from his mouth and chin. Draco turned his gaze up at the face of the person who was holding him, his eyes widening in shock when he met the gaze of those stunning emerald eyes.
Draco moved as quickly as he could with stiffened limbs and embarrassment, scrambling off the bed, and towards the door. Harry pulled off his cloak, tie, and shirt, tossed them as he got up waving his wand yanking Draco back towards him, leaving him to fall in a heap on the floor.
He carefully peeled off his long-sleeved shirt before kicking his pajama bottoms and pants off, tossing the lot to the side. He worked quickly to unwrap his arm, wrapping the dirty dressing in toilet paper and throwing them in the trash bin. Running his fingers over the cuts, he smiled softly to himself before turning the taps on and stepping under the running water.
Grinning evilly down at his prey like a vulture, Harry didn't reply. The dark-haired teen stood back to admire his handiwork. With a wave of his wand, the blondes clothing disappeared with an audible squeak from the boy.
“No, you may not as you are in fact pregnant, 3 months along actually. Why didn’t you use contraception? You should know better.” She looked disapprovingly at him as his jaw dropped and a look of horror over took his face.

“Okay, let’s go then.” He looked down at his feet as he quietly left the bathroom and walked up to the Room of Requirement beside Harry silently, entering the room at Harry’s heels. He noticed that the same chairs and couch were placed in that familiar semi-circle in front of the warm fireplace with the massive four poster bed missing from the bed. Draco sighed nervously as he curled up in one of the arm chairs, staring at the fire as Harry settled himself in the couch across from him, silently waiting for Harry to get to why he wanted to him.

The walk seemed to go on forever along the way, his footfalls unsteady, and he nearly tripped himself several times as they made their way in complete silence. On entering the hospital wing, Harry only became aware as he hurt Madame Pomfrey rushing around a lone bed, frantically waving her wand and uttering spells beneath her breathe along side Snape and Dumbledore.
He was startled as he heard the door to the room creak open revealing Harry standing in the entrance way with his wand up, facing his direction.
“He needs to be moved to the hospital wing now Harry.” Harry looked up to meet Dumbledore’s solemn face. “We have him stabilized but we can’t do more out here for him.” Harry sat back onto his heels, with Hermione and Ron pushing they way through the murmuring crowd to his side while Dumbledore straightened up and gently raised Draco from the ground with his wand and made his way through the parted crowd.
"I like to see you like this." Leaning down to whisper into his ear, Harry began to skim his nose from the ear down his neck where he then bites down hard on his shoulder.

With my own original characters added in as well.
''Are you going to tell me what’s going on? This hiding away is not like you. Did something happen between you and Pansy?'' He asked Draco softly.
“I’m sorry. Don’t go.” Harry looked up at Draco with a pleading look. “I have to confess this isn’t what I expected when I was asked to meet you here. It seems as though you beat me to the punch.” Harry smiled up at the blonde’s confusion. “I love you too you git.” He tugged on Draco’s wrist, causing the smaller boy to fall into his lap. Harry then wrapped his arms around him and looked up at him adoringly. “I’ve loved you since the beginning. Since that day in the robes shop when we met.” Harry smiled up at him, his green eyes echoing his heartfelt words to Draco.
“I love you. Don’t make me repeat myself Potter.” Draco smirked over to Harry who sat quietly in his seat. “You don’t need to say anything in return, I just had to get it off my chest.” He felt his face flush as he spoke, slightly hurt that the other boy had yet to say anything to him. Shaking his head, he got to his feet and moved to pass between the two chairs when a larger tanned hand grabbed his wrist.
'' 'Morning Draco! What were you doing last night?'' She pulled him to a stop before moving around him to stand in front of him, putting her face up close to his. ''I missed you.'' She added coyly, smiling seductively up at him.
''Taste what you love, slut.'' To which, the exhausted and pain filled Draco opened his mouth and took Harry's finger in and sucked it clean, hoping that he would be released from this hell. Just as he wished, Harry laughed pulling his finger away as he moved to pull his clothes back on.
“Hello Mr. Malfoy. How can I help you today?” The kind, larger woman smiled at him, but he could tell she was running her eyes over his body looking for injury or illness. She stopped when she reached his face. “Appears as though you have a pretty bad headache there Mr. Malfoy.” She tsked and took him by the chin and gently turn his head side to side ensuring there was no injury that needed to be dealt with that could be causing the headache. “The pain reducing potions I have require that I give all students who require them a quick physical to ensure that there will be no ill effects.”
''We best get going Draco. You know those two can't do anything if you aren't there to guide them.'' He laughed, indicating Vincent and Gregory.
“I love you.” He blurted out in a rush. He straightens in his seat staring Harry down who looked at him with a look of shock, disbelief, and confusion.
''So, you like to take it up the ass do you? I knew you were a slut!'' Harry groaned out as he moved harder and faster seeking his own pleasure. He was solely focused on his building peak which he hit after slamming deep and hard into the blonde, releasing his cum deep inside of him. After collapsing on the blonde for a moment, he pulled out, laughing as he seen his cum dripping out of him. Reaching down, he scooped it up with a finger which he put up to Draco's mouth.
''What is that supposed to mean Draco?''
Harry took a deep breath and stepped forward. Laughing manically, he once again took a hold of Draco's chin and directed him to look at him once more. ''And like I would ever believe that!'' Harry moved on to the bed, straddling him. ''I am going to make sure you remember that you can't screw around with me.'' He leaned down and forcibly kissed him as he moved to open and kick off his trousers. Shocked, Draco uselessly began to squirm to try and loosen his ties.
''I am glad to see you are back with us Mr. Malfoy.'' Dumbledore murmured softly down to him from his position where he was squatted down beside him, worry still etched across his face. “Are you quite alright boy?”
“Well, what did you need to talk about?” Harry asked without turning towards him.
"Well I suppose that's true. You are a sneaky bastard, but you are also pathetic. And you are just pathetic enough for something like this." Harry looked his captive over fully this time as if for the first time and smirked, "I suppose I may as well take advantage of the situation don't you think? I mean, here you are, presenting yourself to me on a silver platter."
Draco didn’t answer, only sped up, throwing the door to the observation deck open and stepping outside. Just outside the door, he stopped, bending over to hold his knees as he tried to catch his breath. He heard the echoing footsteps coming the rest of the way up the stair case and seen Harry around the corner.
''Then could it have something to do with Potter?'' Draco's face shot up and looked up at him in shock. ''I knew it. He has been acting differently since you hid yourself away here. So, have you. Did you finally confess your feelings to him?'' Draco gaped at him.
Draco sat up and shook his head at him. ''I honestly don't know why I am dating her.'' He muttered as Vincent and Gregory noisily left the room.
''You can let me go now. Please.'' Blaise released the blonde only to catch notice of his reddened face as he moved to sit beside him, watching as he pulled his knees up to his chest. They sat in awkward silence until Blaise cleared his throat softly.
“There are plenty of guest rooms Draco, or you could sleep with me. We’ve shared a bed before, apparently, and it’s we’ll probably do it in the future anyway. Hopefully.”
He peeked open his eye to see Draco staring at him, before the biggest grin covered his face. “Yes!”
“Yes, yes, please!” Molly called.
Harry wrote a message to Malfoy, and sent it off by teleporting it. He hadn’t gotten another owl after Hedwig. He couldn’t replace her.
She also recommended Anton have exposure to the outside world, i.e. people. Hesitant to return to the wizarding world with a baby after disappearing for months, Harry decided the safest option was to head into the near muggle village. They knew him (kind of) and they saw him buy baby gear, so they were clearly expecting a baby sometime soon.
“Is that is okay? I’ll have to send a message to mother though, so she doesn’t worry.”
“No, why?”
He consulted his outline of what would happen when, given to him by Poppy. He’d develop a baby bump somewhere between 12 and 16 weeks. So, he might be able to last 20 weeks of the 35 before he’d have to vanish.
“It that all? Harry! That is totally okay. You know, Charlie’s gay too! Did you think we would be upset over it?”
The new sensation mixed wonderfully with the familiar one and Harry stood pliant, enjoying them and gasping whenever the angle was just right and his prostate was hammered against. Draco was muttering dirty nothings in between bites on his neck. Harry threw his head back against the muscled shoulders partly for support, but partly to give Draco more access. The things he was saying were sending blood south, building pressure in his groin. Filthy words deserved nothing less than filthy moans.
“Yes, Harry. It means he might very well know, and at the very least loves you. Or at least he did. It has been a year you know.”
“Hey everyone.” He said quietly, nervous under all the stares he was receiving.
“Potter.” He greeted.
Blaise appeared unperturbed despite the internal moment of panic that Draco had figured it out. “Why? Interested in a hook up yourself?”
Draco peered at him. Studying him as if to see whether he should be honest or not. Eventually he nodded, slowly.
They arrived and knocked on the door. Thankfully, Hermione answered, and she waved at Draco before ushering them inside. She peeled Anton away from Ron and, after giving him a kiss on the forehead, handed him to Harry, who immediately kissed his son and then gave him to his father. The trio were so caught up in each other they didn’t notice Ron and Hermione creeping upstairs. A few miles later, and the three flooed to Harry’s house. Draco impressed by the building, child-proofed though it was.
Harry smirked coyly and took another step closer, matching each pace Draco took back until they were both pressed against the wall. He learned in to whisper. “So you don’t want me? You don’t want me to spread my legs for you? To take your dick up my arse? To cum inside me?”
Over the next few days, Harry also went shopping in Diagon and other wizarding places for general house furniture. His action were picked up on by the media, but he refused to comment about it every time the asked. Especially if they asked if he’d found a wife and was now furnishing their house for her. That made him really uncomfortable, that particular question.
“So that’s where you’ve been this past year! Who’s the mother?”
Draco moved the hand on Harry’s hip to grip the weeping erection, holding it tightly to prevent Harry from cumming (though he didn’t know that Snape had been training Harry rather well for some time). He also wanted the most sensitive organ to get the rough treatment too. He held the underside, pressing the other half against the stone, pulling a short scream from Harry at the sudden coldness and new stimulation. Every thrust pressed him harder against the wall and deeper into bliss.
Harry didn’t want to admit it, but he was terrified. He’d always had a bad relationship with Malfoy, the other using whatever he could to put him down. If this got out, Blaise would cop so much, and if the reporter dug deeper the might find out about the others! Snape might be put in jail for having sex with a student, Sirius with his charge, and the others would just be embarrassed. He couldn’t never have sex again. And he really didn’t want to receive letters from strangers calling him a whore, or begging him to sleep with them too.
“Err… I do now?” Arthur managed to get out after a minute of silence from both parties.
Harry hung his head, but explained none-the-less.
“Malfoy.” Harry returned.
The young red-headed woman appeared round the corner. She saw him and her face brightened in the hugest smile. “Guys! Harry’s here!”
“Hi Hermione.”
He was now faced with a dilemma. He couldn’t go out into wizarding society looking pregnant, not the muggle world. He’d have to go into hiding where no one could find him once he started to show.
Harry also decided he should introduce his son to the Weasleys. Incredibly nervous about it however, since they hadn’t seen him in over a year, despite regular written communication, it wasn’t the same. Anton’s hair was also a key identifier to the possible other parent, though they mightn’t think it was Draco if they believe him to be the father, not the mother. He could say she had the same coloured hair, and that she was a muggle he met one night, bore his sone and left him with Harry. Though Hermione might see right through
As he imagined each scenario for a second, one in particular made his dick twitch.  So, smirking, he moved behind the smaller boy and pressed him forwards and upwards, Harry stumbled for a moment before leaning on the wall to support himself. He went to turn around to ask what Draco was doing when he stiffened as pale arms wrapped around his waist, and hips pressed tightly to his arse, the familiar feel of erection telling him exactly what Draco was doing.
“Hi Molly, Arthur. It’s lovely to see you too. I’m sorry it’s been so long, but I couldn’t risk anybody finding out.” Harry decided he was just going to come out and tell the truth.
Taking his silence as a yes, Blaise couldn’t help but add “Whether or not you are, you can’t tell anyone about it. I swore to him I wouldn’t tell anyone and I’d much like to fuck him again thank you very much.
“What? What happened?”
The next day he went back to Gringotts to claim the portly that would take him there. Upon arrival, he noticed a few things.
——————————————
For the next 7 weeks, Harry and Kreature fixed up the house. Pairing over the walls, restoring the floors, and placing in the furniture. Harry spent a lot of his time in the nursery, carefully painting the walls with luscious forests and many creatures, including dragons, centaurs, unicorns, and many others. He found in one of the many books, a charm that animated images, and so applied it to the creatures, though they couldn’t make any noises.
“Harry… is that- is that a baby?” Charlie asked.
The next day, Harry did just that. He took Anton for a day trip into the town. Everyone who recognised him form his occasional trips before his isolation from society greeted him and started cooing over his newborn.
“Wait, so you have a baby?”
The war had finished a year ago. For being the boy-who-lived-twice, not many people listened to him. Especially when it involved personal space and privacy.
Harry’s words caused a reaction he could feel. Draco’s breath had hitched, cheeks flushing, and most importantly, pouch hardening. Harry grinned. Who said it was too soon to have sex again?
Draco gasped. “Wow. He’s gorgeous. My hair, your eyes; he’s perfect.”
Harry smiled proudly. “Yeah, he is. Um… Draco?” The other hummed, briefly looking up to show he was listening before going back to studying the picture.
Harry, exhausted as he was, couldn’t help laughing with joy. His
“Malfoy, I- I know we never go t along in the past, and that is both of our faults. However, I understand there may have been another factor, besides hatred, that influenced our behaviour during our schooling years. My friend has also told me that you er… didn’t end up marrying the woman your father found for you, and you created a huge candle about being in love with another man.”
Ten minutes later, and Harry was now the Lord to 6 different families. Geez. Not what he was expecting. He requested a list of all his properties categories on the family that owned it. He took the list back home and spent the rest of the day reading about each one.
“You alright, dear? Seem to have quite the shock I assume. Though can’t say I’m surprised. Lot’s of tension between you two. Honestly, it was bound to happen eventually.”
Harry also began distant contact with the Weasleys and Hermione. They were upset with him for not contacting them is weeks. Hermione was the only one who noticed his air of sadness, but he refused to tell her anything. he had a few meetings with them, and on his final visit, marking his 18th week (the bump was starting to become quite visible in his plain jeans and t shirt, given his tiny frame), he told them he had to leave for a few months to a place they could contact him but couldn’t visit. They were upset they couldn’t see him, but he begged them, and they eventually relented.
His name had been splashed everywhere over Voldemort’s defeat for months. When they became old news, it went on to gossip about his future; partner, job, etc.
Harry did the only thing he could: faint.
“That wasn’t a dream Harry.”
With no prep needed and Draco’s dick lubed from Harry’s mouth, the blond had no hesitation taking half a step forward, pressing immediately inside and pressing his chest to the brunette’s back, straightening them up slightly. The fit was still tight despite the loose entrance, and the muscles gripped him. Harry let out a gasp at the sudden intrusion at the same time his cheeks flushed when it made him remember that he didn’t need to be stretched. It was also partially humiliating that Draco knew who had done it too. For some reason it just made him feel hotter.
“Your friend,
“Well you do, and there’s no escaping us now”
“Basically, Harry, what has happened to you is very rare. Barely any wizards have the magical strength to accomodate a foetus, but obviously you are. Another thing, is that only other wizards can impregnate. Women, obviously have the wrong apparatus for the job, and muggles lack the magic required. Would I be able to cast some spells to see the father and fertilisation date?”
“Please! The hair is a signature Malfoy trait, and not many other wizards would even come close to that hair colour. How did it even happen anyway?”
January the 20th arrived, and Harry had left Anton at the Weasleys. He apparated to Diagon and made his way to The Hogs Head. It was 5:55pm when he arrived, and so asked for a room with heavy privacy wards. He also told the worker to send Draco Malfoy up when he arrived. Also to prevent any reporters coming p to them. Then he waited. At exactly 6pm Draco Malfoy came into the room. He scowled down at Harry, who couldn’t help but shrink away from the glare.
Three weeks of throwing up later, and Harry went to see Poppy Pomfrey, who had to explain to him how this could happen.
Not expecting that response, Draco blushed. Was he? No! It was Potter. That’s
They left the tavern together, holding hands and apparated to the Burrow. The media was going to have a field evening!
Draco frowned but dropped the conversation
Harry lifted the sleeping Anton and rotated him so they could see.
Harry’s breathing and heart rate was increasing. Then he passed out. “Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. She cast
Meet at The Hogs Head on Wednesday the 20th of January at 6pm.
“Actually, Harry, like always you assume and your predictions are so incredibly different from the truth. Have you had any contact with the wizarding world since you left? Newspapers? Anything?”
Now it was Draco’s turn to blush and he managed to stammer out a “n-no. I mean yes. I mean no. I…”
As he neared release, he moved his hand to wrap around the smaller’s abdomen and chest, seemingly in an attempt to fuck Harry into the wall. Harry was scratching at the stone in excitement from stimulation, only gasps and moans falling from his mouth. He could feel that glorious cock sliding inside his walls and then out. He pressed back just as Draco made his hardest thrust and climaxed, shooting streams of spunk deep into his body. He could feel each spurt splash against his walls. He could feel the cock pulsing inside he chamber. He could feel those balls pressed snugly against him. He could feel the hand tugging at his own erection where it had left a trail of white down the stone. The sensations sailed into one big wave that crashed down and he seized, clamping down on the spurting organ while his own painted the wall.
They engage in a casual, no-strings relationship – comforting and helping each other to forget about the big, bad world existing outside their space, if only for some time.
In all their six years at Hogwarts together, Harry doesn’t remember Draco ever allowing anyone in his personal space, other than Parkinson of course.
“I can’t believe you actually said that, Hermione! Playing a match against another House team is vastly different from playing with friends.”
Oh, he garners Potter’s attention, alright.
There is something weird going on at the Slytherin table.
So yes, getting back with Blaise is a no brainer.
, if it isn’t hilarious.
Befriending Potter turns out to be both quite easy and interesting.
Panic, undoubtedly sets in with the realization this isn’t a normal crush or phase, he would invariably grows out of; emphasized more through frustrating corroboration, Draco doesn’t give a damn about him, anymore.
All he did was end a monster’s attempt at world domination, which was not even his lone effort. So, he would rather people stop treating him as the next Jesus freaking Christ,
between them or if it’s every inch the spectacular revelation, he believes it is.
Much later, after all the Slytherin classes have been canceled for the day and Harry consulted with the Maurders map, the highly troubling case of the missing Slytherins is solved … to an extent
Harry pushes his plate away, terminating his act of picking through his food; nerves and anxiety stealing his appetite long before any worry of rejection ever could.
Maybe if he does some sleuthing of his own using his father’s invisibility cloak …
At least, Harry is sure neither Mrs. Malfoy nor Draco would be involved or back Lucius up, if he decides to throw away his second chance.
Draco seems to have plenty of time for Zabini these days, much more than for Parkinson. Yet strangely, the girl appears to not mind this development, at all.
Draco takes a fucking week to answer Potter’s plea to offer his expert wisdom.
He signs his letters as
The Malfoy bottomless coffers, their only saving grace, has been keeping them afloat through this turbulent ride.
Harry waits with a bated breath to have his premise backed up.
Beside Harry, Hermione murmurs rather sharply under her breath. “We all know who Padma is, Lavender.” Although, Harry is pretty sure he’s the only one who heard her sarcastic comment. Still, he is rather intrigued by Brown’s opening statement and pays complete attention to the notorious gossiper’s words.
What he needs is an impartial party to weigh Harry’s apprehensions against the possible benefits and simply tells him what to do. Someone with personal experience dating guys and knows how to approach one with positive results.
Only Harry seems to genuinely care and grow frustrated by the minute. He forcibly inhales his frustrations, cataloguing the speculations thrown left, right and center.
Normally, he always writes a response at the earliest, awaiting for a later date simply to throw Potter off his scent and to convince him, the mysterious Icarus is currently posting messages from across the channel rather than say, a few feet away from their eighth year tower.
Unfortunately, Draco is allowing it.
There are no secrets between the three of them, at least not for long and this time isn’t an exception either.
Actually, as long as he’s listing impossible requests – Harry would also prefer it, if Draco could hold his stubborn eye-contact and cease turning temporarily deaf and blind in his vicinity. Or better still, he could halt freaking cuddling with that jerk Zabini in public places … you know what, if Draco completely avoids socializing with the perfect, tanned specimen, that would be amazing!
Judging by the way Potter is nearly vibrating out of his skin, waiting for a suggestion from
“Didn’t you guys hear?” Lavender Brown leans forward, a few seats away from their lot, her blue eyes shining brightly in unmasked glee. “Padma Patel, Parvathi’s twin sister was saying earlier–”
Still, it’s only a gratitude note proving Draco is successful in his quest of assembling the perfect gift. He sends a nonchalant reply back, claiming coincidence for their ownership and not deliberately acquired.
Harry tries to give out as much details as possible without violating their rules.
This unlikely yet powerful alliance of Slytherin-Hufflepuff houses is the stuff of legends on par with and sometimes even surpassing the history of feuds Gryffindors share with the Pureblood propaganda house.
If anything, Draco is worried about himself.
After all, he has confirmation from the Lion’s mouth itself that Draco doesn’t stand a fucking chance.
“ –But don’t we deserve to play and participate in the Quidditch championship…after all, this is our last year.” Ron insists, amid huge cheers from their house peers.
Neither of their feelings survived once the constant backdrop of threats, petty obstacles and forbidden drama is removed. Besides, he came to learn recently (after Icarus explicitly answered all his queries in detail) his dating pool is only being half-utilized.
That, Draco might have outgrown his need to challenge him at every turn is an extremely hard and bitter pill for him to swallow.
– Mr. Weasley was quick to point. One can have all the proof in the world to frame a guilty party but if the charged person in question happens to be a Malfoy, none of evidence will stick and they will walk free, their pristine reputation restored in matter of weeks.
Though, to be honest all he does is rant, whine and seek advice from a patient guy, who is somehow, yet to grow sick of Harry’s never ending list of troubles.
So, if anyone has a chance in hell of dragging the undisclosed information straight from the serpent’s mouth, it’s the trusted and kind badgers.
Weeks pass by, and another letter from Potter reaches him out of blue, again.
…he and Potter share DADA class before lunch. He could casually allow the git to partner with him, like he had been trying so hard to do since the start of the term.
Potter has a crush - a pretty serious one too, on one of his friends.
Steeling himself, Harry opens the envelope - giddy to find its content while short is shockingly not apathetic, like he expected.
His type coincides perfectly with Draco Malfoy’s description because Harry has a thing for his nemesis, from
And he does try … extremely hard to remain indifferent to the chosen one's existence but the universe continues to foil all his attempts whilst cackling maddeningly in his face.
It takes Harry, longer than he is proud of, to make the right connection.
Harry, however, is back to checking out the opposite table at the interruption – some habits are hard to break than others, not as if he is trying to be honest. Although, he is soon dragged to the present by his best friend’s lecture on ethics and moral grey grounds.
knows how long!
Observing the perfect features on the beautiful, pale face morph into a small yet genuine smile, radiating with happiness - his insides clench painfully in intense disdain; the simple action pissing him off, more than any taunt from Malfoy ever did. Not because Harry is a giant twat. Au contraire, he enjoys seeing Draco let out the occasional smile and charming laughter instead of mean or smug smirks, he’s mostly used to get from the blond. Nonetheless, the fact these anomalies are stemming from someone else (due to Blaise sodding Zabini) is what’s bothering Harry the most.
Not so surprisingly, Lucius Malfoy managed to evade serious charges and life-time imprisonment stint at Azkaban after citing mitigating circumstances to his advantage. He later learned, a combination of empathy for their (then) living situation, a recently discovered need for tolerance (owning to the seriously dwindling magical population) and a major role Mr. Malfoy (or rather his unending, deep pockets) played in keeping the Britain economy afloat, helped the senior Death Eater escape due justice.
Not that Harry blames Ron. Sometimes, he starting to gather, it is better to remain oblivious and safe from these kinds of dangerous thoughts evading senses. He would love to trade places but knows this ship sailed a long time ago. Particularly from the exact moment a specific pompous git strolled up to him and casually offered his hand in friendship which Harry rejected, forming an instant life-long rivalry with the said bastard in all his eleven year old glory. All good, no regrets … just a major pain in ass, though.
Harry wanted to ditch the remainder of breakfast to investigate but a warning glance from Hermione, stealthily slipped without halting her heated argument stops him in his tracks; guilt and annoyance warring for dominance in his chest.
Except, he was bored out of his mind and began randomly collecting historical artifacts to pass time, which kind of lead to cross-referencing data from old newspaper editions. And before Draco knows it; he has a good pile of information relating to the Potters family, carefully categorized and kept aside.
One of the first things Professor McGonagall did, when she became the Headmistress is to stress upon the importance of unity and impartiality of houses.
Harry must not have been clear about his conundrum while seeking help, as he previously believed. To be fair, he was definitely freaking out when he wrote that letter. So, a lot of relevant information must have been lost in regards to context.
Harry is nothing if not a stubborn bastard once he makes up his mind, hell-bent on succeeding, despite the unbeatable odds.
After nearly two months of exchanging letters, Harry finds he still knows next to nothing about this Icarus. That guy is insanely private, even more than Harry himself and going so far as to establish early on to reveal next to no important information regarding themselves.
Dismayed by the palpable refusal from Icarus, although why he is still surprised when Icarus has time and again, persisted in staying clear of his efforts to engage as an emotional confidant, is anybody’s guess?
Like the question all along is whether Harry Potter is worthy of disclosing pertinent information and not the other way round. Unfortunately, the answer happens to be a resounding
It appears a tiny detail has been inadvertently ignored during his hectic years of fighting for survival - his undeniable attraction towards both genders. Apparently, appreciating asymmetrical features and fit bodies isn’t a strictly heterosexual attribute. More precisely, his type happens to be jocks, strong, smart and sarcastic people, preferably playing the seeker position and is very good at it.
It felt rather anticlimactic to learn he is diagnosed with PTSD and depression, instead of some new horror looming near the corner. Hermione insisted they approach a mind healer when their nightmares frequency skyrocketed and Harry started to develop anxiety attacks at even the thought of social-interactions.
, Icarus clearly has daddy issues and an emotional baggage which is hard to ignore through his periodic melancholic tirades. But except that,
“You have no idea what you are talking about…fuss? Oh, don’t even go there-”
Blaise, Pansy and others are making fun of the Gryffindors for whining loudly about being excluded from the Quidditch season. Theo is doing a perfect impression of Weasley gaping like a fish, aghast at his girlfriend’s staunch replies and
Hypothetical scenarios aside, Ron’s unwitting remarks are what forces him to confront the depth of his emotions for the Slytherin. Since (ignoring the uncomfortable truth of those statements), Harry doesn’t really hate the thought of everything else the picture presents – namely, he and Draco together, for better or worse like two sides of the same coin.
There, finally a goal for Harry to work towards and starting today, he will surely begin chipping against Draco’s ceiling high impenetrable walls.
A pregnant pause follows Lavender’s ominous report and they all shift uneasily as implications and possible theories start flooding their minds.
Which is why, Draco no longer pays even a shred of interest towards the trio, at least not in public!
Zabini, of course isn’t content to have Draco’s full focus on him; evidently, also needs affirmation the blond is physically there, as though Zabini hallucinated his presence and has to place his grubby hands over Draco’s shoulders, like he had propriety to do so.
And, that’s how Harry found himself sporadically communicating with his anonymous fan and gradually getting better, as a result.
The Malfoys are more fortunate than most but that doesn’t mean, they are above the resentment of the common man. Keeping his head down is even more essential now compared during the war time. Since, this time around there is no different sides, while everyone is (possibly) united by the hatred towards their family.
if he and Draco were to ever get hitched and Harry has the misfortune of having Lucius Malfoy as his father-in-law.
Of course, it took his friends a lot longer to come to terms with this reality, when they accidentally walked in on him rehearsing
Hell, the poor guy probably is unable to say no to Harry at this point, genuinely fearing for his general functionality. Maybe, he should reduce his dependence on Icarus and give him a break?
Old habits and especially, self-defensive mechanisms don’t go down without a tough fight and Draco prefers to have decent supervision nearby, lest he challenges Potter during a last minute panic, of finding his fucking eyelashes of all things, irresistible.
Although, it is relatively easy to conclude Potter finds him attractive, he knows nothing will ever come out of it.
The last thing he needs, is for the star of his
Jerking up, he allows his eyes to wander past the fixed position and the resulting vestige is extremely damning. Pairs of mistrustful and angry eyes take turns to glare accusingly at … yup, him. There are several brands of hateful stares he had garnered over the years to differentiate instantly when Harry is unwittingly in middle of a coup and when he’s the target of a vicious propaganda. This though? Obviously falls under the latter category. As to be expected, Hermione’s presumption that he happened to be in some manner mixed up in this mess legit seems to be holding water.
Harry blurts out, wanting further validation. “Really? And no one has any idea what could be up with those lot? Not even the Hufflepuffs?”
Harry, himself couldn’t care less though, staying quiet and on sidelines of the wildly escalating discussion. He simply tunes out the outrage and frankly good points made by his friends, choosing rather to gaze at the rare clear and cloudless sky of the enchanted ceiling, mentally counting down the time.
(Also, having blond hair helps too.)
However, he refused to be mixed up in this disagreement. Mostly, because he has no strong opinions, either way.
– never had a statement rung so true for him. Misses all the provocations, thinly veiled insults, the back-and-fro banter and their animosity - now that Draco rescinded their unspoken agreement to constantly be at each other’s throats, Harry feels another part of his identity crumbling from his hold, helpless except to loathe anyone who steals his place, catching the Slytherin’s exclusive attentiveness.
, anyway it is not necessary for him to write back clarifying his wrong assumptions. Especially since, it is clearly a sore topic for Icarus. Just because he helped Harry through an identity crisis and later figuring out his sexual orientation, doesn’t give him the right to keep demanding Icarus time, whenever he wants.
Well, that’s what happened. Although, the order of Phoenix – now legally a special unit of defiance (one of the new departments sanctioned by the Ministry) is keeping an eye out on Malfoy, in case he starts dabbing into his old activities. So far, the Malfoys remained squeaky clean; not that Harry is worried, as Lucius Malfoy had to be especially dense to try anything so stupid with the whole Ministry practically breathing down his neck to make one wrong move.
- Draco couldn’t help averting his gaze in wretchedness that threatens to choke him, at the intensity of emotions this person ivokes in Potter and how some stranger’s opinion is worth more than Draco, himself would ever mean to the unruly-haired Gryffindor.
“What does our evening practice have anything to do with the Slytherins playing a twisted version of hide and go seek today?”
Draco’s personal conflict and anguish notwithstanding, Potter deserves to have a happy ending, after all the shit he was forced to go through in his life. Granted, Draco himself never made Potter’s life any easier or less stressful, but god if he isn’t going to stop continuing in his younger self’s path.
But Draco had never been particularly good at making the right choices – story of his fucking life.
In fact, Harry finds it hard to maintain a passing curiosity or even his focus on the most mundane of tasks. A wave of apathy frequently crashes upon his consciousness, alternating with mind-numbing melancholy and hopelessness, bringing along the occasional anxiety for the ride.
, Headmistress isn’t budging on this subject.
An almost wounded howl greet her scandalized words, Dean Thomas and Seamus being the loudest of the bunch.
– the foolish kid, who gets so caught up in the heady sensations of a liberating moment that he loses all common sense and flies too close to the sun, thereby plummeting to his imminent death.
Things, however, have settled now and well into the way of utopia or as close as it gets.
But he does receive a short letter from them, nothing much in the way of identification – merely, a modest dismissal of Harry’s fervent gratefulness.
He immediately rebels the thought of ghosting Icarus … perhaps, he could simply increase the time between his messages instead of completely quitting stone-cold.
The enchanted ceiling reflecting clear blue skies with occasional cloud or two and birds resembling dark specks flying past is no different from any other day of this week. In fact, there is nothing explicitly telling within these huge walls that suggest anything out of ordinary even took place, except for the lone table in the corner with a pitiful amount of students huddling close and being uncharacteristically silent.
Maybe he is giving the ferret too much credit or maybe it’s his trusted instincts backing the hypothesis, Harry couldn’t help frowning at the blank space which still somehow manages to mock as though Malfoy charmed the specific area into continuing their tradition despite his absence. He’s well habituated to glaring in this direction, that one spot in particular, to stop now or let a simple inconsistency such as Malfoy ditching breakfast to deter him. A quick glimpse reveals Snape is missing in action too. Can’t be a coincidence – ninety percent of Slytherins and their head of house just don’t choose to randomly skip breakfast on the same day at the same time.
He uses left hand to write the letters (grateful about his natural ambidextrous skill) - the fear of getting caught in the lie, always at the forefront in his mind.
He should have stepped away then, no good can ever come from this.
There is a simple way this puzzle could be put to an end. At least the part of question as to where the Slytherins are located. The Maurders map is safely locked in his trunk upstairs in the Gryffindor dormitory. All Harry had to do is rush to the tower, collect the piece of parchment and there mystery solved. The why part, however will continue to haunt him until precise answers are found.
After all, Harry practically begged the elusive guy in his beseeching letter to submit a solution to his quandary, a week ago. And in few minutes, he will know whether Icarus chose to rise to the occasion or not.
Finding Lily Potter’s old charms text book is a lucky coincidence.
Hopefully, they would end up striking a tentative truce or if not, they might decide to part as tolerant acquaintances.
And yet Draco feels as though he is the one drowning beneath the waves of sorrow while dying of thirst, for Potter’s elusive attention.
He falls back into his old habits or in this case, into the waiting hands of his ex-boyfriend, Blaise.
Draco would gladly take any two out these three worst options, he’s dealt with.
As silly as it sounds, he misses fighting with the blond.
Draco doesn’t offer up any personal information nor does he demand anything in return; willing to patiently listen to the golden hero rants and refusing to even provide unsolicited advice in spite of his inner control freak’s ramblings.
Beside him, Ron and a bunch of their friends are arguing with Hermione about the merits of including eighth years in the Quidditch season, in fresh outrage against the school board’s decision to exclude them. Their debate acquires plenty of attention from nearby Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, enthusiastic friends and avid Quidditch fans stepping up to give their ten cents about the new rule.
She is fumbling with a silver fork in hand, lips pulled tight in a small frown. “Did … um, something happen last night after the Quidditch practice?” The quiet tone and tiny creases around her eyes bring attention to the worry scarcely suppressed within the warm browns.
“Hmm … so, we have two unreliable accounts insisting Slytherins are sick and a friend confirming the hospital wing is unavailable around the same time, huh.” Dean voices the same red flag raising thought Harry shares.
Headmistress McGonagall has passed new rules, incorporating mandatory therapy sessions to all students – these schedules got neatly worked into everyone’s timetables, ensuring hundred percent attendance and confidentiality.
Fortunately, Draco is feeling less self-destructive these days and listens to the rational tone, keeps his head down and avoids the burning gaze drilling holes from across the room.
It’s only been two and half months since the academic year at Hogwarts began; the damage to the castle has been fully repaired and restored to its near former glory. Although, no amount of renovation could ever erase the stains of death and destruction left behind by the final battle, inside the school grounds.
He gets rid of the mist of apprehension much like a wet dog shakes off the water droplets and scrunches his nose, intrigued to hear her theory. Besides, Hermione is almost never wrong in her calculations and logical jumps. Except perhaps where Malfoy is involved and Harry’s gut insists on his culpability regardless of any reasonable deductions hinting otherwise.
Potter has been glaring at him more often today, making Draco question –
And … Harry is back to spacing out the impromptu sermon. His mind busy trying to consider every ghastly conspiracy theory he could think and soon defying as preposterous.
All their confrontations across the years, heated intense stares and obsession with him during sixth year and currently (as well), made total sense once Harry sat down and wrote the list of qualities that appealed to him, as instructed by Icarus.
His argument? Neither of them should ever be in a position to hurt or take advantage of the other’s ramblings. And faced with such flawless logic, Harry couldn’t say no.
He thinks hard and long but ultimately, there is only one answer he can provide to the true hero of their wizarding world.
Speaking of, where is the haughty git and rest of the Slytherins hiding anyway? What the hell is even going on? It feels a little extreme for a prank and more on the lines of an actual crisis or something. At least, Harry can count on Snape not partaking in any madness his favorite students could come up with. This leaves the only option that something weird went down in dungeons enough to warranty this grade A Houdini act.
It’s only after the third weekly therapy session, Harry even considers responding back.
“Nah, mate. Whatever is going on is strictly under the wraps. We saw few Hufflepuffs approach the second year snakes but they aren’t budging an inch.” Dean’s swift yet negative reply leaves him reeling with more questions.
Against all odds, the infamous prickly and malicious Slytherin house managed to befriend or perhaps the right term here is, adopted practically a bulk of Hufflepuffs, in some sort of an ancient tradition passing resiliently down from generations. While, the house of spoilt brats are no less mean to the badgers than to the rest of two houses, they still show up to defend their Hufflepuff friends’ honor without fail. They kind of got a ‘grumpy cat bullying a golden retriever’ in the name of friendship and ‘viciously-attacking-anyone-who-offends-their-pet’ weird relationship going on for them.
Whatever the reasons for Draco’s new attitude, Harry hates having to face the brunt of it. To put it plainly being ignored by the sassy Slytherin, sucks big time.
He couldn’t remember anything odd taking place on the grounds last night. The Slytherins practice ended way before theirs began. Sure, during the brief moment both teams crossed paths, they all had exchanged typical slurs but nothing’s amiss in that. Malfoy has been obnoxiously snarky as always while he returned the favor, the best he could.
So really, facing Draco Malfoy and confessing his love shouldn’t terrify him as much as it does. Even following Hermione’s advice of befriending and then courting the Slytherin stealthily has its merits. Ron’s unhelpful suggestion of planting one to get the point easily across, felt borderline dubious and is clearly given in jest which ultimately makes the tip useless.
Cursing his idiocy for ever doubting the reliable Icarus; he quickly goes through the brief note.
His own plate of plain toast sits untouched.
Yes, surely then Potter would stop following him around like a kicked puppy and Granger will cease her narrowed stares, while her ginger boyfriend probably still wouldn’t halt aiming his drop-dead glares in Draco’s direction.
He had no idea how someone managed to procure all these uncommon items, but to be given this greatest gift when Harry literally never had much to remember his family by, felt like a dream come true. He penned down a hastily scrawled
“-what’s a few matches got to do with stopping us from studying for N.E.W.T.S, honestly the previous years had no issue with it, so why should we be the exception?”
Anyways, he got the answer he needed. Hearing confirmation from Icarus removed the heavy burden from his shoulders.
“Harry.” Hermione nudges him from further contemplation or rather zoning away in the direction of Malfoy’s empty spot. Ron seated with his back to the Slytherin table, is oblivious as ever to the palpable tension in the air, busy filling his plate with bacon and sausages.
None of his Slytherin classmates are dumb enough to not understand the motives behind his decision, even playing along for sake of unity and blending in with the mindless herd.
It’s not too bad, fun even.
Still, the one undisputable fact of Icarus correspondence is his excellent advice.
And yes, Harry had faced Voldemort several times head-on: also, battled death eaters, ferocious monsters and broke into and out of Gringotts while stealing a damn dragon among other things.
Doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together – the mandatory therapy every student has to attend playing a significant role in Potter doing something so out of character for him. Besides, it is probable for Draco as well, to blame sessions with the crazy, old coot for indulging this lunacy, instead of on his own foolishness.
Realistically, there is still couple of months left to their final year before they officially become Hogwarts alumni. Unaware of Draco’s future career plans, all Harry has to go on, is the knowledge Draco's studious habits rival Hermione’s, so approaching him close to N.E.W.T.S revision schedule would be a disaster of epic proportions.
, Draco was by no means subdued or a mere shell of his former self – actually, he stopped bullying Gryffindors or somewhat ceased to pick on students from their sixth year onwards and never resumed (excluding last year due to unreliable narration).
Harry is so confused and says as much.
Draco was digging through Severus’s belongings inherited through his god father’s will – mostly books, potions ingredients and more books, when he comes across certain souvenirs which left no doubt regarding their previous ownership.
Well, not really unnamed as the mysterious sender prefers to call himself, Icarus. The significance of the name and its tragic back-story isn’t lost on Harry.
He cannot help it, being a Slytherin - self-preservation is basically a personality trait.
All Draco needs to do is hide his identity and then curb out certain essential elements of his personality from getting caught red-handed on the anonymous charmed parchment.
in what Harry thought was an empty dormitory.
The solemn moment is however shattered when Parvathi offhandedly remarks, contradicting her friend. “Yeah. But Padma also said those students were awake for thirty hours straight and counting at that time, running some experiment and prone to hallucinations as a side-effect. Plus, I heard from Susan in Hufflepuff that hospital wing is temporarily closed due to some repairs.”
Perchance, Potter doesn’t want to keep fighting with him?
Maybe not instant life-long friendship or a heart-to-heart exchange but anything … other than being treated as part of the ancient castle’s Victorian décor.
Tying up with Ministry efforts to avoid isolating individual interests and causing the potential raise of another dark wizard, strict measures have been taken to widely drill the importance of forgiveness and starting over on public forums. These were all the result of rapid vigilantism and unrest following the new order within days of the battle, done to avoid bloodshed and traumatized people taking matters into their own hands.
“So I’ve missed my chance then?”
Draco never stopped pounding, thoroughly abusing Harry’s already wrecked entrance. The powerful trusts creating those wonderful slaps of skin, and the saliva and Draco’s copious amounts of precum frothing at where they joined, making squelches that filled the room. It was wonderful to listen to, and doubled with the feeling of that tight, hot chamber swallowing his fat cock. Oh! Draco didn’t think it was possible to get harder.
Harry re-explained the story to everyone like he had to Molly and Arthur in their fire-call. Hermione had her eyes narrowed at him.
This carried on for the next few weeks, until the house was tidied up. He’d leave painting and decorating until he was cooped up in here. One day, he headed over to the nearby town to explore. It was a muggle town, so no one knew him, thank goodness. He bought a ton of supplies; food and baby items. He shrunk all of the baby furniture and (gender-neutral) toys and clothes, and took it back to his new house. He unshrunk it all and left it in the front room in boxes to unpack later.
“How’d you manage to convince Potter?”
“I’d like to claim by lord and heirships please.”
Malfoy
Harry rolled his eyes imagining the papers in the coming days.
Blaise near-swaggered into breakfast the next day. He couldn’t remember feeling so sated in so long. Every bone and muscle was more relaxed than they had bene in years. Fuck, Harry had been amazing, and he’d definitely be up for more rounds in the future.
“Well, Anton, looks like it won’t be just you and me after all. You can meet Auntie Hermione, and Auntie Ginny, and Uncle Ron, and Uncle Bill, and Uncle Charlie, and Uncle Percy, maybe, and Uncle George, Uncle Fred’s no longer here though, baby. He is still watching us though. I hope he loves you too.” Harry kissed his forehead.
“If you don’t guess who it is first, then yes. He doesn’t know though, so you can’t tell anyone other than your close family. I can bring him to visit next week if you’d like?”
Harry shoe his head, dismissing the elf, and turned his attention to Draco. “Would you like to stay the night?” He asked.
Two hours later, and Harry was being handed a screaming infant.
“We were both drunk. He said his father had found him wife but he didn’t like her so he went to a bar. The bar I was at. One thing led to another, but neither of us can remember the night. He doesn’t know about it because he can’t remember. I didn’t tell him about Anton because, as I just said, he’s set to be married. Or was a year ago at least. Probably has a kid already too.”
Usually Harry was careful to only sleep with muggles; they didn’t know who he was after all, and, he found out later, were unable to impregnate him.
It was silent for a minute whale Draco processed this.
Eventually the brunette let Draco pull away, and not realising how much he’d been relying on the other to hold him up, immediately collapsed against the wall, smearing his release all over himself. He felt Draco’s juice drip from his wrecked hole, down his leg and onto the floor. Draco stood on shaky legs and just admired the image of a sexually ruined Harry Potter; weak kneed from release and thorough arse-fucking, and then to have his own spunk wiped over his body.
After many, many, identity crisises, Harry came to the conclusion he was, in fact, not romantically of sexually attracted to females. Ginny was more a sister than a girlfriend, and he realised he only really dated her because that was expected of him. Cho completely turned him off, and really he no other experiences. He had noticed however, when he was wracking his brain, the number of times he caught himself staring at the boys in the quidditch change rooms. Really, how hadn’t he noticed sooner?
The second time he awoke, he was given a list of the instructions; potions he had to take, food he had to avoid, that kind of stuff. Harry was already not particularly looking forward to this.
Harry winced. It sounded bad when he said it like that.
He finally settled on one owned by the Potters. It was called
Draco’s eyes latched on to Potter, adjusting his position often. He also noticed that Blaise’s eyes kept trailing to the Gryffindor. Draco’s eyebrows raised at the implications of his observation. Assuming this was supposed to be a secret he leant forward to whisper to his friend.
“Everyone sit down, this may take a while, and I’m still exhausted.” They all moved over to the couch.
, was here, in his arms.
Harry smiled. “I’m fine. I’ve been in one of the Potter properties I own. The reason I’ve been gone so long is due to a certain condition I dint want anyone finding out about until it was sorted. Erm… the couple of months after the Battle, I realised that I wasn’t interested in girls, so, I’m gay.”
He could tell the blond was getting ready to release, and prepared by relaxing his throat and moving his head forwards into the thrust. The cock slipped deeper down his throat until he was chocking and his nose was nestled into a patch of blond curls. Startled by the sudden deep throat, Draco released a strangled cry and came, shots of cum running down into Harry’s stomach. As his climax finished, he slowly withdrew, making sure the brunette wasn’t injured.
It worked for a while too. Until he accidentally got involved with someone who wasn’t quite a muggle.
“I should probably get going, sorry Draco. I need to pick up Anton. You can come with to see him, if you’d like?”
“Well not necessarily. He’s still single, though over the past year he has gotten noticeably sadder.his Mask hides it perfectly from all but me. I know exactly how he feels, and he always looked saddest after he sees the paper or a flyer stating you are missing. In fact, just last week, I popped in to see him, because I suppose we’re friends now? Anyway, I caught him writing letters addressed to you. He tried to hide them of course, but it didn’t work. You must also remember every pureblood family has a live family tree, so it is likely he already knows about Anton.”
Over the next four months, Harry made regular trips with Anton down to the town for some human contact. A couple of the villagers asked who and where the mother was, and Harry simply told them she didn’t stick around. By this point, Anton was showing signs of who he took after. He had Draco’s platinum-blond hair, but with the Potter curse, and had Harry’s eyes. He was quite the tiny thing, obviously going to be a lean man, and would have the Malfoy aristocratic features once he grew up.
Harry decided now he’d done his job, he was free to live how he wanted. In protest to the expectations of marrying and becoming an auror, he instead became heavily involved with clubbing in the muggle world. He was alive, he could party, alright? Once a week he’d go out, and once a week he’d return to someone’s house and have his brain’s fucked out, basically distracting himself from his responsibilities.
Harry winced. “It’s not just that but, you know Fred, then I dumped Ginny and I thought you wouldn’t want to see me.”
The weeks past with typical baby drama. Poop, sleep, eat, repeat. Anton, as much as he was a joy, screamed like a demon. Incredibly sleep deprived, Harry gave his son to Kreature to look after for a while so he could get some much needed rest. He woke up 12 hours later, and found his son happily babbling away to the centaur on the nursery wall. Kreature was dutifully watching him from the corner of the room.
