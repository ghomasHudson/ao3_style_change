Harry didn't know what to say. He couldn't find the words to say anything at all. Hermione, having waited for him to say something for a while, continued.
Harry said. "I just got fed up listening to their bickering."
The room fell silent. Ron was looking at Harry in shock, his mouth fully open, and Harry was looking defiantly back at him.
"Good", Ginny said back shortly. Harry could feel her eyes lingering on his face, clearly trying to understand why her boyfriend was acting so weirdly. "You look different", she notified. "Did you go shopping?"
of all people. He had been shocked and furious and even more after Draco had told him that they were getting married. And still, when Draco had asked his father to give him away at their wedding, Mr. Malfoy hadn't declined, no matter how much he disliked Harry.
the idea, so..."
Harry was staring after his now ex-girlfriend, a hand pressed against his burning cheek. He had already been pushed to the floor and hit his head because of it, he had been punched by Draco, and now he had been slapped by Ginny... What a perfect start for a new term... Also, he could imagine Draco crying his eyes out at the moment, thinking that Harry had only been using him in a cruel, twisted way... The thought was killing him, and...
"It has, and you can blame it on yourself", Draco said back.
Harry nodded. "I did. What about you, did you find what you went looking for?"
"How the hell is it possible that the
"I can't believe it! Who is he and what has he done to my boyfriend?" Hermione chuckled, putting her hand over her mouth.
"And I got to talk to Ginny", he finally added, lowering his gaze towards his feet. Malfoy, instead, turned to him. "I have to apologize for being an arse to her."
Harry's heart skipped a beat. "What?" he asked, finally getting up and turning his head to glance at the other man.
"Malfoy, I... I don't know what to say", he sighed quietly. "It's not that I'm ashamed of you..."
"Let's get to the point", Harry sighed. "I'm with Ginny and what happened last night can
"Why?" Theo managed to ask before Draco, looking at his boyfriend with a questioning look on his face.
"Of course you didn't want to hurt her. But trust me, she'll get over it in time."
Narcissa Malfoy, wearing an expensive looking grey dress, was sitting at the front of course, her sister Andromeda Tonks sitting on her other side with Harry's godson Teddy next to her. The chair at the other side of Draco's mom was still empty. Narcissa noticed him looking and flashed a very Draco-like smile at him. Harry quickly smiled back nervously before his eyes kept travelling again.
. Every time he saw the blond Slytherin walking past him he remembered how his body had felt pressed against his. Every time Malfoy looked at him he remembered how his grey eyes had been filled with lust and something else that night. And when Malfoy was talking to him or laughing with his Slytherin friends, Harry remembered very clearly what kind of things those lips had been whispering to him that time. All the memories were enough to make him come almost every night by his own hand.
Ginny raised her eyebrow. "So?" she asked nonchalantly. Harry frowned.
"No", he quickly answered, lowering his gaze at his glass which he was still holding in his hand. "I tried yesterday, but she said she was busy."
"Merlin, Draco. This must have cost a fortune", Harry said, lowering his gaze back to the watch, admiring it. "I can't believe you'd go and buy me something like this..."
"He's fine", Draco answered with a smirk, running his fingers through his now almost shoulder length platinum locks. "I know this might come as a shock to all of you but he wasn't too happy to hear about our engagement."
The Slytherin finally turned to face him. "Decision?" he repeated, looking tense.
"Uh..."
"STOP INTERRUPTING ME!" Harry yelled, finally jumping up too. He struck his fist against the table with force, face red. He had really blown up this time. He was so glad they were alone in the common room.
"Yeah", Harry said. "It was time for me to renew my wardrobe." He forked the last bite from his plate and emptied his glass, swallowing hard.
In a flash the blond was already in the air, flying away fast. Harry soon followed Malfoy on his own broomstick, catching up to him almost instantly.
Ron looked glad that at least Harry seemed to believe him. "Well... there was some bed creaking... I also heard some moaning", he said quietly, cheeks reddening. "Then it stopped and I heard Theodore talk."
The other man finally pulled away and immediately muttered out another spell, very quietly but still loudly enough for Draco to hear it. They were both already good at wordless magic, but they always spoke the spells out loud in bed so that the other one would know what was going on and what was going to come.
"Good", Malfoy said quickly, steering his gaze towards the bar counter again. "After breakfast again?"
are out of your fucking mind, Harry", George said, but he had a warm grin on his face. "But I'm happy for you anyway."
What the hell was wrong with him?! He quickly turned to stare at his glass and took a big swig from it. He
" he said self-evidently. "How would I be able to miss when she was trying her best to get to ride your dick on that couch, right in front of my very eyes." There was once again that bitter tone in his voice and he paused before adding: "What I'm trying to say here is... are you
"Yes, I
"Godric's Hollow", Harry answered. Draco raised his eyebrow questioningly and Harry added: "To see my parents."
"No, I wasn't, but you shouldn't make any conclusions-"
"Malfoy, your mom is not
Draco cried with pleasure as Harry started pounding against his bottom rhythmically, steering the slender body against the thrusts. The Slytherin's hands and legs were wrapped around him and Harry moved one of his own hands to Draco's cock again, pumping it in the same beat.
"You know what I mean", Harry sighed. "This thing between us... it just isn't working anymore. I know it, you know it. And everyone else knows it too."
Draco buried his face to Greg's shirt again, gripping his friend even more tightly, thinking. What the hell, there was no reason to try and gloss things over. They would hear all about it anyway, sooner or later...
stop treating her like shit", Ron interfered. "It's my little sister we're talking about and I don't want you to hurt her." He had a strict look on his face when he continued: "If you don't want to be with her, just say it."
"Draco, you didn't...", he started, before realizing another thing. "This was the one you had to go buy on your own?"
doing here?" Ron had hissed at first but Hermione had immediately nudged at him to shut him up.
"You better not", Draco said back, before kissing Harry.

do that", he said tiredly after catching Harry up. "But even if he'd be with me, he'd never love me, you know, not really..."
"Yeah, the one I've told you about, Grimmauld Place", Harry explained. "But uh... I guess I can still change my plans and stay here. That's fine. Unless..." His eyes widened a bit as he came up with a different solution.
The Slytherin turned to glance at him, frowning. "How?" he asked.
Ron raised one of his eyebrows. "I thought you're coming
As soon as Draco had finished, Harry took a step closer and wrapped his arms around him. Draco hugged him back, and Harry pressed many quick kisses to the other man's flushed cheeks before they finally parted so that the ceremony could go on.
However, as the night went by, Harry started to notice that the Slytherin caught many other's eyes as well. Some people even came to hit on Draco and Harry felt a rush of possessiveness overflowing him. He hadn't considered himself that jealous of a type before, but Draco awakened completely new feelings in him, both good and bad, it seemed.
notice you. That night was the first time I dreamt about you." He had a gentle smile on his lips.
"But I didn't do anything!" Theodore shouted. "It was your Golden Boy who-"
"Right", Malfoy answered. They started walking towards the castle side by side.
Draco gave a quick, impassive look at Harry, who was staring at him in exasperation, arms crossed.
However, in the afternoon he could no longer avoid Malfoy.
Harry stared at the Slytherin who was still avoiding looking him in the eyes. It was still so weird to hear Malfoy say sorry about
"Many people have said that I look a lot like my father", he said quietly, wanting to break the long silence between them some way.
Harry's cheeks heated up a bit. "Ron heard you when he came back from the bathroom at night", he said. "He said he heard you moaning and some bed creaking and he was certain that you two were-"
"I'm not a heartless bastard, Theodore", Harry said icily. "I care about him!"
"Yeah", Harry said with a nod. "I really am sorry, Malfoy. We won't talk about your personal business anymore. Seriously."
"It's... decent", the Slytherin answered in his common, belittling way, but Harry wasn't fooled. He smiled again, his eyes following as every piece of food on Draco's plate slowly disappeared to the Slytherin's mouth. Seeing the other man wolfing down the dinner he had prepared warmed his heart.
"It's been a hell of a month", Harry said, giving a tired, sad sigh. "I've been working my arse off every single day. Continuously overworking, but still no success at all. Everyone expecting me to be the one to catch him, because I'm the Saviour of the Wizarding World. You have no idea about the pressure I've been under."
Harry gave a sigh. "I... I don't know what to say... Can't we just... at least try to forget about yesterday and... be friends again?"
First of all, Harry found himself spending much more time with Malfoy than he had used to before. They went flying together. They went for walks together. They’d even started studying together. Sometimes they were with Ron and Hermione or some others, sometimes it was just the two of them alone. Anyway, they were really spending a huge amount of time together. "You're almost spending more time with him than with us", Ron had pointed out one day, and Harry had to admit to himself that it was true. It seemed like they were finally becoming friends, Malfoy and him.
aren't the sharpest tool in the box, are you, Potter?" Malfoy sighed in amusement. "Let me spell it out for you." He started to speak slowly, like he was talking to a very small child. "You, me, flying, tomorrow. After breakfast? Sound like a plan to you?"
Draco was still looking at the closed photo album. "I always hated watching you with her", he said quietly. "If that happens again..."
"Well, thank goodness to that!" Malfoy sighed in relief.
Before Harry realized what was happening, Ginny had already closed the gap between them and pressed their lips together. They kissed for a while until Harry pulled away. He didn't know what to answer. He did want Ginny to stay, but...
"Actually... I was going to keep this to myself but I guess I should tell you", Ron said, almost whispering. It was finally long waited Friday evening and they were eating dinner in the Great Hall. "I think I heard them last night when I had to go use the bathroom."
Draco gave him a morose glare. "Are you fucking kidding me?" he snorted. "
Draco didn't say anything, but Harry knew he was listening.
that Malfoy knew. He saw Malfoy staring at him from the other side of the hall but instead of responding, Harry again decided to concentrate on simply eating and laughing with his girlfriend and friends.
When Draco finally opened his eyes, he found Harry watching him with a fond, dreamy look in his green, glimmering eyes.
"I still can't stand him", Ginny said icily, settling down on the same chair that Malfoy had been sitting on earlier.
"Draco", Harry said amicably, lifting his hand to the Slytherin's shoulder. "Listen-"
Having spent at least quarter of an hour vomiting he finally returned to his own bed, making sure to close the curtains tight. Ron was still snoring boisterously but Harry had no chance of sleep anyway. He was lying on his stomach, drenching his pillow with tears.
Malfoy immediately stopped walking. So did Harry. There was an awkward silence between them for a while.
However, Harry had to admit that unlike him, Malfoy was an actual expert at Potions and in many other subjects too. He was very smart, precise and diligent when it came to studying. He was able to concentrate very well during classes and his notes and homework were always neat and systematic, and his grades excellent.
of all people. That you want to spend the rest of your life with
Malfoy was sitting on the couch, staring at the flames dancing in the fireplace. Maybe due to his drunken state Harry thought it was a great idea to join the other man, and so he did. Malfoy gave him a contemptuous look.
"Okay", was all he managed to say.
Malfoy seemed a bit relieved. "They were too tired", he sneered.
"Damn you, Draco", he finally breathed after a minute or two. "This is
You said it yourself already", Malfoy answered with a cold sneer. "Your girl hates me."
sex and who had never been able to get enough of Draco before, had just rejected him. That had never happened before the whole time that hey had been together... and they had already been together for nearly a year and a half.
"What the hell?! Were you listening to us that night?!" Harry yelped.
Harry noticed a melancholic look in the Slytherin's eyes and immediately got worried. "What do you mean your mom's not well?" he asked carefully. "You don't mean she's..."
"Why? Did something happen?" Harry asked, now the slightest bit curious.
The other man shrugged, lowering his gaze. "I don't know... There are many reasons... I've been an arse to you ever since we were kids... You've always been after girls, not guys... You're the man who killed Voldemort, so you could have anyone... Why would you want
Draco just stared at him for a while until a tiny, uneasy smile appeared on his lips too. "Uh... thanks, Harry", he said.
lying!" Ron exclaimed immediately.
Draco reached the living room, bending down to give Harry a quick kiss on the lips. "Hi", he said.
Malfoy was staring at the cloak in his hand. "Right... I forgot you got one. But..." There was a short pause. "Are we
sex. Merlin, this was
It was a fact that Ginny didn't like Harry spending so much time with Malfoy. Even though she had learned to stand the Slytherin just a little bit better (just because Ron and Hermione had forgiven him too and talked her into it), she still didn't like him and didn't want to spend any time in the same group if Malfoy was around at the time. She still kept trying to demean Malfoy and was often trying to make Harry cancel his plans with him by demanding Harry to see her instead, but Harry didn't agree to it. He did spend time with her too but he wasn't ready to give up any time spent with Malfoy either to do so.
Draco shook his head. "No... At first I was thinking of visiting Azkaban during the Christmas break and telling him in person but I don't know how he'll take the news, so..."
He heard footsteps and glanced to his side, trembling. He had gotten company.
Next few weeks changed many things.
Malfoy closed his mouth, still smiling. He was caressing his lower lip with his little finger and Harry trembled. He remembered Malfoy running his lips against Harry's neck in his dream. Oh Merlin...
"Where are you going?" Draco asked and followed Harry to the hallway when he saw him pulling his coat on again.
"Ginny, what are you- nnnngh!"
"I didn't see you lock it", Harry said doubtfully.
"Don't even think about it", Harry said, cutting off the Slytherin's sentence. "It's the one you chose for me. I'd never return it."
He could see Draco smirking and hear their old classmate's quiet laughter in the hall.
He lifted his gaze to meet Harry's again, and was surprised to find a sudden, lecherous glint in the other man's green eyes. He knew that look all too well.
"You really did", Draco said in a cold tone. Though he was relieved that Harry hadn't been cheating on him, he was still feeling bitter having been treated like that, having been taken for granted for weeks. "Do you have any idea how many nights I cried myself to sleep because of you?"
But he doesn't care, he doesn't give a
"We can't help you if you won't even tell us what's happened", Greg said in a calming tone.
me, Potter!" Theodore cursed, trying to kick him off.
Harry's heart was overflowing with love. He couldn't believe it. They were finally married. He had married Draco Malfoy.
"May I…?" Hermione asked, pointing towards his bed. After Harry's quick nod, she sat next to him. There was a short, awkward silence between them.
", Harry said quickly, flashing a gentle smile. "She's just become
"Malfoy, I was wondering", he blurted out. "It's Friday…"
"Just ignore him", Draco said negligently.
"Really?" Harry managed to gasp.
"Yeah, right", Harry said. Right, Ginny. After the war they had continued on with their relationship, because that was the right thing to do, right? Everyone had expected them to get together again and Harry hoped to get married and have kids someday. Ginny was a good girlfriend. Of course she had her own faults, but so did everyone.
Saturday evening passed by quickly and in a flash it was already Sunday morning. They were having breakfast at the Great Hall and Harry's thoughts were already on what was coming next. Of all people, he would go flying with Malfoy. They had planned to be heading straight to Quidditch pitch after they'd finished their breakfast.
"Well
"I would do anything for you, Draco", he said quietly.
in the future... And now, all of a sudden...
"Night", Harry said back.
"Is that what this is about?!" he finally asked. "Draco, I... I don't know what you are talking about, but... I swear that I have
it!" he defended. "It just happened."
It took him almost an hour before in the end he just ended up buying her a large silver hair clasp and a box of different chocolates. As he was walking along the street towards the place they had agreed to meet with Draco, he suddenly slowed down. Shit. He hadn't bough anything for Draco yet.
"Unless?"
Ginny repeated. "What do you mean it doesn't feel right? I'm your girlfriend, Harry! How can it not
Harry's body was shaking of restrained laughter. "Because they are actors, Draco", he finally said. "It's just a TV show. They get paid for making these shows."
He bowed his head down again, burying his face into his hands and starting to sob again, and all his friends were looking at him with sad faces for a long while in silence. No one seemed to know what they were supposed to say or do to make him feel better.
"Well, I'm free tonight and I was just thinking… Would you like to go somewhere tonight… with me?" Harry said, this time more clearly.
Deep in his thoughts he walked through the door, entering the library. He quickly went to return the books he had borrowed earlier and was already about to leave again, when he took another glance backwards and…
"Are you
"Arsehole!
Harry turned his back on his best friend, sighing quietly. If only Ron knew the truth about his so-called "nightmares…"
"Nah, no problem", Goyle answered with a small grin. "At least I got more space now."
Malfoy's smile had faded away. "I know", he said, not looking at him anymore. "It was… wrong. I was trying my best to piss you off intentionally. As always." They were both quiet until the Slytherin spoke again. "Sorry about that", he apologized to Harry's surprise, looking very uneasy. "I shouldn't have said those things."
"I just... want to know if you'd want to...
"Cunt!"
Harry couldn't believe it. Hermione really was ready to try act friendly with Draco Malfoy. "Ginny's not as compassionate as you are", he noted, grimacing.
Harry was shocked. He didn't understand. What the hell had happened? Malfoy shaking like that… Harry could feel anger rising inside him.
"Yeah...", Harry mumbled. Once again he found his drunken eyes wandering on the Slytherin's slim body for a little too long and he quickly turned towards the bar counter again. "You having fun?" he managed to ask.
"Years."
wanted to do those things. The alcohol in his blood had only made it worse, but it had not been the only reason for it.
Harry laughed. Ron and Hermione, who had come to visit him at 12 Grimmauld Place, had just heard from him that Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini were now dating and Ron, of course, couldn't get over it.
"I will tell him later", Harry said. "After I've left Ginny. I promise!"
Harry frowned. "That's not true", he said stubbornly, folding his arms across his chest. "I just had a bad day, it had nothing to do with her. I do want to be with her."
Finally, after taking his time vomiting and then brushing his teeth afterwards, Harry left the bathroom and was about to go to their bedroom when he heard a sudden, loud noise coming from the common room. The portrait door had opened and closed.
Just thinking about that dream now, in the middle of the night in silence… it was making him aroused right away. Blimey, he just couldn't resist…
"No need to worry. I’ve already gotten used to it, you know, so there’s no need to feel embarrassed about it. It was weird at first but I don’t mind at all.” He gave Harry a supportive smile. ”I’m happy that you two got back together after the war.”
They both remained quiet for a while, simply staring at the flames, until Harry finally spoke.
"Shithead!"
They both chuckled.
Draco turned sideways to Harry, setting his coat on the rack, chuckling by himself at Harry's reaction.
Harry flashed him an apologetic smile. "I apologize, Draco, but to tell the truth, I'm also glad. If he hadn't been an arse to you, we probably wouldn't be here now. And… I was dead jealous of you that night."
in his arms, leaning against him and trying to seduce him?
"But you didn't tell them about
Harry shook his head. "Tell me about it..." He flashed a grin at the other man. "You're still an arse, though. But I'm tired of fighting, so..."
"So you went flying today, huh?"
"Well… Kind of", Malfoy answered. "I gotta admit that Weasley's not as bad as I always thought… He's drunk and still annoying but he's… okay, I guess. Who would have thought."
The portrait door leading to their common room suddenly turned around and Harry saw Malfoy coming in, followed closely by Theodore Nott.
"What?! Dudley? You're joking, right?" Ron asked, chuckling.
Harry stood up too but didn't leave yet. He once again found himself staring. Malfoy slowly unbuttoned his black shirt and pulled it off, revealing his skinny body and skin as pale as the moon.
"Well...", Harry muttered, suddenly feeling uncertain. Malfoy's indifference about the matter was hurting him much more than he wanted to admit. "I thought there was quite a lot to talk about..."
No. No one would know about last night. He'd have to make it very clear to Malfoy. Of course he didn't want to believe that Malfoy would go around telling people about it, because Malfoy wanted to protect
However, as he finished his sentence his lips turned to a smile, and Draco's eyes lingered on them. Damn how much he loved that smile and those beautiful heart shaped lips of Harry's.
Hermione, however, was still watching Harry and seemed to hesitate for a while before speaking. ”What’s on your mind, Harry?”
"Why do you think?!" Harry snapped back.
"No, you
"...So you went there and got drunk. Again!" Ginny snapped. It was clear that she was not in an understanding mood. "Were you alone?"
Ginny looked disappointed, but got up.
Ginny seemed a little confused because of Harry's tone, but didn't take her arm off of Harry's shoulders. "I missed you so much", she said. "Did you get my present?"
"Stop... you
Draco froze. Trying to grasp what had just happened and to stay calm, he asked as casually as he could: "Why? What's wrong?"
Malfoy let out a cold laugh. "Go ahead", he said nonchalantly. "I wish you good luck with that marriage." He crossed his arms across his chest, looking away from him.
"Clubbing", he finally said, as haughtily as he possibly could. He would not show any weakness in front of Harry.
"Only with you, too", Malfoy said, causing Harry's eyes to widen. "No one else before tonight..."
There was no doubt about it. "Who would send me something like -"
It was almost the pub's closing time when Harry was finally slowly making his way back towards the castle... with Malfoy. Goyle had left earlier, although he had still been a bit doubtful about leaving the two of them behind with each other. Harry didn't mind at all. He and Malfoy had actually had fun time together, chatting and laughing with each other. It had almost felt like they were friends. Maybe alcohol had affected a bit too, since they had still ordered some more drinks after Goyle had left. They were both quite drunk.
"There's nothing funny about it!" Malfoy snarled. "Imagine Weasley being gay and then suddenly he had the hots for you?!"
Harry's eyes were still shut as he caressed the smooth surface of Ginny's underpants with his fingers, trying to think about
", Ginny said and quickly wrapped her arm around her boyfriend. "You
"I know, Draco", Harry said, lifting his hand on the other man's shoulder. "
Theodore Nott and Draco Malfoy were both tall and good looking young men. They were often hanging out, laughing at each others jokes, teasing each other... If they both were gay, they really would make a great match. He could almost imagine the two of them together, cuddling on the sofa, Malfoy moving his fingers gently through Theodore's darkbrown hair, looking at him with those stormy grey eyes of his...
"Nothing's wrong, baby", Harry said quietly, gently caressing his hand with his fingers. "Just tired, need to sleep."
Unlike Malfoy.
"… Even so, I guess I'd like to be friends too", Malfoy continued. He paused for a while, turning his head towards the lake again. "It's not going to happen, though", he said, staring far to the distance.
want to tell them. Besides, Hermione already knows, so..."
He quickly turned around, making his way towards the exit, glancing backwards once. To his surpise he saw Malfoy looking back at him with a slightly wistful look on his pale face before he left the library.
"Yeah! Teach him a lesson!" Theo encouraged right after.
The next two minutes Draco was gasping and moaning as Harry kept preparing him with dedication. Damn but it felt good. The first time that Harry had prepared him with his tongue he had only been extremely embarrassed, but now he had gotten used to it, even though they hadn't done it too often. It did feel wonderful and he absolutely loved it.
"I know he's done horrible things, okay!" he said. "He tried his best to make my life hell for years! But he was a child then. Just a child who was raised by his parents to hate muggles, raised to be a bully... and as for the Death Eater thing, he was
"I've heard it a thousand times already", Malfoy said, rolling his eyes again. "Do you ever stop?"
", Malfoy finally said after few minutes of silence between them, with the exception of their quills rustling against their own parchments. Harry heard the Slytherin close his Potions book and wrap up his parchment. He himself was still writing, trying to come up with a good way to finish his own essay. Malfoy was yawning behind him and Harry was almost certain that he felt his eyes on his back.
One Friday afternoon at the start of December, Harry once again found himself studying with a certain Slytherin after classes. This time they were at Malfoy's room, Malfoy lying on his own bed on his stomach and Harry sitting at his desk, back towards the Slytherin, finishing their Potions essays together.
that would get him in the mood. He found it very disturbing that there was no bulge to be found, just flatness, nothing to free and grasp no matter how much he tried to search for it.
"I don't know", Harry said with a heavy sigh. His eyes were filling with tears again, just thinking about Draco and how long the man had secretly wanted him, just to get his heart broken by him. "But it doesn't matter anymore... He hates me and never wants me near him again. So what are you waiting for? It's your chance to steal him."
"I know", Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "You just spent the last few hours eating her face in front of my eyes, trying to prove how straight you are."
like he is", Ron said simply, shrugging. "He could be lying, you know... Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is lying."
Theodore shook his head. "We just came from there", he said.
"I know", the Slytherin said again.
"Damn I've missed this", he heard Harry saying as well and opened his eyes to find the emerald green eyes looking deep into his own as he was moving slowly inside.
Harry read the card three times, staring at the neat handwriting of his girlfriend. Finally he slipped the card in between the pages and closed the album, putting it away without looking at the rest of the pictures.
What was he
There was a hesitant, kind of shy look in the Slytherin's eyes before he very quietly murmured: "I'm feeling a little oblivious tonight… I think I might forget to lock my door."
me to come here!"
"No, don't be. It's… it's alright", Harry found himself babbling. "It's ok really. Yeah… Some other time then… I guess."
"Aaaand... it's...
He rolled them around again and moved his hands lower on the other man's body, finally getting rid of his underwear. Draco's member was soon freed and he wrapped his fingers around it, loving the feeling of it in his hand. He was so excited of finally getting what he had been dreaming of for a long time.
Harry hesitated for a short while. "Well, I just came from flying... but yes, I guess I could join you. I'll just go get changed real quickly, okay?"
Harry and Malfoy couldn't get enough of each other. They kept kissing eagerly, hands travelling everywhere on each others bodies, caressing and groping each other. Place, time and everything else was fading away as they kept firmly pawing at each other, trying to release all their pent-up sexual tension.
"My head has been nothing but a mess after the war", Harry continued. "And I really am sorry to have involved you in this too..."
"I will teach him a lesson", Draco said, his lips curving up into a diabolic grin. "He will regret messing with me."
Harry once again moved his hand up to caress Draco's face gently with his fingers, and Draco lifted his gaze again, his stormy grey eyes meeting Harry's green ones. This time he didn't push Harry away.
Hermione nodded. "You do that. And I'll talk to Ron", she said, followed by a short laugh. "He won't be happy about it but I'll try my best." She paused before she still continued: "And you should also talk to Ginny, you know… Try to sort things out with her, right?"
Now that it was over, Harry was suddenly feeling awkward. He was staring at the ceiling again, his brain unable to work out everything that had happened, but one thing was clear: he had just had his first real sexual experience with someone else and of all the possible people it had happened with none other than Draco Malfoy. Just thinking about it was so crazy. He was Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and he could have almost any girl he wanted, and still he had ended up doing it with another man. He had done it with
"Nicely", he found himself answering curtly, avoiding eye contact, before taking another sip of his coffee.
"We have gathered here today to witness a unique moment in the lives of Harry and Draco. Today they join their lives in the union of marriage. To all their guests: they are happy to share this moment with you. They have known you for many years. You watched them grow up, you went to school with them, or you worked with them. That is the reason why you are the ones to share this once-in-a-lifetime moment with them."
Malfoy sneered, finally turning to face him. "Oh,
Draco was sitting on the edge of his bed and staring at the painting as Harry walked in. Harry swallowed, closed the door and slowly walked to the bed, landing to sit next to the Slytherin. The other man didn't turn to look at Harry.
and-"
Harry unwrapped the other one of the remaining packages, revealing what was a small photo album inside. Wrinkling his brows a little he opened it and the tiny smile on his face instantly faded away.
"Of course I want to be with her!" Harry snapped. "Don't be stupid, Ron."
"Okay, okay. I get it", Harry said quickly and waited until Malfoy calmed down again.
"No wonder if Ginny's had enough of me for good...", he mumbled. "I even scared myself today."
Goyle was already adjusting the last pieces of his accessories on their places. "That's it", he finally said. "Finished."
"When we get back to Hogwarts!" Harry snapped back, finally losing his temper too. "Like I've already told you!"
The more wine they ingested the more they kept glancing at each other and exchanging significant looks, and Harry had a strong suspicion that the moment they would close the door of 12 Grimmauld Place, magic was going to happen. Again.
Ron, of course, repeatedly kept adding fuel to the fire.
Then, suddenly, the Slytherin decided to roll them over so it was Malfoy lying on top now. Their mouths crashed against each other's again and they kissed hungrily. Harry lowered his hands to Malfoy's lower body at the same time, starting to shamelessly squeeze his buttocks that were still covered by very expensive looking white satin pyjamas.
"Yeah", Harry answered.
Theodore was standing at the door leading to the bedroom corridor.
", Harry breathed in shock, immediately realizing the situation he was in. He instantly pushed Ginny away from him. "This isn't what it looks like.
"Then turn around", he said, making the Slytherin glance at him with a slightly confused look on his face. "I want to see your face", Harry explained.
of you. Now", he breathed against Malfoys lips, biting them. He couldn't take it anymore. He needed to feel Malfoy completely, he needed to be inside this stunning man right now. He needed to know what it would be like for real, mere dreams were not enough. Besides, Malfoy had already said that he wanted Harry as well and he was more than ready to fulfill the other man's wish.
"You mean we have to do everything here by ourselves?" Draco ensured.
Harry turned his head, their eyes meeting. "How do you know all this?" he asked.
He had learned that the Slytherin hadn't had an easy childhood. Lucius had been a very strict father and had raised his son in quite a twisted way, and in the end Draco had been forced to get the dark mark and do terrible things that he’d never wanted to do. Harry couldn't forget the way his former enemy had been shaking and even crying in front of the whole court, so afraid that he would be sent straight to Azkaban. Harry had started to feel bad for Malfoy and he was happy to have been able to help him get rid of the charges with his statements. Then, a few days after the trial, he had received a very short letter from his former enemy:
"Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't know about that...", Harry said, setting his hand on Malfoy's shoulder.
"Dean, Seamus, Pansy...
Harry gave a quick nod, his eyes resting on the other man's.
Harry kept glancing at the clock on the wall. 10, 11, 12... and still no sign of the two. Harry knew that all the pubs at Hogsmeade were already closed, they usually closed at 11…
of your business", Harry said dryly.
Harry held the Slytherin even closer against him, keeping his eyes tightly closed, and fully concentrated his thoughts to his room. It only took few flashes before they had already apparated to Sirius's old bedroom at the fourth floor, falling to the bed and kissing each other even more eagerly than before.
Draco also often saw Harry staring distractedly into emptiness for a good long while, and he couldn't help wondering what it was that he was thinking then. Was it work stuff? Or was it something else... or
What did it even matter if Malfoy was more than friends with Theodore? Malfoy could do whatever he wanted, it had nothing to do with Harry. After all, they weren’t even friends. So why did he care?
"Right", Malfoy said tonelessly. Harry couldn't see his face because he was still staring towards the door.
They kissed again, and Draco's heart was filled with love and joy. Only an hour ago he had thought he had lost everything, and now... Merlin, he couldn't be happier.
"Draco, you are amazing", Harry whispered roughly against the skin of the Slytherin's neck. He was slamming his hips faster and faster against the other man's bottom, sinking deep inside him, his right hand rubbing the blond's cock at the same time.
sure about this? You do know there's no going back after -"
He didn't notice Hermione's concerned stare fixed on him as he tried to continue eating his lunch.
"I don't need your pity, Potter", Malfoy grunted right away, not looking at him. Instead, he was staring at the floor.
"Have you always been wandering around the castle at nights like this, Potter?" Malfoy suddenly asked, breaking the long silence between them.
"Yes", Harry answered. "But that doesn't change anything."
”Well, I think we already know the answer to that”, Ron said and Harry turned to look at him.
"Malfoy... What's up?" Harry asked as casually as he could in the current situation.
"Where
he'd do that.
Harry was starting to get annoyed too. "Why can't you just answer the question?"
Hermione, however, didn't seem shocked like Ron. She seemed to be taking Harry's news pretty well.
Harry wrapped his arms tightly around the Slytherin, apparating them back to Grimmauld Place.
Draco leaned closer and they shared a long, mind blowing kiss in the middle of the street, not giving a damn if someone would look at them with disapproval.
life…"
"I'm not obsessed", he repeated. "I'm just worried."
Harry and Draco gasped at the same time.
is my business!" Harry was shouting at him, and now that they were so close, Draco could see tears gathering in his eyes. "You are telling me
"I would have done that already, if you hadn't -" he heard yet another footsteps and turned his head to the right, seeing Theodore standing two meters away from them, shaking his head with a crooked smile on his lips. "What the hell are you smiling at?!" he snapped.
He didn't know what exactly the Slytherin wanted of him, he had no clue, but Harry was pretty sure that it was not just talking, and he was desperate to know…
Harry waited for few minutes before following, soon standing at Malfoy's door. He was going to knock first but didn't want anyone else to hear, so he decided to try if the door was already open. It was, at least for him.
Everything really was different now that Voldemort was finally gone. Hogwarts had been rebuilt and they were back for their extra and final year, 8th grade, trying to finish their studies. Not all of them had returned so there were much fewer of them. Harry, Hermione and Ron had skipped the whole last year, so they were back, of course.
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other.
Harry could feel his cock starting to harden inside his pants and he was so grateful to be wearing a cloak to hide it. Malfoy would never know how aroused he was at the moment.
"They
"What? I am with Ginny", Harry said back.
Draco looked surprised, a tiny, unsure smile rising to his lips too. "Really?" he asked.
gay, which he wasn't, he would never choose to be with Harry.
"But I want to", the Slytherin said. "Harry... In the end you saved me from the Fiendfyre. And when you defeated Voldemort... God damn it, how powerful, fearless, and most of all
Harry gulped. Oh, right. He had forgotten that his friends weren't used to him being on first name terms with Draco.
the one who needs to spend time with you."
Under Malfoy's intense stare, Harry could feel his heart starting to beat a little faster and he could feel the butterflies in his stomach again... God damnit.
"I just wanted to...", Harry started, hesitating. "Well, it's been a while since we've talked, so I thought-"
Harry hesitated for a while. He glanced at the other side of the Great Hall and startled when he noticed Malfoy glaring at them. Yeah, he would certainly be going with Ginny. Harry quickly turned to her, smiled broadly and said: "Yeah, let's do that." Ginny smiled back and they kissed.
Draco was shaking his head, mouth slightly open. "That's twisted", he said, turning his eyes towards the remote control again. "What else is there?"
Draco, whose eyes were already all red and puffy from crying so much last night, closed the door behind him and buried his face in his hands, immediately bursting out crying again.
Harry let out a short, warm laugh. "Draco, don't even think that I will ever let you go. That will never happen", he said, moving his fingers lightly against the Slytherin's spine.
Ginny repeatedly cutting him off and her cold attitude towards Malfoy were starting to make Harry angry. Why couldn't she just listen to what Harry had to say?
"What time is it?" Harry heard the Slytherin ask.
"So what?" Malfoy cut him off, waspishly. "I barely even noticed."
"You're IN LOVE with
have some sick fantasies, ’Mione", Ron groaned but he had a soft smile on his lips. "Just shut up." He pulled his girlfriend closer and silenced her with a kiss.
"I'm not
"Why?" Malfoy turned around and asked slowly, sounding very tense.
"Not tonight...", Harry said in the dim bedroom. There was an apologetic, melancholic tone in his voice.
Harry, soon you'll know what it feels like", the Slytherin said to Harry in a teasing voice, moving and twisting his fingers at the same time. Harry gasped under him, and the blond continued: "I'm gonna give it to you so
"What's so funny?" Malfoy asked, somewhere in between being amused and irritated.
They took a very long, relaxing shower together, once again being all over each other: first only washing, then kissing, then groping, and finally masturbating each other under the running hot water.
He was not allowed to feel this way! He was in a relationship with Ginny, and he had cheated on her tonight. How could he have let this happen... It was a different matter
"It might not be final", Harry said. "We just need to think if this is going anywhere so it's the best solution for now. It is possible that we'll still carry on but... who knows." He took a more comfortable posture, resting his head against the back of the couch. He could feel Malfoy staring at him. "It's just too bad that we made the decision today."
"And I
Malfoy didn't say a word. Cheeks burning of embarrasment and confusion Harry quickly headed to the door and opened it, seeing Hermione standing right in front of him.
Malfoy still didn't look at him and Harry wasn't even sure if he was listening to him anymore. He had really ruined everything.
he heard Ginny's voice say again as she was getting up too. "You can't...
Ten minutes later they had apparated to Harry's bedroom and Harry was lying on the bed on his stomach, totally naked, Draco's two long fingers already deep inside him. Until that day, Harry had only topped so it was the first time he was being the bottom and while it felt very weird and embarrassing it
"Yeah", Greg agreed, an apologetic look on his face. "He is an idiot, Draco, and you deserve someone much better than him."
Ron was looking at him with a blank face. "So, does that mean... you want to... break up with her?" he asked slowly.
Malfoy let out a heavy sigh. "Oh for Salazar's sake, what kind of person do you think I am", he said, shaking his head. "No, I haven't told anyone."
"They get paid for kissing and..." Draco paused, his cheeks turning slightly red as the couple started to lessen each other's clothes as well. "...making out in front of everyone?"
Harry's throat felt like it was being strangled again. Looking at the gorgeous man in his arms and knowing that he'd never be able to hold him like this anymore was killing him. He'd have to continue as a friend, to pretend he didn't feel this way. He had learned to care so much for the man but he didn't want Malfoy to push him away like he had done with Theodore. No, that was not going to happen. He would be a friend for Malfoy, hang out with him as a friend, offer him a shoulder to lean on if he needed one… that's all. That way he wouldn't ruin everything.
"But still you didn't say anything to me after we went back to school", Harry pointed out.
Harry didn't ask any more questions. Without asking, he pulled his own wand from his pocket, starting to help the two Slytherins.
? Merlin, what had he done?
"You're right about that", Harry admitted. "But she can’t tell me what to do. I do what I want."
"Life is full of surprises. Sometimes love happens in the least expected ways", Rivers continued. "This is what happened for Harry and Draco. Who would have thought that years of hatred would turn into a blossoming love? Love is unpredictable, it just happens so unexpectedly, so suddenly, without our control."
"Ginny's been missing you, you know", Ron suddenly said, breaking the silence. "She's been pretty upset for not hearing anything about you."
"Oh please!" Draco snorted. "Don't tell me you actually thought that I wouldn't find out?!"
Malfoy's face darkened. His good mood was now totally gone. "What?!" he snarled. "Who told you stuff like
He saw a tiny smile on the other man's lips as he put the watch on his left wrist, still admiring it for a while before turning to face the other man again.
Harry was rarely in his old cheerful mood anymore as he returned home from work. Instead, over time he had become less and less talkative, absent-minded, cranky, and even more short-tempered than he already inherently was. They argued a lot more than before, they would yell at each other about small worthless things that didn't really matter at all, and one time Harry got so mad at him that he stormed out of the house, slammed the door shut behind him, and only returned after few hours, totally wasted.
Anyway, as said, things had changed a lot. For both good and bad.

she asked.
"Well I'm pretty sure they were. You weren't there, Hermione!" Ron countered.
make sure you'll never want any girl."
Harry turned the Slytherin around to see better. "...those-"
Ginny!" Harry snapped at her as soon as he was standing again. His head was still spinning wildly and everything was a bit blurry. "You've ruined everything!"
"I'm sorry, okay?!" Harry grunted. "I
"Yes", Harry answered as confidently as he could, but in reality he was already feeling stressed just thinking about it. "Right after I've left Ginny."
"I haven't been
"No worries", Harry reassured immediately, flashing a blissfull smile at his girlfriend. "Glad to see you."
"No", he answered, turning towards the dead fireplace again.
Harry sighed and stood up, hands in his jeans pockets, turning to face his friends. "I don't know. It depends on what you've heard", he said, carefully lifting his chin up.
"Doesn't feel

Ginny then noticed who Harry was with - and she was
skipped breakfast", Ron said. "You don't want to skip lunch too."
"He did", Malfoy said gravely. "He managed to prevent me from bleeding to death but there wasn't a way to completely erase the marks of the curse. Only my face was spared. The curse was... it was too powerful." His voice faded.
And then, one night after they already had had a long break from having sex, when Draco leaned closer to Harry's back and was kissing the nape of his neck, moving his fingers suggestively towards his fiance's abdomen... Harry grabbed his wrist and slowly moved his hand away from his crotch.
One day they went shopping together. Draco took Harry to a clothing store, telling him that now was the time to renew his wardrobe and get rid of all those worn-out clothes. Draco made Harry try on what felt like at least fifty different outfits under his supervising eye, and in the end Harry left the store with three sacks of clothes and a lot lighter wallet.
"Fine!"
of fun." He paused, giving Harry a meaningful look. "If you know what I mean."
, he heard a voice shouting inside his head.
"What?! What the hell is happening here?!" was all that she managed to say. Her eyes were travelling around at everyone around them, trying to find an explanation that didn't come.
No. He had to stop these kind of thoughts right away. He was supposed to comfort the man, not molest him. Malfoy was very drunk and Harry was sober, it wouldn't be the right thing to do. It would have to wait for another time. He would do his best to make Malfoy feel better now, he wanted to make him stop crying, and that would be all for tonight. He would just hold him like this, for as long as he needed to.
There was a loud knock on the door.
Malfoy looked perplexed. "What?" he asked.
He was drunk when he finally entered the common room that night, after drinking some firewhiskey at the Hog's Head. Ginny and him had been kissing fervently before parting and Harry was still smiling widely. Okay, he was drunk
is he?!"
"Mm hmm?"
Harry hadn't known that it would be possible for him to fall even more for Draco, but that moment proved that he had been so wrong. Harry felt warm and safe in the Slytherin's arms, and he wished that he would never have to leave. He wanted to stay nestled in the other man's arms like this forever.
"He wouldn't be happy with me, because for some inexplicable reason he only loves
"Why did you do that?!" Harry hissed at Ginny, who was looking totally perplexed.
Malfoy had woken up too. He was now sitting on the bed, eyes slightly open and directed straight at him. He looked very tired and even paler than normally, there were bags under his grey eyes and his usually groomed and clean platinum hair was all ruffled and sweaty after the night. In Harry's eyes he still looked like the most beautiful person in the whole world.
"Yeah, I'm okay now. Better get back to sleep...", Harry answered. "Night..."
"Hi, Ginny", he said stiffly. He was feeling very uneasy, totally unsure of how to act. He had planned talking to her tomorrow after classes, but things never seemed to go as he originally planned.
"Apparently you guys didn't bother informing him first", he noted.
Harry could tell that Draco was clearly taken by his effort: the Slytherin seemed to enjoy the excellent food and wine, and he kept glancing at Harry from time to time while eating, smiling. Harry himself couldn't keep his eyes off the Slytherin either.
"I... wasn't alone."
The thing bothered Draco, he missed going out with his man, but he didn't bring it up with Harry yet. He didn't want to waste their only time together by complaining or arguing. He'd rather just lay in his fiance's arms and watch television with him or have sex with him. Because, no matter how tired Harry seemed to be after work, at least he still very much enjoyed having sex with Draco, and that soothed the blond a little.
"Yes, they'll join us", Ron announced as he returned back to his seat across the table.
Malfoy was eyeing him closely. "So... wanna share what that was about?"
Draco Malfoy after all. The Slytherin had thoroughly enjoyed spreading gossip about him and ruining his reputation in their earlier school years. Thinking about the 'Potter stinks'-badges and the interviews he had given to
If looks could kill, he would have been a dead man.
, he heard a voice say and turned his head to look at her, but instead of brown eyes he saw grey eyes locking with his own, and platinum blonde, not red, hair against his fingers instead.
"What is this about?" Ginny asked him immediately. "Why are you so angry at me?"
Finally he let Draco go on and the Slytherin started to move inside him, very slowly and carefully. It was quite painful and unpleasant at first, and Harry kept biting his lip to not cry out loud. Draco, instead, seemed to enjoy himself and apparently tried to make him more excited by calling Harry by his last name again.
at me... no matter how much effort I put to my looks and... Finally I decided to take the matters into my own hands to make sure you'd notice my existence."
The Slytherin turned to face him and Harry could tell that though the other man was still wearing a very tiny smile on his lips, he was also feeling worried.
Harry smiled. Looking at the man made him feel all warm and fuzzy inside, not to mention all those butterflies in his stomach. Malfoy was still deep asleep, tightly holding onto Harry. Being like this, holding the beautiful Slytherin in his arms... it felt so right. He had never felt anything like this, not even with Ginny. No, this was different...
"Whatever", Malfoy said. "Let's get started already."
"What do you mean...?" Harry mumbled.
"Sorry", Harry said quietly. He found himself admiring Malfoy's tall, slender figure which was covered by all black clothes, emphasizing it even more. Oh, how much Harry wished to be able to press that lithe body against his own, to hold him close, look him deep in the eyes… but it was not possible. Malfoy was not gay, he didn't like Harry that way and Harry was with Ginny. Nothing like that would ever happen between him and Malfoy. But it was still possible to at least spend some time with him as friends, right? He'd only need to ask…
"Yeah... Pretty much", Harry said. "Ever since my first year."
Harry trembled, forcing himself to return to the real world. He felt shocked. He had once again dreamt of Malfoy instead of Ginny, and it’d not been just any kind of dream. This time he and Malfoy'd had sex. Really
Draco seemed to hesitate for a while until he started again.
been a terrible boyfriend. How could he even be a good one when he didn't even know what he wanted anymore?
Draco chuckled at the movie, quickly glancing towards Harry before returning his attention to the television again. Harry turned his attention to the TV as well, trying hard to concentrate on the film again, but no matter how much he tried, he couldn't keep his eyes from wandering back to the Slytherin from time to time. He took another crisp from the bowl between them, watching the other man from the corner of his eye.
"I know", Ginny said. "I've just missed you so much and-"
"We didn't do anything like that", Harry said, grinning. "But if we did, I wouldn't tell you anyway, so you don't have to worry."
"Well done", Harry groaned. He instantly pushed Draco on his back on the bed and kept pounding into his completely exhausted body until he came as well a short while later, collapsing on top of the blond.
" Harry groaned, his eyes closing as Malfoy squeezed him hard.
Silence fell over them and for a while they were both just standing there, still quite near each other, and that made Harry feel a bit uneasy. He kept fiddling with his messy hair, his head turned towards the nearest window. He was very aware of Malfoy's gaze still lingering on him and he couldn’t help but wonder what the blond was thinking about.
"Why?" Harry found himself asking.
"Damn it, Harry", Draco purred against Harry's neck. "I want you badly."
"I'm so, so sorry", he said quietly. "I had no idea of all the damage I've caused you."
"How do you know?" Harry sighed.
"Uh… yeah…", Harry mumbled, suddenly realizing that he hadn't actually paid
The warmth spread throughout Harry's entire body as their lips touched and started to move against each other, first very softly, then more passionately. Their lips were moving in a perfect sync, so intimate and electrifying.
"Right, I'll be going then... Good night, Malfoy."
"You really, really have one dirty mind, Potter."
"Fucking, fucking, fucking
Harry nodded. "We've become closer than before and he has told me things I didn't know. Like you already know, he can't sleep well. He's still having nightmares about the war. Also, people here are treating him like shit because he joined the Death Eaters. They are calling him names and…" He paused. "So… yes. I am a little worried about him. Also, he doesn't have many real friends to talk to, so I've even offered him my friendship." Another short pause. "I'm not obsessed with him. I'm just being friendly."
Harry nodded slowly, feeling guilty as hell. Ron was being so understanding but Harry knew that the moment his best friend would find out the real reason Harry wanted to leave his sister, all the understanding would be far gone. He had wanted to tell him today already… but now that he was sitting there with his two friends, he just couldn't do it.
"We should probably be heading inside", he said, nervously stroking his hair at the same time. "We don't want to miss the dinner, right?"
Soon they were, once again, rubbing against each other, this time with no pants on, simply skin on skin. Malfoy was on top, holding and moving their cocks together with his hand and they were both moaning loudly.
Ginny shrugged her shoulders in frustration before starting to pull her trousers on. "I don't know, Harry! Whatever this thing is, it doesn't seem to work. This is not a normal relationship and you must have noticed that too. You agree with me, right?"
"Why do you want to talk about
but if that's what you really want, then..."
felt very arousing at the same time. Draco, of course, was trying his best to make it even more awkward for Harry by talking dirty as always.
"I promise", Harry said. "Trust me, Draco."
Harry gave the other man an apologizing look. "Sorry", he said, running his fingers through his black hair. "I shouldn't have been so rough with you."
"Why?" he asked. "There's no reason to be… I've been just… tired… and –"
I want, Draco. I've wanted you for a long time already but I just haven't been able to admit it to you or even to myself." He lowered his gaze again, not able to look at the Slytherin. "So I'm asking if you would like to... be my boyfriend."
... Harry remembered all of that all too well. Malfoy had changed since then, but you never knew for sure when talking about him. He would definitely have to talk to Malfoy about it later today. He should have done it already.
"Yeah", Ron said. "They seemed to be having
"No", Harry cut him off right away. "I swear."
he asked, clearly stunned. "You're asking me to..." His voice faded.
Everyone nodded and he turned around, heading towards the kitchen. Harry's eyes followed his gorgeous fiancé as he walked away. Damn how lucky he was.
"How the hell could I tell something like that to you, the famous hero?" Draco sighed, rolling his eyes. "You were the saviour of the Wizarding World and I was an ex-Death Eater. I stood no chance. Besides, you were usually surrounded by your admirers or your friends... or your girlfriend. You were always snogging her in front of my eyes. I started to spend more time in the Common Room, but even if we were the last ones left there, you had no intention to talk to me. You wouldn't even
They finally ended up watching some comedy film together, eating the snacks that Harry had bought from the store at the same time. Draco seemed to be slowly getting used to the television thing and he concentrated on it entirely. Harry, however, found himself being more interested in watching Draco than the movie. He just couldn't help it.
Harry could see Draco's face slowly turning red. He knew that being sentimental like this in front of everyone was really hard for a man like Draco Malfoy, and that's what made Harry feel even more touched by his words.
"You mean I can only blame myself for this?" Harry asked, irritated. "May I remind you who left the door unlocked on purpose? You
"Okay...", Harry said slowly. "So...?"
"Hello", Harry said back.
He glanced at the other man. Those beautiful stormy grey eyes, long dark eyelashes... Damn, the man was breathtaking!
Harry didn't know how long they just stood there embracing and kissing each other, but when their lips finally parted, Draco's beautiful eyes were sparkling as their gazes locked again.
?" he snorted. "I wouldn't have guessed."
Harry nodded. "Yeah. Only if you want to, of course", he said, babbling. "The place is still a bit disorganized and dusty since I haven't been home a lot and it's
Draco, who was looking a little timid, slowly walked to the couch and sat next to Harry. They were sitting in silence for a good while. Draco's eyes were fixed on the TV screen where people were shooting towards each other with guns, dodging bullets and yelling at each other. Harry, instead, found himself looking at the Slytherin, smiling and trying to suppress a laugh because of the baffled look on his face.
He had totally forgotten that Malfoy had been sitting there in the corner this whole time while he and Ginny had been kissing and talking. He was waiting for a scornful remark at the very least, but it never came. Harry didn't know why but he actually felt a bit annoyed about the silence this time. At times like this he kind of missed arguing with Malfoy.
Harry felt a thrill course through his body and closed the gap between them. He kissed the other man roughly, slipping his tongue inside Draco's warm mouth again. Oh sweet mother of Merlin... Draco wanted him. The classy, breathtaking, always so
He could tell that Harry was fuming with anger and jealousy at the moment and it gave him great pleasure.
"MR. POTTER! MR. NOTT! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?!" Headmistress McGonagall's voice echoed from the other end of the corridor, and they were soon pulled apart from each other with a quick wave of a wand.
"Yes, let's go."
"No offence, Malfoy, but that is
Hermione and Ron also left the room after a while, leaving only Harry, Ginny and Malfoy sitting in the common room. Seamus quickly came by to return few books to the bookshelf, but after that they were all by themselves. There was a deep silence for a long, long time until Ginny finally broke it.
"Night", Malfoy said without lowering his book an inch.
He could see Hermione, Luna, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. He could see Theodore and Blaise, wearing matching dark blue dress robes, busy whispering with each other. He could see Pansy Parkinson with his at least ten years older boyfriend Alec, Draco's relatives, and the full Weasley family. He swallowed hard when he realized that Ginny was also sitting there with her family. Harry had invited the whole Weasley family because he had not dared to leave Ginny out of the guest list, but he hadn't thought that she would actually come. Not after all that had happened between them. And still, there she was, sitting next to her mom.
you're willing to talk to me", Ginny hissed at him. "Where were you
Another silence fell over them and Harry felt very disappointed. Discussing about yesterday had not gone at all like he had planned. Instead of making up they had only ended up taunting and blaming each other. Harry was not proud of himself at all. He didn't want Malfoy to think of him as a heartless bastard who didn't care about his feelings whatsoever.
"Be my guest", Malfoy said, showing no intention of leaving. He leaned back on his chair, throwing back his head and stretching his arms, eyes closed.
I love him and he loves me, and there's nothing you or father can do about it", he said.
Harry gave a quick nod at Ron, who was responsible of the musics tonight. His best mate gave a quick wave of a wand at the cd player.
he's done to you and your friends?!" She was sobbing heart-brokenly. "I can't believe you would do this to me, Harry! I thought you
Ginny laughed, shaking her head. "You're no fun. You know, there
"Damn it, Draco", Harry said, tightening the grip around the blond. "Why didn't you just tell me?"
"Draco, calm down", Harry tried.
the same git who used to be an arse to us, you know."
Ron was eyeing Harry like he had lost his mind. "Blimey, Harry!" he said quietly. "You stood her up for
Draco said and Harry noticed a hurt look on his pale face. The Slytherin dragged his chair backwards, stood up and left, heading towards kitchen without another word to him. Harry followed after him.
"Hey, didn't I tell you that I can manage on my own", he said but Malfoy wasn't paying any attention to his words. He was already scanning Harry's essay with a thoughtful, concentrated look on his pale face. Once again Harry found himself staring at the blond a little too long while the man was reading his essay from beginning to an end. He was waiting for the familiar criticism – but this time he got praised instead.
Harry finally turned his head to side, facing the other man. "I can't quite believe what just happened", he said. "I've never even..." He paused. It was awkward to put it into words, to admit his inexperience to the other man. "...and now with...
"I do, a lot", Draco objected, staring at his feet. "You even saved me from the Fiendfyre, risking your life for me... I still don't know why you did it. I didn't
He was soon standing at Malfoy's door, his hand holding the doorknob, his head spinning. Oh Merlin, here he was. He had no idea what was waiting for him at the other side of the door but he was going to find out soon enough. He was not going to back down anymore... If the door would really be open, that is. Letting out a deep breath, his stomach in knots, he slowly turned the knob. The door did open.
"Because I was wasted and you had been messing with my head by trying to kiss me", Malfoy pointed out.
"Are you telling me you did it on purpose?!"
Harry took another forkful of stew, lifting his gaze just in time to see Malfoy leaving the Great Hall with his friends. They obviously had already finished their lunch. Malfoy turned his head once to glance at Harry, flashing a smallest possible smile at him. Harry was about to smile back first, but the smile faded away quickly as he remembered his dream from last night.
He turned to look at the blond in confusion, seeing a weird smile on the blond's lips as he said: "Hearing stuff like that from you, Potter... It's
You've said that you want to get married someday, have a family..."
"What?!" Ginny immediately cut him off. "You were with

felt anything like this towards anyone else before", he continued, now lowering his gaze to his feet. "You see, I keep thinking about you all the time and... also, I've got this weird urge to protect you. I know there are people who want to make you suffer for what you've done in the past and..." Fuck, he was babbling. Harry's cheeks were starting to burn. "I just want you to know that... you are safe with me. I will not let anything happen to you, Draco.
"She's been feeling down ever since my father ended up in Azkaban", Malfoy still continued. "There are good days and there are bad days but... let's just say that lately there's been a lot of very,
Malfoy had turned to face him, face totally unreadable, and a weird feeling overwhelmed Harry. He already regretted his question. Why had he said that? He did NOT want Malfoy to give Theodore a chance.
As they were walking along the hospital corridor, Harry was deep in his thoughts. He had wished to become a father someday because he hadn't had a proper family himself as a child, but he had already accepted the fact that he wouldn't be able to have that with Draco. He had been ready to give up his dream because of Draco, but now that he had heard there actually were possibilities to have children between same sex couples...
"Alright, alright, I’m sorry", Narcissa said, flashing a small grin that reminded Harry of Draco's. "I'm just so happy for you two lovebirds. It really made my day that you came visiting."
The blond had told him that he was dreaming of becoming a Potioneer after finishing school. He didn't want to become a Potions master but he did want to brew potions for a living and invent them himself. It sounded like a fitting career for him and Harry was certain that Malfoy really could become a respected Potioneer. He really liked the fact that Malfoy actually wanted to do something for a living - his family was so rich that there was no real need for him to do anything at all if he didn’t feel like it.
"Not all of us", a drawling voice commented from the hallway, cutting through Harry's thoughts. "
"I'll tell you what's going on", the brunet said, a mischievous glint in his dark eyes. "Your boyfriend spent the whole Christmas break with Draco Malfoy behind your back."
Potter. A lot better than you think."
Malfoy blinked.
"I know."
, Potter. I'll show you what you fucking GET when you mess with Draco Malfoy!"
However, before he even realized what was happening, Draco had already muttered out a a weird spell that Harry had never heard before, and was soon offering him his palm with some colourless lotion on it.
"Yeah. Would you like me to switch?"
you were when opposing him!" Harry's lips curved to a confused smile, his cheeks blushing. "Not to forget the fact that you saved me and my mom from Azkaban afterwards. All that stuff made me want you even more", Draco finished, starting to roll Harry's hair around his finger again.
Harry was staring at his almost full plate with glazed eyes now. It sounded like Malfoy had given Theodore what he’d wanted... Harry didn't feel like eating anymore.
"I don't know", Harry mumbled. "This is so crazy."
"But you're still friends with Theodore, right?" Harry asked.
Harry lifted his head in confusion, his eyes locking with the other man's own. Malfoy wanted Harry to call him by his
No, he hadn't imagined it, Harry was positive about it now. Malfoy was now biting his lower lip and at the same time his eyes were clearly and very shamelessly lingering on Harry's lips… before he lifted his gaze back again, giving Harry an insecure, tentative look. That was when Harry knew that there was no going back now, not this time. This time it was going to happen. Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was going to kiss his ex-nemesis Draco Malfoy, the man he had been dreaming of for
do it. Even if they had been arguing with Ginny a lot and they hadn't been on the best possible terms lately, he had no right to do this to her. No one deserved to be treated like this. He really was the worst possible boyfriend ever. He didn't deserve Ginny.
For Harry, this was the happiest Christmas ever, because it had given him Draco.
"Hmm. No card", Harry muttered thoughtfully.
"Everything alright, mate?" Ron, his bestman, asked quietly from his right side, placing a hand on his shoulder.
"You mean the Black family's old house?" Malfoy asked. Harry noticed that he was looking slightly disappointed.
Draco, who was feeling extremely embarrassed under everyone's gaze, just shook his head, still crying.
Harry..."
Draco cried out, quickly pulling away from Greg and placing himself in front of the door before Theo managed to grab the handle. "Don't, Theo!"
Like everyone had suspected, the next schoolweek didn't start any easier for the 8th grade students.
"Well... I was supposed to leave tomorrow and spend the whole holiday at the Weasley's but now..." He paused, letting out a tired yawn. "...it's going to be a very depressing Christmas for me, it seems."
"I... guess you're right... Maybe we really should take a break. But... what about Christmas..?", Harry muttered. "We're leaving tomorrow and I was supposed to spend the whole holiday with you and your family and-"
"Well, I've said it before... You really are a hothead, nothing new about that", Malfoy said teasingly. "I've experienced it myself many times already. Remember how you attacked me at the Quidditch Pitch?"
, he continued as Harry still kept going "I don't want to come yet..."
Malfoy stood up, hands glenched. "I
Okay. Now he was really starting to worry about his mental health. What the
"Really", Harry replied. "I looked into your eyes and... Well, after that I couldn't stop thinking about you. I was a goner."
Ron and Hermione were sitting on Ron's bed and Harry was lounging on his own, staring at the ceiling.
"I mean it", Harry said strictly. "Last night was a mistake."
Harry lowered his gaze and continued eating though he was feeling kind of sick, not to mention tired.
When it was already 1 am and they still hadn't come back, Harry couldn't take it anymore.
"What did he do?" he asked. "Or did you do something?"
"What?" Draco asked quietly, his head still feeling all clouded.
"What?"
"Is it
Harry kept fiddling with his sleeve, his thoughts returning to Draco once again. The Christmas break spent with Draco had been wonderful. He had learned to know the other man so much better and he had gotten used to doing almost everything with him. They had eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day, slept in the same bed, showered together, and most of all: had lots of sex together all around the house, the last time had been that same morning, Harry having taken Draco against the kitchen counter.
the only thing you care about?"
They didn't even care that they were making a lot of noise. Harry didn't even know if Malfoy had cast the Silencing charm to the room or not but he didn't give a damn, to be honest. All his drunken brain knew was that he had never experienced such amount of pleasure in his whole life. No,
"I am not playing any games with you!" Harry snapped back at him. "I don't know who has been telling you stuff like that but that's utter shit! I would NEVER cheat on you, never! You know that!"
Harry did as told. He kept switching the channels, following Draco's expressions as he did the surfing. He laughed quietly to himself at Draco's slightly flushed face when there was suddenly a kissing couple on the screen.
"Yes", Harry answered to Ron. "I know how crazy it sounds but... that's the plan."
Harry was boiling with frustration and anger.
Draco's hands were already working on the buttons of Harry's winter coat the same time they were kissing, trying to get rid of the offending garment as fast as he could. Harry didn't mind. As his coat was soon thrown away somewhere, he moved his own hands to Draco's coat, trying to get rid of that, too. It didn't take long before he had finished unbuttoning it and let it drop to their feet.
"I think we should use this", he said, pulling the invisibility cloak from his pocket.
Draco loved kissing Harry. The other man was a really good kisser, he really knew how to use his lips and his tongue. Harry was exploring Draco's mouth with his tongue, swirling it inside, moving it against Draco's own tongue and at times sucking it lightly and teasingly. It was all making Draco feel even more horny than he already was.
"Me neither..."
expert, Potter." He headed back to the castle, leaving Harry to sit there alone.
. Ginny kept on wanting to snuggle and kiss with him on the couch in front of everyone and all Harry could think about was Malfoy.
Draco was staring deep into the other man's eyes, and like always, he felt like he was drowning in them. There was no doubt about it, he wanted to be looking into those eyes for the rest of his life. There weren't even words to describe how much he loved Harry. Even though Harry had treated him badly for weeks, his love towards the man hadn't faded one bit.

Malfoys grey eyes weren't directed towards Ron anymore. No, they were directed sideways, staring straight at Harry's own. The man may have been staring at him for a long time already, but Harry hadn't noticed.
bad ones, so it's best for her to not be home alone right now." He sighed heavily and paused for a while. "It runs in the blood I think... the sickness", he finally continued. "You know aunt Bellatrix and how crazy
Harry pushed himself through the portrait to the dim common room, angrily pulled his invisibility cloak off and slammed his schoolbag to the floor with a loud smash. He was still steaming with anger because of Ginny.
feelings.
"WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT IS GOING ON?!" Ginny shouted before Harry almost attacked Theodore.
"I think I'll head to sleep already", Theodore said. "You're not coming, Draco?"
"You mean what's this thing?" Harry asked, pointing towards the TV. "This, Draco, is a television." He turned to look at the other man.
The next page contained another picture of the young happy couple, this time dancing at a party, their bodies glued to one another. They were both wearing smitten smiles on their faces as they were looking at each other. They looked perfect together.
Harry startled, quickly glancing over his shoulder and saw the blond Slytherin standing few meters away from him, already wearing his black pyjamas.
Finally, when it was already 4 am and there was still no sign of Harry, he couldn't fight it anymore. He cried himself to sleep again, picturing in his mind how Harry had probably been fucking one of his colleagues late to the night after work and finally fallen asleep next to him or her, rather than returning home to Draco.
"But you're still
Malfoy sighed heavily, turning his head to glare at him. "Potter. Yesterday I had a
"Uh... Remember how my school stuff spread around the corridor?"
"Yeah", Harry answered gently, stroking a wisp of her red hair off her face with his fingers. "You are beautiful."
"Ah, fuck! Fucking own me, Harry Potter!"
"What? I'm all out of chocolate", Ron answered with a shrug.
What is my mum thinking?!"
to me that he was serious, he swore that he wouldn't hurt Draco, and he
contest", Malfoy said, exuding confidence.
He would watch Malfoy spending time with his Slytherin friends. He would watch him in their shared classes: Transfiguration and Potions, seeing him fully concentrating on his studies. He would watch Malfoy studying or hanging out with Theodore a lot, spending way too much time together for Harry's liking. He would watch Malfoy at the library: see the blond walking alone between the bookshelves, browsing through the dusty books with a blank face. He would watch him at meals at the Great Hall, noticing how little he actually ever ate anything. He would watch Malfoy spend less and less of his time with others at their Common room and go spend it in his own bedroom instead. It made Harry feel kind of sad somehow, but he didn't have a chance to confront Malfoy because he was, after all, always with Ginny. But that was how few weeks passed on and suddenly it was already November.
Harry, who had been resting on his own bed, deep in his thoughts, quickly opened his eyes after hearing Hermione's voice.
Until four months had passed since his and Harry's ex-girlfriend's undesirable reunion and something happened.
"I want you to be happy, Harry", Ginny said, not letting him interrupt. "And you never were happy with
"Even if you weren't dreaming, we still don't know what really happened", Hermione notified. "They're just friends, that's all. Malfoy told Harry he’s not gay so obviously they could
"Yeah. He used to be my best friend, after all", the Slytherin said quietly. "But not after that night. He said a lot of bad things about me, my family – and you. I will never forgive him."
Harry was panting and so was Theodore. Their faces were dripping with blood as they were staring at the Headmistress.
The fire in the fireplace had finally died a while ago and the common room was already dark, but not dark enough for Harry to not see the pale, blond man sitting on the same couch that Harry had been resting on a while ago. Harry was now walking very slowly, quietly inching towards the couch, only stopping when he was facing the other man from few meters away. His heart skipped a beat when he realized what he was seeing.
He saw Ron and Hermione glancing at each other from the corner of his eye.
of us?" he repeated uncertainly.
It took a while before they’d found everything. Harry was crawling on all fours along the corridor, reaching for Draco’s inkwell that was still there in the corner, lying almost hidden next to a huge houseplant.
"A filthy liar! That's what he is!"
kicking my ass?" Harry bullied, gaining a sulky glare from the blond. "For the
Harry flashed a quick, grateful smile at her, turning his head to stare out of the window next.
Harry shook his head. "No", he said. "Now I know where all that dirty talk comes from." He grinned.
"Harry? What's the matter?" she asked, her hand fumbling his bare manhood that was still not showing any signs of interest whatsoever.
Harry was staring at Malfoy's diverging back for a while, feeling bad for believing Ron's story just like that. Hermione had been right about Malfoy having nightmares all along. Damn it...
"I want you, Draco", he gasped, caressing the other man's face with his fingers.
Harry kept on moving the quill against the parchment but Malfoy had already dragged the chair backwards and sat across from him. Harry lifted his gaze slowly, eyes locking with Malfoy's grey ones. They just stared at each other for a while. Harry felt a weird tingling feeling in his stomach and felt very annoyed about it. Why did Malfoy have this kind of effect on him all of a sudden?
Malfoy's question made Harry feel pensive. He was now staring at the ceiling, thinking. If Ginny
Harry soon fell asleep, but Draco kept lying awake for hours that night, just staring at the ceiling and thinking what had happened between them during the last month, and the more he thought about everything, the more wretched and apprehensive he felt.
"Because, the last time I saw you two together, Draco, he was so crazy about you", Blaise continued. "I mean, in the club that was full of good-looking witches and wizards that night, you were the only one he saw. He didn't give a damn about
"You chose well, Harry", Draco said quietly to Harry as the song finally ended, a lopsided smile rising to his lips. His grey eyes were still wet of tears.
Harry let out a short laugh. "Well, Draco. Your plan definitely worked because I
to make up with Ginny yet?" Hermione replied with a question of her own.
"How the bloody hell should I know?! Don't ask me! There's no reasonable explanation for fucking Malfoy!"
Harry nodded, watching with furrowed brows as the Slytherin flashed a small smile at him and walked away.
Harry gulped. "I'm not lying", he objected, but seeing the look on Hermione's face he knew she didn't believe him.
Malfoy grimaced in annoyance. "Ask me
"I spent years waiting to get my hands on you, Harry Potter. My hunger will not be so easily satisfied."
Malfoy gave him a meaningful look. "Trust me, Potter. I've got no interest in getting to know her any better", he said.
His gaze travelled to the sleeping Slytherin again and his stomach tightened. He would never touch the Slytherin like that again, even though he wanted nothing more.
As they were leaving, Narcissa still had one question left for them.
Now that they were so close to each other and under the cloak, Harry was able to smell the Slytherins lovely scent even better, as well. He was breathing it deep into his lungs, almost drowning in it. It made him feel like he was losing his mind.
"But you still told me you haven't had any kind of sex with her and you've been together for a long time already", Malfoy pointed out. Harry's eyes widened as he started to imitate Harry's voice next: "
Harry had been wrong thinking that Ginny would be pissed. She wasn't just pissed, she was
"I know", Harry sighed. "I just never wanted to hurt her, you know."
"Yeah... That will never happen", Harry said, his eyes still on the kitchen where Draco was busy making tea for them.
"Well, Harry, I'm glad... The moment I saw that one, I immediately knew that was the one. It matches with your eyes."
In the first picture Harry was holding Ginny close to him and pressing a kiss to her lips. After the kiss they first looked at each other and then at the camera with blissful smiles on their lips.
He didn't even remember when had been the last time that Harry had told him how beautiful he was. Harry would still kiss him as he was leaving for work in the mornings, and sometimes he would take Draco in his arms when they'd watch television together, but... that wasn't enough. Harry didn't pay as much attention to him anymore as he used to. Even when Harry was at home with Draco, he wasn't there, not really. His thoughts were always somewhere else these days. Harry had slowly become more absent, more distant... and now he didn't even want to have sex with Draco either.
There was a short silence, only cut by some footsteps leaving the Great Hall.
Malfoy was moaning under him, moving his hands to Harry's bottom now. Harry's cock was already hard and he could feel that Malfoy was as hard as him. Soon their erections were pressed together, only separated by their pyjamas, and Harry was slowly rubbing himself against Malfoy.
"Well it's pretty hard to trust you after you already broke your promise today!"
"Not going to happen", Draco had defended right away, trying his best to seek for a confident tone. "Harry would never do that to me."
"So... I was thinking... What do you say if...", Ginny continued, her voice suggestive. Harry could feel her hand squeezing his thigh. Harry was very glad of the fact that there wasn't anyone else sitting nearby at the moment. "...you know... if we'd finally take this to another level...?"
How the hell could he have done this to Ginny? He was supposed to take care of his girlfriend, make sure that everything was perfect for her, shelter her...
"HELP! SOMEONE HELP!" someone shouted from far away.
"Step away, Draco. I swear that I will find him and punch him so hard for doing this to you!" Theo growled, hands clenched into fists. "That
do you think you're going?!" the Slytherin asked sharply.
Harry, wearing an affective smile on his lips, quickly glanced towards the guests and he could see Hermione wiping her already teary eyes with a handkerchief.
"It is", Harry said without hesitation, crossing his arms across his chest. "Got a problem with it?"
used to cooking. I had to do it all the time at the muggle family I lived with." Seeing the sudden, thrilled look on Draco's face he quickly added: "Don't expect anything gourmet though. Just ordinary everyday food. It’s not like I’m a chef or anything."
"Listen, I... There's something I need to tell you", he said after a while of hesitation.
not your style so I don't know if you'd enjoy yourself there and I -"
Draco's cheeks flushed a little and, once again mesmerized by the man's beauty, Harry leaned closer and kissed the other man again. His heart felt like exploding. He loved, loved, loved the man in his arms. And Draco loved him back.
Harry sighed again. "That's not what I meant", he said. "But you do know that I'm with Ginny and... she wants us to take our relationship to the next level very soon, and..."
Draco's eyes had been lingering on Harry's lips for a while before he’d answered: "Nah, I'll just watch this time. I don't want to ruin our dinner."
The rest of the day was a very unusual one.
"You do know what they say?" she had said. "Once a cheater, always a cheater. I wish you luck with that."
When he heard the trio getting up and leaving towards their own rooms, he glanced over his shoulder, just in time to catch Malfoy's eyes finally looking directly at him for a second before they all disappeared to the corridor that led to their rooms.
last time dreaming about Draco Malfoy. Ginny was rolling his messy black hair around her fingers.
Thing's were really starting to get out of hand.
piece of SHIT!!!"
"Hah! Still better than you", Harry answered with a laugh. He wasn't even lying. Malfoy had always been quite good at quidditch but not as good as Harry. Not even close.
Draco's gaze finally travelled from the Daily Prophet to Harry. He had known that the Ministry had been after the man for months but he had had no idea that Harry had been appointed to catch him. He remembered Blaise's words about the possibility of Harry having a burnout because of work and felt guilt overcome him.
Harry flashed a tiny smile to the other man. "I would do it all again any time", he said softly, moving his hand to caress the silky platinum hair with his fingers.
"And those kisses with Ginny..." Harry let out a heavy sigh. "God damnit, Draco,
"I love you too", Harry whispered back, before they melted into another stupendous, loving kiss. Harry's fingers were wrapped tightly around the Slytherin's waist, pulling him as close as he could, and the other man's hands were tangled in his messy hair, caressing the back of his head. There was a swarm of butterflies in Harry's stomach once again.
He and Malfoy had ended up lying spooning sometime overnight, Harry being the little spoon. Malfoy's body was tightly pressed against his backside, his right hand under Harry's head and his left hand thrown over his chest. Being hugged by Malfoy so tightly was like a dream come true to Harry. Malfoy's naked lower body pressed against his own naked skin and their firmly intertwined fingers... Oh Merlin how
"Yeah.
"What about your classmates?" Harry himself had to ask. Wasn't Draco at all afraid of telling his friends that he was suddenly in a relationship with Harry fucking Potter, the man he had pretended to loathe for years? "What will they say? Imagine their reaction..."
One of the most weirdest part was when Dudley came to awkwardly wish them a happy marriage with his girlfriend Anna. Harry still had hard time to believe that his cousin had came to his wedding. Petunia and Vernon hadn't come, and he hadn't expected Dudley to show up either. But, life was full of surprises, and one of those was standing right next to him.
"I looked gorgeous?" Draco asked, his smile widening.
you're so
"I won't", Harry said. "And..." He was running his hand through his messy black hair again. "Yesterday was my last day as an Auror."
"You think I'd make up stuff like that?" Malfoy asked in a slightly irritated tone. "Yeah, seriously."
The Slytherin chuckled too and pulled him into another long kiss. They stood there embracing and kissing each other for a while before they finally apparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place again, where they spent the rest of the night watching some television, cuddling, kissing and – once again – making love, in the end falling asleep in each other's arms.
"Really", Malfoy answered. "I can't wait to see where you live. And the Black family's heritage, of course."
"I'm not even allowed to come sit with you."
Harry's head was spinning with lust, pleasure and love. Having sex with Draco was stupendous, he had never imagined that sex could be anything like this, feel this good and this intense, not even close. Draco's muscles were squeezing him so tightly that he was almost losing his mind and he kept wanting more and more, wishing he could try out every possible position. He remembered one of his dreams where Draco had been bouncing on top of him... Damn. He wanted Draco to ride him.
"I don't think that it's all that clear", Blaise cut his boyfriend off. "Maybe Potter's just having a burnout or something? Think about his job and how stressful it must be."
Fuck it. To
"I know it was stupid", Draco said, dropping his gaze to stare at his feet again.
"What the hell makes you think that I would still want to get married to a

Harry didn't know if he had ever been as distressed before as he was now for the rest of the Friday afernoon. Spending time with Ginny after nearly kissing another person, and not just any person but a guy, was... Merlin, it was
Draco shook his head and Harry wasn't surprised at all. He knew there were house-elves at the Malfoy Manor, Dobby had been one of them before Harry had set him free from their service.
They exchanged another loving kiss.
exceeded my expectations."
Malfoy shook his head slowly, seeming a little tense. "Not this year, no", he sighed. "Mom's not well so she's not home and I don't feel like spending the whole Christmas break alone at the manor, so... I guess I'm staying here. Not the kind of Christmas I was hoping for, but what can you do."
Ron hissed. "You don't have to believe me, but I really, really did hear something last night! I know what I heard!"
Next day at breakfast Harry had a hard time staying awake. He had dreamt about Malfoy the whole night. From time to time he had startled awake, all sweaty and shocked, then zoned out again, only to dream about the Slytherin all over again.
Ron was eyeing Hermione sceptically for a while, until his eyes fixed on Harry again instead. "Why would Malfoy even have to spend the Christmas alone?"
"You're staying here too?" Malfoy asked, not able to fully hide his hopefulness.
He was more worried about Ron's and everyone else's reactions when he'd have to tell them about him and Draco. No one had a clue about Harry being gay – or at least bisexual -, he hadn't even known that about himself until quite recently, so it would most definitely come as a shock to everyone. And even if they wouldn't be shocked hearing about his preference for men, they would definitely be shocked to hear who he was leaving his girlfriend for. Would he have any of his old friends left after the revelation? He had no clue. Well, apart from Hermione, of course.

"And what
you care about her in a sexual way and not more as a sister or something?"
That's... that's SICK! What the hell's gotten into you, Harry?!"
"Why?" Harry asked.
Harry found himself staring at the taller man, dazed. Had he heard right? Had Malfoy just... "Did you just... call me
"I didn't kiss her! She kissed me! I was going to push her away!"
His eyes followed Malfoy at breakfast, noticing that the man didn't eat anything else but an apple. He also didn't seem to be on a mood to chat with his friends at all in the morning.
Draco was shaking his head in irritation, pressing his lips tightly together. How dared Harry pretend he didn't know what he was talking about!
"You really need more sleep, Draco", Theodore said quietly before turning around again. He gave another quick glance towards them before disappearing back to the corridor again.
"You're finally shaking my hand", he notified.
had a lot of things that he wanted to forget for a while. He needed to clear his head...
Still wearing that same smile on his pink lips, Malfoy leaned a little bit closer to Harry, beckoning for him to do the same. Harry did and Malfoy came even closer, about to whisper something to his ear. Harry's heart was thumping madly in his chest as he held his breath.
Draco was glaring at his fiance, snorting. "I have no idea what that has to do with anything, but if you must know, it was probably weeks ago. I haven't had any interest in it for some particular reason."
Harry's lips were curved up in a dreamy smile. "I know", he said back tiredly. "Everything will be a lot better."
"I'm not. But have you even thought about the possibility that maybe Malfoy was just having a nightmare?!" Hermione said persistently.
You'll
"Here you go", Harry replied, slowly pushing himself inside. Draco cried out and Harry's eyes closed as he felt the other man's hot tightness surrounding him.
Harry and Ginny managed to wipe the slate clean and things went almost entirely back to normal between them. However, after their argument happened, Harry noticed that they were spending a lot more time together than they'd used to before. Ginny was now constantly wanting to see him and they agreed to meet each other in whatever place they felt suited them at that time, but mostly in their common rooms though.
way Malfoy would be looking at him in that kind of way. Malfoy wasn't gay, he had said it himself. Harry was just imagining things because he was such a mess himself.
was a mistake! That does
good. His already slightly hardened cock immediately twitched inside his pants and kept growing again because they were so damn close to each other and
That night a very drunk Harry found himself having dirty dreams about Malfoy again.
"Oh gosh...!" Malfoy suddenly cried out as he was finally getting closer, his whole body shuddering above him. "I'm so fucking close..."
he heard another new voice and some footsteps against the floor.
Harry sighed. "It wouldn't have helped anyway", he said. "Let's talk about something else. I don't want to think about those nightmares anymore."
In the front page there was a large picture of a very creepy looking wizard with dirty blond hair and hollowed cheeks, and above the picture was a headline written with large font:
"Nnnngh", Harry answered once again, still lying on his stomach, his face buried in a pillow. His ass was burning like hell, Draco's cock stretching him wide open. He didn't understand how Draco had been able to take it so well, like a professional, the first time they'd had sex almost two weeks ago, when he himself was almost crying, his eyes full of barely restrained tears.
"I said that it's all thanks to you, Harry. For helping out Fred and George so much", Ron said. "You know, giving them all the money that you won from the Triwizard Tournament. George is forever grateful for that."
Ginny had finally managed to talk Harry into taking their relationship further and there they were, lying on Harry's bed in only their underwear, the door locked. Ron and Hermione had left for Hogsmeade a while ago and Harry and Ginny had decided to make use of the opportunity.
After they were finally ready and shower fresh they went downstairs to have some breakfast and then finally to the living room, to open their Christmas presents.
Harry shook his head, pressing another quick kiss on the other man's lips. "Not as much as I used to."
", Draco gasped. "Harry, are you alright?"
with me. He admitted it."
He winked at Harry and they both grinned.
This was not how it was supposed to go. He had wanted to take Malfoy out today, spend the Friday night together with him, be the one to offer him a drink or two at the pub, chat and laugh his head off with him, walk back to the castle with him in the chilly November night… But no, Harry was here, just sitting on the couch with Ron, bored and doing nothing, and Theodore was the one to get to do all those things with Malfoy instead… and maybe even more than that.
"I don't want to talk about it anymore", he said.
didn't take long", Harry said. "Everything is back to normal already."
His eyes widened a bit as Hermione pulled Draco to a tight hug next. From the look on Draco's flushed face, he was just as surprised as Harry was.
Malfoy gave a heavy sigh. "That's exactly the reason why."
And that was the last thing they said to each other that night. It didn't take long before Malfoy already fell asleep in Harry's arms, face resting against his chest, but Harry himself was unable to fall asleep so soon.
"What? Something on my face?" he inquired.
Ginny was also busy with her studies and quidditch, so it was a shame that they didn't share a common room anymore. They had only been able to see each other during meals the whole day.
Afterwards they walked slowly around the Godric's Hollow for almost an hour and finally stopped in front of Harry's parents' old house. Harry had been there with Hermione once earlier but he had wanted to come again.
Would he ever get another chance anymore, he didn't know. What if he had scared Malfoy? Okay, so maybe the Slytherin had seemed to want the kiss, but then again, Malfoy had also told Harry that he was not gay so it was all very, very confusing.
"Hey, so I was thinking. It's been almost a month, so... What about Hog's Head tonight?" Ron asked after a short silence.
"Draco, please forgive me", Harry whispered. All the anger of their earlier argument had completely faded away. "I will make it up to you. For the rest of our lives, if you let me."
going to fit under it?" he asked, sounding a bit tense.
Harry, feeling very horny but also confused, moved lower on Draco's body, and took some of the lube in his hand. He was about to ask Draco to spread his legs a bit but before he had time to do it, Draco had already turned around and opened up his legs slightly for him without asking.
His gaze got glued on Malfoy and Theodore who were sitting side by side while Theodore was whispering something against Malfoy's ear. Malfoy didn't seem to mind the closeness at all, instead he had an unreadable smile on his lips. Harry wanted to smack Theodore for whispering such things, whatever they were.
"Better give you what you want then", he breathed against Malfoy's ear after their lips parted again, moving his lips to the Slytherin's neck instead. Malfoy smelled and tasted so good and his skin was smooth like silk against his lips. He couldn't get enough of this man, he could just eat him up. He wanted to touch and feel him in every way possible.
"Did I get this right?" he finally asked, slowly. "You would had been sorted into Slytherin but you insisted to be in Gryffindor instead?"
"Morning", he grunted. Ginny turned to look at Ron and Hermione questioningly.
He saw Malfoy and Goyle exchanging glances. Goyle shrugged.
"I didn't yet, but I will!" Harry said.
Harry's angry question was cut off by Ginny kissing him again, roughly. His girlfriend was clearly trying to prove some point here but once again Harry realized that kissing with Ginny didn't make him feel anything. It was nothing compared to the kisses with Draco. Kissing with Draco was euphoric, it was intense, it was everything... By kissing Harry, Ginny only made it even clearer to him that he didn't want anyone else but Draco.
"He had a nightmare", Hermione gave an explanation.
"How was your Christmas break?" Ginny asked.
"Honestly, I don't even know what to say, other than... thank you, Draco. I love it", he said with a gentle smile.
Malfoy was watching him from behind his own glass, sipping his drink. "Planning to get wasted tonight, are we, Potter?" he finally asked, a lopsided smile on his lips.
Harry was lying on his back and Ginny was straddling him, looking at him with her brown eyes sparkling.
"Now would be the time for the rings", Rivers said to Ron, who quickly walked to Harry and Draco with an open black box that had two golden rings on it. They each took one and slowly slid them to each other's ring fingers.
Since there normally wasn't any 8th grade at Hogwarts, headmistress McGonagall and the other professors had done different arrangements this time. For example, 8th year Gryffindors were now sharing a common room with Slytherins in a whole different part of the castle and their own rooms were much smaller and in pairs this year. Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were also sharing with each other. It had felt weird at first, but it was not so bad anymore. There hadn't even been any real fights with Slytherins, only a little quarrelling at the begin, but not so much of that either. Just like McGonagall had hoped, they had learned to tolerate each other better than expected. They still didn't talk a lot with the Slytherins and they all spent most of their time in their own groups, but they were also able to hang around in the common room in peace. One evening Ron had even played a game of chess with Blaise Zabini.
No one said a word for a while, they all simply continued eating their breakfast in silence. Harry quickly glanced towards the Slytherin table, seeing Malfoy laughing his head off with Blaise and Theodore. They seemed to be having a blast.
"What's with all these terrible colours? Gives me a headache", he said scornfully, reminding Harry that even if they did tolerate each other a little better, the man was still the very same git as always.
"I guess it would be kind of awkward...", he admitted, slowly.
Ron was still talking but Harry had no clue about what he was saying. Instead of Malfoy, his eyes were now on his companion. Theodore was looking great too, just like he always did. Like Hermione had said weeks ago, Theodore really was a very good looking guy. His dark brown, medium length hair was also well-set. Harry couldn't see what kind of clothes the man was wearing because he was already wearing a long cloak over them. Even so, Harry could still see that he had really put effort on his looks tonight too, just like Malfoy had. They looked perfect together.
When Harry woke up early next morning he was wearing a dreamy smile on his lips.
"Have you told Lucius yet?" she asked.
"It's better this way", Malfoy said, breaking the eye contact.
"What the hell...
hot and tight", Harry heard him say, and at the same time the Slytherin's hand started to move on his cock. "I swear to you,
Without any hesitation he had already moved his hand to his pyjamas. He quickly pulled them down, soon followed by his underpants, freeing and grabbing his already hard member, trying to focus on his dream again.
They also spent a lot of time at the library, just studying and whispering (since Madam Pince didn't allow much talking there) and they really had a lot to study for. N.E.W.T. exams were to be held at the end of their final year so when they weren't doing their homework, they were already rehearsing everything they had been studying in their earlier years. Since Harry still wished to become an Auror after graduating, he had to study many subjects: Care of Magical Creatures, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Potions, and Transfiguration. There was
Malfoy gave Harry an amused look. "See, he doesn't trust us", he said teasingly. "He thinks we're going to kill each other or something the moment he leaves us by ourselves..."
you."
Harry", he said, and they exchanged a long, loving kiss.
"And you're always the same git, Malfoy", Harry countered tiredly. He grabbed his black coat from his wardrobe and pulled it over, glancing at the other man who was eyeing him from head to toe, mouth in a strict line. "Now, are we going or not?" Harry asked. He was kind of expecting for another witty remark but none came this time.
"She's not so bad when you get to know her better, you know", he said.
Silence fell over. Hermione was still eyeing him, now raising her eyebrow. "You're…
However, when they had taken seats at the Great Hall and digged in, Harry's gaze wandered to the Slytherin table and… Malfoy wasn't there. Harry saw Pansy, Blaise, even very pissed looking Theodore… but no Malfoy. He wasn't the only one who wasn’t there, though. Goyle was also missing.
He felt tears burning in his eyes and finally flowing down his cheeks, something that had last happened so, so long ago.
"Did he do something?" he found himself asking, though he already knew exactly how the Slytherin was going to react.
Malfoy's grey eyes were fixed on him.
"You think so?" Harry asked, his lips curving up. Blimey, was Draco already waiting for another round?
"I guess the Sorting Hat knew better after all", he found himself muttering to himself, deep in his thoughts. "I should have been in Slytherin instead."
A heavy, shaking breath escaped his mouth and he could feel the restrained tears burning in his eyes.
"I don't know", Theodore said in a cold tone, looking at him deep in the eyes as if trying to read his thoughts.
Malfoy's face was unreadable. "Right", he said, turning towards the castle. "We should probably get going."
Draco's eyes were glistening with restrained tears.
Silence fell over them for a while, each of them just sipping their drinks and listening to the other customers chatting. Then Malfoy and Goyle started to discuss something that had to do with Goyle's family.
The Slytherin finally turned to face him, and Harry could see how much pain he had caused him involuntarily. It was all there to be seen in his eyes.
Malfoy lifted his gaze now, sneering. "I know." He was quiet for a while. "You know, Potter... I must say that I'm surprised. I actually had kind of fun tonight."
"I will always be carrying it with me", the Slytherin said quietly. He pulled his sleeves down again. "Unless I go and cut my arm off."
him when he was trying to kill Dumbledore too.
"What? It's the truth", Malfoy said with a shrug.
"Yeah, I know. I just...", Harry mumbled, hesitating. Finally he pushed his plate forward and stood up. "I don't feel like eating anymore."
have you been keeping secrets from us?" he asked. "Come on, Harry. We are your friends, you can tell us
Having finished his sentence, he noticed that Harry's eyes had started to water up as well, once again. "Oh, baby", the other man said, his voice cracking.
Harry felt a little bad for Malfoy. He knew that Malfoy didn't have many real friends and now he was afraid of losing one more.
They arrived to the school yard and Harry figured it would be wise to use his invisibility cloak so they wouldn't be seen wandering around the castle so late. They were now allowed to go to Hogsmeade whenever they liked – but there was still the possibility to bump into Filch and Harry was not looking forward to that.
"You don't have any house-elves?" he asked when Harry was leaving to buy some food from a convenience store the evening they arrived.
"You do realize that you're implying all of us Slytherins are ruthless pricks?"
The Slytherin was still caressing Harry's hair, suddenly looking a little uneasy. "Well... like you already know, I happen to read a lot, and there are lots of books about sex, so..."
"Draco", Harry said again, and Draco notified that his lips were starting to tremble again. "Please tell me you didn't have sex with someone else last night."
"What does it matter to you where I've spent the last night at?" he sneered. "And whom with", he added secretively on a whim, hoping to make the other man even more pissed.
There was a very expensive looking wristwatch inside. Harry slowly took it out of the box, taking a closer look at it, his other hand in front of his mouth. The watch was made of white gold and it had small emerald green details in it.
"Maybe we should get some sleep", he sighed. He was on his way trying to get up when he felt Malfoy grabbing his arm tightly.
reason of all: Malfoy.
"I'm sorry too… for attacking you", Harry said back. "Not to mention that one time in that bathroom when I very nearly killed you. I didn't know what the spell did… If I had known…"
"Oh… okay", Harry said, disappointed. "I understand."
Draco opened his eyes slightly, looking down at him. His already blushed cheeks reddened a bit more. "Huh?"
Harry sighed, now staring to the lake. "Yes, it is different", he said. "And it might not matter anything to others... but it will always be there to remind me of the day my parents died and... I'll never get rid of it either." Malfoy was now looking at him, listening. "We all have our own scars and stories behind them... Visible or invisible", Harry continued. "But you are
"So, you're switching rooms", Harry stated.
"Is it true?" Harry couldn't keep himself from asking.
Harry turned to look when the Slytherin headed towards the bedrooms and soon disappeared from his sight without a single glance backwards. Harry was left alone in the common room, his thoughts wandering between Ginny and Malfoy.
There were several seconds of deep silence in the hallway, only broken by Draco's crying, before a very loud crash from the doorway. Draco and Greg both jumped, turning towards Theo and Blaise.
"Don't", he said swiftly. "That's not true."
he could tell Hermione about his crazy crush on Malfoy. She would not understand. Harry knew that Hermione had nothing against gay relationships, she had made it very clear earlier, but Harry was still in a relationship with Ginny, so… no. He couldn't tell her. He would have to come up with something else.
"Don't", Hermione said right away, confusing Harry. "
Harry forced himself to quickly break the eye contact and turn towards the lake again. He just had to. "And…" he hesitated. "I know it might take some time but I think I'd like to be able to call you a friend."
Draco flipped over to the next page where there was a long story about the man, and a picture of the Aurors who had been working on the case. Harry was one of them. He was smiling, looking very sexy in his black Auror's suit.
"What do you mean? Aren't you going home for Christmas?" he asked.
They started taking their cloaks off near the door and Harry's eyes lingered on Malfoy. The man looked stunning tonight. He’d clearly showered after dinner and put a lot of effort on how he looked before he had left the school grounds. Even the grey blouse he was wearing matched with his eyes perfectly. Harry forced himself to turn around again so that they wouldn't notice him staring at them.
"Hi", Malfoy said.
"Alright. What can I do for you?" he finally sighed.
"I'm glad you liked it", Harry managed to say back before they were already enveloped by guests who wished to finally be able to congratulate them.
Harry gulped. He hadn't expected Malfoy and Goyle to join them after what had happened between him and Malfoy earlier. Tonight was inevitably going to be a really, really awkward and interesting one.
Harry's heart was once again pounding madly in his chest. Damn it. He was lost in Malfoy's eyes. He wanted to close the distance and kiss the man. His gaze dropped down to Malfoy's beautiful pink lips and then back up again.
"Can't sleep?"
Malfoy didn't turn to look at him. "Oh,
Hermione gave her boyfriend a slightly disapproving look.
Later Harry released the Snitch he had brought there with him. Since they both used to be Seekers in their own teams, they also wanted to have a competition about catching the Snitch.
Harry saw Malfoy reaching for his wand and gave a laugh, standing up too. "I'm not afraid of you, Malfoy", he said arrogantly. "I killed Voldemort! What are your chances against me?"
"Yeah, today", Malfoy said before heading to his own door. He glanced at Harry one more time before opening it. "Night, Potter."
"With a lot of money almost anything is possible", Narcissa continued, smiling. "And you both know that money is not a problem for us, so we would be happy to help if -"
Malfoy just glared at him for a long while, until finally the tiniest possible smile appeared on his lips. "You better not", he said.
"Right...", Harry said, still lingering at the door. He glanced backwards, seeing Malfoy standing against the desk now, resting on his elbows, back turned towards the door. Not being able to get another word out of his mouth, Harry departed, closing the door after himself. Right after he heard something like a loud crash from Malfoys room and trembled but didn't dare to go back anymore.
