Ginny had actually taken the whole thing much better than expected, once the initial shock had worn off.   Out of everything, it was that Ron and Hermione had kept their suspicions about the extent of the affair from her for years that had upset her most.  Even though they had done it from a place of kindness, they were still keeping a secret.  They didn’t trust her to be able to deal with the information. The parallel between what Harry did made Hermione a little uncomfortable.  But her and Ron made the decision to keep some of what they’d discovered secret to protect Ginny, and not the selfish reasons Harry had for deceiving them.  Ginny was also much more rational than her about Harry refusing to give them anyway of contacting him.  Hermione had wanted to try and track down the Slytherins, but Ginny had dissuaded her.  If Harry didn’t want them to know, then they should probably respect his wishes.  He might not have done the courtesy of respecting them, but they shouldn’t sink to his level, especially now he’d outright said he didn’t want them to.   Ginny had told them unequivocally that she didn’t want to speak to Harry, which had almost resulted in an argument between the two of them, before Ron had reminded Hermione not to push her own values on to other people.
“Seeing your mum and Blaise again will be good, not that I don’t enjoy having your company exclusively.” Harry quickly reassured Draco.  “And it would be nice to have access to my own vaults.  To be able to spend my money spoiling you.”
“He loves me and wants what’s best.” Lily replied still sounding tearful, but a little better than she had.
“Can’t you feel how much I need you?” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips.  He was lying back on the bed, feet over the edge and Draco straddling him.  “I didn’t think you’d come.  When you didn’t reply to my message, I thought…” Harry’s hands were stroking under Draco’s shirt as he said this.
“Something about my mother dying for me and some kind of blood protection.  Dumbledore says I have to go back every summer.”
“It’s fine, Scorpius. We should probably go find the others now anyway.  I’m not sure I want them to stumble on us like this.”
“They are.  This isn’t a friend.” It was only a half lie, Draco thought to himself.  “It’s part of my probation.”
“Shhh, it’s okay Love.  I’m here.” Harry said as he reached his hand to Draco’s face.  His thumb wiping away the tears that Draco couldn’t hold back.
The grin he got back off his husband let him know he’d made the right choice in talking about this now.
“It wasn’t soup.” Harry snorted, regretting it when his ribs sent a stabbing pain in response.  He hoped Ron hadn’t noticed the wince of pain, otherwise he’d never get rid of him.  He continued talking to try and distract his friend.  “It looked worse than one of Neville’s potions.  And it was covering half the kitchen by the time you finished”
The three of them spent their days in the Room of Requirement, only going out for food, and to try and rummage through the library.  Their research wasn’t going very well.  They could find nothing even remotely similar to what was going on between Harry and Draco in any of the books.  The room was a god send though.  The only thing it seemed it couldn’t provide was food or drink, barring alcohol for some reason.  In fact it was very good at producing contraband.  They spent one rather delightful evening passing round a joint and telling stories about their childhoods and the previous years at Hogwarts.  Harry didn’t share much about his childhood, it was something he didn’t like to think about, let alone talk about.  He’d told Draco some of it before, and he was sure Blaise had guessed from the few things he’d said, as well as the scars littering his body, that his home life was bad.  He did tell them some of the more fun stories though, and both Slytherins very much enjoyed the story of the boa constrictor at the zoo.  The next night the room had provided a bag of dried mushrooms, which Draco absolutely refused to let them take, as he couldn’t be sure of the variety.  Draco in fact had stomped his foot at the room and it almost felt like the room sighed in response as it took the bag away, replacing it with three brightly coloured tabs with little faces on them. Harry informed them that it was LSD.  Neither Blaise nor Draco had heard of the muggle drug, but it had made for a very interesting night.  None of them knew exactly why the room seemed to want them to spend their evenings get drunk or high.  Harry thought the room was just bored and found them entertaining.  The more time the spent in here, the more obvious it became that this room was sentient.  As well as liking seeing them dancing round like idiots off their faces, it got this smug little glow whenever they played around with the physical aspects of the bond and behaved like the bunch of teenagers they were, exploring each other’s bodies.  This room may not have voyeuristic ghosts, but it certainly appeared to be a bit of a voyeur itself.  The room did enjoy the entertainment, but it was more than that.  It enjoyed the taste and swirl of their magic and did whatever it could to make them happy.  To let them have fun.  Magic was sweeter when the three of them were enjoying themselves and allowing the bond between them to grow.
Harry laughed, and Hermione was pleased she had managed to land on a topic of conversation so quickly.  “So. So. Drunk.  The hangover was spectacular.  Got some interesting photos though.  You should have seen Pans, Blaise and Draco partying in the Gryffidor common room, and that is nothing compared to what we did down in Slytherin.”  Harry grinned, clearly remembering the more entertaining parts of the night.
“Thank you for sharing this with me.  There is a lot to unpick here.  This event was clearly an important one but we’re out of time to talk about this today.  Next session I think we should talk about your childhood at the Dursley’s.  I know you’ve always been reluctant to cover this topic but there are some aspects about that time in your life that may help explain the way you reacted.  I’ll see you in two weeks Harry.”
“Yes.  Could you please owl me when you have a date fixed, and please wave their last month’s rent.  Also, could you take the branches cut and termination fee from my personal account, not the joint account you usually use.”
“It’s not just that situation I’m talking about.  I know the divorce hit you hard, and now your Dad’s dating your boyfriend’s father, which can’t be easy either.  I also heard you were fighting with your mum.”
“My Father’s dead.”  The words seemingly came out of nowhere to Harry.  “I… I didn’t know how to tell you.  I didn’t have the right words.  I got a letter from the Ministry.  He’s dead.”
of December when Draco apparated into Kings Cross to pick up Scorpius and the two younger Potter children.  He had arranged with Potter via owl that he would take all three of them back to the Manor for the day.  He watched Scorpius help the red-haired girl, who could only be Lily Potter, off the train; taking her hand as she hopped down the steps to the platform.  The messy black-haired Potter child that Draco recognised from the summer bounded out after them, followed by a bunch of other kids whom he assumed were all friends with his son.  Draco found himself very glad that it wasn’t Scorpius and Albus holding hands and looking at each other the way his son and the Potter girl were.  Draco didn’t think he could have coped seeing his son, who looked very much like him in his youth, happily walking hand in hand with the young carbon copy of Harry Potter.  Not wanting to embarrass Scorpius in front of his friends, Draco waited near the back of the platform for his son to come to him.  When Scorpius finally made his way towards his father, Draco noticed he was still holding the girl’s hand.  Both his son and the girl looked nervous and Draco saw Albus poke Scorpius in the back prompting him to speak.
When Blaise stepped in a few minutes later it was to the sight of the three of them still embracing and tears in Harry’s eyes.  There were tears in the other twos’ eyes as well, but Blaise could see their faces.
“Thank you, sirs.”  Draco said, when they were done.  “We would be eternally grateful if you could advise us as to the best secure and large estate we could live on.  One in England and one on the continent.  We’d also like to take out some galleons, and myself and Mister Potter, at least, would appreciate a pouch linked to our vaults.  We’d also like to be able to purchase in the muggle world without having to come in to exchange money every time.  Could this be arranged?”
“She needs to know how much we love them.”  Scorpius finally managed to force out.   Tears were flowing uncontrollably down both of their faces.
“No you don’t.”  Harry said, rather harshly.  “You no more deserved to be despised than I did when I was a child.”
Blaise winced when Harry said this, and he realised he hadn’t actually told either of his lovers exactly what had happened.
Justin doesn’t take long to think about it.  This is more than he could ever have expected.  This will catapult his career faster than he could ever imagine.  He has to make sure of something though before he agrees.  “Any three questions?”
“Yeah.  I’m gay and am in a committed relationship with two men.  We all live together. I know it’s a bit weird, but it works for me.”  There was a long silence, and Harry stared down, unable to meet Ron’s eyes.  Petrified he’d just made a huge mistake.
She watched as Scorpius took a large gulp of his champagne and closed his eyes for a second lost in thought.  He opened then and looked at her.  She could see in his eyes the pain and love there.  They broke eye contact and Scorpius stood up, keeping their hands clasped and put down his glass.
“I know.  Lily has had so many shocks in the last 6 months I’m not sure how she’ll handle this one.  I think we should talk to Doris about how we tell them.  It’s also probably best if I tell Gin before them too.  Probably Ron and Hermione as well.  Lily has always been pretty close with Hermione and as she’s fighting with Gin at the moment, she needs a grown up not involved she can go and talk to.  I’m thinking about trying to get her to see a therapist as well.”
“Yup.” Harry chortled.  “Now come on.  Let’s get to the room.  At the very least talking about it might give you an idea as to how to complete your mission.”
After class Draco, Crabbe and Goyle confronted the three Gryffindors and proceeded to insult them and take points.  Harry didn’t mind so much, although Ron was fuming.  Harry knew what the harsh words and points removed really meant.  Draco cared for him.  That Harry was the most important part of his life.  That he hated doing this.  At the end of the day, back in the room of requirement, Draco reiterated the true meaning of his words, with kisses in between each sentence.  He also gave points back for things Harry did that pleased him.  There was therefore great confusion the next morning when Gryffindor was equal with Slytherin in points.  Everyone knew that the inquisitorial squad had been ruthless when it came to the removal of house points, and no one could work it out.  Harry had to hold back his laughter at where the points had come from and was insanely glad there was nothing tracking the fact that Draco had given him 150 points for blow job, and another 100 for a back massage in the bath.  Maybe point allocation shouldn’t be done after a bottle of champagne.
Hermione knew Ron was right, but it still felt wrong listening to the advice of Draco Malfoy.  She wondered exactly what had prompted this odd letter.  That the press were the reason for the reinforcement was clear, but they hadn’t given them any warning when Harry had first appeared in the papers, and that had resulted in a ridiculous number of reporters intruding on their lives.  There was only one thing that she could think of being big enough to warrant this.
“I’ve got nothing better to do with my time.  I’m not going back to the Aurors and I don’t want to sit behind a desk at the Ministry.  I don’t want to spend the rest of my life doing nothing productive.  Maybe volunteering with the kids will be fun.”  Harry also thought it might be a good test to see if he’d enjoy, let alone be any good with, large groups of children in case he decided to take McGonagall up on her offer of a job at the school.
“Are you two ready to order.”  The waiter said, before Teddy could say anything to Justin.  He felt like a prat for ordering drinks for the two of them without asking the other man.
The wait at the hospital had been almost unbearable but 24 hours after Draco had gotten Harry from the centre Lily had given birth to a perfect, healthy baby girl.  She had a few wisps of blonde hair and smoky blue eyes.  Harry wondered what colour they would eventually end up, whether she would have the green eyes that he and Lily shared, or the silver grey of Draco and his son.  He didn’t care either way.  When he looked down at the baby sleeping in the cot next to the bed Lily was asleep in, he felt himself fill up with an overpowering love.  Draco had taken Scorpius to go get some food and the rest of the family had all left not long before to try and get some sleep.  It was just him, Lily, and the baby in the room.  He’d thought Lily was asleep but then he heard rustling from behind him and turned to look at his daughter.
“Thanks. I’m going to Andi’s tomorrow for Lunch by the way.  And Wednesday I promised I’d have dinner with Ron and Hermione.  Is that going to be okay?”
“It’s money.  It’s a lot of money.  I don’t even know what you do with this kind of money.  It’s a joke isn’t it.”  Rose sounded confused.
“I guess not. Unless they knew about what happened back then, I don’t imagine they would have gotten why you decided to turn up on my doorstep, of all peoples, when your marriage fell apart”
Blaise did as he was told and took the hand of his very confused looking Father in law and practically dragged him into the house.  Harry, who had let go of Blaise to take Draco’s hand again, led him into the house after them.  When he stepped through the front door Draco stopped in open mouthed astonishment.  Instead of walking into a house they walked into the grounds of a Manor house, almost as large as his own in Wiltshire.  Harry and Blaise had really found and done up the Potter Manor.  The home they owned, but for some reason no one in the Potter family had bothered to live in, or even work out its location, for at least 100 years.
“I’m here because this is interesting, more interesting than anything else in my life at the moment.  And for some reason I trust you.  I saw some of the things
With that Potter pulled himself out of Draco’s grip and stormed off.  The second Potter turned away, Draco felt like he was being ripped in half, leaving him shaking and near to vomiting on the floor of the alcove.  Draco wasn’t sure how long he remained there when a gentle voice disturbed him.
He opened his eyes for a moment and was met with the concerned faces of an aristocratic looking blond and the deep green eyes of a scruffy looking dark-haired boy.  Both looked to be about his age.  The memories started flooding in at the sight of their faces.  Every disgusting, viscous thing he’d done over his lifetime.  A lifetime where he was much older than the 16 years he felt. The disgust that permeated through him made him feel sick to his stomach.  A warm hand rubbed his back, soothingly.  It took several long moments before he’d realised he had vomited.
“Okay definitely your hunger then, Harry.  I woke up less than hour ago, so they would have given me something in the last few hours.  Blaise help us up, would you?”
“Why are we staying here, rather than heading straight to one of the estates?  It isn’t safe here.  Also it’s disgusting.”  Draco said with a grimace, when they had dumped their things in the empty room they’d found.
They arrived at the school and he exited the carriage.  He offered his hand to Ginny to help her down.  She did look beautiful tonight.  She was in a silver dress with royal blue trimming, perfectly complementing her complexion.  Her long red hair had been professionally styled, and effortlessly curled across her shoulders and down her back.  She was the perfect date to have on his arm.  He looked over at Ron, who was now helping Hermione out of the carriage.  He wished he could feel half the enraptured love that he saw in his best friend’s eyes as he looked Hermione.  If it were Draco here tonight, maybe he would, but instead it was Ginny.  The person everyone expected him to be with. The Great Hall was decked out spectacularly.  It was unrecognisable from the last time he’d been in there.  Witches, wizards, creatures, beings, and everything in between filled the room.  There was no sign of the four house tables, that signified the separation, and rivalry, that was drilled into the eleven-year olds when they were first sorted.  Round tables were scattered around the edges of the room, leaving the centre open as a dance floor.  The teachers table was still there on the dais though, and Harry knew his seat would be there.  Where everyone could look up and stare at him.  The table plan confirmed his suspicions.  Ginny, Hermione, and Ron were up their too as well as the dozen or so other people deigned important enough for the honour of the head table.  He took Ginny’s hand and led her up to their seats.  Even if he couldn’t feel it, he could outwardly portray that he was the perfect boyfriend.
Tawly was barring the entrance to the Cheltenham flat when they arrived.  They had decided it was the most likely place for Harry and Draco to escape to after they had checked Draco’s bedroom in the Manor and found it empty.
The two of the all but raced out of the room into the hallway and upstairs, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts again.  Teenagers may be a nightmare on occasion, but he wouldn’t swap any of his three for the world.  He got up and went to the fridge to grab a beer.   Just as he was pulling the door open there was a sound behind Harry, and he turned back towards the door from the kitchen to the hallway.  Rather than Lily or Scorpius, who as far as he was aware were the only ones not outside, Harry was shocked to see Draco Malfoy stood there.  Harry hadn’t seen him since that night when he’d turned up at the house in Oxfordshire.  Somehow, he looked better than Harry remembered, although a little on the thin side.  The suit he was wearing was perfectly tailored.  His hair still as strikingly blonde.  His eyes still that enticing shade of silver-grey.
“You know I don’t mind which, but given your mother seems to be out still and Al and James prefer white, we can go with that.”  Ginny always disapproved of white bread, but then she would probably also disapprove of the large amount of butter, salt and cream he had mixed into the eggs, as well as his failure to trim the fat off the bacon.
“Clearly.”  Draco shook his head in sight annoyance at the question.  “I already told you that.  And it’s beside the point.  Sit down.  I’ve got some more murtlap for your hand.”
“He’s okay too.  A little cross today.  It’s not been the easiest two weeks.  We should get back to him.  He won’t believe you’re okay until he sees it himself.  I don’t want to leave him alone any longer either.”
“Urr… why do you need them?”   Harry shouted back.  He was already dressed and ready to leave, but Draco was a little more particular than he was.
Half an hour passed, then an hour.  Harry wasn’t coming.  It was better this way.  This was all the closure he needed.  Draco finished the last of his drink and stood up to settle his bill.  That was when he saw him.  He looked thinner than Draco remembered.  Tired in a way that Draco didn’t like.  Dark circles under his eyes.  They stared at each other across the room for several long minutes before Draco turned around and made his way towards the lifts.  He knew that Harry would follow.
“Did Ron know too, as well as George?”  Harry felt anger starting to rise up, at Ginny for the affair, George for not telling him and himself for not having realised before now.  He didn’t know what he’d do if it turned out Ron had known and not told him.
“Well what did you expect dragging me along today.  You know how people get when they see us out together.”
“I’m sorry Gin, you deserved better than me” Harry managed to get out, the tears finally stopping, but still unable to look up at her.
Lily swallowed and her eyes remained down as she spoke unable to meet the other girl’s eyes.  She tried to keep her voice as even as possible. “There’s nothing to be worried about.”
Harry hesitated.  He wanted to help.  And he loved having Teddy, but… “If it was up to just me I’d say yes right now.  I need to talk to Draco and Blaise.  And… Are you okay with him staying at the Manor.  Draco doesn’t do well without me there at night.  I mean, he’s better than he was when we last tried, so if you really object I can see about staying at Grimmauld, but…”
“Pomfrey went through my options.  It’s still early enough that there’s a potion I can take that would get rid of it.  I’m just not sure if I can bring myself to take it.”
“Some point in the next week or so.  I don’t actually know the date, but it wasn’t straight away if what he told me when I was younger is true.”
“Hmmm, and I missed all the fun, did I?  The healers were pleased though.  I have a whole new bag of potions.  I think there are a few changes.”
“Harry, stop dawdling.” Hermione insisted as she negotiated through the crowds in Diagon alley.  “I need to get to Gringotts and you’re not helping.”
“Well, I saw him talking to you and then he just wasn’t there.”  Ron continued, clearly not listening.  “What were you talking to him about anyway?  I thought we decided we weren’t going to.  I can’t believe he told the prophet the real reason he ran, and about the fact that he was having an affair whilst he was with my sister.”  That had surprised Hermione too.  Harry hated giving interviews and she was sure that hadn’t changed, but he’d clearly given one.  It was accompanied by a picture too.  Harry and Malfoy were lying on the grass in some park, laughing at something.  Then Malfoy rolling up his sleeves and pushing the hair out of Harry’s eyes.  It was a ridiculously affectionate gesture; one she could never have imagined from the spoilt bigot she remembered.  That was just part of her unease at the photo though, because yes, Harry and Malfoy looked completely comfortable around each other, and she kept on having to tell herself that they had been together almost as long as she and Ron had, and therefore it was completely expected.  No, what really made her feel really ill at ease was the Dark Mark, that was obvious on Malfoy’s forearm once his sleeves were pushed up.  It wasn’t so much its presence in the scene, which even after all this time dragged up feelings of fear, but that neither Harry or Malfoy, nor Teddy Lupin, who was also sat with them, seemed at all bothered by it.  She couldn’t think about that or she’d just end up tying herself in knots.  She turned her thoughts away from the turmoil and instead addressed Ron’s question.
Harry was stood on the rug.  When he saw Draco he grinned before walking up to him, picking him and swirling him around.  He then kissed Draco as if it had been years instead of hours since they last saw each other.  Clearly things had gone well.
When Hermione walked in, she was hit with the smell of disuse.  The youth had been right about it being filthy.  The odour of dust and neglect permeated the air.   No one had been in here for years.
Even though he didn’t have the illusion charm to go with it, Harry placed the confudus ward around his bed that evening before he headed out to the room of requirement.  The bond seemed to understand that they were planning to spend the night together as it hadn’t been as bothersome that day, even though they’d had fewer classes together, and hadn’t been able to touch at all.  Harry collapsed on the sofa in relief next to Draco and snuggled into him when he arrived though.  He reached out a hand to Blaise, who was sat on the floor between Draco’s legs.  Touching both of them made him feel safer than he’d felt in his entire life.
Draco gently laid the sleeping baby back in her cot and tucked her in.  She roused a little but didn’t wake.  Her little fist wrapped around one corner of the blanket Lily and Scorpius had had made for her for Christmas, with little representations of both of them decorating it.  They each kissed the sleeping girl on the forehead before walking hand in hand back to their own bedroom.
Back in the dungeons, Draco fell asleep, under the dark green canopy of his bed, dreaming about a small dark-haired boy who never got enough to eat.
Harry didn’t say anything in response, he just nervously rubbed at his wedding band with his thumb.  The action drew Hermione’s attention to the ring.  It was a different to one to the one she remembered.  It’s not just the ring that’s different, everything about Harry seems out of place with her memories of him.  The age difference between this Harry and memory Harry would be one thing, but it wasn’t just that, and Hermione found it disconcerting. The clothes were a little too rich and smart.  He wore fashionable glasses and his haircut, although still untidy, looked more purposefully messy than it used to.  He had a golden tan and aura of health and happiness.  Even with his obvious stress at being here, Harry looked better than the faded picture in her memories.  The haunted look he’d had since 5
At 3 o’clock Pansy was dressed and ready for the meeting she hoped Potter would show up to.  She’d selected one of the quieter bars she and Draco liked to frequent in Covent Garden.  At this time in the afternoon they should be able to talk in piece, and in the muggle world there was much less of a chance of them being spotted together or overheard.  Meeting in a wizard bar would have just led the papers to decide that the newly single Potter was going to be her next husband.  She walked up the stairs and then out on to the rooftop seating area.  Potter was already there.  He looked a state.  Unshaven in clothes that looked like they’d been slept in, though she was almost certain that wasn’t the case.  The dark circles under his eyes seemed to be a testament to the fact that he’d had even less sleep than her in the last 24 hours.
Draco thought about Potter a lot over December, which he guessed had been part of Doris’s plan.  He thought about all of the things he should have said and done differently back then, as well as all the things he would say now.  He spent far too long fantasising about Potter storming into the Manor and doing unspeakable things to him, worshiping his body with kisses and apologies over the twenty years they had lost.  Pansy spent a lot of evenings with him, insisting that they have dinner together three or four nights a week.  She had been seriously concerned for him after witnessing him break down over Scorpius’s letter.  It had taken him nearly two weeks to pen a reply to that letter, letting Scorpius know that the Potter’s were welcome to spend as much time as they wanted at the Manor over Christmas.  He also wrote to Potter, letting him know of Scorpius’s request and asking if he had any objections.   Writing that letter to Potter had torn at Draco.  He had wanted to pour out everything, to ask Potter to come to him, to meet him somewhere, to forget that they had spent half of their lives avoiding each other.  Instead he had written a short, curt letter about their respective children and their desire to spend time with each other, rather than his own desires.  Draco knew that seeing the other man over the holidays would likely be inevitable though.  Potter had invited him and Scorpius to spend New Year’s Eve at number 12 Grimmauld Place, for the three Potter children’s birthday celebrations.  The thought of spending New Year’s anywhere near Potter stirred up feelings of unease but he managed to shove them away easily – seeing Doris had helped.  Although every instinct told him that he shouldn’t go, it was an opportunity to try and do as Doris had asked.   Just like her knowing why when he avoided her, she also had an uncanny knack of knowing when he hadn’t tried something she’d asked.  Potter had also asked whether it would be possible for Draco to pick up his two youngest children along with Scorpius off the Hogwarts express.  Draco had almost laughed at this.  The two of them acting like civilised parents organising play dates for their children.
“It wasn’t because of me?” Draco’s voice was flat.  Harry wanted the smiles back.  The ones he’d woken up to.
Harry sighed.  He wasn’t getting anywhere and didn’t think he was going to get anywhere anytime soon.  Carrying on talking about it would only make Draco angry, or worse, send him into one of his depressive spirals.  Draco had been so much better recently.  The last thing he wanted was to provoke the black cloud.  He decided to move on, and before long he and Draco were in hysterics over Molly’s latest attempts to get him and Ginny back together.  A small part of Harry felt guilty about mocking Molly and Ginny, but a much larger part, was just happy to have Draco laughing with him.  Eventually they payed their bill and left.  Harry kissed Draco at the gates of the Manor.  Every time they separated at the end of the night it was becoming harder to leave.  He disapparated home, wishing that Draco were with him.
“Harry, I won’t tell you it wasn’t a little rash, but when we told the public it was always going to cause a shit storm.  I doubt this is going to be much worse.  Although, however amusing Teddy found it, I’m really not sure about turning up at the 25
They were in the hotel above the bar.  The smell of sex permeated the room and the were both naked under the thin sheets.  The emotional distance between them was becoming more and more unbearable.  Draco knew that the largest contributor to this was his bracing himself for the inevitable break off.  That Harry had sensed his distancing himself was obvious, as was his dislike at the fact.  Draco knew it would hurt less in the long run if this relationship, if you could even call it that anymore, petered out.  It wasn’t healthy.  His therapist had told him as much when he’d discussed it with him. Having more in his life than just Harry, he could look at what they were doing far more objectively than he’d been able to a year ago.  Still these moments with Harry, where they led quietly next to each other, were still when Draco felt happiest.  He loved the feeling of contentment, that he only seemed to feel at these times, as much as he loathed the fact, that by continuing, he was doing nothing more than fuelling a fantasy that was about to go up in smoke.
Both Ron and Harry moved to sit at the back but Hermione forced them to the front row with Neville. After everyone settled in their seats, the door of the classroom slammed open and the tall dark-robed Potion master strode in.
He slumped against the table in front of the Headmaster's chair with his signature purple turban out of place and an expression of utter terror upon his face. All he could choke out was "Troll—in the—dungeons. Thought—you ought to— know."
"I've read about trolls you see and I thought that I'd be able to do something. I wanted to test my knowledge but if it weren't for Harry and Ron I would be dead." She continued shakily. It was true for the most part, if not for Harry and Ron she would be in pieces and for that she would be forever grateful. She just hoped that she wouldn't get expelled for this predicament.
Harry grabbed a broom from beside him before Hermione interrupted “No!” she shouted. “You'll get us all in trouble, remember what Madam Hooch said.”
The Slytherin team were brutal to the Gryffindors but the Gryffindors fought back just as hard. Creating many fouls and penalties for each team's chasers. Draco spotted Harry and Higgs lazily circling the pitch for the snitch. Despite loving quidditch, he didn't want the game to go on and on since it was freezing in the chilly wind, so he hoped Higgs caught it reasonably soon. It was then when Harry and Higgs suddenly dived towards the snitch.
Harry calmly said, “I just want to go for a walk to clear my head before doing my homework.” He then added, “I’ll be back soon.”
It was dinner time and Blaise and Draco were walking into the Great Hall. Blaise then saw Harry sitting with his friends and guided him to the Gryffindor table. Draco resisted from rolling his eyes, he was hungry and was not in the mood for mocking Harry at the moment. What does a guy have to do to get food around here?
A small frown appeared on Harry's face until he took a deep breath and realised how worn out he was. He smiled gratefully as he quickly agreed to Draco's preposition.
When things were tough and Draco just wanted to relax and not worry about his father's watchful eye, he would head out to the vast spreading grounds of Malfoy Manor. It was tranquil and it helped him think about his troubles as well as come to terms with things that had occurred throughout the day.
As they left through the doors of the Great Hall, Harry piped up “I’m going to go for a walk. I’ll meet you back in the common room so we can complete that DADA essay.”
But Neville, who had been nervous all morning, kicked off hard before the whistle blew. “Come back, boy.” Madam Hooch shouted but Neville continued to rise high into the sky. 12 feet—18 feet. Harry could see even from the ground even with his terrible vision that Neville’s face was turning as pale as a banshee. Before Hooch could fly up to help Neville, he swayed and slipped sideways off his broom. As Neville slammed onto the ground, a clean crack was heard.
McGonagall observed her class to see if anyone else other than Hermione would answer. When no one moved to put their hand up, she sighed and opened her mouth to ask Hermione when she saw a hand raise out the corner of her eye.
Slytherin and Gryffindor firsties soon found themselves walking down to their flying lesson in the afternoon. There were two rows of broomsticks, the Gryffindors lined up on one side and the Slytherins on the other. Their instructor Madam Hooch had amber coloured eyes which scanned the whole class like a hawk before she started reciting how to mount a broom. They were told to stick their dominant hand over the broom handle and say up. Harry’s broom, with a few other people, jumped straight into his hand, although others were having difficulties.
Draco revealed himself and grumbled “Well you’re a popular person apparently. How come you knew I was there?”
"I see," McGonagall said. "Well Miss Granger, you can't just go and disregard direct orders from your teachers. I expected better, from you especially. 5 points will be taken. If you don't require medical assistance, I recommend you head back to your common room where the rest of the house is finishing the feast."
Draco, along with his friends were excited about the game and were discussing outcomes of the match.
“I was there obviously and I witnessed the event too. Except I was more observant than your Gryffindor friends. By the way, don't you ever do that again-“
Raising the bat he swung again, with more force, hitting the troll in the head. As a result, the troll collapsed onto the ground unconscious from the blow.
Wood looked like he had just won the lottery. He had a sparkle in his eyes as he turned his attention to Harry “Ever seen a game of Quidditch Potter?” He asked eagerly. Harry shook his head.
Harry was exhausted, not only from their Quidditch match earlier but also from his housemates. He was constantly getting clapped on the back because of their victory but Harry was not used to any positive kind of touch, so he was flinching left and right. He tried his hardest to move away but most people didn't even notice his distress and had continued to make him feel uneasy.
It was then when all the boats took off the bank and slowly drifted in the direction of the castle. It was quiet for a few moments before conversations continued, as well as Hermione's questioning.
After dinner had come and gone, Draco found himself by the Black Lake. It was a quiet evening despite it still being light, the surface of the lake gently rippled as the cool breeze came. It was the peacefulness that surrounded him that drove him out from the castle.
Quickly forgetting his train of thought, he whispered back. “Follow my lead.’ Stepping back a step, Draco spoke. “Think you're so special, Potter. Getting on the team when first years aren’t allowed. It's a disgrace to the tradition!”
As the Gryffindor table erupted in the biggest cheer yet, Harry got up and walked towards their table. No one in the entire Great Hall noticed how broken their 'Golden Boy' looked as he sat down, apart from Draco and the man in black.
Naturally, all of Slytherin were wrapped up in their green and silver scarves to protect from the cold but as usual, the other ¾ of the school were wearing red and gold. It didn’t help that the whole school knew that Harry was the Gryffindor seeker after Draco ‘accidentally’ let slip of the fact.
Potion's class continued but things only got worse for the Gryffindors. Snape stalked down the aisles between the desks and breathed heavily down all the Gryffindors necks which made it harder to concentrate. Harry made a few mistakes and rough cuts to his ingredients to make his potion average which got him some death glares and being mocked but he was fairing better than Neville. His potion exploded, which earned him a detention.
Draco soon found himself walking to the large Quidditch pitch. He saw a person on the ground and another in the air. As he got closer he hid behind a tree and could see the individuals. Harry was the one on the broom and Draco assumed the other was the Gryffindor captain.
“Well, I should go and meet my mother outside now”, Draco said, “I look forward to our next meeting.”
He was so engrossed in his book that he didn’t notice that the sun had fully risen and it was just after 7 until he saw some other kids groggily walking down the stairs to the common room. Before they went to bed last night, the Prefects told them that breakfast was at 7:30-8:45 and that classes started at 9 so Harry decided to gather all of his stuff he would need for the day and left the common room through the portrait of the fat lady.
"Who cares, it's true that she is an insufferable know it all," Ron said bluntly but stared at her as she ran out of sight
But then Draco’s eyes glazed over the teachers stand and spotted two teachers chanting without blinking.
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word—like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping students silent without effort.
Quirrel's class was a pain in normal circumstances with his stutter but more so for Harry when his scar would ache in each lesson, resulting in a pounding headache which made understanding the lesson much harder. Thankfully Ron would summarize the class for him, not well but good enough for Harry to research in depth later.
Everything was going good, well as good as it could be in a quidditch game when something strange started to occur on the pitch.
Once the older boy had left, Draco snuck out from behind the tree and stealthily walked towards Harry. To Draco's surprise, Harry spun around with his wand out in the blink of an eye before Draco could spook him.
“Is your Godfather a good guy?” Harry asked quickly while shifting his weight between his feet in a nervous fashion.
Draco’s face flushed from genuine embarrassment since he knew that they weren’t the only ones hearing this conversation.
Thank you all for the many views on my story. I honestly expected nobody to read this. Thank you to the reviews on the story . They have given me some ideas for later in the series. *Smiles mischievously*
Blaise eyed him curiously before walking towards the board, muttering under his breath as he observed his options.
Both of them spun round. Harry was just blank, whereas the redhead git looked as if he was caught in the act of stealing something. Weasel sneered and said "None of your business Malfoy."
Harry was also excited for Christmas, like his classmates. That morning McGonagall had come to the common room with a sign-up sheet for those who wished to stay over the break. Of course, as soon as he heard the words come out of his head of house’s mouth, he made a dash for the sheet and hastily signed his name on the form. There was no way in hell Harry would willingly go back to the Dursleys for the break. Not when he could stay at Hogwarts and actually enjoy the holiday for the first time in his life with Ron and his brothers. It was a shame Draco was going home but you couldn’t have it all. That was a lesson Harry knew all too well.
"Hello, my name's Ron, this is Neville and Hermione. You are..?" The redhead asked while pointing at the corresponding person.
Percy, Ron's older brother who loves to boss everyone around, immediately directed the house out of the hall. Harry could tell he loved every second of it.
Harry could see that Draco didn't fully believe him but seemed to be contemplating something. Draco then sighed as if he lost a big battle and said “Well I can tell you he doesn't have the title of the greasy dungeon bat for nothing.” The pair couldn't help burst out laughing, forgetting momentarily their argument
Soon everyone was finishing up and leaving the hall with their friends in tow. Draco got to his feet when he saw Harry leaving the hall. Draco strolled past his friends and weaved around many people before he was practically behind his friend.
That's when he threw the small ball, letting fall towards the ground. Harry dived, completely oblivious to the screams below, just letting his instincts take over. Heart pounding and the blood rushing to his head, he was flying right towards the ground with his right hand stretched out. His hand closed around the ball and he then sharply brought his broom up before he could crash into the ground which he was a few feet from.
It was at that point when Oliver Wood was standing in the doorway, not quite knowing what he should do. So the two continued their ‘bickering’.
“So I guess you will want details on what occurred on Halloween. Correct?” Harry asked, getting straight to the point.
"Hmm." A small voice in his ear said. "A wish to be placed where you can grow and prove yourself. Hmm, very interesting. You have faced many horrors in your past that have shaped who you are as a person. Where, where to put you."
“Well my sister said that every year she has been here, Slytherin has won both the Quidditch and House cup. It's been that way for many years and I doubt it will change now.” Pansy stated, waving her hand as if it was obvious.
“Remember, just walk straight at the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. Go on Ron, quickly now.” Said the mother.
“I for one agree with Zabini,” Draco answered truthfully although he was looking forward to seeing his friend fly and play an actual game.
As everyone began to file out, Harry gathered up his things and whispered a quiet goodbye to his friend. The plan was simple, Harry would leave first and Draco shortly after, to avoid the suspicion that they sat together. Then they would stage a rejected friendship in front of all the first years before they went through to the great hall, to make a rivalry seem plausible.
The night before the holidays, the Gryffindor golden trio could be found studying in the library. Not for homework but for their detective research on one Nicolas Flamel. Although their efforts felt futile since the last few weeks of searching came up with nothing, but they were not prepared to give up yet.
One by one, the whole gang was ready to go. A major rule in Slytherin house was that no one was to go anywhere alone in case an irritated Gryffindor stumbled across them, deciding to have a bit of fun.
The troll howled in immense pain. It rocked from side to side, swinging his bat in every direction until he dropped it, causing one of the remaining sinks to crumble. Harry clung on for dear life and yelled at Ron "Do something!"
Harry narrowed his eyes, he didn't know what Draco was up to but he didn't like it. Not one bit. “Give it here Malfoy,” Harry said quietly. If people weren't looking before, they were now.
"Ron, move around and try to confuse it by yelling and throwing stuff," Harry ordered and Ron was quick to obey.
Harry caught on quickly and replied “You're just jealous Malfoy. That despite being all rich and flaunting your wealth, you got shown up by a Gryffindor. What will your dear housemates say about that huh.”
“Well nobody knows who it is. The team is keeping it under wraps. So some Slytherins are planning to go spy on their practice whenever that is.” Pansy looked around at her friends who were pretending to listen but weren't. Daphne was checking her nails, Tracy and Theo were probably thinking about what they were studying tomorrow, Millie was fiddling with a blanket, Blaise messing around with his hair, Greg and Vince staring off into the distance and Draco had his head down most likely thinking deeply about something dull. She smirked, she knew what to say to get their attention. “We are also holding a betting pool on who it is, winner takes all.”
Draco glared but continued “-Anyway I saw two teachers muttering incantations. Quirrell and Snape. I know Snape hates you and all but I know he wouldn't put a student's life in danger.”
Draco saw the disappointment in the other boy’s eyes and said “Harry, no need to look disappointed, I want to be your friend otherwise why would I be here.” Harry let a small smile appear on his face at that. Draco continued “If we can figure out a plan to deceive my father, then I’m in.”
Soon the whole family had disappeared through the barrier. Harry was nervous that it would not let him through but he decided to just do it so he wouldn’t be sent back to his Aunt and Uncle if he missed the train. He shuddered at just the mere thought. So he ran at the wall, with his trunk and owl Hedwig. He closed his eyes for good measure. When he opened his eyes, before him he could see a beautiful gleaming scarlet train.
Harry was furious. He felt like he had taken a punch to his stomach. McLaggen's comment angered him even more so than Ron who was stewing beside him because he knew it was true. The Dursleys despised him because he was just a freak and a slave to them. Why would they care? If they suddenly treated him like a decent human being, it would be a sign that the world was coming to an end or they were clearly out of their small selfish minds.
These were a few of the many firsties who were sorted. Two of the people who he shared a boat with, Neville and Hermione, were both sorted into Gryffindor. Ron openly groaned at Hermione's as he found her a bit of know it all. Draco's sorting was quick and he was placed in Slytherin. While he walked to the Slytherin table, his gaze met Harry's. They both nodded and turned their attention back to the sorting.
On the outside, anyone could see that Harry was uncomfortable but on the inside, he was having a mini panic attack. He couldn't exactly just say that his uncle would beat him if he got good grades. Who knows what his reaction would be. No, Harry knew that it would be safer if he just lied but a good lie contains a grain of truth.
“Hmm, I'd have to get the headmaster to bend the rules but I can't stand if Slytherins win again, I couldn't look Severus in the eye for weeks.” She turned her attention back to Harry “Don't make me change my mind about giving you detention.” She then smiled “ Your father would be proud of you if he could see you now, your mother too.
Harry stopped suddenly, thinking deeply. Thankfully he was at the back so nobody noticed, well except Ron. "Mate, what's wrong?"
Harry turned around to see Draco leaning against a desk in the front row. “Sorry, I got a bit lost,” Harry replied. Draco shrugged off the apology and asked about how he was hanging out with his Gryffindor friends.
Sweat trickled down Harry’s brow while he woke with a start in the early hours of the morning in Gryffindor tower. He was muttering incoherent words before he could fully grasp where he was, his nightmare still fresh in his mind. He looked around wearily and remembered that he was at Hogwarts in his dorm instead of back in his cupboard under the stairs.
When they moved from behind the statue Ron spoke up and said "Snape is heading for the third floor."
Harry knew that he should tell a teacher instead of running to save Hermione from a troll that would be three times their size but he didn't trust adults. So he nodded reluctantly and the pair raced down a corridor to the nearest bathroom.
Charms class for example was always fun since Flitwick, the small goblin-like wizard, pretty much left them to their own devices when practising new spells. It was ample time to have a conversation with friends.
McGonagall looked as if someone told her that Snape had put on a fake muggle clown costume for Halloween. She quickly snapped out of her surprise and said "Yes Mr Potter, go ahead."
Harry was content with his detention. He found cleaning therapeutic and helped to distract him from troubling thoughts. Despite being treated like a slave and being to cook, clean and what not he still enjoyed it but he hated cleaning at the Dursleys because of how he was punished if there was one tiny mark left. He shuddered involuntarily and resumed scrubbing.
After a few sharp turns and dives which earned him some small screams and gasps, he swung his broom around so he was facing Draco, who looked surprised. They were high enough that their voices couldn't be heard over the soft wind.
Draco gulped worriedly. “You see my family are purebloods and my father thinks anyone that isn’t a pureblood is dirt on his shoe. Especially muggles and muggleborns. I don’t follow those values and neither does my mother but we have to pretend to so we satisfy my father. While at Hogwarts I wanted to start making my own friends, starting with you since you're a half-blood but your Harry Potter and the boy who lived.” Draco paused, worried that he might scare Harry even more after revealing this next piece of information but continued. “My father was a death eater and death eaters back in the first wizarding war were followers of the Dark Lord who killed your parents.” Draco finished.
Harry slowly raised his hand in the air, he couldn't even remember the last time he raised it willing to answer or even ask a question. He was already having regrets but it was too late to back out now. This was his first step forward into achieving better marks. Participate more then improve his written theory. Either way, his guardians would not find out. He was not be stupid enough to go looking for punishment.
"Thanks a million 'Mione!" Harry exclaimed happily and swiftly left Hermione and her studies behind him.
“I'm his and it's a deal.” Weasel butted in without hesitation. Blaise nodded and smirked as he pulled Draco towards their table.
Harry, along with a few others, was close to completing their task when Seamus, a few desks over, threw his wand down on the table in an angry huff and shot his hand in the air. "Professor, why can't we do some more interesting transfiguration like turning a desk into a pig like you did a while ago." He exclaimed.
A young boy with slicked-back blond hair was at Madam Malkin’s one day getting measured for robes when he started at Hogwarts in September, a magical school for wizards and witches alike. To say he was bored, would be an understatement. The boy was more excited to finally receive his own wand that he could use at Hogwarts than standing around in a robe shop. His thoughts were soon interrupted by the small clink of the bell on the opening door. He glanced over to find a small raven haired boy with tattered glasses that had seen better days. The raven haired boy shuffled over to the small stool next to the blond waiting for Madam Malkin to finish with himself.
“Well after the Quidditch match, Hermione, Ron and I went to Hagrid’s and he let slip a few important pieces of information regarding what’s on the third corridor.”
Rumours spread across the school like Fiendfyre. As the day progressed, Draco heard more and more rumours that were more absurd than the last. It was driving him up the wall since there was one common element in everyone’s stories, that the Gryffindor golden trio was involved with the troll incident.
As he came down to the ground with his classmates, who looked at him with aww, a shrill voice rang through the air.
“So to sum it all up, you nearly die from a barmy Headmaster’s plans and start to solve these said plans by poking your nose into where it doesn’t belong with your idiot friends. I’m in!”
One thing was for sure, he wanted to get to know Harry at Hogwarts. He had been told what to do his whole life. It was time to start making his own decisions as his mother suggested. He was now looking forward to the train ride to go talk to the raven haired boy once more.
“Pansy, if you call me that again I will strangle you,” Draco growled but still smiled nonetheless. “I’ve gotta go talk to Professor Snape about his assignment and if I can get some extra credit.”
“Purr-lease. You stuck your head around the corner for a second. Anyone could spot that unnaturally blonde hair from a mile away.” Harry teased playfully.
More and more people came for breakfast as 8 o'clock rolled around and Harry soon found himself sitting with Ron and Hermione. He pushed his food around on his plate while they talked about what classes they might have today.
He made his way back to his friends and asked Hermione the time since she had a small silver watch on her left wrist. “ It's quarter to eight, why do you ask?” She queried.
As they reached dry land once more, they all climbed out of the boats and hurried after Hagrid as he started to walk up to the castle. Once they had all caught up and walked up the stone stairs, Hagrid raised his giant-sized wrist to the door and knocked three times.
Snape’s lip curled into a sneer. “Tut Tut - fame clearly isn't everything.” Hermione's hand was high in the air but Snape took no notice. “ Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find a bezoar?”
That moment of hesitation was all Draco needed to see that Harry was lying. “Come on, we both know that's not true.”
“Now we must bow down to the high and almighty Blaise,” Draco said mockingly. There were many snickers of amusement while Blaise rolled his eyes.
Draco walked back to his common room at a fast pace, deciding to place his bet in before everyone found out about Harry. Sure he was angry and a tad embarrassed but his Slytherin mind couldn't resist placing a bet that was guaranteed.
Before Harry could question what the hat meant, it shouted out "GRYFFINDOR." At those words, Harry's heart sank lower than ever before. He had learnt that hope was a vicious thing. The Dursleys taught him that but he had wished that since he got away from them, things would go his way, but now another person was controlling his life yet again or so it seemed. Now it meant that it would be even harder to see Draco, his first friend he ever made. In the muggle or wizarding world.
So the group made their way up to the hall and sat down at their table. Before anyone moved to grab any food a gasp was heard. The first years all looked at Blaise, who had gasped and was staring at the Gryffindor table with an astonished look on his face.
Harry followed with a sense of defeat, not missing how the Slytherins were sharing smirks of triumph as he and McGonagall walked up to the castle.
“I love you too.  More than anything.  I don’t like that I hurt my old family, though.  Seeing them made me realise again, how badly I treated them.  I don’t think I’m ever going to be able to bring myself to see them again after today, not sure I even want to try, but I still want to do something make it up to them.”
“The Hospital for Integrated Medicine.  But yes.” Draco said, correcting Harry’s use of the old name.
“But I don’t even know Harry Potter.  Why would he give me this?”  Rosie still sounded incredibly confused.
“It wouldn’t have worked between us any better though, would it.” Harry said, approaching the forbidden subject.
“Hey… how are…”  Blaise started, walking into the kitchen, a bag of fish and chips in his hand. “Fuck… Which one of you is a mess this time?”
Draco was not a good cook.  He was not allowed near the kitchen if he was so much as considering making something that resembled a meal.  What he was good at though, was baking.  His cakes, biscuits and pastries were delectable.  Sometimes he made savoury filled pies, although either Harry or Blaise had to assist with the fillings, otherwise the results would be inedible.  But when he made sweet foods, no matter how complex the recipe, it always turned out perfect.  Even if he sometimes went a bit overboard.  But baking was one of Draco’s happy tasks.  Either done to cheer himself up or just because he felt good.  So the odd swing into manic baking was worth it.
“Well” and Scopious couldn’t help noticing her blush and look down at her feet as she said this.  “I… kinda need a tutor for potions and I know Scorp is the best in your year and I hoped he could find time to help me out if it wouldn’t be too much trouble.”  She said this all in one breath, very fast, blushing more.  Al didn’t seem to register this to Scorp’s relief, having gone straight back to eating his breakfast, bored with his sister’s interlude.
With that Scorpius put his book down and placed his hands on her waist.  The two of them started kissing again.  They didn’t hear the door open.  It wasn’t until Rose gasped that they stopped what they were doing and looked up.  Al was stood in the doorway looking shocked, Rose standing behind him.
“Go on Scorp, what’s your problem with the youngest Potter?”  Rose looked a little sheepish.  “You can ask both of us for advice.  I can try and give you a girls perspective, and Al use his knowledge of his sister to help.”
“But we would have been there at the same time.”  Teddy Lupins birth had been registered, and it would have put him at Hogwarts at the same time as him.  “I would have been a first year whilst you were in your seventh, but I’m sure I would have noticed you.”  Justin blushed at this admission.  Teddy Lupin was definitely noticeable.  His hair, like on the day at Grovelands park, was white blond with a curly, casually untamed look about it.  There were magenta streaks in it today, rather than the turquoise tips he’d had before.  It was his eyes though, that were the most mesmerising.  There was no way he would have missed the older boy back at school with the brilliant green and silver-grey eyes.
“It was an arranged marriage and she already knew he was gay.  They split very amicably.  She’s been happily married to someone else for about eleven years.  We went to the wedding.  She even helped me with my hair on my wedding day.  Her and her sister spent and age making my hair not resemble its usual bird nest, as my husband likes to call it.”   Harry smiled at the memory.
The two men were slowly edging closer to each other.  Harry could feel all the tension that had always existed between the two of them build.  If one of them didn’t step away soon he knew he would do something very stupid, but somehow couldn’t move further away from the tall thin man who had once been his.
“Hermione, Ron met my partner when he took me back to the hospital after I quit work.  The partner that bakes, the one with the issues I’ve told you about, had an episode and ended up there for a week.”
“I love you too.  But that doesn’t make this not my fault; you giant git.  You’ve kept this from me for more than a week and the only reason I can think of is that you did it because of what I did when I found out my bastard of a Father died in prison.  It had nothing to do with you going back to work.  It was all a horrible coincidence.  Sure, it would probably have been better had the letter come when either you or Blaise were at home, but it could have been worse.  A week later and no one would have been home to check on me until it was too late.  A week later and you and Blaise wouldn’t have been so sodding paranoid and overprotective of me that Blaise came to check on me at Lunch.”
“Potter’s gay. Well there’s a surprise.” Pansy looked down at him as she said this, and he opened his eyes and looked up at her.  “Not a surprise to you though, is it darling… or so it seems”
“I guess I should go see her and apologise.  The kitten was rather time consuming and when she got near it, it really freaked out.” Harry said, trying not to sound sheepish given that Draco’s was exactly where he was.
“I will Cousin.”  Sirius answered, with complete sincerity.  The six of them were a family now.  Despite the short amount of time they’d all spent around each other, they would protect each other with their lives going forward.
“It wasn’t meant to be sexy.” Draco swatted at Harry, but the other man only dodged and laughed so Draco continued.  “I think not being sexy was the entire point.  Now do you think you can keep your hands to yourself for the night?”
“I’ve arranged a session with a therapist.  I can’t see you like this anymore.  You won’t talk to me, but I’ll be damned if I see you just give up on life.  Go get in the shower.  Your appointment is in an hour.  It’s in Italy, so you’ll need to use the private Floo connection to the cottage in the alps before apparating there.  Thank god the Aurors, or the Dark Lord, never found out about our international Floo.”
“I’m going to get something out of my bag Malfoy.  It’s not my wand.  And it’s not a way to communicate with anyone else.  So please don’t hex me.  It will help us get to the room without being seen.”
The wraith shrieked in pain.  He didn’t think about those times.  Didn’t think about the boy who grew up in an orphanage, unloved and unwanted by anyone.  He felt the other two presences watching too.  They knew his shame.  He redoubled his efforts into battering his way out of what was keeping him here.  Before he could manage to even thrash against the wall again, he was pulled back into the green mist of memories.  Except this time they weren’t his own.
All of the teachers were just as excited for the first game of the season as the students, though some refused to dress in the colour of either team but most were supporting Gryffindor regardless even if they were in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. Of course, the former Slytherin staff members, Professors Sinistra, Snape and Madam Pomfrey were supporting their old house. It seemed that they were the only ones but there was no surprise there.
“Give it back,” Harry said louder than before but it was for naught since Draco had already kicked off and was in the air. He had to admit that Draco was a good flyer.
Luckily before they could continue to pester him, everyone stopped talking as the magnificent castle came into view. All the students were awed by the beauty of it, standing proud on a cliff overlooking the black lake.
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened his mouth to respond. “The truth is that your Godfather, Draco, makes me feel nervous and I couldn't remember anything. It was like everything I learnt just jumped out a window.”
He caught Draco’s eye and they both gave each other a sad smile, knowing that despite being friends, no one could know. It was sad but since when was life ever fair. Just as Goyle turned his head to face Draco, his face had returned to a complete stone expression.
“I hope we don't have a potion lesson today, my brothers told me that Snape can be a real git to us Gryffindors,” Ron stated before saying “Look at him now.”
Momentarily those thoughts were forgotten as golden plates appeared with streaming hot food across the table. Everyone moved to begin eating but they didn't get very far because Professor Quirrel sprinted into the Great hall and up to the head table, causing everyone to look his way.
Draco stood there just staring at the board, thinking of Harry and how good his flying was for the first time. As much as Draco hated it, he knew he should probably support Harry and not be mad at him, even if he didn't like it.
“We’ll have to get back to you on our bets later,” Draco said as he came up with an idea. Harry might know who was chosen and if he did then he could get the money if not all of it.
He could see Draco looked a bit worried but then said loudly “Let's see if your flying is up to scratch Potter.”
Draco threw in a couple of snarky comments here and there but kept glancing over at the Gryffindor table where he saw Harry talking to Granger and Weasel. He may not be like his father, but he did find some of the Weasley children annoying.
He then launched into an explanation about gameplay and the league. It was mainly a one-sided conversation but Harry stiffened less as he grew more intrigued about the game. This did not pass by Draco’s eyes and grew slightly curious about Harry’s behaviour but he let nothing on, his mask of calmness was firmly in place.
Soon the next morning came and Ron and Harry bid farewell to Hermione, with a promise to continue their research. Harry also gave a sneaky glance at Draco's way and gave him a quick smile and to Harry's delight, his friend smiled back with a small wink. So with that, Harry watched his two friends board the steam train and with Ron, they watched the train until it was all but a speck in the distance.
Unlike Ron, Harry wasn't very excited for the feast, since he still couldn't digest as much food as everyone without it coming back up. He was also a bit numb because Halloween brought back bad memories that he would rather forget.
As the annual Gryffindor versus Slytherin game was upon them, the whole school, bar the two teams, found themselves decked out in house colours sitting in the blistering November cold in the stands surrounding the pitch.
Ha, I can't imagine what everyone's faces would be if I just got the right person out of ‘pure dumb luck’.
It was a valid excuse since Harry often went for evening walks to escape from everyone. The peace and quiet meant he was safe and that was comforting to Harry. When growing up, he was often shut in his cupboard for many hours and even days. Yes, he often felt lonely and unwanted but it was his safe place where he could dream up other worlds to escape from the harsh reality of the world.
Regardless of his thoughts, he knew shouting insults and foul words would not help him. So he inhaled deeply, trying to wash away his thoughts and focus on what his next course of action would be.
So Harry went to tell him about the Cerberus and the small brown package Hagrid had collected on his birthday since Harry knew Draco could be trusted. As the story came to a close, Draco was left with many questions that the trio had been asking themselves for weeks.
Once all the first year Slytherins, minus Blaise, found themselves back in the common room, they agreed to hang out in the boys' dormitory for privacy since boys couldn't go into the girls. They all agreed to change into their nightclothes and meet in the dorm. Once the girls had gotten changed, they entered the boys' and grabbed all the blankets and pillows off the boys' beds and dumped them in the middle of the room, while the boys were in the bathroom. Theo was the first guy out and called upon a house elf and asked for nine mugs of hot chocolate.
It was nearing midnight, coincidentally, and they were beginning to dose off into a slumber. As a result of the arrangement on the floor, some of them fell asleep on top of each other. Like Theo on top of Tracey and Mille had her head in Pansy’s lap.
Draco eyed Harry warily and began slowly “I think you're doing the right thing by being cautious. You could be on to something but the question is what is his motive?”
"OVER HERE" Ron yelled while throwing bits of pipe at the surrounding walls, resulting in large clangs but it paid no mind and kept moving to Harry.
An abrupt sound of noise around him, brought him back to his surroundings, realising that Harry had climbed back on his broom and was speeding towards the ground, with Higgs hot on his trail. With a glance at the teacher's stand, Draco saw both Professors had stopped chanting and turned their attention back to the game.
“Why are you complaining, this gives Higgs a chance to get the snitch while Potter is distracted!” Blaise hissed at Daphne, looking delighted.
"I was wondering if Hogwarts sends something like the muggle report cards we got in primary school to our family?" He asked.
As Draco opened the compartment door, he saw Harry flinch violently but figured he would brush him off so he said “I've been looking for you everywhere, can I sit with you?”
Many people were in the library that night, more or less trying to get a head start on their holiday work.
As the door swung open, they were presented with a tall, grey haired witch who wore emerald green robes. She had a stern look on her face as she introduced herself as Professor McGonagall the Deputy Headmistress and led them to a small chamber across from a door where it sounded like the rest of the school was. She gave a short speech about the sorting and the different houses before she left to enter the hall.
The blond was curious about the raven haired since he looked younger than himself. He offered his hand to the smaller boy and said “Draco Malfoy and you would be…”
"OI, PEABRAIN," Ron yelled as he threw a heavy piece of pipe which hit the troll, who merely grunted but still turned his attention to Ron.
When Harry got off the train, he was soon spotted by Hagrid who was calling all the firsties to come over to him and get in a boat.
Harry and his friends swivelled round in their seats to face them. “You're braver now that you're back on the ground Malfoy.”
Draco threw him a relieved look and muttered “Muffliato,” while waving his wand at the door. Harry hadn’t heard that spell before but assumed it was some kind of privacy spell.
The small boy shifted under Draco’s gaze but soon shook his hand and said in a quiet voice “ Harry, my name is Harry.”
Harry thought Ron's opinion was a bit biased considering his family, so he kept his mouth shut from remarking.
It was dinner time and Harry was sitting with his two friends, who were arguing about something but Harry honestly was not in the mood to play peacemaker.
Laughter and loud chatter could be heard all throughout the corridors as students walked to their respective classes. The Christmas holidays were drawing closer and many conversations revolved around holiday plans and gift shopping.
With that Harry left, oblivious to how the Potion Master stared at the gleaming cauldrons in disbelief.
“Now, when I blow my whistle, kick-off from the ground, hard.” Said Madam Hooch. ‘Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet and then come straight down by leaning forward slightly. Ready, three-two-“
“Anyways, how about we head back to the common room,” Hermione asked while looking around at their housemates who were leaving.
Draco saw that Pansy was about to speak when a house elf appeared with steaming hot chocolate. Pansy waited for everyone to receive their beverage before she spoke. “Where were you? You just left without telling us and made us prepare everything.”
Even the teachers were getting into the festive spirit. With decorating classrooms with floating angels and holly. Even the amount of school work had gone down considerably for the first years in light of the upcoming break. Well except in Snape’s class but that was nothing new, according to the older students. He continued to set many assigned readings and essays, which most definitely would turn into holiday work.
It was a good point but Harry would dwell on it later, they had to find Hermione first. "Not here, later."
When Draco had bumped into Harry, he thought he felt Draco’s hand slip in his pocket. So once he was away from prying eyes, he looked in his pocket and found a small piece of parchment. It read
“Um... Charms and Defence sound interesting. Transfiguration too but I also like the sound of flying but I’ve never been on a broom before.” Harry replied hesitantly.
Harry was gaining on the small golden ball and Higgs was behind, unable to catch up. But before Harry could reach for the winged ball, he was almost knocked off his broom by one of the Slytherin chasers, resulting in a penalty for the Gryffindor team. That caused a massive uproar from Gryffindor supporters. Alas, once both seekers were back on track, the snitch had already disappeared and the game continued on.
Before Draco could even comprehend a suitable answer, Harry quickly whispered to him. “Someone’s coming!”
Snape's class was on another level of extreme. For Harry to despise this class more than Quirrel's, was saying something. Snape's constant criticizing and harsh comments were what made him hate the class since it would make Harry think of his uncle.
He looked at Harry, expecting him to look frightened but never thought that he would look sympathetic with a small smile playing on his lips.
Suddenly the castle melted from his view and was replaced by the parlour at the Dursley residence. Harry could feel the blood draining from his face as he realised what memory had engulfed his mind. Before him, he could see himself at the age of 7 beside a large Christmas tree with his cousin Dudley. He had gotten nothing but a pair of old socks whereas Dudley had a massive pile of gifts. His cousin was holding a wooden bat that he had just unwrapped and started to repeatedly hit his younger self with his new bat, while his uncle just watched with an evil grin as he quietly whimpered from the pain.
But apart from that, the students were buzzing with excitement and filled with eagerness for the holidays to come.
Despite what people would think about the Malfoys, Draco didn't like having to keep up a reputation that would please his father. Sure he wasn't the biggest fan of muggles but his father took it to the next level.
A/N Just a quick mention on my upload schedule. I will aim to update every couple of weeks but due to school and life in general , uploads might be inconsistent . Now I'll shut up. Enjoy!
He left through the portrait hole, ignoring the Fat Lady’s complaints. Since it was before curfew, he knew he was allowed out but since it was still his first day so he took multiple wrong turns before ending up by the charms classroom.
Recognising the elegant cursive writing, Harry was intrigued by what was so important. It would be a good time to tell him about what we found out at Hagrid’s. Shrugging, he stuffed the note in his robe pocket. Turning back to his friends, he noticed they were looking at him strangely.
With his hand clutched, he sped up and shoved passed Harry, while slipping his clenched hand into Harry’s pocket.
His classmates soon drifted onto other conversations that Draco gladly contributed to, like politics and news in the wizarding world. News of a Gringotts break-in was a hot topic as well as the usual pureblood gossip.
“Yes and don’t give me some half-baked story, I want the whole juicy tale,” Draco demanded, his eyes daring Harry to do otherwise.
Harry’s dorm mates were all fast asleep and with Ron's snores echoing beside him, he knew he would never get back to sleep. What's a few hours less of sleep anyway? It's not like he wasn't used to it anyways.
As the city turned into rolling hills and the sun began to set, both boys grabbed out their robes and turned around so they could give each other some privacy to get changed. As they sat down, Harry ran his fingers through his hair, brushing aside his fringe in the process. Draco froze, as his eyes landed on the lightning shaped scar that sat predominately on Harry’s forehead.
It was like Harry was in a trance just staring at his younger self but was snapped out of it when he heard his name. Blinking, he was back standing beside McGonagall and an older Gryffindor boy.
Draco was unsure how to respond. A simple ‘No Problem’ didn't seem right considering how his friend reacted to his offering of help. So he stood in front of Harry awkwardly while his friend regained his composure.
Whimpers were heard and they saw Hermione curled up in a fetal position up against the wall while the troll was making his way to her.
Once the two team captains shook hands, while trying to crush each other’s fingers, they were off and up in the air.
Disrupting him from his troubling thoughts, a voice from a table behind him was heard. “That was supposed to be my line.” As Harry peeked out the corner of his eye, he saw that it was Draco who had muttered that line, causing Harry to choke from disbelief. Sometimes he wondered if his excellent hearing was a curse or a blessing.
The confused blond was so busy trying to calm his racing heart that he didn't notice that Harry had caught the snitch by almost swallowing it whole and had won the game for the lions.
They stood in silence for a while. Trying to piece the puzzle together, although it seemed there were many missing pieces to this certain puzzle. How far would they have to go to obtain it?
While Harry knew that making his work look bad was one of the reasons Snape picked on him, he didn't want to change since it was all he knew but one day he lost it.
“So you like potions huh. My godfather teaches that.” Draco responded with a smirk. “Are there any other subjects you like the sound of?” He asked out of curiosity.
When he brought up this matter with Ron and Hermione at lunch, they both had different reactions. Ron just told him he was being paranoid and went back to eating his food. Hermione on the other hand was concerned and suggested that they go look up curses in the library to see if there is anything on cursed scars. Harry shook his head and said, “Nah, I'm probably overreacting.” Although he was a bit disappointed that they didn’t even ask that he was ok but he didn’t mind too much as he was more focused on the upcoming flying lesson.
Professor McGonagall began handing out timetables to the Gryffindors. When she handed the trio their timetables, Harry noticed they had a double potion lesson with the Slytherins first up. He heard Ron huff beside him as he looked at his timetable and threw it down on the table. Harry looked towards the Slytherin table to see Draco observing the other first-year Gryffindors which consisted of Dean, Seamus, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Lavender, Parvati and himself.
The door to the dormitory swung open, revealing Blaise standing in the door frame. “Good job on the setup girls,” Blaise said as he sat in between Draco and Crabbe. The girls smiled, he said that every time they did this.
Not a few moments later, Snape, McGonagall and Quirell came racing into the bathroom. One look at the troll and McGonagall launched herself into a scolding lecture.
The hall erupted into panic and screams. After the headmaster eventually silenced everyone with a few loud bangs out of his wand he spoke "Prefects will escort their house to the dormitories at once!"
Even though he had seen it last night at the feast, he was still taken aback when the food magically appeared on his plate. He ate little, knowing that if he ate more than he was used to, his stomach definitely wouldn't agree with it.
Harry stiffened and hesitated for a moment before replying. “I couldn't remember.” He knew it was lame but Draco had caught him off guard.
“Relax Draco. We're not going to go and duel them. I'm going to tip Filch off so they get caught in the trophy room while we sit in our common room with our friends. What's so bad about that?” Blaise asked, who was amused by the whole situation.
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
As Draco was writing his conclusion on Emeric the Evil for Professor Binns, he glanced at his watch and saw the time. Earlier he had overheard the Gryffindor quidditch captain Wood in the corridors telling one of his players that practice was at 3 pm. Being 4 pm, Draco assumed they would be close to wrapping things up. So he cast a quick-drying charm and hastily gathered his things.
Harry looked around, noticing the broken bits of pipes and taps strewn across the floor "Like this." He said as he picked up a tap and tossed it at a wall. The troll turned his head away from Hermione and looked dumbly around to find the source of the noise.
He stepped forward. One. Two. Three. Until he was right in front of the troll and he swung. The bat hit the troll square in the stomach, causing it to hunch over and wail in agony, making Harry slip off in the process.
"Ahh yes, Professor McGonagall was telling me about the special circumstances since you're on the Gryffindor team now," Flitwick said with joy. Draco just stared at Harry in disbelief. Flitwick continued to ask "What model did you end up getting Mr Potter?"
If anyone knew Professor Snape, they would know that he kept his promises but would he go too far before he could realise how different Harry was from his father in more ways than one.
“Oh, just Malfoy being his jerk-like self as always. Making fun of how I almost fell off my broom.” He quickly made up.
As soon as Uncle Vernon pulled into the train station on the first of September, Harry quickly got his stuff and bolted out of sight before Vernon could stop him. Ever since Harry woke at 5 in the morning, he counted down the seconds until he could leave behind his Aunt and Uncle’s wrath for a year. A whole year! Although his excitement ran short when he realised there was no platform 9 and ¾.
And so he huffed in a very un-Malfoy-ish way and stalked out of the changing room, leaving Harry to deal with a devastated quidditch captain.
As the next morning came and the morning classes flew by, Harry couldn’t help thinking that something was off with Professor Quirrell. That morning the first-year Gryffindors had their second DADA lesson. Like the last lesson, the room was filled with the smell of garlic. During Quirrell’s stuttering lecture that barely anyone could comprehend, Harry’s scar was hurting. He noticed that both times he was in the same room at Quirrell, his scar would start to act up.
Harry chuckled in amusement since that would probably be the closest sort of compliment he would get from the pureblood.
Wood’s face brightened when he fully understood what she said but asked doubtfully “This is not just some cruel joke to tell me to hurry up and choose a seeker is it?”
When Professor McGonagall returned, she ordered everyone into a single file and led them through the huge double doors that opened to the Great Hall. They walked past the students who were spread across four long tables. As they approached the head table where the staff were seated, McGonagall placed a four-legged stool on the floor, while also placing an old looking wizard hat that had many patches and tears on it. After a moment of sitting on the stool, one of the tears turned into the shape of a mouth and burst into a song.
“Draco, you sound nothing like your father from what you have described and if you're worried about being seen together, he doesn’t have to find out.” Harry smirked but then hastily added, “Only if you want to continue being friends, I would understand if you thought it would be too dangerous for you.”
And more importantly, why was such a dangerous beast, protecting who knows what, was doing in a school full of children who it could harm if it ever got loose.
He did not want to pry into his friend’s past but he vowed he would protect him, no matter who tried to stop him.
“I-um,” Harry mumbled while his emerald green eyes gazed at Draco as if he was contemplating what to say next to the blond. Draco’s own silver-blue eyes gazed back at the emerald eyes, curiously waiting for what Harry had to say.
Madam Hooch bent over Neville, quickly accessing his injuries, ignoring how Neville’s broom slowly floated towards the forbidden forest and out of sight.
"Why was Granger so-" Draco cut himself off as he saw Harry's tired look in his eyes, no doubt from the many daring dives and just the hectic school day in general. "People will start to wonder where we are if we don't go back. I'll talk more when we can meet up again." Draco suggested.
As they turned a corner, Harry could hear fast paced footsteps coming from behind them. He pulled Ron behind a stone griffin statue in an attempt to hide from whoever was coming and it worked as Snape rounded the corner and briskly walked past, oblivious to the Gryffindors.
Ron, true to his word, did understand but looked rather uncomfortable. "I..fine. Let's go before someone or God forbid Percy finds out."
As Harry entered the Great Hall, he noticed that there were little to no students in the hall, only a few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. He sat down at the Gryffindor table at the end closest to the door.
“Oh yes. Go complain to your daddy dearest. He’ll make all problems disappear in a click of his fingers for his baby.”
Beside him, Ron began grumbling since they hadn't had the chance to ride the brooms. Harry was only half listening when he saw Goyle point to something in the grass to Draco. Bending down, Draco picked up a Remembrall, which Harry recognised from breakfast. It was Neville’s, who received it from his Gran via owl post that morning
They made their way down a few corridors when they smelt something disgusting. It smelled as if there were a couple of dead animals that had never bathed when they were alive. It was then they saw the troll turn the corner.
Quickly everyone scooped up their processions and left. Harry just wanted to roll his eyes at his classmates as he walked with Ron to the tower, they could be so daft sometimes.
"I'm not sure Neville." He lied, he liked Neville, he was quiet and seemed nice, but he thought that Ron would go mental at him wanting to be in Slytherin because of what he had said about them.
Surprisingly, Harry found it quite easy to imagine that actually happening. He could barely suppress his laughter at the mental image.
Harry waited to the right of Ron for Professor McGonagall but also for Draco, who was a few feet away, to initiate the second part of their plan.
“Oh, so basically there are 4 houses at Hogwarts. The people in your house are the people you have classes with, eat, sleep and spend time within your specific common room. Each house has different traits which people in the house may possess or strive to be. Ravenclaws are the smart ones, Hufflepuffs are the kind ones, Gryffindor..” Draco paused, trying to find a less insulting word for big-headed jerks. “.. the brave ones and Slytherin are the cunning ones.” He finished, pride of his house shining through in his voice.
“Sorry.  It’s just, I finally talked to Draco last night.  Properly.  Everything else around me, the both of us really, is falling apart.  But somehow, the two of us have finally decided to try and make this thing work.  It’s Draco’s son that got my daughter pregnant and I’ve spent most of the last two days on a downward spiral, but his friend finally kicked some sense into me. Now I just feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me and I can finally breathe again.”
James gave the password and they all followed him up the stairs.  Rather the seeing McGonagall sat at the desk, her Dad and Mr Malfoy were in the room.  Her Dad was leaning against the desk watching the other man pace the room.  Both of them seemed nervous.  They looked up when they heard the teenagers enter.
“One of whom?”  Blaise kept his voice as calm and stand-offish as he could manage.  The cool Slytherin mask firmly in place.
Draco acquiesced though and Harry watched and listened as fingers danced across the magnificent instrument.
“Yeah.”  Harry grinned.  “Draco managed a few spells he hasn’t been able to cast in years.  Including sending a stinging hex at me when I was being annoying.”  The smile never left Harry’s face and he pulled Draco tight into his side.
Harry came back out of the bathroom five minutes later feeling more composed.  They discussed the children and what they would do about them.  They laughed about some of the problems they’d had over the years that now made much more sense.  He told Ginny about Doris and the help she gave him both in the past, and more recently.  They even talked about Lee and the baby.  They drank tea and ate, and it was like they were friends again, rather than the couple who could barely stand to see each other from a few weeks ago.  Harry felt happy when they left, having made progress on at least some of the practical decisions, such as what to do with the house, and most importantly what to tell the kids and when.  Ginny had agreed that they shouldn’t wait much longer but definitely wanted them to be told in person.  Ginny’s healer wouldn’t let her make the journey to Scotland by magical means and her job wouldn’t allow her the time off to get there by muggle ones, so she agreed that Harry could do it alone.  She also agreed not to tell Ron and Hermione about Harry.  It was his place to let people know.  They made an arrangement for Harry to go and tell the kids that Saturday.  This meant that Ginny could be available if they wanted to see her.  They also arranged for Ginny to come over to the house the following week to sort more of the practical tasks.
“Okay… I know it didn’t work last time, and the timing isn’t great with the funeral coming up, but we’ll deal.”
“Not anymore, munchkin.”  Harry said, forcing a smile onto his face, so as not to worry the baby.  Draco was very sensitive to other people’s moods, and would be liable to kick off if Harry didn’t at least try and pretend to be okay.
“Draco, I don’t even really know how bad it is.”  Harry squeezed Draco’s hand in reassurance.  “I love that you want to be here and support me, but I don’t want it to bring back bad memories for you.  I know it’s likely to bring back horrible memories for me.  It’s not because I think you’re weak that I don’t want you here.”
“I don’t know what to do.” His voice breaking with the overwhelming feeling of dread that had settled on him.
The latest lesson wasn’t going well when Draco came in and interrupted them.  Montegue, who’d been missing for more than a week after the twins had shoved him into the broken vanishing cabinet on the first floor, had been found.  Snape left with Draco and Harry was alone in the room.  Harry let his mind drift.  He was irritated at Snape for not believing that he had already mastered the aspects of occlumency he had been instructed on, but that it just didn’t work against Voldemort.  He noticed the pensive sat out of the way, that Snape always siphoned certain memories off into at the start of every lesson.  It didn’t seem fair that Snape was allowed to keep things from him, but he expected Harry to be happy for the Professor to see every painful and intimate part of his mind.  Still, it seemed like an intrusion to look at these memories.  The devil of curiosity and annoyance won, and he touched the silvery substance, diving into Snapes memories.  When Snape pulled him out, righteous fury across his face, regret was already eating at Harry’s insides.  Not at Snape’s anger, but at what he had seen. His father and Sirius had bullied Snape as badly as he himself used to be bullied.  Snape had been right about his father.  He was exactly as arrogant as he’d always told him.
“Well, you’re going to have come back to mine and tell me all about it.  I’ve missed your arrogant arse.  We all have.”
“Morning, love.” Harry yawned as he pulled the half-asleep man next to him tight into his arms.  His head hurt from the amount he’d drunk the night before.  “I feel slightly shit.  Did you put any hangover potions aside?  I’d rather like to not spend the day feeling like some has removed my brain, wrapped it round a lemon, and beaten it against a rock.”
“And you’re not just here to enjoy my excellent company? Tea?” George said waving his wand at the kettle, which instantly started to boil then pour the hot water over the tea bags that had floated out of the cupboard and into two mugs.
“I will admit, I was surprised when Harry told me about his relationship at first.  I just couldn’t see how three people could manage without jealousy coming into play and destroying it all.”
“Not really.” Al didn’t look up as he replied.  “Thought you’d be with Lily.  She lost it completely when Dad told her mum was pregnant and ran out of the room.  Not that I blame her.  I kinda wanted to run too.”
The two of them spoke as if they were one person, and it was a little unnerving.  Especially with how enthusiastic the two of them sounded about whatever half-baked plan they’d come up with.  Blaise watched as a tumbler appeared on the edge of the bath near Harry, and then noticed the half empty bottle of whiskey and two other glasses that they’d obviously been using earlier.  Alcohol seemed to be the only way to deal with this whole mess of a situation.
Lily seemed happier than he’d seen her since before Christmas.  It was near the end of the night when she’d come up to him, hugged him tightly, and told him that she couldn’t imagine better parents for her baby than the two of them.  He tried to tell her not to rush the decision, but he knew he was practically beaming at the news and he wanted nothing more than to rush to Draco and swing him in his arms with the joy.  Harry didn’t let it go to his head though.  Despite Lily’s desires, It was obvious Scorpius wasn’t anywhere near making this decision, and in order for this to work, both of them had to be happy.  Neither Draco, nor he, could accept any other way.
“I think I’m going to be spending a lot of my free time in the library.  For tonight however, I think we should probably just go to bed.”
“How do you know about it?”  Draco asked whilst simultaneously pulling Potter to the couch.  Blaise moved to sit on the other sofa opposite the pair.
They sat their quietly then, Harry eating his chips whilst Draco watched and wished he could just take one.  He’d barely noticed how badly he’d slipped back into his old, disordered thoughts about food and eating over the last few months till today.  Clearly Doris had though.
Harry, feeling safe and comforted surrounded by the love of the two people who were connected to him down to his core, explained everything that had happened from the moment the vision had hit.
“Harry, let me help you.”  Sirius said.  Harry couldn’t find his voice to answer so nodded.  Sirius was quickly by his side, wrapping an arm around him to support him and help him up the stairs.
“Where is Teddy this evening?”  Blaise asked, slumping onto the sofa with a glass of wine.  Harry passed him a portion of fish and chips.  They had decided that they would eat the least pure blood meal they could think of this evening.  Draco had both loved and hated his father.  He had pushed himself to the edge of his limitations to attend the funeral this afternoon; now was a time to embrace the fact that his father was an imperfect bigot.  Fish and Chips straight out of the paper seemed like a pretty good memorial to that side of Lucius Malfoy.
“Okay, no problem Malfoy” Al’s dad replied and with that his father turned and left without even a goodbye.
“The room seemed to know better again and decided we were to bath together.  Strip off and join us.”  Draco said, humour evident in his voice.  “We want to test something.”
“Yes.  But you have to promise not to tell anyone about us.  And you cannot let anyone know about little Harry once we have him.”  Draco glared at Sirius when he said this.
time in as many months he’d ended up in the hospital.  The last two times he’d only had to stay one night and was back to work within a week.  This time it had been two weeks stuck in St Mungo’s with healers fussing over him.  He really only remembered the last four or five days of his stay though, having been put in a magically induced coma for the first week, and then on so many potions when he first woke up, that he was barely conscious of his surroundings.
“She was… You know what, never mind.”  Draco sounded exasperated, and Harry really couldn’t blame him.  Giving a school child such a potentially dangerous piece of equipment just so she could go to a few extra classes, that weren’t even necessary, was a little ridiculous.    “Granger being giving a time-turner when she was 13 is not the issue here.  Yes, potentially we could cause a paradox by changing things.  But we’ve already changed things by just being here.  Us sitting in this café and drinking this tea is potentially changing things.”
Harry felt a glimmer of hope.  He wanted nothing more than to trust what Malfoy was saying.  “What can we do?”
Blaise went and grabbed his work sketchpad and pencils from his bag and quickly drew Teddy a picture of a cake.  The toddler seemed happy with this, although Blaise was fairly certain the boy had been after real cake and not a drawing.  After handing over the drawing, he sat down and began to sketch out the scene before him on the bed, with Teddy, Draco and Harry all playing and laughing.  He’d just about got the outline done when a nurse came and knocked on the door.
“That was lovely.”  Harry said as Draco lifted his fingers off the keys with the final chord ringing out.
“Are you two going to explain?  This feels like another conversation where I’m missing at least half of the facts.  I get that you two sometimes have this weird mental understanding between each other, but I don’t and I need to understand if I’m going to look after you, which seems to be something I have to do.”  Blaise interrupted.
“Yes, that would be great.  I think it will probably embarrass them less if it’s not one of their parents walking in on them.”
“That was why his hair looked like Mr Potter’s.  He found this photo.” Andromeda said, handing over the photo of Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny lying beneath a tree by the lake at Hogwarts. “It was on the coffee table in Grimmauld place when he entered.  Sometimes when his emotions run away with him, his metamporphmagus abilities take on a life of their own.  Going to the house the godfather he doesn’t remember left him and seeing that photo.  It was a big day for him.  You badgering him about the Godfather he doesn’t even remember distressed him, and he came straight here to tell me.”
Malfoy gave a small laugh, but his wand remained pointing at Harry.  “Never thought I’d hear the day you’d say I’m right.”
“Right now, I don’t think you can do anything.  Me and Draco hope he’ll be strong enough for company in a few days.  I want to go back and sit with him soon.  Draco wants to brew some potions to help Tom recover faster, and neither of us want to leave him by himself.”  Harry responded, then he looked over at Sirius, and he knew his godfather wasn’t as willing as Narcissa to give Tom a chance.
“It’s more…well…” Harry took a breath and then blurted everything out. “Our marriage seems to be falling apart.  She’s never there, and when she is, we either don’t say a word to each other, or we argue.  Something feels wrong, but I don’t know what, and I don’t really know how to fix it.  Hermione and Ron say I just need to sit down and talk to her, treat her to a night out, a holiday, but I’ve got this nagging feeling that she’s hiding something from me.”
“I wouldn’t.  But I’m sure the stars will understand that it’s December and cold out here.  You need to be wearing some clothes if you want to talk to them more.”
“Draco, what was that?”  Harry asked as they stumbled out of the floo at the Manor.  As soon as the device was destroyed they had flooed straight from Grimmauld to the Manor.  It was a risk, but as the only people who could get in the house were Harry and Teddy, and being a toddler, Teddy posed no threat, they decided to risk it.  No one else would be able to trace the floo journey with the protections over the house.
“Lily, what’s wrong?” Scorpius said as Lily burst into the room and ran straight into his arms.  She couldn’t reply straight away.  Instead she just threw her arms around him and sobbed into his chest, comforted by his gentle stroking of her hair.  He pulled her onto one of the sofas and wrapped himself around her.  Somehow, Scorp always seemed to know what she needed.  They sat there in silence except for the sounds of Lily’s sobs, the minutes quietly passing, before there was a sound from the door.
“I think she worked out she wouldn’t be a grandmother around the same time I turned up at the Manor with Harry and went on the run.”
“No point at all. Just that people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.” Lily had a fondness for idioms.
Harry walked close to Draco and placed himself between the other man’s legs where they were hanging down in front on him.  He put a hand on each of Draco’s knees.
“Blaise…”  Harry appealed.  “You should go back to work.  Like I told you this morning, Draco and I will be fine.  We’ve got this.”
“Every fucking time he rejects me.  Makes me feel like I’m nothing.  Yet somehow I can’t bring myself to stop when he’s in front of me.”
Both Lily and Scorpius nodded, stunned into silence.  Lily wasn’t really sure whether she’d understood everything Pansy had said.  Pansy either didn’t see or chose to ignore the unease Lily was sure her body language was shouting.  Lily noticed that Scorpius looked more curious than anything else.  As if his silence was because his eyes had been opened to a world view he hadn’t thought of before and was hungry to learn more about.  It reminded her of how she felt whenever McGonagall started teaching about a new principal involved in transfiguration.
“That’s fine.”  Harry replied, and squeezed Draco’s hand gently.  “She can stay at the Black house and you can decide what you want to do in the morning.”
“Again. I repeat. None of your business Malfoy.”  Potter sounded very pissed off.  Draco didn’t like the tone.
“Yes.  I decided against accepting it when I accepted the Malfoy one, but I want as much flexibility as possible right now.  The heir vault has a decent amount of gold in it if I remember correctly, and Uncle Rodolphus and Aunt Bella are hardly going to notice if it’s in use.  They don’t care about much except what the Dark Lord wants.  I would have accepted the Black one, but you named Harry as your heir later, and I don’t want to overrule any decision you might decide to make in the future.  Although, had the war not been happening in 1996, I probably would have fought Harry legally for it, after you died.  The Black estate and seats would have been useful, and Harry wasn’t even claiming it.  I didn’t know he had no knowledge of how wizarding heritage works.  I thought he was being arrogant.”
Justin found a table tucked away in one corner.  It wasn’t a particularly good table, as there wasn’t a view of outside, but the place was crowded, and he was pleased to just find somewhere to sit.
“I’m sure it will be perfect.  Now I do have one favour to ask.  Would the three of you be able to manage Teddy tomorrow morning.  I think I should have a word with my sister.  It’s been a few years since I’ve seen her after all, and I fancy catching up.”
“I’m okay now, my Harry.”  Draco said when he finally felt able to let go.  “So we need to get into Hogwarts and get the diadem.  I suppose we should wait until September for that one.”
“And still… did you or did you not see me taking my fucking potions?  You can be a right prat sometimes, Potter.” It wasn’t the usual teasing way Draco called him by his last name, it was the sneering way he remembered from school and Harry hated it.  Draco knew Harry hated it. Sometimes falling back into their old school rivalry was too easy.  Even though Harry knew he was in the wrong right now, he couldn’t seem to stop himself from continuing the argument that had started out of nothing so quickly.
“I’m… Sometimes I forget I’m not the scared little boy in the cupboard anymore.  I like that I don’t have to be the brash Gryffindor around you, but sometimes… It would be nice to have a little of his confidence… even if I was just pretending.”
“Miss Nott, I have been very happy with the service here over the years, however due to circumstances out of my control I would like to move back into to Grimmauld place.  I’m not aware of the current tenants’ arrangements in terms of their contract and notice period, however I would like you to do everything possible to allow me to move back in by Christmas.  I am aware this may be inconvenient to those living there, but I am willing to compensate in order to achieve this.”
“Prat, I danced with you more than three times at our wedding.  Anyway, that isn’t the point; are you going to dance with me or not?”
He took the few vaguely useful books he’d managed to find to the defence corridor just before 9pm.  He decided this would be the earliest Potter was likely to be done with his detention, although given that last night it had been nearly 11pm before Potter was let out, he expected to be in for a bit of a wait.  He couldn’t miss Potter though.  He needed to know why Potter hadn’t used the anaesthetic cream he’d provided, and try and persuade him to do so the next few nights.  He couldn’t go through another evening like this.  He was not a person who could deal with pain.  Unlike Potter it seemed.  That was something.  Potter had said his relatives had prepared him for dealing with pain.  That went against everything he’d ever been told to believe about the other boy.  He was meant to be this spoilt prince.  But that didn’t fit with the way Potter talked about his relatives.  As if they had been anything but the loving family who treated the saviour as the special snowflake he was.  Was he wrong in his assumptions?  What did that mean the flashes of pain over the first half of the summer meant?  The hunger pangs when he knew he had eaten.  The blinding headaches.  The aches in limbs that made it feel like he’d spent all day working muscles beyond endurance.  The short sharp blows to his stomach, and bruising kicking sensations on his shins.  He was feeling Potter’s pain, that much was definite.  He didn’t know what each of those pains meant but there was something even more perturbing, that he hadn’t considered.  If he was feeling Potter’s pains, did that mean that Potter was feeling his?  Did Potter feel the punishments his father had given him. Because he didn’t think he could deal with the humiliation of the other boy knowing.  Sure, they weren’t as frequent as the phantom pains, but they still happened.  More so this summer than ever before.  His father loved him; he knew that.  He knew that beyond doubt.  But this summer was the first time he’d been subjected to the cruciatious curse.  When end of year results came through, and the Granger girl had beaten him again in the school rankings.  His father hadn’t been pleased, and with the Dark Lord bearing down on them, he’d had no choice but to show his extreme displeasure.  His mother had soothed him afterwards, and his father had apologised, but it had showed him exactly what following the Dark Lord meant.  It meant hurting not only those you hated, but those you cared for too, or face a worse punishment.  It wasn’t something Draco wanted for himself.  He was fairly sure he wasn’t going to get a choice in the matter, however.  His father had insured that before he was even born.
“Thank you, Tawly.”  Harry said, smiling.  The elf was always trying to mother him and Draco.  Saying they were both too thin.  Draco with his year of severe depression and constant anxiety, and Harry with his years of abuse and starvation had taken their toll on both of their bodies.  It also didn’t help that neither of them were too good at remembering to eat.
“Do what Teddy?”  Harry said, teasingly before returning to Draco’s neck, although the pawing had changed from affectionate to as showy as he could make it, just to embarrass Teddy.
The warm hot mouth enclosed around him and Harry lost himself in the sensation.  He may have said some incomprehensible words at some point, but mostly he stayed silent, gripping onto the bench behind him as his world reduced to only the feel of Draco.
“What’s he supposed to do?” Potter sounded indignant, a hint of temper starting to show in his expression and tone.  “The Headmaster says I have to go there.  Look I don’t really want to talk about it.  It’s shit, but it is what it is.  I only have to be there a few weeks every year.”
“I came to the conclusion, when wondering around feeling sorry for myself after Pansy tore strips out of me for how I’ve behaved, that I have spent years getting in the way of my own happiness.  I don’t want to do that anymore.”
“Mr Potter” a very young-looking witch spoke to him.  She didn’t look much older than James, maybe just a little younger than Teddy.  “How can we help you today?  No problems with our management of your property I hope?”
“I would have thought it was obvious.  My husband’s funeral is in two days and I’m here to see my son.  To offer him what comfort I can.”
“You’ll explain it to me at some point though?”  Harry didn’t like the idea of Draco hiding anything from him.
The same girl was behind the counter as last time he was here.  Harry nodded at her as he walked past and into the workroom through the door at the back of the shop.  George was sat behind a desk concentrating on an enormous amount of paperwork but looked up at the sound of the door opening.  He smiled when he saw Harry.
“Selfish prat.” Harry chuckled, moving Draco carefully and getting into bed beside him, trying to leave enough room for Blaise to get in behind him.
“You were definitely irritating.  You managed to irritate two of my friends quite significantly in relatively short interactions, I’ll have you know.  You’re dislike for things Weasley seemed to stick around in your smaller, fluffier form.”
year of this strange communication had been focused on Teddy.  She couldn’t help but smile at one picture of Harry, a very young Teddy, and Draco, the three of them curled up together in their pyjamas surrounded by Christmas wrapping paper.  The most surprising one in that album, however, was of Harry, Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy and Andromeda, stood with Teddy at Kings Cross on Teddy’s first day at Hogwarts.  She had no idea how they pulled that one off without getting caught.  The 6
“Angelina”, Harry said as he turned towards his friend, whom Draco hadn’t noticed until this point was sat in the office with Harry.  “Do you think you can let the rest of the family know?  I want to go straight to be with Lily.”
“I know I do.”  Harry paused.  He didn’t want to say the next bit, though he knew he should.  “I froze.”
“No.” Harry knew Draco liked this park.  It was one of the reasons he’d walked here, rather than just going to the park opposite the tea shop.  It might have been further away, but it had never failed to make Draco smile in the past.  Watching the water birds on the man-made lake and the children running around the playground in the summer sun.  It wasn’t warm today and there weren’t many people here, but this was still a place where they’d been a peace together.
Scorpius didn’t like the way his father sounded.  There was something about the tone that worried him. “Father…”
“I’ve seen a few people since the divorce but nobody long term.  At the moment, I’m quite happy with my gardens and greenhouses here in the school grounds.  It doesn’t really leave much time for meeting people.  Why’d you ask?” Neville seemed a whole lot more relaxed than Harry was at this subject.
“Was that weed I smelt coming from James’ room?” Hermione asked as she sat down next to Angelina and poured herself a glass of Scotch from the bottle in the middle of the table.
The did eventually manage to fall asleep, although not a quickly or chastely as Draco had planned.  One kiss turned into two, and then they were making out.  They both ended up in just their underwear with legs tangled together before they finally managed to stop.  They stayed like that, facing each other and breathing heavily before Draco caved.  He kissed his way down Harry’s chest stopping when he reached the band of his underwear.  Then slowly and deliberately he started to ease them off.
“Harry and I, and Cousin Sirius and little Harry have been here for a week.  We were just waiting for Father to be out of the way to come and get you and little Draco.  There is a room already set up for you.  We’ve put a second cot in little Harry’s room for little Draco, although we can move it to your room if you’d prefer mother.”
“And you still love me anyway.”  Harry smiled, looking deeply into the silver-grey eyes of his husband.
The tea was perfect and the biscuit he dipped into it delicious.  He relished the warm sweetness as the biscuit melted into his mouth.
In my head although Harry had warded the room most of what was going on with it was due to Grimmauld Place's reaction to his feelings about it.  He was depressed and keeping this part of his life secret from everyone and the house responded.
“Yeah.  According to Harry it’s a lot nicer now than it used to be.  No house elf heads on the wall.  I never got to see it in that state, but it was a dump when I first got it.  Harry basically abandoned it when he ran off with Dray.  There was fifteen-year-old milk left in the fridge.”
“I can do that.  Do you need to get your things from the dungeons?  I dragged mine from the hospital wing, but neither you nor Draco have anything here.”
“Draco today.  I would quite like to talk about Lily and Scorpius with you and Draco together.  We decided that if we’re going to try and make this relationship work, with everything else that’s going on, we should probably try and tackle that situation together.  With Ginny too I suppose, although Lily’s not exactly happy with her mother right now.”
Blaise let in a short gasp and squeezed Draco into him.  He was not going to let the Ministry take Draco away from him and Harry.  Draco had complied with all of their conditions.  His parole and house arrest had been over for a year.  There was no reason for them to start interfering.
Draco felt Harry stroking his hair and looked at the man he loved.  Whatever happened next, he knew everything was going to work out fine, as long as the two of them were together.  That they had each other and their family supporting them.
“Good to know.  I don’t think of you like that either.   Still can’t quite believe my Dad thinks of other guys that way though.”
“Have you tried?”  Potter tilted his head to the side as he asked and made eye contact with Draco.  It felt nice having Potter’s attention on him.
“My life is still shit.  The meglomanic living in your house has been trying to kill me since I was one remember.  Nearly has on no less than four occasions to date.  And he held me under the cruciatus curse himself this summer.  So I think I win.”  The last words made it clear Potter was trying to change the tone back to what it was before. The weird competition.  Not the scary dark place it had managed to dive into without their permission.  Draco pounced on the change in mood.
“Tomorrow” Harry said out loud “if you’re not back to your usual self I’ll have to tell someone.  Until then, I guess I should, find you somewhere to sleep that isn’t on top of me”
Birthday.  The moment both of you were arrested I was able to access the wards.”  Draco had speculated that Harry probably would have been able to do it anyway, even before they had gotten married and before the arrest, but they had never had the need to test the theory.  But Lucius didn’t need to know that.  Nor did he need to know about Blaise for the moment.
Harry bolted for the bedroom and slammed the door shut, moving the dresser to bar entry.  Then he hid under the bed.
“Harry, if this is what you want to do and what you think is best, I will support you.  If you wanted the two of us to go see them together, I would do that.  Even if you wanted me to go see them alone to try and explain, if you thought that would make you feel better, then I would do it for you.  Fuck, if you wanted me to dance naked in the middle of Diagon Alley then we would come up with a way to make it work, although I would have some reservations about your sanity and the amount of influence Blaise has on you”
Lucius looked undecided for several long seconds and Harry was sure he was going to refuse.  The only back up really was to level this place and that was too risky.  There were too many variables and he didn’t think he was strong enough to take on all of the guards and whatever auror force they brought in without Draco physically at his side.  He didn’t even have any of his wands with him and he wasn’t sure how he would get back in without the plan he’d laid out.  Lucius closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Hermione’s feet hurt from walking to Islington.  It wasn’t that it was so far, but she wasn’t exactly wearing the best shoes for traipsing across London.  She turned the corner into Grimmauld place.  The little square in the middle was full of summer flowers and insects.  She remembered how dingy and horrible the house had been when she’d first seen it as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.  Disused, neglected and filled with dark magic.  Even during their stay, during their time on the run, when it had almost been a home to them, it hadn’t exactly been a great place to live.  After the war Harry had eventually made it into a beautiful home, even if was one that held a secret.  The rooms had been light and airy, the garden covered in flowers.  She wondered what it looked like now, empty for all these years.  Would everything be covered in dust?  Would the flowers have died?  She was overcome with the wave of emotions.  It was all too much.  She sat down heavily on the bench opposite the house, where she thought her friend had been happy.
“Get up you two.  You missed dinner last night and Cissa won’t stand you missing breakfast as well.  Besides your mini doppelgangers are asking after you.”  Sirius shouted.
“Fine.  But I want the Malfoy kid’s wand too… Both of them…”  Harry didn’t question how Sirius knew Draco had two wands.  He was a Black and raised in an old pureblood family.  He probably had two too.
“Spit it out.  How long have you and Lee been having an affair?  Months?  Years?  Is this even the first time you’ve been cheating on me?  I heard what you said about us.  Maybe this isn’t even the first person.”
“He did.  Let’s not talk here.  I’m assuming you haven’t eaten, and I’m starved.  Let’s go round to that little Italian place.”
At 3am the monitor linked to Teddy’s room alerted and Harry crawled out of bed sleepily to see what was up with the toddler.  When Harry reached the bedroom Teddy was in, he heard sobs and quickly rushed in.
“The Minister appeared and saw Voldemort, so at least they know he’s back.  The Death Eaters that were still there were captured.  I’m so sorry.” Harry said remembering who one of the arrested Death Eaters had been. “Your Father was there and was arrested.”
“Yes you were you idiot.  And if you’d bloody well listened to me and run when you had the chance, you wouldn’t have been.”
“He’s as well as can be expected at the moment.  Aside from the Jam production line.  I don’t really want to talk about what happened.  It was pretty bad.  But he’s home now.”
“So, Harry, what has brought you into see me?”  Doris said, her character changing from the eccentric aristocrat to therapist the second she had entered the room.  It was one of the things Harry had always liked about seeing her.  The professional in this room, almost felt like a different person to the one the outside world saw.  He trusted this person with secrets he’d not shared with anyone, and not once had a hint of what had been discussed in this room made it into the papers.
“Anything you want,” and still laughing Harry made his way off the grounds apparated straight to the Manor and Draco.
Harry sat at the table long after Pansy left, working his way through the cigarettes and drinking too many overpriced coffees.  When the night crowds started appearing, happy looking couples and larger groups of muggles looking like they’d come out straight from work, all drinking wine and cocktails, he left.  Rather than heading home, he walked down to the river and across Waterloo Bridge.  Walking down the south bank he thought back to the happy day in the summer when things had been so much simpler.  Yes, his marriage had been falling apart around him, but it was easier when he was barely noticing, and being out with his friends and his kids had been a good day.   His leg was hurting, and he knew he should stop, or at least use his stick.  It was with reluctance he unshrunk the hated thing before he continued walking.  The night air was cool with the breeze coming off the river.  He could hear the sounds of people happily talking in the various bars and restaurants.  He wondered if any of their lives were as much of a mess as his was.  Whether any of them would be looking back at this night as the happy memory before everything came crashing down around them.  He lit another cigarette.  There were still two left in the packet.
“You mean like you have over the last few years.”  Harry spat, anger bubbling up inside him rapidly.  He wasn’t sure whether it was really anger towards Narcissa Malfoy, or whether it was just because he’d had to leave a distressed Draco.  There was nothing he hated more than leaving Draco when he was distressed.
“What do you mean not exactly?  You didn’t get a message from her that morning telling you to meet her at your usual rendezvous?  You didn’t then disappear off the face of the earth?”  Ron said, sarcastically.
“She’s been through more than most people realise.  People see her and think she’s this stuck up bitch whose had more failed marriages than should be acceptable.  I’m not saying she’s not a stuck-up bitch whose had more failed marriages than should be acceptable, because she definitely is that.  But she’s also kind and funny and has always been there for me. Even when she was going through her own crap.”
“Some of it was because I thought no one would believe me.  The Dursley’s made out I was a troubled child who often hurt myself with my aggressive behaviour.  My teachers in primary school were always wary of me because of that.  And when I did finally tell an adult, they sent me back there anyway.  Dumbledore, in his infinite wisdom, decided I would be safe there.  He purposefully kept all knowledge of the magical world from me.  He was the one who left me on the doorstep.  It was cold and little Harry was left there.  If I hadn’t taken him, he would have been there all night.  I was left there all night.  It was only Dumbledore threatening the Dursleys that stopped them from throwing me straight back out when they found me.  And when I told him I didn’t want to go back there when I was at Hogwarts and finally knew about who I was, he was the one who told me no.”
“Because the don’t want to pressure us.  Because they want to give us an opportunity to spend a little time with her.”
“I’m going to go get changed out of these wet things.  I’ll grab you some dry clothes too.  Drying charms are never as good as warm clean clothes.”
“And one I’m completely innocent of and of which you can have no evidence to state otherwise, therefore, I feel it’s prudent for me to wait for representation before I allow you access to my estate and person.”
“There’s a wizarding philosophy course, but that doesn’t really cover any of this stuff.  Modern ethics isn’t really their style.  It’s at Oxford though and there’s a pretty great muggle philosophy department there.  I should be able to come up with a programme to combine the two courses.”
“We don’t have to do it all at once.  And we can ask the elves to help.  I’m sure they’d be overjoyed to do anything that makes you happier.”  Harry knew this was true.  The elves were absolutely devoted to Malfoy.  Harry may not understand it but doing anything that made Malfoy even the slightest bit happier, improved the mood of every elf he met in the house.  The creatures would do almost anything to please their Master, whether Malfoy, or himself, asked it of them or not.  Harry was not above going behind Malfoy’s back in this matter either.  As long as they weren’t explicitly forbidden to do something, they were more than inclined to take his suggestions if they benefited Malfoy.  He didn’t think he’d have to resort to that in this case.  He could see that Malfoy was interested in his idea.
Out of everyone, Ron was the most invested in Harry and Ginny’s relationship.  Even more than Ginny, and her radiant joy was obvious to all around her.  Ron’s enthusiasm couldn’t be matched, however.  He was going to be Harry’s brother, truly and properly, and his ecstatic satisfaction should have been infectious.  It would have been infectious had the dread of what he was doing not be stamping all over him.  Had he not been completely and irrevocably in love with someone else.  Someone who he’d have to tear apart all of the strings that tied him to the family he’d created to be with.  The Weasleys didn’t deserve that.  They’d taken in the child who’d couldn’t remember what love felt like and welcomed him into their home.  He was finally going to complete the bonds that tied them.  He was determined.  He thought he was determined.  Each day that ticked away ate at him.  His phone burned in his pocket, calling at him to contact Draco.  To try one last time untangle the mess he’d made of everything.
“Children.  We really should go inside.” Pansy said, trying to reign them in.  The problem was, now they were here, none of them really wanted to walk into the hall full of people.
Harry guess they had all be asking him about how he was and what had happened, but it had all been a cacophony of noise to him.
“They’re not okay.”  Harry shook his head.  “Neville is raised by his Grandmother.  They…  they lost their minds in the attack.  When I saw them, they didn’t even know who Neville was.  They’ve been on the long-term ward in St Mungo’s since… well I suppose today.”
“Your children have been back at school for around six weeks if I remember the term times correctly.  You’ve been avoiding me.  Something happened.” It was a statement, not a question.  “Something happened to make you avoid me, and something happened to make you come and find me today.”
“It’s just a little hard to concentrate on.  It was so much better when we all used to study together.  I seem to spend most of my time reading Pansy’s books.  It’s completely fascinating.  They have teams of people in hospital’s who as part of their role make difficult decisions about patients’ treatments, like how far to escalate care or when to withdraw the machines that are keeping them alive.  I didn’t know anything like that existed.  Do you think St Mungo’s has a similar system?”
Harry slumped onto the table, his head in his hands.  He couldn’t move.  He couldn’t think.   He didn’t know how long had passed before the waitress disturbed him, letting him know the café was closing for the evening.  He payed his and Draco’s bills and then left.  He was due at the Weasley’s for some kind of party soon.  He couldn’t even remember what it was for exactly, just that he’d promised to be there.  He would have blown it off but sitting by himself in his lonely house was even less appealing.  At least there he could drink in company.  Could pretend that his whole world hadn’t just collapsed.
“Yes you did, Teddy.  Now how about you come to the kitchen with me and you can help me make a cake of your very own.”  Draco replied, with a warm smile.
Draco thinks about not saying.  About lying.  But he can’t do it any longer.  He wants Blaise to know.  Wants to be able to talk to his friend about this.  “It’s Harry fucking Potter.”
“My…my….” Lily hiccupped, dragging the courage to speak the words from somewhere inside her.  “My period is late.”
“Do you think we did the right thing by talking to that journalist?” Harry asked, worried about what Narcissa had said.
“I’m glad.” Ginny replied and smiled at him.  It had been a long time since he’d seen her smile like that at him.
“Harry!” Draco called, starting to panic.  He recognised that noise.  Someone had apparated nearby.  There was only one reason for anyone to apparate here today.  Someone knew they were in here.  “Harry you need to be done, now.  I think someone knows we’re here.”  Draco shouted up the stairs.
Harry didn’t feel quite so happy about Ginny’s absence.  Since his accident it was becoming a more and more frequent occurrence.  He knew he probably hadn’t been the best husband since it happened, sitting at home and feeling sorry for himself in between throwing all his effort into physio didn’t make for the best relationship, but she hadn’t even bothered to tell him she wasn’t coming home yesterday.  She was also breaking her promise to the kids that she would be joining them for back to school shopping.  Instead he would have to manage the three of them plus the shopping by himself.  It wasn’t that this was a chore in particular, Diagon Alley still seemed a place of wonder, even after all these years.  It was just that with his leg, moving around the crowds wasn’t so easy anymore.
Narcissa did as directed and pricked her finger.  Blaise splashed a little of the blood from the phial over the 1
“How do I do that?  I don’t want to leave you here by yourself.  I don’t even know if your Dad’s in right now.  I can’t go and get him from the centre and leave you in the house.”  Scorpius was starting to panic.
“Harry.  You shouldn’t feel guilty about this.  My sister and the others are the ones to blame here.  You can’t be expected to save everyone.”  Narcissa said gently.  She may have only met the boy a couple of days ago, but she was a mother and could see the weight of guilt he was piling on himself.  She felt very protective of him and didn’t want him to do that to himself.
“Maybe about 5am.  I’m so coming home from work early today.”  Blaise downed the last of his coffee, and poured himself a second cup before slicing some bread.  He tried to put it in the toaster, only to realise he’d sliced it too thick, and he had to pop under the grill instead.  “Toast?”
“I’m glad.  I want you to have the life you want too, but I’m so proud that me and your mother managed to raise a child that won’t run afraid from things that scare him.  You’re better than me in that respect.”
“Harry, Ron say’s you wanted to speak to me.”  Robards said, overly gently, as if Harry was a frightened animal.
“No.  I… I want to be placed on exclusive desk duty for at least the next six months.”  The words came out in a rush.  Robards just looked at him stunned.  Speechless at Harry’s request.
“And both me and Draco will be furious if you don’t leave.  It’s important for the healers to check on you.”
“We activated the old blood wards on the property.  No one can leave or enter the Manor without either an heir or yourself with them.  The Ministry haven’t been too bothered with getting in there yet, so they don’t know.  They’ve been too busy rounding up the other Death Eaters to worry about your wife.  They don’t see her as too much of a threat.  They will try soon enough, and I have to get Draco out before they do.  They cannot know about the type of wards activated until he’s safe.”
“I’ve written to Moony.”  Sirius announced at breakfast the next morning.  “If I’m going to the Ministry today, I needed him to know everything first.  Just in case.”
“No.  I’m not going to tell you where I live and I’m not going to talk to anyone else.  I don’t want to.”  The statement told Hermione more than she wanted.  Harry was choosing to protect Malfoy and their life together, over trying to make it up to her and her family.  The only reason he’d come here was to protect Malfoy.  All the things he’d told her about the pressure he’d felt under before he left, paled in comparison to this.   She’d spent years worrying about him and he’d just forgotten about all of them.  He didn’t care.
“You’re not.  Besides, you’d have to go back through Grimmauld to leave, and… urr… we’re kind of hosting your sister there for the night.”
“Do you want to know what’s really sad though.  There was a way that this could have all played out differently.  One incident, before me and Ginny got back together, that could have changed everything, but I doubt you even remember it.  Draco walked out of bookshop and I knew that none of you would accept him.  You wonder why I did what I did.  Look back at those two years.  Really think about what I was like.  Think about how you talked about Draco, and the Ministry and public’s attitude towards him.  The person I was then was resentful of the way you treated me and the person I was in love with.  I’ve grown up enough to know now that it wasn’t all your fault.  That all the lies and secrets I kept played a large part in it.  But I was miserable and none of you could be bothered to see it.  I have to go now.  Draco’s waiting for me and I want get back to him.”
Harry wants to pull Draco onto his lap, but has a pretty fair idea that that won’t be taken well in a children’s play area.  He puts his hand on Draco’s knee under the table, and away from any prying and disapproving eyes, and gives it a gentle squeeze.  He takes a sip of his fairly disgusting and overpriced coffee from the small café.  He can’t believe the stuff is even more expensive than the drinks at the hospital.  It also somehow tastes worse.  Then he notices Draco looking, with what Harry thinks might just be longing, at the young teenagers racing down the large slide over in the main area.
Harry whispered this last statement longingly.  The remark was harder on Draco than he thought it had any right to be.  He’d pushed aside all thoughts of this man for over 20 years.  They had each made their decisions at the time.  He didn’t know what to do, yet he couldn’t let Harry Potter leave by himself in this state.  He also didn’t fancy contacting any of Potter’s friends to come and collect him. Merlin only knew what Potter might say.
Harry woke up with a large dog half draped over him.  He still felt like shit, but it was a little more bearable.  There was still a constant tugging at his head and chest telling him he was in the wrong place.  It was also accompanied by the now familiar gnawing sensation, only about ten times worse than it had been at school.  Still, he managed to shuffle himself from underneath the Animagus. In doing so, however, he managed to accidentally shove Sirius unceremoniously off the bed.
When Harry had arrived at the Manor no one had answered the door.  He knew from the papers that Narcissa had left the country after the trials and was living in France.  Lucius hadn’t escaped Azkaban.  The door was slightly ajar, so he had walked inside, calling out.  The whole place felt wrong, as if Voldemort and the Death Eaters had left their taint in the walls and furniture of the grand house.  A crack ripped the air and a house elf appeared in front of him.
Lily shook her head feeling completely overwhelmed by the bluntness of the woman sat talking to them.  Scorpius just rolled his eyes.  He’d known Pansy for as long as he could remember.
“Teddy and Andi told me about Hermione’s visits.”  She’d expected as much, but it didn’t explain why this caused Harry to give up hiding all of a sudden.  Having managed to stay hidden for so long without a trace, he clearly knew what he was doing.  Even if she managed to find out his location from either of the Malfoys, he could have just moved.  It’s not like he didn’t have any warning.  And it certainly looked like he had the money to do as he pleased.
“He was playing the piano early this morning.  I don’t know how early he started, or how long it went on for.  But it worried me.  It worried Blaise too.”
Draco just waved his hand lazily as he felt Harry get out of the bed and heard him start to rummage for his pyjamas so he could go and comfort their daughter.  For the first time in days Draco didn’t have a headache.  Between that, and the cosiness of the bed he’d nearly drifted off to sleep when Harry re-entered the room.  He didn’t think enough time had passed for Harry to have gotten Callie back to sleep.  He rolled back over and forced his eyes open.  Harry was walking to the bed with the sleepy blonde baby in his arms, the blanket she loved still held in one fist but with one corner being chewed on determinately in her mouth.  Draco sat up and accepted the girl as she was passed over.
“It does, there are some things I can’t explain and this is one of them.  But it’s important that we’re protected.”
“All outside at last count.  We took some of George’s sparklers out to them about half an hour ago and they all seemed to be accounted for.”  Angelina answered.
year.  And Malfoy killed Dumbledore… Harry was devastated after that.”  Ron was starting to sound cross.  Hermione could just feel despondency creeping over her.  Like one of the dementors was in the room sucking out her happy memories.  One that was focused on only her happy memories of Harry.  She tried to be rational.
At that Hermione laughed.  “Yes, that does make it a bit more believable.  And I didn’t really come here to talk about Malfoy and his ill-mannered pets, however bizarre that seems.  I wanted to talk about Ginny.  I think she jumped to a weird conclusion seeing Malfoy here yesterday.  You staying out all night last night didn’t help, although how she thinks you were at Malfoy’s is beyond me”
“I know Moony.  I held them at wand point for a fair while when they found me.  But I went to Gringotts with them and confirmed.  This is our Harry.  This is James and Lily’s Harry.  We’re staying at the Cheltenham place… you know the one we used to sneak out of Hogwarts and use when the horse racing was on.  Only Harry could have got us in there.  Just trust me Moony.  When we get there you can see little Harry.  He’s there at the moment with my cousin and little Draco.”
“I want all of this to have never happened.  I want to be enjoying time with my friends, stressed out about essays and exams, thinking about what I’m going to take at NEWTs.  I don’t want to have to think about what’s best for a tiny human that hasn’t yet been born, or how it’s going to fuck up my life whatever I decide”
“Just fuck off Harry Potter.  I can’t look at you anymore.”  Hermione let the pain of rejection fuel her words.  She ran back into the house in tears.
Harry had laughed when he’d seen Pansy’s daughter arrive with her mother, recognising her from the estate agents.  From the expression on Pansy’s face, he’d known that Susan had probably told her all about his visit at the end of the summer.  He found he didn’t mind so much.  Despite everything he remember about her from school, Pansy was clearly not the complete bitch he remembered from school, and she obviously cared for Draco.  He couldn’t help but like anyone who’d protect Draco.  He introduced Susan to James and Teddy, who were closest to her in age and they all seemed to get on well. There’d been a lot of giggling as they’d conspicuously snuck at least one bottle of Draco’s good whiskey and disappeared soon after, so it was a fair assumption.  He was pleased that they seemed to get along so quickly and easily.  Having the two sides of the odd collection of family he seemed to have acquired was a good thing.   Even Daphne and Hannah were there, dragging Neville along.  He’d said hello to Neville briefly when he arrived but with everyone else there he hadn’t much time to spend with his old friend.  He did notice that Neville, his ex-wife and her partner had spent most of the night talking and laughing with Pansy though.  He also remembered looking over at Daphne and Draco talking at one point.  Both of them looking close to tears but hugging and smiling. With alcohol pleasantly buzzing in his system, rather than overpowering it, he couldn’t help but be pleased that a place that held so many unhappy memories was filling up with good ones instead. That the old memories were being wiped clean.
“Well don’t worry about that, Potter.  It’s myself I’m mad at.  Although don’t think it didn’t hurt seeing you and little miss Weasley all coupled up.”  Again, there was no anger, just resignation and an aura of grief.
“Well he doesn’t have to find it so hard this time.” Narcissa said, firmly.  It seemed now she was outside of Lucius’ control Narcissa wanted to mother everyone.  Harry was glad Narcissa was supportive though.  If she thought it was okay, Draco would be less worried about accepting the situation.  “Go get him Siri and we’ll be waiting back here.  Tawly.”  The elf popped up in front of her.  “Can you make a celebratory dinner for tonight.  We’ll be having a guest coming.”
“I believe this is why you two shouldn’t be left in the house together for extended periods of time.  You’re a bad influence on each other.”  Tara chastised.
She guesses she must look a fair fright, if she’s reading the look of concern on the boy’s face correctly.  “I’m fine, honestly.  Just had a bit of a shock that’s all. I saw you walk out of that house and thought you were someone I knew.  I’ll be fine.  I promise.”  She tries to reassure him.  Her freaking out is enough, she doesn’t want to impose on the young man, who seems so kind.  Mostly she just wants to get away from here and go home.   She’s already embarrassed herself enough for today.  Then something she wasn’t expecting happens.  The boy’s hair shifts from scruffy and black, to sleek and turquoise, his eyes remain the same disconcerting heterochromic green and grey, however.  The expression on his face seems guilty somehow.  It’s been a long time since she’s seen a metamorphmagus and she looks at him astonished.
Narcissa, to her credit, didn’t react with outward shock.  “Mister Potter.  I have to say I’m surprised to see you here.”
“Shhh… it’s okay Tom.  I just don’t know what you remember.  You’ve been pretty out of it for about two weeks.”
“Hey you.” Draco said with a kiss to his forehead.  “You ready to tell us what all of this is about?”
