"Why are we gathering?" she asked, as her fears ran with her thoughts.
"True," Ginny laughed, "hey, I know you think boys are 'revolting', but what do you think about Dean Thomas?"
"Er, not really." It was Draco's turn to shush them.
"I have to sort some things in my head," Draco said, still turned towards the door. She dropped his hand. "Take care of yourself," Draco said, and walked through the doors out of the Great Hall. There was an ache, filled deep in his abdomen. He didn't care where he was going, just so long as it was away. He found himself in a dead end, where the silence lingered. He sat to the floor, and didn't bother about how dark or dirty it was where he rested his bum. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths. He knew painfully well that he had only two choices that he loathed. To forget all of his ambitions and be with Harmony, or to kill his emotions and stick with his plan. He knew the stakes, His family and glory over being a traitor and possibly getting killed. Draco wasn't good, he didn't know how to be a hero, or do what was right. The feelings he felt for Harmony was a stranger, but it was something that gave him a simple happiness. It lit inside of him, and deep down he knew that he couldn't stop himself from sticking with her, even if he forced himself to be rotten. It would destroy him, it would be worse than a crucio.
"Hah, you wish," Nott said from where he leaned against the wall, he flipped his wand in the air and grinned. "You better watch yourself, Potter. There's more of this waiting for you."
She didn't know if she was beautiful, but she knew that she would never be called ugly. She smiled at her reflection and decided that she made a pretty good girl. If she was still a guy she would definitely check herself out…wait she was herself, so it wouldn't matter if she would take a look. She couldn't help but slap her face, feeling like a moron. Her whole body structure was undeniably that of a girl and with her hands she could feel her pelvis bones jutting out. Harry blinked a few more times at her reflection and took the courage to grace the elder men with her presence.
"Only metaphorically," Ginny said.
"Father!" Draco shouted, but something else stopped him. Mr. Malfoy screamed and kneeled to the floor. He was clutching an arm that now hung uselessly. Draco watched Harmony with an open mouth, not being able to read what lay behind the anguish. She staggered to Black, and Draco found that his body too could move. Those nonexistent weights that anchored him soundlessly dropped to the floor. He ignored his father who still clutched his arm as he went to the trembling girl.
It was an owl and it was flapping furiously, brown feathers dislodging from its wings and floating through the air. Its claws were outstretched towards Lewis's face, which he had been shielding using his arms. Matron Anna was trying her best to hit it with a wooden spoon and failing. Draco stifled a laugh, watching as the owl moved out of Matron Anna's reach. He noticed that it was holding something white in its beak, and when he squinted, he could see that it was a letter.
"Um, excuse me?" He said to his shirt, feeling very stupid. "How far away is she?"
But still, this snake was different. The other times he could pretend that it was normal, with a perfectly reasonable explanation. The time he went from Point A to Point B without remembering how he got there? Maybe he just spaced out for some time. And even if it seemed that no time had passed, maybe he was just really out of it. When Lewis's hair had turned green, maybe someone had just swapped out all his shampoo with hair dye (
The snake, which he still hadn't thought of a name for, had wound herself around his torso and was perched over his shoulder, twisting her head around so she could stare at his face.
"Snape," Sirius Black said, returning his nod with one of his own. The men then proceeded to ignore each other as best as they could, turning to look at the eccentrically-dressed man standing before them.
Using his spoon, he fished the letter out of his bowl and pinched the corner of it with two fingers, letting the clumps of porridge still on it fall back to join the rest of the slop.
"Snakes do not have names like you walkers do," the snake said, her tongue flicking in and out. "But I suppose you may name me if it makes you happy."
"Is it true?" He asked, allowing Draco to grab onto his pinkie. "What they're saying? That the Dark Lord is
At that moment, the wizarding community would celebrate the defeat of the worst Dark Lord they had seen in centuries, and throughout it all, they would whisper one name with awe and joy: Draco Malfoy, the boy who lived.
This took a while to write, whoops.
"Now that pleasantries are out of the way, let's get down to business," Black said, stepping towards the sidecar connected to the main body of his motorcycle. He reached in and pulled out a carrier, the type that most muggle families would use to hold their newborn children. Inside the carrier lay a baby, his silver eyes peering curiously at the group of men clustered around him. Running down the left side of his face was a jagged lightning scar, starting from his forehead and ending at his chin.
"Really who was she?" Harmony asked, confirming that they did not realize that it had been her.
Before Harmony could even think of feeling confused or annoyed she heard a flurry of footsteps.
"You can't get rid of me so easily," he said and leaned closer so that his legs were brushing against hers. Her body shuddered as he placed a hand on her shoulder, and through the white shirt, she felt his warmth. She couldn't understand how he could do all of this, as she looked like Harry Potter and had just rejected him. His hand went to her neck, and she was reminded of the last time they were alone in a train compartment. He was closer than before, and he brushed the inside of her shirt before pulling out the locket.
"Perhaps you should have gotten a more skilled wizard to resurrect you." Voldeomrt looked at Severus with loathing. "Or maybe it is something more." Severus was mindful of the books as he moved across the room, in thought. "Something that cannot be foreseen."
"Yeah," she shrugged, "so what."
The late summer air spilled through the high windows, bringing with it orange and golden rays. Soft foot steps padded the stone floor making little insects scamper about. Harmony slinked through the halls, not wanting to be seen. She kept her wand out, preferring to feel the reassuring touch of wood. The door she wanted to pass through appeared benign, but she could never tell. With one last second she glanced the halls for students before turning the doorknob and pushing it with enough momentum to swing her in. No one was there.
"That would be pretty low if you thought that food could win me over." Draco smiled and wrapped his arm around her back. Like a pal, Harmony told herself.
"Ron," Harmony said in a low voice, "you are really asking for it. Stop behaving like such an insufferable prat." She pulled out her wand and faced him.
After purchasing five bras and under garments of multiple colors, she was then dragged into clothing stores for the fashionable witch. She had a sinking suspicion that McGonagall was actually enjoying herself, which grew ever more prominent with that self-satisfied smile that would not leave her face. By the time both of their arms were overflowing with bags, her stomach growled in protest.
Draco and Harmony's First Fight:
She saw the words that he didn't need to say as she held his gaze as he leaned closer to her. His kiss brought her a small smile that molded to his lips and she only had to stop when her heart rushed till it hurt. She rested onto her pillow and Draco pulled his chair even closer so that he could hold her hand.
"Snape didn't see?" she asked.
Hardly any students remained at Hogwarts, and those who did, avoided him. He faintly recalled being irritable for the past month, perhaps snapping at people. Casting some hexes, blasting people out of his way, that sort of thing. Draco noticed that the few stragglers he encountered stared at him wide eyed, and stepped far to the side of the hallway until he passed on his way to the West Tower.
Her footsteps echoed in the dark corridors and the cloak fell from her shoulders as the door to the room materialized, she stuffed the cloak into her bag. She wrenched the door open, and Harmony stepped inside. "Sirius?" she said. She waited for an answer that didn't come. The room was big, but not grand enough to get lost in. Was he asleep? The door creaked behind her.
"I got in a fight with Ron," Harmony whispered back, "and I didn't want him to think that I was secretly cheering for Draco."
The chill of the February air permeated through the potions class room, and Harmony rested her head against the coarse, deeply rigged wood. She watched as the cauldron bubbled and sent a warm blue light against her cooled cheeks. She wondered how long she could stay with her head on the desk before Snape said anything. The last time she had made three minutes. Her hand neared the flame and warmed up to its glowing. The ring on her finger danced with a faint red color, and Harmony glanced at Draco who watched the timer on their desk. She could read him better, tell when something was bothering him. It must have been from all of that time they practiced Occlumency, that hinted at certain things behind his gray eyes. Draco turned the timer over, and the black streamed from the tiny opening at the center. He stirred the potion counter clockwise twice, and noticed Harmony's current state of boredom.
"Nothing, I just wanted to see you." Something was wrong because no guy would say that to another guy with a serious expression. She could barely keep her eyes away from his intense stare. "You look better though without your glasses." Was he flirting with her, she would have laughed three days ago as a boy, but now she felt a bit intimidated and unsure. He continued to smirk and stare. Was she still capable of besting him in a match; was she even equal to him anymore? It was like he could see right passed her mask and see the squirming girl she had become.
"Looks more like he's torturing you, Harry." Ron turned away from his little sister.
"There is something more about it, it's dark, I don't think you should keep it." Kreacher hissed at that and stuck out his hand further. "What are you going to do with it?" Harmony asked.
"Ah, Hermione," Ron said, "but I was getting to the good part."
"Oh." She laughed at herself, relieved.
"What ever is the matter, boy?" Trelawny asked and took a step back. Students were enraptured by the now very exciting drama.
"Because if you need to, I can take it back." Draco wondered how Harmony had become so selfless. She must have gone through Hell, wearing that locket for a week. He took some comfort in knowing that wearing the locket was helping her.
"But why would a wizard be named after a muggle station?"
Pain seared his arm, and Severus leaned against his office door, before slamming it shut. He grit his teeth, mumbling rotten words that soured the air. Harmony had caught him off guard, and he did not want her to see him clutching his forearm. He wiped his brow, unaware of the sweat that gave his pain away. He made it to his desk and opened one of his drawers with his wand which only responded to his wand tip. His hand swept over brewed bottles, selecting one shaped like a spinning top. He flicked it open, before downing it. Severus closed his eyes, trying to escape in his mind.
"Voldemort is trying to figure out why he is turning into a woman, or into something like a woman." Dumbledore twirled the end of his beard between his fingers.
As she backed away from the approaching dragon, a branch caught her foot, making her fall. This momentary distraction allowed for the dragon to pounce. It sailed in a perfect arch, claws extended and jaws ready to rip her in half. Harmony could see Voldemort's bliss, right before zoning in on the dragon. It was when they made eye contact that she felt a warmth over her heart. She didn't fear the dragon, or approaching death. She thought of her parents, of Sirius, and finally of Draco before closing her eyes.
Ginny didn't have the energy to be angry anymore. She leaned against the stone halls, not knowing what she was going to do. If she hadn't had six older brothers to toughen her up, she would have been crying right then.
"No one's found out yet that you are dating him?" Harmony asked.
When she landed, Luna sat at the top and waved down at everybody. Luna stood up and took a few steps then began to float down and cheers greeted her. She landed on her feet and they sat down further away from the others, breathing hard. "That was certainly challenging," Harmony said, but she was glad that it had cleared her mind.
"Like a fool, he did," Severus laughed a humorless laugh, and Voldemort too showed his crooked teeth, in what could only be guessed was a smile. "You do not have to fear, my lord. He came to me, the poison concentrated in his hand, and I made sure that he would die within the year." And Voldemort laughed, a sound like a sword skewering a boar.
"Exactly!" Harmony exclaimed. And that was exactly what she told herself that she was doing. Harmony decided not to think about it any more than she had to. There wasn't anything to think about…Damn it.
"No," she said, thinking about how she had no answers and too much prying in her life at the moment. She left them and locked the door to her room and went to her luggage bags. She had not needed to open this bag all summer. Piles of unfolded clothes and books were littered inside. She held out a man shirt and embraced one; it had been much too long. McGonagall had not so much said a word against the man cloth as much as she gave concerned looks, which were worse than words.
"Well, depends on who I am dressed up for that day, but when we are alone together you can chose."
"Uh, no I did not," she retaliated smartly. Ginny gave her a determined look.
Harmony put the remains of the locket in her pocket and ignored Draco as he continued to smirk.
Draco was done playing nice.
"Mum," Harmony hesitated, but she knew if she didn't say this now, she wouldn't get another chance. "I'm dating a Slytherin..." She trailed off, not sure how to voice her concerns. Would her mum think that she was making a bad decision?
Harmony had not anticipated revealing anything to anyone. When she choose to keep her identity a secret, to not tell even her two best mates, it was not just for their safety, or keeping things as simple and unchanged as if nothing were amiss. It was more than not wanting to hear their pity, their platitudes for a situation they would never understand and mark her even more as a freak.
"What are you talking about? I was here."
Harmony walked over to Draco and he pulled her into a close hug, the two of them not saying a word.
"So what color do you like better, silver or blue?" Ginny held out two eye shadow containers, to which Harmony groaned in distress. "You're right, what was I thinking, purple is so much better."
Draco stared at the man who laid crumpled at his father's feet. Half the man's face was unrecognizable, but Draco knew him from the posters in his third year. Sirius Black, the only man to break out of Azkaban. He could easily recall the man's haunted eyes, that hollow gaze.
"A ring?" Voldemort asked, as if petrified. "It cannot be." The veins protruded from his face and neck, like black strands of hair on dead skin. "What else?" he demanded.
"Oh no! We'll never graduate at this rate. I'll be stuck with Snape forever! Quick, get back to class!"
"Father!" Draco said as the man put a hand to touch Harmony's now passive face. The instant he made contact with the girl, magic shot through his arm. It clawed at him, crushing his arm and tearing outwards from his flesh. The man screamed and cradled the wound that continued to twist and rupture. He wheeled away from her, eyes vivid with pain.
"Nothing. He knows she's safe. Otherwise he'd be off hunting for her like Hagrid and Madame Hooch. That's why McGonagall is so calm about it too, he must have told her. Anyway, I think that Harry Potter won't be seen again, but Harmony will probably be back again next year."
"Thank you professor," Draco said. Draco looked back to where his father could have caught up with him, but there was no one watching in the shadows. Draco leaned against Snape as they walked back to the room.
"You will die a woman," screeched a horribly low and cracking voice.
"Ron, lay off it, he only wants to make himself feel better by belittling others, so just ignore what he says, that's what I try to do." Hermione patted Ron on the knee. Harmony wanted to drown them out of her head, she was already forming a headache.
"You've convinced me," Ginny smiled, "but why are you telling me this in the first place?"
"Yeah? What?" Ginny asked.
"A caracal," Kingscross supplied. Draco got up to his feet, surprised that no lingering aftereffects were present. Harmony drifted away from the meat, and the sight of that red meat triggered annoyance through Draco.
"For goodness sake," Hermione said as she pointed her wand at Ron's throat, and hotly muttered a spell. "Ron, chew before swallowing." He gave her a 'how-would-I-ever-breath-blink-or-do-anything-without-you' look, to which she responded by shaking her head in frustration.
Harmony watched as they feasted on their victory, piling their plates and chatting it up. She caught him after dinner in the halls, and passed him a note which explained that they were going to meet in the girls bathroom on the first floor that night. The one with Moaning Myrtle.
"You have already asked me six times Ginny, and the answer is the same," Harmony said, "I'm staying here." Ginny bit her bottom lip.
The beat quickened and she smiled as he shook his hips. At least when she moved her hips, it didn't matter how silly she looked. The space lessened between them, and she laughed all the while. She watched his eyes light up, as they followed her. Harmony touched his arm and he brought a hand on her waist. "You dance well," he said loudly over the music.
"What are those rings?" she asked, and Ron squatted next to her, eyeing the necklace.
"Ginny, I'm sorry, it's just that it's a bit complicated to explain."
"For the same reason that you kissed me back." She latched at his front robes, and not in the way he wished. Her small hands clasped tightly around the material and her eyes were mere inches from his own.
"All the more fun, still up for my lessons, Frisker?" Leighton asked.
"Ginny," Harmony took off her glasses and wiped them on her robes, "Dumbledore made preparations for me to be here, I'll be perfectly safe. Plus, we shouldn't talk about these things in the library."
"I'll ask him again," she said and stood to leave. "Thank you Sir."
"I'll go with you," he said. They left the party and Draco walked next to her with an arm around her back when he felt that the corridors were cooler there. The portraits eyed them as they passed, and Draco didn't allow their disapproving looks to loosen his arm. He already had enough of that.
"Shite, not my face you daft ape!" Draco brought a hand to his throbbing jaw. Okay he needed a new plan, and one that didn't involve as much pain.
But you have been doing so well in Gryffindor! All of your friends are there, and you so bravely defeated the Darkest Wizard of the modern era. And your animagus form is an African cat, it's a lovely fit.
"This way," he shouted, and they went towards Hogwarts. Their handles pointed up, and they went along the castle walls, higher and higher. They passed the castle roof and continued on. Harmony looked to the moon and she held out her hand as if that tiny orb was a snitch. It was colder here, and soon they were forced to level out. "I have never been this high up before," Draco said as his legs nearly brushed hers. She watched the visible breaths that left his lips.
"A platypus," Luna said thoughtfully.
"Screw that," Draco said as he went about to unbutton the shirt clinging to his chest. For some inkling suspicion she thought that Draco had somehow planed this from the beginning. "Well, aren't you going to turn around? This isn't a show, Potter."
"Harry," Hermione said and Harmony closed her eyes tight.
It was like ice had gripped her throat, restricting her movements, corrosive to her skin. Everything was hopeless, and death would embrace her like it wanted to do nearly 14 years ago. Her eyelids drooped and she wondered if she heard something behind the laughter in her head. She wondered if she imaged the bright light that coursed through the air. She wondered if this was death.
"I see," Snape said softly. How could he deny Draco after that? "But remember, you are playing a dangerous card." Snape motioned for Draco to sit, and Draco sat upright with his hands in his lap. "The Dark Lord has not yet been completely restored to his body. He is alive, but is missing something dear." Snape paused, hoping that Draco would not ask what.
"Well, let's just say that he isn't all too much of a gloomy thundercloud. Usually he looks like he just ate nine super sour lemon drops, but today he seems to be in a melancholy cheerfulness."
"Fine." Draco's voice lowered, "It is because I do not want to be the Dark Lord's puppet. This is my life, and I am tired of pretending, of following a mad man." Draco brought a hand to where a dark mark would be. "He is unstoppable. I cannot leave, and I cannot go against him." Harmony held his gaze, trying to see the truth in his eyes. He closed them.
"Before we go out again," Kingscross said to the students whose hands were mere inches away from the clay cup, "each of you will be given one of these." Kingscross held up raw meat. They frowned with distaste before reaching out for a slither and holding it with two fingers. "Alright! Now!" Five hands grabbed at edges of the clay cup, and Draco wondered if they were traveling to a pit vicious, ravenous crocodiles.
"Yeah," she said with a grin, "thanks."
"I don't believe you." Did he think it would be that simple? She may be trusting, but that did not make her daft. "You have a hidden agenda."
"There are students missing from school grounds," she said, "grab your pillows and blankets." Heads turned side to side as the chatting began. "Now."
"Hmm?" Blaise scratched his head.
Snape's detention was much different than Draco had expected. For one, they weren't cleaning cauldrons with their toothbrushes, and secondly, it had been much more of a learning process than his actual class. Of course it had been a lesson of occlumnecy, but it was something Draco needed. He had to block everyone from finding out more about him and Harmony. He wasn't an open book for the other students' enjoyment.
Wait of course; Draco knew the answer so well, if he could somehow learn Potty's weakness, then he could win. He would take Potter to Madame Pomfrey, spy from afar and learn of his afflictions in detail. It was positively brilliant. He had been told when he smiled, on those rare occasions, that he looked angelic. He was smiling at that moment, but the darkness contorted his face into something a bit sinister; a shame really. He stared at the whimpering Potter and wondered if he was dangerously close to playing the hero for once. But Potter would never know.
"No," Harry said, "I have an idea, do you want to see some of the secret passage ways out of Hogwarts. Then you don't have to walk in the snow."
Hamony ignored the cheers that erupted all around her as Ravenclaw scored once again. Now was usually the time that the Slytherins played dirty. Bludgers were soon aimed and heads were narrowly missed. The two seekers followed close to each other, and Harmony scanned the field for any glint of gold.
"Thank you for holding on to the locket," she said with her head down. Already her feelings were being corrupted and Harmony took a deep breath to keep her mind blank.
"And who wants birthday cake!" Mrs. Weasley exclaimed enthusiastically, distracting everyone and shooting Harmony a dirty look.
Draco felt a shiver whisper through his spine as Harmony hissed, and the sink came apart. A great hole opened in its place, and Draco took a step forward. His voice caught as Harmony tipped forward. He heard a gasp from one of the girls behind him. Draco reached for Harmony, and her cloak brushed past his fingers. He had no time to think of anything else but of plummeting through the black hole.
Harmony slumped a bag over her shoulder and left the Gryffindor room. She couldn't help but feel the emptiness of the house, and left in a rush. She checked the passageway before throwing the cloak over her shoulders. The sun had set hours ago and curfew passed along with it.
She simply did not want people to know. Her life was enough of a public affair, if she were to die in the war, then it wouldn't matter if she were either male or female. If shite made things too difficult, then she could disappear. But life never went as she planned.
"Avada-" Voldemort began to say.
A surge of green and red magic met. Harmony watched as Voldemort's sneering face fell, as neither spell would relent. Both of Harmony's hands trembled as she poured her magic into the spell. She felt the ache of her heart as it pounded blood through her, almost violently. The red was slowly overtaking the green, and she watched the disbelief cross Voldemort's eyes before the green rebounded.
"What, done already?" Mr. Malfoy jeered. The pain in her began to boil. He stopped to behold a cabinet with Sirius's mirror propped up. She could imagine Sirius watching the enchanted mirror all day, listening to her and Draco that very night. The dread began to throb against her, wanting to burst from her. Malfoy took from that cabinet a tiara, and the anguish began to escape her.
Draco had seen her just the day before her fight with the Dark Lord on a hospital bed, barely able to move. She was so vulnerable. As the end of the school year approached, Draco knew that he had to find her. He just had to come up with the right plan.
She had been wrong to think that it would have been better to not be in a relationship during the war. She needed him, she would fight to live.
"No," Harmony said. She checked her bag and took out the invisibility cloak.
"A rattle snake," Ginny decided.
"Thanks for everything," Harmony said, "who ever ends up with you will be one lucky bloke."
"Nutin', Harry," he responded, "The house elf's his usual loathsome self."
"All right then, on to harder meditations and mind discipline. You will now try out concentration techniques which includes closing off your mind. I know that every wizard or witch has at one point used magic without a wand. This was mostly on accordance with times where strong emotions or desires come to play. It will be a time for nonverbal spells." He sat on the barren floor cross-legged and Harmony plopped down a foot away from him. "Take a deep breath and empty your mind," Leighton closed his eyes and she followed him. After a minute she began to fidget, not understanding exactly what to do. The silence was unnerving. She peered through a sliver of her eyelids and saw the complete relaxation from Leighton. She noticed the tension in her shoulders, the unwillingness of her body to be still. With a deep breath she began to relax, and once her body calmed, her mind ceased its stressing. It was like ridding herself of earthly bonds.
"Don't take me for one of your worshiping fans, I happen to have a free block of time, so they assigned me prefect duties. You know, escorting lost first years, catching kids skipping, boring stuff like that." From his robes he extracted papers. "And I know for a fact that you have Divinations, I have every students' schedule and all of the classes for this semester."
"Excellent, and it has only been the third day of school. There is no need to mask your face here. Anyway, since we are still on the part of protecting, let's go over the protronous charm."
"And?" Harmony leaned in towards him. His hair was a bit unkempt, and his bangs were swept to the side. She wondered if his hair was as silky as it looked, but she stopped the hand that had twitched.
"Who is she dating?" Charlie asked, to which the twins started to laugh.
"Yes, the other houses are missing students." Harmony had her mouth open, ready to ask who, but stopped.
Cedric Digory. Harmony had tried not to think about him all summer. The one who I had lead to death. Never again. I don't want to see their eyes, or hear when they say it wasn't my fault. It was.
"I'll forget to take it off tonight, and tomorrow, people will look at my nails and say 'Hell Potter, gay much'?"
"I'll try it." Harmony pulled her shapeless Duddley shirt from over her head and covered herself with Draco's. It was still too big for her, but it didn't look as awkward as the other. "It feels nice," she said without thinking.
"What is that class?" Harmony asked pointing to one with a curtain draped over a small window on the door.
"Does Dumbledore know?" He asked her.
The mystery of what happened to our beloved hero remains unsolved. Is Harry Potter alive? Did the dragon devour him in the final moments? Is he out there, wounded and tear stricken in hopes to be found, but unable to? Despite the fact that Harry's broken glasses and burned robes were discovered next to You Know Who's corpse, many out there still have hope. There is much speculation on what could have happened. Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, remarks in tears, 'he can't be dead, he'll come back for us, like he always does.' Ron pauses, in clear and loyal friendship, as he puts a hand over his heart, 'He knows where home is'. Touching is beyond words as people celebrating the fall of the Dark Lord yearn for their hero. Harry Potter, where ever you are, our eyes will always search for you.
Mixed among the Hogwarts students, Harmony could spot members of the Order, looking solemn in their robes of black. Remus caught her eye, and Harmony reminded herself to listen as McGonagall said her parting words over Dumbledore's white marble tomb. She looked at her fingers hooked with Ginny's and she noticed that her own hands were just as soft. Everything felt surreal, almost peaceful, so when the black speck began to grow across the lake, Harmony wouldn't have believed the fire that began to rain down.
"There are the dungeons, the students may be there." Draco suggested. He didn't notice the others giving him strange looks. Harmony realized that he didn't even think it was odd to have dungeons in his house.
She trailed along the green leather chairs and looked back at Draco. "Where does everyone sleep?" she asked,
"Are you serious?" Harmony asked, looking at her choices of bathing suits. They were all bikinis. Harmony held one in disgust; it looked like someone had cut out a few little triangles, held them together by pieces of string and then decided to call it swim wear.
"It can be anyone so long as it isn't Snape!" Ron flapped his jaw up.
"Begin," Snape said, with nothing more to direct them. Ron waved his wand ferociously, and it was an easy matter to put up a shield. She waited for the magic to hit her shield, but nothing came from Ron's end. She could see how pleased Snape looked as the man lifted an eyebrow. "I said begin." Ron waved his wand once more to no avail. "If you must say the spell, than whisper it to yourself." There were a few snickers in the class while Ron did so, turning red. Harmony put up her shield once more, nonverbally. His spell was sent back, powerfully enough to break through his defenses, knocking him down and Ron fell on his bottom.
"Yeah, I have detention almost every night," Harmony laughed.
She opened her door to see Ron. "What is it?" she asked, with her annoyance clear to the both of them.
"It's Harry, dad." Dudley grunted. Uncle Vernon looked to be having an aneurysm, but Harry knew that she shouldn't hope for too much. Harry gave a hesitant smile and made sure to be out of tackling range.
A scene when they were only eleven plastered against her mind, of a younger Draco asking her to be friends, and herself as a young boy rejecting his hand. She could make out parts of his face, she knew that he was serious, but something was behind his proposal.
"Do you really expect me be honest?" He narrowed his gray eyes. "When this could ruin me."
"What?" She felt like a cornered animal, poked at with a wand.
"So why can't she come to Hogwarts?"
"Harmony has stopped eating, she's moved out of the boy's dormitory, probably not even sleeping, and lastly, she's shut herself from everybody. What did you say to her?"
"Oh my God! Oh Merlin!" Ron sputtered, "She's having a heart attack!"
"You thank me a lot," Draco said aloud, as if he hadn't thought of it entirely, "I think you give me too much credit."
"You mean like on my knees? God, I just got one of those house elves to wash my pants." He chuckled. Harmony's eyebrows twitched.
"The blood that Voldemort took from you had been infused with that magic and he took parts of it with him, along with the shield that your mother gave to protect you.
"Prove it." Ginny teased.
"You've seen a dragon close up before?"
When Hagrid brought the tree into the castle, the students beamed in delight. Already the school had glowing lights and streamers all about, and students chattered amongst themselves on their plans with their family. Snow piled high against the walls and students had massive snowball fights. Harmony sat with Luna and Ginny at a red oak table in the library. There were books piled high and Harmony was rubbing her strained eyes.
She pictured her friends, of Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, she could feel their love and support, but she knew that those walls would be flimsy. If an enemy saw that her focus was only set in friendship, then they could torture them to get to her. She needed something else. Harmony imagined Sirius, and happiness filled her, but sadness too from his plight. There were her parents, the ones she only heard of. She concentrated on the unconditional love of her mother, and the happy family the three of them would have been. But she could never actually experience this happy family; only the idea. She began to think harder, to reach for something that could ground her. But she couldn't find it.
"I take it that you havn't looked at the prophet today," she said and passed one over. Harmony didn't have to flip anything in order to see the words 'Massive Breakout at the Ministry' and mug shots of known death eaters. The worst had to be a crazed Beatriz Lestrange, and Harmony looked up and noticed that Neville hadn't been present since she got there.
"I'm actually a girl." Ginny looked at her as if Potter had grown two heads and a mustache.
"Don't call the Dark Lord that!" Draco jerked a bit from the name. "He wouldn't kill a loyal pure blood— no, he will rid the world of those who go against him and his ideals…There's still a chance for you too, if you want to be on the winning side." She looked up at him with disgust. "You will die a fool, if you actually expect to win and defeat the Dark Lord, Potter."
"WHAT! Juggling between three guys, no, I'm not seeing anyone."
"Really? Are you sure that I should have it?" she asked.
"What?" Leighton looked at her curiously.
Harry shrugged her shoulders, not caring. Any bigger and Dudders would be a beached whale. "Wow Dud, I guess there is still hope for us all."
"It's k" Harmony whispered, and the young man tending her lifted both of his hands in a peaceful gesture and backed away. Sirius cautiously nosed the girl and his eyes were unreadable hollow pits.
"I have been, and don't change the subject. So you found out that Potter liked this girl, tried your own hand at getting her- to hurt Potter no doubt- but fell in love instead. How precious! If anything, it makes for a good story". Draco shrugged his shoulders. "I like it, it's almost believable." Draco laughed at Blaise.
"That doesn't make sense!" Luna shrugged her shoulders, "I still think that you should unleash the mold idea. It would spread quickly, take time to notice, and would match the decor perfectly!"
"Really, you can't be seen by anyone," Harmony said, "and when you hear the door of this room open, make sure before you show yourself that it's me." Sirius looked down at the girl and nodded.
"Thanks," Draco pulled his bag over his shoulder, "but I don't need any luck." Harmony walked off and didn't notice that Ron had watched her from ahead of her.
He found his wand plop like a lightning bug in the dust. He gripped it with shaking fingers as he brightened the area with light. "Harmony?" She was on the floor and Draco turned her over to see a mist clouding her. Her fist with the locket wouldn't loosen, and Draco felt fear grip him. Luna slipped through the vines and sat next to Harmony.
"Even Professor Snape?" Harry asked.
"No," Harmony forced a laugh, "but I may as well."
"Don't give me that. Girls are just as capable as boys...try putting your weight into it," Leighton said. Pansy turned away as if insulted. A sickening crack speared through the room and heads turned to the small figure they saw as Harry Potter standing over the remains of his desk. Ron stood next to her with his mouth ajar
Harmony strode through the halls making her way to the Defense Against the Dark Arts room. It was the first day of lessons and she had spent the early morning attempting to transfigure her face. She brushed a hand against her chin and felt the pasty face cream making her Harry Potter. It was almost too easy to fool people, to fool her Gryffindor mates. It was like all they saw was what they wanted to see, to see the great Harry Potter, their savior; but there is always something beneath the surface.
Draco made his way to a far corner and sat down glaring at the wall. After the first minute which he was cursing profusely under his breath, Draco attempted to find his happiest thought and found out that he was failing miserably to do so. He half heatedly pictured winning the quidditch tournament, but realized that he never had done so. Next he tried the joy of catching the snitch and frowned once again. He needed something bigger. His family would have been the ideal choice, except that his recent dispute with his father did not help. He knew he was just stalling about thinking about Harmony, because his happiest memory had been kissing her. But when Draco did think of that, the dream came back to haunt him. The harder he he focused on the memory, the worse the image of Leighton and Harmony played before him. Draco growled in frustration when he could no longer bear it. He felt hurt, as if Leighton had defeated him in his own mind.
"It would actually relieve me, if you went after guys instead of girls," A sly smile spread across his features. "Though, if you are referring that you fancy me, then I have nothing to worry about." Harmony could only gape at him, she could feel heat crawling up her neck, to her face and ears. Only he would come up with that.
"So which should I call you, Harry or Harmony?"
"Tell me when you figure it out," Draco said, "if there is in fact something even up." Blaise laughed at Draco.
"Whatever," Ron spat.
So far none of the girls could reach the top, and Harmony could feel her arms starting to feel weak. She began to stretch them and loosen up her shoulders. When it was her turn, she stood at the far end with Ginny in the middle and Luna at the other end. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Harmony gripped the first crevice and lifted up her leg. There were small bumps and holes and Harmony attempted to blank out her mind and just think about lifting herself up. She felt like she was crawling ever so slowly and her arms burned within minutes. This was much harder than quidditch, and Harmony hugged the side of the cliff, resting for a few moments. She heard a gasp from her her right and looked down to see Ginny nearing the ground. Luna was just at her feet and smiled up at her.
"Ginny, have you ever thought of putting earrings through this?" Luna asked.
He smirked when something came to him that even Salazar would have approved of. That night Draco slept with the locket shoved and locked in a suitcase that only opened to his voice with the password that he only knew. He wasn't going to risk another sleepless night with the possibility of Leighton and Harmony getting it on. Like Hell he would be foolish enough to torture himself so.
"I will see about that." Voldemort began to pace the room in long deliberate steps. "And the Ministry?"
"What?" Voldemort searched Severus's face, for a lie. His anger was ready to burst with uncontrollable magic.
"I can see him over there glaring at all of us, I doubt that he can do half of what you can, if not anything." The song ended and Draco brought her closer to the heat of the dance floor. The music started up slowly at first, but picked up, and the students cheered. Harmony moved with the music and brought her arms up, suddenly she was glad that no one knew who she was. She felt free to step close to Draco and smile like an idiot. She could be unknown, but also be his girlfriend, and this lie was so much easier to believe than the truth.
There was nothing nicer than sipping a well made cup of Earl Grey tea, with a beautiful girl at your side. Draco relaxed, wrapping an arm around Harmony. He had her full attention now, and he wondered how Ginny would react to being left with no one to talk to but a Slytherin like Blaise.
"I'm going alone," Luna said, "which is fine for me."
They had been attracting a lot of attention, or at least she had. It was a surprise what black robes could hide. The dress hugged her slim frame and the candle light reflected off the silver material so that his eyes trailed around her figure. If beauty could ever be summed up in one word, it would be harmony. He laughed at how overly sentimental he was being.
He regarded her with a cool air, "I'm on prefects duty," he said and his eyes fell on Harmony. Which indirectly told them his reasons for crouching behind a door, and blatantly eavesdropping.
Draco titled his head before taking her hand. "This way." Harmony followed Draco. "This side is where the boys sleep, and each year is split up in levels. We can either sleep in the room where everyone sleeps, or buy our own. Most of us have our own rooms". The walls were mostly bare, except for the skulls and bones. The air was thicker than in the Gryffidor room, and was perfect for mold to sprout.
"Blimey, Ron," George whistled, "people have free will. You should know by know that Ginny won't listen to you."
"Of course not," Ginny smacked her forehead and whispered fiercely, "What were you thinking? Girls don't change in front of boys."
"As much as I enjoy," Snape said giving Dumbledore a slight glance "…helping you Potter. Since I am the one administering the potion I must also make sure everything goes smoothly." Harry continued to stab daggers at him in his mind.
The heat of the night billowed through the open window, and Harry sprawled atop his four poster bed. He had that dream again, of when he was squeezed and tied, with Cedric dead at his feet. His body was tired, blanched with cold, as if he were there again. He assumed that was why the pain began.
"I got enough money, I guess."
Harmony didn't have to wait long for Ginny to run down the stairs taking two at a time. In a matter of minutes, they were at the kitchens, waiting for the others. When Draco and Luna showed up, Harmony threw the invisibility cloak over them, and they went to the kitchens to scratch the pear.
"Let's keep in touch." Harmony added before walking off to finish her letter (which Charlie didn't know was to a dragon of a different sort.)
Harmony's eyes burned from lying awake all night, and she was not amused with the feet that paced at her door. She had the mind to throw her shoe and yell that she was trying to sleep. When the second pair of feet lingered by she cursed under her breath. It didn't matter that they were Ron and Hermione. They were whispering, not so quietly, in front of her door.
"The same goes to you, and you better be the one to tell your friends properly." Draco simply stated, turning his head away from the girl.
Severus looked at the man unmoved, he could not show fear. "I had to wait for an opportunity, my Lord. When I had no class, and a time when Dumbledore would not suspect where I was leaving to. It is nearly impossible to lie to the man." Voldemort was not completely rid of his rage. He licked his chapped mouth, over taught white skin.
Harmony could not tell if he was breathing. She was choking as well, on a lump that constricted her throat. No.
"They should just stop following the mad man," Draco said without thinking and Snape slammed a hand onto his desk.
"Very good then, I would still like to know what had happened from the two of you though." Harmony agreed and gave an abridged version of the story with Leighton taking over when he came in. All the while Dumbledore nodded his head without interruption.
"Yeah, and that will be me," Fred said.
"waz up?" he slurred and his eyes widened. His voice sounded softer. He looked fearful at his smaller hands and then back at the two older men in front of her. He vaguely once wondered if Dumbledore was into young boys, but now he felt glad that he was a girl, though Snape was an entirely new concern. He felt a bit exposed to their eyes with the hospital gown that barely concealed his new form. He must have looked comical to them, like some hideous new female specimen. "Er. May I use the loo?"
"Do you even KNOW what you're talking about? Are you going to let him CONTROL you like this?" Ron and Hermione just stared. "You don't even know what he's DONE TO ME!"
"Fine," Draco smirked, "i'll try."
"Er, thanks?" she said.
"So when I receive an unnamed letter, I am supposed to assume that it's from you."
"Potter!"
Dumbledore nodded and called for Poppy for help. Harry wished that Snape would stop gawking at his new body and knew that some snide remark would fall from his gaping lips. He pushed the sheets away and slung his slender legs over the mattress to test if his feet could support his weight. Madam Pomfrey bustled to him and gave her support. A little loo was stationed at the back and Harry made his way alone to one of the stalls. He would never imagine that relieving himself would be such a challenge. At first he wondered how girls could piss while standing, but he freaked when he realized something else. All he could repeat in remorse was 'where had it gone'!
He was so immersed in his own mind that when he felt a tug at his robes, he was caught off guard. He couldn't believe that he was staring at Harmony. He would have attempted a smile if the other students weren't lingering around them. "What is it Potter?" he said in a tone harsher than he meant. She looked better than before. She had obviously slept and did not look so down.
"Blimey Harry, just how did you do that, these hammers weigh a ton?" Ron asked, realizing he probably didn't look too manly with his maw all hanging open.
"Alright," Ginny laughed, "just pulling your leg."
"Well Ron, I plan to grow three inches by the end of this month, and four by the next. I am a growing boy, you know."
"Nothing," Blaise laughed, "it's just amusing."
"Wait," he yelped, "I can barely walk it hurts." Well it didn't hurt that bad, he just couldn't allow the other students to see him like that; all weak and with purple spots. And he still needed to find out about Potter. He continued to whine a bit more till she grabbed about ten pain killer potions and then forced him out. Draco groaned till she shut the door on his face. That was not what he expected from her. The door locked and a sign of 'temporarily out' printed along the glass plane.
Harmony knew how. Third year was the time that he had been a complete arse to her about the dementors. It was not a cherished memory as it had been before, and Draco hoped that she wasn't thinking about it now. Granger had her hand up and Leighton called her name.
"We tried to save mum." Draco argued, when he couldn't keep his silence any longer.
"You did that on purpose. I don't know how, but you are out to get me." Draco said to her when they were far enough away from the class room.
Her magic engulfed the spell, and she began to shake. You bastard, her mind screamed, I'm going to fucking kill you! The spell was only wearing off, and Harmony's hand shook as if there were weights holding her down. She pointed her wand at Malfoy senior.
"I don't know, it was all blurry." She lied.
"Sorry," she said, "he just lost a lot of money on a bet on who would win. Harry and Ginny, you can be friends with anyone."
"You have all lost something this break, and I hope that it does not become irrevocable. Pain comes in many forms, but no matter how small or large pain seems, it is only a moments agony. Pain will pass, if you let it go. Now, where does the solution reside in most venoms?"
Harmony took a deep breath allowing the cooling air to end the lumos litany revolving around her head. Maybe she was thinking too hard. She said the spell in her mind as she would have done aloud with the corresponding wave motion of her hand. There was an unmistakable flicker of a modicum white misty light, which disappeared in a blink. She sat there with a surprised smile.
"You don't have a very strong accent," Harmony interjected.
Hermione glared at her suspiciously. "Why do you want to know?"
The stone floor was cold, but soon a warmth seeped through, and touched the stiff hands and feet. The candles began to extinguish, one by one, till a hazy glow lifted the ceiling. Harmony rested her head on her pillow, unable to sleep, and tired of thinking. She sat up when a faint light glowed by her face, and a hand beckoned her close. Harmony tread softly, missing the heads around her. She followed the tall woman out of the great Hall. "What has happened?" Harmony asked.
Draco looked back unconvinced, "Snape doesn't have an animagus form, you're probably making this up."
She paused when she saw Charlie's eyes turn to her, and flick up and down her body. Before she could feel uncomfortable, Charlie smiled and mentioned, "I see that you like dragons."
"Merlin! What happened to the sweet Ginny?"
"Harry, I hope you are feeling better, you were in there an awfully long time, and no visitors were allowed." Hermione said as if to ask why the Hospital Wing was blocked.
She brushed his downy covers and saw that her ring now took on a light red hue. She looked at him to make out his features. His room really was too dark and she squinted to see better. He sat down next to her, and Harmony wondered if it had been wrong to be sitting on his bed. She supposed that it didn't matter now that she had already done it. "You know that they'll probably know that it's you," he said.
Draco would have to definitely go for blackmail, somehow get Potter's attention and then make him do humiliating things. He would then beat him fairly, or as fair as possible. Yes then after his fun, when the boy-who-would-soon-be-a-girl would be all emotionally disturbed and vulnerable, he would trick her into the Dark Lords hands. Draco smiled; his life was absolutely perfect, excluding of course the untimely plague. Maybe he wouldn't send Theodore to his grave, at least not permanently.
"Sorry, Sir," Harmony said. She kicked Draco's shoe when he didn't say anything. "Don't argue with him," she whispered from the side of her mouth, "I'll tell you later." Draco shut his mouth and returned to the cauldron. They completed the rest of the assignment, when they finished the potion and handed in a flask of the sorcerer's revenge. Snape took one look at it and nodded his head.
"I'll walk you half way," he said, "to the Great Hall."
"With," and Draco laughed.
"A declaration of war," Severus muttered, "or a scheme for immortality."
There were a lot of ridiculous theories floating around when it was discovered that the boy wonder was missing. Not at first of course. It seemed like everyone but him was too busy celebrating to realize that Harry was even gone. But then he was gone for a week, and then two. It was discovered that Potter's things remained in his room. Even his owl was still in the owlery. Letters to those close to the boy couldn't find anything. It was then that the theories began. Perhaps Lady Voldemort was just a decoy and Potter was off vanquishing the real one. Or maybe Harry had gone off riding on the Dark Lord's dragon and had gotten lost. Or eaten. Someone at the ministry had even commissioned a team to track down that beast to find any clues to the boy's disappearance.
"Why are you here, Mister Malfoy?" he asked him directly, wanting to hear him speak.
Severus looked at Dumbledore in confusion, remembering the night he had come with the poisoned hand and cursed ring. Marvolo Grant's ring, and the stone centered on the ring was cracked. "Of course," Severus muttered, how could he forget.
"No. You're not. What's wrong Hermione?"
"I have already put my family and myself at risk, Professor. There's not much more that I can lose."
"Wow Luna, you are wicked," Ginny laughed.
"Then let's go out into the woods and find wounded animals," Harmony leaned forward on the balcony and looked down below at the fields.
"I work at the book store, it's only me there tonight and you all are welcome to stay," Leighton said. Snape turned to him and regarded him with faint disdain.
"Did you hear that Harry?" Ron jolted out, "Hogsmeade has come early this year!"
"Okay. How do you do it?"
"Oh, I see," Harmony said and crushed the beginnings of disappointment.
"You can't," the man gloated, "or 'ur head'll be cut off."
"If anyone is a rodent it's you and your family, you produce like them, and live in a burrow, what more can I say?" Weasel was turning a bright red much like his hair and grabbed Granger to rampage out. He was too easy, but hardly any fun. "Oh and Longbottom, someone reported a missing toad, you might want to find it before someone steps on it." Longbottom looked horrified and left the two while calling for his toad. Draco attempted a smile, but saw Potters reluctance to converse.
"He doesn't gain anything by telling, plus he told me that he already knows, so if it does go out, he'd know that I would go after him first."
Two loud cracks announced the apparation of Fred and George, who attempted to merely materialize in the center of the room, and who instead landed on Ron and Harmony's laps.
"Sorry, I just assumed." He scrutinized the girl in front of him, and gave a little snort.
"But what is it?" Harmony asked and looked at the locket. "It was Tom Riddle's diary, when Voldemort went to this school. It's not the same as the locket." Draco looked at Leighton and saw the man's grave face. Leighton knew what it was.
"Well tell me," Harmony laughed. Last night was the Masquerade party. No wonder she had barely seen them.
"I don't know, all it says is that the Dark Lord was seen by aurors and early morning Ministry staff to have broken into a restricted section of the Ministry of Magic. It doesn't say if anything was taken, but the Dark Lord wouldn't just make an appearance like that for no reason. Something doesn't add up!" Hermione shot her hand up for emphasis, but Harmony was more concentrated on the students who were beginning to get anxious.
"Yeah, I have watched how you do potions, and if you think you can bring that to this table we might as well just not do anything and Spare Professor Snape the trouble." Many of the groups at other tables glanced back at the two, feeling slightly better about themselves that they hadn't been so poorly matched.
"Sure that will work," Harmony replied, "except for the fact that the man hates me." Ginny scrunched closer, squishing Neville who was between them. She pulled at Harmony's collar, forcing them inches apart behind Neville's back.
"I don't know," Ron said, "you seem so different." Hermione joined them at the table and caught the last words.
She celebrated the rest of the day indoors with Sirius talking about nothing and everything. She enjoyed his company and made him tell her some stories of the milder marauders misadventures. She especially enjoyed the one when her father and him had set a bunch of Munching Moths in the Slytherin Dungeons. These moths only ate hair follicles, which happened to cure Snivellus's grease problem.
"I have extra classes with Professor Kingscross-"
"Ah," Voldemort exhaled, his wet fingers caressing a newly formed nose. Voldemort stroked the blond hair that now streamed across his head.
"Er. She's a muggle. The kind of muggle who wears expensive clothing to convince other muggles to buy the same clothes. It's quite complicated I know. I met her on the way to a candy shop, where I saved her from a car that suddenly veered onto the sidewalk, nearly trampling her." Harmony smiled and decided not to think about why a car would suddenly lose control at such a convenient time.
"Something must have happened to Theodore," Draco said, "he's not himself."
"How bout a another kiss?" She saw the glint in his eyes as they stepped away from the music.
Ron's ears turned bright red, and he scowled maliciously. He opened his mouth to speak.
To Cub,
Draco reread the letter once more before crumpling it in to a fist and bursting it to flames. "My mother, will she be ok?" Draco asked.
"You're not coming in with me," she asked, "too scared of a bunch of girls now." He gave her a lopsided smirk.
The lesson went smooth enough after that, except when leighton pulled out his jar of dragon venom and started drinking from it. They half expected him to drop dead, but when he titled the rest down, Draco's hopes dashed away. The man was very much alive. When nothing still happened, Leighton noticed their pointed stares.
Pansy strode to the front of the class with a smirk. Harmony could see the wand point sticking from the girl's sleeve. Pansy said, "Furnunculus," and a jet of gray shot towards her. Harmony slashed the air with her hand and the curse circled back, slapping Pansy in the face. The girl put a hand to her cheek in shock as boils began to erupt over her features and down her neck.
"Thanks, but I'm not a child," her hand slipped from his, "I can manage my way without getting lost." She regretted the loss of warmth almost immediately.
"I like a challenge," Draco said, "and the name is Malfoy, not Frisk-er."
"Yea! And they are always charting maps and sometimes mum forgets to put them away before dinner and we saw one of cliffs near some pond or something, and it must have been pretty important judging by how hard mum smacked me away."
He simply said, his voice deprived of emotions as he passed again near him to reach the woods and resume the path to the castle.
Harry looked at him with anger and Malfoy stepped back a bit. No longer seeing the need to stay so close as he was done observing everything he needed to.
He said sighing. Defeatist, he had already prepared himself to lose Hermione as collateral damage. He wouldn't have the audacity to claim her and ask her to chose his side, he had no rights to it. And he knew he couldn't ask her to split in two either. It would be hard for her to maintain both relations separately with the two boys unable to stand one another. Impossible even to stay neutral when she had her best friend on one side and her boyfriend on the other. If he had to, then he was ready to let her go. For her own good.
He thought. Why was he here all of the sudden ?
Slowing his pace once more, he entered the courtyard. His heart leading him, making him want to face the memorial. He knew, it's going to hurt. But he needed to feel that pain, to face it so he could process it. And he deserved it anyway... They all died because of him, he was not allowed to run away from them. He had to endure. But as the stone appeared in his vision, so did a boy. And he was not even surprised anymore to recognize the man with platinum blond hair. Facing the memorial already. He sighed as he approached.
Malfoy blurt out.
She started, but Harry was not ready to hear. He knew her, so he knew she was about to say nice things, things he didn't deserve. He didn't even deserve the smile she was giving him. He only deserved anger and blame. So he cut her short.
And Malfoy nodded, drawing his wand to point it towards Harry without hesitation. His grin grew wider, evil.
He answered with mystery. Turning towards Harry, who clearly didn't understand what he meant. He just silently waited for him to be more clear, firm green eyes locked in his. So, Malfoy took a breath before explaining. Not looking confident anymore but rather miserable.
Malfoy playfully answered with self derision, his grin now soft. At least, he was aware of the absurdity of the situation and how improbable it was that were actually getting along and Harry found himself smiling back at that confession. Thinking of how strange life can sometimes be. Maybe without all this darkness, they could have been friends when they were kid. But it seemed, in this fucked up world, they both needed to be destroy to finally be able to connect. What a pity.
He muttered with an exaggerated disappointed look before smiling and heading towards the stairs, Harry following him. The Gryffindor had a wide grin painted on his lips, he was almost rediscovering the use of his face's muscles. They were a bit rusty, and the feeling was strange in his cheeks. But he was enjoying the small uplifting feeling with which he left the tower. For once, he truly felt a moment of peace, his mind perfectly distracted from the grim thoughts, the constant mourning.
She whined, rendered hopeless. Her brown eyes staring into the green ones with a begging gaze. Harry avoided it, shaking his head, he looked away.
"Alright then, I'm assuming that the owl that dropped a letter into my porridge today morning also has something to do with this whole wizard business?"
It had only been a few hours since the death of the Malfoys and the disappearance of the Dark Lord, and the wizarding world was already dissolving into chaos. Partygoers lined the streets, drunkenly setting off fireworks and cheering loudly. Even the students of Hogwarts were joining in, crying and hugging each other in the hallways.
"You speak?" The snake said, its, using Draco's distraction as an opportunity to curl around his legs and climb up, until the snake's head peered at him over his knees.
"What?" Draco blinked. Then, as the scene in front of him finally registered, he launched himself backwards with a yelp, trying to put as much distance between him and the orb. The orb followed him. It flitted around, drawing closer to Draco as he scrambled away, stopping only when he felt his back press against the wooden planks of the roof. The orb floated closer until it was barely a few inches in front of his face.
"I'm assuming you understand?"
he thought.
as Matron Anna padlocked it shut, leaving Draco in complete and utter darkness, terrified. His breaths started to come out in short, quick pants, and there was a tingling on his back that felt like a million spiders running up and down his spine. Tears trickle down his face and he clenched his eyes shut, hugging his knees to his chest. He doesn't bother trying to scream and fight to be let out, he knew from experience that it would be useless and a waste of energy.
An owl delivering a letter? He shrugged. It wasn't the strangest thing he'd seen.
"Alright then. Oh
"Black," he said curtly, nodding to the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good luck, Draco," he murmured before he turned and disappeared.
The nightmarish reign of Voldemort had ended, and a new golden era had been ushered in. Across the country, wizards and witches celebrated, raising their glasses to the sky in a silent salute.
"Um, excuse me?" Draco said, blinking. Being polite never hurt anyone. "I suppose I do speak." Now that he was feeling less panicked, he realised that the snake was tiny. It? He? She? They seemed like a female, though Draco didn't know how he knew that.
and his stomach had started growling. He had chosen not to question the existence of the orb-
A low, sibilant hiss rang through the room and the snake that had previously been sleeping inside the grandfather clock slowly uncoiled and rose so that it was eye level with Draco. And then, somehow, impossibly, the hiss translated into perfectly understandable English.
"What was that?"
Severus nodded, his face souring more than it already was, and waited until she left the room. Once the door had clicked shut behind her, he slid his wand out of where it had been hidden in his sleeve, casting a quick locking spell and a
"You," she said, panting. "This is all your fault."
“Wow,” he murmured, watching it change shape into a slightly different blob.  It glowed bright enough to illuminate quite a bit, just enough so that he could see the floor underneath him. He let his arms fall to the side and the orb hovered in front of him, pulsing with a gentle blue light.
The snake hissed again, coiling up tighter and poking her nose into the neck of Draco's hoodie.
Severus frowned. Muggleborns, or in Draco's case, magical children who grew up with muggles, weren't supposed to receive a Hogwarts letter via owl. It must've been one of the rare, but not impossible, errors in the Hogwarts mailing system, and he resolved to have it checked once he returned.
With a creak, the trapdoor opened and light poured into the room, illuminating what had previously been in almost complete darkness. Matron Anna's head poked out from the doorway, a scowl visible on her face.
Taking a deep breath, Severus composed himself and turned back to Draco Malfoy, lifting his gaze to stare at Dumbledore.
"Alright," Draco said. The orb peeked out from his hood where it had been hiding the whole time, and once seeing the danger was over, happily flew back out.
that always seemed to happen around him, the times when he would close his eyes and when he opened them again, he would be standing in a completely different place. Or like the time Lewis and his friends had stolen all his clothes and he had been forced to walk around in his pyjamas, he had wished so hard that they would stop laughing and their mouths had immediately closed as if they had been zipped up.
"Yeah, George."
Students were milling about, working their way to the start of dinner. Harmony leaned by the grand doors, allowing countless students to pass her.
They didn't have to go far. Just a mile and a half away, she tucked the portkey in an abandoned nest-barely any flight time at all. She transfigured back into a girl up on the branches, and waited for Harmony, watching the feline climb its way up to meet her.
"I'd better go now; I still can probably find a few students in the halls who need a nice clean berating." Draco felt an internal shudder. If mind raping was possible, Snape definitely mastered that art. How was he supposed to know if someone was probing his mind, that is just sick. Draco carefully controlled his breathing and made his mind blank. He was relieved when he heard the door close and Snape had disappeared into the darkness. Dumbledore though still lingered and he made his way back to Potter.
"Where is Luna?" Harmony asked, Draco then noticed that the barmy girl was nowhere.
"It just doesn't make sense." She huffed under her breath.
"Perfect," Ginny admired her, "now no guy can resist you." Harmony laughed and looked at Ginny.
"I don't care what I said, never do that," Draco took a few moments to regain his footing, oh his poor beautiful face. "You guys know any good hexes that look really bad and don't hurt, but take a couple of days to heal?" They started at him blankly and he signed.
Maybe that's why she started to hang out more with Draco, since most of them didn't want to go against him. No, that wasn't the only reason. She was more calm and had more fun with him. It didn't matter how cold it was, they flew on their brooms at night when the sky was white and the snow fluttered around them. Sometimes they would practice legillimens without warning, and Harmony put up her barriers as patch worked and flimsy as they were. He made her smile even after a hex left her limping and bruised. During class was the best time to escape.
Harmony waited till the common room became quiet before stepping out. She sat on the couch, waiting for Ginny, till it was almost midnight, and Harmony felt the locket hang like a hand pulling down at her neck. A door creaked open and Harmony turned her head to watch as Ginny descended the stairs. They nodded to each other when they were close enough, and went to the portrait.
Draco took her hand, and whispered into her ear, "you sure this is what you want?"
"Like its throbbing and somebody just stuck a spoon in my head and swirled everything around."
"Sounds great," Blaise looked amused as he picked up his bag. Harmony held Draco's hand as they walked in between Harry and Blaise. The dark skinned teen had a bemused expression, as he examined them. "So where are you going to learn magic?" he asked.
She didn't respond to him, and Draco was at a loss. Did she still wish to be alone? Or worse, would she never want to see him again? He would never be able to take that kind of parting.
"Someone hexed him. Bad." Crabbe surprisingly answered him. Well that was not elaborate at all. Harry got a better view of Mafoy's face and snorted at the growing purple spots.
"So what's the plan?" Luna asked.
Finally Ron could take it no more, "What are you doing here?" Faces around the table looked shocked and uncomfortable at the outburst, Hermione in particular looked mortified. And Ron was just too far away to comfortably kick under the table.
"What are you talking about?" She wished that she had Snape's ability to read people. "Then how can we be so called friends, without trust?"
"Now's not a good time."
"You fly well," Harmony said and shrugged before leaving. She didn't want him to know how much she had admired him.
"I know that you are looking at that bracelet there, and I think that she will love it." Ron stared at the gold coins that were being offered to him, and he shook his head.
Ron gave Harmony a big smile before shouting Hermione's name, and waving at the girl. Harmony turned away, wanting to do something relaxing. She ignored the clustering students on the side of the roads, marveling at the brightly lit window displays. She almost tripped over a dog that somehow materialized at her feet. The black blur reared on its hind paws before reaching at her as if it wanted a hug. She grinned widely, smothering her arms around the dog's head. The dog barked happily, wagging its tail and sniffing her uncontrollably. He nearly slobbered all over her face, and Harmony had to clasp the dog's muzzle between her hands.
"We'll meet up with you later in the day." Draco offered.
"Who else is to know?"
"Well, Mary Poppins is a famous witch who breached wizardry laws and performed magic within the sight of muggles to teach children to behave or some nonsense like that. Well, she had invented the flying umbrella, and it has been banned since." Even though McGonagall was pulling the lecture mode, Harmony felt amused. "Everyone knows the story of how she was struck by lightning, but the muggles seem to have over looked that fact."
"You can practice on me," Draco grinned, "I have nothing to hide."
He walked by their compartment and immediately saw Potter and walked on. He didn't know exactly what to do to get him alone. He walked passed it again and saw Granger, Red head, and Longbottom also inside. The rest of the Weasleys were in a compartment closer to his own. Draco figured he would do it the old fashioned way, and just jump right in.
"Did he put on the ring?" Voldemort's eyes bulged.
"A moment Malfoy," Severus said, stopping them both. Harmony left the room, but stood close to the door trying to hear.
His eyes fell on Draco Malfoy and the same figure kissing. Malfoy had his hands going through the black messy hair, and still Remus couldn't see the other's face. "Harry?" he asked, shocked.
"I always love to," he said with a smirk, "lead that is."
Draco did not answer at first, but balled his fists. "Never mind. I'm not some stupid Gryffindor. I can see that you are mocking me." Draco turned to leave, but stopped when he felt something at his wrist. Snape had his own arm out, the dark mark marring white skin.
Harmony's eyes narrowed in annoyance. "We were talking about how wonderful my boyfriend is, and Hermione burst into tears. She just can't believe how lucky I am."
"Uh, just walking around the halls when I felt dizzy."
"Wait," Draco said as he caught up to her, agitation clear in his voice "Can we just start over?"
"You know very well what is wrong," Harmony said, forcing her eyes not on his chest and at his face. "I can't change with you here." Draco's face lifted as he thought of the implication to what she just said.
"I'm alright, just tired," Harmony said, rubbing her eyes from under her glasses. Ginny took her hand before she could protest.
It was Professor Snape who ended up arriving for them in Harmony's room, and the man stood rigid as the medi-witch bustled around the propped up girl. It didn't help that Draco kept glaring at Snape, and the distrust was as plain as Snape's nose was hooked. He kept his silence until the medi-witch left the room, with her self-writing clipboard floating on after her.
Blaise led them through a house that could have easily fit the Burrow eight times over. He stopped in front of glass sliding doors that seemed strangely misted over, pulling them open to reveal an indoor pool.
"I'M A BLOODY WHAT?" Harry screeched. More incoherent words were shouted with frustration.
"I'm glad that I got to go and get out of this blasted house. But I would be careful if I were you. Be wary of who you talk to, you may trust somebody with your life, but who really knows the person within?"
"I'll return when you are rested Harmony, and place that spell to conceal your face. Take care." Dumbledore left and she shut her eyes.
"Why are you letting him do this to you?" Ron waved a rat's tail at Draco in exasperation.
"You mean Hide-and-Seak?" Harmony said.
"Would you mind explaining Draco Malfoy's finer points?" Hermione asked.
"So why are you working out?" Harmony asked as she ground the rat's tail.
"Severus Snape, potions master of Hogwarts. A fellow staff member has brought along a friend's daughter to Diagon Alley. I found her here, injured, while the incompetent Ministry of Magic asks questions since they failed to control their dementors, while she should be properly treated." He ended in a growl of annoyance. Harmony noticed Sirius slink away to retrieve her wand.
"I'll see you there!"
"Ron, look at you, you ate half the table yourself," Hermione interjected. Harmony just then caught the identical half smiles of Fred and George, who sat diagonal from them. Seconds later a first year shot up as his drink exploded into rainbow dust and butterflies. Harmony joined in on their smiles.
"Harry Potter!" Voldemort amplified her voice and a chorus of Death Eaters jeered, "See what I have become? Come out and play with me or Hogwarts will burn." A jet of fire snaked around the Gryffindor tower, and Harmony watched as windows shattered.
"Strange," Remus said, "Sirius never had a daughter."
"Thank you," Draco said, before pushing himself further to make it to Harmony. When they reached the room, Harmony was still bent over Sirius's body. He had not known that pain could rebound to him if he were to ever hurt another person. Or that seeing another's suffering could bring him to his knees. The sight of Harmony with blood and tears mingled together mourning somebody she had loved, was worst than any physical pain he had experienced. It was a twisting ache, that magic would not heal. "Harmony," Draco said. "I am here."
"Perfect. I'll write back that we'll be there." Ginny replied, grabbing a quill, enjoying the bemused look on Harmony's face. "You'll see." Ginny promised, answering Harmony's unspoken question.
"Come on guys," Luna hopped on the steps. They walked to Leighton's room and he greeted them, on the floor at his feet, were a few woodland creatures with different wounds. There was a limping fox in a cage, a bird with a trailing wing, a squirrel with burn marks, and a boar with a huge gash by its face.
"But Snape would kill me," Harmony said, "he'd know it was me. He would. Even if it wasn't. me."
Harmony became more aware to her surroundings. She felt Malfoy's reluctance to let her go in the way that his arms tightened around her. Heads were craning to get a better view. She began to turn a ruddy hue, as color swept back across her checks. At last her breathing stabilized. Spilled octopus ink seeped into her pants leg, and the smell of putrid embalmed chickens hit her nose. Draco propped her in a sitting position, where she put her palm to her scar to ease the throbbing ajena. "I-Er," she tested her vocals, her voice came out scratchy and raw. "I was clumsy professor, and knocked into a shelf I didn't see."
"They also have an art studio, but many witches and wizards don't care for such things, with a wand, they could just as easily make anything." She felt it a shame that she hadn't considered anything but Divinations. She wondered why she took that class anyway, probably because of Ron pulling her with him, saying that he needed his afternoon naps.
Dudley continued to gape at Harry and eyeballed the scar on her forehead. As much as Harry wanted to make Dudley suffer, she felt it right to save him, and save herself from a very likely beating.
"If that is all, then see me after class. Oh, and fifteen points from Gryffindor, for an unsightly display." Snape pivoted on his foot to make a curt exit. The door swung shut.
"And you?" another house elf asked, till they all had a butterbeer in their hands. They soon left and felt warm from the butterbeers.
Harmony's lips lifted to a faint smile. Even though she may not be able to spend her first month with her friends, it would still be better than wasting away in the Dursley house. "So why use a rug to travel by, Professor?"
"Shite," Draco whispered before silencing the door shut. It was well into three and he cursed the dungeons for the lack of proper window light. He lit his wand with a whispered Lumos. It took roughly twelve minutes to walk to the library, and another five to get in. Unfortunately, he rarely went into the library considering his private home collection far exceeded that of the school's, and he never had been in the restricted section since he probably owned those too. Well except for the one his father wanted.
"Ginny," Harmony laughed "I think he only sees us as friends."
"I was forced." Harmony said, moving her hands to her lap.
The class turned worse than she had expected. Of course she had fallen in the sodding pool. She first hopped that no one would notice her slight curves, and she was so glad that she always wore a tank top. Draco's shirt didn't cling to her and must have been partially waterproof or sweat proof, because beads of water were raining down her sides. Harmony returned to the changing room completely drenched, and feeling ridiculous that she didn't have a sodding towel. Why didn't she know any spells that dried water instantly? She hadn't been the only girl, and most of them were already in the girls' changing room by the time that she had gone. She took off Draco's shirt and rubbed Duddly's old shirt through her dripping hair. It didn't matter here if she looked like a girl, and Harmony slipped her glasses off.
"For the reasons he always desires. I must stop here, Draco, I fear that I have said too much already. I trust that you will not blab this around and most certainly get killed for doing so, right?"
Kreacher stared at the girl in disbelief, but his distraught face did not relax as he bowed his head and shuddered, "as you promise, Master".
Harmony's eyes opened and she jolted from her bed. The darkness contorted around her and she flinched from the hand holding her. Where was she? She looked into Ron's eyes. Cold sweat trickled down her scalp, and her heart raced. She brought her hands to her head, and cradled her body. "Harry!" Her scar burned and she thought that she could smell smoke. She let out a shallow breath as she repeated to herself that she was in the dormitory. Ron wasn't a figment of her imagination.
"Can't you see that you ARE disturbing us," she ground out, hoping to distract him. Of course she could not, it was Draco Bloody Malfoy.
"Why didn't he wait to see then, to see if he had chosen correctly?"
"Bloody Hell," Harmony gripped her knees hard, "I'm not bent, Ron. Get over yourself that I'm friends with Draco."
Lucious offered his hand, which Draco took, and he felt the familiar tug at the core of him, as his father apparated. They appeared with a crack amidst the hustle of the hospital, as green robed wizards and witches with face masks scattered about.
"Don't worry Draco, I won't tell."
Harmony sat up with her back against a cool stone wall. She then noticed the thin black cloak draped over the lower half of her body. She looked up at the standing young man. He was an envious height a bit over six feet tall with a pale yellow shirt and tan pants that melded with his well built frame. His light burnt amber hair swept to his side to the length of his eyebrows. He had a rugged look with slight stubble that defined his square jaw. As if he felt her eyes he took his away from Sirius to rest on green. Only then did she catch herself, she had been checking him out. She abruptly turned to Sirius and hugged his dog form by hiding her face, at least she wouldn't be a deathly pale color anymore. She couldn't believe that she was behaving like such a girl.
"How about Marry Poppins." Harry gapped at him, it was a brilliant name. Damn, Snape was good.
"I'm glad," she bit her bottom lip as she smiled. She would have thought it all impossible to believe, but as she kissed him, it was hard to imagine anything else. No one else would taste like him, act like him, or make her feel this barmy. It scared her for a second, that someone could elate her so, and that it had been Draco Malfoy no less. But it subsided as her heart beat faster, and she couldn't deny her jumbled fervor.
"Holy shite, Harry! This is crazy. Ron and Hermione don't know, right?"
"It's not violent enough," Ginny said.
"Wicked!" Ginny exclaimed, "you are a bloody amazing animal!" Luna gave a small smile in response. They all stood near the key, and Leighton used magic so that the key hoovered within all of their grasps.
But which one is the real one? Oh the girl, she's all over Draco. And the impostor? Couldn't be Granger or Ginger. Lovegood can't act. He looked over to the Gryffindor table and counted the red heads, noting that the youngest was missing. He smirked.
"Oh really, I was asleep the entire time. I guess she didn't want anyone disturbing me unless it was an emergency. You know how protective she can be." Harry smiled a bit "I feel loads better thanks." Ron had his mouth full, so he couldn't really say any platitudes.
"You look too happy," she said with a sigh.
"Harry what are saying?" Hermione laughed.
"Harmony, did Draco propose to you?"
"Liar!" Kreacher shrieked and Harmony barged in. Kreacher stood atop the table with his fists outstretched toward a wand armed Mundungus Fletcher. They both turned their heads at the intruder with similar looks of contempt, though Kreacher's face was warped in rage.
"On purpose," Snape said, by now every students' eyes were on their professor, all but Draco who watched Harmony from his corner.
"Ginny, is something the matter?" Harmony asked.
"What am I doing?" Came a voice from a four poster bed. A single candle flickered from a breeze which should have been impossible. There were no posters of favorite Quidditch teams adorning the walls, no clutter, cards, or photos heaped on wooden surfaces, there was not a single carelessly tossed sock on the black marble floor. The only indication that the inhabitant of this room was a teenage school student were the regal looking school robes and the textbooks that were kept neatly in a low bookshelf. If someone had a look inside, that blatantly uninvited stranger (since nobody had been welcomed in since the owner of the room had moved in five years back) would find nothing of interest, though the only thing worth its value was in fact a person. The same one situated on the bed.
Harmony tiptoed to the Defense Against the Dark Arts room, ten minutes earlier than scheduled. With her wand in hand and Ginny to her back, she allowed the magic to drop from her face. Harmony didn't question the other girl trailing behind, Luna must have been the backup. She motioned the two to stop. Under her breath she silenced the door and cast an unlocking spell. She thus kicked the door with a firm leg, and peered inside. The three formed a triangle, facing different directions.
"Nothing, this place has the best tea." Draco said with an innocent enough expression. She scowled as he skimmed the menu. The chatter around the room filled up their silence.
"But you won't tell us," Ginny said.
She found it odd that Draco had changed direction. Now they were heading away from the frozen yogurt, but that's what they had decided on, right? She looked around behind them and saw a familiar wizard just a few feet away. Their stood the newly elected Minister of Magic.
Draco moved away from her. He yanked the sliding door open and looked down at her as if he was about to challenge her to a fight. "I'll change your mind," he said and closed the door before the pain could show on his face.
"Maybe," she said, "Let's go up to the roof." Harmony picked up her pace.
They soon arrived at a bulky brown door, and stared at its fine wood surface. "So you going to go in or what?" Draco asked.
Lucious Malfoy.
"You're too old for her, old man!" George complained. Charlie crossed his muscular arms and smirked at his brothers.
Dumbledore had stayed the night, and Harmony wondered what would change for her. She pulled on new clothes before heading into the kitchen and greeting her professors. Was it now unsafe to live here? What freedoms would be taken from her? No one said anything to her, as if they didn't want to tell her horrible news. She hated that.
"What about Dumbledore?" Ginny asked.
"Where were you?" Harmony asked.
"Wah?" Harmony asked.
"Nope, but that can easily be fixed." Harry wished that she was still sleeping so that she could sick a few dementors on him, just to frighten the boy. She instead rolled her eyes. At least he didn't know that it was her. Dudley must have a whole collection of pick up lines or something and she wanted to be spared from his sorry attempt.
"It doesn't matter! Everything I do, drives her up the castle wall. I want to know what is wrong." Ginny was about to open her mouth, when Luna caught her shoulder.
"Bliase Zambini, are you asking to be hexed?" Blaise walked with him through the doors, and Draco narrowed his eyes as the other teen pointed at his mouth which was currently filed with toast.
"Why am I not surprised that you're here?" She set her bag down. "Even after Ginny hounded you down like a bludger."
But it was strange that he was so interested in her. Almost to the point of being obsessed. He had always gone out of his way to put her on edge. Was this any different? Harmony watched as the two seekers dived. The snitch had been spotted, and Harmony saw way bellow, the snitch. It was easy to see who was faster, who had better control over the broom. It didn't look like Draco was just falling, he looked like a hawk catching its prey. He had gotten better since the last time they had a match, and as the stadium became silent, Draco reached out his hand at the same time as leveling the broom. Once the snitch was in his hand, the whistle was blown. The Slytherins howled at the win.
"Dude, you are Harry Potter, of course someone will."
Draco looked over to the Gryffindor table and caught the green eyed boy's glance. His back was to the doors, so the only thing that clued him to Harmony's arrival was the way Blaise's jaw went slack. "Hmm?' Draco tilted his head.
"I've been punched a lot," Harmony said, "does that count?"
"Yep. Bye."
Something in Harmony's brain echoed, a light tap to her memories. Don't trust him. Had Snape foreseen this? Who was the he that she was to not trust. "You. What makes you think that I give my trust out so easily? Do you think that because now we are friends you can tell me what to do? This is bigger than you or me." Harmony fisted her hands to tight balls, her eyes fastened on his. "Who do you think you are?" His eyebrow twitched, for a moment it would look like his cold harsh exterior would drop, but just as quickly as the hurt came, he replaced it with apathy.
"Really? I've been working my butt off for months, and he gets it within minutes! Oh Merlin."
"It's alright Ron," Harmony said, "I don't care." Ron continued to glare at Draco to which he responded with a smirk. Ron looked a little put out and gaped at Harmony.
"Hurry it up Harmony, if anyone where to see you, they would laugh. Just trust me." Harmony removed her head from the wall, and realized that if any student had come by, they would have seen her bum in the air, and her head plastered into the floor. Harmony checked for students before her caracal form squeezed into the dirt tunnel, scraping her underbelly into plant roots and pebbles. When she made it through, she was amazed at how big the floor was spaced. And there was Draco, siting casually on a Victorian love seat.
"What the bloody hell have you done to yourself, boy?" Harry wondered how she could tell the truth without it being explicit. She couldn't say that it wasn't what it looked like, because it so obviously was. She bit her bottom lip in concentration.
"Snape," she said with almost absolute certainty. Malfoy practically ate out of Snape's hands.
"You look a little different," Ginny said.
Platters of cakes and caskets of butterbeers appeared as multiple elves fought to feed the students. "What would you like miss?" one of the elves asked.
"Alright Honey Dukes," Draco said with words dripping like sugar, "you're on."
Severus's eyelid twitched. He was still angry with the little stunt Dumbledore had pulled at the party. He wanted to blast the headmaster in neon pink, every inch and strand of him. He took a seat, uncomfortable in the smaller chair. "Now is not a good time."
"That's so strange, did you know that you are the only one here with 'glasses'?" Ginny whispered and air quoted the glasses part. "And the best damn seeker as well." Harmony frowned as she realized that.
"But," Draco said, "I want to be with you." All at once she felt his chest against her, along with arms that embraced her. She met his direct gaze as he searched her face. A warm hand met her cheek and this touch trailed over the shape of her lips. She pressed her palms to his waist, gripping him. His light caress traced down her jaw and rested to the back of her neck. Her breath caught as he wrapped his other hand behind her back and lowered his head. His lips brushed against hers, tantalizing her by not quite touching her. Delicious warmth tingled her body as he fully claimed her lips. She didn't want him to pull away, and gave a slight protest when he did.
"Harmony," Ginny whispered in a deathly silence, "you can't do that."
"Ron, we've been together for only one night," Hermione shook her head.
"Those?" the old wizard scratched at the white whips at his balding head, "have been in my shop since I first opened here 80 years back." He slightly frowned as old memories glittered in his head. "Ah," he said at last and reached inside to bring the two old rings out, "these are a pair of magic rings, and when they are worn by two people, they show how the other is faring. I believe that they still work." Harmony could see the magic there as it absorbed some of the old man's magic. "Funny," he muttered to himself, "haven't seen these for awhile now."
"SMEX education, the M is for magic."
"Are you crazy, that thing is going to crush you," Ginny shot back and grabbed the girl by the back of her robe. The bear went on all fours before charging their way.
"Watched it from my window," she shrugged and didn't miss the glare that Ron shot her as he passed them.
"For what it's worth," Harmony said tentatively, "I doubt that Harry is dead." Hermione raised her eyes to meet Harmony's bright green ones. "Come on now. The Dark Lord couldn't even kill Harry when he was a baby. How could he possibly kill an older, stronger Harry?"
"It wasn't enough to just kill him," Harmony said as she looked down to where Dumbledore's coffin crumbled to reveal a half burnt body. The distinct smell of burning flesh and wood was all that she could smell, making her shudder. Voldemort smiled behind plump red lips that still showed crooked teeth, and patted Dumbledore's wand almost lovingly. Looking at her up close made Harmony want to gag. It wasn't that she looked worse as a snake head. It was knowing that different faces were looking back at her, women who had been killed for the illusion of beauty. She could see parts of Narcissa, features that she knew Draco had as well, that made her feet and hands go cold. Voldemort was hideous, wearing the dead faces of women like prizes. She had to stop him.
"Because you are the greatest thing that ever happened to me." She shook her head and a wistful smile graced her lips.
One of Draco's eyebrows twitched. "Do not belittle me! I can have you sacked!"
"Am I dead?" Harmony asked.
"Yeah," he said glumly, "but I want to get her something special." Ron's brows knit together, looking at bracelets that he could never afford. Harmony had already bought hair accessories for Ginny, and a turnip shaped wallet for Luna, and had some galleons to spare. She took the money from her pocket and passed it to Ron.
Hermione didn't talk for a moment. just mulling over the information. She finally shook her head with a wry half smile on her face. "People I thought I knew, they just keep finding ways to surprise me."
"Goyle, Crabbe, I need you to do something for me, do you think you can?" Both of their heads bobbled yes. "I need you to hit me with-." A second passed as Crabbe wondered what that meant. Goyle though knew what hit meant and decided to act on his instincts. His fist collided with Draco's jaw. He went down immediately.
"I hope you all are familiar with your animal instincts, because we will be going on an adventure," the Professor paused, "Well, multiple ones." The students shared four concerned glances, making him smile reassuringly. "It will be fun." They weren't convinced.
The part of his mind that didn't care about reason wanted to shout yes, but Draco instead said, "I'm sorry." He didn't want to reveal something so heavy without tact. His robes slipped from her hands and she took a step back. "I meant to ask you before." Draco wasn't going to lose her now. She sat down and looked away from him. "Harmony, will you go out with me?"
"I don't know," McGonagall shook her head. She rejoined the other slumbering Gryffindors and read the book under her blanket. She was hoping for some hidden message within the text, but it was a common story of Snow White, similar to the muggle version. She closed the book, and shoved it underneath her pillow. Her last thoughts before closing her eyes were of the queen, as she gazed into the mirror.
She's loyal to her friends obviously. And intelligent. It's not every girl who could pretend to be the most scrutinized boy in the school and pull it off. She's not afraid to break a rule here and there as well. What else?
"That's bullocks," Ginny interrupted with the door banging against the wall, "and don't ever blame Harry for not having time, when all you two ever have time for is snogging!"
"Well when that prick messes up, someone will have to be there for her," George said.
Harmony felt a quick tug on her shoulder push her away from the door, and where her head had been last, a jar shattered.
"Go ask Dumbledore," Harmony muttered. Hermione placed a hand on hers and Harmony moved further away. "Please."
"Well, my father is in need of a certain dark arts book in the restricted section on the library, so I was wondering if you could, uh, help me acquire it." One of Snape's eyebrows raised a smidgen.
"Yeah, but its hard to work with a guy who doesn't make a move on you."
"But the other man she was with," Hermione included, "now, he was something." Ron looked offended. "You on the other hand," Hermione assuaged, facing Ron "are so adorable and delectable and..."
"I just keep wishing that things were different." It was the opposite for her, now that she had accepted Sirius's death. "The locket, it's telling me that I could never be someone you'd fall for. 'Give up' it says 'she's going to be dead anyway'. But..." Draco shook his head.
Harmony went to a little sandwich shop first for a small lunch before making her way to the dim little book shop labeled "Bound Pages". She had never been in that store besides last night and saw that it was a bit stuffy and uninviting. The door opened with a jingle from a graying bell held above the door. Harmony stepped into Hermione's dream heaven, shelves upon selves of book meet the ceiling all a variety of sizes, colors, and conditions. There were even couches and benches where people could read and relax.
Oh it's you again. Harmony heard the hat say to her. I suppose that you'll want to be put in your old house then?
"Shudup! Point that fing' away from me." With raising voices and chairs falling to the floor, the house would soon awaken. "I've nothing of yours."
"He could have been a blasted fairy for all I care. What has gotten into your head, son, he was attacking you." Mr. Malfoy put a hand over his eyes. "This cannot be. Potter has bewitched you."
Her scar began to prickle as she cast her dark eyes on him.
"Well I am a girl," Harmony said.
"Lucky Charms Cereal," Dumbledore whispered loud enough for Harry to hear the password. He looked at the boy and winked, "they're magically delicious." The spiral staircase appeared and they both made it up to his office. Dumbledore gestured towards the comfy chair in front of his desk and also sat down. "Now, what I tell you should not be repeated in case it falls to the wrong ears."
"And where do you think you're going?" Uncle Vernon began, holding a king sized jar of pickles menacingly in his meaty hands. He stopped narrowing his eyes on Draco, taking in those robes that marked him as... one of them. "YOU -" he shook the bobbing pickles, "YOU BROUGHT ONE OF YOUR LOT HERE?"
"Welcome!" A young woman with a pink fluttering apron greeted them and ushered the two into a booth. "I will come back when you two are ready." Harmony was glad that they got a window seat, so that she could distract herself. Boys and girls sat around her in similar booths and it didn't take her a while to notice that the majority of them were couples.
"Alright, that's what I wanted to know. So far what do you got?"
"Fine I'll turn around. But you only have one minute, and don't you dare touch your face." Harmony tackled her clothes mindful not to be anywhere near her head, or suffer Ginny's wrath. After in a more presentable state, Ginny turned around and conjured up a mirror for Harmony to see. Not a sound came out of Harmony's lips. Ginny had transformed her. She had become used to seeing herself as a girl, but the girl now in the mirror was different. She leaned in closer to inspect her long black eyelashes, the purple hues that shimmered on her eyelids, and the tiny hint of pink that caught some of the light on her lips. With her scar properly covered, Harmony's vibrant green eyes were the only things that marked her as Harry. She gave a hesitant smile, hoping that this wasn't a female ritual that she would have to master.
"I need to speak with Harry alone," he said as he watched her boyish face glare at him.
"When you attain a level of awareness concerning the nature of people and their magic, it is quite simple, you just have to look." Leighton explained, as if it were obvious.
"I don't know if I can leave you alone now, Potter," Draco replied in a smoothness much like that of snake scales. "I assume that you don't want others to know, I just want to compromise with you," he waited a moment before continuing. "I don't want to fight with you for the rest of these years, I can be your friend."
