Potter goes without complaint. He lays quietly, doesn’t fidget or make small talk. Draco lets him be as he gets on with the spells. When he’s finished, Potter doesn’t sit up straight away. He’s resting his head sideways on his hands, facing the wall when he speaks.
“Ah, yeah. Sorry I’m late, I—” Potter hesitates. “Well, I had an excuse planned, but I was just embarrassed after last week.”
“I think it’s called dating, Potter. It might have been a while since I’ve had time to try it myself, but I hear it’s still quite popular.”
“I know, I know. Really, I do. Hermione reminds me of that fact at least twice a week, somewhere between working, kids, and research.”
By next week, Draco’s research has uncovered enough information that he has some questions for Potter. Potter, obviously, is not exactly forthcoming with answers.
“Fuck, shut up, forget I said anything.” And Potter is already turning around and moving quickly on his wheels towards the door.
Granger-Weasley’s face is hard as she looks at Draco for several seconds, no doubt assessing his motives and how much time she can afford to waste on the niceties. For Draco, of course, this is more than just a polite enquiry.
While he’s performing the requisite spells, and while Potter is in the best mood he has seen him in, Draco dares to make conversation. If he’s fishing for information at the same time, well, that’s just because Potter is one of the least forthcoming patients he’s ever worked with.
“Yes, alone, right.” Potter clears his throat and looks away. “I’ll certainly give it a go. Shall we?” He points over to the examination couch.
“There was a young girl not long after I became an independent Healer. She’d picked up an enchanted watch. A strangulation curse began in her fingers, slow moving, but severely restricting blood flow as it spread to her palm and her wrist. There is no counter-curse. There was only ever one possible treatment.”
It is 4:40pm when Potter finally slinks into the reception room. Draco didn’t know it was even possible to slink in a wheelchair, but Potter manages it. He keeps his eyes on the book in front of him, but Draco’s focus is on Potter in the periphery of his vision.
“I know.” Potter rubs at his eyes under his glasses. “It’s been really difficult since I was released from St Mungo’s. Since I woke up, really.”
“Understandable,” says Draco with a nod. “I’m just glad you didn’t skip out completely. I would’ve been knocking on your door at home—these appointments are
“Right.” Draco drops his arms and regrets even asking. “Of course. Well, we’re done here.” He steps back from the examination couch.
Draco rather thinks the blanket will be to keep his legs warm, because Potter won’t be able to feel when they get too cold. It’s actually quite sensible. Not verbalising this thought to Potter is
“Pinpointing the exact reason I’m still single, thanks for that, Potter. All that time I’ve spent dating and getting to know people. Totally wasted.”
“I get it, and I love her for it, but I don’t understand the concern. You’ll find something. You always do, right? You said you have a perfect track record with your previous cases.”
“Whatever it is, you can tell me, and we’ll figure out whether it’s related to the curse or not, okay?”
“How does it work? The… procedure, or whatever… to remove the curse? Does it take long? Is it painful? I need to prepare myself.”
As Potter sits, a ball of fraught energy across the desk from Draco, Draco himself starts to get a little antsy. He sits on his hands, forcing a calm openness to his face. He waits.
There was a plan. A set of rules and expectations that Draco let fall. Failure, his father always said, was not an option for a Malfoy. But Draco failed, and now there was nothing left.
“He's dead.” Draco was laughing. “The boy who lived is dead.” he marveled at the irony and it was all he could do to keep from sobbing. Of course, he was dead. He had to be, with as much blood as was pooled in the bathroom and all over Draco and then the amount of time it took him to find somebody to help him, no there was no way even Harry Potter survived that mass amount of blood loss. He continued to scratch violently at his hands, his arms, and anything else that was dipped in red. “Your savior is gone.” Draco choked on the last word. He looked up and stared at Dumbledore. “Isn't he?” He asked quietly. He wanted the headmaster to tell him he was wrong, to tell him, he's not dead, that this was all some trick the Weasley twins set up in retaliation for whatever stupid thing Draco had surely done at some point. Draco stared at Dumbledore, pleading with him in his head, until an unseen force jumped on him causing Draco to hit the ground, forcing the air from his lungs. Unseen sure, but a blur of fiery hair pretty much gave it away immediately.
He was gone. He himself was gone from the moment. From that place. From all of space and time it seemed. He couldn’t make out what was happening to him until he reappeared in the middle of a dark neighborhood street beside Dumbledore. Harry loathed apparition. The way he was swept up into nothing, his very being felt like it was being pulled and squished and blended and bent in ways a person should never be. He loathed even more that when it came to Dumbledore he was given no warning. It was just, one moment there and the next gone.
“Did you forget that the Dark Lord, the most powerful wizard of our time, did you not think he could tell that you are untrue?” His father was whispering angrily over him. Draco was still stunned from the slap to let the words sink in. “you have killed us all” and then the room was filling with more people. But the only thing Draco could focus on was his mother. The strongest person Draco had ever known. His mother was on the floor hugging herself with tears running down her face, a hand clamped over her mouth to try and silence her cries.
He had to figure a way to save Malfoy though. Why exactly he even wanted to save the boy he couldn't comprehend. Malfoy made it his personal mission, it seemed, to make Harry's life acutely miserable at school. Not that Malfoy much exceeded in that. Malfoy had nothing on the Dursleys.
Draco didn't wait to watch them fall. He could feel everyone holding their breath for a brief moment before the room flew into chaos, everyone more intent on helping the Aurors then on Draco. And that's exactly what he needed. He slipped through the curtains separating him from Harry almost without anyone seeing. Anyone but Hermione who met his eyes just before he pulled the curtains tightly closed and spelled them locked. He didn't want to turn around. He didn't want to see Harry the way he was now but he needed to. He exhaled slowly turning on his heel and almost immediately his heart dropped to the floor. Draco was sure he could hear it shattering like his mother's crystal vase he had knocked over when he was seven.
He hadn’t been too keen on realizing even here he had a babysitter. And that apparently the goings-on at number four Privet Drive wasn’t cause enough for Dumbledore to involve himself. He remembered breaking down in front of her when he found out why she was there and what all she knew. He had thought at the time if she had only told Dumbledore he wouldn’t have had to go back. But she had told him. And Dumbledore did nothing.
Draco could hear a commotion outside the curtains and sucked in a breath soon someone would come along and break his spell, take him away. He sucked in a shaky breath.
“Malfoy,” Harry said to his left but Draco turned and knelt in front of him, looking him in the swollen eyes. He was asking a silent question, and Potters eyes gave him his answer, still, he kept eye contact and reached out. He moved slowly and took Harry by the wrist as gently as he could, watching for any hint of fear in his eyes, When there wasn't any he pulled the boy to his feet and marched out of Dumbledore’s office.
He sat there long enough for his body to start going numb in places, tingling as the blood flow slowed too much. Birds started to sing the songs of morning somewhere close by. He still didn’t move. He wondered if Draco had ever woken up. If Madam Pomfrey and Snape had figured out what was the matter with him and healed him once and for all. A darker part of him wondered if he was dead. The thought made him gag on the bile that rose suddenly in his throat. He wasn’t used to feeling such things about Draco. His unease had always been founded in suspicion. Now his reaction came from a  place of pure concern. Light broke in the sky washing the tall grass in the colors of sunrise.
honestly Harry was in no mood for all of that rubbish. He looked between Horace and Dumbledore unsure of how he was supposed to handle this.
“The thing Harry Potter used to kill himself with,” he stated dully. There really was no way to sugarcoat it, not that he was ever in the business of sugarcoating anything but he held so much respect for this woman it felt wrong to just blurt something like out with nothing to soften the blow. He could see her eyes start to water but she nodded.
“You know I can’t leave someone dying and not do anything about it.” Draco looked again to Potter, staring at him even. The tension between the two was unlike anything Draco had ever felt before. He’d always thought Potter and the headmaster were close. That Potter trusted the old man. He was supposed to be the good guy. Dumbledore and Harry were supposed to save everyone. However, it was clear in the set of Potter’s jaw that that was not the case. Draco could feel himself wilting. He could feel some small shred of hope buried somewhere deep in him shrivel and disappear. He felt robbed of something fundamental. Something he didn't even know he was holding onto. Some hope he must have been clinging to since before Harry Potter became someone he loathed rather than a fairy tale.
“A friend,” Harry said noncommittally. Ron didn't push. He never really did. He handed Harry parchment when they reached the kitchen and a quill and Harry scratched out his quick message, handing it to the owl and watching it take flight. It would reach Draco before Harry could.
he slipped through the halls of what used to be his home. What used to be warm and comforting. But now, Malfoy manor had never felt worse to him. He ducked into his room and carefully worked the ring off his finger dropping it onto his dresser in disgust. He didn’t want to wear the Malfoy crest if this is what being a Malfoy was about.
Hi Friends! it seems in my disorganization and lack of sleep I have posted chapters out of order skipping what was supposed to be chapter five, a chapter from Harry's point of view. I am fixing the order now, if you were confused I urge you to please read this chapter and then continue on to reread chapter six which I accidentally posted early I am sorry. I hope this gets seen by anyone and it helps move the story along as I'd intended it.
He wasn’t sure exactly when the girls came back. It was late into the evening when Hermione came into Ron's room. Ron was snoring on his twin-sized bed, his foot hanging off the end of it. Harry was sitting with his knees tucked under his chin on the second bed. She sat next to him.
“Sure. who ya writing to” The question wasn’t meant to be nosy, just a way to make conversation as they climbed down the stairs. And really Harry had told Ron almost everything so it didn’t seem out of place for him to ask.
“I didn’t know I was,” He admitted “Dumbledore,” He said instead of a real answer. She nodded as if that made perfect and complete sense. And it did. Dumbledore wasn’t in the Habit of making his plans known to anyone but himself. Harry did try not to think this bitterly. Mr. Weasly clapped him on the back smiling at him.
“What about Potter '' he blurted, the forced calm he’d been trying to hold onto was slipping from him and it could be heard in the slight tremor when he said the other boy's name.
“Professionally, yes. I have a perfect track record with previous patients, I would hate for you to ruin that by failing to attend a simple appointment and letting the curse continue to play merry with your spinal cord unchecked.”
The door opens, and Draco looks up to see Potter roll into the room. He does a double-take, and even stops to check his diary. Potter definitely doesn’t have an appointment.
Draco doesn’t know what to say, but he definitely doesn’t want to ask Potter to repeat himself. He settles for blinking several times.
An hour and a half passes before either of them looks at the clock, but for once, Potter doesn’t seem in a hurry to dash from the room.
Draco feels himself freeze and works hard to get himself moving again. He blinks, he nods, he interlaces his fingers. He knows what’s Potter is referring to, of course he does, but still. To buy himself some time and to make
“You know I knew you were a git. Everyone knows you’re a git and you have your strange rivalry with Potter but you’re not a killer. I know that better than anyone. And you know better than anyone that I haven't spoken to my death eater parents in 4 years. So once you realize that you have all of one friend in this god forsaken hell hole I’ll be there waiting for you to come to your bloody senses.” Zabini stood there waiting for him to say something, probably waiting for him to apologize. The lump was back in Draco's throat and he feared that the second he opened his mouth to say anything then that would be it and he'd start to cry again and Malfoys didn't cry. Instead, he just rolled over to face away from his friend who he could hear cursing under his breath as he walked out of the room.
He missed flying, no matter how hot it was, feeling the wind in his face created only by how fast he could cut through the air was exhilarating. It was something he was good at, really and truly good at. Something that wasn’t tied to Voldemort, or his scar, or his bloody destiny. Something that wasn’t orchestrated for him. Something that was just him.
“My mother’s eyes. Yeah,” He said he was getting tired of hearing that. If it wasn’t the scar and the story that went with it. It was the eyes like his mother's. He picked up a frame positioned at the front. His mother. He felt guilty for resenting this that they had in common, but he was desperate for someone to recognize him for something that was just him.
Once he’s back in his seat, Potter heads straight for the door. He pauses in the doorway, twisting at the waist to look at Draco.
. You’re still experiencing it, despite the paralysis, because sex is mostly psychological. You’re not getting blue balls, you’re getting blue brain.”
Potter’s eyes continue to move, taking in Draco’s office, though it’s all just bookshelves and an examination couch.
“No more curse means nothing to monitor and keep under control. You don’t need to be under my care at all. In fact, let me get your discharge papers.”
This time, Draco shakes his head. “I knew at the end of our last session that I need to tell him. But I know he won’t take it well, and I know he’ll blame me—which is fine. He’ll need to process, and he’ll need someone to blame.” He looks stoically over his desk at Granger-Weasley. “I can be that for him, but he will also need support.”
“Work with what you’ve got, Potter. Use feathers, silk, oils, ice. Whatever wakes your nerve endings up. Then keep going.”
“This” Dumbledore said, moving to stand next to him and put a hand on his shoulder. Harry didn’t shrug him off no matter how bad he wanted to. “Is Harry Potter” The excitement on Horace’s face quickly turned dark, Harry had half a mind to step away.
“M.. Mother?” he stuttered. Of course, he stuttered, he could never stand tall against his mother. She used to be his safe place. She used to be the only one he didn't have to pretend around. The only one who has ever seen him cry past his toddler years. And Draco very much felt like crying now.
“You wished to see me?” Draco never thought he'd be so ecstatic to hear the monotone voice of his head of house.
“Straight to your dorms Draco and I'll see you tonight, I'll send a house elf for you when it's time,” Dumbledore said looking down at some papers on his desk and dismissing him with a wave of his hand. Draco glared at the old man and turned to stalk out of the room. ‘Straight to the dorms’ his ass. He thought to himself as he headed down the corridor.
The first thing that caught his eye wasn’t the dark mark standing out clear as day on the pale pale skin where the sleeve of the shirt had been ripped, or the once white button-down shirt that now clung wet with blood to the boy. no, the first thing Harry noticed was his face and the dark dark bruise on his face. And his closed eyes. And the lips that were turning blue, slightly parted. And he saw the boy’s chest shudder with the attempt at breathing.  And with sudden absolute clarity, Harry knew he had to help him.
Malfoy gagging and bleeding. Pomfrey and Snape taking turns shouting for things from each other. The way he was certain he heard his name, McGonnagal rushing into the room just before Dumbeldore whisked him away.
He was being stretched and spun again as they ripped their way through space. It was all he could think about until they landed. Harry breathed hard for a few minutes before he realized he was standing in water. His feet and ankles were soaked. He opened his eyes and almost fell. A mixture of despair and excitement was battling in him. It was the place he loved most outside of Hogwarts. It was the only place he wanted to spend summers. But it wasn’t the hospital wing, where he left Draco thrashing, and with Dumbledore gone he had no way to get back.
(if you need to skip i will be putting a small recap of the necessary information story wise in the notes to the next chapter!)
It seemed to escape the notice of everyone else at the table that The Dark Lord was more interested in killing a teenage boy than his take over on the ministry. He’d asked his father about that after his fourth year at Hogwarts when the rumors of the Dark Lord's return had started. His father had gotten quiet, but not angry. His father had said it wasn’t for him to understand and left it at that.
“Please sit,” He said to Draco once the door was shut and the staircase was done spinning. It wasn't a question or an offer, the please was simply the sugar to make the pill easier to swallow. It was an order, a command. One like you would give an unruly house elf. He took on the same tone that his father used constantly, the only tone Draco’s father ever took with him. “Orders were made to be followed, made to be listened to.” Lucius had made that clear to him as a child. Draco looked at the armchair Dumbledore was gesturing to. Silenced stretched on as Draco took in the armchair in front of him for some reason to him it represented surrender. “What happened.” He asked when it became apparent to him that he wasn't keen on following his orders.
“Well it is certainly good to have you” He seemed genuine. The Weasleys always were welcoming no matter what it seemed.
A lump rose in Draco's throat and he fought hard to swallow it. He didn't cry. Malfoys don't cry. He chanted this in his head over and over until a single hot tear managed to escape and with it, his levee broke. Tears streamed down his face without permission and he ducked into the first door he came across.
The closer he came to the Burrow the more he felt like breaking. He felt lost. Used and discarded as he was time and time again it seemed. Was there anything he could do to get back before the train? How long was there even before the train? He usually knew. A countdown to the hour living in the back of his mind all through the summers. But he had forgotten by now. This must have been planned. Dumbledore didn’t want him underfoot. He served his purpose and while normally, being here would be a relief. He couldn’t shake the worry that clung to him. The way Draco said his name in his sleep. The way it was Draco now. He didn’t know when it changed for him but there was no arguing that it had.
“I was in his head but it was different. It wasn’t clear like it usually is.” His voice sounded shaky and he tried to swallow the nerves. “It was more intense too, I was more” He hesitated only a fraction of a moment before forcing himself to continue “More connected somehow. He was hurting someone, I couldn't see who. But it wasn’t just that. I was doing it too. I
Chapter Eight! i'll be honest usualy i pants my way through everything I write which is one of two reasons I never manage to post consistently. howeverrrrr i may or may not have planned the next 17 chapters of this fic in detail so I'm hoping chapters will come out faster. I'm hoping.
“So you’re to convince me then,” Horace said behind him. Harry's jaw clenched a moment before he forced himself to relax. He glanced at Horace preparing to say something though he wasn’t sure as to what. “You look very like your father,” Horace said. Harry quickly turned back to the bookshelves.
For the third time in a little over a week, he found himself sitting in an oversized armchair across the ornate wooden desk from Albus Dumbledore. And for the third time, he stared only at his hands.
“I don't know, Headmaster.” Draco interrupted, It was covered in flowers. He had always found that furniture with printed pictures on it was unreasonably busy to look at. His mother would have loved a chair like this in her living room.
“I would be right in assuming you have no intention of retiring to your rooms for the evening?” Dumbledore asked them.
“Right then. Some privacy, would you like some tea?” she asked holding out a cup already full of steaming liquid. He took it, and took a seat in one of the armchairs, setting his tea down beside him. Her office was much different than the other teachers here. For one there wasn't a desk in between her and whomever she needed to speak with, instead, there was just a circle of about half a dozen mixed matched arm chairs all facing each other. She took a seat in the one closest to Draco and turned it a bit to face him better. She tried handing him a biscuit but he turned it down, focused more on what he was about to say.
“You need to be careful in any matter.” she had the same expression on her face she wore when there was something to solve. “I don’t trust it” Harry curled tighter in on himself. She was right not to, after everything she personally had been through because of him, Harry could hardly expect anything else. “Have you told Ron?”
Draco was filled with horrible flashbacks as he remembered the last time he ran through these doors. Carrying the boy who lived in his arms. Feeling the blood on his hands and arms and soaking through his shirt. He remembered vividly how he yelled himself horse for anyone to help them. It was with the same panic in his chest that he burst into the hospital wing again.
“Oh, i will have none of this.” Madam Pomfrey muttered. “Utter nonsense.” she continued as she walked away from them and towards the aurors. “Who sent you here?” he could hear her demand.” she lead them away and Draco couldn't hear anymore.
If anyone were to attempt a guess at how Harry spent his summers, it wouldn’t be his best friends. It wouldn’t be his professors, or Lupin, or even Dumbledore. It would be Madam Pumfrey. He visited her on his first night back to Hogwarts every year since his second. And last year she sent him a few potions, one for infection, one for internal bleeding, one for pain, one for sleep, and one to help ease natural healing. Harry took the whole sack to Malfoy’s side.
Two hours and three letters later Harry was done. He thought he’d written to the people with the biggest chance of caring, or ability to help. First was Dumbledore. The first letter Harry had written with blood still sticky on his hands. Leaving red fingerprints along the edges of the page. Good. maybe that would get his attention. The next was to professor McGonagall. The head of Gryffindor house and the one who offered him a biscuit when he’d gone off on Umbridge rather than scolding him for it. And the last letter, the one Harry wasn’t sure he was going to write at first, was to Severus Snape. Not someone Harry trusted or even liked. In fact, Harry knew he was aligned with Voldemort even if, for whatever reason, no one trusted him on it. He also knew that he was Draco Malfoy’s Godfather. The term hurt Harry. Godfather. It tore through him with a vengeance after a full summer of pushing away the loss of his own Godfather. But now wasn’t the time to mourn. He addressed each letter and wondered how to go about sending them.
“There's more,” he said quietly waiting until she motioned him to continue. “I found the thing he used to do it.
“It is out of my hands,” Dumbledore said, making a show of holding out his hands like he was showing Draco there was nothing he could do.
He walked aimlessly for awhile not worried about running into anybody for at least another hour. He was completely lost in thought when he found himself standing in front of the very place he never wanted to see again. A place that would be stained in his memory for the rest of his life. A place he was heading straight into.
Mrs. Weasly came around the corner, wiping her hands on her apron. “Harry!” She sounded surprised but at least there wasn’t a hint of annoyance he could find anywhere on her. “Well, why didn’t you tell us you were coming dear boy I thought we wouldn’t get to see you until Christmas this year” Harry felt his cheeks color.
“Blimey, but you didn’t have to be so rough about it.” The man said, rubbing a spot on his rather round stomach. Dumbledore was positioned in front of Harry enough that the man hadn’t yet noticed him. “What gave me away?”
Draco was relieved for himself and sick for his father and the way he shrank back. Shoulders back. Chin up. But his father cowered. And handed over his wand.
“It tends to run in families, not always. I'm sure you've heard of Sirius Black. All his lot was in my house, but not Sirius,  no sir he was a Gryffindor. He's dead, you know.” It was with a casualty that one could only talk about death when they didn’t care in the slightest, that he said this. Harry thought he was going to be sick. He felt red hot and faint and like his stomach was twisting around itself.
Draco studied Dumbledore. He seemed annoyed. Bothered by them being here. Not outwardly. It was an impossible thing to notice but somehow Draco did.
“You've gotta be fucking kidding me Granger.” Draco blew up, cutting her off and turning away from the girl, hiding his face in his hands. “Fuck,” he growled again. He let his hands fall to his sides and looked around, taking in his current situation. Madam Pomfrey was positively yelling at one of the Aurors who had her by her arm and the other was currently walking towards him. There was no point in fighting them, if there was no way to save Harry then he would be charged with his murder without a second thought. Anger filled Draco until his vision was coated in red. He wouldn't let anyone take him out of this room until he could see Harry Potter. Tears threatened to blur his vision further as the beginning of a planed, admittedly a terrible plan but a plan, all the same, formed in his mind.
“Potter open your eyes,” he said, his voice shaking as he grabbed at the wounds on Harry's arms. “Damnit potter opens your eyes,”  he said again. The blood didn't slow, just poured through Draco's fingers. This wasn't going to work. He slid his arms under Harry and scooped him up. He wasn't as heavy as he thought he should have been. Draco nearly slipped trying to get out of the stall. Fuck, Draco thought. Fuck, fuck, “FUCK” he finally screamed. He tore out of the room and into the hallway again. He needed to get potter to the hospital wing. He started to run.
Also I try to make sure to add warnings in my notes beforehand if I miss anything please let me know so I can edit in! Thank you!
“Oh, Harry.” Draco exhaled, ignoring the way his voice cracked. It no longer mattered now. Not here. Here he didn't have to worry about being a Malfoy. What would it help him now? He bit his lip so hard he could taste a slight hint of blood on his tongue. “Harry why,” Draco broke off, glancing away from the boy.  “I bet you'd love this.” Draco chuckled darkly. “As we speak, there are two Aurors outside these curtains who, as soon as they wake up, will be arresting me for killing you.”  Draco swallowed hard. “Why,” he repeated. His voice finally breaking into a strangled sob. “You had everything, Potter. Friends and family and loyalty. Definitely, things I didn't have.” Draco whipped away a tear that had, without permission, fallen down his face. “You know what else I never had potter? A chance. You never gave me a chance.” he could barely speak above a whisper now as more tears threatened to break ranks. “All these years could have been so very different if only you had given me a chance. Not that I deserved one.” he thought over the past few years. “Yeah definitely didn't deserve it but, I would have changed.” he took a few steps closer and placed one of his hands on Harry’s. “For you Harry I could have changed.” the boy looked so very very fragile.
Everything continued in this way until Draco could forget, if only for a moment, that his family had cast him away, that his home was full of snakes and death eaters, that there was ever another way of living.
“You’re not sending him back,” Potter said incredulously. “We don’t even know who’s bloody trying to kill him” Sending him back... That's what Potter was worried about? Sending Draco home. He fought the urge to roll his eyes. Home was the safest place for him, surely Potter couldn’t think he’d gotten this hurt there? He thought of his mother and his father, always there for him always protecting him. For a moment when he thought of them though he thought of his mother crying and he thought he felt a burn in his cheek and lip. Home was safe. However, even as he thought so, he was overwhelmed by a fear he couldn’t place.
The park was hot. Sweat trickled down his neck and back making him feel wet and gross. Harry always felt gross over the summer. He hated the raw heat.
“What, what do you mean?” He tried to pull his mask back on, to stand straighter, but it felt like the world was threatening to crush him in that moment. There were footsteps in the hall behind her. Multiple footsteps and Draco felt his fight or flight reflex trying to surface. He wanted to run.
“Oh my dear Horace, if there had been death eaters then there would have been the Dark mark in the sky. That and the presence of dragon's blood, though I will hand it to you, you make a rather convincing armchair my old friend.” Harry scratched at the back of his neck absently. He felt completely useless standing there. He was certain there was no reason for him to be here.
“You seemed to have managed” Dumbledore was saying. “Young Malfoy is looking just fine and we are rather busy preparing for the beginning of term.”
“Not quite. I was just wondering if I could borrow your washroom” Harry sagged. Horace pointed to where it was and it was just the two of them. He didn’t like being so close to Horace, he didn’t know the man, so he wandered around the living room, looking at spines of books and odd trinkets.
Blood wasn’t a foreign sight to Harry. To most people, the sight of so much of it would likely lead to a fit of nausea or even a fainting spell. Harry was used to open wounds and red was his favorite color
“Sure dear.” And just like that, she was back to her normal mothering ways. She led him through the crowd of doctors, there must have been a good dozen of them crammed into the tight walkway between beds and whispered a few things to one of the younger looking doctors. Draco followed close behind and tried to gather his thoughts.
He glanced at Hedwig, his beautiful perfect Snowy owl trapped in her cage. A thick padlock hung off the door and the sight twisted in Harry. He knew what it was to be trapped. He wished he could let her out. But he couldn’t. So what was his next option? Ms. Figg. who Harry had found out last year had direct contact with Dumbledore.
He wasn’t a very strong person. Not physically or any other way a person could be described as strong. But he was a determined person. It was with that determination, Harry slid his arms under the boys’ shoulders and knees and stood. He was light. But so was Harry. It wouldn’t be the easiest thing in the world. Harry wasn’t even sure where they would go yet. But he started walking anyway.
Draco couldn’t comprehend it. The voices were still whispering as if he and Potter weren’t here. As if there wasn’t so much blood soaked into their clothes that the stench of iron hung in the air. It was like they weren’t even there.
For no reason at all harry decided to go with a 45% chance that his aunt and uncle were asleep. He hated to go with 50/50 odds. It felt like cheating somehow.
He walked quickly out of the neighborhood. He skipped the park for now and kept walking. His glasses were cracked and bent but it was only a mild inconvenience. He was a bit surprised he’d made it this far into the summer before they were broken. He knew Hermione would fix them for him as soon as they were on the train.
Draco Malfoy was unconscious in his bed. Before he could really let that thought sink in, he heard movement throughout the house. Harry half jumped, half crawled across the small room closing his door as quietly as he could and twisting the lock. An act that was always forbidden when his uncle was home. He'd rather risk him finding a locked door than a boy in his bed. A bleeding boy in his bed. A bleeding wizard boy in his bed. Merlin, but he would be dead if Vernon found out about this. And not in the way kids claim their parents would kill them. Harry would be really and truly dead. Buried under Petunia’s roses or thrown to the bottom of the lake in the middle of the night never to be seen again kind of dead. This would only ever end badly, Harry knew that. But he was determined to avoid that particular future.
The room, unlike the last time he had been in here, was full of people. People Draco hadn’t ever seen here at Hogwarts before and up in the middle of them all was Madam Pomfrey, directing everyone and answering questions. It dawned on Draco then that they would have called for doctors from St. Mungo's and probably other wizarding hospitals to help bring their savior back to life.
“Sod off Zabini I need sleep.” Draco cleared his throat in hopes he’d sound normal. The other boy looked at him for a long moment causing Draco to squirm in his spot. Until finally he hopped off of Draco's bed.
He took his time pulling himself out of bed. He felt heavy and sluggish and his head ached horribly. He pulled his glasses on, still trying to remember taking them off in the first place. He had dreamt, he was sure of it. But the figures were even more out of focus than the last time and the images were running out of his head faster than Harry could catch them. He remembered a long table. He couldn't place if there were other people. If there were they didn't materialize fully. He remembers his name, he thought it was his name anyways. But the rest was blurring wisps of nothing. He found his way down the stairs following the sound of voices. He hesitated just out of sight of the others.
Then the Dark Lord entered the room. Draco wasn’t sure what happened but the room went dark and cold.
They ended up not going to Diagon Alley, Ron seemed content to sit around with him for most of the day. Talking about quidditch and the first trip they would take to Hogsmeade. Harry told Ron about meeting Slughorn but not that he had spent a few days at the castle with Draco. He didn't tell him that the friend he sent a letter to was Draco. He didn't tell him anything about Draco. . He wasn’t keeping it from Ron so to speak, he was just worried about what reaction he would get from him. Ron hated Draco and with good reason. He had no idea what the past few days meant between him and Draco. And if that was anything that could end up being friendship what would that mean for Ron and Hermione.
Malfoys didn’t bow to anyone. So he’d thought. But he’d seen his father bow to the Dark Lord countless times. The Dark Lord made a noise of approval and Draco stood and left.
“I wouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions, Weasel,” Draco said softly not putting near as much energy he usually put into fighting with the ginger boy.
“Where are you going?” He asked. It wasn’t his voice, it couldn’t be. But it was. It was distorted like it was folding in on itself and he could hear it ricocheting off the walls. It wasn't his but it was. He laughed again as the boy tried to get away.
“And what do I have to do with it? Why am I here?”  He had to admit he was upset to be pulled away in the middle of everything for something that seemed like Headmaster business. Not ‘Chosen One’ Business.
“Draco you have to run,” That hadn’t come from Harry. That was another voice. A voice he knew well. That was his mother's voice. He looked up, searching for her, but there was no one there. No one but him and Potter who was looking at him with eyes as wide as they could go being half swollen shut.
Everything continued until the cold came. Fall and its usual chill that prepared everyone for the snow of winter. That's when it started to get bad again.
Chapter the next! It's a longer one but and it's not my favorite but there was a lot of time to cover I hope you like it!
Chapter eleven!!! this is going by much faster than I thought, Twelve and Thirteen will be coming shortly. let me know what you think!
He held his shoulders back, kept his chin up but his eyes down and he followed his mother and father into the long black room that once served as a place for his father to hold meetings with people he wanted to intimidate.
He was told his whole wizarding life that you couldn’t just feel magic in the air. That it was just something that existed in him. But everyone was wrong. There was a distinct shift in the air, something almost electric, that tickled the hairs on his arm and the back of his neck.
Until he did. All at once. Stopping in his tracks and breathing heavy. The edges of his vision pulsed in and out of focus. His ears were ringing so loud that even as he watched Harry's lips moving, he couldn’t hear the words being said. He took a step backward and the pain came back to him all at once. His side was on fire, he doubled over wrapping his arms around himself and when he looked up again, he wasn’t in the corridor. He was in a room he only remembered seeing once. He was behind bars and his mother was looking at him with an intensity he had never before seen in her. She was disheveled and tear-stained and she was whispering something to him. Something he knew she shouldn’t be saying. He wanted to reach out and touch her but as soon as the vision of her had come it was gone and he was looking at Potter again.
“I hesitated and I wish I hadn't. Believed me I wish I hadn't waited a single moment. I picked him up and ran. I knew I had to save him because he was supposed to save us all. Nobody else was in the bathroom when I got there and nobody else was there when we left. I didn't cast any spells I didn't even know there was a spell to keep people out until Dumbledore told me a few hours ago. And I know that by my entering this morning it made it look like I was the one who cast the spell but I swear I didn't.”
“They think you tried to kill Harry. Their aurors.” about that time one of the men looked up from his conversation with Ron and started heading towards Draco.
“I started it. I picked a fight with him,” he said quickly not wanting to get anyone in trouble. Not today at least.  He'd find a way to get back at the redhead some other time.
“You better hope that he's okay Malfoy.” the way he said his name made it sound like it was a dirty word. Draco looked away as the remaining two-thirds of the golden trio walked past him and out of Dumbledore's office.
Immediately Harry fell into the defensive. His wand was tucked into his waistband but he didn’t grab it, not yet. He tried to act like nothing was wrong, pulled his shoulders back, and casually brushed the non-existent dirt from his pants before starting to walk across the park.
“I'm fine” He found himself saying, his mouth moving without his permission. Dumbledore and Potter stared at him like they had forgotten he was even here. Even to Draco, his voice sounded weak. It reminded him of the way his father sounded when he spoke to the Dark Lord.
“What was all that about?” Harry asked, irritation clear in his tone. Dumbledore merely held a finger up at him, to silence him. He sighed and they continued to walk.
“Just One,” he said, handing Dumbeldore a glass and not handing Harry one. He tried not to look put out.
In his father's stories, the Dark Lord was a good guy, the superhero who stood up for what was right.
“Was it bad this summer?” Ron only asked him when they were alone but he made sure to ask it at the end of every summer. They weren't allowed to communicate, for fear of letters being tracked and Harry's supposed safe location becoming known to the wrong sort. Ron didn’t know the extent of things. He didn't know about what his Uncle would do to him. Didn't know about the cupboard Harry was still forced into from time to time. But he knew about the bars on the window and that was enough for Ron to worry.
Tears!? Bloody Tears? Why the fuck was he crying. He closed the door behind him and slid to the floor hugging his knees. Why was he crying? ‘Because he's dead’ he thought to himself bitterly. Yes, so Harry Potter's dead that's good that should be a good thing shouldn't it? No more pressure from his father to get information about the damned boy, no more being involved in the dark lord's plot to kill him, because he was already dead. He was the bane of Draco's existence and he hated him so why in the fuck is he sitting here crying over his death like a bloody girl?!
Draco brought his knees to his chest and buried his face in his arms. No, he wasn't crying for harry. He was crying for him. Crying for the childhood he never had, crying for his eleven-year-old self, locked in his father's dungeons for breaking something expensive. Crying over his broken life. Sobbing over Harry. Well if this is what he was going to do for awhile he might as well hand himself over to it.
Without looking he knew where he was. Same place he had fled to the last time he ran away from the headmaster. He turned to face the bare room. immediately he looked to the golden mirror, the sheet pooled on the floor still, from when he ripped it off. Then, from where he stood he noticed it. And how could he not have seen it before? He walked closer, fishing the broken shard of glass from his pocket. The mirror was missing a piece. And he got closer he knew in his bones that the glass in his hand would fit perfectly. He reached his free hand out to feel the edges of the hole, ignoring the blur as the mirror prepared to show him his deepest desire. He traced the empty spot wondering how Harry had broken the mirror. It was said that the mirror couldn't break.  He pulled his hand back the same time the image in the mirror cleared.
Nobody took notice of the three teenagers standing in the doorway, and Draco used this to his advantage. He walked straight to the closed privacy curtains, sure that Harry would be behind them. He was within three steps of pulling the curtains back when he was noticed.
Draco was ordered to stay in his common room. He sat on his bed and stared at the curtains that were pulled closed around him. Today's breakfast tray laid untouched at his feet. It was bad enough being sent to his room like a petulant child, it was another for them to have taken away his wand. ‘Probation’ they called it. A fancy word for saying the headmaster didn't trust him, but what else is new? He wasn't allowed to go to classes, he couldn’t roam the corridors, hell he wasn't even allowed to send any letters. As if he had anyone to send letters to anyways. He couldn't sit still anymore. He couldn't look at the green curtains anymore. They reminded him too much of the boy he let die. Angered he ripped the silky curtains open and in a way that only a Malfoy could, he stalked out of the room.
Once the laugh escaped his lips, something else tried to follow. Something from deep inside his chest tried desperately to tear free of its bone cage and climb up his throat. Harry swallowed the lump. He would not cry. Not in his aunt and uncle's house. Not kneeling next to Draco Malfoy. Not with his hands stained crimson as he tried to save a life rather than end it. Harry would not cry. There was no need.
“Maybe it would be best if we talked on our own, Mister Malfoy?” Dumbledore offered, ‘wasn’t that a brilliant idea’ Draco thought, forcing himself up into an almost sitting position. Dumbledore extended his hand as if to help him up. Draco only ignored it and rose gracefully to his feet. ‘It wasn't like a Malfoy to ever be anything but graceful’, his mother's voice spoke in the back of his mind from a distant memory of his childhood back when it was still decent. He shoved the intruding memory away as Dumbledore spoke again, “Mister Weasley, Miss Granger please return to the Gryffindor common room, I assure you, you will be the first to know of any news concerning young Harry.”
He sat up, heart hammering against his ribs trying to grasp onto the images he had seen the last image. The man pleading for the boy being tortured. Some idea to know who it was. He could tell someone about it. But the images were fading fast, leaving him with nothing but a sick feeling in his stomach.
“It seems young Malfoy is able to get into the lavatory where Harry was attacked,” Dumbledore said evenly. “I was hoping you could tell me how that's possible since he had no wand on him.”
As carefully as he could he laid Malfoy over top of his sheets. Then promptly collapsed against his dresser breathing heavily and probably jostling Hedwig in her cage. This was not the situation in which Harry wanted another boy in his sheets. The thought caught Harry off guard and he snorted not at all quietly. Hedwig hooted something akin to disapproval as if she could know of what he was thinking. She had a point, even if she didn’t know it. This was entirely not the time.
“Harry I assure you we won’t be sending him anywhere, Madam Pomfrey should be here by sunrise she’s coming early specifically to check on you two and he’ll be staying in the hospital wing until term begins.” Draco’s head was spinning, the whole room was spinning for that matter but he tightened his grip on the arm of the chair, trying to regain some calm. He would be staying here. That shouldn’t come with so much relief. That shouldn’t make him want to cry. That shouldn’t wait...
“Draco..?” the whisper was so desperate and questioning and pure. The boy closed his eyes at the same time that Draco sank to his knees soaking his knees in red. Soaking his knees in blood.
It wasn't long before sleep enveloped him, filling his head with nightmarish memories he'd rather forget.
Harry stared at his hands only now, noticing a smudge of red stain along his thumb where he had wiped it from Draco's nose. Harry's breath caught and he tried to rub the stain away however before he could get close he could hear movement in the house behind him. He went to stand and knock but his body was slow to listen, still half numb practically from the waist down. The door swung open before he could make himself move much.
“I don't know,” Draco answered. It was a rather large armchair, probably comfortable too. He couldn't imagine actually sitting on it in the state he was in. If it had been his mother's and he elected to sit on her furniture covered in blood.. he grimaced at the thought.
He didn’t care about the stain on his hands as he dug through his school trunk, tucked safely away in his closet. He was looking for a small sack gifted to him only a few months ago.
ATTENTION: if this feels familure it is because I messed up and posted my chapters out of order, previously this was posted as chapter five when it was supposed to be chapter Six, if you have come back to read because you've been notified of an update please go back a chapter and read the real chapter five, it will probably make this chapter make better sense. Thank you and I'm sorry.
“May I?” Dumbledore asked, Holding his wand in front of him, Horace must have known what Dumbeldore was asking, he nodded absently, and with a wave of Dumbledore's wand the broken pieces of the room started to slip back into place.
first of all, I am terribly sorry for the long wait this time. life is life it happens. i am very much hoping to be able to write more often in the next few weeks to bring you chapters faster.
“No, you don't know. You don't know and I don't know and none of this makes any fucking sense.” Draco was screaming. “I don't know what happened.” That wasn't quite true though, was it? He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harry Potter had slit his own wrists. What he couldn't understand, was why. “I don't know why this happened,” Draco said only slightly quieter than his previous screaming. He couldn't look up from the desk to see the pity in Dumbledore's eyes. He just couldn't. He didn't need to be pitied. He didn't want it. Without another word, he stalked out of the office. Paying no attention to the headmaster calling his name behind him.
Finally, he managed a grip on the handle tight enough to push it open. Thankful his uncle always forgot to lock the door, Harry above all else was not allowed a key. He used his hip to try and wipe away the one bloody fingerprint he’d left behind.
“Harry,” Hermione said, jumping up and smiling at him as if he didn't just walk in on everybody talking about him.
Draco picked up his pace nearing more of a jog than a walk, Harry had been in a coma for a week now but for some reason, it felt like Draco was watching the last few grains of sand drain out of an hourglass. He had done well to follow his gut over the past several days. They led him to find Harry, to the mirror, and now his gut was leading him to the hospital wing as if he was on one end of a rope being pulled. He had to hand it to Granger. She was very good at keeping up and seemed to sense his urgency, as they neared the hospital wing they both broke out into a dead sprint at the same time leaving Ron calling for them to wait up, behind them.
“You mean where he slit his arms open?” Draco sneered. He was tired of nobody opening there eyes and seeing the situation for what it really was. “Yeah, I opened the door and walked in. why has nobody bothered to clean up the mess?”
“I’m off Molly, I'll be home before you know it- oh dear” Harry twisted and looked at Mr. Weasly. He forced a smile.
“He cut himself with a broken piece of the mirror of Erised,” he said turning to Hermione, frantic to tell her the information she would need to save Harry before the two Aurors could take him away. He showered her the piece of glass in his hand before shoving it back into his pocket forcefully, feeling the edge bite into the skin on his finger. If anyone could save him surely it would be Hermione. The only witch to beat him out in grades.
Draco couldn’t for the life of him connect the dots that led him here. There were too many missing pieces, gaping holes, and fuzzy outlines of
This one was quite a bit taller than him and he had to forcefully throw the sheet in order to reveal what lay beneath it. It was a large mirror that his mother would have adored, and for good reason, it was beautifully made. Draco would have to blind not to see that. He glanced into the mirror for a second and saw his puffy face and immediately felt ashamed. But he was caught off guard when the picture started to change. That's when he realized what this was. The mirror of Erised. Draco didn't know if he wanted to see what the mirror would show him. He didn't know if he was ready.he wasn't sure why he felt that way but before he could question his own thought process he turned around and stalked angrily out of the room kicking the shaking trunk on his way past pretending that it didn't hurt his foot as bad as it did. He walked out into the hall and started towards the dungeons, to the Slytherin common room. He could hear voices bouncing around the corridors but they sounded far off. Draco ignored them but quickened his pace.
“It’s vital that you keep him safe this year” A voice whispered low and sharp. It made Harry uneasy. Before the voice could continue Harry rounded the corner.
No. He didn’t let himself think about the train or Hermione. Or anything that meant school was coming up soon. If he thought about it then he would miss it all the more. And if he missed it any more than he already did then he would never make it the last three weeks. He would never make it.
“Budleigh Babberton” Dumbledore said as if Harry was meant to know exactly where that is in the world. He was still regaining his bearings when Dumbledore took off, walking much too quickly for Harry at this time of night, reluctantly he hurried after the Headmaster. He was glad he had the forethought to bring his wand when he’d rushed to the hospital wing minutes earlier. He clutched it now in his right hand, surveying the empty darkness around them. Houses stood on either side of the street dark with the time of night. Each one of them had Harry on edge. Anything could be waiting here. Waiting for him.
“I am aware now of certain goings-on and I can assure you I would never put Harry here in any unnecessary danger. He is too important.” Draco seethed, what could make what Draco witnessed necessary? Nothing. “Mister Potter will be well taken care of and returned to the guardianship of his Aunt and Uncle who I will speak to about what is and isn't appropriate." Draco sneered his trademark sneer at the old man.
chapter seven this is it this is the seventh chapter far from the end were just really getting going now. lots and lots to come. tell me what your thinking friends.
A different door. A different man. A burn on his lip. Darkness and a curse. He was still looking at Harry. At a boy afraid.  He didn't know why, or how, but he understood at least the surface of what he was feeling.
“My knowledge of the mirror or Erised is quite limited im afraid” Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips. “Do you still have it?”
“No!” he exclaimed suddenly moving back a little. She looked offended and Draco quickly tried to cover it up. “No I mean, yes I'll sit down with you, I’ll do whatever I can to save him, just please don't heal anything else,” he said slowly. A good number of the doctors had looked up at his shout and he could feel a blush creeping up his neck.
‘Purifying’ that's what his father had said. Blood purity was the foundation of what the Dark Lord stood for. The foundation of what the Malfoys always believed. The foundation of what Draco believed. His father told him stories about how the heretic muggle lovers were being wiped out to put those with pure blood back on top where they always belonged.
“You alright mate?” Harry blinked only now remembering he wasn’t alone. He looked over and Ron was sitting on the edge of his bed across the room from him. He was dressed, must have woken up before, and let him rest. He was watching Harry expectantly.
The atmosphere in the great hall was suffocating. Nothing on the surface appeared out of place, it was only a sickening uneasy feeling that snaked through Draco's entire being. He couldn't place it, he couldn't figure out what made the air so thick. It was too much. Draco stood and fled the Hall, ignoring the questioning looks of his friends. Ignoring the stares of those who were not his friends. Ignoring the empty seat at the table across the hall. Ignoring all of this, because something somewhere was not right.
Today it looked like fire dancing across the horizon. He stood there a little longer watching the dark fade into the pale blue of morning. And then he turned around and started walking back. Not back to the Dursleys, but the park, at least until he was sure Uncle Vernon was gone for the day and he could sneak back into his room to find spare change enough to buy himself something to eat, or at least coffee to get him through wandering around the rest of the day.
He stood behind his chair, as did all the members in attendance. The room was loud with silence. Draco had come to hate silence. He kept his eyes down. He had to, it was the rules. And for the briefest of moments upon when they entered Draco swore he saw the Muggle Studies professor hovering over the stretched out table.
“No it really isn’t” Harry was sure he must be glaring at the man. He wasn’t paying enough attention to notice and Harry tried to gain control of his face before he decided to look his way again. He still didn't know why Dumbledore thought he could help but he wasn't about to mess it up by letting the man know he didn't like him much.
Harry liked the park this early, and when it was late at night. Those were the times that he would be at least mostly alone. Children didn’t wake early and weren’t out late, at least not the kids that actually enjoyed the park for playing. And if he were to be seen here by his uncle, or Dudley, well they were all too focused on their image to do anything to him here, in plain view of the nicer houses across the field. Houses much too nice for Vernon to afford. Harry snorted at the thought of Vernon confronting him here.
“Your mother was a muggle-born, you know. Truly was a shock when I found out, though she must have been a pureblood she was so good.”
The inside of the house was in a total state of devastation. The furniture that was probably once quite nice, was splintered and scattered across the floor. A chandelier lay where it had fallen from the ceiling in a puddle of crystal sand. Stuffing bled from ripped open cushions and pages torn from books littered the ground. Dumbledore whispered a spell and held his wand above the mess, light shone from the point of his wand, and the wreckage of the home was made even clearer. Harry followed Dumbeldore deeper into the room. There was a stain on the floor, dark and red. The sight reminded Harry of the chaos they left behind.
“He goes out a lot, for meetings that he tells nobody of, in a location that is kept secret. He works closely with Umbridge and used to work under Lucious.” Mr. Weasly was still talking, but Harry was in his dream again. Lucious. Of course, it was Lucious, the one who told Voldemort to stop, the one who was sitting across from him at the table. He was begging, in the last dream, Lucious was begging Voldemort to reconsider, begging him to change his mind. It was Lucious he was seeing.
A boy a little shorter than himself was leaning against the side of the stall. His raven hair fell in his eyes and a pair of glasses lay abandoned next to him. None of this is what broke Draco down in ways he didn't think possible. No, it was the red. Red poured out of and around the nastiest looking gashes Draco had ever seen on anyone's arms. Draco stood there for way too long.
Missing a few, Harry corrected his thoughts as he discarded the now-useless towel on the floor in favor for a clean one.
“I deserved it trust me”He wanted to tell her he deserved it for not getting Harry here quick enough, for hesitating rather than bringing him straight here for being so horribly cold to him for the past seven years he wanted to tell her it would never be enough to punish him if the boy didn't live.  “Can we go to your office now?”  he asked siding off the bed and glancing around at all the people. Madam Pomfrey looked at him with pity in her eyes. He hated pity, but bit back the bitter taste of it and looked towards her office.
“Come come in” Mr. Weasly ushered him inside instead of leaving for work as he was doing previously. “Molly we have a guest” Harry felt every bit that he was intruding.
“Except for the Malfoys,” the Dark Lord said, almost as an afterthought. Draco felt cold as he stood there. He wanted to look to his father for help but he didn’t, instead, he stood there beside his father and his mother next to him, waiting. “Oh forgive me, the elder of the Malfoys. Draco may go.” He stood there a second too long, hesitation was a sign of weakness. He tried to cover it up by bending slightly in a bow.
When he wakes up Harry is not there but someone else not identified is and they use a muggle shot to put him back into the coma
Light broke in the sky ahead of him and Harry stopped walking. He was already sweaty again. He wasn’t sure how long that means he’s been walking but the sun was finally coming up. Peeking over the buildings ahead. The darkness receding against the burst of warm colors. Harry liked watching the sunrise. It looked different almost every morning from almost every place.
“I need to get this to Albus,” she said urgently examining the piece of glass as she stood and faced the door of her office.
When Dumbledore poked his wand into the cushion of an armchair, which promptly sprang up and into a man.
Draco stared at his hands, but they didn't look like his hands. They were stained with thick red and the sight made his stomach churn. An urgent conversation was going on around him and he knew most of it was questions for him, but he could only look at his hands, clenching and unclenching his fists. He started to scratch at his skin, he wanted the stains to go away, to disappear. He wanted it all to disappear.
“And he will, but I’m afraid in the case of mister Potter he really does need to return.” Draco was looking at Potter already when Dumbledore said this. He could see Potter shrinking in on himself. He could see his
He thought briefly about going to visit Harry in the hospital wing but immediately disregarded that idea. He felt sure he'd be barred from entering and sent straight back to his room. Draco growled remembering when he went back to talk to Dumbledore the day after. He told him everything that happened, everything he saw. It didn't matter what Draco had to say. Dumbledore, like everyone else in this hellhole, already knew what must have happened. Draco had asked to see him and the headmaster shut him down, took his wand and sent him to the Slytherin common room. That was the last conversation he has had with anyone save Blaise.
“I had a feeling that might of been the case, even tried to voice the option to Albus but he didn't go for it, Said it couldn't be true.” Draco looked around spotting a tissue box across the room and stood to get it, offering it to her she smiled and took a tissue “please go on mister Malfoy.”
“Something funny to you?” The lapdog made a noise that almost sounded like a growl, pulling a chuckle from Draco's throat.
that being said this is another short chapter look for chapter fifteen soon! and I hope you enjoy it! lert me know what you think!
He had no plan. He hadn’t stopped to think about what he was doing in the slightest. He knew he could do nothing to stop the Headmaster if it came down to it. He knew he shouldn’t. In a way he knew where Potter lived, He might not know the address but he had been there, he had seen inside with his own eyes. Having been there, seeing it, he knew he would be able to apparate back, to lead the Dark Lord… Draco swallowed the thought down like bile.
Draco sat, stiffly. He made a mental note to pull his shoulders back and keep his chin up. He was a Malfoy and he needed to look it, especially here.
The scene played out in his head again. As it would on an endless loop forever, or at least in the foreseeable future.
The Dark Lord was testing him, A test he would have to pass or fail. To pass would mean to live, but to live in service of the Dark Lord. To fail would mean to make his own choices, be his own person, be free. But to fail would also mean to die. So where was the choice?
He could see was white hair and claws reaching for him. Wrapping arms around him. Pulling him back and down into an icy abyss.
