“It- It stings.” Harry sharply said through breaths.
“Oh, I sure will.” Draco laughs and heads out of the door.
With only a few plans on today, Draco finds himself in the library. His finished letter to Celeste is sitting on his knee, but Draco has no effort to send it off. Instead he listens to the steady beating of rain, glad that he was inside.
Harry couldn’t take one more second of her whining and was about to shatter his glass of water in anger but before he could do so, Hermione and Ron walked in.
Draco smiled, and his eyes softened.
The chapel is open to anyone that resides in the castle, but Draco finds its empty today. Maybe the delay was a good thing. It means there’s less people to talk to.
“Why all these questions about Celeste?”
Draco braced himself for disaster. “You might want to step back, I’m really horrible at this.” Harry did as was bid, and watched as Draco swung his arm back and propelled the pebble into the air. It splashed against the surface, and sunk with a glug.
“Fuck.” Harry says, breathing heavily with his back on the mattress. Draco feels completely boneless, and it takes everything in him to lift himself up and off Harry and swing his leg over so that he’s lying next to him.
Harry grimaces with something akin to sympathy.
Harry laughs and allows Draco to pull him closer.
“No...no, it’s okay.” He replies, planting a kiss on the problem hip and resting his head there.
“So, where is she now?”
The gazing into Harry’s eyes is quickly interrupted by something warm and solid touching Draco’s half hard cock. He looks down to his lap to find Harry’s tanned and strong hands palming his bulge, and he can’t help but moan with pleasure. This was all happening so quickly for Draco, it only felt like a couple hours since they first kissed. The night before had appeared back into Draco’s mind, and he couldn’t help but smile. Maybe this was what Draco needed after months of being completely and utterly infatuated with stupid Sir Potter without knowing it. Well, he knew it, but he desperately tried to avoid it.

“Hey! Put me down!” Draco shouts, writhing. Harry pulls him up and turns him so that he is almost bridal style carrying Draco. Before Draco can drop down, he throws his arms around Harry’s shoulders, hauling himself up.
“My outfit for the ball. Do you approve?” Draco says, swishing the cape.
He finds it hard to leave the peaceful warmth of the room, but things have happened too fast for him to process, and before he can try anything else, all he needs is a little rest.
“Potter, the ball is in two days and you’re telling me now that you can’t dance? You can’t be saved, you’ll just have to make a fool of yourself.” Draco smirks and shrugs his shoulders cheekily.
“I am sitting right here.” Draco tutted.
“What, your damaged hip?” Draco asks, confused.
“It...fell out.” He tries, looking at Harry and trying not giggle.
When Harry smiles at him, Draco feels safe. Protected from the evils of the world.
“Ah great, I’ll go. See you tomorrow.” Harry replied and left.
Draco went to bed that night with the words ‘Are you happy?’ ringing loudly in his ear.
“Night, Draco.” Harry says quietly, closing the door before Draco can respond.
He’s only just remembered, realised. Adelaide had told him he’d be proud of himself when the sky turns pink, but he’d never really believed her.
Regaining his composure, Draco makes his way over to a plush red sofa that sinks deeply once he sits down on it. Harry slots himself next to it, making easy conversation with people who are hardly listening.
“Great, great!” He said, pulling a stool from across the room next to the canvas. “Sit, Sir, pass paint and get water.”
“Not much.” Draco shrugged, although it wasn’t something he could brush off as if it meant nothing.
Thank you for reading!
“Fantastic.” Harry says with finality, leaning forward and capturing Draco’s lips in his own.
“What does it say?” Harry asks, squinting at the small writing.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry.” Draco replies earnestly, but he also wishes he could go back to that feeling last night. Harry calling him hot was not unwelcome. “I understand.” Is all he can say, because the thought of never doing what he wants to do with this man hurts.
The front of the shop was empty, and Harry and Draco managed to get from the building to behind the tavern without being seen.
“Alright, Ada. Any letters?” Draco sighed, running his hand through his wet hair.
“Well I’m sure it had a name, it’s not actually my lake. I bet you there’s a book about it in the castles main library.”
Harry swears angrily and opens his eyes, trying to focus on anything but the searing pain in his hip.
Adelaide looks stunned.
Before he enters the grand doors, he applies his ‘Prince Draco’ facade. A grand smile, proper royal etiquette, the likes of what he’s been brought up with.
Harry Potter. His name was almost too good to say. As if the charm would wear off if he abused it.
“Harry!” Draco screams, feeling his clothes soak through immediately. Harry’s doubled over in laughter. Draco had fallen victim to another one of his pranks.
“Pansy,” Malfoy sighed “I’m not in the mood.”
“Oh, she’s not? Why don’t you go marry her then!” Harry smiles, and then it falters and turns into a pitiful grimace. “Sorry.”
Professor Pomfrey had come in 10 minutes after Harry had woken up, and at her arrival, Draco woke up too.
“Appreciate the easy work, Potter. Won’t be long until he starts asking you to braid his hair.” Draco smirked, diverting his gaze from the fire to Harry.
“Let me finish, Draco. You only have three years until you marry Celeste, and I know you’re dreading that but then you’ll be free from your parents. They’ll see you as a man instead of a boy.”
“Tournament?” Harry asks, his face lighting up.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry shruggs, but immediately regretted it as the searing pain returned to his hip.
Draco shakes his head but his smile is growing deeper.
“You’d better close that window before you get a cold, Draco.” Adelaide said to him later that night, finding him in the same position on his bed that she had left him in.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco said, slightly taken aback, as Harry turned into the cobbled street. Draco quickly scuttled behind him, keeping his head held low and trying to keep his expensive clothes covered.
(ps, please let me know if you are enjoying this by leaving a comment!)
“I-“ Draco started, but hesitated when he thought it about it further. He wasn’t so concerned about the fact that he might get caught, but it was more about the fact of adventuring outside with Harry.
“Do tell me, Sir Potter, at how you became a Knight so young. Does your Father work in that field too?” Lucius asks, raising an eyebrow in question.
“Bloody hell mate.” Ron said, a concerned look on his face. He sat at the end of the hospital bed, the morning sun peeking through the misted windows of the infirmary.
“Yeah.” Says Harry, biting his lip. He cracks a large, sheepish grin and waits for Draco’s response.
“What’s so funny?” Draco asked, a grin on his face.
“Yeah, he’s given me an open invitation for breakfast whenever I want it.” Harry shrugged. “But he always ends up persuading me to join him in hunting.”
A small flicker of a smile. A sense of family loyalty.
Harry settles himself in the far corner of the sofa, allowing Draco to rest his legs on his lap. He ought to get a bigger chair...
“I don’t know.” Draco replies truthfully. “But I think we can figure it out.”
Draco kicks a pile of snow in Harry’s direction, sniggering as little flecks of ice land on Harry’s face.
“What?!” Harry replies. “Draco’s beat you all so many times!”
He shakes his head at himself, walking back to Juliet and jumping back on.
Draco hauled himself off the couch and made his way to the door. He cracked it open and there stood Harry Potter, biting his lip and projecting innocence through his eyes.
“Night, friend.” Harry laughed.
Harry walks Draco back to his rooms, and they part with a tight hug that’s far too long and far too close. Not that Draco minds.
“Ah, Draco. Where have you been?” Narcissa ushers Draco in as he stands at the door of the solar room. The room is covered in square wood panels and had large muntin bar windows across one side of the room. There was a large oak wood bench in the middle, with candles running all the way down and three drinks sitting on the edge. At the table, sat Lucius Malfoy and Sir Harry Potter.
Draco just rolled his eyes.
find me on tumblr @ferretboyandpotty <3
“Brilliant.” Harry replied, agitated. Hearing Parkinson talk for 10 minutes had already set him off and he didn’t want the next two weeks to be the same.
He’s in a relationship with Harry. Harry Potter the knight. Sir Potter. He feels his lips against his own, his hand in his, lingering and strong. Touching him, caressing him. Harry doing the same.
“You’re not the only one that stays up at night, you know.” Malfoy said, seeming sincere.
Draco has found himself smiling at the other knights as they pass, and he’s always surprised to find them smiling back.
“You have to let me! I thought this was just a book you had bought! Draco, from what I’ve read so far it’s great!” Harry looks at him with such honesty that Draco breaks out into grin.
Draco was just about to ask a question about the way he should position his feet before the sound of charging horses came his way. Through the thick group of trees, Draco could faintly see his father and a group of 5 other men, probably his most respected Knights, heading this way. The was a deer just a few feet in front of them, running for its life.
“Yeah.” Draco called back, turning to see Harry behind him, his curly black hair flapping wildly behind him. The castle was near in sight and Draco lead them secretly to the stables, depositing Juliet.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows at the change of conversation, but eased his face at the compliment.
When Pierre announced that he only needed ten more minutes of his time, Harry began to circle around the small anteroom of the gallery, and perched on a large windowsill, letting the glass cast beautiful hues of light around him. Draco wanted this image into his own canvas, if only he had the talent to capture the spectacle that was Harry Potter.
“And you’d be abandoning your date.” Draco says, sounding accusing but not meaning to.
“Together.” Harry repeats with a nod. “I know that now we’re together, we’re going to have to keep a lot of secrets. And I know that you’ll have to convince your parents that you’re in love with Celeste, and whatever happens between you and her tonight doesn’t bother me. I know you have to do it.”
He’s very much enjoying, actually. He makes it known, too.
“Are you alright?”
“What did you do then, Sir Harry? I saw it was your day off.” Lucius said, pushing his wooden bowl forward so that a maid could fill it with mushroom soup. It looked that a brown mush, but as Draco got his serving and had tried it, the mushrooms burst in his mouth, and it was deliciously salty.
The hall started to fill up even more, and all Harry could hear was excited whispers and cheering.
Draco rolled his eyes. He could either suck it up and have a shower or smell for the rest of his time there. “Fine.”
“Let’s not go back.” Draco groans, leaning his head back onto Harry’s chest and looking up into his eyes.
“I have somewhere to be later.” Draco says to Harry as Edward shuffles the cards humbly.
Sadly we have come to an end with Kiss it Better. I really hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I loved writing it!
Juliet taps her wet nose onto Draco’s resting forearm, and lets out a deep sigh
“Harry?” He says frantically, sitting up and manoeuvring himself around to face the trembling man.
He’s almost about to turn away, not really caring for whatever they were doing. Harry catches his arm before he can even think about it, and pushes him through the doorway by the small of his back. Draco tries to focus as he steps in.
Ron froze and turned. “What the FUCK do you think you’re doing. I don’t even want to start with you.” Ron walked up to where Malfoy lay and picked up a fist. But before he could even swing back, Hermione had put a stupefy on him and he fell to the floor.
“I just...Draco. I don’t want what I told you to make you feel uncomfortable, because you’re honestly one of my closest friends. And I know you said it doesn’t change what you think about me but with what’s going on with you and Celeste I... I don’t know.”
“It’s your middle name though, isn’t it?”
“Never learn, boy. Eighteen years, still always moving out of place. Does not do well for my art, eh?”
Juliet whines and huffs as Draco unlatches the door and unwinds the rope hung loosely around her neck.
“You’ll give yourself a headache if you do that anymore.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Manners, Draco, manners.” Harry said after he calmed down from his laughing fit.
He’s trying not to think right now. It might make it all worse.
“That wasn’t what I was expecting, though. I thought you would have told me about a maiden who you dated when you were fifteen that broke up with you over letter.”
“God I wish, imagine my fathers face.”
Draco rubs his hands over his face and sighs deeply. The thought of his parents fills him with dread. All these problems he has, half of them would be gone if they hadn’t controlled his life and decisions.
Adelaide promptly exits, and Draco stares at the clothes. His stomach is churning unpleasantly, and his head feels as though it might float off his body.
“So this is Celeste.” Harry said.
“You should have a rest...I’ll just...” He goes for the door, but stops when Draco calls out to him.
“Sir Potter.” Sebastian says in a drawl, raising a lazy eyebrow.
“Fine.” Harry scowls, but a small smile appears on his lips. His face was beggining to grow pinker, too.
I hope you enjoy! <3
He hides behind a wide oak tree, peering around and watching as the knights head towards the stables. He can’t see Harry in the group, no raven black hair or bright eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Miss Granger. Although Mr Weasley seemed to have a different opinion on me when I first arrived here.”
“Ah, Draco. I thought you were Lucius.” He let out on a sigh.
“I should have just left you alone the first time you pushed me away.” He shrugged. Now Draco felt guilty.
“Oh something about Cadogen, Draco. You’ve got a letter there.” Lucius says with a snark, his smile turned downwards at Draco’s presence.
“Harry!” A ginger man called out, before enveloping Harry into a welcoming hug.
Suddenly, Draco’s put in Harry’s shoes, coming out to someone and not knowing how they’d react. Although Draco had only been hours into his realisation, he feels like he’s known all his life.
Harry’s about to say something, but then it seems like he’s become aware of his surroundings, and catches sight of something on the bedside table.
Draco guides them both down, carful not to trip and make a fool of himself. He sweeps his eyes over the crowd, noting pleased faces. His eyes catch on one particular face, though.
Draco brushed away the crumps and sulked, feeling slightly embarrassed.
“Draco, please turn around.” Harry pleaded, needing to see Draco’s face.
“Ada.” Draco groaned.
“Oh trust me, he is. But he hardly comes up here.” Draco shrugs.
Draco just shrugs innocently and hides his face behind the glass. Ah, fuck it. He takes a sip.
“Yeah, it’s great.” He nods. He doesn’t actually mind it.
“That was the most boring shit I’ve ever sat through.” Harry says as he pushes Draco against his closed bedroom door an hour later.
“What happened earlier?”
“Come in.” Draco mumbles, straightening his back and putting the quill into the ink.
front of him.
There was no doubt that Harry was faster than Draco, what with all his Knight training, and so Draco had to run especially fast if he had any hopes of getting Harry back.
‘Draco’s sneaking out cloak.’
“He did?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well for you they are.” He concedes, tying up the string on the front of the ghillie shirt and turning around, finding Harry staring directly at...well directly at his cock. Draco forces the blush away and Harry’s eyes meet his face again, coughing and righting himself. He helps Draco carry the tailored clothes and passes them over to Adelaide as delicately as Draco has ever seen him.
Draco freezes on the spot as he feels a large splattering of snow on the back of his neck.
“Of course. You don’t want to leave it too late though, Sir. Draco here is already engaged.” Lucius says, and directs his attention to Draco, who is picking around his food with his fork.
“But you won’t understand. It’s so stupid. And unfair.” He shakes his head in anger.
“You really want to be in it?” Draco asked, surprised. He knew Harry had always got into shit against his will, and he didn’t know why Harry would willingly enter himself under his own accord. He felt a kind of relief at knowing that Harry was too young. If he died, he wouldn’t have someone to poke around and annoy.
‘Have fun.’ He thought to himself. The voice in his head sounded a lot like Adelaide, and he decided if he wasn’t going to enjoy the trip out, at least it will make Adelaide happy that he’s living his life by his own rules.
“Let me be the judge of that.” Adelaide laughs and makes her way out of Draco’s room.
He turned his body around so he was laying on his side and closed his eyes. The next two weeks would be spent sleeping and waiting until he got back on his broom.
“Yes?” Adelaide appears at the door, her hands clutched around the fabric of her dress.
“I need to get my sword fixed and sharpened.” He stated.
“No, no it’s alright. You were honest with me so I have to be honest with you.” He looks away.
Draco’s heart thrums and he picks up his speed, entering through the door and finding himself pushed against it once it’s closed.
“Harry, all the things I said last night were true. And you don’t need to worry about me, I’ve long come to terms with it.”
Harry wanted to sit up and ask why Malfoy was pretending to be him, probably to make fun of him, but as he was about to get up his body protested and thought that maybe it was a good idea to stay silent.
“Oh dear lord...” He says, not knowing if he wants to moan or groan.
“Spectacular.”
“Okay there’s none of your Father’s Knights here, but- bloody hell pull that down.” Harry scoffed, looking at Draco’s uncovered face.
He smiled, looking around. And then he saw Draco. He had missed his face, even though it had only been a couple days since he had seen him last. His eyes were red and strained and his posture was slouched as he sat down on the opposite side of the hall to harry. He looked up, saw Harry and held his head low.
“What if Harry liked you back?”
Draco stepped back from the contact to peer around the building that Harry had hidden them behind. “What are you-“ Draco started loudly, but Harry quickly interrupted.
“We can take it one day at a time, together, yeah?”
“Again, that’s not what I do.”
“Hmm... I don’t know if I can.” Harry smirks. The white snow settles on Harry’s eyelashes, making his eyes glisten. Merlin, he is gorgeous.
He rummages through his wardrobe, finding the gift and bringing it over. This time, he leans against the headboard and lets Harry settle comfortably next to him.
“Yes?” Draco calls, sitting up in his bed. The firelight reflects on Harry perfectly, casting shadows of orange light that sharpen his jawline.
“I need to get dressed for dinner.” He says into the calm air, wanting to elicit a response out of a very silent Harry. He’s worried, just for a second, that Harry is completely disgusted, and so he turns to look at him. If his wide smile and flushed face was anything to go by, Draco thinks he’s done pretty good.
seeing that everyone has gathered around the circular table to spectate. A blonde, curly haired knight who he can only guess was Nick volunteered to go first, and Draco smirked.
Harry relaxed against Draco’s touch, and now he was glad he couldn’t get out of bed. Because he wanted to lay here forever.
He took Draco’s hand and sighed. This was exactly where Harry wanted to be. Nothing could stop him, he had no worries. As long as Draco was beside him, he knew everything was going to be alright.
Harry woke up feeling refreshed. He cheerfully put his glasses on and summoned a house elf to get his favourite breakfast. He could get used to staying in the infirmary 24/7.
Adelaide walks with him until they reach the entrance hall, and the bite of the winter night sends a horrendous chill down his spine.
“I’ve got to get back. Royal duties and everything.” He grimaced. Taking the bag and flipping the hood onto his head.
Religious or not, he still bloody hates Christmas.
“I’ve got to go write this letter to Celeste, now. That was the main reason why I was on my way there in the first place. Peace and quiet.”
Draco snorted when Pierre compared them to ‘a very sick frog’, earning another “Sit still”.
“I’m cold.” He grumbles, stepping over the hilly rocks.
The world seemed to stop as Draco felt release. His breathing quickened and that only surged him harder into the air. His black cloak flailed behind him and he felt freedom. Like he couldn’t be slowed. Nothing could stop him now. The wind whistled in his ears and his heart jolted against the movement of the run.
“Harry...you’re wearing my shirt.”
“But I don’t understand why on earth would you want to do that. My life is boring, Potter.” Draco shrugged.
“Well that wasn’t so hard, was it?”
Lake James is completely frosted over, and the moonlight blurs on the surface. He hops off Juliet, crunching over the ground to get on an icy rock. He hasn’t done this for a while. Just sitting broodily and reflecting. Juliet lays next to him and provides warmth amidst the chill.
“It’s a crime, Adelaide! A crime punishable by death on my fathers account.”
He’s not stalking, he’s just...checking up on Harry.
“Believe me, Harry, I don’t want to do this as much as you don’t want me to. And you’re certainly right.” He picks up Harry’s hand, playing with his fingers. “But besides, I’ll see you there, won’t I? It’s not like we’re forbidden to speak to each other, everyone knows we’re friends.”
“What about you middle name?”
Harry catches his eye. “We’re just two troubled men with horrible love life’s.” He says so quietly that it’s almost a whisper.
“What is it?” He asks cautiously, noticing a  grand smile on her face.
“Shush, Draco. Yes I’m upset that my parents died and yes, I was never given a life of luxuries, but it’s not something I can change. I don’t want you feeling bad, or thinking your struggles aren’t valid.” Harry says with such honesty and compassion that Draco’s heart hurts.
After finishing breakfast, that was interrupted by countless questions thrown at Lucius, Draco runs to the small gates to the right of the castle and finds Ron and Hermione.
“You’re not completely wrong there.” Draco pointed out.
He had some balls to be walking around the castle looking so, unpleasant, but Lucius didn’t seem to mind. Not one bit. He smiled through his mouthfuls of bread and nodded thoughtfully at his words. Well, Harry sure had earned his respect pretty quickly.
“Well then what?”
“Some of us aren’t naturally gifted.” Draco replies sternly, crossing his arms and feeling childish. He has to stop himself from stamping his foot.
“Because of you! Every five bloody minutes you were jolting around in your bed and shouting about Merlin knows what.” Draco spat. The anger caused his perfect outside mask slip, and his hair had hung over his face instead of being neatly parted to the side.
“Where are you off to, Draco? You can’t just leave when guests are present.” Lucius demands, turning from his seat.
Harry steps in and shuts the door behind him.
And now, Harry and Draco are treading through the snow to reach Lake James. It’s the first time they’ve spent more than a minute together in a while.
“Your dad’s being a right arse, did you know that?” Harry grimaces.
“Ron!” Draco calls, grabbing the attention of Ron and then seconds after, Hermione.
Harry just stared at Draco, something scarily close to a sort of affection, and smiled. Something so genuine and pure.
“We can swap. I’ll take the role of the man and you the women, and then we swap so that you can understand how it goes.”
“Then wear a cloak.”
He doesn’t know how long that’ll work.
“Merry Christmas, Draco!” She says with alacrity, coming to his bedside and shaking him. Adelaide has always loved Christmas.
Harry turns and flashes a smile. “Oh it wasn’t too important. Sorry to take time out of your ‘busy day’” He smirks.
“Come outside?” Is the response, and Draco doesn’t have to think twice.
“Bloody annoying Knight.” Draco mumbles quietly in his hand, which causes a faint laugh to sound from the man next to him. Lucius and Narcissa carry on eating, oblivious to Draco’s annoyance.
I couldn’t help myself and immediately began writing chapter 2 as soon as I woke up.
“Sorry.” He says, eyes cast downwards.
I’m on a roll with chapters, this is my third one and I released chapter 1 exactly 24 hours ago! Let’s hope my motivation will stay like this haha.
Draco apologises from under his breath and follows his Father and another back to the castle. Draco is intent on searching for Harry, but as he makes his way up to his room and finds a steaming goblet of something warm next to his bed, he can’t help but lay down and have a rest. His eyes begin to close soon after.
“I don’t scold people. I just tell it how it is. And I do have people to talk to.”
something to keep his mind off the impending ball.
Draco walked out of the alcove, sighing heavily in relief. Harry looked back at him, and they both collapsed in laughter.
“I think I like Harry Potter.” He whispers.
“I know.” Harry batted his hand around Draco’s general area, brushing his remark off. Draco sent Harry a glare and Harry snorted, watching Draco look distastefully around the house.
“You.” Harry said with a smile.
She knocks at the door, laughing at a comment Harry had made while doing so.
“That was blasphemy, what you did back there.” Draco says, running his hands up and down Harry’s back as Harry nips at his neck.
Draco ran his hands through his hair and wiped the sweat from his forehead, the mid-august heat still humidifying the calm night.
“What is Harry doing in your bed? What happened to never telling him!” She looks around, alarmed.
“Fuck, that’s embarrassing.” Harry says into his hands, scrubbing at his face. Draco sighs heavily into his skin, relishing the warmth on his now cold body.
“But- But Harry!” Ron exclaimed, his eyes darting between Harry and Draco. “He- He’s the bloody Prince! You don’t ask the Prince to come with you to pick up a new sword!” Ron breathed, looking and sounding lightheaded.
The blood was rushing so hard in Draco’s ears that he couldn’t hear anything at all, until the sound of a small chuckles broke through the silence. Harry was laughing at the portrait of Draco at sixteen, when Pierre made him sit for so long that he though his arse was going to fall off, it was obvious in his face that he was uncomfortable, but he refused to have another one done until the next year. He was so unbelievably stroppy at that age.
His thoughts stop, and he realises with a sigh that he’ll never make Harry happy. He could never fulfil Harry’s hopes and dreams, because he had too many responsibilities. He leaned in and pressed his forehead to Harry’s, and when Harry leaned in to try and kiss him, Draco drew back. He wanted to apologise, but it was stupid. It was all his stupid fault because he couldn’t make up his stupid mind to risk everything for stupid Harry Potter. Not that Harry was stupid, god he was brilliant, but Draco’s parents were stupid and the castle was stupid and societal norms were stupid. And that made Draco stupid. And it didn’t help that he really likes Harry Potter. And that’s why he cant kiss him. It’s all too confusing for Draco and he feels a headache start up. He looks back at Harry, who’s face is sullen.
“God, I’m such a twat. Here I am complaining about my parents and having money, yet you haven’t lived a life as privileged. I really do hate my father. Here I am at it again!”
“Are you sure?” Draco replied, lifting an eyebrow cautiously.
From the corner of his eye, he can see Celeste’s ring glimmering proudly on her hand. Looking at his own has been unbearable recently, but he always knows it’s there.
“Well, because we’re friends?” He says, raising his eyebrows in hope.
“There’s no need, Ron.” Draco said, holding his hand out for Ron to shake. Ron took it almost immediately, smiling greatly as he did so. Draco turned to Hermione and did the same.
“I like Harry Potter.”
“Why didn’t you?” Draco said faintly, taken aback by the notion.
“At your absence, Sir Potter was telling us about his quests and battles. You’re the same age and you have yet to accomplish anything whereas Sir Potter has achieved more at his age than some of our oldest Knights have in their lifetime.”
Harry lifts his head back from the dip between Draco’s neck and shoulder, and Draco knows. He can see it in the greens of his eyes and the way his lips twitch in need for something. Something that Draco’s neck or mouth can’t provide.
“Morning.” Draco says, stretching sleepily on the bed, pressing his palms into his eyes. Harry must’ve left the Weasley’s shop early in the morning. The thought that he might have come back so soon just to see him makes his smile wider.
“Yeah, she’ll be arriving soon.”
“I promise.” Harry softly said, and leaned forward.
Draco jumped on top of Juliet, pulled his cloak so that it covered his clothes, and made his way to the secret path that led to the beach.
“Got all that?” Adelaide says.
Hey there, Reader!
“I wish I could be someone else.” He groans.
Harry just rolled his eyes. “But there’s still people who are mad. So I am much safer in the castle then being anywhere else. I’m glad for it, though.”
“How’s it going with Celeste?” Harry asks as they make their way back, detouring slightly so that they can stroll through the gardens.
Harry went into the great hall for dinner that night, and saw Draco immediately. His hair was tousled and rough and there were growing dark bags under his eyes. Harry thought that maybe Draco wasn’t getting any sleep either.
“Yes, Father.” Draco nods obligingly.
Draco inhales deeply and nods slowly. He’s tired of his game now, and Harry seemed persistent.
“Hey, Jules.” Draco whispers, even though he is the furthest away from the castle that he could get without passing through the large iron gates.
“Philosophical as always, Ada.”
Draco rolled his eyes and skipped over Harry’s rambling.
“I mean they aren’t wrong.” Harry laughed, picking up his books. He shot a smirk at Draco but could see he wasn’t taking it as a joke. Never once has he felt bad about hurting Draco, but now his heart hurts when he sees Draco so upset.
“I suppose you won all the ones in your training.”
“You don’t understand, Ada. There’s nothing I can do.”
“Stop moving!” Draco exclaims and twists open the lid of a jar of salve. He scoops two fingers into the jar and breaths in as the cool cream surrounds his fingers. He puts the jar onto his bedside table and turns back towards Harry’s body. He scrunches up his face as his fingers draw closer to Harry’s hip.
see him. It’s a bit surreal, seeing the person he’s been sending letters to for the past nine years.
Draco groans, bringing his hands up to cover his face. “God this is so embarrassing, I can’t even skip a stone!”
“You’re not an ungrateful snob, Draco.” Harry relies softly, turning his head to look at Draco. Draco is looking right back. “It makes sense. All of it, really.”
Draco contemplated what to do with the letter. What if it was dangerous? Draco doesn’t want Harry hurt. Not now.
Draco woke up early the next morning. He dreaded leaving the bed, knowing what the day was to bring. From his diamond paned window he could see crowds already gathering outside the castle, trailing all the way down the towering stone stairs and through the iron gates.
“Surprise.” Harry awkwardly laughed.
“...we can swap.” He finishes.
“Hold still, boy, I am not finished.” Pierre demanded. And so Draco held still for three hours. And Harry did not move one step. Pierre seemed to like Harry, showing him the progress, pointing to the different shades of green with enthusiasm, noting loudly once every couple of minutes that: “Green like your eyes, Sir. Like...er...peas.”. Pierre managed to associate the colour of Harry’s eyes to practically everything that was green.
“Draco- I didn’t. I don’t know how I was picked.” Harry exclaimed, trying to get Draco to understand.
“I think we should take it to a publisher.” Harry says, stroking the back of his hand.
And then he actually found the meaning for them in the shape of a handsome, strong-willed man.
“Nah, just into town, their house on the outskirts is too small so we’re having a party in their shop.”
It’s been a long time coming for this, and now Draco’s trying hard to drink it all in. There’s so much of Harry, more than his lean body and unruly hair.
Draco thought at that moment that Harry would probably love his lake. He could share another one of his private spots with Harry. He sort of felt like Harry deserved some place where he could rest, because knowing Lucius, he must wear Harry out with all his tasks.
Harry’s back, along with his father.
Harry didn’t know what to do with himself, he tried to crack his back but searing pain shot through his chest at each attempt. After twiddling his fingers for what felt like forever, his ears had latched on to the sound of Draco’s snores. They were soft and delicate, being a complete juxtaposition to his normal harsh tongue and loud wailing. He doesn’t know how Draco is still sleeping, as he was in the infirmary nearly as much as Harry was.
“Well luckily you did and Cadogen found you, who knows where you’d be if that didn’t happen.” Ron said, shrugging his shoulders and giving Harry a warm smile.
“What’s his Mistress’s name?” Harry asks Narcissa, noticing Draco’s disinterest in the conversation.
“Wow.” Harry breathed out. Draco guessed he had gotten used to the sight by now, and he realises just how much he doesn’t pay attention to things when there are other and greater problems to deal with in his life.
“I’ll break all of your bones. I’ll make sure you are permanently in the bed, sulking and whining so that you get the attention that you most definitely do not deserve. Harry’s already in a lot of pain and I don’t want you giving him a hard time.” Ron stepped even further towards Draco.
“Yes, Sire?” Harry replied politely, slightly out of breath.
“You wish, you oaf. And trust me, it’s better to just be quiet then face the Kings wrath.”
Draco’s stomach rumbles, and he becomes aware of the time. Breakfast opposite the man he hated. Fantastic.
“Prince Draco!” Ron exclaimed as he looked up after hearing the door shut.
There could have been a time when Draco liked it all, as a toddler who’s excitement was all-consuming. He can’t remember, though, and he supposes it couldn’t have been that good if he doesn’t.
“It’s just annoying. I’m given this chance of happiness, given wealth and provide safety and I don’t want any of it. It makes me sound like an ungrateful snob.”
“Well, you have plenty of other Knights to talk to. Look, here’s one now. Arthur!” Draco called, spotting a tall blonde Knight walk past the outside sitting area.
“My hair?” Draco says, thinking that it was pleasant enough.
“Absolutely...” Another yawn. “Not.”
“I know what happened that day, I remember Ada telling me about it. Everyone was happy, including my Father. Was the reason why you came to my castle because you wanted safety?”
“And you didn’t care to knock? You scared me, I thought you were my father.”
“What?” He says, amused but also slightly concerned.
“Harry Potter.” Dumbledore announced again, staring directly at Harry now.
“My fault? You were the one that read-“ Harry began to raise his voice again but stopped. “You know what, nevermind.” Harry turned. He wishes he could just get up and storm off, but due to the state of his ribs it seemed like it wouldn’t be a good idea.
Harry got his breakfast from the elf and ate quietly, his thoughts loud in his head.
Draco slides his hand down Harry’s body, feeling the chill on his palms, and then his hand meets something hard tucked into Harry’s waistband. He pulls out a dagger, holding the heavy blade in his hand.
Draco feels selfish at wanting to keep Harry with him all the time. He doesn’t want Harry away from his family.
“I don’t want to be completely sozzled when I get my ball outfit tailored.” He explains, although he doesn’t know why he’s trying to talk himself out of a good time.
You may or may not have noticed the change from being rated ‘Mature’ to ‘Explicit’. I’ve never written (or posted) smut before, which is a problem all in itself, but it’s hard to discern the fine line between each rating. Explicitly mature? Maturely explicit?
“Ah, Adelaide.” Draco says turning into his room. “Harry Potter needs you to take him on a tour of the castle. I’m sure you two will get along, you both are very talkative.”
“Ready to go?” Pansy said, picking up Draco’s things.
“What?” Harry says, mouth wide open.
“I was.” He says flatly.
“Come on, live a little! Surely you want to have a break from talking to Celeste and reading your boring books.” Harry said, gesturing to the half written letter and the pile of archaic books that sat on a small table.
“Ah, no. Nowhere to be, I mean.” He says in inhales.
Harry leans in next to Draco, pulling his shoulder down to get his face close to his ear.
‘Regardless, I’m eagerly counting down the days and cannot wait to have you back in the castle.
Harry just looks at him with such vulnerability and Draco just. He just can’t.
Today was the day that Harry and Draco could leave the hospital.
The child in the first one looked nothing like Draco, his cheeks too chubby and nose too small. As Harry progressed along the wall, the portraits changed. Draco had too. He lost his polite smile at the age of nine, and it turned into a sneer. His blonde hair grew by the age of three, his high cheekbones revealed at the age of seven and his pointed, long nose prominent by the age of eleven. Then Draco saw himself at fourteen. He had a grand smile on his face, and noticed the gleaming ring on his finger, the bulk of it a great difference to his slender hand.
“Jesus Christ, Harry.” Draco says against Harry’s lips, warm breath curling around them.
you do? Frolic around the castle. You’d best count yourself lucky that Celeste was willing to marry you.”
He arrived in the great hall and found Ron and Hermione laughing in their usual place on the table. Harry put on a smile and was kindly greeted back by all of his Gryffindor friends. They asked how Harry was doing and what he did while in the hospital, and he just replied with ‘nothing much.’ but it wasn’t just nothing.
Pink skies don’t exist, he though to himself. He’s never seen one.
“That’s alright.” Harry replies, gaze drifting to the new dance happening. “It’s what you’ve got to do.” He hesitates. “After, can I come to your room?”
They arrive at the door.
Draco released an exasperated sigh and throws himself almost painfully against the back of the sofa.
Draco bursts out in laughter at Harry’s simple statement, and Draco looks at him as though he’s gone mad.
Harry’s eyes quickly darted off to the side to look at Draco crouched in the corner of the stone. He turned his attention back to Lucius and shook his head. “No, Sire.”
“So it’s true then?” Draco suddenly said, taking Harry by surprise. Harry was too concentrated on his letter to see that Draco had sat up and watched him write.
“Deer hunting?” Harry half-shouted, the sound of hooves and the whipping wind making it hard to hear.
Harry’s sinking down onto his knees, parting Draco’s legs to fit in between them.
“You can come in, Adelaide.” Draco called, rearranging his position on the sofa. Adelaide had said that he couldn’t change much now, and she was right. But that didn’t stop her from losing all hope on Draco. She payed him even more visits just to see how he was and helped him write a letter to Celeste when he was uninspired to do so.
“Hey!” Harry said, shaking his head lightly.
The eight o’clock bell rings.
long.
He’s been tossing and turning all night, and the sound of festivities coming all the way from the village doesn’t help.
“It’s a cloak made for sneaking out.”
Draco watches the scene of his Father and Harry having a light-hearted conversation. He supposed he could get used to it, seeing as most of their previous mealtimes consisted of silence and etiquette.
“Well, she is my maid. But she’s also my best friend.”
“Hey.” Harry smiles, dragging Draco into the ballroom by his wrist.
I honestly didn’t expect for it to get such reach so early on, but I am overwhelmed with the amount of love that it has got.
“Don’t clap at me, it’s all Draco’s!” His smile is lopsided and it’s obvious he’s taken a couple sips on his oh so long journey back.
It’s been about 5 months since I last posted a chap to this fic...
Draco was utterly sick of it.
There was a quiet knock at the door, and Draco cracked his eyes open.
“Do you have anything so I can...?” Harry asks, shifting himself into a comfortable position.
Draco only shrugged his shoulders and picked up his parchment and quill.
He tries to lever himself up, but his arms give way underneath him and he slams back against the sofa. His back is as sore as everything else, and he supposes that’s due to sleeping on something that’s not a bed than the cold he’s apparently caught.
“I’ve never been able to get my hands on these...” He starts, turning the book onto its side to look at the extensive family tree. “That’s my parents.” He points to two names on the tree. “James and Lily.” He follows the line across. “My mum had a sister, Petunia. And my grandparents on my dad’s side are... Fleamont and Euphemia.” He says, eyes flicking up to Draco’s excitedly. Draco smiles back.
“Yeah. No, it’s fine I just,” Harry had to think of a lie, and quick. “I want to get back on my broom.” He said. He wasn’t completely lying, but it wasn’t the most important thing that was on Harry’s mind right now.
“Well, yeah. It’s fun to be mischievous, and watching your face when you get nervous is quality entertainment.”
“Why can’t I come in?”
“Ada, Christmas is in two months, it’s way too early.”
“Bisexual, yeah.”
Hey there, Reader!
“Consider it a late one.”
“Sleep well?” Draco asked fondly.
“Magic doesn’t exist, Harry. But in a sense she does talk to me through body language.”
“Oh, he doesn’t. He just gets someone to sort it all out while he parties with Cadogen.”
“Yeah, though I’d rather not.” He huffs. “What I said and did was completely out of line. Bringing up Celeste and... you know what else.”
“Thank you.”
Harry lay back down on his bed, trying to imagine Draco was next to him, softly snoring. That was the only thing that would calm him down.
“Maybe with magic they can.” He said, shrugging his shoulders.
They both flop down onto the four-post, Draco on-top of Harry, and instead of going back to kissing, Draco lets out a great yawn into the bedsheets.
“Thanks, Draco.” Harry said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Then I’ll be responsible for your death!” Ron shouted, before calming down after Hermione placed her hand on top of his.
“To where?”
“You didn’t think I wouldn’t recognise my own cloak that I spent hours on making?”
Harry drops his head onto Draco’s shoulder, and now Draco doesn’t know if he’s felt anything but pain and affliction.
“Beautiful.” Draco echoed. It wasn’t that Celeste wasn’t beautiful, she was gorgeous, but he just couldn’t feel anything there anymore. The ring on his finger felt too heavy.
“I don’t know.” Harry shrugged. “I can’t disobey the Prince.”
“Thank you for the praise, Lucius. I’m glad you have faith in me, but at the same time I’m slightly nervous now that you expect so much from me.”
“My family.” Harry says, eyes wide as he finally understands what the book says.
one of them.
“What am I meant to tell your Father?” He asks, worried. Draco isn’t really sure, because he knows his Father will be fuming at losing a Knight.
Harry stared at Draco’s blank face, but was suddenly distracted by his rumbling stomach. He realised he hadn’t eaten anything at all since being in the infirmary.
Celeste has found an old friend and they’re chatting happily away in a corner, thankfully far from Draco himself.
“HOW DARE YOU MENTION MY FATHER!” Draco yelled back, red-hot with rage.
(p.s please let me know if you are enjoying this by leaving a comment!)
Betrothed. He thinks, playing with the fabric of his pure white dress shirt. He remembers being 14, remembers once staring in awe at the ring, staring in excitement. When you’re 14, everything seems like it will forever be permanent. You have your wife chosen for you, and you must love her forever. You’ll become King and Queen, and be content with your life. At 14, you don’t know yourself. You don’t know what you’ll be like in 4 years. You don’t know that you’re unhappy with your betrothment until it starts to eat away at you. But now it was 4 years later. Draco wasn’t unhappy, he loved Celeste, he told himself frequently. It was something he had to remind himself of.
“Yeah.” Draco said, distracted by the thought of Harry being crowned triwizard champion. He knows if Harry won it, he’d be cheering and screaming, much to the dismay of his fellow Slytherins.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Adelaide shouts, barging past Harry and standing in front of the sofa. “Please tell me you did not just throw yourself onto that couch in your new ball outfit.”
The fire crackles in warmth and life, comfortably heating Draco up even as the late August heat still humidifies the air.
“I don’t really know. As you probably know I still went into battle for a good two years until my hip got injured, then I came to yours. Cadogen had suggested it when I was 16, but I declined. I was not giving up that easily.”
A small piece of paper flew out of the goblet, and Dumbledore caught it. He stopped in his tracks. And turned around to face the audience in the hall.
Draco lay there, in shock. He watched as Harry flashed him a sheepish grin and turned away from him. Had Harry just said Draco was his type? Draco’s breath quivered as he tried to control his emotions. But before he could even stop himself, Draco turned and sat at the edge of his bed, and slowly stood up and walked to the side of Harry’s bed. It had just hit him, but Draco realised that this was the closest they had been in their whole lives. But Draco loved it. His heart thrummed in his throat and his head was a blur. He lay a hand on Harry’s arm, tensing up as he met warm, hard muscle. Harry froze at the second he felt Draco touch him, but decided to let Draco do what he was about to do. Draco lowered his body on to Harry’s bed, and inched up so close that his chest had met with Harry’s back. He knew Harry could feel his heart beat a million times per second, but he didn’t mind. He wanted Harry to know that he didn’t mind. He wanted Harry to know that he felt the same. That somehow, Harry was his type too.
Draco smirks to himself. Serves him right, he guesses.
Juliet is tugged by Draco as he gets her out of the stables. The grounds are silent and dark now but the fires inside the castle provided a faint glow.
Harry pulls him in closer.
Everyone is starting to leave, bowing to where Lucius stands and clapping the winning man on the shoulder. Draco dashes past them, on a hunt for familiar back curls. He can’t find them, but he does find a head of striking ginger hair.
“I look at you, Draco. I think I’m the first person to ever properly do that.” He stumbles over the expensive velvet rug. “And when you go against the rules, you’re unstoppable.”
“Meh. I couldn’t care for any of that colour stuff, clothes are clothes!” He finally says, and Draco shakes his head fondly. Hopeless, utterly hopeless...
Please do leave a comment if you are enjoying the fic!
“I’m sorry, Draco. I don’t know how I can help.”
“Around once every two weeks I’ll have to go to Celeste’s palace attending events and spending time with her.”
“Guess I wasn’t the only one mooning for him.” She provides, and Draco can’t help but laugh.
“I don’t know.” Hermione said, starting to get worried. She grabbed Ron’s hand and walked out of the hall, intent on looking for Harry. Pansy had followed after them.
really can’t complain. It almost makes the pursed lips of judgement and quiet tuts worth it.
“Lift?” Harry smirks sheepishly. As much as he would like to pretend, Draco does not mind at all that Harry is sitting so close.
“Rather uneventful.” He lies. “My father was out on a call last night, so we missed our midnight mass and instead had it this morning.”
“Charming.” Harry replies flatly, but seconds later he’s rolling on the floor in laughter.
“Absolutely not.” Draco smiles back, but it just makes his body hurt more. He’s having trouble moving his eyes due to the pain, so he just stares at the ceiling.
The sword sinks into the snow as Draco releases it. He looks up at the sky.
Draco shoots Harry a very stern glare. “Oh come on, Draco. Loosen up a little!” He laughs. Draco kicks water into his face.
“You don’t?” Harry smiled. Draco’s glare had faltered and his face fell into relaxation.
Harry just gazes into his eyes, understanding Draco’s despair. Draco stares right back, feeling his fingers carding through the cold grass and wondering how on earth he could have disliked Harry when they first met. His initial ideas blinded the fact that Harry was actually charming, and in the best way possible. He wasn’t arrogant or vain or rude, and Draco really hopes that Harry doesn’t think he himself is like that anymore.
“I’m sure Draco can show you the ropes, seeing as he won’t be in it himself.” Lucius diverts his gaze to where Draco sits, his head held low, pushing his food around.
In the evening, they ate their food, having quiet conversations about this that and the other.
“Do you actually listen to Celestina Warbeck?” Draco said, breaking the silence between them.
“I mean...the booze was pretty great.” Daniel says quietly, so much so that Draco had to press his ear to the door to hear.
“I tried to catch you the other day, to go to James but-“
“Juliet’s a beautiful horse.” Harry says, making conversation. He didn’t strike Draco as a talkative type, but then again regarding Harry’s position he may be the most talkative man in the kingdom.
“You can’t be serious? There’s- There’s like- Hermione how much?” Ron said, gaping in between words.
After he courteously nodded his head to everyone, he was ushered into the families office.
Draco dropped his head into his hand, trying to hold back a groan at how appallingly horrible Harry was at being formal. Narcissa just watched, delicately spooning the hot liquid into her mouth, trying to avoid saying something. Lucius just shuffled in his seat, bristling at how inappropriate eating dinner like that was. Harry looked up after loudly swallowing his food, and a striking red blush appeared on his cheeks. Draco inched his leg forward and gave a discreet kick to Harry’s leg. Harry only shrugged back, directing with his hands to Draco’s own food, indicating that he show him. Lucius just struck up a conversation with Narcissa, obviously trying not to say something and offend his guest.
“HARRY!!!”
“Is it that bad?” Harry croaked, cracking his sleepless eyes open to look at Ron. He tried to focus on Ron’s face but everything he could see was blurred.
“You don’t happen to know where any alcohol is, do you?” Harry asks, his breath warm.
“That’s not a problem, is it?” Harry asks slowly and nervously.
“Draco?” Harry says, breaking the contented silence.
“Romeo?” Draco muttered in awe, and dropped down from his seat on Juliet. The stunning friesian black horse with white patches stands in the stable next to Juliet’s. It’s head is sticking over the door, smelling it’s surroundings.
“It’s difficult.” Draco releases on a sigh, squeezing tight. “There’s a lot that I have to live up for...”
“How’s it been going?” Harry asks, standing close next to Draco.
Draco’s never felt worse in his life.
At the lake, Harry gathers as many flat stones as possible and puts them in a pile. Draco groans.
Draco just scowled back, before turning to Ron and Hermione. Draco supposed he could befriend them. He was feeling adventurous. Defying his father had done wonders to him, even though all he’d done is leave the castle without his supervision. The nerves that he felt earlier had settled, and what took its place was adrenaline. He actually felt sort of alive.
Harry couldn’t think. He couldn’t feel anything. He couldn’t hear his friends around him, gasping. All he could see was Draco, a tear running down his face as he stared at Harry.
‘How is Juliet? I am very eager to see her, tis only 2 full seasons away until we shall meet. I remember you sending me a drawing of her, as a small pony. 4 years have come and went, my prince, but I still keep our ring close to my heart.’
It’s his father.
“And besides, he’s not my type.” Harry added, smiling.

“So I am.” He shrugs, going back over to Draco and giving him a quick kiss.
“It’s dusty.”
“Are you happy?”
“God, Draco. Somehow you’ve put yourself into more of a dilemma.”
“No, Father’s doing that next week.”
“We can go up to my place.” Harry said, looking up at the ceiling. Hermione nodded and Ron just stayed blank and unresponsive. His focus was primarily on Draco, and he snapped out of the staring as Harry moved towards another door in the room.
Draco’s admittance inspired by the song ‘She’ by Dodie! Also medicine scene may have been inspired by that one episode of Merlin...
By ten o’clock that night, Draco’s certain that Harry Potter is not a flirt, and that his full attention lies in Draco.
They break off the kiss fully now, both staring into each other’s eyes.
“You have Harry.”
He doesn’t know what to feel right now. If only Harry could admit these things when he was sober, and maybe Draco would find the answers he was looking for. From their time together at the beach, Draco had a glimpse of hope that maybe there could be something between them, but what with drunk Harry saying right now, he couldn’t feel any more insecure.
“Wait-“ He whispers, finding Harry’s eyes through his dark lashes.
“So do you have a thing for Weasley?” Draco choked out, lightly. He knows he doesn’t really mean it, but what else was there to say?
Draco picks up a stone and gets into the stance. An idea pops in his head.
It’s not that Draco doesn’t want to see Harry. In fact, Draco would gladly do it all day. But now, finding things out about Harry and ultimately himself, being around him will be like pressing a self-destruction button, only hurting himself more.
“What?” Harry says, his eyes snapping open.
Draco pulls his duvet over Harry, shoves his pillow under his head and prods the wood in the fire so that the flames brighten up again.
“Okay, but you need to be downstairs in ten minutes. Your mother and father want to speak to you at breakfast, then you’re having lunch with the nobles, after that you’ll have to meet with me and we’ll...”
“Thanks, Draco.”
“You’re pulling back to far, you see, and you’re letting go to fast. You want it to glide, not plonk.” He said in a reassuring tone, taking the impromptu lesson seriously.
He wakes to a cold flannel pressed to his burnt-up forehead. The sheets press hot and sticky on his skin, but he eyes a cold goblet of water on the bedside table and greedily gulps at it.
“How did you-how did you know you were gay?” Draco quietly said, honest in his words.
“Just imagine what you think it’ll be like and amplify that by a hundred.”
Harry visibly froze but then relaxed as he recognised the voice to be Draco.
Draco’s rage turns into fury. He may not like the arrangement he has with her, but he still considers her a friend.
“She’ll be there?” Harry asks.
“Well, I’m flattered.”
The soft spot that Harry has for Draco was a major benefit in this situation, as Harry began to make his way back to Draco, a worried expression on his face.
“Ah, I hadn’t known that. I suppose that you would have wanted to keep it private from the land.” Lucius nods solemnly, his words full of respect.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry about earlier.”
“I’m not scared of thunder.” He says adamantly.
Draco’s heart stops at the ‘he’. Was Harry...? He can feel himself blushing. Fuck.
For once in his life, Draco has hope.
It was from Celeste. Of course it was. Draco skimmed his eyes over the neat writing and quickly tucked it into one of the pockets in his trousers. It was a heavy weight in his pocket, even though it was only one thin sheet of parchment.
“Well then let’s swap jobs!” Harry replied jovially.
“I know it’s late and cold, Jules, but you’re the only one here right now.” He sighs, strapping the saddle in and tugging her out. He hasn’t had the time to see her recently, and he misses it. Life four months ago seems simple compared to now, and he’s slowly understanding that he took all that free time for granted.
“I’ve got something for you, actually.” Harry says, running his hand over Draco’s head and pulling the hood down.
“Draco?” Someone calls from behind him, and Draco jumps. He turns slowly from Juliet, and is relieved to find Harry on Romeo.
Harry held his head in his hands until he felt something fall on his lap, and noticed that Draco had flew one of his special quills over to Harry. Harry moved his hands from his eyes and smiled softly.
“You dinner will be soon, Draco. Think of pink skies.” She said, smiling, before cracking open the door and walking out.
“What do you do, then?” Harry says, in genuine intrigue.
“Apart from making announcements, no. We have a lot of what the town has in our castle, Father thinks it’s a waste of time to venture outside...” Draco stopped as he noticed Harry’s bright green eyes searching around his face, his mouth twitching into a playful smile.
“It’ll all be okay, Draco. Celeste is a lovely girl, and I know things are...different now, but try and have fun.”
Draco let’s go as soon as Celeste nods, and Harry follows soon after.
“I wrote it.” He says embarrassingly, feeling his face grow hot. “But!” He adds, “You cannot read it now, it’s nowhere near finished. That’s hardly a first draft.”
“Harry...” He hears someone to the left of him whisper. He glances out of the corner of his eye and it’s... Christopher he supposes. He’s never really cared for knowing the people who defend his castle, but due to Harry’s influence he’s keen to learn. “Why’ve you brought the Prince to our lounge?” Christopher eyes Draco as he speaks.
Before Harry can move on to his next contender, there’s a bellowing voice sounding from the grand oak door.
Harry’s eyes widen and he bites his lip in trying not to laugh. Draco shouldn’t find it sexy. What’s his life come to?
“Give it one more go, and if you don’t get it then I will just have to think there’s been a curse placed on you.”
“Sorry.” Harry said sheepishly, turning the corner to make his way to his sleeping chambers. “Have fun with your letter.” Harry smiled, it not quite reaching his eyes. Draco missed the full, teeth-bearing, full lipped smile that he had seen not even ten minutes ago.
“Is it hurting as bad?” He asks, shifting his knees to sit further up.
“Missed you.” Harry says, and when Draco turns around, he is shocked to find that Harry looks presentable. He’s wearing a fancy outfit, and his hair is far from the usual mop.
“Really? It’s honestly fine, you don’t have to.”
“More like afternoon.” Harry laughs, and Draco shoots up.
“Your place?”
A smile starts to spread on his face as he allows himself to think of only Harry. No obstacles in his way, no difficulties. He can just see Harry, in a full suit of armour, lying on his bed and smiling up at Draco. It’s a nice thought to think.
“There’s something else I found, but I wasn’t supposed to take it, so don’t go showing the village.” He says, pulling out a large frame tucked behind his bedside table, lifting it onto the bed and letting Harry see the entirety of it.
“Adelaide said you’d be in the gallery, I didn’t realise you’d be getting a portrait done.” Harry shrugged, letting himself be pushed further into the wood-panelled room.
“Yeah me neither, not with a guy or girl for that matter-“
“Are you surprised?” He asks hesitantly.
“I didn’t tell him!” Draco replies back , just as wildly. “He came into my room last night all drunk and telling me so much confusing shit!”
Draco stands up, appalled. He’s not particularly a fan of being reduced down to something for the purpose of being a bit of fun for Harry.
“My bet is soon, he’ll manipulate you until it falls off.” Draco scoffed, now feeling anger at his Father that he could have had a normal life with normal friends like Ron and Hermione.
Harry had a large grin on his face, growing wider as he looked at Draco’s features.
“So how will things work? I know that she lives in the land across.”
Almost as if Harry’s reading his mind, he sheds Draco of them and throws them carelessly onto the floor.
(ps pls let me know if you are enjoying this by leaving a comment!)
“I should go, it’s late.” Harry said, standing up abruptly.
“Shush, just dance.”
“I’m trying to run from your Dad, he’s put me on a shift but I desperately need to pick up my sword for the tournament tomorrow.” Harry said, looking through the arches incase Lucius appeared.
“Why did you wake me up? It’s 3 in the morning?” Harry questioned Draco, mad that he interrupted his peaceful slumber.
“Draco, you’re going to pull out all your hair if you do that any longer.”
“Why are you, though? Surely my father overworks you and you get bored standing guard.”
He feels genuinely happy for the first time in what feels like forever.
“Just open it!” Harry says, moving to sit cross legged and openly there, and not feeling ashamed at all.
“It’s because you’re infatuated with him, Ada.” Draco teases.
“Well, one night we were just sitting around and...he kissed me.”
“Thank you. You look wonderful.” He says, making his voice go unusually smooth. She blushes, and grabs onto him tighter when they spin, their moves matched by the other dancers.
“She didn’t question anything, don’t worry. Although now that I think about it she did give me a look...”
The music starts, an orchestra hidden in the balcony playing a staccato tune,
“Let me, Draco.” Adelaide says, scurrying over to Draco where he sits on the chest at the end of his bed.
“But it’s not as easy as that. It’s- I can’t-“ He cries, holding a hand to his chest.
Harry was about to say something else but saw Ron and Hermione walk in, smiling. Harry groaned very slightly but smiled as they went up to him. Ron scowled at Draco, but Draco just ignored him.
“Have you seen Harry?” Ron asks, searching through the crowd that walks up the stairs that Draco had sneakily gone through.
“Sure you’re not.” Draco replies, running the tips of his fingers through Harry’s unruly hair.
“Would you liked to be held in a cell with nothing but water to live off?” Draco said condescendingly, bewildered at Harry’s little knowledge about how things had worked in the castle.
I might slow down on my writing, because I’m afraid I will start talking nonsense if I keep on writing new chapters so frequently. I’m also planning on writing another Drarry fanfic after this one, and I have ideas in the works. Exciting stuff!!
“Where the fuck is he going?” Ron shouted, watching Harry run.
“If you’d been a real man, maybe you would have actually become a knight. You wouldn’t put shame onto this family. Sometimes I wonder why I still keep you here. At your age, I was doing what’s right for the land and learning how to fend for myself. And what do
“Harry, calm down. Yes of course you can use it, you don’t have to ask.”
“After your Father, right?”
Harry stands at the door, his face looking fatigued and sweaty. He takes his arm out from the bulky metal sleeve and pulls the endless links of chainmail over his head. The Knights uniform wasn’t completely hideous looking, but it could do with some improvements in Draco’s opinion. The tunic is long and thick, pulled around Harry’s body with a large black belt. The fabric itself was a deep green colour, the Malfoy emblem embellished in the middle. The emblem was rather big, displaying an image of two snakes facing each other, their silver tongues out and hissing. Draco had thought it was the only thing mildly acceptable that had come from his royal family line, and his Mother agreed with him, wearing a small version of it on a thin leather rope.
“What’re you going to do about it?” Draco seethed. He wanted to protect Harry. He didn’t want Ron in his way.
“Oh, sure it was. Well anyway, I was 16 and had just signed up to be a Knight and needed a place to stay that was close to Cadogen’s training area. Ron said that the flat above his workshop was free and if I could deal with his loud family then it’s mine. I’ve dealt with his loud family for a long time now, so it was a no brainer.” He shrugged, sending a humorous smile towards Ron.
“The hug.”
Harry was going to tell him. He knew it.
He stopped immediately in his place when he saw Draco sitting in the quidditch pitch seats, watching Harry as he flew above. Harry just wanted to fly over to him and tell him how he feels. But he was distracted by Ron’s voice.
“Rude.” Harry says, though he’s not mad.
“Oh, right. You saw us.”
Pink.
“The one and only.”
“Is it what you wanted to say?”
“Yes I am. For ever thinking I could live a normal life. For ever thinking people would like me back.” People meaning Harry. It was true. Draco was too proud, too unavailable. Why would Harry even bother to try, if he did? Draco wasn’t worth the risk. He wasn’t worthy of Harry. He stops his thoughts, laughing at himself at the absurd idea of even thinking Harry would feel about him like that.
“He doesn’t.” He said again.
As he puts his clothes on, he thinks that he would rather be a child. Full of naivety and optimism because he really did not know how life would play out for him, and if being stuck in his 14 year old body was the price to pay, he would gladly take the offer, wanting to save himself before everything had happened.
“Not like she had a choice.” Draco said under his breath. He doesn’t really know what to say to the rest of that.
“Don’t flatter yourself, Potter, or I’ll get you to muck out the stables.”
“Well, Draco, can you tell me-“ Adelaide starts, walking into his room.
Draco hastily steps back, trying to catch the breath that had been lost. He could easily just take him down and make out with him, but he really had no idea what Harry really wanted. His face was always blank, wanting to know Draco’s answer before he could make up his mind about his own. Draco only wanted to kiss him if he knew Harry wanted to kiss him back. And even if it was just a kiss, the fact it could change what they have now was overwhelming.
Draco smirked at Harry. No one had ever called him funny before. He stared at green eyes and black hair but broke it off after a couple of seconds.
“You know it. Your father keeps taking me out of watch duty so that I can assist him with his practice.” Harry sighed, flopping back into the armchair across from Draco.
“Why on earth are you getting me a gift?” Draco had asked when she placed it on his bureau earlier in the week.
It should be weird, the amount of time he spends just looking at Harry. He should find it weird. But he doesn’t.
Adelaide casts a questioning glance at the both of them.
He kisses the ring on his finger, cold metal against warm lips, and reads on.
“There’s always a man and woman in dancing, isn’t there.” Harry huffs, regaining his posture.
“I hope Adelaide doesn’t come in.” He manages, before his eyes drift closed and his body slouches.
“To where?” He asks, trying not to seem too curious.
Draco rolls his eyes, his mood worsening. Harry runs up, catching Draco by the wrist. It hurts, but it also feels fantastically good.
Harry has become a steady figure in Draco’s life, a reminder of kindness amidst the presence of his parents. He’s comforting.

“Fine, Draco, but if you want the hems to be wonky and your left trouser leg longer than your right, then I suggest you both keep your mouths shut.” He says, bright blue eyes piercing the both of them.
“Sorry.” Harry mumbles, wincing as the muscle contracts.
“Sebastian will be here soon.” His mother says lightly, although she’s wearing the same face his father is.
“Ah, great, thank you.” He stood up quickly and pulled the sword out from the bag. “Ah, wicked.” He said, admiring the sword.
Instead of Adelaide being on the chair when he wakes up, it was Harry. The sun was setting, pink and gold tones highlighting his room. He must have slept for hours.
“Draco?” Adelaide says, her voice closer now. Draco can feel the bed sinking under her weight, and then a moment later can feel a reassuring hand on his shaking shoulders.
“I didn’t mean to hurt you. Or push you away. It’s- It’s hard.”
“Yes, Mr Potter.” Pomfrey said, and left.
He really wishes Harry were next to him right now, maybe then he’d remember to breathe.
Draco suddenly shivers in the cold, coming to an unwelcome realisation that they should probably get inside before Draco catches a cold or Harry freezes to death. Or maybe the fact he has an heiress waiting for him on the dance floor.
“Focus on your feet before focusing on my face, Harry. I need to preserve my toes for the ball.” Draco says, stepping backwards. Harry’s face drops at the sudden loss of touch but it quickly livens again as he realises it’s the start of the dance. When Draco turns to look at Harry, he can see a pink flush rising under the fabric of his tunic. Draco circles around, Harry turning with him. Their forearms are held mere inches from each other, Harry stumbling slightly as Draco turns the other way, trying to understand how many times he should circle around.
“What the FUCK?” Ron said, turning into the corridor and finding Harry and Draco snogging. Behind stood a red faced Hermione and an angry Pansy Parkinson.
“You sound like a wise old man.”
“End of the week?” Harry’s face lit up in joy. Although it he enjoyed his time with Draco, he couldn’t help but feel joy as he remembered that it meant he could be back to flying soon.
“Harry, you- Oh Merlin-“ Ron searched frantically around Harry’s face, before turning his eyes back to Draco and bowing rigidly. “What the hell is Draco Malfoy doing in my office?” Ron whispered, his face going red at his embarrassment and also anger.
“It’s fine, Draco. Really.” Harry smiled, his eyes turning soft.
“Alright, thanks Ada.” Draco rubbed his sleepy face. Draco headed down to breakfast, hoping Harry might be there so he could entertain him, but as he passed through the courtyard, he saw Harry on duty with Knight Arthur.
Draco didn’t say anything, he just removed the cloak he was wearing as the heat of the furnaces blasted warmth into the office-like area. Draco could hear muffled voices coming from the other side of the door, and Harry just stood, focused on something embedded in his fingernail. This was the first time that Draco had truly seen Harry at loss of what to do, or say or feel. Harry’s friends were charming enough, but Harry seemed to lose his confidence when Draco made it clear that he was confused at the whole situation. It was common for townsfolk to be flustered at his presence, but with Harry being here it felt almost embarrassing. There was a pink flush on Harry’s cheeks, telling Draco that maybe he was embarrassed too.
“Pomfrey told us you’ll be out at the end of the week!” Hermione laughed. She had missed Harry greatly.
(ps please let me know if you’re enjoying this.)
“That’s what I mean by talking, you pillock.” Harry laughed, turning slowly on his heel.
“Fine.” It was impossible to say no to this man.
“Oh, Draco.” She sighs.
“Promise me you’ll stay. I don’t want you to run away anymore. I want you in my arms, forever. We’ll get through this. I’ll win the tournament for you.” Harry said, softly breathing as he pressed his forehead against Draco’s.
“Beauty is pain, is it not?” She says as she ties the end of the braid. Draco doesn’t move from the stool, and Adelaide sighs.
to warm to Draco, their initial reluctance now gone. They find his witty jokes funny, and Draco can’t help but laugh along at their teasing and at just how abysmal some of them are at playing simple games. There an electricity between all of them, sparking as the game heats up and it’s only broken by the sound of Harry arriving back. They all look at him, giddy grins growing even wider at the stash that Harry has managed to carry back.
“Ah, right. Cadogen used to hold mini tournaments between our teams, but I’ve never competed in a proper one before.”
“Right, I know an exit that goes around the gates.” Draco strutted out and Harry followed behind.
‘I hope you are keeping your castle, soon to be our castle, safe. And I do hope that you still think of me, Draco, because my thoughts are only you.’
The library is a lot bigger than his room, and his sofa is far from the comfortable plushness of his bed. But once he lights the small fire, he’s fine. He settles himself on the leather sofa and pulls the blanket over himself. He’s never felt better.
“No, we were meant to meet after but he just disappeared. I was going to tell him how great the sword looked, and also how great he was but mainly the sword.” Ron laughs, and Hermione just rolls her eyes.
“So?” Sebastian says, looking unimpressed as always.
Harry rests his head on the wall, glancing sideways at Draco. The smile easily returns to his face, and aside from the troubles with his parents, Draco feels pretty alright.
Harry let out a soft sigh as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, still keeping his lips on Harry’s.
“It’s fine, Draco, I’ve lived in that part of town my whole life, if I get noticed I get noticed, it’s just a default part of my job. And I know the people who own the blacksmiths. I’m welcome whenever.”
“What is it?” Draco asks, concerned. His eyes are pained.

The fire dissipates the tense atmosphere, and Draco turns back to find Harry reading a book. Well, not any book.
“You can?”
The outfit he’s donning is far too large and his narrow shoulders are lost in the bulk of the shoulder pads. Naturally, the fabric is a dark green to match the general aesthetic, and there’s an absurd amount of buckles lined down the middle of his torso.
“The big battle came, and he...he was killed right in front of me.”
“Not particularly.” Draco said, pausing to look at Harry’s face. “It’s Weasley who you should be asking.”
“Know a lot about swords?” Ron asked, pulling out a long, drawstring bag out of a crate.
Dumbledore’s voice boomed over the hall.
“Yes, but you were quite literally shaking yourself to death.”
Draco meets her eye,
“Yeah.” Harry replies.
Before Draco can even ask what he’s planning to do, Harry suddenly ruts up. “Oh, God, Draco.” He moans, sarcastically.
“It’s only three!” He replies in exasperation, turning his head to face Harry. They’re almost
Harry looks as though he’s about to say something, so Draco keeps quiet.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just starts to untie Harry’s ghillie shirt. They’ve got to finish what they’ve started, and Draco would rather that be without Harry’s atrocious ‘humour’.
“You don’t have to tell me, if you don’t want, it’s okay.”
“Don’t look so alarmed, I’m not arresting her or anything. I just wanted to know. Are there people still after you? After your accomplishments on the field?” He finished, twiddling his thumbs.
“Yeah, what is he talking about, Harry?” Draco muttered in a menacing tone, trying to get Harry to say what he had been keeping in for so long.
“Oh shush, Ron. Malfoy has been in the hospital the same amount of time that Harry has been in for. Don’t you think you could be a nice person for once?”
“Have fun at the Weasley’s.” He says. “Are you going far?”
There was a general sound of affirmations and Draco smiled pleasantly to himself. There’s a bustle of sound and Draco quickly takes off up the corridor already knowing he’s late but not really caring.
“Oh, you do?” He asks with a grin, and Draco nods.
“Yeah, but I got it soon after that, not on my twentieth try.” He cackles, hands on his stomach.
“Leave it be, Potter!” Draco says—shouts—and shoves past him. He’s starting to feel sick at the idea of tomorrow actually happening. Things that felt like so long ago now creeping around the corner.
“Mhm”
“Take your time.” Draco says as comfortingly as he can.
“Take it all.” Draco shrugged, pushing it further down the table.
“Harry, don’t you think that’s a little dangerous? I mean firstly your hip, but also you could be exposed to someone who might want to hurt you badly.”
Draco looks down at his ruffled self and scrubs at his face.
At dinner, Harry sits opposite Draco, with both Narcissa and Lucius on either side. They looked like they could be a happy family, if only Harry had been less tanned and had platinum blonde hair.
“Thanks for the portrait.” Harry says into his neck, hugging him from behind as Draco stands in-front of his wardrobe. Draco leans his head back on Harry’s shoulder, taking a deep breath.
Harry’s happy, surrounded by people he loves, and although Draco seems to be a very important thing in his life, he also has other things that he needs to cherish and to love.
“My Father isn’t exactly a saint, Miss Granger, nor is he a tyrant. But he has his ways of doing things that I don’t particularly agree with.”
Draco nodded and went back to his books, and Harry summoned a house elf to get food specifically from the great hall.
“Alright.” Draco whispered, concerned about Harry’s intensity.
ty <3
“You hungry?” Harry asked, knowing Draco would probably say yes.
“I honestly don’t know. One day it was all fine and I was excited for our marriage but then the next it just felt like it was never going to be enough. I’m just greedy. And ungrateful. I should be happy.” Draco says, wiping tears from his face.
He’s never once liked Christmas. Not even the one year when he was given Juliet. His father uses it as a way to be flashy, to bring together people that would rather be anywhere else. Thankfully there aren’t any dances, but the gaudy decorations are just as bad.
“You’ll be proud of yourself when the sky turns pink again.” Adelaide quotes from the top of her head.
“Well, when’s the wedding?”
“Hey, mate.” Ron said, looking at Draco as he scowled into his school work.
Draco doesn’t get Juliet out this time, instead traversing down the rocky faces on unstable wooden steps.
“Wow, Harry.”
“But I thought...you went from the land over?” Draco asks, surprised and warmed.
He’s looking at himself in the mirror, grimacing at what he sees, when there’s a sound at the door.
Draco finds him, when the sky darkens to a pink. He’s sitting on a bench, overlooking the grounds that are covered with a thick layer of snow.
Ron scooted around the growing customers and opened a large oak door, revealing a larger room with metal scraps, furnaces and work tables. There were more gingers working around the room, all smiling and greeting Harry with warmth and comfort.
“Oh my god.” Draco says, high pitched in shock.
There’s a bubble of calm that surrounds them, their heartbeats matching and breath mingling. They could almost be one person, they were so intertwined.
Harry had to return Romeo to the stables and have a briefing with Lucius, so they reluctantly said goodbye.
Draco picks up the small letter and unfolds it on his lap, trying to keep it away from the sight of Harry. He turns from the humorous conversation about how Cadogan nearly had to fight a sloth of black bears in the forest.
Harry’s world stopped spinning. He couldn’t make out any of the faces that stared at him.
Lucius always put on that front. A facade to make it seem as though his family was perfect and organised and happy. He put it on at feasts, at balls and in the presence of the public when making announcements. He did seem glad that famous Harry Potter was in his palace, though, but it was more to do with the fact that he was well respected in the town than the fact that he was a good Knight.
“Oh, so now my frozen arse matters?”
“DRACO!!!” Harry shouts, his face covered in the snow that Draco had just thrown at him.
Harry is a good distraction.
“Ha, of course Harry Potter, the chosen one, needs his beauty sleep. How else would he maintain his beautiful looks?” Draco said, trying to sound sarcastic but sounding painfully honest. He stopped talking before he could say anything more.
Harry doesn’t say anything else, and as they move deeper into the forest, where the snow lays thicker, Harry is several meters behind.
Harry shot off on his broom from where he was sitting, and did a straight bee line towards the glowing ball. He grabbed it with his hands and shouted towards Ron “Haha mate, victory’s mine!”.
“Draco?” Adelaide says, anxious at Draco’s silence.
“Nah, I think that nap I had worked.” He replied, making no move to step further.
Draco tried as hard as he could to stop his eyes from rolling. If he heard someone mention the ball again he might actually lose it.
“I went to the town archives, and I’d found-“
Enjoy 😌
“How long has that been there?” Draco says, surprised. The present, wrapped in brown parchment, is heavy and rectangle shaped.
“You stay here, I’m going to get some supplies.” Draco stands up quickly, making his way to his bathroom.
“She’s my- nevermind.” Draco says, his voice catching in his throat.
There’s still a faint tune heard from the garden, the orchestra seeming to turn their waltz pieces to something slower.
He picked the first name out of the goblet.
Harry was about to say something before a knock was heard at the door. Draco stepped back from Harry, realising that they had ended up really close together.
“No, not today. I think he’s getting ready for the tournament.” Draco says, guiding them to where the rest of the entering guests are filtering through. The twelve o’clock bell chimes, and Draco knows he should be sitting in his chair in the arena.
It does make Draco feel better, and he picks up another stone, grim determination flooding his veins. He pulls back, and...
Draco looks down. “I just- I’ll have to think about it.”
Lucius Malfoy is a force to be reckoned with.
He has to be believable, and the only way to do that is with solid proof.
This chapter is pretty long, sorry! I hope you enjoy, definitely one of my favourites so far :)
“The sword’ll be ready in 2 days, it’ll be in the usual pick up spot.” Ron said to Harry before turning to Draco. “Thank you, Prince.” He said, bowing. And then again.
He’s idly leaning against the wall, his foot dragging through a layer of dust on the floor. The room he’s standing in front of is where the spare uniform and armour is kept. Harry’s previous muddy state is gone, and he’s just as sparkling as he always is. Trust him to always look good.
Draco rolled his eyes, but he could feel a blush blooming up his neck.
Harry who feels the same way as him, Harry who is not wearing as many clothes as his should be, pressed against Draco’s side lovingly.
Harry’s being wise, much to Draco’s chagrin. That’s his job.
“Looks great.” He says slowly, seemingly finding the amount of buckles on Draco’s waistcoat unnecessary. Apparently there’s hope in Harry’s clothing taste.
“Malfoy.” Harry replied, turning back around so that he wasn’t facing Malfoy.
Now if Draco could just pretend he was sad for one second more...
“It’ll all be okay.” Harry reassures him, and watches as Draco gets into bed.
“Stupid Sir Potter! I don’t know why Father keeps inviting him to breakfast, he’s not that interesting.” Draco drawls, swishing the water around with his pale and slender fingers.
These silly little fantasies are what motivates him. But, sometimes, dealing with the events of the current day is all that he needs to do right now.
No. It couldn’t be.
“I understand.”
“What? No. Malfoy’s don’t apologise.” Draco crossed his arms, sulking. “I- I’m sorry” he finally admitted, and felt relieved when Harry didn’t jump up and laugh in his face.
Over the next couple of days, Draco ignored Harry. Properly, this time.
“Morning.” Harry had said, bleary eyed and throat thick.
“You’re always worrying about the future!” Harry sighs, swaying back and forth into Draco’s personal space.
“Adds some... personality.”
“Boyfriends?” Harry said with no hesitation.
It was around evening when Draco decided to take a stroll around the castle. His stomach was full from dinner and he needed to do
“Oh, I thought you would know about them, I guessed at the castle you’d-“ Ron started, but stopped after once again speaking whatever was on his mind. It was refreshing for Draco. “Never mind.” He said guiltily.
“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t.” Adelaide breathed a heavy sigh. “I’d only thought that you didn’t want to marry Celeste because you don’t feel any sort of love toward her, but now knowing it’s because you swing a different way...” She shrugs.
“God I hate this land.” Draco slumps back against the grass, splaying his limbs out.
He moped around his room, picking up random books, reading a page and then throwing them down with boredom. He could not be seen by Harry, because Draco was certain that if Harry were to see him in this state, he’d immediately know what Draco was thinking. Draco had only processed this information himself, he did not need Harry knowing.
Harry is standing outside his bedroom door when the night is finally over. It’s late, far too late for Draco, and the realness of everything has finally caught up to him.
“What are you doing?” Draco whispers, keeping his head straight forward so that he won’t catch the attention of his parents.
Draco drops the quill and rests his head into his hands, thinking about what to write to Celeste. Just something stupid, he decides. She doesn’t care. Well Draco certainly doesn’t, anyway.
“I wanted to see if you were around.”
“And you’re doing you’re best.” Harry says wholeheartedly. “Draco, I don’t think I’ve ever felt like this before. I don’t want something as little as your parents to ruin this.”
“You know I could just leave right now. I’m sure you have plenty other people in this castle to scold.”
“Early Christmas present.” She smiled, placing Draco’s thick blankets everywhere on the four-poster bed.
“You look like a bedraggled kitten.” Harry laughs.
“That’s absurd, horses can’t talk.”
“You’ve got to be at the front of the castle for Celeste’s arrival.” She tells him, gathering his stuff together.
“As much as I feel sorry for you Draco, and you know I really do, you need to keep this farce up.”
Draco manoeuvres a heavy Harry onto his large bed and pushed him lightly so that he can lie on his back.
“Fifty points from Gryffindor.” Snape stated, and then stopped to consider. “And Slytherin.” He left the hospital, leaving the two boys in silence.
“Yeah, oh.” Draco replied, agitated.
Harry was fed up of extra work from Snape. Harry was fed up of leg cramps. Harry was fed up of taking the medication that tasted like sour milk.
“Yeah, brilliant,” Harry said roughly, because he was really feeling the opposite. He knew Draco could hear him. Hear the loathing in his voice. “Why?” He questioned.
Draco flicks up the iron latch, and pushes the door forward. The wood creaks against the hinges, and the hay cracks under Draco’s black leather boots. He heaves the saddle over Juliet, and unwinds the large rope loosely hanging from the elegant horses neck.
“I’m really not in the mood,” He says a bit forcefully, and Harry physically reclines.
The rest happens all too quickly. The other fighter manages to edge his way closer to Harry, and one second they are both fighting with all their might and the next, Harry is on the floor, his sword just out of reach. Draco, and the rest of the crowd it seems, stand up to try and see what had happened, but everyone is moving at the same time, applauding the man who won and hauling Harry up to his feet. Lucius is not happy with Harry, and Harry... well he looks pale. Almost gaunt-like. His eyes are scrunched up and he’s limping, but before Draco can go see what’s up, Harry is lost in the crowd.
“What’s your injury?” He says, wanting some answers as to Harry’s arrival.
Draco’s sheltered walls began to build up around him, but he takes a deep breath and makes himself speak. For his own sake. And Harry’s.
Draco steps through the abandoned clothes as Harry guides them to the four-poster bed, kissing Draco languidly.
Draco jumped off of Juliet, and held out a hand for Harry to use as he climbed down.
He finished the letter off, with a grand grin on his face.
He throws his head back in laughter and applauds Adelaide for her knowledge of Draco and her sense of humour.
“Say hello to Sir Harry Potter for me.” She says, trying to sound sarcastic but sounding more desperate.
I really liked how this ended, and I didn’t want to add on and ruin the vibe.
“I need my arse to dance at the ball, in case you’d forgotten.” He sighs, attempting to pull himself up but only flopping back down a second later. Harry holds two large hands out, and hauls Draco up from the freezing pile of snow. He gets onto his feet and is met with Harry’s face just a couple of inches away from his own. If Draco moves his face forward a fraction, their noses would be touching.
Harry looked between Ron and Draco. He knew Draco was scared, and he knew that Draco won’t be able to run away. “You. Don’t you dare bloody look at Harry.” Ron pointed his wand at Draco, and stood right in front of where Harry was standing.
“Morning Draco.” Lucius nods and gestures to the empty seat opposite him. Next to Harry.
“Potter?” Draco said as he spotted Harry walking through the courtyard on his way back to his room.
And in the end, Harry was wrong. Draco was far too many sheets to the wind, and was now stuck with the troubles of having to gather himself and going to get his clothes fitted.
Harry smiled into the kiss, and softly pulled back.
Rushing to the window, he flips the hatch frantically and is almost blinded by the biting cold. Squinting, he finds that there’s not another deadly battle, but a friendly game of sword-fighting. Draco exhales heavily and leans further out of the window, allowing him to access a better view. His intrigue immediately flares when he finds Harry being one of the two fighters, and he can’t help but smile as he watches Harry jab his sword playfully at Arthur. There’s a feeling of jealousy that flows through Draco at the sight, but then he remembers a conversation in passing about Arthur and his girlfriend.
Draco leaned forward and tugged the reins back, causing her to start a fast gallop. The wind picked up at that moment, and Draco revelled in the way it made his clothes flap and skin cold.
Celeste is making another journey back to the castle, one that takes several hours because of the ongoing feud that his father has with the land that sits between them. Celeste can’t just simply travel through. Harry probably couldn’t enter, either. He’d killed their head knight, after all.
Draco used his proper spoon, whereas Harry, who obviously had no manners or table etiquette training, picked up the biggest spoon on the table, almost the size of a ladle, and scooped the mixture of food messily into his mouth, shoving a large chunk of bread immediately after it.
“How about going to town?” Harry asked, and a mischievous look flickered into his eyes.
“Adelaide! Have I got the wrong room?” Harry says, walking back out into the corridors to see if he was in the west wing.
“What? Don’t think I understand having to keep quiet? Being watched under scrutiny by the kingdom?” Harry raised his voice slightly, turning his body towards Draco.
Both Harry and Draco were scared. They were scared to admit it to each other. They were scared that, if it became something, they would be judged. By friends, family and the wizarding world. Two boys who were enemies, who were meant to fight and argue and spit and curse were now in love. And they were scared.
“Why are you so, so-“ Draco paused, thinking. “I don’t know. Meticulous.”
“Ah...fuck, Harry.” He whispers into his ear, breath catching. Harry speeds up, his naked form somehow perfect whatever he’s doing. Through the haze of bliss, he’s aware of the stark difference between his pale body and Harry’s tanned one. His slim body below Harry’s athletic one. The dark, unruly hair that’s splayed across his chest as Harry licks a hot stripe up his neck and nuzzles at a sensitive point under Draco’s ear.
Adelaide moves towards the door and opens it. Harry stands on the other side, a charming smile on his face.
He’s digging himself in a deep hole, but there’s nothing he can do other than kiss her. It’s what he’s supposed to do.
When Draco wakes up the next day, his heart is still beating a thousand miles per hour.
He was nowhere near Harry’s level, but through the element of surprise, he finds himself straddled over Harry with his sword pressed lightly against his neck.
“It’s not as bad as Grangers” Draco commented, knowing it would piss Harry off.
“No!” Harry groaned, rolling his head back. “Not this bloody story.”
“We’re so very proud of him. I cannot wait until we have our own grandchildren.” Narcissa smiles, seeming genuinely nice. She was a lot like Lucius in the ‘I disapprove of my son not becoming a Knight but at least he will carry on the family blood line’ department. She was also in the ‘Don’t act unkempt. Ever.’ department too. And it sickened Draco even further.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asks after catching himself staring for what should be too
“Ah, it must be big.” She laughs, but there’s no humour behind it.
“I’ll make sure to secure the lock on Romeo’s stable door.” Harry says, laughing, with no note of nervousness at all.
Draco settles back down onto the sheets. “You do realise that we normally have a big feast to celebrate the workers. It’s boxing day.”
She supports his back as he rises up, his joints clicking painfully and headache worsening at the sudden movement. He sways.
“No, not my type of thing.” Draco replied with snark, his lip curling. He then stopped, realising these people were now treating him as he if he were normal. He has to give the same amount of respect back.
Draco finds Harry on patrol in the gardens, standing idly and lifting a hand to shield his face from the sun.
“I don’t understand why they don’t just bring up food from the great hall instead of having gross food that one of the infirmary kitchen elves make.” Harry explained, while using his fork to pick around the odd looking colours in his chicken.
Draco just groaned and tried to think of ways to avoid the tournament. Perhaps he could accidentally choke on a piece of bread, or maybe Juliet accidentally flings him off the saddle, or perhaps when he’s...
“I honestly just needed a new sword wielded for a tournament coming up, and then Draco came along. He’s cooped up in there, you know.” Harry shrugs with exasperation.
“It hurts.”
Sorry for taking so long to post this chap!
“I’m not sure...” He says, reaching over to pick up the parcel and inspecting the glossy paper. There’s a name under one of the folds, and Draco recognises it as Adelaide’s messy script.  He grins, explains to Harry that it’s his present from Adelaide, and rips the packaging open.
“That’s how you got your injury.”
Draco feels a lot better.
He hasn’t properly just sat down and thought. It all just happens so fast he gets whiplash.
Draco smiles at the floor, the sound of Harry’s laughter making his heart beat even faster, if that was even possible.
Harry wraps his arms tightly around Draco, smearing the new cloak with muck.
“Better than midnight mass.” Draco replies, grappling Harry hungrily wherever he can reach. “I always used to nod off.”
“Thanks, Lucius. It’s fine though, I’ll go get them done myself.”
“I took your book to a binder, and they wrote it all out professionally and turned it into a proper book.” He explains, turning his head to allow Draco to kiss his neck.
“Morning, Harry.” Draco sighed, his head deep into a tatted brown leather book.
“Arthur’s getting changed, we were both caked in mud.”
“I want red gems.” Harry said, ignoring Draco’s statement.
She wraps an arm around his own, and Draco feels like a prince. A noble, powerful, figurehead. It feels awful.
“I’m having dinner with Hermione and Ron’s family later, but I thought I’d come and see you before I left. I’m staying at my old place that night, so I won’t see you until boxing day.”
Celeste pecks him on the lips again. “Alright.”
“Draco, you can tell me anything. My job here is to be there for you. Not anyone else in this castle.” Adelaide says, lowering her head so she can catch his attention.
He tried sitting up and putting his feet on the ground, but sharp pain hit him everywhere at each attempt. Not to mention Draco softly laughing at each attempt. He scowled and put his sheets back over himself. He hadn’t said a word to Draco since their little fuss this  morning, and he wasn’t planning on saying anything, anytime time soon. He wasn’t as mad as he was when Draco first talked back to Ron, but he liked dragging out his silent treatment. There was a part in his heart that hurt when he thought about Draco not accepting him.
They share a meaningful glance, both thinking about what happened yesterday and what will happen now.
But he wasn’t fed up of Draco. He thought it would be the worst couple of days he’d have in his life. But he found it to be the best. What they had was sudden and unexpected, but Harry didn’t doubt his love for Draco one bit.
“Oh, I sure do.” He nods primly, before pulling Harry forward by the nape of his neck and pressing his mouth hard. Harry’s hand travels further up, his hands knotting through Draco’s plait. When they pull away for the second time, the whole thing has come loose.
“I know, but- well. I don’t know! It’d be nice to know someone in the castle.” Harry shrugs his shoulders in exasperation.
“Little?” Draco muses.
Draco looks up to Harry and shrugs, before doing what he did before and slumping on the sofa.
Perhaps there is no getting over him.
“Shit.”
I recently got a random spur of motivation to finish this fic and I’ve remembered how much I used to love writing it and creating ideas, so here we are!
“I have no doubt that you’ll do great, Harry. It’ll be in a couple of weeks, you may want to get your sword sharpened and armour prepared. I’m sure someone can get it done for you.”
“But...what?” He says, looking up. Harry is smiling from ear to ear, and Draco leaps forward to kiss him. He doesn’t care that Harry is dirty.
“Ah, Draco I wouldn’t-“ Harry says, and Draco looks at him moments before disaster.
“I’m going to make a fool out of myself.” Harry admits, scrubbing his face with a hand. His cheeks are bright red.
“I am nice! It’s just that my Father has controlled how I act in front of others. I’m rebelling.”
Before he slams the door shut, he takes notice of his empty ring finger. Everything in his body is telling him not to wear it, to rebel and feel free for once, but Draco couldn’t even begin to fathom what his father would do if he saw. Draco gave in, pulling the ring from its holder and slipping it on. His heart sinks every time he looks at it.
“What’s it to you? I don’t have to tell you.” Malfoy defensively said, like Harry had offended him.
‘I hope this letter shall find you well. I am most excited for our union, when we come of age.’
“Can we stay here forever?” Draco asks, tentatively touching Harry’s torso as if he needed permission. He doesn’t want to move too fast, to scare off the man he’s wanted for a while.
“Oh for fucks sake. What is it? I’m here now, just tell me.” Draco huffs.
“Oh, you’re too kind.” She laughs, patting his hand. “Now come on! I’ll be in trouble if you’re late!” She pulls him up from the bed, sorting out his ruffled shirt.
“Flattering.” Draco scowled. If he was his Father, he wouldn’t put his son through a marriage for the sake of carrying on the Malfoy bloodline. “What are you doing?”
“Draco, your shoes.” She sighs, her eyes sympathetic towards him.
“Adelaide I-“ Draco sobbed, his face planted into Adelaide’s shoulder. She gripped his arm and moved him onto the edge of bed, where she could hold an arm around him.
He’s looking down at a spot on the floor before he feels a tap on his shoulder.
“A nice person? Hermione? Are you forgetting who we’re talking about here? It’s Malfoy! He’s a- He’s a prat!” Ron exclaimed, and both Hermione and Harry rolled their eyes.
“Fine.” Draco huffed, slightly whispering in defeat.
whoops...
“Are you still on that ‘Sir Potter’ stuff, Ada? He considers you a close friend.”
His mouth met Draco’s, and Draco immediately relaxed into the touch. Harry brought his hand up and carded it through Draco’s hair, pushing Draco harder into his flustered face.
“Ha! Honestly, you are a stuck up brat.” Harry laughed.
“Oh stop, I’m blushing.” Draco said in a silly voice. Harry had never seen him so at peace before, and he knew that Draco never acted like that in front of his friends before, in fear of judgment.
“How long have you felt like this?” She asks after a while, Draco having caught his breath back.
“Alright.” He answers despondently, his throat feeling tight and heart beating miles too fast.
The trumpets introduce his Father, who takes his place in the throne that sits in between his mother and himself. There’s a cacophony of claps, although they don’t come with bright faces. Most look displeased with the King, but a tournament wasn’t something you could miss out on, especially if you’ve been invited. It gets Draco pretty riled up that his Father only cares for the more wealthy people in the Kingdom, and there was so much room in the arena that could easily  another one hundred.
“You’d be surprised.”
“Fine, fine.” Harry sighed with humour. He glanced at Draco for a couple of seconds, before finding words to say.
“Don’t call him stupid, Draco. You said you were ‘friends’ now. And anyway, Sir Potter is very interesting. His stories are fascinating.”
Harry pulled Draco into the blacksmiths, his calloused fingers held tightly around Draco’s pale and narrow wrist.
“I’ve lived with a lot of people who have told me a lot of things.”
Harry just smiled, but the smile was gone when he saw that Draco had left from his seat and headed back to the school.
‘If only these past years spent waiting for my fathers permission to visit you hadn’t happened, darling. But we have all the time in the world to make up for it. Adelaide has me up at seven every morning practicing the waltz, and later today my tailor is visiting and I’ll have my outfit. Remember, you’ll have to wear something forest green so that we’ll match. The night has to be perfect, no?’
“Harry, I-“ Malfoy’s voice got caught in his throat. The softness of his voice had shocked him more than saying Harry’s name, as the only time he ever says it is to make a petty remark about his stupid girlfriends. Malfoy watched as Harry’s breathing had come to a halt, and could tell he was having a hard time getting used to the first name basis Malfoy had sprung upon him.
“Our hair.” Draco repeats, smirking. “It’d be fine if our hair was an ashy blonde but, unfortunately for us, platinum hair runs in the family,” He explains “It’d be fine for my mother, her being from the noble family of Black. Her hair is much darker, but for me and my father we have no such luck.”
“Harry!” Lucius called, turning the corner and seeing Harry.
“Well if you’d take a chance with him you might not be so bored in the castle.” Adelaide shrugs.
“I’m sure she’d understand if you told her...”
“Teach you to dance?” Draco says, tilting his head slightly. It would only make sense, seeing as they were in this room.
“I can’t believe you put your name in.” Draco said quietly, not making eye contact with Harry.
I’m sorry these chapters are so inconsistent!! School is starting to get busy,, apologies!
Draco sits in the bath that Adelaide had prepared for him. His back was pressed up against the wooden circular shape of it, and he sunk lower and lower into the water until it touched his cupid’s bow. Draco wanted to sink lower, to float in the water and look for something that he knows he can’t see. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel for him. Draco searched for light. Searched for something that would keep him afloat. He may have everything handed to him on a silver platter, but sometimes he just wanted to refuse the platter. To send it back to where it came from because it just wasn’t it. It wasn’t enough. He’d rather starve than be force fed.
“I’m sure you couldn’t.” Celeste reassures, and smiles falsely.
Draco scowls and Harry laughs, shoving Draco off the swing. He helps him gather the cape that has somehow made its way to the floor.
“Shove off, I’m not.” Draco replied defensively. It made him wonder, though. Draco was normally a stuck up brat to everyone who entered the castle. But when Harry had arrived, the mask he used so frequently to seem cold had slipped away without him telling it to.
“Hey, Draco. Your dinner-“ She said, then saw Harry. “Ah, Harry! Excited for tomorrow?”
“You’ve got a nice library, here.” Harry said suddenly, noticing he was staring.
He carries on. “God this is hard to talk about. Even Ron and ‘Mione don’t know.”
“Draco,” Adelaide says, but stops. She walks over to Draco and kisses the top of his head. “I’ll be back later.” She smiles and leaves.
“Prince Draco! You were here the other day! You and Harry!” She said, and the other gingers started to peer over the work tables at the woman’s commotion. She seemed excited at his presence, although Draco wasn’t really favoured amongst most townsfolk. Maybe this woman was just genuinely nice.
Draco stared angrily into Harry’s face as they walked on, and then he let it go, understanding that Harry was teasing. He knew he was teasing right from the start, but there was something else in his voice when he said it. Draco ignored him and stepped over the bridge, making their way back into the castle.
Harry looks down when he realises, and only smirks at Draco’s horrified expression.
“Do you not talk to Juliet, Draco?” Harry replied, lifting an eyebrow.
“I’ve never seen you dress so fancy.” Draco muses. Harry laughs.
“Potter.” He seethed through his teeth, glaring intently at the ink haired boy next to him.
“Right, here’s the key. Adelaide will be up soon, Sir Potter.” Draco huffs, feeling like a servant.
“Fucking hell.” Harry says, running his finger over the faces on the portrait. James and Lily are positioned close together on the picture, their faces beaming at the painter. Draco can work out a Harry’s green eyes from Lily’s and a sharp, strong face from James’.
“Go to sleep, Draco.” Harry says softly, his hand reaching for Draco’s.
She glares at him but she’s also smiling.
Harry just shook his head with a light laugh, before finding a stone and placing it flat in Draco’s palm. Then he did something that made Draco startle. His hand pressed the small of Draco’s back, angling his body sideways instead of Draco’s straight-on stance. Harry only chuckled and looked away, before taking the hand the had the stone in and placing his calloused fingers over long pale ones.
“Sounds nice.” Draco smiles, happy that Harry is having a normal day besides the confusing events of last night, or technically this morning.
Draco followed Harry as he made his way down the line, taking in every detail as though he was being forced to remember it. Draco wasn’t really sure why Harry was intrigued, until he remembered. Harry didn’t know his family. It then took Draco back to the time when Harry wanted to know everything about Celeste, saying he wanted to know because he hadn’t had one himself. Draco would have once used these as a way to brag, but now he understood.
“Well it just seems like Adelaide has payed you more attention than your own parents have.” He shrugs, but a sad tone lines his voice.
Draco sat on his bed, his legs curled up against his chest. His new found friendship with Harry was now finally catching up on him, and he had realised that his friends in Slytherin would ridicule him for having a decent conversation with his ‘enemy’. He used to think the same as them. He used to think that Harry was a snobby brat who got whatever he wanted. Who has girls at his feet. Who has loving friends who care for him. And he hated it.
“Merlins sake.” Malfoy sighed.
“Well what are you doing in here? This library is full of dust and damp, you’ll get even worse.”
He presses his face into the pillow and drifts off back to sleep through Adelaide’s lulls.
“Harry?” Draco asked, out of breath from his running around.
“What is it?”
“Yeah.”
“Have you ever... been with someone before?”He asks nervously.
“You got engaged to Celeste.” Harry interrupted, looking at Draco.
“I thought he could come with me to get a new sword.”
“Yes, I knew that. But I didn’t know your father would willingly celebrate that.”
“Yep.” Draco says, and then stays quiet as Harry flips through the tome.
There’s a small smile tugging on his face, but it quickly drops as he opens the door to the dining hall.
“S’alright. You’re here now, aren’t you?” He shrugs, and Draco admires the patience Harry has.
“That’s the point of the game, Hermione. But I get where you’re coming from.” Harry said, sending a knowing glance to Hermione.
Draco uses the excuse of taking Celeste to her carriage as a way of sneaking out.
“Like what?” Draco said, baffled, because if he were a Knight with a hip problem he wouldn’t like to be in a castle working for a snobby young adult who could behead him in a blink of an eye.
“Bad idea, Potter.”
Draco abruptly stops as he falls, Harry’s clumsy feet tripping him over.
Harry smirks. “Great.”
Blonde hair and grey eyes were all that Harry could see in his dreams.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wasn’t to show excitement, though. He was to act nonchalant around everyone. He had been raised that way, and it became second nature. Draco gives Romeo a handful of grass and makes his way to the castle, intent on finding out why famous Harry Potter was here.
“How’s your Christmas been then, Draco?” Celeste asks, turning to face him on the bench they’re sat on. She’s wearing a ruby red dress, and Draco’s in the usual dark green.
“You’re not actually a prick.” Ron murmured, before again releasing what he’d just said. “I mean- In the past- I didn’t think you were- I just-“
“Nothing I can’t handle.” Harry gives a weak smile. His eyes drop to the letters in Draco’s hand. And then to the ring on his finger.
Draco’s face was blank all day, and he was hidden under an emotionless mask. Harry couldn’t tell how Draco was feeling and it was killing him inside.
“You’re not in the mood?” Pansy giggled. “Well you were in the mood when you got yourself into this shit by pretending to be Potter.” Pansy condescended Malfoy, which she was often found doing.
“Merlin you’re just like Harry. Becoming friends with everyone after five minutes of knowing them.”
Harry nodded and slowly lifted his body so that he could sit up. He looked around and saw that it was dark outside, and the only light coming through was from the moon. Harry could tell that it was starting to become Autumn as the sun left earlier in the day.
Harry visibly relaxed at Draco’s words.
He plods up the damp sand, Harry trailing behind. There’s grey clouds hanging over the scape, threatening rain over them both. Draco rips his paper from the wood crevice and starts up the stairs.
“Great.” Harry says, smiling widely. “I’ll see you in your room, then.”
Draco remembers the last battle, when he was sixteen. His family was fine, but the land suffered. He worried every night, in his bedroom, that they’d swarm the castle and Draco would die.
“Thank you.” Harry says, hand resting on Draco’s elbow. Draco almost wants to lean into Harry and hug him, but he decides against it, because he doesn’t know what he’ll do if that electric feeling comes back.
Draco kisses her cheek, pasting on a smile that is half genuine and half forced. Celeste and him do have a bond, one that forms in childhood and never seems to fade. He can’t hate her, his feelings aren’t her fault.
“Ron, leave him alone he’s obviously in pain.” Hermione said, defending Draco as he sat with vulnerability on his bed.
Instead of Harry greeting them, his mother and father do, both welcoming Celeste back into the land and using their stern power to create an area in the middle, where they can start the dance.
As Draco left the room, he paused to pull a thick fabric tunic over his dress shirt, the rest of the castle freezing in comparison to the warm and cozy room. Although the door was shut, he could still here faint talking.
It all definitely hasn’t been a waste of time, though. Draco and the knights have formed a mutual respect between them, and he has shown that he’s nothing like his father. During the latter part of the hour he was there, Draco was sure he would develop premature wrinkles from smiling constantly. At one point, Harry had basically pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and whispered “They’re seeing who you truly are, Draco.” He was absolutely right, and Draco had nothing wrong with that. Maybe he’d even found some allies.
“I need you teach to me.” Harry says, mustering up a confidence that was severely lacking moments ago. He straightens his back and towers over Draco, his eyes pleading.
“Sir Potter can sod off for all I care. Tell him I’m busy. Writing to Celeste or whatever the fuck I do with my life anymore.” Draco raised his voice a touch, so that Adelaide will get the idea that he wants to be alone.
“Great.” Harry says, and strolls into the room.
“It’s a fantastic castle you have here, your highness.” Harry says, talking to Narcissa who sits opposite him. “The gardens are wonderful, do you tend to them?” Harry smiles, his tousled hair falling on his face.
“A picnic? It’s freezing out there. The food would go cold before we could even eat it!”
Celeste sees him looking at her ring, and her eyes sparkle in the sconce’s firelight.
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, catching his breath after the sudden surprise. “And why are you in the ballroom?” He adds, twisting in Harry’s grip to look at the entirety of the ballroom. It’s the biggest room in the castle, the heart of it, and the decorations are extravagant. There’s a grand staircase on the back wall, leading to large french doors that look out onto the gardens. Not one thing isn’t covered in gold, and it all reflects the light coming from the vast crystal chandelier, the centrepiece of the room.
“You- What? You snuck him out?” Hermione said quickly, her eyes widening.
“Don’t underestimate me, Potter.” Draco says, before he was the one that was running. He makes it over five large rocks before two muscular arms wrap around his waist, tugging him up and off the ground.
“Ah, Draco- I just wanted to- You said that I could use the library and I got bored, I can go, it’s fine. Here’s your book and- Oh Merlin I’m so sorry.” Harry rushed out on one breath, scrambling around the area in-front of the hearth.
She presses her lips together, the corners downturned.
Draco interlocks himself in her arms, and he just couldn’t hide himself now. Couldn’t turn back and avoid the problem.
“I mean...you looked pretty sick. I’d just come out of- of your room, and you quite literally collapsed on Adelaide. She told me you needed the medicine so I went and got it.” He says sheepishly.
Draco froze, hearing his name coming out of Harry’s mouth. He felt warmth flooding over his body until he had fully processed what Harry had just said to him.
He waited until he caught Draco’s eyes, but Draco kept his head down low and didn’t look up at all, like he could feel Harry watching him. Like he was avoiding Harry all together.
There was obviously things that Draco didn’t know about all three of them. There was still so much he had yet to learn about Harry as well.
“Sod off, Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes, taking it as a joke. Sometimes Hermione’s laugh became borderline scary.
He needs to go find Harry. He needs his worries kissed away. His reliability on the other man is almost embarrassing by now, but Draco really doesn’t have anything else to cope.
“Do you mind if we-“ Ron said quietly, pointing to the door. Harry nodded frantically and stood out of their way.
“If I could get you out of this, I would. You and Celeste have known eachother for a long time, and sometimes when that happens you feel more of a platonic love than a sexual love.” She says, smiling.
Draco pushed Ron’s arm away as he was lowered into the bed, and the action was followed by Ron calling him a git.
“That’s why you’ll be big competition this year. Sir Potter fighting in my castle, how enthralling!”
“Ah, Draco.” She sighs, playing with her hair.
There’d been a split second in their twisting of limbs where Harry’s face had been completely blank, trying to search for an answer in Draco’s eyes. Draco has no answers though. He was just as conflicted as Harry was. There’s a feeling at the pit of Draco’s stomach, one that makes him go numb with the heightened sensation of anticipation.
“Oh for Merlins sake, fine.” Ron rolled his eyes.
“No.” Narcissa smiles, putting her tea down. “Adelaide does all the gardens. I’m always pestering Draco to join her because he does nothing else in his life, but he declines nonetheless.” Narcissa rolls her eyes and Harry shoots a smile at Draco, one that definitely said ‘I knew you were a lazy twat.’
Harry rolls his eyes and tugs secretly on his cape.
On their way to Draco’s library, a rumbling sound emerges from the sky before there’s a heavy downpour of rain. The walls of the corridors seem to echo the sound, and it’s so comforting that Draco releases a contented sigh and lets his whole body relax, bumping into Harry’s shoulder companionably.
Draco emerges out of the ethereal forest, taking in the stunning view of the castle in the sunlight. He watches as the maids and Guard Knights walk through the large gates that protect the castle. He gallops around the side, avoiding the sights of the people dotted around the grounds and heads towards the stables.
Draco lifts his head at the mention of his name and nods. “Yes, Father.”
“It’s just our colour.” Draco says, catching Harry’s eye in the mirror. “I think it’s outdated, red is a much more noble colour but...”
“Oh shush, you. I’ve made you tea and set out some parchment. It’s all in your study. Does my hair look okay?” She asks, swishing the long braid of ashy blonde back and forth.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco and then turned back to realise that he threw his last quill on the floor. He couldn’t get up to pick it up, and his wand had slipped from the table. He wished that Ron and Hermione would come back, solely for the reason of his dropped stationary lying on the floor. It would be awkward though. Very awkward.
“I’m free now, my mother is probably ambushing Adelaide about something or other. You want to go?”
“What was that?” Lucius growled, his eyes now turning to him.
“I guess it wouldn’t be so bad...” He grumbled.
Harry Potter.
He’s had to take his black cloak, seeing as his new one is rather grubby at the moment, but it doesn’t really matter, because no one is out. The streets are empty.
The large room with long tables and glowing sconces is occupied, by his parents and by Harry Potter.
Draco sighs and tries again, but like everything else that happens in his life, it doesn’t go the way he wants and the stone sinks depressingly.
“James?”
“We thought it was just a false alarm.” He starts, and Draco freezes. There can’t be another battle, surely...? Harry’s voice interrupts his thoughts. “But your father thought we should make sure.” He inhales deeply. “There was a huge fire. Massive. And on the other side, there were the knights from the enemy land.”
Harry laughed and followed Draco through the door, saying under his breath “Oh, definitely.”
“Don’t worry about it. Have a nap and I’ll get Adelaide to make you tea.” Draco replies, opening his door for Harry and watching as he walks down the corridor.
He dashed off to the village underneath his black cloak before he could completely lose his mind and forget everything that ever existed. Apart from Harry Potter. He doesn’t think he’ll ever forget about Harry Potter. He’s certain he’ll forget about Celeste Holloway.
“What?”
“Where are you going?” Adelaide looks up from where she is standing, watering the golden alstroemeria lilies surrounding the castle.
nose to nose, and Draco whips his head back.
‘My father is greatly pleased with his choice of my future wife, and I am glad that I will be able to ride my new pony with you, who will be four when you arrive. I had Adelaide help me with drawing her, which is on the other side. Her name is Juliet. Let’s hope she gets along with Xalvador and Muriel.’ He taps the goose-feathered quill against his temple, thinking of how to end the letter.
“You looked so peaceful, and I can tell you’re hardly sleeping these days.” He says, almost interrogational. It was true, the thought of the upcoming ball kept him up.
“Yes, I shall Ada. Why are you so frantic? Is something wrong?” Draco says, laying a hand on Adelaide’s shoulder to get her to stop moving.
“Get back here!” He shouts, trying to suppress a laugh of joy.
“He’s here! He’s really here! I’ve got to put something nicer on! I’ve got to impress him!” Adelaide said as she closed the door, safe from others hearing her swooning.
Draco nodded between the two of them, watching the chaotic scene in front of him.
“Is he really that strict, on his own son?” Harry said in slight pity.
“It’ll be fine. Thank you for the book.” He says as he starts to get himself ready.
“Harry is fine, Prince, and what’s got you in a mood? Aren’t you going to be welcoming to your guests?” Harry jokes. Draco can tell that Harry is more than happy to be here, and his cockiness is starting to show. Draco didn’t expect much, though, why wouldn’t the most ‘handsome’ and ‘brave’ man in the kingdom be a bit full of himself? Draco supposed that he may be coming off a bit temperamental, but he was a Prince and he could do what he wanted.
“No, me liking men.” He chuckles.
“Mhm...” He mumbles, lost in the feeling of running his hands through Harry’s hair.
Draco breathes a sigh of relief.
“What changed?” She says after a while, once Draco’s breathing had slowed.
“Apology accepted.”

“Draco!” She gushes, stepping down onto the polished cobbles. “It’s so wonderful to see you.”
“At least five hundred. Give or take.” Hermione replied back, as astonished as Ron.
“And then this is Prince Draco’s study. As you can see this is Draco’s wing of the castle.” Sounds a voice outside Draco’s study two hours later from when he had first sat down. Draco recognised it as Adelaide’s, even though she sounded more nervous than ever.
“Why?”
Find me on tumblr @ferretboyandpotty <3
“Talk about-“ He snaps. “What’s she got to do with you? And who says I want to talk to you anyway?” Draco says in exasperation, waving his hands about.
Draco waits as Harry pulls the heavy oak door shut and then quickly makes his way through the small corridor until they’re back into the main hallways.
“I was.” He says so softly that it comes out as a whisper. “I was happy.” He says again. “Me and Celeste had known each other for a long time, and at the start it felt like I was going to marry my best friend. I think I was just so young that I was blind to the real world and thought that I was sorted for life, you know?”
“No, Professor.” They both said at the same time, holding their heads low in shame.
Draco levers himself up, water sluicing down places it shouldn’t be. He pulls off his cloth tunic, wringing it out in the water. His cream-coloured frilly blouse is dripping wet, and he shivers.
The deep strokes steal his breath away, and with every thrust he can’t help but moan. Harry has his head pressed into Draco’s shoulder, biting his collarbone hard enough to leave a mark. It’s not a surprise that Harry is very physical, all sharp edges and electric energy. Draco’s up for trying anything, it’s not like his new-found adventurous side should stop in the bedroom.
“You’re awake.” Harry says, with a small smile.
Harry could use a break after all, starting 4th year was tough and he needs several hours of sleep to make up for the ones he’s lost due to his nightmares.
“Leave him be, Sebastian.” Draco replies, with the same level of drawl. Harry lowers his head, sporting the usual ill-concealable grin.
“Fine, but I know that it had something to do with me.” Harry playfully said, knowing he was getting on Malfoy’s nerves.
It was a sunday, and it was time for the name picking to happen for the triwizard tournament. It was all anyone had been talking about, and Harry was starting to get tired of it. He saw Cedric through the crowd and went over to him to wish him good luck, and then made his way back to where Ron and Hermione had found a seat.
Cleaning charms didn’t work on Harry anymore. Every time he used one, it proved useless. It was the first time in his life that he had been wanting to have a shower. His ribs still seemed to be damaged, even after taking so much medication. His concussion had been healed and his vision was back to normal in no time. Well, as normal as it could get. Even if Harry’s ribs had miraculously healed themselves, he thinks that if he were to stand up he would have forgotten how to walk.
Draco is surprised at how happy Celeste is to
Draco sighs heavily. “It can’t be helped, Ada. But it’s just something I have to deal with.” He looks up at her. “Now stop frowning, it’s Christmas, isn’t it?”
‘Yours faithfully, Draco Malfoy.’ He signs the letter off, the quill scratching on the thin parchment.
“Ah, perfect,” Pierre said, a grand smile on his face. “You can help with portrait!”
“What are we supposed to do now?” Harry asks.
“I don’t know! It’s nerve-wracking, I feel like your Father is always watching.” Harry said, looking around, checking behind an aisle of books to see if an angry Lucius was there to tell him to get back to work.
“Yes, yes. I though this was an adventure. Why so tense, Potter?” Draco smirked, pulling the hood down.
“Ah. I see.” Adelaide inhales, taking in the information.
“Potter!” The voice said again, seeming  angry.
“It’s been too long.” He says, placing a gracious hand on the small of her back and guiding her up the castle stairs.
Harry couldn’t wait to have a shower, though. At least he was excited about something. They sat in silence until Ron and Hermione came up around 6pm after having dinner.
“I’ll never be able to do it.”
“My work takes precision, Draco. I’m making sure you don’t look a fool.” He says as he steps back to see the outfit as a whole. “Lift up your arms.”
find me on tumblr @ferretboyandpotty!! chat to me we can talk about the fic 😋
Draco drowns out Adelaide’s voice and only replies when she’s finished.
“Can you...” He starts again, not sure how to get the words across. ‘Can you fuck me into the bedsheets’ felt a bit too forward. Not that it’s not true...
Pierre pushed the door even wider, inviting Harry in. Harry looked from Pierre to Draco, and then noticed the easel. His face lit up in understanding and he didn’t really know what to do.
“You alright, Harry?” Hermione asked, noticing that he wasn’t participating in the conversation anymore.
Harry watched as Hermione got Ron up and dragged him out of the hospital to get to the common room. As soon as they left, Harry tilted his head towards Draco.
When he turns back into the room, Harry is now trouser-less. He glances down at the swollen hip that is covered in gashes. Draco loses his ability to breathe, partly because of the sight of Harry’s wounds but also because all that Harry had on now was a white tunic and a pair of pants.
Harry nods, and turns his head back away. Draco thinks he’s smiling.
“Sir Potter killed the head knight, didn’t he?”
“Yeah.”
Draco smiles as a large white horse pokes her head up, sniffing his face with delight. “Good to see you too, Juliet. How about we go for a ride? Need to clear my head.” He whispers while stroking Juliet’s white-as-snow nose. Juliet flicks her ears up and stands back from the door, as though she can understand what Draco is saying.
“Harry.” Draco stood up. He wanted Harry to know that yes, he meant it. But he was scared. Draco Malfoy admits that he’s scared. “I do- I just- I cant- I don’t.” He stopped, choking over his words. They were stuck in his throat, and he had to push them out. He had to tell Harry that he meant everything that he had done.
“Nah, not yet. The King’s having a tournament, I’m taking part.” Harry said, hitching his shoulder up.
“Jules?” Draco says, arching his head over the wooden door that keeps Juliet inside.
“I’m surprised you hadn’t heard of it before, maybe Cadogen kept you out of it because of your age.” Lucius ponders, before going back to his original point. “Cadogen selects Knights to compete in a tournament, and they fight until we have an ultimate winner.”
“Well, me and him stayed friends. We weren’t in love, or anything, but I think at a time where we were desperate and lonely there wasn’t much else to turn to. But...” He chokes over his own words, breath hitching.
“I get it.” Harry says faintly, and gathers the small amount of belongings he had brought to the hospital with him. He was allowed to leave by that time anyway.
“I’d hardly call it a relationship.”
“Okay, then.” She gave him a sympathetic smile. “But don’t let it eat away at you.”
“Hello, Celeste.” He says, holding an elegant hand out to help her down the carriage steps. She’s dressed in a bold forest green dress, her dark hair almost a shawl around her shoulders. The unforgettable blue eyes shimmer in the light, and crease in the corners from the wide smile Celeste has on.
But Ron didn’t give up this time around. He tested Harry’s skills very hard, even after Harry just leaving the hospital.
Harry had realised that after being friends with Hermione and Ron for so long, that they sometimes had nothing to talk about. Hermione always had her head in a book and Ron was always practicing wizard chess. Harry knew they never meant to ignore him, but he liked it when they had fun conversations. But it was different with Draco. Draco always knew what to say, even if sometimes he was being horrible. Draco never asked Harry about his upbringing, and Harry never asked Draco about his father.
“Ah, absolutely. Bill made it no long ago, it’s one of our best ones yet.” Ron said and rushed out the room.
Draco immediately knows who it is, and though he’s not angry at him, he feels as though his own subconscious is trying to push him away from Harry. Whether that’s a good thing for him or not, he doesn’t know.
The conversation had drifted into a complete stop, and they were both completely submerged in their work. Harry listened to Draco’s breathing and Draco listened to Harry’s faint humming, noticing that he was singing one of Celestina Warbecks songs.
“In what way?”
“I could treat you right, you know.” He carries on. “You’re hot, and you’re special, and...and I don’t know. Sucks that you’re a taken man, Draco.”
“Is it to do with Sir Potter? I saw that you were quite uneasy last night when he was in your study.” Adelaide quietly says, walking further into the room.
Harry’s face spread into a wide grin. “Yeah.” he breathed, the sound laced with elation.
“I’m sorry, Sir.” Adelaide says and closes the door as Harry walks off.
He tries to stifle a laugh. It’s unsuccessful.
“God, Draco...” Harry says, lips planting kisses over the flat plane of his naked body. Draco removes his hands from the chains and rakes them through Harry’s hair, grabbing onto the curls at the base of his head, lightly urging him closer.
“Thought it’d be fine? You really think-“ He starts, raising his voice but stopping, the need to tend to Harry’s injuries overcoming him.
“What?” He says in shock, as he flips through the pages. “What??” He says again, faintly. This is...his book. He turns to the first page, finding the opening line.
Harry breaks the searing kiss, licking his lips greedily and slowly drags his tongue down Draco, taking time to kiss his sternum, his stomach and the soft skin just above his waistband.
“Draco?” A voice calls from outside the door, and seconds later Adelaide is barging through it.
There’s a roar of thunder and Draco smiles.
“No.” Harry cut him off. He didn’t want to play games.
Harry looks down at his torso, where Draco’s pristine white shirt stretches tightly over Harry, almost at ripping point around his arms.
“Ooo! Ada! I like that nickname. I shall now call you Ada from now on.” Harry smiles and Adelaide blushes profusely, her hand covering her mouth.
“You know how you’re gay...you’re gay right? Nah...doesn’t matter but...that’s hot. Like a piece of meat, yeah?” At Draco’s silence, Harry continued. “I don’t mean that in a bad way. God, sometimes you do take things too literally. Live a little Draco, honestly. But that’s beside the point.” He raises his index finger, pointing to Draco as though he was giving him a stern telling off or an important lecture. “I think you’re hot. And shouldn’t be wasted on a bitch like Celeste.”
Harry looked at where Draco was sitting, a heavy book in his lap. Harry saw that it was the same book he was reading last night. Harry softly smiled and got an elf to get his and Draco’s dinner.
“Sit, boy, sit.” He said with through his thick French accent, gesturing towards a wooden stool by the stain glass window. The dreaded wooden stool. Draco grimaced, already knowing that his arse will be dead by the end of this.
“Draco, we have all the time in the world to see each other. We don’t have to make up for lost time, but I don’t want you spending what we have together worrying about something else.”
“He doesn’t.”
“Fuck...” Draco says, so on edge that he can hardly think. Harry pulls out, splaying across the large bed and rubbing at his right hip. He’s still hard, all pink and shiny and very much there.
Harry stared for a second, and then teasingly said “I know you secretly like it, I’m sure I heard you harmonising with me.” Harry jested, catching Draco off guard.
“Your royal highness.” She curtseyed in politeness, though her face was painted in shock. She sent a deeply confused gaze between both Harry and Ron.
They stop at the stone wall next to the doors, the music louder now and voices filtering through the cracks.
“Don’t you think your a bit old, Adelaide?” Draco laughed, slightly sighing in relief as there was nothing to be worried about.
“It’s a good thing though, I guess, I don’t know what you would have done if we had told you a story about Harry without knowing that.”
The table was quiet that morning, and Draco misses the sound of Harry’s slurps and the way he holds his cutlery. He would have though it odd if he thought about Harry this much when he first arrived, but now Draco had found a remedy for his boredom and he really enjoyed the adrenaline rush from his earlier outing.
Harry pulls back, his lips pink and wet.
“Well,” Hermione says, breaking through the silence in the room. “What brings you here today,  Harry? And with Prince Draco?” She asked politely.
When Draco wakes up the next morning, his eyes land on the pile of letters on his bureau. There’s a thick feeling in his throat, the dread of responding all too real.
Draco had only hoped he didn’t make them feel inferior. His first time meeting people who weren’t working for him or some sort of royalty, and he’d still probably left a bad impression.
Draco was glad that Adelaide understood what he was saying, even if when it came to the idea of him not wanting to marry confusing. Draco didn’t understand either, it was just a gut feeling that he couldn’t let go. But the thing is, Draco had been so distracted by his adventure with Harry, that he had forgot all about his situation. It was freeing, and that was all Draco wanted.
‘Well, why don’t you bloody take him in as your son.’ Draco thinks in his head, tempted to say it out loud but only releasing a small sigh in its place.
Harry lifted his hand up, and slowly cupped Draco’s jaw with it. Draco looked up, sadness showing in his eyes.
“Okay.” Draco smiles.
‘Sit properly, Draco.’ He had spat, shoving Draco’s chair forward. It left a painful bruise on both of his knees and he learned to never to it again in front of him. He wasn’t here now, though, and Draco even dared to uncross his hands and place them carelessly over his legs.
“Good. I’ll contact your parents for payment, and advise whoever is styling your hair on the night.”
Harry drags his eyes away from Draco’s hands, instead focusing his attention on Draco himself. He looks completely forlorn.
“You can tell me. I know we haven’t known each other for long but I promise I won’t tell anyone else.”
Harry smiles, properly this time.
Draco tugs Harry’s hair lightly, pulling his face up and mashing their lips together, Harry panting in his mouth. They’re both sweaty, fringes stuck to their foreheads, glistening in the midday sun.
Pansy walked into the hospital, and laughed. “Well he’s in a little bit of a strop isn’t he?” She said as she made her way over to Draco, who had his back turned from her.
“Possibly, but you’ll never find out.” Draco said with a cheeky smirk, which never failed to make Harry’s heart flutter for no reason at all.
“Thanks. You’re welcome anytime.”
“Arthur’s girlfriend?” Harry says, his eyebrows raising. “Are you jealous, Draco?” He smirks.
After a couple of minutes of fumbling, Draco trying to de-clothe Harry but struggling due to the fact Harry’s hands are down Draco’s underwear, Harry’s just as naked as he is. He smiles at his handy work.
“I just wanted to ask about Celeste. We can talk later.” Harry says, shrugging his shoulder.
“Oh, you sure are.” Draco breathes.
Anyhow, I’ve changed it just to be sure. Maybe it’ll encourage me to be bold with my writing,, who knows?
“Right,” He said, suppressing a shiver. “This will sting.”
Ah. Draco looks down at his fancy attire and smiles sheepishly.
Harry led the three of them through to the next room along, which revealed a food store and a table with a set of chairs. Ron pulled one out for Hermione before sitting in one himself, and Harry went to do the same for Draco before Draco raised a hand and did it himself. There was no social etiquette here. He was out of the castle and away from the watch of the general public, so he felt less inclined to act as though he was any more of a person than the other people in this room. He needed a break from all of that, and he had sensed that Harry’s friends could somehow give him the normality that he desired.
“Psst!” Draco hears on his way out of the dining hall, completely in a bad mood and far too nervous for the next days events.
“I promise, Harry.” He whispered.
Hey there, Reader!
As he opens the door to his room, Adelaide is there, his outfit for later folded over one arm.
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” She advises, and softly closes the door behind her as she leaves.
It sounds like...horses.
Left you on a cliffhanger, sorry!!!
The thing he feels most of all is guilt and pity. Celeste wants him, she likes him. He doesn’t know if he’s making it better by trying to be loving or just making it worse for himself and his situation.
That can change, Draco says in his head.
“Well I just though we should get to know each other.” Harry shrugs and smiles faintly.
Tears started to drop on Harry’s cheeks and Draco tried to reach up to wipe them away, but his hand stopped halfway up. Harry saw this and he looked straight into Draco’s eyes. Draco looked back, trying to tell Harry that he was trying. But it wasn’t working.
“Is this okay?” Harry whispers, a tentative question even though it’s obvious they both want it.
“Protecting me? Protecting me from what, Malfoy? Sirius? My godfather?” Harry questioned, knowing that Draco did mean well for him but showed it in the worst way possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders, pulling his body up to match the height Harry has on him and greedily licks and sucks. He closes his eyes, taking it all in, and feels himself being dragged towards his bed.
“Thank you, Ada.” He nods and holds the ring up to admire the shine. He then heads to his rooms, to go to bed.
Both Harry and Draco had been in the infirmary for over 48 hours. So much and so little has changed.
“Hey, if Celeste doesn’t want to dance with you, I’ll happily take her place.”
“She’s not a bitch.” He says through clenched teeth, pulling himself further up the bed as Harry moves closer.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
His whole body was tingling. It wasn’t like he’s never been hugged before, he had been given so many from Adelaide, but it wasn’t the same. No normal hug would make your heart race as much as Draco’s was right now. And it made no sense at all. He just knew he liked it.
“Come on.” He says as he turns, watching Harry in the moonlight. His head is hanging low, and he rubs his face before following behind Draco.
“Do what?” Harry asks slowly, his voice breaking.
Before Draco knows what’s happening, Harry has hauled him up by the waist and dropped him into the deeper part of the water.
They had ditched their work and began talking about music. Harry was surprised to know that Draco didn’t have too bad of a taste, thinking that all he listened to was stuck up classical music by a wizard artist. Before they knew it, they were talking about the latest news and gossip from around hogwarts. Harry only ever talked to Ron and Hermione about these things, but he was intrigued to hear Draco’s point of view. The conversation had changed from different topics, and then they were talking about the triwizard tournament. Draco asked about Cedric as he knew Harry had talked to him, and Harry had told him that he’d put his name in.
Eighteen. He was eighteen years old, but never lived a day in his life.
“Draco, you’re late for our guest.” Lucius grunts, spotting Draco.
Before the busy shop could crowd around Draco quickly asked:
Harry coughed awkwardly at Ron’s last question, gesturing towards the hooded figure that Ron had not thought to be ominous at all.
Well, almost.
“Join Draco, Narcissa and I for dinner, won’t you? You’ve been great company at breakfast and I’m sure the Knights table in your chambers gets boring after a while.” Lucius said, walking closer to where Harry was standing.
Even though he trusts Adelaide with anything, he thinks he should leave it a while before she should know what’s going on. He can already hear the upcoming lecture, even if she doesn’t have a problem with them being together.
“Well yes, I know that.” Draco rolls his eyes. “But what are you doing at the castle? Surely you have other plans.”
“What?” Harry asks, worried.
“I know what could distract you.” Draco says cheekily, and the distraught look on Harry’s face evaporates.
Molly immediately went to the office door, poking her head in and shouting under her breath. Draco recalled that Molly hadn’t been there on his first visit, and probably heard about his sighting as she arrived back.
“God damn it, Draco.” Is said against the wood, and Draco isn’t awake to hear the rest.
“Fine.” Harry sighed, but before he started to walk on, he reached out a hand and pulled the hood of Draco’s dark cloak further down his face, so that only his mouth could be seen.
“Blonde gits who try to copy your quidditch moves.” Harry grinned, his eyes glossy as he looked at Draco.
“Alright...” She sounds unconvinced but leaves him to get ready.
“What are you doing? Last time I checked you had a horse of your own!”
“Oh shut it.”
“So, what lessons do we have today?” Asked Harry after a sudden burst of motivation had hit him from seeing Draco studying so hard.
“Come on, Jules.” He says as he sits down on the large grey rock that lets him have a great view of the sun-lit lake. Juliet makes her way through the thick ferns and lays down next to Draco, her tail swishing against Draco’s back.
“Yes, Madame Pomfrey” Malfoy scowled. He turned to look at Harry and scoffed.
It’s not hard to figure where’d he’d got this sudden illness from. He suddenly feels cold at the thought of water.
They stare at each other for a few moments, before Adelaide pulls Draco into a crushing hug.
softly and sweetly.
“I can’t do this anymore.” He admits into the open air. He doesn’t know if it means he can’t talk to Harry anymore, or if he can’t withhold his status and relationship with Celeste.
“Please don’t ever say sexual again, Ada.” Draco laughs.
The six o’clock bell rings.
Celeste squeezes her hand right around Draco’s bicep, and he’s about to say something to please her before the heavy doors swing open in front of him, revealing the ‘couple’ to the guests at the bottom of the staircase, all waiting in imposing dresses and grandiose cloaks on the ballroom floor.
Draco sucks in air as Harry guides himself in, the feeling much thicker and fuller than Harry’s fingers. Harry slides slowly back, testing, and Draco gasps as he thrusts forward, Harry now fully inside him.
“I think Juliet will be fine.” Draco says, his voice controlled to sound nonchalant.
“So, mate, you said you needed a new sword? Are they putting you back on the field?” Ron asked, placing his hands on the table and folding them, trying to seem business-like.
“I said not now, Adelaide.” Draco grumbled into his pillow.
Draco smiles after what seems like a while. A lot of things have been happening at once, and he doesn’t feel like himself.
Draco scratches the last sentence with layers of heavy black ink, smirking.
Draco opened his mouth to apologise, but Harry interrupted.
It’s nothing like the desperation of last night. He can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise, not from coldness this time, and truly drinks in Harry like this.
Harry woke again around 2pm, hearing whispering voices coming from the bed next to him. He could instantly tell it was Pansy Parkinson by the way she cackled and droned.
“You’ll see.”
“Ah, yes, Sire. Thank you.” Harry nodded quickly, his nerves getting the best of him.
‘Draco-‘ It read. ‘I loved this. Honestly, you should consider contacting a publisher. Now, I know you’ll disagree but if you just...’
“Of course it’s not.” Draco replies softly. “So, what happened?”
Harry’s hardly listening, his attention caught by the pounding rain outside.
“He was just, speaking his mind...?” He’s about to carry on before a there’s a tight feeling in his chest and he’s coughing hard, his hands braced on the armrest.
“Are you tired?” Harry asks, running his hand along Draco’s spine comfortingly.
Suddenly, there’s a faint beating sound coming from outside the castle gates. He stands up quickly, holding his breath and trying to focus on the noise.
“Your family goes back thousands of years.” Harry said, looking at a particularly scornful photo of what Draco read as his great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather.
The moon slowly rose, casting silver hues over the vast beach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know to be honest. I just- when I get attention from girls. I don’t like it. And I never really understood it. Then I saw Sirius and Remus together, and I felt like that was the answer. That’s what I wanted in life. I didn’t want to hug or kiss a girl, and it was because I liked boys.”
“He’s coming with us. Come on! Can’t be late...”
“You too, Muriel.” Draco laughs at the neighs that Muriel, Narcissa’s treasured deep-brown horse, creates when she is in need of attention. The two horses tower above him, and he pulls up some grass from outside and lets them eat it from his hand.
Harry wanted to ask Draco all day. He wanted to say to him if he liked sharing a bed with Harry.
“I think something bad is happening.” Harry says, staring at his feet.
“Are you having second thoughts?” She asks, concerned.
It’s not really dancing, though. Harry has his hands wrapped around Draco’s waist, swaying them in small circles around the edges of the garden. Draco presses his face against Harry’s neck, his lips resting on a small mole.
“We’re not an ordinary family, Harry. He has to meet societal requirements and for that to happen I have to comply.”
“We’re not friends, Potter. You work for me. My personal life is none of your business.” Draco chides, his arms crossing over his chest.
The first thing he sees when he wakes up early that morning are bleary green eyes, watching Draco’s slow rise. The fire has died, but there are a couple of weak rays of winter sun that catch on Harry’s face, illuminating a softness that only seems to be there when he looks at Draco.
thank you :)
Harry nodded, although it hardly looked like he was paying attention to Pierre. He was looking, sort of studying Draco’s face. Draco squirmed slightly under Harry’s gaze, whatever the meaning behind it sending shivers up Draco’s spine.
His heart nearly stops when Adelaide is at the door already.
“Harry...” He says, voice strained tight. “Need...you.” He gets out, stopping to throw his head back.
Find me on tumblr @ferretboyandpotty <3
“Whoops...” Harry said, turning back to see Draco. “Ron and Hermione will explain.” Harry quickly added, before pulling the hood onto Draco’s head and walking out. Draco followed behind again.
“Draco, where are you going?” He slurs, his eyes falling heavy. Draco slams the door shut and turns to walk to his library. Before he clips down the hallway, he lets his thoughts control him and slips to the floor. Draco would be so excited if Harry had said this with meaning, but the unstable posture and forward words had made him feel utterly embarrassed. He felt like a joke.
As a man wearing gold embroidered clothes announces the competitors, Draco can see Harry greet Ron and Hermione, who had dragged him aside from his warm-up to wish him luck. He gives them both a tight hug before his name is announced and he has to squeeze through the crowd to get to the entrance. Cheers roar through the crowds as Harry steps into the middle, Lucius being one of the loudest. Draco is clapping too, but it is hardly because it’s Harry Potter. It’s because Harry Potter looks mouth-wateringly good. Although Draco would never admit that out loud, it was the truth. Draco tried to hate that, but it was near impossible. Harry was attractive. But it didn’t mean anything. Draco can call other men attractive. Somehow he doesn’t seem to mind it at all.
Harry does, and it takes a long time for the shaking to stop and for his breathing to be at a normal pace.
Draco hauled himself off the sofa, adjusting his tunic so that it was tucked loosely into his dark green trousers, and slowly made his way to Harry.
He wants him so, so bad. But every day is a walking reminder of what he can’t have and what he has to have.
“No mistress right now, actually. I supposed that being able to have time away at this castle would give me time to think.” Harry laughs.
“M’not.” He says through chattering teeth. Draco reaches out and places both of his hands lightly on either side of Harry’s face, staring into bright green eyes.
Harry was in his library when he got back, reading a book.
Harry threw his quill and parchment across the room in anger. The ink from the quill splatted all over the opposite bed and the parchment flew through the air and landed on Draco’s bed.
(find me on tumblr @ferretboyandpotty)!
“Right, I need to put some salve on. It’s going to hurt. But you can suck it up, seeing as you’re a Knight.” Draco shrugs, smirking.
“No. You’re the best Knight in the land. According to my Father.” Draco said, coughing as he realised he had given Harry a compliment.
Halfway through his dinner, Harry saw Draco as he walked through the hall. His attention was immediately taken from the triwizard tournament conversation as he watched Draco sit at the Slytherin table, nodding at his friends at his arrival. Harry felt bouts of sympathy at the lack of joy that Draco’s friends displayed when he had joined them.
“Trust me, Jules. I know.” Draco says wistfully, watching the ducks swim around.
“It’s much more than that, you know. You’d be long gone if I hadn’t arrived to save you.” Harry lifted his chin defiantly.
“Obviously not outside. We should have it in your library.”
The wood-lined path opened up to an alleyway behind a tavern, and Harry held Draco back with a light hand to his chest, stopping him from walking any further.
Enjoy! <3
It wasn’t long before they both fell asleep again, their medications wearing their body’s out.
“You’re not stupid, Draco.” Adelaide tries reassuringly.
“I thought it’d only be fair if I taught you to fight because you taught me to dance.”
“Ah, yes.” Harry stammers out. He gives him a look of ‘I’ll see you later’ before slipping out of the room.
It’s nearly midnight once Draco fully settles into bed. He’s come up with a new routine of idly picking things and then placing them back down once he’s lost interest. When there’s a countdown to the inevitable in the back of your mind, it leaves a lot of time to fill.
“Granger, sire. Hermione Granger.” She smiled, still wary of Draco’s presence but not acting odd about it. Ron, on the other hand, stood red faced and bewildered.
“Just a bit.” Draco nervously laughed back. They walked across the grounds, stepping over the treasured Alstroemeria Lilies and onto the back path.
“Nothing at all.” Draco laughs with a grimace, knowing that he’ll have to live his life loving a women that he doesn’t love.
“I don’t need you mucking up this evening, young man.” She says sternly. “Sit down and let me fix it. Harry, don’t you have somewhere to be?”
“Celeste’s here for Christmas dinner later, isn’t she?
It’s a serious concern, but Draco can’t help but laugh. He’s just knelt on the floor, cock out and a bit of Draco’s release on his cheek, looking up at Draco with unabashed eyes.
Adelaide sighs heavily and her expression changes. “How are you feeling about Celeste?” She asks.
Harry’s now running across the muddy grass, his chain-mail more brown than silver. It appears he has won the little match, and Arthur is now firmly planted in the ground. The surrounding knights cheer and slap him on the back in a friendly manor. If Draco were to ignore the presence of the two tyrants who raised him, the castle would be his perfect haven.
