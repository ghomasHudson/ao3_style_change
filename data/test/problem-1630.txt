For lunch break, Harry called Hermione on the mobile she insisted he have (because when Hermione insisted on something, it became law by the end of the day), and found himself seated across from her at his favourite restaurant shortly after.
That night, he had fucked Harry slowly.
Draco could feel arousal shooting through his body, stirring in his pants, and he closed his eyes, breathing deeply. A tickle formed again in his stomach and this really wasn’t the appropriate moment.
“Gosh,” he said, shaking his head. “Please,” he added, willing his stupid, stupid heart to stop. beating. that. fast!
“Unhygienic?” Harry chuckled, mouth dragging lazily along Draco’s neck.
a plebe, so yes, you’re fucking one.” He collected his coat from the back of the armchair and put it on.
, right on the nose. Or the gut.
“Where is this coming from?” The roughness in his voice almost startled Harry, but at Malfoy’s puzzled expression, he went on. “I mean, okay, so there’s this bond, but… we’re definitely not
Harry frowned at him, cocking his head.
Malfoy shook his head. “No, now... You and your fitted uniform, you and your bright eyes, you and—” He stopped, biting down on his lips. “Damned Veritaserum, we should go to St. Mun—”
You can’t do anything else but comply.
“Pansy! I am so gay! Damn it! And I think my magic is going wild!”
Sex was always impossible for the most part. France had been strongly aphrodisiac for them and they spent a lot of time wanking together under the warm spray of the shower, Harry on his knees, opening his mouth to catch a taste of Draco.
“Are you serious? You don’t know anything about turtles!”
“Maybe,” he replies. He looks drunk, too, judging by the way he’s clenching the front of your shirt. Or is he…
Sighing for finally having his arms lowered, even if still blocked, Harry nodded. “Mango.”
Lunch went more or less the same. Harry had to give Malfoy an order to prepare it, much to Kreacher’s immense dismay. He didn’t stop yelling obscenities against half-bloods giving orders to pure bloods.
“Go on,” he said, and cringed as he realised it sounded more like a question. He was an auror, for fuck’s sake, he had been taught to remain calm and steady during confusing situations, but this was weird.
Potter’s cheeks tinged a deep red as he looked at Draco’s hand smeared with come. His tongue darted out to lick slowly around his lips, an automatic, anticipatory gesture. The first time Potter had asked Draco if he could do it, Draco was confused and a bit disgusted. Not that he was too picky— honestly, he’d always swallowed Potter’s spunk when blowing him, but…
Harry turned properly to him and smiled softly. He adjusted Draco’s jacket, smoothing his hand down his chest and stopping at his heart. “I learned long ago that running away is not gonna solve my problems. C’mon, Draco.”
They all gathered around the dinner table where sweets and appetisers of all sorts were splayed in front of Harry who laughed heartily and started eating and drinking with his friends.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, and forever, yes.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I mean… So yes, I may have some complicated feelings towards—”
She nodded and got up, padding to the fireplace. She took a bit of Floo Powder and firecalled Scorpius, asking him to come to their place in thirty minutes. Draco wasn’t sure it was a good idea to tell Scorpius so soon, without the two of them talking more about it, but he didn’t dare say anything.
Sighing, Harry went to the bathroom to pull himself together. A warm shower had always helped him clear his head and he took advantage of that to think about how to tell his children the news. When he got out of the shower, he still had no idea how to behave.
Without waiting for a reply, Harry sprinted towards the bedroom, clothes falling into messy heaps behind him. Draco giggled, shaking his head. If this was going to be half as arousing as their breakfast together had been, he was more than willing to try it out.
Draco opened his eyes, mouth stuffed with scrumptious tomatoes which exploded in his mouth, sending delicious drops of juice all over his tongue. Dear Lord, Draco wondered if it was possible to come only from taste stimulation.
“Good Merlin, did he say those things? Wow. That’s
Boo-boo’s eyes widened and he brought his hands to cover his mouth, a shocked expression on his face. He was shaking his head, murmuring, “no, no, no.”
Harry raised his eyes and all he saw in Draco’s gaze was the black of his dilated pupils.
to look at. The frames are deep green, they match his eye colour. Do you think he did it on purpose? He didn’t strike me like the kind of guy who’d care about those details… And, have you seen his hair? Why make a bun if strands of it keep falling out? Look, they’re falling everywhere, even on his neck…”
All the newspapers talked about him as the most eligible bachelor of the Wizarding World, people from everywhere tried to have a piece of him, and here he was, fucking with strangers in bathroom stalls, and getting drunk bonded to one of them.
What a way to start the proposal weekend, really. And — fuck! The Portkey! Draco suddenly straightened up, taking in he was on their couch, and cast a quick
“You’re mine,” Harry growls, pushing his cock to the point of almost pain into him, head spinning and balls aching.
cheesy. But I loved it. We were so clumsy, ugh, but I can’t forget how… how you took me.”
“You will.” A crazy glint lit Harry’s eyes, and for a moment, Draco’s spent cock gave a minuscule jolt.
Draco sealed his lips to control his laughter. He turned to Mr Serkin, gesturing for him to go on — one person from the catering was already replacing Potter’s missing chair with a new one and there was no need to make the thing bigger than it really was, especially if it was all part of Potter’s scheme.
Harry sucked in a breath, feeling his chest expand with the praise. He wriggled against the sheet, looking eagerly up at Malfoy.
Harry laughed, as Boo-boo, quiet until now, crossed his arms and stuck out his transparent tongue.
No need to be told twice: Draco gently pushed Harry with the hand on his back, nodding to a few people while they made their way to the window doors, snickering like two fourteen-year-olds who were trying to get out of Hogwarts at night for a snogging session.
That was not the worst of the problem, though. Once Ron and Hermione left to go home, promising to visit him the next day, Malfoy had turned serious, looking solemnly at Harry.
Draco blinked, feeling the tip of his ears go so hot he was sure he could have boiled eggs on them. Panic seized him, and he wasn’t very good at reacting to it.
“You’re mad. I knew it, but this is crazy— You’ve actually linked some of the clues with a red thread. Draco, you’re not a fucking Auror or private investigator. You took this way too seriously!”
Draco sighed loudly next to him — his attention also focussed on the scene below.
But when a gut-wrenching pain spread throughout his entire body, threatening to make Harry faint, he clenched a hand on his stomach, doubling over.
“Are you still drunk, Potter? I’m telling you we didn’t have sex! Do you seriously not remember? Or are you just being the biggest dick in history?”
Rose shouted indignantly, “MUM!” at the same time as Hugo and James, who were covering their faces with their hands.
Harry made his best puppy eyes and Draco giggled, shadows of his dimples on his cheeks.
They would chat a bit, and Draco would ask Potter to take a coffee together, for old time’s sake. Potter would say yes — he always said yes to Draco, right? — and they’d end up flirting, teasing.
Malfoy stirred his hot tea and nodded to Harry to go on, thankfully dropping the topic.
He turned to search for the phone when Harry grabbed his elbow and cupped his cheek. “Draco, love, take a deep breath and tell me what’s going on. You’re giving yourself a heart attack.”
— was too long. Definitely too long.
“There’s such a thing as a refractory period, you know.”
He pulled almost all the way out and thrust in again with two fingers, Harry writhing under him, moaning a string of ‘yes, yes, hurry up!’
Draco turned as he was waving his wand to balance the water temperature before leaving the turtles.
. “I never… And you… I’ll let you down.”
They both knew what lay inside, every year it was always the same, but it had become a tradition and they still liked to pretend they were surprised.
"Don't tell me you can still talk Parseltongue!"
"We talked!" Harry shut the door behind himself entering Ron and Hermione's new place, a cosy two bedroom just outside the city with a big garden because ‘kids grow better like this’ had been Ron’s words, the nostalgia for the Burrow starting to cut in his life.
Draco looked at him with his eyebrows raised and a stupid smile on his face. “That was a bit dramatic.”
What do you know about this?"
Shaking his head, Draco again started descending the stairs. It wasn’t the right moment to think about those things, less to have a panic attack right before everyone’s arrival. He was better now, the Manor was freshly cleaned, every bit of Dark Magic purged by the most talented curse-breakers, his nightmares diminished.
He huffed, rolling his eyes, waving a hand angrily in the air. "What's your point, Draco?"
An involuntary grin stretched Draco’s lips and he leaned on the table of his lab, cocking his hips. “Potter, do I see a pattern here?”
“Boo-boo, what’s happening?”
His voice still full of sleep, he tried to communicate as a human being. “Ginny, wha’…”
“You’re a straightforward person, I appreciate that in you.” Malfoy smiled. It looked so sincere, so bright, it made Harry’s chest ache. “But not everyone... look, people don’t always act according to their feelings, do they?”
He couldn’t stop thinking about what Hermione had said to him.
Potter only shrugged. “Maybe. What do you know, Malfoy.” He smiled and pointed to the turtle, now gently rocking with the water conjured by Draco.
Malfoy’s snort startled Harry. “Tsk,
“Please, stay,” Draco grumbled, as he closed his eyes, Morpheus calling him.
“It’s just that I know you have a ridiculous sweet tooth,” Potter replied, shrugging. He poured himself a cup of hot tea, adding a teaspoon of milk, and buttered a slice of bread.
It was the first time their mouths had touched like this. It was the closest thing they’d done to kissing and Draco was losing his mind as well as his patience.
Draco inhaled deeply — there was around a 100% possibility that the man in front of him really was Harry Potter, tanned, wearing a ridiculously short swimsuit,
That probably wasn’t the best way to start
"Oh right, yes, err… look at her shell, I think… is it normal? There’s this dot here?"
The door of the living room cracked open at that moment. “Potter? Are you awake?”
Pansy’s hand suddenly covered Draco’s, a determined expression on her face. “Draco.”
Draco smirked at Harry’s reflection in the mirror, slowing down at an almost painful rhythm. “Isn’t this why you’re marrying me?”
When she didn’t go on, Draco lost his patience. “What? What did he tell you?!”
"I'll never understand the fascination with those… phobile? Cellone? Ugh," Malfoy whispered to Harry, his face a perplexed mask.
“‘Mione, we’ve been trapped and time-travelling for the last twenty years, I swear, it’s true! Boo-boo… oh Merlin, where’s Boo-boo!?”
Expertise in what!?”
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “Do it. I’m gonna tell you after.”
"I-I got that feeling too. Do you think… I mean—"
A faint blush covered Malfoy’s cheeks, but he quickly took back, saying with a shrug, “Listen Potter, the thing is, we’re fucking and that’s great, it works like this, right? But who said enemies who fuck can’t have birthday gifts?”
,” Ron gritted out. He took a deep breath, briefly closed his eyes. “Yes, Harry,” he said, more controlled. “You’re the only one we can trust with this. Too many people still don’t like Draco and would take advantage of the situation.”
“Yeah, okay. It only happens when there’s a full moon, but I get this kind of werewolf feature and when I have sex, I… form a knot with my partner.”
Gary—Harry’s new assistant—waved a hand in front of Harry’s face. “Woohoo, are you there?”
look old because my hair is
Muttering a “’kay”, Harry opened the box and peeked inside. His eyes widened and his mouth formed a big “O” gasping loudly. He whispered, “What the fuck…”
He looks at you, leans in, bites hard on your lips. Before he can back away, you capture his lips, return the favour. His lipstick’s almost gone, now. His eyeliner is all messed up from perspiration.
“Why…” Draco starts, voice small. It’s so unlike him that Harry can’t think of anything to say, anything to do with this emotional version of Draco. “Do you like Zabini?”
. Draco widened his eyes, hoping the warmness he was feeling on his cheeks wasn’t showing up in a huge blush as he suspected.
“I am sorry about your magic. It must have been tough.”
"Wasn't he weird just a few minutes ago?" Harry murmured, crossing his arms on the table and pointing to Boo-boo with his head.
“Yeah, well,” Draco cleared his throat. “You’ll need to conjure an ocean-like environment for her, feed her, check the temperature of the water and monitor her eggs situation.”
Before he could yell something stupid at Ron, Harry turned on his heel and left the room.
He inhaled deeply, gently — at least, he hoped — pushing away Potter’s hands. “I can’t see anything, honestly,” he exhaled, briefly closing his eyes.
, he repeated for the tenth time when Ginny asked him if he was okay. He was.
You’re holding your breath: it’s painful. She cocks her head. “But Harry’s doing better lately.”
"Will you… will you come back here?"
Draco snorted, nodding and getting ready to go back to his cottage. In the heat of the moment, he had almost forgotten they were still at the beach and he couldn't wait to get more and more of Harry, finally.
Pansy overtook Draco, running down the stairs. She flew past him, giggling excitedly, her balance precarious on her high heels, a fistful of her long bright lavender dress in one hand, to avoid tripping on it.
“With reason.”
Ron said something and a red string poured from his wand, circling their fingers, pulling and tightening. As Harry watched it all happening —Ron and Malfoy dressed in their auror robes, bursting in his house smeared with blood, seemingly back from a case he had no idea they were working together on— his mind started reeling. Pieces of the puzzle slowly came together: Ron blushing and changing subjects when Harry complained Robards never assigned him any good case; Ron frequently being late at work but never telling Harry why, despite being literally one desk away…
“It’s still my turn. I like to be spanked, I like topping but don’t mind bottoming, I love taking a cock as deep as I can in my throat, I like when men pull at my hair, I’m okay with you coming in my arse, down my throat, on my face and honestly everywhere you—”
After what felt like a lifetime, Draco bit down lightly on his earlobe, breathing, “Harry, open your eyes.”
Harry was the man Draco loved.
Fuck!”
You freeze, drink in hand, as Potter’s lips part in a smirk. He gestures with a finger to call you closer.
The breeze of the evening came in once again, bringing the scent of the flowers, soothing Draco’s soul. The wireless started playing: it was one of Beethoven’s waltzes. Draco smiled at Pansy, sliding a hand on her back and taking her left hand in his right.
But she made no offer, nor gave any sign of interest. Shifting his head, Draco’s eyes rested on Potter again. Potter, who was staring back at him. They exchanged a brief startled look — Potter looked like a deer caught in headlights, doing something he wasn’t supposed to. And then a tickle made its way up again from Draco’s stomach to his cheeks.
“Draco?”
“Yes,” replied Harry. These days, he doesn’t go around winged or screeching anymore, thankfully.
“Your French pronunciation is horrible,” Draco breathed between one kiss and the other.
made us
“It’s a potion,” he had said smugly, “which induces sleep.”
Draco’s heart stopped more or less at “Harry”, his mind running once again in various pleasurable, yet
Draco reminded himself that Potter wasn’t jealous. That this was only a game.
Harry opened his mouth to reply as Malfoy added a third finger and thrust in, brushing Harry’s prostate and making his entire body shake with the need to come.
She stalked off, leaving Harry in the kitchen, wallowing in his guilt. His mind drifted off, thinking about Draco, hoping he’d had better luck. He got up and decided to go sleep in their guest room — if he’d ever be able to sleep. As soon as he walked in there, he sat down on the bed, a pounding ache making its way up to his head, as a memory invaded his mind.
He had spent an entire night grazing Malfoy’s thighs under the table of the Ministry dinner for the war orphans. Resting his hand just where the thigh meets the groin.
Pity Malfoy always had to open his mouth and ruin everything.
, yes, don’t you dare stop,” Draco whispered. He felt his strength give way as his knees buckled under the power of the orgasm that ripped out of him in waves and waves of come down Potter’s throat. Potter’s tongue was firmly pressed against Draco’s foreskin, making sure not a single drop leaked out.
“I am not!”
“Draco, language! There’s Boo-boo!”
Draco’s voice trembled when he said, “Come with me, I want to show you something.” He wiggled two fingers to a place not much further. Harry wiped the tear on his cheek, raked a hand in his hair and made to follow Draco, trying to ignore his aching heart.
“Stop it, Draco, it looks like you’re going to come at any moment. Honestly, you’re revolting.”
He stands, collects his schoolbag and hurries towards the doors of the Great Hall, unconcerned by the tears damping his face and Greg’s steps behind him.
grey?”
Ron snorted into his cup and shook his head, looking amused at Harry. "You and Malfoy should talk sometimes, it's really about time you sort things out."
It was a bit warmer, but still minimalistic. A library full of books, where Harry recognised the names of both Muggle and Wizarding authors, a desk completely empty except for a cacti plant and two parchments, and three wooden chairs.
“Bottom,” Potter said without hesitation. “Fuck, Malfoy, I want you to fuck me so hard I won’t even remember my own name when you’re finished.”
"I'd actually love to show you around."
“I don’t know.”
“Now I was thinking… I’ll give a simple order and we’ll see how long it lasts, okay?”
The problem was another. Being Malfoy’s patient was exhausting.
Neville’s there first: he fishes a flask out of his nightstand and tosses it to Harry. Harry drinks it quickly, shudders at the way it makes his stomach vibrate for a couple of seconds, and then finally flops onto his bed with a deep sigh.
Meanwhile, Draco reached them, coming to stand right next to Harry.
In a second, Harry was standing right next to Draco, his green eyes as wide as saucers. Fuck.
Malfoy’s hand on his waist shook slightly and then fell away. He had the decency to look sheepish when he spoke again. “Fuck, Potter, I did it for you! I want to be honest with you, I really want to! But if you can’t trust me—”
Potter placed the pancakes on a dish in front of Draco, biting his bottom lip. He looked so cute that Draco wanted to get up and eat
He started fucking Draco in a frantic rhythm, biting on his neck, groaning into his ear. Draco’s body was limp but responsive under him and Harry quickened his pace — he thrust in once, twice, and stilled inside of Draco, feeling him tense on the mattress, the walls of his hole clamping tight around Harry’s cock.
His voice was hoarse when he spoke. “I’m sorry, Pansy. I didn’t want to make you worry. I just—” A sigh. “I just felt overwhelmed at the idea of all those people arriving. What if they don’t like the Manor as we arranged it, what if they’ll see… they’ll discover that…”
“Oh, you saw it.”
The hand that was gripping Harry’s hair left, sliding to his ear, lightly stroking it and then Harry’s chin, pulling his face in front of Malfoy’s. His fingers traced imaginary paths all over his face until they arrived at the corner of Harry’s lips.
He quickly looked in Malfoy’s direction, to find him distractedly looking at his nails, as if nothing interesting was happening. Harry grabbed the bottle to spin it and fucking move on with this stupid game when Hermione interrupted him.
Draco didn’t have time to reply. Potter ducked his head and licked his way down Draco’s chest, digging his tongue into Draco’s navel, taking Draco’s cock in his mouth with a deep growl.
With a swish of Malfoy’s hands, two stirrups appeared at the end of the bed and the rope wrapped itself around Harry’s ankles, clasping them to the stirrups. That position used to make Harry feel extremely embarrassed and vulnerable, especially after a second spell was cast and black satin covered Harry’s wrists and tied them to the headboard.
He’s so tight.
"Oh, Harry, Draco! How did it go?"
“I don’t know,” Malfoy replied as his shoulders stiffened. It had been going on for a while now.
“Ouch! Ouch, ouch, ouch! What the fuck, get off of me! Draco, tell it to get off!”
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Draco felt panic seizing him together with the tickle and he prayed with all his being that it wasn’t…
He smiles.
“You’re good at Occlumency.”
He wanted Malfoy, right now. He needed him, he needed to have him again.
Malfoy’s eyebrows wrinkled and he side-eyed Harry, then back at Boo-boo.
“Think tomorrow. Night, Draco.”
“I really don’t think so, Gin. They didn’t put us in the sales contract. Oh wow, do you think they used it for their… sordid affair?” Astoria was lightly laughing, a few tears stuck on her lashes.
"Shut up! I did pull someone in the end!"
Draco smiled, feeling stupid the second after he did so. Post-orgasm Draco was dangerously soft and cuddly.
He laid on the bed again, holding Malfoy’s gaze. “Okay.”
“I know why you took it. Voldemort was evil, he probably put you in a threatening situation. You must have felt trapped. New question, then.”
Sure enough, there she was, kneading some weird stuff on the kitchen table. As soon as she saw Harry, her concentrated face twisted into one of pure anger. Some dried tears were stuck on her cheeks, like arid rivers ploughing the side of the mountains.
And so here they were. Draco looked like the most precious and beautiful thing to ever walk on Earth, sleeping so peacefully, murmuring and lightly shifting on the bedsheet.
That was how Harry discovered he was a quarter Veela. He had freaked out, scrambling out of his bedroom and Floo’ing to Ron and Hermione’s place while he was, yes, still very naked. And yes, while still equipped with wings and screeching.
He tugs at your hair and you stop, pull out. He puts his leather trousers back on, says, “That was fun,” and he’s out of that bathroom —and, you think, of your life— faster than when he used to catch the snitch back in school.
“Nothing,” Harry said, quickly turning to retrieve the teapot and pour two cups of tea. “How was your day?” he asked as he levitated the cups to the table.
When he was in his bed, Teddy yawned and looked at Draco with his eyes already half-closed, asking him to sing a lullaby. For the second time, Harry stayed mesmerized, listening to Draco, his voice reaching Harry’s soul and taking its space into his heart.
The movement made them both tremble and tip over the edge — as the rain stopped raging, the only sound on the beach was that of their bodies slinging together, their mingled groans and cries, and with a last thrust Draco came deep into Harry, memories from their past sweetening the moment.
for you, Boo-boo?”
There was no way they’d work without it.
The knot is fully formed now. Harry feels his balls tightening as he starts coming, filling Malfoy’s hole with shot after shot. They both know it’s just the beginning.
“I think I don’t want to know what you’re talking about.” Ron’s voice surprised Harry, who almost choked on his eggs. He cast a quick glance to Malfoy who, on the other hand, was smirking like a Cheshire cat.
Harry’s breath hitched and his cock throbbed in his pants; he could already feel pre-come dampening the fabric. “Yes, please,
Of the thousands of scenarios Draco had imagined for tonight, not one was even remotely as good as the reality. He snorted, incredulous.
“We don’t want to know, dad!” James rolled his eyes, exasperated.
Blinking hard, Harry tried to refocus and calm himself down. The air had started to crack again around them. “You
Ron’s grin lit up his entire face. It was unsettling to witness such an intense moment of happiness. Draco only wished Pansy were here to see it, and not him.
Harry hadn’t spared one thought about Lucius Malfoy, had stopped reading journals early, sick of the way they misled information. Especially about his own life.
Almost, until Ron landed in Harry’s living room covered in ash, exclaiming: “We may have found a solution.”
She wiggled her eyebrows and glanced at Ginevra, who nodded at her. “Well, we were walking by the river, you know, and we were talking about the divorce… your upcoming wedding… and how we should have bought a gift for you, on top of other things?! And we may have been a bit tipsy…”
All during their meal, they kept things light-hearted until they brought Teddy to bed. It was an incredibly intimate moment, where Harry felt all the warmth of a welcoming house, of love and caring for the little ones. Those feelings he never experienced as a child himself and would have never imagined sharing with Draco Malfoy.
“C’mon!”
He couldn’t fucking believe it.
He flushes: it looks so pretty it makes you want to break him more.
Boo-boo swallowed visibly, even for a ghost.
“Damn, Draco, so good for me.” Harry smacked a kiss on the hole, lightly dragging his teeth over the puffy rim, then soothing it immediately with his tongue. To Draco, it felt like he was burning up from the inside out, and to his surprise, his cock was already half-hard.
A second later, the feather was stroking right across Harry’s arsehole, the tip lightly pushing in and Harry was glad he could move because he arched his back and the feather slipped just that bit inside of him and Harry trembled, feeling pre-come leaking out of his cock.
“Took you long enough,” Potter said. His voice was thick as if he was simply resting on Draco’s sofa and felt at peace with the whole world.
“Okay, let me rephrase that. Does being an auror make you happy?”
Malfoy finally came back into a normal standing position, and smiled at Harry.
Three years had passed, they were thirty when they left, thirty-three now. Harry still couldn’t see the difference between the normal colour of Draco’s hair and the grey, but he could see his own beard turning greyish and the whiter strands in his hair perfectly fine.
He almost greeted the fucker with a smile, reassurance warming his entire soul. He was almost free. Draco didn’t seem to be as forgiving, and when he saw Jacob, he wasn’t able to refrain from some scathing lines, bullying him around and using his patented sneer and ‘you’re a dead man’ gaze.
Draco Malfoy rarely looks like this.
Draco moaned, unleashing a series of, “yes, mmh, Harry, good,” half sleepily, half roughly.
“Close your mouth or you’ll catch flies,” Malfoy teased, sipping his firewhiskey so calmly it was starting to unnerve Harry.
skills as a repairman. He can bring
it,” Harry whispered. He sucked in a breath, before thousands of questions formed in his mind. He needed to play his cards well.
“We’ll help them choose their robes.”
“Excuse me?” He hissed, a storm brewing in his eyes.
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy put the tray on the coffee table next to the couch. “I’m babbling. Sorry.”
Draco nodded and reached the door, exiting without saying a word and going to the kitchen. He needed a cup of chamomile before going to sleep.
Harry stopped his maddening pacing to look at her, her calm smile, her bright eyes. Malfoy was looking at her with his eyebrows wrinkled, his face a painting of doubts and questions but she sounded confident, and if there was a person Harry trusted with his life, it was Hermione Granger.
“Okay. Can you spin yourself around?”
spell on it.
“Funny you say that. He said something similar.”
Harry followed, as his friends started to greet him — Luna, Seamus, Dean, a couple of colleagues from work, Ron and Hermione.
“If you want, I can charm it so that it will change with your stories, too.”
Harry was barely holding it in, he could taste bile in his throat. All these Hops in time were too rapid and abrupt — their bodies didn’t have time to adjust; and they didn’t have a chance to understand where they were or in what timeline.
He sighed and turned his head, finding an empty bed — Malfoy went back home, as per usual. He scratched his eyes and extended an arm to grab his glasses on the nightstand, finding a note next to them.
“Let’s
“Sometimes I feel like I might die if I don’t see him for twenty-four hours. Or when he talks to other blokes. It’s worse if I feel aroused around him—”
So, Potter wasn’t angry. He was just playing, as always.
Harry stared as Malfoy turned and stalked off towards the bedroom, giving him the perfect view of his perky arse. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, wondering about what Malfoy had possibly bought him.
“Draco calm down. I can feel the pendant getting warmer. What was going on between Potter and you?”
When he finished dirtying Draco’s face, Potter smiled, looking satisfied. He stared into Draco’s eyes and then his tongue peeked out between his flushed lips, the tip of it touching Draco’s cheeks to lick away any trace of chocolate from his face. Potter’s breathing looked laboured too, quick puffs reverberating on Draco’s skin, making him shiver.
Potter’s arms encircled Draco’s shoulders from behind, his voice now low and purring into Draco’s ears.
“Really, though, how was it?” Harry asked, leaving open kisses along Draco’s neck.
Malfoy's eyebrows finally relaxed and a little smirk stretched his lips. "But if we're somehow involved in one of your
You also avoid pointing out that he’s the one who asked you to call him a whore.
He thinks he hears Malfoy mumbling in his sleep.
“Okay now you’re starting to piss me off!” Harry straightened up, painfully aware of his empty stomach. “Tell me what’s happening!”
and… is this the last Peachy Witchy’s perfume? It’s incredible.” The strong musky scent hit Draco’s nostrils and he couldn’t mistake it — he always thought it was a bit sour, reminding him of the rum his father used to drink every night, but it smelled very good on Fleur.
Hermione took his hand and launched herself in a wild series of movements. Draco pulled her towards himself, trying to redirect her feet, to give her a sense of rhythm. After about five times, he gave up, screaming in horror instead.
Potter smirked, putting away the abused strawberry to dig his fingers in the chocolate. Draco watched, helpless.
Suddenly, he remembers everything. He remembers approaching Draco at the prom—Harry was tipsy, but it was just the right amount to give him the courage he needed.
“I had a horrible time with you today,” Harry said, without hesitating. The Veritaserum had worn off, but he still felt giddy and light-hearted. “What we did was appalling,” he continued. “And I don’t want to see you ever again.”
It took some months to recover from everything, but in the end, they rebuilt their lives together. Harry opened a flower shop, helped by Neville’s expertise and Draco continued his work as a Curse-Breaker.
“Tell me what to do and I’ll do it, master.”
"I made it myself, you know Malfoy. You should feel honoured."
Harry inhaled and thanked Merlin that the waitress arrived with their order, giving him time to compose himself.
Draco was still holding his breath since hearing Harry call him
They laughed, Harry finally relaxing into Draco’s embrace. He brought his face to Draco’s, his lips brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. With a purr that made goosebumps pop over Draco’s skin, he said, “Now, what if I really could give it all to you? Food, sex and love?”
"What the fuck are you doing, Potter?!"
Something sticky touched his lips and Draco opened his mouth, sticking out the tip of his tongue to lick at the object pushing against it. It was sweet— almost too sweet.
"I wish I could, Harry. Believe me, I've spent the last four days searching for solutions, for ways to break it, but… it could be dangerous. The best way to undo it, is to have both of you present. The bond is incomplete, as I told you, something went wrong when Jacob cast it. That's lucky on one side, that’s what kept you from dying. Moreover, the dot which should be on your chest hasn't appeared. That means you're not compelled to love him—"
“No, I’m not drunk! Zabini, for fucks sake, what are you talking about?”
“Right, they target muggles but we couldn’t possibly use a real muggle for bait, could we? So I glamoured myself and made them notice me. Soon enough they captured me and brought me to their base. Long story short, I discovered they use muggles for sex trafficking and magical experiments, to see how magic reacts on them.”
“You should go, for now. We’ll talk again later.”
“Yes, I think she’ll be there. Draco, this means we would, you know, come out to the Wizarding world as a couple. Is that okay?”
“Oh really, like what? Like how he’d always supported Pureblood supremacy without being an actual pureblood?” Harry wasn’t sure if Hermione was more annoyed or angry— either way, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were gleaming, like when she’d caught Rita Skeeter and finally had the occasion to punish her.
“I…” his voice too sounded like he had just drank half the water of the ocean. “Could you lower your wand? I don’t know what… It’s not. It doesn’t usually
Harry woke up with a start, every inch of his body aching and a pounding headache.
"Why not a coffee together? You know, I was thinking some things about this time travelling, I'd like to discuss them."
“Yes, sorry.”
Ron and Hermione rolled their eyes. Hermione took a sip of her cappuccino before replying. "Did you say hi?"
"I'd better go change."
What the fuck was happening? Was Potter trying to make a show of himself and scare everyone away? Was this his way to get revenge against Draco? First the portrait, now this. If it wasn’t a plot, then Potter probably really was
Harry had grown almost fond of using the Cloak — by now it was the moment he could feel the closest to Draco, when his scent spread in every air cell around Harry, making Harry wonder about the man he loved, fantasise of when they'd be back in the hotel and he could feel that scent on his body.
Draco felt his cheeks growing hot; he hadn’t wanted a big reunion with the Granger-Weasleys too, but it seemed that everyone thought it was necessary to start to be comfortable with each other again.
are going to do it, and
“—However,” Ron went on, his grin now wide, amusement evident in his tone. “That’s not the reason I asked. I… needed to talk to you. About… something.”
A big regal horse and an elegant phoenix were glowing blue and they started relaying their wives’ message together. “We are headed to your house at the beach. Don’t search for us. Enjoy your alone time, hubbies.”
“Bill, how nice to see you. I am sorry I didn’t have the chance to come and say hi earlier.” Draco held out a hand, only to receive a loud pat on the shoulder from Bill.
Pansy shrugged, squeezed his arm. “A handshake?”
Actually, Harry had no idea as to why he was talking to Draco. He couldn’t resist it and he hoped that something would pass to Draco through the potion. Moreover, it was true. Harry had always loved how warm Draco was during nights; his body temperature was always heated and it sent his arousal to spikes he had no idea he could reach.
Harry snorted, and cursed himself for the affection that gushed through him. “I like them, Malfoy. After all, they’re a sign you think about me every day.”
“Well, that’s because it’s true. I
“Honey, something’s missing.”
Harry sat down, leaning back against the trunk next to Malfoy, trying to ignore the mad speed of his own heartbeat. He was sure Malfoy could hear it for how loud it was pounding.
It took a moment for Draco to take in their presence. Then he remembered, he remembered the first months after the War, his mother just condemned to ten years in Azkaban, his father Kissed by the Dementors.
Harry was listening carefully, nodding along with Geremia’s words, waiting for him to continue, when Malfoy gasped next to him, exclaiming, “Us! We are your guinea pigs!”
Hermione was smiling at them, the folder with all the records of their trips in her hand, quill ready.
"It probably rebounded in some way. It could have also damaged Jacob's magical core for all we know, this bond requires a high level of accuracy to cast. Boo-boo, please check his movements."
Harry turned to him, matching Draco’s smile. “What about us? Are we going back home… together?”
His friends were now openly laughing, cheering Luna and nodding, as if sharing some knowledge Harry was unaware of.
^^^^^
“Thankfully, no one has ever decided to use my fear of Dementors against me, especially not during a Quidditch match.”
“Potter talks about me?”
They laughed, drank, danced to the moon, singing off-pitch notes but synced hearts.
A smile was pulling at his boyfriend’s lips. Draco scowled.
Harry nodded. “I was thinking the same.”
Harry closed his eyes, trying to picture what Draco would be going through right now. He was probably having a better moment anyway, as Astoria was less inclined to screaming and making scenes.
“Okay, first of all, that’s only our conjecture. I could declare my love tonight and Harry could laugh his arse off and tell me goodbye. Second, this is beyond that, Pansy! We’re talking about a chef who’s so talented they make a salad look like the most exciting thing in life. I
“You know,” Draco’s voice was breathy but steady, “you were so sexy before, sucking my fingers…”
Draco bumped his shoulder against Potter’s, feeling his heartbeat race at impossible speed against his ribcage.
“About time, Potter. I’d punish you, but today’s your birthday. I’ll leave you one, sweetheart.”
Harry’s blood rang in his ears, reality and memories fusing in a unique feeling, the one of Malfoy’s body pressed against his.
It became routine. Every morning Draco would wake up, have a shower, breakfast and go to his lab, a thrill exciting him, the possibility of seeing Potter again.
Taking a fortifying breath, he made his way toward the bedroom, slowly pushing the door open.
In the end, Teddy’s loving eyes convinced him to stay even for dinner.
He blamed it on two things: the rain —
Well. Two could play at that game.
“When I… every time I met someone whose name started with an ‘H’, I was so dreamy, like,
A new, hot, quick feeling pervaded Harry: anger. And immediately, the air started crackling again.
They stared at each other, Harry’s mouth open in surprise. They didn’t dare say anything else. During their walk home, Boo-boo joined them again, asking what happened but neither of them felt like saying anything.
“Why not? t’s fun. Got good food with zero,
Rolling his eyes, Draco drawled, “Hello to you too, Harry.”
Harry smiled, loosening his grip on Malfoy’s waist, but not removing his hands. He sneaked them under Malfoy’s scrubs, instead, tracing light paths on his ribs. Malfoy quivered under his touch, his lips parted on a soft moan.
Ron lifted his eyes. “It really is,” he sputtered, hand reaching for his glass of wine.
“Harry! Draco! What are you doing out here?” Hermione appeared apparently out of nowhere, followed by Ronald, who nodded to them, smiling like a fool. Draco remembered Hermione’s earlier words and thought that the weasel seemed indeed pretty much dazed out with alcohol, his balance precarious judging by the way he was clutching Hermione’s arm.
Malfoy turned his head to Harry, a playful smile tugging at his lips. “Dear, please, don’t tell me you’ve gone and fallen in love with me!” He put a theatrical hand on his chest and Harry couldn’t hold back the laughter that tumbled out of him.
Harry laughed. This chatty version of Malfoy was funny and it might serve Harry well in his mission to uncover Malfoy’s secrets. He crossed the distance to Malfoy’s counter, sitting on a stool in front of him.
Then Draco whimpered and snuggled closer to Harry, searching for him in his sleep. And Harry couldn’t resist anymore. He slid off Draco’s pyjama bottoms and underwear carefully, slowly, just enough to make his cock fall out. It was still soft and Harry’s breath hitched — before he could change his mind again, he ducked his head under the blankets, brushing a small kiss to Draco’s soft cock.
“Gods, fuck, of course I want to,” Potter had replied, short of breath himself. He shifted on the bed. “I should go, shouldn’t I?”
“Shut up!” Harry lightly shoved him back, standing up.
Harry froze, his mind racing. They never had to reaffirm their rules, they were ordinary habit by now. What the fuck did the prat have in mind?
“I didn’t! I told you, I didn’t want to do it with him!” Harry’s now sitting upright on his bed, head still pulsing. “I-I think it wasn’t him… Can we know who Confunded me, ‘Mione?”
Harry's eyes snapped to him, his eyebrows flying to his hairline.
They looked at each other, beaming like two teenagers in love. Harry reached out to take Draco’s hands on the table in his and murmured, “So, to another twenty years together?”
. It was still in his pocket.
"I know it too by now!" Boo-boo exclaimed, clapping his thin hands soundlessly, floating between the two of them.
After a tense silence, Harry relaxed against his seat, took courage to say the last part: “I don’t— there’s no need for us to…
It was enormous. It didn’t even have the shape of a cock. It resembled more a tentacle with pads on its length. The tip was smaller, almost a decent size, but every 3 centimetres it grew wider more and more, until the diameter was obscene. The colouring was disturbing too; it was all green with red stripes that looked like flames.
“Oh, don’t worry, we can do that for you.”
“I’ll stop you right there. This clearly isn’t working and I’m a professional, I don’t want to work with you in these conditions. Perhaps we should have listened to Granger’s advice. From now on, you’re calling me Mr Malfoy and I’m calling you Mr Potter.”
Harry hadn’t been able to tear his eyes off of them for the entire duration of the kiss, not even after it broke. He just followed every single move Malfoy made until Malfoy had looked up and they made eye contact.
am the magi-zoologist here.”
They came together, in a synced chant of “god, Malfoy,” and “oh! P-Potter, fuck!” Draco almost forgot but in a swift motion, he dropped his hand to Potter’s cock, clamping down hard around its head, collecting the spunk in his fist as Potter fucked into it.
on both of them and starting to dress. “First let’s go home, shall we?”
"Oh no," Harry whispered, panic making cold sweat puddle on his back and neck.
She leaned her head in the crook of his neck, as she had always done. “Just for tonight.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed, still looking at the door.
“I think the Veritaserum has worn off, so you’re safe to go, since you’re in such a hurry to get out,” Malfoy continued. He was staring at the inside of the cauldron, but Harry could see the crease on his forehead, the tension in his body.
Right. So, there he stayed. Hating him and desperately wanting to get into his pants at the same time.
Draco looked around, panicking, when he saw that only one cubicle was occupied. Trust Potter to need the loo when no one else did! He froze in the middle of the atrium of the bathroom, not knowing what to do, the tickle spreading through his body, when a voice came from Potter’s cubicle.
Trust
“Who’s next?”
Harry turned with a big grin plastered on his face. “Draco!” He ran to him, covering the few metres that separated them and launched himself into Draco’s arms, kissing him on the cheek. “Is it too soon to tell you I missed you?”
Mrs Darsley smiled, nodding several times, saying that ‘it was a marvellous idea, Circe knows how much the Manor needs new purposes.’ Draco politely smiled in response, saying his greetings and finally walked through the ballroom, into the gardens.
“I should have known you’d bring me to Sweet Prophecies. You’ve got an obsession, mate.”
She pointed to the black box, carefully prying it from Harry's hands.
“I want you to fuck me,” he had murmured, sending shivers down Harry’s spine. “While I’m asleep. Until completion.”
“Yesterday?” Draco asks, voice suddenly thin. His brain is trying to put together the pieces of the puzzles but they all look completely unrelated. “That’s… impossible.”
“Potter, please, let me finish. And don’t jump to conclusions as usual. Severus, he told me he knew about us. He said it was dangerous, that Voldemort would have killed me the moment he’d seen in my mind I loved you. I didn’t know Snape was a spy at the time, but he scared me. It got me thinking… and I feared Voldemort would have used our relationship to get to you… I… Harry, I know now I didn’t make the wisest choices, but—”
, ogle you when we work out, I always make an excuse to touch your arms or your hair.”
“Your treehouse!” Right on one of the oaks stood proud Draco’s treehouse. It was unlike anything Harry could have ever imagined: it was huge, with wooden stairs to reach it, big enough to actually fit grown ups too.
Potter lowered his gaze, staring at Draco’s cock with half-lidded eyes, his tongue swiping out to lick his lips and then the glistening tip of Draco’s cock. The appearance of Potter’s tongue had Draco exhaling loudly, anticipation prickling over his body.
And yet, there had been years, when he was a kid, before Hogwarts, when the Manor had seemed the best place he could have ever imagined to live. Draco heard bedtime stories about knights and princes, and he would always relate to them — the Manor was his castle, with a little lake, his personal quidditch practice grounds, immense gardens.
Harry turned to him, placed a kiss on his neck. "Me too," he said. "Shall we go, er, somewhere we don't risk other people seeing us?"
"I'm sorry, Boo-boo, if this will be annoying," Harry said, throwing a little smile to the ghost who seemed completely unbothered by their conversation, too busy staring and seemingly studying them.
When the yellow car stopped by them, Malfoy let out a scandalised screech, declaring he'd "never get in a thing so precarious", but following Harry nonetheless.
Malfoy laid down on the bed next to Harry and pulled him to straddle his lap, never taking off his eyes from Harry’s face. He brought a hand behind his neck and drew Harry closer, whispering to his ear, “Tell me if it's too much.”
“The fuck are you doing here?” he asks as if he isn’t the one who’s intruding on you. He’s not wearing a costume, but his lips are black like the thick foliage of the Forest at night.
“Fuck,” Draco said. The world was spinning around him, and Harry’s hand was suddenly on his back, holding him upright.
. I know what you want to know,” Malfoy continued, raising an eyebrow. “I have Veela blood.”
They all nodded, and Harry exited the kitchen, heading to the living room, standing in front of the Floo Fireplace. Surely, if Scorpius had called them, he had already talked with Draco and hopefully, he and Draco could meet now. He grabbed a pinch of Floo Powder when he felt a finger poking his back. He turned to see Albus looking at him with an embarrassed smile.
Mrs Darsley cleared her throat, speaking up. “C’mon, Draco, don’t be rude. You’re the
“Okay, you’ve had far too much drinking tonight, love. Draco, excuse us.” Just a moment before they disappeared amongst the dancing couples, Bill turned and winked at Draco, mouthing ‘go’.
The strong smell of coffee flooded Draco’s nostrils, waking him up. If he had to choose a last desire before death, it would be to wake up to the scent of a strong cup of coffee wafting through his house.
“How dare you! Draco would never—”
“But Potter, the library is incredible! I won’t believe for a minute it’s yours.”
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy didn’t sneer or tell him to fuck off. He squared his shoulders, looked Harry in the eyes, and said, “Because I like it.”
“I am not scared, but! It’s pecking my arse! Do something! Wait!” He batted a hand on the peacock’s neck, trying to push it off. “Is this your magic again?”
Harry felt his heart sink to his stomach at the way Boo-boo's voice broke asking that, feeling his mouth go dry as he attempted to answer.
Draco shook his head, trying to hide his amusement. “This is stupid, Potter. Thanks for bringing her here. She must have lost track of her bale, because… well, she’s blind.”
“Erm, I think that my magic is… that you triggered it. Because…” He glanced off, behind Harry’s head, in search of the right words. Caught a glimpse of Pansy and Blaise together: he was leaning in to tell her something and she laughed, cupping his face. Still laughing, she moved her gaze and found Draco’s eyes; smiled fondly, raised a thumb up to him.
at Occlumency,” Malfoy snarled, slapping a hand on his desk. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. “But I’m not using it now. This was a mistake. Let’s just wait in silence from now on. I need to finish the potion.”
, needed to get a grip on himself.
The idea of feeling it swell in his mouth made Harry’s blood rush south and he didn’t waste any more time. He took a deep breath and slipped Draco’s cock between his lips, moaning at the sensation of having it all in his mouth, trembling in anticipation. Soon enough, Draco’s cock had filled entirely, and Harry bobbed his head to let it stretch his lips, hearing Draco groan. He glanced up but saw him still fast asleep, only the crease between his eyebrows a sign of what was happening. And his hardened cock, of course.
Moreover, it helped distract Harry from the embarrassment of watching himself get drunk and flirt, with Malfoy at his side doing a commentary like the ones Lee used to do at Hogwarts.
Pansy snickered, cocking her head to the side. “Ah, to be young and have secrets… and being in love!”
“Sure. You go, guys, I’ll stay here and… I don’t know. Check if people arrive early, or, the tables, the festoons… Do you think I should raise the temperature? Is it cold?”
sending Harry all the articles that talked wonders about Malfoy's successes, assuring him it would only be a matter of days, weeks tops.
“I honestly thought I’d have an anxiety crisis much sooner and would have had to leave before this time. So, no idea. Not disappointed with how the evening developed, though.” He tentatively started stroking his thumb on Potter’s back as well, rewarded with a light blush covering his cheeks.
The Time Machine seemed to be working, even if it made Harry and Malfoy sick to their bones.
Draco blinked. “When I do
Harry ran to him, fearing the worst. He threw the door open to find Draco standing in front of the mirror, his hands in his hair.
‘Perfectly normal,’ thought Draco, ‘to show up at a formal event looking like a greaser. And what, what’s that thing at his eyebrow… a
He entered his wooden cabin sighing loudly, slumping on the couch, the
, or the fireworks or… nothing of my perfect, perfect plan…”
“You’re right, Blaise. He has his guilty face.” Pansy leans in as if to study Draco’s face better. “It’s like when you were trying to convince us you’re not gay saying you’re simply not straight. What’s up, Draco?”
He was late, he always was. He entered Andromeda’s running, barely closing the door behind himself and sprinting towards Teddy’s room. He almost missed her “Hi, Harry!” in his haste to reach Teddy… and Malfoy. He needed to be certain he met the real Malfoy the last time and not just a faker but kinder… well, also, more handsome, version of him. The whole thing stank to Harry.
They agreed to meet up again the next day, and as soon as they were set up, Malfoy sprinted towards the exit, Hermione in tow, and Harry rushing to keep up.
“I told Ginny you would wear crowns.”
You say it in one breath. Potter’s arms clutch around you. “You saved my life, too.”
With the other hand, he rips the buttons of your shirt open, trails a finger on your chest. Your other marks are there, the ones
— used to torture his victims and he’d fall to the ground, hands on his ears to shield them from the cries, the shouts erupting. He’d shut his eyes tight, muttering under his breath,
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, watching in front of them. “So…” He kneeled, laying Lady Luck on the sand. He waved a hand to her and muttered, “Bye, Lady Luck.”
Hermione blinked at him, snickering quietly. “Ah, I see. Yeah, I guess you could do better. But Harry’s not here tonight, is he?”
It’s violent, the pace you’ve set up. You’re unrelenting, now, brushing his secret spot with every thrust, and Potter’s squirming, shivering frantically. His legs are trembling, his stomach keeps clenching and unclenching.
“I don’t want to see it!” Ron slapped a hand on the table to make his point clear, but Lily was already reaching behind Harry and Draco’s seats, with a red blush spreading on her cheeks. She sneaked the package from Harry’s hands and went back to her seat next to Hermione. “It can’t be that bad!” The girls looked inside and burst out laughing so hard that they almost fell off their chairs.
She stopped, taking a breath, thank Merlin. Draco thought she was gonna choke on her own words.
Harry finally turned to face him. His head was throbbing and he felt drained of every ounce of energy.
“For saving my life. After the war and—” you feel your voice break. You swallow thickly. “And now. Every day.” You take a deep breath, manage to calm down enough to add, “I don’t want to get married to Astoria.”
He was annoying, really. And his voice absurdly irritating. Not at all one of the reasons why Harry’s cock was throbbing in his pants. He cleared his throat, hoping his voice wouldn’t show just how much he was already affected by Malfoy’s presence.
He sucked in a breath and lingered a bit longer, Draco’s lips feather-light on his, his tea taste the faintest on Harry. A tear rolled down Harry’s cheek.
Harry, you know if you keep ordering me around like this I’m not going to last!”
That’s how
Harry felt his stomach sink minutely at Hermione's words. They couldn't, of course.
Malfoy gave him a curious look and then turned his head again, looking to the horizon, miles of green forest before their eyes.
“You have wings—” Ginny croaked, suddenly going still.
“Bye guys! Aaaah, how much I used to love balls. Dance for me too!” She waved a hand to them, a veil of nostalgia crossing her smile.
With the last few thrusts, Draco came completely untouched with one of his strongest orgasms. Spent, he closed his eyes, while Harry Disapparated them both to the bedroom and let himself slip into the arms of Morpheus.
Harry daydreamed about that next time, about them chatting over dinner, laughing, telling funny anecdotes with Teddy, maybe even talking more serious stuff, something about the War? How they were dealing with the aftermaths?
coconut biscuits.
"Malfoy, for Merlin's sake! Boo-boo! I… let's go!!!"
Malfoy’s cheeks were blotched red, and his lips were fixed on a bright beam. “Only I get to see you like this. Beautiful, my love, gorgeous.”
What happened later had enshrined the pillars of their friendship with benefits. The trip from the door of Draco’s flat to his bedroom had been a mess of tangled limbs, and their feet bumping against one another in the darkness.
He returned his eyes at Malfoy again, at his swollen lips and disheveled hair, his eyes shining with tears too. He looked hurt, perhaps because Harry pushed him away and that thought made a new rush of anger run through Harry’s body.
Draco nodded, his eyelashes fluttering closed again. Delicate fingers brushed his cheek and he didn't dare open his eyes again — if this was a dream, he wanted it to last some more.
Harry smiled, feeling loved and lucky to have them even if in such a difficult moment. He took a sip of his beer and decided to do as he always did, and use sarcasm.
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s shirt and pushed him back, strongly, until he hit the wall. He pressed him there with his chest, their noses bumping together.
, had expectations. Robards already had a desk at the Aurors for Harry, and
again, huh? That’s what you’ve replaced me with?”
Once back at Hotel ‘The Compass’, they didn't spare a second before locking themselves in the room Harry booked, sighing in relief at the warm air and the comfort of a soft bed and pillow.
You hadn’t realised how much you were used to Potter until he disappeared, right after the first time the
“I just asked you if I can bring Lady Luck with me.”
“Ew, Herm! Don’t ever again put such images in my mind!”
There was a heavy silence for a few minutes before anybody spoke. Draco bit his lip to restrain the cold answer that was already there — old habits. He inhaled deeply, counting to ten, and replied, “You really think that? Because I’m done feeling guilty for who I am, Harry. For as much as I care, we could hang a big giant pink banner outside our house saying we are gay and soon-to-be-married too.” He tried to say it in the steadiest way possible, but his hand flew to his left arm, rubbing it nervously.
Hermione sighed before straightening her shoulders and speaking. “You’re right. Sorry if I bothered you. Look, it’s not a problem for me! We broke up over a year ago and it was my decision, I just don’t understand why he doesn’t talk to me anymore. Er, well, I mean. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I broke up with him, but— “
But neither Alicia nor Malfoy, nor Hermione and Ron for that matter, were saying anything more.
Ron and Hermione stood to come back next to Harry — Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder with a disgusted face. “Bloody hell mate, the ferret… really!?”
Draco took the offered page.
Oh, yes, Harry had. He felt his cheeks tingle with false modesty as his lips stretched into an involuntary grin. He hadn’t been 100% fair yesterday night to Malfoy, but the sex had been so good he had reached a point he felt dizzy and drunk and couldn’t think properly anymore.
You’re fucking Harry Potter in a Muggle pub.
When the meaning of Pansy’s words settled, though, he felt his face growing hot again, realising he still hadn’t moved his gaze from Potter. He blinked and took a sip of wine, savouring it a second before speaking up. “Silly woman, I just noticed he has a piercing and a new pair of glasses. He looks well; instead of looking like a poor lame kid, now he’s at least
"Do you call porn
Lady Luck quickly recuperated, learning to deal with the world without her sight and preparing to deliver her eggs. After weeks of sex, micheladas, and weird choices of clothing, Draco announced to Harry that they needed to free her again.
“Draco, honey, I can’t hold back anymore,” Harry said in a broken whisper, his moans louder with every slap of Draco’s arse on his cock. Draco was trembling over him, and he looked down at him with half closed lids, his breath coming in hot puffs on Harry’s face.
—unimpressed. “The feeling’s entirely mutual, Potter.”
If you had ever imagined having sex with Potter —which you definitely
“No.”
It was true. Harry had avoided choosing truth for the duration of the game; afraid he’d receive questions that were too personal, knowing that he had too many secrets about the War, about Voldemort, Dark Magic, about his past, that he absolutely couldn’t and wouldn’t share. His pathetic Occlumency skills were too poor to shield him from the three drops of Veritaserum each of them had swallowed at the beginning of the night.
Harry snorted, returning his eyes to Draco. “Fuck, Draco, if this is what happens when we kiss, I can’t imagine what it would be if we were to have sex.”
"We need to go or we'll disappear in the middle of Muggles!"
“Tori… what… I didn’t… let me finish!” Ginevra tried to go on but everyone in the room was now gasping or muttering things and the chattering was too loud.
“Wanna see what it is?” Malfoy breathed on Harry’s mouth but didn’t give him time to reply because he slowly licked Harry’s bottom lip, sucking it between his teeth. He released it, breathed again, “Mh, do you,
Before he could help himself, Draco burst out laughing so hard he had to bend over at the waist and lay his hands on his knees. “Dear Salazar, Harry Potter is scared of a peacock.”
Harry knew, he knew that the pet name served as a reminder of their positions, of his place, but he couldn’t avoid the contented whimper that escaped his lips at hearing Malfoy call him ‘sweetheart’ with that soft tone.
“Err, I wanted to ask you…” Potter reached Draco’s position and sat next to him, their thighs brushing.
As soon as the guests spotted Draco and Astoria at the end of the veranda, silence fell over them. Narcissa had wanted to accompany him to the altar, but Astoria had insisted she wanted to do it. They were standing hand in hand, ready to walk towards Harry.
So why did Draco find it so fucking endearing? Potter licked
Malfoy had not one hair out of place.
Draco chuckled, remembering Potter’s words:
"Oh nothing, you look like one of those pompous old wizards in the Hogwarts portraits and—"
close, master, I—” he was an incoherent babbling mess. When Malfoy’s hole finally gave way, Harry plunged his tongue in, mercilessly pounding into Malfoy.
Another step forward. Now Harry’s lips were so close that every word he pronounced vibrated on Draco’s own lips. “Care to learn, now?”
Harry swallowed thickly, trying to resist the impulse to grab Malfoy and snog the everloving life out of him right there.
He grasps your left arm, rolls the sleeve up. Your mark is red, stained, but very much there, and he’s looking at it.
As if summoned by Harry’s thoughts, Hermione walked in that moment, steps hurried and hair a mess, talking on her mobile.
Harry pulled out slowly and slammed in stronger, feeling his orgasm arise hard in his balls. He wanted to make sure Draco would come in his sleep too, like that first time, when Harry was woken up by Draco having a sex dream.
“I—” Harry couldn’t even talk. Malfoy always reduced him to that incoherent mess, only able to beg and arch to take more and more and
Harry groaned and grabbed his glass of firewhiskey, downing it in one go. This was the kind of secret he’d wanted to take with him to his grave. He looked around the circle, and saw the Slytherins giggling with smug faces, that pug face of Parkinson already whispering with Blaise, Ron and Hermione looking at him with wrinkled eyebrows, Ginny looking hurt.
The rest of their meal proceeded smoothly, with laughter and conversation, gossip about the latest pureblood marriages, their former classmates’ lives, all accompanied by the finest spaghetti Bolognese Draco ever had and sea bream fillets which made Draco’s toes curl in his Gucci shoes.
“‘Mione!” Harry shot back, surprised.
Geremia answered, “You’ve been away for barely one hour. Did something go wrong?”
“I’ll be here, right next to you, honey.” Pansy said. “I’m not leaving you.”
“Shall we—”
Malfoy’s chest was rising and lowering quickly with his heavy breathing. “Such a mouth, Harry…” He grabbed Harry’s waist and turned him to face the wall, pressing his hard cock on Harry’s arse cheek.
Harry did look away from the pitch now to throw a shy smirk to Draco, who was looking at him, a light blush covering his cheeks.
Malfoy tightened his hand around Harry’s wrist in response, and raised his head, his eyes serious. He cast a wandless and wordless spell, black silk laces appearing at Harry’s wrists, bringing them together and clasping them to the headboard of the bed.
Draco’s heart started beating furiously, a sudden tickle making its way from Draco’s stomach to his chest, his neck, his cheeks. What was happening to him?! He opened his mouth to say something, anything at all, when a portrait next to him clattered to the floor, with a loud thud.
It felt exactly like drinking a glass of water, refreshing and easy. Harry had observed Malfoy for so long, first at Hogwarts, then through the newspapers, that he
As soon as they entered the ballroom, Draco took his place in front of the people already there with his best fake-smile in place, the one his father taught him since he was a little child. Potter was already amongst the guests, next to Weasley and Granger, exchanging hushed conversation with them. A lily was still stuck in his bun and the image of a coy Potter full of flowers in his hair came back to Draco, eliciting a real smile from him.
“Damn, I can’t find it. How is that possible? I wanted to show you…”
Draco snorted, shaking his head. “Love, we’ve come here for the last several weeks. Yes, I can believe it.”
Malfoy stiffened next to him and coughed lightly, his fingers drawing circles on the soil under them.
“You’re all marked up, aren’t you,” he says, and fuck, you hate him. So you push out a little —as much as you can with him clamping hard around you— and thrust in so hard he’s breathless. Both his hands tighten. He bares his teeth.
“Well, I don’t know. I haven’t met people other than you and Pansy for five years. This place has been… mute, empty, sad, for so long, I… forgot what life is. It’s scary. But also… well, maybe, a little bit exciting, the idea of seeing someone else in here.”
"I'm willing to… come out. To tell the World we’re together. We could, we would—"
“You’re an idiot. Either that or you went crazy aging,” he choked out, reminding himself he shouldn’t find Potter in a lavender sundress insanely hot.
Jesus Christ. Draco Malfoy is always so tidy, so neat.
Of course, that’s why his back and arse were hurting so badly. But all in all, Harry knew he had never experienced a pleasure so intense before.
You stop dead at the sight of it, a couple of feet from him. By the stench in the air, he must be completely hammered.
Harry shivered and Draco pulled almost all the way out, lingering with only the head of his cock into Harry, and then thrust in all the way with one smooth press.
. 8 pm. They'd missed their Portkey.
“Glass of wine, sir?” Kreacher levitated the mentioned glass to Harry and he took it gladly, lifting his glass to Kreacher.
“Ah!” Potter immediately squeaked, clapping once his hands. “I knew it! I told you it was her sight and—”
"We've been together for twenty years and you want to go change in the bathroom?" Harry's tone was angry, regretful. Draco was doing the right thing, staying together right now would mean fighting and they'd both had enough of it.
Draco raised an inquiring eyebrow, smirking when Potter’s cheeks tinged a light red.
’, and sighed.
Harry laughed at that— a deep hearty laugh, with his head thrown back and watery eyes. “You’re such a git. Honestly, I’m surprised it took you that long to figure it out.”
Draco snorted, a light puff of air which dragged Potter’s attention. Potter snapped his head to him and Draco smiled. “I know you like it, Harry Potter.”
Draco shakes his head because he can’t. Besides, he doesn’t know what’s happening, he’s so confused. But his friends are staring insistently at him. Draco sighs—there’s no point trying to hide it now.
“No, I… wait.” Potter gestured to move from the dessert tables, and they made their way to the end of the room, near the big cherry wood doors.
“Yeah, you’ve said it, multiple times,” Ron replied as he got out of the bathroom, clean and suited up. “And I’m here to celebrate it with you.”
is terribly calling to you.
Draco had spent the last year dreaming of their first kiss. He'd usually imagined it as rushed, rough, all teeth and tongue, desperate and greedy, as their sexual encounters mostly were. Nothing prepared him for what kissing Harry Potter was actually like.
Malfoy only shrugged.
Naked, drunk, in a room he didn’t recognise. Oh, and tied up. Very much tied up, wrists and ankles locked to an unfamiliar bed.
“Fuck,” he whispers into the pillow, arse canted to Harry’s groin. “More,
Malfoy frowned, but complied, lowering his voice to a whisper. “Harry…”
“Draco… what’s happening?” Harry’s voice was only a whisper and Draco mentally cursed himself. It was time to react.
In a quick move, Potter’s chocolate-covered fingers were on Draco’s cheeks, tracing chocolate lines on his cheekbones, jaw, nose, and lips. Draco held his breath. His mind screaming
But that wasn’t completely true, Harry knew it.
“Okay!” Seamus bellowed after a few seconds. “First question: do we know the fella?”
Harry reaches them, a weird feeling twisting his guts. “Err, I can come back if you’re—”
He stopped his already slow pace, looking around while Pansy descended the last step and ran toward a marching group of catering people.
When Teddy was fast asleep, they moved to the living room, waiting for Andromeda to come back. They sat on the couch before the hearth, a hot chocolate in their hands and a companionable silence between them.
Shit.
“You aren’t making sense.”
“Why the hell did you tell everybody, you tosser!” Harry yells. He can feel his magic prickling under his skin. It’s been so long since the last time he lost his temper like this and Harry almost feels more alive, almost gives in to the urge to unleash his magic.
You lift your head, your sight swims. “Are you following me?” Why is Harry fucking Potter at a stripper club, on Christmas Eve, when he surely has a lovely red-haired family waiting for him at home?
This time, silent tears rolled down Harry’s cheeks and anger coiled in the pit of his stomach. Taken by a wave of nausea, he pushed Malfoy’s chest away, opening his eyes, looking around himself.
Shamelessly, in front of everyone, until Ron had spluttered an embarrassed, “Get a room! We want to play too!” And they’d parted.
Oh please, Tori, don’t hate me. I can’t live knowing you hate me. I felt something and it scared me to death. Because he’s a man, because he’s Harry Potter, because we were both married, both with children… it wasn’t. It just… couldn’t.”
Amongst the people who saved his sorry, pert, round, kissable, arse.
Something veiled Potter’s eyes and his smirk dissipated, leaving space to a blank mask. “Right, well… I found this little champ at the beach and some locals told me… Wait, you’re a magi-zoologist?!”
Malfoy’s smile didn’t falter at all. He just shrugged and said, “Maybe? Or maybe we found ourselves stuck in time. Which reminds me! You said something once about fixing the Time Machine! And I really didn’t like Geremia—”
use your brain. Amazing!” Malfoy brought the plates to the table, sitting next to Harry. He went on. “Do you think people would want to be busted using it and on muggles at that? But, yes, as you so eloquently said: it sucks.”
Draco caught up, stopping a few feet from him, with a smirk on his face. “You forgot to thank my bathroom. It had been so kind to you and you just left.”
“What do you mean, ‘so’? I don’t want this to end, obviously!”
The sun was covered by clouds, but he could see it high in the sky, and judging by the yellowish light it emitted, he guessed it was somewhere around noon. They should already be back by now, right?
With a snap of Harry’s fingers, a stasis was put over the food in the kitchen as a couple of bowls levitated from the kitchen to the bedroom. He clucked his tongue, staring into Draco’s eyes.
“Malfoy, be reasonable. We had nothing to help Harry! This could be it. If we manage to go back in time to the night of the party—"
, and Harry dropped his head between his arms on the table and forgot about everything else.
Draco felt his lips stretching into a smile against his will. He hesitantly laid his hand in the crook of Potter’s elbow, finding it warm and just perfect, as much as elbows could be perfect. He was still staring at their joined arms when Potter tugged and lead the way towards the ballroom again.
doomed.
On Thursday, he showed up in hideous flip flops and a white — white! — swimsuit, batting his eyelashes, claiming he heard Lady Luck
“Yes, yes, sorry. I just guess… I find you attractive. Very attractive. And, it’s scary because… you’re Potter, I mean, you’re
, as he clamped tight fingers on Draco's hips.
Geremia waved a hand in front of them, smiling slyly.
Harry clasped his feet on Draco's back and pulled him towards his chest, pupils blown wide. "What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation?!" He thrust toward Draco's cock, his hole fluttering around it, and Draco closed his eyes, almost succumbing to the need to thrust in once and for all.
“Pansy, please. You’re here, encouraging me to go and talk with a person I had a terrible relationship with during school, someone I sided against during the War, someone I haven’t seen in five years… and you can’t even sort your things out with Blaise.”
“I’m in love with you too,” he whispered against Draco’s lips. His hands dragged up, caressing Draco’s spine to reach his face and cup his cheeks. “Have been for a long time, now.”
Being able to see Potter again, smell his new ocean skin, see the new grey strands of hair on his old familiar messy head, his everlasting emerald eyes with a few wrinkles at the sides.
Harry panted desperately, wanting
He could do it, had dreamt about it for so long. With shaking hands, Harry reached for Draco’s trousers and slid them off him, taking down his pants too, slowly. He knew Draco wouldn’t wake up for another hour, but Harry still liked to pretend, to think he had to be careful not to wake him up. It was part of the game.
“Yes.” The word was out of Harry’s mouth before he could even process it. Parkinson stopped her empty protest, turning her head to Malfoy so fast that her neck cracked audibly in the stunned silence of the room.
“Shush! Maybe you want to say it louder for everyone in this house to hear?!”
“What do you want from me?”
That was a pattern that seemed to be going on since London. Draco knew he was gay well before Astoria — but he was a former Death Eater, Lucius was still breathing down his neck to produce an heir, he still felt like he owed the world proof of his goodwill, like he owed his family the last attempt to reform the Malfoy's glory.
“You could say that, Harry.” Ginny was tapping her fingers on the table, quickly, mechanically, as if trying to dig a hole in it.
“Mrs Darsley.” Draco reached her portrait, amused to see three cats in ballet skirts playing on the background of it. “Don’t call me Mr Malfoy, please. Just Draco.”
“What’s the problem?” she said as soon as he sat down at the table.
"Weird thing destiny, huh."
“And again.”
Malfoy’s cheeks went a delicious pink again and his eyes widened minutely, darting for one second to Harry and then returning to Pansy. He spluttered, “I-I don’t care about Potter’s
in Harry’s mind too. It was probably because they spent all the time they had together, Harry thought. It had nothing to do with
“It had been, um, interesting,” a rosy-cheeked Hermione confessed to Harry. “And now Ron acts like a jealous git.”
With trembling hands — equally because of the wine
Releasing his breath, Draco shook his head and whispered, "I thought it was Lady Luck that—"
As if he’d read his mind, Harry sucked in a breath, brushing delicate fingertips on Draco’s chest. “You said you know why I want to kiss you.”
Astoria laughed uncontrollably at that, keeping her hands on her belly. “Please! It’s in the freezer.”
Potter cleared his throat, shifting his feet. “Er, it’s just. I mean, I forgot my jumper here last time and…”
It was poor timing.
Harry admired the waitress’ patience. She stood awkwardly, waiting for Hermione to compose herself. “Oh, darling. I’ll have a vinegar salad with quinoa and a glass of Pinot Noir.”
“Fuck,
You’re both panting now, Potter’s cock hard and leaking against his stomach, bobbing with every thrust, untouched. Someone outside laughs, shouts, “That’s it, darlings!”
" Draco said, looking at the turtles. "Another thrilling day is ahead of us. What do you have to tell me today?"
. I can’t… you can’t just… fuck!” Harry’s breathing was already quickening and his cock was now fully, achingly hard, and probably even leaking judging by the stickiness he felt as he shifted on the couch.
With a pang in his chest, Harry remembered the last time they’d spoken.
The morning after, Harry was getting ready for work slower than usual. His Veela senses were sharper, making everything harder. He hadn’t felt that flustered since the first time he’d discovered he had Veela blood.
“I—” Harry paused. This wasn’t how he had wanted to bring the topic up, but the Veritaserum ran hot under his skin and it was urging him to finally tell Malfoy. “I still have your wand. Still use it, sometimes.”
Harry mounted also and as they flew into the sky looked to see Boo-boo happily floating behind them, with a gleeful smile.
All Harry could do was stand there and smile, while Teddy’s hair slowly changed to his brand black. When standing there simply staring at Malfoy became too awkward, Harry approached them and gently kissed Teddy’s cheek.
Right. It was in their rules. Never spend the night together.
fucking
“Damn, just kiss m—” Harry didn’t even let him finish. Their lips finally collided, and Draco was thoroughly fucked because he was already addicted to his scent and now, he was addicted to Harry’s taste too, of sweet cherries again, and he asked himself how someone could be so sweet in every cell of his body.
“I’m having spaghetti bolognese and a glass of what she’s having.”
“Just do it, Harry.” Draco's voice went smaller when Harry thrust the tip inside, slowly, looking intently at Draco’s hole.
“If what you’re saying is true, I doubt this cellone will work here since this is a
I need
He grinned, took Draco’s hand. “We may not know when and if we’ll be able to break
Draco shifted his head, curling it even more into the crook of Harry’s neck, shutting his eyes closed so much Harry felt his eyelashes brushing his skin. His lips were dangerously close to Harry’s neck and his voice came out muffled. “I thought you didn’t want people to see you are friendly with me.”
Draco jumped from the couch, muttering frantically, “Maybe I can still do it in time! Oh Merlin, yes, the ring is—”
"Yes, Harry, that's why it's illegal and no one uses it anymore." Hermione exhaled, fidgeting with her hands.
“That was brilliant,” Potter said, voice husky. He opened his eyes, fixing Draco with a smile Draco had no idea how to deal with. Trying desperately to find something to distract himself with, Draco readjusted his trousers, fastening them again before sitting upright on the sofa, and rested his head against the back.
"Mind your business, Malfoy. Let's just be done with this."
— just like a personal confession from the fucking Saviour.
“I showed you,” Malfoy said. His voice was rough, it sounded as desperate as Harry felt. “But that’s not how I’d want it to happen.”
As soon as Malfoy was close enough, Harry put his hands on him, grasping his hips and nuzzling his groin, inhaling deeply. “Christ, you smell good,” he gasped, running his tongue on the outline of Malfoy’s cock.
. They had both burst out laughing when they settled on this rule, knowing it wasn’t a risk.
interesting.” Pansy winked at Ginny and turned to Malfoy, lightly shoving his shoulder. “You’re too silent, darling. Have a bit of fun with me, here.”
Since they started fucking, they established some rules, safe words, what games and toys could be used. Harry loved to sub, he especially loved it with Malfoy, but there were some things he wasn’t comfortable with. Surely Malfoy had respected that, right?
“Draco? Do you want me to take care of you? I am in the mood for — ”
Just as Hermione opened her mouth to reply, the waitress approached. She was lovely, really. All smiles and plump lips, fluffy hair around her head. “What can I bring you love birds?”
Potter chuckled and re-emerged from the bedroom. He reached the fireplace, stopping at the door of the kitchen to quickly blow a kiss to Draco. “I need to go now, really. Tonight, then?”
With a few steps, Malfoy reached Alicia, nudging her with his elbow.
“Um, Draco, love? This isn’t mine.” But before Harry’s words could reach his ears, Draco saw stars in front of his eyes and passed out, vaguely aware of Harry hurrying towards him and catching him in his arms.
They stayed through the afternoon and into the night, the others filling him in on what happened at the New Year’s Eve party. Harry was happy to know that he hadn't been the only one completely pissed. Apparently, Seamus and Dean had made an exhibition of themselves climbing onto the roof of the farmhouse and declaring they'd fuck there until dawn.
Draco finally gave in, abandoning himself in the heat of Harry’s mouth, so familiar but at the same time so different, new. He dipped his hands in his messy hair, tilting his head back to lick and graze his teeth on Harry’s neck.
They stayed like that for a while, Malfoy’s forehead heavy on Harry’s shoulder, until he raised his head, peering heavy-lidded into Harry’s eyes.
And Harry saw the exact moment Malfoy, his Sir, let a layer of his hard mask fall down and gave Harry one of his favourite orders.
Pansy looked expectantly at him, but when he didn’t go on, she asked, “So?”
Fuck, Harry really did cross the line this time. Still, the details about the previous night are fuzzy and unclear and maybe he should go talk to Zabini, after all.
A snort escaped Harry. “You’re telling me we’re under Veritaserum right now?”
They were openly laughing now, Draco’s cheeks already wet with tears. “Who said that we had to share a room, then, it’s a mystery. We could have simply had a room each. But no, we did a room for both of us and a guest room. What the fuck.”
This time was no less.
They hardly talked about that anymore. Harry knew Draco and Boo-boo had talked about it, Draco had tried to explain to Boo-boo about Voldemort and to calm him down after witnessing Harry’s parents’ death, but he couldn’t bring himself to think more about it.
Draco found himself nodding, his heart racing madly in his chest.
The room erupted into a heated chattering, all the guests’ faces glued to the Golden Trio. Potter and his friends started advancing into the room and Draco’s glance slipped to them again. Not realising it, his eyes started roaming quickly over Potter’s body — Draco could see that his suit was tailor-made, but,
Still, you blink and you wonder if you’re maybe dreaming. He does look like one of your dreams.
"I guess it worked, but I don't like you with blue hair, Draco."
"Don't lie to me, I remember your headaches. Still having them?" Potter's hand was now cupping Draco's cheek as his thumb slowly rubbed circles on it.
“He’s ashamed of me,” Draco stutters out, understanding now his friends’ pity. The realisation hurts more than when that hideous hippogriff almost ripped his arm away.
Harry had cocked his head, giving it a thought. “Okay,” he had said as Draco’s head snapped up to him. “I trust you. I surely trust you more than anything out of Knocturn, damn, Draco.”
Draco sighed loudly, cursing under his breath. How was it even possible that the more he looked at him, the more Potter’s skin seemed to glow, fucking
With a deep sigh, Harry sat on the bed. A voice inside his head was screaming that this was wrong, all damn
Harry looked around to see festoons draped everywhere, with a banner that read,
Draco had opened his eyes, lifting a questioning brow.
"Um, Boo-boo, how do you keep track of time? I think I'm a bit lost… how long has it been since we arrived back here? Mobiles and clocks don't work when you travel through time…"
?" Malfoy smirked, a knowing look in his eyes. "Kidding."
She interrupted him, her voice a bit firmer now. “You loved me! Then what happened! When did you discover… you’re… gay?!”
Harry wanked to the thought repeatedly, feeling dirty and ashamed of it, but unable to stop. The thought that Draco could let him have full control, not only when awake, got to his head.
“Yes! Yes! I’ll go out!” Draco turned and started making his way through the crowd with hurried steps, trying to regain control of himself. He took several deep breaths, avoiding the surprised gazes of the guests; until meeting Pansy and Blaise, who regarded him with perplexed faces, but he shook them off with a quiet ‘I just need a breath of fresh air’ and resumed his walk buried in his thoughts.
“Like what? Tell me and I’ll do them,” Harry blurted out. His hands reached out to grab Malfoy’s waist— it was almost as if he wasn’t the one in control of his own body. The more Malfoy talked, the more Harry needed him, needed him to tell Harry exactly what to do, what to say, what to think.
Oh. Harry’s stomach fluttered and he felt his face growing hot. Had he thought Malfoy looked sinly hot wearing auror robes? Yes. And had he thought he’d liked to eat dinner out of Malfoy’s arse? Unfortunately, also yes. But Harry had never thought it was reciprocal. At work they’d always kept bickering, fighting, arguing.
Draco curled his hands on his thighs, trying to resist the sudden urge to grasp his cock and wank furiously. It made no sense; it was just food, right? Moaning, Draco took another bite, letting the perfect flavours of melted sugar and apple mix in his mouth.
Trying to distract himself, Harry took a sip of his wine too and shoved another raspberry muffin in his mouth, talking around it.
Malfoy turned his head to him abruptly. "Fixed
He opened the box, kneeled before Harry, gently disentangling from his embrace. “Harry…”
impression of Samuel L. Jackson, much to Boo-boo’s amusement, but in the end he was happy finally getting to try it.
"Hullo!" An echoing voice startled them and they stopped short mere inches from the door of an old Muggle coffee shop where no one they knew used to go.
“But!” She said, a funny look on her face. “He did try to resist the Veritaserum.”
Together with a touch of anxiety, lust sparked again in Harry at the thought of letting himself go to something new once again, with Malfoy. Curiosity took over and he nodded, trustful, contented.
“Perfect as always.”
“We are already on the front page, Harry, dancing together. And besides, since when do you care?”
Draco gaped at her. This wasn’t going
Wait. What?
“Someone’s eager,” he declared, slumping down against the sofa. “Although I’m afraid I’m too sore to go at it again.”
conversation. Ron’s eyes bulged so much Draco was ready to scoop them up with a spoon.
“Ron, what—”
"Draco, c'mon! He's a ghost, he doesn't need a bed or a bathroo— listen, this isn't the point, you know you love him. Just open the gift!"
After drinking his chamomile, Draco went to the living room and startled when he saw Astoria was lying on the couch, her eyes half-closed. Draco looked at her, at her grown body, that body he knew by heart. A body that probably should have deserved more attention.
Tickets in hand, heart furiously beating in his chest, Draco looked as Harry entered their living room. And all of Draco’s blood drained from his face in sheer horror.
They laughed in their kiss, and kissed again, and again, and—
“A-and… they… fell in love. I… think.”
Damn, but now the word
“How is it that you can cook like muggles?”
“I swear that’s not…” Draco trailed off, Potter’s eyes were wide as saucers, his mouth open, his lips — still red from the cherry sauce — forming a perfect ‘O’… They stared at each other in silence, when the portrait started again.
“How’s that even possible?”
Potter turned, a dish with two slices of cake and a tremendous amount of cherries in his hand. His eyebrows were wrinkled in amusement, his eyes glittered in the hazy light of the sunset and whatever Draco was thinking, just abandoned him, replaced by images of green eyes and happiness and kisses.
"Who are you and what are you doing here?! You could be seen, are you crazy?"
This time Harry tried to break the kiss and Draco wasn’t able to resist leaning in to prolong the contact. Harry smiled into their kiss and tried to ask, “Am I the only one, mmmh, who’s hearing, nggh…” He finally came away from Draco’s lips, glancing up to the sky and Draco followed his gaze. Sure enough, a huge spectacle of fireworks of every colour was soaring over the Manor — the guests who remained were already gathering out in the gardens to enjoy it.
Five years. Five years terrified of having contact with other people, spent imagining all the worst scenarios in case his old classmates discovered he didn’t have his magic anymore, spent fearing confrontation with the great Harry Potter, and now this. Maybe it was the adrenaline of the events of the night, of how differently he felt telling his ‘big secret’ to someone, to Harry, but now he couldn’t restrain himself anymore.
And now that everything is coming back to Harry, a sick feeling plummets to his stomach. Draco’s tears earlier, his anger…
“Yes, master,” Malfoy smirked, handing Harry one glass.
“You’re begging. You’re actually begging. That’s hot,” Malfoy breathed. A second later, as fast as they’d come, all the thoughts about pleasing Malfoy and urging Harry to do anything he could to have him, disappeared.
“Thank you,” he said as he sniffed the liquid swirling in his glass. White wine was Harry’s weakness. He took a swig, hummed appreciatively and cast a quick tempus: in about half an hour his friends, family, colleagues from work, literally anyone who meant anything to Harry would arrive and he couldn’t be more excited.
“Potter,” Malfoy had said the first time they’d met again at one of the thousands of ministry galas, in his impeccably refined tone. “Nice to see you here.”
“Actually you, Harry, something like
There was no way Potter took Draco in his arms, brought him to his bedroom, stayed the night without having sex, and cooked breakfast the morning after. It broke at least
. You’re a Rookie, Potter. Rookies don’t know shit.”
Harry looked in his eyes, finding a warmth there he never imagined Malfoy could ever hold for him.
Draco started to hum close to Harry’s ear…
Harry shook his head — right, the t-shirt. He threw it off somewhere by his side, and didn't take off his pants, knowing it was one of Malfoy’s favourite parts.
“And second,” she went on, “I think it’s a brilliant idea. It’s been five years since you last exited these walls, Draco. And you never... you know. Took care of the house, took care of yourself. Everything was collapsing. But I do think this is the right occasion to start living again, honey.”
Malfoy's eyelids suddenly opened, the pale grey eyes just starting to show up under the dark brown of the glamour, slowly melting away.
One heated gaze later, Draco walked towards the bed, caressing the petals, smelling the air.
talking to me???”
Harry grabbed the handle of the door, praying he’d be able to refrain from blushing at the sight of Malfoy wrapped in his Potioneer scrubs and goggles. He didn’t have the time to think anything, though— as soon as Harry opened the door, Malfoy flicked his eyes up and cried, “Fuck!” before a loud bang echoed in the room.
“Nah, don’t worry, it’s good to see you! I’m feeling better, thank you! As for Rolf, it’s not his fault, he couldn’t have known. Can you help me gather my things while I get ready in the bathroom, please?”
“No time, come here,” he urged, grabbing Harry’s hand as soon as he was close enough. “Take Malfoy’s hand, there,” he went on, guiding Harry’s right hand to Malfoy’s left one. “Cross your pinky with Malfoy’s.”
“Yes, well. It’s not that difficult,” he said, flashing Harry the fakest grin he’d ever seen.
From Harry’s
With what seemed to be a great effort, Jacob walked towards the lift, taking out a mobile. Boo-boo told Harry and Malfoy that all he did was text someone:
The implications of seeing each other again, of dating. Other kisses like these, and then more and more again, working together to make the school a success. A house together, with a cuckoo clock; they could ask Florence if she’d like to move in with them. Harry finally making a new wand for Draco, breakfasts together in bed, a life without the need of the pendant.
Pansy stopped beside him, a hand loosely on his shoulder. Squeezed once. “It’s beautiful, Draco.”
A sudden noise of explosion startled Harry, who tore his eyes off Malfoy’s to look at thousands of little shards dispersing at his feet, around the floor of the room.
“Malfoy said it’s my fault, but really…”
Just as he said the words, the sigh that was going to haunt Harry’s nights — he knew it— left Malfoy’s lips again and he bowed his head.
Draco clears his throat, effectively wrenching Harry away from his thoughts. Harry switches his attention to Draco, who looks uncharacteristically nervous. He’s munching on his cheeks, fidgeting with his hands and when he swallows, it’s loud and laboured, Adam’s apple bobbing.
And with Malfoy came all the others: Nott (who was apparently shagging Neville); Blaise and Parkinson (who were engaged and had been in love since they were six, wasn’t that cute?); Goyle (who made Harry’s insides churn with pity); two girls who were sisters (and seriously, Harry, did you even pay attention to your classmates during those six years together)?
“Pfft. When have I
Harry rolled his eyes and sighed loudly. He put both his hands on the table and blurted out, “We are in love. We want to marry and live together until the last breath of our lives.”
it happens after I’ve had sex with Draco. I mean Malfoy.”
"So, let me see if I understood it right this time. Jacob casts the bond, something goes off, the bond should link our minds, skin, feelings, but the only one completed is the skin one. Jacob is missing, and I'm fucked."
But Harry smirked and his voice came out husky when he said, "I want this, Draco. I've dreamt of you for years, I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you again."
“For the thousandth time, I didn’t sleep with your precious Potter, Draco.”
"Wait! Where's Boo-boo?"
Confused.
“I’m sorry, G.” Harry sighed and let go of the broken pieces of the mug in his hand. “I guess I’m out of sorts today.”
The crowd fell silent as Draco entered, anticipation in their eyes. He smiled, looking around while he made his way toward the podium at the end of the room and people started to take their seats in front of it. Draco recognised some familiar faces: Longbottom, Lovegood, the Patils, Nott, the Greengrass sisters, even some professors, Trelawney, Sprout, McGonagall… really, why the fuck wasn’t Potter here?
Now, when Malfoy broke the kiss, Harry’s mind blurred — for a confused moment, he thought he’d heard Malfoy confessing his love for Harry again, but then his mind cleared and Malfoy’s whispers against his lips made more sense. “I missed you, I missed you so much, I missed you.”
Harry clicked his tongue, feeling heat warming his cheeks.
He had thought, maybe, that this was just what sex felt like.
“What are you doing here, exactly?” Harry tried to convey as much spite as he could, but Malfoy simply raised his head and grinned.
"My point is, Harry, that I'm wonderful. Also, I have the
People seemed to seriously not be affected by it, but Harry knew better— Malfoy had Veela blood, he was sure of it. There was no other reason for which he could find him attractive.
“I’d like to see that.”
"I'll see what I can do, but I make no promises."
The breeze was warm and wrapped around Draco, bringing the persistent perfume of lilies and jasmines with it. He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes, skimming a hand through his hair, worried the breeze would dishevel it. Blaise was right — it was a mildly warm day, one of those days you’d want to spend on the veranda of your house, with a glass of wine in one hand and the peace of a good book in the other.
They did this every time: dance around each other, exchange tooth-rotting compliments, hug, blush and exaggeratedly laugh at each others’ jokes. Draco had tried millions of times to make them see there was something between them, but they had always brushed him off, because “Draco, she’s just a friend!” and “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
, coveted tipsiness, come to rescue him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco managed to say, looking anywhere but into Pansy’s eyes.
All in all, it could be worse, Harry guessed. Malfoy had told him the potion would keep his aches at bay — aches due to the need for constant touch with the other person.
I can’t believe this
Their eyes met, Draco’s mind going blank as he registered Potter’s blissful expression. Sometimes, Draco wondered if he really ejaculated cream.
Malfoy looked up at him then, and it looked so endearing, his long blond lashes glinting with the sunlight coming in, that Harry felt his chest tighten. “I need more,” he whispered, cheeks quickly tinging red.
“Ginny, why don’t you come lay down on one of the hammocks with me? They are so comfortable…” Astoria patted the hammock next to her, a reassuring smile pulling at her lips.
"We could track Jacob down and strangle him before he as much as lifts a finger at me!"
When he was fully seated, Harry groaned again, taking a deep breath of Draco’s scent. He had always found it stronger, muskier when Draco was asleep, and it turned him on even more. “So bloody warm…”
Before leaving, Hermione wrote Malfoy's office address on the blackboard on Harry's fridge. She and Ron were the last to go home, standing in front of the fireplace, Floo powder in hands.
“You’ll have to resist just some more,” he continued, cocking his head. “I’m giving you a choice: you either move or speak.”
His hand leaves your hair, and you let go of his cock, push your fingers out. “Commanding a bit too much for a whore,” you say, coughing a little, your throat sore.
was what being happy felt like. Yes, he missed working and doing something outside the house, but…
You feel like this shouldn’t be happening at all, but fuck, you’re not a good man: your attraction to Potter has been going on for as long as you can remember, and his lips, his eyes, his
Draco pursed his lips, feigning indifference. “Well, don’t do this again. I have to keep my body healthy, you know, and all I want to do now is eat everything on the table. This isn’t fair.”
Harry turned to see Boo-boo floating right behind him, lips pouting and arms crossed in front of his chest.
Harry would love to answer as everyone expected him to, and say that, “No, of course, don’t be ridiculous Seamus!”, but unfortunately the Veritaserum in his veins was hot as fire and his poor attempt at Occlude faded away as ash in the wind.
He cast a wordless glamouring spell, first on Malfoy, and then on himself.
.” Malfoy took a deep breath and went on as Harry’s world started to crumble around him.
“No! What? No! I told you… erm, it was just an alignment of conditions!”
Draco’s mouth hung open as Harry laid on the blanket, eyes locked with Draco’s, spreading his legs apart for him to see. Harry murmured a lube spell and his fingers were coated with a shiny liquid. Without any further ado, he raised a finger to circle his rim, his breathing loud even in the stormy rain around them.
. I’m sorry, have you already read it?” he asked, voice dripping with sarcasm.
"What!?" Malfoy's voice came out high-pitched and only slightly amused. And Harry could understand him, really. What the fuck was happening?
Harry looked bewildered at him and then lowered his gaze to the vial. “What if this isn’t the Veritaserum at all? And, and… even if it actually
Harry narrowed his eyes at him, bracing himself for yet another one of Malfoy’s jokes. “Enemies?”
“Err, I—” Harry starts when a red-haired head pops in through the door.
“Your magic? But hadn’t it vanished?” Mrs Darsley’s eyebrows shot up her forehead while looking bewildered at Draco.
He looked back at Harry with his eyebrows drawn. “What?”
, to—
, right. Yes. Of course. Friends, we’re like best friends now. Haha.”
, for the thousandth time. Even Potter knew it by now and used to tease Draco about his silly passion for Muggle romances.
Draco nodded against her neck, breathing —in and out, in and out— reminding himself it was only one day. He just had to give a speech for his Charity Auction, and then it’d be over. Three hours. Four at the longest.
Your eyes roam to his white shirt, so transparent you can see his tight, dark nipples, to his leather trousers: they look painted on him, there’s no room for the imagination.
It was the morning after, and still, Draco couldn’t believe they had done this. Last night, he and Astoria had slept together hugging on the couch in the living room. Neither of them had really closed their eyes and slept more than ten minutes in a row, but they hadn’t spoken at all.
He stopped at the entrance to the room. It was enormous, exactly how he remembered from his youth years, but it held something new, or probably it was only Draco’s gaze that was new. He sighed loudly, taking in the red festoons, draped around the ivory curtains, pulled apart to let the light in, finally.
Harry motioned towards the box, unsure if he could touch it. When he saw Hermione and Geremia nodding, he picked it up, examining it, turning it in his hands, trying to open it and failing.
“Am I hurting you?” His voice is a growl, animalistic, possessive.
Someone in the background exulted, someone else whistled, others faked gagging, but all Harry could hear were Malfoy’s soft moans, his scent lingering in the air all around them, his hands madly roaming on his chest, up and down, his fingers tripping on the buttons.
Harry watched as Ron reached Hermione by the fireplace and they Floo’d back home. A headache started blooming, clouding Harry’s thoughts.
Harry sucked harder, his tongue darting around Draco’s shaft to lick away the cream. He licked the tip, eventually letting go to murmur, “This is good, but I have to say, I rather prefer your taste.”
“A hot-air
They set up a frantic rhythm. Malfoy started snapping his hips faster as he fastened his mouth over every centimetre of Harry’s skin that was reachable.
Draco returned, waving at Pansy. “Hey. What’s up?”
Malfoy was completely crazy and exhausting, but he always knew how to please him. Again, all the memories of the care Malfoy had used to clean and make Harry comfortable after giving him his ‘gift’, invaded his mind, leaving back a warm feeling.
The sky darkened from rose to a deep orange with glints of blue. Draco sighed one last time, not knowing why he had hoped so much to see Potter. He should be relieved at not seeing him, and honestly, he should have foreseen this. Why would Potter want to step foot inside the Manor again?
“I need to go now,” he said.
Harry felt his fingers itching to reach out and stroke his hair, his cheeks, brushing them on his skin, discovering if it felt as silky as it looked.
, Potter loves you too.”
he thinks to himself.
Malfoy’s hand slid from Harry’s back to his waist and Harry couldn’t find in himself the strength to dodge away from his touch.
“Out! All of you!” Draco croaked, exasperated. “I need to get ready and you’re all distracting me. Harry’s almost home. Shoo!”
Harry batted his hand away, drawing a scandalised cry from Draco.
“Err, yey? So, um, did you see Harry around? I thought he was with you.” He tried to ignore the way his voice cracked on the word ‘Harry’ and how his three interlocutors didn’t miss it, all turning a smug face to him.
Draco sighed slowly. “Well, yes. Not tomorrow, but we would like to.”
“Do you like it? A
"Ahem, well. If the next trip will be the one to the night of the party, we need to be prepared. What about my potion? We'll be there twelve hours, I’ll need at least two flasks, right? And what about our appearances? We'll need to disguise or we will be too recognisable and it would be risky. Also, I was thinking that it would be wise to bring along my Invisibility Cloak."
“What are you trying to do?” Malfoy cocked his head at him, his face genuinely confused.
Harry cocked his head. This time he felt his own face heating up. “Dignity,” he scoffed. “Damn it. That would mean that I’m attracted to
“Draco, are you sure Harry will like this?”
Harry sat on the couch, blaming Malfoy only for the lack of things to do during the wait. Didn't he have any newspapers? Photos to sneak at? And where was Hermione?
He knew he hit the right spot when Harry’s eyes lit up and his face split into a huge grin. “You’re right. Lead the way, then, Draco.”
Harry sighed, brushing Draco’s hand that was now painfully clutching at his elbow. “It is, you’re right, but it will only get worse if we keep on like this. It will be hard, I won’t deny that, but we are together. We can do this. Trust me?”
With his head spinning, Harry reached Malfoy’s neck, leaving wet kisses, sucking his skin into his mouth, breathing lightly on the marked skin, making Malfoy whimper against the wall. “Draco, we have so much to talk about, but… but I…”
But after a couple of stunned blinks, Potter’s mouth widened into a crooked grin.
happened...
They looked at each other, at the stars and the moon. Malfoy pressed his lips against Harry’s. “Yes,” he breathed. “I’ll let you if you’ll let me.”
“Let’s start again, shall we? It’s a delightful night. I love, err, how you adorned the Manor, it’s very… Gryffindor.”
He laid his hand on the banister, feeling the soft silk under his palm. Red. Draco hated the colour red, but the catering man insisted it conveyed strength, passion, and positivity. All things Draco wasn’t feeling in the slightest.
Harry stared at him. “Malfoy, don’t… don’t apologise or say things like please. You’re creeping me out!”
“Thanks, Sarah. You know me.” Draco smiled as Sarah rolled her eyes and cast a quick drying charm on his coat. She hung it on the hangers in the hall and he moved to follow her. The multitude of food aromas he had come to know so well wafted into his nostrils, making his mouth water.
Harry's eyes were focussed on Malfoy's Adam's apple, so tantalisingly jutted out, when Boo-boo looked from Harry to Malfoy and then asked, "Why are you staring at him?"
Again, his annoying face did that stupid thing: it lit up with a shy smile. Was there some sort of light that hit Potter every time he smiled? Draco could swear there was. He looked back at him, an involuntary smile crossing his face too, and something winced in his stomach — it almost felt like butterflies apparated into it from nowhere and started to flap their wings all together.
“You counted them, Potter? Doing the countdown for when you’d finally see me again?”
, it sounds.
Between what they heard of Jacob's words and Boo-boo descriptions, they narrowed down what happened. Jacob pronounced the last part of the ritual, the one that would have sealed the bond, the wrong way and crashed to the floor.
From the audience, someone started clapping and in a jiffy, everyone joined in. The air felt hot all of a sudden, perspiration gathered at the small of Draco’s back.
Geremia was still smiling devilishly, his eyes glinting maliciously. “You fools! This is the best invention I’ve ever made in my entire life, I couldn’t let my son ruin that! The fact he never came back… it meant nothing! I knew it could work and it did with you two. I’ll bring Rose back, and everything will be fine, Theodore will be back too and—”
That’s how you find yourself wandering outside The Lewd Legs— a Muggle stripper club, open on Christmas Eve. How shabby. But you don’t have any more dignity. You don’t care. You go back there, even if you haven’t fucked anyone else but Potter in the last five months.
He took another sip of his Metropolitan and sighed. That’s exactly how it happened the first time with Potter. It was nearly a year ago; they were at this very pub with their friends, Potter had ordered a Margarita, and he and Draco were the only ones left at the booth.
“Right. What you must know is that I love you, Gin. You are my family, but… at some point, something clicked with Draco. We just, I don’t know. The time we spent together felt perfect, the feelings I had for him started growing with the years passing, and I knew… I thought… it wasn’t right to be that happy with him when I had all of you at home — you… Molly, Arthur… our kids… I tried to bury everything deep down, I convinced myself it was only a stupid childish infatuation...” Harry was chewing on his bottom lip — he wasn’t good with words.
Hot lips finally collided with Draco's, a tongue slowly dragging on his bottom lip. Draco felt already intoxicated by the man holding him; he opened his mouth and his heart to Harry without any other doubt.
Harry’s smile widened and he took Malfoy’s face in both his hands, landing a soft dry kiss on his lips. “I told you I love you. It was the first time for that, too.”
“Look who’s here,” a familiar voice drawls. It’s Potter, of course it is.
He hadn’t missed this. He just…
“Go to the bedroom,” Malfoy ordered. “
When he opened his eyes, Potter was smiling and both his hands were now cupping Draco’s face, his fingers delicately massaging his temples.
^^^^^
Ron raised his eyebrows. “When you get angry or too moody, it… Fuck, Harry this is not okay on the field! And this case was risky, we couldn’t—“
No one called him Malfoy anymore, except—
Draco took a deep breath and briefly closed his eyes. His heart was hammering, echoing in his head. The last five years had been the most difficult for him, living in the Manor had been a nightmare, but without the ability of waking up.
Their friends looked like frozen statues, their lips open in astonishment or covered by their hands, their eyes wide, trained on them or looking away in embarrassment.
And Harry sees stars. He bites down Malfoy’s jaw and feels the salt from his tears, licks them away.
“Oh, believe me, you do!” Lily finally took out the dildo and for a second, there was a stunned silence in the room. Then everyone lost it and started to laugh; even Ron seemed amused.
him on a completely different level without even realising it.
many levels. Absolutely not. If you want my help, he's Potter."
for Salazar's sake. And his workplace was no less. It used to drive him crazy how messy it all looked.
“Not yours!”
Potter laid his head against Draco’s cheek, and with his mouth close to his ear, he murmured, “Could we go back to Harry and Draco? I liked first names better.”
“Shoes?”
Harry blinked up at him, the peacock finally scampering away. “So… the portrait falling off the wall, my chair vanishing… that old guy in the portrait singing love songs, the flowers... the bathroom, the peacock… for Merlin’s balls, was this you flirting with me?”
’s there, sitting rigidly on an armchair, legs bouncing nervously. He sees you and his mouth curls into a grimace, full of hatred.
Harry blinked. For a moment he looked lost for words. “No, I… I didn’t buy them at Sweet Prophecies, I made them.”
Malfoy looked at him with a single eyebrow raised but nodded, adjusting his coat and draping the hood over his head.
