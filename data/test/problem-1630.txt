He was just about to say something to that effect when a paper airplane memo crash-landed on the desk in front of him, sending his other papers and files flying.
“No, sir, thank you,” Harry said quickly. “It’s just –” He glanced at the calendar on his desk: May 2. “That’s almost two months away. Are they offering parole?”
Harry nodded sudden gratitude filling his throat and making it difficult to speak. Ron seemed to know what he wanted to say, though, and nodded back, clapping Harry’s shoulder.
The sound of the front door opening made him sit up. He was just shoving his glasses back on his nose when Luna came floating in, a bag of groceries hovering behind her.
Malfoy looked up at him through pale eyelashes and Harry felt a sudden urge to stroke his cheek. He didn’t, though. He took another bite of pizza.
Harry’s head hurt. He opened his eyes a fraction and gasped in pain when light seared his brain. Where was he? What was happening?
“I can just imagine their faces,” he gasped, wiping his eyes. “Oh, Potter. Always such a do-gooder. ‘Brazil, here I come.’ Oh!” And he was off again, holding his stomach and chortling in glee.
Kingsley nodded. “It’s not pleasant,” he replied, also quiet now. “When you broke the egg, it broke the spells, but all that power had to go somewhere. It seems to have all channeled back into Lucius Malfoy at the same time, which is an enormous amount of magical stress on any one person. He...” Kingsley hesitated momentarily. “He won’t be doing magic again, that much I can tell you. It’s possible he won’t wake up again either.” He spread his hands. “I don’t know more than that, but I will ensure that you stay informed, if you want to be.”
—his pulse was strong. Draco realized he was cradling Potter’s head in his lap. His hands, where they had touched Potter’s head, came away sticky with blood. Draco forced himself to breath. Riley would find a healer. Someone would fix this.
“Ah, yes, that classic roommate setup,” Malfoy agreed, his eyes still fixed on the cutting board. Then he winced. “I’m sorry. Yes. That makes sense to me.”
“You’d – you’d better just look for yourself,” she said quickly, and pulled him over to where Ron was standing by the fireplace, looking grimly down at the newspaper.
She cocked her head, her brow wrinkling. “No,” she said slowly, clearly. “Oliver Hathaway no vive aquí.”
Harry stepped out from beneath the cloak, his wand raised. He made sure to let the cloak fall back so that it was still covering Draco. Lucius might already know he was there, but that didn’t mean Harry was going to make any of this easy for him.
Draco seemed to be having trouble speaking. He took a deep breath, while Harry forced himself not to fidget.
Harry felt something inside him loosen – he smiled back, full and genuine. “Nope – and I’m starved. Where to?”
It was never more than twice or three times a week, and always early to late afternoon. Harry was too busy for it to be every day, and too distracted for it to be at a reasonable lunch hour. Malfoy never complained, though, or asked where he’d been the days Harry didn’t come. He seemed slightly surprised each time Harry appeared, as if he thought each previous time had been the last. He was often subdued at first, too, but Harry noticed him relaxing more and more quickly each time. It was a good excuse to see Ron, Hermione, and the girls, too. Harry found himself becoming more and more enamored of Viola by the day. It was easy to see how Malfoy loved her so much, and he delighted in sharing anecdotes and funny stories that made Malfoy’s eyes light up.
He was trying to decide whether to try and strike up a new conversation on his own, or make his way back to Harry, when a voice spoke into his ear right behind him.
With a smile that he hoped looked less grim than it felt, Harry got to his feet and turned to see Malfoy already standing. The other man’s gray eyes were determined above a smile that would hopefully look less pained in grainy newsprint. Drawing a deep breath, Harry took one final look out over the crowd of guests. Hermione was waving, smiling, beside a sullen Ron who nonetheless gave Harry a thumbs-up. Harry smiled back, then turned to Malfoy and again clasped hands. The noise was nearly unbearable now.
Fortunately, every time Harry had brought it up, he had dropped it again almost immediately. Draco was fairly certain this was due to his own total inability to respond properly, and felt embarrassment curling in his chest. It hadn’t yet come to Harry having to force him into anything, but Draco harbored no illusions: if he didn’t get his act together soon, Harry would do what was necessary.
Defense Against the Dark Arts was next. Much as Draco was dreading that class, he found himself unwilling to stay in the Great Hall a moment longer than was necessary, and left as soon as he had eaten what he could stomach of lunch. He could always find a spot to sit and wait until class began, he reasoned. A broad window ledge a few halls away from the classroom was blessedly empty, and he curled up against the window frame, hoping that no one would pass him.
“Now, where shall we start today?” mused the first man as all three circled Draco menacingly. “Why not with a classic?” He pointed his wand at Draco and said, almost casually: “Crucio.”
“Lucius Malfoy is in Azkaban,” Harry said loudly, firmly. “It is my understanding that no one can send letters from inside Azkaban, is that correct Minister?”
After everyone had finished — a process which seemed to Harry to take an exorbitant amount of time — Elena cleared the plates and shooed Viola off to play in her room. She bent close to Malfoy’s ear where he was still sitting at the table and whispered something that Harry did not catch. Malfoy shook his head and squeezed her hand. She nodded once, then straightened.
“We bonded through nightmares and insomnia.” Harry presses her forehead hard against Draco’s. “We’ll be alright. Turn around, I’d want to hold you.”

, but St. Mungo’s floors are unforgiving. When the knocking starts, he startles so hard his reading glasses slip down his nose; no one ever knocks on the front door of his small townhouse, not when all two people who visit him have access to his Floo. He casts spells as he approaches the front door, checking for danger, until finally just spelling the door see-through from his side, and the sight makes him wrench open the door just in time to catch Harry Potter in his arms.
For a brief, lovely moment, Draco’s racing thoughts grind to a halt. He blinks at Harry’s earnest face and lets himself smile, wrapping his hands around the thermos. “Thanks. Thank you, Harry.”
“Kiss me.” Harry’s voice is rough. He raises his head, meeting tender grey eyes glinting in the dim light. “Just… kiss me soft, please.”
“You needed it.” Draco shrugs, inelegant and jerky. His faraway gaze looks exhausted. “We can do it again whenever you’re feeling
“Oh,” Harry breathes, a heartbroken exhale. “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m here now, alright? I’m sorry I panicked, I just didn’t want to– it feels
Harry cuts him off with the deepest kiss Draco’s ever had the grace of receiving. It’s hot and wet and sweet and too much and not enough,
The night spills inky around the wavering headlights of Harry’s car. In the passenger seat, Draco sighs in his sleep, his head lolling against the seat as the road curves. Harry glances at him, bundled up in an old jumper of Harry’s and plaid pajama pants, his feet pale and knobbly where they’re tucked up on the seat. Harry leaves a hand on the steering wheel and reaches out with his other, lightly cupping Draco’s cheek.
But Draco and Harry mellowed out, from reluctantly polite acquaintances to equally surprised friends to content roommates, and the volley of insults somehow morphed into the Untruth Game, as Draco dubbed it. The way Harry explains it to anyone else, it functions as a way for two mildly repressed people to fucking
“Reach for me,” Harry says softly. Draco does, immediately, holding himself up on one elbow to grab Harry’s hair in his other hand and kiss him hard, messy. Harry stretches his body out on top of Draco’s, kissing him down into the mattress and grabbing Draco’s wrists in his hands. “Do you want handcuffs?” he asks, kissing down the side of Draco’s throat.
“Fuck off,” Draco says, but it doesn’t sound as biting as it should. “I regret ever complimenting you.”
Draco, still flushed pink from orgasm, pointedly rolls away from Harry and off the bed. “It’s just three days, for work. It’s not a big deal.”
Draco nods frantically, taking a shaky breath in. He knows how much it turns Harry on when he’s reduced to incoherency, and he loves this, being able to sink into Harry’s confidence. He starts speaking again, his voice trembling faintly. “I was talking to someone, I don’t remember his name, he was certainly rich. And we were sitting– sitting– ah.” There’s an audible smack the same moment Harry pulls out the plug entirely, and Draco writhes as much as he’s able, trying to figure out the source of the sound and pushing down the bereft sensation of emptiness. “We were sitting at our assigned table, and I kept shifting in my seat, because I was trying to get comfortable. And–
“Do you like being told off?” Harry murmurs, pressing his lips against Draco’s jaw, then his bared throat. “You’re so fucking
“We’ll figure it out,” Harry murmurs once they’re settled, his hand burning hot on the skin above Draco’s waistband, under Draco’s rucked up shirt. “I know you don’t want– we’ll figure it out,” he repeats, and Draco slips into sleep before he can parse what Harry stopped himself from saying.
“Draco?” Harry asks, his voice still rough with sleep, and Draco whips around, blinking owlishly at Harry and then flinching when the bacon grease pops. He’s wearing his usual silk pajama set, the top few buttons undone and revealing his collarbones, and his hair is up in a messy bun on top of his head. He’s soft, and blinking sleepily, and Harry can barely breathe through his affection. “What are you doing?”
“No.” A muscle jumps in Harry's clenched jaw, and Draco is struck with the realization that Harry is physically holding himself back. “I need you to tell me you understand that if you need me to stop or slow down, I will.”
Flick your wand, dark skin shifting to pale, rippling rippling. The glamours took longer to learn than you thought but it doesn’t matter when you have nothing better to do when you’ve been fired from the Auror training program with encouragement to go to a Mind Healer for
In the mornings they eat breakfast together, Draco usually shoving food into his mouth as he looks over the morning’s Prophet, especially the articles he contributed to, always self-critical. Harry takes to slapping the paper away from him with a laugh and asking him silly questions instead; Harry’s an unrelenting morning person, it turns out.
“No, it’s…” Harry reaches out slowly, running her finger through the end of Draco’s hair. Draco blinks, her lips parted, and Harry tries not to think about the lovely curve of Draco’s cupid’s bow. “It’s
“Do you think you need Dreamless Sleep?” Draco murmurs one night, smoothing Harry’s curls away from his sweaty forehead. He’s found Harry’s nightmares aren’t loud, nor violent; instead, he just shivers silently and wakes with tears streaming from his eyes. Draco isn’t quite sure if screaming would be better or worse.
, of a fucking good relationship, because you don’t want to even talk about marriage as a possibility? You’re going to hide out here, a place you said you would
the one gagging for it,” he retorts, but he moves up my body anyways until he’s sitting on my chest, his thighs dangerously close to my ears. For a half-second I wonder how he’s going to hold himself up with only the smooth wall of the bed alcove, but just as quickly I dismiss the thought. If I’m to suffocate with Harry’s thighs around me, then so be it.
I look around the living quarters, and put away a scattered game of chess that we’d gotten halfway through last night before Draco decided he was going to start adding ridiculous rules on a whim and I broke every one of them until he was laughing so hard he accidentally knocked over all the pieces. I turn to him, satisfied that nothing else is loose, since I keep everything in my storage rooms strapped down for safety. His eyes have fallen closed but the lines of his body are taut, it’s usual state when he’s awake.
. He turns to place his feet in Harry’s lap, leaning back against the armrest of the sofa. “It was you incessantly begging me to try it.”
“You don’t have to convince me to like you,” Harry says, matching Draco’s low volume, and Draco trembles as Harry steps closer to him, but he doesn’t back away. Harry sets down the spatula and brings his hands up to cradle Draco’s face, as gently as he dares. “Draco, I
He rolls his eyes, clicking his seatbelt. “This ship looks like it’s about to fall apart. I’m impressed that it's even capable of warp speed.”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco replies, turning the ignition over. As he glances over his shoulder to back out of the lot, he holds a hand out absentmindedly, and Harry takes it.
and Harry drops to his knees so fast he has bruises for days, but it doesn’t matter when he blows Draco so hard that Draco nearly blacks out when he comes.
“Why would you think that?” Draco asks belatedly, his voice thinner than he intends. “Harry, why would you think that?”
“It’s both of us,” Ginny stage whispers, eliciting responses that range from vague noises of assent to Ron’s pretend gagging from across the loose circle. “Now! My turn. Point to who you think is the sex expert here. The sexpert, if you will.”
“Can we get food?” he asks as they step through the Floo into his living room, their hands clasped tightly between them. According to Lila, they’re lucky there’s no emotional compulsion to the bond, or a physical compulsion for anything more than touching each other. Draco shudders briefly at the thought of Harry above him, unwilling but brave, trying his best not to show his reluctance at moving any further beyond tolerant friendship with Draco–
“You want me, pet,” Harry croons, watching raptly as Draco’s breathing goes shallow and he momentarily stills, pressing his cheek down onto the sheets. “You know you want me. Just give in.”
The dark, ever-present tangle of anger in Harry’s chest crackles, pushing out against his ribs until he can barely breathe the humid air underneath the blanket. It isn’t fair that Draco is here, throwing a tantrum about Harry’s socks. It isn’t fair that the Dark Mark, puckered and red, taunts Harry from across their room.
“I know you want to be good,” Harry says sweetly. “My darling. I’ll make you feel fantastic, but you need to keep talking.”
The third time, Harry passes out before Draco can catch him on the stoop, and he has to heal a broken nose in addition to dealing with the fact that the blood in Harry’s arms seems to have slowed it’s circulation. He learns that Harry likes too much sugar in his tea, and laughs at even the worst of Draco’s jokes.
Draco turns away from Harry on autopilot, curling up into himself, struck with the fact that Harry could tell Draco was uncomfortable. How? From the lines of his body, from his breathing?
I bite down on his shoulder, keeping my lube covered hand outstretched and away from the sheets, and he yelps, the sound quickly dissolving into laughter.
“Hey,” Harry murmurs. Draco sniffs sharply and blinks awake, his eyes glittering with the reflection of the dash lights. He hums low in his throat, tucking his face further into Harry’s hand.
Harry does, pushing into Draco, kissing his cheeks and jaw and throat and finally his lips, lingering there, reveling in the way Draco
“Oh,” she gasps, catching sight of Draco still sleeping under a blanket of golden sun, and Harry’s feet stop moving. Draco looks — terrible. There are deep purple circles under his eyes and his cheeks are gaunt, nearly skeletal. At Hermione’s outburst Draco startles awake, sitting up and blinking at them blearily before sighing.
. Such blatant want that Draco feels drunk on it. It’s just like the last time, but better, because Draco isn’t mentally calculating an expiration date this time around.
After the fifth time– after Draco thaws the hypothermia-like chill in Harry’s hands that’s turning his nail beds blue– Draco casts a tracking spell on him.
“You kept shifting in your seat?” Harry says, thrusting his hips forward the tiniest bit. The movement is wet and hot and
“You’re not allowed to die,” Draco repeats, quieter. He slides his hands up into his hair, pulling the hair tie out of his messy ponytail and letting his blonde waves fall around his shoulders. It’s uncomfortably quiet, so he gathers his hair back up into a neater ponytail just for something to do with his hands.
“Maybe a countercurse needs to be created?” Hermione says, worry warring with academic interest in her voice. Draco is her friend, too. Or
,” Draco parrots, but he lets Harry heal each of his bruises, one by one, watching Harry with bright eyes the entire time, his expression cautious but undercut by something that looks a little bit like hope.
Over the course of Harry’s outburst, Draco’s gone from annoyed to incredulous; he stares across the desk with wide eyes. “You care about me?”
manage to magically summon him. His easy tone is laced with a warning. “Don’t talk to my boyfriend like that.”
“Can we just–” For a moment, Draco’s nonchalance cracks and his mouth twists fitfully, but then he blinks himself back into a light expression. “Harry, please.”
“You didn’t– hurt me.” Draco presses his face into the crook of Harry’s neck. “I can turn over, if you don’t want to see.”
kids, when we– when you– have them. So I’m going to go out on a limb and assume it’s a sex thing, in which case, that’s
Two minutes in the morning to apply glamours. A long, patrician nose turned pert, grey eyes transformed to flat browngreen, marble skin dusted with freckles. Brassy hair, cropped close to your head, not a glamour– Muggle dye.
Draco sits pale and tired, curled up in the passenger seat of Harry’s car. The radio plays softly, lyrics unintelligible, and Harry keeps both hands on the wheel.
Harry turns her back to Draco, moving until she's nearly in the middle of the couch. Draco’s knees dig into her hips. Harry’s pulse is pounding in her throat, and she fists a hand into the hem of her t-shirt nervously. After a moment, gentle hands thread through her hair, pulling out the hair tie with much more care than Harry expected. Her curls tumble down her shoulders and back, and Malfoy makes a small sound.
That’s the right thing to say– Draco’s fascinated by Muggle things that seem impossible without magic, like bubble wands and washing machines. He moves closer to Harry, curiosity warring with trepidation on his face. Harry holds out his hands and wiggles his fingers.
“I love you,” Draco says against Harry’s curls, quietly, because even after all this time it still feels like a secret– like something precious. “You can move, now.” With another kiss to Draco’s chest Harry thrusts forward slowly, planting both of his hands on the bed to hold himself up as he bottoms out. They both pant into the feeling, frozen for a moment before Draco shifts, trying– impossibly– to take more of Harry.
“It always feels too dark.” Malfoy pulls her knees up to her chest, a white flash in Harry's periphery. “I just don’t sleep much.”
Today Draco is sitting on his crisp white sheets looking pale and drawn, though whether from the strain of the bond or just anxiety Harry can’t tell. The knot of heavy affection in Harry’s chest tightens with the desire to simply hold Draco until his shoulders aren’t slumped. Last week he cried when he came– Harry always pretends he doesn’t see, to leave Draco with some semblance of his pride.
“I’m not going to kiss you until I’ve earned it,” Harry amends, and Draco softens immediately, his lips parting as he exhales. “And I
“Yeah,” Harry replies, his voice coming out smaller than he intends, and Draco covers his face with his hands and laughs until he sobs.
. There’s still room for Harry to pull and be safe, but he lets the chain slide loose, just a bit. “I don’t think that’s where you want me to fuck you.”
“You’re fucking fantastic, I knew you’d get it,” Draco says, his words muffled into Harry’s neck. Harry wraps his arms around Draco, holding him back tightly, and Draco blames what he says next on the warmth of Harry’s breath against his shoulder. “Untruth. No one loves you.”
“Let me kiss you,” Harry says, a question in his voice, and Draco nods frantically, stopping only when Harry’s lips meet his. Draco tastes like sleep and cinnamon, and he whimpers softly as Harry kisses him deeper, pushing him back against the counter before wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. Draco fists Harry’s shirt, insistently pulling him closer, kissing Harry back soft and slow. When they break apart Draco is panting and Harry is dizzy with happiness, unable to stop his smile.
,” Draco shouts, trying to fight against the cuffs on his wrists and ankles holding him spread-eagle on his stomach across their bed. Harry thrusts into him again, hard, grabbing a fistful of Draco’s hair and tugging until Draco cranes his head back. “Harry, Harry, god fuck–”
“Don’t say it like that,” Harry replies. “You’re– you’re good. You’re trying so hard to be good, and I can see it.”
“Potter, what the fuck?” Draco snaps, more out of panic than anything, because Harry’s hair smells singed where it’s pressed against Draco’s cheek. “Potter.”
Harry presses one last kiss to Draco’s jaw before sitting up and shifting his body until his thighs bracket Draco’s head. Draco looks up and meets Harry’s eyes, seeking the adoration and heat that he instantly finds. Harry’s tawny skin is flushed, his body blazing hot where it’s pressed to Draco’s. For a moment they’re suspended like that, the lines of Harry’s body anticipatory; then Draco brings his hands up to press flat to Harry’s thighs and Harry moves fluidly, gripping onto the headboard and moving up Draco’s body. Draco easily wraps his mouth around Harry’s cock, groaning at the feeling as Harry gasps above him.
“It’ll be over soon anyways,” Harry says when they break apart. His breath dances warm across Draco’s cheek. “We’ll be graduated and no one can bother us.”
“‘Course.” Harry falls silent, listening to the road rumble underneath the tires. When he glances at Draco, he’s startled to find Draco’s eyes already on him. “Are you alright?”
“Draco?” Harry turns to him fully, his brow furrowed. He’s in a thick green jumper and faded pyjama pants that drag at his heels, sleep rumpled and soft. “Do you want something different?”
“I– can I–” Draco’s eyes are wild, and a strangely vulnerable expression flashes across his face. It makes something twist in Harry’s chest and he growls, thrusting his hips forward until the tip of his cock pushes against Draco’s fingertips. “Ah, fuck,” Draco gasps, wrapping his hand fully around Harry’s cock. “Fuck, you’re big. Fuck. Okay.”
“They signed her right after she left Hogwarts,” he said, still feeling a glow of pride for his long-time friend. “You’ve never seen anyone so excited. I thought she was going to just start flying without a broomstick, gravity be damned.” He chuckled. “Ron was thrilled, of course—and I think, just a little bit jealous.”
– but it had peaked Harry’s interest. “There still a lot to figure out,” Hermione had said at the end, “but it just occurred to me. Since his kidnapping Viola was really in her best interest, and she loves him so much, he can’t be all bad...”
“Well, I should think he’d want to Imperius them,” another voice responded. This one, a woman’s voice, was slightly higher. Harry could hear her much better. “At this point, he’s gotten a huge chunk of the Ministry, which can only help our cause. I really think that makes more sense than killing them all.”
“What—what happened?” Draco asked, trying to find the source of the blood still seeping from Potter’s head.
, Harry.” Ron brought both hands up, then dropped them to the table, as if at a loss. “You just – seem to have forgiven him, and moved on, without any trouble, and I – I still don’t really understand why you agreed to fucking –
“Pretty well, yeah,” Harry said absently. He supposed it was true, too. The nightmares hadn’t been any worse than usual. He filled the cups with pumpkin juice and slid one across the counter in Malfoy’s direction. This put him face to face with the other man for the first time that morning, and Harry felt himself gaping.
“Bullshit,” he said sternly. “You still have to choose one of my options. I should tell you: the longer it takes you to decide, the more likely it’s going to be Option #2.”
“Wonderful!” Shaver said when the last sixth-year Ravenclaw had given her name – Eileen Caraway – and what she was excited to learn: occlumency. “We will begin with some review.”
“Barely over an hour.” There’s a soft whisper of words and Draco shivers; Harry can wordlessly cast, of course, but he always says spells out loud when Draco is blindfolded like this.
“We’ll need an objective measurement,” Harry says, popping his head up to meet Draco’s gaze, matching the competitiveness and exhilaration he finds there.
When he tips over the edge with Draco’s confident, gentle fingers wrapped around his cock, his come lands across Draco’s perfect, pink lips, and it feels like a gift.
,” Harry says fiercely, and then his lips find the corner of Draco’s mouth, shifting until they’re kissing properly. Harry rolls on top of Draco, his hand cupping Draco’s jaw, the coolness of his rings digging into Draco’s skin like kisses of their own. When Harry deepens the kiss, he hums, soft and reassuring, the sound sparking along every one of Draco’s nerves. They kiss, and kiss, and kiss; Draco’s thoughts are flat, whited-out. There’s no way to neatly slot this into what he knows, so he doesn’t even try, just lets Harry’s kiss rearrange his entire understanding of what is true and what is not.
Ginny taps her bottom lip. “Let’s go with the most general knowledge. I honestly do not even wanna think about what having sex with some of you is like.”
“Thank you. Decide if you would like me to come on your face with you sitting like this, or across your back with you on all fours.” Harry stands, efficiently stripping off his jeans and jumper. He ties his hair back in a low bun with a hair tie Draco slipped onto his wrist earlier. “Afterwards, I’m going to eat you out, and if you’re good and don’t make any sound, I’m going to fuck you. That part isn’t an option. You’re mine to use.”
“It’s not pretty,” Harry says quietly, feeling the need to warn Draco. “My nightmares. Before we broke up Ginny said it was– bad. If you need to tell me to leave I will, I just–”
“I do mean it,” Harry says, seeing through Draco’s words to the question underneath. Without his usual harsh facade Draco seems so vulnerable, so young, and Harry shifts to wrap his arms around Draco’s slim waist. “I’m sorry I didn’t– that I couldn’t do this before–”
“Harry?” he calls, thoughts still slightly muddled by the lingering edge of dreams, before grabbing his wand and padding into the living room.
Draco takes a step back, his heel catching on the fireplace as he realizes he’s hard. He’s hard, and chastised, and remorseful, and fucking
Neville didn’t say anything for long moments. When he did, he spoke slowly, carefully, as if this were not the first time he had thought these things, but perhaps the first time he had said them out loud.
“Jesus, Malfoy, I’m just offering you a sandwich. Not everything has to be some weird transaction,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. To illustrate the point, he pulled up a chair that had been left in front of one of the other cells and unwrapped his own sandwich before taking an exaggerated bite. “It’s called lunch. Ever heard of it?”
“Sorry,” he said desperately to Draco as he unrolled the letter. Draco nodded silently, still poised in the middle of the kitchen.
“Alright. Be careful,” Harry said with a glance over his shoulder. “If I’m not back out here in 20 minutes, get out of here and come back with the others.”
“It’s too late for that, Malfoy,” he said, throwing a grin over his shoulder. “I want to see Draco Malfoy on horseback and that’s all there is to it.” Draco sighed and followed him.
“Yes. Yes of course.” He shook his head as if to clear it. “It’s just – does Madam Rosmerta still...?” He trailed off, and Harry nodded slowly as realization hit him.
“But you’re getting there, and you’re doing well, right?” Harry pressed on determinedly. Draco nodded hesitantly, as if unsure what he was agreeing to. “And I really like not feeling stressed all the time. I think we should celebrate.”
“It’s good to see you, Draco,” she said softly. Then, quieter still: “I never thought you should have gone to Azkaban.” She clasped his hand quickly and turned away, leaving Draco staring after her.
They claimed a table toward the back and sat down without saying anything else. Harry was just about to say something – he wasn’t sure what – when Clara ambled over to them.
It ended with the wave of four wands, and bands of metal that appeared around their ring fingers – Malfoy’s a pure silver inscribed with curling snakes, Harry’s a dark bronze with leaves cut into the metal. Then they were walking hand in hand, this time down one of the other paths that led toward another door that took them back out into the midsummer afternoon and into a cacophony of voices, shouts, cheers, and ringing bells. Flowers filled the air and songbirds burst from the ends of wands to fly above their heads. Harry heard Hermione’s laughter and Ron’s gruff voice close to his ear: “Congratulations, mate.” He turned to give his friend a smile but they were already making their way toward the line of port keys arranged in the field that would take select guests to the reception. He would see them soon, he knew.
In the warm, golden light of morning, Draco turned and saw Harry Potter curled up behind him, a strong brown arm thrown over his waist. The other man seemed to be fast asleep, but as Draco looked at him, his eyes opened. Those green eyes. Draco wanted to fall into them, to be swallowed up by them, to swallow them whole. He smiled, tentatively.
Once a Malfoy, always a Malfoy, he thought grimly. He still kept his eyes lowered though, watching as Kingsley clasped his hands.
“Yeah—it probably made him meaner,” Ron grumbled. Hermione just looked pained, the worry in her brown eyes searing Harry’s soul. He stood up quickly – too quickly – and poured himself a drink, pretending he didn’t see the look Ron and Hermione exchanged. He felt better with the half-full glass in his hand.
“You have it,” Draco responded, not meeting Harry’s eyes. His voice was wooden, as if he was repeating something from rote. “‘The Malfoy fortune shall be held in trust by Mr. Potter until such time as Mr. Malfoy is deemed suitable, by the Ministry of Magic, to handle his own financials once more.’” When Harry didn’t immediately respond, Draco rushed on. “Of course, I understand, and will do whatever you think is best—”
Harry turned and watched Malfoy walk towards the door, his hand shot out of its own accord and grabbed Malfoy’s wrist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone laughed at that, and the game continued well into the night, Harry and Draco sneaking glances at one another when they thought the other wasn’t looking and verbally sparring whenever the opportunity presented itself. The ice had been broken between the Slytherins and the rest of the returning eighth years, there were still miles to go to build a bridge that had never existed in the first place, there were still many apologies to be made. Draco decided that night that he wanted to befriend these people, to do that he would need to work very hard to gain their trust, he'd started that process with Potter already.
The statement was a calculated one, no one was supposed to drink, the room was supposed to remain silent and it was supposed to impress upon the group that he was not a bad person, just a kid whose only options had been to join up or die. Draco had miscalculated however, as soon as the words left his mouth there was a sharp intake of breath from Granger and his eyes found Potters. He glanced around the room and noticed that everyone else was also staring at Potter, he coughed in an attempt to draw the attention away from Potter and opened his mouth to apologize but Harry cut him off.
Dracos eyes shot up, “What are you sorry for, Potter? You’re the bloody savior of the wizarding world, and you’re sorry? Honestly!?” Draco sneered.
Draco took it reluctantly but paused before putting the bottle to his lips, “You do know it isn’t you I fancy, right Pans?”
The room got quiet again, “That was out of line mate.” said Harry in a dark tone. He thought Justin might have been trying to make a joke, but he thought Malfoy might be sensitive about it, so he tried to catch his eye but he seemed to be intentionally avoiding his gaze.
Harry reached for the bottle but it had already moved to Dean who was blushing with his whole body, Harry hadn’t seen that one coming. It was then passed to Pansy, who didn’t look embarrassed at all. Harry reached for it again but was intercepted but Malfoy, who decided, with a little help from the alcohol, to maintain eye contact with Potter while he took his sip.
“You did more than enough. You kept my mother and I out of Azkaban, after everything my family did, that’s more than we could ever ask for. Merlin knows you didn’t have to do it, no one would have blamed you if you’d left us both to rot. I wouldn’t have blamed you, that’s for sure. I definitely would have deserved it.” He glanced at Potters shocked face, “You have nothing to be sorry for. Me, on the other hand, Potter I have everything to be sorry for, I know I’ve never said it but I am profoundly sorry. I could never make up for everything my family and I have done.”
They eat their breakfast and chatter about their new classes for the eighth year. Professor McGonagall wasn’t sure at first what kind of curriculum she could provide for these students who had survived the war, after thinking about it for a long time she decided that what these students needed most was to learn how to navigate a peaceful world as adults. So she put in place a few new classes, in addition to a few of the old.  The eighth year students will be taking Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Wizard Government, and Career Skills.
“I forgave you a long time ago.” Harry glanced over at Malfoy, he looked shaken and his face was drained of all color. “You were just a kid, Malfoy. We both were, we both had so many choices thrust upon us at such a young age,” Harry’s voice rose as he spoke, the words spilling out of his mouth before he could process what he was saying, “and they weren’t even choices. As if you had a bloody choice Malfoy! Voldemort was living in your fucking house! As if I had a bloody choice ‘Oh, sorry I don’t really feel like sacrificing my life so the bloody Dark Lord can be killed and ensure the safety of the entire fucking wizarding world!’ right! We were only kids.” The last statement coming out in barely a whisper, Harry gasped for breath, his face was bright red and his hands were shaking with barely contained rage.
He and Malfoy had spent 2 whole hours sitting in the kitchens just talking and eating. It had seemed as easy as breathing to get along with Malfoy, Harry thought. It almost made him wonder why they hadn’t been friends during their years at Hogwarts….almost. Harry knew why.
“I’ll go,” Justin Finch-Fetchley said quickly, he looked around at Draco with a pointed look, “Never have I ever been a Deatheater.” He held the bottle out to him with a smug smile on his round face.
Ron coughed loudly, drawing the two boys out of their trance. “We’re all still here, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
Dean grinned and passed over the bottle, Draco took a hearty swig and the conversation started back up again. As everyone chatted on about classes and the new drama going on in the halls of Hogwarts Harry found his mind wandering to thoughts he had avoided for a long time, with the a war going on there hadn't been time to entertain such notions.
Harry recoiled, “Yeah, I’m bloody sorry Malfoy.” he spat, “I’m sorry I couldn’t do more,” his tone softened a bit, “your mother, she saved my life and she still got 5 years house arrest.”
Sometimes, when Draco was at his lowest, he wondered if he really did have a choice and he just wasn’t brave enough to make it, should he have disobeyed the Dark Lords orders for the greater good of the wizarding world even if it meant he and his parents would be killed?
After the trial, Granger set him up with a liaison that helped him find a place to live when he couldn’t bear to go back to Malfoy Manor where memories of the Dark Lord still lingered in the walls. Granger actually spearheaded a task force to help rehabilitate those who had lost everything in the war, she always knows what needs to be done. Draco would never admit this out loud, but she really is the brightest witch of their time.
He plopped down between Hermione and Ron in a daze, and smiled into his goblet as he took a large gulp of pumpkin juice. He was distracted, thinking of the way Malfoy's whole face lit up when he talked about quidditch. Harry hadn't realized how much Malfoy loved the game, during their previous years at Hogwarts it had seemed as though Malfoy was just doing anything he could to one up Harry, and while that might have been true, Draco loved the game. He loved the strategy of it and they had spent a whole hour this morning discussing one of Draco's favorite strategists and the different plays that he'd designed.
“Never have I ever been excited to take a test.” He nudged Hermione in the ribs, Ron guffawed and Hermione turned beet red as she reluctantly took the bottle from Harry.
The room was suddenly quiet and Draco hesitated for a moment he looked at the judgmental stares of the other students . He and Potter might be getting on but he hadn’t had the opportunity to make amends with anyone else yet, to be frank he’d probably had the opportunity but lacked the courage to face the rejection he was sure he’d receive if he tried. He glanced at Potter and couldn’t help but notice how good he looked in the firelight, his face flushed from the alcohol and his eyes bright with laughter.
Draco grinned, this was good whiskey. If he’s being honest with himself, he really wanted Potter to say that it was him, who he fancied. But Draco knew that he’d been on the wrong side of the war, there was no way the The Chosen one could possibly fancy him. But hey, a guy can dream right? “Yeah maybe I would.”
The nightmares started in 6th year, then it was a vivid image of himself murdering Albus Dumbledore playing over and over, during the war it became the Dark Lord killing his parents and then turning the killing curse on Draco himself, after the war it turned into the worst combination of everything that had ever terrified him, his parents being tortured, being hit with the sectumsempra curse, standing in the astronomy tower pointing his wand at the headmaster, flying over the roaring flames of fiend fire,and the worst of all the ringing voice of Lord Voldemort declaring that Harry Potter was dead.
“Let me walk with you. I was headed there too.” Draco looked at him for a moment before his body relaxed and he gave Harry a cautious nod.
He moved as quietly as he could into the common room that he shares with everyone who came back to Hogwarts for their eighth year, there was already a fire crackling in the hearth and he saw a dark figure emerging from a door on the other end of the common room. They locked eyes for a moment before Harry coughed quietly to break the silence.
Draco looked at his feet and made a rash decision, without any thought at all, without even knowing why he did it, he said, “I’m starving….uh I was headed to the kitchens, do you….uh,” he chickened out, “never mind, I’ll leave now.” he said it all in a rush, a little bit too quietly and his face flushed bright red as he pushed past Potter.
Draco scowled, “Shove off Zabini, I was not.” Draco hesitated, he wanted to tell his friends about his enlightening morning with Potter but years of living under his fathers thumb had made him slow to share. He was trying to get more comfortable but this felt...private. He glanced down the table to where the Gryffindors were sitting bunched together too close for comfort and caught Potters eye, the prat had a huge grin plastered on his face and when he saw Draco it got wider, Potter moved to wave at him but at the last second seemed to think better of it.
“Huh?” He asked, Ron and Hermione looked at him expectantly. They had obviously been asking him something and he’d been too deep in his thoughts of asking Malfoy if he’d like to play quidditch with him sometime to notice. “Sorry, “ he ginned sheepishly, “what did you ask?”
Later that morning Harry went down to breakfast with a huge smile plastered on his face that, no matter how hard he tried, just wouldn’t go away.
“Harry, there’s nothing wrong with you fancying boys. I love you just the same and your parents would have loved you no matter what, I'm sure of it…” she had paused and smiled, “But don’t you dare lead Ginny on!”
“Bloody brilliant,” exclaimed Ron, “Only problem is we don’t have a lot of fire whiskey left.” He held the bottle up and swished the meager remains.
They looked at each other for a moment, their eyes brimming with what they both desperately wanted to say, neither daring.
“I can do a refilling charm, don’t worry about it Ron.” said Harry quietly. He murmured the charm, and the bottle refilled.
As the three Slytherins found their seats in front of the fire Draco could feel Potter’s stare burning into his back, and once he was seated he found the other boy’s eyes, Potter dropped his gaze quickly and everyone sat in an uncomfortable silence until Draco coughed, “Well pass the whiskey Thomas.”
Harry thought it was funny really, that anyone could forget that he had killed Lord Voldemort. He wanted to laugh until it hurt, but no one else would get it, they would think he was crazy.
Draco frowned, meeting Harry’s gaze for a moment. Cool, cloudy grey searching warm green before answering, “Nightmares.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Harry smiled, He would quite like to know who it was that Malfoy fancied. It probably wasn’t him, there was too much history, too much animosity...still he couldn’t help but hope.
“It’s fine Potter, I was one.” Draco fixed Finch-Fetchley with his best Malfoy sneer and without breaking his gaze took a deep drink of the fire whiskey.  “Guess that makes it my turn?” He asked, then without waiting for an answer, “Never have I ever killed someone.”
Draco’s next goal was Hermione, he thought she was a good place to start. If he befriended Granger surely Weasley would follow behind shortly and Draco thought that if his friendship with Potter were to progress beyond friendship, as he desperately wanted it to, he would need to make nice with Potter's friends. It was going to be difficult, but like everything in his life right now, it was a work in progress.
He let his mind wander as he looked over the grounds, he thought back to his trial, he still can’t believe that Harry Potter, the actual savior of the wizarding world himself, had testified on his behalf at a time when Draco didn’t believe he deserved to be defended, if he’s being honest he still doesn’t think he deserved it. He kept both Draco and his mother out of Azkaban.
Hermione scrutinized his reaction, Harry’s eyes lit up but his grin faded. He wanted to tell them about hanging out with Malfoy, but something holds him back. Will they understand? Will they get that he’s really remorseful, and actually quite nice? Hermione might but Ron, he’s not so sure. He realizes he’s been sitting there staring at Ron for a beat too long, and he decided to keep this morning to himself.
Draco was taken aback. They had stopped walking somewhere in the middle of Harry’s rant. He took a step towards Harry and without thinking, he took Harry’s hands in his own, he lifted them to his lips and pressed a chaste kiss into them. He held them in his own until Harry stopped shaking and his face had returned to a normal color. Before Draco released him, he lifted Harry’s hands to his lips once more and whispered, “Thank you.”
They walked in a silence that wasn’t quite comfortable for a while until Draco asked, “What are you doing up this early, Potter?”
Where the hell did that come from? Did he really think Potter was fit? The answer to that was obvious, of course he did. God he had a lot to think about, he was about to say no but before he had a chance to answer Pansy decided for him, “We’d love to.”
Draco sat bolt upright in his four poster bed drenched in sweat and gasping for breath, he stood up and walked to the window and looked out at the early morning sky, grey blue over the dew covered grounds. The smell of the morning air calming his nerves. The nightmares were getting better, he thought, really they were, or maybe he was just getting used to them. Though how one gets used to watching the Dark Lord torture their parents night after night, he’ll never understand.
But tonight, in the warm firelight and the happy atmosphere and under the influence of firewhiskey his thoughts drifted to the way Malfoys blond hair gleamed in the blaze of the fire, and the way his genuine smile was so much sweeter than the callous smirk he so often wore. And the more he thought, the more obvious the thought that he had so often dismissed became, he fancied Malfoy.
Kingsley nodded slightly, but his eyebrows were still raised. “That is correct, Harry. Still, Lucius Malfoy appears to have written Draco several letters over the past several months. See for yourself.” He was holding them out.
“Having a hard time seeing past the bloke who mercilessly taunted his family for years, repeatedly attacked his best friend, and started a war?” Draco’s mouth quirked in something that was not a smile. “I get that, I really do.” His voice grew earnest. “And he can hate me all he wants, but I really don’t want this…um…marriage to mess up any of your—"
Harry laughed, relief settling beside the tension coiled in his stomach. “Thank you both,” he said, giving Hermione’s hand a squeeze and taking a long drink.
Draco let the words settle to the floorboards. He felt them sink into his mind like stones to the bottom of a murky pond. Then he did the only thing he could do. He started to laugh. It had been years since Draco had laughed, and he wondered if this was what laughter had always felt like: knives gathering in his belly, scraping his throat raw. Tears gathered in his eyes and he sat back, chest heaving.
“My mum, though – she told me it was a year earlier, when I was three and she was getting ready for a party and dropped her earrings. Apparently, I levitated them back up for her so she wouldn’t have to bend down.” Malfoy laughed. It sounded forced. “So, let’s go with that one. I like to think I've always been helpful.”
“Do you want company?” she asked quietly, looking around quickly. Harry did the same. A few other guests had heard Kingsley’s voice, but most of them had turned back to their previous conversations. A few reporters had perked up their ears, though, and were making their way over. Harry grimaced.
“He’s gone!” said the first one, pointing uselessly. The second and third ones turned to him, glaring.
” Lucius crowed. “And you had no idea, did you Potter? My Imperius spells are nigh undetectable now, and I can maintain oh so many of them at a time. Isn’t dementor power a treat?” He waved his wand airily and Kingsley did a strange little pirouette in the middle of the room. “Say something to our guests, Minister, won’t you?”
It took Harry a few moments to find a corner of Diagon Alley that was relatively empty; when he saw a deserted space under the awning of a closed apothecary’s shop, he grabbed Draco’s upper arm and pulled him to a stop in the shadows. Harry glanced around quickly: no reporters that he could see, and the only other shoppers in the area were a family of five young children with one harried-looking, and very distracted, man. Perfect.
Personally, Draco doubted that very much, although he had to concede that when they had finished bringing in the seams of the dress robes he was to wear (when had he gotten so thin?), he did look less like a prisoner playing dress-up and more like a husband-to-be. More like himself; more like a Malfoy. Draco turned away from the mirror, nausea curling in the pit of his stomach.
Warden’s office was austere. No space wasted on things like pictures frames, or family photos, or paint. Just gray walls, a single desk holding two neat stacks of paper, and a cushioned chair in which the small woman now sat. Draco had been shoved into the room’s only other chair, an uncomfortable metal contraption not unlike the one deep inside the Ministry of Magic: the one he had sat in while the Wizengamot sentenced him to fifty years in Azkaban. This chair, too, had sprung to life as soon as he sat down, cinching his wrists to the chair’s arms with thick leather cuffs under Warden’s sharp gaze. Lest anyone doubt the strength of the cuffs, lines of shimmering steel could be seen where the leather had been reinforced, and Draco was certain they contained spells he would be hard-pressed to undo even if he had his wand. The cuffs were much more comfortable than the iron chains at the Ministry, however. Draco had to admit he appreciated that.
“Thank you, Professor,” he said quietly, knowing it was inadequate to convey the depth of his gratitude but hoping she could read it in his eyes. “I appreciate your offer more than I can say. Of course, I will have to check with my husband…”
Before Harry could say anything, Draco stepped out from behind him. He had stopped shaking, but his eyes were fixed on the floor.
His good mood did not last. The pointed indifference from other students in his first two classes gave way to sidelong glances, muttered epithets, and even a Stinging Hex that singed the edge of his robe before he could put it out. Draco looked around quickly, but was met with dozens of hard stares. Any one of them could have thrown the hex, and none of them would give anyone up.
“Hmm, what’s that?” Draco asks, looking up at me with half-lidded eyes as I straddle his hips again.
“Dance with me,” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s hand and twirling himself underneath Draco’s arm, catching a glimpse of Draco’s bright smile before he’s dropped into a dip, Draco’s hands strong against his back. When Draco pulls him back up they meet in a kiss, Harry cupping his hands underneath Draco’s jaw as though he’s holding the world in his palms; he has a feeling that he is.
“Everything,” Draco gasps, his entire heart shattering as Harry grabs his wrists and slams them up against the wall. Lights are flashing around Draco, behind his eyelids. “I wanted everything, but I don’t deserve– I can’t–
“Fuck–” Harry’s hand strokes Draco’s cock languidly, too loose to be any relief, and Draco turns his eyes to Harry, feeling frantic. “Harry, please.”
.” Harry easily cleans them up with magic, then brings the covers up over their bodies as Draco burrows even closer to Harry’s chest. “I love when you’re clingy after sex.”
, Draco Malfoy. You are funny and so good and you are so much more than the Mark on your arm and if a man can’t see that then he doesn’t deserve–”
.” Draco chokes on his breath as Harry strokes his cock once, stopping as soon as Draco cuts himself off.
Harry is everything and everything is Harry, and Draco’s orgasm is right there, if he could just– touch–
“Potter!” Draco says, much too loudly, and Harry’s eyes go wide. “You idiot! You can’t just barge into my
Before I can tell him that he’s the first person to be truly nice to me in a very long time, despite his penchant for sarcasm, sleep insistently tugs me under.
Draco turns her head sharply to the side, then lowers herself to burrow against Harry’s neck again. “Not like you. I’m all– pointy.”
“I’m going to have to get a new tattoo,” Draco says, and Harry stares at him dumbfounded until Draco presents his upturned left arm, the skin smooth and clear. Dropping into a chair next to the bed Harry traces his hands over Draco’s skin, laughing incredulously.
“Harry. I do want you.” Draco’s voice is rough, dragged over his tongue unwillingly, but he didn’t know Harry wanted him. This.
“I need you.” Your voice is gritty, frustrated, why doesn’t he understand, doesn’t he remember, dark night alone in the common room placing his hand in yours skin to skin light flooding from your open mouth?
. He kisses back with all of his desperation, all of his fears and affection, pushing Harry back into the living room. Harry tightens his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulling Draco even impossibly closer for a moment before gently tugging him away. “I’ll quit my job. I thought– I thought it was supposed to be like this, I didn’t know… I didn’t know. And I wasn’t allowed to say anything.”
Harry pokes Draco right in the arse, and Draco swats at him, unable to stop his helpless giggles. “Stop, you are the worst, the
Harry smirks, raising himself up to his knees before slowly sliding down Draco’s cock again. One hand is behind him, pushing the dildo into Draco with small thrusts, and he licks a stripe up his other hand before letting it drift down to the rosy tip of his own cock. As Draco watches, Harry closes his fingers completely around his cock and then throws his head back with a gasp.
Harry blinks, slowly becoming aware of the floor under his knees and Draco’s hands cradling his face. Someone is breathing raggedly, and he belatedly realizes it’s him.
Harry reaches his hands across the distance between their bodies and Draco meets him in the middle, tangling their fingers together. For a while they sit in comfortable silence, Draco’s eyes flicking between their joined hands and Harry’s face.
Harry grunts as Draco gets his free hand around Harry’s ribs, grabbing onto Harry’s shirt and attempting to shove him away. In retaliation Harry grips his wrist tight enough to bruise, twisting Draco’s arm until he yelps and stops squirming. While Draco is taller, and could match Harry in terms of strength, he always gives into Harry so beautifully when they play.
“My actual body, cock. The strap-on, dick.” Harry tightens the strap around his thighs, and Draco wants to touch him so badly he could scream– Harry’s thighs are strong, his muscles rippling as he climbs back onto the bed and settles between Draco’s legs. He gazes intently at Draco as his palm becomes slick without a word and he begins to slowly stroke his dick.
“No, it’s…It’s really nice,” he said quietly, and gave Harry a small, slightly strained smile. “I’m sorry, I’m very tired…”
With a start, Draco realized that the low hum of students on the other side of the Great Hall doors was getting louder. Breakfast must have finished. He suddenly very much did not want to be framed in the doorway when it opened for the entire student body to see.
“I don’t know what Warden told you,” he began. “I don’t know what Shaver thinks he’s doing, and I don’t know what Kingsley has to do with any of this, but I promise you, right now: to me, you are my husband, full stop.” He squeezed Draco’s hands. “No strings attached, no conditions, no catches. No sending you back to Azkaban if you annoy me.”
He was just about to pull out, sickened, when the scene changed dramatically. Narcissa Malfoy was there, lying in a bed and looking pale and haggard. Malfoy was sitting by her head, holding a small crying, wiggling bundle and staring at his mother. Miles strode in and bent over Narcissa, caressing her cheek tenderly.
“It just got delivered. Sorry, mate,” Ron said softly, handing him the front page. Harry swallowed hard, prepared for the worst.
Suddenly, a figure slipped out of the door of Miles’s apartment building and Harry moved himself closer. A tall, thin man holding a child, both of them wrapped in heavy coats. Harry couldn’t see their faces, but from the gleam of a streetlight on silver-blond hair, the man was clearly Malfoy. When the small child sobbed, suddenly, she had Viola’s voice.
“What’s this about?” he asked, his voice coming out sharper than he intended. Draco’s eyes flashed up at him, then back down to the floor. Kingsley shook his head, a frown creasing his forehead.
“What would you say,” Lucius continued, gaining volume. “If I told you that I am not only followed, but
“Mm-hmm,” he nodded with a tired grin. “You’re looking at one of the youngest Aurors ever accepted to the Ministry’s top team. Hired me right out of Hogwarts and I haven’t had a day off since.” He laughed shortly, looking back at the ruined map. “It can get stressful, but I guess it still beats fighting Death Eaters from the Room of Requirement.”
“No!” Harry realized he had spoken in unison with Malfoy. He could only watch, though, helpless as Miles picked Viola up by the collar of her dress and shook her violently.
Draco spent the remainder of the weekend wondering if he should tell Harry about his father’s letter.
Harry winced. “I guess I deserve that. Let me just grab my pajamas and a change of clothes and then we can go to bed.”
“The hospital? With what money?” Miles shook his head. “Give the baby to me and keep giving her water. She’ll recover soon.”
was still echoing in his head as he climbed out of the carriage, but at least now he had his body under control. Residual fear and shame mingled with embarrassment as he thought of what Potter must think of him now. Afraid of a few hecklers. Panicking at nothing. Already needy, incompetent. He didn’t even understand why those words had opened such a storm of emotion in him. The Azkaban guards had never put words to why they treated him and the other Death Eaters so cruelly. And once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. He should have been used to it by now.
“Yes, very good,” Harry answered, motioning for Draco to stay seated. “Ron and Hermione invited us over for dinner tonight – what do you think?”
“That’s how restorative justice works,” Hermione had insisted to Kingsley. “It’s based on trust. And a sponsor to check in with him on a regular basis for the first year, to make sure everything’s going well.”
Harry was watching Malfoy, so he saw the look of slight wariness turn to one of surprise. Then a smile spread across the other man’s face and he glanced up at Harry, still grinning.
“I used to tell her that the oven was a tiny sun, so she shouldn’t get too close to it,” he said, chuckling. “Glad Weasley can use that to get her to eat her vegetables.”
. He wasn’t quite sure how he felt about that. But first, he had to get on a broomstick for the first time since the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Let’s go,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s hand, which was bony and too light in his own. They stepped over the three fallen men and headed up the stairs. If Draco stepped on the men’s faces a little too heavily to be completely accidental, well, Harry wasn’t going to mention it. He wanted to do worse, but he knew they didn’t have much time.
There were no guards in the room they were keeping him in, but no windows either. He hadn’t slept, of course. He was very hungry, incredibly thirsty. Didn’t think he could eat or drink even if someone brought him food, though. His stomach was in knots, although the rest of his body felt curiously numb. He wondered, absently, if anyone would come for him, or if this was to be his punishment: slowly dying of thirst and starvation, chained to a chair in a room far from anyone who loved him. Who had loved him.
“How did you know to smash the egg, anyway?” Kingsley asked suddenly. “The Aurors who examined the scene after we left said that it exhibited no signs of being any kind of spell focus, let alone a focus for dozens of Imperius curses.” Harry had been wondering the same thing.
Draco knelt without question, and they sat there beneath the cloak as the three men from earlier came back down the stairs. They were talking to each other, but stopped abruptly when they saw the empty manacles dangling from the posts.
“Yeah,” Harry said quickly. “New robes, new books, everything.” He took another bite of soup. “Well, I could certainly use a trip to Diagon Alley – mind if I tag along?”
“Mr. Potter has already agreed,” Kingsley cut in, and Draco felt his mouth fall open. His eyes flew to Kingsley’s face before he could stop them; Warden’s fingers twitched to her wand and Draco flinched, dropping his eyes again, but not before he had glimpsed on Kingsley’s face: earnestness. Honesty. The man was not lying, at least not that he knew of. Harry Potter had agreed to marry Draco Malfoy. It was nearly unthinkable.
It was not, in any conceivable way, a question. Draco nodded slowly. Weasley’s eyes seemed to be boring into his skull. Then he pushed him aside with a mumbled curse. Draco hit his head against the wall and bit back a grunt. He would not let Weasley know he had hurt him. He could not.
“Like someone he loved was dying,” she replied after a moment. Then, faster: “Harry, I don’t know what happened in there, but you’ve been unconscious for days and we haven’t heard anything from Draco. Kingsley has him but something doesn’t feel right. Oh, I wanted to wait until you were feeling better, but –”
– was crowding up against him and Harry’s arms were full of soft, pale skin and Draco’s thin hips and his hair –
. The cell to which he led Malfoy was halfway down the hall. A narrow, hard cot stretched along one wall, and there was a toilet in the opposite corner. Other than that, the walls and floor were bare, spelled stone, making it impossible for prisoners to see or hear each other once within the cells.
“Yes, what is it?” he asked irritably, sitting up and turning to face the door. When he saw Harry, his expression hardened. “Ah, Potter. It’s been a while.”
. He supposed that was why thestrals were usually used in these sorts of moments, and wondered why they weren’t using thestrals today. Then he realized it was very likely that far, far more wizards could see thestrals now, after Voldemort’s rise to power and hard-won fall, and stopped thinking altogether.
“Torey Edwards, at your service,” Torey/Hermione said, inclining his head. “I work in Accounting and am always leaving little bits of mustache hair on my desk.”
“Dolohov! Vestin! You down there?” came a sudden voice from the top of the stairs. All three men glanced up.
Harry pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and threw it over both of them. Reporters could be anywhere, and it wouldn’t do for them to be seen fighting.
“I just spoke to Miles,” he said shortly, and was distantly gratified to see the smiles slide off their faces. Malfoy drew back, looking suddenly pale and withdrawn. “He’s angry. I don’t think he’ll let her go without a fight.”
The slender witch standing on the other side of the door stepped back, raising her eyebrows at his sudden appearance.
, Draco berated himself as Potter made a visible effort to calm himself. Stupid mistakes like those could put him back in Azkaban.
“Ah! So you admit that you took Viola from her biological fathers home without his consent?” interjected Harry.
Nothing happened. He was the last one standing before a class of hard, expectant faces, and the boggart was turning toward him. Draco raised his wand, his hand shaking. Voldemort would appear at any moment.
Ritchie glared at him for a moment. “You can’t prove anything,” he snarled suddenly. “It’s his word against mine –”
“Elena—" Malfoy began, his face a cold, pained mask, but Elena gave him a look and he closed his mouth and sat down at the table without another word.
“Well, if either of them shows up in white and gets their feelings hurt, they’ll have only themselves to blame,” she retorted. “I look amazing.”
Harry took a deep breath. Yes, this was good. They would figure things out with Kingsley, and then he would talk to Draco once they were alone.
They came at last to a sturdy wooden door set into the wall, which had turned from wood paneling to stone at some point. Harry watched as the woman carefully unlocked the door using the key around her neck. As she opened the door and entered, he slipped in after her.
Draco tried to speak, to say something, anything, but found that he could not. Eyes widening in panic, he tried to get up, but he could not do that, either. Lucius watched him realize that he had been immobilized with a sad glint in his eyes.
He steered both of them toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions before the portly reporter could protest. He didn’t remove his hand from Draco’s back until the door had closed behind them. Only then, in the shadowy entrance to the shop, did he take a deep breath and step away.
Then, very slowly, he sank down until he was kneeling on the wooden floor. He still hadn’t looked at Harry.
Harry was so surprised that he stepped quickly back and coughed. Ron did better: he laughed, loud and delighted, and put out a hand.
Harry nearly did throw the memories against a wall on his way out. He also considered just going home and watching them when next he had the chance — probably in a few months, he thought savagely. If then.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, a note of desperation creeping into his own voice. “I mean, I’m happy to pay for things for you, of course, but don’t you have your own money?”
He pulled back and Draco felt the lack, the chill where their bodies were no longer connected. He desperately wanted to be embraced again, but stood up straight, eyes fixed on his father’s face.
“I don’t know…” Harry read the letter over again. Written in the Minister’s precise cursive, it was maddeningly brief.
Then Warden’s hand struck him across the face. “You will not laugh in Minister Shacklebolt’s face, prisoner,” she spat. “One more display like that and I’ll throw you back in your cell to rot and find someone more suitable to marry Mr. Potter.”
Several reporters were circulating among the guests, quills floating along beside them scribbling notes on pieces of parchment. Draco suddenly realized that he recognized one of them: the round man in sleek green robes who had come up to them in Diagon Alley the evening they had gone to get Draco’s school books. Harold…something?
“Harry, wait,” Hermione said, putting out a hand to stop him. “We have no idea where this leads, we’re not prepared to actually do anything. This was just a scouting mission, and now we have new information. We need to get back to the others and come up with a plan.”
and red numbers appeared in the air before him. They flickered erratically, but he could just make them out if he concentrated: 8:45. It was time.
“I said: are trainers ok to wear?” Potter was dressed in blue jeans and a dark red T-shirt that made his dark skin look like it was glowing. Draco swallowed.
“I’ll be lucky to have them,” Neville said, smiling back. He seemed to be glowing, even though it was nearly pitch dark now. “Teaching is – well, it’s the best, Harry, but you already know that, don’t you?”
Then Draco realized that he had been staring into space, thinking about Harry Potter’s smile for an altogether inappropriate amount of time, and shut his mind down immediately. This was clearly his brain trying to focus on anything other than the fact that he was about to go back to Hogwarts. Desperate times, he supposed, called for desperate measures.
Lucius chuckled again. “I see my son has not had time to fill you in much at all,” he replied, furrowing his brow in mocking displeasure. “I
“Thank you for that, Minister,” he said politely. “I do appreciate your apology, but I have to say: I would appreciate a full pardon from my sentence even more.”
It wasn’t even that much of a stretch, he consoled himself, examining his own face in the mirror. The makeup spell from earlier seemed to be holding – he couldn’t see the dark circles beneath his eyes, and his hollowed cheekbones still held a magically-induced healthy pink glow. Had he really only left Azkaban that morning? It felt like years had passed. He was so tired. He found himself wondering how much longer the dinner would stretch, then reminded himself that this was his life now: constantly being watched, judged, scorned. In Azkaban, at least there had been a modicum of anonymity, a pretense of impartial treatment. Now, even that was gone.
Pansy snorted and threw her handful of Floo powder into the flames. She stepped into the fireplace and was gone.
Harry had pulled out a few pieces of parchment from work – he had left earlier than usual, after all, and it wasn’t like he didn’t sometimes bring work home. With Draco sleeping in his office (and he really needed to fix that, Harry thought for the thousandth time, the man needed his own room), he had taken to working in bed, propped up against several pillows with lumos spells hovering around his head. No problem.
For a moment, Draco wondered if he had imagined that. Had McGonagall really just invited him back to the castle he had nearly ruined? To the place where he had killed a headmaster? Where he had let the Death Eaters in? Then he wondered if she was toying with him. The grey eyes fixed on his face, however, were serious.
At some point – it must have been very late – Kingsley had come back and they had Apparated somewhere else. Draco kept counting. He didn’t try to ask Kingsley if Harry was alright. If he was, and he hadn’t come for Draco, it meant something very precious and very fragile had been broken beyond repair, and Draco couldn’t deal with that at the moment. And if Harry wasn’t alright...
“You recognized me,” Harry answered firmly. He remembered that moment so well: the fear, the pain on his face, Ron and Hermione tied tightly next to him, Draco leaning down to stare into his eyes. He remembered Draco’s shoulders tightening, had felt sure that death was coming for him at last. Then Draco had shaken his head.
“I’m going to give you two choices,” Harry said softly. The other Auror’s eyes widened, flicking back and forth between Harry’s face, the scar on his forehead, and the wand held before him. “You can come with me to Robards’s office quietly, on your own two feet, to explain what the hell you were doing to a Ministry prisoner and collect your belongings, or I can Stun you where you stand and Levitate you upstairs myself and you won’t be able to explain anything to anyone before you’re out of your job and likely back down here, except inside a cell this time.” He took a breath. “Do I make myself clear?”
The Ministry owl flew after him as he made his way down the hall, leaving Draco motionless in the kitchen. Harry was still so distracted by what Draco had said about his mother’s death that he barely registered what he was writing.
“Need any help calming your pet, Harry Potter?” drawled another one, a tall boy who looked like he was in fifth or sixth year. “Teaching him a lesson he won’t forget?”
“Excuse me!” An annoyed voice behind him yanked Draco from his memories and he stumbled forward, out of the doorway and into the classroom. He was trembling, he realized, and his heart was beating violently. Gluing his eyes to the floor, he walked quickly to a desk at the back, praying that his eyes were playing tricks on him, that the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was not –
When Harry stepped through the brick wall into Diagon Alley a few moments later, it took him several long moments to find Draco. He finally spotted the other man hunched against a pillar in the shadow of a lodging house a few meters away. Draco’s eyes lit up with something that looked suspiciously like relief when he saw Harry, and they started toward each other. In that moment, Harry realized that this would be the first real public appearance for the two of them since their wedding.
Draco pulled away. Harry made a small, complaining sound in the back of his throat and opened his eyes to find Draco watching him. He looked astonished.
“Thank you,” he whispered, and then laughed to himself. Who was he thanking? The sofa he and Pansy had bought when they moved in? The bookcase he had built himself, without using any magic, during his short-lived but passionate “live like a Muggle” phase? The TV Harry had given him as a birthday present, beginning the tradition of Friday movie nights that just kept growing?
“I understand,” he replied slowly. “And if we agree to this, you and Viola will come with us quietly now, and you’ll tell Elena something that doesn’t get the Muggle police set on us.” It wasn’t a question, but Malfoy nodded.
Harry felt as if someone had thrown a bucket of icy water over his head. He had been expecting this – had been trying to prepare himself for it – but nothing could have prepared him for having Draco alive and whole before him telling him that their marriage wouldn’t work. He swallowed hard himself.
“I’d say that warrants investigating,” Harry grinned. “Luna, Neville: you’re both incredible. Now, does anyone feel like a sandwich?”
“Welcome, students,” the professor said brightly. Draco glanced up. She had fixed the newcomers with a steely stare that belied her warm smile. “Please, everyone. Take a seat.”
“Keeping track?” Harry felt like he had stepped into a conversation that had already been going on for several minutes without him. “Can’t you just pay her?”
“It’s been activated,” Harry said with grim joy. “The bastard finally broke down and used magic. Let’s get him.”
“Of course he is, this is his house,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. Harry grinned at him – he couldn’t help it. He had missed Draco so much.
Now, Harry stopped outside Malfoy’s cell to again see Malfoy curled on the cot, facing the wall. This time, when Malfoy didn’t react right away, Harry cleared his throat.
“I’ve never been one to bow to the inevitable,” he said instead. “Especially when someone is being so
He took a breath, suddenly desperate to change the subject. “Draco,” he said, and the blond man looked up at him, eyebrows raised. Harry suddenly felt self-conscious. “What?” he asked.
“I don’t know what happened, Malfoy,” he said as the other man stiffened against him. “But I don’t think you should apologize for saving my life.”
Ron agreed, bemused, and he and Hermione walked back to the end of the hallway, where Harry could see them conferring in hushed tones. He turned back to the cell, feeling a bit left out, only to find himself on the receiving end of an uncomfortably astute stare by Malfoy.
He had graduated. He had moved into Grimmauld Place and started fixing it up. He and Ron had enrolled in Auror training, just like they’d planned to for years, and Hermione had enrolled in post-graduate courses in magical policy. He visited Teddy frequently and got to know Andromeda as a sharp, sarcastic, and incredibly loving person whom Teddy adored and who made the best banana bread Harry had ever had. And in all that time, he hadn’t thought about Draco Malfoy once.
“That’s wonderful! I wondered if she would ask you. I went back for another year after the war, and so did Ron, Hermione – a lot of us.” Potter stopped quickly, clearly realizing that the year he was talking about had been Draco’s first year in Azkaban. But Draco nodded quickly, moving them both past it.
,” he hissed, and grabbed Hermione/Torey’s hand, pulling her around the corner of the house. As soon as they were on the other side of the wall, the heavy, cold despair lifted. Hermione gasped and sagged against the Manor.
“Draco, this is bullshit,” Harry said, his voice getting slightly louder. “Everyone’s still treating you like you’re a criminal, but you’re not. You’ve been released, you’re my husband, for gods’ sakes –”
Draco wished that he could close his eyes against the disappointed disgust in his father’s gaze, but he could not. All he could do was watch as Lucius summoned the slender wizard again, who Levitated Draco – still immobilized – back out into the hall. Through another hall, down a winding set of stairs, coming at last to a metal door set into the stone, which the wizard opened, then flung Draco inside. The spell holding him still broke as he crashed to the stone floor, and he curled into a ball, squeezing his eyes shut as, behind him, the heavy door closed with a final, resounding
Harry left the office that evening feeling curiously untethered. Eva Waverly, the Head Auror, had accepted his leave of absence with good humor – Harry realized she was probably relieved that he was leaving of his own accord for a while. It was an un-specified amount of time, which felt surreal. As he Apparated home, he felt light and a little giddy. It must have shown on his face. Draco glanced up absently from several scrolls spread on the kitchen table, then looked again, a question in his eyes.
He signed a few papers in the dim front office and Warden handed him a wand. It wasn’t his wand, of course—that had been lost after the Battle of Hogwarts—but at least it was something, even if it did include a special tracking spell that would let the Ministry see every spell he cast until they decided he had earned back society’s trust (Warden’s words). Then he was walking out of the massive iron gates between the two Ministry employees: a free man.
He was looking at a white wall. A single window looked back at him. It was dark out. The light was coming from several lit lamps on either side of the window.
And then it was over. With a jolt, Harry found himself standing once more before the Pensieve, the dark Auror offices quiet around him. He realized he was breathing hard, fists clenched, and there were tears running down his face. He hadn’t even realized he’d been crying.
Miles Hathaway: British expat, Squib, and the father of a missing six-year-old girl. A six-year-old girl who had apparently been kidnapped by none other than Draco Malfoy.
He did not have to wonder long. Just as he opened the large refrigeration cabinet to see what there was for breakfast, he heard the bedroom door swing open. Harry took a deep breath, grabbed an opened bottle of pumpkin juice, and made sure he was smiling as he turned around. “Good morning,” he said brightly, waving the bottle vaguely in Malfoy’s directly as he reached for two cups. “Sleep alright?”
“Twat,” Harry said quietly. Malfoy didn’t react. “Bye, then,” he said lamely, and headed back to his desk.
“Soy Elena,” the woman informed them, ushering them towards a faded purple sofa. “Draco volverá muy pronto. Queréis algo de beber? Comer?”
Another blast of ice water hit him, and Draco gasped, tugging uselessly at the chains binding his wrists to two huge iron posts set into the basement floor. Lucius had installed these shortly after he had imprisoned Draco: an option for his torturers if they wanted easier access to his body, or wanted, as this one seemed to, to torment him with icy water without electrocuting him fatally. They wanted him alive, it seemed, although Draco wished they would change their minds.
“Hello, Draco,” Luna hummed happily, waving one hand around her head. “I was just telling Harry, there are exceptional tiddlywamps here this evening. They signify good luck, you know.”
Draco sighed and put down his chopsticks. “Listen, Potter,” he said, smirking when Harry’s head shot up at the use of his last name. “We need to talk about...about our –” He motioned at the air between them. “...Whatever this is.”
“Well, that all depends on how well Headmistress McGonagall thinks I do, but yes, I hope to be here for a long time to come,” Shaver answered. Draco swallowed hard.
Draco swallowed quickly and looked away, trying to catch up with the conversation. When had Potter’s face become so distracting?
“Here’s to Hufflepuff horses,” he said, and waved his wand with a whispered word. Lady’s harness and saddle materialized on her head and back, and he opened the stall door to let her out. He did the same for Potter’s horse (“Lancelot” read the cursive nameplate), and they led both horses out into the fresh air.
“Delightful.” She popped a miniature quiche in her mouth and winked at Draco. “I do so appreciate a good spread – and the tiddlywamps couldn’t be happier.”
Draco had looked back around at him, and was staring at him in disbelief. Harry stepped closer and Draco flinched, nearly imperceptibly.
Lucius was sitting behind a massive wooden desk, looking down his long nose at Torey Edwards, who was chained to a chair before the desk. Dementors ringed them on all sides, their shifting, shadowy forms seeming to rustle menacingly.
Hagrid seemed like he was about to retort, but then he peered at Malfoy’s face. His expression softened suddenly. “Well, of course ye are,” he said quietly. “Ye’ve grown, Malfoy.”
Draco’s eyes snapped up, his whole face lighting up. “That’s true…I mean, I don’t want to cause any trouble, but I realized that all my school things were in the Manor when…”
Draco – or, Oliver, as Miles had apparently known him – had continually threatened to leave, but Miles hadn’t thought he ever would, until one day he had woken up to a completely empty house. No Draco. No Viola.
He trailed off suggestively and Draco closed his eyes, turning his face away. The man grabbed his jaw and pulled his head back so they were eye to eye. “Look at me when I’m talking to you, you little –”
Malfoy was quiet for so long that Harry started to wonder if the other man had fallen asleep or something. He held himself still, though, hoping that if he left enough space, Malfoy would give him something.
He could just see the castle, a dark smudge on the horizon. This was as close as you could Apparate. McGonagall had said Hagrid would be waiting for him with a thestral to take him the rest of the way. But as he looked around, it appeared that he was alone in the dewy morning. His stomach clenched automatically.
He had returned to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione for their eighth year, which was equal parts studying for their NEWTS, rebuilding the portions of Hogwarts that were still damaged from the Battle, and trying to remember how to be a normal teenager. He and Ginny had broken up soon after returning to school. It had stung a bit, but Harry gave Ginny credit for knowing both of them well enough to know that they had outgrown each other. He moped for several months before ending up in a deserted hallway with Michael Corner after a particularly raucous eighth-year party. The next morning, after some of the most fulfilling sex of his life, Harry had felt nothing but relieved. There was so much more for both him and Ginny to see and learn. They had renewed their friendship over the next few months, and she was still one of his closest friends.
Harry shoved Malfoy in with a little more force than was strictly necessary, and the barred cell door banged shut with a satisfying crash.
Elias wrinkled his brow and glanced at Draco. “Do you have any idea why he wants her back so badly? From what you’ve told me, he resented her presence in his life.”
, Harry thought, nodding back. He wondered what Malfoy had done to the Muggles who had been living here. Grimly, he put his hand in his pocket and gripped his wand tightly.
It shouldn’t have been such an unexpected question, but Harry felt a little taken aback. “No,” he answered truthfully, almost before he could think. “It feels different – like I’m getting to know a different person for the first time, except I kind of already know them. It feels – really comfortable, actually.” He paused, scooping his own bite of guacamole onto a chip. “I mean, not that he’ll really open up to me much. I think he probably still resents everything I did to him, which is fair.”
“I must be dead,” Draco said. He wouldn’t look Harry in the eye. “Maybe this is my brain firing a few last synapses before it all goes dark. Well, it’s a very nice last thing to have. Nicer than I deserve, I think.”
Levering himself out of bed, Harry grabbed his glasses from the small table he had conjured to sit near his newly-conjured bed and shoved them onto his nose. He shuffled down the hall, his socks sliding along the familiar boards until he reached the kitchen. As he passed it, he noticed the bedroom door was still closed. He wondered how late Malfoy usually slept.
“Oh, but I will,” said Miles silkily, and slapped Viola hard across the face. She screamed, starting to cry and shake.
Harry sighed. “I didn’t like her, much, in school,” he said. “But I like that she makes you happy, when she shows up.” He took a bite of curry and ignored Draco’s snort. “She did try to turn me over to Voldemort before the Battle, but water under the bridge and all that.”
He stepped out into a very different living room than the one he had left. Draco’s scrolls were still spread across the kitchen table, but Draco himself was seated on the edge of the couch, his eyes cast down and his hands folded in his lap. His back was ramrod straight, and Harry noticed he was worrying his lower lip with his teeth.
A smaller note fluttered onto the bedspread, and Draco picked it up, confused. It was a personalized note from the headmistress herself.
He’d thought he was getting into some kind of rhythm – getting numb to it all, perhaps, or at least progressively deeper into his wine – when he saw long blond hair floating towards their table. The last time he had seen that hair, it had been flying behind Luna Lovegood as she battled Death Eaters in the halls of their school.
He walked toward it slowly, not wanting to see the parchment coiled around the handle. But there it was, his name written in large letters on the outside. He unwrapped it carefully, as if he was handling something very fragile.
“Someone else – already came,” Draco gasped out. His voice was scratchy. It sounded painful, and he grimaced as he spoke. “Really – don’t trouble yourselves –”
He drew back again and pointed his wand at the manacles around Draco’s wrists. They fell away with hollow clanks. Draco looked at him then, really looked at him, and his eyes flew wide.
“Oh, alright,” he said finally, and Harry signed in exaggerated relief. “But you can’t ever wink at me like that in public again.”
He walked until he didn’t recognize where he was anymore, until he was so far outside Hogsmeade that he couldn’t even see lights in the distance. It was starting to get dark, one of those early, rainy evenings that seep into your bones. He kept thinking that he should go check on Draco – should go find Draco – but every time he thought of the other man, the student’s soft voice rang in his ears.
“Mr. Potter is eager to assist in this reconciliation project,” Kingsley replied promptly, perhaps grateful to be back on scripted ground. “I imagine he also fondly remembers your school days together and knows that the two of you, once reunited, can forge a partnership that reflects the very best of the wizarding world.”
Harry remembered how Ron and Hermione had disappeared for long months after finishing Hogwarts. She had wanted to go to Australia to find her parents, and Ron had gone with her because, as he said, he couldn’t imagine making her do that alone. They had never told Harry what happened on that trip, but they had come back sun-tanned and beaming, hand-in-hand and ready for the next chapter of their lives.
Draco felt the weight of both their gazes on his bowed head. He said nothing. After a moment, Kingsley clasped his hands. “May I take your silence as acceptance?”
He kept himself from cringing back with an effort, shocked at his nerve, but Potter only laughed in response and approached the horse, one hand outstretched. “And I hope yours isn’t as mean as most Slytherins I’ve met,” he threw back over his shoulder. Draco realized with a start that he was laughing, not even minding the jibe.
“No, Ron, I have not forgotten,” Harry bit out, acutely aware of how the waitress’s eyes widened comically, how she hesitated before finally coming all the way over to their table and setting down the bowl. Harry nodded at her with a smile that he hoped was both grateful and apologetic. “But the war is
Harry expected Malfoy to lash out, but instead the other man snorted a laugh and looked at Hermione appraisingly, a half smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “The brightest witch of our age, ladies and gentlemen,” he said grandly. Then he leaned forward, his face sharpening.
“Yes,” he said shortly, and rose to his feet. Draco stood too, his eyes suddenly going wide and fearful.
“Warden told me,” Draco said slowly, searching Harry’s face. “Before I left, she told me that she would be watching me. Kingsley too.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “They told me that I had to make you happy or else you would send me back to Azkaban. They’ve been keeping tabs on me, I know they have, the two of them and Shaver, and you’ve been corresponding with them.” His eyes flew open again, panicked. “Was I not supposed to know? I won’t say anything about it again, of course it’s your choice.” He shook his head sharply. “I know I haven’t made you happy, I know I can’t make you happy, but please, Harry, I’ll do anything you want if you –”
“Great,” Harry said with a grin. “I can’t wait to hear how Hogwarts is doing.” He started toward the hallway, planning on changing out of his work clothes before Apparating to Ron and Hermione’s flat, but a sudden curiosity made him turn. “Who do they have teaching Defense?”
Harry barked a laugh. “Where on earth did you get that idea, Malfoy? That I’m only interested in shagging you?”
But Narcissa had died in childbirth, and Miles had been left with a newborn child and Draco, who had apparently become more and more difficult to live with after his mother died. “He would go into his room for days at a time and we wouldn’t see him at all,” Miles recounted. “Then, suddenly, he would burst out, shouting that I was ruining his life, and try to steal my car keys or something. Viola hated him, always crying when he was around, trying to get away. Of course, he hated her too – seemed like he felt she had killed his mother. And that was even before his drinking problem began to really show itself.”
Harry shook his head. “We were so young,” he said, wondering if it would sound like a non-sequitur, but Neville made a sound of agreement.
Ron shook his head vehemently, then looked thoughtful. “I bet Hermione wouldn’t mind having a guest for a night,” he said. “She can share Rosie’s room.”
“Well, that’s comforting,” Draco said after a moment. He chuckled. “I was wondering if my sanity was going, and now I have a definitive answer. Yes, it is.” He nodded, closed his eyes. Laughed again. “It’s a little sad, isn’t it, that I’m hallucinating you, of all people. Although I suppose it makes sense.” He shook his head. “You’ve always been there at my worst moments. Why would this be an exception?”
,” he said for the sixth time, and cursed when, instead of the expected jet of hot air to dry his hair, the wand emitted a high-pitched whine and a burst of cold wind. Harry laughed harder.
, he corrected himself hurriedly. He laughed a lot, actually, in these conversations with Malfoy. They were, in many ways, the best part of his day.
For a long moment, nothing seemed to happen. Then Lucius whirled back to the crowd of wizards, his eyes going wide and panicked as he raised his wand, and the hands of the Imperiused wizards holding Harry down suddenly loosened.
“I’m afraid I have some...disappointing news, Harry,” he said slowly. “It seems that Mr. Malfoy has not been entirely honest with you. With any of us.” Draco made a small sound as if he wanted to protest, but cut himself off. Kingsley seemed not to have heard him. “These are letters from Mr. Malfoy senior. Your partner apparently received them and hid them from you. I can only assume he’s been corresponding with his father for months, perhaps since he left Azkaban himself.
All of these little details that reminded Harry, over and over again, that Draco was gone. That he, Harry, had betrayed the fragile trust they had built, and had let Draco be taken from him, and now could not find him, no matter what he and his friends tried.
Harry shook himself. He hadn’t spoken to his uncle in nearly a decade. His voice shouldn’t be so very clear in Harry’s head.
“How. Dare. You,” she bit out. “You would make demands on your future husband, the hero of our time, before the wedding vows are even exchanged? Is this really how you want to begin your life together? With unreasonable requests, tension already forming, thanks to you?”
An elegant, mottled brown owl was standing on their windowsill, a small scroll clasped in its beak. Confused, Harry crossed the living room to let it in. With a small hoot, the owl stepped lightly into the room and deposited the scroll on his hand. When she didn’t fly away, Harry realized whoever had sent this must be expecting a response.
Malfoy accepted it without hesitation this time and drank it down. “Got anything else in there?” he asked, eyeing Harry’s lunch bag. Harry laughed and tossed him an apple through the bars, which Malfoy set about demolishing.
“I haven’t yet had the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Malfoy-Potter,” she said, clasping his hand in both of hers. “It is a joyful time indeed.”
Harry nodded back, and Ron and Viola walked away, making their way to the exit from which they could apparate. Viola looked back once and Malfoy blew her a kiss. Harry felt a lump form in his throat.
,” Harry finally said, looking back down. “‘Sources confirm—’” He looked up helplessly. “What sources?!”
“We’ll go to the reception directly,” he said, partly for Malfoy’s benefit and partly for his own. “You don’t need to take care of us. See to her. Please,” he added, when the Aurors appeared hesitant.
Draco pushed down a sudden wave of nausea and tried to school his features. He did not want his father to think him weak.
“I see a Death Eater menacing the Chosen One,” said the first student, nearly spitting with rage, at the same time as the second one said: “We’re Gryffindors. Of
“I hope Luna can get her to laugh a bit,” Ron said, concern lacing his voice. “At least Rosie’s being nice.”
, please,” she said crisply, shifting so that he could see her without moving his head. “I’m going to ask you a few questions about where the pain is coming from. Do you understand me?”
“Well, you taught us all those spells fifth year, didn’t you?” Neville said brightly. “Dumbledore’s Army!” He laughed. “I learned more from you than I did from any other Defense professor, hands down.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and Harry could practically see his clenched fists through the table. “What…how…what can I do? Can I do anything?” he asked, a little desperately.
“Nope,” Harry said happily. “It’s Sunday, and Kingsley gave me a few days off so we could get settled in anyway. Anything else we have to do, we can do tomorrow.”
“Stop grinning like an idiot and listen to me,” Draco said, although a smile was tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Lucius has figured out a way to draw power from dementors.”
But he also knew, with a certainty that reached into the very core of him, that he would die before he told his father, or his father’s followers,
They drove the pickup truck down winding country lanes, and Harry was reluctantly impressed by Malfoy’s easy handling of the car. His long legs shifted as he tapped the clutch or break, and he kept a pale hand resting on the manual gear shift, occasionally changing gears with a fluid grace. Harry caught himself staring and looked away quickly. Malfoy didn’t look at or speak to him the entire time.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and fixed his eyes on Draco’s grainy black-and-white image, walking behind Kingsley with his head held high, jaw clenched.
In the next moment, Malfoy seemed to realize what he had said and his head snapped up, wide, anguished gray eyes meeting Harry’s.
Harry found himself torn between wanting to yell at Kingsley again for making Draco so uncomfortable, and having a long conversation with Draco about whether or not he was doing ok (because not speaking to anyone besides himself and Draco’s professors – that was no way to live! What was going on?). Before he could do either, Kingsley spoke again.
She was. As soon as Draco stepped through the door, Viola launched herself into his arms and would not let go. They spoke together quietly in rapid Spanglish as Harry helped Hermione set the table. He kept looking over at them with a warm, blossoming feeling in his chest. Draco looked back at him at one point and then quickly away again, blushing.
. Of course. Harry breathed out in relief. If Hermione was here, everything would be ok. He tried to look in her direction and nod his affirmation, but gasped again when pain scorched his skull. Hermione made a small noise of protest.
“Because if I follow your lead, nothing’s ever going to change!” Harry burst out. The students in the corner were staring, but he didn’t care. “I married you so that things would get better, so that we could all move forward, but if you’re still stuck in the past, then what’s the damn point?” He knew he should stop himself, but he couldn’t. “Do you even care about what I’m trying to do here? Can you think about anyone besides yourself and your damned guilt, or whatever this is?”
With a sigh that sounded far more put-upon than his half-smile indicated, Draco carefully rolled up the scroll and set his quill down. “Lead the way, Potter,” he drawled, standing and striding out from behind the desk. Still grinning, Harry grasped the other man’s arm just above the elbow and turned on the spot. The sharp
Harry had many more questions – how long had Draco been living here? What was he doing here, in this Spanish farmhouse in the middle of nowhere? Had Elena ever seen a child named Viola? – but he had decidedly exhausted his limited supply of Spanish. Ron, too, seemed more intent on eating biscuits than in conversing further. They sat in companionable silence for several minutes, Elena bustling around the room tidying up and periodically popping into the kitchen to check whatever was cooking. She set a copy of that day’s newspaper on the arm of the sofa by Harry’s hand, indicating with hand gestures and smiles that he could read it if he wanted to. Obligingly, he picked it up and scanned the incomprehensible Spanish, to Ron’s great amusement.
“And what do you want me to do about that?” Malfoy snapped suddenly, his eyes blazing. “Keep entertaining you on your lunch breaks for another month before I’m thrown in Azkaban for kidnapping?”
“Well, when you almost single-handedly free three-quarters of the Ministry of Magic from the thrall of a crazed, murderous criminal, I think that counts for something,” Kingsley replied, still smiling. “Not to belittle your own efforts, Mr. Potter, or those of Ms. Granger,” he said, inclining his head to Harry, who shook his head with a laugh.
“Someone better tell me what the hell is going on here, and quick,” Kingsley said ominously, looking around. His gaze fell on Draco and his eyes widened. “Draco Malfoy!” he exclaimed. “What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in Azkaban!”
“No, not at all. Yeah, it was my choice,” Harry responded, grinning. “I guess I just realized how much I needed a rest. I’ll probably go back eventually, but…” he trailed off, then shrugged. “Going to take it one day at a time.”
“I just assumed,” Draco said flatly, starting to turn away. “And thanks all the same, Potter, I’m very flattered, but I’m really more the relationship type, so –”
“What?” Ron asked, taking the paper from him. He read it, and Harry watched the other man’s eyes widen. “Malfoy’s Trace?”
“I have this time,” Harry said. He dropped his head back into his hands. “Don’t know what I was thinking with this whole wedding thing.”
He growled at her and ushered her toward the fireplace. “No more tricks,” he said. He couldn’t stop smiling. “You have to be a witness tonight, and it won’t work if you’re dead.”
“I wrote to Kingsley and asked if I could visit Draco to bring him some of my billywog cookies, but he said no,” chimed in Luna. Ginny absently ran her hand over her girlfriend’s back.
Confused images filled his mind. Arriving at the horse barn, seeing the old man greet Malfoy like a long-lost son, and reveling a bit at the feeling of being in the background. Watching Malfoy gallop away – absurdly graceful, it was unfair, really – and lifting his hand to wave as Malfoy wheeled his mount and started thundering back across the grass. He remembered thinking, in that moment, that Malfoy’s smile seemed to light up the gray, cloudy world. He remembered laughing at himself. He remembered grinning.
Ron looked thoughtful. “I haven’t heard of anyone, but I’ll ask around,” he said, nodding. Harry gave him a wan smile and turned back to Hermione.
Looking back on that night, Harry could not quite remember how everything had gone. He could remember the broad strokes, of course, but small details were fuzzy, or gone completely.
He did. “Eat good food,” Malfoy said quietly. “See the sun low in the sky. We were only allowed outside at noon,” he added quickly, seeing Harry’s questioning look. “It’s been four years since I’ve seen a sunrise or a sunset. Ride horses, listen to music—”
“You should definitely do that,” Draco responded, feeling his voice scrape low where the laughter had stunned him. “Get someone else. Anyone else. Because if you think, for one moment, that Potter will agree to…to marry me…”
Draco whipped around, but there was no one behind him: only a bookshelf with Muggle books that Harry sometimes leafed through, and a window partly open to catch the late autumn breeze.
Harry caught up to Draco outside the Ministry. The blond man seemed dazed, and he startled slightly when Harry came up to him. Without thinking too much about it, Harry wrapped him in a hug.
The scene changed. Malfoy walked into the apartment, his face and clothes covered in dust. He looked exhausted, with dark circles under his eyes. Viola, even smaller now, toddled up to him and wrapped her tiny arms around his calves. Malfoy dropped to his knees, smiling at her tiredly.
,” Hermione’s voice echoed in his head as he climbed down from the carriage and began to walk the few steps toward the open doorway. A tall, beaming woman with dark skin and bright beads woven into her locs, appeared from within and held out her hands in a ritual gesture of welcome. Harry nodded to her politely and placed his own hands in hers, trying to ignore the roar of the crowd. She smiled at him and squeezed his hands ever so slightly before drawing him inside. There was no door in the opening to block out sound, but as soon as he crossed the threshold all noise from outside fell away –
Harry sighed as well. “Yeah, ok.” He shook his head mutinously. “This isn’t going to become a regular thing – but we’ll host a party. And invite reporters.” He reached down and clasped Draco’s hand. It was cool and dry in his own. He smiled grimly. “And we’ll show them just how happy we can be.”
She gave him a long-suffering look. “I didn’t hear anything, Harry. I saw something. Just as I was finishing my delicious sandwich – avocado and hummus, just lovely – I saw Colin Fairchild walk by. You know – Kingsley’s assistant?”
“Is that what that fucker said?” he snapped. “The fucking little cunt, he’s always had it out for me, even though I saved him and his mother, even though Viola’s
“Here you go: American pancakes!” he said with a flourish, helping himself to the top two. Malfoy took two as well, mimicking Harry’s movements exactly as he put first butter, then syrup on his plate. They each took a bite at the same time.
“I’m certain you’re doing all you can, Minister,” Warden said quickly, and Draco felt amusement stirring before he quashed it. These were powerful people—laughing at Warden’s brown-nosing would not win him any favors.
Harry suddenly realized he had never seen Malfoy in anything other than school or dress robes. Seeing him in normal clothes was…odd. It was like seeing an actor who you had only ever seen in one role suddenly in costume as someone else.
The other Auror reached through the bars and grabbed the front of Malfoy’s robes, lifted him bodily until he was pressed against the bars.
Draco screamed as he continued to write in the Cruciatus Curse, but he didn’t say anything. The man’s face twisted in displeasure.
Harry would recognize Malfoy Manor’s dungeons anywhere, but even during the height of Voldemort’s reign, they had never been this full, or this disgusting. Every single cell was occupied, some by three or four people. Some watched the woman pass, wearing expressions that ranged from wariness, to fear, to open hostility. Some didn’t look up at all, but stayed curled in corners or against the far wall. The silvery foal trotted up and down, up and down. Harry saw dementors pulling away from the patronus’s light, then re-congealing after they’d passed.
Draco couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Before he could muster any kind of action, Kingsley looked around and met his eyes. The Minister’s dark eyes were strangely vacant, but when he saw Draco he stood quickly.
Draco flinched back, unthinking. He hardly realized what he had done until he saw Lucius’s eyes widen imperceptibly. The other man drew his hand back with a thin smile.
Malfoy stepped forward tentatively until he could grab the sandwich from Harry’s hand. He inspected it carefully, turning it over in his hands before unwrapping it, then peering between the slices of bread.
Now he was kind of wishing he had taken Ron up on the offer, but it was Ron’s day off. He didn’t have any more excuses.
They had both looked to him when Hermione mentioned a sponsor, but Harry had shaken his head vehemently.
Harry shut his eyes with a groan, trying to block out the light that seemed to be sending tiny daggers into his skull. He hadn’t been conscious of drinking that much last night, but the hangover was definitely present.
And he had learned after their wedding dinner that Harry’s distaste of Draco’s physical presence would end any attempts at real intimacy before they even began.
This second kiss was like flower petals unfurling, like wide open fields, like sunlight on deep water. Like a journey just beginning. Like home.
“I am devasted,” he said quietly. Draco’s hands were shaking. “Devastated that my own son has proven so deplorably weak so as to fall in love,” his mouth twisted on the word as if it tasted foul. “Fall in love with the enemy of our house. Of our movement.” Slowly, Lucius picked up his wine glass again and drained it dry. “I suppose I have the answer to my question,” he said quietly.
“You may be of some use to me, yet,” he said musingly. “I don’t think I will kill you today, but make no mistake, Draco.” Here, he stood again, glowering down at Draco seated on the other side of the desk. “You are no son of mine.”
Draco dropped his eyes when Potter circled the carriage. They would walk in together, of course. Potter extended a hand and Draco took it lightly. As they walked toward the hall’s double door, Potter murmured: “Alright, Malfoy?” and squeezed his hand. Draco nodded quickly. He would not embarrass them during the reception. He could not. That hard squeeze was only a preview of what would happen if he did.
Draco couldn’t remember how to breathe. He stood there for a long moment, trying to bring several different realities together in his head.
Harry groaned and sank onto the sofa. “This is bad, right?” he said quietly. “I don’t – I don’t know what to do. I mean, we could publish a rebuttal, but they’re – they’re not entirely wrong about some of it…”
“Excellent, excellent,” Kingsley boomed. Warden gave a positively un-Warden-like giggle. “The ceremony is tomorrow—I will arrange for someone to arrive here early to prepare you.”
Harry awoke with a start as unfamiliar sunlight hit his face. He looked around frantically, still partly lost at the edges of a dream of running, screaming, fighting, killing, and automatically reached beneath his pillow for his wand.
Malfoy’s face flushed and he looked down, gripping the counter behind him until his knuckles turned white.
, he realized one day, sitting at the table in their flat about a week after the party. Currently, he was idly flipping through a quidditch magazine while Draco poured over a scroll at the desk set over near the windows. Every so often, he would scribble something down on a piece of parchment near his left hand and then go back to reading.
Looking back, Draco wondered if he hadn’t really understood the Minister fully yet. Perhaps that accounted for the ease with which he asked his next question. “Who is the other party, sir?”
He watched as Malfoy gently prompted Viola to touch the bottle. Her hand looked so tiny next to his long fingers. It was all Harry could do not to grab her and Apparate to Miles’s piso, just a few miles away in Madrid, but he had made a promise. And I’m not a Death Eater, so I keep my promises, he thought bitterly to himself as he activated the portkey and pulled them all into darkness.
She looked back at him for a long moment, then sighed and nodded. “I’m coming with you,” she said firmly. “Luna, go back and fill the others in. I don’t know where we’re going, but if we’re not back by midnight, come looking. Ok?”
No, there was a light on beneath the bedroom door. Harry knocked hesitantly, unsure of his welcome, but the door swung open immediately. Draco was standing behind it, still wearing the clothes he had been in that afternoon. His hair was wild, though, as if he had run his hands through it over and over. His eyes were fixed on the floor.
A thought struck Harry. “Ron,” he said, turning to his friend. “Have any Aurors been reassigned or fired from Azkaban recently? I imagine if Lucius was sending post on someone’s watch, they would have been reassigned at least, if not outright sacked.”
Malfoy turned his face away, staring at the opposite stone wall of the cell. “Because you’re attracted to me physically,” he said in a monotone.
That day’s check-in, as usual, had been disappointingly brief. It was maddening, Harry reflected, to know exactly what information you needed – where Draco had been taken – and to be so thoroughly stymied on every front. If Kingsley knew of any kind of timeline for Draco’s trial, he was keeping it to himself, giving the excuse of lowering the possibility of press and publicity. No other Ministry employees knew, or admitted to knowing, anything.
“A tad unoriginal, isn’t?” Lucius asked mockingly. “But then, Potter, you always were incredibly predictable. I got the idea, of course, from what the Dark Lord did with Sirius Black, and from there it was only a matter of time until you followed one of my people here. And now...” He spread his hands. “You are surrounded, and it is high time, Potter that you bowed to the inevitable and died already.”
“You know, too, that dementors force you to re-live your most shameful moments,” Lucius continued. “Your worst memories, your deepest fears all come to light. They can administer the Kiss, which pulls your soul out of your body, killing you more firmly and finally than mere death ever could.”
The only other people in the room were Lucius and Torey/Hermione. This was their chance. Harry could hear Torey’s labored, terrified breathing. Slowly, Harry raised his wand.
Elias left, chuckling, and Harry followed, feeling more irritated than ever, although he couldn’t put a finger on why.
Luna was still talking. “He was talking, although there wasn’t anyone else with him. At least not that I could see...” She trailed off for a moment, then resumed. “And then he just...vanished!”
The two women came to a stop before each other and clasped hands. Everyone sat down as Pansy and Mrs. Weasley stood up behind Ginny – and there was a friendship Draco had not seen coming, but it had blossomed, sure and quick and deep – and Xenophilius and Neville stood behind Luna, both looking handsomely disheveled and incredibly happy.
“I…I know I am not an equal member of this union. I accept that, and I am sorry I forgot how to act like it.” He took another deep breath. “I will accept any punishment you deem appropriate. If you do not send me back, I will do better. I swear, Harry –” His voice rose and he cut himself short. Curled his hands together in his lap. Waited.
Draco looked around and quickly spotted a chestnut head sticking over a stall door, seemingly drawn by all the commotion. He nodded toward the head with a grin.
“It really only started getting good recently,” Lucius mused. “Although you two have fairly boring pillow talk. Sickening, really. I began to realize that Potter really seemed to be falling for my disappointing son, though, and that gave me my best idea yet.”
With a grateful nod to Hagrid, Draco deposited the flowers and branches on the table and strode quickly down the nearest hall. He heard the doors open behind him, and glad cries of greeting which Hagrid returned. Draco sped up, then made himself slow down. He had just as much right to be here as anyone.
They decided that Hermione would stay out in the dark grounds while Harry went in under the Invisibility Cloak to get the lay of the land. “If you need me, shoot red sparks out a window,” Hermione said as she checked to make sure the cloak was covering him completely. “I’ll be circling the house, watching for it.”
Harry considered not going back to the cell, making Malfoy wait all night, but he reasoned that if he got the memories tonight then he wouldn’t have to see Malfoy again the next morning and he could get on with the business of getting Viola back to her father with no further ado. Malfoy was still standing at the barred door when he returned. He stood motionless as Harry approached him, wand outstretched. The silvery filaments came quickly from his head, as if he were pushing them out, wrapping around Harry’s wand. He twined them gently into the vial and stoppered the cork.
The Chief Warlock called for a brief recess and Ron pulled him out of the room. Malfoy watched him with those smooth gray eyes, betraying nothing.
The woman murmured something Harry didn’t catch, then said clearly: “I guess I should know better at this point. Look what he’s doing to the boy.”
“Maybe you should talk to him,” he said, and Harry could only nod. Could only reach over and clasp Neville’s shoulder and hope that the other man understood.
It turned out neither of them felt much like cooking, so Harry contacted one of his favorite wizard-owned Indian restaurants. A large owl carrying an aromatic bag was soon perched on the windowsill, and the awkward silence became slightly less awkward, punctuated by chewing and the small, appreciative noises that accompany any good meal.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said then, because it was what he was thinking. “I’m so, so sorry. I had no idea. He’s been doing this for weeks, hasn’t he? Ever since you got here.”
. Not one single fact, however innocuous, would pass his lips about Harry while he drew breath. Draco had never been brave, he knew that about himself. He had always prioritized his own safety, and the safety of his family, over the rest of the world or any sort of morality. That was why he was such a terrible person, and why Harry was probably relieved to be rid of him. But that was also why he would not say anything, because his own safety was gone, finished, probably forever, but his family –
Finally, they were ready. Malfoy embraced Elena and she hugged him back tightly murmuring in his ear. Then she bent and swept Viola into her arms.
Before he could say or do anything, however, Lucius himself gasped, clawing at his throat. He reached out, grasping for something, then collapsed to the ground where he lay, silent and motionless.
They were going to throw another party: a Christmas party that would celebrate the season, Harry’s new job, and Draco’s successful completion of a semester. It had been Kingsley’s idea, of course, but it didn’t seem as terrible an idea as the first one had. Draco didn’t feel his stomach shrivel up at the idea of being on display for both Harry
Harry found, to his deep and abiding surprise, that Malfoy was incredibly easy to talk to. He was attentive and emotive, often gasping, laughing, or clapping at Harry’s stories of Rose’s and Viola’s antics. He asked good questions, too. It was a far cry from the snobbish, blood-purist youth Harry remembered from Hogwarts, and Harry found he liked this Malfoy far more.
“They never get more specific,” Hermione answered, spreading her hands hopelessly. “It goes on to paint Malfoy as a frigid, damaged ex-con, and you as a well-meaning but oblivious celebrity just trying to do the right thing…” She shook her head. “Kingsley doesn’t come off that well either.”
He seemed to be the only person in here for the moment, which was just as well. The man looking back at him from the wide mirror across the opposite wall didn’t look like he could stand to make much more polite small talk. His jaw ached from forcing a smile all evening. Draco took the opportunity to check that his dress robes were still falling correctly, half spinning away from the mirror so he could see his own back. It was such a familiar movement, and one that he had not used in so long, that he again, for a moment, felt as if he had stumbled back in time and was in the bathroom at one of his mother’s many social functions, taking a quick breather before returning to the role of dutiful heir.
“My most sincere congratulations, Harry Potter!” the man exclaimed happily as he approached their table. “I remember well the first time I saw you as a boy, with those terrible relatives of yours, and now here you are, our savior once again, extending the hand of peace and friendship across the divide of the war, your own suffering notwithstanding, I applaud you – oh! I applaud you! – for your dedication to our cause –”
, Draco thought with a start, and felt something warm pressing against his heart. Then they were standing on cliffs above the crashing sea, and the warmth inside him blossomed.
“We don’t know, Mr. Malfoy,” Kingsley said sharply. “But I must admit, you are one of our primary suspects.”
He turned back to the couch and grabbed the paper from Draco’s hand. The other man had not moved a muscle.
“So,” he began casually, sitting back from a plate scraped clean of the last syrupy bite. “Who’s good this season?”
“There’s clear motive and justified cause, but he still took the girl from her legal guardian at that time,” Robards said. “And the sentence violation – using magic when it was expressly forbidden – won’t help.” He huffed an annoyed sigh. “Any other questions you’d like me to answer for you, Potter?”
Still, something kept him from burning it – fear, but of what? Of the man who had raised him with an iron fist? Of Warden, watching every spell he cast? It wasn’t like the message said anything particularly dangerous, he reflected yet again. To any outside observer, it was just a father congratulating his son.
Beaming, he kissed Harry quickly on the cheek. They were hanging ornaments on a large evergreen tree – the newest addition to their living room – and listening to Christmas carols from Harry’s old radio. Harry himself was singing along off-key, but broke off when Draco kissed him.
But she did not read the scroll at all, merely unrolled it and set it before him and Potter with a warm smile. Two feather pens materialized in the air before them, the tips wet with ink. A bit taken aback, Draco snuck a glance at Potter. The other man was already signing – he must have read the certificate before the ceremony. Draco took up one of the pens and moved to sign his name when he caught part of one paragraph out of the corner of his eye.
“Please,” I manage to say, my voice cracking down the middle, but I’m too gone to care. I need Harry inside me, on top of me, around me. He’s staring me down like I’m the only thing in the universe, his mouth twisted in concentration as he slips a second finger inside, and I try to keep my eyes open to hold his gaze. Hungry. He looks hungry.
, eliciting a skeptical look and a small smirk. Without Ron here, Hermione’s carrying the brunt of Harry’s never-ending need to talk about Draco, yet she’s been surprisingly good-natured about it. Especially after Draco apologized to her, though Hermione refuses to tell Harry exactly what Draco said.
“You idiot,” Draco says, and tackles Harry to the bed with the force of his kiss. Harry laughs right into his mouth, his hands clutching at Draco’s forearms. They kiss until they’re breathless, breaking away to pant into each other's mouths.
“What do you have nightmares about?” Harry blurts, because she’s a professional at shoving her foot in her mouth. Malfoy’s face shutters, her lips pressing thin. “No, no, pretend I didn’t say that.”
Two months after moving into their new flat, a perfectly cramped one bedroom above an electronics store in Muggle London, Draco comes home with a length of soft red rope and a book.
Harry reaches out slowly, his chest twinging when Draco flinches again. The bite mark on Draco’s shoulder is already turning a vivid purple, and Harry swipes his thumb across the bead of blood welling there. Draco holds himself still, but winces when Harry touches the marks on his neck.
“Mmmm.” Draco ducks his head down, pressing a kiss to Harry’s silky curls. He feels pliant and soft, like Harry swept all the frustrations and fears right out of Draco’s chest, leaving just this– tenderness. His heart.
It suddenly strikes Harry how much Draco must trust him. He knew it dimly, in the way Draco tucked himself behind Harry in the Hogwarts hallways, in the way Draco haltingly asked him to get a flat together, in the way Draco falls asleep in Harry’s arms every night. This feels different, though. Draco’s eyes are wide and bright, intent on Harry’s face, and he’s putting his safety in Harry’s hands knowing
Laid out like this, in a photograph worn thin by over a year of Harry’s longing, you see so easily what you couldn’t up close.
. It was one of the first things he confessed to Harry, in bed in the middle of the night, when they first started playing.
“We’re not doing this right now. Not like this,” Harry says softly, trying yet again to draw himself away from Draco, to give him space. Draco whimpers softly, just once, tightening his arms around Harry, who stills. He’s terrified, watching Draco’s carefully upheld mask crack like this. “Draco, I need to know what’s wrong.”
it, but Draco has a worried crease between his eyebrows and Harry needs to fix it. “Let me hold you.”
“You beautiful–” Draco’s shirt, gone, “–maddening–” his trousers vanished completely along with his shoes, “absolute
“I’m not going to die,” Harry says, and Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s again. They stumble to the couch between kisses, Harry’s thighs finding their way to either side of Draco’s waist as Draco kisses down Harry’s neck to his exposed collarbone. Harry gasps, then squirms. “I’m here, I’m not going anywhere.”
“Obviously,” I mutter, turning my head to the side on the pillow. Harry snorts softly and slides his fingers fully out of me, reaching for the lube. I let my eyes fall shut, catching my breath, suddenly aware of how achingly hard I am. There’s a pillow slid under my hips then a brush of knuckles over my cock, and warmth starbursts through my stomach, making me shiver.
“Is G6 another quadrant?” Draco asks, his voice raw with curiosity, and I glance at him in surprise. At my expression, his mouth pulls into a tight line, guarded once again.
“Get off of me.” Draco thrashes, fiercer than before, nearly unseating Harry before he grabs onto both of Draco’s wrists and pins them to the mattress, leaning his weight onto them the way he knows his husband likes.
“Okay.” Draco lets himself be pulled against Harry’s chest, held tight in the warmth. Harry is still naked, his soft cock pressed to Draco’s pants-clad hip, and it feels more intimate than sex. “What now?”
“Hi.” Draco’s hands tremble as he undoes the buttons on his shirt slowly. It never stops feeling like this, a fire burning low in his stomach, arousal and shame feeding the flames equally. Somewhere in there is loneliness, too, but Draco tries not to think about it.
There’s a moment of hushed silence, and Harry assumes Draco’s asleep before her head comes up suddenly, and she leans over Harry on her elbows. In the dim moonlight she looks stricken, her eyes glittering.
Harry can’t even remember when this started– it seems as though he’s always been driving into the night, Draco breathing softly at his side. They were already friends by the time Draco mentioned his insomnia, even closer by the time their friend group took a road trip in Harry’s car and Draco fell asleep within minutes, slumped against the window. Now, Harry finds himself with his hands on the wheel nearly every night, rummaging in the car boot for blankets and jumpers to pile on Draco when it’s chilly. It helps Harry, too, the time they spend together. He feels quieter, more content, cradling the knowledge that Draco trusts him.
