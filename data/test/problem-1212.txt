“Because if we can, Ron, than we can figure out a way to turn that into a potion,” Harry said simply.
“That’s because we knew each other for years and spent all our time together for those two weeks I was with my father,” Harry said simply. “Look, I’ll talk about this more later, I have to go to Professor McGonagall’s office. Just don’t overreact, okay?”
“That’s enough of that talk,” Mrs. Weasley said. “I don’t want to hear anymore about werewolf business until Dumbledore comes—and even then it is to be kept between Harry and Dumbledore, understood?”
“You know, I’ve lived here most of my life,” Harry said. “Grew up a bit north in Westchester, went to this awful all-boys private school for high school, before coming down for Hogwarts. I’ll admit that this isn’t the best pizza in the city, but it’s still pretty damn good, and better yet it’s New York Pizza! It’s so good with—”
And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands:
Dinner came soon enough, and the pairing ignored any stares or whispers as they walked hand-in-hand towards the Slytherin Table. Blaise, Theo, and Daphne all smiled warmly at Harry, welcoming him as though he always belonged there. Harry glanced over to see Neville sitting in his usual seat, and when food appeared, Harry was shocked and relieved to smell, for once, that his food was untouched by the Alpha Protein. He looked over to the Gryffindor Table to see Neville’s shocked face, his cheeks growing rosy. The timid Alpha traded his plate with Hermione, who ate it without a problem. “Huh,” Harry said.
“Harry, that was fast,” Hermione said, her eyes landing on Draco and she immediately became a little defensive. “Malfoy.”
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L.,” Snape said with a smirk as he swept among them, passing back their homework. “This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examinations.”
“Absolutely,” Draco nodded. “We’ll have it here in fact,” he said, looking around. “Of course, none of those baubles of you will be here.”
The carriages stopped, and Harry and Draco continued to hold hands until they were in the Great Hall. They glanced at each other, looking somewhat sad. Draco pulled Harry’s chin up and kissed him fully. “Be a good boy, Harry,” he said warningly.
Remus just stared at Voldemort in shock while the man shrugged. “It is fine, my son,” he said. He turned to look at Remus and smirked, “I’ll just have to make my proposal even grander than what I was planning on previously, is that good for you, Remus?”
Ron pulled Draco out of his thoughts with a slap on his back and grinned, “Come on,” he said, and Draco barely had time to get his
“But in the meantime, I wouldn’t mind something more private,” Draco chuckled. Harry smiled, “So we’ll do it?” he asked.
Draco agreed. Organizing Harry’s clothes have taken up most of the afternoon. The two stopped for a break when food appeared around lunchtime, and thankfully for Harry, the conversations never reached any touchy or serious topic as soon enough they fell to arguing over Quidditch once more.
Harry frowned but said nothing as he watched Voldemort drink the potion. His expression did not change as he took gobletful after gobletful of the potion. There was not a sound in the room between Harry and Voldemort, only the soft filling and rinsing sound of the goblet being continuously filled until, at long last, Voldemort drank the last of the potion.
It was the weekend currently. Two weeks until the Christmas break starts, and Harry once again found himself walking in darkness. He expected his father to be angry, or in pain, or perhaps causing pain, but instead as light encompassed him suddenly, his eyes adjusted to a surreal sight. Lord Voldemort, old and handsome, was dressed rather casually, a warm sweater and heavy cloak, as he and Mrs. Malfoy sat at a table, looking over various opened ledgers, books, and plans. Voldemort looked up and said, “Good you are here… where is Draco?”
“If you wouldn’t mind my lord,” Uncle Remus said at the front door, motioning towards where the dogs ran. “They like to know when we leave.”
“Become my scion, reject the Dursleys, you will be a pureblood and my son,” Voldemort said, his hand moved slowly, holding out Harry’s wand. “With your father’s blood, Potter blood, and mine in you, you Harry all I would need is a vial, less than half a liter, of your mixed blood, which I will use as the base of my potion. If you wish to have Draco forever Harry, there will be many obstacles in your path, many hoops you must cross… but I will help you Harry, my son…”
“I would like for you to run an article,” Voldemort said. “A very interesting story that involves Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and myself.”
Harry Potter, age sixteen, smiled widely as he laughed, his hand being held by a taller, stronger boy with thick shoulders and muscles as they made their way through the woods. Harry had always been small for his age, a slender frame with a rather round butt, his emerald eyes were behind two thick round glasses, and under his mop of black hair on his forehead was a lightning-bolt scar he had received when he was an infant. The boy whose hand he was holding was a muggle named Connor. Connor was a tall teen, fit from playing rugby and using the gym frequency as he liked to gloat for Harry. His skin was deeply tanned, and his blue eyes reminding Harry like an ocean, the older teen smirked at Harry, pulling him deeper. “I set up a blanket up ahead, Harry,” he said.
“Fine, whatever,” Draco shrugged. Harry grinned and ran to get his skateboard, getting in the car a moment later. Draco had the address on his phone, but Harry decided to provide directions, pointing out where to turn and when all while getting in a debate with Draco over Kingdom Hearts.
The snake was heavier than she looked. Nagini slithered up onto Harry’s lap, curling comfortably between his legs as the Omega continued to pet him.
“Recognize me, eh? That’s a good bitch,” Fenrir smirked. “Going to have to give you a special bite, relax boy… this will only hurt a lot.” He chuckled before throwing himself at Harry. The teen snapped out of his shock. He kicked his legs out, hitting Fenrir in the jaw, which allowed Harry to roll out of the way and grab for his pants.
Harry screamed suddenly as pain overtook his body, the Dark Lord staring at him uncaring as his Cruciatus Curse hit the boy. “Do not question me,” he seethed. “You have ten minutes or I will keep the curse on longer boy.”
Niall inhaled deeply and Harry could see the red drain from his face as it slackened. “What… what would it mean if they get both letters?”
“Why? Is it because Slytherin has the highest amount of recorded Dark Wizards?” Harry asked innocently. “If that is the reason, Professor Dumbledore, then I have to say that I am disappointed.”
They were outside once more. Harry found that he was more relaxed surrounded by nature, feeling the grass under his feet, smelling the fresh air around him. Though it was cold, Harry had his shoes and socks off as he sat against one of the trees that dotted the grounds of Hogwarts. Harry’s neck felt unbearably cold for some reason, and he kept rubbing it so much that Draco eventually just took his own scarf and wrapped it several times around Harry’s neck until he didn’t feel the cold anymore. “So, what is it you wanted to talk about?” Daphne asked.
Blaise glanced at Harry with a scowl, but Harry didn’t let it bother him. Instead, he held their hands and smiled, “Come on, you still have to meet Mr. Riddle,” he said, “Then you can tell us all about how his class is wrong.”
“Tell him about you,” Theo nodded, “… and my feelings for you. Prove him wrong. He said that I’ll never find love being gay. I wanted to show you to him and tell him that he was wrong.”
“Weasleys?” Draco Malfoy spent the summer with the Weasleys?” Blaise interrupted. Harry nodded and he gave out a loud, “HA! I bet he loved that.”
“I’ve never saw this before…” Lord Voldemort breathed. They both watched transfixed as the fire continued to burn. There was no damage to the tree, its leaves kept on and its branches looked the same, if not charred, but still the flame continued. Harry’s hand felt none of it, it felt nothing except for the hot pulsing of the tree that now matched his excited heartbeat.
“So, during the summer, I started to do research both on Pureblood Society, and things that Draco would find interesting. I had no one to help me on this front, so it was a challenge. I swear I’ve learned many useless and boring information, and very old traditions that I’m sure died away, yet still called at me for some reason. One of them being the submissive marriage clause, which claims that when there is a relationship where there is an obvious submission the woman to her man, (you have to remember these were written before a time when society believed and accepted that us gays existed) they are to be wed immediately with a special set of rings showing that submission. This clause is the only thing that can go against marriage contracts or arranged marriages. Wizards believed back then that submissive women made for better wives and produce better off-springs. Well, I hope I don’t need to tell you how wrong that is, and how utterly backwards that thinking is, however I just couldn’t get it out of my head. At this point I love Draco, yet I never thought about submitting to him. I thought we were simply hung out together, holding hands, kissing, relaxing against each other. I had no idea or any concept of sex until Fred and George told me about it. I mean, I knew our dicks get hard, but I didn’t know why or for what purpose.
“How ironic since that is our next date,” Draco chuckled. He hooked his arm around Harry’s waist and Harry held onto his side. The two walked towards the couple, and Draco said in a loud, authoritative voice, “Blaise! You really should treat your submissive with more respect.”
Voldemort looked back again at Harry. “You will write to me,” he commanded. “I will find a way to see you while you are with the Weasleys, and before you go to Hogwarts. Do not worry about going against Dumbledore, or about my war. You are my son; all you should be worried about is being a teenager.”
The three all stood, and Dumbledore dismissed them. Back in the corridor, Draco took Harry’s hand and pulled him, “Come along, we have to go to my dormitory,” he said, glancing at Harry. “We are going to spend the night in Gryffindor Tower, but god help me if I will wear Gryffindor colors the morning after.”
“Yes well, it certainly is a bit surprising,” Hermione said carefully, “but Ginny’s fifteen, she’s allowed to date around—”
He mentally begged, but the devil did not move. Instead, as Harry stood by Draco and Blaise, Satan only took a step towards them, so that he could turn and sit in the reserved seat for himself, right next to Mr. Malfoy, who looked rather egotistically proud to be sitting next to the Dark Lord.
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.
“Look Dobby, just stop adding the medicine, okay?” Harry said. “Better yet, let me get rid of it. You didn’t hurt me, but you might have done so. Dumbledore made a terrible, terrible mistake giving it to me.”
“Of course, you would Harry, of course,” Voldemort said. “This is not about ideology, nor conflicts or war, but safety, your safety. Safety as a wizard in a world that do not know us, safety as a Dark Wizard in a world who fears us… and safety as a homosexual in a world who would let us die. You are young, but what they have done in the Americas, in here and over the world, I have witnessed it all. I can protect you Harry, I can give you what you have always desired.”
“Dumbledore… he somehow convinced two thieves to steal me when I was only a month old. I was left with the Potters and then given to the muggles Dursleys after my parents—after the Potters died,” Harry continued. “They treated me horribly to put it shortly, however now I never have to go back to them ever again. This summer, I found my father, my real father. He’s a strong Alpha, the strongest I’ve ever met, which makes sense seeing who he is.” Harry smiled as he thought about his father. “He’s kind and doting to me, but ruthless and cruel to his enemies, and even his followers. Not that I care, for I all know I have nothing to worry about with the Dark Lord as my father.” He watched the three, waiting for their reaction.
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry looked around with his eyebrows raised, Ginny suppressed a giggle. The train rattled on and Harry looked around anxiously as grey clouds and night overtook the sky. He did not know why he was anxious, he was with his friends, and they were having a normal talk, easily forgetting about the awkwardness that Harry came in with.
The next day, Harry felt completely fine. He had no sickness or cold sweats, or any aches. He moved normally, ate normally, and was able to keep his breakfast and lunch down. However, when it was dinner time again he felt the same coldness and his stomach protested violently. He didn’t want to cause a scene. He didn’t want to vomit twice in two days, so he forced it all down, swallowing every cough as they came up. He ate less and only waited until they were all dismissed to go to the bathroom and vomit out the sick and blood. Ron found him and soothed his friend through it.
“Not with your clothes on, dog,” Draco said darkly. He flicked his wand and Harry’s clothes were off, all folded neatly next to him. Naked, Harry grinned and rubbed his cheek against Draco’s clothed cock, his collar in full view. “Does my dog want a treat?” Draco chuckled.
“No, I’m not,” Harry said truthfully, “but I’ll get through. Can you show me where our dormitory is? I want to get my nest ready.”
“Oh, oh yes I see,” Minister Scrimgeour muttered, frowning at the small stack of papers as though reading them would be the worst task in the world. He looked around the Wizengamot. “Did anyone else read Mr. Riddle’s charges fully?”
“Well, you certainly are forward,” Lupin muttered. “I’m sorry, but tonight is not a good night for me.”
“Shut up you old hag,” Lestrange said. “Just you watch, I will become our Lord’s favorite in one move with this.” She motioned towards the writing. Lilith took a moment to read it all before rolling her eyes.
They were silent for a moment before Malfoy asked, “How was it even over there? My father wanted to send me there instead of Hogwarts.”
“They’re not useless,” Harry said, “Nobody… nobody is useless. That’s… that kind of thinking is wrong, my lord. And I… I don’t hate muggles or mudbloods—they don’t live to serve us, I don’t want that. I don’t’ want to push away my mother, or my friends. Hermione is the brightest witch I have ever known, and she comes from muggle parents and she is just as much a witch as anyone! I… I may not like my aunt and uncle, but that does not mean that I want to kill them!”
“Yeah, you like?” Harry grinned. “My godfather gave it to me for my birthday last year. Gave my mom a heart attack. Come on, there’s plenty of room for both of us.” He winked at Draco and let go of his hand only for him to hand Draco a helmet. Harry stared at Draco as the blond put the helmet on before shrugging off his leather jacket, revealing his nicely muscled arms. “Here, wear this too, it can get cold as we ride,” Harry said, handing Draco the jacket.
“I am not defending him! You both were wrong,” Harry said heatedly. “I yelled at him too for punching you Ron.”
Mr. Malfoy finally stood once more and waited for the crowd to stop. Once everything was quiet, he spoke. “Perhaps this trial has revealed more than you intended, Minister,” Mr. Malfoy said. “I believe that we have all learned the truth of several matters, including those that were not surrounding this case directly. So, to the rest of the Wizengamot, I must ask, do you believe Dolores Jane Umbridge guilty of her crimes?”
Uncle Sirius laughed as he closed his door, looking back at Harry and Uncle Remus, “Come on boys,” he said.
“Yes Harry, it is,” Blaise nodded. “You both are very strong mages Harry, Draco. It is not like I am asking you to meditate on hours on end for months and years… I cannot tell you both exactly how long it will take you. However, if you keep to it my boys, I am sure that you can achieve it soon. And then, I can teach you both
She left and Harry and Niall stay closed to each other. Around them, students were either freaking out or staying oddly stony. Harry did his best to release calming pheromones for his brother, however, some students around them turned to Harry as well, their eyes hungry. Niall snarled at them and wrapped an arm around his brother.
Dumbledore looked disappointed but stood. He shook Harry’s hand and said goodbye to Mrs. Weasley before leaving. Ron and Hermione immediately went to Harry and the three went to Harry’s room so he could explain what went on. “Oh Harry,” Hermione said, hugging him. “I’m so sorry. You must feel horrible.”
He made his way down the stairs and frowned at his schedule. It said that his first class was Basics to Elements taught by Ms. Samael in room 3R. He guessed that that would be the third floor and looked around the main room as he walked off the strange spiral staircase. He couldn’t see a clear indication of a stairway that led to the third floor of the school. He glanced over his shoulder and bit his lip. Turning to the portraits he could feel their eyes glaring at him as he dug into his messenger bag and pulled out a small lip balm tube. He folded his schedule in half and held his hand out flat, placing the balm on the paper.
Harry moved further in and sat in front of Snape’s desk. He gave the professor the note and Snape slit it open with his wand. He read the note, a scowl growing deeper and deeper on his lips. “Well, is this true?” he asked shortly.
Draco smirked and with a flick of his wand, Harry was completely naked and the curtains around his bed were closed. “Then I should do my duty as an Alpha and bring my boywife pleasure,” he purred. Harry moaned and nodded. He gave a scream as Draco suddenly lifted his lower body, Harry’s legs dangling over his head as his ass rested against Draco’s chest. His cock started to harden as his hole got wet. Draco spread Harry’s cheeks and grinned, “I think I’ll start with a little tongue play, be a good boywife, Harry, and scream.”
“Sixteen years Harry, it flew by like an instant,” Uncle Remus smiled. “To think that you’ll be a full member of our coven tonight… and heading off to the Academy once the school semester starts! Things are finally getting started for you Harry, my love.”
Daphne moved closer to Harry and smiled, “So, tell me about it, how did you and Draco start dating?”
His first stop was to get clothes that actually fit. The first shop was Madam Malkin’s for school robes. The owner was oddly silent as she fitted him for new robes. He did not feel like chatting idly, and so walked around the shop with a purpose, pointing out the robes, shirts, pants and ties he wanted and in what color. When he was done, he gathered his purchases in bags, and left to get more clothes in a better shop in Knockturn Alley.
Charlie flew a decent speed, sometimes slowing down so he could hear Harry giggle in childish delight. "Look! A deer!" As they were out the barrier ward and when they flew in at one point, Charlie almost came to a complete stop as Harry jerked his striped shirt. "Unicorns! I see a baby unicorn! It's still gold-ish!"
He jerked his head at Draco. "You're buddy here is one of their main squabble topic. Its a daily occurrence by now."
Draco had generously complained and Harry had shrugged it off. He found that whatever it was, it was innocent up till now and deemed it not worthy enough to rat himself out.
Harry wanted to faint. Draco was strict in how to handle books but when it came to Hermione that was nothing. Compared to the blonde she was the devil but it seemed he had no choice. He wasn't ready to start up a troublesome fight over it and meekly nodded, leading her the way.
For a moment, he stared at the single photo frame on the desk as he mused, about how far he had come. Harry had left Hogwarts mere months after the last battle had gone down. He had been haunted by the press, by the entirety of the population and he couldn't just go or be anywhere in peace.
As it was, Draco held a lot of knowledge on the topic. It turned out, they could shrink and apparate with their vehicles if done by coordinates but neither of them had any experience. Draco was quick to say how tricky it was, how easy they could splinch and that he really rather not try such a way of transportation.
"Thank you," Andromeda broke off a square and ate it, offering a piece to Draco who declined. "I never really have it, but once a while it's nice."
To Harry's surprise, the last option he explained sounded the coolest but very expensive and time consuming. It was like an private taxi in the sky, flying carpets to be exact, which connect Ministries around the world. They mostly are used to transport delicate items, those that can neither be floo-ed or port-keyed but any civilian can buy themselves in on the ride.
"I don't think so," Charlie went over to check the chart. It took him several minutes to find the right information but eventually told him it was just damaged. "Eggs are build out of several layers, even if the outer layer is severely damaged it doesn't matter if the inside is still intact. It's a risk egg though and it might not hatch if it isn't handled with care."
A few days had gone by, relatively quiet until yesterday morning, when the library had closed shut. Draco wasn't entirely happy and voicing that out loud, he had put up a fight with Harry to make him get the room to open again. Much like he had whined over pretty much every mishap in the house. Draco was one hundred percent blaming Harry for the troubles in their home and he hadn't disagreed. In fact, the black haired wizard was sure it was his fault, or rather the faults of some books but they didn't got scolded on. That was all reserved for Harry, because he should have but didn't told Draco about what happened in the library. Yet.
Charlie just nodded. "The only thing that has ever happened since I've been here was Mr. Muller being wrestled into the Travellers inn by two old townies for a cup of Flusher Potion to clear his head after he had one to many drinks at the bar. It was funny to see, you know, the light popped on all around, it was the talk for days!"
A/N I'm writing this story on the fly with some keynotes and a general plot to guide me. I'm writing this to further my skill/ just for fun and I very much appreciate thoughts so far. Because its open writing, I'm open for suggestions - countries, places, mini challenges to implement etc. Next chapter is partly written and a time skip as I don't want to drag too much. That was all.
Harry smiled. He hadn't had the chance to answer because the little whoop of happiness beat him to speaking.
"It says, well," Harry slipped his fingers along the lines and slowly read out loud, skipping some parts to summary it." Bermuda Triangle Island, large, sunny, last known population about five hundred, almost fully self-sufficient with a handful of import wizards to take care of the rest. Lots of farms, small city centre and apparently they turned a wrecked cruise ship at the only dock into a huge casino."
"Alrighty then," Charlie threw an arm around Harry, smiling even wider as he bumped their heads together. "Do make me look good!"
Andromeda knew what he meant. "When my husband fell away, according to the old family laws, I regained my place in the family. Its a stuffy, complicated thing, old family magicks.," She sighed. "Basically said, I'm the last one carrying the name, and so I inherited everything," She pointed at the miniature bike. "Including this."
From that day on, the boys set on making an effort to erase the air between them. While it could not be called hatred but certainly could be called a severe dislike, it needed to be gone and if not for their sake, definitely for the family sake. They both had heart for Teddy and Andromeda Tonks.
Draco raised an eyebrow and stretched before folding his arms. "They never taught that in Hogwarts."
"I grow them until a day comes that they do ask for it," Charlie said as if that was obvious. He then made a come along motion. "One more bounce around the sight before we go? It'll get dark soon."
Just as Harry was about to ask Draco if he minded a break, the bell of the shop rang. Voices filled the front room, voices Harry recognized and he paled considerably. Harry's hands shook so badly, he dropped the needle mid-stitch. Standing up, Harry walked to the door leaving the needle poking out of Draco's back just like that.
"Me?" The black haired wizard scanned the pages, noting the counter-spells weren't the easiest ones.
Harry had showered, dressed and eaten breakfast. After, he grabbed his camera and went on the mission of having the picture from him and Charlie developed. A stroke of sadness hit him for not having brought the camera along to the Nursery but he hoped Charlie would get them in again. He was sure to bring it then, if it was allowed.
Harry nodded. "It's from a chain with hotels all over the world. Good for twenty stays wherever. I took it, you're prissy arse would long for luxury every now and then." He stuck his tongue out and laughed when Draco cheeks blew up in mock anger at the comment.
For the rest of the night, they kept shifting countries back and forth arguing whether on not to include it on their road trip.
Gavriil, a short and little overweight man turned out to be very nice, albeit in his own way. He didn't speak much and barking seemed his default setting. He wore working overalls, almost had no hair left an while he wore the same atrocious glasses as Harry, they seemed to fit by his face rather well, which, spiked a jealous sting in Harry. Why didn't they look good on him, he wondered but never cared to replace them nor would he anytime soon and he shrugged it off.
He knew the Harry was useless by now. He had hissed his name a few time but got no response. "Shit."
"Alright, buddy," He smiled and ruffled the toddler's hair when he stuck his hands out at the gift Harry had wrapped for him. It was a small box, and it rattled when Draco shook it."Atrocious as it may be, this one first then."
Like, how Hermione was throwing herself on her books as if there was nothing left in the world? All she did was studying, learning and then reading some more way past midnight by the lights of a small candle until she fell asleep, using her latest read as a pillow. How she woke up, barely hours later with a cry, brushing her un-kept curls out of her blurry face, the lines of the pages pressed red in her skin and immediately went back, straight to there where she had left off?
"Never," Harry was honest about it. "I was kind of scared to do that, actually, so yeah, if you got time, I'd like that."
"Sorry, Mr. Gheata, we'll go now." Charlie said. He gave the old man a wave, who showed a ghost of a smile and a playful shoo-ing motion. Charlie pulled Harry along back outside. There, he flopped into the patch of grass beside the broom.
This intrigued Harry and asked for clarification when Charlie guided him to a bench near the entrance.
Couldn't they see how Ron's bloodshot, puffy eyes never looked at anybody anymore? How he grew thinner as time went by just because he had no appetite? He blamed himself over many deaths and of course obvious one, his brother, mourning the losses every waking moment.
Ron nodded. "Nobody can just waltz up to the Dragon Reservoir and get in. It's big and entertaining says Charlie and you can easily catch a breather there."
Intimidating was the right word, Harry thought. Silas was slim and soft but Solomon was bulky and rough. Tall too, he towered everyone in the room by at least a head and a half. Everything about him was big and brute, rough skin, many scars. He possessed a strong jawline with stubbles, masking some of those scars and high cheekbones with freckles. Then, Harry noticed his eyes and gaped.
The Auror turned to the two still flanking Draco and saw the hall was cleared. "Stand down and escort them on whatever business they have here until they leave." He turned back at Harry. "And you two aren't very smart yourself appearing in the Atrium like that. The Prophet has been reporting on the riots here for weeks now. Don't either of you follow the news?"
"Exactly." Andromeda pointed towards the other armchair. Draco sat down, barely able to look Andromeda in the eyes but did it either way, knowing she would not speak if she didn't have his full attention.
As he followed them, stumbling every now and then because he wasn't watching his footing, his foot hooked at something and he landed flat on his face. His yelp hurried the butterflies away and a little sad, he watched them leave while he clambered back onto his feet. They soon left his sight and with a sigh, looked down to check what had caused it.
Harry, with ever present grace, fell flat on the wooden floor of a large, otherwise bare room. It was dark and had no windows nothing but just a door. It took him a bit getting up. The port key trip was short but the distance far and as warned about, he felt extremely dizzy and nauseous. He did his very best not to heave as he remained where he was, not a thought was spared on getting up.
Harry nodded. Bernadette went on. "If anyone in the village knows anything, within a fortnight we'll know and from there, further action can be taken. While it's true, we have no officials, if the Mayor finds it necessary, he can request a team from the Ministry to come take a look."
Harry shuffled on his feet and looked at the floor, knowing a blush crept upon his face: "I might have.."
The first floor had Teddy's room which was originally the master bedroom and the bathroom at one side and the other side holding Andromeda's room and her study. The top floor being the attic, held many boxes in one nook while the rest was cleaned out for Harry and Draco. Two single bed on each side under the sloped roof with a thick carpet in the middle. A couch to chill on stood at the feet ends of the beds, facing towards the window by their head ends where a desk with two closets on either side was cramped in. Their room, small as it may be, definitely had earned the title home for them.
"Rough tour?" Solomon mumbled indignant. His voice rough and deep, he growled. Harry who felt out of place, looked from Silas, who shrugged, to Shelley, who rolled her eyes. She seemed to whisper something that Silas, who stood close enough to her to hear, snickered.
Harry lacked any real objection to a piggyback ride with Charlie steering his broom but he was a bit sad that while packing, he didn't have the foresight to bring his own. The upside now was that there was no wind cutting his face, hairs blowing into his mouth and that he didn't need to pay attention to anything but his surroundings. He could take everything around him in without worry. Charlie flew along the edge of the Reservoir, weaving in and out the barrier ward. Beneath them were hiking trails in the forests and hill tops stretching far beyond the Reservoir. The rustle of the leaves by the easy breeze was calming.
"Easy," Charlie approached him as if going near a scared animal while hushing Harry's loud voice. "She's just a receptionist. All she does is pass along the message to the right people and hope they take care of it before the one who gave the message comes back to yell at her for it not happening." Charlie almost stumbled over his words when he rushed to say it. He never liked dealing with angry people, he too felt discomfort and worry but he wished Harry would just calm down a bit as it made him feel even worse out of sorts.
"What are you doing?" He asked and got on the ground, noticing one of the piles held the Bermuda triangle island.
"We got you," Shelley winked and told Silas they might have some in the back or he needed to fetch them from the lower lab. Silas left on the search and Shelley made Harry sit at the round table. "He won't be long."
She said when she caught Harry staring and Harry ran a finger along them. "Never, Meda, never. I'd wish.."
He couldn't take his eyes of it, completely enthralled. Charlie was doing a little better. He had been here before but he too, was in no hurry to move onto the next sight.
Just suck it up and do your detention and please do, do listen to your teacher. Do as he says, follow your lessons and be good little students. Harry couldn't believe his ears when that was what they were basically told. The headmistress may have said it differently, but, that was what she meant. He knew it.
Harry bristled and looked at Charlie. He just shrugged helplessly. Then, the guard not so kindly asked them to leave. "Main building is closed, you know that, Charles."
"Finish that sentence, Potter," Draco spoke menacingly. "I will hex you until there's nothing left."
"Because," Draco said as he made Harry stand up. "The Aurors were here for this exact reason and I'm fairly sure they are still in the vicinity."
"More than I need though," He answered and tapped one stack. "These are for the drivers licence and these," He tapped the other stack. "These are about taking care of the motor, it wasn't said I needed to learn that, but, if I'm going far and stuff, I guessed I need to know how to fix the bike will it break on me."
Thus, the next morning, Harry left the house early. He was on a mission. Eventually, it had taken him quite a few hours but when he came back at the house, he had a bag full of study books and had signed up for a course that promised him his drivers licence within three months. It was an expensive course but with all the money he had, it barely made a dent in the pile of gold stocked up it his Gringrott's vaults.
Charlie immediately continued to drag Harry towards the double door entrance but Harry stopped him. A little shy, he fiddled with the camera until he got it of his neck and held it up to Charlie in a silent question.
A rough hour later Harry walked into the kitchen and dropped down on a chair with his feet on the table asking Kreacher for coffee. Receiving the cup moments later, he warmed his hands and slowly stirred, trying to smooth out his mood.
"Nobody left the war unscathed. You didn't, I didn't and Harry didn't either. He has a bad heart. It's barely functioning as it is and he's on medication to keep it working. He has to take it every day, if he doesn't, well, any bit too much strain on his body or any bit of emotional pressure sends his heart haywire. I didn't know Harry didn't take his medication as prescribed since he's been here, because, if he had. This wouldn't have happened."
Draco stood in total silence for a minute or so, merely staring down at his fallen friend and his mind completely in shambles. "What in the world is happening?" He asked in thin air as the heavy thunder rumbled outside.
"We need a good rest," Charlie muttered and mounted the broom, begging eyes making Harry move to come along. "We'll figure out in the morning what to do."
She smoothed down her robe, stuck at curl that dangled in front of her eyes behind her ear and made way to the fighting boys. As she passed the window, it went quiet and the flashes of light meant that the boys had turned to their wands. Quickly, she rushed out, her own wand at the ready.
"What now?" Solomon questioned his brother over his shoulder as he stood a little helplessly in front of Harry, with his hand out, and literally no reaction. Silas shrugged, Shelley made a motion to get on with it.
"Let me check," Silas snipped his fingers thinking out loud, musing over its location when Shelley stopped him.
Draco followed him with raised eyebrows until Harry was done and took his seat at the table, holding a cup of coffee. Only then did Harry look up, white as a sheet and with dark circles under his eyes.
The room, four walls with one covered in wire choices and a see through mirror door to the front didn't hold much. There being just a metal supply cart, a chair, as well as a bed in the middle and a basin next to the mirrors set in a corner for good view. A machine stood on the other side against the wall to clean and stock his instruments in. The room was cold and kept empty for easy cleaning.
Apologies forgotten, Harry sheepishly scratched the back of his neck. Charlie looked the same as ever - red hair done in spikes, baby blue eyes and still the odd one out in build in the family. He wasn't as tall and lanky as his brothers nor as broad shouldered, but slender and fit instead. He wore a striped shirt, sturdy jeans and knee high boots. He had his Dragon handler goggles around his neck, the one part of his work clothing he even wore in his down time, it never really parted with his being.
"Odd?" Charlie asked. "They're just one of many at the Sanctuary. They're a bit off, I know, but we're all just basket cases here, devoting our lives to a cause."
"Say.. Meda?" He turned towards the elderly Lady who was waving her wand, getting tea ready and she hummed in reply. "He doesn't really look scared.. Does he?"
Before they left the cafe, they did agree on was a trip to acquire their passport the next morning. Harry already dreaded another morning of waking up early.
Harry pouted, Draco laughed and after another half an hour of banter, they finally made way out of the shop. Trailing the street and leaping from store to store, Harry bought Ron his very own chessboard, a shawl for Mrs. Weasley and other odds and ends for the Weasley clan as well as a generous gift card from the craft store for Andromeda and some plush toys for Teddy. Harry was pleased with his haul, pretty much done but Draco, by far, had just started even if, his arms were loaded with bags. During their shopping, the gifts were their main topic, not really delving into other topics but as they passed a travel agency, Harry realized that he didn't quite know how it all worked. He broke his banter with Draco about the gaudy red shawl Harry had chosen and decided to ask.
Harry shrugged. "I guess so, then." Harry answered. He wound the wire expertly around his finger and held the needle close at its point and settled it down. "Here it goes." He pierced the skin and settled the first stitch, Draco just hissed, but knew not to move.
Draco smirked and pecked Harry on the cheek. One understanding look passed between them and the blond continued his business while Harry pulled his bag into his lap and rummaged through it - digging up the knife, Harry's eyes shined and he twirled it happily between his fingers - slowly, he turned his attention back on his companion. Draco was carefully turning a potion bottle above a small flame, letting it warm up evenly.
Charlie picked a stem, let it fall into a glass test tube, corked it and put it in his pocket. "I usually collect on demand, but in a place like this I can't help but collect some and see if they want them, and if they don't.. Well." He shrugged.
“The same happened, more intentionally I assume, with the diary you have destroyed three years ago,” Dumbledore said, looking at Harry. “Once I have realized its nature, I had hoped that it would be the only one that he had created… It seems, however, that I have underestimated Lord Voldemort’s thirst for immortality. I am sorry to distract you, but Harry do you have any idea of how many he has created? Or which objects?”
“This place will do,” Harry said, looking around. “We will convert this to the meeting room. Get rid of the chairs and table, and have my throne, my father’s old throne, right at the top. He pointed to the end of the long room.
Harry looked at Draco for a moment, “Actually, I’ll take you up on that, thanks,” He said. “I’ll write a reply during our break.”
Harry and Draco turned to see Blaise standing by the door dressed somewhat normally, compared to his leather straps from last night. “Relax, relax,” the demon said before the boys could react. “I just want to talk with you two.”
“I am,” Harry smiled, “however, I don’t have my broom with me. Because of the thing between me and the Dursleys.”
“I’m just saying,” Niall shrugged. “I think I’m going to go make out with Neville some more. His ass is so fat and soft it feels so good to grab it.”
“Very well,” he said, turning the knife in his hand so that the handle faced Harry. “Then you will give me your blood.”
Nagini hissed angrily and poked Harry’s cheek. She poked him again and again as the Omega tried to swat her away. “Wha—ow that hurts! Stop!”
he said mentally as he ran naked away from the small clearing. It was dark under the woods, and Harry did not know where he was going. He just had to lose Greyback. If he could lose the werewolf, then he could circle back and help Connor.
Draco smiled, pulling Harry a little closer, “Thank you Harry, and I won’t let anyone hurt you. I promise.”
“I’m sorry sir, but if this is all and you do not have anything related to my education, I have to go get some food before detention,” Harry said and with a curt nod, left.
Harry met with Ron and Hermione in Ron’s bedroom. He looked tired as he closed the door behind him and glared at Ron. “You didn’t have to punch him!” he started.
“And you will not hide it,” Draco said. “I want everyone to know that you are mine, boy.” Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head. “Besides Hermione,” Harry continued, “everyone in Draco’s friend group does it! Theo is collared, along with Crabbe.”
“Either way, I would like for you to visit Madam Pomfrey after this for a physical, just to make sure that everything is healing smoothly,” Professor McGonagall said, and the boys nodded. “Good, now then Mr. Riddle, the second biggest accusation, at least in the newspapers, is your kidnapping, that is not to mention all the rumors milling around the students blaming your… for lack of a better word, adventures, on Professor Dumbledore.”
Wormtail’s voice shook; he was frightened beyond his wits. But not of Harry, of Voldemort in the cauldron. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.
“She is the mother of demons, sir,” Harry answered. “She was the First Wife before the False Lord cast her aside for Eve.”
There was a cage in the corner of the basement behind a large stack of old yet expensive looking furniture. In the cage were an endless supply of rats it seemed. “Wormtail will be useful even in death,” the Dark Lord commented before taking a rat. He forced the rodent’s mouth opened and forced the poison in it. The rat squealed as Voldemort held it by it’s tail. It thrashed and struggled, it’s black beady eyes looking to strain before droplets of blood seeped out of the corner, and its movement stopped.
and tried to kill me!” He yelled louder. He struck Greyback again, but this time the werewolf caught the fist. Draco snarled and bit viciously while the older man just laughed.
“Hmm, nothing specific yet,” Draco shook his head. “It just goes on about what the Soul is. However, it does make the Ministry look hypocritical, doesn’t it?”
“Better, now we can go,” Draco smiled. The bag shrank and Harry pocketed. They held close together and Draco activated the Portkey.
“Heavens no!” Remus gasped. “You will help out obviously but you’re just kids! Where is all of this coming from, what did they do to you?”
“So it’s a piece of soul you’re trying to absorb,” Draco said, nodding slightly. “That is extremely dark magic, way more advance than what I know personally. What about you?”
The Potters and Krums decided to try their best to enjoy the day. They stuck to staying outside, wandering the grounds as Harry bounced between holding his brother’s or Viktor’s hand. They had lunch on the ship to avoid the Hogwarts students as even when they were walking, Niall and Harry couldn’t help but notice them every now and again. None of them approached the two, instead just staring at them from a distance. Late in the afternoon, Viktor cleared his throat, “Harry, when I win, I want to speak to you, alone,” the older Alpha said. Harry smiled at that and nodded.
“So, it’s a good thing that Dumbledore’s got him,” Ron said in a slight questioning tone. Harry nodded.
The familiar just yawned but didn’t look to disapprove of the name. Harry brought Loki down and introduced him again.
His hair fixed, Draco left Gringotts and into the night sky of Diagon Alley. It was starless, dark and haunting. Only the moon shone, and even then it was a struggle as clouds covered it constantly. Draco walked, his head held high, towards Knockturn Alley. He went down the short steps that led to the tight, crowded street when a voice stopped him.
Mr. Malfoy glared at Blaise, but out of fear or something else said nothing. Instead he just stood fully and looked at his wife. “Come,” he said, “it seems we have arrangements to see to. Riddle would need to know of this.” Without waiting, he left the room.
“Yes, talking with Professor McGonagall I’m assuming,” Harry nodded, looking at Viktor for confirmation. The young man nodded.
Harry could feel Niall’s anger radiate from the Alpha’s body, but he kept him leveled as Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry knew that Umbridge was looking for any sign of weakness, and the Omega refused to give her any. He did not show weakness in Durmstrang with the other boys, and he refused to show it now. So he kept his and Niall’s legs together as they continued to cut into their own skin, anchoring both himself and Niall.
They held onto each other tightly as they began to spin around, the ground disappearing from their feet. They saw flashes and glimpses of other fireplaces as they sped on by and before Harry could become dizzy, the world around them stopped and their feet felt solid ground.
“He said that it wouldn’t be good if the Lestranges die… good for either of us,” Harry whispered, leaning forward so Blaise and Theo couldn’t hear. “I destroyed the ceiling and top part of the jail.”
“Well, as I told Harry and his uncles, it took me a while to finally get to my grandfather. His angels did not want me near him, whatsoever, however he heard word that I was there and invited me past those gates. He knew everything about me even before I could introduce myself. He was kind, polite, basically everything my father isn’t. He asked why I was there, and I answered that I was looking for a way to stop my father. I explained my situation, with you and Draco, and he was surprised to hear that I loved you two boys. He… tested me with my love, asking questions, and giving tempting scenarios, but I pushed them all away in favor of you two. He appeared to be satisfied as he told me what my father did to the old gods.
It was odd how their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and locked it in his trunk. Mrs. Weasley went to Diagon Alley in the meanwhile, and returned at six with their books and a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took with a moan of longing.
“Then for now…” Blaise said slowly, “let’s just return home and focus on meditating. Worrying about others’ plans is useless until both of you are mages.”
“Yes, father,” Harry nodded. “Tomorrow I’m going to look for how exactly the Alpha Protein is getting into my food. I know that it is tied to my usual seat for whenever I sit with Draco, it doesn’t appear. I’m thinking of going to ask the house-elves in the kitchen.”
“Yes Alpha,” Harry whined. Draco dressed Harry in his school robes, an act that Harry did not even feel embarrassed about. He wanted to be doted on in that moment, to have any excuse or reason to have Draco touch and hold him just so he could forget the disgusting smell of McLaggen’s arousal. The train stopped and Harry held onto Draco, not even thinking of separating to sit with his friends on the carriage ride to Hogwarts. Students glared and whispered about him as Draco led the small group. The five got in and closed the carriage. A few moments later, the thestrals in front of the carriage moved, pulling the group to Hogwarts.
Harry nodded and dutifully repeated her name with another thanks. He made his way to the backdoor, dreading the walk back to Charlie's home. He hoped the redhead was back already, because he needed to loan his broom. All the way over, he cursed himself for not bringing his own and vowed to send a letter home and request it be sent over to him before the day was done.
"Tea?" Bernadette asked. Harry refused. He tapped one of the leaves on the plant, the few dust particles on it flew up and Harry watched them dance in the sunlight. He asked her to continue.
Andromeda closed the books she had scattered on the desk and stacked them away, making room. "Sit," She pulled out the chair and Harry sat down. She then placed a carton box on the table and enlarged it. "I didn't know what to gift you, but I remembered some maps Sirius had once upon a day. It was a bit of a hassle to locate them, not knowing if they'd still excisted but here they are."
Harry turned the book around and discovered it was a travelling guide of sorts, listing all official settlements around the world. "Huh, interesting."
"Malfoy." Harry acknowledged and slapped the photo frame with its glass down on the desk. The picture within a snapshot of the very first finished piece of art he ever made. The art stuck on the back of the man in front of him. He rubbed his eyes and settled his glasses back on as he let himself fall back in the chair, stretching, eying the other and wondering what he wanted this time.
He walks through the halls of Hogwarts as a zombie. Dragging forth his body even if it protests, screams at him for a moment of peace but he can't sit, can't relax. He must walk, can't stay in one place. He must move - go somewhere, anywhere in the hope to shake the feeling of being hunted. Alas, he isn't hunted. Not anymore. No, he's haunted. Haunted by his own ghosts of evil and guilt. It's damnation.
Over the year he had removed a fair number of decorations from this piece and redone a whole lot more, one weekly basis. He added a thread here and another there but that first, silly clumsily done flower was always, just there. As if it had the power to demand to stay and both men obliged.
He never noticed how the students around them picked up their own broken pieces and put themselves back together, not with the aid of the elders but of their own. Those of their own age who lived trough the same horror as they did. One small step followed by another they had gotten themselves healing, growing stronger, better and were ready to let go.
He soon came back on that. How he wished he hadn't and followed his gut feeling instead of leaving the decision to a Gryffindor. Foolish, he knew. It all went by in mere seconds.
Harry nodded. "I know, Draco is a bit miffed he let that slip to me just as we were turning onto your property that's why he is hiding on your couch."
One would say he was depressed, another called him insane and yet another thought he needed love and care, or a shrink and meds. He was of opinion he just needed to get away. A breather. Away from attention, from the adoration, from the fame, the hate and from the pain he saw all around and sometimes felt.
"Draco?" Harry questioned, the blonde absentmindedly flicking through a book near the till which he added to his basket as Harry called him out.
Harry had to read the note twice before he understood that one of the other Dragon handlers got knocked off his broom and Charlie had to take an emergency shift because of it. "Let's hope it isn't serious." Harry muttered. He knew falling off a broom could cause horrible injuries.
Their banter was interrupted by a loud bang. Harry winced, shaking his head in dismay when Draco asked where the heavy sound came from.
Draco picked himself up, dropped the blanket back in its box by the fireplace and tried to smooth out his rumpled clothes. It didn't work. So, he pointedly ignored the full-length mirror he walked past where he knew he would see his disheveled self with probably sticking up hair as he searched for Harry.
"Strawberry gashes." Harry said again and Draco sat up with difficulty so he could nod his agreement. Now that he sat up, he overlooked Harry and his eyes found the knife. He took it and pulled at Harrys' clothes until he had the bare shoulder in sight. Draco nicked the skin. Carefully he caught a bead of blood with the tip of his finger as it made its way out and held it up for Harry too see. "Strawberry gashes." He grinned and licked his finger clean, he slumped back down again, finding his spot against Harrys' side without difficulty and gave the knife back at him.
"We will come back with a warrant, probably ransack the place and arrest the owner." Ginny said, surprising Draco by answering truthfully.
"I see no reason why." Harry said almost instantly, keeping his attention on getting the small boy in his lap to eat his breakfast.
Harry got up, quick to understand now would be the best time knowing he wouldn't drop while fighting with Draco, having the medicine still running thick though him. And when he stood next to Draco, he had the cheek to ruffle the blonde hair. "It's cute, really, how bad your hair can look." And with that, Harry made a run, knowing the blonde wouldn't react all too well on that.
"Alright," Charlie took a deep breath. "The muggle population, I'm talking world wide throughout, has in the last centuries grown exceptionally large and became a lot smarter with their technology which has reached new highs in recent decades. Now, are you aware why the Statue of Secrecy, signed in on 1689, established in 1692 and fully complete and enforced a little into the 1700 was for?"
Nods were shared at the table and soon the topic was forgotten as Teddy burped loudly and broke the tension.
"Oh," Harry nodded but cautiously stepped away from the door, just in case. "That'll explain it, I guess."
They were loud and screaming over each other to get their question out the loudest in a hopeless attempt to get an answer. Their camera's were flashing and puffed up little clouds of smoke, effectively creating a mist that would ruin the photo's they made. Several quills zoomed around his head, one lost its floating piece of parchment and poked his face instead. It was chaos all around. Harry tried his best to get back on his feet and away from the group he was very close to hexing, where it not, he could not reach his wand by the way they had closed in on him.
Harry nods, he still hadn’t decided what he was going to get Draco, “But what would you possibly get the spoiled vampire who literally has everything he could ever ask for?” Harry teases.
“I’m fine,” Draco says, “I’ve been wanting to for a while, but I’m not sure what actually made me do it.”
“Alright then,” Harry says thinking he might just let Draco sleep, “I’m going to go see about him,” he says, before wandering off to Draco’s bedroom.
Draco scoffs, “You just don’t get it, it took me forever to even admit to myself that I was gay, and then I had to come to terms with the fact that the girl I thought I was in love with, I only loved her as a friend, she was my best friend, and I had to break her heart,” he says, “and I finally worked up enough courage to say it aloud to all my friends, and apparently a guy I wanted to snog, only to be attacked for reasons unknown, and completely forget that I had come to this realization, and that I worked myself up to actually going through with it, only to have all those memories erased, and set me back who knows how far.”
flipping through the first couple of pages, stopping at an article about a decrease in blood donors in Ireland.
Jamie nods, and takes off his top, as he sits down on the sofa, watching Draco kneel on the sofa beside him.
“I’ve said nothing abnormal, this is what people do, they make nice with their partner’s friends,” Draco says, “All I want is a party for my birthday, invite my friends, invite your friends, invite whoever the hell you want,” he says, moving to get up from the table.
Draco smiles taking a drink of his mead as he dances with Blaise, turning around, switching their positions after a minute of dancing.
“Ah, Mister Malfoy, you’re awake,” Draco looks over to his left, finally taking in his surroundings, and the uncomfortable bed.
Harry looks over at Draco, being very careful not to let his smile show, “That doesn’t sound like you’re asking for a hug.”
“You don’t scare me Draco,” Harry says finding his voice, “and you can’t get rid of me that easily,” Harry says, “you say you want to be with me, not because you need me, but because this is what you truly desire, and what I desire is to be with you,” Harry says looking at Draco.
“Thank you,” Anthony smiles, “though I think the bunny might be cuter,” he says giving Draco a small wink.
The fact that Harry spends more nights having a wank thinking of Draco, is not something that he’s willing to admit, especially since Draco is so unobtainable to him.
“Just let me do this properly,” Draco says with a voice so gentle, if Harry didn’t know Draco so well, he wouldn’t know it was Draco Malfoy speaking these words.
Harry is sitting at his desk it’s a Thursday afternoon in mid-December, and he’s staring at the front page of the Daily Prophet, and he could scream. He’s not sure how, but the Daily Prophet had somehow got a hold of the fact that he had been dating Draco Malfoy, the headline read “The Chosen One, dating fallen from grace Malfoy boy."
“It’s nothing,” Harry says wishing that he had just been paying attention to where he was going, “I need to go,” he says, walking away from Draco.
Draco sighs pulling his knees up to his chest, “You can come in Potter, no need to stand in the hall.”
I’ll show you overzealous, Draco thinks to himself, as he reaches back, turning the knob on the door, stepping back into the bedroom.
“The legs on that one, eh?” Ron Weasley says, stepping up beside Harry, it was very obvious they were looking at the same person. Whether or not that was because Ron saw Harry looking, or Ron was legitimately interested, he was not sure, but jealousy did rise inside Harry.
The following night Draco finds himself at Astoria’s house, he’s not sure why he came here, but he figured it was one night, and anywhere else was better than the manor right now.
Harry can’t stand it another moment; he leans over pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s, kissing him hard on the mouth. Draco doesn’t care if Harry’s messing up his lipstick, and Harry doesn’t care if he’s getting red lipstick all over his mouth. Harry’s hand finds its way into Draco’s long blonde hair, pulling them closer together, as he kisses him. A soft quiet moan forms in Draco’s throat, as Harry’s tongue, slips past his lips, and brushes against his own, and Draco’s hands, are in Harry’s dark, tousled curls, suddenly wanting more from his lover.
Draco smiles in between kisses, he slips his feet out of his shoes, immediately losing four inches of height, leaving his shoes in the middle of the floor, smiling as he pushes Harry back, just slightly, he can’t help but notice the tie his lover had decided to put on, it was the exact same color as the silver lace on the dress Draco was currently wearing.
Draco comes out of the bathroom five minutes later, after making himself throw up, twice. Feeling a little bit better, Draco leans against the sink, as he brushes his teeth, before he makes his way back to the bedroom, stumbling once before he makes it back to his bed.
When Draco pulls back and retracts his fangs, he makes it a point to lick the excess blood from the bite mark against Harry’s neck.
Harry was definitely not thinking, “It’s like telling someone you like to be tied up while getting fucked,” he says, “you’re allowed to leave some stuff out, everyone still knows you’re fucking.”
“What about after the bite heals?” Harry asks, making a note to go back to the self-healing bites after this.
Harry makes his way into the bedroom, trying his best to stay quiet so he doesn’t wake Draco. Harry gently closes the bedroom door behind him, as he begins to undress, wanting to crawl into bed beside Draco, who was fast asleep in bed right now, and Harry couldn’t help but admire how sweet he looked when he was asleep. Harry quickly pulls off his trousers, and unbuttons his shirt, leaving them in a pile on the floor as he strips down to his underwear, before pulling the sheets back on the bed, crawling into bed beside Draco.
“Okay then,” Harry says, continuing to take his shirt off, looking at Draco when he’s unbuttoned his whole shirt, looking at Draco.
“I’m willing to put in work, and find out exactly who Draco Malfoy is,” Harry says, looking over at him, “That is, so long as you’ll let me.”
Harry nods, “He’s over there talking to,” Harry pauses watching Ernie talking to someone dressed as a wolf, “Is that Anthony Goldstein?” Harry asks, “Merlin, I haven’t seen him in years, I wonder who he’s here with.”
It’s two months after his attack, Draco has come to terms with his new life, he may not like how things happened, but he’s learned to accept how things have played out for him. Draco’s even allowed himself to make a few new friends. Tonight, Draco was going to a party at his new friend, Neil’s house. Neil was a vampire like Draco. Draco met Neil at
“You’ll feel better,” Harry says, tilting his neck toward Draco, “Or is this not why you’ve been cranky?”
Harry smiles, “No,” he says, “I asked him if he wanted to go for coffee, and he said he wasn’t sure and was all shy about it,” Harry says, “eventually he gave in, and let me take him out.”
Draco is sitting at the table, finishing a bowl of what looks like pink porridge, when Harry walks into the dining room.
Thank you guys so much for sticking around and reading till the end!!!! I know it was VERY long you guys! but I appreciate you taking the time to read :)
Draco steps into the bath, and he has to admit the hot water felt amazing, and he closes his eyes, “Potter I’m serious, we’re not bathing together,” he mumbles.
Draco swallows, as the blood begins to fill his mouth more quickly than he anticipated, he almost thinks he did something wrong, but somehow in the back of his head, he knows he’s done it right. Draco presses his tongue against the vein in her neck, noting her pulse, as he applies a bit of pressure slowing the flow of blood into his mouth. Draco is surprised by how easy it is, Neil was right, there was very little sucking involved, he just had to control the flow of her blood, and swallow. He didn’t have to think much about her pulse, in the back of his head he just sort of knew, like Neil said he would.
“But,” Harry starts, “You’ve never cared about other people in my life, it’s always been you first, then me, then you again,” he says, “but now you care about people I care about.”
This time Draco’s cheeks are stained with a pink tint, as he clears his throat, “That can be arranged,” he mutters.
Harry takes one more look at his lover, biting the inside of his lip, before walking away to get himself another drink.
Harry frowns, sitting on the edge of the bed, “Your burnt,” he says, getting up to quickly close the curtain the rest of the way, “I’m sorry, I thought I had it closed.”
Draco nods, “I swear,” he says, “now if you don’t put your mouth back, I might be saying something else,” he murmurs.
Draco’s cock, was pressed against the back of Harry’s throat, and Harry’s lips were red and swollen, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he was going to be able to last, but he knew he wanted this to last all night.
One minute later, Draco feels Jamie’s pulse increase, and at the same moment, he hears the fireplace whir.
“What about the things they’re saying about you?” Harry says, “They’re saying some pretty nasty things.”
“Almost,” Draco says looking at Harry, “I just need you to do one thing for me,” he says, “one thing, and then I’ll take you straight home, and” Draco pauses for a moment, “defile you,” he whispers against Harry’s ear.
“I think, that’s who you might have been with that night outside Winsworth’s Bridge,” Harry says, watching Draco drink from his mug and spilling a little bit.
Draco raises an eyebrow, he actually wasn’t feeling very tired anymore, he was actually feeling quite energized, “What kind of tests?”
Once again there is some Vampire lore that I've made up as a combination of lore from Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead, and The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris.
Harry nods, too tired to move right now. Draco gently shifts Harry in an attempt to lift him off, causing the brunette to whine in a desperate protest, “Draco no,” he murmurs.
One button at a time, Draco starts to undress taking off his shirt, opening his shirt Draco saw the bruises, yellow, red, grey, blue, that covered his body. Draco was one who loved his body, and to see it in this state upset him, and angered him. Someone had done this to him, made him look like this. Draco drops the shirt to the floor, before his eyes wander down his torso his flat abdomen, bruised. Draco unbuttons his trousers pulling the zipper down, letting his trousers pool at his feet. Giant, dark, bruises covered Draco’s legs, and Draco suddenly wished he had never looked in the mirror. He hated everything he saw.
Draco can’t actually believe this is happening to him, but he refuses to let himself feel sorry for himself, he was Draco Malfoy, and vampire or not he had pride in himself.
Draco nods, trailing his fingers down the thin piece of fabric, before grabbing hold of it, pulling Harry back in for another kiss.
Draco smiles, “You know how this works, you push me to take you further every time we do this,” He murmurs, “and I can’t take you any further.”
Draco comes a moment later, Harry’s name on his lips, and his entire body is trembling, and he can feel his skin buzzing.
“You’ve been avoiding me for an entire week, and now you’re offering me coffee and biscuits?” Harry says.
Draco scoffs, “Don’t act so shocked that someone would actually want to go out with me,” Draco all but snarls.
“I like it,” Harry says, “your light hair and your silver eyes complement each other so well,” he says, “sometimes I think I’m looking at a photo of a model when I’m looking at you.”
“Okay,” Harry says after a moment of silence, deciding he had to trust Draco’s judgment, “Have you talked to him about that night?”
Draco glances over his shoulder at Harry, “do you want me to take it off?” he asks, “or leave it on?”
Draco laughs, “Fine,” he agrees, before walking back to his bedroom, making his way to the bathroom.
Draco does as she asks sitting at the table, smiling when she sets a bowl in front of him, “What’s this?” he asks his eyes going wide in excitement.
Draco goes almost an entire month denying himself any opportunity to talk to Harry, he’s not sure why he does it, but he’s been fucking miserable.
Harry pulls down Draco’s trousers, as Draco’s hips lift up slightly, and Harry can’t stop staring at the prominent bulge in Draco’s pants. He isn’t sure what to expect, but he can sense the anticipation deep within his body radiating from his core, as his finger lingers at the waistband of Draco’s pants.
“I’m not ashamed, I just still need to work out so much about my new condition, before I can even understand it myself,” Draco says.
“He had his hands down your trousers, and it was so disgusting, because you obviously weren’t in a state to consent to any of it,” Harry says slightly angry.
Draco leans in looking for her vein, he was sort of scared and wondered if it was too late to back out now.
“Astoria’s sister? What could she have to do with this?” Draco asks, taking a drink from his mug, spilling quite a bit, “oh for Merlin’s sake, Zella,“ he calls out, reaching for tea towel quickly cleaning himself up. A moment later the house-elf appears at Draco’s side, ready to fulfill his request.
“And how many times do I have to say, he’s not even my type, I’m not attracted to him,” Draco says, “I’m just thirsty,” he mutters.
Harry can’t help himself, he’s got his cock in his hand, stroking himself quickly, as he watches Draco reach up behind him, and unhook the bra he’d been wearing. The bra slips down Draco’s arms, and Draco tosses it onto the floor with the rest of his undergarments.
Harry exhales heavily, looking at Draco, but before Harry could say anything Draco interrupts, “Look at it this way, you have a ham sandwich,” Draco says, “does it make sense for me to jealous of the pig?”
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you enjoyed this chapter! We're about halfway through the story. I do realize it's a very long read, but I do appreciate you sticking it out and reading it <3 Thank you so very much!
“Well I don’t think it’s that weird, and I won’t bother you while you do what you need to,” Harry says.
Harry sighs, “I was fine just snogging, but then I don’t know what happened, I started feeling like something wasn’t right,” he says, “but all I can think about is snogging him,” he sighs, “How can I feel both?” he mumbles.
“I know you saw that picture of me they posted in the Profit last month,” he says plainly before letting go of Draco’s hand, he didn’t like being reminded of how he was outed publicly without his permission.
Draco had said he was thinking about breaking up with Astoria, but he hadn’t thought he told anyone he was actually going to do it, he wasn’t even sure he was going to do it.
Draco frowns starting to wonder if something bad had also happened to his parents, “Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy,” he says quickly, “Are my parents alright?” he asks.
“I’m not gay,” he insists, “I mean, Imogen is bi, Tracey is a lesbian, you’re gay, I’m only here to get drunk it seems like,” Blaise says, “I never get laid when I go out with you guys.
It’s two weeks later, Draco was getting dressed in his bedroom, Blaise was in the next room turning the radio stations every few moments.
Draco looks at Harry for a long moment before he speaks again, “Potter,” he says his voice a little softer than Harry was used to.
Draco takes another drink from his glass, “shit,” he mutters as a little bit of blood drips down the side of his mouth. He sighs heavily, wiping the sides of his mouth again.
“It’s nothing,” Harry says softly, letting his cheek brush against Draco’s silky-smooth blonde hair.
It was just after noon when Harry arrived, and he can’t wait to crawl into bed. Mostly because Draco was in bed, and he missed sleeping next to him for the last week. Harry had been spending more and more time at Draco’s house, spending the night nearly every night. When Harry couldn’t spend the night, Draco would begrudgingly stay over at Harry’s, but that only happened about twice a week.
Draco quickly covers his mouth with his hand, scooting to the far side of the bed, trying to get away from Harry as quickly as he could.
“Well, generally speaking, a vampire can go about two days three at most, four if absolutely necessary, and if they’re older,” Draco says.
“How did you know we were in here?” Draco asks, he had put a charm on the bedroom, so anyone in here would have privacy from the rest of the party.
Draco ponders this for another moment, “What else do you know about her?” Draco asks hoping that something would help jog his memory of that night.
“We’re not as different as you think,” Harry says, “and I wouldn’t mind being your friend,” he says.
Two and a half months later Draco stands in his living room, a near-empty glass of mead in his hand, talking to Neil when Harry walks up beside Draco, pressing an affectionate kiss to his cheek causing Draco to blush and grimace slightly.
Harry is immediately distracted by the red, red lipstick, that his lover must have applied after they’d arrived because he doesn’t remember it at all from earlier this evening. Or perhaps Harry had been too distracted to fully see his lover because it appears he’d missed the beautiful white gold hoop earrings with encrusted diamonds, yes those were definitely diamonds, hidden between long strands of that platinum blonde hair Harry had grown to love so much over the years, that was so beautifully setting off the entirety of this ensemble.
Harry can physically feel his heart skip a beat and, all he can do is nod in response. Harry feels nervous, and he can feel his hand sweating against Draco’s.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I’ve got to go” he says repositioning the strap on his bookbag on his shoulder, before turning to walk away.
Harry looks back at Ginny, “I love you, Ginny, you’re one of my best friends, but I’m not going to stop dating Draco,” he says, “You can get onboard, or there’s the door.”
She nods, “I’ll send for your parents straight away, I’m just going to hang this for you, and then I’ll let you get back to sleep,” she says, hanging a bag of blood, and Draco watches curiously.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry moans, grasping onto Draco’s shoulder, taking more of Draco’s cock inside himself.
Harry grins, “in that case, we’ll revisit this later,” he smiles, before sitting up on the bed, letting Draco free of his arms.
“Stop crying mother,” he says, gently removing her hand from his arm, “It’s better this way, I’ll go tomorrow evening,” he says looking at his father before turning to walk to his room.
“That part is sort of instinctual, you just sort of know,” Neil says, “but Cami is a professional, she’ll let you know if you’re getting too close.”
After being in his room for a few hours, Draco begins to feel that metallic taste fill his mouth again, he quickly grabs a blood bag from the desk before sitting down on the edge of the bed. He wasn’t actually sure how he was going to do this, but he really couldn’t stand to see the sight of himself with fangs right now, not after everything that happened tonight.
Over the next few weeks, Harry starts finding it harder and harder to stop thinking of Draco. He’s never talked to Draco, or anyone really, the way he had been talking to Draco lately. He starts to think if he could things might be easier.
“Ginny?” Harry asks confused, before turning around to see the red-headed girl standing behind him, with a disapproving look on her face and her arms crossed over her chest.
“But that guy in France was just a lunatic,” Draco says, “Product of inbreeding I suspect,” he mutters.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry groans, letting his eyes slip shut, as he tosses his head back, grinding his hips down against Draco’s, “Yes, Draco!”
Draco’s back arches as his eyes slip shut, a quiet whimper escaping his lips, as Harry continues sucking, savoring every second Draco was inside him in any capacity. Draco reaches down, his fingers tangling into Harry’s hair, as Draco lifts his hips slightly, pushing further into Harry’s mouth.
After a moment Harry starts to move, picking his hips up moaning softly as he rides Draco’s cock. Draco sighs softly, guiding Harry’s hips down further causing Harry’s eyes to roll back slightly, as his body meets Draco’s. Harry moans, his cock twitching against his lower abdomen.
Harry watches Draco he’s still utterly speechless, he’s not sure if he should be happy or sad right now.
Draco pulls back in the opposite direction, “No,” he says, he was absolutely done with the cuddling for the day, he wanted his space now. He liked Harry, but this was too much for Draco in such a short period of time.
Draco stares back at Harry for a moment, and raises his eyebrow half a centimeter, watching him curiously.
Draco mewls softly, as Harry’s warm hands caress his exposed skin. Draco turns over facing Harry, slipping his thin legs between Harry’s, tangling their limbs together.
Draco is quiet for a moment before looking back at Harry, “I can’t believe you actually hooked up with a guy in the loo.”
Draco is quiet for a full minute before he speaks, “I probably wouldn’t have nicer personality traits had this not happened to me,” Draco says agreeing with Harry, “It is something that I’m learning to live with, I don’t think I’m quite to the point where I’m exactly happy with the way things are, but I think that I could get to that point eventually.”
Draco shrugs, “someone will have to help you I suppose,” he says, “by day four, you’re more or less simply existing by breathing alone, too weak to move or even open your eyes.”
“You don’t like it?” Draco asks, not that he would get a haircut for Harry because he actually liked the extra length.
Draco nods, “Alright then,” he says watching Harry get up, and start walking toward the door before opening the door for Harry.
Draco thinks for a moment, the name sounded familiar, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on why “Andi Sefer?” he asks after a moment.
Harry leans down, pressing his lips against Draco’s, kissing him again, letting his tongue slip past Draco’s, as he moves his hip, moaning softly against Draco’s mouth.
“I know, you get all dressed up, you go for coffee or something, and more times than not, he’s a bad kisser.”
“Blood donner shortage in Ireland,” Draco says softly, “apparently blood banks in Ireland are trying to find ways to conserve their supply of blood for vampires,” he explains.
Draco nods, “Well I still can’t remember, and would have no idea why I would want to go to Winsworth’s.”
Draco turns his eyes down momentarily, he did not expect to be having this conversation today, and especially with Harry Potter.
Draco didn’t hate it, he thinks it’ll take some getting used to, like when he had to work out blood bags, “Yeah, I liked it.”
“He had his hands all over you, and you were clearly drunk,” he says, “and that bloke was acting like a complete troll,” he mutters.
Draco knew exactly what he was talking about, “Yes, it’s true,” Draco says, standing in front of his father.
Draco says nothing, and he kisses Harry. Harry’s knees are suddenly week, as it takes every bit of energy inside of him to stay standing, he kisses Draco back after a moment. Harry can’t help it, the small whimper that passes his lips, as Draco kisses him. Harry wants to run away right then, he turns to run horrified.
Draco watches the way Harry stirs his tea, while he takes a sip from his own mug, this time he wasn’t so lucky to keep it from spilling over his lips. Draco quickly wipes the corner of his mouth, looking back at Harry.
It’s not that it doesn’t hurt but fuck if it isn’t a pain he would gladly take every day of his fucking life. The stretch, the ache he feels within his body, the arousal buzzing beneath his skin.
“Definitely not,” Draco says, "and I only ever hooked up with Anthony that once, and that was enough.”
“Come,” Harry says, taking hold of Draco’s hand, leading him to the side of the room, where there were tables, the room was very well lit, so it wasn’t as though they had the semblance of privacy from a dark corner. Harry pulls out a chair for Draco, and Draco sits down in the chair and crosses his leg over his knee, and watches as Harry pulls up a chair in front of him.
Harry looks at Draco, he thought it was very sweet that Draco wanted to make nice with his friends and to do so solely for Harry’s sake, but, “I don’t need anyone’s approval of who I date,” Harry says softly, “I’m an adult who makes his own decisions, and just because my friends say they don’t like
Draco watches Harry for another moment, before bringing the glass to his lips, letting the blood pass his lips, with minimal mess, before setting the glass back on the table.
Harry watches Draco, they had such different upbringings, he starts to wonder if they could really be together in a relationship. They were so opposite.
Draco looks suspiciously at the candy, “Hmm,” he takes the candy from Harry, looking closer it did appear to be a blood lollie, he was curious now.
Harry can’t help but laugh, Draco had described his flat, minus the children. His neighbors had two dogs though, and they went at it all the time.
Harry’s moans and soft sighs of pure pleasure are Draco’s favorite thing about fucking Harry. Knowing that he could make Harry make these obscene sounds, and make Harry desperate for him, was enough to get Draco off, and he had in fact gotten off on it more than once.
“Not exactly, I’ve learned that the fangs actually take in a bit, and the more they take in, the quicker it gets into your system and satisfies the need, and the quicker the fangs can go away,” he says.
“Draco!” Harry all but screams as he sees stars. Draco’s cock prodding directly against his swollen prostate. Harry’s scratching at Draco’s thighs beneath him, “Fuck Draco” he moans.
“What happened to me?” He asks, starting to inspect his body, his pale skin was bruised, almost everywhere, which explained the soreness he was feeling.
Hermione sighs heavily, “you’re supposed to be writing your Defense Against the Dark Arts essay, instead you’re staring off into space.”
Harry looks at Draco for a moment, before he nods, “yes,” he says, “but you’re going to have to come get it.”
Harry in comparison was only a mere two on the scale of best dressed, while his lover exceeded all of the levels on the scale. The dress was long, it fell all the way to the floor, and made a tiny pool of fabric on the floor at the back of the dress. Harry knew the shoes, the four-inch heels, silver in color, were keeping the rest of the fabric of the dress from touching the floor. The dress had a long slit straight up the side, all the way past the mid-thigh. Something that would have brought Harry shame had he been the one wearing it, but his lover was beautiful in the dress. The slit of the dress was lined with a tiny lace of silver fabric that continued around the bottom hem of the dress, and around the neckline, a very simple V-neck that would make any pair of breasts, no matter how big or small, look fantastic.
Draco glares back at Anthony, “I certainly didn’t ask to drink your blood,” he says harshly, “And what makes you think that’s something I would want to do?”
“I know we had a fight Astoria, but I don’t remember what it was about, I promise not to hurt you in your sleep,” he says.
Blaise looks at Draco, “All I did was make sure the two of you were alone at the pub, I kept everyone else busy, what was said between the two of you, I have no idea.”
Harry smiles, there was no way he could even bring himself to take his hands off Draco right now, so he only had one other option. Harry’s hand slips under the waistband of Draco’s pants, he was half hard already, which only made Harry’s cock twitch with interest.
Harry watches Draco, he swears he can see real emotion in his eyes, “I don’t understand that, having someone else take that from you, but I do understand finally plucking up the courage to admit to yourself that your different, and that saying that out loud to other people might make them look at you differently, and that’s a scary thought,” Harry says looking back at Draco, who looked as if he was holding his breath as he listened to Harry talk, “I know what it’s like to be scared to come out, I’m gay too.”
Harry reaches down a moment later, opening his pants with one hand, letting the head of his cock free from his jeans, freeing him from the distraction of his own aching erection, while he focused on getting Draco off, and damn if having a half-naked Draco writing beneath him, wasn’t the hottest thing he’d ever experienced in his entire fucking life.
Draco wraps his arms around Blaise’s waist, “purple dress, white heels,” he murmurs into Blaise’s ear.
“To talk,” Harry says, “I uh, brought you this,” he says holding out what appeared to be a lollie, “It’s a blood lollie, I thought it might help.”
Draco can feel Harry’s warm skin pressing against his back, he’d taken off his shirt. Draco was also very aware of the fact that he could feel Harry’s erection pressing against his back, removed his trousers too, it appeared.
Draco smiles, he definitely wanted to and it didn’t help that he was angry at Harry, so he wanted to do so just to spite him.
Draco glares back at Harry, “It turns out not to have been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me,” he snarls, “That honor would go to meeting you.”
Harry nods, “Right, sorry,” he says frowning slightly, “I just- never mind,” he says looking back at Draco.
Harry looks solemnly at Draco, “I could never imagine what it’s like to be you, Draco,” Harry says softly, “but I understand why you feel the way you do,” he says, “I understand why you’re so hurt by what’s happened, and I understand that because of what’s happened your whole life has changed, and that you’ve been discriminated against simply because of
“This is everything to me,” Draco snarls, pulling his hands from Harry’s, “This is who I am now, and I’ve had to learn to deal with this, I’ve had to learn to deal with my life the way it is now, and I’m bloody fucking tired of it being the worst thing to have ever happened to me,” Draco says fiercely, “I am finally getting to be the person that I want to be, I may have died six months ago, but I also woke up to the world around me, and it was like jumping into a pool of ice water, and sometimes I still feel the shock of the cold water hitting me right in the chest, yes, I’m still a spoiled fucking brat, and I’m an asshole, but that’s just Draco, and Draco’s never needed anyone to take care of him before, and I don’t need you feeling sorry for me, because I don’t feel sorry for me,” Draco says looking back at Harry, “the course of my life changed, but I haven’t changed, what I want hasn’t changed, and I don’t need you justifying the things I do, or why I do them, or telling me what I need, I don’t need you to take care of me,” Draco hisses.
Draco smiles, watching Harry step into the fireplace, watching Harry disappear into the green fire, before he gets up, going to his own bed.
Harry watches Draco reach for the floo powder, before he jumps up from the sofa stepping into the fireplace beside Draco, grabbing his hand, being careful of the burn that covered the backside of Draco’s hand and the green flames transport them to Draco’s flat.
Harry smiles feeling strong enough to sit up on his own, he sits up in Draco’s lap, pulling his hand into his lap as he gently slides a ring with a tiny diamond on it, onto Draco’s finger.
“Yeah, alright right after I send an owl to St. Mungo’s because you are definitely mad,” he says, Harry was asking him to share
Harry swallows around Draco’s cock before he pulls off. Draco breathing heavily as his head fills with orgasmic fog, he opens his eyes a moment later, glancing down at Harry before he says, “Shall I take care of that for you?”
“No,” Draco says, turning the page of the catalog, “I’ve always had things done for me,” he says crossing his legs, “Even as a child,” he says meeting Harry’s eyes.
Draco was a bit taken aback by the use of his first name from Harry Potter, and it makes him stop thinking about the fact that he could hear Harry’s heartbeat from where he was standing.
A moment later Draco feels a bit of blood slip past the corner of his mouth, he swallows quickly as he pulls his fangs from Camilla’s neck.
When Draco answers the door, he’s greeted by a very beautiful with, with long platinum blonde hair, wearing a black V-neck tee, and a pair of blue jeans that fit her body so well, Draco was almost jealous of the way her legs looked in those jeans, he wanted to look that good in his jeans.
Draco smiles, kissing Harry’s neck again sucking gently, rubbing his thumb over the slit of Harry’s cock, “You’ve been so good for me,” Draco whispers against Harry’s ear, nibbling at his earlobe.
Draco wraps his hand around his erect cock, and Harry instinctively lets his mouth open. Draco slides his cock into Harry’s mouth, and it takes every ounce of self-control he has in him, and at this current moment, that’s not much, not to fuck Harry’s pretty little mouth until he comes. There will be plenty of time for that, Draco tells himself.
“Blimey, I didn’t actually think he had a chance with her, and now he’s going home with her,” Ron says watching Harry walk, hand in hand with his date out of the room.
“Well I don’t know how I feel about that,” Anthony says, “That’s what I was talking to Harry about.”
“I keep forgetting it’s only been six months,” Harry says, “I feel like I’ve known this you for so long,” he says.
“I haven’t,” Harry insists, “But maybe it wouldn’t be so bad,” he says, Draco was the one who wanted to keep things quiet, and he insisted it was for Harry’s sake. Something about sparing him the looks and whispers of being the boyfriend of a former Death Eater, and a vampire.
“Did you have a date planned?” Harry asks less out of curiosity and more because he wanted to make sure Draco hadn’t started seeing someone else in the last week.
Harry pulls himself off Draco, and drops down onto the bed beside Draco, a thin layer of sweat visible on his skin, “That was brilliant,” he says, still catching his breath.
Draco spins around, pulling his hand from Anthony’s, “Don’t touch me,” he snarls with so much venom Anthony’s sure he’s going to have to suck the poison out of the bite Draco just took out of him.
Draco turns the page in his magazine, before glancing up at Harry, “you begin to lose your impulse control,” Draco says, “by day three, your irises are completely red, and the fangs have sharpened to draw blood at any contact.”
Draco always sort of felt guilty when he drank from Harry, he never knew Harry was A negative until the first time he drank from him, Draco was so delighted he didn’t want to stop, and he almost didn’t. Draco hadn’t told Harry why he refused to drink from him for nearly a month after that and when Draco finally admitted to Harry that he didn’t
Harry steps out of Draco’s fireplace, and he can’t wait to see Draco. It had been six months since they officially started dating, and Harry had been on assignment most of the week, so he was ready to spend some time with Draco this weekend.
“Mister Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall says emerging from the adjoining hallway, “I understand that you are eighteen now, but please watch your language in front of the younger students.”
Draco stares back at Harry trying to go over every single thing he ever said to him, and he was sure he had never said that.
When Draco pulls his fingers out, Harry’s body is shaking and Draco can see sweat forming against Harry’s chest and he has to have him right then.
It wasn’t as private as Harry would have liked, but at this moment Harry didn’t care who saw him kissing Draco right now, and he knew only a handful of people knew Draco occasionally dressed in drag, so he could be kissing anyone, and that made it even hotter to Harry. Kissing his lover, in this sexy dress, in front of so many people. Harry knew the longer they sat here kissing the more attention they were going to draw, but none of that mattered right now. All that mattered to him, was Draco. Draco’s hand in his hair, Draco’s tongue against his, fighting for dominance, Draco’s skin, touching his.
Draco walks back into the kitchen, pouring himself a glass of fermented AB negative, Harry had bought it for him as a birthday present, he hardly noticed Imogen and Blaise standing in the kitchen talking.
By the end of the week, Draco has found himself a new place to call home. It wasn’t easy finding a magical place to live, right in the middle of a muggle city, but he had found what he liked to refer to as his basement penthouse. The building was fourteen stories high, and seven stories down, it housed those witches and wizards who happened to have a lot of money and would settle for nothing less than exquisite. The building was concealed to muggles, who only saw what appeared to be an abandoned office building.
“I think that I’m going to have to test everything at some point,” Draco says, “but I have a lot going on right now, and don’t think adding to that by being, ‘bloodthirsty’, for lack of a better word, is going to help solve any problems.”
Harry thought but didn’t say. His mind wheeled anxiously but no names could he find. “I don’t know ma’am,” He said softly.
Vernon was exactly where Voldemort left him. Voldemort smiled at the man and said, “The plans I have for you. Years of beating, scarring, and abusing my son. How to properly thank you for all of this? I could scar your own body, leave no trace of your skin unblemished as I brutalize your body. Or perhaps, I would torture your mind, putting you under the stress and despair that you made my innocent child feel, making you feel insignificant, like a bug only to be squashed. Or perhaps I can simply torture you and watch as you are driven insane. So many choices…” The Alpha chuckled. He turned swiftly and plunged his hand into the man’s body, their eyes meeting as he pulled out an organ, leaving no damage or holes. It was the man’s liver and it burned in Voldemort’s hand. “Or perhaps I’ll do all three,” he whispered.
life with him, his vampire life. When a vampire elects to turn another, they can choose to bond that vampire to them.
Draco pauses for a moment before he nods, “Yes,” he agrees, “I am happy in this relationship, with you as my boyfriend and I want to move forward with you, and I think that includes being nice to your friends, and having their approval, yes.”
Draco did need someone to keep him accountable, he most definitely would have backed out of something like that, especially if the timing didn’t suit him just perfectly.
“Accio bottle,” Draco calls, reaching his hand toward the bathroom, and a bottle of lubricant flies into his hand.
Harry looks at Draco, now he didn’t want to leave, now he wanted to keep talking to Draco, “Have you come down from that ledge?”
Ginny stares eyes wide in shock, “Why the hell would you do that?” she asks, “He has plenty of feeders to choose from.”
Five minutes later Draco shows Izzie out, before going into the kitchen, sitting down next to Harry, picking out some toast for himself.
Draco lets his finger slip between Harry’s cheeks teasing at his entrance, and Harry’s whining increases, and fuck if Draco didn’t think it was the neediest thing, he’d ever heard before and he just wanted to hear it on repeat for the rest of his goddamn life.
Draco smiles, “How lovely,” he says, it’s that moment that Draco realizes he’s still in his pajamas, “Oh, I’m not dressed,” he says.
Draco shrugs, “It was bound to happen, I suppose,” he says, “I’m sorry about the things they’re saying about you.”
“I didn’t expect you to run through that last bag so quickly, when your thirst reaches a certain point, it just sort of happens on its own,” she explains, “but with time, and practice you’ll be able to control it on your own.”
Draco shrugs, before sitting down against the wall beside Harry, “It’s just different Potter, it’s not the same for everyone, and you have to be ready to deal with the stuff that comes after,” he says.
“Izzie and Myles are in the bedroom down the hall,” he responds, “And there’s also blood champagne chilled, in the kitchen, help yourself.”
Harry takes the magazine, beginning to read the article. He was shocked and appalled as he read. Reading the violent nature of the attacks performed by the vampire in question, and the way the authorities decided to deal with the crime in question, Harry just couldn’t believe what he was reading.
The ice and creature broke apart. No blood spilled; all they could hear were the breaking of ice as the completely frozen creature broke off into hundred of pieces. Blaise, Draco, and Mr. Riddle stared at the boy, impressed and scared. They all stared at the frozen remains. Blaise took a step forward and hesitated, looking at Harry before swiping his hand slowly, the remains burning up and disappearing in black soot.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed. They both were silent, lost in their own thoughts. A smile slowly spread across Harry’s face as he envisioned the three of them together: sleeping in the same bed, sharing morning kisses and quiet intimate moments, dates and outings… Harry loved it all. “I think it’ll work,” Harry said. “And, you know, I think that Blaise wants it too.”
Hermione and Ron looked at Harry with some sympathy, however the young werewolf did not want to hear it. Instead he stuffed his face with bacon and sausage before moving on to eggs. Professor McGonagall came along, and after a misunderstanding, both Harry and Ron were cleared for Potions with Professor Slughorn. They had a break their first period, and Harry wanted to use that to go talk with Dumbledore with Draco, but when he brought the idea up to Draco, the Slytherin told him that he unfortunately had Ancient Runes.
The two found their godfathers already waiting for them. They were wearing casual attire and Remus held his arms open for the two boys. Harry and Niall walked into his embrace, and their godfather scented them, doing his best to calm them. “Come on boys,” he whispered, “it’ll be over quick. Harry, do you want to apparate with me or Sirius?”
“So you are to say that having the boys carve their hands is a suitable punishment for pranking?” Mr. Malfoy asked.
“Everything stopped. The fevers, the nausea, the pain. Everything went away the second we touched each other,” Draco said. “Then we just became exhausted. I took Harry to my dormitory and we were finally able to go to sleep.”
Harry returned to the Slytherin table and saw that Malfoy was done eating. “So, if we’re all ready,” he said, sounding ten times happier, “shall we get going?”
“For fuck’s sake Sirius listen to yourself!” Uncle Remus screamed, his voice making the walls shake. “There is no stronger version! Why can’t you be a fucking man and take the fucking potion yourself!?”
Alone in his office, Dumbledore worried about what he saw. It was a glimpse, barely a second long, however, what he saw scared the old man. It was a face he thought he would never see again, a face he thought was fully corrupted by Dark Magic. “How can it be?” he muttered to himself. He watched Harry all day, worried about what he should do. He cannot move openly against the boy, no, he needs more information. But still, if it was true, if the boy knows about his true lineage, then Dumbledore must act! But he couldn’t bring himself to. He was too worried, too scared of that single second, of that handsome face he saw that is filled with much evil and power. If people knew that he had a hand in creating that insanity… “All I can do now is watch,” he muttered gravely. “Watch and hoped that I am wrong.”
Harry felt very awkward. He looked between Ron and Hermione who also shifted around awkwardly. “I didn’t lie to you,” he said.
Harry nodded. He stood up and said, “I’ll try to get as much information as I can. I’m going to go tell Draco now. He’ll be both worried and angry if I go without telling him.”
“To deny that is against now only our Church’s laws, but it would mean going against the Dark Lord himself,” Mr. Riddle said. He looked at his wife and said, “My wife will perform the tests to see if there is a womb inside you Harry.”
Nobody waited for him as he stepped out, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley only a second behind him. She had him sort out the schoolbooks as she immediately began cooking dinner. When he was done, Harry took his, Ron’s, and Hermione’s schoolbooks and looked for his friends. He found them outside and still felt that awkward tension between them. Ron sniffed and gave Harry a cheeky smile, “You reek of Malfoy even more now, mate,” he said.
They spent the night together on the chair, marking every inch they could as theirs as Draco filled Harry over and over again with his seed. Harry did not know what the future will bring, he did not know how the Light will react, how Dumbledore will react when they find out Voldemort is dead only for Harry to take his place. However, as he rubbed his sore and gapped hole, Harry knew that he will always have his husband by his side, and with Draco next to him, he will never regret anything that they do together.
“Is that jealousy I hear?” Harry laughed. Draco glared at him. “It is, isn’t it?” Harry laughed. “You are jealous of Ron.”
“NO!” Harry screamed, standing up. “FRED WAS KILLED YOU MONSTER!” He looked around and saw Ron, his fists curled tightly, his whole body shaking with anger as he fought back tears.
“By Lucifer…” Mr. Riddle whispered, “that’s why… that is why our Dark Lord has chosen you.” Harry turned to face Mr. Riddle and for the first time saw true fear on the High Priest’s face.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “It’s not you convincing your father and mother, it’s all three of us. And we will!” Draco sighed, and nodded. Harry smiled and tightened his hug before the three of the moved to the telephone in the hallway.
“That’s good at least,” Uncle Remus nodded. “So… today is the big day, huh? The wedding is scheduled to start at sundown, I’ve watched the news and the weatherman says that that would be at four-thirty this afternoon. The morning is yours to relax and prepare boys, Sa—gods know we need it.” The three nodded.
Harry looked down to see his own name. So the family tree was his? However the more he looked at it, the more it didn’t seem right. His name wasn’t connected, as it normally should, to James and Lily Potter’s names. Instead, their names were connected by a dashed line with a single word underneath it.
Harry thought, “He does hold my hand a lot… but we haven’t exactly went on a proper date that doesn’t turn umm lewd. But we did have lunches together during the summer… and we were supposed to have a date during Hogsmeade but umm… some things happened,” he said elusively.
“PERFECT!” Loki cheered, “I LOVE WEDDINGS! The dresses, the food, the setting, the bedding—I especially love the bedding—and the silly murders when they realized they’ve laid with the wrong person! Oh I love it all!” Quick as a fox he appeared between the three of them, an arm around each neck, “You know I was actually planning of trapping you three in that bottle there with the troll but then you mentioned a wedding! And I get to get revenger on Satan, oh happy day! I have to tell you Satan-spawn, your father is a wily one—not bad on looks either, tried to get him to lay with me a couple times—this was before you squishy humans even existed—and he denied me! Me! The Trickster God! God of Chaos and Fun! That’s not actually my real title, but still—when is this wedding?”
“Great we have the mute Potter,” he sneered. “Stupid Omega probably doesn’t even know how to hold a conversation.” He felt something pressed against his stomach and looked down to see that Harry had his wand pressed against it.
“Speaking of, our first Hogsmeade visit is coming up,” Draco said, “and I thought about it, and I want to officially ask you on a date.”
“SHUT UP!” he roared. The common room grew silent as everyone turned to Harry. He glared at them all, “Fred is dead! Gone! And all you idiots can think about is fucking gossip? Do you have any compassionate at all? Or are you all just full of bullshit as you give us your shit-eating smiles and talk nothing but half-hearted lies?”
Harry could not stop himself, as he leaned down toward Draco’s lap, the head of Draco’s cock glistening with pre-come, taking his cock into his mouth. Harry's lips stretch slightly as he takes Draco’s cock into his mouth, and he moans letting his eyes slip shut. Harry tastes Draco on his tongue as he takes him further into his mouth.
“Okay,” Draco says, “Then let me be very clear, because I will never have this conversation with you again, I am a vampire, and I drink blood, and sometimes that blood is supplied by a person, designated as a feeder, that person could be of any gender or sexuality, but the only thing that person is providing me is sustenance, and nothing more,” Draco says looking at Harry, “are we clear on that now?”
Draco shrugs, before getting out of bed, “Do you want it to be?” he asks, walking into the bathroom.
Blaise looks back at Harry, giving him a short smile in acknowledgment, as Harry steps out of the fireplace.
Draco nods, “yeah, alright,” he says, “anything to not be round here,” he says, pulling the sheets up over himself.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says quickly, staring back at Draco, with Jamie draped over him, only half dressed.
Draco watches Harry unbutton the lengths of his shirt, before shrugging it off. Draco wants to protest, and insist that he’s not thirsty, but Harry smelled so sweet, and Draco was thirsty.
“Taking nights off work, throwing him parties,” Ron says, “doing anything he asks, you’re just spoiling him.”
Harry follows Draco through to the kitchen, “Are you really hungry? Or are you thirsty?” he asks curiously.
“It was him,” Draco says, “I left the pub with him, and we walked to another pub and had firewhiskey.”
“I’m just here to help,” Harry says, stepping closer to the bed, “They said you came to earlier, so I came as soon as I could.”
Harry looks up at Draco waiting for Draco to leave the room, as he knew Draco so desperately wanted to. Harry knew that Draco wanted to be alone, so he could process his own feelings over what he has said, and Harry has learned that he absolutely must let Draco do that. Harry knows he has to let Draco be alone to process his feelings, and he wants Draco to do that.
Draco had confidence Blaise would make him look good, Blaise had very good fashion sense, if he’s being honest, Blaise helped him pick out most of his wardrobe. Draco pulls on his trousers, zipping them up, and looking at himself in the mirror, and damn did these look great on him. His legs were going to be the star of the show, which Draco loved, “my legs look great in these,” he says.
Draco gasps, his textbook falling out of his hand and onto the floor. His eyes staring dumbly at Harry’s hand grasping onto his, he doesn’t pull his hand away, but his brain short circuits. It takes twenty seconds before Draco finds his voice again. When his voice quivers ever so slightly Draco wants to swear, but he forces the words out anyway despite himself.
Harry nods, “Well, I,” he starts again, “I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to feed from me,” he says finally, pulling his knees up to his chest.
Draco glances over his shoulder, looking at Harry, “Would you like to see the rest?” he asks softly, “Or do you just want me to take it off?”
“Fuck Draco,” Harry moans loudly, as he comes with hot, white streaks over Draco’s chest, and over his lower abdomen, “Oh fuck,” he pants.
Draco gets up, flushing the toilet, before stepping out of the loo, “Oh,” he says, when Harry was standing there, holding out a dressing gown for him. Draco puts on the dressing gown looking back at Harry.
When Draco lets go of Harry, he watches his face for a moment, he watches the sadness settle in Harry’s face, “I am sorry I hurt your feelings,” Draco says, “but I’m not sorry I said any of it.”
Harry looks down at his exposed shoulder, glancing over at Draco who was looking at his neck with a sense of longing.
“Literally you could date anyone in the entire world that you wanted, but for some reason you’re attracted to me,” Draco says, “I’m an asshole, I’ve been a bully to you for years, and I constantly tell you how much I hate you, but for some reason you find me attractive.”
Harry could cry, Draco had hurt his feelings, and the fact that he just knew that, the fact that Draco could say any of that to him, the fact that Draco Malfoy was being this open, this raw with his emotions, and thought that made it okay to say any of those things to Harry.
Harry is positive his face is as red as a tomato, and Draco can’t help but smile, “I-I- Uh,” Harry stammers.
Toby smiles, tipping the bottom of Draco’s glass up slowly, and gently, and Draco drinks down his mead, as Toby continues to tip the glass up until it was empty, and Draco had swallowed everything.
Draco savors the taste of Harry’s blood entering his body and allows himself to indulge in this for a bit longer until he can feel Harry’s lifeforce beginning to rise from deep with Harry’s being.
“I started with my brother four years ago, and when I saw how I helped him, I wanted to help other vampires, I’m a feeder three times a week,” she explains, “and a lot of the new vampires choose me, so I’m used to a bit of hesitation with the bites, but you’ll get it eventually,” she smiles.
Draco lets his hand move from Harry’s hair, down his back, and trailing over the back of his shoulder, his fingers making their way down Harry’s spine until his hand rests on Harry’s waist.
Draco reaches out, tucking his finger into Harry’s belt loop, pulling him closer. Draco looks up at Harry, as he puts his arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him so that Harry was standing between Draco’s legs, and their chests were touching but just barely.
“Do you want me to do something else?” Harry asks, and Draco swears he could come just staring back at Harry’s swollen lips and knowing that he’d done that.
“Camilla,” Neil says softly, and a gorgeous red-haired girl stood up from her seat, smiling she walked over to Neil.
Draco is quiet, as he watches her leave the room, and walk down the hall. Draco reaches up, pulling down the blood bag, reading over the label. It seemed like an ordinary blood bag to him, though he hadn’t really seen a lot of blood bags, so he really couldn’t know.
Draco lets Harry’s blood flow freely into his mouth, as Harry leans into Draco’s body, hoping that after Draco had fed, he would stop being so cranky.
Draco watches Harry’s hand, as he lingers near his shoulder, “Are you trying to kiss me goodnight or something?” Draco asks.
A moment later Blaise hands Draco a pair of dark blue jeans, and Draco stands up, putting them on, “Are you going to find me shoes too?” Draco asks.
“I also remembered why I broke up with Astoria,” he says, “and I think it’s why I left with Oliver that night.”
Draco rocks his hips forward, his eyelids fluttering as he pushes into Harry. Harry actually sobs beneath him, biting hard on his lower lip.
Draco looks at Harry wondering if he was really going to tell him one of his secrets, “I can’t tell you,” he retorts.
Draco was a bit more graceful when he took off his underwear, sliding them down his hips, and down his thighs, letting them fall onto the floor, before kicking them aside.
“Yeah, it’s not pleasant to think about it like that, but there’s just something so satisfying about it warm.”
Draco puts on the vest, buttoning only the one button, and he looks at himself in the mirror and couldn’t deny that he did look really good. A moment later Blaise hands him a black blazer, and Draco puts this on as well.
Draco stands in the hallway his arms crossed over his chest, “You’re an idiot” he says looking back at Blaise.
Harry leans over pressing a gentle kiss to the back of Draco’s neck, “It’s me,” he says, “go back to sleep,” he says soothingly.
“You have something to say,” Draco says softly, and Harry could melt at the way Draco’s voice is so gentle with him, it makes Harry feel like it’s alright to say anything to him right now at this moment.
“Draco no,” Narcissa says, no longer trying to hide the tears that were now flowing down her cheeks.
Draco isn’t quite sure what Neil means, but he does begin to feel as though he should stop soon. Draco eases his tongue off of Camilla’s vein, letting her blood flow into his mouth for another moment, before he swallows, and releases her from his mouth.
Neil had talked to Draco on his first visit to the blood bank, he was born a vampire, so he had twenty years of experience with blood banks, and how they worked. Neil came in every day, and he chooses to use feeders, rather than use blood bags. Neil swears the taste is so much better when it’s fresh, and he’s been trying to get Draco to try it for the last month. Draco always politely declines, blood bags just seemed so much easier to handle to Draco.
“Because people are going to look at him differently for dating me, especially after the war,” Draco stated.
Harry is still very impressed by Draco’s strength, he was taller than Harry, but he was smaller, and since Draco had become a vampire, he was stronger than Harry, perhaps stronger than Harry would ever be.
Astoria smiles, sitting down in Draco’s lap, letting her hand rest on Draco’s waist, as she leans in pressing her lips against his, kissing him softly. Draco rolls his eyes, Astoria always had to make an entrance, he humors her and kisses her back.
Harry lets his hand hold firmly onto Draco’s, “You don’t have to be sure about anything, we’ll do this together,” he says, “I’m a little scared myself,” he admits, “but I know that I want this, with you.”
“Harry, what the fuck are you even saying?” Ginny says, “I know you’re sort of friends with Malfoy now, but this is just insane even for you.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “Draco, I have real work to be doing right now, I don’t have time for your bullshit.”
Draco lifts his hips, and the dress begins to slide off his hips, and down his legs. A low groan of approval escapes Harry’s lips, as Draco sits back on the bed, pulling the dress off from around his ankles, before waving it into the wardrobe, where it hung itself neatly.
Harry’s heart is racing, he’d only been thinking about doing that all night. Harry wasn’t sure he could though, Draco was already taller than him without the extra four inches his heels were giving him, and as much as Harry wanted, he wasn’t sure he could reach those beautiful lips which were begging to be kissed.
Draco wants to laugh, “Yeah, it’s part of the deal. I stay here, and my parents will pay for everything so long as I never go back home and soil the family name with my vampirism.”
“It’s a power exchange thing,” he says quietly, “pleasing you, making sure you’re satisfied, being obedient, earning what I want,” he says looking at Draco.
It’s that moment that Toby moves in closer, tipping Draco’s chin up, staring into his mouth, he was surely staring at Draco’s fangs. Draco had started keeping them out more often, and he kept them out when he went out drinking, and clubbing, so he wouldn’t accidentally surprise anyone he was dancing with or snogging.
A shiver runs down Draco’s spine, as Harry’s hands move to caress his stomach, and his chest, before slipping his hand beneath Draco’s bra, slowly dragging his fingers across Draco’s taut nipple, causing the blonde to moan softly. Draco leans his head back against Harry’s shoulder, as Harry continues kissing at his neck, nipping gently, his left hand was occupied with teasing Draco’s nipple, as his right hand descends lower, beneath the pool of fabric from the black and silver dress Draco was wearing.
Ten minutes later Tracey comes into the kitchen talking to Neville Longbottom, as they get themselves some drinks. Neville tells Draco Happy Birthday, as he gets himself a glass of firewhiskey. Draco says thank you and continues talking to Imogen and Blaise.
A minute later Blaise comes back with a pair of black boots, that Draco was sure he had never worn before, they had a thick sole, and they reminded him of some sort of hiking boot, but a bit fancier.
Draco rolls out of bed on a Friday, choosing himself a feeder from the catalog he kept in his bedroom. Draco had a bit of time before his feeder was supposed to arrive, he decides to check on his potions brewing in the study. He was sure his Alihotsy Draught would be ready today, and he needed it for an alchemy experiment he was testing. Draco smiles to himself seeing his potion had finished, he grabs a crystal vial, and empties the cauldron into the vial, he had brewed it flawlessly, he was actually quite proud of this one.
Draco leans over, pressing his lips against Harry’s neck, kissing his neck, as Harry presses his hips down, grinding against Draco. Harry moans loudly when Draco’s fingers find his nipples. Draco can’t help himself as he runs his fingers over Harry’s taut nipple, rolling the pink nub between his thumb and index finger.
Later, when Harry joins Draco on the sofa, he looks over at Draco thinking that, that had been too much, and he took things way too far.
Draco takes a breath, calming himself momentarily, before looking back at Harry clearing his throat, “I want you to keep doing what you’re doing,” he says softly.
Entering the Dining room, he distracted himself with attempting to find space for the extra bags amongst the mount of packages stacked high. Every morning extra boxes would arrive, several of them holding items Harry was sure he’d told Malfoy he didn’t want.
Dumbledore opened the door, and Ron jumped out of his bed, sweaty. “Professor Dumbledore!” he squeaked.
“I will not take those potions for the last time Remus!” Uncle Sirius yelled. “We agreed on this, agreed. You would use the potions, you would carry our child! We agreed to this!”
“Yes, I will, however, that can be a problem to worry about another day,” Voldemort said. “The Dark Lord still has work to do, as does Tom Riddle. You two, meanwhile, must stay vigilant! Do you understand?”
As expected people did watch. Everyone they passed stopped and turned to watch the Potter twins walk down the cobblestone street, Sirius gently guiding them towards a store at the end called Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Niall growled under his breath when some started to follow them, and Harry stepped closer to his twin as they entered the store. Thankfully, it was empty and the two were hurried onto small stools to be measured. Half an hour later, the boys came out with plain black robes that fitted them perfectly with a promise that once they are sorted, their robes will be changed to have their House crest and colors.
“Greyback… where are you?” Harry demanded. He pulled out his wand and started to turn around, his eyes narrowing.
“Oh wonderful,” Blaise purred, and Harry started to lead them out of the classroom. “I’ve bet you already learned of many wonderful things, haven’t you?”
“I… I—yes my lord,” Mr. Malfoy said. He gave a stiff bow and left the room. Voldemort chuckled and turned to the sound of heavy hissing,
“Relax mortal, sheesh you’re gone for a few thousand years and suddenly everyone is paranoid,” Loki grumbled. He rolled his eyes and looked at Harry, “But you! You look too glum on your wedding day! Come on, come on, smile! Your god demands it!”
Harry felt that his face could not go redder as Goyle stood up to help the girl with her luggage. “I’ll tell you later when Draco comes in,” he muttered. He looked at the girl for a long moment, “You’re Greengrass,” he pointed out.
stared at Niall. Niall whined and took Harry’s hand, kissing the words softly and rubbed it against his scent glands. “What are we going to do?” Harry asked. He took Niall’s hand and rubbed the scarred words on it against his own glands.
Panic immediately flared in their eyes. “We cannot do that! Mistress Malfoy told us that we have to keep the garden clean!”
“Harry’s right,” Blaise said, “After my talk with my grandfather, I’ve taken all precautions I can to make sure that Harry is safe.”
“About one in the morning, I think,” Harry said. He looked at his friend clearly. The Alpha really looked different. He was taller, naturally, but his body swelled with muscles just like Draco’s. However unlike Draco, Ron looked bigger, his muscles much more bulging and developed. He grinned and flexed his arms. “Charlie’s been teaching me,” he said. “But never mind that, how was it?”
Ron growled angrily and grabbed his head, trying to find some way to let out his anger and frustration. He went with punching Harry’s bed before falling on it. He looked at Harry and spoke with a seriousness that Harry never saw before. “She’s putting this thing called ‘Alpha Protein’ into your food. It’s this potion that only Alphas can use normally. As you saw, it made my scent overpowering and made me feel incredibly horny. If a Beta has it, they feel stronger for a bit, yeah, but the crash is hard on them. However if an Omega constantly eats it, bad things happen. First, you get really sick like you have. The potion has been damaging your womb, Harry. If you kept drinking it you’ll have Alpha-like qualities as long as you drink it but, you won’t be able to have kids, and even worse, you might die.”
“Yeah,” Draco nodded, “I have no idea what this means, but it could explain our attraction to each other, not counting how hot both of us obviously are.” He chuckled and turned up, kissing Harry’s cheek. The Gryffindor smiled and blushed lightly. “And it helps that we both had crushes on the other,” he added.
He wanted to feel sick, he wanted to feel revolted and throw his wand down, screaming that he will never hurt a man. But instead, Harry found himself raising his wand, aiming it at the man and from his lips spilled out, “
Harry found his claws hard to work with as he tried his best to unbutton Draco’s shirt. The Slytherin laughed several times as his claws slipped, and the buttons fell from his grip. Frustration and need growing, Harry gave out a needy growl, and swiped his hands, tearing marks in his Alpha’s shirt. “Harry!” Draco yelled out. The omega flinched and fold into himself as Draco took off his shirt, examining the claw marks. “You reckless omega,” Draco growled. He moved past Harry to the bed his pants and shoes still on.
He followed the couple downstairs where his mother shrieked and hugged him tightly, “My Viktor!” she shrieked before babbling in Bulgarian.
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down the room, noticing briefly that Hedwig was in it, looking scared in her cage at Harry. Finally, he dropped back in his chair, leaned over his letter. There was a long pause.
He took Draco’s wand looked around for the perfect flowers that will get his message across. First, he went to the roses, looking at the various colors and beautiful shades. “Did you know that flowers have meaning?” he asked Draco.
“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.”
“No they didn’t and it was interesting,” Harry smiled. “Draco’s friends seemed nice—and I got Crabbe and Goyle to promise to stop bullying people. Though I don’t know if they’ll keep their word.”
Draco slowly fucked Harry’s mouth, moving Harry’s head like a sex toy as both just moaned. Pressure build in Draco’s balls and cock steadily, and he increased the pace of their movements until without warning, he pushed Harry against his body, burying his cock as far down Harry’s throat as he could while Harry’s senses were overwhelmed by his pubes and smell. Draco came, rope after rope of thick cum shooting down Harry’s throat, filling quickly and forcing the teen to swallow quickly as his throat tightened against Draco’s cock. “Fuck yes,” Draco groaned, pulling his cock out until only a couple inches were still in Harry’s mouth, which he filled with cum. “Swallow it all or I won’t fuck you, omega!” he ordered.
“And you will die,” Harry said, “once all of your Horcruxes are gone your soul will have nowhere to run. You will fizzle out of existence.” He turned and pocketed the vial before pouring himself tea. He glanced behind him and saw that the Dark Lord was not moving, a cold, amused smile gracing his face.
“I’ll explain later,” Niall muttered. “But Remus told me about it. Now eat your food! I made it all by myself.”
“Then why don’t you show me Dumbledore’s receipts?” Voldemort asked. “It is your civil duty, after all, the man has been feeding them to my son, an Omega, without anyone knowing.”
“I guess so, Alpha,” Harry mewled. He looked at the three then back at Draco. He decided that it would be better to tell Draco about the food when they were alone. Instead, he turned to the three friends and decided that he wanted to know them more. Relaxing against his Alpha, he pulled Draco’s free hand onto his lap and played with it as he talked with Blaise, Theo, and Daphne.
Mrs. Lestrange gave them an unusual task. The paired all spread out around the room and were simply ordered to “attack your partner” while the partner “defends.” The first five minutes was spent with the pairs looking around awkwardly, talking with one another on how exactly they were supposed to attack and defend. Blaise looked around to see that Mrs. Lestrange was back on the walls, writing her strange writings, and went to whisper to Ron. The redhead looked a little confused, but as Harry watched, he saw that Ron started moving his wrists and had his fists clenched as though he was holding something. His lips were moving, and a moment later, much to his and Harry’s surprise, a clear shield appeared in his hands! It lasted for a while until Ron moved his hands and it disappeared in a sparkling effect. Blaise cheered him on, and the redhead blushed.
“Oh just fuck off,” Harry scoffed. “I’m not dealing with this tonight.” He took his pajamas and changed, closing his bed curtains, and sticking them close with a spell. Feeling angry and betrayed by everyone, he just laid there for hours on end. He heard the others go to bed one by one, but still couldn’t sleep. There was a strange noise and looked down to see a mass moving in his bed towards him. It hissed and licked his body and a moment later, Nagini appeared from under the covers.
Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.
Ron looked at Harry, confused, but the Omega just shrugged. “He’s a good one,” Harry said. “Come on, let’s get to the common room.”
“Just let me work. Two weeks, that’s all I want,” Harry said, turning away from his brother. “I’ll see you in class.” And he left before Niall could stop him.
The quill dragged along Goyle’s hand, leaving a red mark in it’s trace. Draco continued to write the sentence over and over, watching as the red mark grew deeper and deeper until it barely started bleeding. “There, that should be enough,” Draco said.
“Don’t see why though, Potter’s supposedly a loose whore,” Bellatrix Lestrange laughed. “I bet nobody would want to touch that little rut.”
“Good boys,” Blaise said approvingly. “Now… I want to start with saying where magic actually comes from. I’ve talked about this before a little, mentioning the deities. They are actually a single group of mystical beings who are known to all civilizations through different names. All the ancient mythologies you’ve heard and read about? They are all about the same group of deities. So, to make things easier for ourselves, I’ll allow you boys to choose the mythology so we can refer to them by name.”
“Cool,” Ron nodded, “Then we should share some classes maybe, I still have some general classes to do.” He grinned and Draco shrugged, “Maybe, here’s my schedule.” He pulled his phone out and pulled up the screenshot of his schedule. He handed it to Ron, who read it eagerly. “SCORE!” he screamed, causing Draco to flinch and look around embarrassed as people turned to stare at the idiot who dared to ruin their quiet morning. “We got British Literature and Intro to Science together!” he grinned, “Harry’s in both of them too!”
“You might actually enjoy yourself, Ron,” Hermione said. Harry nodded in agreement. “Anyway,” he said, “I just came over to tell you guys about the meeting. I’m actually going to spend the rest of the day and night with Draco. I’ll be eating with him as well.”
Voldemort snickered at this and turned back to the mirror. He took his wand out from his old robes and with precise movements, his hair started to snip itself away as invisible scissors started to groom the old man. “This was the body that seduced many men and woman, Harry, including my Black,” Voldemort said with a hint of nostalgia. “Hard for you to imagine, yes, but you will see why soon enough, my apprentice.”
“Yeah, okay,” Harry nodded. Hermione left after Ginny and Ron stepped up to Harry, shaking his head as he leaned against Harry. “That was tactless, mate,” he said.
“Great not you too,” Ginny muttered, “God are all the boys here so stupid over a pretty lady?” The trio glanced awkward looks. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Harry shook his head. “What? Did I say something?” Ginny asked.
“I know,” Harry said. “I know, this is like a long term thing I want to work for, for after the war, you know? Something to look forward to.”
George ran off to get the camera while Fred placed the letter down on a bed. He began pushing stuff out of the way so they would have some more room to pose for their new boyfriend. George came back with the camera to see his brother already naked. “Got it,” he smiled, closing and locking the door.
“So then, why are you here?” Lilith asked. “I’ve my own plans if I were you, but you are not as much as an… opportunist like me.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded, feeling a little relieved. The three went in and with his two best friends with him, Harry found that it was a little easier to forget about rumors and whisperings around him. They sat down in their usual spot, only for Neville to approach them cautiously, rubbing the back of his head. “Hello, uhm Harry, is it alright if we talk?” he asked.
“True, true,” Voldemort nodded. “Ahh, what is it my dear Nagini said? Ah yes, ‘Harry is such an interesting little snake. He smells like Master and is being treated worse than house-elves. Fat Muggles make him cry.’ Now is that true, Harry, are fat muggles really making you cry?” He smirked, clearly amused in this situation.
Voldemort felt a string of concern rise up inside him, but Remus’s smile eased the Alpha back into his chair. Remus finished setting the table and soon had their dinner spread out, and a bottle of wine chilled. He took a breath and looked at Tom. “I had a test done while you were away, Molly helped me with it, and though it’s early, I do know that, well, I’m pregnant.”
“Right, well…” Lilith stared at her arm then over her shoulder again, “Speaking of our Lord, he seems to have a word with me now. I will see you then, Bellatrix, and don’t worry, play nice and mommy might put a good word in for you. “She slipped over the balcony and out of Bellatrix’s view. The woman heard the sound of a fire bursting into existence for a moment before extinguishing itself. She did not have time to wonder or worry why the Dark Lord called on Lilith, however, as Bellatrix only had one true goal that encompassed her very being.
“Of course boyfriend,” Harry smiled and they stopped in the middle of the hallway to compare notes. Students passed them and Harry couldn’t help but feel their gaze on him and his hand.
His hands hooked around the edge of Draco’s underwear and Harry looked up at Draco, silently asking for permission. Draco nodded and Harry pulled down his underwear, releasing Draco’s cock.
And with that, the Dark Lord moved passed Harry, not even giving the boy a glance back. Alone in the basement, Harry walked around for a couple minutes before an idea came to him. He was going to find Draco.
“Some solicitor or helper,” Harry shrugged. “He claims to help Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus getting pregnant… someone sent him and…” He sighed, “if he can help, I sincerely hope he does. They want a child so bad.”
A sleepy, hazy, lazy relaxation fell on the three of them as before they knew it, a full month and a half passed by with not plotting, no mysteries, or any real development. It was December, snow was starting to fall gently from the sky, and that was when Harry’s skill was tested, and his life almost stolen. An unfortunate harshness that begin, quite simply and uneventfully, with the dull electronic chime of a doorbell.
“Good. You three are dismissed,” Voldemort said, dropping Bellatrix’s hair. He looked at Lucius and Yaxley. He waited until the Lestranges left before addressing Yaxley. “I need men to stake out a muggle home. My son was forced to live there for sixteen years by Dumbledore. He mentions always feeling weak while living there. Knowing the old man, he most likely added a charm to any and all barriers he placed on the house. The address is Number 4 Privet Drive in Surrey. I want results tomorrow by the latest or else.”
“Of course, yes,” Mrs. Weasley said. Everyone stood up, the room full of the scrapping of chairs being pushed in. Mrs. Weasley led the small army of adults of the kitchen basement and up the few sets of stairs, quiet and softly so as not to wake the portraits, until they were in front of Harry’s room.
“Of course you read thoughts,” Harry gritted out. The cut was now five inches long, going down his arm. The pain was immense and Harry screamed and whimpered as he blood drained out of the cut, along his arm and dripped down into the cauldron.
“Yeah, yeah I’m fine,” Harry said, draining Ron’s goblet and clearing his throat. “Ron, I’m sorry but—”
Draco was in Theo’s room. He felt a mixture of guilt and sadness as he held his friend, who was sobbing into him, holding Draco’s clothes tightly. “We did nothing wrong,” Theo cried. “We did nothing… nothing to make
“No matter,” Professor McGonagall sighed. “Now, what is this poisoning you are talking about? You are referring to the Alpha Protein?”
He read the instructions, first he had to mince the flowers he brought and mixed them with the venom, where it must be carefully brewed over ten days, each day adding a different venom.
