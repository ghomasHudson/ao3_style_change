Harry sighed. He could feel Hermione’s eyes boring through the back of his head, refused to turn back, to see the judgement of Mar he knew must be on their faces. He focused on Mar, who was hitting her leg now, with the bottom of her fist. Not hard enough to hurt, but he was worried, a bit.
As it turned out, finding Ron and Hermione was a relatively fruitless endeavour. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t find them, they were seated in the middle of the common room. It was more that they were surrounded on all sides by people who had missed them and wanted to catch up. Harry didn’t begrudge them that, not really, in the Days Before he would have joined. But now – well, no one liked him now, that was part of it – he was too shaken from his nightmare to handle a crowd of that size.
“You had a choice,” he said, gently. “You and Ron, from the beginning. Not like me and Draco. And I am so grateful that you chose to be my friend and to follow me even when I didn’t want you to.”
“Neither could we,” Pansy said, after a moment of silence. “Nor did any of those tosspots,” she meant the Gryffindors who had been at the castle, he knew. “And they
he wanted a cigarette.
She turned kind eyes on him. “It’ll be alright, Harry. Teddy and I will visit.” She squeezed his shoulder as he moved through the kitchen towards his bedroom.
Harry watched Pansy and Blaise exchange exasperated looks. “One day,” Harry said, “I’m going to introduce you to a Walkman. Or noise-cancelling headphones.”
“Thwarted by a shadow,” Harry said quietly.

Harry grinned. “Wingardium Leviosa,” he said. “My first day in Charms. And then Ron used it to defeat the mountain troll.”
thank you for the comments and kudos. i will respond as soon as I have the time <3
Ron scoffed – actually scoffed. Hermione looked almost frightened, but she would back Ron up no matter what came out of his mouth, Harry knew. “You were also fucking him long before we came back to Hogwarts,” Ron said, finally. “Or did you think we’ve forgotten?”
“And Flitwick, and Sprout, and Slughorn…” Draco sighed. “It was a lot of tea.”

And was interrrupted by a shriek. “
“Did you go out of your way to hurt kids? All those first years?”
The minute they entered the common room Harry was accosted by the first year Slytherins, led by Mar, scampering around them and begging to know what happened. He refused to explain to them, but reassured them that yes he was alright and yes he would still be teaching History of Magic the next day. Eventually they left him alone, and the rest of the common room seemed confident that he was alright once he had answered all the rapid-fire first year questions and complimented Mar’s haircut, so they were left in relative silence, the four of them.
Harry measured his next words very carefully. He could feel Hermione, especially, watching him, sure she was picking up on his tension even if she wouldn’t say it. “What exactly did Mary say to you, Mar?” he asked gently. The girl was practically bouncing in excitement, flapping her arms and smiling widely. Her movements slowed when he spoke, though, as if sensing Harry was worried.
“Listen, Blaise, this is important. They’re going to assign people to houses that
The brutality at Hogwarts opened up my eyes to something that has been essential to me, recently. The Carrows did not care about who they hurt. The Slytherins were the most accessible to them; there was no one to stand up for us – and that’s alright, I understand, really, why everyone believed we got preferential treatment. Why everyone believed we were evil. Some of us were – some of us are. I had to watch my best friend hurt children – and enjoy it. That is neither here nor there, nor is it an excuse. I will stop dithering again.
Andromeda tsked. She and Harry had discussed Draco and Narcissa’s situation at length many times, and he knew she didn’t approve of the treatment of her sister or her nephew. “A complete shame they’re keeping you separate,” she said, lips pursed. “As if you’d be a threat.” He saw Draco give her a small smile. “If you need anything, you write me. Understand?”
“Don’t act like you were the only ones who suffered,” Pansy continued angrily. “Don’t act like you’re so righteous. What happned last year, Longbottom? I’ll tell you. You and your cronies painted some stupid graffiti, acted like it was the most rebellious thing in the world. Then Corner got hurt and what happened? You
Harry sat up, felt his eyebrows furrow. “Come on,” he said finally, standing up and grabbing both their shirts off the floor. He headed down the hall towards his room, pausing to place the monitoring spell on Teddy’s room along the way. He didn’t wait to see if Draco would follow – knew he would. In the Days Before, Harry never would have been so bold.
but as Draco dropped to his knees all coherent thought left Harry’s mind. In mere moments it was all he could do to stay on his feet, and if it weren’t for both his hands bracing on Draco’s shoulders he would have collapsed. His panting was cut off by a frustrated groan when Draco stood suddenly.
“Potter is going to kill you,” he sighed, but allowed Draco to lean against him.
“They can be quite meddlesome,” she said, with a tilt of her head. “Now, what would you like to know?”
“There are solutions,” Pansy said. She paused a moment, twirling her hair as she thought. There were prominent bags under her eyes – Harry knew from Blaise that she’d been having especially bad nightmares. But of course, there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. They had taken to shifting their sleeping arrangements – Harry with Draco and Pansy in Harry’s bed instead. It wasn’t as though Hermione was horrible to Pansy, but she felt safer with Blaise. And Harry couldn’t complain – he was, of course, more than happy to stay with Draco.
She stepped down from the podium as the bustle of hundreds of moving students filled the Hall. Harry sat up slowly, cradling Teddy to his chest. The boy had begun to stir and whimper quietly.
“I may have told them I’d hold onto your wand, and Zabini’s, too.” He placed his two friends’ wands down on Draco’s desk, trying not to laugh at the shocked look on Pansy’s face.
“You’re awake?” came Andromeda’s voice again. She was beside him, then, glasses in hand. “How are you feeling?” she asked as he put his glasses on.
“As much as I would love to hear about your summer,” the Weasel – Weasley, Draco corrected himself – began, his voice full of hostility, “we should just establish that I don’t like any of you and I don’t trust any of you.” Draco felt Weasley’s eyes rest on him. “You’re a Death Eater,” he spat out. Draco looked up in shock, but Weasley had already turned to Pansy. “You tried to give Harry to Voldemort,” and then to Blaise, “And you’re just a self-righteous pure-blooded twat.”
to become a parent to her grandson. And with Harry gone…he tried not to feel guilty, because of course he should have come back to Hogwarts, but he did. If only he could have delayed a couple years, waited until Teddy was older, and then come back; it would be easier on Andy to care for an older child. It could have been possible, too, if he were anyone other than, well, the
Harry shrugged. “I thought that’s what I wanted,” he said. And it was, too. In the Days Before, that had been his goal. But now he had lived through a war, and more fighting was the last thing that he had wanted.
“Library or common room?” Pansy asked. Harry hoped it wasn’t the library – if he had to spend any more time in there his brain would start leaking out his ears, he was sure.
“That’s what I thought,” Blaise said savagely.
Technically he couldn’t write such a note – he wasn’t fully staff, but he doubted any of the teachers would begrudge him. “If you find any first years or second years in other houses that aren’t doing work, take them too,” he said.
“Well, I think this year we’ll talk about some big wizarding history events that happened in the last fifty years. We’ll talk about Grindlewald and Voldemort,” some of the students shuddered at the name, but he chose to ignore it, “and how those wars affected us and the muggles. We’ll also talk about the founding of Hogwarts a little bit. Those are the big things. Some of you will know a lot about these things already,” he cast his gaze across the room, trying to make eye contact with all of his students. All except Mar. “Lots of you won’t. So if you know some stuff already, I want to see you helping the people who don’t, okay?”
“I like water,” Mar said. “Can you see the water from the common room?”
Pansy snorted from the other side of the room. “So you just stared at it for an hour?” she asked in amusement. Harry just made a face at her – mostly because she wasn’t wrong.
There was a crowd already at the door to the potions classroom when they arrived. Professor Stone, the new professor, was standing next to the door that was closed behind her. Harry and Draco followed Pansy and Blaise to the edge of the group. Ron and Hermione weren’t far in front of them, but they were standing with Neville, Dean, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t bother to even think about approaching.
“Here,” Draco whispered in response before dropping to his knees. “Take your tie off,” commanded Draco as he began working on the buttons to Harry’s trousers. Shaking with desire, Harry complied.
Pansy gave him a long-suffering look. “I will be outside your door for five minutes, then I’m coming back in and dragging you out, whether you like it or not.”
Andromeda just shook her head, looking exasperated. “Start with that, then. Something simple that has fond memories. It may not go well at first, but you’ll be able to work on your control. And your trust.”
“-can’t just walk him out with other people around,” she said as he came to. He felt around for his glasses, accidentally smacking Draco on the nose as he did so. The other boy, who was already awake, huffed out an exasperated “Potter!” before handing Harry his glasses.
Mar ran forward and, much to Harry’s amusement, flung her arms around Pansy. “Can you show me now?” she asked eagerly.
“Mar,” he said as gently as he could. “Do you know what sarcasm is?”
“Dyke?” Asked Mar, still hitting her leg.
“Look,” Blaise sighed from his other side. “There are people who are beyond forgiving, mate. Your father, for one. People like Vince and Greg, probably,” Draco felt a dull pang at their names, and Pansy’s hand stilled for a moment before continuing its motions in his hair. It wasn’t Blaise’s fault for briging them up, really. Blaise hadn’t been friends with them, nor Draco, for the most part. He had always considered wizarding politics beneath him, had never been shy about his hatred for the Dark Lord
Harry felt a smile blooming on his face. “Like it long, hm?” he asked, and began giggling in a quite un-Harry like way. There was no reason, really, except that he was happy to be out of the Hospital Wing and grateful to be here with Draco being treated like a prince.
Harry woke, hours later, groggy, confused, and mildly panicky when he realized Draco wasn’t in the bed. He only had a few seconds to panic, however, before Draco came out of the bathroom, hair damp but freshly dressed. When he saw Harry was awake, he grinned.
I believe the first thing I learned about was chemistry. I think she knew I would like it, given my affinity for potions. Did you know muggles can do with ordinary ingredients and no magic what we do with potions? She taught me about muggle universities after that, when I expressed interest. Did you know the ministry has a branch that prepares wizards for muggle universities from Hogwarts? I will never get to go that route, I know the ministry would not help me in that endeavour. But it is something I consider. Professor Strickland has been helpful.
“You’re not upset?” Harry asked, incredulous. He would be upset if his movements were being tracked, spells monitored, conversations listened to.
“What happened, anyway?” he asked, turning back to Andromeda. “I remember fighting with Ron and Hermione…” he trailed off with a sigh.
He did his best to change the topic. “I think Andromeda is bringing Teddy this weekend,” he said. “For the whole weekend.”
“All right, Hermione?” He asked before he could stop himself. Before he could think better of it he moved towards her, placing a hand on her back.
“Tell me about your nightmare,” Draco said, and Harry found himself complying as Draco’s hands moved again – across his chest, through his hair, under his chin.
thanks for all the kudos and reviews, lovely humans <3
And then she bustled out, leaving Harry to slouch against the wall until his head hit it with a thump and Madame Pomfrey to give him a pitying look.
“Alright,” Hermione responded primly. Harry grabbed a jumper off his bed-post before gently closing the door behind him and following his sort-of friends into the corridor.
His chest felt tight, and he almost wanted to cry, but couldn’t place the exact reason. Because Pansy was upset with him? That wasn’t it, not exactly. It was as though the sounds of the dining hall had amplified around him, too – and they were different, this year. The chatter was subdued, voices tinged with worry and fear. Harry felt it in the core of himself.
“The rest of them don’t have an excuse,” said Ginny, with what Harry could only describe as a sarcastic laugh. “They’re just pricks.” She had raised her voice at the end of what she was saying as Seamus walked past them. He shot a nasty look in her direction, but didn’t comment further – probably because Professor Stone had just walked by to collect their sample.
Harry just shook his head. “We were supposed to straight to see them. And Pansy knows when we’ve been snogging, Draco. She always knows.”
Harry pointedly ignored him. “I have twenty-eight students in my first year class. Three of them can’t write – at all. They’re eleven!” He sighed. “How does a child grow up for eleven years and not learn how to write a proper sentence?”
“Um-”
Slowly, Draco removed his hands from Harry’s hair; he looked like he was quivering with the effort. He took Harry’s hands and guided him to his feet, pulling him in close for a kiss.
She nodded at him, but he frowned. He felt guilty – more than guilty. He should have known Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have taken well to being forced into a conversation with Pansy, Blaise and Draco in their first moments back. Harry had been here all summer to watch Draco learn and change, had been here all summer to learn and change himself. His best friends had not.
“Me and Harry, Professor,” said the voice – Harry now recognized it as Ginny’s. “And Luna and Mal- Draco.”
like the moon
Harry let his hands move, skimming Draco’s calves, his thighs, dancing along the skin above the waistline of his pants. “I feel like,” Harry began. He stopped, gathered his thoughts, leaned into Draco’s touch on his chest. “Death follows me,” he said, almost sighed. “I dreamed that I went through the veil. You were there, you all were; you needed my help and I left. I just left.”
Before he could say anything else, before he could pull himself back or force himself back into the world, McGonagall was standing at the dais. Draco’s hand had made it’s way to his knee under the table; it grounded him a little bit. He could even feel Ron and Hermione casting him worried looks from their spot with the Gryffindors on the other side of the table. He let out a slow breath as McGonagall began speaking.
“What’s going on?” he asked, once he felt more oriented. Pansy was sitting up on his left, glaring at Blaise, who was standing over her. Draco was still curled up beside Harry, their legs tangled underneath the bedsheets. Ahh DS Ah FHalf of him wanted to stay like this all day.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the History of Magic classroom, there was already a gaggle of first years waiting outside. He let them in, trying not to sigh too loudly. He was excited, sure, and yes, they were eager and adorable, but if he had to go through a year of hero worship from all the students he was teaching, he wasn’t really sure how he’d manage.
“Where are you?” Draco whispered finally, after silence that had stretched out endlessly. “You’re so far away today.”
“The holidays will be soon,” Andy said gently. “I’ll come through with you. If Minerva is there we can talk to her together. I daresay it may save you some trouble given that you left school grounds without permission.”
It wasn’t so surprising, not really. They had been children, raised for similar purposes, maybe, just on opposite sides of a war.
“And that upset you,” Andromeda said, watching him over the rim of her teacup.
people who could ever possibly exist.” She spat out the word forgiving as if it was an inuslt. It was, in a way, given how they had all been raised.
Pansy had been expressly forbidden from telling anyone about who the new Defence professor was, but she absolutely gushed about him at every possible opportunity. Blaise was not enjoying Arithmancy with Professor Vector, and he made sure everyone knew it. Mostly, he had been stuck tutoring Harry, so Harry, at least, didn’t really blame him.
“So…how was everyone’s summer?” Granger finally asked in such a false cheerful tone it made Draco cringe.
“So did Draco,” Harry sighed. “And I’d say Draco probably has a lot less to apologize for than Dumbledore ever did.”
Briefly, Harry wanted to argue. In the Days Before he would have, woudln’t have liked the implication that he was weak or afraid. Now, though, he thought about how he posed a danger for Teddy with his outbursts. How he almost hurt Ron and Hermione, but turned the magic inward on himself instead. How he was afraid for Draco because the other boy couldn’t carry a wand.
Everyone was changed, but he knew what he thought it would be like – curtains pulled around their four-poster beds, silencing spells casted, grief dealt with quietly, screaming from nightmares hushed. When he looked at the three of them – which he didn’t often, hurt as he was by their behaviour – he imagined that his guesses weren’t far off. They often looked drawn and tired. Then again, they had more horrendous memories here than he ever had, really. Nothing he had experienced could amount to the seventh year they had spent here.
And then Draco was pressing him against the wall and his mouth was parting Harry’s, his tongue gently prodding, his hands roaming Harry’s body as if making sure he was all in one piece. They parted slowly, Harry unable to disguise his heavy breathing. He reached out as Draco leaned back, hand going to the other boys’ hair to push it behind his ear and out of his face.
“I have my moments,” Harry responded in an imitation of Blaise’s arrogant tones. “They’ll probably just yell a lot,” he said, more normally this time.
“And even when you
Blaise, to his credit, inclined his head slightly in Harry’s direction, although his eyes still hadn’t left the group before him.
I was resistant. McGonagall told me that she would not sign off on my parole unless I took tea with her daily. At first we took tea in the Headmistress’ office – the portraits are quite distracting, so then we took tea in the kitchens. It was a small start and I felt like I was held positively captive, more than I was physically, with the threat of my parole looming above my head. If I refused to speak, answer questions, be cooperative, she would remind me of her next meeting with my parole officer.
“Oh,” she said, between sniffs. “Harry. What are you doing here?”
They fell silent, looking at each other over the desk. Minerva was the first to break, looking down at her clasped hands and away from Harry’s face.
He caught a startled look from Draco as Andromeda wrapped him into a hug. She hadn’t been brought up to be particularly warm, Harry knew, and Draco may have expected the traditional Black aloofness in her. But she couldn’t have raised a daughter like Tonks without learning how to be warm.
Then of course, we heard about Gringotts (well done on the dragon) and we were off to Hogwarts shortly after. Our only instructions were “do not kill Harry Potter.” It did not matter to me, really, provided that if I was alive by the end of everything there was a damn good reason for it.
“I’ll write a list of topics,” he said finally. “Everyone can pick one. But I’m not giving you answers or helping you do the research.”
“For Merlin’s sake,” groused Draco. Harry watched with satisfaction as he threw down his quill and spun in his chair. Draco’s face was flushed, and his eyes dark, but not, Harry noted, with anger. With something else.
tw for a homophobic slur
“To brood,” Harry confirmed solemnly.
Harry pocketed the Maruader’s Map as he pet the dog painting that led to Draco’s room. He hadn’t necesssarily been lying when he said he knew where Pansy had gone – it just wasn’t exactly the truth, either.
“I never realized magic was so technical,” was all Harry could think to say. “I didn’t think you could lose it.”
“Sure,” she said. They both stood up, Pansy with a small smile on her lips. “But lets find the other two, first, make sure no one’s resorted to fist-fighting instead of wands.”
Harry slapped himself mentally for not realizing sooner – for not realizing last night, even. Draco was expressly forbidden from sharing sleeping quarters with other students; and while there was probably nothing technically wrong with him staying the night in Blaise and Harry’s room, there were also too many people itching to see him expelled.
So he stood there and stroked Draco’s hair instead, clumsily kissing the side of his head until they other boy was able to straighten and look at him again.
She stopped and watched them expectantly – it took the group a moment to realize that she was dismissing them to choose their partners. Harry looked at Draco, feeling panicky all at once. He wasn’t okay with this – hadn’t expected it, couldn’t deal with changes from his expectations or routines right now. His breath was coming shakily and he flinched when Pansy reached toward him. The world was darkening, the only steady presence was Draco’s hand in his.
It wasn’t until she had swooped forward and wrapped him in a hug that he realized he had been crying, tear tracks tracing their way down his face and into the soft cashmere of her jumper. A wail sounded from down the hall.
“Ron misses you,” she said angrily, as if it were somehow his fault. “And he thinks we should make up with you but you don’t - neither of you-” she let out another great gasping sob. A pit of guilt sunk in Harry’s stomach.
“I know,” he whispered back. “I’m sorry.”
Harry turned an amused look downward to where Draco was lying. “I do?” he asked pointedly. Draco merely smiled innocently at him.
“That’s not a bad idea,” Harry said after a moment of thought.
bed – he was at Hogwarts and –
Harry thougth for a moment. He had kept in touch with precious few people after the war, preferring to let the world go on its way without him. “Ron and Hermione, of course,” he said. “Most of the rest of us. Neville, Dean, Seamus. Lavender won’t be back, nor the Patils. I supposed Hermione will be the only Gryffindor girl. Hannah Abbot will be back in Hufflepuff, and I heard Ernie and Justin will be back. Ravenclaw will have Michael Corner, I’m sure.” Draco made a nosie of discontent, which made Harry grin.
There was the combination of grumbles and explanations of glee around the table, which made Harry snort. Slytherins were a testy bunch, honestly.
“You’re actually daft,” Blaise said. Draco could hear the false amazement in his voice, the mocking tone. His friend’s face was hardened, looked almost impassive but Draco knew that for Blaise, that meant he was angry.
Ron scoffed – actually scoffed. Hermione looked almost frightened, but she would back Ron up no matter what came out of his mouth, Harry knew. “You were also fucking him long before we came back to Hogwarts,” Ron said, finally. “Or did you think we’ve forgotten?”
They stood together and parted ways at the door to the Great Hall, Pansy and Blaise heading outside and Draco and Harry turning left towards the Owlrey.
– Neville could have been him, could have been the one targeted by Voldemort, the one who had to die. It could have always been like this, Harry in Slytherin with Draco and Pansy and Blaise, and Neville tromping around the castle and getting into trouble with Ron and Hermione. It felt
“It is,” she said instead.
Harry sighed when every single head at the table turned toward him for advice. “I’ll handle it,” he said dully. They all seemed pleased by the answer. Wankers, the lot of them.
They weren’t as early as they had thought. When they arrived in the Great Hall – which housed just a small table that the professors and students sat around together, most of their year was already there. Neville tried to smile at Harry as they walked in, but Harry tactfully ignored him and followed Blaise to seats at the opposite end to everyone else.
She nodded at him, but he frowned. He felt guilty – more than guilty. He should have known Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have taken well to being forced into a conversation with Pansy, Blaise and Draco in their first moments back. Harry had been here all summer to watch Draco learn and change, had been here all summer to learn and chagne himself. His best friends had not.
Draco smiled. Just a small smile, but it was there. “Hardly,” he said back, almost a quip. “You have a very obnoxious habit of getting out of difficult situations.”
“Didn’t kill anyone,” he finally said.
She didn’t, thankfully. “It appears as though your magic, unstable as it has become, reacted to your emotions during your argument. It exploded, in a manner of speaking.”
“Before you exploded?” Pansy asked with a small smirk.
He was shaken out of his spiralling thought process by McGonagall stepping up to the podium. Teddy had fallen asleep in his arms at some point during dinner and Harry bundled him close, reluctant to acknowledge that he’d have to let the boy go soon. Perhaps tomorrow he could speak to the Headmistress about spending some weekends at home with Teddy. Draco seemed to realize his distress, or maybe it was just good timing – he shifted on the bench so that Harry was leaning against his chest, rather than his side. Harry let himself relax into Draco as McGonagall began speaking.
. Fitting, all things considered.”
with them. Parkinson tried to hand you over to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
Draco nudged her back with a foot. “Stop it, you’re making Potter blush.”
Harry just swatted at his hand. “Do any of you pay attention to the Daily Prophet?” he asked suddenly. The question had been burning since Ron and Hermione had confronted him on Saturday, but by the time he had gotten out of the hospital wing he had lost the nerve to bring it up.
Harry couldn’t find it in himself to laugh, or push to the front the way he would have done in the Days Before. He didn’t understand, not really, how they could be cheerful, being back at Hogwarts. Every step, every turn he made, walking as a living person in a place where so many had died, felt like a slap to the face.
Andromeda knew that. The second part, though, was more upsetting. After all, it wasn’t as though Andy had
“You’re an arse, Harry Potter,” she said, finally. It felt almost a relief to Harry, to hear her say it out loud. “You’re an arse and Ron is an arse and your new friends are horrid and you just - you never think before you do things.”
“What is it?” Harry asked. Neville made a vague gesture at Draco, Blaise and Pansy, but Harry shook his head. “They stay.”
In the quiet of the forest, he breathed in the earthy air, pausing just to appreciate the
He couldn’t help but think, though, that perhaps the prejudices that had fed the war, that had already been in place, were as much the fault of those in the Hogwarts houses that constantly demonized Slytherins. Perhaps people became what you made them.
“Get the fuck out of our room,” he continued, as if Blaise hadn’t spoken.
“Smart girl,” Andromeda said approvingly. “Are any of your friends coming back, Draco?”
“What is it, then?” asked Draco, looking mildly alarmed. Harry didn’t blame him; Pansy looked particularly murderous.
“Turn around,” Draco growled, and how could he do anything else but listen when Draco spoke to him like that? He braced his forearms on the shower wall as Draco pushed a finger into him, and then two.
. And it was strange – they weren’t even inside the classroom yet, not even seated, but she was speaking as if they were.
Pansy smiled down at the girl and gently disentangled herself. “I’ll show you after dinner,” Pansy said. “Look, Professor Vector is handing out your timetables now. You don’t want to miss that.”
“Didn’t kill anyone,” he finally said.
“Potter now, is it?” Harry retorted. He located his shirt as well as a spare for Draco.
“Thanks,” Harry said, accepting them from her and putting them on his face. “Where’s Teddy?”
Across from where they were standing were two hallways. A crowd was clustered against the wall between the hallways. Harry assumed that was where the list of room assignments. He couldn’t find it in himself to care who he ended up with, particularly.
Dozens of hands were raised – all except for a couple of kids who were muggleborn and really, really didn’t do any extra reading. “Randy,” Harry said, pointing to a Hufflepuff boy at the back with his hand halfway up in the air.
She cast him a disparaging look. “Yes,” she said. Then, after a moment’s pause – “No.” Then “Yes,” again. She sighed. He took a moment to look at her – properly. She had cut her hair short over the summer – shorter than it had ever been. It now reached just to the bottom of her ears. She looked tired, the bags under her eyes more pronounced than he had ever seen them. But then again, wasn’t that true for them all?
“Nev,” he began, trying to come up with the words to say – trying to come up with a way to fix it, a way to apologize for not being the saviour they had needed. But he was interrupted.
She stormed across the room, but shut the door behind her with a soft click. Harry made a mental note to avoid ever making Pansy Parkinson angry at him. After a deep breath, he got out of bed and grabbed some clothes for the day.
“They’re always vague like this, here,” she said to him as gently as he’d ever heard her speak. “I don’t find it good practice to beat around the bushes with my students.”
“I’m not going to get any work done here,” Draco said with a huff. “Too small, not enough desks.”
“Did you go to your appointment at Mungo’s already?” Andy asked. He knew if he looked too closely she’d have that knowing look in her eyes - the kind of look only someone who was the mother of someone like Tonks could get.
Pansy hummed – thoughtfully or in agreement, Harry wasn’t sure.
“It’s to your shoulders when it’s wet,” he said instead. “You should keep growing it.”
“Well, do you believe all that drivel about blood supremacy now?” Blaise asked pointedly.
It made me realize, though, that for some people it was not about blood status or birth. It was simply about causing harm. How could I be part of that kind of a cause? It was the start, you could say, the start of the end. I feel as though I must reiterate, though, that I don’t believe this excuses me. I was guilty. I am guilty. I deserve consequences,

a reflection to write for their muggle studies seminar the previous evening. Perhaps Pansy would help him with that one.
When the Healer proceeded with the same examination the mediwtch had, humming and hawing and finally asking to speak to Madame Pomfrey in a separate room, though, that was when Harry lost it. It was possibly the first time he had felt angry since….well, since the Days Before, probably.
“Does it count as abuse of power if I don’t have any power to begin with?” Harry asked tiredly. Harry sat down at the table next to Draco, leaning into the other boy’s warmth. He was just too tired for this.
He was shaken out of his spiralling thought process by McGonagall stepping up to the podium. Teddy had fallen asleep in his arms at some point during dinner and Harry bundled him close, reluctant to acknowledge that he’d have to let the boy go soon. Perhaps tomorrow he could speak to the Headmistress about spending some weekends at home with Teddy. Draco seemed to realize his distress, or maybe it was just good timing – he shifted on the bench so that Harry was leaning against his chest, rather than his side. Harry let himself relax into Draco as McGonagall began speaking.
“What are you waiting for? We need to go.” Pansy spoke as if he were particularly daft. Given the time of morning, he probably was.
As he looked around the Slytherin table, mostly vacant as students piled around Pansy and Draco, Harry noticed a group of what was definitely first years all sitting closely together, about ten of them, it seemed. With a nervous glance at Pansy, who was still engrossed with the students surrounding her, he made his way over.
“I sleep better with the baby around,” Harry responded without really thinking. He was still trying to make sense of what was going on. He had become an early riser in the Days After, mostly thanks to Teddy’s sleep schedule and Andromeda’s insistence to be up at the crack of dawn with the kettle boiling, but this seemed excessive.
“I always pegged you for becoming an auror,” Pansy responded evenly.
It didn’t matter anymore, in the Days After, who liked him, who believed him. There was no one to save anymore,
She cast him a disparaging look. “Yes,” she said. Then, after a moment’s pause – “No.” Then “Yes,” again. She sighed. He took a moment to look at her – properly. She had cut her hair short over the summer – shorter than it had ever been. It now reached just to the bottom of her ears. She looked tired, the bags under her eyes more pronounced than he had ever seen them. But then again, wasn’t that true for them all?
“I sleep better with the baby around,” Harry responded without really thinking. He was still trying to make sense of what was going on. He had become an early riser in the Days After, mostly thanks to Teddy’s sleep schedule and Andromeda’s insistence to be up at the crack of dawn with the kettle boiling, but this seemed excessive.
he wanted to spend a meal with Teddy and of
At the same time, he knew it had been lenient – being confined to Hogwarts hadn’t been true punishment, not really, even if his only sources of conversation had been limited to McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn, before he left.
“Why don’t we go outside?” he asked after a moment of heavy silence. They followed him through the halls of the castle, toward the Entrance Hall. They weren’t talking, but he could feel them silently communicating with each other in that way they always did.
Really, this whole conversation was much above Harry’s non-existent paygrade. “Sometimes,” Harry settled on saying. “But it doesn’t bother us, because we know the things they say aren’t true.” He glanced back quickly at Ron and Hermione. Ron was looking tactfully down at his crossed legs. Hermione simply raised an eyebrow at him.
“No,” Draco said simply. He sighed again at Harry’s expectant look. “No, I don’t want to be tracked. But it’s not as though I’m doing anything illegal, there’s nothing they’ll find. And honestly, most of those bastards deserve to be tracked anyway.”
“You should let Pansy style your hair,” Draco said suddenly. “She’s quite good with hair trimming spells.”
Is this what it had been like in Slytherin, the past six years? Always waiting for conflict, striking before others could strike, unquestioningly doing what Draco said? Although in the past, Draco would never have asked anyone to stand down, Harry knew with certainty. Draco would have led the fight. Harry would never have stood down, either. Not in the Days Before. Nor would he have taken direction from anyone else like this.
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Blaise responded theatrically. “Don’t worry, Weasley was shafted with Smith. I’m sure you’ll hear so many stories it’ll be like you lived with him anyway.”
Your affable acquaintance,
“There’s a team of people,” he responded, hoping that was all he needed to say, but she just raised an eyebrow at him to continue. Harry sighed. “Well there’s me, of course. Professor McGonagall, Professor Strickland, one squib who works in muggle liaison for the Ministry of Magic and one wizard who works in the muggle government’s wizard liaison office. And Draco.”
“Malfoy?” Hermione asked calmly, almost too calmly.
“But when you have bad dreams, it feels like he’s still here, yeah?” Blaise finished for him. Harry nodded, to which Blaise side.
She didn’t, thankfully. “It appears as though your magic, unstable as it has become, reacted to your emotions during your argument. It exploded, in a manner of speaking.”
One of the seventh year prefects, a boy named Andrew, gave them a look when they approached. “We’re just deciding if we should tell the first years to get lost or not,” he said as they approached. “It’s become impossible to get work done.”
“Heard you exploded,” said a voice from across from him. He looked up to see a seventh year prefect, Michael, looking at him in amusement. The prefects Harry knew better – he and Pansy were often coordinating with them over patrols and the time they spent in the Slytherin common room.
“This is not the first time the wizarding world – or even the muggle world has gone through something like this,” she said carefully. “People will want to be careful, now more than ever before, that we prevent the same type of war from happening again.”
Dear Ron and Hermione,
Harry nodded numbly but managed to give her a small smile before his feet took him down the hall to Teddy’s room. The boy wasn’t so little anymore and he wasn’t crying anymore either - instead, he was kicking his legs in his crib, rotating his small body towards the door where Harry had entered.
Draco sighed beside him. “Are you nervous for Granger and Weasley to arrive tomorrow?”
“It’s the Welcome Feast tonight,” Draco continued as Harry sat up. “Andromeda and Teddy will be here.”
“I’d imagine,” Draco put in. “Now please be quiet.”
“I’m getting my hair cut!” she plopped down on the grass in front of him.
Her cackles were cut off abruptly as they saw the group of Gryffindor’s walking up from the entrance to the common room, which had somehow opened without them hearing. Potter looked like he was trying to hide a smile. Granger, on his left, was looking awkward, her lips turned into a frown. He was sure she was blushing, even if, like Potter, her skin was too dark for it to be visible. Weasley, however, was bright red, intently looking around the common room as if it was fascinating.
Draco snorted, and soon the four of them were all laughing, much to the horror of those seated around them. They probably looked mad, Harry thought, snickering on like idiots after such a dark warning.
“Can you disillusion yourself?” Blaise asked suddenly. “If you walk sort of – in-between us, I don’t think anyone will notice if you’re a bit fuzzy at the edges.”
“The four of them, really,” Draco sighed. “It’s not as though I have a choice, and I’ll still be in my own rooms.”
“You’re Potter whenever you’re annoying me,” he responded loftily. “Which is most of the time.”
The world felt bright and warm as they drifted into sleep. A thought chased its way through Harry’s mind.
“Get the fuck out of our room,” he continued, as if Blaise hadn’t spoken.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He was exhausted, now. “I’ll have to talk to Pansy about it.”
Harry measured his next words very carefully. He could feel Hermione, especially, watching him, sure she was picking up on his tension even if she wouldn’t say it. “What exactly did Mary say to you, Mar?” he asked gently. The girl was practically bouncing in excitement, flapping her arms and smiling widely. Her movements slowed when he spoke, though, as if sensing Harry was worried.
“It’s about how it’s framed, I think,” Harry said. “Not pro-Death Eater, but anti-government control over civilians. Somehow we have to make people see that this is an overstep – that it’s wrong.”
Pansy wrinkled her nose. “Did you really have that much tea with McGonagall?”
“What is it, then?” asked Draco, looking mildly alarmed. Harry didn’t blame him; Pansy looked particularly murderous.
“It’s okay if it bothers you, though,” he continued. “Sometimes mean things hurt.”
“Er- that’s great, Mar. Is Pansy doing it?”
“Surely that’s not how you’re supposed to do it,” came a drawl from behind him.
“Friendly seeming fellow,” Harry commented wrily as Draco fell in step beside him and they passed back through the wards together.
Hermione put her head on the table, cradled in her hands. She didn’t shake off the tentative hand that Harry put on her shoulders.
Draco was a bit fuzzy on the edges – since they were out of class he couldn’t cast the charm on himself. Harry couldn’t cast it, because – well, his magic was still unpredictable. And getting worse, it seemed, but he was trying not to dwell on it. So Pansy and Blaise had fought over whose disillusionment charm was better – a fight which Pansy ultimately won. Still, no one seemed to notice his slight edges as they ducked out of the common room.
“She said McGonagall’s choosing eight eighth year students to be assigned two to each Hogwarts house. We’re supposed to make sure the younger ones feel safe, and that the older ones don’t kill anyone, I suppose,” she sighed theatrically.
they were dead.
Andromeda just smiled and squeezed his hand. “You can’t put a timeline on these things, Harry.”
In fact, the more he looked, the more he realized that most of Slytherin had not vacated the Great Hall, especially the younger students. They seemed to all be waiting to speak with Pansy or Draco. There were even a couple young Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs waiting, although the absence of any Gryffindor students was notable. Harry felt a little bit out of his element – no,
And then Draco was pressing him against the wall and his mouth was parting Harry’s, his tongue gently prodding, his hands roaming Harry’s body as if making sure he was all in one piece. They parted slowly, Harry unable to disguise his heavy breathing. He reached out as Draco leaned back, hand going to the other boys’ hair to push it behind his ear and out of his face.
“You can start being a good influence on Ron, then,” she said, putting her arm around his waist to guide him out. “Imagine the kind of marks you can get now that you’re applying yourself.”
I learned plenty during the two months (and the rest of the summer) other than chemistry, of course. I have read – so much, more than I ever thought I would – muggle literature until it felt like my eyes would bleed. Everything Minerva could get for me. And we spoke for hours, some days – about how I was raised, how I was horrid, how I cannot change that but perhaps I can change my future. Muggles start wars over race, religion, any number of idiotic things just as wizards do. And it turns these small differences in people into life-or-death variances. I understand this now. I understand that I contributed to this culture of oppression and violence and I will not participate anymore.
Harry whirled fast, his cigarette falling from his fingers. He didn’t bother stomping it out, the castle was all stone, anyways. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision blurring around the edges.
, hands cupping either side of his face.
“When we talk about the most recent war, we’re not going to use titles like He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named or Lord Voldemort, either.” You could tell the muggleborns, he thought, because they were the ones that didn’t flinch when he said the name Voldemort. “His name was Tom Riddle, so we can either call him Tom Riddle or Riddle. None of this fancy name business.
it was different. “Andromeda didn’t know me, before. It’s easy for her. I called Granger a Mud- a
There were probably healthier ways to achieve the same thing. Meditation, maybe. Occlumency, probably. But he’d never been good at eihter. When he smoked, at least he didn’t have to put in effort.
“Merlin, that’s twice in one day,” Draco groused as Zabini vanished the evidence with a flick of his wand.
He stayed in the forest a long while, longer than he should have. No one said anything, though, when he missed lunch. Hermione had shot him a worried look as he passed by her, trailing after the Slytherins, but he didn’t stop to think about it, to talk. Instead, he followed the gentle pull of Draco’s hand in his, the small smile on Pansy’s face, Blaise’s encouraging arm around his shoulders.
“It was-” Harry wasn’t sure he could even articulate how he was feeling. The spinning feeling hadn’t left his chest, not really, although it had transformed into something that felt much more crushing. He was dimly aware that he was still gasping for breath, his vision was still grey on the edges. Zabini, strangely enough, was the only constant right now – an obvious juxtaposition from his dream of the dead and dying.
Maybe some wizards are simply fearful of muggles. After all, we still spend much time dedicated to learning about witch burnings – as if they were even a cause for fear. Did you know most killed “witches” were actually muggles? Their fear of us caused them to attack their own, which perhaps caused us to fear them.
Harry gave him a hard look, not entirely convinced but unsure how to argue – unsure if Draco would be upset if he pushed more.
“I like it,” she said finally, snapping him out of his moment of concern. “I’ll be Mar, then.”
, Potter.” Harry jumped, accidentally jostling Draco’s head off of his shoulder. It was Blaise, who normally never rose his voice. He was glaring daggers at Harry. “She didn’t do shit for us last year, left us to save ourselves, just like the rest of your stupid little army.”
“We could call you Mari,” piped up another boy.
I will not give you details about what I experienced in the war. It was horrendous, it was wrong. I cannot compare it to your experiences – you put yourself under great duress for the good of everyone. I put myself under great duress for the good of nobody except the Dark Lord. Sometimes, in my mind, I am irredeemable, but I try not to give into that. My choices do not define my worth, but they do decide my consequences.
“Yes,” Harry said. Silence settled between them as Harry gathered his thoughts, trying to decide how to explain. “I suppose it’s just…even if it is in my head, that doesn’t mean it’s not real,” he said finally. “And-” he paused, not sure he wanted to voice the next part, even to Andromeda.
He didn’t know how Potter was acting so
He only partially noticed Blaise disappear from his side and shoulder his way into the crowd; then reappear almost as quickly. He jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder. “Looks like it’s you and me, mate,” said Zabini into his ear.
. But why was he reacting like that?
“Well, how would you put it?” Ginny asked after a moments silence. Seeing he wasn’t going to get out of it, Harry relayed to her the events of the first week – everything from the first day in the eighth year common room to smuggling Draco out that morning.
I sound far too pompous when writing letters. I do hope you will allow me to apologize in person. I am likely to dither less, as well.
“We were wondering if we could talk,” Hermione said carefully. She was glancing past him, into their room, and Harry could feel the cold stares his friends aimed at her, even if he couldn’t see them.
A pang went through him at the thought of Tonks – usually thoughts like these led to Lupin, which led to Sirius. He did his best to squash the feelings before they overwhelmed him.
I was wrong. I am sure there are still things I am wrong about, but I would like to continue learning. I am doing my best to have an open mind. This is what I had wanted to convey to you the first time we spoke. I was unable to, perhaps because some wounds are still too fresh, perhaps because your friends are not as willing as I to put down their arms and recognize their wrongs.
And then, Hermione, you were being hurt by Bellatrix. And I wish I could say I would hear your screams for the rest of my life, but I won’t, because that was nothing compared to what I saw at the hands of the Carrows. You are branded, though – not like I, of course. I am branded by choice, poor though it may have been. You are branded because of your birth, due to something you can’t control.
“Right,” Harry said, turning back to the chalkboard to write
“No,” she said. “You’re here now, and if you’re going to stay you’re going to listen. You do not get to speak.”
“No one else needed saving!” Weasley exclaimed. “It’s not like the Carrows were hurting pure-bloods. The DA were the only ones standing up to them, no one would have gotten hurt after they left.” To Draco’s satisfaction, he sounded unsure as he finished talking.
“Thanks,” Harry said, albeit begrudgingly. He had always liked Neville, generally, but it seemed a deliberate slight that he was offering Harry help after having already stood around to watch Zacharias and his friends pull wands on him. And it didn’t escape Harry’s notice that while Neville clearly thought Harry was deserving of help, the thought did not extend to the people around him.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “Came from there.”
Pansy, Harry, and Draco had been in the Slytherin common room far too late into the night. They had spoken, separately, to each dorm about the upcoming year – had worked on getting to know each and every student (although this was mostly Harry; Pansy and Draco were familiar with the majority of the students in their former house). The younger students had reacted with awe and wonder at the seventh years. Many clung to Pansy, wanting to tell her about their summer or receive comfort about being back at the castle. The older students, meanwhile, were mostly angry and sullen at Harry and Draco’s presence, refusing to speak to anyone other than Pansy. It had been…exhausting.
“Bed?” Harry managed to gasp out between ragged breaths. He could hardly keep up with Draco, with his hands and his lips and his hips tilting
“Set Teddy down, love, and go shower,” she said to him without looking up. Harry smiled to himself. Having someone to care for had kept Andy busy and seemed to keep her grief at bay. Being cared for did the same for Harry in the Days After.
“I’m coming,” Pansy announced. “Blaise, stay with Draco.”
Thankfully, there were no forced partnerships for the rest of the day, and they didn’t have any more classes with the Gryffindors. Harry wasn’t able to eat at lunch, still feeling too sick from the morning’s events. Draco seemed to be feeling much the same. By the time evening came, both were exhausted, so Blaise offered to go to with Pansy to show Mar the library while Harry and Draco got some rest.
“I’ll try to make sure we learn about everything you write down,” he said once he had turned around, “As long as it’s appropriate for this class. Take all the time you need, and once we’re all done we’ll do something fun, okay?”
By the time Professor Stone had finished speaking and Harry had gathered the ingredients, and Ginny had divvied up the steps to the potion, he had hoped she would have forgotten her question. One pointed look from her after a moment of silence, though, told him she hadn’t at all. He felt panic gripping the edges of his mind, tried to push it away.
Then I became a Death Eater. Again, I will not make excuses. I could say I was under pressure, there was a madman in my house, my family was under threat, my other option was death. Perhaps this is not untrue, but nobler wizards that I would have chosen death. Nobler wizards than I would rather have died than do the things I did. I chose, out of my own free will to follow the Dark Lord. I believed in the world he wanted, a world where wizards ruled; where we did not live in fear. I did not realize that we have power already, just as muggles do. I did not realize that we are not oppressed, rather that we live in a world of our choosing – a world that benefits us, a world that makes us oppressors of magical beings and, to some extent, muggles. I did not realize, but that does not excuse me. The consequences are mine, too.
Harry didn’t bother to comment. It wasn’t as if he had never been an exception to the norm before. And it wasn’t as though he had never escaped certain injury – or even certain death – before.
“When I approached the professors about this very situation, Professor Slughorn was adamant he would only put his support behind it if you were able to be the Student Guardian to the Slytherin House. And although Professor Slughorn announced his retirement not long after, the staff were almost all unanimously in favour of the idea. You and Mr Potter are to be in charge of the Slytherins. And – I was going to tell him this tomorrow at our meeting, but I shall instead explain to both of you now – if Mr Malfoy were to lend a hand in an unofficial capacity, it would not be cause for concern.”
“You can’t,” he said, instead.
Dumbledore. He was probably right about Crabbe and Goyle, too, but it hurt all the same.
“I never realized magic was so technical,” was all Harry could think to say. “I didn’t think you could lose it.”
“I will not,” he sniffed. “Everyone in this room, including Pansy and Potter, has spent all summer trying to
“So did I,” Draco said mulishly.
“When will Ron and Hermione be at Hogwarts?” Andromeda directed the question at both of them, although of course Draco would have no way of knowing the answer.
Harry tried not to think of his nightmare, but the more he tried the more it rose to the forefront of his mind. At this point in his life, he was used to nightmares; to waking up shaking and in terror. They had been especially terrible directly following the war and again his first couple nights at Hogwarts, but the previous nights’ had been his worst yet.
Draco’s hand came up to cup Harry’s cheek and he turned into it, kissing the other boy’s palm. Draco withdrew his hand, leaning down instead to press a slow kiss to Harry’s lips. “You don’t owe the world anything,” Draco said against his mouth. “You didn’t need to stay, you never had to. No one would have been angry if you had…gone on.”
Weasley flushed a brilliant shade of red. “Shut it Zabini,” he ground out.
“I want to get Muggle Studies out of the way,” Blaise said with a sigh. “No use in putting it until the last minute and then not being able to graduate after all this.”
“Can anyone think of any Muggles that may have been starting wars around the same time?” Harry asked once he had turned back to the class. Fewer hands went up, and this time it was easy to identify the purebloods by the uncomfortable glances they cast around the room.
I quite enjoy this chapter for Harry although I realize there isn’t much Draco in it. But we’ll see him again next chapter<333
“Stop,” it was Draco’s voice, quiet but commanding, clearly directed at Harry and Blaise. He glanced at Zabini, who dropped his wand, gaze remaining on the four in front of them. Harry followed suit, turned his eyes to Draco as the other boy wiped the spit off his face, rolled up his sleves to display his Mark – faded, but there.
“Oh, it was dandy,” he responded, unable to help himself. “Spending my time with only ghosts and thrice daily tea with McGonagall.”
He had spent the summer pulling strings at the ministry, too. Himself, Andromeda, and Professor McGonagall of all people, to be exact. It had ended, after appeals to the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic himself, with permission for Draco to visit his mother and Andromeda as long as he provided a written request to the Ministry a week before and did not bring his wand.
McGonagall rubbed her temples and gave a glance heavenward before continuing. “Very well, Ms Parkinson. We have decided that this rule will be broken for the Slytherin house alone.”
He gasped, breath hot on Draco’s cock. A bit of precum dripped, slowly, and Harry lapped it up with his tongue. Draco’s breath was uneven, his hands tangling in Harry’s hair and pulling hard. Harry’s own hardness pressed almost painfully against his trousers.
“Don’t tell me it’s different because you’ve sucked his dick,” she said between cackles. Draco buried his face in his hands. “I don’t think that will work with Granger, I’m not sure she has one, but you could always try with Weasley.”
Harry winced. “I’d like to think it would have been different if I had been here, but I know nothing would have changed.” He sighed. “All summer Andromeda had to remind me that we were still kids when it all happened. I’ve used Unforgivables, I’ve killed people, I doubt any of us were charming to you lot either, when we were in our younger years.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But I grieved. And I came around. So did Ginny. Draco grieved and practically relearned how to exist in society. Why is it taking them so long?”
A plate with food was shoved into his lap, Pomfrey telling him to eat as much as he could. And he found, for the first time in a while, that he was truly hungry. “Where’s Draco?” he asked as he ate.
“Sorry,” Blaise said offhandedly, noting perhaps the tension on his friends faces, “but it’s true. They hurt people. Really hurt people.”
She looked surprised, just a little, but hid it quickly. “Let’s not bring it back up,” she said, almost immediately. “I don’t want to think about…” She paused setting up her cauldron to rub her face. “We’re here now. That’s all.”
“What are you writing for your muggle studies assignment?” A sixth year girl asked. Harry was fairly confident her name was Amelia, but he didn’t know the older students as well as he knew the younger students. “I want to get it out of the way,” she said with a sigh.
A pang went through him at the thought of Tonks – usually thoughts like these led to Lupin, which led to Sirius. He did his best to squash the feelings before they overwhelmed him.
“You don’t — fuck, Harry, you act like you exist in a little bubble but you don’t.” She hiccoughed, and a hovering elf took that moment to make two cups of tea appear in front of them. Harry took a polite sip. He really wasn’t sure if he could stomach any more tea today.
Maybe, in deciding to open a school, become a teacher, he had made a great career choice. Or maybe this would all fall apart around him. But for the first time in the Days After, Harry was feeling hopeful.
Harry was so surprised he sat bolt upright in the bed. “That ended horribly last time,” Harry said. “Are you mad?”
“Yes, Headmistress,” he responded, giving McGonagall a small smile. Between the amount of time he had spent here rebuilding over the summer and his near-daily meetings with McGonagall this year, he felt he knew her quite better than any other student did.
to find a reason to get us sent home and we don’t particularly want to give him one. Your goodie two shoes Gryffindor pals don’t seem to want to lend us a hand, either,” Harry felt as if he were a small child being spoken sternly to for misbehaving. “So we are going to leave before anyone else is up and have a cozy breakfast with the house elves.”
i'm honestly not in love with this chapter but honestly i think its because i feel like i struggle with writing dialogue a lot..legit spent all day on this one even though i had things to do!! worth tho. a plot is slowly forming in my brain...
“You put him there,” Ron said finally. “He would never be working on that if it hadn’t been for you.”
He had turned to exercise instead. It was almost more helpful, and it kept him outside for hours every day. He’d filled out from the commination of food and his workout regime, was less the scrawny child he’d always been.
They had stopped walking. Draco’s eyes were on him, serious and bright. He didn’t know, really, who Draco was trying to convince – Harry, or himself.
Harry licked another stripe along Draco’s length, wrapping his hands around Draco’s thighs, feeling him shudder and lean into him. Then his mouth was on Draco, sliding impossibly far down his cock before pulling back working up a rhythm. He lost himself in the pace, he had never done this before, but if the noises Draco was making were anything to go by, then he wasn’t doing it half badly.
He winced, knowing it was coming before he even closed his mouth. He had debated leaving Draco out of it, not saying anything, but better they find out from him now than find out he was lying to them later.
his career.
“You think we wanted to hurt people? They threatened to kill our families, make us kill each other. Maybe you’d have let your family die for the greater good or whatever noble shite you believe that makes you think you’re better than us, but you’re not any better. You left by yourselves; you stayed home, you disappeared, you didn’t take a single first year or Slytherin with you.
Harry had fully intended to rest, too – he really was exhausted. But Draco, of course, had other plans. They were barely inside Draco’s rooms before he had Harry up against the wall. The stone was rough and cold on Harry’s back, but with Draco’s lips on his he hardly noticed.
“Why don’t we go outside?” he asked after a moment of heavy silence. They followed him through the halls of the castle, toward the Entrance Hall. They weren’t talking, but he could feel them silently communicating with each other in that way they always did.
Harry was too tired to argue.
Hermione snorted. “I knew it wasn’t all rivalry.”
The common room was warm, reminding him distinctly of the Gryffindor common room. A fire was already burning in the fireplace to their right, warming the air. There was a mishmash of chairs and couches spread around it, as though the professors had simply dug up any undamaged furniture they could find in the castle. Bookshelves lined the wall opposite, and chairs and tables were scattered around. Presumably the professors expected them to get more studying done here, rather than in the library – or perhaps it was just to mimic the Ravenclaw common room. The lack of windows, however, was already making Harry feel distinctly claustrophibic.
He did his best to change the topic. “I think Andromeda is bringing Teddy this weekend,” he said. “For the whole weekend.”
“And on that note,” McGonagall said, smiling warmly down at all the students. Harry felt almost eleven years old again. “Please make your way to your common rooms. First years, your House Guardians will meet you at your table and guide you to your Common Room.”
“What did he get probation for, Hermione? Torture? Hurting people? Using Unforgivables? We did that too, in case you forgot. Or I did, at the very least. We’re two sides of the same coin, Draco and I.”
“Today is a day to rejoice,” she began clearly. Any remaining speaking in the hall had stopped. “For those of us who have come back to the castle, who are still able to find refuge in this place.”
Harry shifted in his seat as the Professor Vector called out the name of the first student, opting to lean more heavily against Draco. Pansy was leaning over him, cooing over Teddy as if there wasn’t even a sorting going on at all. And to be fair to her – Harry wasn’t interested, particularly, in the sorting. Another year, more students divided into houses, more rivalries formed – the same as it always was. No, he was much more content to sit here, bent over his godson instead, leaning against his – well, not
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a sigh in Blaise’s direction. “I’m dedicating tomorrow morning for arithmancy. Just you and me until lunch.” He gave Blaise a cheeky look, but the other boy just rolled his eyes.
Draco nudged her back with a foot. “Stop it, you’re making Potter blush.”
He propped himself above Draco, breathing shakily. Harry was keenly aware of where their bodies lined up, his as lean as Draco’s from a year starving and on the run. His mind was barely keeping track of his body, but somehow he was stretched out, hips lined up with Draco’s, hands holding Draco’s hands above his head, pinned to the stone underneath them.
“It’s part of his parole,” Harry said dully. “And it’s important to have a committed pure-blood on the team. He knows more than anyone what information he’s missing to integrate into muggle culture.”
“How’s working with Binns?” Ron asked, finally breaking the tension.
Before he could say anything, a girl’s voice spoke up. “Are you Harry Potter?”
“Had to go and upset her, didn’t you, Weasley?” Blaise drawled, breaking the silence of the moment. “Is it all Gryffindors that are so tactless, or are Weasley’s especially bad at it?”
“That’s temporary, Potter,” Pansy said with a look. “You’ll be good as new in two weeks.”
“Yeah,” he said, dully. Harry didn’t particularly want to think about leaving, even if it would become reality tomorrow.
“Would you believe he didn’t say a word to me the entire time? Frankly I’m not quite sure he’s smart enough to speak,” Draco smiled at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“We’ll know soon enough,” Pansy responded. “We have her first…with the seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.”
And then everything was exploding, straight from his hands, his chest, his head – he didn’t know. The world was electric, like lightning. Someone was screaming – it was him, he realized. He was screaming. And then there was nothing.
“I wasn’t going to put it like that,” Harry responded with a rueful smile. He snuck a glance at Draco as he looked down to sort his cut ingredients. The other boy wasn’t looking at him - was focused on Luna instead, almost smiling. He seemed to be much more comfortable now that he was brewing. When he glanced around the room quickly he managed to find Pansy with a Ravenclaw sixth year, and Blaise, looking aloof next to a seventh year Gryffindor girl who Harry vaguely remembered as being named Melanie.
But Days After Harry was a catastrophic mix of desire, anxiety, and exhaustion.
“Oh,” she said, between sniffs. “Harry. What are you doing here?”
He was woken, unsure of how much time had passed, to Draco shaking him. “The Welcome Feast is soon,” Draco said. “And we need to find Blaise and Pansy.”
“Can I see him now?” Harry asked, sitting up straighter. “I’m feeling fine. How long have I been here, anyway?”
“Smart girl,” Andromeda said approvingly. “Are any of your friends coming back, Draco?”
Harry felt his skin prickle - anger, again. Frustration, maybe? Not emotions he felt often enough anymore. “Well clearly it meant something, Hermione,” he said, finally, “or you wouldn’t have said it.”
“I know.” He sighed, trying to let some of the tension out of him. It didn’t work. “I’m going to find McGonagall, see if I can floo Andy to see if she’ll come through today. Want to come with me?”
Madame Pomfrey clucked in distaste from somewhere behind him. “Camped outside of the Hospital Wing all day – along with half of Slytherin house no less. Whatever you’ve been doing, Mr Potter, you have a group of very loyal students at your back.”
Draco’s laughter followed them out of the bathroom and toward the eighth year common room. Harry privately thought he had never heard a better sound.
. The toast tasted like sawdust in his mouth.
Everyone was looking expectantly at Draco and Harry. Harry put his head down on the table, which prompted Draco to sigh. “We can’t all write about the same topic,” he said. There were mutters of agreement around the table, but no one else said anything. Harry assumed they were still watching Draco expectantly by the way he sighed again.
also i made a tumblr?? i don't know how to use it, but you can find me as CaspianJames and maybe I'll learn how to use it so I can post about the fics and things I'm working on (more drarry? yes. long haul drarry? yes. fix it fic drarry? yes. trans harry? yes. so much yes.)
“It was worse,” Harry managed to say, before abruptly being sick all over the floor. Zabini vanished the mess easily, and dried Harry of the water he had poured on him with an extra flourish of his wand. He moved to sit down beside Harry on his bed.
He shivered, just for a moment, at the cool air before it was replaced by Draco’s warm breath, kissing and biting and licking his thighs, his hips, everywhere except
Draco had filled out well over the summer and first part of the school year. He wasn’t a shell of a person anymore – neither was Harry. There was lean muscle to his arms now, his face was more than just bones, even if he was still quite aristocratic and pointy-looking. He was all angles, his hair falling in loose waves down to his chin, and there wasn’t a single thing Harry disliked.
But it couldn’t be his head, not when it was clearly his magic. Perhaps it was trying to right a wrong. Harry had died, after all. He shouldn’t be alive. The universe was imbalanced, his magic knew it. It was trying to kill him.
“Let’s go then,” Harry responded, trying to swallow his apprehension at the implication of what he had just said. Draco simply looked at him for a moment before nodding at him to lead the way into the bathroom.
It was gentle, not like the kisses they had shared before in the living room, or the garden, or the Astronomy Tower. Draco’s lips were soft on his, his tongue adventurous in his mouth. Harry moved his hands to Draco’s chest, caressing his shoulders, his hips, wherever he could reach. He felt Draco’s hands stray to his waist, and willed himself to stay calm.
her office as well.
“Harry,” she said warmly when he sat down.
“No?” Harry asked in surprise. Looking closer, of course, he noticed that some of them looked newer than the others, still pink and puckered under his hands. He leaned down to trail their paths with his tongue, felt Draco shudder under him.
She moved to open the door to the classroom, but looked back at them. “I admit that I thought those in Slytherin would have been safe from the Carrows due to blood status. I see now that I was incorrect; all the Carrows cared about was harm. Hogwarts failed you, and I hold myself responsible for this. I will do all in my power to ensure Slytherin House is a safe and welcome environment for every student that passes through it as long as I am Headmistress of this school.”
“Nothing,” Harry said emphatically. Maybe too emphatically – the small girl startled. “There’s nothing wrong with anyone liking girls or anyone liking boys.”
“Today is also a day for grief,” the Headmistress continued, finally. “As we mourn for those who cannot be here with us, for those who will not be waiting for us at home, for those who’s memories still exist in our hearts.
“Harry James Potter? Think before he acts? That’s preposterous,” she said. Hermione didn’t laugh, but he could hear the lightness in her tone.
“And you think you’re so good, Weasley?” she huffed. “Looking down on purebloods that aren’t like you, acting like school children are really the biggest enemy you’ve faced, like we’re worse than Vold-V – than the Dark Lord himself.”
Harry kissed Draco slowly. Tried to convey what he couldn’t with words; how Draco was essential to him, how being with him felt like breathing again after suffocating for so long. Draco responded in kind, lifting his body against Harry’s, biting at Harry’s lip, making him groan.
i am...very fond of this chapter, i think
Mar squealed and gave them a jerky wave before dashing off to the Slytherin table. At almost the same moment, McGonagall appeared beside the group with their timetables.
