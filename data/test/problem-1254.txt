“Alright, so what IS Lys short for?”
“An ass am I?” Draco’s laugh was joyless and cutting, “An ass indeed! But at least I didn’t use anyone for sexual exploration!”
Draco was sitting on a cold stone bench that was almost hidden near the herbology greenhouse. From here, one could easily see the top of the quidditch field. The Gryffindor team was practicing. ‘Perfect,’ Draco thought sarcastically to himself as he rolled his eyes.
“Are we though, Potter? Do you ever ‘just’ do anything?” He got close to Harry once again, but this time it felt different. This time it felt more menacing, “I’ve known you for a while now, Potter and I can say this with certainty: You will try to make something out of this. There is nothing here. Nothing.”
Draco glowered at Blaise, desperate to retort with a scathing remark, but he was having a difficult time finding one. Pansy was finally starting to collect herself.
“Well obviously not, mate. Out with it,” Ron spoke up, apparently having lost interest in Seamus’ riveting tale about Charms girl.
Malfoy growled when Harry broke the kiss and started to work on Malfoy’s neck, nipping and kissing down to the nape. Malfoy ground his stiffening member into Harry’s front, causing the black-haired boy’s breath to hitch. Harry put a knee gently in-between Malfoy’s legs, allowing for them to be closer where it really counted. Malfoy grabbed a handful of Harry’s hair and pulled him back from his neck, almost causing the boy to cry out; he wouldn’t have had the chance anyway when Malfoy reclaimed his lips.

“Sleep well Harry,” she mirrored, returning her gaze once more into the fire. Sometimes Harry wondered what all went on in his friend’s head. What did Hermione think about in moments such as this, staring fervently into the fire? He would have asked her, had it not been for his bed calling his name.
“How did it come to be like this?” Draco asked, sadness evident in his voice.
Their mouths parted as they deepened the kiss, Harry wrapping Draco tightly in his arms as the blond raked his hands through his lover’s hair. They shivered against one another, the anticipation and impossibility of this moment taking its toll on both parties.
Sighing with relief, Harry thanked Ron and they walked the rest of the way to Potions in content silence.
Potions class was near misery. Harry could hardly concentrate thanks to the pair of stormy grey eyes watching him from the back of the class. Malfoy and several of his lot had been chattering lowly for a while, Snape conveniently managing to ignore them.
“Don’t think he’s been sleepin’ too well, Hermione,” Ron muttered, his mouth full of breakfast, “It’s been nonstop tossin’ and turnin’ for the past several nights.”
“Harry, I – I don’t want you to…” Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, leaning in to pepper kisses along his jawline, “…You to suffer for th – this.” At that Harry chuckled darkly, running his hand up Draco’s now bare chest.
“And Cho?” Harry asked, genuinely wondering what Hermione thought. His relationship with Cho was… strange. She hadn’t healed from Cedric’s death, the wound she felt was fresh. Being with her never really felt like anything but a beautiful hallucination. Or rather, a hallucination of a beautiful girl.
Harry’s lips parted willingly, almost needily for Draco, and the Slytherin obliged. They fought for dominance, and when they finally parted for air, foreheads resting together, Harry continued:
“Back then there was no way. Neither of us wanted to leave what we already had. Growing apart and forgetting was just a side effect.”
“Um,” he started smartly, his face burning a bright red, “Uh….”
“What’s wrong, Neville?” she asked, causing the boy to look at her instead. Harry’s attention turned towards the both of them as Seamus rambled on.
“He said he wasn’t going to tell!”
“Why were you watching me?” Potter whispered against Draco’s lips.
Harry was having trouble finding the words to direct back at Malfoy, every comeback getting stuck in his throat as if it was too large. He tried to swallow, but found that his mouth was exceptionally dry. Since the only light in the room came from Malfoy’s wand, the shadows on the blond’s face were especially harsh and made it seem as though Harry was looking into the grey, steely eyes of a predator. Backing up still, he was suddenly stopped and realized that he’d hit the wall. No where else to run.
“Listen Potter, you can believe anything that you want to, but I meant what I said. But I might decide to eventually.” He smirked maliciously at Harry, backing towards the door with his want raised. When he reached the doors, he swiftly opened them and slithered out, letting out a sigh of relief. He smiled to himslef, thinking that the situation at hand was finally leaning in his favor.
“Thank you,” a delicate pause, “For helping me. I guess. I’m not gay but… well I know I’m not straight now, don’t I?”
Harry forced himself out of this train of thought by downing his glass of pumpkin juice just as his friends were gathering up their bags, preparing to head to their first class. He already knew that it was going to be a rather long day.
“I…” he started, feeling his control over his emotions start to slip away, “I’ve got to go.” Draco quickly gathered his things as Potter blinked, a look of confusion on his face.
“Shit,” the blond mumbled, unknowingly grinding himself against Harry. Harry, who moaned in response and nipped lightly at the nape of Draco’s neck.
“And where, pray tell, have you been?”
Eventually Draco ended up back in the Slytherin common room, but this time he found that it was empty. Everyone was probably at dinner or something along those lines.
“I’m so confused,” he mumbled, looking down. Draco waited for him to continue.
“Obviously,” the blond said, a smirk on his face as he tossed a green apple into the air, catching it and repeating.
“Well you assumed wrong Potter,” Draco drawled, his smirk back in place, “It’s much more fun to keep at this game.”
With lunch coming to an end, Draco decided it was best if he went ahead and left the mess hall, unaware of a shaggy-haired Gryffindor that thought it necessary to follow him. He turned in the hallway, making his way towards his next class, which happened to be herbology, when he was grabbed from behind by the wrist.
“I’m fine,” He repeated, his eyes flashing down to Harry’s lips before returning to his eyes. “I’m fine.” Neither boy was really thinking as they slowly started to close the gap between their faces.
However, there were always moments where the memory of Malfoy, of that night would creep into his consciousness. They typically came, as one would predict, whilst he was trying to sleep.
“And you’re even stranger, Malfoy,” Potter responded sharply, following Draco’s movements with his own.
“I don’t care,” Harry purred into the blond’s ear, “Draco.” When he said his name, Draco had to suppress a moan. Giving in, he clashed his lips against Harry’s once again, a hunger and thirst for something he couldn’t have driving his famished tongue against his lover’s.
“I can leave if you need to study,” Harry heard himself say without really registering it.
“Chop you up and feed you to the giant squid of course. It’s an incredibly dignified death for an incredibly dignified, self-important git. Someone just like you, Malfoy,” Harry deadpanned, sticking his chin towards the other boy in a sort of challenge.
“For FUCK’S sake, Potter!” Draco threw his hands up in exasperation, causing Harry to take up a defensive stance whilst reaching for his wand.
Draco moaned unceremoniously, feeling his pants grow tight. Suddenly the temperature in the room was far too hot for him to handle.
Feeling a gentle gust of wind, Harry looked up to to discover that during his thought-filled wanderings, he had somehow managed to find himself in the breezeway. He paused and leaned against the stone side, staring out over the scenery. The wind blew his dark hair back from his face, exposing his scar for all to see, but no one was there.
Cursing quietly, Draco continued forward at a faster pace, his footsteps echoing with force throughout the now empty hall. He was thinking about how ridiculous he had been for spending this much time brooding about a bloody name, when he felt a hand wrap around his wrist and yank him into a dark room. He did not succeed in suppressing a yelp.
Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Harry looked around, trying to gather his bearings and remember where he was. Ah, the library. Suddenly Harry remembered Malfoy, and he jerked his head to the side, but Malfoy was no longer there. How many hours had Harry been sleeping?
“How is practicing caution ridiculous again? Unless you’re trying to get me to drop my guard for your own personal agenda. Full offence intended, Malfoy, I don’t bloody trust a word out of your mouth.”
The tanned, dark haired man with the bright green eyes detached himself from Draco’s mouth and instead focused on the pale neck that was stretched out before him. His teeth gently grazed the nape of Draco’s neck before latching onto the spot, sucking fervently.
“Umbridge again, hm? When will you get it through your thick skull, Potter? I’m not a puppet for that damn woman. But that’s beside the point, isn’t it?” It felt as though a cat was circling a mouse, dangerous. Draco continued:
Harry finally turned to face his rival, making the other boy jump slightly. He was too tired to deal with Malfoy and his mind games. “So is this it then? Your grand plan? To toss me over the breeze way? I have to say, Malfoy, I’m a little disappointed. I was expecting something far more creative.”
Suddenly the girl pulled back and looked up at Harry, her eyes curious and large.
Harry didn’t know why Draco would feel hurt, but he definitely picked up that the Slytherin was feeling it.
Potter huffed, brow furrowed. It was at this that Draco’s face adopted a smug expression as he added, “And you were snoring, so I knew you weren’t comatose.” Potter actually blushed a light pink with embarrassment, avoiding looking at Draco altogether.
Before he knew what his body was doing, he crawled over to Harry, putting his hands on the other boy’s shoulders.
“I have to go,” he said in a terse manner after a moment of heavy silence.
“I can still remember it clearly, fifth year, autumn, the room of requirement.” They both chuckled softly at that.
This thought brought a wry smile to Draco’s face as he forgot himself in his own train of thought. A train of thought that was interrupted by Theo:
“Don’t be ridiculous, Pansy, it’s just bloody hot in here, that’s all.”
“Then why…” Harry started, blinking quickly to prevent tears, “Why were you up there?” He realized how shaky and pathetic his voice sounded. It sounded like he would shatter. Draco’s face morphed into one of severe concern as he saw how shaken up Harry was.
Without realizing what he was doing, he looked up and over to the Slytherin table, quickly catching sight of the bright shock of blond hair. Malfoy looked just as calm, collected and condescending as he always had. Harry knew he’d been watching him for too long when suddenly grey eyes met his. The Gryffindor quickly jerked his head away, fighting the warmth that was gathering in his cheeks.
Draco and his friends went on to the great hall for lunch, sitting down with the rest of the Slytherins. The table was bustling with energy, everyone excited for winter break to commence. It was only a week and a half away, after all. Kids all over were chattering about what they were expecting to do for the break, but Draco deigned to tune most of them out in favor of his own thoughts. Potter would probably be staying there at the castle for Christmas, it seemed as if he always did. Not that it mattered to Draco. If he didn’t come home for the holiday, then his mother would be heartbroken. How did his thoughts always return to Potter?
“He’s still a slimey git,” Harry grumbled, sinking further into his chair and pouting.
A small smile spread itself against Draco’s mouth despite himself. Even though he’d been so firm with Potter the other night in the tower, he couldn’t help but feel giddy at the prospect of meeting him alone once again. But, the ‘Room of Requirement’, what and where was that? Draco thought properly for a moment, and was able to deduce that it must have been where he caught Potter sneaking off to, where those silly meetings of his were held. Yes. Yes he’d meet Potter there tonight. He’d accept Potter’s invitation. It was as though he was taking steps towards a world he knew nothing about. An exciting, exhilarating world, but unfamiliar nonetheless.
We talked for a bit longer. I told her that I’d run into Pansy, and then Mum went back to her errands. That’s how she calls Dad now – he can’t be left on his own.
“What makes you think it’s a pureblood house?” Harry asked, surprised.
“We’re in a Muggle area, so don’t use magic too often, and if you do, don’t forget to make sure nobody can see or hear you. No girls, no Weasley and Granger – I reckon that goes without saying.”
The door of the living room creaked, and Harry couldn’t help smiling when he saw Draco come in.
Embarrassed, I smiled and squinted as the fireworks exploded above my head. I’ve never been a fan of attention, even though today I’m not the only one celebrating. The party was organized by some of Ron’s friends to mark the end of our studies. Yes, that’s right – from now on we are officially Aurors! The dream has come true, I guess.
Home was soothing in Potter’s absence. I drank a cup of coffee, picked up the book on ordinary crimes that I once found very useful and settled down on the couch. That was when Potter arrived with the “wonderful” news. Technically, first he just arrived and annoyed me with his chattiness, and only then announced that “we will have to learn how to tolerate each other”. Thankfully, after this revelation he went upstairs and left me alone.
“I brought the birth certificate,” he took the folded paper out of the back pocket of his jeans. “I hope that’ll help.”
“No you weren’t.”
“Okay, Malfoy, can we please decide something,” Potter jumped on the opportunity to drop formalities. “You can practise your phrase-mongering in court.”
“Pansy! Is this you? You’ve changed.”
Draco’s eyes were watery, the edges of his nostrils red, but he was smiling. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, leaned over and kissed him. Malfoy moved closer and ran his hands down Harry’s back, which sent a shiver down Harry's spine. The kiss became more and more impatient, Harry could feel his heart racing, and Draco was clearly out of breath.
As much as I hated to admit it, Potter’s words about acting childish had hit the target. I decided I’d not lower myself to that level any more. My Slytherin nature quickly found a way out: our deal said nothing about insulting Potter. Yes, it’ll definitely be fun having him here.
by Lizzo. It’s great, listen to it! :D
“Prick.”
Harry caught the bottles that flew into the living room from the kitchen and handed one to Annalise.
I exist when we play against Ravenclaw, because the seeker replacing Chang is clearly no match for her, so there is no challenge. It seems like I could give him a ten minutes head start – he’d miss the Snitch anyway. I exist when I follow the other Gryffindors to Hogsmeade for the weekly ration of Butterbeer. I am indifferent to the illegal Firewhiskey that Dean has managed to buy from some mysterious guy.
“Yes, since last year. In the border control department,” she obviously didn’t know what else to say. I get it; we haven’t been in contact since school, so we didn’t really have a lot to say to each other.
“Oh, fuck off!” I snapped, but ended up letting out a laugh. The bastard did understand me a little too well.
“Yes and no,” Finn pulled out some tobacco and a filter and started to roll a cigarette. “There’s a series of spells which basically lets you know stuff about your heredity, but you’re right, only Muggles call that a DNA test.”
“I don’t know, we just got here,” she finally cast
Potter nodded absentmindedly and stepped out the front door.
Hermione and Ron were still bickering; Harry yawned and patted Ron on the shoulder.
“That’s why we ended up playing chess here,” he finished hastily.
“I’m not going anywhere. You’ll have to deal with me for at least a month,” he replied angrily.
“You’re going to rent a flat? In the wizarding world? Harry, you know this isn’t safe.”
I tucked my shirt in my pants, put my watch on, tried to comb my hair and went downstairs. Malfoy arrived in a minute or so.
“Hello,” she smiled at Potter. “Mr. Potter, I work in the archive. I came by to tell you that you should submit copies of your reports to me or my colleague.”
The next morning, when I entered the kitchen, I was surprised to see that Potter had already washed up and standing by the stove, frying something.
“I am saying,” Malfoy explained, “that if you don’t lie, you must have told them by now where you’re staying. And not mentioning me in the story would be… well, maybe not an outright lie, but not the truth either.”
We will live.
Malfoy was still laughing nervously as Tony slammed the door.
I sighed and went back to the living room, where I saw Potter running around in ironed pants (he knows how to iron?) and an unbuttoned shirt.
“We could hang out somewhere else,” he said. Annalise wrinkled her nose.
“Hi.”
“I said I would. Let’s go.”
Harry had never paid less than a sickle for a pint, so he took a silver coin out of his pocket and put it on the counter.
I arrived at the office and was immediately buried under the paperwork necessary to prepare for the hearing. Mann’s trial was planned for tomorrow, as well as the other “easy” cases, as Harper called them.
Harry hadn’t heard this particular annoyed voice before. He looked up to see a tall girl who was passive aggressively rolling her wand between her fingers. She had long brown hair with an undercut; the cat-eye make-up only emphasized the suspicious look she gave Harry.
The Barrel turned out to be a regular house, just as Draco had said. Harry tapped his wand on the gate and whispered the password, and the door opened with a light click. From where he stood, Harry heard music and sounds of people speaking. He pushed the gate, stepped inside and found himself in a front yard. As soon as he closed the door behind him, the sounds became much louder; there was a soundproofing charm, Harry figured. On his left, there was what he assumed to be a summer kitchen with old wooden windows, and in front of it, taking up almost half of the yard, there was an empty round fountain - a group of people were sitting on the stone edge, chatting and smoking. On his right, he saw a large pine tree with prominent roots; he could see names carved on the trunk, and there were lots of lights in the lower branches. The house looked shabby, just like the kitchen and the fountain. Harry thought to himself that the blueish paint on the facade had been there for at least two decades. He noticed a porch and a front door, but people seemed to be using the garage on the side of the house as an entrance. Harry hesitated for a minute, but then he saw two guys come out of the garage with pints of beer, and that settled it. He smiled awkwardly at one of the girls by the fountain, who by that point was starting to shoot suspicious looks at him, and entered the building without further hesitation.
“I don’t…”
Harry nodded, trying his best to look relaxed. The ironic look Draco gave him hinted to the fact that he didn’t really succeed.
“Perfect choice!” the barmaid put the pint in front of him, looked up to see his face for the first time and froze. “Have I seen you here before?”
“Hi, Tony,” Harry said. “What are you baking?”
“Technically it’s a friend’s house. But they have a bar there,” Draco answered, slipping into his sneakers. “I’m really sorry, I’m awfully late. Iris can give you the address.”
Finally, the day came to an end, and we sat down for a drink in a nearby café.
“It will,” Draco assured him as he skimmed the certificate. “I see you’ve already met Iris.”
Harry put out his cigarette.
“Hi,” I said.
“Ask your friends in the Ministry why they won’t approve the potion. The research has been done years ago, but these bastards won’t allow it on the market,” Annalise said grumpily. “The wizarding trans committee writes letters every year, but the Wizengamot won’t even hear us out.”
“I know what I said. I mean, you agree with me that he doesn’t have it in him to be a thief, don’t you?”
Harry told the barman that he didn’t really go out in Muggle London, but he did like the song.
“Mr Malfoy, you can start on Monday.”
I have already cursed myself multiple times for placing the ad. Got fed up with solitude, huh! Now I’ll have to tolerate Potter whom for some reason I still haven’t kicked out… Well, I did know the reason, but now the whole thing seemed foolish: his presence offered almost no advantages but will get on my nerves. However, Potter wasn’t about to leave. Does he really have no place to live? Anyway, that’s none of my business.
“I’ll give you back your money.”
“The one Annalise mentioned yesterday,” Harry said. “He could convince the Wizengamot to hear the trans committee out.”
“Yeah, if he’s gonna be one of those
– the note said.
“Unbelievable.”
“Check mate. You owe me another beer.”
“Um… outside London, I guess?”
“Oh, hi!” Annalise smiled. “What are you doing here?”
“Wow. Why would they do that? And how come we’ve never heard about these raids?” he wondered.
Harry shifted in his chair and nodded, thinking to himself that alcohol was exactly what he needed right now, and took the cold bottle that Malfoy handed him. Draco opened another one for himself and leaned on the windowsill. Harry coughed, trying to think of a way to fill the silence.
“Potter,” he said defensively.
“No, Draco, I would never!” she exclaimed.
“Okay. Move it,” he said and pushed me with his shoulder.
Potter looked as surprised as I was. He even stepped back, almost slipping on the stairs. My mind was racing a million miles an hour, jumping instantly to a handful of worst case scenarios. What on earth does he want from me? Did he come here to get back at me for some school grudge?
“We didn’t know each other back then, we actually met here,” Annalise added and squeezed Finn in a brief hug.
“I really like it, by the way,” he brushed a strand of purple hair off Draco’s face.
“Come on then,” Draco nodded in the direction of the kitchen, and Harry followed him.
“I see.”
“I don’t think so. Anyway, is it really necessary to close the door?” I didn’t understand what on earth could happen to me if I saw Malfoy brushing his teeth.
“Mr. Malfoy,” he countered with an ironic smile, “you are asking for too much. Do not forget that your client was caught in the act.”
Harry bit his lip, trying to find the right words of support.
okay.”
coming back to the Manor to be your puppet again!”
“Your father has decided enough for you. You have the right to live your life now.”
Harry felt relieved and at the same time confused about what was going on between them. There definitely was a thing, but it was too soon to know what exactly. So when the fireplace cracked several times, announcing the arrival of the others, Harry was more than happy to change the subject.
“And where do you keep your glasses?”
“Of course I have. Get out of here for a minute, will you?”
“I really don’t want to talk about my father,” Draco leaned back on his arms. “So, what are you going to do about Bennet?”
“It’s my house, I’ll boast if I want to.”
“You did chicken out,” I returned the provocation.
I glanced at him, thinking that referring to Umbridge would be enough to contain Malfoy’s urge to bicker. But instead, I heard him chuckle.
I had to admit that Potter had a point. But, personally speaking, I had no urge whatsoever to spend my energy on getting along with him.
I know that we’ll do it. We will kill Tom Riddle, the man who is poisoning our existence. We will be free, and then – then we can stop existing.
After the formalities had been honoured, the lady left with her retrieved purse. I almost felt sorry for the unskilled thief: he was definitely not used to stealing things. But I still wasn’t going to let him go: the lack of experience was no excuse.
Finn sighed and glanced back at Annalise. She rolled her eyes, meaning to be dramatic, but Harry wasn’t that easily fooled.
“Do you have a warrant?” he asked calmly.
Harry chuckled at the lyrics and caught himself thinking that despite the suspicious attitude of the barmaid he liked this place. The people around looked chill and happy, the beer was good, the guy on stage was dancing his ass off – Harry made a mental note to add another sickle to the “artist fund” or whatever it was called.
Harry ignored the guess, even though it hit close to home. The weirdness of the situation was bothering him more and more. Who was this Malfoy, sitting next to him? Why were they having a calm conversation? What’s with the ring in his nose, goddamn it?!
Harry shifted on the ground to face Draco.
“Ron, Harry, I’m so happy for you!” Hermione finally made it through the crowd of our drunken classmates and hugged us, just like when we were eleven.
It seemed like Potter had really grown up. After the remarkable fight on Sunday he wasn’t responding to any provocations. Instead, he kept waving them away with a joke. Seeing him this way made me feel a little guilty for my earlier childishness. At least, that’s how I felt Monday morning: a child compared to the condescendingly smiling Potter.
“I…” he stuttered.
Harry thought of the ministry workers and their tired faces, the Auror raids, the reports and the awkwardness with Ginny.
“Well, looks like the Blacks didn’t get their money’s worth, did they,” he stated mockingly.
“Well… Remember I went to a festival last week?”
“The scumbag let you go alone?!” you yell when I’m back from another fight, all covered in blood.
“I’m on it,” I nodded readily. Harper paused by the door and added, “By the way, Harry, it’s been some time now since I’ve started working with this public defender, Mr. Green. I’d appreciate it if you tried to find common ground with his assistant.”
as you say?”
Finn took out a cigarette and lit it with his wand.
“C’mon, guys, this conversation is far from new.”
“Hi,” Hermione said without looking up – she was searching for something in her bottomless purse. She finally gave up with an exasperated sigh and added, “Harry, we brought you some souvenirs, but I honestly can’t handle looking for them right now. You mind?”
“Wanna dance?” she asked with no hint of shyness. I gave her a long glance.
“This is the last one I’ve got.”
“Shit, shit, shit!” he swore. “How did he find me?”
When the kiss finally ended, Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s neck, his forehead against Harry’s, and whispered:
“Firstly, why would I tell you that? You’re the Auror, I’m the public defender, I really don’t see why I should be sharing such things with you.” Malfoy glanced at me as if I was stupid – again. “Secondly, I don’t know. I haven’t spoken to him yet.”
He ran his hands through his hair and looked at Harry.
“Oh,” Harry realised he didn’t even think of them as a couple. “I didn’t know they were together. Anyway, it sucks that they can’t get married.”
She looked at me, waiting for an answer. I winced: a year ago or so she forced me to rearrange things at Grimmauld place. We got rid of the elf heads, changed the wallpaper and the upholstery and so on, but to me the house remained one of the most unpleasant places on Earth. I felt better in the cupboard under the stairs, if you ask me. Hermione was driven by the thought that it was my only house, and that I would end up living there one day, but I was in no hurry. Sirius died six years ago, and I was constantly stumbling upon things that reminded me of him - not to mention the headquarters of the Order, where every single object used to belong to him.
“I do, and you better have a good reason to be here.”
“I can’t leave you alone with him. He’s… crazy.”
Harry hesitated for a second, then took the hand rolled cigarette and sat down on a concrete block nearby. Malfoy joined him, settling down cross-legged.
wouldn’t care? I don’t buy it, Potter, sorry.”
Malfoy turned to face Harry, his eyebrows lifted.
Malfoy smiled with the corner of his lips.
“You’re getting more and more impudent,” he grunted, when I turned the tap on and started washing my face. I turned to look at him: he stood in the doorway, rubbing his neck.
“Hardly. You said that.”
“I don’t take orders from you!” Emmet growled.
“Potter, come here!” I yelled.
“Malfoy, what do I care about thirty galleons! You should’ve thought it through.”
“Mum, I’m not leaving.”
“Mr. Potter, unfortunately, I can’t agree with your terms.”
Harry took a deep breath and told them everything: about the music, the casual and strange encounter with Draco; he also told them about the party at the flat, the Barrel and the Auror raid.
“HEY!” Harry yelled at the Auror in charge, stepping out of the garage and feeling his wand under his sleeve. “Emmet, what’s going on here?!”
Harry stuck his hands in his pockets, not quite sure if he could stay. Fortunately, Malfoy looked up at him almost at once.
Melissa lit up, twittered something about being happy to help if necessary and disappeared behind the door. It hasn’t escaped my notice that Potter’s eyes casually slipped down her figure.
“I wasn’t really expecting an answer,” chuckled Potter. In a swift movement that made me think that he was used to cooking he put the eggs and the bacon on a plate and sat down in front of me. He looked amusing: even more dishevelled than usual, with red marks of the pillow all over his cheek. He began to eat, paying zero attention to my interested gaze. The smell of freshly fried eggs went up my nostrils; if it was Theo or Greg, I would have demanded a bite by now, but there was no way I’d ask Potter to share. So I had no choice but to get up and take care of myself.
“I know – I figured maybe it’s your grandparents’ house. Since it obviously is an old pureblood house,” Annalise explained.
“Google it!”
Malfoy froze in the doorway of his room.
“No, I know. I’m thinking of Annalise and Finn.”
“Hey,” Harry said, as soon as Annalise and Finn were close enough to hear him.
“I can’t, I’m about to make eggs,” I tried to explain.
“No, they’re just being dicks.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on, Malfoy, will you help?”
“Damn. I’ve already forgotten that we’re working together today.”
“You bet.”
Harry didn’t answer. It was Malfoy – there was no way Harry would not recognise him – but it wasn’t the Malfoy he was used to at Hogwarts. The expensive suit was gone; instead, he was wearing baggy clothes and a pair of sneakers, his nose was pierced, and a magic tattoo shimmered on his neck. Wow, those were unexpected changes.
“You really are a Muggle,” Malfoy said, contemplating my efforts. “Are you going to cook?”
“Everything went fine, they hired me,” I said in an overly cheerful voice.
Harry followed Draco through the dark corridor. The room turned out to be small, with only a bed, a desk and a closet. Malfoy put the bottles on the desk, stepped on the bed to get to the window and opened it; the smell of rain filled the room, and a fluffy but a little damp cat leapt on the windowsill from the outside.
“Did you tell him?” he hissed at her.
“Malfoy, here’s the deal: I comply to all your idiotic rules, and you don’t insult my friends. It’s not that difficult. Don’t act childish, will you?”
Draco jumped, his eyes wide open.
“I was here first.”
I exist when I march down the long hallways of Hogwarts. On the right there’s Ron, telling me what in his opinion Ginny and Dean are up to; on the left there’s a group of Hufflepuffs, planning a party. I exist when Professor Sprout explains the difference between the ordinary and the biting yarrow, and Neville is happy to help her replant the biting one into a bigger pot.
“I’ve been offered a job at the law enforcement department and at the underage magic control department. I haven’t decided yet,” Hermione told us. “Harry, when do you start?”
We washed up in silence, glancing at each other from time to time. Yesterday I understood several things. Firstly, I was surprised to discover that there was nothing left of the school hatred I used to have for Malfoy. One fight was more than enough to blow off the steam and stop the useless picking on each other. Secondly, Malfoy has changed a lot in the three years that we spent apart, and it wasn’t just about the looks. The important thing was that he seemed to have grown up: the impeccably respectful, even though a bit ironic tone at work was a perfect illustration of it. The fact that he was good at his job was another thing I was surprised to discover.
“What are you doing?” I asked.
“I get it. I used to hate this house so much. Sirius hated it, too. Frankly, maybe that’s why I still haven’t done anything to make it feel like home. I just got rid of the creepy stuff when the old elf died.”
“I am. We even get paid sometimes.”
She was in the elevator with me. She really has changed: got a haircut and looked nicer than before.
“Thanks,” she put the folded paper in the pocket of her jacket.
“I’ll get the dishes, I guess they’re dirty,” he said and ran off. Draco sat down on the floor in front of Annalise, and Harry settled down next to him. The necessity to use Confundus on a Muggle doctor didn’t make sense to Harry. He couldn’t even think of a reason to choose Muggle doctors over qualified Healers.
“Yep,” Harry reacted instantly, and they Disapparated, leaving the edge of the lake as deserted as it was before their arrival.
“Lower your wand first, Potter,” he did it.
“And these are all the belongings of the national hero?” I drawled, looking at Potter who showed up with just a backpack of clothes. I was sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading the
Thinking of responsibilities felt almost physically suffocating. Harry only managed to cope with the pace of Auror duties because Ron was there to cheer him up, plus, Dennis’ stupid ideas kept him from feeling trapped in the routine. On top of the difficult job, Kingsley somehow talked Harry into attending one official event after another, where he was forced to smile, keep a straight face and politely answer tactless questions. By the way, wasn’t there another dinner planned this weekend?..
Now that the pressing issues, such as getting along with my new flatmate, were gone, for the first time since I settled down here I asked myself what I was going to tell Ron and Hermione. I was surely not going to tell them I was living with Malfoy – this would require a lot of explanations which would all end up sounding fake. Ron and I usually had a beer every weekend; I guess I could simply tell him that I rented a place in Muggle London, without going into the details. I doubted I would stay here for another month, so I wouldn’t need to stick to this half-truth for too long.
“Aren’t you going to take a break?” asked Ron, surprised.
The piece of paper glowed in Harry’s hands. He hadn’t heard of the bands listed on it. It seemed like music has took several steps forward since Harry had last listened to the radio at the Burrow.
“Why not,” Harry was relieved that he wasn’t the only one hoping for some privacy.
“Bennet won’t accept it, apparently. I found out a few days ago that he told the staff I was taking a week off.”
“It’s not what I thought it was,” Harry answered. “It’s all about being rough and following orders. I’m not good at following orders.”
“Yeah.”
“I didn’t ask if Kingsley would approve,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I asked if
or you can bid your inheritance good-bye!”
“Well… yeah, I guess you can say so,” Finn chuckled, then caught her fingers and kissed them.
… I sighed in relief and chuckled nervously. Was that all? I was just imagining things.
“See you, Potter,” Malfoy muttered and ran up the stairs. He didn’t want her to see us together – I could understand that. Had I spotted Neville or Dean, I might have done the same thing.
Draco chuckled, and Harry smiled, glad that he managed to cheer him up with a dumb joke.
“True,” I conceded. I was in no mood to bicker: the food smelt great, and my stomach rumbled in anticipation.
“I thought this was your last one.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” I insisted. “I’m a Malfoy, and I’m going to live in the manor.”
“Everybody has reasons, but not everybody uses them,” he replied.
“I don’t care if it’s a dress for her or shower curtains for our flat, Harry. I’m not doing this alone.”
“You found it?” he asked incredulously as he entered the kitchen.
The guy took a long drag on his cigarette, threw his head back to look at the dark sky and replied:
beer.”
I stumbled on the last word, but it was the truth. The bitter, horrible truth.
“How do you three know each other?” Ron asked as he was pouring the wine into the glasses.
“What do you want to do, Harry?” Finn asked.
“I’m sorry,” he said, taking Draco’s hand. “On the bright side, you get to do whatever you want with your hair.”
“Malfoy, have you seen my watch?”
I left my drink on the table, put an arm around my new acquaintance and headed to the dancefloor.
“See you, Harry,” Annalise waved before stepping in the fireplace with Finn. Harry waved back, and they disappeared in the flames.
“Not this year,” I replied.
Harry nodded and hurried to get dressed as well.
We agreed. Well, agreed is a strong word. In reality we just went to our rooms and avoided each other until next morning.
“You shouldn’t speak with your mouth full, Potter. Even if it’s full of toothpaste,” he couldn’t help smiling. I caught my reflexion in the mirror and snorted: there was toothpaste all over my chin. Point taken.
The silence was a bit awkward. Annalise sipped from her bottle and glanced at Finn. Harry started putting the figures back into the box.
“I see.”
Draco picked up some pebbles and tossed them into the lake, one after another.
Several minutes later I had already brushed my teeth and come downstairs, hoping to find something to eat. Quite predictably, Malfoy was already in the kitchen making coffee. I made my way past him to the fridge and opened it.
“Yes, you are. That apartment belongs to me. I will show you the place and change the protection charms, so that Lucius won’t be able to find you there.”
Malfoy headed to the living room, yelled, “TONY, THEY’RE HERE!” and gave a hug to each of the guests. Harry nodded awkwardly, clutching his beer, trying not to stare too much as Malfoy introduced him to the others.
It was important to me to stay formal with Potter, at least when Mr. Green was around, so as soon as we entered the office, I greeted him with a “Good morning, Mr. Potter”. I could see his lip curl in amusement, but he accepted the rules. It has been some time now since we started the discussion.
“Hell no!” Harry shook his head fiercely.
“Malfoy?”
,” he sighed, finally. “Can’t
Hi everyone! :3
“I was, but that was a long time ago,” Harry said, as Malfoy covered his face with his hands and let out a muffled laugh.
“Get used to it.”
“I’d have to hire a professional to do so. I work at a bar, you know. None of us have this kind of money.”
We glared at each other for several seconds. Then Potter checked the plate above the door and asked:
“You did break up with Weasley, though.” Malfoy said as he got up, took the pans off the fire and cleaned the stove with a spell. He didn’t ask anything, but Harry could tell he was curious.
“You are an assistant public defender,” I corrected him. “Let me guess: Mr. Green’s assistant?”
“And don’t leave your stuff all over the place,” I added as we went down the stairs.
The cat started purring and rubbed its head against Malfoy’s chin. Harry couldn’t help smiling, looking at the expression of pure delight on Draco’s face.
“Auror Potter. Could you please introduce yourself, mister…?” I demanded in an official tone. The young man flinched and tried to run away, but he didn’t go far – I was prepared for this and shot him with Incarcerous. Ropes swung out of my wand and tied the guy’s hands and feet together. He stumbled and fell face forward – I barely had the time to do a cushioning charm so that his nose could remain intact.
Ron was right: the party was a success. Even I – the guy who usually stays on the sidelines – had a lot of fun. We drank a lot, danced a lot and laughed a lot. However, in the morning my head felt like it was going to explode, and I had a hard time finding the hangover potion, but I couldn’t deny that it was a great graduation party. Despite my concerns, yesterday’s blondie didn’t ask for a way to contact me again. I felt incredibly lucky: usually girls tend to get their hopes high, and the fact that I’m a national hero doesn’t really help. But again, yesterday, everything was perfect: the music, the drinks, the cute girl by my side…
Annalise finally managed to put her hair up and nodded.
“In the cupboard above the sink.”
“Why?” I asked. “Why are you doing this?”
“Did you get your hair done?” I asked mockingly.
“Good.”
“I just assumed that his life is a mess right now. I’m sure he’ll confirm this,” Malfoy shrugged.
Annalise nodded and looked around.
I keep the Floo powder in the cupboard - another one of the consequences of living among Muggles. Last time a neighbour came in – she was out of salt – and asked me what it was. Of course, I got away with it. I guess I told her it was powdered quartz. But then I had to come up with an explanation of why I needed powdered quartz… If it wasn’t for my skill of winning people over when necessary, she and her incessant questions might have stuck around all afternoon. Since that day I lock everything up. Just in case.
“Hi,” he replied automatically. I loosened my tie and sat down in the armchair, stretching my legs. First, Malfoy didn’t react to my presence, but after about two minutes let out an irritated sigh.
“Congratulations! Che-e-e-e-ers!”
Draco laughed again.
“Want one too? I can give you the artist’s contacts.”
“How come you don’t want your family heritage?” Harry asked. “I mean, I understand it perfectly, it’s just that you were so… sure about it before.”
As I was pouring the hot drink in a cup, someone knocked loudly on the door. I jumped in surprise, spilling some on the table. I tried to reach for a rag, but the coffee pot slipped out of my hand and burnt my finger. I swore loudly, dropped everything, and went to open the door. If that’s that neighbour again, I decided I would say that I have no more salt: I’m on a new Japanese diet. And I will definitely not explain the details.
A loud bang on the gate made her jump. Finn swore, and Harry saw him draw his wand.
“No problem,” Harry assured him. “Ron, Hermione, meet Annalise and Finn.”
“No, you are actually right. My godfather left me this house, and he was pureblood.”
“Any details?” I asked.
“By the way, Harry, what did you decide about the house?” asked Hermione. “You’ll definitely have to live there now.”
“Do you want a drink?” he asked.
A few hours later Harry stepped out of the fireplace of Draco’s flat and instantly tripped over a pile of books.
“Have you heard the rumours about Ravenclaw’s new strategy? I hope the chasers will keep up! You’ll have to be quick with the Snitch,” Seamus taps me on the shoulder, and I nod, pretending that I am fully following the conversation.
“But you are not mistaken. I am renting a room.”
“Damn, all these years I was so sure you were straight,” Draco muttered to himself.
“Pick something and do it. It doesn’t matter what, as long as it’s something you really want.”
Draco let out a bitter laugh.
I shrugged.
Hermione shrugged. “It’s easier to buy everything at once. I don’t want to come back here twice a week.”
“What are you doing here?” he heard Draco ask.
Draco waved his wand and a pack of beer, as well as the pans full of noodles and vegetables flew in the room and landed on the table, pushing the pile of books off. Tony grabbed the books and shoved them under the sofa.
"They grow up so fast." Hagrid teared up and hugged Draco as well, patting his back gently.
Mum, I am very sorry to say that I will no longer be around to help you with the garden, or around the manor. I do wish that Harriet will be an amazing companion for you, and will help take care of you better than Father will. I truly do apologize to Harry's friends, I still feel guilty even if I did change. Luna and Neville, you two were probably the only ones who definitely saw me as a different person when I first apologized, thank you both for becoming my friends. Pansy, you knew I wasn't straight after a few years of obsessing over me. The day you did learn that was the same I figured out I had the Hanahaki Disease. "Bloody Potter." Was the first thing you said before helping me, it was rather funny. Blaise, take care of Pansy. You were really close to her as was I, but knowing her, she would probably be screaming at my dead body by now, and then move onto blaming Harry. Which Harry is not to blame! Thank you for helping me through the panic attacks and keeping me on track during the war, no matter how many times we argued with each other and how many times I pushed you away, along with others, you still stayed acting as if nothing happened but you were clearly worried for me. Weasley Family, I thank you as well. You all helped me through the pain, as well as Mum. George, you were a great friend and I'm sorry for leaving, I don't mean to. Ginny, I apologize for being the way I am, but I couldn't exactly control the persona pushed onto me since birth. Molly, I will miss your meals while eating with Arthur who talked about the good things at the ministry. Both of you please keep an eye on my Mum, would you? Hermione I already spoke to you, and don't exactly have anything to say to Ronald. Dudley, I've already spoken to you back at the cafe. Currently, I'm probably apologizing to Harry, and apologizing on your part as well. After all, you may not even be in the manor. Father might have tossed you out already, unless he is up in his study scowling and being negative and cold as always. Do visit Mum for tea, she would love you! Father, I'm sure you snatched this from Mum to rip it up. Screw you. You are absolutely terrible, I could probably give at least five scrolls of parchment about how terrible you are, and about another seven of what you did wrong or how you could have changed that. Still, as a little kid I did look up to you, so please, for the better, watch over Mum and help her around. I will give an actual reason I did not want the surgery to get rid of the disease. This may sound crazy, but I thought I deserved the pain. For everything I have done, but that isn't the only reason. I never wanted to forget Harry, he was a big part of my life in all honesty. It would be weird having so many gaps in my memory, but who would want to forget the person they love? In my opinion I think it is absolutely mental that people would do that. But think of it this way, I will die in peace. Who knows, maybe I'll see Harry again, and if I do, I will gladly say hi for all of you! Again, thank you.
"So...?" Draco echoed after he didn't continue.
Dudley really wanted to sigh but he couldn't. He really wished he got over him already, it's been five years but those six to seven years of him admiring Harry couldn't be changed.
Draco nodded, taking Harry's hand that was extended back out towards him. "Gladly, Potter."
"Here. I found this under his pillow." Lucius handed her a letter that she took into her hand. She saw names written on the front in her son's elegant signature. Harriet could smell her owner's scent coming from it, and walked over, whining.
"Actually, everyone is doing better. Mum's illness got worse right after the war but she's slowly getting better. Father- Lucius, wasn't put in Azkaban like he deserves, it's where he should rot, in my opinion. But, back to what I said I was here for." Draco's small smile fell down as the flowers inside tightened.
"Are you scared... to die?" Dudley broke the silence as he stared at Draco's pale face as the smile faded away. "Yes.... I'm terrified, Dud. Will I come back as a ghost and still suffer? Or will I completely die?"
"I would've brought Harriet. You might've enjoyed seeing her. She's a pretty playful dog, golden retriever to be exact." Draco looked down at the roses, a small smile. "Mum would have loved to come, but I ran away to come here. Not like me, I know." His dull silver eyes that had a tinge of greenish blue on the very edges, began to water. "I wish I could've said this directly to you.
Dudley tapped his foot as he waited for Draco to arrive, he was sitting here for thirty-seven minutes and was debating on whether to leave, or don't.
"I think so, I had asked him the same thing but he really wanted to come. He might as well get married to your apple tree!" Narcissa joked which made the two women laugh before looking at Hermione and Ron, seeing the strange looks on their faces.
Draco shook his head as he pulled out jeans, and a hoodie.
Draco smiled slightly and walked up to him, hugging him which shocked Hagrid. McGonagall smiled proudly at the scene, but worry was in her eyes since Draco changed so much, even if he seemed better. Last time she saw him was after the war, maybe a few months. When she did visit him along with his mother to bring Lucius back to the manor from the Ministry of Magic, both looked sick, especially Draco. Narcissa had barely gotten Draco to get out of bed.
When the two pulled away Harry still had that silly smile on his face, green eyes glimmering.
Narcissa smiles to everyone nervously, she was still sitting on the couch as she felt too weak at the moment to get up, and she didn't want to disturb Harriet who had laid her head in her lap.
The amount of trauma he has was more severe than others.
"Cmon Mione, there's no way that bloody git is in love with him!" Ron protested a bit too loudly, making Hermione smack him. "It's obvious! When you mentioned Harry he began to cough, and his dog's name is far too similar! Am I right?" Hermione looked towards Draco who was gripping onto the edge of the counter for dear life.
She wished she could have lied about Harry Potter being dead. She wished he could be with her son, after all, Hermione did tell her that Harry talked about Draco a lot, how fascinating he was. Yet, he was too scared to go up to Draco and treat him like a friend. Scared that if Draco said something, and his anger flared, he wouldn't be able to control his next action considering his anger issues had gotten bad during the war, and Malfoy just tinkered with it. Hermione told her that she understood Harry, and why he said that. Considering she had been told about Harry's childhood as well, that was probably the reason for his anger issues and the war added onto his stress and fear which for him, turned into anger that was waiting to spill out.
"Well I have to get going. I'll see you later.... maybe?" Dudley stood up along with Draco, hugging each other. "Haha maybe." Draco said sarcastically before they both left the coffee shop.
Draco snapped himself out of the small trance and clearly his throat as he shifted in his seat. "And uhh... I got a call from the doctor. About the scan they did on me on Tuesday."
"So Mum! How ya been?" Ron asked his wonderful mother. "I'm doing better! Narcissa has helped me a lot as well as your father."
McGonagall chuckled. "Shall we get going?" She asked kindly. The other two nodded and separated, following her into the castle.
There are three places where the flowers can grow.
"At least this is calmer than my funeral." The spirit of Harry suddenly appeared, a few meters behind him. Draco was even more shocked as well, but as Harry extended out a hand for Draco to come and take, he looked back at his mother, he didn't feel like leaving entirely. But one sentence helped him.
The roses that were still on Draco's spirit began to wilt, falling off and fading away. "You're free now. Just like they said." Harry smiled. "No more death eater, no more Malfoy persona. You get to be yourself. Free!" Draco began to cry while laughing, and soon it came to just crying. Harry was correct, he was free. The warmth that Harry gave him in an embrace was meaningful. He felt loved, but not in pain anymore.
"You're in love with Harry, you have Hanahaki Disease!" Hermione declared in shock, seeing the petals that had been coughed out reminded her so much of Harry.
"We have three baskets of apples... for what?" George looked at the blonde that shrugged and grabbed the apple he had been eating before, to continue eating it.
"Harry!?" Ron perked up, he misheard what she had said.
"Perfect." Draco said sarcastically. "First, I'm awaken from a wonderful dream. Next, my father just had come along with us when it's my therapy, that Mum takes me to. So that bloody git has to ruin it." Draco rolled his eyes and Dudley smiled hearing he had a good dream. The two known each other for five years so they were a bit close. "What was your wonderful dream about?"
Narcissa snapped. "How do you know!? He isn't anywhere in the manor, even Harriet can't find him! You've never cared for Draco, even when you forced him to become a Death Eater. You have never cared about him as he was being tortured in the chambers by the Dark Lord! You've never cared about anything! You've never cared about this family, about me or your son. You are a selfish prick who only cares about yourself, and your bloody reputation! God damnit!" Narcissa shoved him away and Lucius, his the fact that her words hurt, even if he was angry about what she said.
But that's besides the point.
Draco's flowers grow in his lungs which is really common, though, they are beginning to form around his heart as well.
"Maybe." Draco sighed. "Could be from the spell when he almost killed me." He shrugged and went back to eating.
Ron and Hermione were heading to visit Molly, they were supposed to be staying the night Friday(last few chapters basically) but they both got caught up in work, so they were staying the night tonight; Saturday. Molly currently was at her home, eating breakfast with Narcissa, who was lucky to come. After the war, the two became great friends and Molly began to treat Draco like her own son. George and Draco got along now, but Draco did sometimes get annoyed by him, even if he did change as well because  of the death of his twin; Fred.
Ron was about to whisper something in Hermione's ear about her, but she smacked him before he could. "Bloody hell woman." He muttered. "I didn't even say a thing!"
Narcissa was worried, after Molly had comforted her, she went back home along with Draco. But right now, she was tired and just wanted to be in bed, sadly, her nerves were off the charts as she paced through the halls and rooms looking for her son. Lucius, her crappy husband, was surprisingly looking around as well.
The funeral for Draco Malfoy was indeed sad, and not as big as Harry's.
Draco scoffed, he remembered the time Harry looked so annoyed with fans swarming him. It was obvious he disliked being The Boy Who Lived. Which was true, Harry only wanted a normal childhood where he wasn't always in danger and almost dying every fifteen seconds. No matter how much Harry loved magic, he often wished he was a muggle in a better family than the Dursley's. He always wished he could escape this "nightmare" and have his parents alive. They definitely seemed way better than the Dursley's, even if he had never met them, he was still heartbroken.
The war before the dark and light had recently ended. Or, that's how it still feels. To Draco it felt like it has been a day, but that wasn't true. It has been five years.
Draco coughed a bit, before trying to calm her down.
There was also a Phoenix that had been carved into the grave that flew across it.
Narcissa and a few others had put Draco in therapy. And luckily the Therapist was helping him, slowly, which is good. If it was fast, that would probably be concerning. But his therapist gave a list of many ways that could help! Narcissa had found the list three years ago, and had surprised him with a little golden retriever puppy! She remembers when Draco was a little boy, they would pull out a few muggle toys! Of course that only happened when Lucius was at work, and they could only play with them for a little bit. But his favorite toy was a golden retriever plushie.
Yes, a disease. The disease has been with Draco since he was maybe in his third or forth year of Hogwarts. It was suffocating, literally. Hanahaki Disease. It's not common, but it does exist.
"Ronald Weasley!" Molly looked at her son in anger, she didn't need Draco's flowers to sprout even more, she still needs to ask how the last scanning was.
That one sentence made Dudley gulp, he was scared he knew what Draco was going to tell him.
Five years since he and so many other had gone through things a kid, a teenager, shouldn't have gone through. Honestly, he thought no one should have gone through that.
Lucius ran towards them, skidding down on his knees to stop right in front of Draco. He shook him a bit and then checked his pulse. His son, his only son he should've treated better; was dead. But he thought it was strange, he never knew he loved Harry, or about the disease either. Yet he knew his son was definitely in love with Harry, after all, even as he was dead it seemed as if he had a small smile rested on his face while leaned against the stone, only one black rose was coming out of his mouth and bloomed beautifully.
"That isn't why I'm here though..." Draco sighed and builder up enough courage to continue to speak. "I-I came to uhh, apologize."
Harriet looked up at Draco, as if begging to be apologized to and given pets. The young Malfoy sighed before petting her, and then combing his hands through the dog's long golden fur.
"Ah! Draco, glad to see you're here!" Arthur came from downstairs and greeted the pale blonde. "And Narcissa, how're you both?"
They all followed Harriet who began sprinting, she smelled Narcissa's scent along with Draco's. But they were all horrified at what they found.
Meanwhile... Draco was greeted by McGonagall who became the Headmistress of Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. Along with her was Hagrid, who smiled down at Draco. "I would give you a hug, but you might not like that." Hagrid said, his voice was gruff as always.
Draco turned around and looked at him, tears in his eyes as well as Harry's. "Yes.... indeed it is, Potter."
Ki (Sn3kSenpai)
The others talked, while Draco carved the apple into making it look like a lot of roses.
"We're doing great! Draco, I think you accidentally left Harriet outside." Narcissa answered Arthur's question and looked at her son since she didn't see the hyperactive dog.
Dudley wanted to apologize to Harry for all the things he has done, but he definitely wouldn't apologize on his parent's part, and he never will. Draco sympathized with Dudley one day while visiting Muggle London. They bumped into each other at a coffee shop. Draco didn't like the stories Dudley told, but some were good. Dudley was the same with Draco, he didn't like most the stories he told as well. And it was obvious that his death caused a drastic change within him.
The doctors that do scanning for the disease were really shocked he has been alive this long, though, since they're muggles they don't know of magic and it's wonders. But, the death of the one Draco loves did slow it down.
Draco may have referred himself to a wilted flower, but Harry was already regrowing a new flower, but preserving the old one to keep in the past as a memory of advancement and improvement for Draco.
"Well at least it's healthy for him! And... are you sure it's fine for him to be here? Right after I helped him he went right outside with George." Molly asked, she was really concerned for him.
~~~~~~~
When they went back downstairs, they still eyes Narcissa who gave them a smile. She was anxious that if they had this reaction with her, how would they react about with her son?
When Ron and Hermione arrived to the Burrow they greeted Molly and eyes Narcissa before going off upstairs to unpack in Ron's old room he had shared with the others.
"I had followed that Malfoy persona since I was born. Except those few times Mum played with me with muggle toys! My favorite was the golden retriever, I named the plushie Maddy. You're probably thinking why I didn't name my dog that, truth is, I named her after you, my therapist told Mum that was just a way of coping." Draco smiled a bit. "Your persona however, was 'The Boy Who Lived' you followed that persona since you were eleven. Hermione told me about your childhood. Severus never hated you by the way, I'm sure you learned that the day he died. His memories as well. He did everything he could to protect you, no matter how cold he had to be. Sev told me that he used you looking like your father as an excuse to be cold, but you were just like your mother apparently just with James's anger."
Petals fell out of his mouth and he got up, Narcissa helping him to the kitchen sink since it was the closest.
"Yeah! I mean, you bullied us- him for years! And now you suddenly claim you love him!?" Ginny hissed. Arthur was about to get onto her when Draco held his hand up as a way of saying 'it's okay.'
Harry chuckled and put his hand back in his pocket. "I heard what you said, at my grave. Is it all true?"
•Archive of our own (Sn3kSenpai)
This definitely was not was he expected at the moment. A passionate kiss, in spirit, after he watched his own funeral.
Meanwhile, downstairs Narcissa was waiting for her son, along with Lucius who insisted on coming. Narcissa didn't want her husband to come, after all, she always takes Draco to his appointments by apparting since he had stopped using any form of magic. But with Lucius coming, he would cause some problems.
He looked down at his lap, where his hands rested clutched together. His platinum blonde hair falling down in front of his eyes that began to leak those salty tears. "You're probably thinking who drank a Polly Juice Potion, huh? Well, tough luck I guess. I am indeed the bratty self-centered prat you know, or knew. In fact, my therapist said everyone had about two personalities; the one they act as, a persona given. And then their true personality, on the inside that they hide out of fear." Draco lifted his head and leaned it onto the grave.
It went silent for a bit and Dudley tried even harder to not burst into tears. He had lost his old friends right after Harry's death. They said it was stupid for him to mourn over him.
Draco began to laugh, his own dull silver eyes finally gaining a bright color to them.
They all nodded and it went silent before he spoke up again. "Actually. Will you do something for me?"
Harry walked forward and grabbed his hand, touching the Death Eater Mark that was still on his forearm. "I'm glad. Cmon! Let's go have fun!" Harry suddenly beamed up at him as he rolled Draco's sleeve back down.
Lungs are the most common and make it harder to breathe, and come out of the mouth. Well, all places the flowers come out of the mouth near the end.
"I only have a few days..."
Draco nodded as he spat out blood along with a flower petal into the sink.
Draco looked at her worriedly before Hermione spoke. "Is there anything you would like to do, on your last days?"
•Wattpad(Sn3kSenpai)
Draco nodded, setting down his utensils. "Potions and charms slow the disease down, and that's how I've been able to last this long. I don't know why I still have the disease."
This was everything he needed. He felt... whole? He couldn't describe it, even if they didn't know each other by conversing and no arguing, they definitely were in love.
Molly had just finished helping Draco get all the petals off his face, it's painful but she knows Draco hates them on his face or in his hair. After she did that Draco went outside with George to do whatever they do.
Dear everyone,
The larger man's eyes widened seeing Draco tearing up, he was honestly terrified. "Mum would be bedridden, she's sick so my death would probably do it for her. Father would make everything worse. I'm sure no one would show at my funeral! Harry may be in his grave dancing that his bully finally died, his friends would be throwing a party."
He looked down at it before looking up at the sky. "No matter how hard I had tried to hate you.... it still hurts. The flowers you love so much, tightening around my lungs and now my heart." He leaned his head against the gravestone, feeling weak as he coughed up petals. "I truly, do love you... and apologize for everything, Harry."
"I don't know." Draco sighed and continued, "Maybe go visit Harry's grave. Spoil Harriet, bet she'd love that." Draco smiled a bit, he could already see his golden retriever jumping around with her tail wagging at immense speed.
"I haven't found him! He isn't in the living room, not in his room, he isn't in any of the rooms! I checked the garden! I- I-..." Narcissa broke down into a sob and Lucius gently set her down on the couch. He was strangely acting caring. "I'm sure he is fine."
"So..." George put his hands on his hips.
The two boys were going to meet up today as well, they make a few meetings every so often to check in on each other.
"Are you okay?" Molly asked in unison with Narcissa, it was a coincidence.
Arthur looked at him worriedly when Harriet had begun to whine a bit, anytime that dog had whined it was either about Draco or the fact she was being teased, and even when she is being teased it sounds slightly different. "Maybe because the disease is latching onto any store magic, or Harry's spirit is still alive."
Hello! You're author here, this is the end of Wilted | Drarry.
Ginny was also at the Burrow, she was skeptical of Draco and still despised him for what he has done to Harry. She doesn't even know he loves Harry, only George, Arthur, and Molly do, out of the Weasley family of course.
Draco took the apple out of his mouth, quickly swallowing the part he bit off and greeted him as well. "Arthur, good morning! You missed breakfast, as you can tell." He motioned towards the kitchen where Molly had magic working to wash.
"Good." Ginny hissed before slamming her utensils down and stomping upstairs.
Draco blushes but nodded, and he was about to give a verbal answer, Harry suddenly stopped and pulled him down.
Draco took a quick glance at his father, but once he saw that he was looking at him, he looked towards the ground and walked up next to his mother.
Everyone grabbed onto him, and Harriet put her paw on his foot, apparting with them.
"So... how're you today?" Dudley asked, sounding a bit cautious.
FANFICTION WRITTEN BY:
"No, it's Harriet. Don't worry, when Draco named her I had the same reaction!" Narcissa smiled and that made Ron sink back down in his seat, and Hermione grabbing his hand to comfort him.
"Hogwarts." Lucius answered. "If you want to come grab onto me, or each other."
"How would you like to spend your last few days?" Dudley asked as he teared up, the blonde across from him seemed relieved to die.
The Boy Who Lived
Draco gave a very small dry chuckle as he stared down into his tea, thumb rubbing against the rim of the mug which was warm in his grasp. "Harry." He said which made a small smile appear on his pale face.
Narcissa stood up immediately and walked outside so she could cry. Molly was already in tears as well as Arthur. While Arthur stayed inside, his wife went outside to be with Narcissa and comfort her even while crying.
"Yes." Draco answered as he helped George carry the apples into the kitchen.
Narcissa giggled at them. "You may both call me Narcissa, no need to be so formal! But I've been doing better, Im not as bedridden as when the war ended. Harriet has helped us all."
I was wrong: he had changed.
If someone had asked me several years ago how to find a stolen purse, I would have suggested buying a new one, but now I knew that the chances of catching the thief weren’t completely inexistent. I questioned the lady about the contents of her bag. She mentioned a couple of galleons, lipstick, tissues and other stuff people usually have in their bag, and – fortunately for me – a Sneakoscope. Any Sneakoscope would vibrate and glow if the bag it was in was getting stolen, reacting to the presence of the thief. But a decently manufactured one would continue to glow and vibrate even when the owner wasn’t near anymore, if the person had had it long enough. According to the lady, it’s been several years since she first put the device in her purse and she never took it out.
He blinked and looked down, and Harry wondered if he was about to tear up.
“Tinky,” I heard Malfoy say, and a crack of Apparition followed – he must have summoned a house elf. “Bring me dinner, please. Oh, and make it a big dish, I’m hungry.”
If someone asked Harry what he was doing here, he would struggle with an answer, although his memory was perfectly fine. It’s just that he wouldn’t be able to explain his actions with the usual pragmatic reasons. He wasn’t on a mission, he wasn’t working undercover, he wasn’t meeting a friend. Damn, he couldn’t even blame it on Dennis – his colleague – who usually tried to get him into some weird-looking places with the basic excuse of all time: “I’m curious.”
“Could you?” he asked.
Inside, it was quite crowded; Harry made his way to the bar and looked at the menu. It said as follows:
Malfoy had dropped the snobby attitude that used to piss me off so much. I came to the conclusion that he didn’t hate me anymore either, and the bickering was more of a habit than the reflection of what he really thought. Well, and I didn’t mind the bickering – it was fun, if you ask me.
father would definitely consider a riot.”
“Isn’t it hilarious that I know it and you don’t?” he took a sip from his bottle. “It’s like a library search spell, but on the computer. I’ve never used it, though.”
“I think he owes me more,” Harry shrugged. “Besides, it’s-”
“And I am sure, it is awful.” He smiled and leaned back on his chair, looking at me with interest. “He isn’t a robber, if you ask me – if you know what I mean.”
wine!” Harry waved his wand, hoping there was another bottle in the cupboard. A loud noise down the hall indicated that the spell worked. Hermione let out a muffled “Yes!” when she saw a bottle of red fly into Harry’s hand.
“Okay, okay. I’ll rent a place in a Muggle area.”
“Mhm,” he didn’t even look up.
At first, we didn’t notice anything: we were just happy he was back, but then it started. He would ramble, unprompted: The Dark Lord was a genius, Fudge was a brilliant politician, Dumbledore was an old idiot, appointed as headmaster of Hogwarts due to a terrible misunderstanding. Mum and I kept quiet, thinking that he would calm down if we let him get it all out, but things only became worse. He started demanding that we join him in the admiration of the Dark Lord’s ideas. Then, one day, I snapped: said what I really thought and told Dad that his ideas were outdated. Neither me nor Mum will ever forget the scene he caused. He had threatened me with everything from disowning to Avada, while poor Narcissa sat there paper-white. She later confessed that she had been afraid Lucius would really kill me. Maybe I would’ve been scared as well if I hadn’t been so damn angry.
“Hypocrisy?” I squinted suspiciously. Was he about to pick a fight?
“It was a last-moment decision.”
“We aren’t exactly in good terms right now. I’ve been ignoring him for a while, to be honest.”
Harry smiled, thinking to himself that the scene was really sweet, but didn’t say it out loud – they had just met, and he was afraid that would sound embarrassing.
“Well then, shall we leave it to the judge?” he said.
“Sold,” Annalise jumped to her feet and headed to the gate, dragging Finn with her. Harry chuckled and followed.
Emmet scowled at Harry. Harry glared back, and Emmet ended up swearing and walking away, followed by the other Aurors.
Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s forearm, forcing him to stop talking.
Harry shook his head, and Draco continued.
“Or with a public defender. I’ll get your ass in court in one minute for violence,” I responded. There’s no way I’ll let him threaten me.
“Potter?”
I nodded, and she left me sitting on my bed, trying to wrap my brain around what had just happened. Things I’ve always considered inviolable shattered to pieces because of my father’s insanity. The same evening, Narcissa took me to Eaton Mews South. I took almost nothing with me – I guess I was hoping I’d come back soon. However, after two weeks of independent life I was not that eager to return to the manor. And now, six months later, there was no way I’d accept to live in the manor again.
“I did. We yelled at each other in front of the whole damn department. I guess he’s just hoping I’ll cave in.”
“Maybe in the kitchen?”
And he stared at me, most definitely enjoying the confused expression on my face.
“From now on, you are the best chess player I’ve ever met,” Harry declared. “Sorry, mate.”
I left the lady to Harper and strode away through the crowd, and as luck would have it, barely three streets away from Fortescue’s café, I spotted him: a clumsy-looking, skinny guy was trying to find something in a trembling bag. I approached, clutching my wand in the pocket of my robes.
She smiled and put her hand in Ron’s. I went back to the table with the drinks and ran into Seamus, who’d studied in the Auror Office with us.
This was the final straw. Harry strongly felt that if he didn’t go out and unwind right now, he wouldn’t be able to make it until the end of the week. He thanked the barman, grabbed the flyer and went out the back door to Disapparate, without letting himself think it through.
“Reading about crimes, Malfoy?” I asked. Who knows, maybe he’d answer?
“Harry, are you going to run off your own graduation party? I don’t think so,” Ron shook his head sceptically. “Besides, I have nothing to say against a bender.”
A last loud bang – Harry recognized Bombarda – and the gate flew open. A group of Aurors marched into the yard, wands out, and started casting spells at whoever was still within reach; people started running, and Harry got a weird sense that the situation wasn’t new to anyone: the Aurors were too calm, the people at the bar dodged the spells too well. This was definitely not something Harry’d expected to happen. He felt his blood rush up to his cheeks. He couldn’t think of an excuse of what was going on: even if the bar wasn’t paying its taxes, the people on the dance floor had nothing to do with it. But the Aurors continued to shoot
After work, I decided to have a pint in one of my favourite bars. It seemed like Potter’s got himself a girl – or at least it was definitely going to happen soon – which reminded me that I hadn’t had sex in quite a long time, what with all the finals and the job interviews. Fortunately, I was always attractive enough to find a girl to dance with for the evening, and often more than dance, if I got lucky. I’d been doing so for the last couple of years and was never disappointed. The same happened tonight – I spotted a pretty brunette, and within several hours I was already at her place. While pulling off her dress, I thought to myself that I was pretty damn lucky to be attractive.
Malfoy smiled and looked down at the pavement.
to see you at work.”
I nodded. I did agree with that, that’s why I was so curious to find out why he stole that bag.
“If we were, it wouldn’t have been a smart move to invite
“But it’s not?” Harry asked worriedly.
“Fine by me,” Malfoy looked back at the stove and hid a smile.
I opened the heavy door. Malfoy was in the living room, lying on the sofa with a book called
“I want a rematch!” demanded Ron.
“I guess Draco and I are dating now.”
She waved her wand, and a parchment appeared out of thin air. Harry ran his eyes down the long roll – she was right. The bar was perfectly legal. Harry turned back to Emmet.
“So you’re a public defender now? I would never have thought…”
The first and most important inconvenience was the fact that I had to settle down in a Muggle neighbourhood. I would never have thought that I would one day learn a minimum of household charms and handle simple cooking and cleaning. Nevertheless, here I am.
“We’ll see, we’ll see.”
“Unless you have another option, yes.”
“I got a job here. Do you work here as well?”
“Long story, in both cases,” Harry said. “Now what’s really interesting, Ron: I bet you Mrs. Black’s portrait that Annalise will beat you in chess.”
“For heaven’s sake, weren’t you raised by Muggles?”
He rubbed his nose under his glasses wearily, sighed and said in a conciliatory tone:
“I’ll catch it this time! And don’t you dare tank the match!” you threaten me before the game.
“Want a beer?”
I live when you bend over me in the silence of the Slytherin dorm, where everybody except us is fast asleep. The tattoo writhes on your forearm, and the pupils of your eyes seem huge several inches away from my face, and I’m sure it’s not just because it’s dark. You bend over and kiss me again and again, without touching my lips. You’re playing with me, you pull those strings, and this is much more powerful than the Imperius curse. I live, and you smile with the corner of your lips, listening to me whisper, “I give up.”
“Of course,” he replied. The girl smiled again and gave him a flirty look.
“I didn’t win once.”
“Okay, people,” he announced, “this is Harry, he’s having a bit of a rough time these days, so I invited him over. Harry, these are my friends, Annalise and Finn.”
And even if Harry was determined to start a new life, he was in no way ready to disappoint people, so he rushed to start the conversation whenever he felt confident enough. Bennet, the Head Auror, was so surprised that he forgot the golden rule he used in all unclear situations – scare the shit out of your employees until they agree with you – and instead tried to convince Harry to take a week off before quitting the job altogether. This might have worked a week before, but Harry had reached the point where even a faint possibility of returning to the Auror office sounded like a nightmare. Harry and Bennet’s heated argument still resonated in Harry’s head when he got back home.
“No idea,” Harry replied. “Anyway, that’s fucked up. I’m going to see Kingsley tomorrow.”
Harry frowned.
We continued walking in silence for some time. I spent several minutes thinking about why Malfoy had chosen to become a public defender. Law was never one of his concerns, as far as I knew; maybe he thought that he could use these skills one day to defend himself? I glanced at him – he was walking by my side, hands in his pockets, and looked calm and satisfied. It didn’t seem like he had to defend himself. Nah, I must be missing something.
Harry’s week was full of hasty decisions and unpleasant conversations. In any circumstances would it have been joyful to break up with Ginny, knowing her explosive character, but this was the one thing that actually went well. Ginny was upset, but not surprised, as if she had seen it coming, which led Harry to believe that she understood him remarkably well.
“All right. See you around,” she seemed to have calmed down a little and went back to slicing the cheese.
“Now get out of my house,” I hissed.
By three o’clock I was so fed up with reports and series of questions, that Harper’s suggestion to go speak to Alan Mann felt like a liberation. I hadn’t thought of the paperwork when I applied for the job at the investigation department. I hope I’ll get used to it.
The bedsheets were wrinkled uncomfortably underneath Harry, and he turned on his side to face Draco, who was leaning on his elbow, his thin hair stuck to the sweat on his forehead. Harry reached out and touched the freckles on Draco’s shoulder with the tips of his fingers. How come he never noticed them before?
father! I am not ten years old, and I am not coming over to meet the Greengrasses!” Draco interjected.
“Well, then,” she hesitated for a second before continuing, “I was saying: Confundus doesn’t work, because apparently different doctors look at your file when you’re not there, so obviously they can see it’s fake. I can’t follow them around for a week just to hex them when the time comes.”
“And I’m thinking of seeing Kingsley this week about the potion.”
“I am seeing him before lunch. Do me a favour and speak to him later, will you?” he said.
“I swear, wine glasses will be your Christmas present this year, Harry,” she said. “Transfigured beer bottles are just gross.”
“That’s it, Potter. Dinner’s served.”
Breakfast was over, and I was about to leave, when I heard Potter yell:
Draco was as real as he could be, this time wearing a washed-out t-shirt tucked in his cropped blue jeans.
“Draco, dear, I hope you don’t think that I’m evicting you,” Mum spoke in such a tender tone that disagreeing with her felt almost like being rude. “But you have seen yourself what Azkaban has done to Lucius. He will never let you be.”
It’s kind of phenomenal how the bastard always finds a way to get it out of me. In the last years, I had dealt with many people who were far from agreeable, and I never had to pull my wand – words were always enough. I guess the remains of childhood hatred must have made it to the surface.
“No, I’m going to his place,” Tony replied, now adding something to one of the bowls. “Wish me luck.”
“So this is a riot?”
“I see. You’re not the Weird Sisters.”
“Melissa.”
“Potter, you don’t owe them anything.”
Yes! It happened! I finally got a public defender’s licence and, starting Monday, I work in the Ministry of magic. I wasn’t sure this was what I dreamt of as a kid, but I was overall happy with how things were going.
“Yes.”
“Distantly. Like all of the wizarding families, really,” Annalise found a pencil in her bag and was now trying to put her hair up in a bun. “The thing is, a lot of pureblood families are, so to say, traditional. In simple words, racist and sexist.”
He kissed Harry hastily on the corner of his lips and ran off. Harry sat on the bed for a bit, playing with the torn corner of his birth certificate. The cat leapt on his knees with a soft purr, and Harry scratched its ears, wondering if the corner was already torn when he got there, or if he should be blaming the fluffy one. He stroked the cat for a bit, then finally got up and went to ask Iris for the address.
“Malfoy!”
On my way back home, I saw Melissa chatting with some colleagues in a café. I smiled at her and she smiled back, but I didn’t stop to say hello: groups of girls still scared the shit out of me. I will never forget the day when I accidentally overheard Hermione, Ginny and Luna discussing some guy who was hitting on Hannah Abbot. With all due respect, girls can be mean, so I decided that I could always talk to Melissa later.
“So, where are you going to work?” he asked.
And if I managed to control myself that evening, the next day – Sunday – we ended up having a real fight. It started off with me saying something deprecating of Potter’s sacred friends. I didn’t even notice that I’d crossed the line until I ended up with Potter’s wand within an inch of my nose.
I rolled my eyes.
Draco gave him a sly look.
Hermione blinked. Ron burst into laughter, and Hermione gave him an irritated nudge. Ron managed to calm down a bit.
“Well, I actually answered an ad, but I guess it must be some sort of mistake.”
Finally, Mr. Green and Mr. Harper stood up.
Annalise swirled her glass of wine.
Finn laughed and picked up Annalise’s purse as they were getting ready to leave.
“I think posturing is your speciality,” he replied, squinting.
Hermione gave me a reproachful look. She was convinced that I was acting childish, trying to avoid things. I was ready to compromise on many things, but not on the place where I was going to live.
To say I was surprised to see Malfoy on that doorstep would have been an understatement. I couldn’t figure out why the hell I was staring at that once-hated face. The only bright thing about the situation was that the former Slytherin didn’t look too happy either. He spent some time trying to find out what I wanted from him. What could I possibly want from him?! Oh yeah – a room.
“That’s no secret,” he said. “My father seems to have forgotten how to use ordinary letters.”
“Shut up, Tony, this is not going to happen. It’s my place too, okay?” Draco hissed as he entered the living room right in time to see Harry’s embarrassed expression. Showing up at Malfoy’s was awkward enough even without witnessing a scene.
“What potion?”
“Um, can I ask you something?”
“That’s what I’ve been telling you for over an hour and a half,” I would have been annoyed, if I wasn’t so tired of the bickering.
Malfoy chuckled, and Harry stroked his shoulder, glad that he was back to normal.
“Ron!” Hermione exclaimed, but gave up almost instantly. She of all people knew that it was useless to argue with Ron on this one.
“Who the hell reads so much?” he mumbled to himself, leaning down to pick them up.
Mum smiled funnily. I wonder: how does she find this will power in herself? That’s father she is talking of. “We”. As though he was a child, unable to control himself. But kids are never this combative…
“It’s the Aurors. We have to go,” Finn clenched Annalise’s hand. “There is a way out in the back. You coming?”
From where I was sitting I could hear some bits of Mr. Green’s conversation with Mr. Harper. These middle-aged arses were betting. And on what, one might wonder?! On me and Potter! Who will give in first! Wow, when I was passing the job interview, I would have never thought that Mr. Green is capable of such a thing. This must be the influence of chatting with an Auror on a regular basis. I was pretty sure that Potter’s boss had graduated from Gryffindor – otherwise, why on earth would a grown man find this amusing?
Mr. Harper used to teach at the Auror office during my third year of studies, and we got along pretty well. So when the time came for me to look for a job, he offered to hire me as his assistant, the position being conveniently vacant.
Emmet remained silent.
“You’ll find her at the Barrel. They’re always there on Sundays.”
“No,” Annalise sighed. “It’s just that… the Blacks…”
“Don’t worry. I’ve known him for many years, I’ll manage. But you need to move on.”
“They’ve been together for four years, and I know they’d love to get married, but they can’t, because of Annalise’s papers.”
“I don’t know. I’m here for now,” I snapped back.
“I’ll stand by probation,” I replied readily. To be honest, after two hours of back and forth I felt nothing but a new-found respect for Potter’s calm and professional arguments. Perhaps, working with him wouldn’t be so bad after all.
The chill air made him shiver. He sat down on the ground and dragged Draco with him, hugging him with one arm. Malfoy closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“What?”
“You’re not the only one who likes music,” Harry answered.
“Use a glass.”
“Are you kidding me, the last day’s the best!” the barman retorted. “It’s not even 10 pm, the main set’s about to start, it’s perfect timing.”
Ron sat down on the couch next to Finn, while Harry took some of the empty beer bottles and put them in front of Hermione.
“You ruined my shirt!”
Harry glanced helplessly at Malfoy, only to find that he too found the situation amusing.
“Nice to meet you too, miss…?”
“No, not anymore.”
“If you’re into this kind of stuff, you should go here,” the guy picked up a flyer on the bar and handed it to Harry. “Today’s the last day of the festival, you shouldn’t miss it.”
“DRACO!” Iris yelled, paying no attention whatsoever to Harry’s attempts of being polite. “Sorry, you were saying?”
I finally got up from the rug in front of the fireplace and headed to the kitchen in order to make some coffee - the one remaining joy in my life.
Somebody was arguing in the hallway.
Harry spotted Annalise standing next to Finn on the other side of the dance floor and made his way through the crowd towards them, as the guy on stage started singing a new song:
“That sucks. Well, I’m sure you could find something on the black market,” Harry suggested, which made Tony, who came back with the plates, laugh out loud.
“I thought you were independent,” I replied with a chuckle.
“It doesn’t have to be all day,” Potter replied, buttoning his shirt. “We can agree on a strategy for Mann’s hearing much faster than that.”
“It’s okay, Annalise,
“I’ve got to go. Evening shift at the bar,” he explained.
“Nothing is yours in there,” Malfoy noted.
“Malfoy,
“I didn’t say he was having a difficult time,” Malfoy said cautiously. “I said he had his reasons to steal.”
“I didn’t know you had a cat,” Harry made his way around the bed to the window and stroked the cat as well.
“I am. It’s been five days since you moved in, and this is the first time I’m calling an elf.”
“What are you laughing at?” hissed Malfoy.
“That’s a slippery slope,” he said. “I stopped playing against her years ago.”
Harry shrugged.
“I’m not going.”
“Merlin, look at these famous guests, this flat has just gained in price,” Finn said to Draco. At this point, Tony entered the living room, and the edgy girl Draco called Annalise rushed to hug him.
“I hope you’re right,” Tony mumbled, mixing the batter. “Now leave me alone, please, I need this cake to be perfect.”
Walking back to the office, I wondered if it was weird to be so surprised by the fact that Malfoy turned out to be a decent public defender. I suppose I was used to him being an arse to everyone who was weaker than himself, and seeing him from a different perspective wasn’t something I was prepared for.
Harry forced himself to smile and tried to ignore the sinking feeling that Bennet was going to be pissed as hell, which meant that this was just the beginning of their problems.
“I agree. You always were a bad loser,” Hermione noted, getting up as well. “I am not passing all my free time playing chess with you just so you could win the next time.”
“Whatever,” and he strode off without even looking back at me.
Mum asked to let her know if the job interview went well. I could have “forgotten” it, but I knew she would never disturb me herself. I sighed again as I realised that talking to her is my duty. Especially considering what’s been going on in the manor lately.
“It’s the last one for strangers,” Malfoy replied and took two cigarettes out of his pocket. “Here.”
“They?” Harry repeated, amused. “They, as in ‘we, the King?’”
“Force me to do what? Marry Astoria? There are no archaic laws that would allow you to do so, and you are well aware of that.”
“Chickened out, Potter?” I enquired snarkily. For some reason, I wanted this interaction to last a little longer. Arguments with Potter reminded me of carefree times, which was strangely soothing.
I took my time to walk home. Over the last six months I had gotten used to this apartment, even though it was in the heart of Muggle London. Living next to Muggles has not proven itself contagious, contrary to my grandparents’ beliefs. I also found out one could use magic as usual on the condition of not forgetting to lock the door, charm the windows, and avoid getting friendly with the neighbours. These simple rules were a direct result of mistakes I made during my first week here - I even had to correct the memories of several a tad too nosy people.
No, this time Harry had to admit that he got here due to his own choices. First, while heading home from the Auror office, Harry thought that it would be nice to have a pint or two. But it was Monday, and his favourite pub was closed, so Harry decided that any place was good enough to have a beer. Even this bar with a neon sign and several tattooed girls smoking outside. Of course, he stood out in the crowd because of his Auror uniform, but who cares, right? Besides, he did get himself a beer, and the light electropop music was surprisingly soothing.
“This is the queer safe space,” Finn said. “We’ve been going here since Steph opened the bar five years ago.”
“I quit.”
The memory of the month when father returned after two years of Azkaban filled me with horror. I used to think that aunt Bella had always been crazy, but after observing Lucius I’m not so sure any more.
Either way, as Malfoy put it, this was none of my business.
He let the cat go; it jumped on the desk and rolled in the bits of parchment, threatening to push the bottles off. Harry reacted quickly enough: he grabbed the beer and stroked the cat again, but it was already too busy tearing up a red envelope. Harry frowned: the envelope was clearly a Howler.
“Want the same, copycat?”
“I had no idea that moving in together meant spending so much money,” I noted.
I started enjoying Potter’s presence. The self-assured boy I used to be came to the surface, and I started speaking just as I used to in Hogwarts. To be honest, it was easier this way: as soon as I put on the old mask, everything went back to normal.
“Great! Just make sure to get the Flu network.”
“These are the Head Auror’s orders.”
“Are you protecting criminals, Mr. Potter?”
Harry frowned. It’s only been a few hours. What could have happened?
“So you finally understand how the system works,” I replied sarcastically.
I finished cooking, and we started eating. Malfoy was sitting in front of me, sipping coffee from his cup, and I once again noticed the Dark Mark on his left forearm. I have seen it multiple times in the past few days and finally got used to it being an integral part of his image.
“I have to go. See you later,” I muttered as I went out of the elevator. I couldn’t stand imposing myself.
“Oh yes you are,” Lucius Malfoy said threateningly, “or I am going to force you.”
I shrugged and stepped back, letting Potter enter the flat. He hesitated for a brief moment, but gathered himself almost instantly and asked:
“So you are telling me that Weasley and Granger know you’re living with me?”
At least, that’s what I thought until Sunday.
Potter chuckled.
Suddenly, the reality of what was happening caught up with me. I was definitely not ready for this. In an hour? He has no place to live or what? Well, otherwise he wouldn’t be searching for a room… But I didn’t let my surprise show.
“Ron, stop it!” Hermione interrupted him. “Is this really the part you’re focusing on? Harry, did you say the Aurors raided the queer bar?”
“You know well enough! I have written you at least three letters-”
“Why did you quit being an Auror? You were so sure about it.”
Harry left Malfoy’s flat at the same time as Annalise and Finn and promised to drop by with the birth certificate. The next day he woke up at noon, back at Grimmauld place. He got up, showered, wrote a letter to Bennet, then to Ron and Hermione, asking if they were free – he couldn’t wait to tell them about the party, Annalise, and, of course, Draco. Hermione owled back almost at once, apologising and saying they were still out of town. Disappointed, Harry tried to read, but couldn’t stay concentrated: his thoughts slipped, and he found himself thinking of the party again and again. Finally, he decided to go back to Malfoy’s with the birth certificate – he did promise to bring it soon, so it seemed to be the perfect excuse to see each other again.
“Are you hoping I am going to accept your point of view?” I asked sarcastically.
“Really?”
Tony gave both of them an angry glare.
*the lyrics are from the song
They sat in silence for some time.
“It’s just the details. My grandparents used to have the exact same wallpaper,” she gestured at the wall on her left, right above the fireplace. “They used to brag about it for years. It was charmed to keep the colours vivid or something.”
“It’s just that I don’t get it. You were always… You’re…” Harry stumbled on his words. He didn’t know how to phrase the feeling.
wanted one.”
“Yeah, get the fuck out of here!” somebody spat out from behind.
Malfoy didn’t honor me with an answer.
“What’s the Barrel?”
Harry shrugged.
“Besides, you haven’t been five minutes here and already managed to break two rules,” I decided to change the subject. Potter stared at me, confused.
He made an inviting gesture, and Harry followed him into the kitchen, where several pans were roasting something that looked like noodles and vegetables. Malfoy cast a spell Harry was unable to identify on one of the pans, and it started tossing the veggies. Once again, Harry felt like all of this was some kind of weird dream.
“People drink milk from a glass, not from the bottle,” he explained, turning to look at me with an expression on his face that clearly meant I was stupid. I sighed, but decided not to argue.
Harry touched the glowing Apparition coordinates and tried to figure out why the idea of going to a concert was so tempting. He had never been to a festival before: Ron and Hermione weren’t outdoor people – which was totally understandable, keeping in mind the number of journalists chasing them around – and Ginny was always at some sports event. Well, and even when she was there, something felt wrong. Either way, going to a concert didn’t seem like a good idea – Harry still had to finish the report on the last mission, and sleeping before work wasn’t generally a bad thing…
“I was offered a job at the investigation department,” I said. “What about you?”
Harry looked around. The music was playing again, but the atmosphere wasn’t the same anymore: nobody seemed to want to dance; instead, people were standing here and there in small groups, speaking in a low voice. Harry caught himself thinking that he too would rather leave.
“Some old-fashioned Gryffindor hypocrisy. It reminds me of the good old days,” he gave me yet another condescending look.
“Potter thinks? Oh my… Well, maybe you do, compared to Weasley…”
“Come on. I hardly have any enemies left.”
I had no choice but to sigh resignedly: if Ron decided we were going to have fun, nothing could possibly stop him.
“Do you like her, Potter?” I snorted.
“Sure,” she put down her knife, wiped her hands on her trousers and started pouring the beer when she saw the sickle on the counter. “Oh, I’m sorry, do you have any knuts? I’m almost out of change.”
“I thought you were playing in a band with Tony.”
For the first time in the evening, Harry was glad to know what they were talking about, so he tried to answer Annalise’s question. Tony, as a Muggle-born, also had a couple of things to say, and Harry was pleased to see that they were getting along pretty well. Draco sipped his beer and smiled with the corner of his lips while he listened, and this discreet attention finally made Harry feel like he was welcome here.
“Let’s go to my room then.”
Draco tossed the last pebble into the lake, where it landed with a loud splash.
“The family wealth doesn’t cover your needs any more?” he said sarcastically.
“No I didn’t. Show me the room.”
“Yes. Everybody lies, Potter, I don’t think you are
“Stop it! What the hell are you doing?” Harry demanded.
“We’ve got a case, Harry. Let’s go,” Mr. Harper, my boss, said as he got up and put his ministry robes on.
“Of course.” Draco looked up at Harry and smiled slightly. Harry noted to himself that he never smiled that often during their years at Hogwarts.
“Then you probably should let him know,” Malfoy leaned on the wall and took another sip, looking at Harry, who was surprised to discover that the genuine interest in Malfoy’s eyes didn’t shock him anymore.
I've been having a hard time lately, so I've decided I have to finish this fic before posting it online. So the next time you see an update it's going to be the whole fic :) thanks for reading and see you in a bit!
“Let’s go somewhere,” I suggested in a low voice. “I guess there’s no other way to avoid a bender.”
“Why?”
“It is,” I grunted and sat down on a chair, waiting for him to finish – I wanted to make some coffee.
“You will have to go there one day.”
“Prepare the evidence for the trial,” Mr. Harper said, “And I’ll go and give a copy of the file to the public defender. He too has a young assistant who needs to start somewhere.”
“Be my guest,” he muttered to my back.
“And that is exactly why I’m not telling you anything.”
“So I assume what is happening here is abuse of authority,” Harry crossed his arms just like Emmet did. “Get out, all of you.”
I headed to the kitchen, ignoring Potter’s protest. There was simply no other place his goddamn watch could be. And I was right: there it was, waiting for him on top of the flat’s small, 4 foot fridge.
Harry frowned and looked at the shabby walls once again.
“So, what’s google?” he asked finally, and the question made Malfoy chuckle again.
And if he didn’t grasp it at once, I did: both of us were working in the Ministry, so we would end up walking to work the same way. Of course, he would eventually find out that walking is easier than looking for a place to Apparate in the middle of London, but I had no intention of making his thought process faster – I’ve had enough of him at home. And why in the world did he come into the kitchen and eat breakfast with me? Is he trying to cozy up and be friendly or something?
“Exactly. My parents were just the same. And the Blacks – they were one of the worst. I’ve heard stuff, trust me. So it’s kind of weird to be here.”
“No problem,” Harry replied.
“Yeah, thanks. It feels good to be outside.” Draco opened his eyes and looked around. “Where are we, exactly?”
I decided to test him and deliberately gave a price higher than the real one, but Potter nodded. I wanted to make sure he won’t forget who’s the boss here. I didn’t care if he’s a national hero – if he’s going to live here, he’ll just be a tenant.
“Nope,” Malfoy chuckled. “Even I don’t kiss people just to piss my father off. It’s more of a pleasant side-effect.”
“Let me guess: you don’t know,” Malfoy said in an ironic tone. “Well then, think.”
“You were the one who started boasting.”
Harry looked at the board, unable to understand how she could have won again. When Harry had Apparated them straight to the living room of the house on Grimmauld place – in order to avoid an awkward encounter with Mrs. Black’s portrait – Finn sat down on the couch and announced that for the sake of their relationship he never played chess with Annalise, and now Harry understood why. Nobody likes losing all the time.
Harry was a bit confused: he was under the impression that Draco’s issues with his parents were a matter of the past, but, obviously, that wasn’t the case.
“No one can force you to get married.”
Malfoy's shoulders dropped and he seemed to relax a bit.
“Shit. Thanks, Iris!”
“I hope you didn’t get yourself cursed in the process,” Annalise said. It seemed like she was feeling better again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t need your money, father. Not in exchange of my life, no thanks.”
“Maybe another time,” Finn said in a low voice, and Harry nodded as he got up to hug Hermione, then Ron.
“No, I’m covering up from the sun,” he replied sarcastically. “Merlin, Potter! I’m a public defender, remember? I have to go through the basics from time to time.”
“Oh, okay. Have we met?”
“Potter? Not thinking? See now
“I could ask you the same question,” he snapped back.
a better approach in her article!”
“Look who’s talking!” exclaimed Ron. “You couldn’t sleep for a whole damn week when you thought Amanda
“Since I was a kid. Well, I knew I liked boys – I don’t think I knew it was called gay back then.”
The clock showed a quarter to eight. I had to be at the Ministry at half past eight. How was I going to get there?
“Of course I’m not upset, Harry. Live where you please! But for Merlin’s sake, be careful.”
“Draco, hello,” she said and smiled awkwardly. “What’s new?”
“Why, isn’t she pretty?” he answered, unfazed.
“Or we could go to my place. I’ve got food and beer and chess…” Harry suggested.
Something in his voice sounded familiar, so Harry made a step forward.
“Where does it all come from?” Harry asked. “Why do you look like this?”
“Never mind. Does everybody yell in this house?”
“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll kill you. I am a former Death Eater,” I smirked and noted to myself that he really hadn’t changed a lot, at least as far as I was concerned.
Annalise was thrilled, but Harry barely noticed it, because Draco’s hand was stroking his knee under the table. A faint memory of a Ministry dinner he was supposed to attend tonight crossed Harry’s mind, only to leave him truly satisfied with the fact that he missed it. He was far more comfortable here, sitting on the floor, talking of things he barely heard of before, feeling the tips of Malfoy’s fingers on his knee. It all felt right.
Harry shook his head.
“I want my son to be happy,” she replied simply and got up.
The Mark made me think of work.
I ignored the sarcastic tone and ran up the stairs. It looked like tomorrow wouldn't just be a boring day of paperwork after all.
Ron stopped smiling.
“It’s going to be fine, I’m sure. You should see the way he looks at you,” Draco assured them.
Assistant public defender – that’s my new title. Well, I guess it will suit me well enough.
“Ah, isn’t it Henry’s birthday?” Draco asked as he opened the fridge to get the beer. “Is he coming over?”
It so happens that I live only when you’re around.
Malfoy continued to look at me.
“Like Draco’s family,” Harry said.
“What reasons?” I was genuinely curious.
“Yeah, we’ll have to wait till there’s a trans potioneer for that,” Annalise concluded. “In the meantime, I’m stuck with the Muggles. By the way, anyone knows what a birth certificate is supposed to look like?”
“Because St. Mungo’s doesn’t give a shit about trans people. If you want your hormones, you better not be scared of Muggles,” he explained. Harry had already heard of trans people before – probably via Hermione, but he thought it was a Muggle thing.
“Melissa,” Potter repeated and smiled widely. Not a hint of the irony I always get.
“Um,” I drawled, trying to figure out a way to prove him wrong, “They know I’ve rented a place in Muggle London.”
An accusatory tone, of course. Your grey eyes reflect the light of the candle, and you act like you’re mad – I still can’t figure out why you enjoy pretending to be the victim so much.
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY!” the visitor bellowed, and Harry recognized the voice at once. It was Lucius Malfoy.
“Yeah, um… Sirius Black was my godfather.”
I gazed at her, astonished. Never has she said before that Lucius’s made mistakes.
“So are you coming back in a week?”
Harry sighed and put down his bottle.
“C’mon, you didn’t even believe we could do it,” Ron teased her – he had endured a whole month of Hermione’s lectures on how he was lazy and disorganised. Obviously, it wasn’t true; it’s just that he and I were both so ready for the finals and could’ve not even opened our textbooks, but who on earth was able to explain such a thing to Hermione?
“Potter, your key,” Malfoy pointed at the small round table just inside the apartment’s open door. I looked around and grabbed the key I had almost forgotten.
Hermione turned to Harry and gave him a curious look.
Harry looked at the board, once again, impressed. Annalise was rolling a cigarette, and Ron was still in the process of accepting his defeat.
“Not at all! I think I’m out of beer, though… Let’s see…
Emmet crossed him arms on his chest.
“Do we have to go through this?” he sounded annoyed.
Harry didn’t regret once that he had come. The music was really good, the people in the crowd didn’t care about who he was, and for the first time in his entire life Harry felt like he could do whatever he wanted, without caring about what people could think. It felt so good he wasn’t sure it was true.
Finn grinned and was about to start speaking, when the flames in the fireplace cracked and went green. Before Harry had the time to react, Ron and Hermione stepped out of the fireplace.
I laughed out loud. Too proud to ask directly, huh? Malfoy added some water in the coffee pot, trying to ignore the fact that I was openly making fun of him, but failed – I could perfectly see that the skin on the back of his neck turned pink.
She gave him a long look, and Harry wondered if she believed him.
“An ordinary petty theft. Welcome to the routine.”
“It’s been a long time!” Tony grinned, hugging her back. “How was it? Muggle London?”
“That’s my job.”
Meahwhile, Potter was beginning to look as if he had changed his mind about renting a room.
Potter seemed determined. He didn’t even enter the room: only glanced at it, standing in the doorway.
“It’s my pack, I’ll throw it around if I want to,” suggested Potter, casually swaying it in my direction. Okay, I figure I pissed him off. I’d tell him to leave, but he’d already payed for the first month, and I would look stupid giving him the money back. So I just stood up, snorted dismissively, and headed to the kitchen to make some more coffee.
-----------------------
“But you still ask for too soft measures.”
“No,” he answered simply. It was the first time in several years that he allowed himself to be honest about this.
“You sent me Howlers!
“What’s non-binary?”
The kitchen was a busy mess: Tony was baking something, so all of the surfaces were covered with either ingredients or bowls full of batter.
“Damn!”
“So, what is this house?” she asked, opening the bottle against the edge of the table. “Is this the Potter family house or something?”
“Um, why don’t you go to St. Mungo’s?” he asked.
“Mind if I wait for you?”
“Malfoy, have you already spoken to Mann?” I asked.
“Where exactly is it?”
“I owled the Auror office this morning, saying that I’m not coming back. I think I have made myself perfectly clear.”
I slammed the heavy door behind me, slipped out of my shoes. With a relieved sigh, I headed to the living room, where I had a fireplace.
“Potter, you don’t know his situation…” I started.
I am not going to think of my father right now. Not on a good day like today.
“No,” Harry answered, surprised, because it was true. “Quite the contrary, actually.”
“The day after tomorrow.”
A week was enough to realise all the stupidity of the idea. I could have given the ad one more week, but I decided to cut the crap and ask an old friend to live here, hoping that someone would be wanting to deal with me.
“Oh, okay,” Harry said, surprised. “You didn’t study at Hogwarts, did you?”
“How did he find me?! Fuck, fuck!” Draco sat down on the edge of the couch, but couldn’t stay calm and stood up again, clutched his shoulders and started pacing. “I have to find out how…”
“What about you three?” Finn interjected.
“Hey, hey,” Harry tried to get his attention. “Wanna get out of here?”
I stuck my head in a Muggle newspaper that I picked up in order to find a flat to rent, while Ron and Hermione went on discussing Ron’s future job. What do we have here… A house in the suburbs – no, that’s not what I want… A three bedroom – that’s too much… There. The ad that captured my attention was for an available room in a flat in the centre of London. Maybe a room wasn’t enough - but the flat was just a few miles away from the café, and I needed a place to stay as soon as possible. I decided I could always find something else later, but for now, a room would be fine. I said my goodbyes hastily, folded the paper and was on my way.
“I’m not really tired, the finals were easy,” I said. In reality, I had no idea what to do during the so-called “break”.
“Neither am I.”
“Does the Head Auror have a warrant?”
“I don’t know. First I lived to kill Voldemort, but then it turned out that people were expecting even more achievements from me…”
I remained silent, grinding my teeth. I wasn’t fifteen anymore. Potter can’t treat me this way.
Malfoy’s hand was still on Harry’s forearm, and Harry knew exactly what was it that he wanted to do in this precise moment. He hesitated for a bit, then covered Malfoy’s cold fingers with his hand; Malfoy didn’t move away. Harry leaned over and kissed him a little too abruptly, and when Malfoy kissed back, running his fingers through Harry’s hair and breathing heavily, Harry felt completely sure that he was doing the right thing.
He looked genuinely revolted. He was always easy to manipulate.
“Deal.”
“Make some for me too,” I asked him.
“No, a friend told me about this place.”
“I will. Thanks, Hermione.”
Potter nodded.
“What do you care? By the way, you forgot about the rule again…”
Draco gently touched Harry’s forearm.
Malfoy gave him a sympathetic look.
“It does, but you have to go out to get to work.”
“Hey,” he whispered, looking Draco in the eyes. “It’s okay now, he left.”
Harry lifted his eyebrows.
Alan Mann looked pale and scared. I wasn’t there to add to his fears: frankly, I was hoping he would tell me something that I could use in his favour. Unfortunately – and I was sure those were Malfoy’s instructions – Alan answered that he had already told everything to the public defender. Well, I wasn’t surprised: any good public defender would have given such advice.
“What is it?” he finally asked, hoping he didn’t do anything wrong.
“I demand respect-”
We were approaching the Ministry stairs when Malfoy noticed Parkinson down the street. She was reading the morning
The familiar voice and the green flash. I exist when I go to yet another encounter with Voldemort, my personal curse. Yes, even here I only exist, because to live and to die – and, most importantly, to be afraid of dying – in unbearable. So I exist when I look into the snake-like eyes while I hear my mother screaming in my head, because there is no way I can handle this if I let myself face it emotionally. Emotionally I will lose, so I play by his rules. I exist.
“By the way,” Draco added, “You might want to give your birth certificate directly to Annalise. I’m not sure if I’ll see her until next Saturday.”
“I said-”
I came back to Eaton Mews and regretted my compliancy almost at once. Turns out, Malfoy hadn’t grown up a bit: he kept saying nonsense and tried to piss me off, as if we were still at school. Fortunately, three years in the Auror office had toughened me up, and pissing me off wasn’t as easy as it used to be.
Several hours passed by. Finally, I put my notes aside. My stomach was empty, and I figured it was time for dinner.
“Great! I hope you get enough rest,” I answered.
The guy put his cigarette out against the pavilion wall and turned to face Harry.
“No, my parents’ house was destroyed during the war.”
Harry took a deep breath. This was no explanation – he was sure Emmet was aware of that.
“Yeah, well, it had to happen sooner or later,” Harry said, his eyes fixed on the bottle as he absentmindedly scratched the golden label with his nail. “What about you and Tony, are you… er…”
. Potter arrived in an hour, as promised.
“How long are you going to sit here?” he asked, without looking at me.
"No, no!" Dudley chuckled. "He was really in love with you. He spoke with so much passion, talking about how he was jealous and admired you." He grabbed his phone off the table.
"Hey Harry." He said, voice shaky and weak. The blonde gulped down his nerves, he was talking to him, just a slab of stone, yet he needed to get this out and make it feel as if he spoke to him. "Or Potter, should I say." Draco let out a dry chuckle."Pottah, that better?" He joked, listening to the wind and birds, even the trees rustling in the distance, including the students heading to their new class.
"That's alright, just toss me an apple!" Arthur said as he sat down next to his son. Draco did as requested and tossed him a perfectly ripe apple.
George and Draco quickly set the baskets of apples down before Draco opened the door again. Right as he was about to yell out his dog's name, she had jumped on him making him fall over.
Narcissa was over by the casket, crying as she placed a hand on his cold cheek. Lucius has come up behind her and awkwardly rubbed her back, trying to sooth her. But what shocked Draco was that Lucius Malfoy, his father who used him as a tool for the Dark Lord, had tears in his eyes. Now that, was the most shocking thing at this funeral.
Draco rolled up his sleeve, he was in the same clothes he died in; a button up shirt and jeans. Simple outfit for him, despite his expensive wardrobe of fashionable clothing. "I never expected you to come here. Or even be in spirit."
Dudley froze, he was correct. He knew it was going to happen, and was grateful to the potions as well as magic that kept him alive this long, he estimated about seven to eight years based off what he told him. He knew Draco was dying, and he knew that Narcissa who he loved as if she was his second mother, was the one making the potions and casting spells on Draco to stun the growth of the disease.
Narcissa stood up so quickly and apparted away. "Where did she go?" Molly asked, clearly worried.
"Malfoy is here!?" Ron hissed out, but before the two mothers could explain, George and Draco came back in. Both the boy were holding a basket full of freshly picked apples from the few apple trees. Draco had one in his mouth as George laughed. Draco was trying his hardest not to with the apple in his mouth.
In the living room of the Malfoy Manor was; the Weasley Family, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Pansy, and Blaise.
Lastly, is the heart. The heart is pretty rare to see, and very few have had flowers grow around it. Yes, around it. While the flowers grow within the stomach and lungs, the flowers grow around the heart, tightening around it until it bursts, killing the victim instantly.
Hermione is smart, but he didn't think she was that smart and he would praise her for it if he could speak with petals and blood falling out. Though the mention of The Boy Who Lived didn't always make him cough, he definitely could feel the flowers grow and scrape against the inner-walls of his lungs, while slowly tightening around his heart since the flowers begun to spread.
When Draco finally got out of bed, about ten minutes later; he dragged his un-stretched limbs over to his wardrobe where he pulled out clothes for the day, but as he was looking through them he stopped on a certain jacket. To be specific, a Gryffindor jacket, along with a few other things. Those few clothes had been Harry's despite the fact they didn't fit him at all. He remembered the day he was assigned to go check on the last of his family to give them the news, seeing them looking a bit pleased had pissed him off. Draco thought he was about to kill the three of them right there, yet he was rather good at reading emotions and saw that Dudley looked a bit distraught.
Narcissa had gathered everyone that had known Draco closer than others. This was because it had rules on the front of the envelope, and the people needed.
As Draco came down, his wonderful dog trotting behind him, happy as ever! He slowed down when he saw Lucius standing there next to the dark haired woman. Narcissa gave him a reassuring smile, but he knew behind it was an apologetic one.
"You may not believe any of it, but, I really am sorry. I shouldn't have acted that way towards you or your friends. Malfoy person, eh?" Draco took a deep breath, trying to breathe better before continuing. "I love you so god damn much, Potter. That's another reason I treated you that way. I felt like if I did, maybe my love for you would go away, maybe I would become straight. Yet you can't change or control sexuality. You know,I never wanted to be on the dark side,  I wanted to be with you, in the light, free of these stupid Malfoy chains and a Death Eater." He rolled up his sleeve to see the death eater mark that stained his pale skin. There was scars all over it, yet it still shown as if it was new. Clearly, he tried a lot of things to get it off. "You had your mark, and I have mine. Two things we fear. At least that we have in common."
But it took the war, and you dying for me to fix myself." His bottom lip quivered and he balled his hands up together. "I miss you..."
George let go when Harriet barked. Draco looked down at her since she was halfway up in his lap, he began to pet her. "I'm sorry." He apologized to the dog who whined, then went back to laying underneath his feet like she usually does, but she put her paw over her nose and huffed.
Those words caused the most pain to her husband who pulled her into an embrace. He knew he needed to change, but he was so fixated on being the best Malfoy. Acting like a Malfoy. Being a Malfoy. That was how he was raised, not to show emotion and be cold. He didn't know what a normal childhood was like, he didn't really know the meaning of happiness and have only felt it five times, but they were all very short as he began to lock those memories up.
Dudley fidgeted. "Actually.... Harry did always talk about you. He always spoke to Hedwig, I think her name was."
"Apologize for all the bullsh*t I did to you and your friends. But before that, Hermione and the Weasley got engaged. Not surprising really. George is doing better, yet when he eats he is silent it's honestly very creepy." A small laugh left his mouth, remembering the first time he had gone to the Weasley's to eat dinner with them. George definitely was silent, it really did creep Draco out since he has grown used to hearing his loud voice while eating back at Hogwarts.
The only noise was the sound of utensils against plates, cups lightly hitting the table, chewing, and Harriet on the floor under Draco's feet biting down on a pretty large turkey leg.
Did you enjoy it? I really hope you did! Any questions will be answered if you have any. Either in a tik tok, or a Q&A. You may ask questions about the story or myself, and I will give my best answer possible! This is indeed short, but the amount of time I've spent either crying coming up with endless possibilities of finishing the story, or writing was A LOT! It may have been a few days but I swear this is all I've really done, is write this. My cat cuddled with me, so it made me happy and prevented most tears. Did you cry?
~~~~~~~
Draco looked around, the castle looked almost the same. A few things were changed, like it seemed way more protected. Hagrid had gotten more things, such as a place to have all the creatures he has to have a home. And his hut looked to be upgraded, with Fluffy laying outside sleeping, but he was also chained to a spot next to Hagrid's door. There were a few more creatures lying about freely in the huge area they were given now, but they weren't entirely dangerous unless approached wrong, or they feel ill intent coming from someone.
Others had mourned over the deaths of friends, family and especially Harry Potter. Draco had heard the funeral for Potter was huge, and then now every year there is an anniversary thing that wizards and witches do.
"Why?" Draco asked. "Why, are you treating me like this?" Harry rolled his eyes and rubbed his temples. "You seriously do not listen to Dudley, do ya?"
"I've had this disease for years. Since Hogwarts." Draco answered and took a sip of his water.
Draco was there as well, in spirit. No one could see him, after all, he was a spirit and not a ghost. He stared down at his corpse that was in a casket meant for Malfoy's. His corpse had on a white tuxedo, instead of black. There was red roses surrounding him, as in his hands were the white roses. But outside his mouth, was still that beautiful black rose. It was a beautiful combination of colors, he wasn't going to lie. He watched as people mourned but near the end, he focused on his parents.
"You're free, my son." Lucius spoke, letting his own tears roll down. Narcissa nodded, agreeing with him.
Draco walked out onto the battlefield. Well, the old battlefield where the war ended. There was Harry's grave, exactly where he died. Red roses were growing around it, a few were growing up the sides, but it still looked beautiful than before yet still brought pain.
Draco shook his head. "I do listen! And I know you were also in love with me but-" Harry quickly cut him off. "Ah ah ah! No buts! I do love you. I mean I have for a while but still! Put our pasts behind us! Doesn't matter how many times we never spoke. Let's get to know eachother, better, than before."
Thank you for reading!~Ki
The blonde looked up at her, before noticing her hand along with Ron's. He smiled. "Congratulations!" He smiled and hermione got flustered but still had that look she had when she wants to know something.
Narcissa placed her hand on his and Draco gripped it, not tight but he was looking for a bit of comfort to calm down his nerves which skyrocketed when he saw the man he feared. The man that caused some of his problems, and used him. And now he was with them, to take Draco to therapy. "For Merlin's sake I believe therapy is useless." Lucius grumbled before apparting everyone, including the dog.
